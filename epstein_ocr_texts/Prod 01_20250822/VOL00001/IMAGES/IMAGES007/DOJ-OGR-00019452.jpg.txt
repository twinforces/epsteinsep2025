Case Caa® A0GDHY4-DEsuMEeR GDodORE RGA, ELEC DB] Hage FanfebS of 13

Here, Maxwell was indicted by a'grand jury on.Junc 29,2020; she has been detained.
‘pending her criminal trials and her'trial date has beén:sct. (8/19/20 Menninger Ltr, at,.2.). Should
‘discovery in. the civil action proceed, Maxwell would be forced to decide whether to defend
herself by making pretrial. disclosures and.giving deposition, testimony (which could be-used,
incrimination, (which, would:protect‘her inthe criminal case, but'which ‘could well result: in an,
adverse inference being drawn against.her in, the civil case). (Seé id, at 45 see also. Louis Viditton.
Malletier, 676 F.3d. at 97-98 (discussing the burdens to the Fifth Amendment privilege:that-may
be’posed, by parallel, proccedings).) ‘This legitimate coneern, made more real, and. immediate by:
the active posture of criminal case, militates in/favor of a stay.

3. The Interests of the Plaintiff

Plaintiff asserts that staying this proceeding’ would. harm her interests because, as. she is

suffering “ongoing damaging effects” ‘from. the alleged abuse, aiid. she should not haverto wait,

any longer'to: hold-Defendants accountable. (8/27/20 Glassman Ltr., at 4.) While, as a general

matter, plaintiffs have.a strong interest in the cxpeditious resolution. of their civil claims, see
Volmar Distributors, 1S2.F.R.D.at.40, Plaintiff here has not.advanced any. particularized reason
why a delay would cause her prejudice, such as.a.likely loss of physical evidence or witness
testimony'during the period of a stay. (Séé 8/19/20 Menninger’ Ltr., at.1, (noting that. “there: is
little chance that any evidence will. be lost.in the :interim given.the age ofthe accusations in-this
case”); see also id.,'at 4):

Additionally, although. this Court is not suggesting that Plaintifflhas any obligation to
agrec to.a stay so'as to pursuc her claims through the Compensation, Program. (and, in fact,

recognizes that.she does not), this Court docs note that a stay would not entirely hinder Plaintiff
