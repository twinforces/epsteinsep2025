Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page34 of 58
compromises Ms. Maxwell’s ability to seek a stay of the unsealing process and
thereby safeguard her right to a fair trial in the criminal case.

The government can hardly dispute the merit of Ms. Maxwell’s argument
for a stay. After all, the government itself moved to intervene and to stay all
proceedings in Doe v. Indyke, a civil case in which Jane Doe alleges that Epstein and
Ms. Maxwell abused and exploited her as a minor. ATTACHMENT B, p 4 (Doe ».
Indyke et al., No. 20-cv-00484, ECF Dkt. 81, 9/14/2020 Order Granting Motion to

The court there agreed, and it granted Ms. Maxwell’s motion to stay. /d. at 12.’

“If a stay in Doe v. Indyke preserves the integrity of the criminal prosecution
against Ms. Maxwell, Judge Nathan should have modified the criminal protective
order so Judge Preska could have evaluated whether keeping the deposition
material under seal would similarly “preserve the integrity of the criminal
prosecution against Ms. Maxwell.”
