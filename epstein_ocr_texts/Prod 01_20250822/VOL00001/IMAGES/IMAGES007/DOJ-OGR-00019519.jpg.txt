who had spoken ¢ on "the public record. in litigation relating to Ieffrey Epstein. Id. ¢ 4, Here, ‘defense
counsel seeks permission to publicly identify. any individuals who, have selfzidentified, as victims
of cither'the defendant or Epstein “to the media or in public ‘fora, or inJitigation”—a vastly broader
allowance. Indeed, as a comparison, none-of the hypothctical.cxamples described above would
have:been. subject: to public naming and identification under the L:pstein protective order, but every.
single one would.be under the defendant’s proposed order in this case.

Additionally, beyond the differencés in the language: itself, there are two significant:
differences between the circumstances of the ipstein. prosecution and.this case. First, atthe time:
the /:pstein protective order was entered, there:were cxceptionally:few victims who had identified.
themselves by name in litigation. Accordingly, the practical, application of that, provision was
extremely limited. Second, and related, in the time: between when ‘the./:psiein:proteetive order'was
enteréd and the indictment:in this case, many. more victims have made public statements about:
theif Victimization at the hands of: Epstein, and the defendant, on:their own terms and in theit.own,
ways, including by exercising their rights under the ‘Crime Vietims® Rights Actin the context of
not possibly have predicted, much less chosen, that’ their names “would ‘be publicly broadcast by
defense counsel in.connection with.a:subsequent:criminal,casc. Victims: should be able to continue
to come. forward, in. the ways.and in the venues they themselves choose, ‘without ‘fear of reprisal,
shaming, or other consequence arising from having their identitics. broadcast: by: defense: counsel
in this ‘case,

In. sum, the requested ‘modification to the Government’s ‘proposed order sought: by’ the
defendant.is contrary to-precedent andthe. compelling privacy interests of'victims. Morcéover, it is
without basis in. fact.or law, and, despite the Government’s repeated requests for clarity, the
defendant.and. defense counsel, have offered no: legitimate reason. ‘for their desire to beable to
publicly ‘identify. any number of victims, in the context.of this criminal, case ‘and. clsewhere, other
than.a minimal, conclusory statement, without factual examples or legal support:? At-bottom, the
deéfendant.and her counsel seek anunlimited ability to name victiiis and.witnesses-publicly, for no
discernible reason, and without justification or legal basis. The victims of Ghislaine Maxwell and
Jeffrey Epstein have suffered. cnough, and the Grime “Victims” Rights Act, applicable law, and.
common, decency compel far more protection of their privacy interests here than the defense
proposal would, afford..

B. ‘The: Defendant’s. Demand:that the:Government Restrict Use: of:its Own. Documents:

The defendant and. her counsel also ask. the Court to impose restrictions ‘upon. the
Government in its ‘use, through. potential witnesses and their counsel, of documents it. currently’
‘possesses, beyond. the already-cxtensive restrictions and. protections applicable to the:

> To the extent defense counsel. attempts to provide such examples or arguments :for the first
time ‘in.a. reply filing, the Government. respectfully requests Icave:to reply to those: examples or
arguments.
