motion.alters that conclusion.

32. “Asa general matter, this Court. will adhere to its own decision.
at an earlier stage of the litigation.” United States v.. Plugh, 648 F.3d 118, 123 (2d.
Cir. 2011). The ‘‘law of the case doctrine is subject to limited.exceptions made for
compelling reasons,” such. as. where there is “an intervening: change of controlling
law, the.availability of new evidence, or the need to correct a clear error or prevent
manifest injustice.” /d. at 123-24; see also United States v. Jenzer, 213 F.3d 34,
39 (2d Cir. 2000) (“We have stated that 'we will not depart from.‘this sound policy:
absent.cogent or compelling reasons.”). Maxwell has offered no persuasive reason,
prior decision.

33. The only new events that. Maxwell cites as justification for her
request ‘that this Court reverse itself is additional letter briefing before the District.
Court regarding MDC’s nighttime security checks. Nothing: about that briefing or
Judge Nathan’s most recent written order suggests that Judge Nathan clearly erred
when finding Maxwell poses a. flight risk or abused her discretion when determining

that temporary’ release is not'warranted.
