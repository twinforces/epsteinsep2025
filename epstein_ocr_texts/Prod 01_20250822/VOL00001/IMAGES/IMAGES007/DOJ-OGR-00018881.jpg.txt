THE COURT: That iiay Or may hot be true depending on

the testimony.

MS. STERNHETM: ‘Well, it would, be héarsay as, ‘to her
knowledge, having gained it from somebody remotely -in. the
comipany providing ‘that to Her.

THE COURT: So if her testimony is, this is the

practice and this, was, the longstanding practice, I learned it

from predecessors. or the like, she might have -- just as her
understanding of the practice of Maintaining records is what
she learned in the course of her employment, it may be —- I'm
doubtful that. we'll get this testimony. We'll sé6é what the
testimony is.

My current thinking is 823 comes in. That gives == I

mean, what I understand, the relevance to be -- and there is no

objection to 823, 824, absent the content, I'm nét sure gets
you anything beyond, what. 823 gets ‘you.

MR. ROHRBACH: TI think that's right, your Horior. If
824 could net. come in with the content, we probably would not
offer 824.

I would like to just Mave this conversation with

Ms, Gill, as she's been the head 6f HR for Mar=a=Lago for quite

a long time. She's reviewed this particular employment file,

which is much larger than this sét of recérds; S6 I think she
may have a great well more to say about these issues and we
would like to be able to talk with her.
