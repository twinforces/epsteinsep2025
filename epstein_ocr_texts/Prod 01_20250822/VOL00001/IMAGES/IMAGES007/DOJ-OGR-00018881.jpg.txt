1 THE COURT: That may or may not be true depending on

2 the testimony.

3 MS. STERNHEIM: Well, it would be hearsay as to her

4 knowledge, having gained it from somebody remotely in the

a company providing that to her.

6 THE COURT: So if her testimony is, this is the

7 practice and this was the longstanding practice, I learned it

8 from predecessors or the like, she might have -- just as her

9 understanding of the practice of maintaining records is what

10 she learned in the course of her employment, it may be -- I'm
11 doubtful that we'll get this testimony. We'll see what the

12 testimony is.

13 My current thinking is 823 comes in. That gives -- I
14 mean, what I understand the relevance to be -â€”- and there is no
15 objection to 823. 824, absent the content, I'm not sure gets
16 you anything beyond what 823 gets you.

17 MR. ROHRBACH: I think that's right, your Honor. If
18 824 could not come in with the content, we probably would not
19 offer 824.
20 I would like to just have this conversation with
21 Ms. Gill, as she's been the head of HR for Mar-a-Lago for quite
22 a long time. She's reviewed this particular employment file,
23 which is much larger than this set of records. So I think she
24 may have a great well more to say about these issues and we
25 would like to be able to talk with her.
