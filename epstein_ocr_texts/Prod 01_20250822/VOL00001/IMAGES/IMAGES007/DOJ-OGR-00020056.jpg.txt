exaggerated response to Epstein’s death, effectively punishing Ms. Maxwell for the BOP’s own
negligence with respect to Epstein."

Counsel has attempted to address the restrictions in numerous letters, emails and calls to
the MDC warden, the MDC legal department, and the prosecutors, but to no avail. Rather than
repeating these points here at length, we refer the Court to our letter to the MDC warden, dated
October 29, 2020, which details the most serious and extraordinarily restrictive conditions of
confinement.’ These include:

« De Facto Solitary Confinement

= Excessive Surveillance

= Excessive Scanning and Strip Searching

« Deprivation of Food

= Deprivation of Sleep

# Deprivation of Communication with Family and Friends

= Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel
The conditions of Ms. Maxwell’s detention are utterly inappropriate, and totally disproportionate
for a non-violent pretrial detainee with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a
quarter-century old. Moreover, they adversely impact her ability to prepare her defense and
compromise her physical health and psychological wellbeing.

In addition to these intolerable conditions, Ms. Maxwell has had to contend with
numerous unacceptable delays and technical problems with the discovery that the government
has produced to her thus far. We have raised these issues with the prosecutors on numerous
occasions. As we advised the Court in our letter of October 23, 2020, defense counsel first
'! These conditions are especially inappropriate because Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary inmate and has not
received any disciplinary infractions since her arrest. In fact, she has been made a suicide watch inmate, which is
the highest and most trusted responsibility that an inmate can have. It is the height of irony that Ms. Maxwell is
being constantly surveilled as if she were a suicide risk when she, herself, is trusted enough (if she were ever
released from isolation) to monitor inmates who are truly at risk of suicide.

2 The Warden never responded to the letter. In our response to the government’s 90-day status report concerning
MDC conditions, counsel requested that the Warden provide a first-hand report to the Court and counsel. Following
Court directive for a report from the MDC, MDC Legal submitted a letter that recited BOP policy but failed to
address a number of concerns.
