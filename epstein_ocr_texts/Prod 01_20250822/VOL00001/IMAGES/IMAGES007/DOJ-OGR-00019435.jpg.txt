Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page36 of 58

In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Ms. Maxwell elected not to invoke her Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination in reliance on the civil protective
order and this Court’s decision in Martindell, which guarantees, at the very least,
notice and an opportunity to be heard on a government motion to modify a civil
protective order to obtain a deposition transcript. Martindell, 594 F.2d at 294; App.
368-69, aa
eel his Court should permit
Ms. Maxwell to tell Judge Preska what happened and let Judge Preska decide
whether the information weighs against unsealing the deposition material or in
favor of a stay.

The government insists otherwise, arguing that modification of the criminal
protective order would comprise the secrecy of its ongoing grand jury investigation.
App. 92. This contention is implausible on its face because Ms. Maxwell’s
proposed modification of the criminal protective order doesn’t threaten to
compromise the secrecy of anything. All Ms. Maxwell seeks is permission to share
information with Judge Preska under seal. (i
