LC8VMAX6 Rodgers —- cross

1 A. That's right.

2 Q. That is not a passenger manifest, right?

3 A. No, it is not.

4 Q. You had a practice, I think you described this, of taking

5 the manifests and then taking the names of the passengers and

6 entering them in your own personal pilot logbook, right?

7 A. Correct.

8 Q. So that's why your logbook has those -- that information in
9 it, right?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. But that's your particular practice; it's not what every
12 pilot does, right?
13 A. Correct.
14 Q. Okay. Now, you said on direct that if you didn't get all
15 the names of the passengers, which happened from time to time,
16 you would still try to keep track of how many passengers there
17 were?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. And if you didn't know their names, you might put in
20 something like "one passenger" or "one PAX" to indicate an
al unnamed passenger?
22 A. Correct.
23 Q. And then later you might have put -- or around the same
24 time you might have put "one female” or "one male" to indicate
25 the gender, right?
