providing the Notice to Doe | at the new address for any future pleadings that implicate his or
her deposition, which is currently subject to the Second Circuit’s stay.

Third, to prevent against some of the errors that occurred during the last round of
unsealings, we request that the Protocol be amended to require the Responding Original Party
who proposes unsealing to supply with their Response a proposed unredacted set of the
pleadings at issue, for the Court’s consideration and for the Objecting Original Party or Non-
Party to have the right of reply. Preparing those redactions after the fact allows much
ambiguity into the Court’s ruling and we believe the Court’s ruling should specify which
redactions it is accepting or rejecting at the time of ruling.

Finally, we request that the Court allow for the any objecting Non-Party or Original
Party be given 7 days following any unseal order to apply for relief in the Second Circuit from
the order prior to the documents being released.

Proposed Next Set of Docket Entries for Review:

Given the Second Circuit’s stay concerning Ms. Maxwell and Doe 1’s deposition
transcripts and materials that quote from them, we propose that the Court deviate from the
Doe 1 and 2 chronology (given that Doe 1’s deposition is sprinkled throughout those motions)
and instead take the following five decided motions and their related pleadings. This list
represents the first five chronological decided motions that (a) have sealed or redacted
materials and (b) do not have attached or quote from documents subject to the stay. They are:

e 75 —Defendant’s Motion to Compel Responses to Defendant’s First Set of
Discovery Responses to Plaintiff
e 139- Plaintiff's Brief in Support of the Privilege Claimed for In Camera
Submission
e 155 -Defendant’s Motion to Compel Non-Privileged Documents
e 215 - Sharon Churcher Motion to Quash Subpoena
e 231 - Defendant’s Motion to Reopen Deposition of Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre
Counsel for Ms. Maxwell is available for a telephone conference to discuss any of the
foregoing, should the Court desire.
Respectfully submitted,
Gor~ &.
