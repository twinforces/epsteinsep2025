AVOCAT A LA COUR

challenge the refusal before French courts, while such challenge could have led to a judicial
review of the request, in accordance with the ordinary extradition procedure.
Secondly, in the absence of a published judicial decision, it is impossible to determine what the
outcome of this case would have been if it had come before the courts.
Third, as was rightly pointed out by US Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama in their
aforementioned letter to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, which the government cites in
its memorandum:

“Article 3 of the Extradition Treaty between the United States and France provides in

pertinent part that “There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the

extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State”. While this Article

does not require the extradition of a national to a requesting state, it also does not

appear to preclude extradition. To the extent there is discretion available in such

extradition decisions, we urge the French government to exercise that discretion in

favor of extradition ”.
I am satisfied that this is the right interpretation of Article 3, as this is exactly the conclusion I
came to in my first report. To the extent that there is a discretion, there can be no absolute rule
against the extradition of nationals under French law. A discretionary power 1s not a legal rule.
Indeed, there is no constitutional principle against the extradition of nationals. For these
reasons, the Peterson case does not alter my view that under the specific and unique facts of
this case, it is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an
extradition decree against Ms. Maxwell, particularly if Ms. Maxwell has signed an irrevocable
waiver in the USA.
Finally, if an extradition request were to be issued against a French citizen today, the obligations
of the French government under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France would
also need to be read in light of the Agreement on extradition between the European Union and
the United States of America, which came into force on February 1*', 2010, several years after
the Peterson case. Article 1 of this Agreement, which enhances cooperation between
Contracting Parties, provides that: “The Contracting Parties undertake, in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement, to provide for enhancements to cooperation in the context of
applicable extradition relations between the Member States and the United States of America
governing extradition of offenders”. The existence of this Agreement would need to be taken
into account by the French government in the exercise of its discretion as to whether or not to
grant the extradition of a French national to the USA.
