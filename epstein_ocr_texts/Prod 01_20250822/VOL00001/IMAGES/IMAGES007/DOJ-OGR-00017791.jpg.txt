LC1VMAX5 Jane -â€” cross

1 Q. And there you just said you were 13, right?

2 A. It says there that I'm 13, yeah.

3 Q. And that was what was filed by your attorney in court?

4 A. Yes.

S Q. And you told the government 13, but later they refreshed

6 your memory that maybe you were 14, right?

7 A. No, I always from the beginning said 13, but I turned 14

8 that summer.

9 Q. Okay. I'll have you take a look at 3509-008, page 11. And
10 looking at that, do you recall the government asking you --

11 THE COURT: Where?

12 MS. MENNINGER: I apologize. The second from the --
13 second full paragraph from the bottom up.

14 Q. Does that refresh your recollection about a conversation

15 you had with the government?

16 A. No, because I didn't write any of this. The second half of
17 that makes sense, which is I was probably 13. And it says here
18 that I turned 14 that summer.

19 Q. So you were not asked if it was possible that you met
20 Epstein after you turned 14?
2l A. I don't remember.
22 Q. But I understand now you're saying you believe you were 14
23 because it was later in the summer, right?
24 A. What was later in the summer?
25 Q. When you met Epstein.
