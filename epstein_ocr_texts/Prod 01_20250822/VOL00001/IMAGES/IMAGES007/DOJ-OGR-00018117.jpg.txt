testify that he found or hé saw at least a greéén massage table

when they did the video sweep and that he was. able to look. at

that! table when he was there im the housé, and then hé saw what

2005, a full year latér.

Him seeing semething that appeared. tq be semen, first,

they never tested it, it's in a rdéom with lotions for massage,
How he knows this appears ‘to be semen, I don"t know, but
regardless of that fact, it's done a year after the facts Any.

that ends in 2004, unless ‘they can, show that the semen, was on.

that, is going to be prejudicial of the client. So we object. on
401, 403.

be very brief and very clinical. He would deséribe seeing a

white, stain that he 'saw and thought was consistent with the

appearance of semen, and I think that is entirely
