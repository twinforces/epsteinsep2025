1 testify that he found or he saw at least a green massage table
2 when they did the video sweep and that he was able to look at

3 that table when he was there in the house, and then he saw what
4 appeared to him to be semen on the table.

a I don't think that that testimony is appropriate

6 because, for example, on both 401 and 403 grounds, this table

7 was found a full year after the last year of the conspiracy

8 charged here, so that's 2004. The search was October 20th,

9 2005, a full year later.

10 Him seeing something that appeared to be semen, first,
11 they never tested it, it's in a room with lotions for massage.
12 How he knows this appears to be semen, I don't know, but

13 regardless of that fact, it's done a year after the fact. Any
14 number of ways that could have been on there, if it is, in

15 fact, semen, I don't see how it's probative of a conspiracy

16 that ends in 2004, unless they can show that the semen was on
17 the table during the time period of the conspiracy.

18 Given that, if we have an agent talking about semen in
19 front of the jury, that's just going to be a salacious detail
20 that is going to be prejudicial of the client. So we object on
21 401, 403.
22 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I expect this testimony would
23 be very brief and very clinical. He would describe seeing a
24 white stain that he saw and thought was consistent with the
25 appearance of semen, and I think that is entirely --
