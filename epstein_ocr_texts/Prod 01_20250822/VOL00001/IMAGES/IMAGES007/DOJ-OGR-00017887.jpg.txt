S BY MR. ROHRBACH:

6 Q. Mr. Kane, when an application is received by a Professional
7 Children's School, what happens?

8 A. As I mentioned, the admissions director would review the

9 information, contact the family, would bring them into the

10 school if it looks to be a good fit for the school and would

11 begin to interview them. So the family is first contacted by
12 phone, and then the family would be brought in to tour the

13 school and to have a conversation with the admissions director.
14 Q. Does the Professional Children's School rely on the

15 information in these records when it makes its admissions

16 decision?

17 A. Yes, they do.

18 Q. Does the Professional Children's School make admission

19 decisions in the ordinary course of its business?
20 A. YSS.
al Q. And after the Professional Children's School makes
22 admission decisions, does it retain the applications?
23 A. Yes.
24 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, based on that record, the
25 government offers again this exhibit.
