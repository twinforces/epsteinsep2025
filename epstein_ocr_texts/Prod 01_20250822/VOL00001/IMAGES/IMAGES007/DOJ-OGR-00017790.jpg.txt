LC1VMAX5 Jane -â€” cross

1 Q. Christmas specials, a wide range, right?

2 A. No Christmas special yet, I don't think, but yeah.

3 Q. You had a reality show we talked about a little while ago?
4 A. Unfortunately, yes.

5 Q. Which was not real?

6 A. No, it's not real.

7 Q. Your accusations in this case depend significantly on

8 you -- your memory that you were 14 when you met Epstein;

9 correct?

10 A. Correct.

11 Q. You repeated it a number of times on the stand, right?

12 A. Right.

13 Q. Well, actually, when you first met with the government, you
14 told them that you were 13 when you met Epstein, right?

15 A. No, I said I might have been 13 going on 14; because my

16 birthday is in August, and I believe I met them earlier in the
17 summer. So it was just a small technicality, I guess.

18 Q. Well, in your civil complaint in the first paragraph, you
19 said it all started in 1994, when 13-year-old Jane met Epstein
20 and Maxwell; correct?
21 A. Correct. I was 13 in June and July.
22 Q. You didn't say "13, going on 14."
23 A. I don't know. I don't know.
24 Q. Okay. Do you want to take a look at 3509-007, paragraph 1.
25 A. Okay.
