1991) (“The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not, recognize a ‘motion to reconsider.’ Instead,
the rules allow a litigant subject to an adverse judgment’to ‘file cither a motion’to alter or amend,
the judgment... or a motion secking relief from the judgment.”); Lrujillo v. Bd. of Educ. of
Albuquerque Pub. Sch., 212. F. App’x 760, 765 (0th Cir. 2007) (unpublished) (SA. district court:
has discretion to, revise interlocutory orders prior to entry of final judgment.”). Hence, “[w]hen a.
party’ secks to obtain reconsideration of a non-final order, the motion jis ‘considered ‘an.
interlocutory motion invoking the district court’s general discretionary authority to, review. and

The scope of reconsideration, however, is narrowly: cabined and far more limited than in,
an ordinary appeal. That is, a ‘motion. to reconsider is an “inappropriate vchicle[] to reargue: an.
‘issuc previously addressed by the court when the motion merely advanees new arguments, or
supporting facts which were available at the time of the original motion.” Servants of Pardaelété
v: Does, 204-F.3d..1005, 1012 (10th. Cir. 2000) (citation omitted). Rather, “[g]rounds warranting
‘a, motion to reconsider, include (1) an, intervening change in the: controlling law, (2):new evidence:
previously unavailable, and (3)'the.necd to correet-clear error or prevent manifest injustice.” Jd.
Here, several, ‘pieces’ of previously unavailable evidence justify the request for

reconsideration. Servants of Paraélete, 204 F.3d at ‘1012. First, ‘when. ‘the; Court: denied. Mr.
