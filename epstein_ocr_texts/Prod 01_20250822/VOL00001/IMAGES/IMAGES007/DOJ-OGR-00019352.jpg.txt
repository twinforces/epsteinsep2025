States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d 487, 490 (2d Cir. 2007). In over 70 years since
Cohen was decided, despite “numerous opportunities” to expand the doctrine,
Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799, the Supreme Court has identified only four

trial, Sell v. United States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003). In contrast, the circumstances in
which the Supreme Court has “refused to permit interlocutory appeals” in criminal
cases have been “far more numerous.” Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799.

legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated
before trial.’” United States v. Punn, 737 F.3d 1, 5 (2d Cir. 2013) (quoting Lauro
Lines s.r.l. v. Chasser, 490 U.S. 495, 498-99 (1989)). “The justification for
immediate appeal must . . . be sufficiently strong to overcome the usual benefits of
deferring appeal until litigation concludes.” Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558
U.S. 100, 107 (2009). A ruling that is burdensome to a party “in ways that are only
