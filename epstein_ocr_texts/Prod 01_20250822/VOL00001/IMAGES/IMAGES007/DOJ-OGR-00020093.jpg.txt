counsel, and when visiting is available depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant
has access to legal visits. Due to the recently implemented lockdown at the MDC, visitation is not
currently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to receive a VTC call
with legal counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense counsel will
also be able to schedule legal calls on weekends as needed. Given those facts, the defense
argument essentially suggests that no defendant could prepare for trial while housed at the MDC—
a patently incorrect claim.

The defendant is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by the
Government, discs that defense counsel can send containing any copies of discovery material
defense counsel chooses within the confines of the protective order, or hard copy documents
provided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple steps to address technical
difficulties the defendant has encountered when reviewing her hard drives. These steps included
modifying and reproducing productions in new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the
defendant in viewing her hard drives on the MDC computer, and then purchasing and providing a
laptop for the defendant’s exclusive use.!° Even when the defendant was temporarily unable to
review some files from some hard drives, she was always able to review other portions of her
discovery.

0 The Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the defendant has access to the
laptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and has access to the MDC desktop computer
thirteen hours per day seven days per week. The use of the laptop is limited to weekdays because
the MDC restricts the number of employees who carry the key to the secure location where the
laptop is kept, and the employees with that key do not work regularly on weekends. The MDC
previously accommodated an exception to this rule while the defendant was in quarantine and
arranged for her to use the laptop in her isolation cell on weekends because otherwise she would
not have had access to a computer during weekends while in quarantine. Now that she is out of
quarantine, the defendant will have access to the MDC desktop computer on weekends.
