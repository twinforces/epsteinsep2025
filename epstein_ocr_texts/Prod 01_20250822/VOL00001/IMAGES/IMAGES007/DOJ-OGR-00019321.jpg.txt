Re: August 3, 2020 Order (Doc. 1096)
Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell, No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP)
Dear Judge Preska:

I write in response to the Court’s Order of August 3, 2020 (Doc. 1069), the Order and
Protocol for Unsealing Decided Motions (Doc. 1044) (“Protocol”), and to raise with the Court
the legal effect of new information that came to the attention of counsel for Ms. Maxwell on
Friday, August 7, 2020.

New information: On Friday, August 7, 2020, counsel for Ms. Maxwell learned of
critical new information that impacts both this action and U.S. v. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
(the “Criminal Action”). The information implicates Ms. Maxwell’s right to due process and
fairness in this civil action and affects the Second Circuit’s review of the Court’s unsealing
order of July 23, 2020. Additionally, the information implicates her rights as a criminal
defendant guaranteed under the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Amendments.

Counsel makes the representations about implications of the new information as an
officer of this Court. At this time, counsel is not at liberty to disclose the information because
it is subject to a protective order in the Criminal Action, which forbids its use “for any civil
proceeding or any purpose other than the defense” of the criminal action absent “further order
of the Court.” Protective Order, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) at {¥ 1(a), 18 (Exhibit A). As required by
that Protective Order and Judge Nathan’s Individual Practices in Criminal Cases, counsel
initiated a conferral with the U.S. Attorney’s Office over the weekend concerning a
modification of the Protective Order to share the information with this Court and the Second
Circuit. Barring agreement, Ms. Maxwell intends to seek modification of the Protective Order
in the Criminal Action from Judge Nathan forthwith to permit sharing the information with
this Court, ex parte and in camera if necessary, and with the Second Circuit (likewise under
seal if necessary).
