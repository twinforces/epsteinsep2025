Conceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case

As Ms. Maxwell’s period of detention passes the nine-month mark, the government has
continuously upgraded Ms. Maxwell from a “plain [ ] risk of flight” to a “substantial and
actual risk of flight” to a “serious flight of risk” and now to an “extreme risk of flight.” (Dkt.
165 at 1.) Ironically, her level of flight risk increases as the strength of government’s case
against her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has challenged the strength of the government’s case
in pretrial motions pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has
persuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in
2007, which immunizes “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwell’s
prosecution in this case, and that the counts charging her with alleged sexual abuse are
time-barred.

The government’s response to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions shines further light
of the weaknesses of its case. For example, the government concedes it cannot establish that
either Ms. Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she
was a minor or that she was underage when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.
(See Opp.162-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot support the conspiracies charged
in the Indictment, leaving the government with only two witnesses to prove the charges against
Ms. Maxwell. More importantly, in connection with the government’s response, it
produced documents indicating that government prosecutors misled a federal judge to
obtain evidence against Ms. Maxwell (see, e.g.,. Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a shocking revelation that
undermines the viability of the perjury counts, not to mention the integrity of the entire
+ Accuser-3 is identified in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”
