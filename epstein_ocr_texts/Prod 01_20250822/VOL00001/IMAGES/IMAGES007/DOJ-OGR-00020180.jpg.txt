‘Conceded Problems Undermine the Strength of the Government’s Case

As Ms: Maxwell's ‘period of detention passes the nine-morth mark, the government has:
continuously upgraded Ms. ‘Maxwell froma “plain [ ] risk of flight” ‘tova “substantial and
actual. risk. of flight” to a “scrious flight of risk” and now to an “extreme risk, of flight.” (Dkt:
165 at 1.) Ironically, her. level of flight risk inereases as the strength of government’s ease
against. her diminishes. Ms. Maxwell has. challenged the strength of the government’s. case
‘in pretrial motions ‘pending before the Court. Among other things, Ms. Maxwell has
persuasively argued that the Non-Prosecution Agreement entered into by Jeffrey Epstein in
2007, which:immunizes “any: potential co-conspirators of, Epstein,” bars Ms. Maxwells
prosccution. in this'case, and that: the counts charging: her-with alleged.sexual. abuse are
time-barred.

The goVernmenit’s response to, Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial, motions, shines, further light
of the weaknesses ofits case. For example, the government concedes it cannot-cstablish that
cither Ms. Maxwell or Epstcin ever'caused, or sought: to cause, Accuser-3* to travel while she:
‘was a minor‘or that she was ‘underage. when she allegedly: engaged in sex acts with Epstein.
(See Opp. 162-65 & fn. 57-58.)° Hence, her allegations cannot:support, the conspiracies charged,
‘in, the Indictment, leaving the government; with-only two witnesses to prove the charges against
‘produced documents indicating that, government prosecutors misled.a federal judge to
‘obtain evidence against:Ms. Maxwell (sce, ¢.g.,..Opp. Ex. 4-7) - a. shocking revelation that

‘undermines the viability’ of the perjury: counts, not 'to mention the integrity of the: entire

+ Accuser-3 is identificd in the Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.”
