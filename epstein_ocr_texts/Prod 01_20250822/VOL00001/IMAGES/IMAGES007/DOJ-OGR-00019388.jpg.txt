for this Court to adjudicate regarding Judge Nathan’s Order — the lone Order on
appeal in this matter — if the Court were to grant Maxwell’s request to consolidate
these appeals. Accordingly, the motion to consolidate should be denied.

29. For the foregoing reasons, Maxwell’s appeal should be
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. If the appeal is not dismissed, the Government
respectfully requests that the Court deny Maxwell’s motion for consolidation.
