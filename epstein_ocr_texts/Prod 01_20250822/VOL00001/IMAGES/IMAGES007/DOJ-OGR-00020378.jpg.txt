Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page20 of 24

Maxwell did not couch her most recent request to the District Court as an application
for pretrial release; instead, she sought an order directing the MDC to modify its
operations or justify its procedures. In the absence of any evidence that the MDC’s
protocols interfered with Maxwell’s trial preparation, Judge Nathan acted well
within her discretion in declining to order the MDC to alter its security measures.
Even in so doing, Judge Nathan reiterated her commitment to monitoring Maxwell’s
conditions of confinement and ensuring that they do not interfere with preparation
for trial. This series of events simply does not suggest that Judge Nathan abused
her substantial discretion when denying Maxwell’s prior applications for bail or
temporary release.

37. To the extent Maxwell now raises new complaints about
conditions at the MDC before this Court, such issues should be presented to the
District Court and reviewed by Judge Nathan. In any event, as was the case with
her concerns about nighttime security checks, Maxwell has offered no evidence to
support her claim that these additional complaints are true or prevent her from
preparing for trial. There is simply no evidence in the record beyond the bare
assertions of counsel that MDC’s water is undrinkable, that the MDC provides
inadequate food, that the MDC audio records legal visits, or that sewage overflows
