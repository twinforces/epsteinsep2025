2 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, Sergeant Dawson was the

3 police officer who took Juan Alessi's confession after the

4 burglary. He came into the precinct, Sergeant Dawson

5 Mirandized him and took his statement. Juan Alessi denied

6 making some of the statements that we think are clearly

7 reflected in Sergeant Dawson's report.

8 Among other things, he denied going in twice to steal
9 the money. It's as clearly in the reports that he went in

10 twice and stole money on two occasions. The first occasion he
11 was going to try to steal the gun, he didn't find the gun, said
12 he took money. He went back several weeks later and stole

13 more. I think we're entitled to impeach or to point out and

14 elicit the prior inconsistent statement of Juan Alessi through
15 this witness.

16 MR. ROHRBACH: This is an entirely collateral matter,
17 your Honor. Whether Mr. Alessi went once or twice to steal

18 $6,300 only goes to his character for truthfulness or at beast,
19 also possibly impeachment by contradiction. But in either
20 sense, it's totally collateral to any of the central issues of
21 this trial. They would not be able to independently prove up
22 any of these facts but for Mr. Alessi having testified.
23 MR. EVERDELL: It was a Mirandized statement, your
24 Honor. Mr. Alessi put his credibility directly at issue about
25 these very statements when he said, I am going to tell the
