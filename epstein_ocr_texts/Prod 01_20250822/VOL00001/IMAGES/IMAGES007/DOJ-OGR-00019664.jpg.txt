Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page18 of 23
“the Government had charged her with perjury in connection with civil cases.”
Ans.Br. 23 n.7. But knowing that the government had copies of her depositions is a
far cry from knowing [a
ee Vis. Maxwell’s original consent to the
criminal protective order is irrelevant to this appeal.

The government next argues that Ms. Maxwell has not offered a “coherent
explanation of how the criminal discovery materials could have any conceivable
impact on the issues pending in civil litigation.” Ans.Br. 24. To the contrary, Ms.
Maxwell has repeatedly explained why the criminal discovery is relevant to Judge
Preska and the panel of this Court reviewing Judge Preska’s order. Op.Br. 26-33.

In addition to the reasons identified above, This Brief, supra at 7-10, Judge
Preska simply never had before her the full picture when deciding whether to
unseal the deposition material. So Judge Preska never considered the government’s
position that the sealed material should not be released because it might prejudice
the ongoing investigation. Nor did she consider Judge Nathan’s view, embodied in
modification of the criminal protective order is fully consistent with that purpose,
because she seeks only: (1) to share relevant information with Judge Preska; (2)
under seal; (3) iS ; and (4) to facilitate Judge
Preska in performing a non-merits task assigned to her by this Court.
