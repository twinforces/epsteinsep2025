impact. on thé issues pending in civil litigation.” Ans.Br. 24. To the contrary, Ms.
Maxwell has repeatedly explained why the criminal discovery is relevant to Judge
Preska and the panel of this Court reviewing Judge Preska’s order. Op.Br. 26-33.

In addition to the reasons identified above, This Brief, supra at 7-10, Judge

because she séeks only: ( (1) to share relevant inforn to share relevant information with Judge Preska; (2)

under seal; (3)7—___ and (4) to facilitate Judge

Preska in performing a.non-merits task assigned to her by‘this Court.
