are scrious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if convicted; the evidence proffered by the
Government, including multiple corroborating and. corroborated. witnesses, is strong;, the
Defendant has substantial :resources and. foreign tics (including citizenship iin.a country that docs
not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who lived in hiding and apart from the family to
whom, she, now asserts: important. ties, has not ‘been, fully candid about her financial situation.”
(Déc. Op. at.2). In:secking bail fora third time, the -defendant’s Motion rests principally on two
additional. bail, Conditidns. Neither of these conditions will reasonably’ assure.the defendant’s
appearance in court, and ncither outweighs all.of'the: other factors that: make this defendant an.
‘extreme flight risk. Morcover, the Court should reject as premature the defendant’s assertion, that:
her pretrial, motions have somchow weakened the Government’s:casc; those motions have not been,
adjudicated, ‘and, for the ‘reasons, set forth in, the: Government’s opposition memorandum, the
defendant’s motions, have no. merit.

In, short, all three of the relevant Bail Reform Act factors—the nature and circumstances
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and.characteristics of the defendant—
continue to weigh heavily: in favor of, detention, and the defendant’s Motion does not ‘present any’
information that warrants revisiting this Court’s well-reasoned and, detailed prior décisions.

A. Applicable Law

“After'a-court has‘made‘an.initial determination that:no conditions of:release can reasonably.
assure the appearance of the Defendant as required, the Court ‘may reopen the bail hearing if
‘information ¢xists. that was ‘not known to the movant.at.the time of the hearing aiid that has a
matcrial bearing.on the issue’ of whether pretrial ‘detention is warranted.” (Dee. Op. at 4 (quoting
18 ULS.C, §.3142(f). “A. court may also-revisit its own decision, pursuant to its inherent authority,
even, Where the circumstances, do not match, § 3.1.42(f)’s:statutory'text:” (/d..at-5). Although courts
in ‘this Circuit have recognized that “a relcasc order*may: be reconsidered even where the evidence
proffered on reconsidcration’was known. to. the movant at the time ofthe original hearing,” United
States v. .Rowe,.No. 02.Cr.’756 (LMM), 2003. WL-.21:196846, at. *1 (S.D.N.Y. May: 21, 2003),
generally the moving party’ must establish ‘that: its arguments “warrant reconsideration” by, for
example, demonstrating “that the court overlooked: information.or incorrectly applied:the law.” on
‘that failure to ‘reconsider “would constitute manifest injustice.” United States v. Petrov, No. 15
Cr. 66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. ‘Mar. 26, 2015).

‘B. Discussion

The defendant’s Motion rests on three arguments, none of which is availing. First, the
defendant offers to renounce her forcign citizenship, claiming that’ this climinatés the risk’ that.she
will. flee. from prosceution. Second, the defendant offers to place: some. .of her assets, in, a
monitorship with. unspecified terms, and-which.would still. lcave-her. with. substantial unrestrained.
assets. Third, the defendant claims that her voluminous pretrial, motions have diminished. the
‘strength, of the'Government’s case. ‘None of these arguments is‘persuasive, and 'the;Motion,should.
be denied.
