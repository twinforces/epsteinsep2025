MR, PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, this Amanda person. was not
noticed under 404(b). We Had ‘two that were noticed. As I
recall, that's the Melissa and Virginia, and that's it.

MS. MENNINGER: ‘Not just 404.(b) «

Your Honor ordered that the government produce to us
the names, of any wictims that ‘they intended to discuss at
trial, They gave the names of six individuals; the four that
we normally have been ‘talking dbowt, Ms. Roberts, dnd ‘this last
one. But. Amanda was not one of the names. that they gave. So

questaon. It's entirely not corroborative in identifying a new
victim if the testimony yesterday was 18.

MS. COMEY: And, your Honor, I would want to check the
transcript for this.
