1 THE COURT: Right. It's a streamlined version of the
2 closing argument. And again, I'm not aware -- I'm not aware —-
3 certainly seen summary with investigative officers. That's not
4 this. And I've seen officers who are analyzing complicated

a data under 1006 provide that to the jury. That's not this.

6 And I've seen, when the evidence comes in, the government spend
7 a fair amount of time -- as you've done with some exhibits —--

8 going through piece by piece in order to highlight and draw

9 certain connections.

10 I'm not going to let you do it through a witness who
11 has no personal experience. I think you do it in closing.

12 That's what this is, it's closing argument.

13 MS. MOE: Understood, your Honor.

14 THE COURT: Okay. What else?

15 MR. PAGLIUCA: I think the only open issue that I'm

16 aware of, your Honor, is the Exhibit 52 issue.

17 THE COURT: Yes. I got the briefing at 9:45, so 15

18 minutes early finished, I appreciate it. And I am still

19 dotting my i's and crossing my t's. I think we don't need it
20 till the government is prepared to rest; is that right?
21 MS. COMEY: That's correct, your Honor.
22 THE COURT: You agree with that?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: Anything else to take up now?
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Not from the defense, your Honor.
