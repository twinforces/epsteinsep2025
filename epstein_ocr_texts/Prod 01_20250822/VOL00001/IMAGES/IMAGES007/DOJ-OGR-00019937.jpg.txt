1 THE COURT: Among other things, but, yes, I'm drilling
2 down specifically on that since that has been, in somewhat

3 comparable circumstances in other matters, the source of issues
4 related to timely disclosures.

5 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Our team met personally

6 with the F.B.I. in Florida to make sure that we had the

7 materials, and it was represented to us that the materials that
8 the F.B.I. provided in Florida were the comprehensive set of

9 materials. We will certainly have ongoing conversations to

10 make sure that that is the case and if, in our review of files,
11 we discover other materials, we will handle that with great

12 care, and we are particularly sensitive to that concern.

13 THE COURT: And I expect here, and in all matters, not
14 just accepting of initial representations made regarding full
15 disclosure, but thoughtful and critical pushing and pressing of
16 questions and issues with respect to actively retrieving any

17 appropriate files. Are we on the same page, Ms. Moe?

18 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Very much so.

19 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.
20 With that, why don't you go ahead and lay out the
al proposed schedule that you have discussed with Mr. Cohen, and
22 then I will hear from Mr. Cohen if he has any concerns with
23 that proposal.
24 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
25 We would propose the completion of discovery, to
