UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
VIRGINIA L. GIUFFRE,

Plaintiff,
No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP)
-against-
ORDER
GHISLAINE MAXWELL,
Defendant.
LORETTA A. PRESKA, Senior United States District Judge:

The Court has reviewed the parties’ letters dated August 10
and August 11, 2020. (See dkt. nos. 1099-1101.) The Court writes
specifically to address Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell’s request for
a three-week stay of the unsealing process due to the availability
of “critical new information” related both to this action and to
the pending criminal case against her, U.S. v. Maxwell, No. 20 Cr.
330 (AJN). (See dkt. no. 1100 at 1-2.)!

Ms. Maxwell’s request is denied. Given that Ms. Maxwell is
not at liberty to disclose this new information because it is
subject to the protective order in the criminal action, (id. at
1), the Court has no reasonable basis to impose a stay. And, as
Ms. Maxwell knows, her ipse dixit does not provide compelling
' Pursuant to the Court’s Order dated August 3, 2020 [dkt. no.
1094], the parties have also submitted to the Court for resolution
various disputes related to (1) methods for streamlining the
unsealing process, and (2) the next set of docket entries to be
reviewed for potential unsealing. The Court will address those
disputes at a later date.
