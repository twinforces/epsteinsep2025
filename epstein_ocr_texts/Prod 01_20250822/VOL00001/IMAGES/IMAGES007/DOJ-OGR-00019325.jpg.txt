specifically to, addréss, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwéll’s request for
a three-week stay of the unsealing process due to the availability

of “critical new information” related both to this action and to

the pending criminal, case against, her, U.S. v. Maxwell, No. 20 Cr.

330 (AUN). (See dkt. no. 1100 at 1-2.)!
Ms. Maxwell’s reguést is denied. Given that Ms. Maxwell is

not at libérty to disclose this new information becausé it is

subject to the protective order in the criminal action, (id. at
1), the Court. has no. reasonable basis: to impose a stay. And; as

Ms. Maxwell knows, hen ipse dixit does not. provide compelling

' Pursuant to the Court”s Order dated August 3, 2020 [dkt. no.
10:94], the parties have also submitted to the Court for resolution
