Case 20-3061, Document 94,.10/08/2020, 2948481, Page13 of 23

deposition material is prematurely released, as the government so clearly desires,

Third, Ms. Maxwell intends to move Judge Preska to stay future unsealing
pending the outcome of the criminal case. But she cannot fairly make her case to
Judge Preska unless Judge Preskaknows([__——SSSSSS—s—sS—CéCS<;«C*™r
Cc ~~~ Judge Preska and, the panel
of this Court deciding the unsealing appeal are the only relevant actors who don’t
know the relevant facts.

The government’s ‘second contention—that Ms. Maxwell can already share
the “basic facts” with Judge Preska—imisunderstands what Ms. Maxwell:seeks to
share (under seal and not publicly) and what Judge Nathan’s order permits (not
very much). According to the government, Ms. Maxwell is. free to'share the
identity of “Court-1” and “Court-2” and

the fact that the Government obtained an order from Court-1

permitting the Recipient to comply with a subpoena for materials

3 Surely due process does not contemplate.a scenario in which Ms. Maxwell
is'‘never permitted to challenge
[__} But.that’s apparently the government’s position. Ms. Maxwell
did not know of the | proceeding before CdS so she:
couldn’t argue-against | Ms. Maxwell did not

knowwhen[——SSS—S—~CSCSCCS, S. She Couldnt appeal.
And if Judge.Preska’s unsealing order goes into effect, the government will séek to
deny Ms. Maxwell the right to challenge its conduct before Judge.Nathan.
