2 THE COURT: Go ahead.

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: So this is on the privilege objection,
4 your Honor. The statement did not call for a communication.

12 her. I don't think you've made a record that any materials

13 shown to her were in anticipation of being -- how did you

14 phrase it? Discussed with the government in the meeting?

15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, the Court sustained the objection
16 and ordered me to move on, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: I understand. I'm just --

18 MR. PAGLIUCA: There was no opportunity to further

20 THE COURT: Right. To be clear, I think the question

22 objection sustained. There may have been other questions, I
23 suppose that would have been different than that, but I
24 sustained with respect to that question.
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: So, I'm not arguing with your Honor.
