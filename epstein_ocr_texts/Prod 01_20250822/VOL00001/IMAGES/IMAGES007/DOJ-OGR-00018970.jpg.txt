THE COURT: I don't know what the question is
éliciting.

MR, EVERDELL: Lt seems evident to me that what the

government, wants to gét into is the fact of MS. Maxwell's

father's death around that time. Because I think. what they're
going to try t6 do is, arguie that his déath was somehow a ‘motive
fer her because of their wealth or something connected to her
father, ahd She had, to move to a Stallér apartment.

Now, this is something that is outside of the scope of
the cénspiracy and wasn't. évén == our understanding, it wash't
even her apartment on 59th; she shared a room with somebody.
THis is really gétting totally outside the scépe. It is three
years before the conspiracy allegedly began and, it is ‘totally

out of bounds here bécause they are trying to link it up to

something that. has no melevance to this case.
MS. GOMEY: Your Honor, I think that what the witness
will say is that -- I think the witness will say that her

father died in bétween thdése two, that's all I plan to elicit:

And, then she moved to a much smaller apartment. She then moved

to a series of larger apartments, ehding in a large townhouse.

There's evidence that Jefiney Epstein bought, that townhouse for
her. This goes té Ms. Maxwell's tmiotive to participate in these
crimes with Mr. Epstein in. terms of the finances that. she:
received and the fact that she was not a particularly wealthy
