Maxwell can argue on the public record that unsealing
the materials would have a prejudicial effect on her
right to a fair trial. To the extent Maxwell complains
that unsealing filings in a civil case may result in un-
fair pretrial publicity in her criminal case, she will
have the opportunity to request that the District Court
establish practices to help ensure she gets a fair and
impartial jury.® If she is displeased with those efforts,

8 Maxwell makes much of the Government hav-
ing moved to intervene and stay the proceedings in Doe
vu. Indyke, noting that the Government has not moved
to intervene in Giuffre v. Maxwell, to stay the unseal-
ing process. (Br. 29). Maxwell suggests that the Gov-
ernment’s decision to not do so is motivated by “un-
principled” reasons. (Br. 29-30). Setting Maxwell’s
conspiracy theories aside, Doe v. Indyke and Giuffre v.
Maxwell are in completely different procedural pos-
tures, which implicate different concerns regarding a
pending criminal case. The latter was resolved in 2017
and the determination of what material should remain
sealed remains the only open issue. Accordingly, there
is no more discovery to be conducted in the Giuffre case
and no possible concern to the Government that, for
example, its trial witnesses in the criminal case might
be deposed in that civil case. Additionally, the fact that
a document may be unsealed through an independent
process before Judge Preska would not reveal the Gov-
ernment’s investigative focus or techniques.

In Doe v. Indyke, on the other hand, discovery was
just beginning, and if discovery were to have pro-
ceeded, multiple witnesses or potential witnesses at
