1 from the relevant time period in this case. We've already had
2 a lot of testimony about how there were frequent renovations to
3 these places, we had testimony from Juan Alessi about that, and
4 so there is no reason to believe that the interior of this

a townhouse looked the way it did in 2019, whether it looked the

14 don't think they do, then these are irrelevant and they

15 shouldn't be admitted to the jury because there is no basis to
16 believe that this is what the place looked like on the inside
17 back 15 years before. I believe the only witness they have

21 something to the effect of, there was old wood, it was dark,
22 there were creepy animal pictures on the wall. That's all we
23 had. I think she said she may have slept on the eighth floor
24 in the guest room, but there certainly wasn't a room-â€”-by-room
25 description of what this place looked like. And my
