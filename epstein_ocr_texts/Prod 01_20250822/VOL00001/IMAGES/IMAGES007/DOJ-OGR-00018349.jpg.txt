1 massagers to which Jane testified. In short, these photos have
2 little, if any, relevance and they're likely prejudicial

3 because they are likely to confuse the jury.

4 The four sets of photos that the government seeks to

a admit, photos 936 and 938, depict a room with a stuffed tiger

8 contained, quote, creepy-looking animals and animal heads and

9 strange things. Trial transcript at 305 to 318.

10 I will exclude these photos, first, both the dog and
11 tiger are moveable items such that the photos taken in 2019

12 are, without additional testimony, not probative of what Jane
13 would have seen years earlier. Second, though Jane described
14 artwork of animals, she did not describe a stuffed dog or

15 tiger. The photos therefore have little corroborative value,
16 even if, as the government argues, the dog and tiger are highly
17 idiosyncratic. And the photos are unfairly prejudicial because
18 they're likely to confuse the jury by suggesting that these

19 same items were in Epstein's apartment at the time that Jane
20 was there. Further, the idiosyncratic nature of the items is
21 likely to distract the jury, it could delay trial as the
22 connection to Jane's testimony is tenuous at best.
23 T'll note that, as I've said, the schoolgirl outfits
24 found in the New York apartment in 2019 that the government
25 intends to introduce, as I said on Friday, I anticipate these
