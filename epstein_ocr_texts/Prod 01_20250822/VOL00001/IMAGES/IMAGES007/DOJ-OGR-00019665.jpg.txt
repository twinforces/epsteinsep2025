This Court tasked Judge Preska with evaluating whether and to what extent

the civil case filings should be unsealed considering the totality of the

Preska is performing this task ignorant of the fact that
TET
Dn Unless the criminal
protective order is modified, Judge Preska will remain in the dark, and she will
never be given the opportunity to consider the circumstances in their totality.

The government appears to have abandoned the argument it made to Judge
Nathan that modifying the protective order threatens the secrecy of the ongoing
grand jury investigation. Op.Br. 31-32. And for good reason. Ms. Maxwell has

® The government’s view that | should not be released,
and Judge Nathan’s order to that effect, also lend support to Ms. Maxwell’s
contention that the release of the deposition material by Judge Preska

trial by an impartial jury. See U.S. CONST. amends. V, VI; Vixon v. Warner
Comme?ns, 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978).
