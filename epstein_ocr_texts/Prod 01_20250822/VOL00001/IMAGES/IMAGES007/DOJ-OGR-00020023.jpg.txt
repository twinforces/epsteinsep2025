company has confirmed that they have never done this for any client, and that he is:
willing to do so for Ms. Maxwell because he is confident that she will not try to flee.

* Ms. Maxwell will remain in the custody of a U.S. citizen
who has lived in the United States for 40 years. will : serve as Ms.
Maxwell’s third-party custodian under'18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1)(B)() and will live with.
Ms. Maxwell in a residence in New York City until this case has concluded. We have.
identified an appropriate residence in the Eastern District of New York that has been
cleared by Ms. Maxwell’s security company.

* Travel restricted to the Southern and Easter Districts of New York, and limited as
necessary to appear in court, attend meetings with counsel, and visit with
doctors/psychiatrists/dentists, and:upon approval by the Court or Pretrial Services.

* Surrender of all travel documents with no new applications.

* Ms. Maxwell will provide the Court irrevocable written waivers of her right to contest
extradition in France and the United Kingdom.

* Strict supervision by Pretrial Services.
* Horne confinement at her residence with electronic GPS monitoring.

* Visitors to be approved.in advance by Pretrial Services, with:counsel and family
miembérs to. be pre-approved.

* Such other terms as the Court may deem appropriate under 18 U.S.C.-§ 3142.

For her own safety, Ms. Maxwell will also have on-premises security guards 24
hours ‘a day, 7 days a week. The security guards will prevent'Ms. Maxwell from leaving the
residence at any time without prior approval by the Court or Pretrial Services and will escort
her when she is authorized to leave. If the Court wishes to make private security a condition
of her bond, the guards could report to Pretrial Services.! We believe these conditions are

more than sufficient to:reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.

1 As we argued in our initial bail application, this case involves the limited circumstance under which the Second
Circuit approved granting pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that she pays for private armed security
guards. United States v. Boustani, 932 F.34.79, 82 (2d Cir. 2019) (defendant who “is deemed to be a flight risk
primarily because of [her] wealth . .. may-be released on such a condition only where, butfor [her] wealth, [s]he
would not have been detained” (emphasis i in original)), Therefore, Ms. Maxwell may be released on the condition
that she pay for private armed security. (Dkt: 18 at 20.16.)
