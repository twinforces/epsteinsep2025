Il. Ms. Maxwell Should Be Granted Bail Under the Proposed Strict Bail Conditions
A. Ms. Maxwell Has Deep Family Ties to the United States and Numerous
Sureties to Support Her Bond

Attached to this submission are letters from Ms. Maxwell’s spouse and from
numerous close family members and friends, many of whom have agreed to serve as sureties
to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application. (See Exs. A-N, W-X). Far from the
cruel caricature that the press has so recklessly depicted since the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,
these letters demonstrate that Ms. Maxwell is generous, loving, and devoted to her family
and friends, and that her life is firmly rooted in this country with her spouse
a. The signatories of these letters have known Ms. Maxwell for decades, and
some for her entire life. All know her to be the antithesis of what the government has
alleged. They trust her completely, including with their minor children.

These people have stepped forward to support Ms. Maxwell, despite the considerable
risk that, if their names ever become public, they will be subjected to some of the same
relentless and harassing media intrusion and personal threats that Ms. Maxwell has
experienced for years. As a sign of their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will remain in this
country, the sureties have agreed to sign their own bonds and to post meaningful pledges of
cash or property in amounts that would cause them significant financial distress if Ms.
Maxwell were to violate her bail conditions.

These letters directly address the concern the Court expressed at the last bail hearing
that Ms. Maxwell did not have “any dependents | or] significant family ties” to the United
States. (Tr. 84). If Ms. Maxwell were to flee, she would be leaving behind the family that
has been the center of her life a. she would be abandoning her spouse fj
