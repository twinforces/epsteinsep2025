1 would be admissible if the witness connects these outfits to

2 the applicable timeframe by testifying that they're similar to
3 the outfits she was allegedly instructed to wear.

4 Last, the government references photos taken in

a Epstein's apartment that depict photos of celebrities. I think
6 the government here represents that it doesn't intend to admit
7 these photos but will elicit the testimony of law enforcement

8 officers that they saw celebrity pictures. Government's brief
9 at 12. Defense notes it would oppose admission of the photos.
10 T'll reserve judgment until I have a better sense of what the
11 government is seeking to do with those photos.

12 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, can I ask a clarification
13 question on the last point. I expect the government will ask
14 that witness about the decor of Epstein's house and that the

15 witness will say something like there were many photos of

16 celebrities and nude photos of women, but the government would
17 not offer any exhibits that demonstrate that fact. So the

18 government just wants to make sure that that question would be
19 a proper question. I understand the Court is reserving until
20 it hears the answer.
21 THE COURT: I'm reserving on the admission of the
22 exhibits, which it sounds like you're not moving?
23 MR. ROHRBACH: We're not planning.
24 THE COURT: I don't see anything wrong with that
25 question.
