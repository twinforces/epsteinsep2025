Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 755 Filed 08/10/22 Page 84 of 262 1789
LC8Cmax3 Hesse â€” direct

1 witnesses, there is a sufficiently regular practice to permit

2 admissibility under 803.6 for the purpose of showing that

3 someone reporting to be a given name and calling from a

4 particular number called on the dates indicated, and there are
5 a number of other indicia of trustworthinesses described by

6 Ms. Moe. So I'll overrule the objection and I'll admit the --
7 well, you're seeking admission of the full message books with

8 the ones you indicated or just the ones you indicated?

9 MS. MOE: We're just offering the subsets of the

10 marked exhibits that I read into the record. If defense

11 counsel would prefer that the books themselves be admitted

12 along with it, we certainly would have no objection about that.
13 We just tried to be more narrow.

14 THE COURT: I would say part of my analysis depends on
15 having reviewed the full set of books.

16 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. I have no objection to

17 offering Government Exhibits 1, 2, and 3, and I can do that

18 when the jury returns.

19 THE COURT: Okay. Anything else to bring up before
20 the jury comes back?
21 MS. MOE: Nothing from the government, your Honor.
22 THE COURT: We can bring the witness back.
23 Mrs. Hesse, you may take your seat. Thank you.
