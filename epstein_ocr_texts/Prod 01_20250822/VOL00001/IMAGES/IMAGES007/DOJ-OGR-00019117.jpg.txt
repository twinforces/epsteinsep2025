Have a gréat evening. We'll seé 'you tomorrow.

(Jury not present)

THE COURT: Everyone may be séatéd.
Okay. Matters to take up?
MS. MOE: Your Honor, we just wanted ‘to provide the

Court with an update on timing. We anticipate that we may rest

tomorrow or, if things run, long, on Friday morning.

THE COURT: Okay. Does the defense anticipate moving

to a defense case after the close of the government's, case?

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we do have witnesses. L

tHink we haven't Had the Chance t6 confer with the government.

yet, but I think it might make sense, especially if we finish
on Thursday potentially, to have the Charge conference on
Eriday so we can have ‘time to fully address it.

THE COURT: I'll neéd you to pull up the mic.

MR. EVMERDELL: We will likely have an, application, at.
the é6nd of thé government's case, as is typical fd6r the
defense. And we'd want the chance to be heard on that as well.

THE COURT: So my thinking had been the Charge

conference either 't

he evening of the loth or, if the parties

were interestéd in taking me up on Saturday the 18th. So I

suppose it depends ,£ you're saying there is -- you won't be --
well, I would prefer, given just timing of when I'm going to be
able to get you the charge, to not do it Friday, unless you
don't ‘have a case to put on on. Friday.
