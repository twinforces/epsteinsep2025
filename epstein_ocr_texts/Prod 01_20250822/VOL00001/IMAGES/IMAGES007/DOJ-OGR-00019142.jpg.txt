issue dnd it's Close, I"ll admit, based on where I am how. 1
think it's close.

But what I'm wondering iS if what the défense
essentially needs. to make the arguments it wants to make is

testimony from Mr. Glassiian that he told the government thdt he

told Jane that some form of cooperation or testimony would help

her case. That gitiéstion might have some evidentiary issués,
but it's not an attorney-client privilege issue,

I thimk the answér to that quéstion basically géts the
defense what it's looking for without infringing on
attorney=Cliént privilege. And sé I'd like you to consider 4
proposal in which ‘the testimony that you're seeking is limited
to that and, depending on the parties' views and Mr. Glassman's
views, .J£ that ds the Limit of the testimony, whether it could
be through stipulation.

SQ you'll consider that.

MS. COMEY: Yes, your Horor.s

MR. PAGLIUCA: We will, your Honon.

THE GOURT: Okay: All right.

Anything else I can take up?

We're checking on our jurors.

MR. EVERDELL: Nothing from the defense, ‘your Honor.

THE GOURT: I'm sorry.

So you put in the letters to me last, night on, 52.

You'll docket those today?
