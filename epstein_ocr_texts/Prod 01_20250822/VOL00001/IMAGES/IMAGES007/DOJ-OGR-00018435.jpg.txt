MS, POMERANT2Z: The government 1s concerned about this
lime of glie6stioning. She's asking a Series Of qGuéstions about
her romantic history, It seems unduly invasive,

THE COURT: Just a moment. ‘We had an earlier sidebar.
I permitted her to ask. questions based on the declaration
regarding someone who said she planted drugs on the person, that
she's. mow asking a question about. So, how is the objection
consistent with that ruling?

MS, POMERANTZ: I understand that ruling, your
Honor == my understanding is I frankly didn't khow that's where
it was going, but it's also my concern, is ‘that it's been a,
series of Guestions that Have just béén basically a litany of
questions. --

THE GOURT: Gounsel, whén you have an objection, I
rule on it. A series of questions objections doesn't fly.
Please béar in mind my rulings, that that is why we do it. at
the sidebar, that's why the juny had a 45-minute break, I
dén't. need a sidebar every time a Question that I've approved
Ls asked.
