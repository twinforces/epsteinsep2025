as-Mr. Julié’s accompanying rebuttal report explains (see Ex.,'A), the MOI letter ‘ignores that the
extradition provisions in French Code of Criminal Procedure apply.only i the absence ofan
international agreement providing otherwise. (Id. at 1). ‘This rule is necessitated by the French
Constitution, which requires that international agreements prevail over national legislation. (/d.).
Thus, extradition of a French national to the United States is legally permissible if the extradition
treaty between the: United States and France provides for it—which it does. (Id. at 3).

The government’s reliafice'on a 2006 casé—in which France refused to extradite 4
French national who .was also a U.S. citizen—provides no precedent as to how.a French court
would rule on an extradition request regarding Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr: Julié notes; the
United States did not:challenge the refusal in the French courts. (/d..at 2-3). Nor does it
undermine Mr. Julié’s opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where.a citizen of both countries.
has executed an ‘extradition waiver and-then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by:a
U.S: court, it is “highly unlikely” that an extradition decree would not be issued. (Id. at:3).

The government offers no.rebuttal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell’s U.K. extradition
expert; David Perry. Nor does it dispute Mr. Perry’s opinion that Ms: Maxwell would be“‘highly
unlikely” to successfully: resistextradition from the United.Kingdom, that her waiver would be
admissible in any-extradition proceeding; and-that—contrary to the government’s representation
at the:initial bail heating (Tr. 27)—bail would be “extremely unlikely.” (See Def. Mem. Ex. U at
4139). Mr. Perry’s addendum opinion (attached as.Ex. B) reiterates these points, opining that the:
waiver would be“‘a highly relevant factor” in the U.K. proceeding; both to the likelihood of

extradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Id. q3).

"Nor, a the govertirhent suggésts, does the Secretary.of State have general “discretion to deny extradition” after'a
courtihas: entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem: at 19). That discretion is limited to a handful of
exceptional: circuitistatices that would likely be inapplicable to’ Ms. Maxwell’s casé. (Id. 94-5).
