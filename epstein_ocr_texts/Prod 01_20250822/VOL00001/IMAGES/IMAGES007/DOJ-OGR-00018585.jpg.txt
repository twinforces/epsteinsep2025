1 emails or took the photographs or were in the photographs could
2 testify and identify themselves, no such evidence would ever be
3 offered in court. But of course that's not what happens. ALL
4 we do is we offer law enforcement agents who seized these items
5 and can authenticate them, and if defense wants to make

6 arguments to their relevance or otherwise, that goes to their

7 weight and not their admissibility, and those arguments are for
8 the jury.

9 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, in many criminal cases,
10 there are lots of context over what photographs are admissible
11 and for what purpose. For example, if it was a photograph that
12 was taken inside of a store when there was a robbery that
13 purported to take place in the store, there would be a witness
14 to say that this photograph was taken in or near the events and
15 that we have reason to believe that nothing inside the store
16 has changed. Just showing photographs that are undated, they
17 may be from 1975 for all I know, and showed the two of them
18 together and there is no one to say that it hasn't been altered
19 in the meantime, even the low bar of showing that the
20 photograph is a photograph and without a witness to say it is
21 what it purported to be, I don't think that that is true with
22 respect to what is admissible for a photograph. It's a low
23 bar, but there is not even a single person that can say that
24 this photograph or the ones behind it are what they purport to
25 be.
