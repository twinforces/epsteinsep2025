LC7Cmax2 Flatley - cross
1 THE COURT: Overruled.
2 A. I have no idea.
3 Q. You don't know whether the computer was sitting in the
4 middle of a kitchen that other people could access it; right?
S A. I don't know where the computer was.
6 Q. You don't know who was around the computer at any
7 particular point in time; correct?
8 A. The only thing I know is that there were three user
9 accounts on the computer â€” two were created by default when the
10 computer was made and the only other user account was
11 Ghislaine.
12 Q. So anyone who used that computer was using that Ghislaine
13 Maxwell user account; right?
14 A. That's correct.
15 QO. No other user account was used; correct?
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. So if Ghislaine was not present with the computer when a
18 document was made, that would suggest other people had access
19 to the computer; correct?
20 A. I don't know who had access to the computer.

22 THE COURT: You may.
