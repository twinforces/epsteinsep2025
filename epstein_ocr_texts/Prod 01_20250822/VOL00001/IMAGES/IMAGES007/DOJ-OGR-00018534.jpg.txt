1 We'll bring in the jury.

2 Counsel, was I right, those other 900 exhibits needed
3 redaction of photos of individuals?

4 MS. MOE: Your Honor, with respect to those exhibits,
S just so I'm sure I understand --

6 THE COURT: 911, for example. It looks like there's a
7 photo in the right corner.

8 MS. MOE: I just wanted to make sure we'd redacted the
9 right thing. I received a note about that issue.

10 We weren't sure whether the issue was the painting

11 over the mantel —-— we've redacted that —- or whether there was
12 something else.

13 THE COURT: No. On the right-hand side there's a

14 table with a lamp. There's a lamp marked D and there's a photo
15 of -- I can't quite tell, but I'm sure if somebody looked

16 closely, they could tell of an individual.

17 MS. MOE: Oh, I see. Sorry, your Honor, I had not

18 noticed that. We will unredact the painting and re-mark it to
19 redact that photograph, if the Court requests.
20 THE COURT: Well, you tell me. Does it need to be
21 redacted to protect privacy interests? I don't know -- for
22 example, I don't know if this is a witness. I don't know.
23 MS. MOE: Apologies, your Honor. I'm not familiar
24 with the person in this photograph. I can't tell from the
25 photograph. We certainly have no objection to redacting it for
