Case 20-3061, Document 38,.09/16/2020, 2932233, Page19 of 23

“orders denying access are final. as /o the intervenors.” Lugosch v. Pyramid.Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F 3d 110, 117 (2d Cir. 2006) (emphasis added). By contrast,
rulings governing the parties’ use of discovery materials — such as Judge Nathan’s
Order here — are not appealable in the context ofa criminal, prosecution until after
judgment is entered. See Caparros, 800-F:2d at 24;.Pappas, 94 F:3d at'798.

24. Judge Nathan’s Order does not fall into one of the narrow
categories of decisions in.a.criminal case reviewable on interlocutory. appeal.
Accordingly, Maxwell’s appeal should be dismissed.

25. ‘Even if Maxwell’s appeal is not dismissed — which it should
be:— her motion to consolidate the appeal in this criminal case with the appeal in
the Giuffre v.. Maxwell civil case should be denied.

26. Despite Maxwell’s efforts to characterize this criminal case as
somehow intertwined with. the Giuffre-civil case, the issues ‘on appeal are factually
and legally distinct. The civil appeal.concerns Judge Preska’s order unsealing civil
litigation materials. The Government is not a party to the:civil suit, the
Government has never interveried or appeared in the civil suit, the Governinent has
had:norole in the litigation that resulted in Judge Preska’s order, and the

Government has no legal interest :in the relief Maxwell seeks in.the civil. case. For
