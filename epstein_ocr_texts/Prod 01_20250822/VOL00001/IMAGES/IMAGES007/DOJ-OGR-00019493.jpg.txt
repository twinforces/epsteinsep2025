Although Ms. ‘Strauss sprinkled. her comments with the ‘phrase “as alleged,” she’presented
certain of her statements as, fact:? Regardless, after'Ms. Strauss’s remarks, FBI Special Agent
William Sweeney. went evenfurther, calling Ms. Maxwell “one:of the willains ‘in this
investigation” and:compared her to a snakethat. “slithered away to a gorgeous property in. New
Hampshire.” Thus, Mr, Sweency: offers the Government’s,, again flatly: wrong, opinions about
character and guilt while, at the same time, invoking a’semi-biblical reference involving a snake
‘slithering away to a garden:i in, New ‘Hampshire. These types of comments, which, scrve no
compelling law enforcement or investigatory ‘purpose; are ‘prohibited, by’ the: local rules of this
District:

New York attorney David'Boies and his partner Sigrid MeCawley, who represent several,
witnesses in this matter, have also made public and, presumptively prejudicial statements iin.
‘recent days, notwithstanding the fact, that.such conduct is-prohibited by Local Rule 23.1, which
applics'to, lawyers practicing :in this District, generally, and lawyers for witnesses, specifically:
SeeRule: 23. 1(a) and (b). :

As:reported bythe Washington, Post, Mr. Boics expressed his views on the prohibited,
subject:of “thé possibility ofa pléa of guilty to the offense charged or'a lesser offense” in
violation of scetions (d)(5) and (7) of the Rule:

Boies said:he thinks Maxwell will be ‘under tremendous pressure to cooperate’ as.
she ‘looks for ways to shave time off what may be a significant: prison sentence.

Maxwell could, potentially help prosecutors. shed light' on. Epstein’s dealings. with
other wealthy and. influential people who may have had encounters with
underaged ‘victims, he said, adding “There were a lot of people with a lot of public:
stature who were involved’ with Epstein.”

Ms. MeCawley echoed. Mr. Boics, saying'that, “The pain. [Maxwell] has caused will never go
away but-today is.a step:toward_healing.” Id.

Bradley. Edwards, another attorney:representing witnesses in this matter made similar.
presumptively prejudicial statements following Ms. Maxwell’s arrest:°

“The reality of how. this organization worked ‘was that. 99. mM ‘of it was

that u um, ‘there was a main “facilitator ‘that started ‘the whole thing, i it was 5 Ghislaine.
