1 THE COURT: Good morning, everyone. Matters to take

2 up, counsel?

3 MR. ROHRBACH: A couple matters from the government,

4 your Honor.

S THE COURT: Yes.

6 MR. ROHRBACH: First, we just wanted to confirm, as

7 per our discussion at the end of the day yesterday, that

8 whether or not the defense is planning to recall Jane and

9 whether they are releasing Brian from subpoena.

10 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I had understood that

11 there was going to be a conversation with Jane about the

12 conversations she had with her brother, and that would be

13 disclosed to us. I didn't receive that last night. I think we
14 need to know whether there is not truth telling going on in the
15 recounting of this event.

16 THE COURT: And that's with respect to recalling Jane,
17 not with respect to subpoenaing Brian; correct?

18 MS. MENNINGER: It could be with respect to either

19 one. We already have Brian under subpoena, your Honor. With
20 respect to the calling of Jane, I would like to know that
al before we make a decision.
22 THE COURT: I did ask yesterday if you had prevailed
23 on your motion not to exclude Brian, would you subpoena him and
24 you said no. I realize you didn't prevail nor did you -- not
25 prevail, the government withdrew him, but is your position now
