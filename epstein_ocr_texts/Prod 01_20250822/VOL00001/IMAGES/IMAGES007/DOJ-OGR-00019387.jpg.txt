any legal objections to the Government’s evidence before Judge Nathan, who is
presiding over the criminal case. If Maxwell is dissatisfied with Judge Nathan’s

attempt to circumvent Judge Nathan’s Order without litigating the merits of this
appeal. That Order, which is the only ruling on appeal in this case, prohibits
Maxwell from using certain criminal discovery materials in civil litigation. If this
Court were to consolidate the criminal and civil appeals, the record on appeal in
both cases would be merged, the lines between the two cases would be blurred in
the manner Maxwell seeks, and the Court would effectively reverse Judge
Nathan’s Order and grant Maxwell the relief she seeks in this appeal — all without
requiring Maxwell to show that Judge Nathan actually abused her discretion by
denying Maxwell’s motion to modify the Protective Order.” Indeed, Maxwell’s
motion to consolidate does not in any way suggest that there will be anything left

appeal would become part of the record in the civil appeal. The Government is
concermed that consolidating these matters would entail disseminating sensitive,
sealed documents in a criminal case to civil litigants.
