Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page11 of 23
ES A Ms. Maxwell’s
deposition testimony in the civil case provides the substantive basis for two of the
six charges she faces. App. 27-29.

As explained in Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief, Doc. 60, her motion to
consolidate, Doc. 17, and the reply in support, Doc. 54, ii
ee
For example, in balancing the qualified First Amendment presumption of access (a
presumption that is significantly less as applied to the deposition material than the
summary judgment material this Court released in Brown v. Maxwell), Judge Preska
and this Court must evaluate countervailing considerations including, most
prominently, Ms. Maxwell’s reliance on the civil protective order. Giuffre v.
Maxwell, No. 20-2413, Doc. 40, pp 21-23.
ee Vis. Giuffre’s attorneys repeatedly used the existence of the
civil protective order to deflect Ms. Maxwell’s arguments about her right to
privacy, her right against self-incrimination, and her concern that Ms. Giuffre
would use documents in the civil action to support a criminal investigation. Guffre
vy. Maxwell, No. 20-2413, Doc. 111, p 20. Ms. Maxwell then did not invoke her Fifth
Amendment right to remain silent and instead testified at two depositions. Jd.
