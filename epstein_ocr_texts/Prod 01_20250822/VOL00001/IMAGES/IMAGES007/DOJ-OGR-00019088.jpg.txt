LC8Cmax7 Rodgers â€”- cross

1 Q. Shelly Lewis was someone Epstein was romantically involved

2 with in 2002; is that right?

3 A. Yes.

4 QO. And she had a British accent, didn't she?

5 A. Yes.

6 Q. In fact, Epstein flew around with a lot of women who had

7 foreign accents, didn't he?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. All right. Now, one quick question, you mentioned on your
10 direct that Ghislaine had a share, I think, in a charter plane
11 that she could use; is that right?

12 A. Yes.
13 Q. That's like sharing a plane, you can't use it anytime you
14 want; right?
15 A. You have to request it. It's not there at your beckon
16 call.
17 Q. Because other people use that same plane; right?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. But isn't it true that Ghislaine only had that share in the
20 1990s; right?
21 A. I'm not sure how many years she had it. She didn't have it
22 forever, that's for sure.
23 Q. So, for example, in the 2000s, if she wanted to fly not on
24 Jeffrey Epstein's plane, she'd have to fly commercial, not on
25 that share of a jet?
