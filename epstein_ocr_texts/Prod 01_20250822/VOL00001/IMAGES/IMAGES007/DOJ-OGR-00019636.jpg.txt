modify a protective order entered in a criminal case);
United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d 194, 211 (8rd Cir.
2007) (same).
B. Discussion

Judge Nathan did not abuse her discretion when
entering the challenged Order. In reaching her deci-
sion, Judge Nathan applied the correct legal standard,
evaluated Maxwell’s argument that she needed to dis-
close certain criminal discovery materials to the rele-
vant judicial officers to “ensure the fair adjudication of
issues being litigated in those civil matter,” found that
Maxwell’s proffered reasons for the request were
“vague, speculative, and conclusory,” and concluded
that Maxwell’s arguments “plainly fail to establish
good cause.” (A. 101). At no point did Judge Nathan
fail to apply established law, and it cannot be said that
her careful review of the parties’ arguments was not
within the bounds of permissible discretion.

First, Maxwell still fails to articulate any legal ba-
sis for the use of discovery material received from the
Government in a criminal case to litigate a separate
civil case. Maxwell expressly consented to the entry of
a Protective Order prohibiting her from using criminal
discovery materials in civil litigation.7 In her motion
to modify that Protective Order, Maxwell cited no legal
authority for the use of criminal discovery in civil liti-
gation. Her appeal points to no such authority, and she

7 Maxwell did so knowing that the Government
had charged her with perjury in connection with civil
cases.
