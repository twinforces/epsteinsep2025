Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page12 of 24

14. When applying the collateral-order doctrine, the Supreme Court
has “generally denied review of pretrial discovery orders.” Firestone Tire &
Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.S. 368, 377 (1981). This Court likewise has
consistently ruled that protective orders regulating the use of documents exchanged
by the parties during a criminal case are not subject to interlocutory appeal. See,
e.g., United States v. Caparros, 800 F.2d 23, 24 (2d Cir. 1986) (“We hold that this
collateral protective order is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1291... .”); United

[protective] order imposed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of materials
exchanged in the course of pending litigation, it is not subject to appeal.’’); see also
HL. Hayden Co. of N.Y. v. Siemens Medical Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 90 (2d Cir.
1986) (“The district court’s denial of modification [of a protective order] does not
fall within the ‘collateral order’ doctrine of Cohen.”). Because “a litigant does not
have ‘an unrestrained right to disseminate information that has been obtained
through pretrial discovery,’” such protective orders do not amount to an
impermissible prior restraint under the First Amendment. Caparros, 800 F.2d at
25 (quoting Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 31 (1984)). Even where a
litigant raises a colorable argument that a protective order violates a litigant’s right
to release documents outside of criminal litigation, “adjudication of any such right
can await final judgment on the underlying charges” because the “purported right
