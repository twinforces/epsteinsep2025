éxamplé would be, His, 3500 material 415 ‘that shé said that.

Ms. Maxwell brought girls. There was. ‘no testimony to that.

Theré was testimony that ‘there were women, but not

that she brought them, There was. testimony of her presence,

but not necessarily that she told 'the grotip thdt everything

That's the kind of statements that are in ‘the 3500
material. And I have addresised. this with Ms. Moe. We're rot
entirély Sure How it will come out, but it isn't a prior
consistent statement. There is a prior conversation or

discussion, but the statements themselves. aré not consistent.

THE COURT: Ms. Moe.

MS. MOE: Your Hénor, I believe the Gourt's ruling on
this is that we would evaluate the statements as they come out
through the witness. And as a preview, after conferring with

recalls Jane tellang him. Again, it's always difficult to.

prediét the precise testimony of a lay witness, but my general
expectation is that he would explain that. in conversations with

Jane, she. explained that there was a@ worian at. the house who

made her feel comfortable; that sometimes there was that, woman,

at the house, sometimes there were girls; and so that. madé her
feel comfortable in the house.
I don't expect that the testimony would go beyond
