LC1Qmax6 Jane â€”- Redirect

1 example would be, his 3500 material is that she said that

2 Ms. Maxwell brought girls. There was no testimony to that.

3 There was testimony that there were women, but not

4 that she brought them. There was testimony of her presence,

5 but not necessarily that she told the group that everything

6 would be okay.

7 That's the kind of statements that are in the 3500

8 material. And I have addressed this with Ms. Moe. We're not

9 entirely sure how it will come out, but it isn't a prior

10 consistent statement. There is a prior conversation or

11 discussion, but the statements themselves are not consistent.
12 THE COURT: Ms. Moe.

13 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I believe the Court's ruling on
14 this is that we would evaluate the statements as they come out
15 through the witness. And as a preview, after conferring with
16 Ms. Sternheim on this issue, we did confer with Matt and asked
17 him about what he recalls, specifically about the woman he

18 recalls Jane telling him. Again, it's always difficult to

19 predict the precise testimony of a lay witness, but my general
20 expectation is that he would explain that in conversations with
al Jane, she explained that there was a woman at the house who
22 made her feel comfortable; that sometimes there was that woman
23 at the house, sometimes there were girls; and so that made her
24 feel comfortable in the house.
25 I don't expect that the testimony would go beyond
