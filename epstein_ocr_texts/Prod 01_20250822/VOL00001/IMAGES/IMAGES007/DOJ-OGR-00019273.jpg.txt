MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine.Maxwell. Both parties have

asked for the: Court to enter a protective order. While: they. agree:on most:of'the
language, two areas.of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell secks language:
allowing her to-publicly reference alleged. victims or withessés who have spoken. on
Ms. Maxwell.
or Jeffrey Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell secks language. restricting: potential
Goverhment withiesses and their counsel, front using discove ery‘materials for-any

‘purpose other'than ‘preparing for the. criminal trial inthis ‘action. The: Government has
‘proposed contrary’ language. on: both.ofthese: issues. For the following reasons, the

Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order Under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "Lat anytime the court-may; ‘for good. cause, deny,

‘restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or:grant:other appropriate relief.” "The good

cause: standard.” ‘requires’ courts to balance several interests, including” whether
dissemination of the discovery. matcrials-inflicts hazard:to others... whether the

‘imposition, of; the protective order would prejudice the defendant," and “the public's
‘interest in'the information.” United. States v,

mith, 985: F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D:N.Y. 2013). The party secking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing

good cause. Cf: Gainbale’v. ‘Deiitsche Bank’ AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142.(2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that, the Government has met. ‘its burden, of showing, good-cause.
‘with regard to restricting the ability“of.Ms. Maxwell.to publicly:reference valleged,

victims and-witnesses other than.those who have: publicly identified themselves in this
litigation. AS a general matters, itei8, undisputed that there isa strong and Specific

‘interest in‘protecting the' priv acy'of alleged:victims and; witnesses in this. case that

supports restricting the: disclosure of their identities: Dkt. No..29:at 3 (acknowledging

that as a baseline the: protective order'should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense

counsel, and others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the: identity
of any.alleged-victim, or’potential witness referenced.in, . the discovery materials"); see
also United States v: C ‘orley,'No. 13=cr=48,, 201.6 Uz S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15,2016). The Defense argues this interest:is significantly diminished
for individuals.who have spoken on the public record about.Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey

‘Epstein, because they‘have:voluntarily“chosen to ‘identify themselv es: But not.all.

accusations: ‘or r public statements are’ equal. Deciding to participate: in, or contribute toa

public statement ‘relating | to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since’ stich a

statement might. have occurred.decades ago and-have:no relevance to the: charges 4 ‘in,

this case. These individuals still maintain a: significant privacy interest that must: be

safeguarded. The: exception the. Defense secks:i§ too broad and tisks under ‘Mining the

protections of the priv acy’ of witnesses and alleged victims that.is required by ; law. In.

contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly

‘reference individuals who have spoken by: ‘name:on-the record in this case. It.also

allows the Defense to "teferéne[e] the identities of:individuals they believe;may’ be

‘relevant.. . to: Potential.Defense: Witnesses and their counsel. during the: course of the:

investigation.and preparation of the defense case. at trial." Dkt. No. 33-1, 5. This

proposal adéquately balances the-interests at stake: And as the Governinient's, letter
‘notes, se¢ Dkt. No. 33 at.4, to the extent that the Defense needs an: exception to the
‘protective order fora specific i investigative purpose, they can make applications to the

Court on a case-by-case basis. Second, restrictions ‘on:the ability of potential
Witnesses and ‘their counsel, to use discovery materials. for purposes. other than

Preparing for trial in,this case are unwarranted. ‘The request appears unprecedented.

despite the: fact that thereshave been many high= ‘profile ‘criminal matters that had

‘related, civil litigation. The Government labors-under many restrictions including Rule

6(¢) of the. Federal. Rules of Criminal Procedure, the-Privacy Act of 1974, and. other:
