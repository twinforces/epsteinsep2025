1 request as to timing of giving the instruction.

2 So the instruction is, you'll hear testimony from the
3 next witness about interactions that she says she had with the
4 defendant and Mr. Epstein. I instruct you that because the

5 witness -- I instruct you that because -- sorry. Let me start
6 over.

7 You'll hear testimony from the next witness about

8 interactions that she said she had with the defendant and

9 Mr. Epstein. I instruct you that because the witness was over
10 the relevant age of consent at the relevant time period, any
11 sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not,

12 quote, illegal sexual activity, end quote, as the government
13 has charged in the indictment. For that reason, I have

14 directed the government not to ask this witness the details of
15 any sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein.

16 I instruct you that this witness is not a victim of
17 the crimes charged in the indictment. To the extent you

18 conclude that her testimony is relevant to the issues before
19 you, you may consider it. However, you may not convict the
20 defendant on the basis of the testimony regarding the sexual
21 conduct between this witness and Mr. Epstein, nor may you
22 consider this testimony as any kind of reflection on
23 Mr. Epstein's or Ms. Maxwell character or propensity to commit
24 any of the crimes charged in the indictment.
25 Mr. Rohrbach.
