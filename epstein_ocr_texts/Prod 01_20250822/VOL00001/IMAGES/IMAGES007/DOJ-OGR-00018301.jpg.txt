1 Q. But there is no way for the videos or the photographs we

2 saw to show that they were there any day prior to October 20th,
3 2005; isn't that right?

4 A. I just don't know how to answer that.

5 Q. Okay.

6 A. That's one of the best questions I've had in 55 years. If
7 I do find out, I'll let you know.

8 Q. Then I'll ask a few more hopefully smart questions.

9 The same thing with the artwork that we saw in the

10 videos and the photographs. The videos and the photographs

11 show what artwork was in that house on October 20th of 2005;

12 yes?

13 A. True.

14 Q. But it would have no way of showing what artwork was there
15 on any day prior to October 20th, 2005?

16 A. I don't see how that would be possible.

17 Q. Itll just ask also about the items in the house apart from
18 the artwork and the photographs, same question. There is no
19 way that the video or the photographs could show what items
20 were in the house prior to that day?
21 A. No, sir, I don't believe science has gotten that far.
22 Q. So bottom line is, we have no idea from what we looked at
23 in your testimony what the house looked like prior to October
24 20th of 2005?
25 A. I certainly don't.
