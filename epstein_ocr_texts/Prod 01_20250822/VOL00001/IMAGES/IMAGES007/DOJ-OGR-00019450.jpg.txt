Plumbers and Pipefitiers Nat. Pension, Fund, 886 F. Supp. at.1139.. ‘The party: sceking the stay’
“bears the burden of establishing its :nieed,” Lotiis Viton Malletic?, 676 F.3d at 97 (internal
quotation.marks and citation omitted), and this burden.may be met where, on.balance, ‘the
relevant factors suggest that proceeding with. the civil action, will, likely:result in/undue prejudice
tothe. defendant, see id. (noting that “absent a showing of undue:prejudice . . . there is, no reason
why’ [a] plaintiff should be delayed in. its ‘efforts to diligently: procced to. sustain, its claim”
(internal quotation marks, altcration, and. citation omitted)).

B. The Relevant Factors Weigh in Favor of Granting a Stay of This Action.

In this instance, as discussed below, the relevant factors support Maxell’s application for
a stay.

1. Overlap Between the Civil and Criminal Cases

“The strongest case for granting a stay is where'a,party under criminal indictment.is
required.to defend. a civil.proceeding involving the same matter.” Volmar Distributors, 152
E.R:D, at 39 (emphasis added) (citations omitted); accord In-re: Worldcom, 2002 WL 31729501,
at *5. Denying a stay where there is significant. factual overlap: between the civil and criminal
cases may “undermine a.defendant’s Fifth Amendment privilege against sclf-incrimination . ..
expand, the rights of criminal, discovery beyond the limits of Rule ‘16(b) of the Federal Rules of
Criminal Procedure, expose the basis of the: défense to'the prosecution in advance of trial, or
otherwise prejudice the case.” Volmar Distributors, 152.F.R.D. at.39.(citations omitted); see also
Johnson v. New York City. Police Dep’t, No. 0.1ev6570 (RCC) (JCF), 2003: WL 21664882, at *2:
(SDNY. July 16, 2003).

As a threshold matter, this Court finds that, in this instance, there is significant factual

overlap between this civil case and the pending criminal case. For example,.as Maxwell points,
