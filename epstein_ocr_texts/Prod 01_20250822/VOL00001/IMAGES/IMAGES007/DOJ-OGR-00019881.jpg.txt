detention. Importantly, :in contrast with the bail position. it took with Epstein, the government
does not and, cannot assert:that:Ms. Maxwell presents.a, danger to'the community under Section

Ms. .Maxwell’s Response. The:Court should. cxercise its discretion to grant bail to ‘Ms.
‘Maxwell, on. the strict: conditions ‘proposed. below (or'as modified. by. the !Court), for two
‘compelling reasons.

this Court, has noted, the COVID-19 pandemic represents an. unprecedented. health:risk. to.
incarcerated :individuals, and COVID-19-related restrictions on attorney communications with.
pretrial, detainees significantly impair.a,defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,
‘under thése Circumstances, if.Ms. Maxwell continues to be, detained, her health:will be at serious
risk and she will not’be able to reccive a fair trial. (See infra: Section I, pages 5 to 9).

Second, the:Court should grant bail because the government. has not met its burden/under
the Bail-Reform Act and:controlling case law. The presumption relied on. by the government

the United States-until:the recent media. frenzy about this case forced. her'to wind it down to
protect her professional colleagues, and:their organizations; and she has very‘close ties with,
‘family members. and fricnds in. New York and the rest of the, country. Nor docs her conduct
indicate 'that she is a.flight risk: 'she has no prior criminal record; has spent ycars:contesting civil,
litigation arising from, hcr supposed fies to Epstein; and.has remained ‘in. the. United States, from.
the time of Epstein’s.arrest until the present,’with her counsel in regular contact withthe:

government. ‘She did not flee, but-rather left.the public’ eye, for the entirely. understandable
