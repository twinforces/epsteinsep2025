Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 749 Filed 08/10/22 Page 129 of 236 1033
LC3KMAX4 Parkinson â€”- Direct

1 containing a depiction of a very young minor. You should not

2 infer from this photo that Mr. Epstein had a sexual attraction
3 to minors as young as the girl depicted in this photo. You

4 also may not consider this evidence as any kind of reflection

5 on Ms. Maxwell's character or propensity to commit any of the

6 crimes charged in the indictment. However, to the extent you

7 conclude that the evidence is relevant to the issues before

8 you, you can consider it."

9 THE COURT: Okay. And the defense's request is not to
10 give it because you don't want to highlight the photo that

11 otherwise might be just in passing and so, rather, your request
12 is not to give the instruction?

13 MR. EVERDELL: That's correct, your Honor.

14 THE COURT: Okay.

15 What else?

16 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I just wanted to note that,

17 after conferring, the parties have agreed to offer a redacted
18 version of Government Exhibit 296, which is the video. The

19 portion we've agreed to redact is a portion at the beginning
20 where Detective Recarey reads aloud the entire search warrant
al for several minutes. So we have redacted that from the version
22 that we will ask be accepted into evidence and that we will
23 actually play for the jury.
24 THE COURT: Okay.
25 What else?
