In particular, the Defense Letter secks this Court’s authorization to: use materials relating:
to applications the Government;made secking the:modification of certain protective orders in other
judicial proceedings. By'way of background, the Government-sought-such modifications, to:permit.
compliancewith criminal grand jury subpoenas (the “Subpoenas”). Those: Subpoenas were issued,
to.a.certain recipient (the “Recipient” ’) after the Government.opened.a grand jury investigation. ‘into
Jeffrey Epstein and. his possible co- conspirators. For obvious reasons and. in. ‘keeping, ‘with its
‘standard ‘practice, the Government did ‘not notify the defendant or her counsel that. it had ‘issued.
the Subpoenas. In response to receiving the Subpoenas, the Recipient. advised. the Government.
that it believed that certain cxistitig protective orders precluded. full complianéc. Accordingly; 'in
or about-February.20119, the Government applied et parte arid under seal:to cach relevant court to
request modification of the respective protective orders to 0 permit: compliance: with the Subpoenas.
that the ‘Government "share its order—and only “that order, which itself prohibited further
disscmination=to ‘the Recipient.” ‘Subsequently, the second court. (“Court-2”) denicd the
Government’s application. Because the relevant grand jury investigation remains, ongoing, both.
‘Court-1. and Court-2 have ordered that the: filings regarding the Subpocnas: remain under seal,
‘execpt that:both have expressly’ permitted the Government.to produce’ those filings to:the:defendant:
as part. of its discovery obligations in this criminal,case. The Defense Letter now. seeks to ‘use
‘those discovery: materials in. the; Civil Cases.

At base, the defendant’s application fundamentally misapprchends the nature and process
‘of criminal proceedings, and it further reflects an. inappropriate effort to blur'the lines between, the
criminal, discovery process and civil. litigation., To'be clear: the purpose of ‘criminal discovery’ is
‘to enable the defendant to defend herself in the. criminal action, not to provide her with a trove of
materials she can mine to her advantage in civil discovery. Her ‘motion. is nothing more than an
effort to evade the directives of the protective order entered. by this Court just three wecks.ago. It
should. be denied for. multiple reasons.

First, and as the defendant. concedes, the protective order in this case expressly ‘provides
that any and all discovery material produced to ‘the defendant, by the Government, regardless of
designation, “[s]hall. be ‘used. by: the Defendant or her Defense: Counsel solely for purposcs of the
‘defense of this criminal action, and. not for-any civil proceeding or any purpose other ‘than the
defense of this action.” Protective Order44 1(a), 10(a), 14(a) (emphasis added) (Dkt. 36). Indeed,
the defendant:included that:same’provision, word-for-word, in her own, proposed, protective order.
This was ‘not a provision about which. the defendant arid the Government disagreed. See
Defendants Proposed Protective Order | I(ay (Dkt. 29-1). “Yet less than, a month later, the
defendant. is asking the Court ‘to sanction her effort to utilize: materials produced. ‘by: the

*In-the Defense Letter, the defendant argues that the Government “must: have given.a copy of the
sealed. order” to the Recipient, which defense counscl ‘suggests is inconsistent with the
Government’s ‘statement that.it rarely provides discovery material to third partics.. The defendant’s
suggestion. is ‘patently.incorrect. The relevant order was signed ‘in April, 2019.and was issued. for
the purpose of being, provided. to ‘the Recipient. Indeed the order contained an. explicit provision.
that it could be transmitted to the Recipient. Accordingly, the order was conveycd to the Recipient
well. over a-ycar before it became “discovery” in this criminal case.
