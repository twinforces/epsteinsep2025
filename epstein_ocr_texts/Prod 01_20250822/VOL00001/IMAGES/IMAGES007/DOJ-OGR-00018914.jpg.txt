LC8VMAX2 Shawn â€” direct

1 MS. MOE: Your Honor, with respect to the disclosure
2 question, I just wanted to note, the issue for disclosure was
3 who the government would be arguing at trial were the victims
4 here. We don't intend to argue at closing that there's an

a additional victim Amanda. This is being offered as direct

6 evidence as corroborative testimony of the account of the

7 victims here.

8 THE COURT: Well, direct evidence only if you're

9 suggesting she's a victim of the conspiracy. So that would
10 violate that order. And it's corroborative only if the age
11 matches up.

12 MS. MOE: Your Honor, our view is that it's direct
13 evidence because it corroborates her account of who she was
14 bringing.

15 THE COURT: Then what's the purpose of the -- sorry.
16 What's the purpose of the age?

17 The testimony yesterday was she believes she was 17.
18 Sustained.
