The Supreme Court has made:clear that the collat-
eral ordér exception should be “interpreted . . ..with the
utmost strictness.in:criminal cases.” Midland Asphalt
Corp. 0. United: States, 489 U.S. 794, 799 (1989); accord:
United States v. Robinson, 473 F.3d 487, 490 (2d Cir.
2007). In over 70 years since Cohen was decided, de-
spite “numerous opportunities” to expand the doctrine,
Midland.Asphalt, 489 U.S. at 799, the Supreme Court.
has identified only four types of pretrial orders in crim-
inal cases as satisfying the collateral-order doctrine:
an order denying:a, bond, see Stack v. Boyle, 342 U.S. 1
(1951); an order denying a motion.to'dismiss'on Double.
Jeopardy grounds; see Abney v. United States, 431 U.S.
651 (1977); an order denying a. motion to dismiss under
the Speech or Debate Clause, see Helstoski v.. Meanor.,
442 U.S. 500 (1979); and an order permitting the
forced administration of antipsychotic drugs ‘to render
a defendant competent, for trial, see Sell v. United
States, 539 U.S. 166 (2003). In contrast, the circum-
stances in which the Supreme Court has “refused, to
permit interlocutory appeals” in criminal cases have
been “far more numerous.” Midland Asphalt, 489 U.S.
at 799.

As to the third Van Cauwwenberghe criterion, “[a]n
order is effectively unreviewable where the order at is-
sue involves an asserted right. the legal and practical
value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindi-
cated before trial.” United States v. Punn, 737 F.3d.1,
5 (2d Cir. 2013). “The justification for immediate ap-
peal must ... be sufficiently strong to’ overcome the
usual. benefits of deferring appeal until litigation con-
cludes.” Mohawk Indus., Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.S.
100, 107 (2009). A ruling that.is bur densome toa party
