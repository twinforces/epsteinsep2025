Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
The Defense has moved for an order “prohibiting the Government, its agents and counsel
for witnesses from making extrajudicial statements concerning this case.” Dkt. No. 27 at 1.
The Court firmly expects that counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to
ensure compliance with this Court’s local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the
rules of professional responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe
that further action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant’s right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant’s motion without prejudice. But the Court
warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses that going forward it
will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of violations of any relevant rules. The
Court will ensure strict compliance with those rules and will ensure that the Defendant’s right to
a fair trial will be safeguarded.
SO ORDERED.
