domestically and abroad; (3) her finances are completely opaque, as her memorandum pointedly
declines to provide the Court with information about her financial resources; and (4) she appears
to be skilled at living in hiding. These are glaring red flags, even before the Court considers the
gravity of the charges in this case and the serious penalties the defendant faces if convicted at trial.

Instead of attempting to address the risks of releasing a defendant with apparent access to
extraordinary financial resources, who has the ability to live beyond the reach of extradition in
France, and who has already demonstrated a willingness and ability to live in hiding, the defendant
instead proposes a bail package that amounts to little more than an unsecured bond. Among other
things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the sole security a
property that is beyond the territory and judicial reach of the United States, and which therefore is
of no value as collateral. She proposes six unidentified co-signers, an unknown number of whom
even reside in the United States, and none of whose assets are identified. The Court and the
Government have no information whatsoever regarding whether these co-signers would be able to
able to pay the proposed $5 million bond should the defendant flee — or if, of equal concern, the
co-signers are themselves so wealthy that it would be no financial burden whatsoever to do so.
The defendant does not identify what residence she proposes to live at in the Southern District of
New York, nor does she identify any meaningful ties to the area. And most importantly, the
defendant’s memorandum provides the Court with no information whatsoever about her own
finances or her access to the wealth of others, declining to provide the Court the very information
that would inform any decision about whether a bond is even meaningful to the defendant — and
which the Government submits would reveal the defendant’s financial means to flee and live
comfortably abroad for the rest of her life.
