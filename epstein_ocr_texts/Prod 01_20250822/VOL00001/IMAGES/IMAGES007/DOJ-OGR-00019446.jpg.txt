Case C2@-A0-00484-DGHUDER ODoce md, FICE DL1 Hage4Payjeds of 13
2020, Maxwell filed the letter motion that is now before this Court, requesting a stay of this
action until the conclusion of her pending criminal case. (See 8/19/20 Menninger Ltr.) In her
motion, Maxwell set out the factors relevant to a stay analysis, and argued that not only her own
interest, but also the interests of the courts, the public, and the other parties would be best served
by the requested stay. (See generally id.)

On August 27, 2020, the Co-Executors submitted a letter consenting to the entry of a stay
and joining in Maxwell’s request that the stay apply to the entire proceeding. (See Letter to the
Court from Bennet J. Moskowitz, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2020 (“8/27/20 Moskowitz Ltr.”)

(Dkt. 77).) The Co-Executors principally argued that this Court should not consider a partial stay
of this case (7.e., a stay that would apply solely as to Plaintiffs claims against Maxwell), as a
partial stay would unduly prejudice the Co-Executors’ ability to defend against Plaintiff's claims
and would add unnecessary cost to the litigation. (See id., at 1-2.) The Co-Executors also
pointed out that, if this matter were stayed, Plaintiff would still be able to pursue a resolution of
her claims through the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Compensation Program’’)
that has been independently instituted, and that has led numerous other plaintiffs in similar cases
before the Court to seek voluntary stays of their lawsuits. (See id., at 2-3.)

By letter dated August 27, 2020, Plaintiff vigorously opposed the requested stay, arguing
that the relevant factors weigh against granting the requested relief. (See generally Letter to the
Court from Robert Glassman, Esq., dated Aug. 27, 2020 (“8/27/20 Glassman Ltr.”) (Dkt. 78).)
In her opposition, Plaintiff contended, inter alia, that Maxwell’s detention should pose no real
impediment to her defense of this action, suggesting that Maxwell, who filed her motion for a
stay only after she had first sought discovery from Plaintiff in this case, “appear[ed] to want to
gain an unfair advantage by acquiring as much information as she [could] about Plaintiff without
