LC2VMAX6 Alessi â€” Direct

1 MS. COMEY: No, your Honor. TI think our position is

2 clear that we think it should come in at this time, but

3 understood.

4 MR. PAGLIUCA: I think that's entirely appropriate. I
a guess the question is are you conditionally admitting it or

6 not.

7 THE COURT: The reason I ask, do you need -- is there
8 more to do with it now or can we simply reserve and move on

9 till the other witness?

10 MS. COMEY: I think it's fine to reserve, your Honor.
11 THE COURT: Okay. So if that's what I do, I won't

12 conditionally admit and we'll take it from there.

13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Okay.

14 THE COURT: Anything to take up before we bring the

15 witness back?

16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Not from me, your Honor.

17 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I apologize if I was not

18 clear, but we do want to admit this through this witness. And
19 I do have questions for him about this exhibit, so we are
20 seeking to admit it. I apologize. My colleagues let me know
2l that I was not clear.
22 THE COURT: It wasn't that you weren't clear. That's
23 an opposite answer of the one you just gave.
24 MS. COMEY: I apologize, your Honor.
25 I misunderstood the question.
