1 A. Yes.

2 Q. And do you see the date on the upper right-hand corner?

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. And that would have been an application for the next year,
5 for the next summer, is that fair?

6 A. Yes.

7 Q. All right.

8 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, at this time I'm moving

9 for the admission of J-4, which I previously discussed with the
10 government.

11 MS. MOE: No objection, your Honor. We would just ask
12 that it be under seal and that any identifying information not
13 be read into the record.

14 THE COURT: Okay. J-4 is admitted. It's admitted

15 under seal consistent with my ruling that this witness may

16 testify under pseudonym. And if any reference -- if any

17 reading of the document occurs, everyone is admonished not to
18 use the identifying information.

19 (Defendant's Exhibit J-4 received in evidence)
20 BY MS. MENNINGER:
21 Q. So if you need to turn on the second page, I think it has
22 your signature, just for reference sake. Do you see that?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. Do you believe this is your application?
25 A. Yes.
