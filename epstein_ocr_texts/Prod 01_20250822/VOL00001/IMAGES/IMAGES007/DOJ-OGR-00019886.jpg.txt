Stephens, Ms. Maxwell’s inability:to mect-with her attorneys while this policy is in. effect
constitutcs.a' “compelling reason” requiring ‘her release. Siephens, 2020 WL 1295155 at *3.°
Even speaking by phone with.Ms. Maxwell presents daunting challenges duc 'to, COVID-
19-related protocols requiring at: least: 72 hours’ notice to schedule:a call, unless it is urgent, in,
‘which case counsel can cmail a request: to the MDC. As counsel learned. this past weck,
however, even:an urgent call request.docs not mean the:call will take place in the:time required.
At approximately 5:30 p.m. on July 6, 2020, the Court ordered-us to confer'with Ms. Maxwell
about waiving her physical preserice at the arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing; and.
ordered counsel. for both sides to jointly:report back by 9:00. p:m. that-night with.a proposed date
and time for'these proceedings. We promptly emailed the MDC to request 'an-urgent call,
making, specifie reference to, the Court’s Order, but’were not connected with.Ms. Maxwell until
9:00 p.m. There will no: doubt’be other orders ofthe Court'with no guarantees we will be able to.
reach.our client: in time if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past-weck, Ms. Maxwell. has
not been able to physically review'documents and. has had limited.access to ‘writing-materials.
The-prohibition on in-person visits mcans we must read to: her any documents requiring her
review, and shé has virtually no ability’to take notes. The age of the allégations in. this case

‘compound these:problems. Under the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell cannot review
