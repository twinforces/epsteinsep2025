‘in, thas case. As, ‘the chief judge of the district Has.
recognized in order number ZOMCL76, COVID-19. remains a national
emergency that. réStricts normal operations of ‘the courts.
Cendueting this proceeding in person is not safely feasible.

Second, the measures, taken by the cotirt are no broadér

than necessary to address. the challenges posed by the pandemic.
Although the number of seats im the jury assémbly room is.
limited to 60, it is necessary to do so fer public and
Courthousé staff safety and is tldésely equivalent to the rnuriber
ef people who would, be able to. watch an in-count, proceeding An,
a regular=sizéd coéurtroom. THe number of people who will be
able to hear the live audio of this proceeding far exceeds

access undér normal in=person Circunistances.

It

astly, giyen, the safety and technology limitations,

there are no reasénable alternatives to the measures the Gourt

has taken.

Accordingly, the access provided is fully in accoérd
with the First. and Sixth Amendment public ‘trial rights.

With those preliminary matters out of the way,
counsel, I propose we turn, to ‘the arraignment.

Ms; Moé, am I correct that this is an arraignment on
the Sl superseding indictment?

MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor.

THE COURT: Cah you explain what, the difference is
between the Sl and the original indictment?
