LC1VMAX3 Jane -— cross

1 attorney's letter to my law firm in which he's demanding that

8 MS. MENNINGER: Well, your Honor, that leads to a

9 potential scenario with her attorney being a witness. But I

10 think we would cross that bridge on another day.

11 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

12 The question remains about her knowledge. And again,
13 if we're refreshing this witness's recollection with a document
14 she hasn't seen, I just want to make sure that the question is
15 very precisely framed. Because there have been a number of

16 times already this morning where the witness has been asked to
17 just read the document and has given answers like, I don't

18 know, but I guess that's what this says, which is beyond the

19 scope of refreshing a recollection. So I just want to ensure
20 we're not asking this witness to read into the record hearsay
21 statements of her attorney which she doesn't have knowledge.
22 THE COURT: If she says, I don't know, you can try to
23 refresh her recollection. The question is, Does this refresh
24 your recollection? If the answer is no, we move on. And then
25 you do —-—
