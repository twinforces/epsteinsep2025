1 overrule the objection with a Limiting instruction.

2 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I understand the Court's

i) ruling. If I can make one other point, which is the fact that

4 Juan Alessi has sort of testified about this, but he left in

5 2002 according to his own testimony. This walk-through and

6 these photographs were taken in 2005, which are three years

7 later. So the government is -- he didn't say that that photo

8 was there.

9 So I mean the government is making the argument that
10 these important people may have seen these photographs or the
11 fact the photograph was there contradicts the defense argument
12 that the people in Epstein's orbit would have known about this,
13 including Ms. Maxwell, but we actually don't have any testimony
14 that the photo was on the wall at the time that's relevant to
15 this case.

16 THE COURT: We have testimony of Jane regarding art
17 and photographs.
18 MR. EVERDELL: Not this photo, your Honor. They
19 didn't go through with Jane specific photographs, do you recall
20 this one, do you recall that one, was that on the wall, was
21 this on the wall. She gave very, very general descriptions of
22 her recollection of certain residences, not particular
23 artworks, not particular photographs.
24 So I don't think it's fair, on the record we have, to
25 say that this photograph being on the wall in 2005 â€” mind you,
