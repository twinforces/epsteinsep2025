LC8Cmax3 Hesse — direct

1 hearsay objection. Here, this witness —--

2 THE COURT: Just to be specific, there is not an

3 objection to the ones that she personally took. Can you

4 identify those, of the numbers.

S MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. I just want to doublecheck
6 the exhibits. I want to doublecheck them in the binder. I

7 think they are 1B, 2C, 3P, and 3X. I just want to doublecheck
8 that I have that right.

9 THE COURT: The 2 series is already in?

10 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

11 THE COURT: So of the ones that you're offering?

12 MS. MOE: 1B, 3P, and 3X.

13 Just so I understand the issue, because it seems to

14 now be overlapping, I'm not sure why there would be a business
15 records objection to records other than those that this

16 employee took. I'm not sure if that's an authentication

17 question --

18 THE COURT: No. I think, as I understand it, we need
19 a custodian who indicates the foundation for the exception.
20 The record was made at or near the time by or from information
21 transmitted by someone with knowledge. The record was kept in
22 the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business,
23 organization, occupation, or calling, whether or not for
24 profit. Making your record was a regular practice of that
25 activity.
