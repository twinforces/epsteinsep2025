Robertson release in September of last year, it believed that he would only remain in pretrial
detention for three additional months until a December 7, 2020 trial date. Doc. 194. As bad as
the pandemic had been to that point, the Court did not expect the federal judiciary to remain in a
state of near total suspension for another six months, requiring the trial to be continued twice more
to the current April 5, 2021 trial date. Second, when the Court denied Mr. Robertson release last
September, it was under the impression that he would be able to meet with his attorneys in person
in conference rooms at the Albuquerque courthouse, mitigating the Court’s concerns about the
defense team’s ability to effectively prepare for trial. See supra at 4. The Court’s impression on
that point turned out to be incorrect: due to concerns about inmates meeting with attorneys and
then bringing COVID-19 back into the jails, the idea of unrestricted attorney-client meetings at
the Albuquerque courthouse was ultimately rejected. Third, the Court is now able to impose
significantly stricter conditions of release because of its ability to release Mr. Robertson to La
Pasada Halfway House, an option with which it was not presented last September.

I. Mr. Robertson’s Release to La Pasada Halfway House Under Extremely Strict
and Carefully Tailored Conditions Will Reasonably Assure His Appearance and
the Safety of the Community Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e).

On the merits, the Court has thoroughly considered the parties’ arguments, the UPSO’s
recommendations, Mr. Robertson’s Form 13 Presentence Investigation Report (PSR) and the
information contained therein about his criminal history and prior performance on release, and the
applicable law. Although the government’s concerns are understandable, the Court ultimately
believes that it can reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance and the safety of the community
by releasing him to La Pasada Halfway House under a number of extremely strict and carefully
tailored conditions.

Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e), a defendant must be released pending trial unless, after a
