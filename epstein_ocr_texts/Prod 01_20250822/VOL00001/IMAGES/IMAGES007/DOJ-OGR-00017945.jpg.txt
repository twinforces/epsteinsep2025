LC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct

1 for the Court because we think that such questions would be

2 inappropriate on cross—-examination.

3 THE COURT: So beyond the scope.

4 MS. POMERANTZ: Yes, your Honor.

5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Would you like me to respond, your

6 Honor?

7 THE COURT: Please.

8 MR. PAGLIUCA: So I guess first with regard to the

9 memory issue, Dr. Rocchio talked about delayed disclosure and
10 memory impacts delayed disclosure. And it's not as simple to
11 say that there are only a couple of reasons why disclosure is
12 delayed. I mean they can say, Well, there are these factors

13 that result —-

14 THE COURT: So is the cross -- Dr. Rocchio, you talked
15 about delayed disclosure. Are there other reasons?

16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Exactly.

17 THE COURT: And then what?

18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, Like memory and things like

19 confabulation and the process of storing memories and
20 retrieving memories, the effect of alcohol on memories. Those
21 are the kinds of things that would impact memory and,
22 therefore, delayed disclosure, which I think are fair game on
23 cross-examination; psychological conditions that may impact
24 delayed disclosure is fair game on cross-examination.
25 So those are some of the topics.
