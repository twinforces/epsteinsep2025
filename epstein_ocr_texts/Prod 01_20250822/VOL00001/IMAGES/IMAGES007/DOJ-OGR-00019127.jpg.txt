1 MR. EVERDELL: Just a few procedural things from the

2 defense.

3 I believe the next witness from the government is

4 going to be Tracy Chapell from Federal Express. And I have

S some documents I can hand up to the Court. I have one exhibit
6 that I intend to introduce through Ms. Chapel which I've given
7 to the government; I can give the Court a copy. It's going to
8 be done in paper.

9 These are Federal Express invoices.

10 I'm going to offer them -- assuming they are allowed
11 to be admitted, I will offer them under temporary seal because
12 we haven't had the chance to go through and do all the

13 redactions. But we will do that as soon as we can and get the
14 Court a redacted copy so that that could be published publicly.
15 But for the moment, we'll have to do this under seal.

16 THE COURT: Is there going to be a lot of walking the
17 witness through the document?

18 MR. EVERDELL: No. Actually I'm just going to admit
19 them; no walking through, it's going to be for the jury's eyes
20 if they want to see it.
21 THE COURT: Okay. And so a redacted version for the
22 public by when?
23 MR. EVERDELL: If we could do it over the weekend,
24 because there's a decent number of records, and have them ready
25 by Monday, we could do that.
