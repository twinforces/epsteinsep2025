5) Mr. Parkinson.

6 And I do remind you, Mr. Parkinson, that you are under
7 oath.

8 THE WITNESS: Thank you, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: Go ahead.

10 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.

11 Before I resume, there was the matter of instructing
12 certain jurors to move —--

13 THE COURT: Oh, yes.

14 Members of the jury, there will be a video shown that
15 we are not showing to the gallery, so your screens were

16 adjusted a little. You can keep your screens where they are

17 but adjust your chair. So return your screens if you moved

18 them and adjust your chair so that you can see your screens, if
19 you would.
20 That's great. That will count as our exercise for the
21 day. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.
22 Go ahead, Ms. Comey.
23 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.
