(Def. Ex. S § 12). Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant.
when they first approached her. Thus, éven if the defendant. was following herprivate security’s
protocol:when she fled, she: did.so knowing that:she was disobeying, the ‘directives of FBI agents,
not:members of the media orgeneral public: Those:actions. raise the very real.concern, particularly
in. light of'the:terms of herproposed package, thatthe, defendant would prioritize, the directives of
her ‘private security’ guards ‘over ‘the directives of federal, law enforcement. Further, the act of
‘wrapping a cellphone in tin foil. has no, conceivable relevance: to concerns about the press. The
defense argues: that the defendant only took:those measures because:that.particular. phone number
had been released to the public, but. that just suggests the defendant believed that, was the only.
number of which law enforcement was aware. In. other words, there is still reason to believe, as
the Court previously found, that:in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to.cvade
not only ‘the’press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).

Lhird, thé defendant has. access 'to significant Wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the
Government expressed. doubt that the defendant’s asscts were: limited to the: approximately: $3.8
million she reported to Pretrial Services, and ‘noted that it. appeared the defendant; was lcss, than,
ccandid:with Pretrial Services:regarding the asscts in-her control. (Tr. 28-30, 72-73). The finances
outlined in the defense submission, confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has
acteéss'to far:more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial
Services (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a

person.of substantial means with vast.resources.” The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive

*As noted above, the Couit effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than.
those disclosed.to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated.offer to provide a more
fulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that-cven assuming the defense could.
provide. a clearer deseription, ofthe defendant’s assets, detention, was still warranted. (See Tr. '87).
