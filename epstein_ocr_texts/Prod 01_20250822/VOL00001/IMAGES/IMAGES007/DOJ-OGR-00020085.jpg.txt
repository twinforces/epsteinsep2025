(Def. Ex. S 412). Moreover, the FBI announced themselves as federal agents to the defendant
when they first approached her. Thus, even if the defendant was following her private security’s
protocol when she fled, she did so knowing that she was disobeying the directives of FBI agents,
not members of the media or general public. Those actions raise the very real concern, particularly
in light of the terms of her proposed package, that the defendant would prioritize the directives of
her private security guards over the directives of federal law enforcement. Further, the act of
wrapping a cellphone in tin foil has no conceivable relevance to concerns about the press. The
defense argues that the defendant only took those measures because that particular phone number
had been released to the public, but that just suggests the defendant believed that was the only
number of which law enforcement was aware. In other words, there is still reason to believe, as
the Court previously found, that in the year leading up to her arrest, the defendant sought to evade
not only the press, but also law enforcement. (Tr. 87).

Third, the defendant has access to significant wealth. At the initial bail hearing, the
Government expressed doubt that the defendant’s assets were limited to the approximately $3.8
million she reported to Pretrial Services, and noted that it appeared the defendant was less than
candid with Pretrial Services regarding the assets in her control. (Tr. 28-30, 72-73). The finances
outlined in the defense submission confirm the Government’s suspicion that the defendant has
access to far more than $3.8 million, confirm that the defendant was less than candid with Pretrial
Services (and, by extension, the Court) during her interview, and confirm that the defendant is a
person of substantial means with vast resources.” The defendant’s apparent willingness to deceive
> As noted above, the Court effectively assumed the defendant had considerably more assets than
those disclosed to Pretrial Services in rejecting defense counsel’s repeated offer to provide a more
fulsome picture of the defendant’s finances and concluding that even assuming the defense could
provide a clearer description of the defendant’s assets, detention was still warranted. (See Tr. 87).
