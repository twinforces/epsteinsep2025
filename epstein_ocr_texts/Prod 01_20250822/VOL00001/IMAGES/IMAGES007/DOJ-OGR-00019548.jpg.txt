stake. And as the Government’s letter notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense
needs an exception to the protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make
applications to the Court on a case-by-case basis.

Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their counsel to use
discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The
request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal
matters that had related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions
including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and
other policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously follow.
Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with
materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of
course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to
what materials were provided or shown to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense’s
papers explains how its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a
fair trial.

For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government’s proposed protective order,
which will be entered on the docket.

This resolves Dkt. No. 29.

SO ORDERED.
