resources; and that,those interests [would] outweigh any delay or disruption caused to the
‘resolution of this civil action.” (/d., at:‘1.).

The ‘Government is. not a‘party to'this civil action. against: Maxwell, and therefore. does not.
have: standing to.move for a'stay of this action. Thus, forthe limited purpose of secking a stay,
the:Government has sought leave fo intervene ‘in the action. (Seé 9/4/20 Gov’t Ltr., at 1.) This
Court finds it unncecssary, however, to. deal with the Government’s letter in an. “intervention”
framework, which would, require an inquiry as to whether, the Government meets the standards
set. out in. Rulé 24 ofthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Rather, given that.a motion fora stay
has already been.made by Maxwell,'this Court finds it appropriate, in connection with that
‘motion, and in,the exercise of its diseretion, to treat the Government’s submission as that of an
amicus curiae. See, @.g., South Carolina v. North Carolina, 558,U.S. 256, 288 (2010)

(Roberts, C.J., concurring in part) (“Courts often treat amicus participation. as an alternative to
intervention.”); Washington: State, Inv: Bd. v. Odebrecht. S.A.; No. 17¢6v8 118. (PGG),.20.18 WL,
6253877, at *10:n.2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2018) (considering company’s submission contesting
alternative service on chief executive officer as amicus filing); In. GLG Life lech Corp. Sec.
Litig. 287 E.R.D. 262, 265 (S.D.N-¥. 2012) (Same); Seé also Brénnér v. SGott, 298 F.R.D. 689
(N.D. Fla. 2014) (not allowing organization that opposed same-sex marriage to intervene in.
Plaintiffs’ actions challenging Florida’s constitutional, and, statutory provisions banning ‘same-sex
marriage, but allowing'the. organization. to, be heard as amicis). On this basis, this Court has.

fully considered the views expressed by’the Government in its letter.
