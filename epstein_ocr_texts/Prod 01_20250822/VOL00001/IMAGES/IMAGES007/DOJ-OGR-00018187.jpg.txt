1 take her to different spas?

2 "A, Yes.

3 "QO. And there she would recruit young women to come to

S "A, Because she was English and she didn't know the area too

6 much as well as I know. So she says, John, make a list of all
7 the massage, the spas in the area from Jupiter to Boca Raton,

8 and we went to all this main spas. And then we went to the

9 schools for massage therapists and all the massage parlors and
10 massages, the small massage. So I make a list from the

11 telephone book and we would go from one to the other one. I

12 would wait in the car and she goes in. And sometimes it took a
13 couple of minutes and walk out with cards, business cards, and
14 that she did the recruiting."

16 A. Yes, Sir.

17 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would ask that the remainder
18 of the answer be read, please.

19 THE COURT: Go ahead.

2l of it. I never did any recruiting and I never really saw him
22 doing that. Him, right?"
23 A. Hold on. Can you repeat the question.
24 Q. There is no question. I was just reading your answer,
25 Mr. Alessi.
