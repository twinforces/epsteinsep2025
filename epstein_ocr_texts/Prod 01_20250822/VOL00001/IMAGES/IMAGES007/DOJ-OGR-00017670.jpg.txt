LC1Qmax2 Jane â€” Cross

1 THE COURT: Ms. Menninger, you can take off your mask.
2 I want to pause. Counsel, one of the exhibits

3 referenced was not in one of the jurors' binders, so I want to
4 just correct that.

5 Ms. Williams, can you let counsel know what exhibit it
6 was?

7 MS. MENNINGER: My apologies, your Honor. We'll get

8 that fixed.

9 THE COURT: Thank you. And thank you to the juror for
10 alerting us.

11 MS. MENNINGER: If there is anyone else that has a

12 problem.

13 Thank you, your Honor.

14 THE COURT: I apologize for that. I'm grateful to the
15 jurors. If anything like that happens, feel free to kind of

16 raise your hand in the moment and we'll have Ms. Williams as

17 she always does, make things right.

18 (Pause)

19 THE COURT: I think we're not in the binders at the
20 moment, so while Mr. Everdell is working on that, you'll
21 proceed.
22 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor.
23 BY MS. MENNINGER:
24 Q. I believe we were talking about you going to the movies
25 with Epstein and Ghislaine. Do you remember that?
