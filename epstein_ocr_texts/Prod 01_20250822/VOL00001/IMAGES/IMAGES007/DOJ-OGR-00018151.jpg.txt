1 (At the sidebar)
2 MR. PAGLIUCA: I apologize, your Honor. It was
3 completely unintentional. I apologize.
4 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, given that Mr. Pagliuca
a represented that he had prepared to cross-examine this witness
6 on this testimony, I think we need to have a plan going forward
7 for how to make sure this does not happen again because,
8 clearly, Mr. Pagliuca had not prepared enough.
9 THE COURT: The witness herself did the same thing.
10 It happens. My perception was that it was an accident.
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Completely.
12 THE COURT: I agree, we need a plan, but â€”-
13 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would propose that to the
14 extent Mr. Pagliuca intends to use some sort of prior
15 inconsistent statement, that he can discuss it with me before
16 reading it into the record, and we can confer about how he
17 should read it.
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: I understand how to read, your Honor.
19 It won't happen again.
20 THE COURT: All right. It won't happen again.
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: It will not.
22 THE COURT: If it happens again, we're going to need a
23 different approach.
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: I understand. It will not happen
25 again.
