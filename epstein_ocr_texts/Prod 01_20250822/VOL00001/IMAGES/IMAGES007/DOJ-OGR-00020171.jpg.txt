Thereby inform you that in France, all removal proceedings and conditions are
governed by Articles 696 et sq. of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Article 696-2 of said Code provides that: “The French government is able to remit to

foreign governments upon their request any individual who is not a French citizen and who is subject to a
lawsuit brought on behalf of the requesting State, or who is subject to a sentence passed by the Court of said
requesting State, and who is located on the territory of the French Republic.”

Article 694-4 expressly specifies as follows:

“Removal is not granted:

1- When the individual claimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been

assessed at the time of the offense on the basis of which removal is being

requested.”

WHEREBY, the fact that the wanted individual is a French national constitutes an
insuperable obstacle to his/her removal. As long as said nationality is assessed at the time the
offense was committed, any loss of nationality subsequent to said offense has no bearing upon
the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said assessment of nationality.
