with the appeal currently pending in Giuffre v. Max-
well, No. 20-2418. (2d Cir. Dkt. 17). The Government
is not a party to the appeal in Giuffre v. Maxwell,
which concerns an order issued in a civil case unseal-
ing materials that were previously filed under seal. On
September 16, 2020, the Government filed a motion to
dismiss Maxwell’s appeal for lack of jurisdiction and
requested that this Court deny Maxwell’s motion for
consolidation (the “Motion to Dismiss’). (2d Cir. Dkt.
37).
ARGUMENT
POINT |

This Court Lacks Jurisdiction To Hear This Appeal

As explained in the Government’s Motion to Dis-
miss, the final judgment rule precludes jurisdiction
over Maxwell’s appeal of the Order. See 28 U.S.C.
§ 1291. Maxwell fails to explain how the Order falls
within the “small class” of decisions that constitute im-
mediately appealable collateral orders. See Van Cau-
wenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 522 (1988). Accord-
ingly, this Court should dismiss Maxwell’s appeal for
lack of appellate jurisdiction.
A. Applicable Law

Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291 ex-
pressly limits the jurisdiction of Courts of Appeals to
“final decisions of the district courts.” 28 U.S.C. § 1291.
“This final judgment rule requires that a party must
ordinarily raise all claims of error in a single appeal
