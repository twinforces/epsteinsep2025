LC6Cmax7 Maguire - direct

1 THE COURT: You may.

2 MS. MOE: I'll show it to counsel first.

3 Q. All right, so I've just handed you what's been marked for

4 identification as Government Exhibit 54. Special Agent

5 Maguire, do you recognize this?

6 A. Yes, matam, I do.

7 Q. What is Government Exhibit 54?

8 A. This is a hard drive that was located in the previous

9 exhibit, 935R. This was in one of the boxes that was located
10 in the plastic bins in that office.

11 Q. And have you examined Government Exhibit 54 in preparation
12 for your testimony today?

13 A. Yes, I have.

14 Q. And how do you know that Government Exhibit 54 is one of

15 the hard drives contained in the box that we're looking at here
16 in Government Exhibit 935R?

17 A. I examined this hard drive. I also recognized the New York
18 CART lab bar code that's located on it.

19 Q. So you just mentioned a New York CART bar code. Can you
20 please explain to the jury what that is?
21 A. Typically, when we seize digital evidence items, we then
22 turn them over to a unit in the FBI called CART. It's the
23 Computer Analysis Response Team. They're just more technically
24 trained to extract and review the digital evidence. When they
25 receive an evidence item, they put their own bar code on it.
