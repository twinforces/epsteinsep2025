District Court, Maxwell offered no coherent explana-

have any conceivable impact on the issues pending in
civil litigation. She cited no case law suggesting that,
for example, the possibility of an inevitable discovery
argument by the Government should foreclose unseal-
ing in a civil case, or that unsealing analysis should be
affected by a concern about pretrial publicity in a sep-
arate criminal case. In the absence of any such expla-
nation, Judge Nathan’s Order declining to modify the
Protective Order did not amount to an abuse of her
broad discretion when overseeing an ongoing criminal
case.

Even on this appeal, Maxwell still fails to explain
why she needs to use materials relating to the Govern-

als are relevant to the issues pending in those cases or
how the manner in which the Government obtained
