‘this case. Thesé individuals still maintain, a. significant privacy’ interest that nivst be

safeguarded. The exception the Defense secks ‘is too broad and risks undermining the
protections.of the priv acy of witnesses and alleged victims that.is. required by law. In

‘contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxiwell to ‘publicly
reference individuals who have spoken, by. name .on the record in this: case. It-also,

allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identitics of.individuals they’ believe:may. be

relev ant.. to Potential: Defense: Witnesses and their counsel duri ing the:¢ course of the

propiosal adequately balanices the. ‘interests at, stake. ‘And, as. the Gov ernment’ 5. ‘etter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at.4, to the extent that the. Defense needs an exception.to the.
‘protective order:for a specitic investigative purpose, they can make applications to the

Gout on a Case—by—case. basis. Second, restrictions onthe ability of potential.

‘witnesses and-their counsel to'use discovery. materials. forpurposes. other than

preparing for. trial. in this ‘case:are unwarranted. The request appears’ unprecedented.

‘despite the; fact-that:there have. been many high—profile.criminal matters that had _
related civil litigation. The Government Jabors under many restrictions including Rule

6(¢) ofthe: Federal‘Rules of Criminal Procedure; the:Privacy,Act of 1974,. and. other:
policies of the’ Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney’ s Office for the: Southern.
District of New York, all:of:which the Court expects: the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely’ only. provide potential

‘witnesses with: ‘materials that those: witnesses already. have-in. their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of:course, those:witnesses who do testify-at trial; would-be subject to;

examination on,the record as to what:materials were-provided or shown to, then? by the
Government. Nothing ‘in the. Defense's papers. explains how its unprecedented

‘proposed restriction. is somehow. necessary to ensure.a fair trial. For the: foregoing
‘reasons, the Court: adopts the Government's:proposed protective ‘order, which will be

entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt: No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by’ Judge
