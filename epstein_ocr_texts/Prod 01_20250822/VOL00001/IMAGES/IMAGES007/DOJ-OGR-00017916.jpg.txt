LC2VMAX2 Rocchio â€” Direct

1 referred to in the literature as entrapment and a dynamic of

2 coercive control whereby the perpetrator wants to maintain the
3 relationship, maintain the power they have over the victim of

4 childhood sexual abuse so that the abuse can continue, but also
5 to the extent that the child remains isolated and under the

6 control of the perpetrator, the victim is far less likely to

7 disclose.

8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and

9 training, how, if at all, common is it for a child to be
10 sexually abused multiple times by the same perpetrator?
11 A. Unfortunately, it's very common. Again, because it's
12 occurring in a relationship, oftentimes the perpetrator has
13 continued access and the abuse continues.
14 Q. How long does it typically take to move through the stages
15 of grooming that you've described for the jury?
16 A. It can really depend. I mean, we call them stages, but
17 sometimes they occur simultaneously, sometimes they occur, you
18 know, more gradually. So we can be talking about a process of
19 weeks, we can be talking about something that's happening over
20 the course of months or abuse that can continue over the course
al of many years.
22 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you
23 familiar with the term "grooming the environment"?
24 A. I am.
25 Q. What is grooming the environment?
