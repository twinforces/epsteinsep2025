1 include electronic materials, to be due by Monday, November 9

2 of this year, and following that we would propose the following
3 motion schedule: that defense motions be due by Monday,

4 December 21 of this year; that the government's response be due
5 on Friday, January 22, 2021; and that replies be due on Friday,
6 February 5, 2021.

9 discovery, is that schedule that's been laid out sufficient

10 from your perspective to do everything that you need to do?

11 MR. COHEN: Your Honor, just two points in that

12 regard. I think counsel for the government did not mention in

18 THE COURT: Thank you.

19 Ms. Moe, do you agree?
20 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. I apologize.
21 We did include that in the e-mail to your Honor's chambers, and
22 that is correct.
23 And thank you, counsel, for clarifying that.
24 MR. COHEN: Two additional points, your Honor. The
25 trial schedule that we are agreeing to, of course subject to
