1 visa application that bears Kate's name. It was provided to us
2 some time in the wee hours. I do not know its origin, but it

3 certainly contains specific information regarding this witness.
4 It may require us to call a witness, so I need to know from

5 where it came.

6 The other has to do with the emails. I'm not sure

7 what the Court's preclusion of the introduction of the emails

8 which actually constitute past recollection recorded of this

9 witness to Mr. Epstein.

10 THE COURT: Let's start with the -- what got marked —--
11 remind me what the —--

12 MS. STERNHEIM: I think it was K-9.

13 THE COURT: 3513-062, pages 1 through 6, which got

14 marked for identification as Defendant's K-9. The request is
15 for the government to indicate the origin.

16 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, on 3513-045, the notes

17 say, at the end of the meeting, the witness's counsel provided
18 a form and asked to discuss her visa status, and that is the

19 form. And the index also indicates that that was the form
20 provided on that date.
21 THE COURT: Okay. That resolves that.
22 And then the emails which were marked -- I'm sorry,
23 remind me what they were marked as.
24 MS. STERNHEIM: I think they were marked as K-7.
25 THE COURT: Defendant's K-7.
