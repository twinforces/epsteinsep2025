Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 753 Filed 08/10/22 Page1580f264 1584
LC.7VMAXS5 Carolyn - cross

we have the factual récord.. There's no additional record ‘that
would lead to exclusion, and so we'll do what. we need to do, A
hearing, an order, only to prepare ‘further for what's going to
happen. is. likely not necessarily, I don't see any law that
supports that. But we'll get ‘the full facttal record and

you'll brief it,

So T would like -- if this witnéss 418 going to testify

tomorrow, I think the government needs to provide the defense
the réstlts of a full factual investigation by 6 ‘p.m. And
then, Ms. Menninger, when would you like to brief the issue?

MS. MENNINGER: By 9 p.m:;, your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. By 9 ‘p.m.

And then let.'s say == Mr. RoHrbach?

MR. ROHRBACH: 1, apologize. By 9 p.m. By midnight.
I khow that's late for the Court. That would be thrée hours
for each side to write a brief.

THE GOURT: Okay:

MR. ROHRBACH: Thank ‘you, your Honor.

Just. ohe other point. oh this witness, your Hoénor.

We understand that this witness is also a, subject of a
defense subpoena. And so the government would just liké to
know whether, im light of the defense's motion, to preclude his
testimony for this reason, he's still under défense Subpoéna.

THE COURT: I suppose they might, want to know the
result of that motion first.
