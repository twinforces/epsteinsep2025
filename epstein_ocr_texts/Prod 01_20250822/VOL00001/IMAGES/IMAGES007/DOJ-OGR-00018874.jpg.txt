Copies ;

MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, the fact that. somebody fills
out a request for insurance doés not déem it a business record.
It is not related to the course of business of the Mar-a-Lago

property, and the governitient is trying, through a backdoor

method, to draw an. inference that because a person. named
Virginia Roberts was insuréd by a man named Sky Roberts, that
she was, one, employed by Mar-a-Lago or, two, was at
Mar-a-Lago: InSurdnce does not stipport that.

THE COURT: Nothing in these records appears. support
that she was émployed at Mar=a=Lago.

MR. ROHRBACH: The government agrees, your Honor,
these records don't Give rise to that:

THE COURT: But. you're trying to show that?

MR. ROHRBACH: That she was the dependent of a
Mar-a-Lago. employee.

On the insurance point; I would note that Sky Roberts
was not an, outsider to Mar-a-Lago at, the time be filled out the
employee benefits forms. He was an employee 6f Mar=d=Lag6, and
one of the things Mar-a-Lago does is ‘provide benefits to its
employees:

THE COURT: (And then on the business meconds, your
argument, Ms. Stérnheim, is that because it's a form filléd out
by Mar-a-Lago employees for the purposes of insurance that's
provided by another entity, that they're not a Mar-a-Lago.
