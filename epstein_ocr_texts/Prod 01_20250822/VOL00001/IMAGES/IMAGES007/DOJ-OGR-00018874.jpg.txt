2 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, the fact that somebody fills

3 out a request for insurance does not deem it a business record.
4 It is not related to the course of business of the Mar-a-Lago

5 property, and the government is trying, through a backdoor

6 method, to draw an inference that because a person named

7 Virginia Roberts was insured by a man named Sky Roberts, that

8 she was, one, employed by Mar-a-Lago or, two, was at

9 Mar-a-Lago. Insurance does not support that.

10 THE COURT: Nothing in these records appears support
11 that she was employed at Mar-a-Lago.

12 MR. ROHRBACH: The government agrees, your Honor,

13 these records don't give rise to that.

14 THE COURT: But you're trying to show that?

15 MR. ROHRBACH: That she was the dependent of a

16 Mar-a-Lago employee.

17 On the insurance point, I would note that Sky Roberts
18 was not an outsider to Mar-a-Lago at the time he filled out the
19 emoloyee benefits forms. He was an employee of Mar-a-Lago, and
20 one of the things Mar-a-Lago does is provide benefits to its
21 employees.
22 THE COURT: And then on the business records, your
23 argument, Ms. Sternheim, is that because it's a form filled out
24 by Mar-a-Lago employees for the purposes of insurance that's
25 provided by another entity, that they're not a Mar-a-Lago
