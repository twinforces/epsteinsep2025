1 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, iS now an appropriate time

12 THE COURT: Just a moment. Go ahead.

13 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

14 Two issues to raise.

15 The first is the issue that we raised earlier this

16 morning about the remaining anonymity issue. Happy to raise

17 that at this time, if it's appropriate. I don't know if it's
18 coming up soon in cross-examination.

19 THE COURT: Okay.
20 MS. MOE: But we would prefer to raise that at sidebar
21 because it relates to anonymity.
22 The second issue is the Rule 408 issue I flagged this
23 morning relating to documents we received a few minutes before
24 the beginning of the court day. Happy to front that issue now
25 while we have a break if the Court would like to hear that
