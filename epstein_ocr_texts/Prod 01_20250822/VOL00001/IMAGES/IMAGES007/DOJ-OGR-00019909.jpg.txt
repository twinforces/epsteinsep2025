charges conduct not covered by the NPA, which was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from
2001 to 2007,.a time period that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment, and to violations

the defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The.
defendant appears to have access to extensive sources of wealth. She does not have a job that

would tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not
