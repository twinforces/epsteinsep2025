charges conduct not covered by the NPA, which was limited by its terms to conduct spanning from
2001 to 2007, a time period that post-dates the conduct charged in the Indictment, and to violations
of statutes not charged in this Indictment. In this respect, the Government further notes that the
Indictment brought in this District is entirely independent of the prior SDFL investigation, and two
of the victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL,
and had never spoken to law enforcement until they met with our Office in 2019.

Nor is there any force to the defendant’s assertion — without explanation, much less legal

prosecution of crimes involving the sexual abuse of minors at any time during the life of the victim.
The defendant’s claim that the Indictment is barred by the statute of limitations has no basis in

“subject to dismissal” for unspecified reasons. Opposition Memorandum at 19. These conclusory
claims are baseless.

As the Government detailed in its opening brief, the defendant’s international ties,
considerable financial resources, and transient lifestyle all make her a risk of flight. That risk is
further exacerbated by the fact that the defendant is a citizen of France, which does not extradite
its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law. In addition, and as detailed further below,
the defendant has not only the motive to flee, but the means to do so swiftly and effectively. The
defendant appears to have access to extensive sources of wealth. She does not have a job that
would tie her to the United States, much less the Southern District of New York, and she does not
