applicable presumption relates to risk of flight, and, as noted, Ms. Maxwell has rebutted that
presumption based on her ties to the United States, her decision to remain in this country
after Epstein’s arrest, and all of the other reasons discussed above. This Court should follow
other courts in this Circuit and elsewhere that have found that defendants rebutted the
presumption and imposed appropriately strict bail conditions in cases involving alleged
offenses against minors. See Deutsch, 2020 WL 3577398, at *5-6; United States v. Veres,
No. 3:20-CR-18-J-32JBT, 2020 WL 1042051, at *3-4 (M.D. Fla. Mar. 4, 2020); Conway,
2011 WL 3421321, at *4-5.

The Impact of the Potential Penalties Is Overstated. The government asserts that
detention is warranted because of the potential for a long sentence in this case. (Gov. Mem.
at 4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing standard. Although the severity of potential
punishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidenceof
the commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potentially long sentence to support a
finding of risk of flight.” Friedman, 837 F.2d at 49-50 (district court’s finding that
defendant posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence
of incarceration”); see also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order
where defendants agreed to significant physical and financial restrictions, despite the fact
that they faced a “lengthy term of incarceration’). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a
long sentence does not meet the government’s burden of persuasion.'4
‘4 The government relies on United States v. Alindato-Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d 58, 66 (D.P.R. 2009), cited
approvingly by United States v. Moscaritolo, No. 10 Cr. 4 (JL), 2010 WL 309679, at *2 (D.N.H. Jan. 26, 2010) for
the proposition that “[t]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight risk is, especially considering
the strong case of the government .. ..” (Gov. Mem. at 5.) But Alindato-Perez is easily distinguished on its facts
from Ms. Maxwell’s case. Alindato-Perez was a narcotics case that did not involve 20-year old conduct as here, but
instead involved a conspiracy that “continu[ed] until the date of the indictment.” 627 F. Supp. 2d at 60-61. The
evidence included eleven “clearly incriminating video tapes” and testimony from various cooperating witnesses, and
the defendant faced a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence. /d. at 61-64. These factors are not present in this case.
