applicable presumption relates to risk of flight, and, as noted, Ms. Maxwell has. rebutted that
after Epstein’s arrest, and all of the other reasons discussed above. This Court should follow:
other courts in this Circuit. and, elsewhere that have found that defendants rebutted, the
presumption, and imposed appropriately strict bail, conditions in:cases involving alleged
offenses against minors. See Deutsch, 2020 WL 3577398, at *5-6; United States v. Veres,
No. 3:20-CR-18-J-32JBT, 2020 WL 1042051, at *3-4 (M.D. Fla. Mar..4, 2020); Conway,
2011 WL. 34213211, at, *4-5.

The Impéctof the.Potential Penalties Is Overstated. The. government asserts that
‘detention is warranted because of the potential fora long, sentence :in this case. (Gov. Mem.
at,4-5.) This oversimplifies the governing ‘standard. Although the severity of potential,
punishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Cireuit “require[s] more than evidence of
the commission of a, serious crime and the fact of a. potentially long sentence: to support a,
finding of risk. of flight.” /*riedman, 837 F.2d at 49-50 (district court’s finding that
‘defendant posed a risk of flight was Clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long sentence:
of incarceration”); séc also: Subhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing detention order
‘where defendants agreed to significant physical. and. financial ‘restrictions, despite the fact
that they faced,a “lengthy term ‘of incarceration”). Accordingly, the asserted ‘potential. for. a,

long sentence docs:not:meet the government’s burden of persuasion.'*
