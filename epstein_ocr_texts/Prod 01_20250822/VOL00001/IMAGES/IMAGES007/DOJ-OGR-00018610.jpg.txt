1 goes today and flag that later on.

2 THE COURT: Well, we're not going to speed up Brian

3 because he's planning to fly home today. The question is when
4 we have sufficient time to inquire whether there's been an

a effective violation of the sequestration order and, if so, what
6 the appropriate remedy for that is. So that's going to require
7 a factual investigation by the government, and then legal

8 analysis from both sides as to what an appropriate remedy is in
9 light of what we learn factually.

10 MS. MOE: Of course, your Honor. I just wanted to

11 flag a scheduling concern. I certainly don't mean to expedite
12 the issue. We'll thoroughly examine it.

13 THE COURT: Okay. Ms. Menninger, is that --

14 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.

15 THE COURT: -- sufficient in light of where we are at
16 the moment?

17 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: Okay. Other issues?

19 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.
20 I also conferred with the government this morning in
21 light of the briefing last night on Mr. Flatley's testimony.
22 Because the letter that we received from the government is
23 different from what I was told during a conferral on Friday on
24 this topic. So I've tried to narrow the issues as I understand
25 them to be.
