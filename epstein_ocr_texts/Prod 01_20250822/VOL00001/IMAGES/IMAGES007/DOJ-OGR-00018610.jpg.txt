LE. 7VMAX1

goés today and flag that ldtér on.
THE COURT: Well, we'wze not going to speed. up. Brian

because he's ‘planning 'to fly home today. The quéeStior is when

we have sufficient time te -inguire whether there's been an
effective Violation of the sequestration ordér and, if so, what
the appropriate remedy for that 18. So that's going to require
a factual investigation by the government, and then legal
analysis from both sides as tq what an. appropriate remedy is in
light of what we léarn factually:

MS, MOE: Of course, your Honor. I just wanted to
flag a scheduling concern. IT certainly d6n't mean to expedite
the issue. We'll thoroughly examine Lt.

THE GOURT: Okay: Ms, Menninger, is that ==

MS. MENNINGER: Yes, ‘your Honor.

THE GOURT: == sufficient in light of where we are at
the moment ?

MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. Other issues?

MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.

I also conferred with the government ‘this morning jin.
light. of the briefing last night 6n Mr. Flatley's testimony.

Because the letter that we received from the government is

different. from what IT was. told during a cénferral on Friday on
this topic. So L've tried to narrow the issues as I understand
them to be.
