against Ms. Maxwell. For example, one post stated “they. need to get this bitch n string her
up by her neck . . . fckin monster.” Another stated:

I hope someone finds her and kills her. That would be justice. Obviously her
lawyers know’s [sic] where she is, someone should stick them up to batteries
until we find out where she is.

These posts were particularly chilling because some of them suggested that the

violent acts they had been threatenmig. For example, mm response to an August 14, 2019
news report that Ms. Maxwell might be living in Massachusetts, one person wrote:

SHE'S HERE in #Massachusetts ?! The bitch #GhislaineMaxwell who
#SexTrafficked young girls for #Epstein ?!?! Why the hell isn't she being
brought in for questioning @ManchesterMAPD ?! WE DO NOT WANT
HER HERE! #SleezyLeach She is CLOSE ENOUGH to me, I could grab her
myself!

The intense media attention and violent threats made it no longer possible for Ms.
Maxwell[ | to live a quiet life and required Ms. Maxwell to take more drastic

steps to protectherself[ Rather than see[ | harmed by even more

unwanted media attention, Ms. Maxwell made the difficult decision to separate herself [|
[| and leave her home. As her spouse writes:

Ghislaine’s own arrest in July of this‘year, huge and increasingly frightening
levels of media interest meant

There are many examples of violence whose seeds were born in
conspiracy theories, and the experiences of QAnon, Pizzagate, and the recent.
Judge Salas attack‘are terrifying...

It is hard to communicate in words the feeling of being stalked, spied upon and
trapped by constant, 24/7 media‘intrusion
