Further, Maxwell has. provided no ‘information, about; 'the:'subject; matter of the criminal
investigation into Epstcin’s co-conspirators, the status of the investigation, or even. disclosed.
whether she herself is a:target. of the Southeri District’s investigation. When. Plaintiff's counsel
asked Maxwell's counsel. for ‘information about the criminal investigation during their mect and
[pending « a parallel criminal, prosccution] bears the’ burden ofestablishing its: need. » Rex & Rober la
Ling Living Tr. vB Comme ns Ltd., 346 F. Supp. 3d 389, 400 (S:D.N.Y. 2018) (internal quotation.
marks omitted). Maxwell therefore cannot. use the existence of a criminal investigation to dodge
her discovery-obligations in this matter, particularly while at the same time:refusing'to:provide any
‘details or:reasons as to why the ‘investigation is a reason to stay the: action. under the law of this
Circuit."

Second, the potential claims resolution program doés not.justify a stay of discévery. As
this. Court knows, the program.cannot.go. forward duc to the current criminal activity licr_on Jeffrey’
Epstcin’s Estate in the US. Virgin Islands (“USVI”). See: ft. of Feb. I, 2020 Conf: at 36: Is 18
Islands, they. may: end up unstayed.’ °), But ¢ even nif the Tien were ° lifted, and the: program “could g 20
forward. tomorrow, both Epstcin’s Estate (Maxwell’s co-defendant) and this Court have:recognized.
that victims would still not be: tequired to stay discovery in,their cases in.order to participate in the
program. Tr. of Feb 11, 2020 Conf. at 6:10-18 (Estate explaining that staying litigation i is not
required. in order to participate | in, the program); Tr. of Feb 11, 2020 Conf. at. 17:2-3 (Court:
recognizing that. Defendants cannot ask. victims to stay their cases in order to participate in, the
program); Tr: of Nov. 21, 2019 Conf. at .26:10=11 (“The default: in this Court-is that it docs not.
stay discovery.”). Accordingly, this. Court has not stayed any other action against.Jcffrey Epstein’s
Estate in. light of.a potential.claims administration program unless all the: partics agreed ‘to such a
stay, and. there is :no reason. to treat. this case differently merely because Maxwell. is named. as a
Defendant in addition to the Estate. Further, this Court has recognized, that, some discovery might,
in.‘fact, be necessary to inform. the claims resolution, program. Tr. of Nov. 2.1, 2019. Conf. at:
27: 8- M yer may b be that you. need discovery: im the ftigation f to have in hand, certain discovery’

so

participate, Maxwell. will be released from liability for sexually assaulting Plaintiff when she was
achild. But, again, the contours of the ‘program have ‘not been finalized. Even. if the program
moves forward and. cven :if Plaintiff chooses to participate, :it.is not-clear that Maxwell would. be
released for her torts against Plaintiff. In fact, the scope: of the release that participants in. the
program would. be required to'sign is the ‘very Issue, and the sole issuc, that the. USVI Attorney
Gencral,.and Epstcin’s Estate are still negotiating. See Co-Executors’ Corrections to Attorney

. The pending criminal investigation. did, not ‘inhibit Maxwell, from, filing her own lawsuit

against, the Estate for indemnification, ¢ven though her criminal. conduct would be directly at. issuc
in:that' case, and the casc’would require discovery conecrning such conduct. Maxwell ¥. Estate of
Jeffrey E. Epstein, et al., ST-20-CV-155 (V.1. Super. Ct.); Willie v:. Amerada-Hess Corp.,:66 W.1.
23, 92 (Super. Ct. 2017) (common law indemnification is only available “where:an innoc ent parly
is held vicariously ‘liable ‘for the, actions: of the, (rue tortfeasor’ (emphases in, original) (internal,
quotation marks and. citations omitted)).
