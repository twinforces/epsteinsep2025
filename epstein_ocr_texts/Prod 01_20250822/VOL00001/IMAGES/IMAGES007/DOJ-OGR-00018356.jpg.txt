1 one that the government chose to flag at this time.

2 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, all of those â€”- those may

3 or may not be lines of cross depending on exactly how the

4 question is phrased, but the government is not objecting to

a them in advance now. The government's objection is to the

6 specific identification of the particular counsel, which we

7 don't think is relevant.

8 And I'd note that I think this counsel's name was used
9 in cross examination of other witnesses already, so the

10 government is trying to, in part, prevent a suggestion that

11 this lawyer is involved in some kind of broader conspiracy for
12 which there is no evidence. So that's a level of prejudice.

13 THE COURT: You can ask if she's represented, you can
14 ask what her counsel's name is, I don't see a relevance, you

15 can ask if your attorney is in the courtroom, a spectacle of

16 pointing him out.

17 MS. STERNHEIM: IT don't need to do that, Judge. I'm
18 not trying to make a spectacle of this. I'm just trying to

19 have the record covered.
20 THE COURT: T'll allow that. Counsel, any reason for
21 sealing this?
22 MS. STERNHEIM: I don't think so.
23 MR. ROHRBACH: I don't think that's necessary. We
24 didn't use any names.
25 THE COURT: Okay. Not sealed.
