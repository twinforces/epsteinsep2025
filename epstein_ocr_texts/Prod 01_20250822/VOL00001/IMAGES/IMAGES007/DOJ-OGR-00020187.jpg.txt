WILLIAM JULIE
AVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW

Criminal Procedure use the present tense (“a person-who is a national. of the Requested
State”’/"the person. claimed Aas French nationality”), which can only mean that the
extradition of a-person is denicd when. that person 7s°:in ‘fact a French national. If the
person. is‘no longer.'a, French. national, at the ‘time of the request, the provision, docs. not

apply.

. Had these, provisions been intended to. apply in cases Where the person, has lost French

nationality’ subsequent. to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have
expressly: stated so or would. at least have used, both the present,and, the past. tense to

qualify:the national affiliation of the: requested person.

. Eurthermoré, it is a well-known principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions
that execptions ‘to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ‘ban being an
exception to extradition, it must beinterpreted in a restrictive manner and its application

to a person who is no longer a French national. must be rejected.

. Second, the: Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spiritof the law

‘Criminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact
not intended to apply in.casés where ‘the person sought has lost French citizenship, but
only: in. cascs ‘where that person. has aequired French citizenship subsequent: to, the

commission of the alleged. crime.

. In other'words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for

which extradition. is requested” secks to deny the extension of the: benefit of French
offence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders, sccking to

escape extradition.
