LC3KMAX4 Parkinson —- Direct

1 It's not really a structure; it's like a storage place.

2 Q. Other than that storage place, could you describe what the
3 three structures were on the property, please?

4 A. Yes. The first one that I walked into was the main house

iy itself, two stories, facing north, the backyard was to the

6 south.

7 The second building that I went into, I really don't

8 have a name for it. To me, it was a barracks. It's where the
9 working staff stayed. I think there were three rooms there.
10 It was a separate building disjoined from the main house.
11 And then there was a third building that went -- in
12 Florida, I don't know about up North, we call it a cabana, and
13 it was at the south end of a swimming pool, and it was a
14 gymnasium, basically.
15 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, could we just clarify if
16 we're talking about 2003 or 2005 now, when he's describing the
17 property?
18 THE COURT: Sure.
19 BY MS. COMEY:
20 Q. That description you just gave, Mr. Parkinson, was that how
al the property appeared on October 20, 2005?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Mr. Parkinson — I just want to be clear — all of the rest
24 of the questions I'm going to be asking you today will be about
25 October 20, 2005. Okay?
