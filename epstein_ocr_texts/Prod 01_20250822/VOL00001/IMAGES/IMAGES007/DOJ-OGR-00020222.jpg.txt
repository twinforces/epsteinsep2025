decision. First, the government represents that, per the United States Marshal’s Service, “the
interview room at the courthouse can be made available for [Mr. Robertson] to meet with his
attorneys to prepare for trial, for unlimited meetings and unlimited durations of meetings during
business hours, excepting only times when the Aspen courtroom is in use.” Doc. 298 at 2. There
is a catch, however: “There is a screen in the interview room, which will allow for appropriate
social distancing between [Mr. Robertson] and his lawyers.” Jd. Second, the government
represents that “the Santa Fe jail is willing to provide an exception to the policy barring in-person
attorney visits, and will work to accommodate in-person visits between Robertson and _ his
attorneys.” Id.

While the Court appreciates the government’s effort in gathering information on these
alternatives, they do not change its decision on release. First, the Court notes that the government
could have, and should have, presented this information earlier if it wanted the Court to rely on
these alternatives to deny release. Mr. Robertson filed his motion for reconsideration on December
21, 2020. Doc. 274. The government had a month and a half to investigate alternatives and make
its argument against release. It cannot wait until an unfavorable ruling to present additional
evidence that it was capable of presenting in the first instance. A motion for reconsideration is
for presenting new evidence that was “previously unavailable.” Servants of Paraclete, 204 F.3d
at 1012.

Second, the proposed alternatives are inadequate to address the trial preparation concerns
the Court has articulated. The proposal to use the interview room at the Santa Fe courthouse is
inadequate because the room, by the government’s own description, will still contain a “screen”
between Mr. Robertson and his attorneys. For all of the reasons set forth above, the defense team
cannot effectively prepare for trial if they cannot sit next to Mr. Robertson and go over documents
