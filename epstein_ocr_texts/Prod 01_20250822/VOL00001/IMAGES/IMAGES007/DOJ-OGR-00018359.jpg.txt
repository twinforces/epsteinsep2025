exhibits shotild bé under Séal.

THE COURT: I theught I did admit that under seal, but
tiaybe I misremembered.

MS, MENNINGER: Your Honer, we ended up admitting the
one complete document. Tt is, now marked J&8 and 9 because it's
the one that contains the seal. I think to narrowly tailor
redactions so ‘that it Gant be matched up P it May include ‘the
case number, for example, certainly the plaintiffs' names, but
otherwise I think ‘there 15 a Way to redact this so that’ the
public has access. to the bulk of the exhibit, but just not the
personally identifying information.

Again, I'm happy ‘to speak, with Ms. Moe about what she

believes are the things that would lead to be a personally:
identifying piece of, information, but portions of it, including

the défendants' names and other pieces were testified about

publicly on the record, not under seal.

So, I think to keep the entire exhibit under seal doés

not comport with Lugash and, the other precedent that requires

us to sort of take a peh to the parts that are concerning.
THE COURT: Sq Jet's do this, same process. If I

didn't already, J8 and J9 are temporarily sealed and you'll

confer on mwedactiLons.

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. We'd be Happy to confer.

I. do want, to flag, because these documents are entirely public

in, full, it is very easy for a. member of the public to compare
