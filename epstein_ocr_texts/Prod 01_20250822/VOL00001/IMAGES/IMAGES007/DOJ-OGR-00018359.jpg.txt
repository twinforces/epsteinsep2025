1 exhibits should be under seal.

2 THE COURT: I thought I did admit that under seal, but
3 maybe I misremembered.

4 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, we ended up admitting the
5) one complete document. It is now marked J8 and 9 because it's
6 the one that contains the seal. I think to narrowly tailor

7 redactions so that it can't be matched up, it may include the

8 case number, for example, certainly the plaintiffs' names, but
9 otherwise I think there is a way to redact this so that the

10 public has access to the bulk of the exhibit, but just not the
11 personally identifying information.

12 Again, I'm happy to speak with Ms. Moe about what she
13 believes are the things that would lead to be a personally

14 identifying piece of information, but portions of it, including
15 the defendants' names and other pieces were testified about

16 publicly on the record, not under seal.

17 So, I think to keep the entire exhibit under seal does
18 not comport with Lugash and the other precedent that requires
19 us to sort of take a pen to the parts that are concerning.
20 THE COURT: So let's do this, same process. If I
21 didn't already, J8 and J9 are temporarily sealed and you'll
22 confer on redactions.
23 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. We'd be happy to confer.
24 I do want to flag, because these documents are entirely public
25 in full, it is very easy for a member of the public to compare
