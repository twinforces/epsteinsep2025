8 A. That is correct, yes.

9 Q. What's the name of that agent?

10 MR. ROHRBACH: Objection, your Honor.

11 THE COURT: Just a moment. Where are you directing?
12 MS. MENNINGER: The top of page 4, your Honor.

13 THE COURT: Thank you.

14 MS. MENNINGER: And the middle of the page as well.

15 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, we object to reading this
16 name out loud. There's no particular relevance for it.

17 THE COURT: Okay. If you want to just focus the jury
18 so they can look at it themselves, Ms. Menninger.

19 MS. MENNINGER: Certainly, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: Thank you.
21 BY MS. MENNINGER:
22 Q. So in the middle of the page, the upper right-hand corner
23 of the page, a name of an agent is represented; correct? You
24 don't have to read the name into the record, but do you see the
25 name of the agent?
