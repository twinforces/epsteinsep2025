Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 753 Filed 08/10/22 Page17 of 264 1439
LC 7VMAX1

1 I think the only outstanding issue from yesterday is

2 the objection to Exhibit 309. I'm sustaining that objection on
3 401/403 grounds.

4 What else do we need?

a) MS. MENNINGER: Nothing else from the defense, your

6 Honor.

7 MS. MOE: Your Honor, may we briefly be heard at

8 sidebar about an issue relating to potential cross-examination
9 of Brian that implicates a privacy interest?

10 THE COURT: Okay. So this will be sealed; correct?

11 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

12 THE COURT: I do have a request for lengthy sealed

13 proceedings that we do them in the robing room because of the
14 physical taxing on the court reporter. So if you think it will
15 be short, we can do it here; if it will be more than five

16 minutes, we should do it in the robing room.

17 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

18 I believe this will be brief.

19 THE COURT: Okay. All right.
