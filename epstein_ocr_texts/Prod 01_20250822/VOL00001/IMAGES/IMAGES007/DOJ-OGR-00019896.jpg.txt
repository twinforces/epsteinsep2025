France and the United Kingdom.'? Notably, two weeks ago, this Court recognized in United
States v. Abdellatif El Mokadem, No. 19-CR-646 (AJN), 2020 WL 3440515 (S.D.N.Y. June
23, 2020) that “concerns regarding risk of flight are mitigated by the ongoing [COVID-19]
pandemic, which has understandably curtailed travel across the country, and, indeed, around
the world.” /d. at *1. In that case, despite finding detention to be warranted on two prior
occasions, the Court concluded that the government could no longer establish flight risk and
ordered the defendant released pending sentencing. /d. (“Taking account of the COVID-19
pandemic, which had not yet reached this country when the Court last considered
Defendant’s custody status, the balance now clearly and convincingly tips in Defendant’s
favor.......”). Consideration of this factor weighs heavily in favor of release on the proposed
bail conditions here.
De The Nature and Circumstances of the Charges and the
Weight of the Evidence Militate in Favor of Bail

The Defense Has Rebutted the Presumption Relating to Certain of the Charges. The
government relies on the statutory presumption of detention applicable to offenses involving
minor victims. (Gov. Mem. at 4-5.) But unlike the position it took with Epstein, the
government does not contend that Ms. Maxwell poses any danger to the community, or that
she suffers from compulsive or addictive sexual proclivities. See United States v. Epstein,
425 F. Supp. 3d 306, 314-15 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Even according to the indictment, Ms.
Maxwell’s alleged participation in offenses involving minors ended in 1997. Here, the only
