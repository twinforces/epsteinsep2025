Case 20-3061, Document 94, 10/08/2020, 2948481, Page10 of 23
Court reviewing Judge Preska’s decision deserve to know nov (iii
ES, 2 post-trial appeal is insufficient.
This Court, therefore, has jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine, because
Judge Nathan’s order is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.
See Will, 546 U.S. at 349.

In its final argument, the government says Ms. Maxwell “fails to explain how
the way the Government obtained the confidential criminal discovery materials at
issue has any bearing on or in any way affects First Amendment principles
governing unsealing decisions in a civil case.” Ans.Br. 19. The government also
claims that Ms. Maxwell “‘is already able to share the essential facts she wishes to
convey under Judge Nathan’s Order.” Ans.Br. 19. Neither contention has merit.

The first contention is a retread of the government’s response to Ms.
Maxwell’s motion to consolidate, in which the government professed not to
understand the relationship between the two cases. Doc. 39, pp 19-21, {J 26-27.
