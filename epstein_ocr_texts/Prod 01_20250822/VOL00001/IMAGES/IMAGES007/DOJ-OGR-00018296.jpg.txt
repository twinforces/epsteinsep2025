LC3Cmax7 Parkinson - cross

1 testimony about this, so I'm just connecting --

2 THE COURT: True, but that doesn't (indiscernible

3 overlapping speech) under the rules of evidence.

4 MR. EVERDELL: Fair enough.

S BY MR. EVERDELL:

6 Q. But you did learn who it was eventually; right?

7 A. True.

8 Q. One more question before we get to the search that we

9 talked about on your direct.

10 Before you met Mr. Epstein in connection with the

11 burglary investigation in October of 2003, I believe you had

12 seen him jogging around Palm Beach before then; is that right?
13 A. No, I think that was after, because I didn't know who he

14 was. I had only been on the force eight months, so I really

15 had no knowledge of him. Never heard the name until the

16 burglary. It's true, I saw him jogging, we'd wave to each

17 other, but really prior to the burglary, I had no idea who it
18 was.

19 Q. Understood. Let's go ahead and talk about the search; all
20 right?
2l A. Yes.
22 Q. So now I am fast forwarding two years and 15 days to
23 October 20th, 2005; correct?
24 Ax. COrr√©ect.
25 Q. And that's the day that you helped execute a search warrant
