proffer—which comprised nothing but old, anonymous,
unconfronted, hearsay accusations—to refuse to set
reasonable bail for Ghislaine Maxwell.

The government stressed the strength of its case in seeking
detention, highlighting the “strength of the Government’s evidence” on
page 1 of its application for detention. Ex.A. For support, the
government made the circular argument that the evidence is strong
because of “the facts set forth in the Indictment.” Jd. at 5. It made the
same argument in the reply. Ex.C at 4 (arguing the case is strong
because “the superseding indictment makes plain” the allegations
against Ms. Maxwell).

Of course, the Indictment is not evidence. See United States v.
Giampino, 680 F.2d 898, 901 n. 3 (2d. Cir. 1982). Every circuit with
published pattern instructions inform juries that they are not to
consider the indictment as evidence. See, e.g., Third Circuit (“An

It is an accusation only. An indictment is not evidence of anything, and
you should not give any weight to the fact that (name) has been indicted
