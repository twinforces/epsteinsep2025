girls by, among other things, helping Epstein to re-
cruit, groom, and ultimately abuse minor victims. The
Indictment further alleges that in or about 2016, Max-
well attempted to cover up her crimes by lying under
oath about her role in Epstein’s scheme.

On July 30, 2020, upon the Government’s applica-
tion, Judge Nathan entered a protective order govern-
ing the parties’ disclosure of information produced to
Maxwell by the Government in discovery in the crimi-
nal case (the “Protective Order’). The Protective Or-
der, among other things, prohibits the use of criminal
discovery materials in civil litigation. Three weeks
later, Maxwell moved to modify the Protective Order
to allow Maxwell to use confidential criminal discovery
materials, which were produced to Maxwell by the
Government, in filings Maxwell intended to submit in
separate civil litigation.

Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s motion on Septem-
ber 2, 2020, holding, among other things, that Maxwell
had failed to establish good cause to modify the Protec-
tive Order and failed to coherently explain how the
criminal discovery materials related to any argument
Maxwell intended to make in the civil litigation.

Maxwell filed a notice of appeal on September 4,
2020.
