Case 20-3061, Document 60,. 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page25 of 58:

Assuming Ms. Maxwell cannot appeal Judge Nathan’s order under the
collateral order doctrine, this Court.should exercise mandamus jurisdiction and.
issue a writ of mandamus directing the district court to modify the protective order
as requested by Ms. Maxwell. E.g:, Wilk v. Am. Med. Ass’n, 635 F.2d 1295, 1298
(7th Cir. 1980) (declining to decide whether the.collateral order applied and instead.
issuing a writ.of mandamus to vacate a district court decision declining to modify
protective order), superseded by rule on other grounds as recognized in Bond v. Utreras,
585 F.3d.1061, 1068 n.4 (7th Cir. 2009); see Pappas, 94 F.3d at.798 (recognizing that
protective orders in criminal.cases “[i]n rare instances . .. might raise-issues
available for review via a petition for-writ of mandamus”).

A-writ of: mandamus issued under the All Writs.Act “‘confine[s] the:court
against which mandamus is'sought to a lawful exercise. of its prescribed
jurisdiction.” Jn re City of N_Y., 607 F.3d 923, 932 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal
quotations omitted). A writ is properly issued when “exceptional circumstances
amount[] toa... clear abuse of discretion.” Jd. (internal quotations omitted).

Three.conditions must exist for'this Court to issue.a writ of mandamus:

(1) the petitioner must demonstrate the right to. issuance of the'writ is clear and
indisputable; (2)she must have no other adequate means to attain the relief

desired; and (3) the issuing court must be satisfied the writ is appropriate. In re
