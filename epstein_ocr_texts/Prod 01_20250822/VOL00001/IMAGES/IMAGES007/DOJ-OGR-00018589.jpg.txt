Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 751 Filed 08/10/22 Page 252 of 261 1413
LC6Cmax7 Meder - direct

1 topless photograph of this victim. We anticipate that the

2 testimony at this trial would be that that person recruited

3 another victim in this case, and I believe we, in advance of

4 trial, that our view that the person in this photograph is a

a victim of the charged conspiracy.

6 In particular, other exhibits which we will offer at

7 trial will show flight logs that will show that this person,

8 the same person with her first and last name, traveled on

9 flights with Maxwell and Epstein when she was 17 years old. As
10 the Court will recall, Mr. Alessi testified that he recalled

11 witnessing the defendant meet the same person and asked her to
12 come to the house and give massages.

13 So the fact that Mr. Epstein had a photograph of this
14 person topless is corroborative of that witness testimony and
15 consistent with the evidence at trial that this person, as a

16 minor, was a victim of the charged conspiracy.

17 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, the fact that this lawyer
18 is just now representing to this Court that this is minor is

19 contrary, one, to the metadata on the photo that shows she was
20 not a minor when this photograph was taken, and two, the
21 testimony of Mr. Alessi that he met her in 2001 or 2002, also
22 when she was not a minor. So to put in evidence a photo that
23 they know is not her of a minor, when there is no charged crime
24 with respect to photography in this case, your Honor, is
25 directly contrary to the evidence as the government knows it
