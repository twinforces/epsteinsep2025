LC3Cmax1 Alessi - cross

1 as you're looking. Thank you.

2 Q. We go down to page 147, which is in the left side there, if
3 we go to line 9.

4 "QO. Now, do you recall that in September of 2002 --

a Q. This is right at the same time that you were breaking into
6 Mr. -- shortly, a year, a year before you broke into

7 Mr. Epstein's house, September of 2002, you and your wife

8 purchased a multifamily residential property at Sequoia Drive

9 in West Palm Beach, that's correct, and the purchase price was
10 $590,000.

11 Do you remember that?

12 A. Yes.

13 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I'm going to object to this

14 because I don't think any of this is inconsistent.

15 THE COURT: Sustained. The answer earlier was that he
16 had sold one of these properties before you add up to the

17 amount you said, so it's not inconsistent. So I'm sustaining
18 the objection.

19 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm getting there, your Honor, because
20 I don't think there was a sale of the property.
21 THE COURT: You can get to that, but otherwise, so
22 far, it's consistent.
23 BY MR. PAGLIUCA:
24 Q. Mr. Alessi, you owned all of these properties in 2003;
25 correct?
