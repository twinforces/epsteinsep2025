ARGUMENT
1. THE APPEAL SHOULD BE DISMISSED FOR LACK OF
JURISDICTION
A. Applicable Law
1. The Collateral Order Doctrine
10. Title 28, United States Code, Section 1291 expressly limits the
jurisdiction of Courts of Appeals to “final decisions of the district courts.” 28
U.S.C. § 1291. “This final judgment rule requires that a party must ordinarily raise
all claims of error in a single appeal following final judgment on the merits. Ina
criminal case[,] the rule prohibits appellate review until conviction and imposition
of sentence.” Flanagan v. United States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (1984) (internal
citations and quotation marks omitted); accord United States v. Aliotta, 199 F.3d
78, 81 (2d Cir. 1999). As the Supreme Court has “long held,” the “policy of
Congress embodied in this statute is inimical to piecemeal appellate review of trial
court decisions which do not terminate the litigation, and . . . this policy is at its
strongest in the field of criminal law.” United States v. Hollywood Motor Car Co.,
