Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page3 of 31
Appellant Ghislaine Maxwellâ€™s Motion for Pretrial Release

Ghislaine Maxwell has a Constitutional right to be able to prepare
effectively for trial. The conditions of her pretrial detention deprive her
of that right. For over 280 days, she has been held in the equivalent of
solitary confinement, in deteriorating health and mental condition from
lack of sleep because she is intentionally awakened every 15 minutes by
lights shined directly into her small cell, inadequate food, the constant
glare of neon light, and intrusive searches, including having hands
forced into her mouth in a squalid facility where COVID has run
rampant. The medical literature is unanimous that such conditions
produce mental deterioration, which prevents her from effective
participation in trial preparation.

Worse, even if Ms. Maxwell were able to be fully alert and
mentally acute, she must review over 2,500,000 prosecution pages on a
gutted computer, which does not have the ability to search, edit, or
print. Because of the pandemic, in-person lawyer visits are risky, so
Ms. Maxwell sees her trial lawyers over a video screen, where she can
review one page of the discovery at a time that is projected on a wall
three feet away.
