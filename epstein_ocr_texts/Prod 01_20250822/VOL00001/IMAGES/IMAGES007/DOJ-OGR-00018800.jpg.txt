LC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross

1 illegal acts. And then if you turn back to 12, 12 says,

2 Epstein's a wealthy financier with a lavish home, wealth, a

3 network of assistants and employees used his resource and

4 influence over a vulnerable minor child to engage ina

a systematic pattern of sexually exploited behavior.

6 I mean, on its terms, it references additional people.
7 And so, on its face, it's not exclusive and I think that puts

8 it in a different position.

9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, with regard to this

10 exhibit, I was simply offering discrete factual paragraphs.

11 THE COURT: Right. But 206 -—- so 206 was the one that
12 we began with. I don't think that paragraph is factually

13 inconsistent with the testimony for precisely the reason I've
14 just indicated.

15 MR. PAGLIUCA: I think we left off with 206.

16 THE COURT: So what's the next paragraph?

17 MR. PAGLIUCA: I mean, I can go through it and tell

18 you all the paragraphs that I'm intending to introduce or

19 ask ——
20 THE COURT: So 206 is not inconsistent. Therefore,
21 the objection is sustained.
22 What's the next paragraph?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, let me look at 206 and hopefully
24 respond to that.
25 THE COURT: That's fine.
