bail in. July 2020,'the défendant filed. a renewed ‘motion forreleasé in. December 2020 in which. the:
defendant proposed.a: “substantially larger bail package” and presented arguments that‘ “cither. were
made at.the initial bail shearing or could. have been. made then.” (Dee. Op. at 1). In. denying that
second application, the:Court found that:the information provided in the Second Bail Motion “only:
‘solidifies the:Court’s view that the;Defendant plainly‘poses a risk of flight and'that no combination,
of conditions can ensure her appearance.” (/d..at 1-2).

On January 1:1, 2021, the defendant filed a notice of. appeal to the Sccond Circuit appealing
the Court’s December 2020 opinion.denying the Second:Bail Motion. (Dkt. No. 113). That appeal.
is pending; the: defendant has. not yet ‘filed her bricfin. support of the appeal.

On ‘February’ 23, 2021, the defendant’ submitted the Third Bail Motion, in.’which. she
proposed. two additional bail conditions to “supplement the .. . bail package she has: already
offered” in, the Second. Bail ‘Motion, (Mot. at 2): (1) renunciation. of the defendant’ s French and.
British, citizenship; and (2) placement, of a. portion.of her and her spouse’s assets in.a, new’ account.
‘to be oversech by: an assct. monitor.

Il. The ‘Court.Does Not Have Jurisdiction. to Grant the Third Bail Motion Because of
the Defendant’s Pending Bail Appeal.

The defendant asks this Court to “reconsider its, carlicr ruling’ ‘and. grant bail under the
‘proposed. conditions”? (Mot. at 4). More specifically, the defendant. asks the Court to, consider the:

“As a general, matter, “the filing .of a notice of appeal is ai cvent of jurisdictional
significance—it confers jurisdiction on. the court of :appeals ‘and.divests the district ‘court of its
control over those. aspects of'the:case involved in the appeal.’” United States: v. Rodgers, 101 F.3d.
247,251 (2d Cir. 1996) (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co.,459 US. 56, 58 (1982)).
“The divestiture of jurisdiction rule . . . is a judicially crafted. rule rooted. in the ‘interest: of judicial
economy, designed. ‘to avoid, corfusioti or ‘waste of time resulting from having the same issues
before:two courts at the same time.’” Rodgers, 101 F.3d at 251 (quoting Wnited States v. Salerno,
868 F:2d 524,540 (2d Cir. 1989)); see also United. States v. Ransom, 866.F.2d 574, 576 (2d Cir.
1989) (deseribing the Gri iges rule as “promot[ing] the orderly conduct-of business in both. the trial.
and appellate courts”).

In. January 2021, the defendant. filed. an appeal from the Court’s December 28, 2020
Opinion and. Order denying her Second Bail-Motion. The defendant’s Third. Bail:Motion-not only
secks reconsideration of the very:issue:presently‘on appeal but docs so by proposing two additional
bail conditions to “supplement” the bail package proposed in the, defendant’s Sccond Bail Motion,
(Mot. at:2, 8), a:package which this Court; considered and. concluded could:not “reasonably.assure
her appearance.” (Dee. Op. at 16). Accordingly, the defendant’s Third Bail.Motioti.also coricerns
bail and is. thus:an “aspect[] of the case involved. in the: appeal.” Rodgers, 10.1. F.3d .at.251. The
