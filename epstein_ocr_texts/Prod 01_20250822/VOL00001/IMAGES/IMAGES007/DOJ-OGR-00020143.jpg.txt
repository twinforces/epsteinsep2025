was the result of the Defendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection. And while the
Defendant’s concerns regarding her spouse’s privacy are not insignificant, she.fails to furnish
any explanation as to why those concerns led her to misrepresent key facts to Pretrial Services
and, by extension, the Court. In sum, the evidence of.a lack of candor is, if anything, stronger
now than in July 2020, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s.représentations to Pretrial
Services were woefully incomplete. That lack of candor raises significant concerns as to
whether the Court has now been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances and as to the
Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of conditions of release.

For the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that the third factor continues to weigh
in favor of detention.

C. Pretrial detention continues ‘to be warranted

In light of the reasons stated above; the Government has again met its burden of
persuasion by “a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant presents a risk of flight.”
English, 629 F.3d at 319 (quoting Mercedes, 254 F.3d at.436). Taking the § 3142(g) factors into
account, the Court concludes that the presumption in favor of detention, the nature and
characteristics of the charged offenses, the weight of the evidence, and the.history and
characteristics of the Defendant all weigh in favor of detention. Along similar lines, the
Government has also:shown, and thé Court concludes for the reasons outlined below, that the
Defendant’s proposed bail package cannot reasonably assure her appearance. Thus, the Court’s
original conclusion that the Defendant poses a flight-risk and that no set.of conditions can
reasonably assure her future appearance.remains unaltered.

As already noted, the Defendant now proposes a $28.5 million bail package, which

includes a $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse
