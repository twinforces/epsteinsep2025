1 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.

2 First of all, we're talking about copies. All of this
3 is copies. And this witness has no personal knowledge about

4 whether the copy he's being shown is a copy from this book or

a) from some other book, number one.

6 THE COURT: Well, just on that, so if he could -- if

7 he's directed to a page in the book and then directed to the

8 exhibit, the A exhibit, he could look and compare and indicate
9 whether he sees any differences.

10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Sure. He could say this looks like a
11 copy from this book. I agree with that.

12 THE COURT: Right. So, Ms. Comey, you will do that.
13 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

14 THE COURT: Do you have way to direct him to the

15 relevant page?

16 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, during the break, I'm happy to
17 take the exhibit, and I will figure out a way to direct him to
18 the relevant page during our break.

19 THE COURT: Okay.
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: I guess, the other -—-- I'm not sure how
21 we're doing this, but it seems to me that foundationally there
22 should be a discussion about the admission of 52 before we're
23 doing these comparatives in front of the jury.
24 THE COURT: I think that's fair enough.
25 Why not do it that way, Ms. Comey?
