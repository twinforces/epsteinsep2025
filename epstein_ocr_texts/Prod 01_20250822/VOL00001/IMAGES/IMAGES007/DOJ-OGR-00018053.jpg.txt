First. of all, we're talking about copies. All of this
iS Copies. And this witness has no personal knowledge about
whether the copy he's being shown is a copy from this. hook. ‘or
from some other book, number one.

he's directed 't6 a page ih ‘the book and then directed to tHe
exhibit, the A exhibit, he could look and compare and indicate

whether hé séés any differences.

copy from this book. I agree with that.

take the exhibit, and I will figure out a way to diréct him to
the relevant. page during our break,

MR. PAGLIUCA: I, guess, the other -- I'm not. sure how
we're doing this, but it seems to me that. foundatidondlly there

should be a discussion, about. the admission, of 52 before we're
