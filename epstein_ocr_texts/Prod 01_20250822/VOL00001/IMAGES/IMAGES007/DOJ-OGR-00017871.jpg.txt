1 narrow question of whether under theory of waiver he told Jane
2 that it would -- testifying would help her in her case.

3 When would you like to do that?

4 MR. PAGLIUCA: How about Friday, your Honor?

a THE COURT: This would be a witness you would call in
6 your case-in-chief?

7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Exactly. So it's at least a week from
8 now, I would imagine. I'm assuming the government has about a
9 week more of testimony, by my review of the witness list.

10 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think that's right. We're
11 unlikely to rest in less than a week from now.

12 THE COURT: So is Friday okay?

13 MR. ROHRBACH: We can respond on Monday, if that's all
14 right.

15 THE COURT: Sure. Great.

16 It will provide some general background on piercing

17 privilege and waiver to the extent that will inform issues

18 beyond the specific.

19 MR. PAGLIUCA: To the extent we can preview the
20 additional issues, we'll get that underway as well so that you
21 have a sense of what may or may not be coming down the road
22 here.
23 THE COURT: Okay. Can I ask, thinking about timing,
24 now that we're where we are, what is your estimate for the
25 trial?
