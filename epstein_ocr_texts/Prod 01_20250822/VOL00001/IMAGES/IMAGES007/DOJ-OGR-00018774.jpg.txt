LC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross

1 Q. Sarah was there to greet you?

2 A. The second time I had gone to Epstein's residence, Maxwell
3 greeted me.

4 MR. PAGLIUCA: If we can direct the witness back to

a the third paragraph, starting with the word "Sarah" after the

6 word "Hungry."

7 THE WITNESS: I see what you're saying.

8 Q. Does this refresh your recollection that, in 2007, you told
9 the FBI that Sarah was there and led her — meaning you —

10 upstairs?

11 A. A lot of it runs together because I had gone there so many
12 times. So I'ma little confused on the timing, because the

13 second time I went to his residence, I did not see Sarah.

14 Q. So isn't it true, though, that that's what you told the FBI
15 in 2007?

16 A. Obviously, because it's here.

17 Q. And you also told them, in 2007, that Sarah placed towels
18 on the massage table; correct?

19 A. Yes, that's what it states.
20 QO. And at this second time, there is no one else there that
21 you have told the FBI about, other than Sarah and Mr. Epstein;
22 COLLEGE ?
23 A. Yes. Maxwell was not brought up.
24 Q. It's also true that Sarah was the person who would call you
25 from New York to schedule massages; correct?
