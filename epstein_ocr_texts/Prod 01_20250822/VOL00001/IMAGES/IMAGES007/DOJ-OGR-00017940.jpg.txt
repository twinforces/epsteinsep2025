Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 747 Filed 08/10/22 Page 67 of 228 743
LC2VMAX2 Rocchio â€” Direct

1 confusing and also causes the most -- the most harm. We know

2 that the more they trusted the individual, then, of course, the
3 more they feel betrayed, the more betrayal there's been. And

4 to the extent that there's betrayal in the relationship, then

5 the individuals are really struggling to a much, much greater

6 degree, often trying to understand what happened, how it

7 happened and why, and what its effect is certainly.

8 MS. POMERANTZ: Nothing further, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

10 We'll take our mid-morning break, members of the jury,
11 about a 15-minute break. Thank you so much.

12 (Jury not present)

13 THE COURT: You may be seated.

14 Matters to take up?

15 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I just wanted to note, the
16 government understood that the Court's opinion excluded Dr.

17 Rocchio's opinion regarding the presence of a third party.

18 We did check the transcript, your Honor. And on page
19 73, I had asked a question about whether there was anything
20 about what you're testifying about here that says that grooming
21 can only be done for the benefit of the person doing the
22 grooming, to which Dr. Rocchio responded, No, there's not. And
23 then your Honor had asked a series of questions relating to the
24 presence of a third party, what the defense has been referring
25 to as grooming by proxy, which is a different subject matter.
