LC6VMAX4 Kate -â€” cross

1 THE COURT: Sustained.

2 Q. And do you recall that it was at that meeting that a

3 request was made for the government to look into your U visa?

4 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection, your Honor.

5 Asked and answered.

6 THE COURT: Sustained.

7 Q. So as you sit here now, you're just going to renew your

8 visa based on exceptionalism and are not going forward with the
9 U visa?

10 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection, your Honor.

11 Asked and answered.

12 THE COURT: Sustained.

13 MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, at this time I would move
14 into evidence, with proper redactions being made, Exhibit K-8
15 and K-10. I have discussed this with the government. They

16 will be appropriately redacted for later publication to the

17 jury.

18 THE COURT: Without objection?

19 MS. POMERANTZ: No objection, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: Defendants's K-8 and K-10 with redactions
al will be admitted. I know K-8 is sealed. Is K-10 also sealed?
22 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, they both should be under
23 sealed.
24 THE COURT: Both are sealed even with redactions
25 because the unredacted material would identify the witness.
