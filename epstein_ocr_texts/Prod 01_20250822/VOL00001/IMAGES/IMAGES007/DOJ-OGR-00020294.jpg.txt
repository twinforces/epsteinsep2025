Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288; Page4 of 30

The Government makes much of the fact that its Indictment is
“speaking.” But speaking or not, an indictment is not a substitute for
evidence'and cannot be ‘used as. proof that the case is strong. If that were
true, then, every single case would be strong because in every case there
is an indictment.

2. Similarly, the “additional charges” do not “strengthen the
evidence against Maxwell” and do not “further ‘support. Judge Nathan’s
detention orders.” Resp.16, n.2. The new charges are allegations, nothing
more. Piling allegation on allegation and then calling it proof does not
make it so. Allegations are not evidence. Moreover, these charges ‘will
require Ms. Maxwell to spend more time with her lawyers, not less, and
further illustrate why bail,is necessary.”

3. Contrary to the Government’s. assertion, “[e]ach witness’s
testimony” is not “corroborated by that of other victim-witnesses.”
Resp.49. The Government continues, to press the false point that the mere

number of accusers provides corroboration for the accusers. To the

'The defense has been forced to asked for a continuance of the July
trial because of the expansion of the conspiracy time period. Ex.O. If the
trial is delayed and Ms. Maxwell is not released on bail, she will be
further prejudiced with the inhumane conditions of confinement and the
inability to aid her defense.
