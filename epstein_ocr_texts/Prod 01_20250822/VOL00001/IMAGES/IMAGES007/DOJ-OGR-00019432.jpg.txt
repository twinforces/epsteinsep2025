Maxwell seeks in this appeal is the ability to make these arguments to Judge Preska.
and Judge Nathan before it’s too late.

Second, to preserve her fundamental constitutional right to a fair trial by an.
impartial jury, Ms. Maxwell intends to move.to stay the unsealing process before.
Judge Preska. Ample authority supports staying a civil case pending ‘resolution of a
related criminal, matter..£.g., Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d

Preska for a stay unless Judge Preska knows all the relevant facts.

In particular, a central consideration in. deciding whether to stay a. civil case.
pending resolution of a.criminal case is “the extent to which the issues in the
criminal. case overlap with those presented in the civil case.” /d. (quoting Trs: of
Plumbers & Pipefitters Nat?l Pension. Fund ». Transworld Mech., Inc., 886 F.Supp.
‘1134, 1139 (S.D.N.Y.1995)). Here, there is‘no question the two cases overlap,
