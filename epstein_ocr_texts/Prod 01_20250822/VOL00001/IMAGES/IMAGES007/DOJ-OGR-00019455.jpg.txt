Case Ca2sec?006464-JGKDGAt Dodifien820 MieeBeegeA72Mehagé 44 of 13
6. The Public Interest

Plaintiff argues that the public interest is best served by allowing her claims to proceed.
(8/27/20 Glassman Ltr., at 5.) Specifically, she contends that the public benefits from civil
litigation when that litigation furnishes the public with information on the torts and crimes of a
wrongdoer. (/d.) Plaintiff further contends that, as her lawsuit is the only civil case currently
being litigated against Maxwell (as any others have been stayed or dismissed), “the continuation
of this last remaining civil avenue can furnish the public with critical information as to defendant
Maxwell’s well known criminal enterprise, how it was operated and all those involved.” (/d.) It
is a mischaracterization of this action, however, to call it the “last remaining civil avenue” for
addressing Maxwell’s alleged misconduct, as, to the extent other civil litigation against Maxwell
has been stayed, it has not been terminated — just as this action, if stayed, would not be ended.
Moreover, as the Government argues, the public interest is also served by protecting the integrity
of criminal proceedings. (See generally 9/4/20 Gov’t Ltr.) Should civil discovery proceed, there
is a risk that the criminal prosecution could be impaired by the premature disclosure of the
testimony of various witnesses or could otherwise be prejudiced. (See id., at 3 (citing Johnson,
2003 WL 21664882, at *2).) On balance, this Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of
granting a stay.

Accordingly, taking all of the relevant factors into account, this Court finds that Maxwell
has met her burden to show that a stay of this action is warranted.

C. The Case Should Be Stayed in Its Entirety.

The Co-Executors, Government, and Plaintiff all agree that, should this Court grant
Maxwell’s request for a stay, the stay should apply to the case in its entirety. Indeed, the
Co-Executors take pains to argue that a partial stay as to only Plaintiff's claims against Maxwell
