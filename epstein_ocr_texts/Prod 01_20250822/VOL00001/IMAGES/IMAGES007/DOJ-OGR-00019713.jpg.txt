Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER

ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a renewed motion for release
on bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and Order concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court
DENIES the Defendant’s motion.
In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential information that
should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 48 hours to propose
any redactions to the Court’s Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by reference to
the Second Circuit’s decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir.
2006). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted,
the Court will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket.
This Order provides the bottom line of the Court’s resolution. On July 14, 2020, this
Court conducted an extensive bail hearing and determined that pre-trial detention was warranted
because the no conditions or set of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s
appearance at future proceedings. Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f), a bail hearing may be reopened if

hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that
will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required.” The Court concludes that
