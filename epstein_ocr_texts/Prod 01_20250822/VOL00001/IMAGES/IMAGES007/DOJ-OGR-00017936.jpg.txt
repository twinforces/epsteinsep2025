1 A. It's very common in both my clinical and forensic work for
2 individuals to tell me that either they had a significant delay
3 in disclosure, and at times in my clinical work sometimes I am
4 the very first person they've ever spoken about the abuse with.
5 Q. To be clear, how common is delayed disclosure in the

6 patients you treat and evaluate in connection with your

7 clinical and forensic practices?

8 A. Very common.

9 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, if an

10 individual was sexually abused as a child, who, if anyone, is
11 that individual most likely to disclose the sexual abuse to?

12 A. If and when they choose to disclose, most often they're

13 going to tell a trusted friend. If we're talking about

14 adolescents, they're going to talk to a peer. If we are

15 talking about adults, a trusted friend. Sometimes, as I

16 alluded to when I said that I'm the first person they tell,

17 sometimes it may be in the context of a therapy setting.

18 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, is an

19 individual who was sexually abused as a child likely to report
20 the abuse to law enforcement?
21 A. No. Unfortunately, we know that rape, sexual assault,
22 childhood sexual abuse, again, they are the most underreported
23 crimes. And law enforcement agencies are actually the least
24 likely group to which an initial report or disclosure is made.
25 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and
