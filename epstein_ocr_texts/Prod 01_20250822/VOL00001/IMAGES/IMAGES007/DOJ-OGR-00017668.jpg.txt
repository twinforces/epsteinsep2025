LE1Qmax2 Jane - Cross

Epstein told you where to sit. She says, "I don't remember."
lt's not an inconsistent statement. That's the difference.
Then you cdn refrésh her on what She Sdid. Bit if what you're
doing is -- right? What's inconsistent about you saying, "You.
said X to ‘the agent," and she says, "I don't remember." Is

that an inconsistency?

MS. MENNINGER! The Statement ‘that she gave yesterday

versus what her statement to the agent that's what I'm trying.

THE COURT: I lét you, do ‘that. I lét you, do ‘that.

Just now the example that drew the objection you said Epstein
didh't == you told the agent you didn't sit néxt to Epstéin and
she said "I don't memember.."

MS. MENNINGER: Okay. $6 TI will show her for that
type of example --

THE GOURT: But I agree with you if you Have a prior
statement ‘that Js inconsistent with testimony, that's when
we're there.

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor and jin that scenario, it's a
question: Did you say that t6 the agent 6n this daté? If not,
showing the witmess the document and asking hen to read Lt into
the record. The question is, did you make that statément.?

MS. MENNINGER: I just asked.

THE GOURT: I agrees I think you did it right up
until this moment, when. we didn't have and inconsistent
statement? We're in vigorous disagreement.
