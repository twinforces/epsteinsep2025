appeal from unsealing of competency evaluation because “any alleged incursions
on criminal defendants’ rights to privacy and a fair trial do not render the unsealing
order effectively unreviewable on appeal”); Hitchcock, 992 F.2d at 238-39 (district
court’s refusal to seal documents not immediately appealable because “[rJeversal

privileged information are not immediately appealable even though they “intrude[]
on the confidentiality of attorney-client communications”).

civil case may result in unfair pretrial publicity in her criminal case, such a concern
is not an issue that is effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.
Indeed, that very issue has been reviewed by this Court in multiple cases on post-
judgment appeal. See, e.g., United States v. Sabhnani, 599 F.3d 215, 232-34 (2d
Cir. 2010) (evaluating on post-judgment appeal whether publicity biased the
venire); United States v. Elfgeeh, 515 F.3d 100, 128-31 (2d Cir. 2008) (evaluating
on post-judgment appeal whether publicity biased trial jurors). Should the Court
determine that the jury at Maxwell’s trial was biased based on disclosure of
material in a civil case, and that such material would not have been unsealed had
Judge Nathan permitted modification of the Protective Order, then vacatur of the
defendant’s conviction — if warranted — will adequately vindicate the defendant’s
