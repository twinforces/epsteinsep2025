MR. EVERDELL: Hér mémory about anything ‘to do with
this time period is net a collateral matter; she is a central
Wleness to this Case:

THE COURT: Well, again, I don"t adopt that broad
statement. But to thé extent ‘you are attempting to impeach --
SQ you have something that contradicts what she testified to on
the stdnd, ‘then it's not a Rule 16 issue, I doubt it's a 613 --
a 608 issue, We may have to deal with 613 questions and what
it is, ‘that we're looking at.

MR, EVERDELL: Again, it's also not a 608 issue, I'd
say, your Honér, because that rule deals with conduct.

THE COURT: I said, it's not a 608 jissue.

MR. EVERDELL: Yes. Okay. I agree with ‘you.

MR. ROHRBACH: L'ma Little confused, your Honor.

I think we're agreeing that, as your Honér said, if
it's offered for impeachment, with a proper basis for
impeachment and it's not about a Collateral matter, then they

didn't have to. disclose it jin Rule 16. If it's to advance the

defense case, whether in the government's case or in the

defense case, then, it should have been, disclosed in Rule 16.

There are things that the defense might expect to

offer for impeachment, but that might be impeachment about a

collateral matter or might be impeachment, but is not, in fact,
based on a contradiction or some other proper theory of
impeachment, in which case it is not an admissible exhibit.
