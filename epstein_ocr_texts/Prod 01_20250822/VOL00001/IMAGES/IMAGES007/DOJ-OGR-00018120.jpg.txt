1 THE COURT: It's a different order than what you gave
2 me.

3 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. We alerted the defense

4 but neglected to alert the Court. We let the defense know

a yesterday that due to some travel issues with the pace of

6 trial, we need to reorder the witnesses. So we will be doing

7 Parkinson, then Dawson, then Maguire, then Meder, then Flatley,
8 and I think that will take us through the end of the day, but

9 if we need to, there are some additional witnesses who we can
10 get to come to the courthouse.

11 THE COURT: Shelling is not today?

12 MR. EVERDELL: We stipped to --

13 MS. COMEY: We stipulated to Shelling.

14 THE COURT: So Parkinson, Dawson, Maguire.

15 MS. COMEY: Correct, your Honor.

16 THE COURT: Meder or Flatley?

17 MS. COMEY: Meder, then Flatley.

18 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, if you want, we can take up
19 the issue of Maguire later if you prefer because I don't think
20 she'll go on until after lunch, most likely.
21 MS. COMEY: I think that's very likely.
22 THE COURT: Let me just see if we have a note that we
23 have all our jurors. Until we have all our jurors, I'll take
24 it up.
25 MR. EVERDELL: My understanding, your Honor, Kelly
