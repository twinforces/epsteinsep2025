1 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think it depends on the

2 length of cross-examination for some of the more substantial

3 witnesses. If we can expect about the same length as we have

4 with Jane today, I expect we'll be able to rest the third week
a) of trial. So not next week, but the week after, early that

6 week is my best estimate.

7 THE COURT: And what's the defense's best estimate?

8 MS. STERNHEIM: We'll let you know.

9 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm going to suspect the length of

10 cross-examination will be less for the remaining witnesses.

11 THE COURT: We worked out some —-—

12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Kinks, yes.

13 But I just think substantively it's likely to be less,
14 and there's likely -- well, with the exception of one, there's
15 less 3500 impeachment material that needs to be gone through
16 potentially, so I think that will shorten the length of

17 cross-examination. And we will have whatever we need to have
18 ready to go, understanding the format we're doing this in now.
19 THE COURT: All right. See you in the morning.
