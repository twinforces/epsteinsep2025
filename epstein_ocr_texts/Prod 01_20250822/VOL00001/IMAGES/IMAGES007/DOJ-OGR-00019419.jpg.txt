Case 20-3061, Document 60,. 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page20:of 58:

The government’s contentions to the contrary rely on two easily
distinguishable.cases and misunderstand Ms. Maxwell’s arguments. Start with the
two cases on, which the government relies. Doe. 37, p.11 (citing United States v.
Caparros, 800 F.2d. 23, 24 (2d Cir. 1986); United States v. Pappas, 94 F.3d 795, 798
(2d Cir. 1996)). According to the government, Caparros and Pappas hold that
“protective orders regulating the use of documents exchanged by the parties
during a criminal case are not subject to interlocutory appeal.” Doc. 37, p 11. That
is not correct.

In Caparros, this Court dismissed an appeal ofa protective order issued ina
criminal case preventing the defendant from making public certain documents
allegedly concerning public safety. 800 F.2d at 23-24. According to the defendant,
the prohibition on public disclosure was.an unconstitutional prior restraint of
speech../d. at 24. This Court dismissed the appeal because it did not satisfy the
three conditions precedent to interlocutory review, in particular the requirement
that the issue must be effectively unreviewable on,appeal from a final judgment. Jd.
at 24-26. Said the Court:

[The issue] will not become moot on conviction and sentence or on

acquittal because the order will have continuing prohibitive effect

thereafter and the purported right.to publish the documents, to the

extent it now exists, will also continue. This is not a situation where an
order, to be reviewed at.all, must be-reviewed before the proceedings
