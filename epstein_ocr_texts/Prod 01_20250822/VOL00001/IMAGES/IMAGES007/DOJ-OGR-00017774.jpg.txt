LC1VMAX5 Jane -â€” cross

1 MS. MOE: Thank you.

2 THE COURT: Ms. Menninger, is that getting at what you
3 are suggesting?

4 MS. MENNINGER: It is. I believe that he also

a communicated that testifying would benefit her in the criminal
6 case.

7 THE COURT: Okay.

8 MS. MENNINGER: And so I'm not privy to whether, you

9 know, at what point in time --

10 THE COURT: How about did you ever have an

11 understanding that any cooperation with the government,

12 including testifying in this trial, would aid you in any way in
13 your efforts to recover in the then-pending civil litigation?
14 Does that get at it, Ms. Menninger? I'm not disputing that you
15 should ask the question. I agree with Ms. Moe there's points
16 for confusion, so let's just --

17 MS. MENNINGER: I think it does, your Honor.

18 I would have to kind of -- I would like to just write
19 out the question so I understand. But I do think, as I
20 mentioned a little bit earlier, because the civil litigation
21 morphed into the victims' comp fund, there may be a similar
22 question with respect to the comp fund. But I think I can
23 draft this language and we could -- I can tell your Honor what
24 it is in just a minute.
25 THE COURT: Okay.
