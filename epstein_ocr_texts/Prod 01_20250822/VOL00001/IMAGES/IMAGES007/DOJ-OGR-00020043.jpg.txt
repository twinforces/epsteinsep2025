The government argued to the Court that defense counsel’s contact with the
prosecutors in the months leading up:to Ms. Maxwell’s arrest prove little about her intent to
stay in this country simply because she never disclosed her location. (Tr. 26). While Ms.
Maxwell was understandably not in the habit of volunteering her whereabouts given the
intensity of the press attention, her counsel would have provided that information had the
government asked for it. The. government never did.

3. Ms. Maxwell Did Not Try to Avoid Arrest, Nor Was She “Good At”
Hiding

Similarly, had the government reached. out to defense counsel before Ms..Maxwell’s
atrest, we would. have willingly arranged for her self-surrender. We were never given that
chance. Instead, the government arrested her in.a totally unnecessary early moming raid
with multiple federal agents at-her.residence in New Hampshire, on the eve. of the one-year
anniversary of the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein, creating the misimpression that Ms. Maxwell
was hiding from them. That is:simply not the case.

The government argued that the events of Ms. Maxwell’s arrest—in particular, that
she: moved herself into an interior room, when the officers approached the house and that
they: found a cell phone:wrapped in tin foil—evidence. an attempt to:evade.law enforcement.
(Tr. 32-34). As we previously explained to the Court, Ms. Maxwell was protecting herself
from the press, not trying to avoid arrest. (Tr. 54-57).

Since the.hearing, we have obtained.the accompanying statement from [|
| the head of the: security company guarding Ms. Maxwell at the time of her arrest,
which was not available at the time of the initial hearing. (Ex.S).[/____| statement
demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell was not:avoiding arrest; but was following an agreed-upon

procedure to protect herself in the-event of.a potential threat to her safety or security.
