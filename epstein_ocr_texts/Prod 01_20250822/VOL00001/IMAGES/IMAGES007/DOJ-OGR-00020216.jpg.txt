Doc. 284 at 2-3. Mr. Robertson has met his burden of production and has rebutted the presumption
in § 3142(e)(3)(B) that no condition or combination of conditions could meet the requirements for
his release.

Section 3142(g) then lays out the following factors for courts to consider: (1) the nature
and circumstances of the offense charged, including whether the offense is a crime of violence, a

The Court finds that although some of these factors weigh against Mr. Robertson’s release,
they do not foreclose relief under the strict conditions the Court has imposed. With regard to the
nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, they are extremely serious and involve Mr.

criminal justice system.

With regard to the weight of the evidence against Mr. Robertson, it is mixed. On the one
hand, D.S. positively identified Mr. Robertson as the person who shot him and at least one other
witness, N.F., has testified that Mr. Robertson made incriminating statements in the weeks prior
to the shooting. On the other hand, it appears that there were many people present at the time and
place of the shooting and there is evidence that D.S.’s identification of Mr. Robertson could have
