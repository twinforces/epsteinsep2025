Re: United States'v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr.,330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

defendant’: S. conditions of confinement at'the Metropolitan, Detention Center (<M DC”) pursuant to
the Court’s Order dated August 25, 2020. (Dkt. No. 49). Over the ‘past three ‘months, the
Government has had. multiplé conversations. with MDC legal counsel. regarding, the defendant’s
conditions of confinement. This ‘update is. based on information provided to the Government. by:
MDC legal, during-those conversations.

Last '‘weck,.a. staff member who was assigned. to work in the arca of the MDC where the
defendant. is housed tested positive for COVID-19. In:response,' the MDC.implemented the same
quarantine protocols. that apply whenever an inmate: has potentially been exposed to the virus.
Specifically, on November .18, 2020, the defendant was tested for COVID-19 using a. rapid ‘test,
which was negative. That same day, the defendant was placed. in quarantine. As with any other
quarantined ‘inmate, the defendant will remain, in quarantine for fourtecn days, at which point; she:
will be tested again for COVID-19. If that test. is ticgative, she will then be released from.
quarantine. To date, the defendant has fot exhibited ary symptoms. of COVID-19.

During her time in quarantine, the defendant’will’be housed in,the same:cell where she was
already housed. before. she was placed.in quarantine, and medical. staff and psychology staff will.
continue to cheek on.the defendant every day. Like all other MDC inmates in, quarantine, the
defendant, will be permitted out of her cell three days per week ‘for thirty minutes. During that
time, the: defendant may: shower, make personal phone calls, and use the CorrLinks email system.
In addition, the defendant will continue to be: permitted to make legal calls every day for up to
three hours’per day.. These calls will take place in.a, room where the defendant:is alone and-where
no MDE staff can hear her communications with counsel.

On November 18,.2020, the Government provided'the MDC with.alaptop forthe:defendant

to use ‘to review discovery. During quarantine, ‘the defendant. has been and ‘will continue to be
permitted.to use that laptop in her isolation, cell to:review her discovery for thirteen‘hours per day,
