criminal case before Judge Nathan. (A. 93-94).
D. Judge Nathan’s Order

On September 2, 2020, Judge Nathan issued the
Order denying Maxwell’s motion. (A. 99-103). In that
Order, Judge Nathan noted that despite “fourteen-sin-
gle spaced pages of heated rhetoric,” Maxwell had of-
fered “no more than vague, speculative, and conclusory
assertions” regarding why the criminal discovery ma-
terials were necessary to fair adjudication of her civil
cases. (A. 101). Judge Nathan concluded that absent
any “coherent explanation” of how the criminal discov-
ery materials related to any argument Maxwell in-
tended to make in civil litigation, Maxwell had
“plainly” failed to establish good cause to modify the
Protective Order. (A. 101). Further, Judge Nathan
noted that the basic facts Maxwell sought to introduce
in civil litigation were already made public through
the Government’s letter in opposition to her motion.
(A. 101-02). Accordingly, even though Judge Nathan
“remain|[ed] in the dark as to why this information will
be relevant” to the courts adjudicating the civil cases,
Judge Nathan expressly permitted Maxwell to inform
the tribunals overseeing her civil cases, under seal, of
the basic factual background regarding the confiden-
tial criminal discovery materials at issue. (A. 101-02).
E. Maxwell’s Appeal of the Order

On September 4, 2020, Maxwell filed a notice of ap-
peal from the Order. (A. 121-23). On September 10,
2020, Maxwell filed a motion to consolidate this appeal
