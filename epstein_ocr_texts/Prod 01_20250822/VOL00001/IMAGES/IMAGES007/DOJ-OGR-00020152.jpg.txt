INTRODUCTION

Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully'submits this Memorandum in. Support of her Third.
Motion for Release on Bail.

As Ms. Maxwell has stated on numcrous occasions and reaffirms here: she has no,
‘intention or desire to Icave this country. She is an.Amcrican citizen, has lived:in United. States
for 30 ycars, has strong family ties and the support of friends and, family residing in, this country.
She wants nothing moré than to remain ‘in the United States under whatever conditions ‘the Court
deems necessary so that she:can effectively prepare for trial and.vigorously defend.against:the
25-year-old charges. in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell has, already proposed ‘an. expansive ‘and, to
‘our Knowledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions:that'would reasonably assure her
appearance. (See Dkt. 97.) ‘In light of the Court’s denial ‘of that application (see Dkt. 106), Ms.
‘Maxwell now‘proposes two additional, bail. conditions to supplement the extraordinarily
‘restrictive bail package she has already offered.

© First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship. to climinate
any opportunity for her to seck refuge in those countrics, if the Court:so requires.

© Second, Ms. Maxwell will have: her and. her spouse’*s asscts—excluding ‘funds
carmarkeéd for living expenses, ‘for legal. fees and other expenses necessary to
defend her against the criminal charges in. this case and related. civil lawsuits and
for taxcs—placed iin, a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal
‘District Court judge and, former United States Attorney who will, function as: assct:
‘monitor and ‘will, have co-signing authority over the account.

The former condition goes well beyond the:cxtradition waivers that the Court deemed
‘insufficient and should satisfy any concerns the: Court:may’ have that Ms. Maxwell may try to
eck a'safe haven.in France or the United Kingdom. (Sée id. at 11-13). As a non-citizen, Ms.

Maxwell will not be able to:avail’hersclf of any*protections against extradition that: may: apply to:
