Case 20-3061, Document 16, 09/10/2020, 2928287, Page3 of 5
Judge Nathan refusing to modify a criminal protective order. The civil case
addresses an order by Judge Preska unsealing certain deposition material.

Among other arguments for consolidation of the two appeals, Ms. Maxwell
contends that she should be permitted to share with Judge Preska critical
information Ms. Maxwell learned from Judge Nathan.

But the protective order issued by Judge Nathan prevents Ms. Maxwell from
disclosing this information to Judge Preska or from telling this Court about the
information in the civil appeal. By contrast, the protective order allows Ms.
Maxwell to tell this Court about the information in the criminal appeal, though only
under seal since it is confidential and sealed in the district court criminal case.

Ms. Maxwell’s Unredacted Motion to Consolidate explains this situation
and describes the critical information. But to comply with criminal protective
order, Ms. Maxwell can file an unredacted copy of the Motion to Consolidate only
under seal with this Court, and then only in the criminal appeal, Case No. 20-3061.

Therefore, in compliance with the criminal protective order, Ms. Maxwell
will publicly file on ECF a redacted copy of the Motion to Consolidate in both
appeals along with all but one of the exhibits — Exhibit B, which was filed under seal
in the district court.
