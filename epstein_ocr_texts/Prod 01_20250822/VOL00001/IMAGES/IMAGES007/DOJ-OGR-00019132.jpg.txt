doesn't e@xceéd the scope of the ordinary practice.

THE COURT: Let's take the specific example that
you'vé given on message pads. So just give me an example of
the kind ef testimony he would provide there,

MS. MOE? Yes, your Honor.

So, for example, within the message pads, we’ published
yesterday, I think, just either two or three specific messages

that had a first and last name of someone and a phone number.

But élsewhere throughout the message pads, there appear entries
that only have a first name, and sometimes that entry is, for
example, Garolyh and sonmietimes it's Caroline. But whén you
compare the phone numbers. -- and there are a variety of
different phone numbers throughout the bodk == it. becomes cléar
that, Caroline is the same Carolyn, first. and last mame, as some

of the other messages, because there's continuity between thé

phone numbers.

And there are a variety 6f different phorie numbers
throughout the exhibits with different mames like Carolyn,
Caroline, and Carélyn with a last namé. And reviewing them and
analyzing them makes it clear throughout, the books and across a
variety of different dates that we're talking about the same
person. And so that facilitates both publishing the exhibits
86 that the jury Gah see them for the first tame, and doing
thdt in a way that sort of connects up those different
exhibits. And so that's the purpose of that testimony.
