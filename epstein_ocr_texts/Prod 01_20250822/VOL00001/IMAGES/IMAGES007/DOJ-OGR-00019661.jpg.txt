The collateral order doctrine is, admittedly, the exception and not the rule.
Its purpose is to avoid delay and piecemeal appeals.* But it’s not as inflexible as the
government suggests, and its application is not oblivious to reality. It is a practical
doctrine that exists for those few cases in which a post-trial appeal is inadequate to
the task and the issue for immediate appeal is separable from the merits. This
appeal, novel as it is, falls within those parameters.°

* Although the government says it “remains to be seen” whether this appeal
will delay the criminal case, it offers no specifics or even speculation about how
such a delay might be occasioned. Ans.Br. 19 n.5. To be clear, this appeal has
nothing to do with the merits of the government’s allegations against Ms. Maxwell,
and it will not delay the criminal trial.

> As for Ms. Maxwell’s alternative request that this Court exercise
mandamus jurisdiction, the government’s brief denies that Judge Nathan abused
her discretion but doesn’t otherwise contend that this Court may exercise
mandamus jurisdiction. Ans.Br. 20-21. Because, as explained below, Judge Nathan
abused her discretion, this Court should issue a writ of mandamus if it concludes
that it lacks jurisdiction under the collateral order doctrine.
