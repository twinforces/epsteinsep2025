Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page23 of 31

Recognizing this weakness, the Government relies on the
statutory maximum penalty to argue that the case is serious and that
Ms. Maxwell poses a risk of flight. But the statutory maximum is
hardly relevant to determine risk of flight. In the vast majority of
federal cases, the statutory maximum penalties are sky-high and are
not reflective of the real potential penalties. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 1658(b)
(statutory maximum of life imprisonment for turning off a light in a
lighthouse to expose a ship to danger).

Even if there were evidence to back up the four anonymous
accusers, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of the
commission of a serious crime and the fact of a potential long sentence
to support a finding of risk of flight.” United States v. Friedman, 837
F.2d 48, 49-50 (2d. Cir. 1988) (district court’s finding that defendant
posed a risk of flight was clearly erroneous, despite potential for “long
sentence of incarceration’); Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing
detention order where defendants agreed to significant physical and
financial restrictions, despite the fact that they faced a “lengthy term of
incarceration’).
