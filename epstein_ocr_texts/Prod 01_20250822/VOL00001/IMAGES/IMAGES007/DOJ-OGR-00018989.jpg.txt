LC8VMAX4 Rodgers - direct

1 the -- for example -- sometimes, for example, it said just

2 Carolyn, so that doesn't need to be redacted at all. In other
3 instances, the last name would need to be redacted.

4 MS. COMEY: So, your Honor, the thinking was that

S there's phone numbers for not only Carolyn, but also a number
6 of third parties.

7 THE COURT: We could do redactions of the last four,
8 for example. Again, I understand it's labor, but do it now or
9 do it later and, it seems to me, better to do it now.

10 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

11 May we have the long weekend coming up as well to

12 complete those redactions please?

13 THE COURT: Yes.

14 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.

15 MR. EVERDELL: One other choreography point just for
16 purposes of cross, we do have folders for the jury. I could
17 put it under their chairs now, as long as they are instructed
18 not to Look at them.

19 MS. COMEY: No objection.
20 THE COURT: Okay.
al Have you looked at the in limine instruction?
22 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, the government has no objection.
23 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, actually if we could take
24 that up when we return from the lunch break.
25 THE COURT: Okay. That's fine.
