1 accurately about?

2 MS. STERNHEIM: Well, at first she wasn't sure. And

3 then when she saw it, she didn't deny it. But I think that it
4 is a recording of her own email. There is no issue as to

a authenticity.

6 THE COURT: It's not an authenticity objection; it's a
7 hearsay objection.

8 Again, I think her testimony would be described as she
9 recalled it well enough to testify fully and accurately because
10 it doesn't conflict with what's in here. So it's not the same
11 analysis as prior inconsistent statement, but I think the

12 initial question is what did she not testify to fully and

13 accurately.

14 MS. STERNHEIM: I just think it is corroborative of

15 her testimony and more reliable than just coming from the stand
16 when it is her own written statement to the co-conspirator in
17 this case.

18 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, that's not responsive to
19 the question. And also, as the Court has noted, it just
20 doesn't meet the standard that's articulated under 5A in terms
al of the question is whether it's on a matter that the witness
22 once knew about, but now cannot recall well enough to testify
23 fully and accurately. And that's just not the case here, your
24 Honor.
25 THE COURT: Okay.
