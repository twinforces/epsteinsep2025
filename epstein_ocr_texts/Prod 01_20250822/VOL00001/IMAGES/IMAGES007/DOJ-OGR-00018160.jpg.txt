LC3KMAX2 Alessi - Cross
1 (At the sidebar)
2 THE COURT: Let's just set the stage. The testimony
3 yesterday said "multiple occasions with her mother, some
4 occasions without the mother; in those instances, he would pick
5 her up and drive her."
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Okay.
7 THE COURT: You agree that is the testimony?
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Generally, yes.
9 On line 9, we have: "I personally observed Jane along
10 with her mother on three occasions, not multiple occasions."
11 THE COURT: "Three" is not "multiple"?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Not in my view, your Honor. It is
13 inconsistent with "multiple."
14 At Mr. Epstein's —-
15 THE COURT: I don't understand —-—
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: It is more than one.
17 THE COURT: So is "multiple."
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, I understand.
19 THE COURT: I mean, unless we're speaking a different
20 language.
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: We may be, but this is quantifying the
22 number. It's not multiple, it's three.
23 "At Mr. Epstein'ts home in Palm Beach. I don't recall
24 the year," which is also inconsistent with his testimony
25 yesterday.
