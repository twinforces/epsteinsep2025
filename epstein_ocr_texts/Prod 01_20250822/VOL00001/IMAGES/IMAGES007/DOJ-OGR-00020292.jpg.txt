Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288; Page2 of 30

Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell’s Reply in Support of Her
Motion for Pretrial Release

The Government’s Response underscores why this Court. should
order bail for Ghislaine Maxwell so that, she can prepare for trial. The
court below erred in accepting the Government’s conclusory proffer
without any actual evidence. And the conditions of her confinement make
it impossible for her to effectively prepare her defense. The Government
proposed bail package demonstrates. that she is not a risk of flight.
Accordingly, she should be released on bail.

At the very least, this matter should be remanded to the district
court to conduct a real bail hearing to (1) test the actual strength of the
Government’s case, and (2) determine whether Ms. Maxwell should be
granted temporary release so that she can effectively prepare for trial,
which she cannot do under the current conditions of confinement.

Relying almost entirely on a regurgitation of quotations from the
lower court (the first 26 of the 43-paragraph pleading is labeled “Facts”),
only ten paragraphs, labeled “Discussion,” even attempt to address Ms.
Maxwell’s arguments. As muchas the Government would prefer that Ms.

Maxwell not have a fair fight, this Court. must level the playing field so
