1 (Trial resumed; jury not present)

2 THE COURT: All right. Matters to take up.

3 MS. COMEY: There were just a couple issues that we

4 wanted to put on the record, your Honor.

S First, I've conferred with defense counsel, and they

6 have indicated that they are releasing Carolyn from recall. So
7 I understand that any sequestration order no longer applies to
8 her.

9 MR. PAGLIUCA: That's correct, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

11 MS. COMEY: And then I also conferred with defense

12 counsel about Kimberly Meder and whether she would be permitted
13 to be in the courtroom for the remainder of trial. I'm told by
14 defense counsel that they have no objection; though, of course,
15 they may end up seeking to recall her in the defense case, but
16 that they have no objection to her being in the courtroom.

17 MR. EVERDELL: That's correct, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: Okay.

19 MS. COMEY: And then with respect to redacted 296,
20 which was the video of the Palm Beach residence, defense
21 counsel has been reviewing the redacted version that we sent
22 them on Tuesday. Once they have their position on its
23 admissibility, we will formally offer it.
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Also correct, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: Great. Okay. Thank you.
