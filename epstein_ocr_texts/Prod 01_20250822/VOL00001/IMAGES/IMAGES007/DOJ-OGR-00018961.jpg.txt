1 Q. It's a fair statement that the vast majority of the

2 messages in these exhibits are for Mr. Epstein; correct?

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. And at the time that -- well, let me back up.

5 Many of these messages do not have dates or times on
6 them; correct?

7 A. I see a lot that do. On this page it does, yeah.

8 Q. And then there's a number that don't, right?

9 A. Yes.

10 Q. And again, you don't have any personal knowledge about the
11 accuracy of any of these messages, just that somebody wrote

12 down a message to Mr. Epstein generally in these message pads;
13 correct?

14 A. The ones I wrote are accurate.

15 Q. I understand. I'm not questioning your recording accuracy,
16 Mrs. Hesse. But all I'm talking about is the ones that you

17 didn't write.

18 A. Mm-hmm.

19 Q. OK?
20 And to my understanding, the only time you would be
al taking messages would be when you were at the residence when
22 Mr. Epstein wasn't there?
23 A. That's correct.
24 QO. Okay.
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Tf I could have a moment, your Honor.
