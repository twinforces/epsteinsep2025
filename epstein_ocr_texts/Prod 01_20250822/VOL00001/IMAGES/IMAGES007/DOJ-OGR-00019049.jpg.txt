LC8VMAX6 Rodgers â€”- cross

1 A. That is correct.

2 Q. But sitting here today, if your logbook entries reflect one
3 male or one female or one passenger, you don't know who that

4 person is who you indicated as that one male, one female, one

5 passenger, right?

6 A. That is correct.

7 Q. Okay. So you would have no way of knowing today what the

8 actual name of that person was on those flights where those are
9 indicated?
10 A. No.
11 Q. Okay. Now, in keeping your logbook and your manifests,
12 obviously if you knew who the person was and you recognized
13 them from before, you would put their names in the manifest,
14 right?
15 A. Correct.
16 Q. And your practice, I think, was if you knew the name of the
17 person because they flew a lot, you might just enter their
18 initials in your logbook because it saved space, right?
19 A. That's correct.
20 Q. Okay. So if we see initials in your logbook, that reflects
21 that it's someone who flew several times on Epstein's planes
22 that you recognized, right?
23 A. Correct.
24 Q. Okay. So, for example, there are numerous examples of the
25 initials SK in the logbook, right?
