LC8Cmax3 Hesse â€” direct

1 Q. Mrs. Hesse, do you recognize Government Exhibit 115?

2 A. Yes, I do.

3 Q. What is it?

4 A. It's a picture of Ghislaine Maxwell.

a) MS. MOB: Thank you, Ms. Drescher. We can take that

6 down.

7 Q. Mrs. Hesse, can you tell us, what do you remember about

8 what the house in Palm Beach looked like?

9 A. It's a big home and I believe it to be white. The hedges
10 are all manicured. And large kitchen with an island. It's a
11 two-story home. I remember the stairwell going up. It was on
12 the water. It was like a pool and a patio area. And a guest
13 home off to the left.

14 Q. When you worked there, who gave you directions about what
15 to do at the house?
16 A. Ghislaine Maxwell.
17 Q. What were your job responsibilities?
18 A. Basically, if anything was broken in the house, like if the
19 air conditioner didn't work, I would call the AC guy and things
20 like that, just any maintenance. And I was there when the
21 housekeeper was there, I would open the door for her and let
22 her in and stuff.
23 Q. When you worked for Epstein and Maxwell in Palm Beach, did
24 you receive any instructions about what to do if someone called
25 the house?
