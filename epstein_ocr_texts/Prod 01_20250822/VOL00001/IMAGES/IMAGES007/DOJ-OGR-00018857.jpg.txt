MS. MOE! Your Honor, I havé no issue with reaching
out te Jane's attorney to remind him, again, about that issue’.
Happy 'to do that tHis, evening.

With respect to outstanding defense subpoenas, since
we're talking dabotit this issué, my understanding at this
juncture is, because the witness identified as Matt has now
testified, the witness identified as Brian, is, no longér
testifying, that there will be no additional prior consistent
stdtéments with respéct to Jane. We want 'to confirm that. the
defense is not seeking to recall Jane regarding any prior
consistent statements so that. she can be released for recall.

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, we would Like to just
think about it tonight and can cérta@inly let the Court knoéw
tomerrow.

THE GOURT: Okay:

MS. MOE: Thank you, ‘your Honor.

THE COURT: I'll ask you to Confer and if it's an

issue, raise it in, the morning. Thank, you, for raising it,

MS. MOE: Thank you.

you.
