1 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I have no issue with reaching

2 out to Jane's attorney to remind him, again, about that issue.
3 Happy to do that this evening.

4 With respect to outstanding defense subpoenas, since
a we're talking about this issue, my understanding at this

6 juncture is, because the witness identified as Matt has now

7 testified, the witness identified as Brian is no longer

8 testifying, that there will be no additional prior consistent
9 statements with respect to Jane. We want to confirm that the
10 defense is not seeking to recall Jane regarding any prior

11 consistent statements so that she can be released for recall.
12 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, we would like to just

13 think about it tonight and can certainly let the Court know

14 tomorrow.

15 THE COURT: Okay.

16 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: I'll ask you to confer and if it's an

18 issue, raise it in the morning. Thank you for raising it,

19 Ms. Moe.
20 MS. MOE: Thank you.
21 THE COURT: Any other matters?
22 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank
23 you.
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: I just needed to make a record on the
25 objections. I can do that tomorrow if the Court wants me to,
