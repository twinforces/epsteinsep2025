LC6Cmax7 Meder - direct

1 THE COURT: They are what were found in the Epstein

2 home.

3 MS. MENNINGER: They could be altered documents found
4 within his home, but they're being offered for the truth of the
5 matter in the photograph, that is that there was a close

6 relationship between the two of them, as the government just

7 argued.

8 THE COURT: Overruled.

9 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, with respect to the next
10 document, it doesn't show any relationship. It's a single

11 person.

12 THE COURT: Overruled. It's found in the home of

13 Mr. Epstein.

14 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, with respect to other

15 individuals who haven't testified about the dates on which

16 these photographs were taken or the ages at which they were

17 taken, I don't think that there has been any foundation lead to
18 show that those individuals -- that the photographs are what

19 they purport to be. As I said, they came from a photo shop
20 document file, which means they are, in fact, in a program that
21 is meant to alter photographs.
22 THE COURT: Overruled.
23 MS. MENNINGER: And with respect to the totality of
24 them, your Honor, there is a cumulativeness problem. You don't
25 need 20 photographs to say what two might just as well say.
