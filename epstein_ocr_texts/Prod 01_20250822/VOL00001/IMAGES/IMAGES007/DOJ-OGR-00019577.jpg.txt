The government does not-explain, because they cannot, how it will harm.an ongoing criminal
investigation to:reveal the scaled materials under seal to'two arbiters:

Clearly those judicial officers are fully.
capable of maintaining files under scal and confidences.. Nor is there any support for the
argument.that this limitéd request will “perinit dissemination of a vast swath of materials.”
Resp. at 3. The slippery slopé-contention:is belied by the limited naturé of: Ms. Maxwell’s
request. The scaled :materials are a discrete :sct. of judicial documents, not a “‘vast:swath of
materials,” and. Ms. Maxwell seeks to file them under seal for those Courts to use jin, their
determinations. Hyperbole aside, the request is appropriately ‘limited.

Further, the government’s suggestion that “there is:rio impediment to counsel. making sealed
applications to Court-1 and Court-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials” is, at best,
baffling. Resp. at 3.n.5., Such.a “sealed application”  in.furtherance of her Civil, Litigation would
be’ “using” the: materials for the civil case, exactly the conduct. proscribed by the Protective Order
here. If the Court disagrees, Ms. Maxwell. is:more than happy to make :such-scaled applications
to those judicial officers. The government does not. explain its thinking, nor did, the government
suggest this course of-action. during the. conferral process.

Fourth, the government: decries the sealed materials’ lack: of relevance |

= Ms. Maxwell strenuously opposes the government’s suggestion.that:it”“further ‘elaborate on-the nature of the
‘ongoing: grand jury‘investigation” in-a supplemental ex. parfe:and scaled pleading. This Court is oversecing:the
‘criminal case pertaining:to Ms. Maxwell and any: ex parte pleading conceming:this:case‘to this judicial officer. is
inappropriate. ‘Se’ Standard.3-3.3 Relationship with Courts, Defense:Counsel and Others, “Criminal Justice
