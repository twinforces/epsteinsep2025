The government does not explain, because they cannot, how it will harm an ongoing criminal
investigation to reveal the sealed materials under seal to two arbiters: 3x
ES Clearly those judicial officers are fully
capable of maintaining files under seal and confidences. Nor is there any support for the
argument that this limited request will “permit dissemination of a vast swath of materials.”
Resp. at 3. The slippery slope contention is belied by the limited nature of Ms. Maxwell’s
request. The sealed materials are a discrete set of judicial documents, not a “vast swath of
materials,” and Ms. Maxwell seeks to file them under seal for those Courts to use in their
determinations. Hyperbole aside, the request is appropriately limited.
Further, the government’s suggestion that “there is no impediment to counsel making sealed
applications to Court-1 and Court-2, respectively, to unseal the relevant materials” is, at best,
baffling. Resp. at 3 n.5. Such a “sealed application” in furtherance of her Civil Litigation would
be “using” the materials for the civil case, exactly the conduct proscribed by the Protective Order
here. If the Court disagrees, Ms. Maxwell is more than happy to make such sealed applications
to those judicial officers. The government does not explain its thinking, nor did the government
suggest this course of action during the conferral process.

2 Ms. Maxwell strenuously opposes the government’s suggestion that it “further elaborate on the nature of the
ongoing grand jury investigation” in a supplemental ex parte and sealed pleading. This Court is overseeing the
criminal case pertaining to Ms. Maxwell and any ex parte pleading concerning this case to this judicial officer is
inappropriate. See Standard 3-3.3 Relationship with Courts, Defense Counsel and Others, “Criminal Justice
Standards for the Prosecution Function,” American Bar Ass’n (4" ed. 2017) (“A prosecutor should not engage in
unauthorized ex parte discussions with, or submission of material to, a judge relating to a particular matter which is,
or is likely to be, before the judge.”).
