the media even when a bounty was.offered for her location:and‘when numerous media outlets were
searching for her.

The charts, graphs, and affidavits proffered by the defense do not:undercut'the defendant’s
‘skill, at. cvading detection, and do nothing more than, restate'the justification for those ‘actions ‘that;
the defense already made, at. the prior hearing. (See Dkt! 18 at 14-16). That said, there. is still
reason to: believe that the defendant ‘was hiding: not just from. the press, but: also from, law
enforcement. It ‘is ‘undisputed that: defense counsel, even while in. contact ‘with the Government,
never disclosed. the defendant’s location ‘or offered her surrender.if'she were to be charged. (Tr.
53-54). The Court already inquired. about defense counscl’s interactions with the Government. in
the ‘year leading up to, the défendant’s arrest, and.the Renewed Bail Application offers nothing new
‘on that score. (/d.). Defense counsel contacted:the Government:when. the FBI attempted to serve
the defendant’with a subpoena, but were unable to locate her, on July 7,.2019. Priorto her:arrest,
the Government and defense, counsel, communicated on multiple occasions between. July aid
October of 2019, and communicated bricfly on two additional, occasions, most recently: in, March.
of 2020. At'no point. did defense counsel. disclose the defendant’s location, offer'to,surrender the
defendant, or offer to bring:the: defendant in-to be:interviewed..

Moreover ‘it is undisputed that when the FBI located. the defendant, she ignored. their
directives and ran. away from the.arresting agents. Although 'the defense has submitted an affidavit:
from the defendant’s private security team, nothing in. ‘that affidavit should alter the Court’s
determination, that. detention is appropriate here. The defense already informed. the Court. at. the
July 14, 2020. bail hearitig that’ the defendant's security protocol was to move'to an. inner room if
her security was breached. (Tr. 55). Even still, the new affidavit:makes clear that:the agents who

entered the defendant’s, property were wearing clothing that clearly identified'them.as FBI agents.
