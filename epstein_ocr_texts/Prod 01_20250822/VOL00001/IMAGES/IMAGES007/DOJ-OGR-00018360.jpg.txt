7 public document that had identifiers for the person who filed

8 that civil suit, in order to redact it to make sure someone

9 couldn't troll around PACER and find the public version, you

10 would have to redact essentially everything, and that's the

11 problem here. The same is true for the copy --

12 THE COURT: Please just take a look, see if there is
13 an agreement that you'll propose to me, taking into account

14 also what is already public regarding the document in the trial
15 transcript.

16 So, one of the lessons, too, is that simply you can't
17 just look in isolation. So if information is already public,
18 then redacting it -- but you'll look and see if there is some
19 appropriate middle ground that would ensure the continued
20 privacy of the witness consistent with the law.
21 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.
22 THE COURT: Thank you. And we have all of our jurors.
23 Everybody ready? Okay. We'll bring them in.
24 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, we need just a minute or
25 two to print and sign the stipulation.
