Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 745 Filed 08/10/22 Page 2 of 264 408
LC1VMAX1

1 (Trial resumed; jury not present)

2 THE COURT: All right. Matters to take up, counsel,

3 includes the Rule 16/608, as I see it, issue. And then I want
4 to see where you are in terms of working out anticipated

S personal identifying information of witnesses who I've given

6 permission to testify under pseudonyms to protect their

7 privacy.

8 So let's begin.

9 Ms. Menninger, did you want to begin with the Rule 16
10 issue?

11 MS. MENNINGER: I think Mr. Everdell was going to

12 handle that piece.

13 THE COURT: Okay.

14 Ms. Comey, are you taking this?

15 MR. ROHRBACH: I'm taking this one, your Honor.

16 THE COURT: You all swapped off.

17 So I think the defense is clearly right that if we are
18 talking by impeachment by contradiction, that is to say,

19 impeachment, direct contradiction of something testified to on
20 the stand, it's not required to be disclosed as case-in-chief
21 material under Rule 16; and depending on what it is, it's
22 likely not 608 because it's impeachment by contradiction, not
23 impeachment to show â€”-- extrinsic evidence to show a character
24 for dishonesty and the like.
25 So the question is whether it's impeachment or not.
