Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document745 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 2:of 264 408
LE1VMAX1

(Trial resumed; jury not present)

THE COURT: -All right. Matters to take up, counsel,

includes the Rule 16/608, as I see it, issue. And then I want

to see where you are in terms. of working out anticipated
personal identifying information of witnesses, who I've given
permission. to testify under pseudonyms to protect their
privacy.

So let's begin,

Ms. Méenningér, did you want to begin with ‘the Rule 16
issue?

MS. MENNINGER: I think Mr. Everdell was. going to
handle that piece.

THE GOURT: Okay:

Ms. Comey, are you taking thas?

MR. ROHRBACH: I'm taking this one, your Honor.

THE COURT: You al. swapped off.

So IT think the defense is clearly right that. if we are
talking by impeachment by contradiction, that is to say,
impeachment, direct contradiction of something testified to on
the stand, it's not required to be disclosed as case-in-chief

material undér Rule 16; and depending oh what it is, it's

likely mot 608 because it's impeachment by contradiction, not.
impeachment to6 show == extrinsic evidence to show a character
for dishonesty and the like.

So the question is whether it's impeachment or not.
