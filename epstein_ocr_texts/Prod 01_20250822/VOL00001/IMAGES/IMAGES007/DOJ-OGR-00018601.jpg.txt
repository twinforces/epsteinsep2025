LC 7VMAX1

1 characterization of the defense attorney who cross-examined

2 her, uSing an expletive that rhymes with "front." And that was
3 told to this witness, who is anticipated to be testifying

4 today, who is obviously also subject to the Court's

5) sequestration order.

6 IT am very troubled and disturbed that witnesses who

7 are still subject to recall are calling other witnesses that

8 they know will be called to testify; that will be called to

9 testify about their memories of events that happened years ago;
10 and that they are disclosing to witnesses -- this witness â€”--

11 what they experienced on the witness stand, including a

12 document that they were shown, your Honor.

13 I am asking the Court to forbid the witness Brian from
14 being called, given this violation. At a minimum, your Honor,
15 I would ask that there is a hearing outside the presence of the
16 jury in which Brian is subject to examination by the Court as
17 to exactly what happened during this phone call. Those are the
18 two pieces of information that he reported to the government

19 and was reported to us via some handwritten notes at about 2
20 this morning. That's my request, your Honor.
21 THE COURT: Okay.
22 MS. MOE: Your Honor, there are only two legal
23 principles at play here. The first is Rule 615 about excluding
24 witnesses from a courtroom. Neither Brian nor Jane has been in
25 the courtroom while other witnesses have testified. That rule
