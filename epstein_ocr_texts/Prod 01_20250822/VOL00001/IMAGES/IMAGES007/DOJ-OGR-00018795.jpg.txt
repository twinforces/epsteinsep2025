1 factual inconsistency.

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, your Honor, there are two

3 principals at play here.

4 The first is this is what is commonly referred to as

5 impeachment by omission, which is a subset of impeachment by

6 contradiction. Impeachment by omission typically occurs where
7 there is a document or a statement where the witness would

8 likely include whatever is omitted, and this is such a

9 document, and I am seeking to impeach by omission through this
10 document. This is a complaint against two people that this

11 witness claims sexually abused her. It's not only against

12 Epstein, it's against one of Epstein's employees who is

13 highlighted in this complaint. The entire testimony by the

14 government here through this witness has downplayed the role of
15 Sarah Kellen and up-played the role of Ghislaine Maxwell, and
16 it is an impeachment by omission that, in 2008, shortly after
17 being interviewed by the FBI about the same subject matter with
18 counsel, there is no mention of Maxwell in this entire

19 complaint. I think that is significant under the facts of this
20 case. So, I think it is admissible under that theory and there
21 is ample federal law, First Circuit, this circuit, that
22 supports that theory of impeachment by omission. And these
23 factual paragraphs, I believe, are also impeaching of the
24 witness's testimony because it is inconsistent with the things
25 that she has claimed happened to her in addition to these
