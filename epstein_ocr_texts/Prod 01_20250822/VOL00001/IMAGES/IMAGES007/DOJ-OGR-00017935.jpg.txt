LC2VMAX2 Rocchio â€” Direct

1 that when we talk -- there are a lot of studies that are done,
2 national studies, interviewing, say, adults, asking about a

3 whole range of experiences that they've had during the course

4 of their lifetime. And that research has repeatedly

5 demonstrated that when people -- when you ask people if they

6 acknowledge that they've been abused, particularly sexually

7 abused, during childhood, and then you ask them if they ever

8 told anyone, a significant number will say no, not until this

9 interview. And then others will say yes, and then they are

10 asked when they've told. And we know from the research that

11 often they don't tell until adulthood.

12 Q. In your clinical and forensic practices, have you treated
13 and evaluated patients who did not disclose sexual abuse they
14 experienced as children, but disclosed such abuse later?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. Without getting into any particular anecdotes of your

17 practices, can you explain.

18 A. I'm sorry, can you repeat the question.

19 Q. Yes. Can you just explain -- let me ask it this way: In
20 your own clinical practice, how common, if at all, is it for
21 you to be the first person your patients have told they were
22 abused?
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, I'm going to object to this
24 as not being relevant.
25 THE COURT: Overruled. Thank you.
