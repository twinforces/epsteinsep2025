Further, and as set forth below, those victims’ accounts are corroborated by other evidence,
including contemporary documents and other witnesses.

In challenging this factor, the defense essentially restates its prior arguments on this score.
At the original hearing, the defense argued that the Government’s case was weak because it rested
heavily on witness testimony regarding events from 25 years ago. (See Dkt. 18 at 19; Tr. 64-65).
Having received and reviewed the discovery, the defense now contends the Government’s
corroborating evidence—some of which the Motion itself identifies—is insufficient and reiterates
defense complaints that the discovery does not include other types of evidence.' (See Mot. at 30-
33).

None of the defense arguments on this score changes the calculus for this factor. Three
different victims are prepared to provide detailed testimony describing the defendant’s role in
Epstein’s criminal scheme to sexually abuse them as minors. As demonstrated by the information
outlined in the Indictment, these accounts corroborate each other by independently describing the
same techniques used by the defendant and Epstein to groom and entice minor girls to engage in
sex acts. Each victim will describe how the defendant befriended her, asked detailed questions
about her life, and then normalized sexual activity around Epstein. Each victim will describe the
use of massage as a technique to transition into sexual activity. Each victim will describe how the
presence of an adult woman manipulated her into entering an abusive situation. In other words,
this is a case that involves multiple witnesses describing the same course of conduct, substantially
corroborating each other.

' At the initial bail hearing, the defendant also raised a series of legal challenges she intended to
make on the face of the Indictment, all of which she contended weighed in favor of granting bail.
After receiving discovery, the defense now appears to have abandoned those arguments, at least
insofar as they pertain to the issue of bail.
