1 THE COURT: Do you have sheets of the ones in

2 question?

3 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

4 THE COURT: I guess what I need to do is consider

5 Mr. Pagliuca's point that they're out of order and the like.

6 T'll take the whole book back and we'll look at the law.

7 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Very briefly on that very
8 last point, I would note that for I think essentially every

9 exhibit -- I'll doublecheck at the break, but I think for every
10 exhibit we've offered, there may not be a date on every single
11 message, but there are four messages per page and there are
12 dates on -- at least somewhere on the page.
13 THE COURT: Okay.
14 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.
15 THE COURT: Thank you. See you ina few.
16 (Recess)
17 THE COURT: Anything further to offer on this?
18 MS. MOB: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.
19 We wanted to point out with respect to Government
20 Exhibit 606, which is the household manual, turning to page 7,
21 there are instructions to employees about taking phone
22 messages. Those instructions are: "Complete a phone message
23 slip with the following information: Name, spelt correctly;
24 date and time of call; telephone number, including the area
25 code."
