1 A. Well, the first time was Ghislaine.

2 Q. Why does that stand out to you in your memory?

3 A. Because it was just significant. It's when that sort of

a Q. When you say the first time, when you talk about first

6 times, what do you mean by that?

7 A. Meaning that the first time I was ever like unclothed with
8 just the both of them.

9 Q. You were asked a lot of questions on cross-examination

10 about first and first times. Do you remember those questions?
