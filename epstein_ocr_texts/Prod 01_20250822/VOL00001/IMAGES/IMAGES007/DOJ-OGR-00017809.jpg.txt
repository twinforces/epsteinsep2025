1 A. Yes.

2 Q. How old were you when you applied to go to Interlochen in

3 1994?

4 A. 13.

a Q. I want to ask you about a few things on this application.

6 But when I do, I just want to be careful we are not reading

7 anything into the record that's identifying about you.

8 If we could turn to the second page of that

9 application, and directing your attention to the second section
10 towards the bottom, do you remember Ms. Menninger asking you

11 questions about whether you told Interlochen you were having

12 any difficulties?

13 A. I don't remember.

14 Q. Let me just be clear about this portion of the application.
15 I want to direct your attention to the portion of the middle

16 section that says: List two difficult works performed in

17 orchestra, band or ensemble within the past year. Do you see
18 that question?

19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Is that the question you answered: Nothing has been
2l difficult for me?
22 A. I guess I did.
23 Q. And what did you mean when you said that?
24 A. I have no idea.
25 Q. At the time, were you fairly talented?
