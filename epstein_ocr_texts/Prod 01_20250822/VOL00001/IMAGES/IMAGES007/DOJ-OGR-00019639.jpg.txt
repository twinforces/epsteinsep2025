requested—Maxwell can make such arguments before
Judge Nathan, and the Government can and will vig-

case.

If anything, this appeal appears to be a thinly

the Government illegally obtained evidence before the
issue has even been briefed before Judge Nathan. This
Court’s precedents do not countenance such efforts to
bypass district courts. See, e.g., Frontera Res. Azer.

seal. (Br. 11). She asks that this Court permit her to
