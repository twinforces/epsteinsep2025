because MDC has identified a number of factors that raise heightened safety and security concerns
with respect to this defendant, including: (1) the nature of the charges, (2) the potential stress for
inmates that can arise in high-profile cases, and (3) the need to ensure the defendant’s safety while
she is incarcerated in a cell by herself—a housing determination made by MDC staff based on
various factors, including the defendant’s expressed concern for her safety if she were to be housed
in the general population.!

As to the Court’s question whether the defendant can be provided with “appropriate eye
covering,” MDC legal counsel has informed the Government that the defendant cannot be provided
with an eye mask. Eye masks are not available for purchase in commissary and are not issued to
inmates and, therefore, are considered contraband. The defendant is permitted, however, to use
non-contraband items to cover her eyes at night.

Should the Court have any questions or require any additional details regarding this topic,
the Government will promptly confer with legal counsel at MDC and provide additional
information.

Respectfully submitted,

' The MDC has determined the defendant’s current housing assignment based, in part, on her
concerns about being housed in the general population and as an alternative to her being housed
in the SHU. By contrast, in the SHU, most inmates have a cellmate which provides an additional
check should something go wrong or should an inmate need medical attention in the middle of the
night.
