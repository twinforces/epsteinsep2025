LC1VMAX3 Jane -â€” cross

1 THE COURT: I sustain.

2 Q. You spoke with the government in September of 2019;

3 correct?

4 A. Correct.

S MS. MENNINGER: I apologize. I may be on the wrong

6 page. I'll find that in a minute. And I apologize.

7 Q. If I can direct your attention to a discussion you had with
8 the government in February of 2020, where you told them that

9 the first trip to New York was just to go and have fun. Is

10 that true?

11 A. I don't recall.

12 Q. Okay. If I could have you take a look at 008 on page 8.

13 And it's going to be in the fourth full paragraph.

14 Does that refresh your recollection about what you

15 told the government in February 2020 about your first trip to
16 New York?

17 A. Like I said, with all due respect, I didn't write any of

18 this. I've never read this before. And I was never recorded.
19 This was just somebody jotting down notes, and so a lot of this
20 is out of sequence and incorrect.
21 Q. Does that refresh your recollection about what you told the
22 government about your first trip to New York?
23 A. No.
24 MS. MOE: Asked and answered, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: The answer is no.
