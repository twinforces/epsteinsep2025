1 interview, not because we had some other contact with him.

2 THE COURT: So you have a choice to make whether to

3 subpoena him or not. I'm just trying to understand what the

4 decision point is. The government has indicated they're not

5 calling Brian.

6 MS. MENNINGER: He has a lot of prior inconsistent

7 statements with his sister, your Honor. That's the decision

8 point. He said a lot of things that are inconsistent in her

9 prior statements. We understand if we call him that your Honor
10 is likely to allow them to then bring in the prior consistent
11 statements that they would have elicited had they called him

12 yesterday. So that's a decision point.

13 THE COURT: Okay. You have a decision point whether
14 to call him?

15 MS. MENNINGER: Right.

16 THE COURT: Is there an application with respect to

17 it?

18 MS. MENNINGER: No, your Honor. We have him under

19 subpoena.
20 THE COURT: Mr. Rohrbach.
21 MR. ROHRBACH: I suppose we just flag that Brian has
22 left the district since he's no longer a government witness.
23 If the defense ends up deciding to call him, I suppose that's
24 their choice to make.
25 It sounds like the defense has not yet made a decision
