| 07/07/2020 9 | LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from Alex |
Rossmiller dated July 7, 2020 re: scheduling Document filed by USA. (Rossmiller, Alex)
(Entered: 07/07/2020)

07/07/2020 10 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in
this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an internet
platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers will email
counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To optimize the
quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel, and counsel for
the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others may access the audio
of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited capacity of the internet platform
system, only one attorney per party may participate by video. Co-counsel, members of the
press, and the public may access the audio feed of the proceeding by calling a dial-in
number, which the Court will provide in advance of the proceeding by subsequent order.
Given the high degree of public interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding
will be available for viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick
Moynihan Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing
requirements, seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional
persons will be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone
who appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their temperature
taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions, attached. Completing
the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon entry. Only persons who
meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are
below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the courthouse. Face coverings that cover the
nose and mouth must be worn at all times. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-
19 protocols that have been adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse.
There are no exceptions. As discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall,
if possible, discuss the Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the
Defendant prior to the proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able
to sign the form (either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20-MC-174 of
March 27, 2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least
24 hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct an
inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the Court
to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3771(c)(1), the
Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and
accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. ยง 3771(a)(2), (4). The Court
will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that appropriate
logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the Court by email
within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on
the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between the Defendant's arrest and
July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in
transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(1)(F). And the
Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from today through July 14, 2020.
Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a remote proceeding, the Court finds
"that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion] outweigh the best interest of the public
and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also
supported by the need for the parties to discuss a potential protective order, which will
facilitate the timely production of discovery in a manner protective of the rights of third
a App.005
