6 MR. ROHRBACH: I think Mr. Pagliuca is talking about

8 different documents, but specifically with regard to the

9 contact book, the government expects the evidence will show

10 either that it was the defendant's contact book, or through the
11 witness we talk about in our letter, the defendant and

12 Epstein's contact book, in which case would also be a statement
13 of the defendant or her co-conspirator. Again, if this were

14 offered for the truth, it could come out without the

15 requirement apply 803(6).

16 THE COURT: I was surprised that argument hadn't been

22 is being offered for the truth, the evidence they anticipate
23 that will come in is that it is statements of the defendant or
24 Mr. Epstein in furtherance of the conspiracy.
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't know whether we're talking
