1 THE COURT: Okay.

2 And then the other legal question I had, I think

3 Mr. Cohen began his presentation by noting -- by raising case

4 law suggesting the lack of relevance of the statements of the

5 alleged victims, although fully recognizing their entitlement

6 under the law to be heard. What is the government's position

7 with respect to the relevance of the alleged victim statements

8 in the 3142 analysis?

9 MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government has not proffered
10 victim's testimony or information in an effort to support its
11 motion. To the contrary, the victims have appeared consistent
12 with their rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act. Of
13 course, as we noted in our reply brief, it is very important to
14 the government that the victims receive justice in this case
15 and that there be a trial so that that could happen. That is
16 very important to the government, and we respectfully submit
17 that the court should take that into account. However, again,
18 the victims' participation in this proceeding is pursuant to
19 their rights under the Crime Victims Rights Act. It is not
20 part of the government's presentation in this case.

21 THE COURT: Okay. So I should not consider it --
22 should not consider the substance of the statements in the
23 overall bail analysis.
24 MS. MOE: Your Honor, with respect to the nature and
25 circumstances of the offense, the offense conduct, the
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
