1 remembers who those persons are.

2 THE COURT: Well, so you want to point her somewhere

5 without naming the names because I don't know if that's a

7 THE COURT: Right.

8 MS. MENNINGER: But on J-7, on the second page, they

9 are in the first paragraph. And I'm just going to direct the
10 witness to that line so that we can see the names.

11 BY MS. MENNINGER:

12 Q. Do you recognize the names of the persons in that first

13 paragraph?

14 A. I remember my teacher, I remember the principal. I don't
15 remember the guidance counsellor.

16 Q. And do you know whether you and your mother sued the

17 principal of your high school?

18 A. No, I don't. And we're friends on Facebook, so I had no

19 idea that we even had an issue.
20 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, at this time I would offer
21 into evidence the originals of the document that is a combined
22 document of Exhibits J-8 and J-9. I think the Court can take
23 judicial notice. They are certified copies.
24 THE COURT: You're moving J-8 and J-9?
25 MS. MENNINGER: Well, in the combined original exhibit
