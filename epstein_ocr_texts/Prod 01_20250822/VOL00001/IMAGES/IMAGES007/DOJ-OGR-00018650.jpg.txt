LG7Cma x2. Flatley - direct,

A. Sure. There is a4 possibility of three different tools that
we can use. One is a physical piece of equipment called a TX1
disé¢ duplicator --

QO. Mr. Flatley, sorry to interrupt. In this. case, what did
you usé here?

A. I. used the TX1 dise duplicator.

Q. Why not 5JUSt Exantine the drive itself in this, case,
Government Exhibit 954?

A. Hard drives are a little fragile, especially this one, it's
pretty old. The fact that we spin it up, that may be the last
time it ever spins. So we always make a Copy ahd we work off
the copy so that we have our data. We can make arguably
infinite Gopies of that data and prove that it's the sané data.
So that's what we do.

QO. What, if anything, do you do to determine that the image
you made from Government, Exhibit. 54 matched, the data on
Gévernment Exhibit 54?

A. We run, a hash algorithm, which Js. basically a math, problem

against the data that we Gopied and the data from thé original,
and, if the hashes match, then the data is identical, and the
data was in this Case.

Q. After you made an image of Government. Exhibit 54, what do.
you d6é next?

A. After the 54 was imaged, I then placed it, through our
software; AccessData's lab to categorize and organize the ‘data.
