méan, it’s a low bar for rélévance, but for the redsons TI
indicated in my earlier opinion, substantially far distance in
time, Highly movable objects that don't dppedr to be specific

to what the witness described, may not meet the 401 standard.

And, if it does méet the 401 standard, I think for ‘the reasons,
Mr. Everdell indicated, it would likely be ‘outweighed by 403
prejtidice.

You have the testimony from the witness as to her
experience with the uniforms. It's difficult 'to Ssée on the
current record. But, as I said, I'll look at the testimony and
I'll let you know.

MR. EVERDELL: And, your Honer, just to be clear, this
objection would also apply to the physical outfits themselves.
THE COURT: Right. Same point. Yes. Okay.

MR. EVERDELL: Thank you;

THE COURT: Anything else?

MR. EVERDELL: N6, your Honor.

MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor.

(Reeés 5).

THE COURT: All right. I'm sustaining the objection
on 919 and 920 on 401/403 grounds, as well as the actual items.

MR. EVERDELL: Not from the defense, your Honors

MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor.

THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
