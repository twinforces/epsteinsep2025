Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s Order dated
April 29, 2021, which directed the Government to confer with legal counsel at the Metropolitan
Detention Center (“MDC”) regarding the use of flashlights in security checks at MDC. (Dkt. No.
257). The Government has conferred with legal counsel at MDC in accordance with the Court’s
Order, and legal counsel provided the information set forth herein.

MDC staff conduct flashlight checks at night as a matter of course throughout the facility
for the safety and security of the inmates at the institution. During these flashlight checks, MDC
staff point a flashlight at the ceiling of each cell to illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that
the inmate is present in the cell, breathing, and not in distress. MDC staff conduct flashlight checks
every 30 minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit (the “SHU”) and conduct
flashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at irregular
intervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.

With respect to the defendant, MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes
because the defendant, while not on suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule. That is

DOJ-OGR-00020353
