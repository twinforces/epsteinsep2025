1 a business record, I still maintain my objection to 823 on

2 relevance grounds.

3 THE COURT: So on that, I think I'm prepared to

4 overrule because we have in evidence -- so there is testimony

5 that Ms. Maxwell met Ms. Roberts at Mar-a-Lago in this

6 timeframe. We have a birth certificate of Ms. Roberts that

7 shows her father's name is Sky Roberts. So the relevance, as I
8 understand it, is that the employment of Mr. Roberts at

9 Mar-a-Lago at the timeframe is relevant, is probative of the

10 family's connection to Mar-a-Lago at the timeframe testified to
11 by Mr. Alessi.

12 Do I have the theory of relevance?

13 MR. ROHRBACH: That's right, your Honor, as well as

14 the conditional relevance theory that the phone number in

15 Government Exhibit 823 appears in Government Exhibit 52 as

16 Virginia's parents. If that exhibit were to come in, this

17 record would become relevant for that additional reason.

18 THE COURT: What case do you have in mind for the

19 adaptive business record?
20 MR. ROHRBACH: We'd be happy to provide the case name
al and cite after the break. I don't want to butcher the name of
22 the case and leave the Court astray. We'll be happy to provide
23 it to the Court's law clerk, as well. I do have a particular
24 case in mind.
25 THE COURT: You have a case in mind, but you're not
