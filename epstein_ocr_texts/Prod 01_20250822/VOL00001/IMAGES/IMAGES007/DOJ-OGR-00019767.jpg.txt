03/16/2021 | 167 | LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from Bobbi C.
Sternheim dated 03/16/2021 re: Letter regarding Reply to Bail Motion (Sternheim,
Bobbi) (Entered: 03/16/2021)

03/18/2021 | 168 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed
the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the
Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See
Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions
that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having
considered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's
requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction
requests, with the exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the
Governments request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that
transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre
v. Maxwell, Case No. 15-cv—7433, Dkt. No. 1212-1. In light of this, the Court sees
no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant
portions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket
on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file
a letter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding
pages 1128 and 187188 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The
parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the
Defendant's cover letter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March
22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet, confer, and propose redactions
to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March 22, 2021 (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 3/18/21)(jw) (Entered: 03/18/2021)
