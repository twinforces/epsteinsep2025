forthcoming motion before Judge Nathan challenging its circumvention of

At bottom, when asked to justify why Judge Preska and this Court should
remain in the dark, the government offers little more than this: because the
protective order says so. But in the face of all the reasons why the relevant judicial
decision makers should have all the relevant information, the government’s answer
is not good enough.

This Court should reverse the district court’s order denying Ms. Maxwell’s
motion to modify the protective order.
