type of protective order at issue here. To the contrary,
the Protective Order in. this casé expressly provides
that its ‘provisions “shall not be construed as prevent-
ing disclosure of any information, with the exception.
of victim or witness identifying information, that is
publicly available or obtained by the Defendant. or-her
Defense Counsel, form.a source, other than the Cover n-
ment.” (A, 84-85). Instead, the Protective Order “im-
posed restrictions on the parties’ disclosure of materi,
als exchanged in the course of pending litigation” and,
like the,similar provision in, the Pappas. protective. or:
der, is therefore “not subject. to appeal” prior to entry
of final judgment. Pappas; 94 F.8d at: 798.

Caparros‘is similarly analogous. That’case declined.
to find jurisdiction over a.similay order for séveral rea-
sons, including because “[t]he purported right at issue
isnot related to any right to stand trial.” Caparros, 800
F.2d _at,'26. The: Court ‘also concluded that the protec-
tive order in that case would. be reviewable on appeal.
after final judgment and emphasized that the defend-
ant would not suffer any “grave harm ... if the order
is not immediately reviewed.” Id. So too here. Maxwell
has not articulated any’ serious injury shé will suffer if
this, Court. dismisses her appeal. The only theoretical
harm might be prejudicial pretrial publicity arising’
from the unsealing of filings in a:civil case. Should.any
prejudicial publicity ar ise, though, Maxwell will be
fully able to raise that issue on appeal after the entry
of final judgment in her criminal ¢ase. See, é.g., United:
States. v. Sabhnani,599. F.3d 215, 232-34 (2d Cir. 2010)

ity biased the wentre);_ United. States Uv: Eligeeh, 515
