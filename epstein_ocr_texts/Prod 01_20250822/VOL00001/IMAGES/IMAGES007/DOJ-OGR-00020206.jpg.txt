As:the government states, ‘a, flashlight is pointed at the cciling of her isolation cell, every
15 minutes, from approximately 9:30 pm'to,6:30 am. Jt-is hard. to verbally convey the power ofa,
Jight that boutices off a.concrete ceiling in a six-by-nine-foot coricrete box into Ms. Maxwell’s
‘eyes, disrupting her slecp and ability to have any restful night. The attenuating cffects of sleep
deprivation are'well, documented.

Ms. Maxwell continues to be at-the mercy of a revolving group of security officcrs who
are uscd, to, guarding hundreds of inmates but:tiow focus their undivided, attention exclusively on
‘one respectful, middle-aged. female pretrial. detainee. Recently, out.of view of the security
camera,.Ms. Maxwell was placed. in her isolation.ccll and. physically abused during a pat down
search. When she asked that the camera. be used to capture’ the occurrence, a guard. replicd.“‘no.”
‘When, Ms. Maxwell. recoiled:in, pain and when she said she would-report the mistreatment, she
‘was threatened with disciplinary action. Within a:;weck and, while the same:team was in charge,
Ms. Maxwell was'the. subject of further retaliation for reporting:the abuse: a. guatd ordered Ms.
Maxwell into.a. shower to clean, sanitize, and scrub the walls with.a broom. Ms. Maxwell’s
request to have the camera:record the guard alone with her-in. the confined:space was again
denied.

Ms. Maxwell. spends an increasing amount of time in-her isolation cell. because her daily
removal is delayed. Her movement-within that cell. is ‘restricted. Despite claims: by. MDG Legal
to:the contrary, guards forbid Ms. Maxwell from. standing i in, certain areas of her six-by-nine- -foot
cell: she is ‘not. allowed to stand to the left or right of the toilet, in cither corner of the isolation,
cell, and within two fect.from the door: This directive encroaches on an already. restricted and
confined area arid limits her movement and usé to the little space that remains.

‘Ms. Maxwell continucs to have scrious problems with the food provided to-her. She has
‘repeatedly not. been, provided. some or all. parts of.a,meal, For the duration.of her detention, she
has never received,a properly heated meal. Her food, contained i in plastic: specifically contra-
indicated forse: in a ‘microwave; is designed to be heated. in a thermal oven. The old microwave
oven used for Ms. Maxwell’s food either does not defrost'the food or disintegrates it and melts
the plastic container, rendering the food. inedible. While guards finally acknowledged serious
problems with the food, they continued to.microwave Ms. Maxwells food, rendcring the: food.
‘inedible and, dangerous for consumption. and Icaving Ms. Maxwell with no ‘meal ‘and no
replacement. Late last’weck, guards informed,Ms. Maxwell that going forward her food will be
heated jin. a thermal, oven, like that ofall other inmates. While this. may be an improvement, iit.
does little to correct seven:months of deprivation impacting her :nutrition-and detrimental to her
health,

Reeently: there have been:problems ‘with odorous and:non-palatable tap water. The water:
in. the isolation céll ‘was cloudéd with heavy particulates; the water in'the day: room ‘was brown.
Requests by Ms. Maxwell and. counsel to, provide her bottled watér-or permit herto purchase.
‘water were denied. In. addition, her legal: ‘mail does not: arrive Inia: timely. manner, daily

system, and. she has arrived late for VTC calls.
