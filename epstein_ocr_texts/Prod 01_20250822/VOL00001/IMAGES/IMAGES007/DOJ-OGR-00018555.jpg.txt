1 evidence numbers to items that are seized during the course of
2 the search warrant?

3 A. After we seize items of evidence at a location, we then

4 enter them into a collected item log. At that point each item
5 is serialized with a number that's called a 1B number that's

6 for evidence tracking purposes with our evidence control unit.
7 Q. And just to be clear, I believe you testified that the CDs
8 contained in these binders were assigned evidence numbers

9 1B-19, is that right?

10 A. That's correct.

11 Q. I'd like to turn now to show you --

12 MS. MOE: Ms. Drescher, if you could please just show
13 just the witness, the Court, and counsel what's been marked for
14 identification as Government Exhibit 926.

15 Q. Do you recognize this?

16 A. Yes, matam, I do.

17 Q. What is Government Exhibit 926?

18 A. This is a photograph taken in the same room where the

19 previous black binders were located. In the center of this
20 closet room there was a drawer organizer located right there in
2l the center. This is one of the bottom drawers where several
22 CDs were located.
23 Q. Is this a fair and accurate depiction of the drawer with
24 CDs that you just described?
25 A. Yes, ma'am.
