the Government’s applications to modify certain protective orders in other judicial
proceedings.” Ms. Maxwell’s point is that, unless the unsealing order is reversed,
she might not ever be able to litigate “the lawfulness of the Government’s
applications.”

Moreover, the motion to consolidate is not an attempt to circumvent Judge
Nathan’s order before this Court can reach the merits. The motion to consolidate
simply endeavors to ensure that this Court does not find itself in the same position
as the several judges below, where only some of the judges are privy to the relevant
facts.

There is no merit to Ms. Giuffre’s argument that consolidation will cause
meaningful delay. Doc. 123, pp 4-5. This Court has scheduled oral argument in
both cases on the same day, as well as an argument on the motion to consolidate.
Whether that motion is granted or not will have no effect on the dispatch with
which this Court addresses the issues.

This Court should grant the motion to consolidate.
