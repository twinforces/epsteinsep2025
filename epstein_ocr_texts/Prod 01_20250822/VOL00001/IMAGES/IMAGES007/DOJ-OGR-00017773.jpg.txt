Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 745 Filed 08/10/22 Page 164 of 264 575
LC1VMAX5 Jane -â€” cross

1 MS. MENNINGER: Do you have any basis to believe --

2 any reason to believe that your cooperation would help with

3 this case, would help you with your civil case, that's one

4 question.

S The other is do you have any reason --

6 THE COURT: I'm sorry. I don't think that

7 clarifies -- I think it's unclarifying on two points that

8 Ms. Moe has raised.

9 MS. MENNINGER: Okay.

10 THE COURT: One, cooperating in this case, meaning by
11 testifying or more broadly. And two, since she no longer has a
12 pending civil case, I think she'd probably be left wondering

13 what you're referring to.

14 Can you clarify the question -- I think what you're

15 asking is at any point during your -- at any point in your

16 cooperation with the government -- "cooperation" is loaded

17 because it's not like there's a cooperation agreement or

18 something. But for lack of a better term, cooperating with the
19 government with respect to this criminal case, did you ever
20 have an understanding that it might benefit you in what was
2l then a pending civil litigation?
22 Ms. Moe, is that getting at what you're suggesting?
23 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. I just wanted to make sure
24 it was clear for the witness.
25 THE COURT: Okay.
