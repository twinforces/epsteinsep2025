the Court is obliged to determine both whether the defendant is likely to flee the jurisdiction if
released, and whether any conditions of release will be reasonably certain to guard against this
propensity to flee. The Court expressed concerns and denied bail without indicating what
conditions would be reasonably certain to assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance. Ms. Maxwell is no
danger to the community and not alleged to have been involved in ongoing criminal activity. To
say that there are absolutely no conditions flies in the face of cases where non-United States
citizens with no ties to the district, let alone the country, were released on lesser conditions for
alleged criminality ongoing up to or within hours of the time of arrest, in contrast to 26-year-old
claims alleged against Ms. Maxwell.”

The additional conditions set forth above, which supplement the exceptional bail package
previously proposed, are sufficient to address the hypothetical risk of flight and secure Ms.
Maxwell’s presence at trial. The financial magnitude of the proposed bonds, the collateral

Paris-bound flight at JFK minutes before takeoff and later charged with several counts of sexual assault, including
felony charges punishable up to 25 years imprisonment, for sexual assault and attempted rape of a Manhattan hotel
housekeeper on the day of his arrest. The accusations were corroborated by semen containing Strauss-Kahn’s DNA
on the accuser’s uniform. The New York State Supreme Court granted bail in the amount of $1 million cash, 24-
hour home detention electronic monitoring ankle bracelet, and private 24/7 security guards. After surrendering his
French passport and posting an additional $5 million bail bond, Strauss-Kahn was placed under house arrest in a
residence in Manhattan. See https://(www.theguardian.com/world/2011/ may/20/dominique-strauss-kahn-new-york-
