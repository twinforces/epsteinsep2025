1 Q. As you sit here today, do you remember not being impressed
2 when you went to New Mexico for the first time on the private

3 plane?

4 A. I don't recall saying that.

S Q. No. Do you recall as you sit here today that you were not
6 impressed when you first went to New Mexico on a private plane?
7 A. No.

8 Q. You do not recall any abuse happening when you first went

9 to New Mexico; correct?

10 A. That's not correct, no.

11 Q. That's what you told the government in February of 2020;

12 COLLEGE ?

13 A. No, that's not correct. Like I said, this is not a

14 transcript of mine. This is the first time I'm reading it and
15 it's not correct.

16 Q. All right. I'm going to direct your attention to 3509-008,

18 recollection about what you told the government about your

19 first trip to New Mexico?
20 A. No, it doesn't.
21 Q. And isn't it true you told the government in February of
22 2020 that on your first trip to New Mexico, you recalled going
23 hiking, remembered not doing too much, just sitting around
24 mostly, and did not recall specific abuse that may have
25 occurred?
