“tell Judge Preska what happened and let Judge
Preska decide whether the information weighs against
unsealing the deposition material or in favor of a stay.”
(Br. 31). To the extent Maxwell seeks to inform Judge
Preska—or any other judicial officer—of the basic facts
surrounding the criminal prosecution and the criminal
discovery materials at issue, the District Court has al-
ready granted Maxwell the supposed relief she seeks
from this Court. Although the District Court did not
modify the Protective Order, Judge Nathan authorized
Maxwell to convey, under seal, to the appropriate ju-
dicial officer the fact that the Government obtained an
order from Court-1 permitting the Recipient to comply
with a subpoena for materials covered by a protective
order, that Court-2 subsequently denied similar relief
in another case, and that Maxwell “learned of this in-
formation (sealed by other courts) as a result of Rule
16 discovery in this criminal matter.” (A. 101-02). If
the “very point” of Maxwell’s request to seek a modifi-
cation of the Protective Order was to share infor-
mation and not to challenge the legality of the Govern-
ment’s investigative techniques, then her appeal is
moot because Judge Nathan has already granted her
permission to do so. Maxwell does not explain why
those facts are not enough.

Despite those available avenues, Maxwell still ar-
gues that she cannot move to stay the unsealing pro-
cess before Judge Preska and “thereby safeguard her
right to a fair trial in the criminal case.” (Br. 29). As
already noted, though, it is a matter of public record
that the charges against Maxwell include allegations
of perjury in civil cases. (A. 27-29). Without relying on
any materials she received through criminal discovery,
