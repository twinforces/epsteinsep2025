1 Q. Mr. Flatley, can you read that paragraph, please.

2 A. Sure. "John and I specifically talked last week about how
3 important these details are. About two weeks ago, I faxed your
4 checkoff lists to John in preparation for the manual. These

a are the lists you made and I'd say they are at least 3/4

6 complete. (This is the third time I've reviewed these lists

7 with him since I've started.) He stated the lists are

8 complete, although I definitely want to add to them and edit

9 them as your needs change."

10 MS. POMERANTZ: If we can pull out of that, we can

11 drop that call out, and if we can zoom in on the paragraph

12 starting with "Our household manual draft." Thanks very much.
13 Q. Mr. Flatley, can you please read that.

14 A. Sure. "Our household manual draft does indicate where to
15 purchase "Cleaning supplies" (Publix and Sam's Club-PB Gardens)
16 and states "Use only Tide with bleach, Downy softeners (switch
17 fragrance every 2-3 months) Bounce dryer sheets. We did edit
18 and reviewed this information last week. However, we have not
19 completed an inventory list/check off list of supplies yet."
20 Q. Thank you, Mr. Flatley. And directing your attention to
2l the top of page 1, who is this email from?
22 A. It is from gmax, gmaxl@mindspring.com.
23 Q. And who is this email to?
24 A. MarkhamCPM@earthlink.net.
25 MS. POMERANTZ: Ms. Drescher, we can pull that down.
