Government.’ The defendant cites not.a single example in,any: district court in the country’;where
such a-restriction has been:imposced in.a-protective order. Indced, it is nonsensical for a protective
ordcr to require limitations of the Government ‘in. its usc: of material alrcady'in, its possession .so
that the Government may provide a defendant with discovery. The defendant’s attempt to refuse:
to agree'to reccive discovery-unless:the Government agrees to additional restrictions upon.the-use
of its own materials should. be rejected. .

As an. initial matter, the Government’s ‘use of materials: it. has gathered. through. its
‘investigation, including through the grand jury‘process, scarch warrants, interviews, and voluntary’
disclosures, ‘is already: subject toa. wide range: of restrictions, including Rule 6(c) of the. Federal
Rules of Criminal. Procedure, the Privacy: Act of 1974, and other policies of the: Department of
Justice’ and. the U.S. Attorney’s Office: for the Southern District, of New York. In this case,
consistent with, the Government’s customary ‘practiec, and, as. the Government has. informed.
defense counsel, the Governnient has-no intention of:providing witnesses, victims or their counsel
with the entirety of discovery‘produced to the defendant, nor anything cven. close to that. Indeed,
consistent with. its:standard practice, the: Government rarely provides any third. party, including a
witness, with any material they: did not alrcady ‘possess. While the Government does more
commonly show. a witness materials in, connection with. proffers or trial, preparation, the
Government rarely if ever shows a, witness matcrial she has ‘not already secn, does not have
personal knowledge ‘of, or Would :not have some specific reason to opine ‘upon. Practically
speaking, therefore, the concerns ‘defense counsel. raises about future-use ‘in civil litigation are not

Nevertheless, a criminal ‘protective order is not the appropriate forum. for'the defendant to
demaiid restrictions onthe Government’s‘use of its own materials. TLo'the:contrary, as.noted above,
many: of those restrictions are already established. by: rule and law—standards the defendant makes
a. whole, including ‘those ‘beyond the: prosecutors. on this case, may ‘have obligations that. would
conflict with such language in a protective order. For example, the Government has obligations
under various statutory and. regulatory régimes, including: but ‘not limited, to the Freedom. of
Information.Act and. Jouhyv. Ragen, 340 U.S. 462 (1.95.1), that cannot be bargained away through.
a protective order. Indeed, the Government. can represent. that the Department..of Justice: has
reccived both FOIA. and Touhy requests in-connection. with, this investigation, ‘requests to’ which
the Department has a legal, obligation to respond. ‘appropriately. The Government: respectfully
submits it would be inappropriate for the defendant‘to se¢k—or the Court to order—language in a.
protective order that conflicts’with.or supersedes. those obligations. Tellingly, the defendant. cites
no authority or precedent for her request regarding this issuc.

By contrast, to the extent the defendant intends to produce reciprocal discovery to the
Government, it:may-in that: case be appropriate to, limit the Government’s use, or third parti¢s’ use,

+ Specifically, the defendant’s:proposed protective order differs from the Government’ s:in that:
‘itadds a paragraph, its paragraph 3, proposing restrictions‘upon. the Government and its potential.
witnesses, and their counsel, as well as adding language: to its. paragraph. 5, which is Government.
paragraph 4, further‘restricting potential, government witnesses and their-counscl.
