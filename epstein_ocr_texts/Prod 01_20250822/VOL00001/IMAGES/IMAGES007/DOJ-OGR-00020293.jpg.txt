This Reply responds to the arguments the Government does raise:

1. The Court did not conduct a “lengthy bail hearing.” Resp.§2.
The transcript of the video arraignment and bail hearing spans only 91
pages, with the bail arguments on pages 22-79. The Government did not
present any actual evidence at this brief hearing. Br.7-8,19-21. During the
bail hearing, each time the Government mentioned the strength of its
case, it cited to the Indictment. See, e.g., Ex.D, p.24 (“Turning first to the
... strength of the evidence, the indictment in this case arises ... . The
indictment further charges that ...”); pg. 25 (“The indictment makes plain
.. It was an ongoing scheme ... Given the strength of the government’s
evidence ... there is an incredibly strong incentive for the defendant to flee
..). The court erred in agreeing that the Indictment itself demonstrates
strength. Id. at 82 (“[I]t is appropriate to consider the strength of the
evidence proffered by the government in assessing risk of flight. The
government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.
Although the charged conduct took place many years ago, the indictment
describes ...”). At no point did the Government introduce or even proffer
any actual evidence.
