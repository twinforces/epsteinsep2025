Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 745 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 163 of 264 574
LC1VMAX5 Jane -â€” cross

1 Just to facilitate clarity with respect to the

2 threshold question here about the witness, about her

3 understanding if the question is phrased as her understanding

4 about testifying at trial today and the effect of a civil case,
S I think the answer to that question has to be no because there
6 is no civil case, there is no pending claim, it's all been

7 resolved.

8 And so I just wanted to clarify whether the question

9 is at the time she started meeting with the government was that
10 her understanding, while the case was active, or whether the

11 question will be about her testimony here at trial.

12 Jane has testified on direct that her understanding is
13 she has no financial stake in the outcome of this case. The

14 civil matter is resolved and the verdict in this case won't

15 affect what she's received from those settlements. And so I

16 just wanted to clarify in terms of how that question is phrased
17 and what we're getting at about the issue about testifying at
18 trial or her initial decision to cooperate with the government.
19 THE COURT: Fair enough.
20 MS. MENNINGER: That's fair.
21 In the paragraph itself it refers to cooperating with
22 the case and it refers to testifying. So I think any reason to
23 believe either one of those --
24 THE COURT: Can you just give us the specific
25 question.
