LC7Cmax2 Flatley - direct

1 Q. I'm sorry, Mr. Flatley. Just to take a step back, when you
2 first get it, do you mark it in some way?

3 A. Yes. I'm sorry. The first thing I do is put the NYC

4 number on it and the sticker with my initials.

a Q. After marking it, do you create an image of the drive?

6 A. Yes. In this case, I had to inspect it to see what kind of
7 data was on it, to see if it was already an image or if it was
8 a clone so that if it was a clone, I would have to image it.

9 If it was an image, I would just have to copy it.

10 Q. Did you end up making an image of this device?

11 A. Yes, I did.

12 Q. What does it mean to make an image of a device?

13 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, this is outside the 702

14 disclosure.

15 THE COURT: Overruled.

16 A. So an image is a bit-for-bit copy of the media from the

17 very beginning to the very end. We take those -- that copy and
18 we write it into several different files and then that way it
19 containerizes the data inside it so we don't accidentally mess
20 it up.
21 Q. Did you image the drive that's been marked for
22 identification that's been marked as Government Exhibit 54?
23 A. Yes, I did.
24 Q. Can you explain to the jury how you made or what tools you
25 used to make a forensic image of the hard drive?
