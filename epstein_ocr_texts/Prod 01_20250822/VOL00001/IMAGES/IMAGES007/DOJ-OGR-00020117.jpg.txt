Finally, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell could always flee to some:country
other than the United Kingdom aid France‘holds het—and any déféendant—to an impossible
standard, which is not the standard under the:Bail'Reform Act. (See Gov. Mem. at.19). By the
government’s reasoning, no defendant with financial means to travel:could be granted bail,,
because: there-would always. be a possibility that they could flee to another.country (even if they
had no ties there), and there could never be'an assurance that any extradition waiver would be
enforced. However, “Section 3142 doés not seek ironclad guarantees.” United States v. Chen,
820 F.Supp. 1205, 1208 (N.D; Cal. 1992). To the extent that Ms, Maxwell’s ties to France and
the United Kingdom—where she has not lived for nearly 30 years—create a flight risk, her
extradition waivers along with the substantial bail package proposed reasonably cure it’

E.. The Recent:COVID Surge at MDC Further Justifies Bail

The government suggests that the Court'ignore COVID concerns because Ms: Maxwell,
though quarantined because of contact with an officer who tested’ positive, did not become
infected. This ignores the daily (sometimes multiple) inspections.of Ms. Maxwell?s mouth,
which heightens her risk of contracting the deadly virus, which has now surged to 113 positive
cases in the MDC. Further, Deputy Captain B. Houtz recently issued a memo stating that “[i]t
has not been determined whether legal calls and legal visits will. continue.” As the Court is well
aware, legal visits with Ms. Maxwell already have been suspended. Should legal calls also be
discontinued, her constitutional right to’ effective assistance of counsel will be further eroded.

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully. requests that the Court order her

release on bail pursuant to ‘the strict conditions she has proposed.
