1 so the admissions person would have begun the file, eventually
2 would have added to that file. Some things would have been

3 removed from the file at some point because we have as the

4 archives -- they clean out things that aren't necessarily

5 needed, but eventually the files were kept in the school, and

6 then were, as I said, digitized about ten years ago.

7 Q. How long are student records kept?

8 A. Well, in the permanent file, meaning that we must keep

9 forever, would include student's transcript and any

10 recommendation letters that were made to colleges. Other items
11 are generally removed after six to seven years, depending on

12 best practices.

13 Q. Are those records kept in the ordinary course of business?
14 A. Yes.

15 Q. You mentioned that some records are kept permanently and

16 some are not. What happens at the end of the period of time

17 for the records that are not kept permanently?

20 What happens for the records that are not kept permanently?
21 A. Yes. So, what should happen is someone would go through
22 the file, pull those things that do not need to be kept
23 permanently, and they would have been shredded.
24 Q. Are they always purged from the file at that time?
25 A. No. There are older files in which it's a complete file
