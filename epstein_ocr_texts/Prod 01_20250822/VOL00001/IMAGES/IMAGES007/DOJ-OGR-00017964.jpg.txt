LC2Qmax3 Rocchio â€” Cross

1 question.

2 Overruled. You may finish.

3 A. No, it's not an assumption, because a lot of the research

4 that I'm talking about and much of my experience in both

5 clinical and forensic settings has been conducted when the

6 abuse is actually known or have been found in a court of law to
7 have occurred or the event offender has admitted to the

8 behavior.

9 Q. You offered some opinions about grooming, Dr. Rocchio. I
10 think you referred to grooming as a series of tactics and
11 strategies that are commonly experienced by victims and
12 utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child
13 building a relationship of trust and then eventually sexually
14 abusing the child. Is that correct?
15 A. Yeah, that's a summary of what I said. Sure, yes.
16 Q. And these behaviors that you're referring to as grooming
17 behaviors can also be non-grooming behaviors as well, correct?
18 A. Some of them can, yes.
19 Q. And so there are many things that we do that in hindsight
20 one might say is grooming, but prospectively you can't tell
al whether or not it's grooming, right?
22 A. It would be important though to -- grooming is not a
23 specific behavior. It's a series and a pattern of behavior
24 that's taking into account the entire pattern. So it wouldn't
25 be just a specific individual behavior.
