speak— by:name on the public; record in this case,.as one-victim has already chosen,to do, because
those victims, and. only those victims, have affirmatively chosen, to ‘be publicly. : identified in
conncetion with this case. These proposals are reasonable, narrowly tailored, and not broader‘than.
necessary to protect victims’ ‘privacy interests, safety, and, well-being, to avoid potential
harassment of witnesses: by the press and others, and. to prevent undue embarrassment and other
adverse consequences. At this stage:in the:casc, permitting defense counsel to refer to witnesses
by name’'in. sealed. filings, to refer fo witnesses by name ‘in the course of private conversations
during their investigation, and, to refer by name to individuals who have: made the affirmative
choicé to be identified by name.in connection with this criminal.caseis nioré than cnough to, criable:
the defendant ability to vigorously pursuc her defense.

The defendant has rejected this proposal because; as noted above, she’belicves that-she and.
her counsel should be:permitted to “publicly referene[e]” individuals, by name, who have: “spoken,
on the public record to the media or'in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise— relating:
to Jeffrey Epstein. ot ‘Ghislaine, Maxwell.” In support of: the defendant’s. application. for such.
swecping ability to publicly name: any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the
conclusory assertion, that an, inability to ‘publicly referenee the names of ‘victims, in court:
proceedings and ‘beyond, ‘will hinder'their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and,
advocate on. the defendant’s, behalf. The Government has repeatedly’ asked. defense counsel to
explain how or why it would nécd to publicly name. victims of sexual abuse to ‘prepare. for trial,
and:the defense repeatedly has: declined to.do so, _presumably because the-argument: borders: on:the
absurd.”

The Government's proposed protective order would do no'such thing. As described above,
the Government’ s:proposed order would permit defense counsel. and defense, staff to referenec the
identities of individuals they believe: may be relevant. to the defense to potential witnesses and: their
information). Government. Proposed Order # 5. It would further permit: the defendant to publicly
identify. individuals who have chosen to speak: on the ‘record on’ this case. /é. 96. And. it-would,
‘permit the defendant. to, reference identifying information. in filings made under seal. See id.

° Despite the Government’s requests for clarity onthe need for the: defendant’s requested.
modification, the sole additional, reason provided. by: defense counsel for ‘why: it: would. be
appropriate or necessary’ to publicly name: victims is'that ccrtain. of these victims have, obtained.
what defense counsel described asthe “bencfit” of:publiclyidentifying themselves as victims (and
thus,, as, the defendant. ‘presumably would. have :it, deserve. Whatever ‘public. identification and.
scrutiny the defendant intends to ‘invite upon them). Beyond the: offensive: notion that:victims of
sexual, abuse experience a “benefit” by’ making the incredibly difficult decision, to: share: their
experience publicly,, the suggestion that victims who ‘reccive this ‘supposed “benefit” should.
receive, fewer r protections than the Jaw oranataly otters to victims ‘in criminal cases is alarming.
the record mn “this case risks ‘subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no
conceivable: benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses ftom cooperating
with, the Government.
