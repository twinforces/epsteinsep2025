speak—by name on the public record in this case, as one victim has already chosen to do, because
those victims, and only those victims, have affirmatively chosen to be publicly identified in
connection with this case. These proposals are reasonable, narrowly tailored, and not broader than
necessary to protect victims’ privacy interests, safety, and well-being, to avoid potential
harassment of witnesses by the press and others, and to prevent undue embarrassment and other
adverse consequences. At this stage in the case, permitting defense counsel to refer to witnesses
by name in sealed filings, to refer to witnesses by name in the course of private conversations
during their investigation, and to refer by name to individuals who have made the affirmative
choice to be identified by name in connection with this criminal case is more than enough to enable
the defendant ability to vigorously pursue her defense.

The defendant has rejected this proposal because, as noted above, she believes that she and
her counsel should be permitted to “publicly referenc[e]” individuals, by name, who have “spoken
on the public record to the media or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating
to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” In support of the defendant’s application for such
sweeping ability to publicly name any such individuals, defense counsel provides only the
conclusory assertion that an inability to publicly reference the names of victims, in court
proceedings and beyond, will hinder their ability to investigate, prepare witnesses for trial, and
advocate on the defendant’s behalf. The Government has repeatedly asked defense counsel to
explain how or why it would need to publicly name victims of sexual abuse to prepare for trial,
and the defense repeatedly has declined to do so, presumably because the argument borders on the
absurd.”

The Government’s proposed protective order would do no such thing. As described above,
the Government’s proposed order would permit defense counsel and defense staff to reference the
identities of individuals they believe may be relevant to the defense to potential witnesses and their
counsel (who then would be prohibited from further disclosing or disseminating such identifying
information). Government Proposed Order 45. It would further permit the defendant to publicly
identify individuals who have chosen to speak on the record on this case. Jd. 9.6. And it would
permit the defendant to reference identifying information in filings made under seal. See id.

> Despite the Government’s requests for clarity on the need for the defendant’s requested
modification, the sole additional reason provided by defense counsel for why it would be
appropriate or necessary to publicly name victims is that certain of these victims have obtained
what defense counsel described as the “benefit” of publicly identifying themselves as victims (and
thus, as the defendant presumably would have it, deserve whatever public identification and
scrutiny the defendant intends to invite upon them). Beyond the offensive notion that victims of
sexual abuse experience a “benefit” by making the incredibly difficult decision to share their
experience publicly, the suggestion that victims who receive this supposed “benefit” should
receive fewer protections than the law ordinarily offers to victims in criminal cases is alarming.
Permitting defense counsel to publicly identify witnesses who have not identified themselves on
the record in this case risks subjecting witnesses to harassment and intimidation, with no
conceivable benefit to the defense other than perhaps discouraging witnesses from cooperating
with the Government.
