2 Q. What's the date of that message?

3 A. 8/12/04.

4 Q. And looking at the signature line at the bottom of that

5 message in the upper left-hand corner, do you recognize that?
6 A. Yes, that's my signature.

7 Q. Now, I want to turn to the message on the upper right, the
8 one to the right of the message that has your signature.

9 A. Okay.
10 Q. Again, without reading any names, I just want to ask you,
11 yes or no, is the person who left this message Carolyn?
12 A. I don't know. I see a K.
13 Q. Focusing on the upper right-hand corner of Government
14 Exhibit 1B, do you see the message that starts "for
15 Mr. Epstein"?
16 A. Yes, I do. Oh, wait. Yeah.
17 Q. And again, without reading the name, just want to follow
18 along very closely. The top line, it says "for Mr. Epstein";
19 is that right?
20 A. That's correct.
21 Q. And is the date beneath that 7/30?
22 A. That's correct.
23 Q. And again, without reading the name, just yes or no, the M
24 line, is that the person who left the message, again, without
25 saying the name?
