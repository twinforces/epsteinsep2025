6 Personally, the defendant not only has significant financial

7 resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those
8 resources and herself. After the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein,

9 Ms. Maxwell retreated from view. She moved to New England,

10 changing locations on multiple occasions, and appears to have
11 made anonymous transactions both big and small. The defense

12 said that she did all of this not to hide from the government
13 but to maintain her privacy and avoid public and press

14 scrutiny. Even assuming that Ms. Maxwell only wanted to hide
15 from the press and public, an assumption that the court does

16 not share, but even assuming that's the case, her recent

17 conduct underscores her extraordinary capacity to evade

18 detection, even in the face of what the defense has

19 acknowledged to be extreme and unusual efforts to locate her.
20 Because of these concerns, even a bail package with
21 electronic monitoring and home security guards would be
22 insufficient. Were she to flee, the defendant could simply
23 remove the monitoring bracelet and, as other courts have
24 observed, home detention with electronic monitoring does not
25 prevent flight. At best it limits a fleeing defendant's head
