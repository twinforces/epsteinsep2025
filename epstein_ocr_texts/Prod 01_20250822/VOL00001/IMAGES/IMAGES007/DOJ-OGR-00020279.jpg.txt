she returns to the day room from the scan area. As part of every pat-down search, the defendant
is required to remove her mask and open her mouth briefly so that MDC staff, who remain masked
during the searches, can confirm she has not hidden contraband in her mouth.” These pat-down
and mouth searches are consistent with MDC’s policy that all inmates be searched whenever they
move to a different location within the jail facility. In the absence of in-person visitation, the
defendant has not been strip searched. If the defendant receives in-person visits, then she, like all
other inmates, will be strip searched after any in-person visit.

In addition, MDC staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once per day. At night,
MDC staff are required to confirm every fifteen minutes that the defendant is not in distress. To
do so, every fifteen minutes, staff point a flashlight to the concrete ceiling of the defendant’s cell
to illuminate the cell sufficiently to confirm that the defendant is breathing. At night, MDC staff
have observed that the defendant wears an eye mask when she sleeps, limiting the disturbance
caused by the flashlight. Additionally, MDC staff have observed that the defendant regularly
sleeps through these nighttime wellness checks. The MDC continues to be of the view that all of
these searches are necessary for the safety of the institution and the defendant.

The Government also inquired regarding certain complaints defense counsel raised in
February 2021 regarding the defendant’s food, water, and physical wellbeing. In response, MDC
> Following defense counsel’s complaint in its February 16, 2021 letter of an inappropriately
conducted pat-down search, the MDC conducted an investigation and found that, contrary to the
defendant’s claim, the search in question was in fact recorded in full by a handheld camera. After
reviewing the camera footage, the MDC concluded that the search was conducted appropriately
and the defendant’s complaint about that incident was unfounded. MDC legal counsel further
confirmed that all pat-down searches of the defendant are video recorded. Following this incident,
MDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell because it had become very dirty. Among other
things, MDC staff noted that the defendant frequently did not flush her toilet after using it, which
caused the cell to smell. In addition, the defendant had not cleaned her cell in some time, causing
the cell to become increasingly dirty. MDC staff directed the defendant to clean her cell in
response to the smell and the dirtiness, not as retaliation for complaining about a particular search.
