LC6VMAX4

1 things have been admitted during this trial with Limiting

2 instructions. I think that there is relevance to this.

3 THE COURT: Yes.

4 MS. STERNHEIM: And it comports with testimony;

5 therefore, there is relevance to it. And an instruction would
6 cure the concerns of the government.

7 THE COURT: I'm going to continue with my ruling.

8 Now I'm leaning towards cumulativeness, but I'll

9 permit the dates and the emails for the reasons indicated with
10 redaction of the content on 403 grounds.

11 If you can prep a redacted version or, counsel, you

12 could stipulate to the dates the emails were sent or the like,
13 but you need to do this quickly because the jury is going to

14 come back in. What else do we need to take up?

15 MS. STERNHEIM: That's all.

16 MS. POMERANTZ: Nothing from the government.

17 THE COURT: Okay. Can you sort out how you're going
18 to get it in? Well, I suppose -- I mean, she's off of cross at
19 this point. Figure it out and you can do it on recross, I
20 suppose. I'll step down for two minutes.
21 (Recess)
22 THE COURT: Counsel, ready to proceed?
23 MS. POMERANTZ: Yes.
24 MR. ROHRBACH: One matter â€”-
25 THE COURT: IT can't hear you, Mr. Rohrbach.
