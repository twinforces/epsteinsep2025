in making your decision in this case.”); Fifth Circuit: (“The indictment

. 1s only an accusation, nothing more. It is not proof of guilt or
anything else. The defendant therefore starts out with a clean slate.”);
Sixth Circuit: (“The indictment ... does not even raise any suspicion of
guilt.”).

The government did. not provide one single document to the court
to back up its claims that the accusers’ allegations about. events. from
1994-97 were truthful. The government has refused to disclose even. the
names of these accusers. Contrary to its assertions to the lower court,
its allegations are not corroborated. Ex.E at 30-33 (“[T]he discovery
contains not. a single contemporaneous email; text message, phone
record, diary entry, police report, or recording that implicates Ms.
Maxwell in the 1994-1997 conduct underlying the conspiracy charged in,
the indictment.”).

The government only made these allegations after Epstein’s
inexplicable death at MCC. Ms. Maxwell was not named tin Epstein’s
indictment as a defendant or a co-conspirator. She was charged as a
substitute for Epstein. Reverse engineering a charge many years later

because of the main target’s death is not the makings.of a strong case.
