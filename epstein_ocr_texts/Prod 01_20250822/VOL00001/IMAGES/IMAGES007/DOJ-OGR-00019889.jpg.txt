The government has not carried its burden. of establishing that no set of conditions
‘will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s.appearance in. court. As set forth below, Ms.
Maxwell’s personal history, her:family and other'tics to this country, and -+her'conduct prior
to her arrest casily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk. of flight.’For these same
reasons, the government, cannot establish, that the strict ‘bail. conditions she proposes, which,
are consistent with a. number.of cases in. this: Circuit in which courts have ordered:release,
will not “reasonably: assure” her presence in court. Accordingly, ‘the Court should order Ms.

Maxwell released pursuant to her-proposed conditions.
