B. Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the
Past Five Years

The government raised concerns at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy and
completeness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Services.
(Dkt. 22 at 11-12; Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Court stated that it did not have “a clear picture of
Ms. Maxwell's:finances and the.resources available.to her” and. therefore.had no way “to set
financial bail conditions that could reasonably assure her appearance in court.” (Tr: 86-87).

To address the Court’s questions about Ms. Maxwell’s finances, defense counsel
retained Macalvins, a highly reputable: accounting firm in the United Kingdom, to conduct
an analysis of Ms. Maxwell’s assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins
accountants reviewed thousands of pages of financial documents, including bank statements,
tax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a clear picture of the assets held by
Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, as well as any assets held in trust for the benefit of Ms.
Maxwell, and the:source of those assets from 2015-2020. This analysis, which is based in.

significant amount of work and has taken substantial tume to complete. It was not possible
to perform this analysis. in the brief time between Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and the initial bail
hearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained following her arrest.
