LC8Cmax7 Rodgers â€”- cross

1 A. Yes.

2 Q. So she had a British accent; isn't that right?

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. Now, looking at that entry at the name of Jane's true first
5 and last name, that is the only time in your flight logs where
6 Jane's true first and last name appears on your flight logs;

7 isn't that right?

8 A. That's correct.

9 Q. But you don't specifically recall this flight; right?
10 A. No.
11 Q. It's just what we see on the flight log; right?
12 A. Correct.
13 Q. A few other questions about Jane. There are no flights
14 that you're aware of on your flight log where anyone with
15 Jane's full name or just her first name and Mark Epstein are on
16 the flights together; right?
17 A. Say that again.
18 Q. Well, we looked at the four flights where we think either
19 Jane's first name appears or her first and last name appear;
20 right?
21 A. Okay.
22 QO. In the 1990s, there were four of them; correct?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. And none of those flights had Mark Epstein, Jeffrey
25 Epstein's brother, on the flights; correct?
