was arrested and has shown no signs of abating. Indeed, in the three months after her arrest, Ms.
Maxwell was the subject of over 6,500 national media articles. That exceeds the number of
articles that mentioned such high-profile defendants as Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Joaquin
“El Chapo” Guzman Loera, and Keith Raniere in the 90-day period following their arrests,
combined. The media coverage has ruthlessly vilified her and prejudged her guilt, and has
exposed her family and friends to harassment, physical threats, and other negative consequences.

But Ms. Maxwell is not the person the media has portrayed her to be; far from it. And
her response to these unfounded allegations remains unchanged: she resolutely and vehemently
denies them, and she is steadfastly committed to remaining in this country, where she has been
since Epstein’s arrest in July 2019, to fight them in court. For Ms. Maxwell to flee, she would
have to abandon her spouse ee. She will not risk destroying the lives
and financial well-being of those she holds most dear to live as a fugitive during a worldwide
pandemic. In fact, every action Ms. Maxwell has taken from the time of Epstein’s arrest up to
the time of the first bail hearing was designed to protect her spouse from
harassment, economic harm, and physical danger. Ms. Maxwell wants to stay in New York and
have her day in court so that she can clear her name and return to her family.

Justice is not reserved solely for the victims of a crime; it is for the accused as well.
Here, justice would be served by granting Ms. Maxwell bail under the comprehensive conditions
we propose. The alternative is continued detention under oppressive conditions that are
unprecedented for a non-violent pretrial detainee, which significantly impair her ability to
participate in her defense and prepare for trial and which jeopardize her physical health and
psychological wellbeing.
