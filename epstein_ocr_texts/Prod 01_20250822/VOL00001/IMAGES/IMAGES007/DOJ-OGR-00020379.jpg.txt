Case 21-58, Document 92, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page21 of 24

into Maxwell’s unit.t Maxwell tries to point to the case of Tiffany Days as
corroboration of supposed sewage flooding, but she critically omits that the flooding
described in the Days case occurred at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the
“MCC”), not the MDC. (See United States v. Days, 19 Cr. 619 (CM) (S.D.N.Y.
Apr. 29, 2021), Sentencing Tr. at 13-16 (describing incidents Tiffany Days
experienced while at the MCC, including flooding of sewage, before being
transferred to the MDC)). There is no evidence in the record from the Days case
or this case that there has been any such flooding or sewage backup at the MDC
during Maxwell’s incarceration there. To the extent Maxwell suggests that any
such issue exists and interferes with her ability to prepare for trial, she can and should
seek relief before the District Court. Similarly, Maxwell’s new complaints about
her ability to review discovery are best raised in the first instance before Judge
Nathan.°

+ Although Maxwell complains that she has been “in solitary confinement” (Mot. at
3), she does not dispute that it would be unsafe for her to be housed in general
population. Indeed, Maxwell has never specifically requested a transfer to general
population. Nor does she dispute that the MDC has made accommodations so that
she is not housed in the SHU while in protective custody. Rather, Maxwell has
access to a day room outside of her cell every day for thirteen hours per day, during
which she has exclusive access to a desktop computer, a laptop computer, a
telephone, a television, anda shower. (See Dkt. 196 at 2).

> As the Government has noted in the District Court, the Government and MDC
have gone to significant lengths to ensure that Maxwell has ample time and resources
