General’s Status Reporton Voluntary Compensation’Program, /:stale. of Jeffrey LE. Epstein, Probate:
No. ST-19=PB-80 (Apr: 14, 2020, VI. Super. ‘Ct.); Notice of Joinder of Motion for Status
Conference Regarding Victim Compensation Fund, /state of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate: No.
ST-19-PB-80 (Apr. 29, 2020, V1.1. Super. Ct.).. The claims resolution. program. is therefore not a
valid basis to. stay this action without-Plaintiff’s consent.”

Third, Maxwell contends that. her motion. to dismiss is “strong and warrants a ‘stay of
discovery pending its resolution.” Plaintiff has already addressed the merits of Maxwell’s motion
to dismiss in.her response to Maxwell’ s letter:requesting a-pre-motion conference on that motion.
ECF No. 48. Judge Schoficld’s. words at:the:pre-motion conference—in which. she:suggested that.
Maxwell’s counsel nof. file a motion, to dismiss—speak for themselves, and demonstrate: that.
Maxwell’s motion to dismiss is anything but “strong”: “I’ve reviewed the letter from defendant;
Maxwell’s counsel, and this ‘particular motion doesn’t strike nic. as any more meritorious” than the
onc previously contemplated by the Estate, which eventually filed an Answer in. licu ofa motion.
to dismiss after a similar pre- -motion conference before: Judge Schofield. Tr. of Apr. 16, 2020
dispositive 1 “motions “do not stay. “discovery, which is also consistent with Judge Schofield’ S
individual rules. Tr: of Nov. 21; 2019:Conf. at:26:10=12; Judge Schofield’s,Individual.Rule IIL.C.2.
(“Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Court docs not Stay discovery or any .other case
management deadlines. during the pendency of ‘a.motion. to dismiss. ”). Maxwell’s. anticipated
motion,to dismiss should not'stay: discovery: in,this matter, just as the Estate’s motions to dismiss
have:not stayed discovery in any other matter against, it, in this District.

The Court should, deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion conference, and deny her
anticipated motion:to stay: discovery :in this ‘matter in its entirety: .Nor is full briefing necessary to
address the: above issues—the anticipated, motion. 'to stay ‘borders: on. frivolous in light of this
Court’s clear statements about staying cases against Epstcin’s Estate and Judge Schoficld’s advice
to Maxwell to refrain from. filing a motion to dismiss. Maxwell, has.already failed to comply with,
her discovery obligations inthis matter, in effect granting herselfia.de. facto stay, and providing for
a full, thréc-week bricfing schedule. on her anticipated ‘Motion. to stay will only give. her another
incentive'to continue to delay. Fact discovery in this matter ends in.less than:two months, and. we:
respectfully submit that her delay tactics should end now.

Respectfully submitted,

‘David ‘Boies, Esq.
ee: Counsel. of Record (via ECF)
: Maxwell, also argucs thatthe. fact ‘that. Plaintiff's sister (and a few other victims) have
voluntarily stayed their cases. in. light of a potential claims resolution program warrants:a. ruling
that Plaintiff'muest stay her case as well. This makes no sensc. Plaintiff and her'sister filed scparate:

actions and are separate litigants. Plaintiff's sister’s decisions do not; bind. Plaintiff, nor do any:
other'victims’ decisions:
