General’s Status Report on Voluntary Compensation Program, Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate
No. ST-19-PB-80 (Apr. 14, 2020, V.I. Super. Ct.); Notice of Joinder of Motion for Status
Conference Regarding Victim Compensation Fund, Estate of Jeffrey E. Epstein, Probate No.
ST-19-PB-80 (Apr. 29, 2020, V.I. Super. Ct.). The claims resolution program is therefore not a
valid basis to stay this action without Plaintiffs consent.”

Third, Maxwell contends that her motion to dismiss is “strong and warrants a stay of
discovery pending its resolution.” Plaintiff has already addressed the merits of Maxwell’s motion
to dismiss in her response to Maxwell’s letter requesting a pre-motion conference on that motion.
ECF No. 48. Judge Schofield’s words at the pre-motion conference—in which she suggested that
Maxwell’s counsel not file a motion to dismiss—speak for themselves, and demonstrate that
Maxwell’s motion to dismiss is anything but “strong”: “I’ve reviewed the letter from defendant
Maxwell’s counsel, and this particular motion doesn’t strike me as any more meritorious” than the
one previously contemplated by the Estate, which eventually filed an Answer in lieu of a motion
to dismiss after a similar pre-motion conference before Judge Schofield. Tr. of Apr. 16, 2020
Conf. at 3:22—24. Further, this Court has explicitly stated that the default in this Court is that
dispositive motions do not stay discovery, which is also consistent with Judge Schofield’s
individual rules. Tr. of Nov. 21, 2019 Conf. at 26:10—12; Judge Schofield’s Individual Rule HI.C.2.
(“Absent extraordinary circumstances, the Court does not stay discovery or any other case
management deadlines during the pendency of a motion to dismiss.”). Maxwell’s anticipated
motion to dismiss should not stay discovery in this matter, just as the Estate’s motions to dismiss
have not stayed discovery in any other matter against it in this District.

The Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion conference, and deny her
anticipated motion to stay discovery in this matter in its entirety. Nor is full briefing necessary to
address the above issues—the anticipated motion to stay borders on frivolous in light of this
Court’s clear statements about staying cases against Epstein’s Estate and Judge Schofield’s advice
to Maxwell to refrain from filing a motion to dismiss. Maxwell has already failed to comply with
her discovery obligations in this matter, in effect granting herself a de facto stay, and providing for
a full, three-week briefing schedule on her anticipated motion to stay will only give her another
incentive to continue to delay. Fact discovery in this matter ends in less than two months, and we
respectfully submit that her delay tactics should end now.

Respectfully submitted,

2 Maxwell also argues that the fact that Plaintiffs sister (and a few other victims) have
voluntarily stayed their cases in light of a potential claims resolution program warrants a ruling
that Plaintiff must stay her case as well. This makes no sense. Plaintiff and her sister filed separate
actions and are separate litigants. Plaintiffs sister’s decisions do not bind Plaintiff, nor do any
other victims’ decisions.
