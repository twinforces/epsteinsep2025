Monitoring of Assets is a Valid and Significant Condition of Release

To address the Court’s concern about Ms. Maxwell’s access to assets, the bail
motion proposed another extremely significant and restrictive bail condition — the
imposition of a monitor to supervise the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse and
approve expenditures. Rather than suggest conditions to satisfy its concerns, the
government urges the Court to summarily reject the proposed monitorship.

William S. Duffey, Jr., a retired federal district court judge and the former United
States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, has agreed to undertake appointment by
the Court as asset monitor. Judge Duffey has extensive experience evaluating and monitoring
funds held in and disbursed from financial accounts. He has agreed to serve by appointment of
the Court in a capacity similar to other trustees and receivers who serve as officers of the Court
and are entrusted, pursuant to court order, with oversight authority to restrain, monitor, and
approve disbursement of assets requiring his signature. Similar to others who have been
appointed by courts to oversee financial matters, Judge Duffey will be compensated at the same
hourly rate billed for his services as an ADR panelist for Federal Arbitration (FedArb).

The proceeds from the sale of Ms. Maxwell’s London home will be restrained and
monitored by Judge Duffey. As required by court order, documentation concerning the
proceeds of the sale will be provided to Judge Duffey and the funds will be deposited in the
financial account approved by Judge Duffey.

The government tries to steer the Court’s attention to allegations of Ms. Maxwell’s lack

restraint on the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse. As previously stated, despite being
questioned by Pretrial Services following a period of solitary confinement, suicide watch, sleep
