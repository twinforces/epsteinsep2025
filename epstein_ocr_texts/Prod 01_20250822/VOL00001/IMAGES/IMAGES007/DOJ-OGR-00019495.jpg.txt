Mr. Boies and Ms. McCawley gave on-air interviews with ABC’ News following Ms.
Maxwell’s detention that contained repeated, presumptively prejudicial quotes, including: ”

Boies:. Remember these girls: were abused:twice, once sexually years ago and then.
a second. time when Epstein and ‘Maxwell and all, their enablers began these
vicious. attacks. on their credibility. ... No question, about it. Maxwell. knows.
where. a, lot of the bodies are buried. If I ‘was somebody who had :participated ‘in.
their scx trafficking, um, I would ‘not be slecping casily tonight.

Boics: I think that: [the accusers] want to see her g goto trial. On, the other ‘hand,
the arrest and conviction, that. would come from a plea, deal is an enormous step
and | think:they also ‘recognize that Jeffrey Epstein, and Maxwell did‘not act alone.
Theré are lots of other people that necd.to, be brought.to justice.

McCawley: I think that the prosecutors in the Southern District: of New York have
done’ an incredible job and, they’re being very‘meticulous, they want; to make sure:

that the Indictments stick. ...They took. a lot. of ‘time ‘to be very, careful. ‘and
thoughtful. and. that gives rhe a lot of hope that she will remain. in. ‘prison, for the:
remainder of her. life. .... This morning was a very joyful and tearful filled

morning, it was a wonderfull moment in my, journey with these survivors, to be:
able to call them, and. fell. them that ‘the one person’s who’s. been out ‘iin, the ‘public:
without: being held accountable was finally: in. prison.....She was really, Ghislaine.
was really. the central. figure, so she worked, hand-in-hand ‘with Jeffrey. Epstein to
be able to. facilitate ‘these crimes, over the, course of, more than. two decades; and
she was the main person who assisted him and allowed him ‘to be able: to

These comments violate subsections (6); arid (7) of the Rule.

It appears that given any opportunity lawycrs associated with. the: prosccution. of this case
will, offer any opinion, that damages Ms., Maxwell’s opportunity for a fair trial. ‘Entry of an order
prohibiting extrajudicial statements, ‘therefore, ‘1S a:necessary remedy’ to avoid. further
dissemination. of prejudicial information. The Court, under Local Criminal. Rule 23.1(h) should
enter an Order, punishable by contempt, that all lawycrs associated with this case, and their
agents, comply: with the Rule and refrain. from publicly: ‘commenting on the seven prohibited
topics identificd in, subsection, (d).
