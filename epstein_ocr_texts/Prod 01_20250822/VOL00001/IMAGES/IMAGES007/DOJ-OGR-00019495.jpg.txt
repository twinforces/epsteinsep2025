Mr. Boies and Ms. McCawley gave on-air interviews with ABC News following Ms.
Maxwell’s detention that contained repeated, presumptively prejudicial quotes, including: ’

Boies: Remember these girls were abused twice, once sexually years ago and then

a second time when Epstein and Maxwell and all their enablers began these

vicious attacks on their credibility. ... No question about it. Maxwell knows

where a lot of the bodies are buried. If I was somebody who had participated in

their sex trafficking, um, I would not be sleeping easily tonight.

Boies: I think that [the accusers] want to see her go to trial. On the other hand,

the arrest and conviction that would come from a plea deal is an enormous step

and I think they also recognize that Jeffrey Epstein and Maxwell did not act alone.

There are lots of other people that need to be brought to justice.

McCawley: I think that the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York have

done an incredible job and they’re being very meticulous, they want to make sure

that the Indictments stick. ...They took a lot of time to be very careful and

thoughtful and that gives me a lot of hope that she will remain in prison for the

remainder of her life. ... This morning was a very joyful and tearful filled
morning, it was a wonderful moment in my journey with these survivors, to be

able to call them and tell them that the one person’s who’s been out in the public

without being held accountable was finally in prison....She was really, Ghislaine

was really the central figure, so she worked hand-in-hand with Jeffrey Epstein to

be able to facilitate these crimes over the course of more than two decades; and

she was the main person who assisted him and allowed him to be able to

perpetrate so many crimes against young females.
These comments violate subsections (6) and (7) of the Rule.

It appears that given any opportunity lawyers associated with the prosecution of this case
will offer any opinion that damages Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity for a fair trial. Entry of an order
prohibiting extrajudicial statements, therefore, is a necessary remedy to avoid further
dissemination of prejudicial information. The Court, under Local Criminal Rule 23.1(h) should
enter an Order, punishable by contempt, that all lawyers associated with this case, and their
agents, comply with the Rule and refrain from publicly commenting on the seven prohibited
topics identified in subsection (d).
