purpose of protecting herself and those close to her from the crush of media and online attention
and its very real harms—those close to her have suffered the loss of jobs, work opportunities,
and reputational damage simply for knowing her. The government’s remaining arguments—
about Ms. Maxwell’s passports, citizenship, travel and financial means— also fail because they
would require that every defendant with multiple citizenship and financial means be denied bail,
which is simply not the law. Finally, as discussed below, the government’s position regarding
the nature and circumstances of the offense and weight of its evidence, which relates to alleged
conduct that is roughly twenty-five years old, is not persuasive and does not alter the bail
analysis. (See infra Section II, pages 9 to 21).

Proposed Bail Conditions. In light of the above, we propose the following bail
conditions, which are consistent with those that courts in this Circuit have imposed in analogous
situations: (i) a $5 million personal recognizance bond, co-signed by six financially responsible
people, all of whom have strong ties to Ms. Maxwell, and secured by real property in the United
Kingdom worth over $3.75 million; (ii) travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern Districts of
New York; (iii) surrender of all travel documents with no new applications; (iv) strict
supervision by Pretrial Services; (v) home confinement at a residence in the Southern District of
New York with electronic GPS monitoring; (vi) visitors limited to Ms. Maxwell’s immediate
family, close friends and counsel; (vii) travel limited to Court appearances and to counsel’s
office, except upon application to Pretrial Services and the government; and (viii) such other
terms as the Court may deem appropriate under Section 3142.

The Bail Reform Act does not discard the presumption of innocence; Ms. Maxwell is
entitled to that presumption here, as she is in all aspects of this case. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(j)
(“Nothing in this section [3142] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of
