1 confidentiality, as your Honor pointed out. And as you will

2 see in a moment, that explains a lot of the spin the government
3 is putting on facts in this case.

4 Your Honor, people have received physical threats. My
5 client has received them. Most of those close to her have

6 received them. They have received death threats. They have

7 been injured in their jobs, in their work opportunities, in

8 their reputations, simply for knowing my client. It's real.

9 Tt's out there. The facts of all the steps the court had to go
10 through just to make the public access available to this

11 proceeding is also a reality.

12 There is a real thing out there having a very

13 significant impact on our client. There are folks who would

14 normally come forward as part of a bail package who your Honor
15 is aware of from the Pretrial Services report who can't now, at
16 least at this point, because of the safety and confidentiality
17 concerns. Since last week our firm alone and my colleagues at
18 Haddon Morgan have been besieged with e-mails and posts, some
19 of them threatening. This is all very real. The government
20 attempts to poo-poo it, to give it the back of the hand. It is
21 very real, and we submit it is a factor for the court to
22 consider in its discretion.
23 Before I go further, your Honor, I would like to go
24 through the 3142(g) analysis. But before I do that, I would
25 like to make one comment about the CVR -- CVRA proceeding under
