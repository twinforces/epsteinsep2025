Streamlining. of, Unscaling Process: As directed by the Court, counsel for. Ms. Maxwell.
conferred with plaintiff's. counsel concerning various proposals to streamline the unscaling
process. Subject to.Ms. Maxwell’s, request-to. temporarily pause the:process as described
above, defense counsel has agreed. to several potential modifications of the Protocol which we
hope will casc ‘the, burden, on the partics and ‘the Court. going ‘forward, should theunscaling
moveahcad. Of note, and.as Plaintiff will explain-to the Court, the parties have agreed.to
notify all of the ‘Non-Partics at onec'so that-we can,understand:which Non-Partics objcct:to the
‘unscaling’ before deciding how’to proceed, with future redactions. Although this will give the
‘Court and the: Original Parties, more information about'the scope of objectors, there are.
limitations ‘to the extent to'which it will expedite the process. As-couinsel has made clear in
the past, it-will take significant cffort by. the: Original. Partics:and their staffto put together the
‘excerpts for: any Non-Party ‘who requests them because cach,Non-Party: will be entitled to sce
his or her own information, (but not that of other Non-Parties). A fter'recciving a-request from
a Non-Party, we anticipate it-will take up to a week per Non-Party: to agree to, the excerpts, to
send to’'them. for review. But on balance We agrce that having a sense of the number of
participating Non-Partics will aid the Court in conducting future proceedings, we have agreed
to. Plaintiff's suggestion.on that front, The parties can submit.a proposed modification. of the
Protocol. and.Notice to the Court to reflect this. agreement.

We also have agrécd, as the Court suggested, to, shorten the time period for the
Original. Partics to object-and to:respond from.14 to 7 days. This would:impact paragraphs
2(d), 2(c) and 2(f) of:the Protocol. The partics can.also submit a proposed:modification of the
Protocol.to the Court.. The parties also agreed to leave the time for Non-Partics to object.at.14
days given. some practical, considerations applicable to them.

although the Parties: were able to'reach some c agreement, ‘we cannot agree to all of

First, we carefully considered the Court's suggestion'to reduce the ‘number of pages of
bricfing’to ten pages per side. Jd. Our initial Objection (DE 1057) was 14 pages long;
Plaintiff's. Response was 19 pages. The Court concluded that our Objection was, in:many’
respects, not specific enough. We would.ask. leave to at least have 15 pages'to object to the
five:motions proposed below, with any. response limited to the same. We will endeavor to
keep it shorter'than that, but also allow for more ‘space to provide specifics to'the Court:
