must be released. because she has. met her limited, burden. of production showing that she does rot
pose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed.to demonstrate that no release condition
or combination. of conditions exist;that,will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in‘ court.

As the. Supreme:Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention
prior fo trial or without-trial ‘is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 481
U.S. 739, 755:(1987). Pretrial detention is. appropriate only where “no condition or combination
of conditions:will reasonably assure the appearance: of the:[defendant].” United States v:
Sabhnani, 493: F.3d. 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3.142(c)). The Bail Reform Act
provides that a court “shall order. the pretrial release” of the defendant (1.8 U.S.C. § 3.142(b))
(emphasis added), but. may impose bail, conditions if “such;rclease will, not reasonably: assure the
appearance” of the defendant in-court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c). Where conditions are necessary;
such release shall. be “subject to the. /east restrictive... .sct of conditions that [the court]
determines will:reasonably assure the appearance of the person.as required.” 18 U.S.C. §
3142(e)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this. statutory. scheme, “it ts only a
limited. group: of offenders:who should be: denied. bail. pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75
