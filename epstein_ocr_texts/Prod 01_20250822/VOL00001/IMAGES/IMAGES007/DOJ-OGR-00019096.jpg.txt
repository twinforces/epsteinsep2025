13 Q. Let's move on, Mr. Rodgers. Let me ask about where you --
14 some of the residences. You said that Epstein's residence in
15 Palm Beach -- well, I don't think you said this. It was
16 located at 358 El Brillo Way; isn't that right?
17 A. That's correct.
18 Q. Do you remember a time when the El Brillo Way residence was
19 being renovated and Epstein had to temporarily move to a rental
20 residence in Palm Beach?
21 A. Yes, I do.
22 Q. Do you recall where the rental residence was Located?
23 A. It was south of where he lived at El Brillo, and it was,
24 from what I remember, right across the street from the ocean.
25 Q. And do you recall when that renovation took place?
