searching (e.g., weekly body scan, 15-minute interval flashlight checks at night, and open-mouth
inspection) despite being surveilled 24/7 by a dedicated three-guard security detail and two
cameras; and the reason she is not being moved to the day room, which we understood was the
original plan (and would reduce searching). Receipt of the letter was acknowledged, but to date
there has been no response and little, if any, redress to the most serious conditions. Upon
information and belief, decisions concerning Ms. Maxwellâ€™s specialized detention are made by
Warden Tellez, or from others outside the MDC. A report from the MDC Legal Department would
provide second-hand information. Accordingly, Warden Tellez should be directed to provide a
first-hand accounting to the Court and counsel why Ms. Maxwell is being detained under such
individualized conditions.
Your consideration is greatly appreciated.

Respectfully submitted,

AUDREY STRAUSS
