LC 7VMAX7 Carolyn - cross

1 THE COURT: Okay. Sustained.

14 omission because Ms. Maxwell's name does not appear in any of
15 these paragraphs.

16 THE COURT: Right. So this is why this one is

17 different than the last document, which is because of paragraph
18 206 and paragraph 12, which expressly reference other unnamed
19 individual employees and assistants. So on that ground I'll
20 sustain on 207.
21 Is there something different in 208?

23 THE COURT: Okay. So sustained on that ground, too.
24 What else?
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: The interrogatory responses, your
