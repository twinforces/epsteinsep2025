1 reason most of that can't be a public document. And what you

2 need to do, since narrow tailoring is required, is to make a

10 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you, Judge.

11 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim, I'm happy to hear if

24 to the side and then go back, but completely understood. And
25 we will prepare a redacted version that can be released to the
