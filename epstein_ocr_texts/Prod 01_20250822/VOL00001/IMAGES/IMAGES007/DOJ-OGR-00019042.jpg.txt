1 screen for just the Court, the deputy, and that's it. I think
2 the government has their copy.
3 THE COURT: I have it on paper.
4 Q. So, Mr. Rodgers, if you just take a look at that. I'm
a going to direct your attention specifically to the second full
6 paragraph. It's towards the end, but why don't you read that
7 whole paragraph. It's right in the middle of the page.
8 THE COURT: Read to himself.
9 Q. Yes, read to yourself. I'm sorry.
10 A. Okay.
11 Q. Mr. Rodgers, I'll ask you, does reading that refresh your
12 recollection that it was your impression that Sarah Kellen took
13 over as Epstein's primary assistant in the late 2000s -- sorry,
14 in late 2001?
15 A. I didn't see Sarah's name mentioned in here.
16 Q. Are you referring to 35 -- it's tab 4.
17 THE COURT: I think -- it wasn't clear what page you
18 were directing to.
19 Q. I'm sorry. I direct you to page 2 of 3, if that wasn't
20 clear, sir.
21 A. I didn't hear that. Page 2?
22 Q. I'm sorry, why don't we try this again.
23 Tf you could refer to page 2.
24 A. Okay.
25 Q. It's the second full paragraph. Just read that paragraph.
