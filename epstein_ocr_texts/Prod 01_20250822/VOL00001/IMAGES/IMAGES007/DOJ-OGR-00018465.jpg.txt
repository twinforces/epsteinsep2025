1 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I would just say that it is not
2 being offered for the truth; it's offered for the fact that she
3 maintained contact with him at a time later than the matters in
4 issue and, therefore, it has relevance.

5 THE COURT: That's the truth, what you just said.

6 It's being offered for the truth that she had contact.

7 MS. STERNHEIM: Well, that part is not hearsay. The

8 content is hearsay. The fact of the contact itself is

9 something else. That's my understanding of it.

10 THE COURT: Well, okay. She said she emailed with

11 him. If you want to redact the content and show that there

12 were emails, I suppose that's another question. But if you're
13 not -- you want the content, which is consistent with what she
14 testified to.

15 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I want the dates.

16 THE COURT: Okay.

17 MS. STERNHEIM: And that is not hearsay.

18 THE COURT: All right. So the dates then I would

19 permit -- I'll hear the government's response to this, but with
20 the content redacted.
21 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I'd like to check the
22 transcript, because I thought she had agreed to the dates. And
23 S06. ==
24 THE COURT: She did.
25 MS. POMERANTZ: So this seems cumulative, your Honor.
