1 Q. Can you please describe the next stage of grooming. I

2 believe we're up to the third stage.

3 A. Okay. So once the perpetrator has access to the child, the
4 next thing that they typically do is engage in a series of

5 deceptive and coercive manipulative behaviors in order to build
6 a relationship of trust, attachment, and dependency. So they

7 will exploit whatever vulnerabilities they've identified in the
8 child, and then put themselves in a position to meet those

9 unmet needs.

10 And that can involve anything from spending time with
11 the child; giving the child special attention; letting the

12 child know that they're unique or special in some way; creating
13 a false sense of family, you know, I'm somebody you can trust,
14 I'm somebody you can rely on; gift giving, sometimes using

15 money or exposing them to things that they wouldn't otherwise
16 have access to. And that generally both increases the

17 likelihood that the child is going to become attached and

18 connected with the perpetrator, but also it increases the

19 perpetrator's power and control over the victim.
20 Q. Dr. Rocchio, you mentioned gift-giving. Based on your
al experience, research, and training, what role can gift-giving
22 play in building a relationship between a child and a
23 perpetrator?
24 A. Gift-giving can certainly be a very powerful inducement and
25 lure in the context of a relationship. Again, especially to
