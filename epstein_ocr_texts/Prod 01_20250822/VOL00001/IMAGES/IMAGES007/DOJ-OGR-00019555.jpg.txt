(“Since the 17th century, grand jury proceedings have: been. closed to the public; and :records of
such proceedings. have: been. kept. from the public cyc. The rule of grand jury scerecy ... is an

to important information.” N.Y. Civil Liberties Union vi. N.C. Transit Auth. (“NYCTA”), 684
F.3d 286, 298 (2d. Cir. 2012) (internal. quotation. marks: omitted). The Circuit has applied two
different approaches ‘when. deciding whether the First..Amendment right applics to. particular

Carty, 464. US. 501, $10(1984)) (internal, citation omitted). “What offends the; First Amendment:
is the attempt to. [exclude the public] ‘without sufficient: justification,” NYCTA, 684. F.3d at: 296,

“specific, on-the-record findings that scaling i is: necessary to preserve higher values and.only if the
