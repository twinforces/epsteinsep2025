The Proposed Bail Conditions
Ms. Maxwell now proposes the following $28.5 million bail package, which is
exceptional in its scope and puts at risk everything that Ms. Maxwell has—all of her and her
spouse’s assets, her family’s livelihood, and the financial security of her closest friends and
family—if she were to flee, which she has no intention of doing.
¢ A $22.5 million personal recognizance bond co-signed by Ms. Maxwell and her
spouse, and secured by approximately $8 million in property and $500,000 in cash.
