Case T:20-Ay-O0Ls2-AJ-DadclAient 2 'Fikd 07/0220 Pagee ot
substantial interest of public health and safety. See United
States v. Alimehmeti, 284 F. Supp. 3d 477, 490 (S.D.N.Y. 2018)
(granting partial closure of courtroom to protect identity of
undercover agents: courtroom was closed to public during
undercover agents’ testimony but audio of testimony was live-
streamed into different courtroom during partial closure and
transcripts of testimony were made available to public
promptly).

C. Third, the court has considered reasonable alternatives to
this partial closure.

The court has considered alternatives to this partial
closure and finds they are neither reasonable nor feasible under
the circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and this case,
particularly the necessity that this hearing be conducted
promptly.

IV. Conclusion

In sum, the court finds that in this case a partial closure
of court proceedings is necessary in that today’s hearing will
be conducted by video and telephone conference. This partial
closure is justified by the substantial interest of protecting
public health and safety from the spread of COVID-19 and is
narrowly tailored to protect that interest. The public
maintains the opportunity to access these proceedings in full by
telephone.
