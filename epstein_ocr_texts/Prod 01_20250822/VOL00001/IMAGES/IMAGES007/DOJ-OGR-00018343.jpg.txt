THE COURT: I thimk what makes sense is she comés inf,
she's sworn before any questions on direct, I give the

instruction, and then ‘the direct testimony begins..

Next issue is the 900 series. The government seeks to
admit photographs, of the intérior of Jeffrey Epstein's New York
apartment taken in 2019, The government claims that the photes
are probative of how EPstéin's apartment appeared when Jane,
who previously testified, saw it as early as 1994 and therefore
corroborates hér téstimony. Trial transcript dt 1075 te 76.

The defense objected to the photos' admission, IL sustained the

objection based on the current record. Trial transeript at
L077.

I noted that. while; quote, older photographs of
immoveable objects and structures may be relevant, end quote,
photos of, quoéte, very moveable objects, end quote, are nét
relevant unless, quote, there is a witness, end, quote, that

cénfirms the phot6s are similar t6 how the objects appeared

years. carlier. Trial transcript. at 1076 to J7.
With the leave of Court, the government filéd a Letter

on, December 4th, 2021, requesting admission of at least a

subset of the photographs: The defense filed a response on

December Sth.

I must détermine the probative value of the photos dnd

then determine if that relevance is substantially outweighed by

unfair prejudice. A photograph of the scene may be relevant
