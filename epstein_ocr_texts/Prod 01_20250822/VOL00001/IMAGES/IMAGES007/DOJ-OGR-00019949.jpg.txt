The government has spoken. with the Department ‘of

Justice attachés in the United Kingdom and France.

With respect. to France, we have been informed that
Francé will not extradite a French Citizen to the United States
as a matter of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of
the United States,

As well, we have been, informed, that there is an
extradition treaty bétweéen the United Kingdom and the United
States. The extradition process would be lengthy, the outcome
would be uncertain, and it's very likely that the defendant
would not be detained during the pendency of such an
extradition proceeding.

Those circumstances raise real concerns here.

Particularly because the defendant appears to have the
financial means to Jive beyond the reach of extradition
indefinitely. As we detailed in our briefing, your Honor, the
defendant appears to have access to Significant and
undetermined and undisclosed wealth.
