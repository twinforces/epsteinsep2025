1 ties. While she is a naturalized citizen of the United States,
2 she is a citizen of France and the United Kingdom. She grew up
3 in the United Kingdom and has a history of extensive

4 international travel. She owns a property in the

iy United Kingdom. Your Honor, there is a real concern here that
6 the defendant could live beyond the reach of extradition

7 indefinitely.

8 The government has spoken with the Department of

9 Justice attach√©s in the United Kingdom and France.

10 With respect to France, we have been informed that

11 France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States
12 as a matter of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of
13 the United States.

14 As well, we have been informed that there is an

15 extradition treaty between the United Kingdom and the United

16 States. The extradition process would be lengthy, the outcome
17 would be uncertain, and it's very likely that the defendant

18 would not be detained during the pendency of such an

19 extradition proceeding.
20 Those circumstances raise real concerns here.
21 Particularly because the defendant appears to have the
22 financial means to live beyond the reach of extradition
23 indefinitely. As we detailed in our briefing, your Honor, the
24 defendant appears to have access to significant and
25 undetermined and undisclosed wealth.
