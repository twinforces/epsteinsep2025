PROTECTIVE ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell...regarding procedures to be.

followed that-shall, govern the handling of confidential material. SO ORDERED:
(Signed by Judge: Alison.J. Nathan on: 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/3 1/2020)

MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine.Maxwell. Both parties have

asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree. on most‘of the
language, two areas of dispute. have, cinerged. First, Ms. Maxwell sécks, language.
allowing her to’publicly reference. alleged’ victims or witnesses who have, spoken: on
the public: record to:the media or in: ‘public fora, or in.litigation'relating’to:Ms. Maxwell.
or Jeffrey: Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell secks language restricting: ‘potential
Government witnesses and ‘their counsel, from using discov. ery materials for-any

purpose other than_preparing for the criminal trial in/this action. The Government has

proposed contrary’ language: on. both.of'these issues. For the following reasons, the

‘Court adopts the Government's proposed ;protective order Under Federal Rule of

Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the court:may, ‘for good. cause; deny;

restrict, ‘or defer discovery or inspection, or'grant-other appropriate relief." The: good

cause. standard " "requires courts to balance several interests, including: whether
disScmination of the discovery materials;inflicts hazard:to others..; «whether the.

‘imposition of the protective. order would prejudice: the defendant,” and."the public's
‘interest inthe information.” United. States'v. Smith, 985: F. Supp. .2d 506, 522

(S.D:N.Y.. 2013). The. party secking to restrict disclosure. bears the. burden of showing

good. cause. Cf. Gambale'v. Deutsche Bank AG; 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds that the Government has met.its burden, of showing, good:cause’
‘with regard to restricting. the ability'of.Ms. Maxwell:to publicly:reference ‘alleged
victims and,witnesses other than those who have: publicly identified themselves in this

litigation. AS a general matter; itis. undisputed ; that there is a strong and specific

‘interest in‘protecting ‘the priv acy of alleged. victims and: witnesses in this case that

supports restricting the disclosure of: their:identities. Dkt. No.,29 at 3 (acknowledging

‘that. ag a baseline the protective order:should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, deferise

counsel, and, others on the defense: teani from, disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any: alleged. victim. or potential witness referenced:in. the discov ‘ery“matcrials”); see.
also United States v. G orley,.No. 13-cr—-48,, 2016 U:; S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at #11
(S:D:N.Y.. Jai: 15; 2016). The Defense argues this interests significantly diminished
for individuals who haye spoken on the public record about.Ms. Maxwell or Jetfrey:

‘Epstein, because they‘have:voluntarily:chosen to identify themselves. But not all —

accusations ‘or:public statements are ‘equal. Deciding to participate:in or contribute to a
ériminal inv estigation Of Prosecution; ig.a far different-matter than simply making a.

public ‘statement, "relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a

statement might have oceurred decades ago and ‘have:no relevance to the: charges 4 in.
