ARGUMENT
The District Court Properly Denied Maxwell’s Motions for Bail and
Temporary Release

27. Judge Nathan did not clearly err when she determined that
Maxwell is a risk of flight and that no conditions would reasonably assure her
appearance in court. Nor did Judge Nathan abuse her discretion or clearly err by
denying Maxwell’s request for temporary release.

A. Applicable Law

28. In seeking pretrial detention, the Government bears the burden
of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant poses a risk of
flight, and that no condition or combination of conditions would reasonably assure
her presence in court. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f); United States v. Sabhnani, 493 F.3d
63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007).

29. Where the defendant is charged with certain offenses, including
offenses involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, a statutory
presumption arises “that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably
assure the appearance of the person as required... .” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E). In
such a case, the defendant “bears a limited burden of production—not a burden of
persuasion—to rebut that presumption by coming forward with evidence that he
does not pose a ... risk of flight.” United States v. Mercedes, 254 F.3d 433, 436 (2d
