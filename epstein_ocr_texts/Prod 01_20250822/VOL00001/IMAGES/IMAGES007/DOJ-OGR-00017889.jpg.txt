THE COURT: State your objection.

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, this, is very similar ‘to a
police report in which a third party is transmitting

information to a business. Yes, they rely on Gertain pieces of

information ‘contained in that report to de their job; but as

the case law holds, that doesn't make ‘the entire police report

admissible under the business. records. exception,

When information is reported by 4 third ‘party, the
information has to have its own sources of reliability in order
for it to be useful t6 the business. While they ay. tiake a
decision, for example, to file changes, there may be inaccurate
information, dnd that's why police records are traditionally

excluded because they are meflections of third-party

information that S6nly portions may be reliable.
In this case, certainly I understand the school did

contact her and f6llow up with her and she beanie admittéd.

But there are other pieces of information ‘that are being

offered for the truth of the matter asserted therein. In
pagticular, I, imagine that Mr. Epstein, ultimately became
financially responsible because that's what's listed in the
form. However, what. this mecond would tend, to show is that
someone == we don't eveh know if it was the Jane 6r her
mother -- filled out the form, had an expectation or wrote that
name down on the form at the time without any subsequent
