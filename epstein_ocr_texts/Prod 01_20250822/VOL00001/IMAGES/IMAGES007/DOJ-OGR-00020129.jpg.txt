combination of conditions.can ensure her appearance. This is so because: the charges, which
carry a presumption of detention, are serious and carry lengthy terms of imprisonment if
convicted; the evidence proffered by the Government, including multiple corroborating and
corroborated witnesses, is strong; the Defendant has substantial resources.and foreign ties
(including citizenship in a country that does not extradite its citizens); and the Defendant, who.
lived in hiding and apart from the family to whom she now asserts important ties, has not been
fully candid about her financial situation. Thus, for substantially the same reasons that the Court
denied the Defendant’s first motion for release on July 14,.2020, the Court DENIES the
Defendant’s renewed motion for release on bail.!
I. Background

On June 29,.2020, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a six-count
Indictment against the Defendant, charging her with facilitating Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of
multiple minor victims between approximately 1994 and 1997. See Dkt. No. 1. On July 2,.2020,
the Indictment was unsealed, and that same day, the Defendant-was arrested in New Hampshire.
On July 8, 2020, the Government filed a Superseding Indictment, which contained only small
ministerial corrections. Dkt. No. 17.

On July 14, 2020, this Court held a hearing regarding the Defendant’s request for bail.
After a thorough consideration of all of the Defendant’s arguments and of the.factors set forth in
18 U.S.C. § 3142(g), the Court concluded that.no conditions or. combination of conditions could
reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance, determining as a result that the Defendant was a

flight risk and that detention without bail was warranted under 18'U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). The

' This Opinion & Order will be temporarily sealed in order to allow the parties to propose
redactions to sensitive or confidential information.
