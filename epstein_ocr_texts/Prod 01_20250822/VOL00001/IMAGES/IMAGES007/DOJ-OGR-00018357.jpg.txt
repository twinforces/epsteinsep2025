(In open court)

THE COURT: -Anything else to take up?

MR. EVERDELL: Nothing from the défense, ‘your Honor.

MS, MOE: Your Honor, ‘one last issue with respect to
threé @xhibits. We had a chance to review the transcript from

last week from the cross examination of Jane, we noticed that

there were three défense Exhibits, ‘that were offered which were
not offered under seal but which contained identifying
information for Jane, so we wanted to address, 'that. ‘We
conferred with defense about that.

Taking those exhibits in order, the first is
Defendant's Exhibit J15. So this exhibit contains some
redactions, but there is additional identifying information as
to Jane. If flagged, that for defense counsel. What we would
propose is that we work together to mark a further redacted

version which 'would, become J15R, and that JLS itself would

remain as it is and under seal as it is offered during her
testimony. So we'll work with the defense to propose
additional redactions, tiark that, and make sure tHat that's in
the record, but I just wanted to flag that because, as it
stands, the undérlying exhibit is not yet received under seal
and, because that contains identifying information, we'd, ask
that that. exhibit be sealed at this juncture.

MS. MENNINGER: I don't believe that, J15 does have
other additional identifying information; but I'm happy to
