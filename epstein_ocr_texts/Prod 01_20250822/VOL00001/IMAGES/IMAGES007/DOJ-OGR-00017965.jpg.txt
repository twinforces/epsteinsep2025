LC2Qmax3 Rocchio â€” Cross

1 Q. Well, let's talk about specific individual behaviors, for

2 example. My grandfather used to take me to the Bronx Zoo, and
3 I liked going there. Is that a grooming behavior or not a

4 grooming behavior?

5 A. Given that in your hypothetical I'm assuming he wasn't

6 taking you there for the purposes of sexual abuse, it would not
7 be.

8 Q. So the importance there is whether or not someone is doing
9 something for an improper purpose. Is that correct?
10 A. So, the intent around sexual exploitation and abuse is
11 built into the definition of grooming when it's being used in
12 the discussions of child sexual abuse, yes.
13 Q. Right. So there are many things that parents do, for
14 example, that are normal behaviors that would not be considered
15 grooming behaviors, true?
16 A. True.
17 Q. Such as buying presents for their children, correct?
18 A. Yeah.
19 Q. Taking their children to special places, correct?
20 A. YSS.
21 Q. Treating the child specially, correct?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Paying attention to the child, correct?
24 A. Again, in the context of a healthy normal relationship, no,
25 that would not be considered grooming.
