Case 20-3061, Document 1-2, 09/09/2020, 2927741, Page18 of 19
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/31/2020)
