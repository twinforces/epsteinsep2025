LC8Cmax5 Rodgers - direct

1 THE COURT: I'll consider it after you confer, but you
2 know where it was. And that's all I have.

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, on that point, I'm assuming
4 what the Court means is if there is a new issue raised that

a wasn't raised during the examination is the problem. Is that

6 what the Court is alluding to?

7 THE COURT: Having not admitted it pending what all

8 along had been the government's proffer as to the anticipated

9 testimony of an anticipated witness, I didn't admit it

10 following Mr. Alessi's testimony. It's true that there was

11 voir dire on it, but I don't know what new argument will be

12 asserted, and it strikes me that the fact that it -- whatever
13 argument is being made in the absence of the witness could be
14 an issue.

15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Right. That's what I understand. That
16 was my understanding. I get it.

17 THE COURT: I'm open to arguments. Obviously, both

18 sides have reargued many issues and I keep an open mind.

19 Anything else?
20 MS. COMEY: Not from the government, your Honor.
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Nothing from the defense, your Honor.
