LC1Qmax6 Jane â€”- Redirect

1 Q. To be clear, would you give that money back if it meant

2 that you weren't abused as a kid?

3 MS. MENNINGER: Objection. Leading, your Honor.

4 THE COURT: Sustained.

5 Q. Jane, in your own words, can you tell the jury what that

6 money meant to you?

7 A. Sorry.

8 Q. It's all right. Take your time.

9 A. I mean, it -- oh, I wish I would have never received that
10 money in the first place because of what happened. You know,
11 when you're seeking some sort of closure, and I guess in, you
12 know, laws in this country, compensation is the only thing you
13 can get to try to move on with your life and for the, you know,
14 pain and abuse and suffering that I received, and all the
15 out-of-pocket money I paid to try to make this go away and to
16 try to fix myself.

17 MS. MENNINGER: Objection. Narrative, your Honor.
18 THE COURT: Overruled.
19 A. So, you know, hopefully this just puts it all to an end,
20 and I can move on with my life.
al Q. Do you have any financial stake in the outcome of this
22 trial?
23 A. No.
24 MS. MOE: Nothing further, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: Okay. Ms. Menninger.
