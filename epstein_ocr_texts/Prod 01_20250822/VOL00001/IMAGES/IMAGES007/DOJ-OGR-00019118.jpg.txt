LC8VMAX8

1 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, to be frank, we do -â€”- the

2 government has shaved a considerable amount of its case off in
3 the last day. And we have witness issues. People are

4 traveling. We had been budgeting that we would start our case
S the following week after the three-day break, simply because we
6 thought, given the number of witnesses that were left, that we
7 would be maybe even going into the following week before the

8 defense case started.

9 So given that they have now trimmed their case

10 significantly in the last day, we are trying to hustle

11 witnesses. It's not that easy. So our strong preference, your
12 Honor, would be that if we can start the defense case the

13 following -- I'm sorry, Thursday of the following week. So we
14 would fill up Friday with the charge conference, if the Court
15 isn't -- if we want to do it at a later time, we can also do

16 that. But we prefer not to start the defense case until --

17 THE COURT: Right. I think we've come around to the
18 request, which is given the expedition of the government's

19 case, your request is to start the defense case, whatever it
20 looks like, on Thursday when we return.
21 MR. EVERDELL: That is the request, your Honor.
22 THE COURT: And so if we can use this Friday for the
23 charging conference, we could do that or we could do the
24 charging conference on the evening of the 16th.
25 MR. EVERDELL: Yes.
