1 A. Okay.

2 Q. Is your name in that book?

3 A. No, my name is not in the book.

4 Q. Is your wife's name in that book?

5 A. No.

6 Q. Is Sarah Kellen's name in that book?

7 A. Excuse me?

8 QO. Is Sarah Kellen, is her name in the book?

9 A. No.

10 Q. Do you want to go ahead and take a look at that book,

11 please, and tell me if you see Sarah Kellen's name in it?

12 THE COURT: Just a moment.

13 He's looking at the binder.

14 MS. COMEY: Oh, no. May I approach, your Honor?

15 THE COURT: You may.

16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, I'm going to object to this
17 process. He answered no, and this is essentially a leading

18 question to change the answer.

19 THE COURT: I'll sustain the leading objection. But
20 otherwise, I'll allow it. Well, I'll permit the question that
21 you asked. So I'll allow the question, which is, is Sarah
22 Kellen's name in the book?
23 MS. COMEY: I think I'm asking him to look in the
24 exhibit.
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: And that's my objection, your Honor.
