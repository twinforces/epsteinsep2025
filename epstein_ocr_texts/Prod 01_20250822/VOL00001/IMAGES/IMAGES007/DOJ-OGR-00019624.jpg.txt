“in ways that are only imperfectly reparable by appel-
late reversal of a final district court judgment is not
sufficient.” Punn, 737 F.38d.at 5. “Instead, the decisive
consideration is whether delaying review until the en-
try of final judgment would imperil a substantial pub-
lic interest, or some particular value of a.-high. order.”

Intl Lid. v. Republic of Congo, 461. F.3d 238, .241 (2d
Cir. 2006). Ina criminal case, the availability of post-
judgment relief through rever sal or vacatur of convic-
tion, if warranted, will generally be sufficient to pro-
tect whatever right a defendant claims was abridged
by the district court’s pretrial decision. See, e.g:, Punn,
737 F.3d at 14 (“Punn’s claim can be adequately vindi-
cated upon appeal from a final judgment.... [I]f
Punn’s arguments continue to fail before the district
court, purportedly ill-gotten evidence or its ‘fruits are.
admitted at his trial, and conviction results, appellate
review will be available at that point[;] ... [and the
Court].may order anew trial without the use se of the ill;
gotten evidence, or ‘whatever additional remedies are.
necessary to ensure that Punn’s legitimate interests
are fully preserved.”); United States v. Hitchcock, 992.
F.2d 236,'239 (9th Cir. 1998) (district court’s refusal to
seal doctiments not immediately appealable because
“(rjeversal after trial, if it is warranted, will ade-
quately protect ... interest[s]” asserted by defend-
ants).

trial discovery orders.” Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v.
