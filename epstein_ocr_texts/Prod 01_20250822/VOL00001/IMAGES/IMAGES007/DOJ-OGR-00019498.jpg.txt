Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

On behalf of our'cliént, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respéctfiilly request'that' the Court enter a.
protective order in the form attached hereto.as Exhibit A.

The government has indicated ‘that: it requires ‘the entry. of a. protective order before
producing any. discovery material to Ms. Maxwell. On July 9, 2020, the government :provided.
défense. counsél ‘with an initial draft of a proposed protective order. Since that timé, the partiés
have conferred several ‘times. on. conference calls and by email, and have been. able to reach.
agreement on.almost all. of the-provisions of the proposed protective order.

Two, key disputes remain, however, ‘which require the Court’s guidance. J/:irs?, the.
defense, bélieves that potential government witnesses, and. their counsel should bé subject 'to the
same restrictions as ‘the: defense: concerning appropriate: use of the discovery materials—namely,
if these individuals are given.access to. discovery materials during trial. preparation, they may not
use ‘those materials for any purpose other than preparing for trial in the criminal case, and. may.
not post those materials on the Internet. Second, the defense believes it should not: be restricted,
from publicly disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged. ‘victiins, or potential
witnesses: referénced in the discovéry materials who have already: identified themselves by
speaking on. the public record.

As ‘set. forth, below, ‘we believe that; the: proposed protective order contains appropriate:
restrictions that aré no broader than necéssary' to protect.the privacy interests of‘ individuals
