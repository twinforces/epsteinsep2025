PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

The only issue before'the Court is whether conditions exist that can reasonably assure.
Ms. Maxwell’s appearance during this case. On this renewed application, Ms. Maxwell has put
before the Court a significant bail package, supported! by detailed submissions, which. warrant
her release:on strict conditions.. She and her spouse have committed to signing a bond inthe full
amount of their‘net:worth, regardless of the ownership of the underlying assets. She has
proffered seven additional ‘sureties, consisting ofther family and.close friends, many of whom-are
USS. citizens and long-time residents, who have come forward:at great personal risk.and have
pledged ‘meaningful assets. The government does:not challenge the good faith and bona fides of
financial condition; sipported by voluminous.documentation. The government does not.
challenge the report’s findings, nor its underlying documentation. She has agreed,-in writing, to
‘give up any right she has or could. have to contest extradition and. submit to-all other standard
travél restrictions. And she has ‘noted that 4 key representation made by the governinient at'the
initial bail hearing as to the strength of its evidence is simply not accurate-[
LT and there is no “significant contemporaneous documentary
evidence” that corroborates. its case.

With regard to any other defendant, this record would readily support release on strict
bail conditions, perhaps even on consent. But this:is Ghislaine. Maxwell, the apparent:substitute
for Jeffrey Epstein. So, instead, in-its zesponse the government urges the Court to disregard the
significant ‘additional evidence proffered to the Court and further argues'that a defendant cannot
be. eligible for bail (apparently on. any conditions), unless. she can:provide.an absolute guarantee
