been:influenced by the suggestion of others, including his. girlfriend at, the time and.the police who
cam to question him.in the hospital.

With regard to Mr. Robertson’s history and. characteristics, his history of violating past.
conditions, of release ‘is a source: of concern, as the Court noted when denying him release last:
September. See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form 13 PSR.:notes several
instanecs in. which his: probation was revoked for ‘failure to comply: with, conditions of release.
Doc. 188 at:8=10. Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions. /d. However; as, the defense
has pointed out, none of’ Mr. .Robertson’s probation. revocations appear to have: involved him.
absconding; although he has convictions for illegal, firearm possession, he does not, have any
convictions for violent offenses; and, he turned himself after’ being charged in the instant.case. Jd.
seealso Doc. 274 at 4-5.

Finally, with regard to the nature.and seriousness of the danger that would be’posed.to any
person, or ‘the. community’ by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the govertiment’s
concerns given the frightening allegations in,this'casc. Mr. Robertson. is presumed innocent on all,
charges until proven guilty; however: See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(j) (“Nothing ‘in this section shall, be
construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). .Presuming Mr. Robertson’s
‘innocence in this case, while he'is someone who has been convicted-of gun and. drug offenses and.
has failed. to,coniply with.conditions of:release in the: past, he is not someone with a proven history’
‘of violent behavior.” ‘Nor is'the Court: persuaded. by the:government’s vague suggestions that Mr.
Robertson:might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this, case because it has. provided.
no. coneréte. or specific evidence, to substantiate any such ‘claims. For example, the government’s
‘cryptic report:that:-witness’N.F. was allegedly contacted-by an unnamed individual about'this case

*'While Mr. Robertson, does haye prior‘arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are
therefore unproven allegations. See Doc. 188 at ‘11-15.
