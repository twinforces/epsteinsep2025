LC2VMAX6 Alessi — Direct

1 THE COURT: So I want to ask, there was an objection

2 to a question on foundation. The question was, is this -—- do

3 you know if this is the same book or a later book. I wanted to
4 hear the answer to that. But looking at it, I don't know what
a his basis for knowledge is for saying that it's the later book.
6 So you can inguire into that or I'll -- yes?

7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, I guess if he left in 2002 and

8 the book is after 2002, I don't think there can be a basis for
9 knowledge.

10 THE COURT: Well, I'll allow the question to be asked.
11 And if there's not, then I will agree with you and I'll strike
12 the testimony.

13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Okay.

14 MS. COMEY: Understood, your Honor.

15 THE COURT: So that's one.

16 And then two, I just want to make sure I understand,
17 because the letter indicated this witness, sort of a new person
18 to authenticate, as opposed to the original witness who you

19 indicated would authenticate; correct?
20 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. That other witness we
al believe could also authenticate it, but —-
22 THE COURT: Right. So it seems to me when you're
23 finished here and after the voir dire, I can sustain the
24 objection, overrule the objection, or reserve until I hear
25 additional. Any reason not to do it that way?
