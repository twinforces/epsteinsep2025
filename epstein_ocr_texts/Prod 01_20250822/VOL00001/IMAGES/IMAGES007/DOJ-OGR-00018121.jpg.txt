LBUCmaxl1

Maguire is an FBI agént who assisted with ‘the search of
Mr, Epstein's Manhattan tewnhouse in July of 2019. So that's

after his arrest, ‘they executéd several séarch warrants at his

Manhattan townhouse, collected. a number of items of evidence,
and, took photographs of thé exterior and the intérior of the
townhouse.

My Understanding iS that ‘the governmént plans t6
introduce a number of the photographs of the exterior and
interior through Ms. Maguire, who was, present during the
search, and also certain physical items like they're not -—-
well, there wére Hard drives that were found and GDs that were
found. Those I don't believe are going to. be admitted, but
she's going to discuss them, and there is als6é some physical
items like costumes and, a massage ‘table there.

I think we should start with the physical items,
because LI did with confer with the government and we neached
some agreément. or uhderstanding about. the hard drives and the
disc because they purportedly contain information that relates
back to the time pericod of the Conspiracy, we don't have an
Lssue with, and my understanding is they're not going to
introduce thé hard drives or the diseés themselves, or even
photographs of the hard drives or the disc. So that. I don't,
think i5 dn issue if I'm correct, Ms. Moe?

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: So other physical items that might come in
