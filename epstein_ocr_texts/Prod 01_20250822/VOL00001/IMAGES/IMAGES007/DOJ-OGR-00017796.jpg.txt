S Q. And in June of 2020, you answered, through your attorney,

6 interrogatories, right?

7 A. Right.

8 Q. And interrogatory number nine, if I could have you turn to
9 that, on page 4, asked you to identify all persons other than
10 decedent, Mr. Epstein, who have ever committed or attempted to

11 commit sexual misconduct or offenses against or otherwise
12 concerning you, including, without limitation, any unwelcome
13 behavior of a sexual nature, sexual abuse, sexual assault,
14 threats or intimidation of a sexual nature or sexual
15 exploitation, regardless of whether the misconduct or offenses
16 involved physical touching, and you responded none. Correct?
17 MS. MOE: Objection.
18 THE COURT: Are you moving this?
19 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor, this interrogatory.
20 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I think the record is that this
21 witness doesn't recognize it, doesn't know anything about it,
22 and so for that reason we'd object.
23 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, it's a legally binding
24 document.
25 THE COURT: Can I see the whole document?
