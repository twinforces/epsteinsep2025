LC8VMAX4 Rodgers - direct

1 Q. Other than on one of Mr. Epstein's planes, how else would

2 you interact with Ms. Maxwell between 1994 and 2004?

3 A. Early on it would be by beeper, if she needed something;

4 and then later on we had cell phones. And, you know,

5 occasionally I would see her at the office, and obviously on

6 the airplane.

7 Q. Other than on the airplane and at the office, did you ever
8 see Ms. Maxwell anywhere else in person?

9 A. Yes, I would see her at her house.

10 Q. Why would you go to her house?

11 A. She had first aid kits that we also had maintained on our
12 airplane; and so we provided her with those first aid kits.

13 And so they had to be refurbished once a year. So I would go
14 there to pick it up, and then return it after it got

15 refurbished.

16 Q. Between 1991, when you first met her, and 2004, what

17 residences of Ms. Maxwell's did you personally visit?

18 A. The first one would have been on 59th Street near Columbus
19 Circle. The second one would have been a studio apartment, not
20 sure of the location, probably Upper East Side of Manhattan.
21 And then she had an apartment, large apartment, on 84th Street.
22 And then she had a townhouse on 65th Street.
23 Q. I want to walk through each of those, please.
24 When did you go to the 59th Street apartment?
25 A. In the fall of 1991. I don't recall exactly when.
