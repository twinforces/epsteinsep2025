“issue is finally resolved and is independent of the is-
sues to be tried, and the order becomes moot if review
awaits conviction and sentence.” Flanagan, 465 U.S.
at 266. Unlike a request for bail reduction, however,
an order denying modification of a protective order
does not become moot upon conviction and sentence.
“The standard for review set forth in Flanagan is
not easily met,” and Maxwell has not done so here. Ca-
parros, 800 F.2d at 25. To the extent Maxwell still
wishes to use materials she obtained through criminal
discovery for other purposes after entry of final judg-
ment in the criminal case, she can seek authorization
from this Court to do so then. If Maxwell complains
that her inability to use criminal discovery materials
in civil matters may result in premature unsealing or
prejudicial pretrial publicity, she can likewise raise
those claims before this Court on appeal after entry of
final judgment in her criminal case. See, e.g., United
States v. Martoma, No. 13-4807, 2014 WL 68119, at *1
(2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2014) (concluding that even though the
defendant’s “personal interest in the privacy of embar-
rassing information is an interest that, as a practical
matter, cannot be vindicated after disclosure,” that in-
terest is insufficient to merit interlocutory appeal);
United States v. Guerrero, 693 F.3d 990, 998 (9th Cir.
2012) (finding no jurisdiction over defendant’s inter-
locutory appeal from unsealing of competency evalua-
tion because “any alleged incursions on criminal de-
fendants’ rights to privacy and a fair trial do not ren-
der the unsealing order effectively unreviewable on ap-
peal”); Hitchcock, 992 F.2d at 238-39 (district court’s
