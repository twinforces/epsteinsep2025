Ms. Maxwell has a number of other family members and friends who, under normal
circumstances, would also co-sign and secure her bond. She is not relying on them in
connection with this bail application in an effort to safeguard their privacy and protect them
and their families from harm.

The proposed bail conditions are consistent with those approved by courts in this
Circuit in other high-profile cases, and should be approved here. See, e.g., United States v.
Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24, 32 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (alleged leader of Genovese crime family
who was charged with racketeering and extortion granted release subject to conditions),
aff'd, 749 F. App’x 20 (2d Cir. 2018); United States v. Dreier, 596 F. Supp. 2d 831, 832
(S.D.N.Y. 2009) (Marc Dreier, accused of “colossal criminality” and alleged to be a “high
flight risk,” granted release subject to conditions); United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d
240, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (Bernie Madoff, charged with “largest Ponzi scheme ever” and
alleged to be a “serious risk of flight,” granted release subject to conditions).
not have Ms. Maxwell’s means, would be released on bail conditions. Accordingly, if the Court deems it necessary,
it may impose private security guards as a condition of release.
