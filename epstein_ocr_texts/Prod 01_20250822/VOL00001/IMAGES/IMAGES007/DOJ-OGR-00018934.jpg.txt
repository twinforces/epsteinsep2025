Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 755 Filed 08/10/22 Page 72 of 262 1777
LC8Cmax3 Hesse â€” direct

1 In particular, your Honor, many of these messages have
2 the first and last name of a victim who testified yesterday

3 under the name Carolyn. And so it confirms that a person with
4 that name was contacting the house during the relevant

5 timeframe of the charged conspiracy.

6 THE COURT: Just so I understand the government's

7 argument, you are offering for the truth, but it's the hearsay
8 exception that proffering is the business record exception?

9 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. If I could just have one
10 moment.

11 THE COURT: Yes.

12 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Just to be more precise.
13 I've been using the shorthand business records, but here the

14 issue is about whether it's record of a regularly conducted

15 activity within an organization.

16 THE COURT: Mr. Pagliuca.

17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor. Just so that the

18 record is clear, there are four, I will call them message slips
19 per page. Many of these message slips don't have dates, don't
20 have signatures, and have very sort of cryptic explanations
21 about what is or isn't being purported to be recorded here.
22 This witness, I think, maybe has the ability to
23 authenticate four or five of these separate slips, but has no
24 knowledge about the other slips.
25 THE COURT: I'm sorry. So is that a 901 objection?
