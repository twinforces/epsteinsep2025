Honor. This is Classically what someone would do in a4 closing
argument. You can. put this in a Power Point and put up a

sereén, that shows 'this, and then put up a scréen that. shows

that, and then. make an. argument about it.

And if they wantéd to elicit this testimony, it should
have been done, I believe, with a witness that then could be
cross-exdmined substantively about what was being discussed.

This. witness, Mr, -—- if I'm saying it correctly,

Mr. Buscemi, can't be cross-examined Substantively about
anything; all he's going to be able to say would be, I looked
at this, and I looked at that, and I looked at this, I lodked

at that, and those are the exhibits.

So I guess I'm a little confused about the process,
where one would, just, Look at, a jury and, say, Look at this and
tHheh look at that. And TF don't understand why that isn't, Sort
of, impermissibly highlighting certain, pieces of evidence. And
then, you khow, am I allowed to gét up and say, Why don't. you
Look at this and why don"t you Jook at that? It just seems
rather awkward to me to bé doing it in that fashioén.

MS. MOE: Your Honor, that's why we ‘propose doing this
with a witness, to6 avéid any, sort of, awkwardness, But, I
don't understand the objection, to publishing items that ane in
evidence that the jury has not yet seen. Again, Sur hopé was
for this to be very streamlined; but I understand the Court's
concerns.
