government’s ad hominem suggestion that Ms. Maxwell has “cherry-pick[ed] materials” to seek
an “advantage in their efforts to defend against accusations of abuse” or “delay court-ordered
disclosure of previously sealed materials” reveals a fundamental (or feigned) lack of

Ms. Maxwell simply seeks to alert the judicial officers in the related Civil Litigation to facts
about which her adversary is already aware.
Issuance of the Subpoenas Not “Standard Practice”:
Second, the government tries to normalize, without citation to authority, its conduct as “standard
practice.” Resp. at 2. To the contrary, the controlling case in this Circuit, Martindell v. Int’l
Telephone & Telegraph Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 293 (2d Cir. 1979), mandates a wholly different
procedure: the use of a non-ex parte subpoena with an opportunity for the aggrieved party to
move to quash. Similar cases in this district demonstrate the “non-standard” nature of the
government’s conduct regarding these subpoenas. For example, Judge Koeltl observed when
considering whether to release a single deposition transcript to the government: “the Second
Circuit has made clear that the Government may not use its ‘awesome’ investigative powers to
seek modification of a protective order merely to compare the fruits of the plaintiff's discovery in
a civil action with the results of a prosecutorial investigation in a criminal action.” Botha v. Don
King Prods., Inc., No. 97 CIV. 7587 (JGK), 1998 WL 88745, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 27, 1998)
(citing Minpeco S.A. v. Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 743 (2d Cir. 1987) and
Martindell, 594 F.2d at 297).
