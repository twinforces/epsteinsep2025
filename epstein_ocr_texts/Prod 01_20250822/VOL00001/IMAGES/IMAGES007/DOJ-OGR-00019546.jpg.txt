SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK.

‘United States. of America,

a
20-CR-330 (AJN)
Ghislaitic Maxwell,
MEMORANDUM.

Defendant. OPINION -& ORDER.

ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

Both. parties have asked for the Court to.enter.a. protective order. While they agree.on
most ofthe language, two areas of: dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell 'secks language:
allowing. her to publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public
record to the media or in public. fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.
Second, Ms. Maxwell. secks, language! restricting potential Government witnesses and their.
counsel from-using discovery:matcrials for any:purpose. other than-preparing for the criminal trial
‘in this‘action. The Government has proposed. contrary language on both of these issues., For the
following reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order.

Under Federal Rule of: Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), “[a]t any time the court may; for
good cause, deny,'restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other appropriate relicf.”
The good. cause standard. “requires courts to balanée several interests, including whether
the ‘protective order would prejudice the defendant,” and “the public’s, interest; in the
information.” United. States v.. Smith, 985 .F. Supp. 2d 506, 522 (S.D.N-Y. 2013). The party:
secking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing good.cause. Cf: Gambale vy. Deutsche

Bank AGs377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
