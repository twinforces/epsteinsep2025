1 materials, it has been in some instances due to precisely that
2 factor. So has there been a plan developed to ensure that down
3 the road we are not hearing that there were delays or problems
4 with discovery as a result of the fact that part of the

5 disclosure obligation here includes materials from other

6 investigative files?

7 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

8 The files in particular that I am referring to are the
9 files in the possession of the F.B.I. in Florida in connection
10 with the previous investigation of Jeffrey Epstein. The

11 physical files themselves were shipped to New York and are at
12 the New York F.B.I. office. They have been imaged and scanned
13 and photographed to make sure that a comprehensive review can
14 be conducted, and they are physically in New York so that we

15 can have access to those files. And again, as we have heard in
16 ongoing information, we are particularly thoughtful about those
17 concerns given the history of this case and the volume of

18 materials and the potential sensitivities, your Honor.

19 THE COURT: Beyond the paper files which you have just
20 indicated, the physical files, have you charted a path for
al determining whether there is any other additional information
22 that must be disclosed?
23 MS. MOE: Your Honor, just to clarify, is your
24 question with respect to the previous investigation or -- I
25 apologize, your Honor. I wasn't sure what you meant.
