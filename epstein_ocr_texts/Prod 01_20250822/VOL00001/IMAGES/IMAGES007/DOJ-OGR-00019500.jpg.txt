Maxwell with respect to using the criminal discovery material solely for the purpose of this
criminal case.

a, Victim/Witness Identities

Ms. Maxwell’s proposed protective order prohibits Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and
others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or
potential witness referenced in the discovery materials, but does not prohibit defense counsel
from publicly referencing individuals “who have spoken on the public record to the media or in
public fora, or in litigation—criminal or otherwise—trelating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine
Maxwell.” /d. § 6. This language, which is nearly identical in all material respects to the
language in the protective order approved in the government’s criminal prosecution of Mr.
Epstein, see United States v. Epstein, 19-CR-00490-RMB (S.D.N.Y. July 25, 2019), ensures
appropriate privacy protections for alleged victims and should be approved here.

In contrast to the more permissive language it agreed to with respect to Mr. Epstein, the
government has taken the position that Ms. Maxwell’s defense counsel should only be allowed to
disclose the identity of alleged victims or potential witnesses who have spoken by name on the
public record “in this case.” The government’s proposal, however, advances no compelling
privacy protections, and instead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who
have already voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities by, among other things, pursuing civil
suits in their own name against Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein; speaking by name in the public
record in Mr. Epstein’s criminal proceedings; participating in on-the-record media interviews; or
posting comments under their own names on social media. The government’s proposed
restriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect the privacy interests of these
individuals who have already chosen to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to
conduct further factual investigation, prepare witnesses for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s
behalf.
