Maxwell. with réspect to using the criminal. discovery ‘material. solely for the purpose of this:
criminal. case.

2. Victim/Witness Identities

Ms. Maxwell’s proposed protective order. prohibits’ Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, aiid
others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim. or
potential, witness referenced. in the discovery materials, but. does not prohibit defense counsel
from, publicly. referencing individuals “who have spoken on the. public ‘record to the media, or in,
public fora, .or ‘in. litigation=criminal or otherwise=relating to: Jeffrey Epstein. or Ghislaine
Maxwell.” Jd. 96. This language, which is nearly: identical. in all :material respects to the
language in ‘the: protective order approved in the government’s criminal. prosecution of Mr.
Epstein, see. United States: -v. _ Epstein, 19-CR-00490-RMB (S.D:N.Y. July 25, 2019), ensures
appropriate privacy: protections for alleged victims and should be approved. here.

In. contrast to the more permissive language it agréed to. with respect to Mr. Epstein, the
government has ‘taken: the Position: that. Ms. Maxwell’ S: defense counsel should ony be allowed to
public record * ‘in, this « case. "The government’ 'S proposal, however: ‘advances. no ) compelling
privacy protections, and vnctead prevents the defense from making reference to individuals who
have already: voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities. by, among other:things, pursuing civil
suits : in their own name against. Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein, Speaking by: name in the public
posting comments under their own names. on "social media, The government’ Ss ” proposed.
restriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect. the privacy’ interests of these
individuals.’who have already’ chosen ‘to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to
conduct further factual, investigation, prepare witnesses. for trial, and advocate on Ms. Maxwell’s
behalf.
