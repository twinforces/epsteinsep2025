C. The proposed bail package

Ghislaine Maxwell has proposed a significant, compelling, and
unprecedented bail package, which gives up or puts at risk everything
that she has — her British and French citizenship, all of her and her
spouse’s assets ($22.5 million),®5 her family’s livelihood, and the
financial security of her closest friends and family (totaling $5 million).
A security company, which will monitor and secure Ms. Maxwell at her
home, will also post an unprecedented $1 million bond. Ex.E, I.

Ms. Maxwell looks forward to confronting the accusers and
clearing her name. She has no intention of fleeing and will be unable to
do so if released on bond. This bail package demonstrates these facts in
a real way, unlike the government’s claims that the evidence against
her is strong. Even though a guarantee of appearance is not necessary,
the bail package in this case is as close to a guarantee as one can get.
There is no legally permissible basis to deny bail.

5 Her spouse would retain $400,000 for living and other expenses.
