Case Casec¥006464-JGKDGAt Docifienl820 AieeBbege.A72%eRagé 10 of 13
5. The Interests of the Court

As for the interest of the Court, it appears that staying discovery in the civil case could
conserve judicial resources. Where a criminal case can potentially streamline the related civil
case, this factor supports a stay. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n vy. Abraaj Inv. Mgmt. Ltd., No. 19cv3244
(AJN), 2019 WL 6498282, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, 2019). As observed by the Government, the
pending criminal case against Maxwell may resolve issues of fact common to the two actions,
and may therefore reduce the number of issues to be decided in subsequent proceedings in this
case. (See 9/4/20 Gov’t Ltr. at 2.)

Further, although it should not be the decisive factor, this Court also notes that it has
some interest in coordinating discovery, where appropriate, among the many civil cases that have
been brought in this District against the Epstein estate, and that none of those other cases are
currently going forward. This Court additionally notes that tighter restrictions on discovery may
be imposed in the context of a criminal prosecution than in a civil litigation, and that, if this civil
case were to move forward, restrictions that have already been placed on Maxwell’s access to
information in her criminal case could have a limiting effect on this Court’s ability to supervise
discovery here. (See 9/4/20 Gov’t Ltr., at 3-4 (noting that “Maxwell’s access to information
about the criminal matter is under the jurisdiction of the Honorable Alison J. Nathan, who has
entered a protective order and has issued several rulings regarding the scope of discovery that
Maxwell is entitled to and the manner in which she may or may not use that information’); see
also 8/27/20 Moskowitz Ltr., at 3 (noting that Maxwell had indicated, in her initial disclosures,
that, due to the terms of a protective order entered in the criminal case, she would be prohibited
from disclosing certain information in the civil case).)

Thus, at least to some extent, the Court’s interest weighs in favor of a stay.
