5. The Interests of the Court

As for the interest, of the Court, it appears that.staying discovery in the civil case could
conserve judicial resources. Where:a criminal case can potentially streamline the related. civil
case, this factor supports a stay. See. & Exch. Commen'v: Abraaj Inv. Mgmt, Lid.,.No. 19¢v3244
(AJN), 2019 WL 6498282, at.*3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3,201.9). .As observed by the Government, the
pending criminal ‘case against Maxwell, may: resolve issues of fact common to the two. actions,
and. may therefore reduce the number of issues to be decided:in subsequent proceedings in this
case. (See 9/4/20 Gov't Ltr., at 2.)

Further, although it, should not be the decisive factor, this Court also notes that it has
somic interest in coordinating discovery, where appropriate, among the many civil. casés that. have
been. brought in this District. against the Epstein. estate, and-that:none of those other cases arc
currently going forward. This Court additionally ‘notes that tighter restrictions on discovery may
be. imposed.:in the context ofa criminal prosecution than. in a civil litigation, and that, if this. civil
information in. her criminal,case could have a limiting cffect on this Court’s ability. to supervise
discovery here. (See.9/4/20,Gov’t Ltr, at 3-4 (noting that “Maxwell’s access:to information
about,the criminal matter is ‘under the jurisdiction of the Honorable Alison J.. Nathan, who has
enteréd a-protective order and.has issucd, séveéral rulings régarding the scope of discovery that
Maxwell is. entitled to and the manner in which she may or may not-use:that. information”); see:
also 8/27/20. Moskowitz.Ltr., at:3 (noting that Maxwell, had indicated, in. her initial disclosures,
that, due to the terms of a-protective order entered in the criminal. case, she would. be prohibited
from disclosing, certain.information, in the civil casc).)

Thus, at:lcast’to some’ extent; the Court’s, interest: weighs in-favor of a stay:
