affirm Ms. Maxwell’s earnestness in seeking bail to properly prepare her defense, not to flee.
The Court should grant bail to Ghislaine Maxwell.
CONCLUSION
The proposed additional conditions of release—renunciation of foreign citizenship and

restraint and monitoring of assets by a retired District Court judge—enhance the already
extraordinarily restrictive bail conditions proposed in Ms. Maxwell’s Renewed Motion for Bail.
In combination, these conditions satisfy the Bail Reform Act and reasonably assure Ms.
Maxwell’s appearance at trial. To deny Ms. Maxwell bail when such extraordinary and
restrictive conditions are available would be a miscarriage of justice.
