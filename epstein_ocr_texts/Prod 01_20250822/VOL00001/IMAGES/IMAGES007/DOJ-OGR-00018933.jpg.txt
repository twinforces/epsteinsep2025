1 way we offered similar messages through a previous witness.

2 THE COURT: So you have to take the objection when it
3 comes. I don't think there is a waiver theory as to future

4 objections.

S Are you seeking to offer the names and phone numbers

6 for their truth?

7 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. And here, this witness has
8 testified that they would receive these calls, memorialize it

9 at the same time the person was recording it. And here, we're
10 not offering this for the truth of the particular phone number,
11 but that a person identifying themselves that way had called

12 and left a message on that date. That is consistent with the
13 testimony of victims who described calling the house and the

14 name of a victim who testified yesterday is in these messages.
15 The names are also consistent with the names of other

16 individuals who witnesses have testified about contacting the
17 house and being involved in scheduling massage appointments.

18 So with respect to the business records issue, here,
19 this witness has testified —-
20 THE COURT: So the contention is that it's a business
2l record?
22 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. In addition, it's
23 memorializing the statement of the person calling at the time
24 they made it. So it's confirming that a person identifying
25 themself that way contacted the house at that time.
