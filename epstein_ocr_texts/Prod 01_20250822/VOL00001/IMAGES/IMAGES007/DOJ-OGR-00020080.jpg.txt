to other countries outside of the European Union, including the United States. As set forth in
Exhibit B, according to the MOJ, the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the
extradition of a person who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for
which extradition is requested.” (Ex. B at 3). That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries
is of no moment. (See id.). In applying the Bilateral Extradition Treaty between the United States
and France and the “general principle of non-extradition of nationals under French law, France
systematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American judicial
authorities.” (/d. at 4). Thus, contrary to the suggestion of the defense submission, any
anticipatory waiver of extradition would not be effective under French law, and would not be
recognizable by French courts in any extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.

The defendant’s expert writes that “[i]n the recent past,” he is “not aware that the French
authorities would have had to address the situation in which the United States sought extradition
of a French citizen who was also a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from
in that regard.” (Def. Ex. V. at 2). That is not so. France has previously rejected such a request.
For example, in 2006, Hans Peterson, an American citizen and French national, turned himself in
to French authorities in Guadeloupe and confessed to committing a murder in the United States.
Despite turning himself in to French authorities, Peterson remained beyond the reach of U.S. law
enforcement despite the repeated requests of OJA and USS. officials. See Durbin, Schakowsky,
