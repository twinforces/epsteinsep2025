Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page14 of 15
with the benefit of knowing what everyone else knows will become moot once the
deposition material is unsealed (as this Court already recognized by staying the
unsealing order pending appeal).

Finally, it is appropriate for this Court to issue a writ of mandamus because,
as explained in Ms. Maxwell’s motion to consolidate, the judges in the Southern
District of New York have reached inconsistent decisions to prejudice of Ms.

that all the judges below are on the same page.

Conclusion

For these reasons, as well as those given in the opening brief, Doc. 60, pp 10-
22, this Court should deny the government’s motion to dismiss the appeal.
