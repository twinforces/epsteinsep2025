Case 20-3061, Document 69, 09/28/2020, 2940206, Paged of 15
Ms. Maxwell asks is for permission to share, under seal, the relevant facts with
another Article ITI judge.

The government argues there is no jurisdiction for this Court to consider this
appeal. Doc. 37. Quoting Midland Asphalt Corp. »v. United States, the government
says the collateral order doctrine must be interpreted “with the utmost strictness in
criminal cases.” 489 U.S. 794, 799 (1989) (quoting Flanagan v. United States, 465
U.S. 259, 265 (1984)). Doc. 37 at 8. According to the government, in criminal cases
the doctrine applies only to orders denying a bond, orders denying a motion to
dismiss on double jeopardy ground, orders denying a motion to dismiss under the
Speech and Debate Clause, and orders permitting the forced administration of
antipsychotic drugs to render a defendant competent for trial. Doc. 37 at 9. The
government is wrong.

To be sure, this appeal does not concern one of the four types of orders
identified by the government. But that doesn’t mean the appeal isn’t proper under
the collateral order doctrine, particularly when there is no serious argument that it
satisfies each of the doctrine’s three requirements: Judge Nathan’s order
(1) conclusively determined the disputed question, (2) it resolved an important
issue completely separate from the merits of the action, and (3) it is effectively
unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. See Will, 546 U.S. at 349.
