LC6Cmax5 McHugh —- cross

1 Q. And it says for the account of Ghislaine Maxwell; right?

2 A. Yes.

3 Q. But you testified that there are ways to -- I believe there
4 are ways to set up accounts on other people's behalf if you

5 have the proper authority to do that; isn't that right?

6 MS. MOE: I'd object, your Honor. I think that

7 mischaracterizes the testimony.

8 THE COURT: Sustained.

9 Q. Are there ways to set up an account for someone on their

10 behalf as long as you have proper authorization to do that?

11 A. I would —- I don't know. I would refer that to the —- our
12 legal group and the power of attorney and the instructions that
13 were involved in that.

14 Q. Understood. But safe to say, we don't know from this

15 document here what this transaction was for; right?

16 MS. MOE: Objection. Asked and answered.

17 THE COURT: Sustained.

18 Q. Let's move on to the transaction you saw in September of

20 about that document, as well, right, we saw that before?
21 A. One moment. I just want to doublecheck. Yes.
22 Q. Okay. So if we look at that document, that is a statement
23 dated September of 2002; right?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. And it's for an account held by Jeffrey Epstein?
