LC6Cmax5 McHugh â€”- cross

1 A. Yes.

2 Q. And if you look at page 6 of this document, and you look at
3 the transactions on October 19th of 1999, which I think we

4 looked at in your testimony in direct; is that right?

5 A. Yes.

6 Q. That shows a sale of roughly $18.3 million and another

7 transfer of the same amount on the same day; right?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. So here's another example, is it not an account with many,
10 many millions of dollars in an account that's controlled by

11 Jeffrey Epstein; right?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. So I think it's fair to say he had a lot of money?

14 MS. MOE: Objection, your Honor.

15 THE COURT: Sustained.

16 Q. Now, from your experience working with high net worth

17 individuals, it's usually the case, isn't it, that people who
18 have this much money don't have it all in one bank account;

19 isn't that right?
20 MS. MOE: Objection, your Honor.
21 THE COURT: Overruled.
22 A. I don't know. It depends.
23 Q. Well, some may, some may not, I suppose; right?
24 MS. MOE: Objection to form.
25 THE COURT: Overruled.
