1 but also of authentication under Rule 901, a proposition for

2 which the defense cites a Ninth Circuit case from 1977, United
3 States v. Sterns, 550 F.2d 1167, which is Ninth Circuit 1977.

4 I disagree. Rule 901 requires that the proponent must
5 produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that the item
6 is what the proponent claims it is. Here, the government

7 claims that the photographs are of Epstein's apartment in 2019,
8 a claim that I understand will be provided via testimony and

9 that the defense does not dispute. Whether those photos taken
10 in 2019 are probative of how the apartment appeared in 1994 is
11 a question of relevance under Rule 401 to be balanced with 403,
12 not of authentication. See United States v. Certified

13 Environmental Services Inc., 753 F.3d 72 at 90, which is a

14 Second Circuit decision from 2014 I'll quote here. Quote, with
15 respect to temporal relevance, we have held that a suggestion
16 that an item of evidence relates to a period that is too remote
17 goes to both the item's relevance and its weight. That case

18 quotes itself from another Second Circuit case, Fitzgerald v.
19 Henderson, 251 F.3d 345 at 365, Second Circuit 2001. Though,
20 to be clear, the government, as I said, will still need to
21 authenticate that the photos are of Epstein's apartment in
22 2019.
23 In any event, even if analyzed under Rule 91, as I'll
24 discuss below in a moment, Jane's testimony about the
25 distinctive characteristics of Epstein's apartment captured in
