Re: United States‘v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr..330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition. to the: defendant’s. letter of
August. 17, 2020 (the “Defense Letter”), requesting that the Court enter an order permitting the
defendant:to file:under seal.in, certain,civil cases (the “Civil, Cases”) discovery materials. produced.
by the Government in the instant criminal case, and to. refer to, but, not file, additional other
discovery materials’ produced by ‘the. Goverhinient iin. the Civil. Gases. Those applications should.
be:denied.' :

As an initial matter, the Government has already produced, and, will continue ‘to produce,
substantial, volumes of materials in discovery consistent, with its obligations. Those include
materials.the Government obtained via.scarch. warrant, grand jury subpocnas, or othcr investigative
methods available only to > the Government. Indeed, ‘the Government has already produced more
Letter. Through: her most recent ‘application, the defendant secks: permission, tor use, In, n-unrelated.
civil litigation, matcrials produced pursuant. to the protective order ‘in this case and. designated
“Confidential” thereunder. As, detailed licrein, the Government’s. designation is entirely’
appropriate given-that the materials—court orders and applications—have. ‘been kept under scal by:
the issuing judges, and. pertain:to an ongoing’ criminal, investigation.

"The Government has drafted. this letter in.a manner that avoids revealing the contents of scaled
materials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the:Government does ‘not seck: permission to
seal or:redact this submission. Because the Defense Letter répeatedly references, and attaches as
exhibits, materials that are scaled:and:that would jeopardize an-ongoing grand jury: investigation if
filed publicly, the:Government intends to submit a scparate Ictter, under seal, proposing: x redactions
to the Defense'Letter and:requesting thatthe attachments fo the Defense Letter be filed under scal.
