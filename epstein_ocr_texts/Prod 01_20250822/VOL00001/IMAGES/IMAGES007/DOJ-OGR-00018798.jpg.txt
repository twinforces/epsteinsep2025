LC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross

1 against third parties. I think that's borne out by the

2 substance of the document. Count One only talks about Jeffrey
3 Epstein, the first defendant. Count Two only talks about Sarah
4 Kellen, the second defendant. I think that that makes sense

5 and it wouldn't be expected that Ghislaine Maxwell or anyone

6 else would be included in allegations in a complaint against

7 those two.

8 More broadly, I think defense counsel has already

9 gotten the point that he wants to make across to the jury. He
10 has made very, very clear, repeatedly, that this witness sued
11 Jeffrey Epstein and Sarah Kellen and not Ghislaine Maxwell.

12 They have now heard that she has filed multiple court documents
13 that are lengthy in which the defendant's name is not

14 mentioned. So he has everything he needs to make his

15 impeachment point. At this point, it's cumulative and risks

16 403 prejudice and confusion of the issues, and a sideshow about
17 a 2009 lawsuit to put in the document itself. He has

18 everything he needs.

19 THE COURT: I think that he has everything he needs
20 goes to the relevance of the contention that the exclusion is
2l there.
22 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think that the point is that
23 she wasn't included as a defendant. I don't think that it
24 would be expected, especially in a document --
25 THE COURT: I think it's a redirect point, frankly,
