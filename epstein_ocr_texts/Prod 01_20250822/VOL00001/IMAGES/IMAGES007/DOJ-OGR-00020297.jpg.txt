erroneously adopted its conclusory proffer.

5. Ms. Maxwell’s intention to evade the media does not even
marginally amount to risk of flight. Resp.{33. The Government does not
dispute that the media placed a bounty on Ms. Maxwell or that she was
being stalked by them before her arrest. Of course she took measures to
protect herself and her family, just as government lawyers and judges do
when their safety is at issue. Ms. Maxwell was at her home in the United
States. The Government admits that it knew where she was. It had such
confidence that it could arrest her whenever it chose that it orchestrated
her arrest to coincide with a press conference replete with incendiary
demonstrative aids. And it is worth repeating that the Government does
not claim that Ms. Maxwell — a 59-year old woman with no prior criminal
history — is a danger to the community. She is no monster, but she is
being treated like one because of the “Epstein effect.”

6. The Government’s contention that Ms. Maxwell receives more
time than other inmates at MDC to “review her discovery” and
“communicate with her attorneys” does not prove anything about whether
she is actually able to effectively prepare her defense. Ms. Maxwell needs
more time with her lawyers and discovery than almost any other MDC
