Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page28 of 31

J.). The Constitution’s “prohibitions on the deprivation of liberty
without due process and of excessive bail require careful review of
pretrial detention orders to ensure that the statutory mandate [of the
Bail Reform Act] has been respected.” United States v. Motamedi, 767
F.2d 14038, 1405 (9th Cir. 1985) (Kennedy, J.). Because the consequence
of error — the unjust deprivation of liberty from an individual who is
presumed innocent — is contrary to our Constitution, “doubts regarding
the propriety of release should be resolved in favor of the defendant.” Id.

Even where the government is able to prove that an accused is an
actual flight risk, pretrial detention generally remains inappropriate.
United States v. Berrios-Berrios, 791 F.2d 246, 251 (2d Cir. 1986) (“the
presumption in favor of bail sti// applies where the defendant is found to
be a risk of flight”) (emphasis added). Where the only question is
whether the defendant is a risk of flight, “the law still favors pre-trial
release subject to the least restrictive further condition, or combination
of conditions, that the court determines will reasonably assure the
appearance of the person as required.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75.
