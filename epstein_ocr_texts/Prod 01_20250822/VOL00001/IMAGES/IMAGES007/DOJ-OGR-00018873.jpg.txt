11 In terms of admissibility under the business record

12 exception, Ms. Gill, the witness, is a records custodian for

13 Mar-a-Lago. So she will say that personal action notices are
14 created in the ordinary course of business by managers at

15 Mar-a-Lago at the time an employee is hired and that once an

16 employee is eligible for benefits at Mar-a-Lago, those

24 say that she has looked at these records in Mar-a-Lago's
25 personnel file and confirms that they are true and accurate
