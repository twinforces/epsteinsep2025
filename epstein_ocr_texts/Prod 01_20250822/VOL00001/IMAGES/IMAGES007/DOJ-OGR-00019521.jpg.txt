‘of such. materials provided. by the defendant to the Government. ‘But there is no basis to add
additional restrictions upon the Government's use of materials gathered by the Government itself.

The defendant’s only counter-argunient, as noted—that'this Court should put third parties
“on equal footing with the defense”—is both. unlikely;to be relevant given the Government’s
standard practice, as described.above, and, the:Government submits, an irrclevant consideration in,
the context. of a. criminal. protective order. Indeed, the Government. respectfully’ submits that
neither it nor this Court-is ‘well-positioned to, or:should, become the arbiter of what.is appropriate
or permissible in. civil cases.

In,sum, the defendant’s attempt to. restrict the Government and to restrict third ‘partics:.in,
this way appears to be unprecedented, and.is without legal’basis, and, should be denied.

Accordingly, ‘for the reasons set. forth above, the: Court. should. enter the Governmient’s,
proposed protective order, which-is enclosed, and deny:the: defendant*s motion.

Respectfully submitted,
