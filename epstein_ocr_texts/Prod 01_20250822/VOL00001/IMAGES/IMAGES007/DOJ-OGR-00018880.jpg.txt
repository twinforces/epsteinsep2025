1 insurance or accepting the offer of insurance in and of itself
2 may be a perk of the business, but putting on the form who you
3 wish to be insured as your family is hearsay.

4 THE COURT: Agreed.

5) MS. STERNHEIM: So the form itself is one thing, the

6 content is something else.

7 THE COURT: I agree.

8 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.

9 THE COURT: I think the only potential for -- and

10 you'll look at the Lieberman case, too, is if there is

11 testimony that the employer did something to verify the

12 information on the form.

13 So, for examole, if the form says this is my address
14 and the testimony is that when an employee fills out this form,
15 we look at their driver's license to verify that the address is
16 the same, then, as a business, I think, under Lieberman, that
17 comes in. It would have to be something comparable for

18 verification of children -- I think it's children and spouse?
19 MS. STERNHEIM: Correct.
20 THE COURT: In order for this to fit for the content
2l of the form. It's content versus the form itself. It's
22 precisely the line that the circuit draws in Lieberman.
23 MS. STERNHEIM: But in addition, Judge, this witness
24 does not have any personal knowledge as to what the procedures
25 were seven years prior to her becoming employed.
