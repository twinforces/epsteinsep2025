insurance or accépting the offer of ‘insurance in and of ‘itself
may be a perk of the business, but putting ‘on the form who you.
wish to be insured as, your family is hearsay.

THE COURT: -Agreed..

MS. STERNHEIM: So the form itsélf 1S oné thing, ‘the
centent is something else.

THE COURT: I agrée-

MS, STERNHEIM: Thank. you.
THE COURT: I think the only potential for -- and
you'll tlogk at. the Lieberman case, too, is if there is
testimony that thé employer did sdémething to verify the
information on, the form.

So, for example, if the form says this is my address
and, the testimony is that. when, an employee faidls out this form,

we look at their driver's licénse to verify that the addréss is

the same, ‘then, as a business, I think, under Lieberman, that

comes ins It. would have to be something comparable for
verification of children -- I, think it's children and spouse?

MS. STERNHEIM: Gorreéct-«

THE COURT: In order for ‘this to fit for the content.
of the form. It's content versus the form itself. It's
precisely the line that the cincuat draws in LLeberman..

MS. STERNHEIM: But in addition, Judge, this witness

does not have, any personal knowledge as to what the procedures

were seven. yearns prior to her becoming employed.
