closing.

MS, MOE: Your Honor, we! often call summary witnesses
who aré not involved in the ‘investigation who dre jitist talking
about their analysis of records, The purpose here isn't to
have the Sumtiary witness talk ‘through ‘the investigdtion or
investigative steps, but to talk about a review of exhibits,

And, I) Have called agents to do just that.

THE COURT: But for the purposes. of doing what L006

permits, that's not what this is. I've séen it tinh two

contexts: One, 1006 you've got a complicated, extensive set of
records tHat are being summarized via a witness. And thén
you've got ,investagatave summany witnesses who talk through
factually what they did in a sense. And you're nét doing
either of ‘those; you're providing essentially a closing
argument 6f mini Closing argument. via a witness who has no
personal involvement, in the investigation and doing so, sounds

like, with materials that don't require the type of 1006

summary.

So y6u've created, I think, a little bit of a hybrid
ef certainly what. I've seen those two exemplars, for them to be
used. And so it just. does sound like argument, summation, and
the kind of thing that -- I mean, it's certainly true you could
have dohe it with the witnesses. At sone point I might have
said, Save it, for summation, counsel. But I can't say I've
ever seen a version like this.
