THE COURT: I just started, with the propositaon is Lt
your theory that everything in an article disclosed suddénly is
within, the scope of the dimect, and, you said no, rightly. So
that's why I asked for the quéstidn.

The question ‘you asked is beyond ‘the scope of the
direct, unless you want to point me to testimony suggesting
otherwise, other than the fact that it's in an, article
disclosed.

If I. would make everybody answer my first question,

it's the first question that gets me where I need to go.
