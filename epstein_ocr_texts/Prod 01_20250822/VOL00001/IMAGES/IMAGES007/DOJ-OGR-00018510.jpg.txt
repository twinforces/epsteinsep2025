LC6Cmax5 McHugh â€”- cross

1 Q. Sure. Why don't we go to Government Exhibit 502. I'm

2 sorry. Actually, let's go to 501. You've got 501 in front of
3 you, Mr. McHugh?

4 A. Yes.

5 Q. And you see that that's a statement from June of 2007 for a
6 company called Air Ghislaine Inc.; right?

7 A. Yes.

8 Q. And if we go to page 2 of that document, these are the

9 transactions you spoke about in your direct testimony on June
10 18th; right? There are two line items on that date; correct?
11 A. Yes.

12 Q. And the second line item was highlighted for you and it

13 appears to show the purchase of a green helicopter from

14 Sikorsky; right?

15 A. It's what the transaction description reads.

16 Q. Okay. So now, again, I'm just going to ask you a bit about
17 this practice.

18 Now, is it your experience, having been in banking for
19 30 years, that people buy assets like planes, larger assets and
20 have them owned by companies?
21 MS. MOE: Objection.
22 THE COURT: Sustained.
23 Q. Do you know anything about the practice of having larger
24 assets owned by companies or corporate entities?
25 MS. MOE: Objection.
