Re: United: States v, Ghislaine. Maxwell
20.Cr. 330. (AJN)

‘Dear Judge Nathan:

The government's recent Ietter-regarding MDC. conditions (Dkt.158) essentially repeats
the sanie points it made in:defense of the MDC’s request that the Court vacate its order directing
the MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell:to use a laptop'on weekends and holidays. We appreciate the
‘Court’s concern regarding Ms. Maxwell’s opportunity‘to review discovery and the extent to
which she is required to undergo scarches.. The government’s Ictter, however, does not include
the concerns defense counsel. has:reported to’ MDC Legal, during the past; couple of months. In
addition, the letter incorrectly states ‘that Icgal calls are available on Saturdays. Such requests by
‘counsel have been. denied.

misrepresents Ms. Maxwell’ S. conditions of confinement. “Ms. Maxwell does: not. have a access to
daily’ discovery. review: for the entirety of the 13 hours. The vagaries and delays of moving'her
the 50 ‘fect.or so ‘from. the isolation cell to the day room. are a large part'of the challenge.

The number of’ searches is also: not-correct. Ms., Maxwell is scarched on every move,
‘including to the empty. conercte space, adjacent.to the day room, used for reercation., Currently,
she is subject to a minimum of four:pat.down searches a day if: she g gocs to rec} and five pat-down
searches on the day of her weekly’ body scan. Sinée July 6", Ms. Maxwell has been physically
searched. approximately; 1400 times, including pat down scarches, metal. wand searches, mouth,
hair and ear:scarches (posing. additional health risks ‘during COVID), and: upwards of 60. body
scans. In addition, there have been hundreds of physical searches of her isolation ccll, locker,
‘legal papers, and personal. effects. No contraband has ever been found.

We take issuc ‘with MDC’s assessment that “the searches are all necessary for the safety’
of the institution and the defendant.” Ms. Maxwell is under.24-hour surveillance! by two to six.
guards and approximatcly 18 cameras, not including the hand-held camera, focused on, her
‘throughout the arcas in which she is moved and confined. Ms. Maxwell. poses no’ danger'to
anyone. Her'restrictive conditions, searches, and constant-surveillanee correlate directly to BOP
negligence resulting in the death of Jeffrey Epstein.
