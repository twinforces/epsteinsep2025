Icast $2 million. In addition, the defendant proposes that she retain an additional halfa million
dollars: in liquid asscts in an unrestrained account, as well ‘as any future income. * ‘That figure:
appears | to bei in addition to the. approximatcly $1 million i an. “chattels” the defendant has. disclosed.

her with ample. resources to 5 fund her: flight: from prosccution.

Further still, the. deferdant’s, Motion provides only cursory details of the monitorship
program she:proposes, and. it.offers no legal. precedent:to explain what, if any, authority ‘this. Court,
has to establish and.oversce such, a. monitorship. Aside ‘from defense counscl’s assertions, the
Motion offers nothing that would cnable the Court to meaningfully consider'the details of, such a.
monitorship. Among other things, it is unclear from. the defendant’s Motton. ‘whether such ‘a,
program would require the defendant’s voluntary Compliance’with the monitorship, or whether the
funds. would. be placed ‘ina bank account ‘that the: defendant. could not access. Given that the
defendant’s Motion: ‘suggests that attorney’s fees could: be disbursed without approval, it appears
that the defendant’s proposal would provide her latitude to engage’in. financial-transactions, subject.
only toa review that would require her voluntary compliance.

Finally,, although the defendant does not provide any: detail about the amount of moncy she
would. pay the: monitor, presumably the monitor would not undertake this responsibility for free.
Asa result, the tension between the ‘monitor’s obligation to review the defendants finances. and.
the monitor’s employment relationship with ‘the defendant. creates a:conflict of interest. But'at
bottom, if the Court determines ‘that the only way to keep ‘the defendant from using her asscts. to
flee is to take away control of her asscts, then. she is too, gréat a flight risk to release.

In sum, in light of this Court’s determination that the defendant:“has not’bcen fully:candid.
about her ‘financial situation,” ‘the Court should reject the defendant’s, vague'proposal. (Dec. Op.
at 2). Nothing in the defendant’s, Motion, should alter the Court’s determination that-the defendant.
poses. a significant risk of flight, and that she has the resoureés and skills to flee prosecution. The
‘Court should reject the proposed bail conditions.

3. The Defendant’s Pending Pretrial Motions Have Not Diminished the Strength
of the Government’s Case

Finally,, the. defendant also argucs: that. the “numerous substantive pretrial motions now:
before: the Court amply challenge the purported. strength. of the g government’s case. ” (Mot. at 7).
But the defendant cannot merely point to the sheer volume of bricfing:she has filed to:suggest that.
the'strength ofthe Government’s case, has.diminished. To the contrary, as:the Government-has set:
forth in detail in its memorandum in opposition, the defendant’s pretrial motions. are. entirely’
without merit. In any.cvent, it is premature. for the defendant to. claim that her pretrial, motions—
which ‘have not been. adjudicated, much. less granted—have altered. the Court’s original

The: defendant's proposal. also Icaves. unrestrained several. million. dollars :in escrow ‘for the
defendant’s legal fees. See'Dkt. 97, Ex. O at.9 (listing, approximately $7.6 million in retainer-fees);
see. also ‘Mot. at 6. If the defendant.fled.the country, her counsel would presumably be required to
return those funds to the defendant, who ‘would. no longer need. defense counsel. in this case.
