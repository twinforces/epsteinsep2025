Defendant. OPINION AND.ORDER.

ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

On August 17, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a scaled Ictter motion seeking
an Order modifying the-protective order in this casc.! Specifically, she sought:a Court order:
allowing her to file under seal, in certain. civil cases (“Civil Cases”) materials (“Documents”) that

documents n.question.a are “judicial.documents: (ii) a assess the: weight of:the Common ‘law: presumption ofiaccess to
the materials; and (iii) ‘balance competing considerations against: the presumption ofaccess. Jd at 19-20. “Such
countervailing: factors include but are not!limited:to ‘the danger of:i impairing law enforcement orjudicial. efficiency’
and “the: privacy’ ‘interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Jd. at 120 (quoting United States v.. Amodeo,, 71. F.3d 1.044,
LO48 (2¢.Cir. 1995). (“Amodeo If’)). The:Government’s’ ‘proposed redactions satisfy’ thistest. First, the Court finds
thatithe defendant’ $ letter:motion is “relevant to the per formance: of the judicial function-and useful in:the judicial
process,” thereby qualifying: as a “judicial document” for purposes ‘of the first Clement of the Ligosch test. Wniited
Siates v..Amiodeo “Amodeo..), 44-F. 3d. 141, 145. (2d Cir. 1995). Second, the Court assumes that the commion.law
presumption of-access attaches, thereby. satisfying’ the second clement. Butiin balancing ‘competing, considerations
againstithe presumption.of access, the! Court finds that:the arguments the Government has put-forth including,
most*notably, the’ threat’ that public disclosure!of the redacted sections would interfere w ith an ongoing: grand jury’
investigation: favor'the Government’s proposed natrowly tailored redactions.

In light of-this ruling, the partics arc her¢by- ORDERED to:meet and confer with respect to:proposed redactions to
the Defendant’s:reply: letter, dated. August 24, 2020 and.the Defendant’s.August 24, 2020 letter addressing her
proposed redactions tothe Defendant’s August. 17, 2020 letter motion. The parties are further. ORDERED to submit
their proposed.redactions no later'than. September 4, 2020; if the parties cannot agree:on their proposed. redactions,
