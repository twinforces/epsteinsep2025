07/09/2020 16 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As discussed in its previous order, the Court will
hold an arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter remotely as a
video/teleconference on July 14, 2020 at 1 pm. Members of the press and the public in
the United States may access the live audio feed of the proceeding by calling
855-268-7844 and using access code 32091812# and PIN 9921299#. Those outside of
the United States may access the live audio feed by calling 214—416—0400 and using
the same access code and PIN. These phone lines can accommodate approximately
500 callers on a first come, first serve basis. The Court will provide counsel for both
sides an additional dial-in number to be used to ensure audio access to the proceeding
for non-speaking co—counsel, alleged victims, and any family members of the
Defendant. The United States Attorney's Office should email Chambers with
information regarding any alleged victims who are entitled, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.
§3771(a)(4), to be heard at the bail hearing and who wish to be heard. The Court will
then provide information as to the logistics for their dial-in access. As the Court
described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID—-19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in—house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID-—19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in-person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/9/2020)({jbo) (Entered:
