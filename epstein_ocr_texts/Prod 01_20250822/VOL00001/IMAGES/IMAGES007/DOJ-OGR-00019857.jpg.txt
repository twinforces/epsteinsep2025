Case 21-58; Document 39-1 , 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page29 of 31

The Supreme Court has explained that when “the Government
has admitted that its only interest is in preventing flight, bail must be
set. by a court at a sum designed to erisure that. goal, and no more.”

The government simply has. not come. close to satisfying its heavy
burden of proving that “no conditions” exist that will reasonably assure
Ms. Maxwell’s presence. It has not articulated with any evidence, let
alone specific and credible evidence, how Ms. Maxwell could, manage ‘to
flee under the proposed bail conditions. Speculation. is not permitted.
United States vu. Bodmer, No. 03-er-947(SAS), 2004 WL 169790
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 28, 2004) (where government’s argument that no
conditions could assure defendant’s future presence was based, “in large
part, on speculation,” defendant was released to home confinement with
GPS. monitoring). We challenge the government to point to a high
profile defendant who in the recent past has 1) fled and 2) gotten away’
with it.

The reality is that defendants with far greater likelihood of
conviction than Ms. Maxwell are granted bond.and appear in. court. Ms.

Maxwell should not be treated differently.
