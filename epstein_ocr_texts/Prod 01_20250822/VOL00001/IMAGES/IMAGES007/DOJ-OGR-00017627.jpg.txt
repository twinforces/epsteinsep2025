1 Similar to the government and similar to what Mr. Everdell did
2 yesterday, 18 binders that have potentially admissible sealed
3 exhibits in them we would like to place under the jurors'

4 chairs, consistent with the practice on prior witnesses, to

5 only have them directed to a particular tab when and if the

6 Court admits a particular document that has identifying

7 information contained in it, if that's okay with your Honor.

8 THE COURT: Ms. Moe, is that fine with you?

9 MS. MOE: Your Honor, may I have just one moment?

10 (Counsel conferred)

11 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you.

12 THE COURT: Fine. Okay. So you can place the

13 binders. Anything else we can take up now, Ms. Menninger?

14 MS. MENNINGER: No, your Honor. I'm just going to

15 approach the witness stand at some point and re-place the

16 binder on the witness stand.

17 THE COURT: You may do that.

18 Ms. Moe, anything we can take up now?

19 MS. MOE: No, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: All right. I will step down.
21 I appreciate counsel conferring on the anonymity
22 issues and working through as much as you could. I greatly
23 appreciate that. I will see you in a few minutes.
24 (Recess)
25 THE COURT: All right. We have our jury.
