LC8VMAX6 Rodgers â€”- cross

1 So there was a bit of an overlap between the Hawker

2 and the Gulfstream?

3 A. Yes. But we didn't start flying the Gulfstream until

4 August of that year, because we had it in for paint and

5 interior, so there was a lot of work to do to the aircraft.

6 Q. Understood.

7 And you mentioned that he also at some point later

8 bought a Boeing 727, right?

9 A. Yes.

10 Q. That's a big aircraft, right?

11 A. That's a big aircraft.

12 Q. That's like a jetliner, right?

13 A. It is.

14 Q. And he bought that sometime around 2001; is that right?

15 A. Yes, in January of 2001.

16 Q. Okay. And I think you mentioned there were some other

17 planes you flew as well. There was a smaller Cessna, for

18 example?

19 A. There was a smaller Cessna that we had.
20 Q. Okay. And was that mainly for flights to the ranch?
21 A. We used it at the ranch, yes, a little bit, yes.
22 Q. There was a landing --
23 A. It wasn't the only mission, but it was in Palm Beach,
24 Florida a lot also. It sort of varied between Palm Beach and
25 the ranch, and I think one time it may have gone to St. Thomas.
