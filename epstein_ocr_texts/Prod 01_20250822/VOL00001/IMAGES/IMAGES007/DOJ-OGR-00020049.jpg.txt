Mr. Julie opines that the French entity with jurisdiction over the legality of extradition
requests would not oppose Ms. Maxwell’s extradition on the ground that she is a French citizen,
and that it is “highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an
extradition decree” against her. (/d. at 2). Mr. Julié bases his opinion largely on (i) Ms.
Maxwell’s U.S. citizenship; (11) her irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to
the United States; (iii) the fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell had fled to France
in violation of strict bail conditions in the United States: (iv) the fact that a failure to extradite
would obligate French authorities to try Ms. Maxwell in French courts for the same 25-year-old
conduct alleged in the indictment, which did not take place in France; and (v) France’s
diplomatic interest in accommodating an extradition request from the United States. (/d.). Mr.
Julie adds that the extradition process would likely be “disposed of expediently”; where the
requesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extradition request, “the extradition decree is
generally issued in only a few weeks.” (/d. at 2-3). And in any event, while the extradition
proceedings are pending, “the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that |Ms.
Maxwell] has to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail
terms and conditions in this requesting State.” (/d. at 12).

Ms. Maxwell has no intention of fleeing the country and has relinquished her nights to
contest extradition. She has always maintained her innocence and will continue to fight the
allegations against her here in the United States, as she has in the past. Even if she were to flee
after being granted bail (which she will not), it is likely that Ms. Maxwell would be extradited
expeditiously from France or the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give no
weight in the bail analysis to the fact that Ms. Maxwell is a dual citizen of these countries. ®
* Ms. Maxwell would also have very little incentive to flee to France. According to recent press reports, French
authorities recently broadened their existing criminal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein to include Ms. Maxwell. See
