2 MR. PAGLIUCA: This is apparently being offered as

3 purported prior consistent statement?

4 THE COURT: Right.

5 MR. PAGLIUCA: The problem is, when read in context,

6 which really starts at line 20 on the page above and goes

7 through probably line 16 on the next page, we're simply just

8 parsing out two lines.

9 THE COURT: She can read the whole thing.

10 MS. COMEY: That's fine, your Honor.

11 THE COURT: Okay?

12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Okay.

13 MS. COMEY: Starting at which line?

14 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'd say 136, line 23.

15 MS. COMEY: That's an answer.

16 MR. PAGLIUCA: So the question is going to be line 20.
17 MS. COMEY: Line 20 through line 6.

18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.
