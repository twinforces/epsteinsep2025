LE. 7VMAX1

government being too cute Heré and saying we're not going to do
it ‘on direct, but you know full well you're going to do it on
redirect.

MR, ROHRBACH: Understood, your Honor.

If TI could, confer with MS. Pomerantz, she's putting it
on; but L suspect it really 1s unlikely to come out on redirect
at all.

THE COURT: Okay.

(Counsel conferred)

MR, ROHRBACH: Your Honor, the government is. not
planning to talk with Mr. Flatley oh direct about CDSs. So it's

hard to imagine what, exactly would happen on cross that would

make this ah issue; but, Of cdéurse, the government doesn't want
to. lamit. itself by promising under no circumstances will it
élicit this information.

THE COURT: Okay.

So if you're not. Going té ask about GDs 6n direct, if
he's net. crossed on CDs, that's the end of the matter.

MR. ROHRBACH: Yes; your Hon6ér.

THE CQURT: Ms. Menninger, does that get us where we
need?

MS. MENNINGER: That's fine, ‘your Honor. Thank you.

THE COURT: Okay: Great. THank you both:

All right. Well, it, sounds like all that work we did
on, Flatley last night will just go in the can for future use.
