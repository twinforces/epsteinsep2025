Further, and as this Court knows, ample Second Circuit authority supports staying a civil case

Court has the authority to authorize use of the Material under the terms of this Court’s Protective
Order. And, the government has previously agreed that the appropriate forum to consider issues
related to the civil Protective Order is in the civil litigation, positing the opinion “that neither it
nor this Court is well-positioned to, or should, become the arbiter of what is appropriate or
