Pn, after the parties had briefed the
motion to unseal the deposition material and after Judge Preska ordered the
deposition material unsealed, Ms. Maxwell asked Judge Preska to briefly stay the
unsealing process. EXHIBIT D, p 1. But because of the criminal protective order, all
Ms. Maxwell could reveal to Judge Preska was that she was aware of critical new
information. EX. D, p 1. She couldnâ€™t tell Judge Preska what that information was.
Ex. D, pp 1-2.

Judge Preska declined to stay the unsealing process but said he would
reevaluate if Judge Nathan modified the criminal protective order and allowed Ms.
Maxwell to share with Judge Preska, under seal, all she learned as described above.
EXHIBIT E, pp 1-2.
