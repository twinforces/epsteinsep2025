LC2VMAX2 Rocchio â€” Direct

1 there we are.

2 Anything further?

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Not from me, your Honor.

4 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, nothing further.

a I just wanted to note that in the transcript for your
6 Honor. Our understanding is that the question that had been

7 posed to Dr. Rocchio was about the presence of third parties,

8 and just wanted to make that clear for your Honor when she had
9 said no, that was our understanding as to what she was saying
10 no about, in terms of the support in the literature, your

11 Honor.

12 But I take your Honor's point. We can move on, your
13 Honor. I just wanted to explain that to the Court, where the
14 question was coming from, your Honor.

15 THE COURT: The question you asked that was objected
16 to here was, Based on your experience, research, and training,
17 is the person doing the grooming always the recipient of the

18 sexual gratification?

19 For the reasons I've indicated, that is precluded by
20 the narrow basis on which I did preclude what they call
al grooming by proxy. Again, I see there's a slight analytical
22 distinction between the question you asked and that theory, but
23 the question, I think -- and I see that she says no, that
24 wasn't how she understood it. But still for me, that testimony
25 was in aid of the next piece, which I excluded.
