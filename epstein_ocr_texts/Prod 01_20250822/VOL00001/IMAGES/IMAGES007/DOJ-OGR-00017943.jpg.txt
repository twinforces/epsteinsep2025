LC2VMAX2 Rocchio — Direct, |
there we are.

Anything further?

MR. PAGLIUCA: Not ‘from 'mé, your Honor.

MS, POMERANTZ: Your Honer, nothing further,

I jst Wantéd to noté that tin thé transcript for ‘your
Honor. OQur understanding is that the question. that had. been
posed 'to Dr. Rocchio was about ‘the presence of third 'partiés,
and. just wanted tq make that clear for your Honor when. she had
said no, that was our understanding aS t6 what she was saying
n@ about, in terms ‘of the support in the literature, your
Honor.

But, I take your Honor's ‘point. We can move on, your
Honor. I just wanted to explain that to the Court, wheré the.
question was coming from, ‘your Honor.

THE COURT: The question you asked that was sbjected

to here was, Based on ‘your experience, research, and training,

1s thé person doing the grooming always the recipient. Of the
sexual gratification?

For the reaséns I've, indicated, that is precluded by
the narrow basis on which I did, preclude what they call

grooming by proxy: Again, I see there's a slight andlytical

distinction between the question you asked and that theory, but
the questioh, I think == and I séé that she says no, that.
wasn't how she understood it. But still for me, that. testimony
was in. aid of the next piece, which I. excluded.
