The ‘Court’s request for updates, concerning Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement:
does little to improve her situation. Quite the: contrary. The government’s update Ictters are
anything but helpful: They fuel media, attention which resounds to Ms. Maxwell’s detriment. The
public opinion further crodes the likelihood. that her case will be tried by a fair and impartial jury.

The: government’s ‘review of the MDG may be’Yelp-worthy, but it docs not justify Ms.

defendants, it should do the right thing and consent to bail.

It-is debatable whether'the:public: has a “right to know” about Ms. Maxwell’s conditions
of confinement, but clearly, it docs not extend to personal and. medical information. The
government, safeguards personal information, regarding ‘its witnesses and is reluctant to ‘release
any unless mandated by statute: or'court order. Yet the government fails to accord Ms. Maxwell
the same treatment.

Should the: Court request further updates from the government, we request:that-they be

limited:to. changed circumstances and filed under scal or subject to appropriate redaction.

‘Very truly yours,

BOBBIC. STERNHEIM
