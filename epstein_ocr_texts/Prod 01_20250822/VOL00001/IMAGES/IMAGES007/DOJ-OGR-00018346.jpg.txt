1 the photos that the Court will admit are a sufficient basis

2 under 901(b) (4) which permits authentication based on the

3 appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns or other

4 distinctive characteristics of the item taken together with all
5 of the circumstances. United States v. Al Farekh, 810 F.Appx

6 2144, Second Circuit 2020.

7 Based on this case law, the Court will address the

8 government's requested photographs specifically.

9 First, the government seeks to admit six photos,

10 Exhibits 909 through 911, and 913, 915, and 933 that depict

11 structural features of Epstein's apartment. These photos

12 corroborate Jane's testimony that the apartment was massive and
13 contained lots of stone and old wood. Trial transcript 317 to
14 18 and 320. These are structural features likely to have

15 remained relatively unchanged, even years later. Indeed, the
16 defense expressly does not object to these photos. I admit

17 these six photos.

18 Second, I will admit the photos of Epstein's massage
19 room, photos 902 through 904, 917 and 928, but only if the
20 pictures on the wall are redacted. The exhibits could
21 corroborate several aspects of Jane's testimony, including that
22 the room was the size of a giant walk-in closet, but space for
23 a giant massage table in the middle of it. Trial transcript at
24 320 x
25 She also described it as very dark and with a red mood
