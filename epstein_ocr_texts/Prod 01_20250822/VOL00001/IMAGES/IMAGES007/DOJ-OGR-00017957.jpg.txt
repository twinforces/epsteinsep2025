7 today. Do you recall that testimony this morning?

8 A. I do.

9 Q. You yourself have not published anything specifically about

11 A. No.
12 Q. And you yourself have not conducted any metadata studies to
13 collect and analyze literature about grooming, correct?
14 A. Correct.
15 Q. And a metadata study is a somewhat comprehensive review of

17 then having a publication that deals with the metadata
18 analysis. Is that a fair summary of what that would be?
19 A. A statistical analysis, yes.

al studies that are done by other people, correct?
