LC6Cmax7 Maguire - cross

1 that you executed a few days later on July lith, that allowed

2 you to go back and collect CDs; right?

i) A. Yes, Sir.

4 Q. So getting back to the day of the first execution of the

5 first warrant, that would be July 6th of 2019; is that correct?
6 A. Yes, Sir, it is.

7 Q. And I believe the search started roughly around 5:30, 5:40
8 in the evening; is that right?

9 A. Yes, sir. I believe we approached the residence shortly

10 after 5:30 and then actually entered the residence

11 approximately 5:45, did the protective sweep, and I believe the
12 search started at 6:15 p.m., approximately.

13 Q. In the evening?

14 A. Yes, sir.

15 Q. And I think you were there executing that and the second

16 warrant you got on July 7th all the way through the night;

17 isn't that right?

18 A. Yes, sir, that's correct.

19 Q. And I think the search ended early in the morning, around
20 6:30 a.m., is that right?
21 A. Yes, Sir, it is.
22 Q. But it's safe to say for those first two warrants, I'm not
23 talking about the one when you came back with the CDs, but for
24 the times -- the warrants you executed where you took the
25 photographs were on July 6th, 2019, July 7th, 2019; right?
