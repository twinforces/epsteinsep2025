LC8VMAX6 Rodgers â€”- cross

1 the cockpit and walk all the way through the plane to get to

2 the rest room in the back of the plane, right?

3 A. Right.

4 Q. And on the occasions when you did use the rest room on the
S Gulfstream, you never saw anything of a sexual nature going on
6 in the passenger cabin, right?

7 A. No, I did not.

8 Q. Okay. Did you ever leave the cabin -- or, sorry, the

9 cockpit to get coffee?

10 A. No, we had our own coffee up in that area that we could

11 make.

12 Q. That was on the Gulfstream, I think, right?

13 A. Correct.

14 Q. But on the Boeing, there was a galley kitchen in the middle
15 of the plane, right?

16 A. There was. But also we had our own coffeemaker up front in
17 the Boeing. But, yes, there was one in the galley.

18 Q. Did you ever go get coffee from the galley kitchen in the
19 middle of the plane?
20 A. Not that I recall.
2l Q. Okay. All right.
22 Well, let me ask you this question: After a flight
23 lands on either the Gulfstream or the Boeing, it's generally
24 the pilot's responsibility to help straighten up the cabin
25 after flight; is that right?
