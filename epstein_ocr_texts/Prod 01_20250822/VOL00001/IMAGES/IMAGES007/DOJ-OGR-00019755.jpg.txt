Case 21-58, Document 20-2, 03/24/2021, 3065965, Page10 of 24
statement might have occurred decades ago and have no relevance to the charges in
this case. These individuals still maintain a significant privacy interest that must be
safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad and risks undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that is required by law. In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this case. It also
allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe may be
relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the
investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33-1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the
protective order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court on a case—by—case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential
witnesses and their counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than
preparing for trial in this case are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented
despite the fact that there have been many high-profile criminal matters that had
related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other
policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all of which the Court expects the Government to scrupulously
follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates that it will likely only provide potential
witnesses with materials that those witnesses already have in their possession. See Dkt.
No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses who do testify at trial would be subject to
examination on the record as to what materials were provided or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers explains how its unprecedented
proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a fair trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed protective order, which will be
entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge
