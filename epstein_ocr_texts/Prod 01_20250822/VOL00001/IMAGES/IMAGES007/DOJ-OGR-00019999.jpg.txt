‘Case’ 21-58, Document 39-2, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page140 of 200. 7
k7e2MaxC kje | :
government, stibmits that the sta@téments of 'thée victims, certainly
shed light. on the gravity of the offense conduct, the harm it
has Gdaused, and how sériotis that condtict is. The court can and
should take that into accqunt. My point was a precedural one;
that! it is net. the case that the government is submitting this
as evidence in support of its. motion, but it is certainly the
Case that the victims, experiences, the harms, 'that they have
been caused can be considered by the court with respect to the
naturé and circumstances 6f the offense conduct; which we

submit. is gravely serious.

THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

Mr. Cohen, veny briefly, any final points?
MR; COHEN: Yes, your Horior, very briefly. I won't

get into it, but I don't think she just answered your quest.ion,

about. what, théy are déing with respect to the CVRA victims, but

I, will, leave that ‘to the court.

Just. very quickly, two p6éints, your Honor.

The government says in its response now that the case
t6o be relied upon ahd distinguished is U.S. v. Epstéin; They
didn't raise it in, their opening memorandum or their reply or
in théir oral presentation before your Honor. To the extent
your Honor .considers it, and we have certainly looked at it and
the transcript. of the proceeding before Judge Berman; most of
that case is about dangerousness, your Honor, which is
something the government is expressly not proceeding under here
