Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

Once again, the government reports second- and third-hand information from the MDC,
the reliability of which becomes increasingly questionable. In its May 5" letter regarding the
MDC’s flashlight security checks of Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 270), the government contradicts a
previous report that Ms. Maxwell “has an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately refuted by her
counsel, was a focus of the Second Circuit’s questioning during oral argument of Ms. Maxwell’s
bail appeal. Now, the government reports that the MDC cannot provide an eye mask to Ms.
Maxwell and that an eye mask is considered contraband. This alone is a basis for the Court to
question the veracity of representations made by the MDC.

To justify the 15-minute flashlight surveillance that is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive
sleep and sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is on “an enhanced security
schedule.” The reasons given to support the need for “heightened safety and security concerns”
with respect to Ms. Maxwell are spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell to the detriment of
other pretrial detainees who face even more serious charges and potential stress (i.e., defendants
charged with murder and terrorism offenses subjected to life sentences without possibility of
release and the death penalty) and who are incarcerated in cells by themselves. The MDC
attempts to shift the focus of its conduct by claiming that it is responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s
“expressed concern for her safety if she were housed in general population.”

The MDC should fact check its records before making bold assertions. The Intake
Screening Form completed by Ms. Maxwell upon entry to the MDC on July 6, 2020 posed the
following question: “Do you know of any reason why you should not be placed in general
population?” Ms. Maxwell responded “No.” It is the MDC, not the inmate, who makes the
determination regarding general population or degree of segregation. The Intake Screening
