LC8VMAX4 Rodgers - direct

1 the Boeing during the flights you piloted?

2 A. No.

3 Q. During your time working as a pilot for Mr. Epstein, what,
4 if any, records did you keep about the flights that you

5 piloted?

6 A. We kept a passenger manifest which we filled out after

7 every flight. And then at the end of the day, we had an

8 aircraft log that we put down flight times that we flew on that
9 particular day. And then I also kept a personal logbook.
10 Q. Walking through each of those, starting with the flight log
11 for the plane, what information went into that log?
12 A. Okay. On the passenger manifest you'd have the date, you
13 would have the trip number, you would have the departure, the
14 destination. We had who the passengers were on there, the
15 flight time, I think we also had the amount of fuel we would
16 purchase on there. And then on the aircraft log, it was really
17 for maintenance procedures. It had about engine times,
18 aircraft landings, APU times, stuff like that.
19 Q. What happened to the passenger manifests that you filled
20 out for Jeffrey Eostein's planes?
al A. Those —--— I had those and turned those over to an attorney
22 of Jeffrey's.
23 Q. One of Jeffrey Epstein's attorneys?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Did you keep a copy?
