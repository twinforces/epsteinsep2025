1 you want to inguire, I'll allow that, and then I'll make my

2 ruling.

3 If 52 is admitted, I'll indicate that it's admitted in
4 redacted form, and for those purposes, Mr. Pagliuca, you'd like
S the witness to compare each of the A, D, E, F, G, H pages to

6 those in the book.

7 MR. PAGLIUCA: I think the answer to that question is
8 depending on whether the Court admits it or not, then we don't
9 need to make a copy. If the Court is not going to admit it,

10 then we don't get to the 52. If the Court does admit it, I do
11 not need an on-the-record comparison because we've dealt with,
12 I think, the issue. I accept that the government is going to
13 say, and I agree, that they, they, the government, have copied
14 those pages. That was not the problem of my objection. It was
15 the rest of this format of how this was being done.

16 So I think if it's admitted, they say: Here's 52. Is
17 that a copy of a page out of the book? Yes. Okay, fine. And
18 we move on. Because the actual substance has been admitted, we
19 don't have to deal with -- copies are the same.
20 THE COURT: How about this: If I sustain the
al objection, that's the end of it. If I overrule the objection,
22 52 will be admitted in redacted form, and then you can
23 stipulate to the government's 52A, D, E, F, G and H being true
24 and correct photocopies of five pages from 52. Is that
25 reasonable?
