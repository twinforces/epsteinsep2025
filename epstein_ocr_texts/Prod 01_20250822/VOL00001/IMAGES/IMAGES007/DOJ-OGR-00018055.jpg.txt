you Wart! to ingtwire, I'll allow that, and ‘then, I"1l make my
ruling.

If 52 is admitted, T'll indicdte that it's admitted in
redacted form, and for those purposes, Mr, Pagliuca, you'd -like
the witness to compare each of the A, D, E, F, G, H pages, 'to
those in the book.

MR. PAGLIUCA: T ‘think the answer to ‘that question is
depending on whether the Court admits it er net, then we don't
need to make a copy. If the Court is, not going to admit it,

then we don't get to the 52, Lf the Court does admit. it, I do

not need an on=the=record comparisoh because we've déalt. with,
I, think, the issue. I accept that the government. is going to
say, and I agree, that they, they, the government, have cdépicd
those pages. That was mot the problem of my objection. It was
the rest 6f this format of how this was being done.

SQ I, think if it's admitted, they say: Here's 52. Is
that a copy of a page out of the book? Yes. Okay, fine. And

we move on. Because the actual substance has. been, admitted, we

dén't. have to deal with == copies are the same.
THE COURT: How about this: If I sustain, the

objection, that's the end of it. Tf I overrule the objection,

S2 will be admitted, in, redacted form, and then, you, can
stipulate to the government's 52A, D, E,; F, G and H béing true
and correct photocopies of five pages from 52. Is that
reasonable?
