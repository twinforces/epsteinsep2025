Case 21-58, Document 76, 04/19/2021, 3080288; Page13 of 30.

CONCLUSION

Ms. Maxwell should be released. The allegations against her are
weak, she is not a risk of flight, and her appearance at trial is assured by
an unprecedented bail package. In the meantime, she cannot effectively
prepare for trial under these truly appalling conditions.

The Government's tactic in this appeal, and in the court below, is
transparent — it is “trust us.” Trust our proffer on the evidence because
we indicted her (and,this case relates to Jeffrey Epstein). Trust us when
we say her conditions.are fine because the Bureau of Prisons says.they are
fine (and we :can’t have another Jeffrey Epstein situation). The court
below clearly erred, however, in just trusting the Government without any
actual. evidence and without a, réal hearing, notwithstanding Jeffrey
Epstein. As much as the Government would like this case to be the
Jeffrey Epstein show, Ghislaine Maxwell is not Jeffrey Epstein.

Ms. Maxwell understands that she and the Government are not
going. to. agree on. the facts.. This is an adversary system, of :course. But
in that circumstance, there must be an adversarial hearing where Ms.
Maxwell, can demonstrate that the Government’s case — based on old,

anonymous accusations—is weak. There must be an adversarial hearing
