(E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application for bail in part because
home detention with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing defendant’s head start’’);
United States v. Benatar, No. 02 Cr. 099, 2002 WL 31410262, at *3 (E.D.N.Y. Oct. 10, 2002)
(same); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744, at *9 (N.D. Cal.
Feb. 2018) (same); United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 41 (D.D.C. 2005) (same).

CONCLUSION
As set forth above, the defendant is an extreme risk of flight. The Government respectfully
submits that the defendant cannot meet her burden of overcoming the statutory presumption in
favor of detention. There are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in
court proceedings in this case. Accordingly, any application for bail should be denied.
