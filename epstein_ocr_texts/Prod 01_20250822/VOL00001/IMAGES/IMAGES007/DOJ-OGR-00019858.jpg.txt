Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page30 of 31
CONCLUSION
Ms. Maxwell faces old, anonymous accusations that have never
been tested. In any other case, she would have been released long ago.
But because of the “Epstein effect,” she is being detained and in truly
unacceptable conditions. All we are asking for is a chance to defend the
case. We respectfully request that Ms. Maxwell be released on
reasonable conditions of bail or that the case be remanded for an
evidentiary hearing.
Respectfully submitted,
