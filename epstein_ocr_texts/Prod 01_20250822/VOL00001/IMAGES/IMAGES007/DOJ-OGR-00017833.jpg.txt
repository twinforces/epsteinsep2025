LC1VMAX7 Matt - direct

1 A. Yes.

2 Q. Let me just take a step back and ask you some questions

3 about how that topic came up. In general, how would the topic
4 of Jane's home life come up during the course of your

a relationship?

6 A. There's different aspects of the home life, but just most
7 likely, I would say, getting to know her family and getting to
8 know the relationships between her and her siblings and her

9 mother and the struggles that she went through.

10 Q. During the years that you were dating Jane, did she tell
11 you about what her home life was like when she was a kid?

12 A. Yes, she did.

13 Q. What did she tell you about that?

14 MS. STERNHEIM: Objection.

15 THE COURT: Do you want a more specific question?

16 MS. STERNHEIM: Well, that is hearsay. That is not
17 the basis of this witness's testimony.

18 MS. MOE: Your Honor, it's both the foundation for a
19 prior consistent statement and a prior consistent statement
20 itself.
21 THE COURT: In light of cross, I think that's right,
22 but I'll hear you if â€”-
23 MS. STERNHEIM: If I may be heard briefly.
24 THE COURT: Yes.
