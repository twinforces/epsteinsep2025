Re: Annie Farmer v. Darren K. Indyke, Richard D. Kahn, & Ghislaine Maxwell,
19-10475-LGS-DCF
Dear Judge Freeman:

Pursuant to Individual Rule I.D, Plaintiff Annie Farmer hereby responds to Defendant
Ghislaine Maxwell’s request for a pre-motion conference in connection with her anticipated
motion to stay discovery in this matter. The Court should deny Maxwell’s motion for a pre-motion
conference and deny her anticipated motion in its entirety because, as explained below, each of
Maxwell’s reasons for staying discovery is meritless and the motion is simply another attempt to
unjustifiably delay this litigation.

First, a pending criminal investigation of Maxwell does not justify a stay of discovery.
“TA] stay of a civil case to permit conclusion of a related criminal prosecution has been
characterized as an extraordinary remedy.” Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA, Inc., 676 F.3d
83, 98 (2d Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks omitted). In this Circuit, courts balance the
following six factors when considering whether to stay a civil case pending related criminal
proceedings:

1) the extent to which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those presented

in the civil case; 2) the status of the case, including whether the defendants have

been indicted; 3) the private interests of the plaintiffs in proceeding expeditiously

weighed against the prejudice to plaintiffs caused by the delay; 4) the private

interests of and burden on the defendants; 5) the interests of the courts; and 6) the

public interest.

Id. at 99. And according to the very case Maxwell cites in support of staying this action pending
a criminal investigation: “The weight of authority in this Circuit indicates that courts will stay a
civil proceeding when the criminal investigation has ripened into an indictment, but will deny a
stay of the civil proceeding where no indictment has issued.” In re Par Pharm., Inc. Sec. Litig.,
133 F.R.D. 12, 13-14 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). The Court
should deny Maxwell’s motion for a stay without prejudice to her ability to renew her application
if she is arrested. Until that happens, however, there are no grounds for a stay.
