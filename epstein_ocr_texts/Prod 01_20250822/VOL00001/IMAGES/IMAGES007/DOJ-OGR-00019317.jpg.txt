Re: Annie Farmer v.. Darren K. Indyke, Richard D. Kahn,, & Ghislaine Maxwell,
19-10475-LGS-DCE

Dear Judge Freeman:

Pursuant. to Individual Rule ID, Plaintiff Aric Farmer hereby reésponds.'to Defendant.
Ghislaine: Maxwell’s ‘request :for a pre-motion. conference: in connection. with. her anticipated.
motion,to'stay:discovery'in:this matter. The Courtishould.deny: Maxwell’s motion. for'a. pre-motion.
conference and deny her anticipated. motion in its entirety because, as explained below, cach, of
Maxwell’s reasons for'staying discovery is meritless and ‘the motion is simply: another attempt to
unjustifiably delay'this litigation.

First, a. pending, criminal, investigation of Maxwell. docs not justify: a, stay of discovery.
“[A] stay of a civil case to permit conclusion, of a related criminal prosccution, has been,
characterized as an extraordinary remedy.” Louis, Viiitton.Malletier S.A. v. EY USA, Inés 676 F.3d.
83, 98 (2d, Cir. 2012); (internal, quotation marks omitted). In. this Circuit, courts balance the
following six factors: when considering whcther ‘to stay’ a :civil case pending :related criminal
proceedings: . . ;

1) the extent to which, the issues, in the criminal case overlap with those presented.
in the civil case; 2), the status of the case, including whether the defendants have
been indicted; 3) the private: interests of the: plaintiffs in. proceeding expeditiously
weighed. against the prejudice ‘to plaintiffs caused by the delay; 4) the: private:
interests of and burden‘on the defendants; 5) the ‘interests. of the courts; and. 6) the
public interest.

Id. at 99. And according:to the very case Maxwell cites in support. of staying this. action. pending
a.criminal investigation: “The weight of. authority i in. this Circuit indicates that. courts will stay a
civil proceeding: when the: criminal investigation, has ripened. into an indictment, but will deny a
stay of the civil proceeding where no indictment-has issued.” Inve Par.Pharm., Ine. Sec. Litig.,
133 B. R. D. 12; 13= l4 (S. D. N. Y. 1990) (emphasis. added) (internal citations omitted), ‘The Court

if she is arrested. ‘Until that happens, however, there are:no grounds for a stay.
