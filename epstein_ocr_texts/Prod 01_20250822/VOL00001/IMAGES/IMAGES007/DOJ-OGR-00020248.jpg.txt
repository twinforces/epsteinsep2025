E. Judge Nathan’s Oversight of Maxwell’s Conditions of

Confinement

26. Asshe indicated she would, Judge Nathan has closely monitored
Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, including by ordering the Government to
submit regular updates regarding that topic (see Gov’t Ex. A (compiling update
letters and relevant court orders)), and, in one instance, ordering the MDC to provide
Maxwell access to a Government-issued laptop on weekends and holidays (see id.
at 10-11). The Government most recently filed such an update on April 6, 2021,
noting, among other things, Maxwell’s extensive access to discovery and
communications with counsel; her regular access to outdoor recreation; the thirteen
hours per day during which she is brought to a day room outside of her cell with
exclusive access to a television, a phone, two computers, and a shower; and her
access to medical care, including the COVID-19 vaccine, which she has now
received. (/d. at 17-22).
