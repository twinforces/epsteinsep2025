1 The only question in any specific instance is is it impeaching,
2 and is it a prior inconsistent statement. We have to deal with
3 the rules around a prior inconsistent statement. It wasn't

4 like you had deposition testimony. You had an FBI agent's

a write-up of notes which the witness was confronted with and

6 said it was a mistake. Again, that wasn't moved in, but we can
7 deal with that as it comes.

8 There could be -- not here, but there could be 608

9 issues if you're trying to use extrinsic evidence. If what we
10 have is impeaching by contradiction, impeachment of what the

11 witness testified to on the stand, then it's not going to be a
12 608 issue.

13 MR. EVERDELL: If we're impeaching the witness, yes,
14 that's right. And I just want to address the issue of

15 impeaching with extrinsic evidence, which I know the government
16 has raised. That rule is -- and the cases they cite --

17 THE COURT: I know you cited Rule 613. I hadn't

18 understood their argument to be about 613.

19 MR. EVERDELL: They raised in their papers the notion
20 that you can't impeach -- or you can't use extrinsic evidence
al to impeach. But the rule there and the cases they've cited
22 stand for the unremarkable proposition that you can't
23 impeach -- or you can't use extrinsic evidence on a collateral
24 matter.
25 THE COURT: Correct.
