Protective Orders May Be Modified As Circumstances Change
Finally, the government suggests in a myriad of ways without directly arguing that this
Protective Order cannot be modified, that Ms. Maxwell somehow waived her ability to seek
modification by agreeing to a Protective Order before she knew what was contained in the
criminal discovery, or that there is no precedent for such a modification. These suggestions are
disingenuous. Of course, the Government ignores that the Protective Order itself provides that it
may be modified “by further order of the Court.” Jd,  18(b).
There is no precedence for this case. That is true because the Second Circuit has outlined a
process for the government to seek civil materials subject to protective orders for use in grand
jury investigations, a process the government circumvented. It also is true because typically, the
government is the party to intervene in civil cases and seek a stay where materials the
government has marked “Confidential” may be disclosed publicly or where the government
contends the rules of criminal discovery will be circumvented. Finally, there is no other case that
defense counsel has located where [a

That Ms. Maxwell did not know what was in the sealed materials before she signed the
Protective Order, or proposed a draft, is self-evident. That a Court can modify a protective order
at any time is likewise well-established. Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(1) authorizes the Court to
regulate discovery through protective orders and modification of those orders. See Smith Kline
Beecham Corp. v. Synthon Pharmaceuticals, Ltd., 210 F.R.D. 163, 166 (M.D.N.C. 2002)
(“[c]ourts have the inherent power to modify protective orders, including protective orders
arising from a stipulation by the parties”); see also United States v. Gurney, 558 F.2d 1202, 1211
n.15 (Sth Cir. 1977) (trial court's decisions as to which documents “will be placed in the public
domain, and which are entitled to privacy and confidentiality” are discretionary and “form an
integral part of trial management”); United States v. Wecht, 484 F.3d 194, 211 (3d Cir. 2007), as
amended (July 2, 2007) (“it would have been proper for the District Court to unseal the records
pursuant to its general discretionary powers”); Poliquin v. Garden Way, Inc., 989 F.2d 527, 532
& 535 (1st Cir. 1993).
“The standard of review for a request to vacate or modify a protective order depends on the
nature of the documents in question. There is a presumptive right of public access to judicial
