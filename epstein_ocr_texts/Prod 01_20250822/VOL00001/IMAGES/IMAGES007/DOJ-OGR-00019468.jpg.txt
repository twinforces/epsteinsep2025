MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked forthe Court:to enter a protective order: While'they agree on, most:of the language,
two areas of dispute;/have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allowing’her to
publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have 'spoken.on the public record to
the, media or in public fora, or in, litigation. relating to Ms. Maxwell. or.Jeffrey Epstein.
Second, Ms. Maxwell secks language ‘restricting ‘potential Government:witnesses and their
counsel from ‘using discovery. matcrials for: any purpose other than preparing forthe.
criminal trial, in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on beth. of
these issues. For'the following’ reasons, the Court.adopts the Government's proposed
protective order Under Federal. Rule of Criminal.Proccdure 16(d)(1), “[a]t any time the:
court may; for good, cause, deny, ‘restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other
appropriate relicf." The good cause standard “requirés courts to balance séveral interests,
including whether disscmination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard.to others...
whetherthe. imposition of the protéctive order would :prejudice the defendant," and "the
public's. ifiterést' in the information." United States 'v. Smith, 985.F. Supp. 2d ‘506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party secking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing, good
cause. Cf. Gambalé'v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d.Cir. 2004). First, ‘the.
Court finds:that the Government has:mct.its burden of showing good:cause with:regard to
restricting the ability:of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and witnesses
other than.those who: have publicly: identified themselves in this litigation. Asa general
matter, it is undisputed that there:is a strong and specific interest in: protecting the privacy:
of.alleged victims and witnesscs in. this case:that: supports restricting the disclosure of their
identities. Dkt. ‘No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging that.as a. bascline:the protective order should
“prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on.the: defense team from. disclosing
or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or, potential witness referenced in the
discovery materials"); sec also: United ‘States v: Corley, No. 13-cr-48, 2016'U:S. Dist.

LEXIS 194426, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 201.6). The Defense argues this interest is:

significantly diminished for individuals who have spoken on the public record about Ms.

Maxwell, or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily chosen to identify” themselves.

But:not all accusations ‘or public statements arc equal. Deciding to participate’ in-or
contribute to a.criminal., investigation or: prosecution is a far different. matter than simply
making: a-public' statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, ‘particularly since
such, a statement, might have occurred. decades ago and have‘no relevance to the charges in,
this:case. These individuals still maintain.a significant privacy interest that must’be
safeguarded. The: exception the ‘Defense secks.is too broad. and risks-undermining the
protections of the privacy of witnesses and ‘alleged victims, that is ‘required by law. ‘In
contrast, the Government's proffered language would ‘allow Ms. Maxwell'to publicly
reference individuals who have spoken by name’ on’the record ‘in this case. It-also allows
the Defense to “referene[e] the identitics of individuals, they belicve may be'relevant... to
Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of the investigation and
preparation of the defense case’ at. trial." Dkt. No. 33-1,.5. This proposal adequately
balances the intérests at: stake. And asthe Government's letter notes, sce Dkt. No. 33 at-4,,
to the extent that the Defense ticeds an. exception to, the protective order for a specific:
investigative purpose, they can make applications’to the Court on a case-by-case: basis.
Second, réstrictions on. the ability of potential ‘witnesses and, their counsel to use discovery
matcrials for purposes other than-preparing for trial, in this.cas¢ are unwarranted. The
