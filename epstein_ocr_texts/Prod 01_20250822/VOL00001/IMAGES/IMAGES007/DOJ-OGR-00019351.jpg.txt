Case 20-3061, Document 37, 09/16/2020, 2932231, Page9 of 24
458 U.S. 263, 265 (1982) (per curiam); see also Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 270 (noting
“overriding policies against interlocutory review in criminal cases” and that
“exceptions to the final judgment rule in criminal cases are rare’’); United States v.
Culbertson, 598 F.3d 40, 46 (2d Cir. 2010) (recognizing that “undue litigiousness
and leaden-footed administration of justice,’ the common consequences of
piecemeal appellate review, are ‘particularly damaging to the conduct of criminal
cases’” (quoting Di Bella v. United States, 369 U.S. 121, 124 (1962))).

11. There is a limited exception to this rule that permits immediate
appeal from certain collateral orders. See Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S.
463, 468 (1978) (citing Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541
(1949)). To fall within the “small class” of decisions that constitute immediately
appealable collateral orders, the decision must “(1) conclusively determine the
disputed question, (2) resolve an important issue completely separate from the
merits of the action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final
judgment.” Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, 486 U.S. 517, 522 (1988) (internal
quotation marks and citations omitted).

12. The Supreme Court has made clear that the collateral order
exception should be “interpreted . . . with the utmost strictness in criminal cases.”

quotation marks omitted) (quoting Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 265); accord United
