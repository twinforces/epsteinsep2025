‘MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine-Maxwell. Both parties have

askéd for the. Court to enter a protective order. While‘they agrée. on most'of the
language, two areas of dispute. have emerged. First, Ms.. Maxwell seeks. language.
allowing her to:publicly reference. alleged.’ victims or witnesses‘who have spoken on

the public: record to'the media or in: ‘public ‘fora, or in. litigation-relating-to Ms. Maxwell

or Jeffrey Epstein. ‘Second; Ms, Maxwell, secks: language. testt ‘iting: potential
Government’ witnesses and their counsel, from using discov. ery'materials for‘any

purpose other than preparing for the:criminal trial inthis action. The:Government has
‘proposed contrary. language: on both:of these issues. For the following reasons, the

Court adopts the: Government's proposed protective order Under: Federal, Rule of
Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t-any time the court-may, for good:cause, deny,

‘restrict, or defer discovery: or inspection, or:grant‘other appropriate relief." The. good

caiise Standard "tequiites cotitts to balance several interests, including whether
dissemination of the discovery. materials‘inflicts hazard;to others... whether the:

‘imposition. of the protective. order would prejudice: the defendant," and. "the public's

interest inthe information.” United. States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp..2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y; 2013). The party secking to restrict disclosure beats the burden of showing

good-cause. Cf, Gambale-v. ‘Deutsche Bank: AG; 377 F:3d.133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First; the Court finds’that the Gov ernment has met.its burden. of showing. good cause:
with regard to restricting the ability,of.Ms. Maxwell:to publicly:reference ‘alleged,

victims and witnesses other than, those who have publicly identified themselves in this.
litigation. A's a gencral matter, it'is undisputed that there isa 'strong and specific
interest in: ‘protecting the: privacy: of. alleged :victims and-witnesses in this case that
supports restricting the. disclosure of theif-identitics: Dkt. No: 29 at 3 (acknowledging:
that as a baseline the protective order’should "prohibit{] Ms. Maxwell, defense
counsel, and. others on the defense. team from. disclosing or disseminating the identity
of any: alleged. victim. or: ‘potential witness referenced.in the discovery-materials"); see
also United States Vi C Orley, No: 13-cr —48,, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *1]
(S.D:N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016).'The Defense argues this ‘interest:is significantly diminished
for individuals‘who have spoken. on the: public record about.Ms. ‘Maxwell or Jeffrey:

Epstein, because they have:voluntarily:chosen-to ‘identify themselves. But not.all

accusations or public statements are equal. Deciding to, participate-in. or contribute toa
criminal, inv estigation Or ‘prosecution. is‘a far different’matter than simply making a |

public statement ' ‘relating to" Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such.a
