1 forms that they maintain in the normal course of business that
2 captures information for purposes of the employer providing the
3 insurance through another entity and maintains those records

4 and the like, my intuitive reaction is those probably fit

5 within the business records exception depending on some of the
6 specifics of the testimony, but I'll look at the question and

7 if anybody has any authority for the proposition either way,

8 and my team will look at it in the meantime.

9 MR. ROHRBACH: Thank you, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: Anything else?

11 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, there is an issue, we

12 haven't had the chance to confer with government --

13 THE COURT: I don't think your mic is on.

14 MR. EVERDELL: There is a small issue with the fourth
15 witness, I think that's Mr. Rogers, but we haven't had the

16 chance to confer yet. I think we can do it fairly quickly. We
17 can probably do it at the break since it's probably going to be
18 the fourth witness; is that right? We'll do it then.

19 THE COURT: Anything else to take up in the immediate?
20 MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing from the government.
al THE COURT: Anything else from the defense?
22 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: We'll break until we have our jury. Thank
24 you.
25 Ms. Sternheim do you need these back, 823 and 824?
