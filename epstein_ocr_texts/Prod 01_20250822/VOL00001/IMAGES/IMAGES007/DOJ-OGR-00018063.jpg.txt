LC2VMAX6 Alessi — Direct

1 THE COURT: I understand.

2 I'm going to overrule the objection. Go ahead.

3 Q. Would you please look through the exhibit and let us know

4 if you see Sarah Kellen's name in the exhibit?

S A. Can you repeat the name?

6 Q. Sarah Kellen.

7 THE COURT: Actually, do you know what? I'll ask you
8 to pause, Mr. Alessi. I'll sustain the objection. I think

9 it's lost the thread on authentication at this point. You'll
10 go to the question that I asked you to.

11 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I'm sorry. Now I'm confused.
12 THE COURT: The earlier foundation objection that I

13 asked you to return to.

14 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

15 May I have a moment?

16 THE COURT: You may.

17 (Counsel conferred)

18 BY MS. COMEY:

19 Q. So Mr. Alessi —-
20 A. Yes.
2l Q. -- how do you know that this Government Exhibit 52 is a
22 later version of the directory that you saw when you worked for
23 Mr. Epstein?
24 A. I think this is a later version. In the back page of the
25 front cover it says 2004-2005.
