WILLIAM JULIE
AVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW

. This concern over. opportunistic nationality applications. is precisely the justification.of

the:rule mentioned. in academic literature (sec ‘for example Répertoire de droit pénal et
de procédure penile Extradition,Pén. — Conditions défond del'extradition —

Delphine.Brach-Lhiel- October 2018, $59).

. Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents

and .éase law

The French /Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case
‘can,be:found.where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure'was-applicd

French authorities were faced with the deportation. of a person who had. lost French
nationality. Both. extradition and deportation allow ‘for the removal. of a person from
French territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third, State, with

the consent and, cooperation. of the authoritics. of that State.

The.European Court:of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”) treats extradition and,deportation
analogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars

apply to all types of removal of'a person. from:the territory of a State party (“the Gourt
considers that the question whether there is.a@ real. risk of eatment contrary to.Article
3 in another State cannot depend on. the legal basis for removal to: that Staté. The

Court's own-case-law has shown that, in practice, there may belittle difference between
