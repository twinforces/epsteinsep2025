1 (At sidebar)

2 THE COURT: This is grooming by third-party

3 involvement. They called it grooming by proxy. It isa

4 specific area that I precluded in my opinion. That was the

5 only -- in the Daubert, the only questions that were asked

6 about whether there might be someone else who receives the

7 sexual gratification was in the context of that precise issue.
8 We talked about it in the context of testimony in the

9 pimp-prostitute context, and it was litigated entirely on that
10 question, and that's where I precluded it.

11 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I just wanted to note we
12 weren't asking about the presence of a third party facilitating
13 a sexual abuse, which is what I understood your Honor's opinion
14 to be -—-

15 THE COURT: Well, you're toying with that boundary in
16 a way that was not discussed in the Daubert hearing. You

17 didn't ask that question that you just asked, and we only

18 discussed it.

19 So, for example, it sounds like she's giving an
20 opinion similar to the pimp-prostitute context, that we talked
21 about those cases precisely on this issue. So you're toying
22 with the boundary of what I've precluded in a way that was not
23 brought out during Daubert.
24 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I just note that I had
25 actually ran this question by defense counsel to avoid this
