LC.7VMAX7 Carolyn - cross
respond, to ‘that for paragraph 39°?

MS, COMEY: So for 39, your Honor, first with respect
to the ‘time frame, I think, the first clauSé 1S for the second
time in that month of that year. That's not inconsistent with
what the witness testified to. She testified shé was going
frequently, certainly at least twice a month, through 2002. So
that's not inconsistent.

With respect to the sex acts, I think here is part of
the issue with taking a légal doctiment and trying to suggest
that the witness should have included every single detail in
it. It is not necessarily thé case that in order to maké Out.
the legal. claims in this complaint, that a, lawyer would have
needed to include. anything other than fondling and
masturbation. So it is not to be expected that if she had told
her attorneys about the other sex atts, that they would have
included at. And so I don't think, the theory of omissions
works. with respect to the sex acts,

MR. PAGLIUCA: I, disagree, your Honor.

THE GOURT: Yes, I imagine.

MR. PAGLIUCA: I, mean, Ms. Comey doesn't do civid

work, but. it is significant. And it is significant for many
reasons. And in ‘partaculan --

THE GOURT: This. one, there are details included: The

one detd@il that was testified to is a significant, detail. So

with respect to 39, I'll overrule. Sorry, I'll sustain.
