1 I had a question. You indicated, Mr. Rohrbach,

2 something regarding Exhibit 52. Is there another witness who's
3 going to testify about Exhibit 52?

4 MS. COMEY: No.

5 MR. ROHRBACH: No, your Honor. We plan to submit a

6 letter tonight in articulating our theory why the Court should
7 admit that exhibit based on the current evidence.

8 THE COURT: You'll confer with defense counsel.

9 Obviously, I reserved based on the representation there would
10 be additional testimony.

11 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor.

12 THE COURT: Thank you.
