LC6Cmax5 McHugh â€”- cross
1 and 1064. Do you see those checks?
2 A. Ido.
3 Q. If you're looking at 1063, do you see that check is made
4 out to the United States Treasury; correct?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And that says in the middle line, 2007 form 1040; correct?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. So that's a check to pay for estimated taxes, isn't it?
9 A. I assume.
10 Q. So that check shows that Harry Beller is signing a check to
11 pay Ghislaine Maxwell's taxes for that year, doesn't it?
12 A. I don't know, but that's what that appears to be.
13 Q. And the check below, similar, goes to the New York State
14 Income Tax Authority; isn't that right?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. So it would appear from that check that Harry Beller is
17 signing a check on an account held by Ghislaine Maxwell to pay
18 Ghislaine Maxwell state taxes that year; isn't that right?
19 MS. MOE: Objection, your Honor.

22 MR. EVERDELL: Just one moment, your Honor, I'll be
23 able to tell you in a second.
24 THE COURT: Okay.
