unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the ‘form, the Court-will, conduct
an.inquiry‘at the outset:of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate. for the
Court to add:the Defendant's signature to the: form. Pursuant to 18 U°S.C. Ni 3771 (c)C1),
‘the Government niust:make-their best efforts to sce that ctime-victins are notified of,
and ‘accorded, the rights’provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he: ‘right to
reasonable, accurate, and.timely-notice of any. public: court proceeding... inv olving’ the:
crime orof any release... of the accused and "[t]he right:to be reasonably. heard at any
public proceeding 1 in the. district court involving: release." Td. § 377.1(a)(2), (4). The,

Court by email within 24 ‘hours in advance of the: proceeding ‘if any: alleged victim
wishes.to be heard. on'the question of detention: pending trial. Finally; the time between,
