1 people call band camp, that the end is like the equivalent of

2 color war for athletic camps?

3 A. I'm sorry, I don't have any experience with color war.

4 Q. Okay.

5) A. I don't know what that term means.

6 Q. It's when the performances are; it's the culmination of the
7 summer experience. Correct?

8 A. That's true, yeah.

9 Q. And it is then that performances are going on as opposed to
10 classes going on; correct?

11 A. The final day there are performances. I'm not sure if the
12 entire week is like that or not, but --

13 Q. But nonetheless, the donors, especially the major donors,
14 come for the performances; correct?

15 A. Yes. Some major donors do come to campus for performances.
16 Q. And Mr. Epstein certainly was a major donor; correct?

17 A. Correct.

18 Q. And the invitation for him to have the lodge was for the

19 period of time which is the culmination of the summer program;
20 COLLEGE ?
21 A. That would be correct, I would imagine, yes.
22 MS. STERNHEIM: May I have one moment, Judge?
23 THE COURT: Okay.
