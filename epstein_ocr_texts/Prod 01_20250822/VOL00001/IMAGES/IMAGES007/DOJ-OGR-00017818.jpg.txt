10 Matters to take up before the break?

11 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor.

12 MS. STERNHEIM: I have a matter, Judge. I believe the
13 next witness is Matt, whose issue was teed up yesterday. In

14 advance of his testimony, just to make sure that it is

15 compliant with the Federal Rules of Evidence, I would request
16 that the government give a proffer of what he is going to say,
17 as there are things in his 3500 material that did not come out
18 on direct examination, and it would be improper for him to be
19 able to testify as to things that are not prior consistent
20 statements.
21 THE COURT: There are things in his 3500 material that
22 the previous witness said to him --
23 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes.
24 THE COURT: -—- that were not asked about of the
25 witness.
