1 Ms. Roberts told you to say that you were 17 or 18?
2 A. That is not true.
3 Q. That's not true; is that your testimony?
4 A. She said if somebody asked, I needed to say that.
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: If we can show the witness the same
6 document at paragraph 4.
7 Q. Do you see on the last two lines there, "Carolyn was
8 previously instructed by Virginia to tell Epstein she was 17."
9 Do you see that?
10 A. Yeah.
11 Q. Is that what you told the FBI in August of 2007?
12 A. Yes, because I slipped up and told Mr. Epstein that I was
13 14.
14 Q. I'm not asking you what you told Mr. Epstein, I'm asking
15 you first, that's what Ms. Roberts told you and, at first, you
16 said no, and now you're saying yes?
17 A. She told me if anybody asked, I needed to say I was 1/7.
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: We can take that down.
19 Q. Do you remember Ms. Roberts saying that he, Epstein, was a
20 friend of hers, we can go there, you can give him a massage,
21 and he will pay. Do you remember that?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Now, I want to talk about the timeframe that you've
24 testified about. Isn't it true that the date you first went to
25 Epstein's house at the invitation of Roberts was in May or June
