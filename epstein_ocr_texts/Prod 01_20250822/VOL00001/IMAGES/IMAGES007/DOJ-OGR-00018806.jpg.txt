1 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, may I clarify on that?
2 I don't think the witness testified to a particular
3 time frame when the penetration actually took place. And so I
4 don't know that we can say that any particular paragraph is

23 that it was up to four times a week that she was going. And
24 this complaint goes month by month, two times a month. That's
25 what it talks about. That's what this is. So that's another
