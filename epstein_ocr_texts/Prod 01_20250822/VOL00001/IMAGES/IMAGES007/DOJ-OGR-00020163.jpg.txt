defendant cannot simultaneously pursue bail in both the Second Circuit and the district court. To
allow her to seek relief in both venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy
underpinning the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of a notice of appeal. See Rodgers, 101
F.3d at 251.!

The Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion does not leave the defendant
without a remedy. The defendant can withdraw her pending bail appeal to restore jurisdiction to
this Court. Alternatively, the Court can follow the procedure set forth in Rule 37(a) of the Federal
Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides that if the defendant makes a timely motion for relief
“that the court lacks authority to grant because of an appeal that has been docketed and is pending,
the court may: (1) defer considering the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state either that it
would grant the motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion raises a
substantial issue.” However, the defendant should not be permitted to simultaneously pursue bail
in both this Court and the Second Circuit.

Wil. The Court Should Not Reverse Its Prior Well-Reasoned and Thorough Bail
Decisions

Even if this Court had jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion, the motion should be
denied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant poses a risk of
flight. In particular, the Court has found, “the charges, which carry a presumption of detention,
' While the Government has not identified a case addressing the precise issue with which the Court
is confronted, several considerations support the Government’s position that the Court does not
presently have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion. In addition to the rule articulated by
the Supreme Court in Griggs, in Ching v. United States, the Second Circuit found that while an
appeal from the denial of a Section 2255 motion was pending, the district court could not rule on
a motion to amend the Section 2255 motion. 298 F.3d 174, 180 n.5 (2d Cir. 2002) (“The district
court could not rule on any motion affecting an aspect of the case that was before [the Second
Circuit], including a motion to amend the motion, while that appeal was pending.”’). Here, too,
while the defendant’s appeal of the denial of the Second Bail Motion is pending, the Court should
not grant the defendant’s motion to reconsider that very same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal
Rules of Appellate Procedure, which governs release in a criminal case, also supports such a
reading. Rule 9(b), which governs release after a judgment of conviction, provides that a “party
entitled to do so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding release after a judgment of
conviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by filing a motion in
the court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from the judgment of
conviction.” In United States v. Hochevar, 214 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 2000), the Second Circuit found
that Rule 9(b) contemplates going to the district court first for a bail ruling after a notice of appeal
from the judgment of conviction is filed. Rule 9(a), which governs release before a judgment of
conviction, does not say anything about going back to the district court for a new bail ruling after
a notice of appeal from a prior bail ruling is filed. In addition, Rule 9(a)(2) provides that the court
of appeals “must promptly determine” the pre-judgment bail appeal. Such promptness would not
be necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with another bail motion while the
bail appeal is pending.
