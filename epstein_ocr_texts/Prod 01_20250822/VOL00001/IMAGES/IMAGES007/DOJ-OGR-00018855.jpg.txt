Saturday the 18th. Tt is possible to Have Ms. Maxwell present
and tg make public access. available on that weekend date. So
you Can consider if you'd like to do that or not, Given where
we are in the schedule. I'll leave it to counsel to consider
it and confer. Alterndttiively, I Suppose we could talk about
the charging conference on the loth after we finish with the
jury. Any thoughts?

MS, MOE: Your Honor, the government has. no preference
between thosé ‘two datés and would be available for a December

18th conference. I think. the timing would just depend on the

length and pace of the defense case. For example, if thé

defense case were ‘to begin, on Friday, depending on, how long

that defense Gase were to last, it may be that we might néed to

have that conference earlier, but we don"t have a sense of the

length of the defense case, and sé it's hard for us to gauge

the taming.

MR. EVERDELL: May we confer, your Honor?

THE COURT: You may. Let me ask, does the government
anticipate == I know it's a littlé hard t6 predict, but do you
predict resting potentially by Thursday such that. --

MS. MOE: Yes, yéur Honor. It just depends 6n the
length of cross of the remaining witnesses, but I, ‘think it is
possible we will be resting on Thursday.

THE COURT: Okay.

MS. MOE: Thursday of this week.
