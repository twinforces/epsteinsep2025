1 Saturday the 18th. It is possible to have Ms. Maxwell present
2 and to make public access available on that weekend date. So

3 you can consider if you'd like to do that or not, given where

4 we are in the schedule. I'll leave it to counsel to consider

S it and confer. Alternatively, I suppose we could talk about

6 the charging conference on the 16th after we finish with the

7 jury. Any thoughts?

8 MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government has no preference
9 between those two dates and would be available for a December
10 18th conference. I think the timing would just depend on the
11 length and pace of the defense case. For example, if the

12 defense case were to begin on Friday, depending on how long

13 that defense case were to last, it may be that we might need to
14 have that conference earlier, but we don't have a sense of the
15 length of the defense case, and so it's hard for us to gauge

16 the timing.

17 MR. EVERDELL: May we confer, your Honor?

18 THE COURT: You may. Let me ask, does the government
19 anticipate -- I know it's a little hard to predict, but do you
20 predict resting potentially by Thursday such that --
21 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. It just depends on the
22 length of cross of the remaining witnesses, but I think it is
23 possible we will be resting on Thursday.
24 THE COURT: Okay.
25 MS. MOE: Thursday of this week.
