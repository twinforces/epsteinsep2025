following final judgment on the merits. In a criminal
case[,] the rule prohibits appellate review until convic-
tion and imposition of sentence.” Flanagan v. United
States, 465 U.S. 259, 263 (1984); accord United States
v. Aliotta, 199 F.3d 78, 81 (2d Cir. 1999). As the Su-
preme Court has “long held,” the “policy of Congress
embodied in this statute is inimical to piecemeal ap-
pellate review of trial court decisions which do not ter-
minate the litigation, and ... this policy is at its
strongest in the field of criminal law.” United States v.
Hollywood Motor Car Co., 458 U.S. 2638, 265 (1982); see
also Flanagan, 465 U.S. at 270 (noting “overriding pol-
icles against interlocutory review in criminal cases”
and that “exceptions to the final judgment rule in crim-
inal cases are rare”); United States v. Culbertson, 598
F.3d 40, 46 (2d Cir. 2010) (recognizing that “undue li-
tigiousness and leaden-footed administration of jus-
tice, the common consequences of piecemeal appellate
review, are particularly damaging to the conduct of
criminal cases’).

There is a limited exception to this rule that per-
mits immediate appeal from certain collateral orders.
See Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 467-
68 (1978) (citing Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan
Corp., 337 U.S. 541 (1949)). To fall within the “small
class” of decisions that constitute immediately appeal-
able collateral orders, the decision must “(1) conclu-
sively determine the disputed question, (2) resolve an
important issue completely separate from the merits
of the action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on ap-
peal from a final judgment.” Van Cauwenberghe, 486
U.S. at 522.
