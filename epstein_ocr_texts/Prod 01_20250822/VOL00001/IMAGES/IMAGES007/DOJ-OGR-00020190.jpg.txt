AVOCAT A LA COUR â€” ATTORNEY AT LAW
26. In these circumstances, it cannot have been the intention of French lawmakers that
Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure be construed as meaning that
a person who has lost French nationality would still be entitled to be protected from

countries individuals who had been deprived of their French nationality following the
commission of criminal offences.
