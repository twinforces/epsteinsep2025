1 Anything to take up?

2 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

3 I just wanted to report to the Court, we had a chance
4 to confer about those two issues. We've narrowed the scope of
a disagreement to just one issue after conferring with the

6 witness's counsel, which we'd like to raise at sidebar. I

7 don't know how soon that will come up, so I defer to defense

8 counsel whether to do that now or whether it would be more

9 efficient to bring the jury out and deal with that at a break.
10 There's a second issue to flag, but let me just pause
11 there on that to see.

12 THE COURT: Sure.

13 Is it anytime soon, Ms. Menninger?

14 MS. MENNINGER: I don't think so, but I don't have it
15 all memorized.

16 THE COURT: Understand. Let's hope we get to the

17 break and then we'll take it.

18 What else?

19 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
20 Defense counsel provided the government with a number
21 of exhibits, and we appreciated the chance to review those in
22 order to raise issues in advance. We just wanted to flag that
23 for two of those we anticipate there being a Rule 408
24 objection. Again, I don't know how quickly that will arise, so
25 I just wanted to alert that to the Court. We can take that up
