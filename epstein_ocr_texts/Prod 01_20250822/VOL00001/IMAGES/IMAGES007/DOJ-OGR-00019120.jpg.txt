1 for the charging conference makes sense and is feasible. And

2 in any event, I'll hear your motion at the close of the case.

3 It may mean -- so the result may be that the jury has
4 Friday in addition to Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, if

S everybody's comfortable with that. Yes. Okay.

6 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.

7 THE COURT: All right. That's helpful.

8 T'll let you know. Obviously if the charging

9 conference is Friday, I'll have to get you the charge before

10 Friday, which is possible. It may not be a lot before Friday.
11 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we're happy to accommodate
12 the Court's schedule on the charge. If you'd prefer to do it
13 Saturday, I just --

14 THE COURT: I don't have a preference. I just wanted
15 to make that available to the parties because it can be

16 difficult, I know, to review the charge as trial is proceeding.
17 So I'm not sure I have a preference. Go ahead.

18 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we're simply trying not to
19 waste the Friday. But, to be honest, the charge is obviously
20 very important and is going to require some careful review. So
2l we'll defer to the Court on what makes the most sense. But we
22 could do it on Friday if the Court wants to take advantage of
23 the day, but I think it would probably make more sense to do it
24 at a later day and we'll make ourselves available.
25 THE COURT: Okay.
