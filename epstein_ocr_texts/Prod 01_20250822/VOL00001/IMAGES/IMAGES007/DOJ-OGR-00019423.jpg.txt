Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page24 of 58

preserve the status quo and protect Ms. Maxwell’s right to litigate

Martindell and the Fifth Amendment in the criminal proceeding.

Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413, ECF Dkt. 69, p 33. Only by mischaracterizing Ms.
Maxwell’s argument can the government contend that she “seeks to have this
Court reach the merits of her arguments on [the Martzndell] issue in the context of
the czvel appeal, and before they have been properly litigated before and adjudicated
by the District Court in the criminal case.” See Doc. 37, p 17. Ms. Maxwell’s point
is that, unless the unsealing order is reversed, Ms. Maxwell likely won’t be able to
“properly litigate” the Martindell issue at all.

Nor is ¢hzs appeal the proper forum for deciding whether the government
improperly circumvented Martindell. All Ms. Maxwell seeks here is an order
allowing her to share with Judge Preska information that is essential to her decision
to unseal the deposition material and to rule on a motion to stay, information Judge
Preska did not know at the time and information the government insists should be
kept from her. And that issue—whether it is proper for one Article III judge, at the
request of the government, to keep secret from a co-equal judge information
relevant and material to the second judge’s role in deciding a matter before her —is
properly reviewed on an interlocutory basis because it is “an important issue
completely separate from the merits of the action.” W2ll, 546 U.S. at 349.
