‘Case 20-3061, Document 69; 09/28/2020, 2940206, Page6 of 15:

In Flanagan ». United States, the Supreme Court ruled that.an order
disqualifying criminal. counsel pretrial was not immediately appealable under the
collateral, order doctrine. 465 U.S.259, 266 (1984). The Court explained that unlike
an order denying a motion'to reduce bail, which, “becomes moot if review awaits
conviction and sentence,” an order disqualifying counsel is fully remediable
posttrial. Jd. Moreover, a motion to disqualify counsel is “not independent of the
issues to be tried” because. its “validity cannot be adequately reviewed until trial is
complete.” /d. at 268. Finally, unlike an appeal of a. bail decision, “an appéal of a
disqualification order interrupts the trial,” and any delay in.a criminal case “‘exacts
a presumptively prohibitive price.” Jd. at 269.

Unlike the disqualification order at issue in.Flanagan, the appeal. of Judge
Nathan’s order is like the appeal of an order denying a motion to reduce bail. First,
this appeal will “become[] moot if review awaits conviction and sentence.” See dd.
at 266. Unless Ms. Maxwell can share with Judge Preska what she learned from
Judge. Nathan, Judge Preska’s order unsealing the deposition material will go into
effect without Judge Preska’s getting the chance-to reconsider: her decision in light
of the new information. And once the deposition material is unsealed, the cat is
irretrievably out of the bag. That is precisely why this Court stayed Judge Preska’s

order pending appeal. Gzuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413 (2d Cir.), Doc. 30.
