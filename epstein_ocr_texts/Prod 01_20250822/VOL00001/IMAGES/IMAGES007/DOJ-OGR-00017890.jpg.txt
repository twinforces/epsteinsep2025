LC2VMAX2 Kane â€” Direct

1 follow-up.

2 Yesterday we heard from Jane. She disputed the

3 accuracy of some of the apolications that came in in terms of

4 the summer camp. She said that I recognize my mother's

5 handwriting, and she talked about her mother not being reliable
6 about other things. The government could have put on this

7 document through her if this information was reliable. They

8 chose not to. I don't think that there's a sufficient record

9 to put this on through 803(6).

10 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, I'm quite surprised defense
11 counsel is making this argument. There are several admissions
12 applications that are already in the record, including ones

13 offered by defense counsel. This particular document was used
14 in cross-examination of Jane yesterday and portions were read
15 into the record; so the rest of the document is something

16 that's fair game to come into the record.

17 Specifically about the business records exception,

18 police reports are accepted from the police records doctrine.
19 And this document otherwise needs to go in for comments of the
20 business record, both in the traditional classical sense of a
21 business record, but also, as the additional voir dire showed,
22 it's been integrated into the files of the school; the school
23 had relied on it in its business practices, which, at a
24 minimum, makes it an adoptive business record of the school.
25 THE COURT: Overruled.
