opening brief, Maxwell concedes that her appeal of the
Order does not concern one of the four types of pretrial
orders that the Supreme Court has identified as satis-
fying the collateral order doctrine in criminal cases,
but she fails to offer a basis for expanding those cate-

implicated by the Order—namely, the use of pretrial
discovery materials—do not justify expanding the lim-
ited collateral order exception, which is “interpreted

Maxwell relies principally on three cases in seeking
to overcome decades of Supreme Court precedent nar-

appeals in criminal cases be from the final judgment
of conviction. As discussed in the Government’s Motion
to Dismiss, the cases Maxwell cites do not support the
existence of an exception here. All three cases involved
appeals by intervenors—not parties—seeking to mod-
ify protective orders in civil cases. Pichler v. UNITE,
585 F.3d 741, 745-746 (3d Cir. 2009) (third party inter-
venor foundation appealing order denying motion to
modify protective order in civil litigation to allow third
party access to discovery materials); Minpeco S.A. v.
Conticommodity Servs., Inc., 832 F.2d 739, 741 (2d Cir.
1987) (Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(“CFTC”) acting as third party intervenor appealing

changed by parties to civil case permissible because
“(t]he entire controversy between the CFTC and the
