1 BY MS. STERNHEIM:

2 Q. I think you testified earlier you had approximately 10

3 meetings with the government in preparation for your testimony
4 here; correct?

5 A. Yes.

6 Q. And toward the end of those meetings, meaning not the end

7 of each meeting, but meaning the meetings closest to today, the
8 issue of your immigration status was raised, wasn't it?

9 A. Yes.
10 Q. And a request was made that the government look into
11 helping you with a U visa?
12 A. I asked that an inguiry be made.
13 Q. And at some point, if not today, but at least prior to
14 today, it was your interest in getting a U visa; correct?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. Because at some point, your other visa will no longer
17 survive; correct?
18 A. No.
19 Q. So the U visa would permit you to stay here; correct?
20 A. No, I'm saying no to what you said. So that's not the
al case.
22 Q. The exceptional visa just lasts forever?
23 A. No, but it's renewable and I have existed and I have stayed
24 here in status on those visas for the period of time that I've
25 been here. It's not problematic to renew them.
