Attorneys for Ghislaine Maxwell
Maxwell’s guards and a hand-held camera focused on both Ms. Maxwell and counsel. Further, confidential
attorney-client communications conducted during video teleconferencing (VTC) are now further compromised by
the repositioning of a camera with sensitive audio recording, putting a chill on privileged communication. During
VTC conferences, counsel can hear conversation among the guards, so it is likely that the guards, who seem to be
writing during those sessions, are able to hear discussions between Ms. Maxwell and counsel. Last night, prior to the
filing of defense replies to Ms. Maxwell’s pretrial motions, the MDC refused her request to speak with her lawyers
to provide information bearing on those filings,. Such denial violates the BOP’s Program Statement pertaining to
providing legal calls upon request of pretrial inmates. See https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/7331_ 004.pdf at
par. 24(c). The chronic difficulties related to Ms. Maxwell’s review of the millions of documents of electronic
discovery are continuing to negatively impact her ability to prepare for a trial that is only a few months away.
