LC1Qmax6 Jane —- Redirect

1 make objection to that, but I do object to the term girls, and
2 I do object to other aspects of his 3500 material insofar as

3 there was no testimony, and this witness should not be used to
4 supplant what the primary witness did not testify about.

a THE COURT: I agree with you on that distinction.

6 This witness can't testify as a prior consistent statement that
7 Jane told him that there were -- I mean, there's ambiguity in

8 the term, but I think since the witness couldn't testify if

9 they were underage or not, I can't allow the witness to make

10 that as an implication since that implication wouldn't be

11 consistent with the testimony.

12 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. I think on this point, to
13 be clear, the government doesn't intend to argue in closing

14 that the jury must infer from the evidence that there were

15 underage girls in the room because of Matt's testimony. I

16 think it is, unfortunately, common that often women above the
17 age of 18 are referred to as girls. That's how he remembers

18 it.

19 I would be happy to lead him through that testimony,
20 if the Court would prefer, and use the term females. It's not
21 our intention to elicit the testimony to suggest anything in
22 particular about the ages of those folks, but that's how he
23 remembers it, and that's the word he uses.
24 THE COURT: Why don't you —- I'll let you lead, but
25 why don't you just say other people, or something like that.
