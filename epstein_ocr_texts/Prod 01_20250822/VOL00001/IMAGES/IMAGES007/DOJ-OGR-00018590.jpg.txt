And I also would like to say with respect to 309, we
litigated whether or not we could put in evidence photographs,

of this witness, and the government called us, I think. it was

slut SHaming when I tried ‘to argué ‘that there were other
photographs of this individual that were much like this that
shé had. put out ‘in, néwspapers, and now they want to put on a
photo of her after she's gotten off the stand and not afforded
uS thé opportunity to Gross examine her about similar
photographs that she has put out.

MS. MOE: Your Ho6nor, I'm Surprised by all three of
those arguments.

THE GOURT: Let's Start with 332. Is the government's
representation, that the individual depicted, in, this photo is a,
minor at the time of the photos?

MS. MOE: Your Honor, we made no mepresentations about
the métadata of the file 6f this photo. To be shdért, in
dizect, I don't know. Thene will be testamony at. this trial
and there has. beén téestimdény at this trial that this person was
victimized as a minor.

In terms of the particular date 6f this photograph,
we're Limited by the information we have an the metadata. iL
believe it's for this reason that. the defense had noticed
perhaps a metadata expert, and the defense will be free to
explore that issue.
