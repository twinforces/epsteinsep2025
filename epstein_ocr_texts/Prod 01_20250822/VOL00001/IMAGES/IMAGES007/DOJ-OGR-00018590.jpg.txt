LC6Cmax7 Meder - direct

1 exists.

2 And I also would like to say with respect to 309, we

3 litigated whether or not we could put in evidence photographs

4 of this witness, and the government called us, I think it was

5 slut shaming when I tried to argue that there were other

6 photographs of this individual that were much like this that

7 she had put out in newspapers, and now they want to put ona

8 photo of her after she's gotten off the stand and not afforded
9 us the opportunity to cross examine her about similar

10 photographs that she has put out.

11 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I'm surprised by all three of

12 those arguments.

13 THE COURT: Let's start with 332. Is the government's
14 representation that the individual depicted in this photo is a
15 minor at the time of the photo?

16 MS. MOE: Your Honor, we made no representations about
17 the metadata of the file of this photo. To be short, in

18 direct, I don't know. There will be testimony at this trial

19 and there has been testimony at this trial that this person was
20 victimized as a minor.
21 In terms of the particular date of this photograph,
22 we're limited by the information we have in the metadata. I
23 believe it's for this reason that the defense had noticed
24 perhaps a metadata expert and the defense will be free to
25 explore that issue.
