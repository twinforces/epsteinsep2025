1. The Defendant’s Alleged Willingness to Renounce. Her Foreign. Citizenship
Should Not Alter the Court’s Prior Bail Determinations

The ‘defendant contends that she has:materially:strengthened her proposed, bail package’ by
offering to renounce her foreign, citizenship “if the: Court: so requires.” (Mot. at 2). She claims
that such a rénunciation will “climinate any. opportunity for her'to seck refuge” in. France and the
United Kingdom or “remove[] any incentive the. Court and g government believe she may have, to
seck refuge: in. those: countries.” id. at 2,5). The defendant is wrong. That she is “willing” to
renounce: her foreign, citizenship ‘would do-nothing to prevent'the defendant from fleecing and then,
fighting extradition once: abroad, and.it-does nothing to diminish the'risk.that;the defendant could,
choose to flee to another jurisdiction altogether; including one ‘with which. the United. States does
not have. an. extradition treaty’ and, from ‘which extradition. is impossible. ‘The Court previously’

found that the likelihood that the defendant “would be. able:to frustrate any extradition requests .

. weighs strongly i in favor of'detention” (Dec. Op. at.13); the defendant’s Motion provides no’ basis
to disturb this finding. Indecd, just as. the defendant’s offer to execute anticipatory. extradition,
‘waivers failed to provide the ‘Court with any’ assurance that she would not: frustrate any potential
extradition, so too should her offer'to, renounce her foreign citizenship.

First, the defendant’s willingness to renounce:her citizenship is an offer of unclear validity.
As.an initial matter, the defendant’s offer is itself of little value, as she would at. bare ‘minimum.
hhaye'to follow the legal requirements attendant to cach, country in, order'to formally renounce her:
citizenship. Moreover; she ‘provides no assurances—nor could she—that she will not contest the
validity and/or Voluntariticss of such. a:renuficiation onée she is actually:in France. or the United
Kingdom. For. ‘example, the Government understands that in order to give up onc’s British.
citizenship or'status, one must’be, among other things, “ofsound mind (unless it’s.decided that it’s
in. your best. interest).” Seewww. gov.uk/renounce-british-nationality.. The defendant could choose
to: frustrate any future extradition ‘proceedings by claiming that her decision to give up her
citizenship. was compelled. by some person, or citcumstance, or that she was not of sound mind.
Simply put, while: the. defendant: may belicve that it:is in her:interest to give-up her-citizenship now,
there is no: way for the defendant to assure the: Court.that ‘she will:not take the contrary position in,
the future ‘if she believes it to be in her interest at. the time. And even if the defendant could not.
challenge her ‘renunciation, it is unclear whether, as a separate matter; she could scek’ to have’ her:
citizenship rights restored.

Second, and related, the defendant has ‘offered:no authority for the proposition that-her. offer
to renounce forcign citizenship would have any. impact‘on an extradition proceeding, nor ‘has she
reckoned, with. the Court’s findings regarding her offer to sign.'a, so-called irrevocable waiver of
her extradition-rights. Sée United Statés.1., Cohen, No. 10 Cr. 547 (SI), 2010, WL 5387757, at *9

overseas at some’point—do not sufficiently assure the Court;that defendant is not still a flight risk.
Defendant offers;no authority about the ‘real impact.of these offers or whether they arc: enforceable
