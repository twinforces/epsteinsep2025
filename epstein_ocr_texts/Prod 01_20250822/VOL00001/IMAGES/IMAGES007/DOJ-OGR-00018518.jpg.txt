LC6Cmax5 McHugh â€”- cross

1 Now, this document -- and we can go to page 2 where

2 the transfers are. This document doesn't tell you who

3 orchestrated these transactions, does it?

4 MS. MOE: Objection to form.

5 THE COURT: Could you rephrase?

6 MR. EVERDELL: Sure.

7 Q. This document doesn't tell you who was the person who

8 actually initiated these wire transfers that we looked at --

9 I'll be even more specific.
10 On the transaction on June 18th, the money that's
11 going out of this account to the 4324 account, which is the Air
12 Ghislaine account, this document doesn't tell us who approved
13 that transaction; right?
14 A. Yes, does not.
15 Q. It does not?
16 A. Does not.
17 Q. It just says that the transaction occurred on that date for
18 that much money, it doesn't say who approved it?
19 A. Correct.
20 Q. So it doesn't tell you whether, for example, Ghislaine
al Maxwell approved that transaction herself; correct?
22 A. The statement does not.
23 Q. And, in fact, given our discussion before, anybody who had
24 proper authority over this account could have approved that
25 transaction; correct?
