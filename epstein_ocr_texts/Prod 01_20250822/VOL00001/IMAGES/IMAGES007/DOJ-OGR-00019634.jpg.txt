cant question of law... and... the presence of a legal
issue whose resolution will aid in the administration
of justice.” In re City of N.Y., 607 F.3d at 939.

As described below, the District Court did not
abuse its discretion in issuing the Order. This Court
should not issue a writ of mandamus and should in-
stead follow its “normal practice ... to decline to treat
improvident appeals as mandamus petitions.” Capar-
ros, 800 F.2d at 26. This case does not raise the rare
and exceptional circumstance in which the Court
should depart from its practice.

POINT II
The District Court Did Not Abuse Its
Discretion in Denying Maxwell’s Motion
to Modify the Protective Order

Even if this Court had jurisdiction to hear Max-
well’s appeal, the Order should be summarily affirmed
because the District Court did not abuse its discretion.
The Order—which was issued after receiving briefing

quest and reached a conclusion indisputably within
the bounds of permissible discretion.
