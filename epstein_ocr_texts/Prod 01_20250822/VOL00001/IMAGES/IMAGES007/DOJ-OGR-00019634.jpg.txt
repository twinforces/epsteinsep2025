issue whose resolution will aid in the administration
of justice.” In re City of N.Y., 607 F.3d at 939.

As described below, the District Court did not
abuse its discretion in issuing the Order. This Court
should not issue a writ of mandamus and should in-
stead follow its “normal practice ... to decline to treat
improvident appeals as mandamus petitions.” Capar-

and exceptional circumstance in which the Court
should depart from its practice.

Discretion in Denying Maxwell’s Motion

Even if this Court had jurisdiction to hear Max-
well’s appeal, the Order should be summarily affirmed

the bounds of permissible discretion.
