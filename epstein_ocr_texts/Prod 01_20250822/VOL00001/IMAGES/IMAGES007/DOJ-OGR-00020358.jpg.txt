In the face of the Epstein’s death on the BOP’s watch, the MDC would not risk a repeat
of the debacle that occurred in the MCC. There can be no doubt that the MDC was following
directives from Attorney General William Barr and the Director of the BOP in determining that
Ms. Maxwell should not be placed in general population, not Ms. Maxwell. Regardless, the
MDC would never risk security to Ms. Maxwell or the institution by placing her in general
population, knowing the difficulties it would face in protecting Ms. Maxwell from assault and
extortion by other inmates given that they do not protect her from physical abuse by guards. But
that decision does not justify the degree to which the MDC overmanages Ms. Maxwell’s
detention and its detrimental effect on her health, well-being, and ability to prepare for trial.

We have repeatedly expressed our concern for Ms. Maxwell’s health and the impact her
conditions of confinement are having on her health and well-being, her ability to prepare for
trial, and the overall impact the severe conditions will have on her stamina to withstand trial,
which we moved to the fall. With each passing day, it becomes increasingly more obvious that
Ms. Maxwell’s extreme conditions of detention will not be improved and health deteriorate
commensurate with the unprecedented conditions of confinement unparalleled in the MDC.

Very truly yours,
BOBBI C. STERNHEIM
