LC1VMAX3 Jane -â€” cross

1 recollection, she said it did not. Now I'm asking her if she

2 made the statement, and we haven't heard her answer yet.

3 THE COURT: So the question is did you make the

4 statement?

S MS. MENNINGER: Yes.

6 THE COURT: Okay. You may answer that.

7 A. No, I don't recall making these statements.

8 Q. Then you were asked the same question by the government in
9 the same interview a third time; correct?

10 A. I don't know.

11 Q. I'm going to ask you to take a look at page 11, the top

12 paragraph, the first sentence. Does that refresh your

13 recollection about you being asked a third time in the same

14 interview about abuse occurring in New Mexico?

15 A. No, it does not.

16 Q. Isn't it true what you told the government a third time was
17 that you were asked about the New Mexico trips you took and if
18 you recalled any specific abuse that occurred there, to which
19 you answered you did not remember; correct?
20 MS. MOE: Objection.
21 THE COURT: Sustained.
22 Q. It didn't refresh your recollection --
23 THE COURT: You said isn't it true that you told the
24 government a third time that you were asked about the New
25 Mexico trips. I think you lost the thread.
