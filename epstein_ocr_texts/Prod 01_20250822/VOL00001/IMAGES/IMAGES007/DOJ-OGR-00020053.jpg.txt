In addition, the discovery appears to show that, [  ]

[ the government did not issue subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until
after Epstein’s death. Although the discovery does not include the grand jury subpoenas.
themselves, the subpoena'returns appear to indicate that the government began issuing
subpoenas for Ms. Maxwell’s financial information on August 16, 2019, six days after
Epstein’s death, and issued additional subpoenas in the months that followed. The facts
strongly imply that government only chose to pursue a case against Ms., Maxwell—who was
not named in the Epstéeim indictment—because the main target, Jeffrey Epstein, had died in
their custody. The lack of corroboration in the discovery confirms that the case against Ms.
Maxwell was an afterthought and was reverse engineered based on allegations of 25-year-
old conduct from a small number of alleged victims.

Thus, notwithstanding the statement in the government's bail submission, we have
been provided with no meaningful documentary corroboration in this case. It appears that
the évidence in this case'boils down to witness testimony about events that allegedly took
place over 25 years ago. Far from creating a flight risk, the lack of corroboration only
reinforces Ms.. Maxwell's conviction that she has been falsely accused and stretigthens her
long-standing desire to face the allegations against her and clear her name in court. This

factor should weigh heavily in favor of granting Ms: Maxwell bail.
