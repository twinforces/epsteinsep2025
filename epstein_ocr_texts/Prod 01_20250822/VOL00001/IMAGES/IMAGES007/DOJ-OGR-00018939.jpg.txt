Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document.755 Filed 08/10/22 Page 77 of 262 1782

LE8Cmax3 Hesse - direct

to the biisihess records exception. They're free to argue about

the timeframes and what could be construed from them, but. the

question iS whether this is a bustiimess record, and based on the
testimony from now two witnesses and the organization of the
book itself, which shows that this is, a sequentially numbered
book that's bound, that was used as part of this employee's job
functions. That's all that the business records exception,

requires,

Again, on, thé timing, the issue is whether these
records were made at or near. IL'm not aware of any authority
that requires a foundation that a witness testify that they
personally made that, record, at the exact. moment a phone cat
camé ins That.'S not what the business records exception
requires. It's whether it's at or mean, whether it's part of

the générdl practice. If the requirement were that witnesses

come in and talk about the exact, moment they recorded something

every tiné, business records would hever be admitted in cdéurt.

That's not. what the rule requines.

THE COURT: I'm going to poke around at the law. If
anybody has a case, you may have noticed, I like cases.

MS. MOE: Yes, ydéur Honor.

THE COURT: I'll take a look during the remainder of
tHe break.

Can I keep these to look at them?

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor, of ‘course.
