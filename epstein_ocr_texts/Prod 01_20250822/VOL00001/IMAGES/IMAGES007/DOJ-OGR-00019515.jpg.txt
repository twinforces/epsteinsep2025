Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits. this letter with respect-to the protective order to be
entered in the above-captioned case, and to respond to the defendant’s Ictter and submission of
July 27, 2020: (the: “Defendant: Letter” or “Def. Ltr, ””).(Dkt. 29). The Government and defense
counsel have conferred régarding:a protective order'several times via telephone and email between
July 9, 2020, and today, including, as recently as this morning. The Government'and defense
counsel have come to an agreement..on much of'the ‘proposed protective order. However, the
partics disagree:as to two inclusions sought by’ the: defendant:which the Government objeets'to and
for, which, ‘as detailed herein, the Government submits ‘there is no legal basis. Accordingly, ‘the:
Government ‘respectfully requests that the Court enter its proposed ‘protective order (the
“Government Proposéd/Order”), whichis attached hereto as Exhibit.A, arid'which differs from.the
defendant’s proposed order in.those two. respects, as further described below.

with their significant privacy interests and the well-established. law ‘in-this Circuit, and proposes a
protective order consistent ‘with those very significant intcrests. In, contrast, the defendant insists
that the protective order’be modificd such that;she and.her counsel would be permitted, ‘to “publicly
referene[c]”* individuals, by name, who have‘spoken.on the public record to the media or‘in:public
fora, or in litigation — criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.”

! Specifically, the defendant’s‘proposcd protective order differs from the:Government’s:in that
it adds a sentence, in. its-:paragraph 6 (which is:paragraph’S of the Government Proposed. Order),
stating the following: “Nor does this Order prohibit. Defense Counsel from. publicly: referencing’
individuals who have spoken on.the record to the media:or in public fora, or in litigation — criminal.
‘er otherwise — relating to Jeffrey Epstein or Ghislaine Maxwell.” ‘The defendant, also cither adds
