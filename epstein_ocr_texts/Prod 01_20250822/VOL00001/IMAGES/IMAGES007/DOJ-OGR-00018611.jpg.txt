LE. 7VMAX1

Your Honor, With respect 'to any testimony ‘that was in
the November 26 disclosure, which I believe is not what was
disélosed é6arlier in September, but most of it is, what T 'wotild
agree is factual testimony.. If a document has metadata, any
old, person, Cah, right-click, on it, look, at ‘the properties, and
read what those properties are.

There's only oné portion of the ‘November 26 disclosure
that I believe treads int@ ‘opinion. expert land, and. that. is on

the second page of the November 26 disclosure where Mr. Flatley

will testify that he verified the accuracy ‘of metadata by
runhing a particular program. He will explain what metadata

Ls, such as the file name and when, the file was created, and

where it Gah be storéd in a Gdémputer system.

Your Honor, if those are ‘the only things ‘that
Mr, Flatley intends to6 testify about, then I think wé're fine.
It's the things that, came in the disclosures on November --

there were fiorée on November 26 that were fot in this letter and

there were things. on December 3rd that were disclosed. Jf he
1s limited to those things that were put in the Septémber 26
disclosure, I'm fine with that, your Honor.

He also was not ever disclosed as a fact or éxpert
witness with regard to CDs. The original notice and the
supplemental notice all refer to His review of déevicés;: So I
believe that the government does not intend to put on evidence
about CDs through him, but those are the two areas that I think
