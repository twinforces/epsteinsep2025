1 MS. COMEY: I'm sorry, your Honor, I didn't hear the

2 proposal.

3 THE COURT: Why not do it that way?

4 MS. COMEY: I didn't hear Mr. Pagliuca's proposal.

5 THE COURT: Why not deal with the admission, the offer
6 of 52 -- I mean, we don't need testimony on the subpages --

7 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, we're not offering the

8 entirety of 52. As I believe we mentioned to your Honor in

9 briefing, we're trying to narrow what we're offering from this
10 exhibit, and so we picked five pages that are particularly

11 relevant to the facts that are at issue in this case, and we

12 would only propose to show the jury those five pages, which is
13 why we're going through this process.

14 MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't have a problem with that, your
15 Honor, but I think what I would say is they would offer 52 and,
16 in essence, it's a redacted version of 52 that's going to the
17 jury. So the record will be clear that 52, if the Court is

18 going to allow it, is authenticated and admitted, and that it's
19 a redacted version of 52 is what's going to the jury.
20 THE COURT: That sounds exactly right.
21 MS. COMEY: That's fine, your Honor.
22 THE COURT: So it's 52A through what?
23 MS. COMEY: It's 52A, D, E, F, G and H.
24 THE COURT: So you will -- to the extent you have more
25 testimony to elicit for authentication, you're done, I presume
