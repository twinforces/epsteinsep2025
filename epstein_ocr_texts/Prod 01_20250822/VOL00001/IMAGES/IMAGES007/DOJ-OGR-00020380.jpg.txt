38. The only question even arguably before this Court at this juncture
is whether Judge Nathan committed clear error when detaining Maxwell as a flight
risk or abused her discretion when denying Maxwell temporary release. Nothing
in the renewed motion undermines Judge Nathan’s conclusion that Maxwell poses a
real risk of flight. Nor does the renewed motion explain how Judge Nathan’s
careful consideration of the MDC’s nighttime security protocols and continued
monitoring of Maxwell’s ability to access her discovery and communicate with
counsel transforms the denial of pretrial release into an abuse of discretion. Simply

reverse its prior decision in this case. Plugh, 648 F.3d at 123.

other things, Maxwell has exclusive access to both a desktop and a laptop computer
on which to review her discovery, thirteen hours per day, seven days per week. She
is also able to review discovery with her attorneys during the 25 hours of legal video-
teleconference calls she receives each week. (See Dkt. 196 at 1-2).
