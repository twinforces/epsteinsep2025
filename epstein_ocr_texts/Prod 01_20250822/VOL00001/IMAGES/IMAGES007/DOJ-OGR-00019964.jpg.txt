1 THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Moe.

2 Mr. Cohen, you may proceed.

3 MR. COHEN: Thank you, your Honor. Thank you very

4 much for the opportunity to be heard and also for accommodating
5 us with regard to the briefing schedule. We appreciate that,

6 your Honor.

7 Your Honor, this is a very important proceeding for my
8 client. It is critical and we submit, as we laid out in our

9 papers, that under the Bail Reform Act and related case law,

10 none of which, by the way, was discussed in the government's

11 presentation, she is -- she ought to be released on a bail

12 package with strict conditions, your Honor.

13 And, frankly, in order to defend a case like this

14 during the COVID crisis, with the extent of discovery which was
15 discussed earlier in the proceeding, that's going to take the
16 government until November to produce to us, the notion of

17 preparing a defense with our client while she is in custody

18 under these conditions is just not realistic.

19 I would also like to take a moment, your Honor, to
20 address a few things. As we noted in our papers, our client is
21 not Jeffrey Epstein, and she has been the target of essentially
22 endless media spin that apparently the government has picked up
23 in its reply brief and in its presentation today, trying to
24 portray her before the court as a ruthless, aimless, sinister
25 person.
