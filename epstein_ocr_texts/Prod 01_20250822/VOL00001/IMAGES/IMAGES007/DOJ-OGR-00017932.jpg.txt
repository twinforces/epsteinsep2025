LC2VMAX2 Rocchio â€” Direct

1 close to the perpetrator is very closely tied to adverse

2 outcomes and really can interfere with their ability to

3 identify that what's happening -- even realizing that what's

4 happening to them is abusive or is wrong.

iy Q. Dr. Rocchio, does the relationship of trust and attachment
6 between a victim and a perpetrator affect whether a victim

7 tells someone about the abuse?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. Can you explain how?
10 A. One of the things that we know when we look at when do
11 victims of childhood sexual abuse tell and who do they tell is
12 we know that they are less likely to tell and more likely to
13 have a delay in telling the closer the relationship to the
14 perpetrator.
15 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, are you
16 familiar with a concept called "delayed disclosure"?
17 A. I am.
18 Q. Can you explain for the jury what delayed disclosure is.
19 A. Delayed disclosure really just refers to when does someone
20 tell. So in the case of delayed disclosure in terms of child
21 sexual abuse, we would call disclosure telling delayed when it
22 happens at some point after the abuse has occurred.
23 Q. Does disclosure of childhood sexual abuse depend on the
24 victim's age?
25 A. Yes.
