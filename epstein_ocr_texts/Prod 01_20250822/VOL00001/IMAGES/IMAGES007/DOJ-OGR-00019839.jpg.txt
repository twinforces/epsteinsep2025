Case 21-58, Document 39-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page11 of 31
evidentiary hearing to test whether the government’s case even
marginally supports detention.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. The arrest and bail applications

Ghislaine Maxwell was arrested on July 2, 2020 and since that
date has been detained in jaw-droppingly appalling conditions. The
government claims that Ms. Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein’s “associate”
and helped him “groom” minors for sex back in the 1990s and early
2000s. Doc. 187. The indictment does not name these accusers and the
government has refused to disclose their names or the specific dates
that Ms. Maxwell supposedly did anything criminal.

After her arrest, the government moved for detention. Ex.A. The
defense responded. Ex.B. And the government replied. Ex.C. The trial
judge held the arraignment and bond hearing over Zoom. Ex.D. The
government did not call any of the accusers in the indictment or present
any witnesses related to flight, danger, or the strength of its case. The
government conceded that it was not asking for detention based on
danger to the community. The court ordered Ms. Maxwell detained at
the conclusion of the hearing. Ex.D.
