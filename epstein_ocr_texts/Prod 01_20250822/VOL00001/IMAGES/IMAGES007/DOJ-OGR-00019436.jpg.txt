Case 20-3061, Document 60, 09/24/2020, 2938278, Page37 of 58

Finally, re
And it shows that Judge Preska erred failing even to acknowledge or address Ms.
Maxwell’s reliance argument. Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 20-2413, OB, p 24. Ms.
Maxwell declined to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-
incrimination during her two depositions. She made that decision relying on the
civil protective order and this Court’s decision in Martindell, which holds that

absent a showing of improvidence in the grant of a Rule 26(c)

protective order or some extraordinary circumstance or compelling

need, none of which appear here, a witness should be entitled to rely

upon the enforceability of a protective order against any third parties,

including the Government, and that such an order should not be

vacated or modified merely to accommodate the Government’s desire

to inspect protected testimony for possible use in a criminal

investigation, either as evidence or as the subject of a possible perjury

charge.
