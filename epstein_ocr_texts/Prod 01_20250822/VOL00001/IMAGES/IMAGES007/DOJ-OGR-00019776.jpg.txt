regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,

consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application.SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
