LC8Cmax7 Rodgers â€”- cross

1 A. Yes.

2 Q. Without telling us the name, is that Epstein's assistant

3 that had the same first name as Jane's true first name?

4 A. Yes.

5 Q. And that person you're looking at in the photographs who

6 had the same name, she traveled frequently with Epstein on the
7 planes; isn't that right?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. Do you know if they had a romantic relationship together?
10 A. Yes.

11 Q. And she had a foreign accent, didn't she?

12 A. I'm not sure about that. Pretty good English.

13 Q. Her first name is actually spelled the same exact way as
14 Jane's first name; right?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. But she is not Jane; correct?

17 A. No.

18 MR. EVERDELL: You can put that way.

19 THE COURT: Jurors, you can put the folders away.
20 Q. I do want to look at some of those flights with Jane that
21 you looked at before. So if we could bring up Government
22 Exhibit 662R, which is redacted, and I'll ask Ms. Drescher to
23 help me, because I think she has the redacted copy. If we can
24 display page 44.
25 So do you see that in front of you, Mr. Rodgers?
