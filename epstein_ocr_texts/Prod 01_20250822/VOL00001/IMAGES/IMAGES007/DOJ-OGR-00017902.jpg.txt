S BY MS. POMERANTZ:

6 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain for the jury at a high level

7 what a forensic practice is.

8 A. So an attorney will hire me and they will ask me —- they'll
9 explain the issue that they need help with. It may be could I
10 come in and talk about a subject that is within my area of

11 expertise. It might be, for example, if somebody has claimed
12 that they've been harmed, say, through childhood sexual abuse,
13 they'll ask me to do an evaluation to determine whether or not
14 the individual has any problems or mental health issues; and if
15 they do, whether those problems and mental health issues are

16 attributable either in whole or part to the abuse that they've
17 alleged.

18 In a criminal case I might be asked to determine what,
19 if any, role an individual's mental health may have had or
20 their traumatic experiences may have had on the crime that they
21 are accused of. Or in sentencing issues I might be asked to do
22 a psychological evaluation and provide information that might
23 be relevant for purposes of sentencing.
24 Q. Approximately how many forensic evaluations have you
25 conducted?
