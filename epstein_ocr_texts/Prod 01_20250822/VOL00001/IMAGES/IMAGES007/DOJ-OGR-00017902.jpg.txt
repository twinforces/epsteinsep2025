BY MS. POMERANTZ:
Q. Dr. Roecchio, can you explain for the jury at a high level
A. So van attorney will hire me and they will ask me -- they'll
explain the issué ‘that they nééed help with. Tt may be coulda I
come in and talk about a subject that is within my area of

expertisé. It. might be, for example, if Soriébody has ¢laimed

that they've been harmed, say, through childhood sexual abuse,

they'll ask mé to do an evaluation to determine whether or hot

the individual, has any problems or mental health issues; and if

they do, whether those problems and mental health issues are
attributable either in, whole on part to the abuse ‘that they've
allegéd.

In ‘a criminal case I, might be asked to determine what,
if any, rolé dn individual's mental health may have had or
their traumatic experiences may have had on the crime ‘that they
are accused of’. OF in Sentencing issues I might be asked to do
a psychological evaluation, and provide information, that might
be rélevant for purposes 6f sentencing.
®. Approximately how many forensic evaluations have you
conducted?
