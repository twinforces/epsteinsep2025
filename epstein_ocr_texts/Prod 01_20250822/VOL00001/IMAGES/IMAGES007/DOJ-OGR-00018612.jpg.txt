LE. 7VMAX1

we're down, to, your Honor.
THE COURT: Okay.
MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, aS I think, our letter

indicated, we're quite surprised to receive the defendant's --

THE COURT: Mr. Rohrbach, lét's just get ‘to the issue.
Lt sounds. Like it's narrowed to two things. Every letter I
gét, it starts with, We're s6 surpriséd or this has already
been litigated, Let's just get to the issue.

MR. ROHRBACH: So, your Honor, Ti ‘think wé're in a
pretty good place then, Mr, Flatley is net going to go into
very much == we obviously don't know exactly what. Mr. Fldatley
will say on the stand, but the questions and what. we expect to
elicit shdéuld track the gévernment's November 26 letter. And
so it sounds like Lf defense counsel doesn't, have a problem.
with what's in this léttér, theh theré is no issue hére fdr the
Court.

I'm not exactly sure what Ms; Menninger is referencing
wath regard to CDs, but I think that. we expect Mr. Flatley to
give purely fact testimony regarding CDs, ahd there's no éxpért
opinion at all involved there. To the extent ‘that it's a late
disclosure of anything, it's just. a factual view of Mr. Flatley
that, is in, the 3900 material that. he may testafy to.

MS. MENNINGER: Your Hon6ér, 6n the CDs, apparently
Mr. Fldatley intends to testify that a created date is the same
thing as a modified, date. And also about once a file is burned
