Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 734-5 Filed 07/15/22 Page 12 of 17

On page 9 of the Claim Form, you must indicate which option you choose
under the "Proof of Legal Representation/Legal Authority to Act on Claimant's
Behalf" section, and when you upload the claim, this documentation must be
included in order to initiate the processing of the claim. If you choose to draft
a statement for your clients, please ensure that both the attorney and adult
Claimant sign that statement. This requirement is in addition to the
Claimant's initials on page 10.

14.Do I need an attorney to file a claim with the Program?
No, you do not need an attorney to file a claim with the Program. All
claimants and claims are treated with the same care, diligence, analysis and
attention regardless of whether or not the claimant is represented by an
attorney. The Program conducts proactive outreach with all unrepresented
Claimants to ensure that they are fully informed of the Program’s policies and
procedures, and to answer any questions they may have.

15.Can I add an attorney or change the attorney associated with my claim?
Yes. You may add an attorney or change your attorney at any time by
submitting a Change of Attorney form. Claimants should be aware, however,
that they are liable for any agreement related to attorneys’ fees as specified
in any prior attorney-client contract.

16. Will filing a claim cost money?
No. There is no fee associated with filing a claim with the Program. You may,
however, incur fees from professionals such as lawyers, should you choose to
engage their services. The Program will not pay for or reimburse you for such
fees.

17.Obtaining notarized documents is difficult (due _ to Claimant location or
COVID-19 restrictions). Are there any exceptions or alternatives allowed?
(added June 29, 2020)
We understand that, in some countries, notarizing a form can be costly or
otherwise prohibitive. For that reason, for individuals living in other
countries, we will accept notarization by a notarizing officer at a U.S.
Embassy or Consulate or an equivalent alternative document authentication
mechanism acceptable in that country. For Claimants having difficulty due
to the COVID-19 pandemic, most states have enacted statutes or Executive
Orders to allow alternatives, such as via video conference or fax. The
Program will accept any form of notarization that is acceptable by law in the
state in which the form is notarized.
