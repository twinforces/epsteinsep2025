iii. Inferred, Bias

While the category of cases if which bias. mist be implicd or presumed ts. limited to
“exceptional” or “extreme: situations,” ‘the district court retains diserction to dismiss a juror for
cause: when “a juror discloses a’ fact; that bespeaks.a,risk of partiality sufficicntly significant: to
warrant granting the trial. judge discretion to cxéuse:the juror for cause, but not so great as to. make
mandatory a, presumption of bias.” Zorres, 128 F.3d at 46-47. This doctrine of “inferred bias” is
“closely. linked” to the “traditional categories” of actual and implied bias, and a finding of'inferred
bias is permitted “only after having received responses from-the juror that permit an infcrence:that
the juror in, question would not. be able to decide the matter objectively.” Jd. at-47., “[A] finding
of inferred, bias 1s, by definition, within the discretion of the trial court.” Greer, 285 F.3d.at 172.
And, as with. actual bias, “a. district court’s. evaluation .of the juror’s. impartiality is accorded.
deference.” Jd.; see also id. (“There are few aspects of a jury trial:;where we would be less inclined.
to disturb.a trial judge's exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, thaii.in ruling on challenges for
cause in the empancelling of a jury.” (quoting United States v..Ploof, 464 F.2d.1.16, 118-19.n.4 (2d.
Cir. 1972))).

Here, the record refutes ‘any suggestion that, had Juror 50..disclosed a history of scxual
abuse, the Court would. have struck him based ona, finding of inferred bias. As sct forth above,
the record is clearthat:the Court would have in. fact.conducted.targcted follow-up questioning and,
absent some indication in such questioning ‘that. would have permitted an inference: of bias, the:
Court would ‘not have struck, him. See ‘Lorres, 128 F.3d. at 47 (finding of inferable ‘bias “‘must be
grounded :in facts developed.at:voir dire”).

Torres, upon which, the defendant: exclusively relics, is not to the contrary. In that case,

‘the district court-struck a juror for.cause where she had engaged.in, the structuring of:cash deposits,
