E. This Court should reject the government’s attempt to manufacture a
“Show Hearing’.

To read the government’s bricf, one would'think this Court-could hold.a meaningful
hearing’ at:whichit-(and not'the’ parties) would ‘pose two softball questions, of Juror No. 50: were
your false: answers to’ Questions 25; and.48 ‘merely inadvertent; and, even though you were.a
you have admitted using your own experience. to convince: 10 other jurors to convict Ms.
Maxwell)? The government.implics that.an affirmative to cither question would .cnd the hearing.
Not so:

1. The lawyers should conduct the questioning.

First, ‘the. parties should be-permitted to question Juror No. 50, as. occurred recently in this.
judicial, district.” United States:y, Stewart, 433 F.3d.273, 306 (2d Cir, 2006) ("We therefore
caution district courts that, if'any significant doubt as to:a juror’s impartiality remains in the
wake of objective evidence of'false voir dire responses, an evidentiary hearing generally should
beheld. Such a hearing is often the most reliable way for discerning the true ‘motivations behind

a juror’s false replics.") (citations omitted).

* A] showtrial can be defined by the presence: of two elements. ‘The first:clement is
‘increased probability. of the defendant’s conviction resulting from the planning and control. of the
‘trial. The second element is a focus on the audience: outside of the courtroom rather than.on the
accuscd—the extent to ‘which. the trial is designed or managed forthe benefit. of external
observers. rather than for. securing justice: forthe: defendant.” Jeremy Peterson, Unpacking Show
Trials: Situating the Trial of Saddam Hussein, 48 Harv: Int?lL.J..257, 260 (2007); see also
Purvis v. Ocst, 614 F.3d ‘713,718 (7th,Cir. 2010) (“fundamentally biased, process is

not due process”): Schacht v. Wis. Dep’t-of Gorr., 175 F.3d,497, 503 (7th Cir. 1999) (“sham,
‘procedures do, not satisfy:due process”).
