answers to Questions 25 and 48 are reason enough to order a new trial because they relate
to the core allegations against Ms. Maxwell. Moreover, if this Court orders an evidentiary
hearing, it is likely additional false answers will come to light, further supporting the
conclusion that Ms. Maxwell is entitled to a new trial.

In State v. Ashfar, the defendant was convicted of aggravated sexual assault based
on the allegation that he touched the genitals of his 12-year-old client during a therapy
session. 196 A.3d 93, 94 (N.H. 2018).'? The empaneled jury, however, included an
individual who had been sexually assaulted by a babysitter when he was five or six years
old. Jd. at 95. The juror had not disclosed this during voir dire and had, instead, answered
“no” when asked if “[he] or a close member of your family or a close friend ever been a
victim of a crime?” Jd. at 95. The trial court ordered a new trial, relying both on the
juror’s false answer during voir dire but also his post-verdict conduct, which included
communications with a female victim of sexual assault who wrote a book on the subject
and the juror’s self-identification as “an advocate for people.” Jd. at 96. The New
Hampshire Supreme Court affirmed.

at issue in the criminal case. Juror No. 50’s experience as a sexual assault victim “raise[s |

involving sexual assault, state court decisions are particularly helpful. The New
Hampshire Supreme Court “assum[ed] without deciding that McDonough provides the
applicable analytical framework” and concluded that the trial court “sustainably exercised
its discretion in finding the juror “was not impartial.” 196 A.3d at 97.
