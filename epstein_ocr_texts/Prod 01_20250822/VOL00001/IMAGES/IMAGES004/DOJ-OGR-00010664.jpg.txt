Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

I am counsel for Annie Farmer, and I am providing the following victim impact statement
for the Court’s consideration with respect to Maxwell’s sentencing.

Pursuant to the Crimes Victims’ Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771, Ms. Annie Farmer
qualifies as a victim and was a testifying witness during the trial. Ms. Farmer thus requests the
Court’s permission to make an oral statement at the sentencing.

Statement by Annie Farmer:
Judge Nathan,

For a long time, I wanted to erase from my mind the crimes that Ghislaine Maxwell and
Jeffrey Epstein committed against me and pretend they hadn’t happened. Beyond my initial
description to my boyfriend and family of what occurred when I was with them in New Mexico, I
didn’t talk about it for years. It was the type of dark memory that feels safest to keep locked away,
and so I did the best I could.

The world did not cooperate with this strategy, however. Something would bring to mind
this experience and my body would respond with an upset stomach and physical shakiness. I’d feel
irritable, have trouble focusing, and feel disoriented. In recent years, I have been asked repeatedly
to describe these crimes to law enforcement and the media, and I have learned heartbreaking details
about the ways Maxwell and Epstein abused and exploited so many others. Focusing on these
experiences that I tried so hard to avoid thinking about has forced me to acknowledge the many
ripple effects of their crimes for myself and my family and the continued impact of these long-ago
events on my life.

One of the most painful and ongoing impacts of Maxwell and Epstein’s abuse was a loss
of trust in myself, my perceptions, and my instincts. When predators groom and then abuse or
exploit children and other vulnerable people, they are, in a sense, training them to distrust
