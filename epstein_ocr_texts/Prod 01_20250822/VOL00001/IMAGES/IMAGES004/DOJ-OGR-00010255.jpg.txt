M3 8YMAX2

1 (In open court)

2 THE COURT: All right. I do have some additional

i) questions, Juror 50.

4 BY THE COURT:

5 Q. I asked you whether you approached filling out the

6 questionnaire with diligence.

7 Can you recall that?

8 A. Yes, your Honor.

9 Q. And you indicated no and you wish you had and that sort of
10 thing. And I asked you whether you took my instructions
11 carefully in the questionnaire.
12 Do you remember that?
13 A. Yes, your Honor.
14 Q. And your answer is no? Is that accurate?
15 A. Yes, your Honor.
16 Q. And to make sure I understand, why is that? Why didn't you
17 take my instructions carefully?
18 A. It was definitely inadvertent. Again, like I said, I began
19 to float, fly through it, in order to get done. I was super
20 distracted, and it just -- I don't know what happened. I just
21 wanted to get done with it.
22 Q. When you came back on November 16 for the follow-up
23 questions, there was another instruction video.
24 Do you recall that?
25 A. Yes, your Honor.
