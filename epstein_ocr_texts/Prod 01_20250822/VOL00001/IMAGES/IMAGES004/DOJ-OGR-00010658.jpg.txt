Attn: AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe & Alex Rossmiller
Re: United States v. Maxwell
Dear Counsel:
We are attorneys for Alan Dershowitz (“Professor Dershowitz”) in the civil matter of
Virginia Giuffre v. Alan Dershowitz pending before Hon. Loretta Preska in the Southern District
of New York. Virginia Giuffre’s (“Ms. Giuffre”) lack of credibility, and actual conduct in
recruiting young girls for Jeffrey Epstein, are critical issues in the above-mentioned litigation.
We write to notify you that Ms. Giuffre gave approximately nine hours of deposition
testimony across the span of two days on April 13th and 14th, 2022, in Washington, D.C. Her
lawyers have designated the entire transcript to date as confidential under the applicable protective
order.
Our efforts to have the transcripts unsealed and made public have been denied by Judge
Preska. Also denied was our request to provide the transcript to your office so that you could
determine, on an informed basis, whether it would be appropriate or ethical for you to allow Ms.
Giuffre to give a victim impact statement during the sentencing phase of the Ghislaine Maxwell
trial and therein vouch in that proceeding for her credibility.
Both the Court, and Ms. Giuffre’s counsel, have made clear that they agree that we may
notify you of the existence of the transcripts so that you can have the opportunity to review her
testimony before she is allowed to provide a victim impact statement at the upcoming sentencing
of Ghislaine Maxwell. We urge you, respectfully, to require her to produce it to you for your
