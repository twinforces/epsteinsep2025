To this day, he “tailgates” with friends before Michigan football games and donates generously
to the school. See letter of Kenneth Norwick (our “tailgate [group] ... has become like an
extended family . . . focused on the children”); letter of Bridget Rodgers (“[e]ven though he has
never mentioned it, I know [David] has been a generous donor to the University”).
B. Business Degree and Brokerage Industry Employment

After graduating from Michigan, David worked two years at Touche Ross as an
accountant, doing audits for local businesses and not-for-profit institutions. In August 1986, he
left the firm and reenrolled in Michigan to get an MBA degree, Again, he paid his own way. He
lived at home, commuted to school, and went back to waiting tables. He graduated in 1988 with
a major in Finance and Economics and obtained employment at Goldman Sachs in Detroit as a
broker.

From 1988 to his indictment in 2009, David enjoyed considerable success as an
investment consultant for institutions and high net worth individuals. When Goldman left
Detroit, David moved to Kidder Peabody in Troy, Michigan, and then to Credit Suisse First
Boston in Chicago. In 1995, he was recruited to join Alex Brown & Sons, which was
subsequently acquired by Bankers Trust and then Deutsche Bank. The name on the front door
changed, but David's responsibilities did not.
