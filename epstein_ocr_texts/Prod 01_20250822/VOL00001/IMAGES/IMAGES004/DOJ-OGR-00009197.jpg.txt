response would, have provided a valid basis for'a challenge for cause”). That’s because, as the
Supreme Court held ‘in Waited Statés'v. Martine=-Saldzar, “the séating of any juror who, should
have: been dismissed for. cause . . . require[s] reversal.” 528 U.S. at 316. Thus, irrespective of.
whether Juror No. ‘50 deliberately provided false answers to Questions No. 25 ‘and 48 (though the.
record shows heé-did), his preserice onthe jury requires reversal :if he was impliedly, inferably, or
actually’ biased.

Second, the government misunderstands this Court’s role during' any. evidentiary: hearing.
‘Ours isan adversarial system, not an. inquisitorial system. Ms. Maxwell has:a right to present her
arguments to the Court, to call material witnesses ‘in support of those arguments, and to confront.
and cross-examine those ‘witnesses. The government’s request for a narrow and limited. hearing

‘contravene the tradition and ‘precedent of this judicial district. See, e.g., EXHIBIT 3, United States
‘vi. Datigerdas, Case No. 09 Cr. 581, (Hon. William, H. Pauly II] (Trans. of Motion for New
Trial). Asthe government itselfargued. in.Daugerdas, a juror who “conceal[ed] personal
background ‘material ‘so analogous to the case on trial" had."bias [] implied as a matter of law”
and the affected. defendant therefore would be entitled to a new'trial. Doc. 487, p 2.1, Waited
States v..Daugerdas,.No. 1:09-cr-00581-DLC, Sept. 9, 2011.1. ‘This is just:such.a. case.

The government’s response'to Ms. Maxwell’s motion. for a new trial.clides:the stakes.
involved and the significance of the constitutional, right at issuc. Ms. Maxwell, was on trial ‘for
her life. That trial required 12 fair and impartial jurors. While:paying lip service to the

requirement of a fair trial, the government incants the ‘words “finality” and “disfavor” as a basis
