Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document600_ Filed 02/11/22 Page 18 of 37
was travel “from Florida to New York, New York,” despite the defense’s request to include that
language. Dkt. 410-1 at 19; Tr. 2758:23-2760:9.

The evidence at trial concerning Count Four rested exclusively on the testimony of Jane
and evidence that corroborated her testimony. Jane testified primarily about being sexually
abused by Epstein in Epstein’s house in Palm Beach. Tr. 298:16-315:19. Jane also testified that
she traveled several times with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell when she was 14, 15 and 16 and was
sexually abused in Epstein’s residences in New York and New Mexico. Tr. 316:2-324:20. As
most of these trips were to New York, the majority of Jane’s testimony about the trips consisted
of a description of Epstein’s house in New York and the sexual abuse she experienced there. Tr.
317:2-321:5. But Jane did recall one trip to New Mexico when she was “15 or 16.” Tr. 321:6-
321:13. Jane testified that she flew to New Mexico with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell and stayed at
Epstein’s ranch. Tr. 321:14-322:6. She further testified that, at some point while she was there,
someone came to her room and escorted her to Epstein’s room where she was sexually abused.
Tr. 322:7-323:19.

Based on this testimony and the text of the Jury Note, there is a substantial likelihood that
the jury did not convict Ms. Maxwell based on Jane’s testimony about the New York trips, and
instead improperly based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced in
New Mexico. According to the Jury Note, the jurors had the mistaken impression that it would
be sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four if they found that Ms. Maxwell had
intended Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, even though such conduct was not and
could not have been “sexual activity in violation of New York Penal Law, Section 130.55”:

Under Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return

flight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage

in sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?
