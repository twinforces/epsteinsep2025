language. Dkt. 410-1 at 19; Tr. 2758:23-2760:9.

The evidence at trial. concerning Count Four rested. exclusively on-the testimony of Jane
and cvidence'that; corroborated her'testimony. Jane‘testified primarily about; being sexually
abused by Epstein in Epstein’s house in Palm.Beach. Tr. 298:16-315:19. Jane alsotestificd that
she traveled several times with Epstcin and Ms. Maxwell’when. she'was 14, 15 and 16 and was
sexually abused in Epstein’s, residences ‘in New: York:and New’Mexico. Tr. 3:'16:2-324:20. .As
most of:these trips. were to New York, the majority of Jane’s testimony about the trips consisted
of a description of Epstein’s house ‘in’New York and the sexual abuse she experienced there. Tr.
3.17:2-321:5. But Jane did recall one trip to, New Mexico, when she was “1S or 16.” Tr. .32:1:6-
321:13. Jane testified:that. she flew to.New Mexico with Epstein.and Ms. Maxwell and. stayed at
Epstein’s ranch. Tr. 321:.14-322:6. She further'testified that, at some point while she was there,
someone came, to her room, and escorted her to -Epstcin’s room where. she'was sexually abused.

Based. on. this testimony and the text of the Jury’Note, there is a substantial likclihood that
the jury: did not convict Ms. Maxwell based on.Janc’s testimony about.the: New York:trips, and
‘instead. improperly based:their conviction solcly on, the sexual, abuse that Jane experienced. in
New’ Mexico. According to the Jury Note, the jurors had. the mistaken impression that. it would
be:sufficicnt.to satisfy the :sccond clement of:Count Four if they found.that Ms.:Maxwell had.
intended Jane to engage: in sexual, activity in. New. Mexico, even, though such, conduct was not and.

Under Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation. of Jane’s.return
flight, ‘but not, the flight to New: Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage
in sexual activity, can. she be found guilty ‘under the second element?
