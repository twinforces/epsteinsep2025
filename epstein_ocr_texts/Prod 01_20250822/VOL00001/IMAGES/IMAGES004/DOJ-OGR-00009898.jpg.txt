ability to establish that yet a second juror was biased by having been a victim of the very type of
crime at issue in this trial. The cases relied on by the government are inapposite as none reach
the issue of whether a juror was dishonest in response to voir dire questions regarding whether
they had been the victim of the same type of crime at issue. See Resp. at 38-39. Importantly, the
government cites only to cases where the only evidence that a juror had engaged in misconduct
was a news article to that effect. Here, there are two pieces of evidence: one, the New York
Times article, and two, Juror No. 50’s media statement that a second juror disclosed that they
were also a victim of childhood sexual abuse. Where there is "clear, strong, substantial and
incontrovertible evidence" of juror misconduct, a hearing on that issue is required. United States
v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 302-03 (2d Cir. 2006).

The government paints a parade of horrors to try to dissuade the Court from pursuing this
second clear instance of a juror’s inaccurate voir dire statement on a critical issue in this case.
Resp. at 37. Yet simply asking the other 11 jurors one question, whether they were the victim of
childhood sexual abuse is not the intrusion the government suggests; the juror apparently felt
comfortable sharing that information both during deliberations and also to the New York Times.

4. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to Discovery

The government cites no authority for its request to foreclose discovery in advance of the
hearing, nor could they given that such discovery is often necessary to establish the very
misconduct at issue. The government’s complaints center on their view that the requested
discovery is either overbroad or violative of Rule 606(b). The government intentionally mis-
reads the defendant’s request. Obviously, Ms. Maxwell would be requesting communications
that occurred outside of deliberations. It is also surprising that the government thinks that there
will be a "high volume" of social media material during the "relevant time frame," 1.e., between
when Juror No. 50 stated he had closed all of his accounts (a week before trial) and his
