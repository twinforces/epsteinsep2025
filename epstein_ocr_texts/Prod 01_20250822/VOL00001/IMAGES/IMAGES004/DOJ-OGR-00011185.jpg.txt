Tr. at 21 (“Mr. Flatley was disclosed by the government for similar purposes to talk about the
retrieval of metadata from some of the devices that were seized from Epstein’s home.”’). In any
event, the Government made that both explicit and highly specific in the November 26 letter, three
days after the defendant expressed concerns about notice. The November 26 letter identifies the
precise exhibits about which Flatley will testify, including the exhibits that display metadata fields

ample time to prepare any cross-examination on metadata. Thus, to the extent the Court has any
doubt as to whether Flatley’s testimony constitutes expert opinion, the Government would seek to
qualify him as an expert on the relevant subjects.

Second, the remainder of Flatley’s expected testimony stated in the November 26 letter is
clearly fact testimony. As the letter explains, Flatley will testify that he examined Government
Exhibits 54 and 55 and determined that particular other Government exhibits were stored there.

no such thing:

e The primary defense concern appears to be about the statement, reflected in the 3500
material, that Flatley examined metadata to determine the number of times the “ghislaine” user
account accessed Government Exhibit 54, as reflected in the notes for December 2. This is not
