Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document616- Filed 02/24/22 Page 20 of 32

Question 48 was not confusing or complicated and, again, there is no credible
explanation for why the victim of a sexual assault, in a case about sexual assault, would not have
taken a long look at that question. The claim that he just “missed it” or “forgot” or “didn’t
understand” is after-the-fact, self-serving, nonsense, the type of nonsense repeatedly rejected by
courts, not to mention the government, when addressing material omissions or false oaths by
omission.

For example, in bankruptcy proceedings the failure to truthfully answer questions about
assets or ownership interests regularly leads the government to move to dismiss the debtor’s
petition. Not surprisingly, debtors often claim confusion, mistake, or inadvertence as the reason
for the false answer. However, success of a bankruptcy program (like jury trials) “hangs heavily
on the veracity of statements made by the bankrupt’”—or here, the prospective jurors. See Diorio
v. Kreisler-Borg Const. Co., 407 F.2d 1330, 1330-31 (2d Cir. 1969). See also United States v.
Stone, 282 F.2d 547, 553 (2d Cir. 1960) (the purpose of a debtor filling out a detailed financial
disclosure (SOFA) “is to give dependable information without need of going further”). When a
false-oath-giver claims carelessness as the reason for the untruthful statement, courts are
skeptical because in a system that relies on a person’s word, the answers “must be regarded as
serious business; reckless indifference to the truth, is the equivalent of fraud.” Diorio, 407 F.2d
at 1330-31.

In a case like this one, which charges the defendant with perjury, it’s ironic the lengths to
which the government has gone to excuse Juror No. 50’s false answers as nothing but an
innocent mistake, an indulgence the government is unwilling to afford Ms. Maxwell.
