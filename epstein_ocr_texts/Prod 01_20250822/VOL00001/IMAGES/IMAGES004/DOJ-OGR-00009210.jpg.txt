Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 616 Filed 02/24/22 Page 20 of 32

Question 48 was not, confusing or complicated and, again, there is ‘no ercdible
explanation for why the victim of a sexual assault, in a case: about sexual assault, would not.have
taken a. long look at that question. The:claim that he just “missed it” or “forgot” or “didn’t
understand” is. after-the-fact, sclf-serving, nonsense, the type of nonsense repeatedly rejeeted by
courts, fot to mention:the government, when addressing material omissions. of false oaths. by

For example, in bankruptey’procecdings the failure to truthfully answer questions about:
asscts or ownership interests regularly leads: the government to move:to dismiss the: debtor’s,
petition. Not:surprisingly, debtors often claim confusion, mistake, or inadvertence’ as the reason
for the false: answer. However, success of a bankruptcy program (like jury trials) “hangs heavily
‘on the veracity of. statements made: by the bankrupt”—or here, the prospective jurors. See Diorio
vi, Kreisler-Borg Const. Co., 407 F.2d 1330, 1330-31, (2d Cir, 1969). See also United States v:
Stone, 282 F.2d 547, 553 (2d Cir. 1960) (the purpose of a debtor filling out a detailed financial
disclosure (SOFA) “is to give dependable information without need ‘of going further”). When a.
false-oath=giver'claims carclessness.as the reason for the ‘untruthful statement, courts, are
skeptical because ‘in a system that relics on a person’s word, the answers: “must be regarded as
‘serious business; reckless. indifference to the truth, is the cquivalent of fraud.” Diorio, 407 F.2d.
at 1330-31.

In.a case like this one, which charges the defendant with: perjury, it’s ironic the: lengths to
which the government has gone to excuse Juror No..50’s false answers as'‘nothing but an

innocent mistake, an:indulgence the government is‘unwilling to afford-Ms. Maxwell.
