Dear Judge Nathan,

| write this letter in support of my sister, Ghislaine, aware of the charges she was
been found guilty of, noting too that she has no prior criminal convictions in any jurisdiction.

| have known Ghislaine for over 60 years and have formed a settled view of her good
character based on our growing up together and continuing to remain close to this day. |
respect her enormously for her generous (often anonymous) donations to charities and
her valuable contributions to non-profit and other organizations; for her many personal
achievements which have included obtaining her helicopter licence, becoming a banker, an

EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) and a submersible pilot, as well as for the courage
she has shown in the face of close on two years of intolerable conditions of incarceration,
for her stoicism and indeed humility under such trying circumstances which have witnessed
so many setbacks for her. For all this and many other reasons besides | hold her high in my
affections and shall certainly continue to do so.

My sister is Aunt to 13 nieces and nephews (now aged 18 to 37) and | have witnessed at
first hand over the years her generosity to them â€” be it paying their school fees, mentoring
them as they grew up or providing job opportunities for them. She also has an enduring
capacity for friendship, a warm heart, and the ability to convert those feelings into action
when required to help those less fortunate than herself. She has discreetly supported some
friends financially and others by providing a roof over their heads when they were down on
their luck, often for weeks at a time. Ghislaine has also been a truly supportive sister.
During my divorce from my then wife my sister allowed me stay rent-free at her home in
London for six months when | had nowhere else to go until | was able to find alternative
