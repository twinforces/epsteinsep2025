ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

Per the Court’s instruction at the March 8 hearing, the parties submitted revised
redactions to their briefing on the Defendant’s motion for a new trial. The Court rejects the
Defendant’s proposed redaction to page 8, lines 6-7 of her reply because it is not necessary to
protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity and privacy. See Dkt. No. 607. The Court
concludes that the remaining proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to further the important
interest of protecting juror anonymity and privacy. Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal.,
Riverside Cnty., 464 U.S. 501, 511-12 (1984). The parties are ORDERED to file the redacted
briefs (with the above noted line unredacted) on the docket on or before March 11, 2022. The
Court will file the unredacted briefs under seal.

SO ORDERED.
