f In Gall v, United States, 552 U.S. 38 (2007), the Supreme Court emphasized that a non-
incarcerative sentence does not mean “letting an offender off easily.” The Court wrote:
_ We recognize that custodial sentences are qualitatively more
severe than probationary sentences of equivalent terms. Offenders
on probation are nonetheless subject to several standard conditions
that substantially restrict their liberty. Probationers may not leave
the judicial district, move, or change jobs without notifying, and in
some cases receiving permission from, their probation officer or
the court. They must report regularly to their probation officer,
permit unannounced visits to their homes, refrain from associating
with any person convicted of a felony, and refrain from excessive
drinking. Most probationers are also subject to individual “special
conditions” imposed by the court.
Id. at 59.
