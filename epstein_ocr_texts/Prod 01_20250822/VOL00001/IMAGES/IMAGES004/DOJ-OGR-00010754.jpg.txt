Re: United States v..Maxwell, No. 20-cr-00330 (AJN) — Unsealing of
Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial and Questionnaires of Seated
Jurors.

Dear Judge’ Nathan:

I write on behalf of The New York Times Company (“The Times”) to
request that the Court unseal (a) Defendant’s Motion. for a New Trial and
accompanying brief and exhibits (Dkt.. 580) and (b) the filled-out:
questionnaires, for the twelve seated jurors. These records ‘are subject to
both First Amendment and commion.law rights. of'accéss, ‘which. set
stringent standards for sealing.! We ask that the Court unseal them, with.
only those:redactions necessary to protect the identities of jurors, to the
extent they. have'not already been.disclosed.. We also ask that'this Court
make clear that any subsequent briefs.and exhibits.filed ‘in conjunction
with this motion should not'be filed under seal and‘with only those.
redactions necessary. to-protect jurors’ identities.

As the Court knows, both sets of sealed records bear on allegations of
juror misconduct. On January 5, 2022, the parties wrote to this Court
regarding public statements:made by ‘one juror; identified ‘as “Juror 50,”
about how his jury room disclosure that he'was.a victim. of sexual assault

' The tight of access is.an affitmativé enforceable public right, and it is:well-
established that the press has standing’ to:enforce this right. See, e.g., Globe
Newspaper ‘Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk City,.457 U.S. 596, 609 n.25 (1982);
Hartford Courant Co. v. Pellegrino, 380 F.3d 83, 91 (2d Cir. 2004).
