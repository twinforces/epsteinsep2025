original). “The ultimate test,on a ‘Rule 33 motion. is whether letting a guilty verdict stand would
bea manifest injustice.” Fergisdén, 246 F.3d, at 134.

Courts strongly disfavor post-verdict inquirics into juror conduct. As the Supreme Court
explained: “Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inattentiveness, raised, for'the first:
time... . after the verdict, scriously disrupt the finality ofthe process. Moréover, full arid. frank:
discussion. in, ‘the jury’ room, jurors’ ‘willingness: to return an, unpopular verdict, and the

community’s, trust: in.a system that- relies, on the decisions of laypeople would all be: undermined
by: a barrage of'post-verdict scrutiny of ‘juror conduct.” Lanner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107,
120-21 (1987), (citations omitted). The Second Circuit has cautioned that. “post-verdict inquiries

challenge the juror ‘for cause?” Shaoul, 41, F.3dat 816 (emphasis in original). The first prong
requires a deliberate misconduct, not an honest mistake. See id.; see also, Part ll.B. La, infra. The
second prong'requires the Court:to determine whether, ifthe juror had answered truthfully; it would.

have granted a hypothctical strike forcause. See United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 304 (2d.
