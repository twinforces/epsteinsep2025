States v. Dorvee, 616 F.3d 174, 182 (2d Cir. 2010)(“it is the sentencing court’s duty to impose a
sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the specific purposes set forth
at 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)”).

David’s mother worked part-time as a laundress in a local restaurant. The two parents instilled
