1 AFTERNOON SESSION

2 (In open court)

3 (Jury not present)

4 THE COURT: Any matters to take up?

a) MS. POMERANTZ: Not from the government. Thank you,

6 your Honor.

7 MS. STERNHEIM: No, thank you.

8 THE COURT: Okay. We can bring in the jury.

9 Ms. Pomerantz, you're welcome to get situated in the
10 podium.

11 MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor.

12 THE COURT: Just as a note while we're waiting,

13 learned from the DE we have many overflow courtrooms up and

14 running. We've accommodated everyone who has sought to observe
15 trial in those overflow rooms, and apparently still have space
16 for others. So my thanks to the district executive's office

17 and the clerk's office for facilitating that public access.
