her motion, that these counts are “virtually identical.” (Def. Mot. at,22). But charges that cover
different schemes under different statutes are ‘not “virtually identical?” The: Court should, reject.
this argument.

A. Applicable Law:

The Double Jeopardy Clause. of the Fifth Amendment-to. the Constitution “protects against
multiple punishments for the same-offense.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 71), 717 (1.969).
Accordingly, a defendant. cannot be sentenced for multiplicitous charges covering the same crime.
“An indictment is multiplicitous when it:charges a single offense as an. offense: multiple times, in.
separate counts, when, in law and fact, only. one crime‘has been committed:” United States vy.

on more than one:multiplicitous count, the defendant's right notto suffer.multiple punishments for
the same offense will be ‘protected by having the court. center judgment. on. only one of the
multiplicitous counts.” Jd. Similarly, where the judgment. of conviction has alréady been. entered.
on :multiplicitous counts, that right is protected. by vacating the convictions. ‘on all but. one:
multiplicitous count. /d.

“For purposes. of:a multiplicity: analysis, the determinative issuc :is not whether the. same
