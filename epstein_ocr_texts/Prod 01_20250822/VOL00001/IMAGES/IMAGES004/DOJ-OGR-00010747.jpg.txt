the Government correctly notes, while these statements do implicate privacy interests that might
justify certain redactions, those interests here belong to the witnesses themselves, none of whom
has sought to submit her statement under seal. Dkt. No. 673 at 2. It follows that the Defendant
fails to present any sufficiently weighty countervailing factors or higher values to override the
presumption in favor of public access. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110,
124 (2d Cir. 2006). Accordingly, the Defendantâ€™s request for redactions is denied.

In sum, all seven written statements received by the Court are deemed part of the record.
The Court will consider them only for what they permissibly may be considered. The
Government shall promptly docket the written statements without redactions. Annie Farmer,
Kate, and Virginia Giuffre may present an in-person statement at sentencing if they wish to do
sO.

The Government shall provide copies of this Order to counsel for the seven individuals
who submitted statements by no later than today, June 24, 2022.

SO ORDERED.
