2 THE COURT: This is not sealed. It's out of the

3 earshot of the jury.

4 State your objection.

a) MS. COMEY: Your Honor, this is in violation of

6 pretrial ruling made by the Court, including the defense, from
7 arguing that the government was targeting this defendant --

8 THE COURT: And they may not do that. What they can

9 do is argue that, for the witnesses, she's a scapegoat or a

10 stand-in, and I think that's where we are in the line. I think
11 the last statement comes closest because you put it in context
12 of justice. The other ones, that's why I said as stated, were
13 on the line about credibility of these witnesses and motives of
14 witnesses and that, I think you agree, is permissible.

15 MS. COMEY: That is permissible, your Honor. But the
16 reference to an empty chair is clearly a reference to this case
17 and the prosecution --

18 THE COURT: I won't allow the line to be crossed into
19 where I ruled on, which is that you can't talk about
20 motivations of the prosecution. The government is not on
2l trial.
22 To the extent that you want to argue motivation of the
23 witnesses to not tell the truth or credibility with respect to
24 them, you may do that, but don't play with the line.
25 MS. STERNHEIM: I will not. I will not play with the
