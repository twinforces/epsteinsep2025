“This means that ‘the district court, must:determine if ‘it. would-have granted the hypothetical
challenge’ if'it had known the:true facts.” Jd. (quoting. Stewart, 433 F.3d at, 304), (citing Gréer,
285.F.3d at 171; United States v. Shaoul, 41 F.3d.811, 816 (2d Cir. 1994) (noting that under the
‘second prong of McDonough. a defendant must have.a:basis for arguing that the district :court is
requited.to sustain his challenge for cause). As. in Dungerdas, and under any reading of
McDonough, Juror, No. 50’s misconduct.demonstrates that he was incapable of being an
impartial juror and'the Court‘would have struck’ him for cause. See id:

The government’s contrary: arguments do not-withstand scrutiny. Foremost, the:
government, mischaracterizes Ms., Maxwell’s argument.and then attempts to shoot down the
strawman. Ms. Maxwell does not argue that. everi*person who has been a'victini of sexual assault
‘or. sexual, abuse was subject to-a. “mandatory” challenge for cause based on implied. bias. Ms.
Maxwell’s argument is simply that Juror No. ‘50 was implicdly’biased—an argument;more than
supported by the record, Juror No. 50’s pattern and practice of*telling falschoods to, the Court,
and the statements of Juror No. 50 himself.

Likewise, the government. misunderstands Ms. Maxwell’s argument: about Juror’ No. 50’s
false: claims ‘regarding his social media. accounts. (Put aside for the moment the government’s
‘implausible contention, that. on this score as well, Juror No. 50 didn’t mislead the Court, and
surely didn’t. do so deliberately.) Ms. Maxwell does not:contend that Juror. No. 50 would have
been.cxcluded for cause if he had.admitted. to being,a Twitter user. The point is that Juror No.
50’s false denial, of being a Twitter user.is, part of his pattern. and practice of giving false answers
under oath during wir dire, in.a (successful) attempt'to Serve, as a juror. “The deliberateness of’

the particular lics evidence[] partiality.” Greer, 285 ‘F.3d at.173,
