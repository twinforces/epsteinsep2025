him.” United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (quoting
McDonough, 464 U.S. at 554). Challenges for cause can be based on implied bias, inferable
bias, or actual bias. See United States v. Torres, 128 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. 1997). In determining
whether Juror 50 was biased, the Court should consider several factors, including “[1] the

similarity between the juror’s experiences and important facts presented at trial, [2] the scope
and severity of the juror’s dishonesty, and [3] the juror’s motive for lying.” See Sampson v.
United States, 724 F.3d 150, 166 (1" Cir. 2013) (citations omitted). The record developed at the
Hearing strengthened the already compelling evidence of Juror 50’s bias and established that,
had he answered the questionnaire honestly, he would have been struck for cause.

A. The Similarity Between Juror 50’s Sexual Abuse and the Witnesses’ Sexual

Abuse, As Well As His Post-Trial Conduct, Establish Bias.

At the hearing, Juror 50 disclosed the facts of his sexual abuse, which significantly
paralleled the abuse described by the government’s four key victim witnesses at trial. Jury 50
had already disclosed some of these facts in his post-trial press interviews. But the opportunity
to question Juror 50 further about the circumstances of his abuse at the Hearing—an opportunity
that Ms. Maxwell was denied at voir dire because of his false answers to the questionnaire—
revealed even more striking similarities to the abuse described by the four victim witnesses at
trial. Like the four accusers, Juror 50 (1) was sexually abused as a minor, (i1) was abused on
multiple occasions over the course of several years, and (iii) delayed reporting the abuse. (Tr. 8-
9). Like the four accusers, Juror 50 was abused by two people who were friends and who each
participated in the abuse. (Tr. 8-9). Furthermore, Juror 50 was not abused by a stranger or
sexually assaulted by someone he did not know. He was abused by someone familiar to him, his
stepbrother, who was part of his life (Tr. 8-9), just as the four accusers described the relationship
between their families and Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. These similarities are significant and
