first explained that applying the Korfant factors led to the conclusion that successive
prosecutions for conspiracies to distribute marijuana were barred by double jeopardy, but then
continued, stating that “several additional factors . . . not directly addressed in Korfant . . . further
point toward a finding of double jeopardy,” namely, “the fact that the Government, in its opening
and closing arguments, presented both cases to the jury as broad conspiracies of an essentially
identical nature.” 356 F.3d at 197. The same is true here. As explained above, the
Government’s opening statement and closing arguments presented a theory of a singular
conspiracy, highlighting: The degree of similarity between each victim witness’s experience
over a decade; the common “playbook” that the Defendant ran “over and over and over again,”
Trial Tr. at 2848; and the tight partnership between the Defendant and Epstein. And each of
those features was accompanied by references to a singular “scheme” to abuse all victim
witnesses. /d. at 36, 2843, 2853. At bottom, the case presented to the jury by the Government
was of a single decade-long conspiracy by the Defendant and Epstein to sexually abuse underage
girls. Having pursued such a broad and encompassing conspiracy, the Government cannot now
claim, and cannot carry its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that Count
Five was legally and factually distinct. See Maslin, 356 F.3d at 197.

Because Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous, the proper remedy is to enter
judgment on only one of the counts. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at 355 (“If the jury convicts on
more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s right not to suffer multiple punishments for
the same offense will be protected by having the court enter judgment on only one of the
multiplicitous counts.” (citing Ball v. United States, 470 U.S. 856, 865 (1985))). Because Count
Five is factually subsumed by Count Three, the Court will impose judgment only on Count
Three. The Court emphasizes, however, that finding Count Five to be multiplicitous “does not
