expert opinion testimony, either, and thus no notice objection can be sustained. But in any event
the Government is not planning to offer this opinion in its direct examination of Flatley. Instead,
it is responsive to an expected line of cross-examination: the defense notice for Examiner Kelso
suggests they will challenge whether the defendant ever used Government Exhibit 54. The login
data, which shows that the vast majority of logins occurred on the user account “Ghislaine,”
undermines that claim. The defendant can hardly claim that the Government provided insufficient
notice of testimony it discussed with the witness in response to the defendant’s expert notice and
which the Government would only elicit in response to cross-examination on the subject.

There is no further opinion contained in the December 5 notes. In response to a question
from defense counsel, the Government asked Flatley how he determined the number of user
accounts and logins, and Flatley rechecked those numbers. That information is additional detail
for the December 2 notes, and not itself expert opinion, new or otherwise. (And the production of
3500 material the same day it was generated is hardly an “untimely disclosure.”)

e Although the Government has noticed the testimony, the Government is not planning
to elicit any expert testimony about “clones.” (Def. Letter at 4). He will simply provide fact
testimony that he personally created an image of the devices marked for identification as
Government Exhibits 54 and 55.

e Testimony that “once a file is burned onto a CD, can’t unburn it” and “on original CD,
created date would be the same date as the modified date,” (Def. Letter at 5), is pure fact testimony.
It requires no specialized training to know that information; Flatley can testify to those facts based
on his personal knowledge. And, again, this is testimony that the Government does not intend to
elicit on direct examination, but rather would elicit only in response to cross-examination along
