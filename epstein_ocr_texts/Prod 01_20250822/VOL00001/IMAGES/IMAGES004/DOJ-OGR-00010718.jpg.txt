Last. year, I travelled :internationally-to New York to attend Maxwell's trial. “Lhatewas both
‘therapeutic: and ‘traumatizing. Tt was therapeutic to -hearthe testimony of the tour-brave victim-

witnesses, whose experiences paralleled my own, to know that Twas not alone.and, that our. story

away tinally being told, tor the world ‘to hear. Butitrwas also traumatizing to rclive the expericnce, and

Hashbacks and the ‘nightmares. have increased.

Still téags at.my: soul,—Attér all of this, how Ean thé manages of this GiGrmous sex trathicking:
conspifacyanvolving, so Many eS-Conspirators that: Siared. 100'S, 1 61,0008 S&F vulnerable, girls and,
young-woinen overt three decades. continue to faiftain.her innocence? Who, and what.institution,
enabled this sex ttatticking ting to coftinue. Why haven’t the institutions and important people: that
enabled-them-been exposed and-brought:to justice? Reflecting on it, T know the answers. to my

questions.

Maxwell ts today the same woman met almost 20 vears avo —.incapable of compassion or

ocial status, and connections, she believes herselt

common. human decency. Because ot hérwealth, '

continue to work t6 réec6ver-trom thé sex-trathicking hell, she perpetrated. She will never

éver hurt another vourig woman or child in this litetime. Mor that, [ain sure.

wAs tor the important, high-profile enablers. — governmental institutions, politicians, and very
wealthy:friends of Epstein/ Maxwell here and abroad.— so far their stature and power have protected
them. Lhope that one, day they will be exposed, and we will be able: to say that.the United, States

‘truly is governed bythe role.of law and ‘not by-powertal people.
