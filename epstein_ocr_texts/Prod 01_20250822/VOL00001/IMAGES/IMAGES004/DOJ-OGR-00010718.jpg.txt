Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document675-2 Filed 06/25/22 Page4of5

Last year, I travelled internationally to New York to attend Maxwell's trial. That was both
therapeutic and traumatizing. It was therapeutic to hear the testimony of the four-brave victim-
witnesses, whose experiences paralleled my own, to know that I was not alone and that our story
was finally being told for the world to hear. But it was also traumatizing to relive the experience, and
flashbacks and the nightmares have increased.

Iam grateful that the jury believed the victims and returned a guilty verdict. But a question
still tears at my soul — After all of this, how can the manager of this enormous sex trafficking
conspiracy involving so many co-conspirators that snared 100's if not 1,000s of vulnerable girls and
young women over three decades continue to maintain her innocence? Who and what institution
enabled this sex trafficking ring to continue. Why haven’t the institutions and important people that
enabled them been exposed and brought to justice? Reflecting on it, I know the answers to my
questions.

Maxwell is today the same woman I met almost 20 years ago — incapable of compassion or
common human decency. Because of her wealth, social status, and connections, she believes herself
beyond reproach and above the law. Sentencing her to the rest of her life in prison will not change
her, but it will give other survivors and I a slight sense of justice and help us as we

continue to work to recover from the sex-tratticking hell she perpetrated. She will never,
ever hurt another young woman or child in this lifetime. For that, I am sure.

As for the important, high-profile enablers — governmental institutions, politicians, and very
wealthy friends of Epstein/Maxwell here and abroad — so far their stature and power have protected
them. I hope that one day they will be exposed, and we will be able to say that the United States
truly is governed by the rule of law and not by powerful people.
