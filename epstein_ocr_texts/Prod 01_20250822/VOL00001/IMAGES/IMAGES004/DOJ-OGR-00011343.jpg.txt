This includes the attorneys for “Jane,” “Kate,” and Carolyn. Pursuant to the Court’s
direction, the defense has conferred with the government about these witnesses. At this
point, the government has not agreed to stipulate to their testimony and are awaiting a
decision from the Court about the privilege issues previously briefed.

We also note that three of the defense witnesses, which we have separately identified to the
government, have requested to testify under their first names or under a pseudonym. The
government opposes this request. The Court’s ruling on the anonymity issue may impact the
willingness of these witnesses to testify and, in turn, may affect the witness order.

Based on current information the tentative witness order is as follows:

1. Cimberly Galindo Espinosa
