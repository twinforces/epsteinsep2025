Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S220 Cr. 330 (AJN)
‘Dear Judge Nathan:

Pursuant to the Court’s Order of earlier today,. we respectfully submit this letter in
opposition to the government’s. request to modify the Court’s proposed.limiting instruction
concerning the:testimony of Witness-3. The government’s request is yct another ‘example of its
repeated attempts:to relitigate issues that have been decided against them. The Court’s instruction
is appropriate afd balanced and should not be changed.

We should be clear from the:outset — we:are in this position. because the government. is
insisting on calling a’witness who has alleged: conduct that is not-illegal. The ‘Court has ruled, and.
the government has itself conceded, that. Witness-3 “is nota. victim of any of the:crimes charged in
Witness-3 describe the details of her sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein would have:no probative value
because it:cannot establish an clement of the charged.offenses. See id. at 4.(“There is little to:no
probative value of'a, witness describing sexual activity when. that. witness’s testimony ‘regarding the

sexual. activity cannot form the basis for the conviction of the crimes charged.”); sce-dalso
