that she did so in connection with the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie Farmer, or
Carolyn. The aggravating role enhancement therefore docs not apply to any of the three offense
groups.

B. The Criminal. Activity Was Not “Otherwise Extensive”

Even if the Court finds that Ms. Maxwell.supervised another “participant,” the record
‘was “otherwise extensive,” as the government contends.” Under'the Guidelines, the Court must:
treat cach minorvictim separately and consider whether the enhancement applies. based. solely on
the criminal activity related to that minor'victim. See USSG § 2G1.3, cmt. n.6 (“[S]ubsection
(d)(1) directs that. ifthe relevant conduct ofan offense of conviction includes travel or
transportation to: engage in a commercial sex act or’prohibited sexual conduet in respect to. more
than one minor: ......cach.such:minor shall be: treated.as if contained ‘in a separate count of
conviction.”). For example, the government cannot use conduct :from the 2001-2004 time-period
related, to Carolyn, to justify applying the aggravating'role enhancement to the criminal activity in
1994-1997 related to “Jane” or in 1996 related to Annic Farmer.

The government: nevertheless attempts to justify the enhancement.as to cach of'the:three.
minor victims by making a broad. assertion about the nature and scope of'the conspiracy. asa,
whole, father than making an individualized determination that the criminal. activity was
“otherwise extensive” as to cach. (See PSR. at 59). Because:that is insufficient to establish that
the criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” Ms. Maxwell should, at ‘most, be subject to a

two-point enhancement-under USSG § 3B1.1(c).

” The government does not argue:that the aggravating role enhancement applics:because the criminal.activity
‘involved “five-or more participants,”.conceding thatthe trialirecord ‘does not support the: conclusion.that five or.
more people:criminally‘participated in.the offense: conduct:
