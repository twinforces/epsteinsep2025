‘Ttbas beca a long journey to bring Maxwell to Justice for the horifle crimes inflicted on me and
fuandreds of other girls and young wonien. Sadly, the accurate count of victims will sever be

later, to suffer from the horrifio trauma it caused.

I ves born into a dysfunctions! family, My parents diverced when I was three-and-e-hal f ycars

beftiended me and, soon after tht, arranged for eon to mae “Jeffery”. She described him ss a

As the evidence at the Maxwell trial proved, and my ows experience confirms, Maxvell was his
Fighthand women, She was the Five Ster General of several recruiters end many others who
provided the means and cover for Epsteln's predatica.

Epatoin and Maxwell were masters of finding young, vulnerable girls and young women to

expioit. Upon targeting a velnemile pirVyoung giv/young woman, they would ingratiate themzclves to hev,
giving ber compliments and email gifts, telling her how special sho was. They would tell hier that
Epstein was a very wealthy, generous man whose primary interest was to help the lens fortunate.

He end Maxwell were: ated, wortdly edults with desp ties to important people, world

However, seen after belling mé and others into a fhise sease of comfort and security, they
pounced, ensnaring us in thelr upside-down, twisted world of rape, rape and more raps. Like:
