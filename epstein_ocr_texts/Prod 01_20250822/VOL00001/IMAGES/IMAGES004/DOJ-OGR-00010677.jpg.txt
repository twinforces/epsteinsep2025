Sarah Ransome — Victim Impact Statement for Ghistaine Maxwell
It bas been a long journey to bring Maxwell to justice for the homific csimes inflicted on me and
hundreds of other girls and young women. Sadly, the accurate count of victims will never be
known. My book Silenced No More chronicles my “journey to hell and back". Although I have
- physically escaped the trap set by Epstein, Maxwell ond their minions, [ continue, now 17 years
ister, to suffer from the horrific trauma it caused.
I was bor itto a dysfunctional family. My parents divorced when I was three-and-a-half years
old. My mother, with whom I lived during most of my youth, was a chronic alcholic, and my
fiuber was largely absent after the diverce. My vulnerability and brokenness made mo a prime
I came to New York when I was 22 years old, wanting to stent my life over after an incredibly
ebusive relationship, and hoping to attend FIT and work in the fashion industry. Those dreams
~ Seon after arriving, ! met on Epstein/Maxwell recruiter named Natalya Malyshev ina club. She
befitended me and, soon after that, arranged for me to meet “Jeffery”. She described him as a
kind philanthropist who could help me get into FIT and provide much-needed support,
. something which was alien to me.
Over the next seven to eight months, I became, against my will, nothing more than 9 sex toy with
4 heartbeat and soul used to entertain of Epstein, Maxwell aed ethers. Sometimes I was subjected
to his sexual predation multiple times per day, both in his New York mansion and on his private
: istand St. Litte James in the U.S. Virgin Islands, aided by Maxwell and others. On one visit to
the island, the sexual demands, degradation and humiliation caused me to try to escape by
: jumping off a cliff into shark-infested waters; 1 was caught by Maxwell and company moments
befere jumping. At the time, that extrentely risky escape seemed more appealing than being
raped one more dime,
As the evidence at the Maxwell trial proved, and my own experience confirms, Maxwell was his
righthand woman, She was the Five Star General of several recruiters and many others who
provided the means and cover for Epstein’s predation.
; Epstein and Maxwell were masters ot finding young, vulnerable girls and young women to
exploit. Upon targeting a vulnerable gir/young woman, they would ingratiate themselves to hes,
Epstein was a very wealthy, generous man whose primary interest was to help the leas fortunate.
He and Maxwell were sophisticated, wostdly adults with deep ties to important people, world
leaders and institutions who could give the victims the lifeline they needed to make their dreams
_ Weslity or orush them.
However, coon after tulling me and others into a false sense of comfort and security, they
pounced, ensnaring us in their upside-down, twisted wortd of rape, rape and more rape. Like
Hotel California, you could blindly check into the Epstein-Maxweil dungeon of sexual hell, but
you could never leave. Jeffery and Ghislaine made sure of that.
