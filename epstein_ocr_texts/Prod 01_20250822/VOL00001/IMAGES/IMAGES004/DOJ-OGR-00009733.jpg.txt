answers to Questions 25 and 48 are reason cnough. to order anew trial. because they relate
to the core allegations against Ms. Maxwell. Moreover, if this Court orders an evidentiary
hearing, itis likcly additional ‘false.answers will come to light, further supporting ‘the
conclusion that Ms. Maxwell is. entitled to a, new trial.

In State v. Ashfar, the defendant:was convicted of aggravated. sexual assault: based

involving, sexual. assault, state court decisions are particularly helpful. The New
Hampshire Supreme Court “assum[cd] without deciding that McDonough provides the
applicable analytical. framework” and concluded that the trial court “sustainably exereised.
its discretion. in finding the juror “was not impartial.” 196.A.3d at.97. |
