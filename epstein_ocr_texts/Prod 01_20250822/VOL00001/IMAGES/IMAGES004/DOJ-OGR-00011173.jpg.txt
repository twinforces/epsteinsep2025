her counsel, her entire draft “memoir” (entitled “The Billionaire Playboys Club’) was released
by the Second Circuit in Brown v. Maxwell. See Case No. 18-2868 (2d. Cir.), Dkt. 278 at 564

represented in the Kramer notes at 4-5, attached as Exhibit 5 to the government’s Response,
the government cannot show any privacy interest in keeping those portions redacted or sealed.
Objections to Government’s Failure to Redact Materials Under Seal in Giuffre Litigation at
Pages 129-134
The government proposes, at pages 129-134, to redact only certain portions of Ms. Maxwell’s
sealed deposition testimony. Judge Preska has ruled that certain questions and answers are
still under seal and subject to the Protective Order in the Giuffre case. In Ms. Maxwell’s
Motions, we limited our proposed redactions to the portions of deposition testimony that
Judge Preska has ruled should remain sealed, yet the government intends to publicize those
sealed portions. See, e.g., Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 15-cv-7433-LAP, Dkt. 1212-1. The
appropriate redactions which reflect Judge Preska’s rulings are contained in the attached
exhibit.
For the foregoing reasons, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests the Court publicly docket the
Response, with the following exceptions:
e Accept Ms. Maxwell’s proposed redactions to pages 129-134;!
e Accept the government’s proposed redactions to pages 158-186;
e Accept Ms. Maxwell’s proposed redactions to pages 187-188;7
e Accept Ms. Maxwell’s proposed redactions to Exhibit 5.°
Respectfully submitted,
