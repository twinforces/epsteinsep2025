not need four attorneys to be present to observe the questioning of Juror 50 and participate in the
hearing. Any desire the defendant has to have her four attorneys represent her at the hearing is
vastly outweighed by the significant public interest in a speedy resolution of this matter.
Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court deny defense counselâ€™s
adjournment request and proceed with the March 8, 2022 hearing as scheduled.

Respectfully submitted,

DAMIAN WILLIAMS

United States Attorney
