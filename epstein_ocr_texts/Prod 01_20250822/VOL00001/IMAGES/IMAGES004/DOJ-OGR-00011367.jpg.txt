e The first time Ms. Maxwell was involved, Ms. Maxwell guided it, but the Sophie and Eva
“knew the routine.” Jd.

e Sometimes it started with Mr. Epstein wanting a massage and saying, “you girls come
with me.”

e Sometimes the girls would make out with each other during these encounters. /d.

Eva will contradict this testimony.

Contrary to the government’s argument, there is no doubt that Eva Dubin, who Ms.
Maxwell intends to call as a witness, is the same “Eva” Jane claimed both during her testimony
and the February 2020 interview was involved in group sexualized massages with Mr. Epstein
and “could confirm her story.”

e Lawrence Visoski testified that Eva Dubin was “one of Mr. Epstein’s original first
girlfriends,” now his ex-girlfriend, a former Miss Sweden, who went on to marry Glenn
Dubin. TR at 262-63.

e Jane told the government that “Eva” was Mr. Epstein’s “ex-girlfriend and they stayed
friends.” See 3509-008 p 7.

e Inan August 2021 interview with the government, see 3509-020, Jane told the
government that “Eva” was the “Ms Sweden Lady.” /d. at 1. Jane said she “does not
remember” Eva “being involved in massages,” but maybe Eva “aged out of that.” Jd.

e Although Jane did not recall Eva being involved in the massages when she spoke with the
government in August 2021, she admitted that she did “not recall there being another
Eva.” /d. at 2.

The upshot of Jane’s statements is this:
