1 A... That's: right.

2 ®. It was filed under your signature?

3 A. It was.

4 Q. With your ECF number?

5 A. That"s so.

6 QO. You were ultimately responsible for the factual assertions
7 in that brief, correct?

8 A. Yes. I reviewed it and I signed it and I am responsible

9 for it.

10 Q. That set of facts was not accurate and complete, was it,

11 Ms. Brune?

12 A. When I reflect on that brief, and I certainly have done so
13 repeatedly and at length, it's the thing that I regret. What I
14 mean by that is we kind of missed it. There were two things

LS that were going on. One is we were spending a lot of energy

16 trying to persuade ourselves that what we were going to say to
17 the judge was right, that is, that there was this fraud that

18 happened, and we were very focused on not having Mr. Parse's

ne application kicked out the way that it was kicked out in Martha
20 Stewart for not sort of having proved it enough.
21 I certainly thought about the waiver issue. But what
oe I really missed is I thought that the government would likely
23 inquire and we would say we didn't know, because we didn't
24 know. I certainly never imagined that the reality that we did
25 not know was going to assume the sort of debate level
