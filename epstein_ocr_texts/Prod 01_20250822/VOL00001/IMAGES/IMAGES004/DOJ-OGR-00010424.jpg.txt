A. A Jury Must Determine the End Date of Criminal Conduct that Dictates

Which Guidelines Book Applies Consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause.

As set forth above, it would be a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause for the Court to
sentence Ms. Maxwell under the 2004 Guidelines absent a finding that the offense conduct
continued past November 1, 2004. That finding must be made by a jury, not the sentencing
court. Because the jury never made such a finding here, the Court cannot apply the 2004
Guidelines and must instead apply the 2003 Guidelines.

Several appellate courts, including the Second Circuit, have held that if the end date of
the offense conduct dictates whether, consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause, a harsher penalty
may apply to the defendant, then that fact must be resolved by a jury. See United States v.
Julian, 427 F.3d 471, 480-482 (7 Cir. 2005) (“As it is the lifespan of the conspiracy that
determines whether, consistent with the Ex Post Facto Clause, the defendant may be subject to
the enhanced penalty [of 18 U.S.C. § 2423], the question whether the alleged conspiracy
continued beyond the effective date of the new penalty is one that must be submitted to the
jury.”); United States v. Tykarsky, 446 F.3d 458, 478-480 (3d Cir. 2006) (“[B]ecause the
communications spanned two different versions of the statute [18 U.S.C. § 2422] with different
minimum penalties, the question of whether the violation extended beyond the effective date of
the amended version was one that had to be resolved by the jury.”); United States v. Harris, 79
F.3d 223 (2d Cir. 1996) (noting that when the offense conduct for a continuing criminal offense
is alleged to straddle the date when the applicable penalty increased, the jury must determine
whether the criminal conduct continued past the date of the change for purposes of the Ex Post
Facto Clause); United States v. Torres, 901 F.2d 205, 226-27 (2d Cir. 1990) (same), overruled
on other grounds as recognized by United States v. Marcus, 628 F.3d 36 (2d Cir. 2010).
