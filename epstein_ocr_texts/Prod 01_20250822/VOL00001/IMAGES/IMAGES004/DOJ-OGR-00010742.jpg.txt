consider at. sentencing. See Fed. R., Evid. 11.01(d)(3); United States v. Croxford, 324 F., Supp. 2d.
1230, 1240 (D. Utah 2004); United States ‘v. Fennel, 65 F.3d 812,813, (10th Cir 1995).

Of particular importance in. confirming ‘the broad power of courts. at:sentencing. isa broad,
federal provision—18 U.S.C. § 366]1—which' states “no limitation shall, be placed on, the
information conecming the background, character, and conduet of. a’person-convicted Of:an offense
appropriate scntence” (emphasis, added). The critical words “no limitation” grant a sentencing’
court extremely broad discretionary authority over what sentencing information. ‘will. be:
considered. The ‘Second Circuit, for example, has ‘recognized. the broad scope of this provision.
See United. States ¥. MOrFisons, 778 F.3d 396, 400-011 (2d Cir. 2015). The Second Circuit noted that:
§ 3661 contains “emphatic language” which “preclude[s] categorical. proscriptions on ‘any.
Jacior concerning the background, character, and, conduct of the defendant, with the exception, of
invidious factors.” Jd. (cmphasis in. original) (citing Witited States. Cavera, 550'F.3d.180, 19.1
(2d 'Cir:2008) (en banc)).

In view of these authorities, the court-has discretionary to hear from.anyone it. belicves would
have useful. information for sentencing. Kate respectfully: submits that hearing from her will help
the court. in imposing. a.fair and just sentence and.that-she ‘should. be allowed to speak.

For all-these:reasons, the Court.should allow ‘Kate to deliver.an oral-victim impact statement
at defendant Maxwell’s sentencing, or, at a minimum, provide her‘additional time to bricf the issue.
