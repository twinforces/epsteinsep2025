Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 609 Filed 02/24/22 Page4of13
1. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Juror 50 respectfully moves this Court and requests an Order granting him the right to
intervene in this action, under the Court’s inherent authority, in order to protect his compelling
privacy interests and potential criminal liability, both of which are implicated by this Court’s
prior order that his conduct during his service as a member of the jury be potentially subject to an
investigation to determine the existence of possible juror misconduct.

Juror 50 seeks to intervene at this time in order to protect his privacy rights and his right
to avoid self-incrimination, and to further ensure that he will not be prejudiced by any
investigation ordered by this Court, should any subsequent action be brought against him as a
result of such investigation. First and foremost, obtaining access to the questionnaire Juror 50
completed as part of the selection process for jury service (hereafter the “Jury Questionnaire’’)
and the transcript of his testimony during voir dire are critical to Juror 50’s ability to determine if
he “wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry” by filing a brief. Order
at 1. Jan. 5, 2022. 20-CR-330. In order to achieve appropriate access to such documents and
records, Juror 50 must be granted leave to Intervene in this action, and thereby given a fair
opportunity to brief this Court as to why he should be heard, if indeed he determines that to be
necessary.

It is respectfully submitted that, in order to ensure the integrity of the process, the Jury
Questionnaire and the transcript of Juror 50’s voir dire should be released, under seal, to Juror
50’s attorney, the Prosecution and Defense Counsel.
