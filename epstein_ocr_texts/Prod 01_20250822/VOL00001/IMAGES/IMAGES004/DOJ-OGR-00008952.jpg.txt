defendants, the same method of operation, and the same objectives. See Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669

The government’s charging theory in the Indictment and its presentation of the evidence
at trial was that Epstein and Maxwell engaged in a single criminal scheme with a common
method of operation to recruit and “groom” underage females to engage in illegal sexual activity
in multiple locations, including Epstein’s residences in New York, Palm Beach, New Mexico,

about the playbook that Maxwell ran again and again and again.

hardships. Tr. 2849:18-2850:17. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell then isolated the girls from their
parents and began “grooming” them for sexual abuse by taking an interest in their lives, making
