1988) (interpreting McDonough and holding that “a juror’s dishonesty is not a predicate to
obtaining a new trial. The focus is on bias”). To the contrary, as five justices recognized in
McDonough and as the Second Circuit held in United States v. Langford, a new trial is required
when a biased juror is seated even if the juror’s false voir dire answers were the result of
inadvertence rather than the product of a deliberate effort. McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556-57
(Blackmun, J., concurring (citing Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 215-16 (1982); id. at 220-24
(O’Connor, J., concurring))); id. at 557-58 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment); United States
v. Langford, 990 F.2d 65, 68 (2d Cir. 1993) (“We read [the McDonough] multi-part test as
governing not only inadvertent nondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that
were deliberate. . . .”).> See also Leonard v. United States, 378 U.S. 544 (1964) (per curiam)
(reversing conviction based on implied bias and holding that prospective jurors who had heard
the trial court announce the defendant’s guilty verdict in the first trial should be automatically
disqualified from sitting on a second trial on similar charges). In Justice Blackmun’s words,
which were joined by Justices Stevens and O’Connor and expressed a view shared by Justice
Brennan and Justice Marshall, “regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest, it
remains within a trial court’s option, in determining whether a jury was biased, to order a post-

> The government implies something deceitful by Ms. Maxwell’s reliance on Justice
Blackmun’s and Justice Brennan’s concurrences, noting that six justices joined Justice
Rehnquist’s McDonough majority opinion. Resp. at 14 & n.8.

Contrary to the government’s implication, however, Ms. Maxwell’s motion accurately
described McDonough and its holding, noting that Justice Blackmun (joined by Justices Stevens
and O’Connor) “concurred” in the majority opinion while Justice Brennan (joined by Justice
Marshall) “concurred in judgment.” Mot. at 26. Most importantly, any way you look at it, five
votes is five votes. Zerka, 49 F.3d at 1186, n.7 (counting the votes in McDonough and explaining
the holding). And in McDonough, as the Court recognized in Langford when it quoted and
adopted Justice Brennan’s reasoning, the McDonough decision “govern[s] not only inadvertent
nondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate.” 990 F.2d at 68
(citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 557-58 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment)).
