Our lower Guidelines calculation begins from the premise that Mr. Parse was
convicted only of the three “backdating” transactions. If that is so, then the proper loss
calculation is this:

Coleman $2,738,630

Blair $ 470,035

Aronoff $ 536,770

Toporek h  '62:553

TOTAL $3,807,988
These numbers are based on the additional assessments calculated by the IRS, which are in
evidence.

Moreover, if the Guidelines calculation is based only upon the three “backdating”
transactions, then the enhancement for “sophisticated means” should not apply. While it is true
that the tax shelters created fraudulent tax losses through a series of complex transactions, the
“backdating” involved only correcting certain trades -- e.g., canceling a transaction in stock and
effecting one in foreign currency. The new transactions were shown in Deutsche Bank’s books
in the month in which they occurred, No records were altered. Thus, this is not an instance of
“hiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or
offshore financial accounts.” See Commentary § 2T1.1 Application Note 4.

Likewise, an enhancement for “special skills” under § 3B1.3 is unwarranted. The
Report states that Mr. Parse “used his special skills as a former stock broker and CPA to
materially facilitate his design and implementation of the highly-complex financial products that
were involved in different tax shelters.” § 64. Mr. Parse, however, had no role in designing the
