or emotional, condition, her statements made to Dr. Hall.in[_] about events that took place
years carlicr' cannot be said to be “then-existing.” Jd. The Defense-also says Alléged Victim 4’s
statements were “made for medical diagnosis or treatment.” Fed. R. Evid. 803(4). The Court
finds that this: may be:a' permissible basis ‘for admitting some of Alleged’ Victim,4’s statements,
though they:must be.““made for... medical diagnosis or treatment,” must “deseribe[ ] medical
history; pastor present symptoms or sensations; their inception; or their general cause,” and:must
otherwise satisfy Rules,401 and 403. Fed. R. Evid. 803(4)(A), (B); seen re Agent Orange
Prod. Liab. Litig.,'611 F. Supp. 1223, 1245-46 (E.D.N.Y. 1985), aff'd sub.nom., 818-F.2d 187
(2d Cir, 1987) (Weinstein, C.J.).' But.without additional detail ftom, the Defense on which
portions of Dr. Hall’s testimony it would seck' to admit under this exception, the Court. cannot’
make a.definitive ruling.

The Defense docs not mention Alleged Victim 4’s [ cited by Dr. Hall in,
his report. The Court concludes that Alleged Victim.4’s[ | are inadmissible under
Federal ‘Rule of Evidence 609., ‘Dr. Halls report:is not clear on the details of Alleged: Victim 4’s
however, are now. all over '10'years old, none appear to require proving “a dishonest.act or false
statement,” and, for| i, admitting the evidence isnot necessary to fairly

determine the guilt or innocence:of Ms: :-Maxwell. Fed. R. Evid. 609 (a), (b), (d).

' The Defense also argues that.Alleged Victim, 4’s statements would be “admissible for their
effect on Dr. ‘Hall. in forming his opinion.” ‘Def. Br.'at 15. But, like Rule 703, this justification ‘is
arclevant basis for admission only if the ‘validity of Dr. Hall’s diagnosés is put. in question.
