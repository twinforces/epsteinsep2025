1461-62. The Court explained that “Anton’s borrowing from, his. clients, while: cthically’
questionable, is... . irfelevant'to his truthfulness as.an expert.” /d. at 1464."

The same logic applies here. At most, Mr.[—___] engaged in,uncthical (but not
‘untruthful) conduct that created the risk: of harm by others. But. none of that conduct: involved
lying or.deccit, and none of it is ‘relevant to his truthfulness.

There are other reasons this Court:should:preclude’the government’s cross-cxamination.
First, the Court should consider “whether the testimony, of the'witiiess in question 1s crucial or
unimportant.”:Ne/son, 365 F. Supp. 2d.at.390. Here, Mr.[—________] testimony relevant only
to a narrow and limited issue—the admissibility of a document whose authenticity and-relevance,
the government appcars not to question.

Second, the Court. should consider “the relationship between the subject matter of the

prior deceptive act and that. of the instant litigation..As the connection becomes, more attenuated,
so does the: probative. value ofthe evidence.” Davidson Pipe Co. v..Laventhol.& Horwath, 120
F.R.D. 455, 463 (S.D.N.Y.1988). Here, Mr. ________] conduct, coneerns—>—________]
CL. _]. The subject matter of the instant litigation, by contrast, is alleged. sexual abuse and.
trafficking allegedly committed decades ago. There is no connection between.“‘subject-matter. of:
the prior [allegedly] deceptive ‘act and'that; of the: instant litigation.” See id.

Cases permitting cross-cxamination about'an attorncy’s, disbarment or suspension are. not.

to the contrary..£.g., United States v, Jackson, 882 F.2d 1444, 1448 (9th Cir. 1989) (no error in,

| The. Eleventh. Circuit also held thatthe. district’ court had. erred in, permitting inquiry’ into.
professional administrative: proceedings against.Anton where:no probable cause was found, no
‘sanction’ was imposed, or the procecdings were temporally. remote. Ad- Vantage, 37 F.3d-at 1464-
‘65. The evidence was not-probative of untruthfulness. or was unfairly prejudicial. /d.
