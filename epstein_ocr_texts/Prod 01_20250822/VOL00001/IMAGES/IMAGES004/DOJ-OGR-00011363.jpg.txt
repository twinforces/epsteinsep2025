Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

I write in response to the government’s motion to preclude testimony from Eva Dubin,
Michelle Healy, and Kelly Bovino.' The government claims that testimony from Eva, Michelle,
and Kelly is inadmissible because: (1) it does not contradict Jane’s testimony; and (2) it is
improper impeachment on a collateral matter. The government is wrong.

group sexualized massages with her, Mr. Epstein, and Ms. Maxwell. These women included Eva,
Michelle, and Kelly. TR. at 523-30. Although Jane has not always been consistent with the
government about the involvement of these women, she testified that all these women were
involved in or could “confirm” what happened in the group sexualized massages that are the

' The government also moved to preclude certain testimony from John Lopez. That part
of the motion is moot because Ms. Maxwell will not call Mr. Lopez as a witness.
