Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20. Cr. 330 (AIN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

I-write in-response to the government's motion to preclude testimony:from Eva Dubin,
Michelle Healy, and. Kelly Bovino.' The government.claims that testimony from Eva, Michelle,
and Kelly is inadmissible because: (1) it docs not contradict Jane’s testiniony; and (2); it is
improper impeachment on.a collateral. matter. The government is wrong.

On the stand, Jane alleged that several other’ women were involved. in séxual, conduet and.
‘group scxualized massages with her, Mr. Epstein, and-Ms.:Maxwell. These women included-Eva,
Michelle, and Kelly. ‘TR. ‘at 523-30. Although Jane, has not.always been. consistent with the
government about the involvement ofthese women, she-testificd that all these women, were

involved in or could “confirm” what happened in the group scxualized massages that are the.

' The government also moved.to preclude certain testimony from. John, Lopez. That’part.
of the motion.is moot; because Ms. Maxwell. will not call Mr. Lopez as, a witness.
