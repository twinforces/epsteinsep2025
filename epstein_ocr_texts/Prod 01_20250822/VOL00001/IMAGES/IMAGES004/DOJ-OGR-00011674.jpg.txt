1 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

2 The second issue is with respect to the issue of

3 having a screen that the witness sees, but which the government
4 can't see, I think the Court noted there is an issue with the

a government not being able to follow what the witness is being

6 shown.

7 Our concern in particular is that in a letter defense
8 counsel filed, I think they previewed that they plan to sort of
9 highlight some portions of the documents or flag certain

10 portions on the screen. That is very difficult for us to

11 follow without a mirrored screen. And so because we cannot

12 mirror the screens because they are open to the gallery, that
13 is why we proposed using paper for exhibits like that, and so
14 we ask to proceed that way.

15 THE COURT: Here's my thinking: Let's say they show
16 the paper and then they say, Okay, paragraph 2, read the first
17 sentence. If they want to highlight or make larger that first
18 sentence to ease the reading of it for the witness, if they've
19 described fully what they're doing on the screen, and I'm
20 watching it, I think that's okay and it is not that different
2l than doing it orally and with paper. And I would, of course,
22 allow the same for the government, to the extent that there are
23 documents that you may have a witness look at that can't -- if
24 they can't be projected on the counsel table because it might
25 be identifying, I would permit that as well.
