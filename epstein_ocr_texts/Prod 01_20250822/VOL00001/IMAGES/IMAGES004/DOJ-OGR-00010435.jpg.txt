not. The government ignores the: background.commentary to:§ 4B1.5, which explicitly states
that the adjustment only applies to: sex. offenders. ‘who present.a contimiing: danger to the
public.” USSG § 4B1.5, cmt. background (emphasis added). In doing:so, the government

interpretation.and application.of'§ 4B1.5. See Stinson. v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 38 (1993)
