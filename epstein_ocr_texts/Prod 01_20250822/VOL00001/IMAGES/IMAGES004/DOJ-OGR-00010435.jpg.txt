not. The government ignores the background commentary to § 4B1.5, which explicitly states
that the adjustment only applies to sex offenders “who present a continuing danger to the
public.” USSG § 4B1.5, cmt. background (emphasis added). In doing so, the government
rejects an authoritative statement from the Sentencing Commission about the proper
interpretation and application of § 4B1.5. See Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 38 (1993)
(“[C]ommentary in the Guidelines Manual that interprets or explains a guideline is authoritative
unless it violates the Constitution or a federal statute, or is inconsistent with, or a plainly
erroneous reading of, that guideline.”). The government is not at liberty to reject the Sentencing
Commission’s instructions, and neither is the Court.

Applying § 4B1.5 to Ms. Maxwell would directly contradict the intent of Congress and
the explicit instructions of the Sentencing Commission and would improperly add over 10 years
to her sentencing range. It was not meant to be applied in cases where the defendant is not a
danger to the community and poses no risk of recidivism. It should not be applied here.

B. Applying § 4B1.5 Would Lead to Absurd Results.

Applying § 4B1.5 would also yield a sentencing range for Ms. Maxwell that is
significantly higher than the range for a proven recidivist sex offender — i.e., the type of
defendant that Congress and the Sentencing Commission were so clearly targeting with § 4B1.5.
The Court should not interpret a guideline in such a way that it would lead to such obviously
absurd results. See United States v. Pope, 554 F.3d 240, 246 (2d Cir. 2009).

Section 4B1.5 contains two prongs — one that applies to defendants who have been
convicted of at least one prior sex offense (USSG § 4B1.5(a)) and one that applies to defendants
who have not been convicted of a prior sex offense (USSG § 4B1.5(b)). As discussed above, the
purpose of the Act and § 4B1.5 was to increase the sentences given to repeat sex offenders. It
follows that convicted sex offenders who re-offend after being released from prison should
