Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document675 Filed 06/25/22 Page 8 of 21

Maxwell in. this case is ‘particularly.important ‘for. these-victims,, Crime victims: often want to speak.
“to regain a sense of dignity and. respect rather than feeling powerless and. ashamed.” Degenhardt, 405
ESupp.2d at. 1348 (internal quotation omitted). Here, Sarah.and Elizabeth believe it is important
that they be:given.an opportunity: to speak:as part: of the process of overcoming the horrific impact of
Maxwell's sex trafficking conspiracy on them and others.

Il. Regardless of Whether Sarah and Elizabeth are CVRA “Victims;” the Court Undoubtedly
Possesses Discretion to Hear from them at Sentencing Under 18 U.S.C. § 3661

For all the reasons just explained, Sarah and Elizabeth have the right to speak at. Maxwell's:
sentencing -urider the CVRA. Additionally, this Court also possesses broad discretionary power,
derived from statute and common law, to hear ‘from them when determining the appropriate
sentence for Maxwell's: crimes. See 18 U.S.C: §, 3661; see ako Degenhardt, 405 FSupp.2d at ‘1343.
(discussing the court’s discretionary powers'to hear from victims).

The Court's discretion. in this: case is important not only because it provides an alternative.
basis for considering Sarah’s and. Elizabeth's yictim impact, but also because the Court may-have
other requests to speak’ at.Maxwell’s sentencing. Some of these other-victims may not be able to
afford legal.counsel to present'their arguments to this Court.' Federal. courts have:wide discretion. to

gather information:at sentencing: subject to only a few constitutional or statutory restrictions. See.

United States v. Ticker, 404 U.S. 443, 446 (1972) CTA] judge may appropriately: condiiet an inquiry

"Under the GVRA, the Justice Department is obligated. to-use its “best efforts” to. protect the
rights .of “crime victims.” 18 U.S.C § 3771 (c)(1). We. trust that: the Department will present ‘factual.
and legal arguments in support: of victims being, heard. at: sentencing.
