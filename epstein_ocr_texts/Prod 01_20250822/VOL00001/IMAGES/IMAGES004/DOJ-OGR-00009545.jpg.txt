any juror’s mental. processes concerning’the verdict: or'indictment: The court

‘may not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s statement. on these
‘matters.

whether Juror'50°s: answers on.the questionnaire and voir dire:merit a new trial, it:need’ not. and.does not resolve
those:disputes pre-hearing.
