1 THE COURT: So we won't add "solely," because we don't
2 want to wrongly instruct the jury about the law. So we'll keep
3 that one as it is.

4 I need to think about the other one. In my mind, this
a is an issue that pertains -- I understand there's a witness

6 where the only sexual conduct took place in New Mexico, and I

7 had understood previously that that witness was above the age

8 of consent in New Mexico, but that the government was offering
9 that evidence as enticement to engage in illegal sexual conduct
10 in New York. And that's what I was trying to capture in the

11 instruction, so that that evidence could be relevant, the jury
12 could see that evidence as relevant to the enticement to

13 illegal sexual activity as defined under New York law, which is
14 the only way that the government has charged this case, other
15 than the trafficking count -- well, including the trafficking
16 count, yes.

17 And that's what I was trying to capture. And I'll

18 consider the alterations you're suggesting. What we can't do
19 is infuse the instruction with the government's case and
20 arguments. The point here is just to make clear what the
21 jurors can't do and then, to the extent they otherwise deem the
22 evidence relevant, they can consider it and we'll give them the
23 charge at the end of the day. But I'll consider the
24 suggestions. I haven't -- just haven't had time.
25 Anything on that?
