THE COURT: So we won't add "solely," because we don't
want to wrongly instruct the jury about the law. So we'll keep
that oné as it is.

I need. te think about the other one, In my mind, this

Hs an isstie that pértains, -- I understdnd ‘there's, a witness
where the’ only sexual conduct took. place in New Mexico, and IL
had. understood previously ‘that that witness was above the age

of consent in New Mexico, but that the government was offering

that evidence, as enticement t6 engage, ihn illegal sexual edénduét
in, New York. And that's what I was trying to capture in the
instructién,; so that that. evidence Could be relevant, thé jury
could see ‘that evidence as relevant to the enticement. to
illegal sexual activity as defined under New York law, which is
the only way that. the government, has charged this case, other
than the trafficking Count == well, including the trafficking
count, yes.

And that's what I was trying to Capture. And I'll

consider the alterations you're suggesting. What we can't do
is infuse the instruction with the government.'s case and

arguments. The point bere is just to make clear what the

jurors can't do and theh, to the extent they Stherwisée déem the

evidence relevant, they can consider it and, we'll give them the
charge at the end of the day. But I"ll consider the
suggestions. I haven't —- just haven't had time.

Anything on that?
