1 mentioned there was a suspended lawyer with the name of

2 Catherine Conrad. The connection that I think she was drawing
3 Was that we had received a note from Juror No. 1 that raised

4 certain legal concepts, and that was the connection. I did not
5 ask what the basis was for knowing that there was a suspended

6 lawyer named Catherine Conrad, no, I did not.

x QO. Wasn't that a highly significant fact to find out that

8 there was a suspended New York attorney with the same name as

9 Juror No. 1?

10 A, Actually, my reaction was it was, I thought it was

11 impossible that they would be the same person based on Juror
12 No. 1's voir dire responses.
13 Q. It is correct, is it not, that if you have two people with
14 similar names that you can do simple, take simple steps to try
1 to increase or decrease the possibility that the two people

16 were the same one. Would you agree with me?
1? A. Hypothetical, if that's what you were doing in a different
18 Situation. We were discussing the fact that there was a
Lg suspended lawyer with the name of Catherine Conrad. We then
20 were discussing that Juror No. 1 on voir dire in response to
21 the unambiguous question what is your highest level of
22 education said that she had a BA in English. To me that ruled
23 out the possibility that they were the same person.
24 QO. Ms. Edelstein, could you just answer my question that I
25 asked? Are there steps that you can take if you have one
