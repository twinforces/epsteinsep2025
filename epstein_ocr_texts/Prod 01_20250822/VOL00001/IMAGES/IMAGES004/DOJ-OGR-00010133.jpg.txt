Case 1:09-cr-00581-WHP Document 522° Filed 04/06/12 Page 8 of 29

23. The lawyers wrote: “The'tone and:content of the letter, :which were ini.sharp contrast-to
the image Conrad-had projected, through the trial‘(‘always:head down, taking notes’), caused.
defendants concern and prompted them:to:investigate.” Memorandum at 9. And'they later wrote:
“This is not-a situation. whéré Conrad disclosed sufficient information:to. warrant inquiry by
‘counsel. Defendants had no basis to inquire whether Conrad:was lying in response to each of the
‘Court’s questions.” Memorandum at 32, n.13' (internal citation and: ‘parenthetical quote-omitted).

24.  Immy-opinion, these statements should:be seen as true, not'merely literally true in a
hypertechnical. or-crabbed sense-of the word, but true:as. reasonably read. They do-not become:
untrué:because a reader may ‘draw a false inference that the lawyers did not intend.. The j Juror’s
letter did cause concern:and did prompt.an investigation, as'the first quotation in the
memorandum. states. That statement does:not disclaim a prior'search, whether that prior séarch is
called an investigation or something else. believe that focus.on the word “investigate, ” which is.
not a term of art, would be misguided-here. The sentence correctly:describes what the letter’
caused the lawyers to:do.

25 _ The second quote focuses on the: ‘voir dire i in March and i is also t true a as. reasonably: read.

Conrad’ was: not’ a “basis” for an inquiry into the truthfulness of juror Conrad’s ‘answers, Just the:
opposite: Her voir dire answers, in their view,. dispelled reason for inquiry. A suspended lawyer
would.not lie under oath at voir dire, they. teasoned, given the:consequences to the lawyer’s.
ability. ever to regain admission to practice. In my. opinion, this.conclusion: was compelling.

26. Itisalsomy opinion that the July 8, 2011, memorandum, taken:as a’ ‘whole, doés not
show a “knowing[]”? ‘violation of thé. provisions: -of Rule 3.3. Iti is true that. even when a. lawyer
does not have a duty to speak, :if;she-does ‘speak, she may not knowingly misrepresent to a court.
or adversary. But an‘unintended iriference:is.notia. misrepresentation. The lack of disclaimer
Janguage inthe memorandum’s true:statements — the fact that the lawyers, while focuséd.on the
new trial motion, did not anticipate what a.reader might infer and:what they’did not:mean to
imply — is not an.action that can support.a:finding of unethical behavior under the New York
‘Rules. ,

‘27. The lawyers understandably now wish they had not included these passages’as written.
Greater ‘focus might have led them to anticipate how others’ might'read them differently than
intended, and to-omit:them (they were-unnécessary to the motion), rephrase’ them,, or add ‘the
history of their earlier research.

The July 15 Te elephone Conference

28. Inthe July. 15 telephone conference, the Court said ‘that it wanted to “ascertain from.each
of the defendants ....whether:any of them were-aware of the disturbing things that: have. been
revealed by defense on this motion concerning Juror Number One [Conrad].” The Court invited:
a.résponse on the call or via letter; Trzaskoma’s response’ was:

Trzaskoma: We-were not‘aware-of the facts that have come to light, and I:think if your
Honor deems it appropriate, we:can submit:a letter.
