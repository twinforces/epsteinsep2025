Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 662 Filed .06/15/22 Page 8 of 29

In cach of these cases, the ex post facto violation resulted from an, increase inthe:
applicable statutory penalty;.as opposed to the applicable sentencing range under the Guidelines.
However, the Supreme Court has elearly held. that it is also:a:violation of the /y Post Facto
Clause to apply a later'version of the Guidelines that inercases the recommended sentencing
range if the eriminal. conduct was complete’ before the later version took effect: See Peugh, 569
Guidelines, promulgated after he committed his criminal acts and. the new version provides a
higher applicable Guidelines: sentencing range than.the version. in place at the time ofthe
offense.”’). An, ex post facto violation, is an ex post facto violation regardless of whether the:
increased.penalty resulted from.a change in the statute ora change in the Guidelines. Hence, if
the end date of:the offense conduct dictates whether it is permissible to apply a later Guidelines
book consistent with.the.x Post /aelo Clause, the jury must.find that fact.

Here, the S2 Indictment alleges only that-the criminal conduct ended “in-or about 2004”
and docs not specify whether the conduct continued. into’ November and December 2004. ‘Nor.
was the jury asked to'make a specific finding’as to the end date of the offense conduct. Because
the jury did:not make the necessary factual finding, the Court cannot apply the 2004 Guidelines:

B. The Trial Record Is Insufficient to Support'a Fiiding‘that the Offense
Conduct Continued Past. November ‘1, 2004.

Even if the Court can determine the end date of the offense conduct. for Guidelines

purposes, the record does not support a. finding that the conduct: extended. past November 1,

3 A Ithough.the issue is:properly .framed.as an.ex post facto issue, it would.also violate: Ms. Maxwell's: Sixth
Amendment-rights.for the Court, and not theyury, to determine when the offense conduct ended. See Apprendi +.
NewJersey, 530. 0S. 466 (2000): Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004); United-States v. Booker, 543. GS.
220 (2005): see also Julian, 427 E.3dat 482 (failure to’have'the:jury determine the end date of:the conspiracy for ex
post facto purposes was a violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights).
