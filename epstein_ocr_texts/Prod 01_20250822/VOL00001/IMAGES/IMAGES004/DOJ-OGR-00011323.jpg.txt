[__] is justifiably worried that she, will be denounced and ostracized. by ‘her.

‘colleagues should it'become a mater of public record that she testified.atthe request.of Ms.

Maxwell’s defense team. Séeé;, e:g-, United States v. Marti, 421, F.2d.1263, 1266 (2d Cir. 1970)
(proper. for court.to. preclude defense: from revealing witness’s address when that information
“may. subject the witness fo reprisals”). Her testimony in this case, if revealed, presents.a, real
threat to her eniployment. See Vnited States v. Mareiis, No. 05, CR 457 (ARR), 2007 WL
330388, at *1 (E-D.N-Y. Jan. 3:1, 2007) (pscudonymity may be appropriate “to avert-loss of
employment potentially resulting from. trial publicity”).
