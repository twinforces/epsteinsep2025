HE is justifiably worried that she will be denounced and ostracized by her
colleagues should it become a mater of public record that she testified at the request of Ms.
Maxwell’s defense team. See, e.g., United States v. Marti, 421 F.2d 1263, 1266 (2d Cir. 1970)
(proper for court to preclude defense from revealing witness’s address when that information
“may subject the witness to reprisals”). Her testimony in this case, if revealed, presents a real
threat to her employment. See United States v. Marcus, No. 05 CR 457 (ARR), 2007 WL
330388, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Jan. 31, 2007) (pseudonymity may be appropriate “to avert loss of
employment potentially resulting from trial publicity”).
