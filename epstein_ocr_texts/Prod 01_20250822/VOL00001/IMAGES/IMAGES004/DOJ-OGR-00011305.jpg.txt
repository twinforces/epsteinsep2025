avoid. any potential. confusion by the jury.

The Government respectfully. objects to the second. proposed limiting instruction! and.
submits that such.an instruction should not be given. As an-initial ‘matter, the Government, beliéves

Lanticipate that:you-will hear testimony from the next witness about-sexual, conduct

it. However, you may not consider this testimony as.any:kind ‘of reflection on Mr.
Epstein’s. nor Ms. :Maxwell’s. character or-propensity to commit any of the crimes
charged inthe Indictment.
