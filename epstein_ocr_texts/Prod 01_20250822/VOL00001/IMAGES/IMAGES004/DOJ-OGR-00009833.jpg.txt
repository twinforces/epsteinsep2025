‘interviewed ‘by the Court; the parties were permitted to propose questions before and. during the

That course of action is especially appropriate here for several reasons. First, the subject.

inadmissible subjects. The Court. should exercise: its discretion. to supervise the hearing by’
conducting'the questioning itself.

2. The Scope. of the Hearing Should Be Limited

The scope ofthe hearing should be tightly limited to “only what is absolutely. necessary to
determine: the facts with precision.” /anniello, 866 F.2d at'544; sce also Sun. Myung Moon, 718
F.2d at 1234; Gagnon, 282/F. App’ x.at:-40."* Here, the only issues relevant under. McDonough are
whether Juror.50 intentionally licd in response to Question 48, and whether Juror 50 was actually’

biased against the defendant. ‘No. other subjects are appropriate for inquiry;"°

Tn particular, Juror $0: cannot be asked. to testify about what was said. by any juror (including
him) in the:jury room, or what his mental ‘process was as a,deliberating juror. He also cannot be
asked whcther ‘he or any other juror, discussed, personal experiences with, sexual abuse during

voir dire statements ‘about, his social media, use and. accordingly a. hearing regarding such
statements is not.warranted. Similarly, as, discussed. above, the defendant has also ‘not. met. her:
burden with réspect to Whether Juror 50, answered Quéstion 25 incorrectly, namely, whether Juror
50 considers himsclfto be:a-victim of'a crime. However, in:the event that Juror 50’s testimony:at.
the hearing regarding Question.48 makes clear. that Juror 50 answered. Question 25 incorrectly as
well, the Government ‘would,-consent to’ the Court questioning Juror 50 regarding that, question.

However, that questioning should be limited in the same manner, as discussed, throughout with,
respect. to, Question 48.
