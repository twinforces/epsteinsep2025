Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document675-2 Filed 06/25/22 Page3of5
Maxwell put me on a strict Atkin's diet while simultaneously sending me to a psychiatrist who
prescribed anti-depressants (among other drugs I did not need) that caused weight gain.

It was a classic no-win situation, and they knew it, precisely what human traffickers seek. I
never lost the weight, my application was never good enough, and it never got submitted.

I thank Almighty God that, in 2007, I managed to escape the horror by fleeing for my life to
the UK.

Since then, I have been coping with the daily all-consuming fear that someday Epstein and
Maxwell would harm me, my loved ones and my family, as Epstein repeatedly told me would
happen, if I ever dared to leave.

I frequently experience flashbacks and wake up in a cold sweat from nightmares reliving the
awful experience. I am hypervigilant, experience dramatic mood changes, and avoid certain places,
situations and people. I will sometimes start crying uncontrollably and without apparent reason. I
have worked hard with several mental health professionals who have diagnosed me with extreme
symptoms of anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, PTSD, and tendencies to self-harm.

Despite my earnest eftort, I have not realized my God-given potential professionally or
entered healthy personal relationships. I have never married and do not have children, something

I always wished for, even as a little girl. I shy away from strangers and have difficulty making
new friends because I fear they could be associated with Epstein, Maxwell and the enablers.

To this day, I attend AA meetings, but I have had numerous relapses and know that only by
the grace of God do I continue to live. I have attempted suicide twice since the abuseâ€”both near-
fatal.
