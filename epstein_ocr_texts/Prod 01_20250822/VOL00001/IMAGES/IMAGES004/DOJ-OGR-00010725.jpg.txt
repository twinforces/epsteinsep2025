Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

This letter is submitted in response to the motion and exhibits filed by counsel for Sarah
Ransome and Elizabeth Stein, requesting permission for both individuals to give oral victim impact
statements during Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing hearing. See Dkt. 675, 675-1, 675-2. We oppose the motion
for the reasons stated in our previous submissions on this issue and incorporated herein (Dkt. 667, 672):
Neither Ms. Ransome nor Ms. Stein qualify as statutory crime victims under the CVRA. The motion
should be denied in its entirety.

Very truly yours,
/s/
BOBBI C. STERNHEIM
