1! share evidence with law enforcement, thus

2} positioning the program as a potential means

3} to conceal criminal activity, close quote. I

4 take it that wasn't an accusation that you're |

5) trying to conceal anything, but in any event,

6) what's your view on that?

7 A. In the forty years that I've

8| designed and administered these programs, law

9| enforcement has never sought to secure any
10} civil confidential information.
11) In the church cases, the
12} Attorney General of various states have come |
13} to us and said, you know, you have a lot of
14) information about wrongdoings by Clergy and we
15| refused to--we work out with the Attorney
16| General, go see the diocese or the Church.
17| Don't come to a program where claimants,
18; individual victims have participated in a
19} program on the absolute guarantee of the
20} administrator that information that have been
21| submitted will not be disclosed to anybody.
22}; And that is a very important part of this. |
23) Claimants do not want information disclosed. |
24 Q. The program, would it respect that |
25} wish of claimants?
