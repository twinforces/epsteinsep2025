Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 692 Filed 11/22/21 Page 6of17

The Court will preclude Dr. Hall’s testimony ‘on these ‘psychological diagnoses.
Applying the considerations in. Sasso, the diagnosés have little probative value. First, the. report.
is now over 1.2.years old. ‘Courts:in this circuit regularly find:that. diagnoses. more than. 1.0 years
old lack, probative value. L.g., United, States'‘v: Bari, 750 F.2d 11.69, 1179 (2d Cir. 1:984)
(finding that more than. 10 years is too remote); United. Statés ¥. Glover, 588 F.2d 876, 878, (2d
Cir. 1978) (per, curiam) (1:2. years too remote); United States vy, Dupree, 833 F. Supp. 2d 255, 264
(E.D.N-Y. 201.1), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 706 F.3d_131, (2d.Cir. 2013) (13
years too:remote); Wnited States v. Paredes, No. 99-CR-290 (PKL), 2001 WL. 1478810, at: *1
(S.D.N.Y: Nov. 20, 2001) (“A:psychological condition from ten, years earlier, however, is likely
to be irrelevant.”). The diagnoses are therefore too remote to bear on Alleged Victim 4’s
eredibility.as a:witness. at trial.

Second, the nature ofthe conditions and their cffeet on, memory or pereeption. at the time:
of the events, in question do not favor admission. Dr. Hall’s:teport docs not delineate. clearly
which conditions existed at the time of Epstcin’s abuse, but it-appears that at least| |

(TF But at no point in-his report does: Dr. Hall suggest that these

conditions—or any other diagnosed conditions—may have affected Alleged Victim 4’s

perception of évents or her recollection of those events. Like in Sasso, “there was no indication
that [the witness] was delusional or paranoid, or had.any difficultics in memory:or perception.”
