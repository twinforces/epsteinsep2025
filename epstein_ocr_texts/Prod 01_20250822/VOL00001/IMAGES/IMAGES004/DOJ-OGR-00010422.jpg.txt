Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document662 Filed .06/15/22 Page 5 of 29

Ghislaine Maxwell respeetfully:submits this memorandum in support of her objections to
the Presenitence. Investigation Report: (“PSR”) and.her claim. that the correct: sentencing: range
under the United. States Sentencing Guidelines (‘USSG” or the “Guidclines”) is 51-63 months,
not, the 292-365 month range calculated by the U.S. Probation Office (“Probation”) in.the PSR.
As Sct forth more fully below, the lower range.is correctly calculated because (1) the 2003
Guidelines apply to.Ms. Maxwell’s offense conduct, not.the 2004 Guidelines; and.(2) the
enhancements under § 4B 1..5 (repeat and, dangerous sex offender against minors), § 3B1.1

(aggravating role), and § 2G1.3(b)(2)(B) (use of undue influence) do. not-apply."

ARGUMENT

I. The 2003. Guidelines Apply to: the Offense Conduct

Before determining the applicable sentencing range, the Court must. first resolve the
threshold isstc of whether’the. 2003 Guidelines or the.2004 Guidelines applics to. the criminal
sentencing court to apply a version of the Guidclines, that did not come: into effect until after the
criminal.conduct was complete if it provides for a higher sentencing range: See. Peugh-v. United
States, 569 U:S.,530, 532-33 (2013): (“[T]here is an ex post facto violation when a. defendant is
sentenced ‘under Guidelines promulgated after he committed his.criminal acts and the new
version provides a-higher applicable Guidelines sentencing range: than the version:in place atthe
time ofthe offense.”’).

There is no dispute that the 2004 Guidelines, which.took effeet on November 1, 2004,

call for a much harsherisentence than the 2003 Guidelines. Ifthe Court.applicd. all of the same

'-This memorandum sets ‘forth:arguments-concerning the'proper’Guidclines:calculation. Ms. Maxwell’s arguments
‘for why the Court should grant a‘substantial downward ‘variance ‘frony thezadvisory: Guidelines‘range:are addressed in.
a separate Submission entitled Sentencing: Memorandum-on Behalf of:Ghislaine Maxwell.
