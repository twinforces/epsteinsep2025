Jane’s sexual activity when she was an adult is entirely collateral to this case. Consistent
with Rule 412, the parties could not have offered independent evidence about who else participated
in Jane’s sexual activity over the age of consent. See Dore, 2013 WL 3965281, at *6 (defining
“matters which are not collateral” as “those matters which are relevant to the issues in the case and
could be independently proven.”). Accordingly, as the Government explained as part of the
litigation over Rule 412, the Government offered only brief testimony on direct about Jane’s
relationships after the age of consent in order to conclude the narrative. (See 11/10/21 Tr. at 160).
Specifically, the Government asked about five questions establishing that, after Jane moved to
New York and turned 18, she spent time with the defendant and Epstein and continued engaging
in sexualized massages. (Tr. 349-50).

The defendant proposes to do something quite different. The anticipated testimony is, at
least in part, an attempt to substantively impeach Jane on the identities of individuals with whom
she had adult sexual contact. ee

Absent Jane’s testimony on cross, it would be irrelevant and improper for the defendant to call
witnesses to say that they did not have sexual activity with Jane and the defendant. Through
