1 prepared in the basement and shipped upstairs.

2 Then you continued back to the center and we go up the
3 stairs, the second floor was pretty much a living room, to my

4 knowledge, if I remember correctly. There was really the

S main -- the floor was a living room.

6 And then once you went to the second and third floor,
7 you got into the master bedroom, guest bedrooms, as well. And
8 then it wasn't until you got to the -- I believe the sixth

9 floor -- which was where the home theater was that I set up.

10 So he had a home theater on the sixth floor, and I believe that
11 also had the residence -- it was either -- it could have been
12 the sixth floor, as far as the butler's residence, as well, for
13 them to stay.

14 Q. When Mr. Epstein was staying at this New York residence,

15 what airport did you typically fly into?

16 A. It depended upon what aircraft we were flying. At the

17 time, in general, between the timeframe you're talking -- was
18 this between '94 and --

19 Q. Yes. Thank you for clarifying. Between 1994 and 2004.
20 A. If it was between '94 and 2000, we would operate out of
21 Teterboro Airport. But if it was 2000 to 2004, Mr. Epstein had
22 purchased a Boeing 727, which is a large airliner, and we
23 weren't allowed to fly that aircraft due to weight into
24 Teterboro, so we would operate out of Newark or JFK Airport
25 with that plane.
