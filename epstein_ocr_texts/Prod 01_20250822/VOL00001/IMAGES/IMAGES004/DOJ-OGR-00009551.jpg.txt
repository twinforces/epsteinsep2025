50’s Instagram account, on:which he also ‘posted in January, 2022, after the completion of the
trial. /@. at,20. And, fourth, the screenshots proffered-match Juror 50’s description of his social
media accounts as containing only “[p]crsonal. stuff, like selfics.” Jd. The:threshold. for.a
hearing‘has not becn met on this.issuc and the Court will. not permit ‘“‘a fishing expedition” into
Juror 50’s social media usage. Moor, 718 F.2d at.1234 (quoting Wnited States. Moten, 582

D. The Defendant has not: justified ‘an inquiry into other jurors

The Defendant secks to examine not only Juror 50 at'an evidentiary hearing but also the
other cleven:members of the jury in order to identify a.sccond.juror who, according to an article
‘published by the New York 7imes, also was séxually abused.as a:minor. Maxwell Br. at 2:1, 49-
50. The Defendant further argucs that.even if the article:alone:is insufficient to order a hearing
as to the juror mentioned jin'the article, Juror 50’s post-trial statements corroborate that another.
juror discussed :sexual. abuse. during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As:explained below,
the evidence of this allegation, is inadequate to:mect the exacting standard for a hearing and the

Court denics the Defendant’s request.to examine any.jurors on this, basis.”

3 On Deceniber 31, 2021, the Court:informed the parties ‘by. sealed.order’ that a.juror had contacted court staff:about:
being approached, by. acreporter despite the fact that:the juror-had not identified. themselves publicly” and wished to:
remain anonymous. Because’ the contact ‘by. the member of the:media-had.been uninvited. by. the?j ‘juror, chanibers'
‘staff notified.all j Jurors:via email on. December 30, 20211, about the.developnient. Subsequently, on.January 5, 2022,
‘a juror: replied to the December 30 email sent by'court'staff. .In-that.reply: email, the j juror’ wrote? regarding news
reports about thezissue with Juror 50. The Courttinforied the ‘parties of: the juror communications by sealed order
on January’6,,2022. The Defendant requested‘the communications, which.the Court denied without: prejudice. See
‘Scealed-Memo Endorsement, Jan. 13, 2022.. The:-Defendant:now renews her. request on'the theory that the:
‘communications could shed light on the identity of the sccond juror:referred.to. by the. New York Limes. See
Maxwell Br. at 21 :n.L0:; Maxwell Reply at 23:n.12. Such-a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s
‘communication expressing, fear about the:media:reports and the partics responses to. Juror 50’s interviews are:not’
relevant‘to*the:current:inquiry. Nonetheless, ‘in order to:ensure a complete record, the Court will’transmit under seal.
the concerned. juror’s communications:to the: partics with-the name.and-contact information of the concerned juror
redacted.in order to protect the?juror’s privacy and: prevent:juror harassment. SeeJunniello, 866 E:2d at 543. The
‘Courtialso includes a'subsequent communication‘with the same juror’expressing additional concerns’ so'that the:
partics:have:a complete?record of non-logistical juror’communications. ‘The Court will file the unredacted:
‘communications under’seal for preservation forthe appellate record.
