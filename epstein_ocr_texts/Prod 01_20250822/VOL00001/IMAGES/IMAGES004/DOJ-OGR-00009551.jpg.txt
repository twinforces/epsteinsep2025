Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document620_ Filed 02/25/22 Page10of21

50’s Instagram account, on which he also posted in January 2022, after the completion of the
trial. /d. at 20. And fourth, the screenshots proffered match Juror 50’s description of his social
media accounts as containing only “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfies.” /d. The threshold for a
hearing has not been met on this issue and the Court will not permit “a fishing expedition” into
Juror 50’s social media usage. Moon, 718 F.2d at 1234 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582
F.2d 654, 667 (2d Cir. 1978)).

D. The Defendant has not justified an inquiry into other jurors

The Defendant seeks to examine not only Juror 50 at an evidentiary hearing but also the
other eleven members of the jury in order to identify a second juror who, according to an article
published by the New York Times, also was sexually abused as a minor. Maxwell Br. at 21, 49—
50. The Defendant further argues that even if the article alone is insufficient to order a hearing
as to the juror mentioned in the article, Juror 50’s post-trial statements corroborate that another
juror discussed sexual abuse during deliberations. Maxwell Reply at 24. As explained below,
the evidence of this allegation is inadequate to meet the exacting standard for a hearing and the
Court denies the Defendant’s request to examine any jurors on this basis.°
> On December 31, 2021, the Court informed the parties by sealed order that a juror had contacted court staff about
being approached by a reporter despite the fact that the suror had not identified themselves publicly and wished to
remain anonymous. Because the contact by the member of the media had been uninvited by the juror, chambers
staff notified all jurors via email on December 30, 2021, about the development. Subsequently, on January 5, 2022,
a juror replied to the December 30 email sent by court staff. In that reply email, the juror wrote regarding news
reports about the issue with Juror 50. The Court informed the parties of the juror communications by sealed order
on January 6, 2022. The Defendant requested the communications, which the Court denied without prejudice. See
Sealed Memo Endorsement, Jan. 13, 2022. The Defendant now renews her request on the theory that the
communications could shed light on the identity of the second juror referred to by the New York Times. See
Maxwell Br. at 21 n.10; Maxwell Reply at 23 n.12. Such a request is nothing but unfounded speculation. A juror’s
communication expressing fear about the media reports and the parties’ responses to Juror 50’s interviews are not
relevant to the current inquiry. Nonetheless, in order to ensure a complete record, the Court will transmit under seal
the concerned juror’s communications to the parties with the name and contact information of the concerned juror
redacted in order to protect the juror’s privacy and prevent juror harassment. See Janniello, 866 F.2d at 543. The
Court also includes a subsequent communication with the same juror expressing additional concerns so that the
parties have a complete record of non-logistical juror communications. The Court will file the unredacted
communications under seal for preservation for the appellate record.
