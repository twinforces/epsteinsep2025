Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The defense requests a two-day extension to file Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing submission.
Sentencing is scheduled for June 28, 2022. Currently, the defense submission is due June 15 and
the government submission is due June 22.

I will be out of the country on June 15 in connection with a pre-COVID commitment,
returning to New York on the evening of June 16. I am requesting permission to file Ms.
Maxwell’s submission on June 17 and for the government to file on June 24.

The government consents to this request. No previous application has been made.

Your consideration is greatly appreciated.

Very truly yours,
/s/
Bobbi C. Sternheim
