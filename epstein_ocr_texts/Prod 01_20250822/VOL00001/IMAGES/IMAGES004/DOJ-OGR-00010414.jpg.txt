Re: United. States'v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20'Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully moves for the exclusion. of tiie for Counts Seven and Eight.
under. the Speedy Trial. Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(c)(1), until June 28, 2022—the scheduled date of
sentencing. Although the Government currently ‘intends to move to dismiss these counts at:
sentencing, as.it has. previously stated (sée Dkt: No. 574), the, Government. sécks this éxélusion. of
time in an. abundance of' caution, so the Act: docs not preclude prosecution. in the unlikely event an.
intervening development: occurs, between now and sentencing which causes the Government. to
reconsider that position. Such an exclusion promotes the ends of justice by obviating any:need for

the parties and the Court toprepare for a second. trial which, barring unforeseen developments,

will-‘not occur, Sée 18 US.C. §'3161(h)(7)(A). Defense: counsel consénts to this ¢xclusion.
