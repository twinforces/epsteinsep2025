134:15-22 (stating during voir dire that, Juror $0 had:no doubt about his ability to be fair to both
sides and that he did not. have any reason. to think he could. not be fair and inipartial)). Juror 50’s
hearing testimony is further corroborated by the fact that jury deliberations lasted. for five days,
during which time'the jury asked 'a:number of questions of the Court, sought transcripts ofa large
volume.of trial testimony, and ultimately rendered a split verdict by declining to find the-defendant
responsible for Count Two. See Greer, 285 F.3d. at ‘171 (“The court ...... noted thatthe outcome of
‘the trial demonstrated that. all the jurors . .. fairly considered the cvidence:”). These objective
facts indicate that the jury remained.impartial.

The defendant’s failure to demonstrate ‘actual bias is. fatal to her motion. (See Dkt. No.,643

implied orinferred.bias:may be considered in.this,context)). But even if the Court:were'to consider:

33). The defendant’s argument:misapprchends both the facts andthe law. The Second Circuit has
rejected. the notion that. similarity of conduct is a’proper basis to make’a. finding of mandatory,
implied bias, and the circumstances here do not fall within the extrémely narrow’ categories of
implied bias thatthe Second Circuit has. recognized. (See Dkt. No. 643 at 24-27). Moreover, the
manner in which the Court. handled the voir dire of prospective jurors who reported, having
experienced sexual. abuse makes clear that' the Court. would not have. made a finding of implied.

bias. (See id, at 27-28). And in,any event, Juror 50’s testimony at.the hearing demonstrated that
