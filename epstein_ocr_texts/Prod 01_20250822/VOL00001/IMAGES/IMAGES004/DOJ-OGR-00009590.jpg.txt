1. Offenses Charged.

Turning to'the first Korfant factor, the “criminal offenses Charged,” Counts Three and Five
plainly charge different. criminal offenses ‘under 18 U.S.C. §371. In. particular, Count. Three is
predicated, on, 1.8 U.S.C..§ 2423(a), 'a-provision. of the Mann Act;that:makes it a.crime to transport.
minors ‘for illegal. sexual activity, whereas. Count Five. is predicated. on. 18 U.S.C. § 1591, a.
provision, of the Trafficking ‘Victims Protection, Act that makes it a crime to traffic minors’ for
commercial sex acts. As, charged ‘in the S2 Indictment, these counts have different legal objects:
‘Count Three concerned transporting girls-under the age ‘of seventeen to: New York for. purposes of
sexual abuse in violation, of New York Penal Law § 130.55,.and Count Five concerned:commercial
sex acts with girls under the age of eighteen.

When.two counts charge conspiracies. under §'371, “[s]imilarity at this general. level . . . is
of limited import,” where the objects of the conspiracics. differ. Wnited States 'v., Villa, No. 12 Cr.
40 (JBA), 2014 WL 252013, at*4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22, 2014), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 716 (2d Cir. 2018)
(quoting Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669). For ‘example, in Villa, the district. court concluded that, under
the first. Korfant factor; two § 371 offenses were distinct, because the aim of one count ‘was “to
commit theft from an ‘interstate. shipment and. to transport stolen property: across: state. lines,”
whereas the other conspiracy was “to sell stolen property.” Jd. Similarly, in United States v,
Sattar, Judge: Kocltl. concluded, that two conspiracies charged, undér § 371, were distinct under
Korfant,.in part. because the two counts. “charge a separate conspiracy under the: defraud. ‘clause
and the offense clause of § 371, respectively.” Unifed States ’v; Satfar, 314.F. Supp. 2d 279, 308

(S.D.N.Y. 2004), aff'd sub nom. Unitéd States ¥. Stewart, 590.F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2009).
