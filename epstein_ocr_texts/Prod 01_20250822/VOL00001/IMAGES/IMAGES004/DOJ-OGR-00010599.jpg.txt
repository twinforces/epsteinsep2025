victims to be heard, Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding should not be an open-mike forum for
any alleged victim.

Impact statements by alleged victims who did not testify, were not referenced in the
record as victims, or do not qualify as “crime victims” under the CVRA should be published
during the sentencing proceeding or have their statements included in the record. While the
Congressional Record is silent on this issue, it is hard to believe that Congress intended the
CVRA to give voice to anyone and everyone who claims to be a victim but does not qualify
under the statute and whose accusations have not been verified. A high-profile case, such as this,
becomes a lightning rod for individuals to come forward, especially where to do so may yield
financial reward and media attention. Such an open forum would have significant and adverse
consequences to any criminal defendant facing the most critical stage of the case: sentencing and
deprivation of liberty.

Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding should not a bully pulpit for anyone
who was not identified as a victim of the charged federal offenses and does not qualify as such
under the CVRA. We urge the Court to undertake its role as gatekeeper to ensure that Ms.
Maxwell’s rights are not trampled by individuals who are not statutory victims or by the nights
afforded to legitimate victims under the CVRA. To ensure that the appropriate balance of rights
is achieved, those who qualify under the CVRA offenses should have the right to be heard but
their statements should be in accordance with redactions and rulings made by the Court.

Because the Individuals do not meet the definition of "crime victims" under the CVRA, they
should not be permitted to give oral testimony or have their written victim impact statements
read during sentencing.
