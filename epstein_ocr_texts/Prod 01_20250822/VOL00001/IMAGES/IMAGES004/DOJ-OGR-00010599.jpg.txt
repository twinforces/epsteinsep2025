‘victims to be heard, Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding should:not be an open-mike ‘forum for
any alleged victim.

Impact statements by alleged victims who did not testify, were not referenced. in the
record as'victims, or do not qualify as “crime victims” under'the CVRA should. be ‘published
during the sentencing, proceeding or have their statements included in:the record. While:the
‘Congressional, Record iis silent on this issue, it is hard’to belicve'that; Congress intended, the:
CVRA to give Voice to anyone and. everyone who Claims to, be avictim but does not qualify
‘under the statute and whose accusations have not’been verified. A. high-profile case, such as'this,
becomes, a lightning rod for individuals to. come: forward, especially. where to do'so’may: yield.
financial reward.and media attention. Such an. open forum would have significant and adverse
consequences to any criminal defendant facing the most critical, stage of the case: sentencing and
‘deprivation of liberty.

‘Ms. Maxwmell’s sentencing. proceeding should not a bully pulpit for anyone
who-was not identified as a victim ofthe charged federal. offenses ‘and. does not-qualify as such,
‘under the CVRA. We urge, the Court to undertake its role as gatekeeper to crisure. that Ms.
Maxwell’s rights are not trampled by individuals who are: not statutory’victims or’by the rights
afforded to legitimate victims under the CVRA. To ensure that-the appropriate balance of rights
‘is achieved, those who qualify under the CVRA offenses should have-the right to' be heard but
their:statements should. be in.aecordance with redactions and. rulings ‘made by the Court.
Because the Individuals do not mect'the definition. of "crime victims" undér the CVRA, they
should:not be:permitted to give oral testimony..or have their written. victim impact statements

read, during sentencing.
