RE: Ghislaine Maxwell
Case No.: 20-Cr-330 (AJN)
Dear Ms. Menninger and Ms. Sternheim,

I am performing an ongoing forensic psychiatric evaluation of Ms. Maxwell to assess
whether any psychological matters are present that might be relevant to the disposition of her
criminal matters. In this letter, I address her current mental state and risk of flight in light of
an pending bail application.

T have met with Ms. Maxwell on numerous (14) occasions, from October 2020 to the
present via telephone interview, video teleconference, and one in-person meeting at
Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) on April 22, 2021. During those meetings, I reviewed
her personal, social, educational, vocational, and psychiatric histories. I performed a mental
status examination to assess her intelligence, thought processes, cognitive functioning,
memory, credibility, orientation, judgment, insight, and impulse control. I reviewed numerous
legal correspondences between Ms. Maxwell’s legal counsel, MDC legal, and the Honorable
Alison J. Nathan. Additionally, I conducted a collateral interview with Ms. Leah Saftian, part
of Ms. Maxwell’s legal counsel and a longtime acquaintance, on July 16, 2021, to gain insight
into Ms. Maxwell’s current level of functioning. The limits of confidentiality inherent to such
an evaluation were explained to Mr. Maxwell.
