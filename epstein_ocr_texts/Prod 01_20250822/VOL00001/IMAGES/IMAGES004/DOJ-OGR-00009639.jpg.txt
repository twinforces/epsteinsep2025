Proposed Questions
A. Questions to Determine the Nature of Juror 50’s Sexual Abuse and Whether Juror
50’s Responses to Questions 48 and 25 of the Jury Questionnaire Were False
Under the McDonough test, the Court must first determine whether Juror 50’s responses to
Questions 48 and 25 were, in fact, false as reflected in his post-trial statements to the media.
United States v. Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 303 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing McDonough Power Equipment,
Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556 (1984)). It is also necessary for the Court to inquire about
the nature of the sexual abuse that Juror 50 experienced. Had Juror 50 disclosed in response to
Question 48 that he was the victim of sexual abuse, he would have had to explain the nature of
that abuse in his response to the very next question. See Question 48a. Furthermore, it is
important for the Court to explore the specifics of Juror 50’s sexual abuse to determine how
similar his experience was to the experiences of the witnesses who testified at trial. See United
States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 472 (S.D.N.Y. 2012) (“Courts imply bias ‘when there
are similarities between the personal experiences of the juror and the issues being litigated.’”
(quoting United States v. Sampson, 820 F. Supp. 2d 151, 163-64 (D. Mass. 2011)). Accordingly,
the defense requests that the Court ask Juror 50 the following questions:
1. The Independent and the Daily Mail reported that you said you were the victim of
sexual abuse when you were child, correct?
2. Did you say that?
3. So, itis accurate that you claim to have been a victim of sexual abuse when you were
under the age of consent?
4. How old were you when you were sexually abused?
