Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

In response to a letter from Juror 50’s counsel indicating the juror’s intention to assert the Fifth
Amendment privilege against self-incrimination at the upcoming hearing (Dkt. 624), the government has
informed the Court that it is in the process of making an application for a grant of immunity for the
juror. (Dkt. 625). Juror 50 has publicly stated that he “answered all questions honestly.” Ms. Maxwell
requests a proffer from Juror 50’s counsel explaining the basis for his client’s assertion of the Fifth
Amendment and the government’s willingness to provide immunity to Juror 50.

Very truly yours,
BOBBI C. STERNHEIM
