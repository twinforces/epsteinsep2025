NEW YORK, Jan 5 (Reuters) - During jury deliberations after the trial of British socialite
Ghislaine Maxwell, some jurors initially doubted the accounts of two of her accusers, one
member of the jury said on Tuesday night.
This juror, who asked to be identified only by his first and middle names, said some of the jurors
had issues with the credibility of witnesses known as Jane and Carolyn, two of the four women
who testified that Maxwell set them up with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein as teenagers.
He said that after some of the jurors questioned the accuracy of the two women's memories, he
decided to share his own experience of being sexually abused as a child. He said that he
remembered most important elements of what happened to him, but not every single detail.
That swayed some jurors, he said.

"When | shared that, they were able to sort of come around on, they were able to come around
on the memory aspect of the sexual abuse," Scotty David, a 35-year-old Manhattan resident,
told Reuters in a phone interview. He gave an earlier interview to The Independent.
He added that coming to a unanimous verdict "wasn't easy, to be honest."
"There's a room of 12 people and we all have to be on the same page and we all have to
understand what's going on," he said. "And then we have to agree. So that's partly why it took
so long."
Maxwell, 60, was convicted on Dec. 29 of recruiting and grooming teenage girls for sexual
encounters with Epstein. The conviction followed five full days of deliberations.
