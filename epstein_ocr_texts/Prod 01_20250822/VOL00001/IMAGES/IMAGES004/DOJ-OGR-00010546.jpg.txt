taking her to the movies and on shopping outings. (PSR 4 32). The defendant and Epstein gave
Jane gifts, and Jane came to look up to the defendant like an older sister figure. (PSR 4] 32-33).

The defendant and Epstein abused that relationship of trust in the worst way imaginable.
They sexually abused Jane starting when she was just 14 years old, and the sexual abuse continued
for years. (PSR § 36). When Jane was still only 14 years old, the defendant and Epstein instructed
Jane to follow them to Epstein’s bedroom where the defendant and Epstein fondled each other,
casually giggling about it, while Epstein asked Jane to take her top off. (PSR § 34). While this
was happening, “there were hands everywhere,” Epstein began to masturbate, and the defendant
rubbed, kissed, and fondled Epstein. (/d.). After this initial sexual interaction, the defendant and
Epstein continued to sexually abuse Jane. (PSR § 35). The defendant and Epstein taught Jane
how Epstein liked to be massaged and gave Jane instructions about touching Epstein’s penis. (/d.).
Jane was 14 years old, and the defendant tried to make Jane feel like this was “very normal” and
“not a big deal.” (/d.). Jane was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein between the ages of 14
and 16 years old, and the defendant was frequently in the room when the abuse happened. (PSR
36). Over time, the abuse escalated, and Epstein used vibrators on Jane, masturbated, put his
fingers in Jane’s vagina, and asked Jane to straddle his face. U/d.). The defendant sometimes
touched Jane during these incidents; in particular, Jane recalled that the defendant touched her
breasts. (/d.). The sexual abuse was not limited to Palm Beach, Florida, as Jane traveled with the
defendant and Epstein to Epstein’s townhouse in New York City and his ranch in New Mexico.
(PSR § 37). Jane was sexually abused during those trips. (/d.).
