purpose of this testimony is that 'these are illegal acts that

they're talking about, and unless. they're instructed otherwise
by the Court, they may convict Ms. Maxwell on dn improper
basis, which is that this. witness.'s testimony is talking about
illegal Sexual, activity, as that's chargéd inf ‘the indictment.
Sq there has to be a clarification ‘on this point.

And I just would note, your Honor, the redson why

we're here in this position is because the government has
chosen to add Accuser 2, Accuser 3, people who. have néthing to
do with, violations of New York, law, in, this conspinacy, and, if
they're going to do that and you try to use that as evidence of

a violation of New York Law —-

THE COURT: Well, the charge is enticement. And, in

my mind, this witness is in a very different ‘position ‘than,
witness 3.

MR. EVERDELL: Yes.
THE COURT: But it's certainly relevant evidence to

the enticement. charge with respect to New York, law. There's no

déubt. about that.

But, I agree, we have to make sure that the juny
understands, though it can be relevant evidence for that, if
they want to take it, into account for whatever they want, to
take it into account for; what they can't take it into account
for is itself, the New Mexico activity -- sexual activity as
itself illegal. conduct charged in the indictment.
