Ii. Conclusion

The Court therefore grants the Government’s motion to preclude Dr. Hall’s expert
testimony. Because this is a preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and
circumstances at trial would alter the Court’s analysis. In that event, the Defense must re-raise
its request to admit Dr. Hall as an expert witness.

SO ORDERED.
