roles played by those’participants, significantly favors the Defendant,as to the second Korfant

The Government responds that the Count. Five conspiracy included Sarah Kellen, who
was not involved.in Count Three. Yct; Kellen, reecived, far, less attention than. other conspirators
in:the. Government’s cas¢, being :mentioned-only briefly in. the Government’s opening statement.
and closing arguments. £.g., Trial Tr. at 2876 (noting, “and sometimes Sarah Kellen would call,
‘too’’). Conspiracies often change membership: without. forming a‘:new; distinct conspiracy,
particularly if key:members of the conspiracy remain.over the course of a:decade. See United

Galderone, 982 F.2d.42, 47 (2d-Cir, 1992). The Government’s attempt to minimize this factor
by noting’that:most overt: acts for Count: Three occurred in, the 1990s is simply not:reflected. in
this circuit’s case law. See, ¢.g.,,Macchia, 35 F.3d at 669 (focusing onthe overlap in time frame
alleged in the:indictment). The overlap in time here raises the inference’that, one conspiracy
wholly encompasses the other, and that inference tips in the Defendant’s favor. Sée Araujo,
2018 WL 3222527, at: *6.

Similarity of operations. Counts Three and Five involve significant similarities ‘in,
operations. The methods by which,the Defendant groomed and facilitated the sexual abuse. of
minor victims: was a‘central, focus of, both partics’ cases at-trial. The Goyernment called as an.
