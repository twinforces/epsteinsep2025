of these provide any likelihood, much less a substantial likelihood, that the jury convicted the
defendant solely because she intended for Jane to be sexually abused in New Mexico.
a. Jane’s Testimony About Sexual Abuse in New Mexico

Jane’s testimony about her abuse in New Mexico cannot provide the basis for any
constructive amendment argument. That testimony was entirely proper. As the Court recognized,
the evidence of Jane’s abuse in New Mexico was relevant to the jury’s decision on the Mann Act
counts. (Tr. 3149-50; see Dkt. No. 566 at 5 n.1 (stating that the defense does “not contest that
alleged sexual activity that occurred in other states can be evidence of [the Mann Act]
conspiracies”)). That evidence was probative of the defendant’s knowledge that Epstein was
having sexual encounters with Jane while she was a minor and that the abuse occurred while
traveling to Epstein’s various properties; and it was probative of the defendant’s role in facilitating
the abuse. This evidence “fell squarely within the charged scheme” and “‘was entirely consistent
with the indictment,” and was “thus no constructive amendment.” United States v. Jones, 847 F.
App’x 28, 30 (2d Cir. 2021); see Gross, 2021 WL 4685111, at *28 (noting that if the jury
determined that “inarguably relevant” evidence “described a different conspiracy, the jury
instructions ensured that the jury would not convict Gross of this other conspiracy”). Indeed, that
evidence was no less relevant and proper than evidence of Jane’s abuse in Florida, or evidence of
Annie, Kate, Carolyn, and Virginia’s abuse at Epstein’s properties outside New York—none of
enhancing the risk of conviction based on that conduct. But the Court did not give such an
instruction, since the Government proceeded only on the theory that it had to prove an intent to
violate New York law.
