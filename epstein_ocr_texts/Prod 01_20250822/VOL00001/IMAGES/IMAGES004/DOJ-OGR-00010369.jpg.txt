the Government argued. and.proved at trial, employed a single “playbook” to groom and sexually

Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the Court from.imposing multiple’punishments. for the same
offense, the Court will enter judgment on Count Three alone among:the conspiracy'counts. This
legal conclusion, in no: way calls into question the factual, findings made’by’the jury. ‘Rather, jit
