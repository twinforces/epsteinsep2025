alleged, to bé a Victim in this case. Nonetheless, she séttled
her claim with the fund. for three and-a-quarter million

dollars. She dssistéd the government dnd she will be here.

And. in. turn, that assisted her claim. But she's also seeking
assistance ‘from the government to Help her to get d wisa, a
special visa for government witnesses.

Now, ‘threé and a quarter million dollars is a lot of
money, but it cannot buy you a visa, And maybe her testimony
will. You, will evaluate that.

Now, the last accuser is Carolyn. And admittedly, she

had a troubled past, lived a dangerous lifestyle, was using

drugs. during the period, of tume that she interacted, with
Epstein.

Let ime just. stop for a second.

There's a different time period that. we're in now, We
ane now in, about. 2002, whereas Jane, Annie, and, Kate were in
the mid té late '90s.

Carolyn was introduced, to Epstein, not by Ghislaine, iby
a woman named Virginia Roberts, Roberts was paid by Epstein to

recruat females for him to get massages. She offered the

opportunity to6 Carolyn to meet Epstein, and Carolyn readily
agreed. The evidence that you will hear with megard to
Carolyn, which relate to the trafficking Charges in Counts Five
and Six, counts that only relate to Carolyn, had nothing to do
with Ghislaine.
