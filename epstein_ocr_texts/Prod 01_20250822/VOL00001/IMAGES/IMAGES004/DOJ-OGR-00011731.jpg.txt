LBTVMAX3 Opening â€”- Ms. Sternheim

1 alleged to be a victim in this case. Nonetheless, she settled
2 her claim with the fund for three and-a-quarter million

3 dollars. She assisted the government and she will be here.

4 And in turn, that assisted her claim. But she's also seeking

S assistance from the government to help her to get a visa, a

6 special visa for government witnesses.

7 Now, three and a quarter million dollars is a lot of

8 money, but it cannot buy you a visa. And maybe her testimony

9 will. You will evaluate that.

10 Now, the last accuser is Carolyn. And admittedly, she
11 had a troubled past, lived a dangerous lifestyle, was using

12 drugs during the period of time that she interacted with

13 Epstein.

14 Let me just stop for a second.

15 There's a different time period that we're in now. We
16 are now in about 2002, whereas Jane, Annie, and Kate were in

17 the mid to late '90s.

18 Carolyn was introduced to Epstein not by Ghislaine, by
19 a woman named Virginia Roberts. Roberts was paid by Epstein to
20 recruit females for him to get massages. She offered the
21 opportunity to Carolyn to meet Epstein, and Carolyn readily
22 agreed. The evidence that you will hear with regard to
23 Carolyn, which relate to the trafficking charges in Counts Five
24 and Six, counts that only relate to Carolyn, had nothing to do
25 with Ghislaine.
