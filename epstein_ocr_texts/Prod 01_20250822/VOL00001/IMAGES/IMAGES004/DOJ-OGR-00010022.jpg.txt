8 Q. Based on what information, actual information?

9 A. I credited her sworn voir dire responses. I went through
10 the reasoning that I described that the note in a way ruled out

12 that she was a litigant in the personal injury suit, and it
13 made no sense that a lawyer would sit in a voir dire and lie
14 that way.

15 Q, Did you read the indictment in this case, Ms. Brune?

21 A. Yes,

ats pleaded guilty were lawyers, correct?
