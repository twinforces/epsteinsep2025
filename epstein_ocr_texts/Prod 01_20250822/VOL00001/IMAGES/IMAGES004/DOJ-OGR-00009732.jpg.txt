TR at 2427. Given Juror No. 50’s. personal experience and belief about memory and its
reliability, there was no way: he could fairly cyaluate Ms. Maxwell’s: challenge to the
eredibility of her accusers’ memories or the expert.testimony: of Dr. Loftus.’°

Several. decisions. support this conclusion. In Sampson vy. United: States, for

phase hearing in‘a death penalty case after.a juror falsely denied, among other things,
having been.a Victim of'a crime. 724 F.3d at!154, 162. In fact, however, the juror

bank robbery in, which, the defendant threatened bank tellers at gunpoint. /d. “These
parallels,” the Court said, “raise a scrious concern as to whether an, ordinary person in
[the juror’s] shoes would be. able to disregard her Own experiences in. evaluating the.

intervention, people get very confident about their wrong answers, and you can see that
even wrong answers or false information, false memories can be expressed with a high
degree of confidence.” TR at 2430. :
