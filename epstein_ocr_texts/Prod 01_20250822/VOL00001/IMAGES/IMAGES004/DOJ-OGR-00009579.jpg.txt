Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 621 Filed 02/25/22 Page1/of51

That fact is compounded by the lack of clarity about. where’ the jury’ believed the scxual
activity occurred. It:is not clear whether'the flight on. which 'the “intent. was. for Jane to engage in
scxual.activity” references the flight to New Mexico, as the:defendant suggests, or the:return flight.
Iftit-is the flight to New Mexico, it would, still be probative: evidence on Count. Two, albeit. not:
sufficient for conviction. If itis a flight from, New Mexico, it ‘would also. still be probative and
would.not pose any:risk.that.the jury convicted based on. conduct occurring in New‘Mexico. And.
if the jury: thought. that: the defendant intended Jane to, engage in sexual. activity. at-the| conclusion.
ofa return flight from.New Mexico to.New York, it-could:well have been. sufficient for conviction.
on Count Two.

The issuc is further confused, by the uncertainty about'the question posed. by the jury. The:
defendant understands the question to be about whether scxual.activity:in.New.Mexico is:sufficient
to find the defendant. guilty. ‘First, the jury’s question does, not 'ask whether certain facts are:
sufficient for guilt; :it-asks ‘whether the defendant “can be found guilty’ if'a certain fact is true. The
described above. ‘That is.a:perfectly. sensible question forthe jury’to.ask=indecd, it was repeatedly’
raised by: defense.counscl to the Court attrial. (See, e.g:, Tr. 3149 (Court stating: “This is the same:
discussion, we’ ve had a, couple of times [defense counsel]. Sexual activity with respect to Jane in,
New Mexico under the age of'17 can be relévant.to an intent*to transport to New York.to engage
in. sexual activity:under the: age of.:17, 1 think. I think:this is the same: basic discussion. that weve
had. So... I think the proposal made by’ the: defense is wrong.”). And second, the question.

specifically uses the word “aided,” suggesting that the jury ‘note may.have. becii a. question about.
