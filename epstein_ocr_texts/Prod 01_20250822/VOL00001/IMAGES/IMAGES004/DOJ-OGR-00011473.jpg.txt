that I considered ‘in evaluating claims. One‘of those factors was “Whether there exists any:
information and/or pertinent. findings offered by the appropriate Office’ of the: District Attorney,
United States Attorney’s Office, or'other law enforcement agency.” (Protocol at 5-6.); The:
Protocol does not. use the:term. “credit” nor does it address what weight, if any, is afforded! to
such information in the. context of an individual! claim. That:is because‘there’was. no. formula or
point'system.or quantifiable “credit” for this factor or-any other factor in the detérmination of
individual claims. Claims were evaluated on a highly individualized analysis based on a host of
factors.and the overall totality of the circumstances. Ms.:Maxwell’s motion also states. that:
“[t]he Protocol also rewards Accusers‘who have filed:a. lawsuit, legal action or. claim:of'sexual
abuse against Epstein, or the Estate, which includes any. employees or former employees of

Epstein.” ‘This too is:inaccurate. Wher the Protocol' refers to an. individual’s “lawsuit, legal.

action or claim,” it does. so in the.context.of identifying individuals prior tothe Program’s launch,

to’'whom the. program. would! be sending claim forms, because, onthe basis of such lawsuits or

claims, the program. could identify them at the outset as-potential claimants. (Protocol.at'4.) The:

Protocol also indicates that individuals:who had not filed:a‘lawsuit or claim could also register'to
participate in,the:program, and, if: my. preliminary review determined that they were eligible to
participate, these individuals too would be:sent claim forms. The fact that this language ‘falls
under the “Claims ‘Submission Process” section of the Protocol and not:the “Claims Evaluation
and Determination” section, demonstrates the ‘purpose: for'which it was included.

I declare under. the penalty of perjury: that.the foregoing is true‘and correct.
