C2grdau4 Schoeman - cross

Hi A. Yes.

2 Q. That's what any good lawyer or investigator does when

3 somebody tells them a broad fact; you ask what supports that,
4 correct?

5 A. Tt"s the question I asked.

6 Q. Do you disagree with my proposition that a good

7 investigator or lawyer, when somebody gives them a broad

8 proposition, asks the follow-up question, what is that based
3 on?

10 A. I don't disagree with it.

11 Q. Did you ask Ms. Trzaskoma what had led her to conclude or
12 what led to her belief that there was a possible connection
13 between Juror No, 1 and the suspended attorney?
14 A. I think she told me that there was someone with the same
15 name as Juror No. 1. I don't recall whether we actually used
16 the person's name. Then, as I described, I asked questions
17 about why she had determined it was not the same person, and
18 the answer was based on the voir dire responses.
ae Q. Is it correct that you didn't ask any other follow-up
20 questions that led to her initial belief that there was a
eal connection between Juror No. 1 and the suspended attorney?
22 A. I think all she told me was that they had the same name,
23 and I inferred that that was the basis of her considering it
24 possible that they were the same person,
rae Q. Did she tell you that they had the same middle initials?
