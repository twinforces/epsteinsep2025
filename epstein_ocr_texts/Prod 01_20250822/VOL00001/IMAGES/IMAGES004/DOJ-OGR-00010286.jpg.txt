repeatedly, and the Court agreed, that, evidence of travel. to'locations other than New York, and
sexual abuse that,occurréd in thosé locations, was relevant‘to the Mann. Act conspiracies. Asa.
result, the jury heard.a great. deal. of testimony from. Jane, Kate, and Annic Farmer, as well as
other evidence, about conduct that:took place in/Epstein’s residences, in New Mexico, London,
the U.S. Virgin Islands, aiid, of course, Florida. Indeed, a large portion of Janc’s testimony,
which was relevant to the: Mann Act conspiracies, described incidents of sexual abuse in,

C. Common Overt Acts

The government. argues that the lack: of common overt acts between Count Three and.
Count Five indicates that‘they were different.conspiracies. (Opp. at 30). As:we explained in. our
initial Motion, bécause Count Five’was' based on, Carolyn’s allegations and did fiot involve Jane,
Kate, or Annie Farmer, that count alleged overt acts specific to Carolyn; that:were not alleged:in
Count Three. (Mot. at 24: Ind. 4] 25a-d, 19a-c). Nevertheless, because the conspiracy: charged
