Moreover, there can be no real, concern, as the defendant claims, that. providing Juror 50
with his questionnaire will. “color” Juror ‘50’s ‘testimony and, interfere ‘with the integrity of a.
hearing. (Def. Mem. at 53). Should ‘the: Court. decide to conduct a. limited hearing, as the
Government has'proposed,the Court. will, undoubtedly ‘ask Juror 50 about-his questionnaire. Juror:
S0 should have access to his oWn questionnaire in advance of any:such. hearing so that he can speak:
with ‘his counsel, and assess whether he plans to invoke his:rights under the Fifth Amendment.
More broadly: speaking, “[t]he object. of the-proceeding is to’permit-the truth to, be discovered with,
the Icast possible harm. to other interests.” Gagnon, 282:F. App’x at 40. ‘That endeavor is not
furthered. by surprising Juror 50 on the stand with a.document he does not seem to recall with
specificity. See Juror 50 Mem. at. 4 (stating that. Juror 50 “does not ‘recall. answering questions [in
the questionnairc] regarding, his prior experience with. sexual assault”). To-deny Juror 50. access
to his own document; means, practically ‘speaking, that after being shown the: questionnaire and,
asked questions about the document at a hearing, Juror SO will riced ‘to speak with his. counsel,

To the extent Juror50’s motion seeks leave to submit briefing on.the merits of this ‘inquiry,
the Government. agrees with the defendant that Juror $0 need not be permitted to intervene or be
heard.on the scope of the Court’s inquiry, at lcast;not at this juncture., The partics are well situated.
to brief the appropriate scope: of any hearing, without.intervention from-the witness at that hearing.
However, if the:Court does authorize the subpoenas compelling production. of Juror 50’s
communications and other ‘information—though it:should not, forthe: reasons set forth, above—
Juror 50 should-have an opportunity to move'to quash those, subpoenas. Sec, ¢.g:, City of Almaty,
