VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH STEIN TO BE READ AT THE
SENTENCING OF GHISLAINE MAXWELL

I came to New York in 1991 at the age of 18 to attend FIT and immediately began to excel
academically. While at FIT, I took advantage of different volunteer opportunities and internships in
the fashion industry to provide a foundation for my career. In my sophomore year, I accepted a
Christmastime internship at Henri Bendel, New York. I performed well and was asked to stay on as
a part-time employee. I worked at Henri Bendel until graduation.

In the fall semester of my senior year at FIT Ghislaine Maxwell came into the store, where
she was a frequent customer. Her usual salesperson wasn’t there so I helped her. Ghislaine was
electrifying and we hit it off immediately. In this first meeting we spoke of our mutual love of fashion,
of difficult fathers and formal upbringings, of boyfriends and of how we both saw New York as a
chance to start over. She told me that her boss (who I later came to understand was Jeffrey Epstein)
was Close friends with Les Wexner, the CEO and Founder of The Limited, which owned Henri Bendel
at the time. When she completed her purchases, I offered to deliver them to her, so she didn’t have
to carry them around all day. This was a courtesy I frequently extended to my high-end clients. Later
that day, I called her office for delivery instructions and was told to bring them to the Pierre Hotel
close by the store. When I arrived, the hotel concierge told me Ms. Maxwell was in the bar and wanted
me to meet someone. It was Jeftrey Epstein. That night in the hotel was the first of many times they
sexually assaulted me.

Afterwards, I tried to pretend everything was normal. I returned to my classes at FIT and
continued work at Henri Bendel, but I started to crack. I failed a course that was necessary for my
degree and had to retake it to get my diploma.
