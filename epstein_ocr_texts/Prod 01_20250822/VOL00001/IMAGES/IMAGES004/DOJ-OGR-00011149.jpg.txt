Woods, 547 F.. Supp.,2d.253, 266-67 (S.DN.Y. 2008) (quoting United States v. Roldan-Zapata,
916 F.2d 795, 806 (2d Cir. 1990)). The Court therefore concludes that the minimal probative
value of cach of Dr..Hall’s diagnoses of Alleged. Victim. 4:is substantially outweighed by the risk
of unfair prejudice.

But'this balaricing of Rules.401 and 403 is. based.on.the:present record. It is conceivable
that an additional proffer from the Defense that raises the probative valuc of a diagnosis, such as

that fof], Would change the Court’s calculation. Gf: George, 532

F.3d at 937 (“We do not. foreclose the possibility that testimony by an expert... . could have:

shown evidence of [the witness’s] condition to be relevant.to her-eredibility, ....... But. without
such testimony; [defense] counsel had only words such as ‘episodes of rage’ and ‘racing
thoughts.’”); Hamlett, 2021 WL'S 105861, at *2 (affirming exclusion. of.a psychological witness

It'is, of course, within the proper:scope of cross-examination to determine

whether a’ witness was under the influence of drugs. or:nareotics or'aleohol ‘at the

time of observation of events in dispute or at the time the ‘witness is testifying. As

Wigmore points out, however, a general habirof intémperance tells us nothing of

the witness’s testimonial incapacity-unless it involves actual intoxication at the

time of the: event obseryed or at'the time of testifying.
