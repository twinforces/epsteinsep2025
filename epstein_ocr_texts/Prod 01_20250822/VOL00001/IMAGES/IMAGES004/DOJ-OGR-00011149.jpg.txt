Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document692_ Filed 11/22/21 Page11of17
Woods, 547 F. Supp. 2d 253, 266-67 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (quoting United States v. Roldan-Zapata,
916 F.2d 795, 806 (2d Cir. 1990)). The Court therefore concludes that the minimal probative
value of each of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses of Alleged Victim 4 is substantially outweighed by the risk
of unfair prejudice.

But this balancing of Rules 401 and 403 is based on the present record. It is conceivable
that an additional proffer from the Defense that raises the probative value of a diagnosis, such as
that mam 6—ti<i‘“‘—s~i‘;é‘~*@r would change the Court’s calculation. Cf George, 532
F.3d at 937 (“We do not foreclose the possibility that testimony by an expert . . . could have
shown evidence of [the witness’s] condition to be relevant to her credibility .... But without
such testimony, [defense] counsel had only words such as ‘episodes of rage’ and ‘racing
thoughts.’”); Hamlett, 2021 WL 5105861, at *2 (affirming exclusion of a psychological witness
that failed to show a “clear link between any particular mental health diagnosis and a witness’s
credibility”).

The Defense argues that apart from diagnoses of her mental health conditions, the
Defense should be permitted to admit Dr. Hall’s conclusion as to Alleged Victim 4’s substance
abuse i. Def. Br. at 12-13 (collecting cases). The Second Circuit instructs:

It is, of course, within the proper scope of cross-examination to determine

whether a witness was under the influence of drugs or narcotics or alcohol at the

time of observation of events in dispute or at the time the witness is testifying. As

Wigmore points out, however, a general habit of intemperance tells us nothing of

the witness’s testimonial incapacity unless it involves actual intoxication at the

time of the event observed or at the time of testifying.

United States v. DiPaolo, 804 F.2d 225, 229-30 (2d Cir. 1986) (cleaned up) (cited in Gov’t Br.
at 11 and Def. Br. at 12); accord United States v. Robinson, 583 F.3d 1265, 1272 (10th Cir.
2009) (“Illegal drug use does not merely bear on the [confidential informant’s] veracity but also
on his capacity as a witness.”).
