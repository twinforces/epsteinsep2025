asked, at the time of jury selection, whether he could still be fair and impartial juror despite his
experience with childhood sexual abuse. Similarly, it serves no purpose to ask Juror 50, after the
fact, whether his experience with childhood sexual abuse affected his ability to be a fair and
impartial juror during the deliberations. Both questions will elicit only self-serving answers. The
Court should, instead, ask Juror 50 questions that are designed to elicit the impact that the sexual
abuse had on Juror 50 and his ability to impartially assess evidence of a case involving sexual
abuse.

a. Did it affect how you interact with people? How?

2. Have you ever been involved in victims’ rights groups or victim advocacy?
a. Do you support victims’ rights or victim advocacy groups?
b. Are you a member of any of these groups?

e. Have you ever attended rallies or protests in support of victims’ rights?
3. Did you seek mental health counseling to address the abuse you experienced?
