again. /d. at 13. The defense. responded in part that "asking the questions live when the
jurors’ reactions, hesitations, explanations. can, be explored by the Court and observed. by
the partics wall aid in. the sclection. ofan impartial and fair jury." Jd. The Court denied
the defense's request.

Juror.No. 50 appeared for his voir dire on, November ‘1.6. Because Juror No. 50
answered “no” to all the relevant questions about sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual
harassment and. being the victim of a crime, his voir dire was very brief, spanning just,
seven pages of transcript. TR 11/6/2021, pp 128-34; EXHIBIT. 2. The Court.did not ask
Juror No. 50 whether the abuse he suffered would make iit difficult to be a fair and.
impartial juror, whether hc would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set
aside any: bias he might have, or whether he could fairly: and impartially. evaluate Ms.
Maxwell’s: defense, which challenged, in, part, the reliability of her accusers’ memorics.

As to the questions the Court did ask (most.of which addressed his personal
background), Juror No. 50 was not always truthful. For example, the Court.asked Juror
No. 50:f he used social, media. Juror No. 50 said that he. recently ended a relationship so
he “deleted them” and was “fully off it right:now.” TR. 11/16/2021, p 133. Asked, “[w]hat
do'you use, Faccbook, Twitter,” Juror.No. 50 answered, “I used Facebook: and
Instagram,” but. he did not. mention any: Twitter account. /d: (emphasis added). Juror No.
50 said he deleted.his accounts the week before. /d.

In fact, as described below, Juror No. 50 hada Twitter account (created in April
202.1) that he did, not delete, and he used the account to Tweet: about the interviews he

gave following this case and to communicate directly to Annie Farmer.
