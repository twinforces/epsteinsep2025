again. /d. at 13. The defense responded in part that "asking the questions live when the
jurors' reactions, hesitations, explanations can be explored by the Court and observed by
the parties will aid in the selection of an impartial and fair jury." Jd. The Court denied
the defense's request.

Juror No. 50 appeared for his voir dire on November 16. Because Juror No. 50
answered “no” to all the relevant questions about sexual abuse, sexual assault, sexual
harassment and being the victim of a crime, his voir dire was very brief, spanning just
seven pages of transcript. TR 11/6/2021, pp 128-34; EXHIBIT 2. The Court did not ask
Juror No. 50 whether the abuse he suffered would make it difficult to be a fair and
impartial juror, whether he would be biased against Ms. Maxwell, whether he could set
aside any bias he might have, or whether he could fairly and impartially evaluate Ms.
Maxwell’s defense, which challenged, in part, the reliability of her accusers’ memories.

As to the questions the Court did ask (most of which addressed his personal
background), Juror No. 50 was not always truthful. For example, the Court asked Juror
No. 50 if he used social media. Juror No. 50 said that he recently ended a relationship so
he “deleted them” and was “fully off it nght now.” TR 11/16/2021, p 133. Asked “[w]hat
do you use, Facebook, Twitter,” Juror No. 50 answered, “I used Facebook and
Instagram,” but he did not mention any Twitter account. /d. (emphasis added). Juror No.
50 said he deleted his accounts the week before. Jd.

In fact, as described below, Juror No. 50 had a Twitter account (created in April
2021) that he did not delete, and he used the account to Tweet about the interviews he
gave following this case and to communicate directly to Annie Farmer.
