presented by the parties’ and, therefore, are indicative of a lack of impartiality because a
fundamental instruction in every federal case is that a juror must render a verdict ‘solely
on the evidence presented at trial.’” Sampson, 820 F. Supp. 2d at 165 (quoting Thomas,
116 F.3d at 617 & n.10 (citing The Federal Judicial Center’s Benchbook for U.S. District
Court Judges)). Therefore, dishonest answers are a factor that can contribute to a finding
of implied bias. See Skaggs, 164 F.3d at 517.

The false answers Ms. Maxwell knows about so far, by themselves, provide a
basis for a new trial because, 1f they had been exposed during voir dire, this Court would
have treated Juror No. 50 just as it treated Juror No. 55. As explained above, Juror No. 55
was dismissed for cause when the Court, at defense counsel’s request, confronted him
with his Twitter account after he falsely denied using Twitter. TR 11/16/2021, pp 155-59.

Here, too, Juror No. 50 falsely denied having a Twitter account. It also appears
that he was not telling the truth when he said he deleted his Instagram account. But he
also did much more, falsely denying that he had been a victim of sexual assault or sexual
abuse. If Juror No. 55’s false answers “provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause,”
Stewart, 433 F.3d at 303, Juror No. 50’s false answers do as well.

This Court should treat Juror No. 50 just as it treated Juror No. 55, and on that
ground order a new trial. Should this Court hold a hearing, however, it would not be
surprising if additional false answers come to light.
