“This means that ‘the district court must determine if it would have granted the hypothetical
challenge’ if it had known the true facts.” /d. (quoting Stewart, 433 F.3d at 304) (citing Greer,
285 F.3d at 171; United States v. Shaoul, 41 F.3d 811, 816 (2d Cir. 1994) (noting that under the
second prong of McDonough. a defendant must have a basis for arguing that the district court is
required to sustain his challenge for cause)). As in Daugerdas, and under any reading of
McDonough, Juror No. 50’s misconduct demonstrates that he was incapable of being an
impartial juror and the Court would have struck him for cause. See id.

The government’s contrary arguments do not withstand scrutiny. Foremost, the
government mischaracterizes Ms. Maxwell’s argument and then attempts to shoot down the
strawman. Ms. Maxwell does not argue that every person who has been a victim of sexual assault
or sexual abuse was subject to a “mandatory” challenge for cause based on implied bias. Ms.
Maxwell’s argument is simply that Juror No. 50 was impliedly biased—an argument more than
supported by the record, Juror No. 50’s pattern and practice of telling falsehoods to the Court,
and the statements of Juror No. 50 himself.

Likewise, the government misunderstands Ms. Maxwell’s argument about Juror No. 50’s
