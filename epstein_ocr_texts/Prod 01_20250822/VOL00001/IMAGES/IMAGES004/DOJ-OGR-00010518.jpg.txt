minor cognitive deficits. More recently, during our meetings Ms. Maxwell has been depressed,
fatigued, anxious, and tearful. She endorsed experiencing trritability, memory deficits,
inattention, word finding difficulties, and trouble organizing and sequencing her legal
documents. Despite her symptoms, Ms. Maxwell has maintained her innocence and continues
to express a determination to fight her case.

Collateral Interview

I conducted a collateral telephone interview with Ms. Leah Saftian, Ms. Maxwell’s
longtime acquaintance and part of her legal team, to gain further insight into her current level
of functioning. Ms. Saffian reported that she has worked with Ms. Maxwell’s family since 1991,
as she represented her brother, Kevin Maxwell, at that time. She was reportedly hired to legally
represent Ms. Maxwell in 2015 and has spoken to her on the phone every day since that time.

Since Ms. Maxwell’s incarceration, Ms. Saffian has spent approximately six hours per
weekday on video conference with Ms. Maxwell, during which they review legal discovery
documents to prepare her defense for the upcoming trial. She described Ms. Maxwell as
“highly intelligent, well-educated, exceptional in so many ways,” however, she stated, “I have
seen her deteriorate” since her incarceration, which Ms. Saffian described as “frightening.”
She described the conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is being detained as “psychological
torture,” in that she 1s being held in “quasi-solitary confinement,” where the officers assigned
to her are often hosttle.

Ms. Saffian characterized Ms. Maxwell as “vibrant” and “witty” prior to her recent
incarceration. However, she reported that currently, due to sleep deprivation and the
conditions of her confinement, there are days when Ms. Maxwell is so exhausted that she can’t
string a sentence together, she often misuses words, and she struggles to maintain focus. Ms.
Saffian reported that Ms. Maxwell is the most important asset 1n her own legal defense, as
there are millions of legal discovery documents to review, and Ms. Maxwell has been the
primary source of information to “string together the facts” of the case. Ms. Saftian added
that Ms. Maxwell is often the one to notice factual errors within the legal discovery that her
legal team often does not pick up on, however, due to “marked deterioration” since her
incarceration, it has been increasingly difficult for Ms. Maxwell to sustain her attention to do
so. Ms. Saffian added that recently, Ms. Maxwell has completely lost her sense of humor and
often “misses the beat.”

Ms. Saffian reported that she does not consider Ms. Maxwell to be a flight risk, as she
had the opportunity and means to do so prior to her arrest but she chose not to. Ms. Saffian
stated, “If I was permitted by law to post bail, I would put my house on the line without
hesitation.”
