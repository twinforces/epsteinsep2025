confinement, isolated from all other inmates, and subjected to abnormally rigorous conditions. On
April 20, 2022, almost four months after trial, she was abruptly placed in general population, and
the charade of her pretrial detention was revealed: Her unusual detention was intended to help
redeem DOJ and BOP reputations tarnished by Epstein’s untimely death in custody and to ensure
that Epstein’s accusers would have their day in court. Ms. Maxwell’s pre-sentence detention was
tantamount to pre-sentence punishment.

Nor will Ms. Maxwell’s disproportionate pre-sentence punishment end now that she is in
general population. Just recently, Ms. Maxwell was the target of a credible death threat from a
fellow inmate. On information and belief, one of the female inmates in Ms. Maxwell’s housing
unit told at least three other inmates that she had been offered money to murder Ms. Maxwell and
that she planned to strangle her in her sleep. The inmate who made the threat has been moved to
the SHU, presumably to protect Ms. Maxwell.’ This incident reflects the brutal reality that there
are numerous prison inmates who would not hesitate to kill Ms. Maxwell — whether for money,
fame, or simple “street cred.” Ms. Maxwell has effectively traded the stress of flashlight checks
every 15 minutes in the middle of the night while in isolation for the equivalent stress of having
to sleep with one eye open - for as long as she is housed with other inmates. Ms. Maxwell will
have live with this threat every day that she is housed in the MDC and every day that she is
incarcerated in the prison where she is designated.
