LBTVMAX3 Opening â€”- Ms. Sternheim

1 topics to ask the client about. That certainly couldn't be a

2 good-faith basis to suggest to this jury that there will be

3 evidence before them at this trial; that these were more

4 manipulated by their attorneys who cultivated their specific

a stories told to the government. We think that's inappropriate,
6 your Honor.

7 THE COURT: I'm going to overrule it at the opening

8 stage. I did not preclude the line of argumentation; I wasn't
9 asked to preclude the line of argumentation. You raised the

10 prospect -- you did certainly and I appreciate it, raise the

11 prospect related to a subpoena of a witness's attorney, which I
12 agree with the government is entirely unclear to me how that

13 would be able -- but if the proffers that it's based on

14 existing nonprivileged information from which the jury could

15 infer that these attorneys structured in some way the questions
16 that were asked, I think the line is I don't think you have any
17 basis to say that the attorneys told the witnesses what to say.
18 What evidence are you going to put in that shows the
19 attorneys told the witnesses what to say?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, so we back up a little bit, your
21 Honor. We have in 2008 -- I'll use Carolyn as the example --
22 answers to interrogatories that are detailed that do not
23 include Ms. Maxwell; deposition testimony that is detailed but
24 does not include Ms. Maxwell; a 9l-page complaint detailed, but
25 does not include Ms. Maxwell.
