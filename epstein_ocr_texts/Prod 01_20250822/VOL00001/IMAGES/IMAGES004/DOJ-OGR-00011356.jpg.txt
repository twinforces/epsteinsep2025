Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

I write to alert the Court and the government to the inconsistent statements Ms. Maxwell
intends to prove up by extrinsic evidence during her case.

Ms. Maxwell conferred with the government about this issue. After conferral, and given
the press of time, counsel concluded it was most efficient to provide this notice to the Court and
the government and to allow the government to consider which other statements it would
stipulate to in addition to those the parties have already agreed on.
