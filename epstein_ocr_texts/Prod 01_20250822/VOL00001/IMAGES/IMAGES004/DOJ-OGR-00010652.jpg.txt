Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

I am counsel for Juliette Bryant, and I am providing the following victim impact statement
for the Court’s consideration with respect to Maxwell’s sentencing.

Pursuant to the Crimes Victims’ Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771, Ms. Juliette Bryant
qualifies as a victim as the Defendant participated in her trafficking from 2022 to 2004. Ms. Bryant
was unable to leave her small child to travel from South Africa for the sentencing hearing and is
therefore, unable to attend. Ms. Bryant therefore respectfully requests that the Court read her
statement into the record or, alternatively, allow her attorney representative Sigrid McCawley to
read the statement on her behalf.

I appreciate Your Honor imposing the maximum sentence available.

Respectfully,

Sigrid S. McCawley
