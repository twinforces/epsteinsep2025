UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED
United States of America, |
~—-
20-CR-330 (AJN)
Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Court is in receipt of the parties’ letters addressing the Defendant’s request to
temporarily seal her motion for a new trial and accompanying exhibits, and the Government’s
response in opposition and accompanying exhibits. See Dkt. Nos. 590, 594, 595. Several media
organizations have also filed letters seeking unsealing. The Court is also in receipt of Juror 50’s
motion to intervene. Both the Government and the Defendant oppose intervention. The
Defendant seeks to strike or, in the alternative, seal Juror 50’s motion.

For the reasons outlined more fully below, the Court rules as follows. First, the
Defendant’s motion to temporarily seal in their entirety all documents related to the motion for a
new trial is DENIED. Any sealing of judicial documents must be narrowly tailored to serve
competing interests. In this case, important interests include preserving the integrity of any
inquiry process going forward as well as protecting juror anonymity and privacy. Protection of
these interests, however, can plainly be accomplished through tailored redactions. Following the
Court’s resolution of the Defendant’s motion or a hearing, if one is ordered, all redactions will be
promptly unsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity
and privacy.
