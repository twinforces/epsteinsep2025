Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document653 _ Filed 04/01/22 Page 32 of 40

The Court is unpersuaded. First, the Second. Circuit, has. not held-that. bias must. be
implied when a juror has a ‘personal. experience similarto, the issues at’trial. The Defendant’s
only in-circuit decision. is the district. court opinion.in Daugerdas. See: Maxwell Br. at 30-35;
Maxwell Post-Hearing ‘Br. at 5. Inpassing, the. Daugerdas court noted that “[c]ourts imply’bias
‘when there are similarities between the personal expericnces of the juror and.the issues being.
(D. Mass. 20111)). But the court resolved the motion on other .grounds=it did not. imply: bias
because that.juror had. similar cxpcricnecs:to those at issuc in.the:trial,, but-instcad. (as discussed
above) implicd. bias because of that juror’s “brazen[],” “deliberate,” and. “repeated lies” and.
crcation of “a totally. fictitious persona ‘in her drive to. get on the jury.” Jd. at 472-74.

The Sccond Circuit has made clear that implied. bias is.an intentionally:narrow category.
The circuit has “consistently refused “to create, a'sct of unreasonably constricting presumptions.
that jurors be, cxcuséd ‘for catise, duc to certain occupational. of other special relationships which

644 F.2d 101, 104-05 (2d.Cir.:1981));, see also Wnited States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648,652 (2d
Cir. 1991). As noted.above, the ‘/orres court held. that, it was not.an abuse of discretion, for the
trial. court to infer that a juror was biased when she engaged ‘in-moncy structuring activities that’
were similar to ‘conduct. charged in the:case. 128 F.3d at 46-47. But the circuit. “decline[d] to
hold as.a general matter'that, where a juror has engaged in,conduet similar to that of the
defendant at'trial, the. trial judge mist presume bias.” Jd. at 46. (cmphasis added). As the court

explained, “[s]uch, cases are‘unlikely’to present:the ‘extreme situations’ that call, formandatory
