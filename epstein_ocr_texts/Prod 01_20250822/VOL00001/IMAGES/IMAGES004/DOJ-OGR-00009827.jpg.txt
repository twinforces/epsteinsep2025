circumstances will ever recur”). And.the New Hampshire state decision prominently cited by the
defendant,:docs not hold,'that: a maridatory presumption of bias applies based. on :similarity of
experiences, but. mercly finds that the ‘trial court acted within. its discretion. when. it found, after a
post-verdict hearing, that the juror’s demeanor, actions, and communications before, during, and.
after trial demonstrated bias. See:State v..Ashfar, 196 A.3d.93, 94 (N.H. 2018); see als id. at 98

happened here: Where, jurors indicated a history. of sexual abuse or harassment, the Court.
conducted.a targeted follow-up inquiry, focused on whether they can be fair and impartial. And.
rightly so: It:is not the law iin. this Circuit that a-victim of sexual abuse is presumed to be biased.
On. that ‘score, ‘it bears emphasizing how prevalent sexual, abuse is, and how common. federal.trials
involving. scx trafficking and child ciiticement are. If it were the law that survivors. of Sextal
