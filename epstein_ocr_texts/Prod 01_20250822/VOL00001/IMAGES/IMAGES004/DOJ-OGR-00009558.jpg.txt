public hearing with input from counsel. The parties may submit questions consistent with this
ruling, including what the Court holds in this Opinion are the limitations imposed by Rule 606
and the appropriate scope of the hearing. Once again, the scope of the inquiry is whether Juror
50’s answers were false; if so, what is the explanation for the answers; and how Juror 50 would
have responded to follow-up questions if accurate answers had been provided.

Per this Court’s prior order, the parties must submit the proposed questions under
temporary seal to ensure the integrity of the inquiry. See Dkt. No. 596 at 4. Proposed questions

unsealed following the hearing.

person or media organization about Juror 50’s jury service; and, finally, any record of payments
for any interview or information that Juror 50 gave about his jury service. Second, from
Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, and other social media platforms, the Defendant seeks

opened or closed his accounts. In her initial brief, the Defendant simply lists these requests
