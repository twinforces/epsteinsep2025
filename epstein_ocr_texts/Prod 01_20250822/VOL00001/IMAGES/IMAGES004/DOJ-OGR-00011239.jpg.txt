front of their friends, families, and communities. For instance, Government cooperators and
confidential sources routinely express reluctance to testify and have their cooperation with the
Government made public. Yet, absent a safety concern, they do so.

Third, denying the defendant’s motion does not implicate the defendant’s constitutional
rights to a fair trial or to present a defense. Although the defendant states that she has encountered
resistance from potential witnesses who are afraid of “unfavorable publicity should their names be
publicly associated with Mr. Epstein,” (Def. Letter at 3), the defendant retains the right to
compulsory process. If Michelle Healy or Ls will not testify willingly unless the
Court anonymizes their identities, the defendant can compel them to testify. See Fed. R. Crim. P.
17(a). If P| will not testify willingly, the defendant can seek a letter rogatory. See 18
U.S.C. § 1781(a)(2). Once the witnesses take the stand, they must testify truthfully on penalty of
perjury. See 18 U.S.C. § 1621. The defendant is right that she cannot compel witnesses to be
interviewed away from the presence of the jury—but she has no constitutional right to do so. And
the Government has the same powers and limitations. Put simply, the defendant’s constitutional
rights are not infringed if this Court follows the same rule as every other court in every other trial,
high profile or not.

IV. Conclusion

For the reasons set forth above, the Court should deny the defendant’s motion.
