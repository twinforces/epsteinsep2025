rights to a.fair trial, or to'present a-defense. Although the defendant states that she’has encountered.
‘resistance from potential witnesses who are afraid of “unfavorable publicity should their names be
publicly associated with :Mr. Epstein,” (Def. Letter at: 3), the defendant: retains ‘the right to
compulsory process. If Michelle Healy of will not; testify willingly unless, the:
Court anonymizes thcir:identitics, the. defendant can compel them totestify. See Fed. R. Crim. P.
17(a). 1 will not testify willingly, the defendant:can seck a'letter rogatory. See 18
U.S:C. § 1781(a)(2). Once 'the witnesses take the stand, they must testify’ truthfully: on, penalty of
perjury. See 18 U.S-C. § 1621. The: defendant is right. that she cannot compel..witnesses to be
interviewed away from. the presence of the jury—but she has no constitutional right to do'so., And.
the Government, has’the same: powers and liniitations. Put:simply,’'the defendant’s constitutional
rights are not: infringed if this Gourt follows the same rule:as every other court:in.every other trial,
high profile or not..
