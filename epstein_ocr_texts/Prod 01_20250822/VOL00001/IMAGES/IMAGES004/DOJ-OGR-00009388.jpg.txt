3 whether they're the same people? Can you do that?

4 A. Yes.

5 QO, And how about this: Can you look to see if they have a

¥s likelihood that you're going to narrow the chances that it's

9 A. I mean, if you have the tools. I guess I'm not quite sure
10 what you're asking. If you're doing an investigation, yes, you
11 can look to see whether they have the same middle initial.
12 Q. Did you ask Theresa Trzaskoma what's the middle initial for
LS the suspended New York attorney?
14 A. No, I did not.
15 Q. Did you -- well, withdrawn. You were aware, were you not,
16 that your firm was in possession of the information showing

Lf that Juror No. 1 was Catherine with middle initial M. Conrad,

19 A. No, I was not aware of that.
20 Q. So are you telling me that when Theresa Trzaskoma gives you
21 these two different names or two similar names, Catherine
22 Conrad and Catherine Conrad, you didn't suggest to her any
2g steps that she could take to try to determine whether it's the
24 same person?
25 A. No. We discussed Juror No, 1's responses to the voir dire,
