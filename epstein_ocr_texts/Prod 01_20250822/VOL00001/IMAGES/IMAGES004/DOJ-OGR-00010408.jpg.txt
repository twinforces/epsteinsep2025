defense witnesses died three years or more’prior to indictment); United States v. King, 560 F:2d
122,130 (2d, Cir. 1977) (defense witness diéd a year prior'to the indictment). Here, the
Defendant largely speculates about the:contents of these deceased witnesses’ absent testimony.
She states, for example, that the two'architeet witnesses; “could have established’the timeline for
Epstein’s résidcnées, and renovations at cach but'does. not say what that'timeline. is. Maxwell Br
at'29. Similarly, the Defendant:states that Epstcin’s live-in}housckecper could have testified that
the Defendant spent; only’ limited. time ‘with Epstein.at.his townhouse in:New York but provides.
little basis ‘or detail. for that anticipated testimony: As with the documentary: evidence above,,
such speculation, with the’ apparent, presumption that.absent evidence’ would necessarily. favor the
Defendant, is insufficient to establish actual prejudice. See Unitéd States v. Long, 697 E. Supp.
651, 657 (S.D.N.¥. 1988) (no prejudice where there is “no way: of knowing, what [an absent.
witness’s] testimony would’have been”).

Second, thé Defendant fails to establish that the contént of thesé witnesses’ testimony
‘could not have'been introduced into trial by:other means. At trial, witnesses testified that Epstein,
employced.a. significant; numberof individuals to work at his ‘residences, renovate those
residences, or fly: his ‘private airplane. Some, like.Juan.Alessi, Larry Visoski, and:David
Rodgers, testified, at trial. Still others were listed on the parties’ witness lists. The Defendant.
does not explain. why these witnesses’ testimony, or'the testimony of those listed witnesses who
were not called, could not-have supplicd:the same information that she sccks from individuals
who were unayailable'to testify. ‘Her ‘assertion that only individuals that have ‘since died could.
provide. adequatetestimony is, entirely unsubstantiated. Similarly, the Defendant docs not’
‘explain why evidence ‘of construction, or renovations at Epstein’s residences could not:'be proven.

by other’witness, testimony or by documentary evidence.
