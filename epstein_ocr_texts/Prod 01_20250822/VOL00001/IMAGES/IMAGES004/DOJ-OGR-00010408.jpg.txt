Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document657_ Filed 04/29/22 Page 42 of 45
defense witnesses died three years or more prior to indictment); United States v. King, 560 F.2d
122, 130 (2d Cir. 1977) (defense witness died a year prior to the indictment). Here, the
Defendant largely speculates about the contents of these deceased witnesses’ absent testimony.
She states, for example, that the two architect witnesses “could have established” the timeline for
Epstein’s residences and renovations at each but does not say what that timeline is. Maxwell Br.
at 29. Similarly, the Defendant states that Epstein’s live-in housekeeper cou/d have testified that
the Defendant spent only limited time with Epstein at his townhouse in New York but provides
little basis or detail for that anticipated testimony. As with the documentary evidence above,
such speculation, with the apparent presumption that absent evidence would necessarily favor the
Defendant, is insufficient to establish actual prejudice. See United States v. Long, 697 F. Supp.
651, 657 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (no prejudice where there is “no way of knowing what [an absent
witness’s] testimony would have been’’).

Second, the Defendant fails to establish that the content of these witnesses’ testimony
could not have been introduced into trial by other means. At trial, witnesses testified that Epstein
employed a significant number of individuals to work at his residences, renovate those
residences, or fly his private airplane. Some, like Juan Alessi, Larry Visoski, and David
Rodgers, testified at trial. Still others were listed on the parties’ witness lists. The Defendant
does not explain why these witnesses’ testimony, or the testimony of those listed witnesses who
were not called, could not have supplied the same information that she seeks from individuals
who were unavailable to testify. Her assertion that only individuals that have since died could
provide adequate testimony is entirely unsubstantiated. Similarly, the Defendant does not
explain why evidence of construction or renovations at Epstein’s residences could not be proven
by other witness testimony or by documentary evidence.
