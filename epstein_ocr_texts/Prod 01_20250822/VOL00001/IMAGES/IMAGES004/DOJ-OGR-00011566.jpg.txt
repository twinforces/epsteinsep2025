cite Somé Gases for that proposition. Watkins 667 F.3d at 265;

United States v. Streb, 36 F.4th 782, That's and Eighth
Circttit case from 2022. Courts have repeatedly conéludeéed ‘that
a minor e@an be the victim of undue influence even iff the minor

initiates a séxual meeting. See, for example, United Stdtes v.

Lay, 983 F.3d 436 (6h Cir, 2009), I therefore ‘overrule the
defendant's ob ection.
I next turn to the government's enly objection to the

PSR Guideline Galculation. T do find ‘that Virginia Roberts and

Melissa were minor victims of sex offenses —- they were

trafficked and abused by the defendant and Epstein during the

charged period. The Guidelines require that each minor, victim
bé considéred a separate Gount of conviction. 261.1. (da)1;
Probation department, excluded Virginia, and Melissa, from this

provision only because they were not named in the indictment.

This is an incorrect, basis for excluding them from the
cdlculation;: Relying oh Gonmmentary by the Commission, the
Second Circuit. has instructed "that conduct against victims
other than thosé Charged in the indictment may constitute
relevant conduct, and, if such conduct qualifies, should be
tréatéd for sénténcing purposes as though it 6écurred ih a
separate count. of conviction." 1 Umited States V. Wernick,
691, F.3d 108 (2d Cir. 2012) (Citing 2G1.1 comment note 4). I

therefore consider Virginia and Melissa as two additional

groups of victims and assign each a unit under Section. 3D1..4.
