Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 682 Filed 06/24/22 Page 3 of 4.

The Defendant also sccks partial, or full redactions of some ofthe statements, citing
references to, issues that were not'disclosed by the Government or revealed during ‘the. victims’
trial, testimony (with respect to Annic Farmer and:Kate); concerns about credibility (with respect
‘to Giuffre);.and due ‘process concerns (with respect'to, the remaining individuals) Def.’s Ltr: 5=7.
This request. for redactions is denied.

The Court has little difficulty concluding that the statements at issuc are judicial
documents to which the common. law.and First Amendment.presumptions of public. access
attach. See, e.g., United States v. Alcantara, 396 F.3d.189, 199 (2d Cir. 2005) (“[A] qualified

interests: that; would. justify sealing.” Wnited, States ‘y. Avenaitt, 550 F. Supp. 3d.36, 48 1.3
(S.D.N.Y. 2021). The Defendant’s proffered justifications for sealing,clide the reality that the
decision-maker, at this stage of proceedings is not a.jury but'the Court, which jis fully capable of
considering the submissions for what. they are worth and without: prejudice. Morcover, the
proposed redactions would not safeguard the interests the Defendant points to. ‘The:
