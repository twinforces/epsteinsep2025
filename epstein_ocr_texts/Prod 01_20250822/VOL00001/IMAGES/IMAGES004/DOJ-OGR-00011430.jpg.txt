(“Nor was.its evidentiary relevanee under Rule 401 affected by the availability of alternative
proofs. ofthe.clement to'which it went... . If, then, relevant evidenee is inadmissible inthe.
presence of other evidence related to it, its exclusion must rest.not on the ground that the other
evidence has rendered it ‘irrelevant.’” (citing Fed. R. Evid. 401, 1972 Advisory:Committec.
Notes)). Evidence is cither relevant or it isn’t, and. “unless.an exception applics, all. ‘relevant
evidence is admissible.” White, 692 F.3d at.246.

Under'this “very low” standard and.“very broad” definition, the: materials Ms. Maxwell
secks are relevant. Of the four motions. to quash, only the government and. Accuser-2 dispute:the
relevance of the requested materials. Govt. Mot..at.3-8; Accuser-2 Mot. at 3.

For her part, .Accuscr-2’s arguiment.is both undeveloped.and misplaced. Aécuscr-2, Mot.
at 3. Accuser-2 relics on,this Court’s carlicr orders declining to issuc a twelv.c-request subpoena.
directed. to BSF. That:decision has no bearing on. the motions, to quash filed here.

Here, the subpoena .is directed to the: custodian of the relevant documents (the EVCP).and
not. to\a. different third party.. The subpoena is also more narrowly tailored, including just four
‘requests ‘rather’ than twelve. In addition, the subpoena is returnable arrric/, not pretrial. And ‘most
significantly, now unlike then, the Court issued the requested subpoena after. considering, Ms.
Maxwell’s bricf in ‘support. Because a Court “must be satisfied that the subpoena complies with
the requirements of the Rule” before the Court “issucs a Rule 17(c) subpoena,” the Court.has
already (iftpreliminarily) determined.that:Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena to be proper. Nachamie, 91 F.
Supp. 2d at 561 (citing Zomison, 969 F. Supp. at 594 (“As the Supreme ‘Court has explained, it-is
the responsibility of the court, not.the opposing party, to ensure that a. subpoena sccured-under

Rule 17(c) is for a proper purpose.”)). Accuser-2’s relevance argument fails.
