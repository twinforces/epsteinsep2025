Re: Wnited States'v:. Ghislaine Maxwell
‘Dear Judge Nathan:

I. write to inform the Court of a recent development which may: require postponement of:
‘Tuesday’s sentencing proceeding. Yesterday, without having conducted .a psychological
evaluation and, without justification, the MDC placed Ms. Maxwell on. suicide. watch. She is not
permitted. to possess and review legal documents and is not permitted.paper or'pen. This-has
prevented -her, from, preparing ‘for sentencing.

Ms. Maxwell. was abruptly removed ‘from general. population and. returned to solitary’
confinement, this time without any clothing, toothpaste, soap, legal papers, ete. She was
‘provided a,“‘suicide smock” ‘and is given a ‘few shects of toilet paper on:request. This ‘morning, a
psychologist.cvaluated Ms. Maxwell and.determined she is not suicidal.

T met;with Ms. Maxwell today (after a 97-minute delay following ‘my arrival at the
‘facility). Shé is not suicidal. Currently, she 1s unable to-properly prepare for sentencing. If Ms.
Maxwell remains on suicide:watch, is prohibited. from reviewing legal-matcrials prior to
sentencing, becomes.slecp deprived, and. is denied sufficient time to mect; with ‘and confer with
‘counscl, we will-bc formally mowing on. Monday ‘for an-adjournment.

‘Very truly yours,
is/
