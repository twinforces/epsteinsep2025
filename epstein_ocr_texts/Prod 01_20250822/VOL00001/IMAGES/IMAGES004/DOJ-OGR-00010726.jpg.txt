Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

I write to inform the Court of a recent development which may require postponement of
Tuesday’s sentencing proceeding. Yesterday, without having conducted a psychological
evaluation and without justification, the MDC placed Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch. She is not
permitted to possess and review legal documents and is not permitted paper or pen. This has
prevented her from preparing for sentencing.

Ms. Maxwell was abruptly removed from general population and returned to solitary
confinement, this time without any clothing, toothpaste, soap, legal papers, etc. She was
provided a “suicide smock” and is given a few sheets of toilet paper on request. This morning, a
psychologist evaluated Ms. Maxwell and determined she is not suicidal.

I met with Ms. Maxwell today (after a 97-minute delay following my arrival at the
facility). She is not suicidal. Currently, she is unable to properly prepare for sentencing. If Ms.
Maxwell remains on suicide watch, is prohibited from reviewing legal materials prior to
sentencing, becomes sleep deprived, and is denied sufficient time to meet with and confer with
counsel, we will be formally moving on Monday for an adjournment.

Very truly yours,
/s/
