evidence indicates that Carolyn stopped performing sexualized massages for Epstein at the latest
in the summer of 2004, not in 2005.°

The two message pad slips cited by the government (GX 4-B, GX 4-F) do not support a
finding that the offense conduct lasted beyond November 1, 2004. Although these two messages
were labeled as government exhibits along with the rest of the message slips in the same book
(GX 4-A-K), these messages were never admitted in evidence. The Court admitted the message
slips from three other message books (GX 1-3) because Juan Alessi and Nicole Hesse recognized
their signatures and/or handwriting in those books and could establish a business records
foundation for their admission. (Tr. 877-889, 1772-1790). The government presumably did not
have anyone who could do the same for GX 4 or it would certainly have admitted the message
slips from that book as well. The Court should not rely on two isolated, unauthenticated
documents in determining when the offense conduct ended, especially when they would almost
single-handedly increase the recommended sentencing range by over 10 years. Cf United States
v. Cordoba-Murgas, 233 F.3d 704, 708 (2d Cir. 2000) (acknowledging that enhancements based
on relevant conduct may result in sentences that are “excessive, inappropriate, and unintended
under Sentencing Guidelines” when imposed “without regard to the weight of the evidence
proving the relevant conduct”); United States v. Gigante, 94 F.3d 53, 56 (2d Cir. 1996) (holding
that, for sentencing purposes, “the preponderance standard is no more than a threshold basis for
adjustments and departures, and the weight of the evidence, at some point along a continuum of
sentence severity, should be considered”) (emphasis in original).
>In her 2007 interview with the FBI, which the government cites in its own objections to the PSR, Carolyn stated
that she went to Epstein’s residence “over 100 times for approximately three years beginning when she was 14 years
old.” See PSR at 54. According to that timeline, Carolyn last visited Epstein when she was 17.
