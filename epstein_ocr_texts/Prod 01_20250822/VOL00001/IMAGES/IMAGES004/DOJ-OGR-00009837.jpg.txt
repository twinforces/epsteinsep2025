Mem, at. 44). Instead, the questioning of Juror 50 should be limited to only what is strictly
necessary to determine the relevant issucs.
3. There Is No Basis to Call.Any Other Juror as a Witness

There is.no’basis'to call any other'witness at a hearing aside from.Juror 50. The questioning’
of Juror 50 is sufficient to address the only questions, as to which, the rigorous standard for an.
evidentiary hearing has been.met.

The defendant:neverthcless proposes calling’ cach of the twelve jurors for testimony about:
whether ‘they have expcricneed. sexual. abuse. (Def: Mem. at 50, 57). It-would be difficult. to
imagine a spectacle more damaging to the jury process than requiring cach of the jurors to return,
to court weeks or'months after their service was complete to testify about.such a:decply personal
and. sensitive subject. The defendant’s request is cxactly the sort of. “fishing expedition” that.
presents the, “‘evil consequences” of which the Sccond ‘Circuit has repeatedly warned. See’
lanniellé, 866. F.2d. at 543;. Moon, 718 F.2d at 1234.

The defendant’s.request for'such an inquisition is based on,a-single:sentence in,a-newspaper

article, which ‘reports that: an. anonymous “second juror described ‘in an interview ‘with The New’

York: Times having been. sexually —_ abused as a child.” See
https://www.nytimes.com/2022/0 1/05/nyregion/maxwell-trial-jury-inquiry.html.!” It is

questionable that. this ‘report. itself may be considered. under Rule '606(b), insofar ‘as. the next:
sentence refers to the juror’s experience: in the context of jury:deliberations, so it is not clear from.

the article whether the, anonymous jurormade: any statements ‘to ‘the: reporter that were, separate

'? The defendant’s motion also states that Juror 50: has: made public-statements about another juror
who discussed. experiences ‘with scxual abuse: in. the context of deliberations. ‘Rule 606(b)
precludes the Court from, considering this. See Warger,574 U.S. at,43 (affirming denial, of motion.
fora, new trial under McDonough, where ‘the only evidence of juror dishonesty was. an. affidavit:
from another juror regarding statements a jurorhad madé during, deliberations).
