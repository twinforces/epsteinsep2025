1 statements. Whether that happens today or tomorrow we will

2 see. Hopefully today.

3 Any questions or issues to raise with the process I

4 have described? Mr. Hobson?

5 MR. HOBSON: Your Honor, no. One small thing on the
6 voir dire. We submitted a list of names for the Court to read.
7 One thing I wanted to flag for the Court is one of the

8 witnesses' names we asked you to include is Jesus Ortiz, and

9 that's how he pronounces his name, with a hard J. I want to
10 flag that for the Court so that his name is read accurately to
11 the jury.

12 THE COURT: Let me see if there are any other

13 pronunciation issues.

14 Mr. DeMarco, while I am pulling that up, any other

15 questions or issues with respect to the process?

16 MR. DeMARCO: No, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: And, Mr. DeMarco, you are going to keep
18 your mask on so I don't have to keep coming at you about it?
19 MR. DeMARCO: I will do my best.
20 THE COURT: OK. Don't take it off to talk.
21 MR. DeMARCO: Sorry?
22 THE COURT: Don't take it off to talk.
23 MR. DeMARCO: OK. I took it off to listen the last
24 time.
25 THE COURT: That's an anatomical anomaly.
