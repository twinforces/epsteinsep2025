The facts concerning all of the backdating will not be repeated at length herein. It is useful
to note, however, the following facts as they relate to Parse: (1) Parse was the key to the success of
the backdated transactions — without his agreement and participation, the J&G attorneys were

make much of the fact that he was not giving investment advice to the backdating clients (or, as the
evidence showed, to any of the other tax shelter clients). As to Parse’s suggestion that the
backdating transactions were done not by Parse, but by Carrie Yackee, his sales assistant (Parse
