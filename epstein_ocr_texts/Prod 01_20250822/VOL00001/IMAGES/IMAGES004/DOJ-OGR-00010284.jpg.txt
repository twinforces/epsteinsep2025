Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 647 Filed 03/11/22 Page 18 of 24

The government’s decision to add. Counts Five and Six, which are based on the:same
conduct, did not suddenly. convert Carolyn’s abuse and the conduct, she déscribed ‘in the Palni
Beach residence from 2001-2004 into:a. separate, distinct conspiracy. In. fact, the conduct. in the
2000s that Carolyn described. was no different than the conduct in the 1990s that Jane: described.
Like Carolyn, Jaiic testified that Epstcin gave her moncy after almost every sexual. cncouiter
with him at this Palm Beach residence, which would support.a, sex,trafficking charge. (Tr. 301-
02). Indeed, the government concedes that the only.'reason it did not expand Count: Five to
include Jane.and Annic Farmer’s abuse (as it had expanded Counts One and Three to:include
Carolyn’s.abusc) was that.the sex. trafficking statute was not enacted, until uffer their abuse had.

scheme between Epstcin ‘and Ms. Maxwell'to. “groom” and recruit minor’ girls to be sexually.
abuscd at Epstcin’s various residences from 1994 to 2004. (See Ind. 19. ‘1-2, Overview Section).
Accordingly, the offenses charged iin, the Indictment, support a finding of multiplicity:

B. Overlap in Participants, Time, and Geographic Scope

The government:makes a-half-hearted attempt to deny the obvious overlap between
Counts Three:and Five in participants, time period, and geographic scope. (Opp. at 30-32). For
example, the government argucs that some “but importantly; not all” of the participants in’the,
two conspiracies overlapped, and notes that SarahKellen, who scheduled massage appointments
for Epstein in. Palm Beach, only appeared in the 2000s during the time:period of the sex’

trafficking conspiracy. (Opp. at 30-31). But in the end, the government concedes, as it must,
