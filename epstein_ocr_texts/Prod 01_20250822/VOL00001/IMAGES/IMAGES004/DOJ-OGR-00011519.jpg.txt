The Court is in receipt of the Government’s revised proposed redactions to Dkt. No. 725
and proposed redactions to Defendant’s November 22, 2021 Response to Motions to Quash. See
Dkt. Nos. 732, 733. The Court concludes that the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to
protect the identities and privacy interests of victim-witnesses who were subject to the Court’s
anonymity order. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The
Court will file unredacted copies under seal.
