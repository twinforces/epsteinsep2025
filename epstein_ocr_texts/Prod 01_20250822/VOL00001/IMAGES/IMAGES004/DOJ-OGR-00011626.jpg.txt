1 up, which is why I'm telling you this now -- we can't predict

2 what people are going to say on either direct or

3 cross-examination. And of course we will follow the rules.

4 But here's an example: If someone were to say on direct

iy examination, "I've never been in trouble in my entire life,"

6 well, then that opens up the whole panoply of what is or is not
7 permissible under Rule 609.

8 And so that's where we end up here. And I think,

9 frankly, these are not issues that need to be briefed. These
10 are issues that simply come up during trial, and if someone

11 does something that one side or the other thinks is not

12 appropriate, there's an objection and it's resolved. I can

13 assure you that we are not going to do anything that is outside
14 of the rules, and if we think it's even close, we would of

15 course approach and address the issue with the Court.

16 If the government wants, I am happy to confer more

17 about this. If the government wants to brief it, they can.

18 But I think we end up in that place, which is, these are

19 trial-time decisions.
20 THE COURT: That may be true, and I suspect if you
21 have a conversation where the government says, you can't raise
22 under the rule a juvenile conviction for -- what was it?
23 MS. COMEY: A curfew violation, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: -- a curfew violation, and you say, well,
25 of course it could be that they say, I've never been in trouble
