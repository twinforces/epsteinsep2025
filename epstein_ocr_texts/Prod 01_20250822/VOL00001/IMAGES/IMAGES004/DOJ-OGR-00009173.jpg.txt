‘Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 615-1 Filed 02/24/22. Page. 5 of 6

Jane's story was backed up by her high school boyfriend, who
remembered being told about Epstein when they were younger.

The-accuser’s stories were backed up by flight logs which placed Jane on
at least one flight with Maxwell, David said.

Their stories were backed up by Maxwell's “little black book” = an address:
book found in Epstein’s home that listed the names of “masseusés”
including Jane and Carolyn.

David said the little black book also gave the jurors clues about how
Maxwell and Epstein had evaded accountability in the past. There were.
names.of several Palm Beach police officers listed on a first-name basis in
‘that book, David said.

“Those girls’ names and phone numbers were listed next'to the words
‘mom’ and ‘dad*” he said. “Professional miasseuses do riot need their
parents with them.”

Many speculated that the jury chose to acquit Maxwell on count two

because that count related solely to Jane, and that Jane was less credible

But David told The Independent that wasn’t the case.

“We simply didn't see enough direct evidence to convict on count two,”
he said. “It wasn’t about not believing Jane.”

Count two was a substantive charge that required proof that Maxwell.
“enticed” Jane to travel across state lines. David said there just wasn’t any
direct evidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice
Jane: to get on. those flights. :

“I personally was willing to find her guilty.on count two,” he'said. “But we
all. decided in the end that there wasn’t enough evidence.”

David also explained that he was convinced by the closeness of Maxwell
and Epstein’s relationship-and the key role she played in his life.
