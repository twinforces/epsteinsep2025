met its burden of proving by ‘a-prepondcrance of the evidence that.the counts arc’ not
multiplicitous.

‘Lhe offenses charged and common objectives. Both Counts Three and. Five are charged
‘under, the same: statute, 1'8 U.S.C. § 371, for conspiracy to commit an, offense against the United,
States. But. going beyond this “general level” of similarity, the statutory objectives of the two
counts differ. Macchia, 35F.3d at 669. Count Threc is a.conspiracy: to violate § 2423(a) and
‘Count Five. a conspiracy’ to violate: § 1591. These differing statutory objectives, entail legal
differences. Count. Three, for example, charges unlawful. sexual activity (defined as. sexual
touching of a, minor) while Count, Five charges commercial, sexual activity with.a. minor. And.
cach provision defines “minor” differently: under seventeen years old for Count, Thrée but under
cightcen years old for Count Five. Further, Count Three requires an.agreement with intent:to
transport across state lines, while: Count.Five’s. agreement requires only intent of sexual, activity
that affects interstate. commerce. ‘These differences push: the. first.Korfant factor in the
Government’s favor. See:/strada, 320‘F.3d at.182 (distinguishing between a conspiracy to
distribute cocaine and onc to distribute: crack); United States v. Villa, No. 3212=CR=40(JBA),
2014 WL.252013, at.*4 (D. Conn. Jan. 22,2014), aff'd, 744 F. App’x 716 (2d Cir. 2018)
(summary order) (distinguishing between a, § 371 conspiracy to “commit theft. from. an interstate
shipment. arid to transport.stolen property across state lines” and, one to “sell stolén property”).

The Government, however, errs in. suggesting that this factor alone:is “fatal” to the
Defendant’s multiplicity claim. Gov. ‘Br. at 29. To the contrary, :no'single Korfant, factor. is
dominant:or dispositive. Macchia, 35 F.3d.at'668. And courts in this district have found two

because both counts can arise from the same agreement. 7.¢-. Hernandez, 2009 WL, 3169226, at:
