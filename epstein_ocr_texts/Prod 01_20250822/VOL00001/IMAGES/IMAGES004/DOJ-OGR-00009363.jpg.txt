C2grdau2 Brune - direct

1 government and the Court accurately when the issue was

2 presented.

3 Q. Is that the ethical standard that governed you when you

4 were an AUSA, Ms, Brune?

5 A. That I was supposed to raise the other side's point in my

6 brief when I didn't know what position they were taking? I

7 don't think that governs any Assistant U.S. Attorney.

8 Q. No, I think it is really more that you were willing to lay
9 out the accurate set of facts if and only if the government

10 would ask you to do so.

11 A. We've already talked about the brief and how I in some

12 respects missed the issue, which I regret. Of course, both

13 defense counsel AUSA's are obliged to lay things out for the

14 court accurately. It is something that throughout my career I
15 have always strived to do,
16 Q. But for the Court's pressing and the government's pressing,
13} you would have never disclosed those facts to the government,
18 isn't that right, Ms. Brune?
19 A. If the government chose not to raise the waiver issue, and
20 as I thought about it I actually thought that the government
21 had far more information or at least had access to far more
22 information, my sense at the time was that the government had
oe probably Googled her, too, But I thought that if the
24 government chose to make it an issue, I was prepared to respond
25 and respond accurately, which I tried very hard to do,
