a late—filed victim impact statement, finding that the parole board may waive one or more

requirements in order to further its policy of ensuring that crime victims are treated with fairness,

sensitivity and dignity).

Il. The Court Should Exercise Its Discretionary Authority to Consider the Victim Impact on
Women Who have Suffered from the Most Notorious Long-running Sex Trafficking
Operation in Modern American History
In this case especially, the Court should exercise its broad discretion to hear and consider all

information relevant to sentencing. First, allowing women who were sexually abused and trafficked

by Maxwell’s conspiracy to speak will have an important cathartic benefit not only for the victims
speaking, but for those who are unable to speak as well. Second, in this case in particular, too many
unanswered questions remain about the scope and participants in this long-running wide-ranging sex
trafficking conspiracy — leading many Americans to believe that authorities continue to hide the
complete truth about what happened. Allowing all victims who wish to speak to do so publicly will
promote transparency and help to dispel some of those concerns.

A. Prohibiting Maxwell’s Victims from Speaking Unfairly Denies Victims Important

Cathartic Benelts

Allowing crime victims to speak at a defendant's sentencing can have significant
psychological and emotional benefits for those victims. See generally Paul G. Cassell, In Defense of

Victim Impact Statements, 6 OHIO ST. J. OF CRIM. L. 611, 621—23 (2009). As one federal district

court explained, “[E]ven if a victim has nothing to say that would directly alter the court’s sentence, a

chance to speak still serves important purposes... “[Victim] allocution is both a rite and a right.”
