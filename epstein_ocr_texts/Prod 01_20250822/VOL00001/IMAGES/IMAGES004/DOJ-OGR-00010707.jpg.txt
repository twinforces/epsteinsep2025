role in the New York crimes of an. expansive long-running ‘sex trafficking conspiracy, Maxwell's
criminal prosecution. does not stand ‘in.a. vacuum,.Maxwell’s recent prosecution in ‘this district
followed ‘the: non—prosecution of.her. co-conspirator Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell, and other unknown
co-conspirators in the Southern District of Florida under highly unusual circumstances. As the:
Eleventh Circuit: en banc recently:stated, the facts involving the non-prosecution of Epstein,
Maxwell, and other un=named and un-known.co-conspirators in Florida “are beyond scandalous—
they tell a tale of national disgtace.” Ja re Wild,.994 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th. Cir..2021); cert. denied’
sub nom. Wild v. United States Dist. Ct. for S. Dist: of Fla., 142°S. Cr. 1188 (2022).

In this Court, Maxwell will now be sentenced for conspiring with “one of this era’s most
opinion vacated, 967 F.3d.1285 (11th. Cir. 2020). But many; questions remain about how. and. why
the innumerable co-conspirators in:an extensive international child sex trafficking operation have
escaped justice for so long. In the Southern. District of Florida, Epstein, Maxwell, and. other. co—
conspirators arranged.a. secret: non—prosecution deal that:allowed Epstein to, in effect, take the fall
for all involved and then to serve most of his prison time on “work :release”—while the other co-.
conspirators (stich.as Maxwell) escaped, prosecution entirely. See generally Jeffrey Epstetns Wealth

“preposterous” inexplicable non=prosecution agreement has left the sex ‘trafficking conspiracy’s
victims—and the ‘public—to wonder why Epstein,. Maxwell, and other co-conspirators were treated
