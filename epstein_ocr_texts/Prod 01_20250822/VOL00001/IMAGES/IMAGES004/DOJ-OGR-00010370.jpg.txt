eighteen, and aiding and abetting the samc, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2. 'S2 Indictment,
Dkt. No. 187."

In:two prior pretrial motions, the Defendant requested. that the Court dismiss two of the
three conspiracy counts—that.is, Counts One, Three, and, Five—as multiplicitous, given that'all
three were premised:on the Defendant’s participation in a single criminal conspiracy with.
Epstein. To punish,her for all'three: counts, she argued, would violate the Double Jeopardy:
Clause. In. opinions, dated April. 1.6, 2021, and August ‘13, 2021, the Court denied those; motions
as premature because the Double Jeopardy:Clause would prohibit only multiple punishments for
the:same offense, but not. indictments for the same offense. United States v. Maxwell, 534 F.
Supp. 3d 299, 322 (S.D.N.Y. 2021) (cititig United, Sratés'v. Josephhere, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d
Cir.'2006)); United States v.. Maxwell, No. 20-GR-330(AIN), 2021 WL 35918011, at:*5

Because the jury convicted the Defendant on. all three conspiracy counts, the. Defendant
now‘requests that.the Court: impose judgment on only one of these:counts. Maxwell ‘Br. at 19,
Dkt. No. 600. The; Government: concedes that Counts One and Three are multiplicitous and
agrees'that the Court should not.impose judgment on Count One, but it argues that Counts Three
and. Five are distinct. offenses premiscd.on distinct criminal conspiracics, and so the: Court.should
impose judgment on both. Gov. Br. at 24, Dkt. No. 621.

On consent of both parties, the Court will not impose judgment on.Count One because: it
is multiplicitous. ‘For the reasons that follow, the Court. further grants, the Defendant’s motion.to

also, not:enter-judgment' on. Count Count Five because it is also multiplicitous with, Count Three.

| The original and S2 Indictments: also included'two counts of:perjury: See S2 Indictment $F.28-31. The Court
granted.the Defendant's motion to sever'those. counts for a separate trial. Wnited. States. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d
299, 321.(S.DN.Y. 20211).
