3. The interview with Reuters

The same day the Daily Mail published its article, Reuters also published a story
based on an interview Juror No. 50 provided to journalist Luc Cohen.’ In the Reuters
interview, Juror No. 50 elaborated about the purpose and effect of his disclosing to the
jury that he was a victim of sexual assault. According to Juror No. 50, coming to a
unanimous verdict “wasn’t easy, to be honest.” In fact, several jurors doubted the
credibility of Jane and Carolyn. “When I shared that [I had been sexually abused],”
recounted Juror No. 50, the jurors who had doubts “were able to sort of come around on,
they were able to come around on the memory aspect of the sexual abuse.”

4. The partial video of the interview with the Daily Mail

On January 7, the Daily Mail published a video of a portion of the interview with
Juror No. 50. This video is submitted to the Court as EXHIBIT 3. The video shows the
moment when the interviewer confronts Juror No. 50 about whether he disclosed to the
Court and the parties that he was a victim of sexual assault. The interviewer asks whether
Juror No. 50’s history of being sexually abused was “something that [he’d] said yes to in
the questionnaire” such that it “was something people were aware of when [he was]
selected as a juror.”

Juror No. 50 denied being asked such a question, saying, “No, they don’t ask your
sexual abuse history. They didn’t ask it in the questionnaire.”
