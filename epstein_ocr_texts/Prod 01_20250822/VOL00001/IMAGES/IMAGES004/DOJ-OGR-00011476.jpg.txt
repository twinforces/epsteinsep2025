including statutes of limitations and prior settlements, and applies more relaxed evidentiary
requirements.

Important features of the Program include:

1. The Program is independent of and entirely free from any interference or control by
the Epstein Estate. The Administrator has complete autonomy and decision-making
authority to determine individual claimant eligibility and compensation. The Estate has no
authority to modify or reject the Administrator's decisions on any basis or as to any claim,
and the Estate will pay all eligible claims based on the Administrator's determination.

2. The Program is purely voluntary; no individual claimant is required to participate. A
victim’s legal rights are not impacted unless the victim accepts the compensation offered by
the Administrator and signs a release, agreeing not to engage in any further litigation against
the Epstein Estate and related entities and/or individuals.

3. The Program is confidential. Protecting Claimant privacy is of paramount importance to
the Program. The Program will maintain strict confidentiality of all information submitted, but
will not impose any limitations on the Claimant’s ability to share information with law
enforcement, or anyone else.

“Our work with victims of Catholic Church abuse, September 11th and other similar programs has
provided us with invaluable insight into how to calculate the incalculable, and take into account the
life-long effects of trauma,” said Ms. Biros, who co-designed the Program. Mr. Feinberg added,
“The role of the Administrator is to apply a certain level of objectivity while taking into account the
specific circumstances presented by each individual claim. It is a challenging task, but one that
Jordy is uniquely qualified to undertake. Her empathetic and judicious style, and her long-time
claims experience and service to victims in the 9/11 community will serve this Program and
Epstein’s victims well.”
Beginning today, the Administrator will provide a Claim Form and other relevant Program information
to individuals who have filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim of sexual abuse against Jeffrey Epstein
and/or the Estate may begin the process of filing a claim with the Program, or have otherwise been
identified by counsel. Other individuals may also be eligible to participate in the Program by
registering on the Program website. The claims filing period will run through March 25, 2021.
The Program was initially proposed to the Probate Court of the U.S. Virgin Islands (“Probate Court”)
on November 14, 2019. The Co-Designers solicited feedback from various interested parties,
including victims’ counsel, and that feedback was incorporated into a draft protocol that was
presented to the Probate Court on February 4, 2020. The final protocol was approved by the
Probate Court on June 3, 2020.
"We are pleased to get this Program up and running after months of considered and collaborative
design. My staff is deeply sensitive to the unique circumstances involved and is committed to
processing the victims’ claims in a prompt, fair and effective manner,” said Ms. Feldman.
