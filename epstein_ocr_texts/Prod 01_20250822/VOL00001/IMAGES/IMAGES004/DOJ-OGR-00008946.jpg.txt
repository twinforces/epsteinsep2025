Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document600 _ Filed 02/11/22 Page 22 of 37

Mexico, she had denied being sexually abused there. It-was not until just before trial, after the
government. had questioned her'about the New Mexico trip in. hér'preparation for trial, that Jaric
claimed. for the: first time that. she: had ‘engaged. in sexual. activity with. Epstein while:she was at.
the ranch. See supra note |.

Jane’s new recollection about'the. New Mexico, trip. was disclosed at the eleventh hour
and substantially: prejudiced Ms. Maxwell's ability to prepare‘her defense. See id. (“The
determination.of whether a variance between.an indictment and the proof at trial is‘prejudictal
turns on whether the variance infringes on the substantial rights that.indictments exist'to
protect—to inform, an accused. of the charges against him, so that he may’prepare his defense and
to avoid double. jcopardy.”). Because the Marin Act counts. as charged in the Indictment were
based on a violation of New York. law, the defense vigorously litigated. the extent. to which the
government could introduce evidence, of sexual activity that: occurred in jurisdictions outside of
New’Y ork in support ofthe, Mann. Act-counts. As pait.of that cffort, the defense, requested
limiting instructions with respect to'the testimony of Kate and Annie: Farmer, The: limiting
instructions, which were read to the jury’ immediately before the witnesses began their testimony,
specifically instructed the jury:that any: scxual.conduct that Kate ‘or Annic Farmer said occurred
with, Mr. Epstein “was not ‘illegal sexual activity’ as the government has charged:in the
indictment.” Tr. 11.67:23-1168:2; Tr. 2048:22-2049:'1.

Had the defense been given. sufficient. notice:that Jane would testify that she was sexually
abused in,New Mexico, we would have litigated this issuc before trial .and, at;the very least,
imadé an application tothe. Court'to give a limiting. instruction before. the statt.of Jane’s testimony’
similar to the one given for Annie Farmer, who also testificd about a single: instance of'scxual

contact at the ranch.in New Mexico when she was 16 years, old, which could not; have violated.
