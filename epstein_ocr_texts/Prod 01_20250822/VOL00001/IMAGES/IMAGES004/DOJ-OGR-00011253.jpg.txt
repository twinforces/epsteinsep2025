Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this motion to preclude certain testimony of certain
defense witnesses. After reviewing the defendant’s witness list and related material, it appears
that certain witnesses are expected to testify about matters that are irrelevant, prejudicial, or
improper impeachment.

Specifically, the Government moves to preclude the following:

e Testimony from Eva Dubin, Michelle Healy, or Kelly Bovino about whether they

participated in a sexualized massage with Jane;

e Testimony from Alexander Hamilton as contained in the affidavit attached as Exhibit

AS
e Testimony from Dr. Loftus about suggestive activities that did not occur in this case;
