her counsel cannot adequately consult with her about the defense. Allowing Ms. Maxwell to file
her Rule 412 motion 14 days before trial, as the Rule itself provides, is essential for counsel to
effectively consult with Ms. Maxwell, to investigate and research what evidence they will seek to
admit under Rule 412, as well as to comply with the several procedural steps required by the
Rule.

Accordingly, unless this Court orders otherwise, Ms. Maxwell will file her Rule 412
motion on or before November 15, 2021, as provided in Rule 412(c)(1)(B).
Respectfully Submitted,
Jeffrey S. Pagliuca
