1 in the abuse of these individuals.

2 Paragraph 82, the objection is to the assertion that

3 the records recovered from the Palm Beach residence during the
4 2005 search reveal that additional minors provided Epstein with
5) sexualized massages between 2001 and 2004. Again, I overrule

6 the objection. The trial record including message pads, phone
7 book entries, and testimony of witnesses establishes by a

8 preponderance that the information contained in this paragraph
9 is accurate.

10 Paragraph 83, so there was a revision here. I'm not
11 sure if there is a continuing objection, Mr. Everdell. The

12 previous objection was to the assertion that the defendant is
13 responsible for the victimization of untold number of other

14 victims. The probation department adopted the government's

15 suggestion, revised the paragraph to assert that the defendant
16 is responsible for the victimization of additional minor

17 victims. To the extent there is a continuing objection, I

18 overrule it for the reasons stated regarding paragraphs 27 and
19 28.
20 Paragraph 85 is an objection to the inclusion of
21 Kate's victim impact statement and her status under the CVRA.
22 We have litigated the question of Kate's ability to make a
23 statement here. I believe that defense's ultimate position was
24 that with the requested redactions, there were no objections to
25 her making a statement. Do I have that right?
