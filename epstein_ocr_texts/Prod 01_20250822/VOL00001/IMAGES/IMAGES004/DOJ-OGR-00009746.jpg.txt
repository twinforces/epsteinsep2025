As discussed. in. Murphy v. Nogam, No. CV 14-4268 (KM), 2018 WL 278735, at
*25'(D.N.J. Jan. 3, 2018), aff'd sub nom: Murphy v. Adm'r Ll. Jersey State Prison, No. 18=
2825, 2021 WL.2822179 (3d Cir. July 7,.2021), New Jersey courts have repeatedly

invalidated, judgments where a juror's inaccurate answer to a question.

propounded ‘in the jury ‘voir dire precluded. a litigant from, exercising a
peremptory challenge. State vy. Scher, 278 N.J. Super. 249, 263

(App.Div.1994), ccrt. denied, 140 N. J. 276 (1995) (citing Wright vy.

Bernstein, 23-N.J. 284 (1957); State v. Williams, 190 N.J-Super:. 1.1 1 (App.

Juror 50 to disclose his ‘claimed victim status in jury selection cheated Ms. Maxwell of
her ability to intelligently exercise her peremptory challenges and robbed her of-a fair
trial. In, this case truthful responses ‘would have revealed Juror '50’s claimed victim status.
He would have been ‘excused for cause on, that basis alone and would never answered any
questions in person.

Even, if Juror 50 had claimed on the questionnaire that he could be ‘fair, despite his
victim status, the result;would have been the same. ‘He would have been.asked. to describe.
to the Court and the parties, under ‘oath, what he claimed happened to: him, when it
happened, ‘the impact.on him, and how he. could still be fair. Had Juror 50 revealed to. the
‘Court, as he did, to the media, that he believed that his: memory’ “was like a-video” and,

that he would advocate 'that the alleged victims here were credible, based on: his own
