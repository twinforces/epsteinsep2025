I. Applicable Law

Prior inconsistent statements are generally admissible for impeachment purposes only, see
Fed. R. Evid. 613, and are inadmissible hearsay for substantive purposes unless they were made
at “a trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or in a deposition.” Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(A); see Santos
v. Murdock, 243 F.3d 681, 684 (2d Cir. 2001). In determining whether a party may impeach a

(S.D.N.Y. 2011) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). While “two statements... need

witness’s failure to recall a prior statement regarding a subject at issue in the trial is so incredible
that it may be deemed inconsistent and thus subject to impeachment by extrinsic evidence.”
United States v. Ashburn, 2015 WL 5098607, at *27 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, 2015); see United States
v. Insana, 423 F.2d 1165, 1170 (2d Cir. 1970) (explaining that “there may be circumstances where
' On this point, the Government notes that the defense’s letter of today was the first time the
Government was informed of the complete list of prior inconsistent statements the defense
intended to offer, despite the Government’s efforts since the close of its case to confer on the
subject.
