Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document675-3 Filed 06/25/22 Page2of5

Shortly after my first meeting with Epstein and Maxwell, I was offered a full-time position at
Henri Bendel. It was a newly created position at the store, and it would have required me to leave FIT
a semester short of completing my degree. I had aspirations of going to law school and knew I could
not do so without my undergraduate degree, so I declined it.

When Ghislaine found out she flew into a rage. I didn’t understand why until she told me
that she and Epstein were responsible for giving me that opportunity and that in turning it down I
was being ungrateful. I now know this was their modus operandi — give a gift or favor and then
demand sex in return. Nevertheless, I rebuffed the guilt-trip ploy, completed my coursework, and got
my FIT degree trom FIT, at which point I left Henri Bendel and took a position at Bloomingdales.

I wanted to leave Epstein and Maxwell and the abuse they perpetrated against me behind as I
started my professional life. I never wanted to or expected to see them again.

One day in the fall of 1995 Maxwell showed up at Bloomingdales, looking tor me. When I
asked her how she knew where I was, she said she asked my colleagues at Henri Bendel. She
immediately began befriending me once again, asking me to go out socially. I tried to resist but
eventually she wore me down and I began spending time with them again. They made me feel like
they were friends, contemporaries.

In one instance, they took me to Florida, insisted that I stay longer than planned which caused
me to miss work and led to my being fired. Seizing on this new vulnerability, they began trafficking
me to their friends. By that time, I was trapped.

I was assaulted, raped and trafficked countless times in New York and Florida during a three-
year period. At one point I became pregnant (by whom I am unsure) and aborted the baby. Things
happened that were so traumatizing that to this day ’m unable to speak about them; I don’t even have
