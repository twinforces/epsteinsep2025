1 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

2 THE COURT: And then you'll put them back there in the
3 morning.

4 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

5) THE COURT: And I'm not sure if we'll get -- if we'll
6 do a break -- so it sounds like the defense should put the

7 folders underneath in the morning as well, in case we get to

8 cross before the break. Is that okay with everyone?

9 MS. COMEY: That's fine, your Honor.

10 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine, your Honor.

11 THE COURT: Okay. Great.

12 Other matters to take up in the immediate --

13 MS. COMEY: No, your Honor.

14 MR. EVERDELL: Not from the defense.

15 THE COURT: Okay. We'll meet at 8:45 just to discuss
16 issues as we need to. Please think through issues that may

17 come up that require discussion out of the presence of the

18 jury. It was disappointing to have multiple sidebars during

19 openings today. And I encourage all of us to do what we can to
20 avoid that by thinking through and raising issues in advance,
21 okay?
22 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: Good. All right. Thank you. Have a good
24 evening, everyone. I'll see you in the morning.
