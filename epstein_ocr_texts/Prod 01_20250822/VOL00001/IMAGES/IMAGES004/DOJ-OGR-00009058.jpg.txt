Ms.. Maxwell:requests that any hearing begin. with the questioning: of Juror No. 50.
Ms. Maxwell requests. that: the Court; first advise Juror No. 50 about the nature of the
hearing and then. allow defense counsel to question Juror’No. 50 followed by questioning
from the government, re-cross. examination, by defense counsel, followed by any
questions from the Court and any additional, questions from counsel based on the Court’s
questions.

If, after this examination. further inquiry is required, Ms. Maxwell suggests that the
second juror be summoned to Court for an, identical. process. If necessary, this. proccss
should be repeated.as to all remaining jurors.

After the. examination. of the jurors the parties should be afforded a-period of time
to conduct any further investigation warranted by the information presented at the hearing
followed by post-hearing arguments, cither oral, or written.

Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) does ‘not prohibit this inquiry, because Ms.
Maxwell does not seck;: to impeach. the verdict based ‘on the content-of deliberations... Gf
Fed. R. Evid. 606(b) (providing that, with certain exceptions, “a juror may ‘not testify
about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations”
during “an. inquiry into the validity:of a verdict’). Instead, she intends to show that her
jury. was. not fair.and impartial as required by: the Sixth Amendment because at, lcast. two
jurors gaye false answers during voir dire to material questions that, 1f-answered
truthfully,, would have ‘subject them to'a challenge for cause.

To the extent Rule 606 might apply to: certain questions asked at the hearing, Ms.

Maxwell need not inquire into the content of deliberations to establish. her jury bias
