Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document600_ Filed 02/11/22 Page 25 of 37
Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment because they subject a person to punishment
for a single crime more than once. United States v. Sattar, 314 F. Supp. 2d 279, 307 (S.D.N-Y.
2004) (citing United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 696 (1993); Chacko, 169 F.3d at 145); see
also United States y. Colton, 231 F.3d 890, 910 (4% Cir. 2000) (“T]he principle danger created
by multiplicity is that a defendant will receive multiple punishments for a single offense.”’).

The offense in a charge of conspiracy is “the agreement or confederation of the
conspirators to commit one or more unlawful acts.” Sattar, 314 F. Supp. 2d at 307 (quoting
(Braverman v. United States, 317 U.S. 49, 53 (1942)). Therefore, “[a] single agreement to
commit several crimes constitutes one conspiracy,” but “multiple agreements to commit separate
crimes constitute multiple conspiracies.” Jd. (quoting United States v. Broce, 488 U.S. 563, 570-
71 (1989). In determining whether a defendant engaged in a single conspiracy or multiple
conspiracies, the focus must be “on what agreement, if any, the jury could reasonably have found
to exist vis-a-vis each defendant.” /d. (quoting United States v. Johansen, 56 F.3d 347, 351 (2d
Cir. 1995).

When an accused is charged with two or more conspiracies in violation of the same
statutory provision—in this case, the general conspiracy statute, 18 U.S.C. § 371—the Second
Circuit has adopted a multifactor test for determining whether the conspiracies amount to the
same offense for double jeopardy purposes. These factors include:

(1) the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments;
(2) the overlap of participants;
(3) the overlap of time;
(4) the similarity of operation;
(5) the existence of common overt acts;
(6) the geographic scope of the alleged conspiracies or location where
overt acts occurred;
(7) common objectives; and
(8) the degree of interdependence between alleged distinct conspiracies.
