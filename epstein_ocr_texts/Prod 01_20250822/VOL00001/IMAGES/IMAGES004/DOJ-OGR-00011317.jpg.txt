This Court should preclude the government from eliciting Examiner Flatley’s expert
opinion. As this Court explained to the government at the pretrial conference when Ms. Maxwell
first raised this issue with the Court:

Well, I mean, [the government’s] notice should provide the opinions that

[Examiner Flatley’s] going to offer... .

It’s not a scavenger hunt. You’re required, as the first matter, to provide,
pursuant to Rule 16, the opinions that he’s going to offer.
If your notice is insufficient under Rule 16 to tell us now what opinions your

expert is going to provide, then you may have problems down the road. But I’m not

going to have [Ms. Maxwell] held to a different standard than what the government

has done here.

TR 11/23/2021, p 25-26.

It is clear that Examiner Flatley is no longer merely providing a factual narrative of what
he did in this case. Based on his specialized training and experience, he’s defining and
explaining the significance of technical terms and concepts for the jury, and he is using reasoning
unfamiliar to lay individuals to describe his analyses for, and to impart his conclusions to, the
jury.

Ms. Maxwell has been preparing for the testimony of other witnesses and briefing other
issues, and she has not had sufficient time to prepare for the cross-examination of Examiner
Flatley. The government’s disclosure comes far too late, it’s prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell, and the
testimony should be excluded.
