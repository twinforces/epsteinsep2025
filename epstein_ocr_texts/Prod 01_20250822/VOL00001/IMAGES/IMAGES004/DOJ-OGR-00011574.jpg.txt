1 break.

2 Ms. Moe

3 MS. MOE: With respect to the sequence of events, just
4 so victims are aware, would the Court prefer to hear from

5 victims before the Court hears from the parties or after? We

6 defer to the Court, but it would be helpful to know for the

7 victims.

8 THE COURT: I was anticipating government, victim

9 statements, defense counsel and then Ms. Maxwell if she wishes
10 to make a statement. My staff did provide counsel for the

11 victims making statements an order in which they're speaking.
12 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

13 THE COURT: Any objection to that ordering, Ms. Moe?
14 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you.

15 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim?

16 MS. STERNHEIM: I'm on now. No. Thank you.

17 THE COURT: I'll see you at 1:00. Thank you.
