x THE COURT: Does the defendant Parse rest?

2 MR. SHECHTMAN: We do, your Honor.

a THE COURT: Does any defendant have any additional

4 evidence to offer to the Court on this hearing?

5 MS. McCARTHY: Not from Mr. Field, your Honor.

6 MR. ROTERT: We do not, your Honor.

7 MR. SKLARSKY: No, your Honor,

8 THE COURT: Does the government have anything further?
9 MR. OKULA: Thank you, your Honor. We do not.

10 THE COURT: The government rests?

11 MR. OKULA: We do indeed, your Honor.

12 THE COURT: I would like to get some post-hearing

ae briefing from the parties. It seems to me that the simplest

14 way to do it would be to have the parties submit simultaneous
15 briefs and then I give you a very shart responsive brief if you
16 felt it was necessary to respond to something that the other

a side said. We'll fix a schedule in a moment.

18 Obviously, in the briefs I want the parties to provide
19 the Court with what they believe the strongest results are of
20 this evidentiary hearing. Second, in the post-hearing briefs
21 I'd like the question of whether the attorneys for Brune &
az Richard involved in this matter would have satisfied their
fos ethical obligations if they failed to disclose the contents of
24 the July 21 letter and their complete investigation into Juror
2a No. 1.
