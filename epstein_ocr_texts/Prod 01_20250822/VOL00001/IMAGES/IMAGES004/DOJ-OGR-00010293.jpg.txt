v S220 Cr. 330 (AJN).
Defendant.

The Government:respectfully submits this memorandum in further support ofits opposition.
to the defendant’s motion for a new trial, dated. January 19, 2022. (the “Defense Motion”). After
the thoughtful and. thorough hearitig held by this Court, it is ¢rystal clear that the defendant
received a fair trial. Juror '50’s sworn testimony at the hearing made ‘evident that he: did not
deliberately lic in,completing the questionnaire, but that he instead:made:an honest mistake. And,
An. any: event, had. Juror SO,.accurately reported in his, questionnaire ‘that’ he had. been a‘victim of
sexual, abuse, he:would not have'been struck for cause. Juror 50 repeatedly explained—just as he
did. during voir dire=that. he would be fair:and impartial and would decide the case based on the
evidence at trial andthe law as explained by-the Court. Accordingly,'under controlling Supreme
Court.and Second Circuit. precedent, the defendant. cannot show that Juror 50 harbored. any bias
against, the defendant. Morcover; during voir direc, multiplé other potential jurors inthis case
reported, having experienced ‘sexual abuse and. were nonctheless qualified as jurors ‘without any
objection from the defendant. Jt'was.entirely appropriate forJuror 50 to sit;onthis jury, and nothing

about his service, as a jutor calls ifito, question. the. integrity of the Verdict :in this case.
