inconsistent and unreliable. I owerrtle this, objection.

Carolyn testified at trial that Virginia first brought her to

tI

pstéin's, residence when she was 14 years, old. TIT found Carolyn

tq be credible and credit her testimony. I'm not persuaded by
the arguments to the contrary. Moreover, @Séan"s, credible
testimony corroborated Carolyn.'s recollection.

Paragraph 59, the défendant makes two objections.
Same objection to Carolyn being 14, For the reasons I've

stated, that*s overruled. She objects to Carolyn's assertion

that she visited Epstein's residence more’ than. a hundred times,
I overrule that objection: Again, I credit Carolyn's
testimony. She testified ‘that she went to the house "over 1LQ0
times." I reject. the suggestion that this is improbable based
on, Epstein,'s travel schedule.

Paragraphs 61 and 62 again object to Cardlyn's age;
and, IL, overrule for the same reasons.

Paragraph 64, three objections. First, the defendant

ebjects to Carolyn,'s assertion, that she visited, the Palm Beach,

residence over a Hundred tities and her assertion that. shé was
14. For the reasons I've given, I overrule those objections.
She objects té the assertion that. Cardlyn stopped performing
sexualized massages in, 2001 when she was 18 years old and
argues that the evidence indicates she was 17 years old. We're
going to tdke up the issue of this timing question, with respect
to the issue of which Guidelines Manual controls. So I'll skip
