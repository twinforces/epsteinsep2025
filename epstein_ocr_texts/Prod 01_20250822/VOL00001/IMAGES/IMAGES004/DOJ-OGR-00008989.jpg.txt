2. The Court has the authority to release the. Jury Questionnaire

under seal.

currently. held‘under'seal, by this, Court’s authority.

In. United States vy. King, the appellate court made clear that it may be permissible:to
release jury, questionnaires from a.trial, if the juror names were redacted, to maintain, juror
anonymity. United. States ¥. King, 140 F3d,76, 83 (2d.Cir 1998). Support for such a.release was
based on the holding,that. limitations to access of:voir dire :materials are only permissible when
there is a demonstrated need, and the limitations are narrowly drawn and, supported by’ findings.
Id., at 82-83.

The decision, to release jury: questionnaires and voir dire transcripts is subject toa
balancing test. United States v Bruno, 700 F Supp .2d 175, 182-83 (NDNY 2010). The Court:
must use its discrction.to “make.a sensitive appraisal. of the climate surrounding a:trial and.a
prediction as to the potential, security. or publicity problems that may arise” before, during, and
after the proceedings. United States v. Childréss, 58 F.3d,693, 702: (D.C.Cir.1995); sée also
United States v:, Brown, 250. F.3d. 907, 914-15 (Sth Cir.2001) (holding:that:the trial court may
refuse to allow the media to ‘inspect documents that ‘are not a matter of public: record ‘and that
such refusal does. not ‘operate as a. prior restraint). The conclusion. of the:trial docs not remove the
jurors’ interest:in privacy and protection. from harassment. See United States'v: Gurney, 558 F.2d.
1202, 12.1.0-12 (Sth, Cir.1977);'see also United, States'v. Harrelson, 713 F:2d 1114, 11.1.8 (Sth
Cir.1983) (finding:that'*[c]ommon sense tells us that a juror Who has.once indicated a desire. to
be Ict.alone:and to put the matter of his jury service behind him by declining to be interviewed
regarding it:is‘unlikely' to change his mind; .and.if he does, he is always free to,initiate an
intervicw”).
