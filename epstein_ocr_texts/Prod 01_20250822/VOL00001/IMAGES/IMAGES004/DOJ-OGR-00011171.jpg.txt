Dear Judge Nathan:

On. behalf of defendant Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully oppose. certain of the redactions
coe xt the:g government to their Omnibus Memorandum i in, oppose to the Defendant’s

Specifically, we oppose the redactions, proposed by the government: contained on ‘pages 1=+128
and 187-88 of the Response as'well.as certain of the redactions in, Exhibit'5. We, believe
additional redactions are appropriate to pages 129-134. ofthe Response.. We hereby: attach our
proposed redactions to pages 129-134, 187-88 and Exhibit 5.

pursuant to the Sixth Amendment. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court (Press-Enterprise

obtained absent notice:to, and:an opportunity’to objcct by; individuals with a privacy interest
in those documents. Numerous civil litigants in the Second Circuit: are negotiating protective
orders every day‘in relianee on Martindell-and have the right to know that'the protective
orders may be of little to no ‘utility when their civil. opponent secks to have them used as a tool,
