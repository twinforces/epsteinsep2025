Case. 1:09-cr-00581-WHP Document 522 Filed 04/06/12, Page 9 of 29

The Court: Allright. Ido. Because I would like to make:certain that‘any defendant who
had a jury’consultant.on.the matter also make certain that the jury: consultant did not have
any information.on Juror Number One.

Trzaskoma: The only’ thing additional that I would offer your Honor is—well, we can:
addréss this-in aletter. | think it’s more appropriate.

29: This colloquy must be:read in its (rather brief) entirety, that is, as.a whole. Trzaskoma’s
statement:implies that the answer to thé Court’s question from Brune & Richard would not be
‘that'it had no-information at all. It would not require a.letter to say only’that. It is, instead, clear
that Trzakoma had something “additional. : to offer,”'and chose to accept the Court’s invitation.
‘tO Say it in.a letter, which was-done on July 21 ina fashion that adequately disclosed the firm’s
earlier research .and internal cofmitinications on the subject. “The general rule is that:statements
‘must be taken in context,-and that related’ ‘parts of.a.document must be taken together. That.a
hasty:reader might take the first‘paragraph out.of context is notin ‘the present:circumstances
enough: to brand:the memorandum.as false.” The memorandum must be “read as a whole.”
‘Young y. City of Providence, 404 F.3d 33, 40-41 (1* Cir. 2005) (Rule 11 appeal) (citations.
omitted).

30. For'the reasons stated, my opinion:is'that‘the actions of the Brune & Richard lawyers
throughout the trial and in- the months following: with respect to:the information they had
obtained about Catherine ‘Conrad’ ‘were entirely: consistent with their responsibilities under‘the
lawyer ethics: nilés.
