Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670- Filed 06/22/22 Page 46 of 55
Office recognized in its report, a significant sentence “should promote general deterrence against
the exploitation and degradation of humans made possible by this offense, as well as untouchable
individuals who feel their privilege and affluence entitle them to victimize others without fear of
consequence.” (PSR at 67).®

B. The Defendant’s Arguments for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive

The defendant spends the majority of her sentencing submission complaining that her
conditions of pretrial confinement warrant a downward variance. Not only are the defendant’s
claims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks the extraordinary steps that the Court has taken
throughout the pendency of this case to oversee the conditions of this defendant’s confinement.
Indeed, the Court received regular updates regarding the defendant’s conditions of confinement
throughout this case, which were based on regular communications between the Government and
Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) legal counsel. As a result, the Court already has exceptional insight
into the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is well aware of the many privileges
the defendant has received while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly disliked her
experience at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she in fact experienced
do not rise to a level of extremity that warrant a downward variance, much less the extent of a
variance the defendant seeks.
8 The defendant argues that she should not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who
was convicted of forcible rape following a state jury trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 20). These are different
cases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state
rape case involving adults to a federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant should be
sentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidelines for her extensive crimes against
children. Defendants engaged in sexual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced to significant
sentences of imprisonment in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Maria Soly Almonte, 16 Cr.
670 (KMW) (defendant sentenced to twenty years’ imprisonment for a non-violent child
trafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and
personal experience with sexual abuse). The defendant is not an exception.
