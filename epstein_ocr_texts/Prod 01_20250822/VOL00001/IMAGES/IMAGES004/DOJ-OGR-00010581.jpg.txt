Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670_ Filed 06/22/22 Page 46 of 55

Office recognized, in‘its report, a.significant. sentence “should, promote gencral deterrence against.
the exploitation and-degradation of humans made ‘possible: by this offense, as well. as untouchable
individuals who feel their-privilege and affluence ‘entitle them. to victimize others without fear of
consequence.” (PSR.at.67).*

B. The Deferidant’s Arguments, for a Lenient Sentence Are Unpersuasive

The defendant spends the majority: of her sentencing submission complaining that her
conditions of pretrial confinement: warrant..a downward ‘variance. Not. only are the defendant's
claims inaccurate, but the defense overlooks. the extraordinary steps that the: Court..has ‘taken.
throughout the pendency. of this case’ to oversee’ the conditions of this. defendant’s. confinement.
Indeed, the Court réccived. regular updates regarding ‘the defendant’s conditions of confinement.
throughout this case, which were based ‘on regular communications between the Government and.
Bureau. of Prisons (“BOP”) legal. counsel. Asa, result, the Court: already’ has, exceptional, insight.
into the defendant’s conditions of pretrial confinement and is ‘well aware of the many privileges
the defendant. has received ‘while in custody. Although the defendant has clearly: disliked her
expericnee at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”), the conditions she ‘in fact:expericneed.
do:not rise ‘to a.level of extremity: that ‘warrant a downward ‘variance, ‘much less the extent of.a

variance the defendant secks.

® The defendant argues that she should. not be “sentenced as if she were Harvey Weinstein” who
was convicted of forcible rape following a. state jury’ trial. (Dkt. No. 663 at 20). These are different
cases, under different sentencing regimes, with different facts. It is pointless to compare a state
rape cas¢ involving adults,to, a ‘federal case involving child exploitation. The defendant.should be
sentenced under the applicable federal Sentencing Guidcelitics for her’ extensive crinics against.
children. Defendants engaged in scxual abuse of minors are regularly sentenced. to significant.
sentences of imprisonment i in this District. See, e.g:, United States v. Maria Sol: Almonte, 16 ‘Cr.
670 (KMW) (defendant ‘sentenced to twenty. ‘years’ imprisonment, for a non-violent. child.
trafficking scheme, notwithstanding mitigating factors, including defendant’s poverty and,
personal. experience with sexual abuse). The. defendant is not an exception.
