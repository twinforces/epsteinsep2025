1 THE COURT: Okay.

2 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.

3 THE COURT: Actually, I'm reminded, if we have jurors
4 for me to inquire of, we're going to have them sit in the first
a seat of the jury box and use a handheld mic.

6 There is one issue that the parties briefed over the

7 weekend that you requested to be filed under seal to protect

8 the privacy of the witness who I've permitted to testify under
9 pseudonym. I think I have a few guestions just to see where

10 exactly we are on that, and I think we should do that at

11 sidebar to protect the privacy interests of the witness who I
12 have allowed to testify under pseudonym.

13 So we will do that now.
