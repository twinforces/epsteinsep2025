1 So defense seeks to preclude, in motion in limine 7,

2 Government Exhibit 52. I'm not going to preclude, but I do

3 think this needs to play out at trial. I need to hear the

4 witness testimony and I'll allow voir dire, given factually

5 what I understand to be the issues surrounding this item, and

6 as I understand it -- the witness is going to -- tell me if I

7 have this wrong. The anticipated testimony, Ms. Comey -- this
8 is for you, Ms. Comey -- the anticipated testimony is that not
9 this exact book but a similar-looking book, characteristically
10 similar, binding, pages, font, etc., was seen by this witness,
11 and she can attempt to authenticate by describing the

12 Similarities between what is Government Exhibit 52 and what she
13 saw. Is that the idea?

14 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. Because this

15 witness has not been informed about how that exhibit came into
16 the government's possession, I just wanted to clarify one small
17 thing, which is that this witness won't say that this isn't one
18 of the -- you know, in particular, that because she recognizes
19 it as one in a series, but doesn't know how it came to the
20 government's possession, it's just identifying it in that way.
21 THE COURT: So your understanding is, by the time
22 frame, this wouldn't have been the one that she saw, but she
23 won't know that because you anticipate her testimony to be
24 there were several versions of these and they are all the same.
25 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor.
