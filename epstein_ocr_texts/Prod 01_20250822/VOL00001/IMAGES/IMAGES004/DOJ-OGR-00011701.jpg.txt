1 Epstein's sexual abuse evolved over the course of a decade.

2 You will learn that in the 1990s, they used the cover of

3 mentoring young girls, of promising them scholarships and

4 opportunity, to introduce massage, inviting them on trips and

a transporting them across state lines, and that you will learn

6 that they used these so called massages as a way to sexually

7 abuse the victims.

8 During that earlier phase, the defendant and Epstein

9 had to find each girl individually themselves, but by the early
10 2000s, the defendant and Epstein found an easier way to

11 maintain a continuous flow of girls to abuse. They were no

12 longer finding girls through the cover of scholarships and

13 opportunity. Instead, they devised a pyramid scheme of abuse,
14 a scheme that no longer required the defendant to personally

15 find young girls for Epstein.

16 So what did the defendant and Epstein do? They

17 encouraged girls to bring other girls. They asked the girls if
18 they had any young friends to bring over. And when a girl

19 brought someone new, she was rewarded with cash, extra cash on
20 top of the hundreds of dollars she got for giving Epstein a
2l sexualized massage. The defendant and Epstein handed hundred
22 dollar bills to poor teenage girls in exchange for them giving
23 Epstein so called massages. To be clear, those girls were not
24 professional masseuses â€” they were kids being sexually
25 exploited and abused.
