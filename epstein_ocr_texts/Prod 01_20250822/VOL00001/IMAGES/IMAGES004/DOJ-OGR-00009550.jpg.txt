The potential impropriety that, warrants. a hearing ‘is not, that, someone with a-history. of,
sexual abusesmay have served on the jury. Rather, it.is Juror 50°s potential. failure to, respond
truthfully to questions during the jury selection-process that asked, for:such.material information.
‘so that ‘any potential bias could be explored.. Accordingly, the Court will hold. a hearing ‘Jimited.
in. scope to, Juror 50’s. answers t6 Questions 25 and. 48 of the questionnaire.

C. The Defendant has not justified. an inquiry:into Juror 50’s social media

The parties devote significant:portions of the bricfs to the question of whether Juror 50
answercd.falscly the Court’s questions about social media‘usage during voir dire. To theextent
that the Defendant sceks a hearing to probe Juror.50’s answers to voir.dire about.his social ‘media
‘usage, her arguments are based on speculation, and. she has failed to make the high. showing
required. See Baker, 899. F.3d.at.130. At voir dire, when. asked. if he “usc[s] social. media,” Juror
50 stated, “I do, but I actually just deleted them because | just got. out of a relationship and. |
didn’t want-to, scé anything regarding them. So lam. fully off of itright now.” Nov. 16,2021 Tr.
at 133. The Courtthen asked, “What didyou-use, Facebook, Twitter?” to which Juror 50 replied
‘“Faecbook and.Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts, contained “[p]ersonal stuff, like selfics:”
Id.

The screenshots proffered. by the Defendant do not-demonstrate that.any of these answers
implicate McDonough. First, Juror 50 did not deny having a. Twitter account. Second, Juror
50’s account-had only ‘1. follower-and followed. only 39 people, which corroborates that-his
Twitter use was, at most, relatively:minimal. See Maxwell Br.'at-17. ‘Third, the fact-that.Juror
50°s Twitter aceount’was opened:in April. 2021 and that he'used it again in January 2022, after
the completion of the trial, is consistent'with Juror 50’s answer that he: deleted his social media

accounts, or just’the social. media. applications, shortly before voir dire. The same is true of Juror
