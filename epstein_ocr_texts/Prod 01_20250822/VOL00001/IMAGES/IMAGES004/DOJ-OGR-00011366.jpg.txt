that the alleged sexualized massages occurred. These alleged sexualized massages are the basis
of the charges in this case.

The government seeks to preclude testimony from Eva, Michelle, and Kelly on the
ground that their testimony does not contradict Jane’s allegations and that, in any event, their
testimony concerns “collateral matters” The government is wrong on both counts.

A. Eva Dubin’s testimony will contradict Jane’s testimony.

Eva Dubin’s testimony will contradict Jane’s testimony. As to Eva, this is what Jane
testified to on the stand:

e “[A] woman named Eva... joined in” the group sexualized massages. TR at 525.
e Eva “joined in [the group sexualized massages] with Sophie.” /d. at 526.

e Eva “joined in the group scenario.” /d.

e Eva “knew the routine.” /d.

e Eva “could confirm her story.” Jd.

In her interviews with the government, Jane had this to say about Eva. In a February 2020

interview with the government, see 3509-008, p 4, Jane said:
e Jane’s first sexual encounter with Mr. Epstein occurred in the pool house. /d. at 4.
e The next sexual encounter occurred in the bedroom or the massage room. /d.
e There was a short period of time in which the encounters only involved Mr. Epstein. /d.
e Ms. Maxwell then became involved. /d.
e The first time Ms. Maxwell was involved, there were two other girls as well—Sophie and

Eva, who joined in. /d.
