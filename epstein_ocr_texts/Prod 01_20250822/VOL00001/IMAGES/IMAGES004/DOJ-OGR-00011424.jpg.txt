Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

I write in response to the motions to quash Ms. Maxwell’s Rule 17(c) subpoena to the
Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (EVCP). Four motions to quash were filed, one each by
the government,! the administrator of the EVCP, Accuser-2, and Witness-3. Neither Accuser-]
nor Accuser-4 moved to quash. As explained below, the arguments against enforcement of Ms.
Maxwell’s subpoena lack merit, and this Court should deny the motions to quash.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

On November 15, this Court issued a Rule 17(c) subpoena to the EVCP at the request of
Ms. Maxwell. The subpoena is narrow, specific, and targeted. It seeks just four categories of

' There is significant doubt whether the government has standing to move to quash, cither
in its own capacity or on behalf of the accusers. See United States v. Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d
552, 558-61 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (recognizing a common “misunderstanding of the concept of
standing to quash a Rule 17(c) subpoena” and concluding the government lacked standing to
move to quash in its own capacity or on behalf of the third parties). Even so, because the
administrator of the EVCP and two of the accusers moved to quash, Ms. Maxwell will respond to
all the arguments made in opposition to her subpoena, even the government’s.
