accommodation. She never asked for anything in return. These are the actions of a
fundamentally good and decent person, with great empathy for others and a capacity for
altruism. This is the real — the true — Ghislaine whom | know and love as her brother.

My sister was fortunate — as | and my siblings were too - in benefitting from an
outstanding formal education which culminated for Ghislaine with a good degree from
Oxford University. She put that achievement to good effect, using amongst other skills her
gift for foreign languages and networking abilities to start up, invest in and develop
numerous businesses in the UK and in the US, employing people, making a difference,
making a contribution.

Perhaps her single most important contribution is to have converted a lifelong passion
for conservation and the oceans into a non-profit, The TerraMar Project, to create a robust
awareness program and a thriving social network around the oceans at a time when they
were perhaps not so high up the conservation agenda as they are today. TerraMar ran from
2012 to 2019 and at its peak had hundreds of thousands of visitors to its website and many
thousands of subscribers to its programs. None of this would have happened but for
Ghislaine’s determination, her hard work and capacity for organizing and mobilizing and
sheer perseverance as well as financial generosity in sustaining TerraMar over the years.
Those personal efforts of hers (along with others from key corporate supporters and
sponsors), were acknowledged when the U.N. made oceans conservation one of their 17
Sustainable Development Goals for 2015-30.

| believe Ghislaine still has much to contribute to the world if she is given a meaningful
opportunity to do so.

Sincerely yours,
lan Maxwell
