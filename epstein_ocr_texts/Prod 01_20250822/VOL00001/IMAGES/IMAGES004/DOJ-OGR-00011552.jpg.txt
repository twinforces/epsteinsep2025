1 clearer, your Honor, this notion that she was somehow -- Sarah
2 Kellen was an assistant of both Epstein and Maxwell is again

3 belied by the trial record.

4 If you look at Larry Visoski'ts testimony, which I

a believe is what the government is relying on there, he

6 originally testified, oh, I think she was an assistant for

7 both. But on cross-examination, he conceded that he really

8 didn't know what her role was, and his best recollection was

9 that she was an assistant for Epstein.

10 And again, just look again at Cimberly Espinosa's

11 testimony who was the actual assistant for Ms. Maxwell, and she
12 says unequivocally, "I was her assistant. Kellen was Epstein's
13 assistant." So there is no fair inference that Ms. Maxwell was
14 supervising Sarah Kellen. The inference is exactly the

15 opposite, and it can't provide a basis for that leadership

16 enhancement.

17 THE COURT: All right. Anything further on the

18 enhancements for the government's objection?

19 MS. MOE: Your Honor, just very briefly with respect
20 to the leadership question, I just want to direct the Court's
21 attention, we noted this on page 27 of our brief, but the
22 testimony at trial was that Carolyn recalled that even after
23 Sarah Kellen took over calling to schedule massages, Maxwell
24 was still present inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn
25 arrived for massage appointments.
