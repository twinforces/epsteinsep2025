VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT OF SARAH RANSOME TO BE READ AT THE
SENTENCING OF GHISLAINE MAXWELL

private island St. Little James in the US Virgin Islands. On one visit to the island, the sexual
demands, degradation and humiliation became so horrific that I tried to escape by attempting to
jump off a cliff into shark-infested waters, but was caught by Maxwell and company moments

one more time.

As the evidence at the trial of Ms. Maxwell proved, and my own experience confirms,
Maxwell was Epsteinâ€™s right-hand woman. She was the manager of several recruiters and many
