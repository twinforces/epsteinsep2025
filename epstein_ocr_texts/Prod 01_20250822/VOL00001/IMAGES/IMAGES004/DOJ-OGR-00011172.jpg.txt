for a:criminal prosecution. against them.

Tn circumstances’ such as these, “itis most important ‘to have a measure of accountability and
for the public to have confidence in the administration of justice.” Lugosch, 435. F.3d.at- 1:19
(quoting United Siates.v. Amodéo (Amodeo Il), 71,F.3d 1044, 1.048. (2d Cir. 1995)).

Although. the g government claims that the items must remain scaled duc:to an“ongoing
investigation,” they have failed to:explain why. Beyond their ipse dixit pronouncement, the
same materials they obtained. via, their ex parte and in.cumera procedure are’ being released to
the public under the Ginffre unscaling process, without objection from, the government. The
name of the subpocna:recipient (Boics Schiller) andthe ndmes of Chicf Judge: McMahon and.
Magistrate Judge, Netburn. (who issued their rulings nearly two years ago) certainly cannot
alone compromise any: such. purported investigation. The government submission thus fails to
demonstrate that denial of public access is “essential to: preserve higher valucs and is narrowly
tailored to serve that interest.” United States'v: Aref, ‘533. F.3d 72, 82 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting
Press-Enterprise If, 478 U.S. at 13-14).

Ms. Maxwell believes that this. Court:has the jurisdiction in connection with this criminal case
to:determine whether to keep under scal, testimony: that occurred before Chicf Judge
McMahon, that gave rise’ to this prosecution, especially as those documents. have now become
‘Judicial documents” by-virtuc of the:pretrial ‘motions in this case. If the Court prefers,
however, Ms. Maxwell will first. make application to Chief Judge MeMahon to unscal those:
‘matcrials.

Objections to Redactions Proposcd.on Pages 187-188:

Ms. Maxwell also objécts to the government’s proposed redactions on pages 187-188. The:
language at:issuc there concerns a diary that Accscr-2 has publicly and repeatedly claimed
supports her allegations. Importantly, Accuscr-2 read from.this allegedly corroborating diary
ona.NY Times podeast. Yet:now the government.sccks to redact her explanation for why ‘Ms.
Maxwell is not:mentioned once in this diary: Accuscr-2 “stopped writing inher journal about;
a month after that first: mecting with Epstein” ‘and the rest:of her diary. is “personal in nature
and ha[s] nothing‘to do withthe. defendant or Epstein.”

How that document, or-its origin, incompleteness, or lack of corroborating content could now’
be “confidential” is unexplained. by. the g government in ‘its request. Certainly, Accuser-2 has

not acted as though the contents are “confidential.”

‘Objections to Government’s: Proposed.Redactions to Exhibit 5'

For similar'reasons, Ms. Maxwell objects to certain.of the redactions proposed by the
government'to Exhibit 5 to their, Response. The materials highlighted. in our attached Exhibit
5 are all very:public: picces of information, at the instigation of Virginia Roberts. The
government has offered no explanation. for their:nced to protect her “privacy” interests when
she has profited with her numerous podcasts, ‘Netflix. appearances. and.other media.
