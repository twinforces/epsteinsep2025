Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 700 Filed 07/12/22 Page6of6
Alessi is therefore a witness able to authenticate the Government Exhibit 606. Although

the manual itself is dated to 2005 on its face, Alessi is expected to testify that the exhibit is largely
unchanged from the version he had when he received from the defendant and Epstein. He is
therefore a witness with “knowledge that a matter is what it is claimed to be,” which “is sufficient
to satisfy [the authentication] standard.” United States v. Gagliardi, 506 F.3d 140, 151 (2d Cu.
2007); see id. (“Based on the[] testimony [that electronic communications were accurate], a
reasonable juror could have found that the exhibits did represent those conversations,
notwithstanding that the e-mails and online chats were editable.”).°

Respectfully submitted,

° The Government also expects another employee of Epstein’s (“Employee-2”) to also be able to
