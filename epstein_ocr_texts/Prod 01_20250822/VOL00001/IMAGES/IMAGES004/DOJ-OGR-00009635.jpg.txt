1. Whether Juror 50 Accurately Answered Questions 25 and 48
First, the Court should ask Juror 50 to answer Questions 25 and 48, to determine what the
accurate answers are:

¢ Question 48: Have you ora friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual
harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?

e Question 48(a) asks the juror to “please explain.” Consistent with the Court’s
practice at voir dire, the Government submits that the Court should ask Juror 50
whether he feels comfortable explaining in open court what happened to him, or
whether he would prefer to do so at sidebar. The Government notes that Juror 50
does not appear to have shared any of the details of his personal experience with
sexual abuse in his interviews with media outlets. Moreover, Juror 50’s counsel
expressed concern about Juror 50’s privacy rights regarding disclosing intimate
details of his experience as the victim of sexual abuse. (Dkt. No. 608 at 6-7). The
Government further notes that the Court did not ask prospective jurors at voir dire
to provide detailed accounts of their experiences with sexual abuse or sexual
assault, and thus Juror 50 should not be required to give a detailed account of his
personal experiences, because the Court has already determined that such details
are not necessary to determining a juror’s qualifications and an inquiry mimicking
that which would have occurred during voir dire is consistent with the hypothetical
inquiry called for by Second Circuit case law. See United States v. Stewart, 433
F.3d 273, 304 (2d Cir. 2006).

¢ Question 25: Have you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim
of a crime? The Government respectfully notes that unlike Question 48 of the
