10 MR. HOBSON: Your Honor, there are two large topics

11 that Mr. Vega is anticipated to testify about. I think it is
12 consistent with what Mr. DeMarco says is, one, he was a

13 percipient witness to the shooting itself; and two, he observed
14 the victim's injuries after the shooting and was involved in

15 the victim's care in the 10 years between the shooting and the
16 victim's death. I take it it is the second category that the
17 defendant is objecting to. But here, cause of death is

18 obviously a big issue in this case and it is something that it
19 is our burden to prove, that the injuries from the shooting
20 lead to his death. And we expect the evidence to show that, as
21 a result of the shooting, the victim became paralyzed from the
22 waist down and that meant that he was confined to a
23 wheelchair -- whereas he was not in a wheelchair before -- and
24 developed serious complications as a result of that including
25 serious sores which later led to infection and the victim's
