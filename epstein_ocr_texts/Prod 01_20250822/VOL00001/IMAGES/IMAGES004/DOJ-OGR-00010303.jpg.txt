sexual assault. In cach. case, during voir dire, cach juror affirmed to the Court that he or'she could.
be: fair and impartial. Not only did the Court not. strike cach of thosé cight jurors for cause, but
neither party:even. moved to do:so.on these: grounds. :(See: Dkt. No. 643 at 4-6, 20). Thus, if Juror
50 had,disclosed his history of sexual abuse in,the written,questionnaire, the Court would not have
imincdiately granted a challenge for cause, but would have,.instead asked additional follow-up
questions. Juror 50’s answers tothe follow-up questions, as given at the hearing, showed that he
could be fair and impartial notwithstanding his, prior:experience.

The defendant cannot ‘demonstrate that Juror 50 was biased. At.the hearing, Juror SO
repeatedly denied. that he harbored. any bias or feclings one way or another with respect.to the
defendant or the Government. (See Mar. 8, 2022 Tr at. 26:1°5-20; sce also. id, at 2713-17
(explaining that. he had “no doubt” as to his ability to be fair to both, sides); id. at 26:21-23 (“Q.
Did'you want to‘put yourthumb on the scale in any’ direction? A. No.”)). To'the contrary, Juror
SO consistently testified that he was ‘fair and. impartial in. this, case and that he rendered. a ‘verdict
with Juror 50’s statements during oral.‘voir dire, during which, Juror 50 reaffirmed that he was
“[a]bsolutely” able to put aside anything that he read or heard.about the defendant and decide the
case based on the facts and.evidence, or lack of evidence, presented in court, and follow the: Court’s

instructions as to the law. (Nov. 16,2021 Tr: at 130:12-18: sce a/s6 id. at 131:1-7; see also id. at

> Juror 50°s comment that he was’ not concerned. about: following the Court’s instructions while
filling out the questionnaire (Mar. 8, 2022 Tr. at.18:1'7-18) does not support the dcfendant’s motion
‘for a new trial. As Juror 50 later explained, that response ‘was, derived. fromthe fact that he “began
to float, fly through it, in order to. get done” and. was “super distracted.” (Ud. at. 40:18-20). It did,
not reflect a. gencral disobedience: of the Court’s instructions, and indeed, Juror 50 made clear that
he carefully: followed the Court’s instructions during voir. dire—during which he paid attention to
the Court’s instructions, listened. carefully to the Court’s questions, “answered.cvery single one of
those, questions ‘accurately,” and, did not “at. all” fail “to pay attention ‘to the, specifics of the
questions”—and:during trial. (/d. at.4121-24).
