1 commissioned by Epstein, painted. She painted her young

2 siblings. She worked in Epstein's New York home while it was

3 under renovation. And she was eager and excited for Annie to

4 meet Epstein. She hoped that Epstein could help promote her

5) ambitions. So she came to New York when she was 16 and she met
6 Epstein. Epstein alone. Ghislaine was not there; she was not
7 in the country. It was just Annie, her sister, and Epstein.

8 She found New York thrilling. She even wrote about it ina

9 diary. And she was planning a school enhancement trip to

10 Thailand. And her sister encouraged her to meet Epstein for

11 his support.

12 Now, some time later, with her mother's permission,

13 Annie at 16 went to Santa Fe. That was the first and only time
14 she ever met Ghislaine, and nothing criminal happened there.

15 And you will learn that she was above the age of consent in New
16 Mexico.

17 MS. COMEY: Objection.

18 THE COURT: I need to hear from you.
