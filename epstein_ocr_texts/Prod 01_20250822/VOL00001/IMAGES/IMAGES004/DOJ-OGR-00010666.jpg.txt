Once arrested, Maxwell faced ‘another choice. She could, admit her participation in this.
scheme, acknowledge the harm caused or even provide information that, could have helped, hold.
others accountable. Instead, she again. chosé ‘to lic. about her behavior, causing additional harm to
all.of those she: victimized. Forme, it: meant having, to be involved in this nearly ‘two-ycar legal
process that: involved reliving this painful, experience over and over again. It was incredibly
stressful. and interrupted. my ‘professional, life as I; missed, sessions with my’ clients for court:
appearances, trial prep, and mectings with attorneys. An‘uncertain and:shifting trial schedule: made
it difficult to, plan. anything. As the trial. date. drew closer, | sealed back my caseload, as 1 'wasn’t.
sure how::it. would impact me and how:much work I’d have to:miss. Then, during the trial, my:
memories were repeatedly: called into question, and | was publicly grilled. on the details of the
trauma she’perpctrated. Given the shame'and self-doubt that,these injuries had already causcd, this
all felt. like a retraumatization=one that. could have been casily: avoided.had ‘she told the truth.

Judge Nathan, I hope when you consider the appropriate prison. sentence for the role
Maxwell played. i in this:scx ‘trafficking operation, you take into account the: ongoing suffering of
the many women she abused, and exploited, as we will continue to live with the memories of the
ways she harmed us. | hope you weigh, the systemic cffects of the erimes, she perpetrated—the
ways that our family niembers,:;romantic partners, and friends have becn.hurt through our suffering.
Task ‘you ‘to bear in, mind. how Maxwell’s unwillingness to acknowledge her:crimes, her lack, of
remorse, and her repeated. lies about her victims created the need. for many of'us to engage ‘ina
long fight for justice that has felt like:a black hole sucking in ourprecious time, energy, and well-
being for:much too ‘long now.. These things ‘cannot! be replaced,

Respectfully,

Sigrid S. McCawley
