Furthermore, it would. be improper for the Court to. rely on, Carolyn’s recollection and, the.
message slips to find that the offense conduct. lasted ‘until. 2005 because the government: alleged
inthe $2 Indictment:that:the offense: conduct ended “in. or about 2004,” not “in or. about:2005.”
The initial indictment charged Ms. Maxwell with offenses that lasted “up to.and including in or
about 1997.” (Ind. 49°9, 13, 15, 19). The $2 Indictment, which the government filed after it had
located and iintervicwed. Carolyn, charged offense conduet-that lasted.“up to and including in or
about 2004.” (S2.Ind. 4% 11,1723, 27). The expanded.end date of the 'S2 Indictment was based.
solely on.Carolyn’s anticipated testimony and.corroborating evidence. Yet:the government
alleged that the offense conduet ended, in 2004, even though the government knew Carolyn’s
recollection of when she last visited. Epstein and.was. aware of the two. message slips when it
filed the S2 Indictment. ‘The: Court:should. hold the: government to its allegations.and not allow it
to expand the end date of the offense conduct for purposes of sentencing. See United States v.
Bennett, 37 F.3d 687, 700 (1" Cir. 1994) (“In determining “the last date of the offense of
conviction” for ex postfacto purposes and. ... Application Note [2 of § IB1..l1], it is only
reasonable to hold‘the: Government to its own alleged dates.”).

For these: reasons, the. record is insufficient for the Court to find that the offense conduct
continued: past November 1, 2004, the effective date of the: 2004 Guidelines. ‘The:Court must
therefore apply the 2003. Guidclines'to, avoid. an ex post facto violation.

C. The Goals of Sentencing Are-Not Served by Applying the More Onerous
2004 Guidelines Based Solely on Epstein’s Conduct.

Ifthe Court finds. that'the offense. conduct continucd-past November 1.2004, it should
nevertheless. vary downwardly and.sentence Ms. Maxwell as if the 2003.Guidelines apply. The:
varianee would account for the fact that Ms. Maxwell had stopped actively participating in.the

offense conduct’ by 2003 at the latest, when the carlicr Guidelines Were in. cffeet.. Such.a
