Porensic-Psychiatric Report
Ghislaine Maxwell
FORMULATION

Ms. Maxwell ts a 59-year-old Caucasian woman, who 1s being evaluated at the request
of her attorney in order to assess her current mental state and risk of flight.

Ms. Maxwell has consistent described, and complained formally of, being subject to
unfair and inconsistent treatment by correction officers and ongoing sleep deprivation
throughout her incarceration. Research indicates that the experience of unfairness, disrespect,
and a lack of safety significantly contributes to psychological distress in incarcerated
individuals.* Furthermore, recent research on the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive
functioning states that “sleep deprivation resulted in a loss of cognitive flexibility through
feedback blunting...sleep deprivation causes a fundamental problem with dynamic attentional
control.”* Furthermore, one study showed that:

Relative to baseline, sleep deprivation was associated with lower scores on Total EO (decreased global
emotional intelligence), Intrapersonal functioning (reduced self-regard, assertiveness, sense of independence,
and self-actualzation), Interpersonal functioning (reduced empathy toward others and quality of
interpersonal relationships), Stress Management skills (reduced impulse control and difficulty with delay of
gratification), and Behavioral Coping (reduced positive thinking and action orientation). Esoteric Thinking
(greater reliance on formal superstitions and magical thinking processes) was increased?
