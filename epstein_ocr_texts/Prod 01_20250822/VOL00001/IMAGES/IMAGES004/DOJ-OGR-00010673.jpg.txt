wanted. The art was always pure and beautiful, something I now recognize. Ghislaine, Epstein and
Wexner are the ones who should have carried the shame for perverting what was beautiful.

It should be known that Ghislaine's impact on my life cannot be understated. Once she
gleaned from Vicky Ward (Vanity Fair) that I went to the FBI, my life no longer belonged to me.
Aside from living in poverty and obscurity, Ihave also now had to face public scrutiny as a whistle-
blower. I am bullied regularly.

Ghislaine changed everything for the worse. She seemingly derailed me without thought,
after I got in her way. She assured me that I could be killed walking down my favorite path in
NYC. I never feel safe outside as a result of the massive trauma from being held captive by
Wexnerâ€™s thugs via Ghislaine and Jeffrey. Her threats have never left my mind and I believe she
will harm me if she ever has a way. Please keep this in mind when determining her terms of
imprisonment. She is a very dangerous and devious individual.

Respectfully,
Sigrid S. McCawley
