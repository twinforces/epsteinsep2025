1 no because you didn't consider them family.

2 A. Family, yeah.

3 Q. But now you say yes because it would have been a

4 stepbrother. Explain.

5 A. Because by law, by marriage, that person was my

6 stepbrother. So when you read the question that way and it

7 says has a friend or family member ever been accused, then the
8 correct answer would have been yes, a friend or family member.
9 Q. Okay. And so the same response then for 48A is what you
10 would have given for 49B?
11 A. Yes, your Honor.
12 Q. And 49B, if your answer to 49 was yes, do you believe this
13 would affect your ability to serve fairly and impartially as a
14 juror in this case?
15 A. In no case. It would not affect me.
16 Q. In responding a moment ago you said you never thought you
17 would be chosen as a juror in this case. Why is that?
18 A. Only because the sheer volume of people that were there.
19 It was insane, the amount of people. So I just never
20 thought -- number one, I didn't know what it was when I went
21 into it, and then when they played the video of you, I just
22 thought that the likelihood of being chosen, surely they will
23 be interviewing thousands of people. And they ultimately
24 choose twelve people to sit on a jury, and I never thought I
25 would be one of those twelve.
