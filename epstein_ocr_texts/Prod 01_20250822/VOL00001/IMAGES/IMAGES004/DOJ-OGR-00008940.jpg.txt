Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document600 _ Filed 02/11/22 Page 16 of 37

The government;therefore' affirmatively stated on several occasions that the “core of
criminality” of the Mann Act. offenses was a scheiic to cause undcraged, girls to travel to New
York:to engage in. sexual activity:that-violated New York law. It follows, then, that.cvidence:that
an-underaged girl;traveled to any other state’besides: New York,and engaged ‘in, sexual ‘activity’
that was :llegal-urider that state’s laws would be insufficient, by itself, 'to convict Ms. Maxwell of
the Mann.Act counts.” ‘If Ms. Maxwell were convicted on.the Mann Act.counts based solcly: on,
such conduct, that would be a constructive amendment of the charges in the Indictment. See
Millstein, 401.F.3d at65 (“When:the trial evidence or the jury charge operates to broaden. the
possible bases for conviction ftom that which appeared, in the indictment, the indictment, has
been constructively amended.” (cleaned. up)); see also id. at 65 (constructive aniendment. found
when ‘defendant-was. convicted of misbranding drugs on.an entirely distinct misbranding theory
than, the one charged. in the indictment); Wozniak, 126 F.3d at 106-08 (constructive amendment
found when. defendant'was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine aiid.

Roshko, 969 F.2d at:4-6 (constructive amendment. found when, defendant was charged: with’ a,
conspiracy to change:the immigration status of'an alien, but the proof.at.trial related:to a
conspiracy with an entircly, distinct object).

D. There is a Substantial Likelihood that Ms. Maxwell Was Convicted on Three
of the Mann Act Counts Based on Conduct. Not Charged. in the Indictment.

Yet-there is a, substantial, likclihood that this ‘is exactly what.happened in this case: Jane’s
testimony about sexual activity that. occurred in. New Mexico, which did:not violate: New York

law, combined. with insufficient jury instructions and the Court’s refusal to give the jury

*'Engaging:in sexual activity<in any other state:cannot form the’ basis.for, a violation:of New York law. See People. v:
Carvajal, 6 NIY.34 305, 3:12:(2005): (“GPL.20.20[] has ‘codificd:the general principle'that, for.New Y-ork:to exercise!
criminal jurisdiction, some.alleged conduct ora consequence of. that conduct:must have occurred.in the:state.”).
