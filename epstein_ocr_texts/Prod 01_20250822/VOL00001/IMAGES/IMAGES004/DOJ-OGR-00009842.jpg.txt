overbreadth of this information is evidenced by the impracticality of production: Even in criminal
investigations, the Government cannot obtain such communications with a subpoena; the
Government must obtain a search warrant upon a showing of probable cause. See Stored
Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2703. In response to such warrants, social media platforms

timeframe—often a high volume of material—and the Government reviews the warrant returns to
determine what specific materials are responsive. Thus, if the subpoena the defendant requests
were issued, the defendant would likely obtain a high volume of Juror 50’s irrelevant personal
social media communications. A convicted defendant cannot be permitted to invade the privacy
of a juror in this manner. Finally, Request 2(c) seeks documentation of the dates on which Juror
50 opened and closed his social media accounts, but as discussed above, the defendant has failed
to establish that a hearing is warranted as to Juror 50’s statements about his use of social media,
so there is no basis to compel the production of such irrelevant information.
