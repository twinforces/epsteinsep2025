~ OPINION & ORDER
Ghislaine Maxwell,
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

Before the Court is the Defendant’s motion for a new trial pursuant to Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 33, which the Government opposes. See Maxwell Br., Jan. 19, 2022; Gov.

nondisclosure. She also argues a broader hearing is required based on a news article that
suggests a second juror was allegedly a victim of sexual abuse. /d. at 49. The Government urges
this Court to deny the Defendant’s motion on the current record, but it consents to a limited
hearing on the issue of whether Juror 50 provided a materially false answer to Question 48 of the
questionnaire. Gov. Br. at 31-32.

The Defendant’s motion for a new trial based on the current record is DENIED.
Defendant’s motion on the current record relies extensively on statements made by Juror 50
