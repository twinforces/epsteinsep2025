If a potential juror selected either “yes” option, the questionnaire asked individuals
to explain their answer in writing, to state whether having been a victim of sexual assault,
sexual abuse, or sexual harassment would affect their ability to serve fairly and
impartially, and if so, to explain why.

Finally, Question 50 asked potential jurors if there was any experience that they
had that might affect their ability to serve fairly and impartial as a juror.

Six-hundred and ninety-four individuals answered the questionnaire.
