did. not-disclose that in‘response to ‘Question:49, which asks whether a family member has ever
been accused of sexual abuse. (Tr. 11-13). Juror'50 originally answered that “no” was an
accurate’ response because he “never considered, them, part of my family even when, they lived
‘with us for a few years.” (Tr. 11). That response contradicted a response he gave only a few"
minutes carlicr ‘concerning Question.48, when he: first described the abusc:to the Court. There,
he said.he was abused by “a family member, who is:no longer part of the family.” (Tr..8). He
then. quickly changed his answer and returned to, his familiar refrain that he. “flew threw” the
questionnaire:and said he “didn’t even consider” whether his' stepbrother was'a family member.

‘it’s a little illogical thinking about it, like if I lied deliberately | wouldn’t.have told a soul.” (Tr.
22-23). The Court. continued to press. after his'unresponsive answer. When asked. if he thought.
about the fact that many. ‘people would. learn about his sexual. abuse, he responded.“No, I did
not.” (Tr. 23). He:later.added that. he thought “a little article about a juror giving their
expericnee, wouldn’t be:record-breaking or really in the news.at all.” (Tr.:42). That;1s ‘absolute:

nonsense. Juror.50 had numicrous nicdia outlets pursuiig him fo
