Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670 Filed 06/22/22 Page 52 0f55

claims that multiple abuses, all, of which’BOP has concluded were unfounded, were somehow not.
caught.on camera. At. bottom, the defendant:does not like jail. But the defendant’s experiences at.
the MDC come nowhere near justifying a. downward. variance from the Guidelines range.
Finally, it bears emphasizing that the defendant has told, blatant: lics about her conditions.
of confinément. She repeatedly’ claims;to have suffered. significant’ hair loss, but’ anyone who has
seen the defendant in, court can, casily sce that is not true. She repeatedly claims to ‘have lost an.
extreme, amount of weight, but, as, noted above, BOP medical records make clear that; she has not.
The defendant is perfectly healthy, with a full head of hair. Throughout trial, she was visibly:
engaged.in, her defense, often actively communicating with defense counsel throughout each stage
of the trial. Given the defénse’s exaggerated claims that the conditions of confinement somchow’
‘deteriorated.the defendant to the point of struggling to assist. in her own defense, the Government.
respectfully requests that; the Court put on, the record at sentencing the Court’s own observations
of the defendant’s appearance and demeanor throughout the: proceedings inthis case.
IV. _ Financial:Penalties
In addition to a Guidclines, sentence of incarecration, the Government:respectfully submits
that the Court-should:impose the maximum -fine-allowable under statute. Because cach of'thethree
counts of conviction, carrics a maximum fine of $250,000, the maximum total allowable is
$750,000. That ariourt constitutes a mere drop in. the bucket for a multi-millionaire like the
‘defendant, but: it nevertheless sends the: message ‘that: a ‘defendant who uses ‘wealth to accomplish.
criminal, activity will suffer financial losses in addition to the loss of liberty.. No amount-of money
can. undo the harm. that the deféndant’s, crimes have done, but given the deférdant’s. substantial
means, the: majority of which appears to: have come from her co-conspirator, a hefty ‘fine is

certainly*warranted inthis case.
