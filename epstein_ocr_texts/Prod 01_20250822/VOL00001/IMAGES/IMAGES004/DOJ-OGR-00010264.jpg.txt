1 THE COURT: All right. I think simultaneous briefing
2 is appropriate. For one, I have responsive briefing on the

3 legal issues, and so really what we're talking about is

4 argument following based on today's record.

5 One week from today, the 15th. Simultaneous briefing,
6 I don't care if you call it letter briefing or otherwise. As

7 you know, all I care is that it's double-spaced so I can read
8 it on my iPad. Fifteen pages max per side.

9 Anything else from the government?

10 MS. POMERANTZ: No, your Honor. Thank you.

11 MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, I would just request that
12 our submission of questions which was sent to chambers be made
13 a part of this record.

14 THE COURT: Yes. As I've said, I will docket

15 everything. There's identifying information of Juror 50 in

16 your submitted questions. So that needs to be redacted.

17 But other than Juror 50 identifying information, the
18 redactions for all materials, I believe, for all materials

19 based on the post-trial briefing and the submitted questions
20 can be publicly docketed.
21 Is that correct? As well as my opinion had two lines
22 of redactions. So I'll docket my opinion without redactions.
23 T'll ask the parties to -- actually, I think we can handle the
24 submitted questions, the redactions for identifying
25 information.
