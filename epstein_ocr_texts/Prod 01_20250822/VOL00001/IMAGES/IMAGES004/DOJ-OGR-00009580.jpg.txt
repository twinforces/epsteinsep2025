‘related. to.a.trip even if her role was limited to arranging the return flight. Indeed, the deferidant’s
current understanding of the:note’s question was not her initial view, which triggered.the defense
to repeatedly request an instruction about the “purpose of the travel?” (Tr. 31383.see Tr. 3.1311
(requesting that the Court’ direct’ the jury’s attention to. thé requirement ‘that. illegal. activity was a.
“significant and.motivating purpose” ‘of the travcl)).

It is therefore too difficult. to ‘parse the ‘note into.a, particular sct.of facts and a question,

defendant presumes that the jury note indicates that the jurors “decided that. there was no
corroborating evidence that Ms. Maxwell was present for, orhelped. arrange, any of Jane’s trips to
New York, but that the flight logs did corroborate that Ms. Maxwell was present for her trip to
New‘Mexico,”’ so “the jury began. evaluating Ms.’ Maxwell’s involvement;in the New Mexico trip

did. Indeed, it'would be odd for'the jury to reject-all of Janc’s testimony: about travel'to, New York
and. the ensuing’ sexual abuse: in New York for lack of corroboration, and then conclude. that the:
defendant arranged.an unidentified commercial:return flight.for which there is no specific evidence
in. the record, including no, spécific corroboration of the défendant’s role in. arranging that: flight.
(See Tr..3133 (defense argument that there is “no.evidence” the defendant arranged. a return flight
from: New Mexico)). And there is no reason the jury would. have rejected Jane’s testimony about.
