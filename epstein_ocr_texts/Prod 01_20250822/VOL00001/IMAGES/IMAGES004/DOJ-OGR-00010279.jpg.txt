within the.state of New: York. (See Instr. No. 17, 19,21). To lawyers, that may seem obvious
because we are familiar with'the concept. of jurisdiction and understand the limited territorial
reach of state criminal statutes. But:to a juror who docs not have legal. training, it.is not so
obvious. Based on the jury instructions they had been given, the jury could:have casily (but:
mistakenly) determined that the sexual, abuse Janie described. in New Mexico was “sexual, activity
for which any*person.can be charged with.a criminal offense in,violation of New York law,” as
long as it: met;all the elements of Section. 130.55, even though all. ofthe conduct took place in
New.Mexico. It follows, then, that-the-jury:could. have mistakenly: believed that if they found
that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico, as opposed.to
New York, that: was sufficient to satisfy the second clement. of Count Four.

Ultimately, it is not necessary to determine why the jury was confused.on this point. The
confusion, was. clear on the'face of the Jury’Note.and needed tobe corrected. The defense’s
proposed. supplemental instruction would have-clarified this'very issuc. It stated. in relevant part:

As to. the second. element of Count Four, you must determine whether the

Government, has proven beyond.a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported.

Jane with, the intent that Janc would engage’ in. sexual activity within the stale of

New York in. violation of New York Penal Law 130.55.

‘Dkt. 566 (emphasis added). The defense further explained. that the:instruction needed to be
given, because, according to the Jury’Note, the jury did;not understand that Count Four, “requires
an, intent-to, violate New York law, and vou can ‘tviolate this Section. of New York-law in New
Mexico.” (Tr. 3154) (emphasis added). Butthe Court declined to give this instruction, even,

though neither the Court nor the government.questioned its accuracy. (Tr. 3.148-54).? The

+The Court disagreed with the appropriateness:of the first:paragraph.of the defense’s:proposed instruction and
questioned.the accuracy-of the third paragraph. But-ncither the Court nor the government;challenged.the accuracy of,
the second‘paragraph, which is quotedsabove. (Tr. 3148-54). Moreover, evenif the! Court. disagreed with. the entire
text-of the defense’s* proposed instruction, it was:the Court’s responsibility to give!the jury an appropriate instruction:
thatclarified the intent requirement‘and. prevented a constructive amendment.
