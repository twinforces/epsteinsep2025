that [Ms. Maxwell] was‘not convicted of the crime described in that.core, but of a crime
‘distinetly different’ from the one alleged.” Wnited States v., Gross, No. 1'5-cr-769 (AJN), 2017
WL 4685.1 11,.at #21 (S.D-N.¥..Oct. 18, 2017). In other words, the dispute: is whether there is.a
substantial likelihood, that the jury convicted Ms. Maxwell on.Counts One, Three, ‘and Four
without finding that she intended Jane, and the other victims to engage in Sexual activity in New
York: in violation of New York law, and instead convicted her of a “distinctly different” crime
bascd on.a finding’ that: she intended the illegal sexual activity to occur in New’ Mexico.

Bascd.on.a plain reading of the Jury. Note (Court Exhibit #15), it is substantially likely
that this is exactly what, happened in this case. The government ence again, confidently states
that there ‘is “no likelihood” that this could have occurred because the governnient never argued
this.as a theory of guilt and. the jury instructions required the jury‘to find.that-Ms. Maxwell
intended to'violate New York law. (Opp. at.10). But-that argument:misses the mark entirely.
bare that the jury. was confused about that clement.and had the mistaken belicf that if it found
that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane-to engage ‘in. sexual activity: in, New. Mexico, and:the other
elements of Count’Four were satisfied, it, could convict Ms. Maxwell.on Count Four without
finding that she: intended Jane to crigagé in. sexual activity.in New York.

At that:point, it was incumbent on. the Court to correct the jury’s misunderstanding of an.
essential element:of the offense with a.supplemental instruction, ‘as the defense requested. See
