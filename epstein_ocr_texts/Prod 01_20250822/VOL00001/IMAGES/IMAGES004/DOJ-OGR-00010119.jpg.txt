1 THE COURT: Right. In the end, whatever happens with
2 respect to these matters before the Court, I think that it is

3 in everyone's interest that they travel together wherever

4 they're going.

5 Are there any other matters that counsel want to raise
6 at this time before we fix a schedule for the submission of

7 these briefs?

8 MR. OKULA: No, your Honor. I was just going to

2 suggest most respectfully that perhaps if caunsel for the

10 government and defendants could confer momentarily about a

1i proposed schedule, then we could propose one to the Court.

12 THE COURT: That's fine with me.

13 MR. GAIR; Judge, Mr. Okula is on vacation next week,
14 so I'd like to suggest one week.

15 MR. SHECHTMAN: Judge, if we might be heard?

16 THE COURT: Go ahead.

17 MR. SHECHTMAN: We want very much to accommodate Mr.
13 Okula's vacation, seriously. He has suggested three weeks. I
19 start a trial on Tuesday, a month-long trial. I fully
20 appreciate that I have to write this brief on weekends, and I
21 will, but an extra week would be very helpful. If we could get
22 a month, that would he grand.
23 THE COURT: Fine. You've got it. Do you want to file
24 your briefs on March 16, your initial briefs, or do you want
25 March 23?
