82 (2d Cir. 2008) (same). Specifically, when evaluating whether the “otherwise extensive” prong
applies, the sentencing court must consider “(i) the number of knowing participants; (ii) the
number of unknowing participants whose activities were organized or led by the defendant with
specific criminal intent; (i11) the extent to which the services of the unknowing participants were
peculiar and necessary to the criminal scheme.” Carrozzella, 105 F.3d at 803-04. In setting out
these factors, the Circuit emphasized that “[t]he number of knowing participants” is “relevant” to
the analysis “because a criminal scheme with four knowing participants that is aided by unknowing
participants is more likely to be ‘otherwise extensive’ than a scheme with a single knowing
participant.” Jd. at 804. Additionally, when evaluating the number of unknowing participants, the
Circuit emphasized distinguishing between service providers, such as taxi drivers, from individuals
who function more like knowing participants who receive direction from a defendant “with the
specific intent” to further the criminal activity.

In this analysis, the Circuit did not articulate or rely on any requirement that a defendant
must have supervised at least one knowing participant. Jd. Rather, the Court expressly
contemplated that the enhancement might apply to an organization involving multiple unknowing
participants. See id. Consistent with that understanding, and contrary to the defense’s proposed
interpretation, the Circuit has affirmed the application of § 3B1.1 under the “otherwise extensive”
prong to two defendants who were themselves the only two knowing participants identified in the
scheme. Rubenstein, 403 F.3d at 99. That outcome makes clear that the Circuit does not require
a defendant to supervise any other knowing participant in the scheme. Of particular note, the
Rubenstein case applied the “otherwise extensive” enhancement” where the two knowing
participants worked together, with one serving as a “right-hand man” to the other, while they
organized “as many as seven participants who were unknowing,” who worked under the
