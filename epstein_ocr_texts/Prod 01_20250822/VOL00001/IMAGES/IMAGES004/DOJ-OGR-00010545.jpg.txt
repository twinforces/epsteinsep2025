Epstein. (PSR § 28). As a result, the defendant and Epstein no longer had to identify and recruit
victims themselves. (/d.). Instead, they used money to convince impoverished girls to bring other
victims to provide Epstein with sexualized massages. (/d.). Once the girls were in Epstein’s home,
the defendant engaged in grooming behavior that normalized the sexualized massages that were
taking place with Epstein. (/d.).

As set forth in the PSR, the defendant targeted vulnerable victims for sexual abuse, causing
significant and lasting harm. The trial evidence focused on six girls who suffered abusive sexual

Melissa. Details concerning the evidence at trial with respect to the abuse by the defendant and
Epstein of the six girls are provided in the PSR at {J 30-74, 80-82. The defendant was instrumental
in the abuse of these girls. She personally engaged in sexual abuse when she fondled the breasts
of Jane, Annie, and Carolyn. And she used her role as a supposedly respectable, glamorous, older
woman to lure these victims into a false sense of security. By behaving as though the sexual abuse
was normal, the defendant prevented these girls from understanding just how wrong the abuse was.
The defendant also provided Epstein with the cover of an age-appropriate romantic partner, to put
other adults at ease when interacting with Epstein and when allowing their children to spend time
with him.

them), and her family was struggling financially. (PSR §§ 30-31). The defendant and Epstein
cultivated a relationship with Jane, spending time with her at Epstein’s Palm Beach home and
