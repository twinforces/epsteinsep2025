Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 703 Filed.07/12/22 Page 4of7

Government’s :case—the: defendant provided a supplemental. disclosure of material:under Rule:

16(b)(1)(A).. Document “Rule 16 007” appcars to be a.sale agreement, for the defendant’s home

at 44 Kinnerton Stréet, London, dated December 19, 1996. [

Although the défense has -not specified, the relevance of this document, ‘it appears to be

‘offered. in:scrvice: of the: argument that the defendant did not. live:at this address in 1994, which. is
when Kate testified she first visited, the defendant. there. To be clear, the document does not.
actually establish that fact: The defendant herself ha’ testificd. under dath that she lived. in the 44
Kinnerton Strect residence beginning:in 1992. or 1993 (see Exhibit'B), and ‘even, assuming'the date
of sale is accurate; it hardly: precludes, the possibility’ that the defendant lived there at:an. carlier
date.”

IW. Discussion

The defendant’s decision to withhold ‘the sale: agreement until. the close of the
Government’s ‘case: violates her Rule: 16 obligations. The records-were within. her possession,
custody,, and. control. long ‘before trial, and the theory for which. the Government expects ‘the:
defendant to ‘use the agreement has been apparent’ since the Government’s. production. of Jencks
Act:material,in. mid-October, before the defendant’s initial Rule 16 deadline. ‘By failing'to disclose
the agreement. ‘until the close of the Government’s case, the defendant; has prevented. the

Government from conducting a full investigation, causing’prejudicc to the Government. The Court

* Nor does it:preclude the possibility that Kate was simply mistaken about which of the defendant’s
London residences she’ first visited.
