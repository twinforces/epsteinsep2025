Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 703 Filed 07/12/22 Page4of7
Government’s case—the defendant provided a supplemental disclosure of material under Rule
16(b)(1)(A). Document “Rule 16 007” appears to be a sale agreement for the defendant’s home
at 44 Kinnerton Street, London, dated December 19, 1996. Lf rr

Although the defense has not specified the relevance of this document, it appears to be
offered in service of the argument that the defendant did not live at this address in 1994, which is
when Kate testified she first visited the defendant there. To be clear, the document does not
actually establish that fact: The defendant herself has testified under oath that she lived in the 44
Kinnerton Street residence beginning in 1992 or 1993 (see Exhibit B), and even assuming the date
of sale is accurate, it hardly precludes the possibility that the defendant lived there at an earlier
date.

Ill. Discussion

The defendant’s decision to withhold the sale agreement until the close of the
Government’s case violates her Rule 16 obligations. The records were within her possession,
custody, and control long before trial, and the theory for which the Government expects the
defendant to use the agreement has been apparent since the Government’s production of Jencks
Act material in mid-October, before the defendant’s initial Rule 16 deadline. By failing to disclose
the agreement until the close of the Government’s case, the defendant has prevented the
Government from conducting a full investigation, causing prejudice to the Government. The Court
2 Nor does it preclude the possibility that Kate was simply mistaken about which of the defendant’s
London residences she first visited.
