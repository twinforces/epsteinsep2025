Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670 - Filed 06/22/22 Page 42 of 55
explained: “This toxic combination of being sexually exposed and exploited, feeling confused and
naive, blaming myself all resulted in significant shame.”

Kate has explained that “the consequences of what Ghislaine Maxwell did have been far
reaching for me.” In a letter to the Court in connection with sentencing, Kate shared: “I have
struggled with, and eventually triumphed over, substance use disorder. I have suffered panic
attacks and night terrors, with which I still struggle. I have suffered low self esteem, loss of career
opportunities. I have battled greatly with feeling unable to trust my own instincts, in choosing
romantic relationships.”

Carolyn’s testimony at trial made clear that she, too, has suffered greatly as a result of the
defendant’s crimes. Over her years of abuse at Epstein’s hands, Carolyn fell deeper into drug
addiction, and she has experienced significant struggles with mental health and addiction
throughout her adult life. (PSR §] 59). When explaining the trauma she experienced, Carolyn
expressed, “my soul is broken and so is my heart.” (Tr. 1678). Her pain was palpable on the
witness stand as she described the horrifying years of abuse she suffered.

As the foregoing makes clear, the defendant played an essential role in a child exploitation
conspiracy that caused lasting harm to many young girls. The defendant preyed on vulnerable
young girls, manipulated them, and served them up to be sexually abused by Epstein, a prolific
predator and abuser of children. Years of sexual abuse, multiple victims, devastating
psychological harm: none of this could have happened without Maxwell. A Guidelines sentence
is necessary to reflect the gravity of the offense conduct and the pain and trauma the defendant
inflicted upon her many victims.
