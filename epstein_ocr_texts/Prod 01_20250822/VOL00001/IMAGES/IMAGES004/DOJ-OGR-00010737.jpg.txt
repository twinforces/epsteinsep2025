MOTION OF KATE TO BE ALLOWED TO DELIVER A VICTIM IMPACT
STATEMENT AT SENTENCING
Jane Doe, who testified at the trial in this matter under the pseudonym Kate, through
undersigned counsel, files this motion for the Court to be allowed to deliver a victim impact
statement, orally and in court, at the sentencing of Ghislaine Maxwell on June 28. In support of
this motion, the undersigned states as follows:
INTRODUCTION
At trial of Ghislaine Maxell, Kate testified about her experience with Ghislaine Maxwell.
The jury found that Maxwell had committed crimes charged in the indictment beyond a reasonable
doubt. Now, at sentencing, the Court has greater freedom to consider the full scope of the harms
that Maxwell’s crimes have caused. See 18 U.S.C. § 3661 (“no limitation shall be placed on the
information concerning the background, character, and conduct of a person convicted of an offense
which a court of the United States may receive and consider for the purpose of imposing an
appropriate sentence.”). Kate seeks to assist the Court in that effort by providing an oral victim
impact statement at sentencing.
