During her cross-examination of Jane, Ms. Menninger did not ask Jane if she was told
that cooperating with the government would “help her case.” Rather, the testimony on this issue
is as follows:

Q. At any point during your cooperation with the government, including testifying, you

knew that your cooperation with the government, including testifying, would benefit you

in your civil litigation against the Epstein estate and Ms. Maxwell; correct?

A. No, I don't know that.

Q. You knew that cooperation with the government, including testifying, would benefit

you in your claim for the victims' compensation fund; correct?

A. No, I don't know that. (U.S. v. Maxwell Trial Testimony, 12/1/21 at 581:2-11).

Even if Mr. Glassman said to Jane at some time during her civil case before she decided
to settle it (i.e. January-December 2020) that he thought cooperating with the government would
“help” that civil case, that doesn't mean that Jane "knew" that to be a fact. The veracity and/or
significance of a statement Ms. Moe believes Mr. Glassman made to her about an alleged
statement he made to his client is simply irrelevant.

Jane respectfully requests that Ms. Maxwell’s motion be denied outright.

But if the Court is inclined to entertain the motion further, Jane requests that Ms.
Maxwell provide the precise question or questions that Ms. Maxwell’s counsel intends to ask Mr.
Glassman. And that Mr. Glassman be permitted time to obtain an advisory opinion from ethics
counsel and perhaps from the California State Bar as to whether he would be permitted to answer
such a question or questions.
