During her cross-examination of Jane, Ms. Menninger did not ask Jane if she was told
that cooperating with the government. would “help her.case.” Rather, the testimony on this issue
is as. follows:

Q..At-any point-during your cooperation with the government, including testifying, you

knew that your cooperation with the government, including testifying, would benefit you

in 'your-civil litigation against the, Epstein estate, and Ms. Maxwell; éorréct?

A. No, I, don't know that.

Q. You knew that cooperation with. the government, including testifying, would benefit

A.'No, 1 don't know that, (U.S.'v. Maxwell, Trial Testimony, 12/1/21 at 581:2-11).

Even if Mr. Glassman said to Jane at some time: during her civil, case before she decided
‘to settle it-(7.é. January-December'2020) that.he thought; cooperating: with the government. would
“help” that civil.casc, that doesn't:mcean-that Jane "knew" that to bea fact. The veracity: and/or
significance of a statement. Ms. Moe'belicves Mr. Glassman made 'to her about an alleged
Statement, he made to his client is. simply irrelevant.

Jane: respectfully requests. that Ms. Maxwell’s motion.be denicd outright.

But:if the Court is inclined ‘to entertain the motion further, Jane requests that/Ms.
Glassman. And that Mr. Glassman. be permitted time to obtain an, advisory opinion ‘from ethics
counscl and:perhaps from the'!California State Bar as to, whether he would. be permitted to answer.

such :a.question or questions.
