16 Q. Mr. Visoski, could you please describe the interior of

17 Mr. Epstein's Palm Beach residence.

18 A. Yes. If we start at the front door, you walk into the

19 front door, there is an entrance courtyard area. Once you're
20 inside the house, there is just obviously a large waiting area.
21 I guess it's easy, the first day, if you just walk to
22 your left, there is a half of staircase or half a circle
23 staircase that leads you to the upstairs bedrooms.
24 Once you get upstairs, you walk straight down the
25 hallway, there is a master bedroom located at the end of that
