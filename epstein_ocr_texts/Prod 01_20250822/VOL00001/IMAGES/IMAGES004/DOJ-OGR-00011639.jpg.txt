MS. MOE: That's, correct, ‘your Honor. We made it

available for imspection this summer, We notified the defense

in, a létter that! it was available for inspection. The defense

asked for an inspectien the week before our conference ‘on.

November ist’. I made it available for inspection ‘that day.
They personally inspected it. We're happy to continue to make
that! available for inspection "to the défense.

THE COURT: I'm very +Ahappy to hear that. Thank you.
I appreciate that. And I think that takes Care of that f6r

now’.

I guess 6ne question: T think; given thé uncertainty

as to admission, the government should not mention, it in its
opening.

MS. MOE: Of course, your Honor. Thank you.

THE GOURT: Anything before we méve 6n?

MR. PAGLIUCA: No, your Honor. Thank, you,

THE GOURT: So next is the admissibility of

co-conspirator statements. I, do appreciate the efforts to. come

t6 reasonable agreement, Sf course, with the defense preserving

objections as to ultimate admissibility. Based, on, the law, of

céurseé thé government. has. to tiake the showing that's required
during the counse of the trial.

There are two statements that are exemplars that
remain, in issue, and I think, starting with the second one
finst: so the second one, it seems to mey is not being offered
