1 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. We made it

2 available for inspection this summer. We notified the defense
3 in a letter that it was available for inspection. The defense
4 asked for an inspection the week before our conference on

5 November lst. I made it available for inspection that day.

6 They personally inspected it. We're happy to continue to make
7 that available for inspection to the defense.

8 THE COURT: I'm very happy to hear that. Thank you.

9 I appreciate that. And I think that takes care of that for

10 now.

11 I guess one question: I think, given the uncertainty
12 as to admission, the government should not mention it in its

13 opening.

14 MS. MOE: Of course, your Honor. Thank you.

15 THE COURT: Anything before we move on?

16 MR. PAGLIUCA: No, your Honor. Thank you.

17 THE COURT: So next is the admissibility of

18 co-conspirator statements. I do appreciate the efforts to come
19 to reasonable agreement, of course, with the defense preserving
20 objections as to ultimate admissibility. Based on the law, of
21 course the government has to make the showing that's required
22 during the course of the trial.
23 There are two statements that are exemplars that
24 remain in issue, and I think, starting with the second one
25 first: so the second one, it seems to me, is not being offered
