1 A. Well, number one, I was, like, did I just mess something up
2 entirely? And I was embarrassed and sort of like shocked and

3 didn't know that that was the full question.

4 Q. I think at one point you said that you sort of didn't

5) realize the extent to which your interviewing would kind of

6 reverberate. I don't mean this process.

7 But in terms of the public knowing that you had a

8 history of sexual abuse, with any of the reporters you spoke

9 to, did you talk through the consequences?

10 A. No, your Honor.

11 Q. And, again, I don't mean about this kind of process. But I
12 just mean to speak about your history of sexual abuse.

13 A. Correct. No, your Honor.

14 THE COURT: I'll briefly meet with counsel.

15 (At the sidebar)

16 THE COURT: I want to make sure that I've accurately
17 captured the follow-up questions that were requested and give
18 you a final opportunity if you have any additional questions

19 for followup.
20 MS. POMERANTZ: Nothing further, your Honor. Thank
21 you.
22 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I had asked before if the Court
23 could inquire about the summary of the case. He said he paid
24 attention early on. He specifically said that the case was
25 about sexual abuse.
