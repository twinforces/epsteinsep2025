exception applies, all ‘relevant evidence is admissible.’” White, 692 F.3d at 246.

The testimony of Eva, Michelle, and Kelly, is relevant, because it makes it less likely that
Jane engaged with sexualized massages with Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. During her
testimony, Jane claimed that Eva, Michelle, and Kelly were all involved in or could confirm the
