9 THE COURT: Good afternoon, Juror No. 50. I am Judge
10 Nathan. It's nice to see you in person, and thank you for your
11 time.

12 I am going to ask you some follow-up questions related
13 to some of your responses that you provided and some additional
14 questions.
15 First, as I instructed you earlier, the defendant in
16 this case, Ms. Maxwell, is presumed innocent of all charges
17 unless and until the government proves her guilt beyond a
18 reasonable doubt. Are you able to follow that instruction?
19 JUROR: Yes.
20 THE COURT: As I instructed you, until you are excused
21 from the case, you may not take in any kind of media about the
22 case, social media, TV, radio, online, print, anything, or
23 discuss the case with anyone. Would you have any difficulty
24 following that instruction?
25 JUROR: No.
