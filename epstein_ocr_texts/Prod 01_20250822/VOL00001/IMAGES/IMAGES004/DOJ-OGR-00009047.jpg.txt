based upon the juror’s voir dire answers.” Id. (citing United States v. Haynes, 398 F.2d
980, 984 (2d Cir. 1968) (actual bias is “based upon express proof, e.g., by a voir dire

Court in falsely answering Questions 25 and 48, Ms. Maxwell has easily met that burden.

There are at least six reasons to believe Juror No. 50 acted intentionally. First, this
Court need only watch the video of Juror No. 50 being confronted with his false answers
to appreciate that he acted intentionally. Juror No. 50’s face immediately flushed and
