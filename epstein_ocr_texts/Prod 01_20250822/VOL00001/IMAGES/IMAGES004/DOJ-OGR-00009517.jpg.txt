tax shelters and did not function as a CPA. He gave no investment advice, and the trades were
executed by his assistant. In short, his role as a broker in the three “backdating” transactions is
too thin a reed to support this enhancement.

If all of this is correct, then Mr. Parse should be at offense level 24, with a
Guidelines range of 51 to 63 months. Of course, we believe that even that calculation produces a
range that is still far too harsh. See, e.g., Smirlock v. United States, 2005 U.S. Dist. Lexis 7321
at *6 (noting that “the amount of loss that actually winds up resulting from a person’s conduct
...can be arbitrary” and may not reflect culpability); Bowman, The Failure of the Federal
Sentencing Guidelines: A Structural Analysis, 105 Colum L. Rev. 1315, 1328 (2005)(“[aJt or
near the root of virtually every serious criticism of the guidelines is the concern that they are too
harsh”).
F. Conclusion

In her sentencing submission, Donna Guerin catalogued the sentences that have
been imposed on those who designed and marketed illegal tax shelters. See Guerin’s Am.
Sentencing Mem. 13-16, ECF No. 592. They have varied greatly in length. What makes this
case different is that David Parse did not design or market tax shelters; he was a broker executing
trades. Indeed, to our knowledge, of all of the brokers who performed that function for Jenkins
and other law firms, he and Craig Brubaker were the only two people who were prosecuted, and
he is the only one who stands convicted.
