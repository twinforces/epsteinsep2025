ee” Both Maria Farmer and Ms. Ransome have
elected to breach their personal privacy by placing themselves before the media. In addition, Ms.
Ransome timed the release of her memoir, “Silenced No More,” (December 7, 2021) and book
tour to coincide with her attendance at the trial .
The Sentencing Proceeding Should Not Be a Bully Pulpit for Anyone Who Claims Abuse
The prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein was an opportunity for alleged victims who were
disenfranchised in connection with Epstein’s Florida sweetheart deal to have their voices heard.
Epstein’s untimely death following his arrest dealt a further blow to his accusers. Following
Epstein’s sudden and untimely death almost three years ago, Judge Berman provided an
opportunity for any victim to make a statement regardless of whether they qualified under the
CVRA. Kate, Virginia Giuffre, and Sarah Ransome each spoke at that hearing, Annie Farmer
spoke solely on behalf of her sister, Maria Farmer. See United States v. Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (Dkt.
53). But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the unique hearing
conducted by Judge Berman. The victim statements presented to Judge Berman had no impact on
the rights of Epstein, a deceased defendant whose case was required by law to be abated. Such is
not the case here. While it is appropriate for the public to be present and for legitimate CVRA
> Noticeably missing from Ms. Ransome’s statement is conduct that very well may have contributed to
her allegations: She was high-priced “escort’ for Emperor’s Club, the agency patronized by Elliot Spitzer.
Litigation cited in her impact statement revealed that in or about October 2006, Ms. Ransome work for an
agency, got paid thousands of dollars per “escort” and engaged in sexual activity. A modeling photo of
Ms. Ransome produced in her discovery appeared on the Emperor’s Club advertisement. The government
prosecuted the Emperor’s Club owners. See United States v. Brener, 08 Cr. 533 (DLC), Dkt. 1 (criminal
complaint, 08 MJ 463).
