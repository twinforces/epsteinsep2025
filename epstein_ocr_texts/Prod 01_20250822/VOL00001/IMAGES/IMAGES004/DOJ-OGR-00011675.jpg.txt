1 MS. MOE: Okay. We're happy to give that a shot, your
2 Honor. We just did want to raise that concern about being able
3 to follow along. We also wanted to ask -â€”-

4 THE COURT: And I fully agree with you.

a And that's why I said we'll give it a shot. They have
6 to be extremely mindful that anything that they're doing or

7 showing the witness has to be fully described on the record and
8 so the government can follow. And if that doesn't work for

9 some reason or I think it's not particularly aiding the review
10 of the evidence, then we'll just do it the old-fashioned way

11 with paper.

12 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

13 And finally, we just wanted to know where -- where the
14 screen would be located that those items would be projected to
15 the witness from. So, for example, our paralegal is sitting in
16 the gallery and has a screen there; so we're being careful

17 about what's on her screen to avoid the public seeing that. We
18 just wanted to know where the screen would be in the courtroom
19 that that's being projected from so we can be mindful of that
20 concern.
21 THE COURT: Good question.
22 MS. STERNHEIM: May I have a moment?
23 Ms. Lundberg will be sitting over there where
24 Ms. Menninger is. The screen will not be viewable to the
25 public.
