Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

By letter dated February 16, 2022, the defendant proposed redactions to the parties’
briefing regarding Juror 50. (Dkt. No. 602). The Government respectfully submits this letter in
response to the defendant’s proposed redactions, which are overbroad and inconsistent with both
the public’s right of access to judicial documents and the Court’s February 11, 2021 Order, which
permitted redactions of three narrow categories: (1) the questions the parties propose be asked at
any hearing, (2) specific factual information developed by the parties which is not public, and (3)
redactions to protect juror anonymity and privacy. (Dkt. No. 596 at 4).

The categories of redactions proposed by the defendant are impermissibly broad. In
particular:

e The defendant seeks to redact discussion of the substance of Juror 50’s questionnaire. For
the reasons set forth in the Government’s February 4, 2021 and February 11, 2021 letters

(Dkt. Nos. 594, 598), the Government respectfully submits that Juror 50’s questionnaire

should be made public, along with all other questionnaires of the twelve seated jurors in

this case. Indeed, the defendant has not opposed the New York Times Company’s motion
