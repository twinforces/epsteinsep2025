warrants; user information associated with certain of those devices; and documents

and photographs extracted from certain of those devices. The Government further

anticipates that Examiner Flatley will also testify that some of the devices on which
he performed extractions were clones of device extractions that had previously been
performed by someone else.

Gov. Sept. 15, 2021 Letter.

On November 26, after the pretrial conference, the government sent a new letter to
defense counsel. Despite the substance Examiner Flatley’s expected testimony, the November 26
letter continued the refrain that Examiner Flatley was not going to offer expert opinions. Said the
government:

The Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify regarding the
forensic examination of the devices marked for identification as Government
Exhibits 54 and 55, and his determination that those exhibits are clones. He is
expected to testify that a clone is an exact copy of one piece of media to another.
Examiner Flatley is expected to explain that he connected Government Exhibits 54
and 55 to a write blocker and subsequently imaged, or made an exact copy, of the
exhibits. The Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will explain that the
images of Government Exhibits 54 and 55 are exact copies of the original devices
because he ran a hash, or mathematical algorithm that uniquely identifies data, on
the original devices and the images, which are identical.

The Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that
Government Exhibits 405 and 419 reflect registry software information for
Government Exhibits 55 and 54, respectively. Examiner Flatley will explain that
such registry software information includes several fields, including registered
organization and registered owner, which are user input data. He is expected to
explain that Government Exhibits 405 and 419 were generated by Access Data AD
Lab.

The Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that
he examined certain exhibits contained on the devices marked for identification as
Government Exhibits 54 and 55. In particular, he is expected to testify that
Government Exhibits 412, 415, and 424 are emails on Government Exhibit 54;
Government Exhibits 418, 420, 421, and 422 are Word documents on Government
Exhibit 54; and Government Exhibits 418B, 420B, 421B, and 422B contain the
properties, or metadata, for the corresponding exhibits. Examiner Flatley is
expected to testify that Government Exhibits 418, 420, 421, and 422 were created
under a user profile named “gmax.” He is also expected to testify that Government
Exhibit 417 is a Word document stored on Government Exhibit 55. Examiner
