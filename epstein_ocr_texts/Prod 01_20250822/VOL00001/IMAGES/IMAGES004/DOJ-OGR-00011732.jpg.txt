Now, like many of the other accusers, but even more
startling here, Carolyn"s. story changed. dramatically.

Back in around 2007, shé was, interviewed by the FBI
about Epstein. She did not have a lawyer at that time, but she
answered their questions. And later, she Hired an, attorney and
sued Epstein and his assistant, Sarah Kellen. She did not sue
Ghislaine.

She then brought another lawsuit in federal court -in
Florida. Again, she sued Epstein and kKéllen. Shé did not sus
Ghislaine. Ghislaine’ had not come up during that interview in

2007. Ghislaine was not identified as anyone who recruited

Carolyn or groomed Carolyn, or otherwise interacted with Carolyn
in Palm Beach. As I Said, tw6 suits by Carolyn, noné involvéd
Ghislaine. You will see the Length of the complaint against
Epstein and Kellen. It dé6esn't inélude Ghislaine.

Now, the evidence will also show that Carolyn, actually
groomed and trafficked other people té Epstein. And aftér

Epstein died and there was money to be had, her lawyer

contacted the government, and now her story inéluded Ghislaine:

fund, and she got. three and a half million dollars, 165s the 40
or $50,000 that she had, received in one of her lawsuits against
Epstein and Kellen.

Now, early on, the judge told ‘you that the burden is

on. the government to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.
