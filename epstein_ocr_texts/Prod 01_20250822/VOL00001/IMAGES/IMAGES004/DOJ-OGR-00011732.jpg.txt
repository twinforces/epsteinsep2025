LBTVMAX3 Opening â€”- Ms. Sternheim

1 Now, like many of the other accusers, but even more

2 startling here, Carolyn's story changed dramatically.

3 Back in around 2007, she was interviewed by the FBI

4 about Epstein. She did not have a lawyer at that time, but she
5 answered their questions. And later, she hired an attorney and
6 sued Epstein and his assistant, Sarah Kellen. She did not sue
7 Ghislaine.

8 She then brought another lawsuit in federal court in

9 Florida. Again, she sued Epstein and Kellen. She did not sue
10 Ghislaine. Ghislaine had not come up during that interview in
11 2007. Ghislaine was not identified as anyone who recruited

12 Carolyn or groomed Carolyn or otherwise interacted with Carolyn
13 in Palm Beach. As I said, two suits by Carolyn, none involved
14 Ghislaine. You will see the length of the complaint against

15 Epstein and Kellen. It doesn't include Ghislaine.

16 Now, the evidence will also show that Carolyn actually
17 groomed and trafficked other people to Epstein. And after

18 Epstein died and there was money to be had, her lawyer

19 contacted the government, and now her story included Ghislaine.
20 And assisting the government enhanced her application to the
21 fund, and she got three and a half million dollars, less the 40
22 or $50,000 that she had received in one of her lawsuits against
23 Epstein and Kellen.
24 Now, early on, the judge told you that the burden is
25 on the government to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt.
