DECLARATION OF STEPHEN GILLERS

Qualifications
1. My name is Stephen Gillers. | am a law professor at New York University School of ,
Law, where I have taught the rules and law governing lawyers and judges (“legal ethics’’)
: regularly since 1978. ] am author of a leading casebook in the field, Regulation of Lawyers:
. Problems of Law and Ethics (9" ed. 2012). I have spoken hundreds of times on the subject of
legal ethics at state and local bar associations nationwide and at American Bar Association
meetings, at state and federal judicial conferences, and at law firms and corporate law offices in
the United States and abroad. For more than a decade, I have been and remain active in the legal ;
ethics work of the ABA’s Center for Professional Responsibility, spending hundreds of hours
yearly on this work. Most recently, I have been a member of the ABA’s Ethics 20/20
Commission, a three and a half year project to review the rules of ethics governing lawyers in
light of globalization and advance in technology. I have written widely in the area, including for
law journals and the law and popular press. Legal ethics is-the primary focus of my academic
research. My resume is annexed as Exhibit A.
Question Addressed And Summary Of Conclusion
2. I have been asked to address the question the Court posed on February 16, 2012 —
namely, “whether the attorneys for Brune & Richard involved in this matter would have satisfied
their ethical obligations if they failed to disclose the contents of the July 21 letter and their
complete investigation into Juror No. 1.” The question does not specify a time frame for any’
possible “failfure] to disclose.” I have been asked, therefore, to address any disclosure duty in
March, May, and July of 2011. I have not been asked to address, and I am not addressing, the
