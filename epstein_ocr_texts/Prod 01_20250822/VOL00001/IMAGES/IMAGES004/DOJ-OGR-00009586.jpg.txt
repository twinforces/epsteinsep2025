is all, that is required. United States v. Salmonese, 352. F.3d.608, 622 (2d Cir. 2003). And in any’
event, Jane 'recalled'the iricident.of abuse at’ least’ as carly.as November 3, 202.1. (See:Def. Mot. at.
5:n.1 (citing 3509-033 at 1)). Notes from that.interview were:provided to the defense on.November
6, 2021—more'than three wecks before trial. At the time, the’partics were still, litigating whether:
Kate could testify at.all. (See, é.g., Dkt. No. 417 (order dated November 6, 20211, requiring the
Government to. brief whether Kate was a “victim” for any’ legal, purpose, including restitution).
The Court did not: permit Kate: to testify. until, November 19,:2021—almost:. two wecks after the

her failure to ask for a limiting instruction at the time of Jane’s testimony. as an argument:that: she
was prejudiced. To the contrary, the Court.did not err—much less plainly so. See Wnited States
v: Petit, 19 Cr, 850 (JSR),2021 WL 673461, at *9 (S:D.N:Y. Feb. 21, 2021) (applying the plain
crror standard, to, a constructive amendment claim in a-Rule 33 motion that was not, madé at trial).

Finally, even.if the defendant had. been ‘entitled. to.a limiting instruction but:was deprived.
of the: opportunity’ to request it, ‘she still, was not ‘prejudiced. As the Court agreed. at the charge
