I. General Overview

1. What is the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program?
The Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (the “Epstein VCP” or
“Program’) is a voluntary, independent Program that has been established to
compensate and resolve the claims of victims-survivors of sexual abuse by
Jeffrey Epstein. The Program was designed by nationally recognized claims
administration experts Kenneth R. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana H
Feldman, with input from victims’ lawyers, and representatives of the Estate
of Jeffrey Epstein (“Estate”), and other interested parties. Ms. Feldman also
serves as the Administrator of the Program (“Administrator”). The goal of
this Program is to acknowledge the wrongs endured by victims-survivors and
offer them an opportunity to voluntarily resolve their individual claims for
such sexual abuse.
The Program is independent of the Estate. The Administrator is responsible
for all decisions relating to the review, processing and evaluation of individual
claims submitted to the Program. The Administrator has complete autonomy
to determine eligibility of individual claims and the amount of compensation
for each eligible Claimant. The Estate has no authority to modify or reject
any individual claim determinations rendered by the Administrator, or
otherwise interfere with the administration of the Program.
The terms and conditions of the Program, including the criteria and proof
requirements for the evaluation and determination of claims and the
accompanying claims process, are set forth in the Program Protocol
(“Protocol), which can be found on the Program website.

2. Is the Program voluntary?
Yes. The Program is a non-adversarial alternative to litigation, and
participation in the Program is entirely voluntary. It does not affect any rights
you may have unless and until you accept the offered compensation and
execute a Release. A Claimant may reject the offer of compensation and
withdraw the claim at any time prior to execution of the Release.

3. What role does the Estate play in the administration of the Program?
The Program is independent of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein. The Estate has
no role in the evaluation of claims or the administration of the claims process.
The Administrator has full, final and exclusive decision-making authority to
determine who is eligible and the amount of compensation for each eligible
