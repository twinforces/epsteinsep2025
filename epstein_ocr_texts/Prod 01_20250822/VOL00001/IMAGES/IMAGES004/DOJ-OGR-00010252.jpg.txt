10 press about that? Did you talk to the press, the press

11 reporter about the consequences?

12 It's difficult for me to see what it's going at, but I
13 will seek clarification on his answers, as I did multiple

15 coming out publicly as a victim of sexual abuse. He has

16 explained some of the transformation process and the like. You

18 and see if there's something to ask regarding talking to the

19 reporter about the consequences. Which also there's a temporal

24 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. And I think yet a third
25 point, talking about consequences today, I think Juror 50
