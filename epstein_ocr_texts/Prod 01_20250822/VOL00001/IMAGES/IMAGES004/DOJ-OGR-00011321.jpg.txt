forty-five occasions has admitted an exhibit or series of exhibits either partially or fully under
seal to protect the identity or privacy of a victim, third party, or witness. These exhibits include
message pads, address books, birth certificates, business records, invoices, and the like.

Although Ms. Maxwell opposed this process as an infringement on her constitutional
right to effectively cross-examine her accusers, U.S. Const. amend. VI, the Court overruled that
objection. TR 11/1/2021, pp 6-12. Consistent with the rationale for the Court’s decision, and
without waiving her objection, Ms. Maxwell requests that this Court permit three witnesses
called by the defense to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only. Like the government
witnesses this Court permitted to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only, these three
defense witnesses J. Michelle Healy, and gg) have substantial
professional or personal privacy interests supporting this request.

The government and the Court, of course, know the true identities of the witnesses, as
will the jury. Moreover, unlike Ms. Maxwell, the government does not have a constitutional right
to confrontation weighing on the other side of the scale. Finally, the rationale for this Court’s
decision permitting government witnesses to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only
supports the same request by these three witnesses. Just as alleged victims will be reluctant to
come forward and assist the government in the prosecution of a sensitive criminal matter, so too
will witnesses be reluctant to come forward and testify at the request of the defense when the
defendant, like Ms. Maxwell here, has been so publicly vilified before she has even had her day
in court. In a high-profile case like this, Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights to present a defense,
compulsory process, and to effective assistance of counsel would be compromised if witnesses
