In 1998, David was introduced to Paul Daugerdas; his relationship with
Daugerdas and the Jenkens & Gilchrist firm is discussed in Part D below.
G Family, Community and Friends
David met Theresa Austerberry in 1987, when they were at business school
together, and they have been married for 20 years. They have supported each other’s careers --
when Theresa found a better position at McKinsey’s Chicago office, David left Kidder Peabody
to move with her -- and have devoted themselves to family and community. They have three
boys -- ages 17, 15, and 12 -- whom they have raised conscientiously. The letter of David's
brother-in-law, James Yetter, describes it best:
[David's] three sons (my nephews) are wonderful young men with
exceptional character traits that I know are a direct result of Dave’s
strong parenting .... [H]e treats them with a very good
combination of love, caring and high expectations. They all have
chores to do and household responsibilities. They are expected to
have jobs in the summer. They have a healthy regard and respect
for others. Study time is sacred. Responsibilities are not to be
taken lightly. It’s not “enforced,” it’s an expectation.
Letter of James W. Yetter.
Other letters confirm Mr. Yetter’s observations. See letter of Andrew Miller
(“[h]is emphasis and influence on his children have also resulted in good, respectful, well-
rounded and academic kids”); letter of Phil Allen (David “teaches by example, and extolls the
values of hard work and mutual respect; everyone pitches in, whether it is preparing a family
