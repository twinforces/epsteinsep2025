provided t6 ws by ‘the government, ‘the government intends to
introduce, through the medical examiner, photographs of these
bedsores. So, I think, that expert testimony, by itself,

suffering at! the time of his déath.

MR, HOBSON: To be clear of what photographs we are
introducing, wé are not introducing the most graphic pictures.
of the bedsores. In fact, we were concerned in introducing

some of thé pictures that ‘they wouldn't fully show how serious

the bedsores were but we are not going to be putting in the
mést graphic pictures:

THE COURT: What I am going to allow is you will have
some permission té lead with respect to the déeseriptidn of the
injuries and sores. It's going to be brief and, extraction, of
facts that you nééed that is nét cumulative with médical
testimony and evidence that's coming in. We will see how Lt.
goes but I ami == I intend to be extremely cautious given that.
this 2S non-expert medical testimony coming from a relative.
S6, the prospéct 6f prejudice ahd emotion ahd sympathy is real
and I'm not going to let it happen,.

MR. HOBSON: Yes, your H6énor; We understand.

THE COURT: Anything else?

MR. DeMARCO: No thank you; your Honor.

THE COURT: OK. Any word, Ms. Williams?
