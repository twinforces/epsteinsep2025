1 provided to us by the government, the government intends to

2 introduce, through the medical examiner, photographs of these
3 bedsores. So, I think that expert testimony, by itself,

4 sufficiently will describe the bedsores that Mr. Jones was

5 suffering at the time of his death.

6 MR. HOBSON: To be clear of what photographs we are

7 introducing, we are not introducing the most graphic pictures
8 of the bedsores. In fact, we were concerned in introducing

9 some of the pictures that they wouldn't fully show how serious
10 the bedsores were but we are not going to be putting in the

11 most graphic pictures.

12 THE COURT: What I am going to allow is you will have
13 some permission to lead with respect to the description of the
14 injuries and sores. It's going to be brief and extraction of
15 facts that you need that is not cumulative with medical

16 testimony and evidence that's coming in. We will see how it
17 goes but I am -- I intend to be extremely cautious given that
18 this is non-expert medical testimony coming from a relative.
19 So, the prospect of prejudice and emotion and sympathy is real
20 and I'm not going to let it happen.
21 MR. HOBSON: Yes, your Honor. We understand.
22 THE COURT: Anything else?
23 MR. DeMARCO: No thank you, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: OK. Any word, Ms. Williams?
