about how memory can be corrupted and rendered him incapable of objectively evaluating a
central aspect of Ms. Maxwell’s defense. (Motion at 32-33).

The Court should not credit Juror 50’s repeated assurances that he would not, and did not,
let his past experience of sexual abuse affect his ability to fairly and impartially evaluate the
evidence. Those answers were self-serving and are of no value to the Court’s analysis of
potential bias. Indeed, the Second Circuit had recognized that in determining whether implied or
inferred bias exists, “the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be impartial become
irrelevant.” Torres, 128 F.3d at 47. Instead, bias must be determined from the surrounding facts
and circumstances—especially in cases where the juror’s experience closely tracks the trial
evidence—because “the bias of a juror will rarely be admitted by the juror himself, ‘partly
because the juror may have an interest in concealing his own bias and partly because the juror
may be unaware of it.’” /d. (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 558). Here, the record establishes
that Juror 50 was biased and would have been struck for cause had he truthfully disclosed his
history of sexual abuse.

sexual abuse—lacked all credibility. And his assertion that he did not think anyone would find
out about his sexual abuse after giving three interviews to the international press, including a
video interview, about his service as a juror on the most widely covered case in decades was
utterly implausible. Juror 50’s false statements and his explanation for those false statements, a
