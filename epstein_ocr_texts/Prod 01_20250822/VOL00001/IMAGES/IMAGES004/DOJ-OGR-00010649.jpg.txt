Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

I am counsel for Teresa Helm, and I am providing the following victim impact statement
for the Court’s consideration with respect to Maxwell’s sentencing.

Pursuant to the Crimes Victims’ Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771, Ms. Teresa Helm
qualifies as a victim as the Defendant participated in her trafficking in 2002. Ms. Helm thus
requests the Court’s permission to make an oral statement at the sentencing.
