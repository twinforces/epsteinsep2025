I. JUROR 50’s PRESS STATEMENTS REVEAL THAT HE WAS BIASED AND

SHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK FOR CAUSE

Where a juror’s inaccurate answer during voir dire is revealed, the starting point for
analyzing whether a new trial is required is the Supreme Court’s decision in McDonough. The
Court’s plurality opinion states: “[w]e hold that to obtain a new trial in such a situation, a party
must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire, and
then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for
cause.” 464 U.S. at 556. However, the plurality’s focus on whether the juror was “honest” does
not mean that an inaccurate answer, though not given deliberately, cannot suffice to undermine the
integrity of the verdict. Five Justices of the Court, in two concurring opinions, agreed that a court
may vacate a conviction based upon a juror’s erroneous answer if, under all the circumstances, the
juror is shown to have been biased. See id. at 556 (explaining that a court can order a new trial
“regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest”) (Blackmun, J., concurring with
Stevens and O’Connor, JJ.); id. at 557-59 (incorrect answer may be sufficient) (Brennan, J.,
concurring with Marshall, J.).°

The Second Circuit has framed the test: “a party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed
juror bias must demonstrate first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the
correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v.
Stewart, 433 F.3d 273, 303 (2d Cir. 2006). “False” in this context means inaccurate or materially
misleading, not necessarily deliberately untruthful; any other rule would unacceptably dilute the
® The rule that error need not be deliberate is followed in other contexts in criminal law. Cf.
Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 288 (1999) (“[U]nder Brady an inadvertent nondisclosure has
the same impact on the fairness of the proceedings as deliberate concealment. ‘If the suppression
of evidence results in constitutional error, it is because of the character of the evidence, not the
character of the prosecutor.’”) (internal citation omitted).
