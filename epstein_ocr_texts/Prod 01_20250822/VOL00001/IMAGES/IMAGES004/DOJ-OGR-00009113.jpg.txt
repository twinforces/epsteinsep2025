SHOULD HAVE BEEN STRUCK FOR:CAUSE

Where a. juror’s :inaccurate answer. during voir dire is revealed, the starting point. for
analyzing whether a new trial, is required, is the Supreme Court’s decision in. McDonough. The
Court’s. plurality opinion states: “[W]c hold. that to obtain.a new ‘trial.in Such.a situation, a party’
then. further show ‘that;a correct response would have, provided.a valid basis for a challenge for
cause.” 464 U.S. at'S56. However, the. plurality’sifocus on’whether the jutor'was “honest”does
not:mean that.an-inaccurate answer, though not given deliberately, cannot suffice toundermine the
integrity of the-verdict. Five Justices of the Court, ‘in two concurring opinions, agreed that a court
may vacate a conviction. based.upon.a.juror’s crroncous answer if,;under all the circumstances, the
juror is shown to have been biased. See id. at. 556 (explaining that,a court can, order a‘new trial
“regardless of whether a juror’s answer is honest or dishonest”) (Blackmun, J., Concurring with
Stevens and O’Connor, JJ.); id. at 557-59 (incorrect.answer may be :sufficient) (Brennan, J.,
coneurring with’Marshall, J.).°

The Sccond Circuit.has framed'the test: “a party alleging unfairness based.on undisclosed
juror bias must-demonstrate ‘first, that the juror’s voir-dire response was false and second, that the
correet. response would. have provided a ‘valid basis ‘for'a challenge forcause.” United States v.
Stewart,.433 F.3d 273, 303 (2d.Cir.2006). “False” in this context means inaccurate or materially’

mislcading, not. necessarily deliberately untruthful; anyother rule: would unacceptably dilute the

6 The rule that. crror necd not: be: deliberate is followed. in other contexts in criminal law. Cf
Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, '288 (1,999) (“[U]nder Brady: an inadvertent.nondisclosure has
the'same impact.on the fairness of the proceedings as deliberatc:conecalment. ‘If the’suppression
of evidence results in constitutional crror, it is because of the character of the evidence, not the
character of the:prosccutor.”’) (internal citation.omitted).
