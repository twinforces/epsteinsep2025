Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 692 Filed 11/22/21 Page2of17
(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier
of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;
(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;
(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and
(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the case.

The Court exercises a “gatekeeper function” in assessing the admissibility of expert
testimony. Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2017). To determine whether an
expert’s method is reliable, the Court considers the non-exhaustive list provided by the Supreme
Court in Daubert, including whether the expert’s method has been tested, whether it has been
subjected to peer review, the rate of error, standards controlling the method’s operation, and
whether the method is accepted by the expert community. United States v. Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d
259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (citing Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 593-94
(1993)).

But Rule 702 ultimately sets a “liberal” and “permissive” standard of admissibility.
Nimely v. City of New York, 414 F.3d 381, 395-96 (2d Cir. 2005). In particular, not every expert
admissible under Daubert need rely on a method that conforms with “the exactness of hard
science methodologies.” E.E.0.C. v. Bloomberg L.P., No. 07-CV-8383 (LAP), 2010 WL
3466370, at *13—-14 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 31, 2010) (quoting United States v. Simmons, 470 F.3d
1115, 1123 (Sth Cir. 2006)).

Additionally, the procedure for disclosing expert witnesses is governed by Federal Rule
of Criminal Procedure 16. That rule states that when the Government makes a request, the
Defense “must . . . give to the government a written summary of any testimony that the
defendant intends to use under Rules 702... . This summary must describe the witness’s
opinions, the bases and reasons for those opinions, and the witness’s qualifications.” Fed. R.
