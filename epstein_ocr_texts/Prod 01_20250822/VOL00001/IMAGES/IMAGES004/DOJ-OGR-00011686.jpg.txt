1 witnesses are known to the government, the defendant, to the

2 Court, and were shown to you during jury selection. This

3 process should not bear in any way on your evaluation of the

4 evidence in this case.

a Finally, let me caution you about certain rules and

6 principles governing your conduct as jurors in this case.

7 First, you must not talk to each other about this case
8 or about anyone who has anything to do with this case until the
9 end of the case, when you go to the jury room and decide your
10 verdict. And the reason for this requirement is that you must
11 not reach any conclusion on the charges until all of the

12 evidence is in. As I've said, keep an open mind until you

13 start your deliberations at the end of the case.

14 Second, do not communicate with anyone else about the
15 case or about anyone having anything to do with it until the

16 trial has ended and you've been discharged as jurors. "Anyone
17 else" includes members of your family and your friends. And

18 "no communicating about the case" means no communicating on

19 your cell phone, iPhone, BlackBerry, text messaging, websites,
20 internet chat rooms, email, social media websites or
21 applications, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn,
22 You Tube, Reddit, etc., or by any other means. I know in this
23 day and age there's a temptation to look at these devices or
24 means of communication; but with your oath, you are making a
25 commitment to resist that temptation. Of course, you may tell
