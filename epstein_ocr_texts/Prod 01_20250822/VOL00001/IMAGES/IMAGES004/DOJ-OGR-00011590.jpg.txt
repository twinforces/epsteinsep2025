1 someone and something in life one day.

2 Epstein's and Maxwell's strong ties to FIT could make
3 this happen. With their help, my admission was almost assured,
4 but there was always a but. First I had to write my

5 application, which I did. But Maxwell had to review it and

6 conveniently always found fault. Then another but, I needed to
7 lose 30 pounds because I was a piglet. Maxwell's numerous

8 degrading descriptions of me. Epstein and Maxwell put me ona
9 strict Atkins diet while simultaneously sending me to a

10 psychiatrist who prescribed antidepressants that caused weight
11 gain. It was a classic no-win situation, and they knew it:

12 Precisely what human traffickers seek. I never lost the

13 weight, my application was never good enough, and it never got
14 submitted.

15 I thank the almighty God that in 2007, I managed to

16 escape the horror by fleeing to the U.K. Since then, I have

17 been coping as best as I can and frequently experience

18 flashbacks and wake up in a cold sweat from nightmares from

19 reliving the awful experience. I'm hypervigilant. I do not
20 trust people easily. I experience dramatic mood changes. I
21 will sometimes start crying uncontrollably for reasons I cannot
22 always comprehend. I worked hard with several mental health
23 professionals. They have diagnosed me with extreme symptoms of
24 anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, PTSD and tendency to
25 self-harm.
