by several factors, among them the several hours that he had to wait in the courthouse’s security
line, to wait in the room to hear the Court’s instructional video, and then to begin answering
questions. And while he waited, he says, he was distracted by his thoughts on the recent end of a
romantic relationship. /d. at 14 (“I didn’t have a phone, I didn’t have a book, I was sitting there
twiddling my thumbs thinking about the break up that just happened a few weeks prior and
sitting in my feelings and not very focused.”). That explanation is not only consistent with his
other hearing testimony, but also with his sworn statements months earlier at oral voir dire. See
Nov. 16, 2021 Voir Dire Tr. at 133 (stating that he “just got out of a relationship and I didn’t
want to see anything regarding them”).

Distractions continued, and increased, as he neared the end of the questionnaire. Juror 50
testified that he was seated near the table where prospective jurors dropped off their completed
questionnaires. As more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, the noise and bustle at
that table increased. And as more potential jurors completed their questionnaires, he “felt
rushed” to finish so that he would not be the last to turn in a questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at 18.
Moreover, the Court credits Juror 50’s candid admission that he was not concerned with
following the Court’s instructions, and did not proceed with “diligence,” because he had
concluded that he would not be selected as a juror given the “sheer volume of people that were
there.” /d. at 13, 18; see also id. at 40.

This explanation coheres with Juror 50’s testimony that his sexual abuse history was not
a salient or front-of-mind consideration as he completed the questionnaire. He repeatedly
testified that he does not often think about his sexual abuse. See, e.g., id. at 16,22. The
summary of the charges, which do not use the terms “abuse” or “assault” but explained that the
Defendant had been charged with a total of six counts that involved “travel to engage in criminal
