that the core’participants of the conspiracies—Epstein, and.Ms. Maxwell—were consistent
throughout and that. Carolyn. was. a victim of the: conspiracies charged in. both. Count Three and
Count Five. (/d.) The addition of Sarah Kellen as a co-conspirator towards the end. ofthe
conspiracy does, not-create, multiple conspiracies. See United States 'v: Reid,.475 F: App’x.385,
387 (2d Cir. 20.12) (“[C]hanges:in membership do not necessarily convert a single conspiracy
into multiple conspiracies, and:there is no requirement that the same people'be involved.
throughout the duration of the conspiracy.” (cleaned:up)).

The government also argues that although-the time period of Count.Five (2001-2004) was
entirely contained-within the time period. of Count Three (1994-2004), there was no significant.
temporal overlap because “the gravamen. of the offense conduct for Count. Three occurred inthe
1990s, while:the offense conduct charged.in Count Five:took place in the:2000s.” (Opp. at 31).
That is, non-sensical. Count Three charges a conspiracy lasting continuously. from 1994-2004.
Just: because. three. of the witnesses testified about. conduct in the 1990s aiid oie of the Witnesses
testified about conduct in the 2000s, that does not mean that the 1990s conduct was somehow
more important-or more'relevant to Count: Three'than the 2000s conduct. As charged, the
conspiracy spanned the entire time period. Hence, the temporal overlap between Count Three
and. Count Five was‘not “minimal,” as the government contends. (Opp. at 31). It was complete.
The time period, of Count Five was entirely contained. within, and.overlapped. with, the time
period. of Count Three.

Finally, the government disingenuously argucs:that;the geographic scope ofthe two
conspiracies did not overlap because Count Three “was ‘focused on travel. to New York,”

Here; the government ts, talking out of both sides of its mouth. The government. argued
