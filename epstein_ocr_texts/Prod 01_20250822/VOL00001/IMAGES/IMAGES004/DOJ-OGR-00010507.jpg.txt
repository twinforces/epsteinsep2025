Dear Judge Nathan,
Ghislaine Noelle Marion Maxwell
My name is Catherine Vaughan-Edwards and | am sending this letter of support knowing it is
to be presented to the Court in connection with the sentencing of Ghislaine Maxwell for the
charges that she was found guilty of in December 2021. The content of this letter is true
and within my knowledge.
| first met Ghislaine in 1988 when she employed me as her Personal Assistant at Maxwell's
Corporate Gifts, a business she had started herself. | left her employment in 1989 but
remained in regular contact and count her as a close, personal, friend. | helped her move
from London to the US and stayed with her in New York for some weeks immediately after
the burial of her Father in 1991 to help her and provide moral support. | have visited her in
the US, stayed with her and her family and helped when they moved into their new house.
We always meet when she travels to the UK, she has stayed with my family, has known my
children since they were born and is Godmother to one of my sons.
