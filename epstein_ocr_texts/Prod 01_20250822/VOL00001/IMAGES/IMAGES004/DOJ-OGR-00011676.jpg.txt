1 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. I appreciate that.
2 THE COURT: Thank you.

3 All right. Let me check where we are.

4 (Pause)

5) THE COURT: We still have a few more jurors coming in
6 through the security line. So I'll wait to get an update.

7 We're getting close, but we're not there yet.

8 Counsel, matters to take up?

9 MS. COMEY: Nothing from the government, your Honor.
10 MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, could you just confirm

11 which rooms are the overflow rooms? Is it the fifth floor up
12 here and the first floor down there?

13 THE COURT: For the jurors you mean?

14 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes.

15 THE COURT: Yes, it's the fifth floor and the first
16 floor.

17 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you very much.

18 THE COURT: That's correct.

19 I believe the information I'm getting is that all the
20 jurors are here, but still some going through the security
21 check, which is good.
22 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I do have one other thing.
23 THE COURT: Just one moment.
24 MS. STERNHEIM: Sorry.
25 THE COURT: That's okay. Go ahead, Ms. Sternheim.
