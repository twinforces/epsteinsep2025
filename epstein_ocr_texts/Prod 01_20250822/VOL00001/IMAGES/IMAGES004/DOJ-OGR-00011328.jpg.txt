CONCLUSION

When. this Court read its’preliminary. instructions to the jury, it said:

As I mentioned during jury scléction, ‘this Case. has reccived. and, will continue to

réccive-significant attention-in:the media. To protect their privacy, | have permitted

witnesses, if. they choose, to ‘be referred. to.in open. court by cither their first. name

or a pseudonym. The full names of the witnesses:are known to.the government, the

defendant, to the Court, and were shown'to you during jury scleetion. This process

should ‘not. bear in. any way on your evaluation of the evidence in: this case.

Several government’ witnesses testified using pscudonyms or only their first names. The
logic of allowing that. process. applics with, cqual. if not greater force. here, given Ms. Maxwell’s.
‘constitutional rights to present:a defense, to compulsory“process, and to effective assistance of
counsel. These three defense witnesses mercly ask for the same considcration. given the
government’s several witnesses..Because their professional and personal privacy concerns are
significant ‘and substantial, and because testifyingundcr a pscudonym or a first name will not.
affect the government’s ability to fairly cross-cxamine them, this Court should permit(___],
Ms. ‘Healy, and Ms.[—___] to testify using pscudonyms or their first:names only, just as it

permitted, Jane, Kate, Carolyn, Matt, and Shawn to do, andthe courtroom.artists, should be:

precluded ‘from sketching their faces.
