and because nondisclosure of her true name will not deprive the government of the ability to
meaningfully cross-examine her, Ms. Healy’s interest in remaining anonymous outweighs any
government interest, “especially where the [government] knows the true identit[y] of [Ms.
Healy].” Gov. Mot. in Limine, p 8 (citing cases).

CONCLUSION

When this Court read its preliminary instructions to the jury, it said:

As I mentioned during jury selection, this case has received and will continue to

receive significant attention in the media. To protect their privacy, I have permitted

witnesses, if they choose, to be referred to in open court by either their first name

or a pseudonym. The full names of the witnesses are known to the government, the

defendant, to the Court, and were shown to you during jury selection. This process

should not bear in any way on your evaluation of the evidence in this case.
TR 11/29/2021, pp 24-25.

Several government witnesses testified using pseudonyms or only their first names. The
logic of allowing that process applies with equal if not greater force here, given Ms. Maxwell’s
constitutional rights to present a defense, to compulsory process, and to effective assistance of
counsel. These three defense witnesses merely ask for the same consideration given the
government’s several witnesses. Because their professional and personal privacy concerns are
significant and substantial, and because testifying under a pseudonym or a first name will not
affect the government’s ability to fairly cross-examine them, this Court should permit yyy,
Ms. Healy, and Ms. J to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only, just as it
permitted Jane, Kate, Carolyn, Matt, and Shawn to do, and the courtroom artists should be
precluded from sketching their faces.
