Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document616- Filed 02/24/22 Page 13 of 32

The government’s invocation of Tanner and Janniello is strikingly disingenuous. Both
cases involved alleged conduct during trial and, crucially, during deliberations. The interest in
“shielding jury deliberations from public scrutiny” is what motivated the Supreme Court’s
decision in Tanner, 483 U.S. at 119, and the Second Circuit’s cautionary note in Janniello, 866
F.2d at 543.

In this case, by contrast, xa
Res conduct that occurred outside the jury room. The reluctance
of courts to second-guess jury deliberations by inquiring into how the jury reached its decision
simply has no relevance here, and neither do Tanner or Janniello.

In fact, the government’s reliance on Janniello is doubly wrong, because the Second
Circuit there set aside any reluctance it might have had to question the conduct of deliberations
by ordering the defendant’s requested evidentiary hearing. As the Court explained, “a post-trial
jury hearing must be held when a party comes forward with ‘clear, strong, substantial and
incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.’”
Tanniello, 866 F.2d at 543 (quoting United States v. Moon, 718 F.2d 1210, 1234 (2d Cir. 1983)).*
Here, of course, the government concedes Ms. Maxwell’s entitlement to an evidentiary hearing.

The government cannot with a straight face claim that Ms. Maxwell’s motion risks
exposing Juror No. 50 to harassment and intimidation. Let’s be clear. The only reason Ms.
Maxwell knows of Juror No. 50’s false answers during voir dire is that Juror No. 50 has sought
out the limelight. He has sat for several interviews with journalists, he has allowed himself to be
videotaped, he has Tweeted and publicized himself on social media, and he has even participated

* To be clear, this standard does not apply to Ms. Maxwell’s claim; it applies when a new
trial motion alleges misconduct during deliberations. Janniello, 866 F.3d at 543; Moon, 718 F.3d
at 1234.
