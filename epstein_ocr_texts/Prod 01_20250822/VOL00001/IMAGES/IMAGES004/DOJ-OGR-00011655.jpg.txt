1 But it seems to me these witnesses are in very

2 different postures, and therefore different risk of prejudice.
3 But I propose an instruction that I think gets to the point.

4 And it's a different instruction precisely for this reason,

5 that that sexual conduct can be relevant evidence of the

6 enticement charge to violate New York law. So I do think some
7 charge with respect to that witness, some limiting instruction
8 with respect to that witness, is necessary. I won't make it

9 confusing, and I won't allow the government to just insert its
10 theory into the charge. But I'll take a look to see if there
11 is any additional clarification. That would be helpful.

12 MR. ROHRBACH: Just in response to Mr. Everdell's

13 point, your Honor, the government is not prepared to concede

14 today that the sexual activity that occurred in New Mexico was
15 above the relevant age of consent. As we briefed in our

16 letter, that's a complex question of New Mexico state law.

17 THE COURT: So, I mean, if there's a factual question
18 that the government intends to put on, as to whether that was
19 illegal sexual activity under New Mexico law, then certainly
20 I'm not going to -- again, that's not how you charged it.
21 That's not how you charged it here. Right? You haven't
22 charged pursuant to New Mexico law. But if what the government
23 is saying is, I shouldn't give that charge because in fact
24 you're going to show that it was illegal sexual activity -- I'm
25 not going to misinform the jury that it wasn't illegal under
