Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document621 _ Filed 02/25/22 Page 29 of 51

Here, not only are Counts Three and Five predicated.on different, statutes, but. the legal
distinctions between these counts are substantial. First, these counts had a.different age of consent,
as the age of.consent for Count Three:was seventeen. (by operation-of New York.law), whereas the
age of consent for'the conspiracy charged in Count Five was cightecn. Sccond, the conspiracies
had a different gcographic locus as .a.rcsult of thedifferent legal objects ofthe. conspiracies: Count.
Three concerned.travel to New’ York, whereas Count Five-did not.require:interstate transportation,
and. concerned acts mostly in Florida. Third, the scheme charged. in ‘Count Three concerned.
transporting minors to Epstein’s residence in. New: York :for sexual. abuse :in violation of‘state law,
whereas Count Five concerned commercial sex acts with victims, who were paid-to participate in.
so-called “massage” appointments. Indeed, the Government legally could not: have charged these
conspiracies together, because the: Trafficking Victims Protection Act-was not.enacted until 2000,
years, after the defendant and, Epstein victimized Jane and, Annie Farmer, as charged ‘in, the Mann,
Act conspiracy. Moreover, the-proof at trial established that Virginia Roberts was a victim-of the
defendant and. Epstcin, but; that conduct could not; have been charged ‘under the Mann Act.
conspiracies, which. had a lower age of :consent. In short, Counts Three and. Five charged

categorically different crimes.
