Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document662_ Filed 06/15/22 Page 22 of 29
Epstein and Ms. Maxwell ended their romantic relationship and “went their separate ways”: Ms.
Maxwell “moved on” from Epstein, stopped coming into the office, started dating other men, and
eventually entered a long-term, committed relationship with Ted Waitt. (Tr. 2370-71, 2374,
2378-80). Juan Alessi testified that Kellen “immediately took over” responsibility for answering
the phones and scheduling the massage appointments at the Palm Beach residence as soon as she
was hired. (Tr. 833). Carolyn herself testified that there was a clear break in time between when
Ms. Maxwell called her to schedule massage appointments and when Sarah Kellen called her.
(Tr. 1527) (Ms. Maxwell called her in roughly “the first year or two” of her visits to the Palm
Beach residence—2001-2002, according to Carolyn—and Kellen called her thereafter). Carolyn
recalled seeing Ms. Maxwell in the kitchen office of the Palm Beach residence during the period
when Kellen scheduled her massage appointments. (Tr. 1527). But nothing in her testimony
indicates that Ms. Maxwell supervised or directed Kellen or that Ms. Maxwell had anything to
do with the massage appointments at that time. (/d.). Accordingly, there is no basis in the trial
record to conclude that Ms. Maxwell supervised Sarah Kellen in connection with the offense
conduct and therefore no basis to apply the aggravating role enhancement.

Both Probation and the government contend that the aggravating role enhancement
applies because Ms. Maxwell was the organizer or leader of criminal activity relevant to each
victim that was “‘otherwise extensive.” (PSR at 58-59). But this position ignores the first step in
the analysis. Regardless of whether the criminal activity was “otherwise extensive,” no
aggravating role enhancement applies unless Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal
participant in the offense. USSG § 3B1.1, cmt. n.2. The record does not contain any evidence
was Epstein’s assistant or Ms. Maxwell’s assistant. (Tr. 204). He further conceded that his best recollection was
that Kellen was “an employee who worked with Epstein.” (Id.).
