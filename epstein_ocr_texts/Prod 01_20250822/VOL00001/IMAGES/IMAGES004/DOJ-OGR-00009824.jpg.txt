that “personal experiences” are “permissible influences on jury deliberations”); Arreola v.
Choudry, 533 F.3d 601, 606 (7th Cir. 2008) (jurors “are entitled to evaluate the evidence presented
at trial in light of their own experience’). Thus, so long as they do not introduce extra-record facts
about the defendant, there is nothing improper about jurors bringing their personal experiences to
bear during deliberations. McMann, 435 F.2d at 818 & n.5.

Here, if Juror 50 had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, there is every indication that the
voir dire would have proceeded as it did with the numerous similarly situated jurors. The Court
would have asked follow-up questions—substantially similar to the Second Circuit-approved
question above—designed to determine whether he could be fair and impartial. If he had credibly
disclaimed partiality, he would not have been struck from the jury.

ii. Implied Bias

Implied bias, also called “presumed bias,” is “‘bias conclusively presumed as a matter of
law.’” Torres, 128 F.3d at 45 (quoting Wood, 299 U.S. at 133). That is, a finding of implied bias
does not turn on the juror’s answers to questions during voir dire, but rather whether an “average
man” in a similar situation would be biased. /d. at 45-46. The Second Circuit has emphasized that
this category is “narrow,” and “reserved for ‘exceptional situations.’” /d. at 46. Generally, it is
limited to circumstances in which there is a relationship between the juror and the parties or the
crime itself. See id. at 45 (“[A ]utomatically presumed bias deals mainly with jurors who are related
to the parties or who were victims of the alleged crime itself.”); Greer, 285 F.3d at 172 (“[T]he
District Court refused to find implied bias because it found the issues affecting juror Baker to be
insufficiently ‘drastic.’ Juror Baker was, after all, neither related to a party nor a victim of the
defendants’ crimes.”).
