PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Ghislaine Maxwell played an instrumental role in the horrific sexual abuse of multiple
young teenage girls. As part of a disturbing agreement with Jeffrey Epstein, Maxwell identified,
groomed, and abused multiple victims, while she enjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury and
privilege. In her wake, Maxwell left her victims permanently scarred with emotional and
psychological injuries. That damage can never be undone, but it can be accounted for in crafting
a just sentence for Maxwell’s crimes.

The Government respectfully submits this memorandum in connection with the sentencing
of Maxwell in the above-captioned case, which is scheduled for June 28, 2022, and in response to
the defendant’s June 15, 2022 sentencing memorandum and objections to the Pre-Sentence
Investigation Report prepared by the United States Probation Office. For the reasons set forth
below, the Government maintains that under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the
“Guidelines” or “U.S.S.G.”), the applicable sentencing range is 360 months to life imprisonment.
Because the statutory maximum penalty is 660 months’ imprisonment, the Guidelines range
becomes 360 to 660 months’ imprisonment.
