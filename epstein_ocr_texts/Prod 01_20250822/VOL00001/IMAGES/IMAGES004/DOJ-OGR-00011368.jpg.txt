e In February 2020, Jane told:the. government that Eva ‘was.Mr. Epstcin’s ex-girlfriend and
they. stayed, friends, just as Mr. Visoski testified. When, the group massages began, to
involve others beyond ‘Mr. Epstein, Ms. Maxwell joined in with Sophie and Eva. Sophie
and.Eva “knew’the routine.”

o In August 20211, Jane-told the government'that.Eva was the “Ms Sweden Lady” (Mr.
Visoski, testified that Eva‘Dubin;was a former Ms. Sweden), At the time, Jane did.“not
remember” Eva “being involved in massages,” but maybe Eva, ‘‘aged out of that.” /d. At.
the same:time,, Jane “did not recall there. being another.Eva.”

o In her testimony in this case, Jaric told the jury that Eva ‘was. involved in'the group.
scxualized massages with Mr. ‘Epstein, Sophic, and:Ms. Maxwell, that she “knew’the
routine,” and that ‘she “could confirm. her'story.”

The record is clear that Jane. has:previously claimed (in-February 2020) and testified (in.
this casc) that Eva Dubin‘was involved ‘in the sexualized massages with, Mr. Epstein and Ms.
Maxwell. Given that allegation, Ms. Maxwell has a constitutional right to call Eva:Dubin'to the
stand and:present her testimony, which will. deny the allegations and contradict Jane’s claims.

Perhaps hoping this Court;won’t notice, the government burics. mostof the facts. about
Jane’s allegations about.Eva in a. footnote. Gov. Letter, pp 5-6 n.1. But even that footnoté
mischaracterizes what Jane said.about Eva. Jane did noftell the government'that'Eva, Dubin was
not involved in, group sexualized massages. At most, Jane said. she “doesnot remember DUBIN
being involved in:massages.” See 3509-020, p 1. But that*s:contrary‘to what she. said:in February
2020, and.it’s contrary. to what.she:said on, the stand. And. it’s wholly inconsistent-with Jane’s

statement that. she: “does not recall there being another Eva: Jd. at 2.
