Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document614 Filed 02/24/22 Page 4 of 12

Since: the beginning of our, Republic, ‘sensational high-profile trials have, complicated,
cfforts:to climinate bias ‘from the jury through voir dite,’ but never before have jurors been as
incentivizedto lic. In,the past, coupling voir dire with prospectivejurors swearing an oath to tell
the truth was a powerful way to climinate bias, but the oath:no, longer earrics the force that it once
did. As a formerChicf'Judge of. thisCourt remarked:

When our judicial system was established and the: requirement ofan oath or affirmation
on the:part of a witness was borrowed. from the British common law, the swearing of an

oath meant something namely, that the court could be fairly sure: that a-witnicss would

witness stand, based:on the Ninth Commandment’s proscription, handed:down.by God'to
Moses that “Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy’ neighbor” (Exodus, Ch. 20,
Verse 16 (King James. Version)). Unfortunately; the sanctity of the oath taken by
‘witnesses at trial has been significantly eroded and laccd with:skepticism in.recent years.

(2017) (noting that prospectivejurors:now frequently lic during voir dire).
Prospective jurors:tiow have more reason to hie than'thcy did.in the past because they know
that sitting.as jurors in a high-profile trial may bring them fame; prestige, and even.profit. We: live

in.an age of reality television in which the “true crime” genre is dominant. Jurors often find.

themselves instant eclebritics. They are interviewed by the press atid'talk shows,” and often seek,

that an impartial trial for Burr’s alleged treason could be. chosen through voir dire).
