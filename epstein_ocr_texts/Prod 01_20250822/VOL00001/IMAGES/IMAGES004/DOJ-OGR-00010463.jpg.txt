Exhibit F.
Catherine Vaughan-Edwards, a friend, former employee, and the mother of Ghislaine’s
godson, relates her experience as a mentee:
The person that I have known for 34 years, is not the same as the Ghislaine so
negatively portrayed by the press and mainstream media. My own experience
is that she is kind, caring and thoughtful and is always there to provide support
as a loyal and generous friend. She has been a mentor, encouraging and
helping me to develop my business and gives her time and advice freely.
Exhibit G.
And, finally, Harriet Jagger, a school mate from age 15, shares Ghislaine’s longing for a
family life:
The last time I saw Ghislaine was in her home in New York a few years ago. I
listened to her as she spoke of her wish to find the security and happiness within
a family unit, she was visibly upset that this, the simplest of things for so many
others had still not been a part of her own life. I felt truly sorry for her. Having
known her large and great family, her love and great respect for her parents and
closeness to her brothers and sisters, I knew this was something she had always
craved. I gave her a huge hug on departing. So I was then thrilled to learn that she
had finally met and married someone and was helping bring up his young
children, but them desperate to hear that this much sought-after joy was so short
lived.

As the Supreme Court has repeatedly explained, “a district court should begin all
sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable guidelines range. As a matter of
administration and to secure nationwide consistency, the guidelines should be the starting point
and the initial benchmark.” Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 530, 536 (2013) (quoting Gall v.
