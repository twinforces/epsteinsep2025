Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670 _ Filed 06/22/22 Page15o0f55
involved the same course of abuse. At some point during each massage, Epstein rolled over and
began masturbating himself. (/d.). Epstein then directed Carolyn to touch his nipples and he
touched Carolyn’s breasts and buttocks. (/d.). On one occasion, Epstein attempted to touch
Carolyn’s vagina with a vibrator, but Carolyn pulled away, so he stopped. (/d.). On two occasions,

on one occasion Epstein raped Carolyn by penetrating her vagina with his penis. (PSR { 72).

The defendant saw Carolyn fully nude in the massage room on approximately three
occasions. (PSR 4 69). This happened when Carolyn had already undressed in preparation for the
massage but before Epstein had come into the room. (/d.). One particular instance stands out in
Carolyn’s mind. (/d.). When Carolyn was 14 years old, she had set up the massage table and was
