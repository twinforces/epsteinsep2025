Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document691. Filed.11/22/21 Page 6of7

Second, even, if Gershman’s testimony was relevant, Rule 403 prejudice would
substantially outweigh for the reasons given at the November | conference. Jd. at.21-24.
Gershman’s testimony would be likely’to confuse the jury by suggesting that the Government’s
choices of investigative techniques are relevant to guilt, it would conflict withthe Court’s
anticipated jury instruction that the Government is. not-on trial, it-;would substantially: delay the
trial, and it would, at most, be:cumulative ofthe Defense’s arguments that there is inadequate
evidence on which: to find Ms. Maxwell. guilty. Indeed, placing an cxpert:imprimatur on these
arguments. would only enhance:the Rule 403 prejudice.

Third, apart from Rule 401 and.403, the Defense’s disclosure of Gershman, docs not.
satisfy Rule 16. The Defense: has listed only. the general topics on. which Gershman will testify,
like “investigation,” “media. contact,” and “neutrality.” .Notice:at:1.2. It docs not: mention.
Gershman’s actual opinions on;these topics or, the bases ‘for those opinions. Nor docs the
Defense’s response bricfiadd any‘ detail about'the, content of Gershman’s opinions. Def! Br. at.
18. Indeed, the ‘Defense’s briefing on this issue mentions very: little of Gershman’s anticipated.
testimony: Therefore, even if Rules 401 and 403 were satisfied, the Court would exclude
Gershman’s testimony: because the: Defense. has:not yet.satisfied Rule 16.

Il. ‘Conclusion

The Court theréfore grants the Government’s ‘motion to preclude Gershman’s expert
testimony: Because this is .a:preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and.
circumstanecs at trial would alter the Court’s'analysis. In that: event, the: Defense;must re-raise

its. request to admit’ Gershman as an expert witness.
