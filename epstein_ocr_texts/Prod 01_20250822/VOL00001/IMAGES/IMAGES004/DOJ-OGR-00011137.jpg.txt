Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document691 Filed 11/22/21 Page6éof7

Second, even if Gershman’s testimony was relevant, Rule 403 prejudice would
substantially outweigh for the reasons given at the November 1 conference. /d. at 21-24.
Gershman’s testimony would be likely to confuse the jury by suggesting that the Government’s
choices of investigative techniques are relevant to guilt, it would conflict with the Court’s
anticipated jury instruction that the Government is not on trial, it would substantially delay the
trial, and it would, at most, be cumulative of the Defense’s arguments that there is inadequate
evidence on which to find Ms. Maxwell guilty. Indeed, placing an expert imprimatur on these
arguments would only enhance the Rule 403 prejudice.

Third, apart from Rule 401 and 403, the Defense’s disclosure of Gershman does not
satisfy Rule 16. The Defense has listed only the general topics on which Gershman will testify,
like “investigation,” “media contact,” and “neutrality.” Notice at 12. It does not mention
Gershman’s actual opinions on these topics or the bases for those opinions. Nor does the
Defense’s response brief add any detail about the content of Gershman’s opinions. Def. Br. at
18. Indeed, the Defense’s briefing on this issue mentions very little of Gershman’s anticipated
testimony. Therefore, even if Rules 401 and 403 were satisfied, the Court would exclude
Gershman’s testimony because the Defense has not yet satisfied Rule 16.

Ii. Conclusion

The Court therefore grants the Government’s motion to preclude Gershman’s expert
testimony. Because this is a preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and
circumstances at trial would alter the Court’s analysis. In that event, the Defense must re-raise
its request to admit Gershman as an expert witness.
