1 information about the status of the estate. With respect to

2 whether this information should be in the PSR, I think the

3 Court is exactly right. This is listed on an asset on her

4 balance sheet. Whether she ultimately recovers that amount or
5 not, it's listed in the same way that liabilities are listed

10 Ms. Maxwell's financial aid affidavit. The uncertain assertion
11 that she may Lose the asset is not a basis to exclude it froma
12 considered asset for purposes of determining a fine.

13 Paragraph 178, the assertion here is that she is

14 unable to pay a fine.

15 Do I have that right, Mr. Everdell?

16 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: I overrule the objection. Section

18 5SE1.2(a) of the Guidelines requires the Court to impose a fine
19 in all cases except where the defendant establishes that she is
20 unable to pay and is not likely to become able to pay any fine.
21 The defendant has failed to establish this. As I just noted,
22 there is a $10 million bequest from Epstein this is in addition
23 to other assets noted in the PSR.
24 I will say the assets and finances have been a moving
25 target. In July 2020, Ms. Maxwell reported $3.8 million in
