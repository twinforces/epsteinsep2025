Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document673_ Filed 06/24/22 Page2of3
victims have a right to be heard in connection with sentencing under the Crime Victims’ Rights
Act. See 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4).

With respect to all other victim impact statements, which were not solicited by the
Government, the Government is not asking the Court to make any factual findings about these
individuals at sentencing or to consider these statements when weighing the factors under 18
U.S.C. § 3553(a). However, in light of the Court’s “largely unlimited” discretion “as to the kind
of information it may consider, or the source from which it may come,” United States v. Eberhard,
525 F.3d 175, 177 (2d Cir. 2008) (cleaned up), the Court may accept these statements as part of
the record at sentencing. The Government defers to the Court as to whether and in what form it
wishes to accept statements from these individuals.

Finally, the Government opposes the redaction of any victim impact statements. The
defendant has not justified her redaction requests under the three-part test articulated in Lugosch
v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). To the extent there is a privacy interest
at stake in these documents, it belongs to the victims, who are not seeking to file these letters under
seal. The defendant gestures at a due process interest, but the decisionmaker at sentencing is the
Court, who will be able to review the redacted portions and evaluate them to the extent the Court
thinks them useful. No due process interest is protected by withholding victim impact statements
from the public.
