The ‘fact that Juror.50 filed these’pleadings docs not make them “judicial, documents.”
United States. Amedeo (“Amodeo 1”), 44 F.3d 141,145 (2d. Cir. 1995) (“We think that the
merc filing of a.paper or document with the court is insufficient to render that paper a.judicial
document-subjcet'to, the right: of public access. We think that the item filed must be relevant to
the performance of the judicial function and. useful in the judicial:process. in order for it to be
designated.a, judicial document.”). Moreover, Ms. Maxwell, anticipates moving to strike the
‘pleadings and, if stricken, the :documents enjoy no ‘presumption of public access. Brown ¥.
Maxwell, 929 F.3d.41,'5 1-52 (2d Cir. 2019)([under Civil Rule‘12], “the district court:may strike
‘such material from the filings. on,the grounds that it ‘is “redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or
scandalous.” Because such rejected or stricken material is not “relevant tothe performaiice. ofthe
presumption of public access.”).

The Second Circuit established.a, framework in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d.1.10 (2d Cir, 2006) for-courts to utilize in-determining when the ‘public ‘has a.
right of access to particular documents. The Court of Appeals held that “[b]cfore ary such
common. law right.can attach, however, a court must first: conclude:that:the documents at: issuc:
are indeed, ‘judicial documents.’” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 119. “Onee the court has determined ‘that
the documents are judicial.documents and that'therefore.a common. law presumption of access
attaches, it: must determine the weight of that presumption.” /d. “Finally, after determining the
weight of the presumption. of access, the court must. ‘balance competing considerations against

it? dd. at 120.
