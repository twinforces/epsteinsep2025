MS. MOE: That’s correct, your Honor.

THE COURT: So [Ms. Maxwell] couldn’t be convicted with respect to that count

[based solely on Kate’s testimony].

MS. MOE: That’s correct, your Honor.

11/1/2021 Tr. 67:15-68:19. Asa result, the Court agreed, over the objection of the government,
to give the jury a limiting instruction before the start of Kate’s testimony which stated, among
other things, that “any sexual conduct she says occurred with Mr. Epstein was not ‘illegal sexual
activity’ as the government has charged in the indictment.” Tr. 1167:23-1168:2. The Court also
gave a similar limiting instruction before Annie Farmer’s testimony because she testified about
sexual contact in New Mexico, which could not have violated New York law. Tr. 2048:22-
2049:1.

Similarly, when the parties submitted their proposed joint requests to charge, the defense
requested that the instructions for the substantive Mann Act counts specify that the government
must prove that Jane traveled “from Florida to New York, as charged in the Indictment,” as
opposed to simply that Jane traveled “in interstate commerce.” Dkt. 410-1 at 19. The defense
highlighted that the addition was necessary because it was expected that Jane would testify
“about traveling to, among other places, Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico” and “the elements
should make clear that the relevant travel for purposes of Count Two is travel from Florida to
New York, as alleged in the S2 Indictment.” /d. The government objected to the addition,
stating it was unnecessary because travel to New York was already in the “to wit” clause of the
Indictment and that “there [was] no need to include words like ‘travel from Florida to New York’
... to avoid any suggestion of a variance.” Tr. 2759:12-2760:9. The Court agreed with the
government. The final jury charge did not specifically mention travel “to New York” and
