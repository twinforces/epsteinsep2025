$3,000,000 —-weré lager than PaitS¢ neéded for the, 2000, -yéar, suggesting that he intendéd to

Taxes); GX. 54-1 (J&G Opinion. Letter for Parse). Parse's reccipt of,a free opinion letter, which
would have otherwise cost him-no less than $90,000 (and likely more)* had he:paid the going-rate

the. desigh, marketing, and. ifiplementation of the fraudulent J&G tax shelters, but also the
‘implementation-of:fraudulently backdated’ when.Donna Guerin and-others:at J&G realized.that the:

shelters had.been implemented incorrectly; ornot consistent with the clients” wishes withrespect to

Paise éxccuted a:$3,000,000 shott-options deal through J&G., Using-a.conservative 3%
fee results ina $90,000 opinion. letter ‘value. Parse: only deducted. just over $1.2. million of the
$3,000,000 in losses on his 2000:return, and. thus ‘had available just:under $1.8 million in. losses'to
use on futuretax:returns. Although Parse ultimately did-not.utilizethose additional losses (because
he reversed his own.transactionwhen the IRS began: investigating), the-proper view of Parse’s own,
fraudulent transaction,should take into ‘account‘the full amount of fraudulent benefit he produced.
