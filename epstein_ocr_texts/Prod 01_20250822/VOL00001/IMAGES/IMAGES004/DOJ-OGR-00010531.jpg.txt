Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 667 Filed 06/21/22 Page 2of2

dies before the final, judgment is. issued, the;Indictment must be dismissed. under'the:rule of
abatement. See United States v. Wright 160 F.3d 905; 908 (2d Cir: 1998). Although the Court
‘was, required to dismiss the itidictment, it conducted a public. hearing and :provided Epstein’s
victims:a. forum.to be heard prior'to signing the noe prosequi. See United States-y. Epstein, 19
Cr. 490 (RMB), Dkt. 53.

The victim statements in Judge Berman’s proceeding’ had no impact: on the ‘rights of a,
‘defendant whose case is abated. Such is not the case here. While it.is appropriate for victims to
be present. pursuant.to the CVRA, Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding should not.be an open
forum for. any alleged victim. to be: heard. Neither Ms. Ransome nor Ms. Stein are part.of the:
record, in this case. We are conecrned.about the impact, statements by. alleged victims who were
not part of the trial, or whose names.are not part;of the;record and'who otherwise do not qualify
as “crime'victims” under the CVRA will have on the Court’s sentencing determination. We:
request a preview of the manner .in’whieh:the, Court will conduct the scntencing;procccding and.
advance notice of the individuals who will be:permitted to speak.

Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing’ proceeding should not be .an open, forum ‘for ‘anyone to come
forward'‘who was not identificd as ‘a;victim of the charged offenses.

Very truly yours,
