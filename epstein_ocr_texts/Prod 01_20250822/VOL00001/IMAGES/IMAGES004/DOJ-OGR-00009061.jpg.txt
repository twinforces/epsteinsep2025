sought to distance himself from his original statements, attempted to destroy evidence,
and tried to flee from the media.

Under analogous circumstances courts have refused discovery to individuals or
entities under investigation. See John Doe Agency v. John Doe Corp., 493 U.S. 146,

C. Juror No. 50’s filings should be stricken or, alternatively, remain under
seal.

Tamarind Drive, Hallendale, Fla., No. 98 CIV. 2279 DLC, 2011 WL 1045095, at *2
(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 11, 2011). A stricken pleading 1s a nullity with no legal effect. Davis v.
