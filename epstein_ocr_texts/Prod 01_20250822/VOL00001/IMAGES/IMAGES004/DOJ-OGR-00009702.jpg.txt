The questionnaire began with a summary of the indictment and the allegations
against Ms. Maxwell, including allegations of sexual trafficking, enticement, and
transportation.

Given the accusations and the sensitivity of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual
harassment, and the powerful effects such assault, abuse, and harassment can have, the
questionnaire included several questions designed to elicit whether a potential juror had
ever been abused, assaulted, or harassed, and how that might affect their ability to be an
unbiased fact finder.

For example, Question No. 13 asked potential jurors if they could decide the case
purely the evidence or lack of evidence and not based on any biases, sympathies, or
prejudices.

Question 25 asked potential jurors if they were ever a victim of a crime and, if so,
whether that experience would prevent them from being fair and impartial.

Questions 42-50 asked jurors about their feelings and experiences with the types
of alleged conduct at issue in the case, including sexual assault, sexual abuse, and sexual
harassment.

Question 42 asked whether the nature of the allegations against Ms. Maxwell
“might make it difficult” for potential jurors to be fair and impartial. Question 43 asked
potential jurors if they had views about the laws concerning the age of consent and if
those views would affect their ability to be fair and impartial. Question 44 asked potential
jurors if they had views about the laws governing sex trafficking and sex crimes against
minors and if those views would affect their ability to be fair and impartial. Question 47
