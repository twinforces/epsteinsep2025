On November 29, 2021, the defendant proceeded to trial on Counts One though Six.! On
December 29, 2021, the jury returned a guilty verdict on Counts One, Three, Four, Five, and Six.
The proof at trial established that over the course of a decade, the defendant facilitated and
participated in the sexual abuse of multiple young girls. From 1994 to 2004, the defendant and
Epstein worked together to identify girls, groom them, and then entice them to travel and transport
them to Epstein’s properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, and elsewhere. (PSR § 22). The
girls—some of whom were as young as 14 years old—were then sexually abused, often under the
guise of a “massage.” (/d.).

Beginning in approximately 1991, the defendant had a close and intimate relationship with
Epstein. (PSR ¥ 23). The defendant was Epstein’s girlfriend for many years, until in or about the
early 2000s; after that point, the defendant and Epstein remained close friends. (/d.). For over a
decade, the defendant traveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his private planes and mingled
with rich and famous people. (/d.). As the defendant wrote in an essay, she and Epstein were “a
couple” who were “rarely apart,” “great partners,” and “the best of friends.” (/d.). The defendant
enjoyed a life of extraordinary luxury with Epstein. (/d.). The defendant and Epstein spent time
together in Epstein’s various properties, including his mansion on the Upper East Side in
Manhattan, his villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his apartment in Paris, and his
private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. (/d.). During the timeframe of the conspiracy, Maxwell
received exceptional benefits from Epstein. Beyond the lavish lifestyle that she enjoyed side-by-
' On April 16, 2021, the Court granted the defendant’s motion to sever the perjury charges for a
separate trial. (Dkt. No. 207). The Government intends to move to dismiss the perjury counts at
the time of sentencing in light of the victims’ significant interests in bringing closure to this matter
and avoiding the trauma of testifying again. (Dkt. No. 574).
