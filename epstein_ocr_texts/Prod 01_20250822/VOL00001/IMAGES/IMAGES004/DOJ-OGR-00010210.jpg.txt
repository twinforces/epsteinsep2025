2. Parse’s Personal Tax Evasion

Parse executed his own fraudulent SOS tax shelter transaction to eliminate the gains he
eared in 2000, and received a free fraudulent opinion letter from J&G. The losses Parse created —
$3,000,000 — were larger than Parse needed for the 2000 year, suggesting that he intended to
eliminate taxes in more than one year. On his 2000 tax return, Parse claimed a $1,278,706
fraudulent loss, evading $517,542 in taxes on over $2.1 million in income. See GX 1001-132 (Parse
2000 Tax Return); GX 1000-52 (IRS Certificate of Assessment and Payments for Parse’s 2000
Taxes); GX 54-1 (J&G Opinion Letter for Parse). Parse's receipt of a free opinion letter, which
would have otherwise cost him no less than $90,000 (and likely more)’ had he paid the going rate
for a J&G opinion letter, violated Deutsche Bank's gift prohibition policy and almost certainly
violated the law, in that it constituted his receipt of an unlawful commission or gift by a bank
official. See 18 U.S.C. § 215 (unlawful for any bank employee to accept anything of value intended
to be rewarded in connection with business of bank).

3. Parse’s Participation in the Fraudulent Backdating of Transactions

As detailed in paragraphs 44-52 of the PSR, Parse’s conduct involved not only assisting in
the design, marketing, and implementation of the fraudulent J&G tax shelters, but also the
implementation of fraudulently backdated when Donna Guerin and others at J&G realized that the
shelters had been implemented incorrectly, or not consistent with the clients’ wishes with respect to

> Parse executed a $3,000,000 short options deal through J&G. Using a conservative 3%
fee results in a $90,000 opinion letter value. Parse only deducted just over $1.2 million of the
$3,000,000 in losses on his 2000 return, and thus had available just under $1.8 million in losses to
use on future tax returns. Although Parse ultimately did not utilize those additional losses (because
he reversed his own transaction when the IRS began investigating), the proper view of Parse’s own
fraudulent transaction should take into account the full amount of fraudulent benefit he produced.
