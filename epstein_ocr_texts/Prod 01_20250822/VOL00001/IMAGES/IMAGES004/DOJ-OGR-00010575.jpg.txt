Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670_ Filed 06/22/22 Page 40 of 55

‘identified. a. total, of thirty-two minor victims, including Carolyn. and. Virginia.” Of those thirty=
two individuals, thirtecn. appear in the message ‘pads, again including Carolyn and Virginia.

The Government notes that, from interviewing many of these victims. during, the course of
its investigation, the Government has learned that, in, the later phases of the: conspiracy, victims
primarily scheduled. appointments with—and interfaced with—Epstcin’ s:personal assistants, who
were in their carly twentics.° Although the Government does not seek: to include these minors: as
victims ‘for purposes, of the Guidelines calculation, the scope, of the pyramid scheme that ‘the
defendant helped. devise ‘with Epstein. bears emphasis: when. ‘evaluating the harms: that. the
defendant’s criminal conduct ultimately caused.

Victim Impact

It.is difficult to capture in:words the: harm that Maxwell. caused to her victims. They were
children who experienced what can only be deseribed,as a recurring nightmare: again and. again,
they found ‘themselves alone with, Maxwell, and Epstein, in terrifying mansions where. they were
sexually’ abused and physically violated. They were trapped in an. exploitative relationship with,
Maxwell and.Epstein that, for many‘victims, lasted for years.

Often, in cases involving’ sexual. exploitation, the Court is left to consider the harms: the
victims have suffered. during the offense conduct and. to predict the likely effects on their lives

going ‘forward. What.is remarkable in this case:is that the Court.need maké no such predictions

* The letter was marked with Jencks Act control number 3505-022. With:the exception of Carolyn,
and. Virginia, ‘none of the: other thirty individuals named in, this document have been. ‘publicly’

Of course, there can. be:no comparison between ‘the defendant—a. woman. jin her .fortics::in the
2000s—and the young ‘women, (often in their very carly twentics) who worked as personal,
assistants, and whose: roles and life circumstances dramatically differed from, those of the:
defendant.
