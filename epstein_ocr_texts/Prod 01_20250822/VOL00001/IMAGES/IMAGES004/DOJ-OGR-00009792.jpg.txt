1 THE COURT: Since you took the questionnaire -- now is
2 the time to tell me -- have you read or researched or discussed
3 the case with anyone?

4 JUROR: I have not.

5 THE COURT: Schedule. The trial will start on

6 November 29. We estimate approximately six weeks. Can you sit
7 during that time?

8 JUROR: Yes.

9 THE COURT: I am going to ask you to pick up the

10 binder in front of you, please.

11 If you turn to Tab 2, there are three pages that lists
12 names of people who may be mentioned during the trial. I want
13 you to take your time, read all of those names. If there are
14 any that are familiar to you, please let me know what number.
15 JUROR: None.

16 THE COURT: Three pages.

17 JUROR: None.

18 THE COURT: Then the next tab is one page, and it

19 lists some addresses and entities that may be mentioned during
20 trial. Here, the question is not whether you have heard of any
21 of them, but do you have any specific familiarity?
22 JUROR: No.
23 THE COURT: Then the last tab. As the instructions
24 say, don't say it out loud, but just yes or no. Other than
25 having heard of it, do you have any specific familiarity?
