denies Jane’s claims, if Jane ‘is telling the truth, then Michelle is.a victim, just as, much.as Jane is.
See18 U.S.C. 3771 (c)(2)(A) (the Crime Victims.Act, defining “crime’victim” means as “a
person.directly and ‘proximately harmed as a result‘of the commission of a Federal offense”).
Thus, forthe very'same reasons Carolyn could.testify using only'her first: name; so too should
Michelle be permitted to testify using her first name only. See TR 11/1/2021, pp 6-13. (It would
be impractical for Michelle to use 'a’pseudonym since her true first. name is already in the record,
though her last naiic is not.) If Michelle Healy’s full name is revealed tothe public, she will. be
subject.to the same:scorn, harassment, embarrassment, and intimidation that this Court-relicd on
to grant witnesses like Carolyn the privilege of testifying using only their first:names. TR.

consequences.”); see Gov. Mot: in. Limine, pp: 3=14 (citing authority and arguing for anonymity
for. the alleged. victims in this casc).

Co___]isanadult,——._]]. There. is;no allegation thatshe is

the victim of any improper or illegal conduct by Mr. Epstcin or Ms. Maxwell. Even.so, Ms.

the inevitable: harassment and intimidation that will follow: because of being outed as a
“masseuse” associated with, Mr. Epstein.

Not only will Ms.[7__] be subject to harassment and intimidation if her true name is
disclosed, disclosure will also threaten the “loss.of employment potentially resulting, from trial

publicity.” See Mareus, 2007 WL 330388, at *1.'Because Ms. Healy’s truc name iis not; relevant,
