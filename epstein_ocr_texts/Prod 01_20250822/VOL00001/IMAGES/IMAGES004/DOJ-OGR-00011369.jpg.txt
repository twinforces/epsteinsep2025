Ms. Maxwell has a right'to present:the'testimony of Eva, who will deny Jane’s
allegations of being involved in the group scxualized massages that are 'the basis of the charges

B. Michell Healy’s testimony will contradict Jane’s ‘testimony.

Michelle’s testimony-will. also contradict Jane’s testimony. As to Michelle; this. is what

Jane testified'to on the, stand:

Ko]

There was a fourth:woman, Jane remembers, named ‘Michelle, who was short. TR,at'526.
° Jane hung,out with Michelle and Emmy: and sometimes went out:with Michelle and.
Emmy. /d., at'527.?
2, Michelle was also involved in,“group massages.” /d.
The government did not examine Jane on any of these points, and it did not ask, Jane
whether Michelle/was only involved in. group massages. with.Mr. Epstein, after Janie attained-the

age of 17.7 Nor did-the government ask Jane during its intervicws’when, Michelle:was involved

* The government's letter conveniently: omits this testimony from Jane, which, as
described below, establishes that: Michelle: Healy i is'‘the Michelle:who Jane alleged was involved
‘in group’ sexualized. massages.

3 The government’s attempt to bootstrap Rule 412. into, its motion fails. Gov. Letter, -p 7.
In her intervicw-with the. government, Jane said she’was involved with sexualized massages with
Michelle in-New Y.ork when she was “young.” See 3509-001, p:4. Evenzif, based on Jane’s trial
testimony, one:might, infer she was I'7 years old.at.the time of the sexualized massages with
Michelle, she said something different in her interviews with the government: And im any cvent,
because the sexualized. massages are the very conduct at issuc in this cas¢é and aré fot collateral,
Ms. Maxwell does not have to.aceept Janc’s trial testimony as. the last Word. on.the issue. “The
law of evidence has long recognized that a cross-cxaminer is:not required.to ‘take the answer”
of a witness on.a,non-collateral issue, United States v. Harvey, 547 F 2d 720,'722 (2d Cir. 1976),
such'as her'allegations about;the very conduct she says 1s criminal.
