Twitter post by Annie Farmer. (Def. Mem. at 13, 15-16). But he did these things after trial, having
heard all the evidence that proved that, as the Government argued, the defendant was in fact a
predator and that the victims, including Farmer, were credible. Juror 50’s attitudes towards the
defendant and the victims after he heard compelling evidence of the defendant’s guilt and the
victims’ credible testimony says nothing about the relevant inquiry here: whether he was biased
“before he heard the evidence presented.” United States v. Stewart, 317 F. Supp. 2d 432, 440
(S.D.N.Y. 2004), aff'd, 433 F.3d 273, 306 (2d Cir. 2006) (emphasis in original); see also id. at 439
n.4 (finding no bias where juror in Martha Stewart trial said the verdict was “a victory for the little
guy who loses money in the markets” and that the defendant “thought she was above everything’’).

Similarly, the defendant gestures at an actual bias argument when she states that it is
“clear,” based on Juror 50’s statements to the media,!? that he was not fair and impartial “because
his personal experiences ‘prevent[ed] or substantially impair[ed] the performance of his duties as
a juror.’” (Def. Mem. at 44 (quoting Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 424 (1985))). There and
elsewhere, the defendant’s brief seems to suggest that jurors are required to check their lived
experiences at the jury room door. Not so:

We cannot expunge from jury deliberations the subjective opinions

of jurors, their additudinal expositions, or their philosophies. These

involve the very human elements that constitute one of the strengths

of our jury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate

them from jury deliberations.
U.S. ex rel. Owen v. McMann, 435 F.2d 813, 818 (2d Cir. 1970); see also United States v. Bangiyev,
No. 07 Cr. 331 (NG) (RLM), 2008 WL 4240005, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 2008) (explaining
‘8 As noted above, many if not all of the statements upon which the defendant relies describe
deliberations and are thus inadmissible under Rule 606(b). And even if they were not, Juror 50’s
public statements about deliberations in fact demonstrate that he (and the jury more generally) was
impartial. See infra n.5.
