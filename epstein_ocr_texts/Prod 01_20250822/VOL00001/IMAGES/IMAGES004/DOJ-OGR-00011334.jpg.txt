Q. When you were approximately 17 years old, where were you. living?

A. I was.living’ in England, London.

Q. What. neighborhood in London.did you live?

A. Belgravia.

TR. 12/6/2021, p1.172:2-6. She: said:

Q..And approximately'what year’were you I7 years, old?

A. God, .I can’t do the math. So that was °94.

Q. Is'that; 1994?

A. Yes.

Id. at.1.72:22-25, Then, after identifying a. photo of Ms, Maxwell’s Kinnerton, Street. home:

Q. Kate, in what:ncighborhood was this townhouse?

A. In the same neighborhood T lived in, in Belgravia.

Id. at. 11.77:5-6.

The 1996 Agreement proves that Kate’s:testimony’ is: not accurate:

Confronted with proof that, Kate did. not tell the truth, the government-asks this Court to
‘preclude Ms. Maxwell from offering the 1996 Agreement ‘into evidence on the theory that,
because.Ms. Maxwell did not.disclose the 1996 Agreement carlicr, the government:was not able
to fully and fairly investigate its case. Goy. ‘Letter at 6. The government’s argument is

groundless."

' Itisalso tone-deaf, considering the government's pattern and practice of discovering
evidence in dead. of night, just hours before witnesses testify. Some examples:

© The:government first disclosed:Kate’s driver’s ‘license at 11:11 p.m. the night before
she testified.
