Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 644 _ Filed 03/11/22 Page 23 of 32

The government, fails to distinguish Wnited States v. Torres, 128 F.3d 38 (2d.Cir. 1997).
The government admits the case: is analogous because'the juror in 7orres engaged, in conduct.
similar to that charged against the defendant, while here Juror.No. 50 was the victim of conduct
‘similar to that. charged. against Ms. Maxwell. The best-the: government can muster is:to' say that
this. Court’ has discretion—“ample diserction,” says the government—to chart a different path,
here. But the government doesn’t offer amy-reason, why: this Court’s discretion should.not be
guided. bythe Second Circuit’s reasoning in. 70rres. And that’s because there’s no good reason, to
treat: the two cases. differently—indeed, for. all the reasons given, the case for inferred bias:here is:
stronger than in ‘Torres.

Finally, the government’s argument here is directly contrary to'the argument it madé in
opposition to the new trial motion. in Daugerdas. In. that case, the: government argued. that'the
defendants were ‘not entitled to a new trial, in part because the juror did not “conecal personal.
background material so analogous to, the case on trial, that bias was implicd as a matter of law.”
