and the extraction of metadata as, His, expert testimony,

have provided thus far exactly what Mr. Flatley's testimony is
going to be.

fact witness; but the line between. a fact witness in a setting

like this and someone testifying on the basi's of their

expertise is not well. settled, and so we've given expert notice
