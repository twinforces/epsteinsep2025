testing. Recently she has manifested symptoms of depression and trauma such as
anxiety, and minor cognitive deficits. These continue to be exacerbated by ongoing
sleep deprivation and the conditions of her confinement. Given my extensive
experience working with incarcerated individuals, based on the manner in which
Ms. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are in no
way related to the charges that have been brought against her. Instead they are
directly related to the conditions of her confinement.

The conditions of her confinement are, in my opinion, directly influencing her

increasing depression and trauma response symptoms, which will continue to

worsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions.
Exhibit J.
Pre-Sentence Detention Was Discriminatory

In this case, the conditions of detention for Ms. Maxwell were evidently discriminatory.
Considering her profile — her age, lack of violence or threat of danger to herself and others- the
brutality of her detention regime was completely unwarranted. The fact that she was subjected to
an anti-suicide surveillance regime even though she has no suicidal tendencies demonstrates that
she was being treated differently, without any objective justification. Following the verdict, and
in the presence of two officers, an MDC psychologist told Ms. Maxwell she was being placed on
suicide watch. The psychologist stated she had opposed placing Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch
because Ms. Maxwell did not then and never had presented any suicidal indications. However,
the psychologist’s professional opinion was overruled per directives from Washington, DC.
Isolated from all inmates and denied social visits due to COVID restrictions, her only
human contact was with the staff that controlled her, except when COVID restrictions for counsel
visits were lifted. As such, prison personnel were her primary source of MDC/BOP related
information, and she often received misinformation, i.e., the date by which she must file an
administrative remedy.
