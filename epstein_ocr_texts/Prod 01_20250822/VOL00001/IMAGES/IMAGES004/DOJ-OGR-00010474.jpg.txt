testing. Recently she has manifested. symptoms of depression'and trauma such, as.
anxiety, and. minor cognitive deficits. These continuc to be exacerbated by ongoing’
slécp deprivation. arid, the conditions of her confinement. Given my exténsive
expcricnee working with. incarcerated individuals, based..on the: manner in which.
Ms. Maxwell’s symptoms have: manifest, it. is ‘clear that: her symptoms arc in no
way related fo the charges that, have been brought against her. Instead. they’ are

Pre-Sentence Detention Was Discriminatory
In this case, the conditions, of detention for Ms..Maxwell were evidently discriminatory.
Considering her profile — her age, lack. of violence or threat ‘of danger. to herself and. others- the:

‘in. the presence: of two officers, an: MDC psychologist-told Ms. Maxwell she was being placed, on.
Suicide Watch. The psychologist stated. she had, opposed ‘placing, Ms. Maxwell on suicide. watch.

the :psychologist’s professional opinion was overruled per directives from Washington, DC.
Isolated. from all. inmates: and denicd social visits duc to COVID' restrictions, -her. only
human contact.was with the staff that controlled, her, except;when COVID restrictions for counsel
‘visits ‘Were lifted. As such, prison personnel were her primary source of MDC/BOP related,
‘information, and. she: often ‘received misinformation, i.¢., the date by which she must file an.

administrative remedy.
