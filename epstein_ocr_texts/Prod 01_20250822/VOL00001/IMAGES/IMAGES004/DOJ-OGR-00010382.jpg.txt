overturn any: of the factual findings made by the jury” —it means only that, “as a:matter of law,
the jury found the same thing twice” Ansaldi, 372 F.3d at 125. Or, in.this case, three. times.
Il. The Court:denies the Defendant’s Rule.29 :motion.

The Defendant argues there was insufficient evidenec to'support any of her’five counts of
conviction, and, therefore, the Court should enter a judgment of acquittal as to.all eounts under
Rule: 29 of the Federal, Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule!29 provides, in relevant part, that
“(a]fter the government: closes its evidence’ or after’the: close of all the evidence, the court. on. the:
defendant’s motion must enter a judgment:of acquittal of any offense for-‘which the evidence ‘is
insufficient to sustain a conviction.” Fed. R. Crim.'P. 29(a); United States y. Pugh, 945 F.3d.9,
19 (2d Cir. 2019). “[T]he critical: inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support
a.criminal. conviction must be . . . to determine whether. the record. evidence: could reasonably
support a finding of guilt beyond ‘a:reasonable doubt.” Jackson 'v: Virginia, 443. U.S. 307, 318
(1979). “The court must make. that determination with the evidence against a particular
defendant, viewed. in the light most favorable to the government, and with all reasonable
inferences resolved in, favor'of the government.” Pugh, 945 F.3d at 19 (cleaned up) (quoting
Eppolito, $43 F.3d at 45). Under this inquiry, “the relevant question is: whether, after viewing
the evidence in the light. most. favorable to the prosccution, any rational trier of fact:could have
found the essential. elements of the crime beyond a:reasonable doubt.” Jackson, 443 US. at.319
(citing Johnson-v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356, 362 (1.972)); United States v. Zhong, 26-F.4th'536,
560 (2d Cir: 2022).

At the closé of the Governments, case, the Defendant made her Rule 29 application. “with
respect to: every ‘count in the $2 indictment,” but “confine[d] [her] comments to address:

specifically Counts, One and Two.” Trial Tr: at 2266. The Court denied the motion. /d. at.2274.
