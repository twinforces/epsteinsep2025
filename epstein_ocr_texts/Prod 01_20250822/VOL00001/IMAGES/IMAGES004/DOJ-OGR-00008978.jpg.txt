PLEASE TAKE NOTICE that Applicant in Intervention, Juror 50 (“Applicant”), hereby
moves the Court to grant him the right to intervene in the above-captioned case for the purpose of
defending his significant and threatened privacy interests regarding his experience(s) as a survivor
of past sexual assault.

On January 5, 2022, this Court ordered the parties to submit briefs in which each shall
“address whether an inquiry of some kind is permitted and/or required, and, if so, the nature of
such an inquiry”. Order. 1. Jan. 5, 2022. 20-CR-330. The Court further ordered that “If counsel for
the juror wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry, briefing by the juror's
counsel may be filed by January 26, 2022.” Order. 1. Jan. 5, 2022. 20-CR-330.

As this Court has already set forth a briefing schedule in this matter, Applicant agrees to
follow the briefing schedule as directed by the Court, should the instant motion allowing him to
intervene be granted.

As another preliminary matter, Juror 50 seeks to have copies of his Jury Questionnaire and
the transcript of his voir dire released under seal to his counsel, the Prosecution, and Defense
