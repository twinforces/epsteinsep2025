the diagnoses in Dr. Hall’s report are adequately tied to Alleged Victim 4’s credibility as a
witness. See Hamlett, 2021 WL 5105861, at *2.

Even if any diagnosis were probative, the Court further finds that Rule 403 prejudice
outweighs. First, the testimony may confuse jurors with old diagnoses that have little connection
to the conduct at issue or Alleged Victim 4’s credibility today. See id. Confusion is particularly
likely here given that Dr. Hall’s report is at times unclear and even contradictory, as with the
confusion ov i explained above. /d. Second, the Court takes account of the risk
that jurors will stereotype a witness vi) ii _ or incorrectly assume that a
diagnosed mental condition renders the witness untrustworthy. See Hernandez, 2011 WL

The Court concludes that here, the cross-examination identified by the Government on Alleged
Victim 4’s current medication for ae. along with lines of cross-examination
unrelated to mental health, will provide the jury a sufficiently “discriminating appraisal” of
Alleged Victim 4’s credibility such that Dr. Hall’s testimony and report is unnecessary. Drake v.
