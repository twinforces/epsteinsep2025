the diagnoses in Dr. Hall’s report are adequately tied to Alleged’ Victim 4’s credibility as a
witness. .Sée Hamlett, 2021, WL 5105861, at: *2.

Even.if any diagnosis were probative, the Court further finds that-Rule 403 prejudice:
outweighs. First, the testimony may confuse jurors with, old diagnoses that-have little connection,
tothe coriduct at issue or Alleged Victim 4’s credibility today. Sce id. Confusion is particularly
likely here given that Dr. ‘Hall’s report is at:times unclear and even, contradictory; as: with, the
confusionovef explained above. /d.. Second, the:Court takes account: of the risk:

that.jurors will. stercotype a witness with[ or. incorrectly: assume:that a

diagnosed mental condition, renders the witness untrustworthy. See Hernandez, 2011 WL

211.7611, at *5. Third, ‘mental health diagnoses aré of a particularly sensitive nature and, if not

testimony: Vitale, 459 F.3d.at-196; Dupree, 833 F. Supp. 2d.at.265 (applying Vitale.and Sasso).
The‘Court coneludes that here, 'the cross-examination identified by the Government. on Alleged.
Victiin 4’s current:medication for [d. along with lines of cross-cxaminationi
unrelated to mental health, will provide the-jury a.sufficiently “discriminating appraisal” of.

Alleged Victim.4’s credibility such that Dr. Hall’s testimony and report: is unnecessary. Drake. \.
