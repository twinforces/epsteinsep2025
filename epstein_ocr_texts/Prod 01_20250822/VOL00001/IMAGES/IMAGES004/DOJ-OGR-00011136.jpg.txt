investigation are all irrelevant” to Ms. Maxwell’s guilt. Ji. at, 19 (quoting United States v.
Diinéan, No. ‘18-CR-289, 2019 WL 2210663.(S.D.N.Y. 2019)). The Court concludes thatthe
expected topics.of Gershman’s testimony—investigation, witness preparation, media contact,
being neutral, and accurate, and relationships with, vietims—all ‘fall within the rubric of ‘attacking’
the thoroughness of the investigation rather than, being probative of Ms. Maxwell’s guiltof the
crimes charged. In, short, this testimony would run afoul, of the instruction that the jury’ will

The Court notes that,a court in, this district‘recently excluded Gershman’s testimony ‘in. a
civil ease in which. he would have similarly. criticized the SEC@’s investigation, including the'use
of cooperating witnesses. SC v. Collector’s Coffeetnc.,.No. 19-CV-4355 (VM) (GWG), 2021
WE 3418829 (S.D.N.Y. Aug: 5,202.1). That case differs ‘from this one:in. several, respeets, but
that court’s basie reasoning informs and supports:the. Court’s deeision-here.

The ‘Defense argues that the Court “expressly denied” prohibiting the’Defense from
calling an expert: witness like Gershman. Def. Br. at ‘17. Tellingly., the Defense quotes no
language from the Court for this proposition.and instead :cites only those pages of the Court’s
government’s witnesses.” Nov. | Tr. at 27. This language in ‘no fashion supports the Defensé’s
request to admit an.cxpert'to testify about government investigative techniques. The Court
reiterates, however, that it will permit the Defense to’pursue “lines of cross-cxamination of
government’ witnesses [that] would be relevant'to impeach a Witness by suggesting bias or
‘otherwise implicating their, credibility,” which,could include the Defense’s theory of witnesses’

motives for'‘implicating Ms. Maxwell after Jeffrey Epstein’s death.” Jd. at'28=29.
