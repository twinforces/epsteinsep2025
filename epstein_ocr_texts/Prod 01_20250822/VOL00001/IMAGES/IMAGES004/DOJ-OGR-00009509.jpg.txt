As a broker, David had 30 to 40 long-term customers, and his goal was to assist
them to invest their money wisely. A former business associate writes this about him:
[A]t the Chicago offices of Credit Suisse First Boston ...I
interacted with David on a constant basis during our tenure at the
firm. | literally could overhear his phone calls with clients .... In
all of [our] interactions I found David to be diligent, intelligent,
and most of all honest. David always put his client’s interests first,
and prided himself on his ability to protect [their] assets. He took
very seriously his fiduciary duty, and our entire group relied upon
him as a sounding board when evaluating the appropriateness of
investment vehicles. As an example of how much I trust David in
business, years ago I asked him to consult on the endowment fund
for an inner city high school that I oversee .... [As] you can
imagine ...I would only ask David to participate if I was
completely convinced of his character.
Letter of Phil Allen.
Others who have worked with David sound the same theme. See letter of Jeftrey
DeYoung (he would “always put clients first and do the right thing; when the market was starting
to unravel .. . Dave was the first to pull his clients out in spite of his loss of revenue”); letter of
Susan Manske (“[i]n my opinion, Dave has always been a straight shooter, a conservative
investor protecting his clients from downside risk, [and] a staunch supporter of ethical
behavior”); letter of John and Kathryne McGuire (“David chose the securities business so that he
could help his clients protect their assets; he truly understood his fiduciary obligations and [put]
his client’s interest first”). In all his years as a broker, David received no complaints from his
customers for his investment advice.’
. David has been sued by several taxpayers whose tax shelters were disallowed.
