Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (VSB)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter regarding the deadline for the filing of the
Presentence Investigation Report (“PSR”). The Government is informed that the Probation Office
will complete the draft PSR on May 24, 2022, and the revised PSR on June 21, 2022, in advance
of sentencing on June 28, 2022. Pursuant to Rule 8A of the Court’s individual practices, the
defendant’s sentencing submission is due one week in advance of sentencing, on June 21, and the
Government’s submission is due three days in advance of sentencing, on June 25.

Accordingly, the defendant’s submission is due the same day as the revised PSR, and the
Government’s submission is due days later, providing the parties insufficient time to incorporate
Probation’s revised views into their sentencing submissions. The Government therefore
respectfully requests that the Court direct the Probation Office to complete the revised PSR no
