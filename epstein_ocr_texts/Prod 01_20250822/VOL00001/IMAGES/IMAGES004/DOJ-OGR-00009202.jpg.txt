Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 616 Filed 02/24/22 Page 12 of 32

Ms. Maxwell is not:required to show prejudice, nor must the Court have “areal -concern,that.an
innocent person: may have been convicted” before. a new trial is required. The government’s
contrary contention. is specious.*

The government next invokes cases in which appellate courts have purported to view new
trial motions With “disfavor.” Resp. at 11. These cases, wari the government, counsel against
“inquiries into. juror conduct.” Jd. Quoting Janner v, United States, the government says:
“Allegations of juror misconduct, incompetency, or inattentiveness, raised. for the first time.» -
after the verdict, scriously disrupt the finality of'the:process. Morcover, full. and frank discussion.
in the jury“room, jurors” willingness to ‘return an-unpopular verdict, and.the community’s trust.in
a system. that.relics on the decisions of laypeople would all be undermined by a barrage of post-
verdict scrutiny of juror conduct.” /d. (quoting ./anner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107, 120-21
(1987)). The government also quotes the Sceond'Circuit’s decision in. United States y. Janniello,
in;which, the, Court. said that “post-verdict inquiries, may lead to-evil consequences: subjecting
jurics to harassment, inhibiting juryroom deliberation, burdening, courts'with meritless
applications, increasing temptation for jury tampering and creating uncertainty“in jury verdicts.”

866 F.2d 540, 534 (2d Cir. 1989).

3 The government draws the “teal concern” language ‘from cases, addressing new trial,
motions: based on.the conduct of the trial. itself—e:g., the: admissibility ortruthfulness of
testimony of witnesses, MeCourty, 562. F.3d.at.475, or the quality and. sufficiency of the
evidence, /erguson, 246 F.3d,at:134.

The eases cited bythe. government do not.addiress. the fundamental right to ‘trial by an.
impartial jury, and they:do not undermine the blackletter law that “[a]mong those basic fair trial
rights that ‘can never be treated. as ‘harmless’ is a-defendant’s ‘right:to an, impartial, adjudicator,
be it, judge or jury.” Gomez v. United States, 490 U'S. 858, 876 (1989) (quoting Gray v.
Mississippi, 481. U.S.648, 668 (1987).
