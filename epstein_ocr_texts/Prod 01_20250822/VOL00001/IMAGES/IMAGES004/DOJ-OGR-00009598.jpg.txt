Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document621 Filed 02/25/22 Page 36of51

The Second Circuit standard for pre-indictment delay imposes a heavy burden on the
defendant to show “both that the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an
improper purpose and that the delay seriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the
charges.” (Dkt. No. 207 at 17 (citing Cornielle, 171 F.3d at 752)). The burden for proving both
prongs of the standard rests squarely on the defendant. United States v. Scarpa, 913 F.2d 993,
1014 (2d Cir. 1990); United States v. Rubin, 609 F.2d 51, 66 (2d Cir. 1979); United States v. Ricco,
549 F.2d 264, 272 (2d Cir. 1977). The burden is so heavy that it is rarely met by a defendant. See
DeMichele v. Greenburgh Centr. Sch. Dist. No. 7, 167 F.3d 784, 790-91 (2d Cir. 1999) (“[W]hile
the [Supreme] Court may not have shut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due
Process Clause forecloses prosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely
ajar.”).

Substantial prejudice is just that—substantial, actual, non-speculative prejudice. See
United States v. Birney, 686 F.2d 102, 105-06 (2d Cir. 1982) (a defendant’s “proof of prejudice
must be definite and not speculative”); see also United States v. Henderson, 337 F.3d 914, 920
(7th Cir. 2003) (prejudice sufficient to warrant dismissal for pre-indictment delay must be “actual
and substantial” and “specific, concrete, and supported by evidence”). Prejudice in this context
refers to “actual prejudice to the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” United States v. Elsbery, 602
F.2d 1054, 1059 (2d Cir. 1979). It is well-established that the mere loss of evidence or of
witnesses, by death or otherwise, without more, is insufficient. See, e.g., United States v. Snyder,
668 F.2d 686, 689 (2d Cir. 1982) (death of a defense witness three years before indictment
insufficient prejudice); United States v. King, 560 F.2d 122, 130-31 (2d Cir. 1977) (death of
