Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 616 Filed 02/24/22 Page 21 of 32

D.. If Juror No. 50 had truthfully answered Questions 25 and 48, the: ;
correct responses. would have provided a valid. basis for.a challenge for
cause.

It:is both unnecessary’ and. premature for this Court'to consider'whcther Juror No. 50 was:
actually’ biased.

It’s unnecessary because any bias is sufficient.to require a.néw trial, and here the récord
shows that Juror No. 50 was both implicdly and :inferably biased. Because Juror.No. 50. was
impliedly and inferably biased, a new trial is required. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at:3.1.6. And.
it’s. premature because the actual. bias inquiry depends in. part onthe, statements. a prospective
juror makes during ‘voir dire, United States v.lorres, 128 F .3d.38, 43.(2d Cir, 1.997) (“A juror is
found by. the judge’ to be partial cither because the juror admits partiality; or the judge finds
actual-partiality based-upon the juror’s voir dire answers.”). Here, Juror No. 50 hasn’t had.to
answers the questions that would have been posed to him if he had.answered. Questions 25: and.
48 truthfully. Only a hearing—if this Court orders one—will-permit the Court: and parties to
evaluate: actual partiality.

The government here, attempts to raise the’bar for relicf, just as it did sin, Vnited States v.
Daugerdas: “The Government urges this Court'to adopt.a narrow reading of McDonough
‘unsupported by law. But :contrary’to the Government’s contention, the test:is not whether the true
facts‘would. compel, the Court; to, remove.a.juror for cause, but rather whether a truthful response.
‘would-have provided a valid basis for a challenge. for cause.’” United States-v. Daugerdas, 867
F. Supp. 24.445, 468 (S.D.N.Y.. 2012) (ordering new trial for two of three defendants’based.on
juror providing falsé answers during'voir:dire and concluding: that.the'third defendant waived the
new trial. argument), vacated and:remanded sub nom. United States v.. Parse, 789 F.3d.83 (2d,

Cir. 2015) (reversing district court’s waiver conelusion) (quoting MeDonough, 464'U.S. at 556).
