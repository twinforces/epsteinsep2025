those experiences would interfere with their ability to be fair and impartial.

At the conclusion of voir dire, the Court qualified 58 jurors. Nov. 18, 2021 Tr. at 717. Of
the 58 individuals who were qualified to serve as jurors, eight individuals responded to Question
48 of the juror questionnaire that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual
abuse, or sexual assault, and that this experience would not affect their ability to serve fairly and
impartially as a juror in the case.” In particular:

e Juror 8 answered Question 48 in the affirmative. During voir dire, Juror 8 stated that she
and other women she knows have experienced sexual harassment, but that neither she nor
anyone she knows has been the victim of “serious sexual harassment or assault or abuse.”

Juror 8 for cause.

also reported that a friend of hers was sexually harassed and coerced into a sexual
relationship with his professor. Juror 21 indicated that these experiences would not affect
her ability to be fair and impartial?

In response to additional questioning, she explained that she had reported to her school
that her friend was “coerced into a sexual relationship with their professor, kind of
blackmailed into it, and then paid off by the school to keep it quiet.” Jd. at 54:6-12. She
reiterated that this would not affect her ability to serve as a juror. Jd. Defense counsel
requested that the Court inquire further into whether Juror 21’s role in the reporting would
“color her views.” Jd. at 56:8-11. In response, the Court inquired whether Juror 21’s ability
to be fair and impartial would be affected “[t]o the extent there may be issues in the case
that arise around reporting or not reporting allegations related to sexual abuse or
harassment or the like,” to which Juror 21 responded no. Neither the Government nor
defense counsel challenged Juror 21 for cause.
