enhancements that were applied. in the PSR, the recommended sentencing range-under the.2003
Guidelines would be roughly 75% /ess than. the recommended sentencing range under'the 2004.
Guidclincs: 168-210 months based on a Combined. Adjusted Offense Level of 35 under the: 2003
Guidelines versus 292-365 months based on a Combined Adjusted Offense Level of:40 under
the 2004 Guidelines.” The partics dispute, however, whether'the offense conduct ended before
‘or after November 1, 2004, and-whether a.court or a jury must.make that:finding. See USSG §
