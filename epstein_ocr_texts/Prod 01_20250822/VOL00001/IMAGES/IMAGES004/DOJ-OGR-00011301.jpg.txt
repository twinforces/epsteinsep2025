theory of Bovino’s relevance since mid-October, when the Government produced its 3500
material. Yet the defendant did not subpoena Bovino until November 30, 2021. And as the
defendant admits, she has not been in contact with Bovino since the service of the subpoena, two
and a half weeks ago.

The Government rested on Friday, November 10, 2021, as it had previewed for several
days prior. Following that time, the defendant had five days without trial during which to prepare
the defense case-in-chief. On the day the Government rested, the defendant suggested that the
defense case would last only a few days, and as recently as yesterday, the defendant suggested that
she would rest today, but for one witness who might carry over to Monday. Tr. 2534.

It was not until this morning that the defendant brought Bovino’s apparent noncompliance

principle applies with full force where a defendant belatedly seeks to compel a witness to attend
trial. In United States v. King, 762 F.2d 232, 235 (2d Cir. 1985), superseded by statute on other
grounds as stated in United States v. Khatami, 280 F.3d 907, 912 (9th Cir. 2002), the Circuit
affirmed a district court’s denial of a motion to continue so that an incarcerated witness could be
produced. The defendant waited until two days before trial to seek production of the witness, and
the Circuit ruled that “any detriment suffered by [the defendant] resulted from his own dilatory
conduct and not from the court’s ruling.” Jd. at 235. “Such tactics provide no basis for a ruling
