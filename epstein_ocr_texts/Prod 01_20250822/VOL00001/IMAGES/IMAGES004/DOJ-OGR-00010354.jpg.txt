be-selected. The Court finds Juror 50’s testimony'to be credible, forthright, arid responsive: and
docs not find.as a. factual matter that. Juror 50 deliberately lied in order to be sclected.as a juror.

The Defendant’s reliance on,Sampson.v. United. States, 724 F.3d 1:50 (1st Cir. 2013), is
similarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 11. There, a juror failed to. diselose'that.
her husband had‘previously threatened her with.a shotgun during jury selection, for a’ bank
robbery.case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. However, the juror
had told a“litany of lics” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her
daughter’s incarceration and her own substance abuse ‘issues. /d. at.161-62, 168. By contrast,
Juror 50’s inadvertent: nondisclosure, while. implicating, multiple questions on the questionnaire,
stems only from-his ‘experience of. sexual abuse.

Second, the Defendant contends that Juror 50. was biased duc to 'the “similarities between
[his] personal experiences . . ..and the issues. being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 30 (quoting
Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d.at.472). She:expressly disavows arguing “that every person who‘has
been.a victim.of sexual, assault or sexual abuse was subject to.a ‘mandatory’ challenge for:causc:
based on implicd. bias.” Maxwell Reply at 17. Distancing from that position ‘is necessary—
again, it is not the law that an ‘individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and
impartial juror. Rather, the Defendant. finessés the argument by saying that Juror.50’s personal
history is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial.so as to warrant.a mandatory finding, of implicd
bias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of:inferred, bias, and,points to Juror 50’s testimony
and post-trial statements’ as, cvidenec that these. purported, similaritics made him. biased. Maxwell
