i A. There was no question that he did investigative work in the

3 But he did no work pertaining to Juror No. 1 until we received
4 the letter,

5 Q. Is it your claim that the Nardello firm's work was

6 identified in your brief?

t A. I think so. I think what our brief says is we hired a

8 private investigator. It lays out the materials that we

3 gathered.

10 Q. You didn't see fit to tell Judge Pauley on the conference
cL! call, by the way, we had this investigative firm?
i Be A. Iwas involved. I really think it was in the brief. I
13 could be mistaken, but I think it was in the brief. The
14 question was, who are your jury consultants, which is what Mr.
15 Schoeman and I were trying to respond to.
16 QO. The judge says he's trying to understand who was involved.
a He didn't say which jury consultants. He was trying to
18 understand who was involved. Natdello was involved, correct?
19 MR. GAIR: I'm going to object te the compound form of
20 the question.
21 THE COURT: Sustained.
22 Q. You knew Nardello had done jury research, correct? It's a
23 very simple yes or no,
24 A. That is certainly so.
25 Q. It's a very simple question.
