that create teachings moments about the importance of safeguarding rights that not only affect

8. The Supreme Court has taught that the approach followed by this Court in this
high-profile case of using a juror questionnaire and following up with voir dire can be highly
effective. See Skilling v. United States, 561 U.S. 358, 384 (2010) (“Although the widespread
community impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of prospective jurors’
connections to Enron, the extensive screening questionnaire and follow up voir dire were well
suited to that task.”) But the success of this approach in weeding out juror bias presupposes that
jurors will answer the questions posed by the Court honestly and accurately. Because this Court’s
decision on how to proceed will have far-ranging implications for other cases in which questions
conceming the accuracy of a juror’s answers arises, NACDL would like to share its suggestions
and concerns with the Court for how to devise a fair framework for addressing and deciding this
issue.
