Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670 _ Filed 06/22/22 Page51of55
between the defendant’s prior life and the life of an inmate may feel extreme to the defendant, but
when compared to the experiences of other pretrial detainees in this District, her experience is by
no means so shocking as to merit a downward variance.

If anything, the defendant’s privilege remained intact while at the MDC, as demonstrated
by the exceptional benefits she received. No other inmate received the kind of access to discovery
and to counsel that the defendant did. The defendant had her own shower, her own television, her
own desktop computer, her own laptop, and her own space to spend the day outside of her cell.
The defendant was able to get any concerns, no matter how small, immediately brought to the
attention of MDC legal counsel through her attorneys. Comparing that treatment to SAMS is out
of touch with reality. In many respects, the defendant’s conditions of confinement were
preferential and more beneficial than those experienced by other inmates.

Tellingly, the defendant’s complaints about the MDC seem internally inconsistent. On the
one hand, she complains that she was removed from general population. On the other hand, she
claims that she should not have been moved abruptly into general population after the conclusion
of her trial.? On the one hand, she claims that she would have had more freedom in general
population. On the other hand, she asks the Court for a lesser sentence because the general
population lost visitation and was locked into their cells for excessive periods because of COVID-
19. On the one hand, she complains that a camera was always on her. On the other hand, she
° The defendant also makes the sensational claim that she was the target of a “credible death
threat.” (Dkt. No. 663 at 7). The Government has conferred with legal counsel for the MDC and
has been informed that the MDC conducted an internal investigation of the purported threat and
determined the following: an inmate at the MDC remarked to someone in passing, in sum and
substance, “Id kill her if someone paid me a million dollars.”” Someone else overheard that remark
and reported it, resulting in the inmate being moved out of the housing unit. The MDC’s
investigation revealed that the inmate had not actually been paid to kill the defendant and had not
actually threatened Maxwell.
