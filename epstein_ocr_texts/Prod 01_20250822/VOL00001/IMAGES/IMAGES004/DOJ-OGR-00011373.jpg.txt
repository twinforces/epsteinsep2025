for, not: showing Jane, pictures of Eva, Michelle, ‘and Kelly. Nothing required Ms. Maxwell to do
that,.and the government cites no authority for its argument.

What’s more telling is that the government-never showed. Jane their photographs. The

argument—that the testimony of Eva, Michelle, and Kelly does not contradict-Jane’s
testimony—is wrong, as described ‘above.
