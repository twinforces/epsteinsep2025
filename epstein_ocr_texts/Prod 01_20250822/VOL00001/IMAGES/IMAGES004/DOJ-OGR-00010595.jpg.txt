The concept of “direct and proximate harm,” as used in the CVRA, is not limitless and only
covers victims of the conduct underlying the offenses of conviction. See United States v. Daly,
No. 3:11-cr-121 (AWT), 2012 WL 315409, at *5-*6 (D. Conn. Feb. 1, 2012) (“[T]he
determination as to whether person has the rights of a ‘crime victim’ for purposes the CVRA is
made with reference to the conduct underlying the charged offense.”) (emphasis added). While
individuals claiming to have been victims of sexual abuse may qualify generically as victims, all
sex crimes are not federal offenses and, as such, would be confer rights under the CVRA.

Accordingly, for the Individuals to be considered "victims," they must have been minors
and "directly and proximately" been harmed by the "commission" of the “federal crimes” for
which Ms. Maxwell has been convicted. Here, no such showing can be made for the Individuals.
The alleged abuse and injuries were not caused by Ms. Maxwell’s offenses of conviction: the
Individuals were not minors at the time of the federal offenses and their allegations are too
factually and temporally attenuated to the commission of the federal offenses.

As the Court instructed the jury, the age of the victim was an essential element for each
offense. The Individuals were not minors and are unable to demonstrate that their alleged abuse
and injuries were a consequence of the charged offenses against minors.

Because The Individuals Are Not "Crime Victims" Under the CVRA, They Should Be
Precluded from Being Heard at Sentencing

The right to be heard at sentencing applies only to persons who are statutory “crime
victims” of the offenses of conviction. The CVRA provides that where a person is a “crime
victim,” as defined in that statute, she has the right to be reasonably heard at sentencing. 18
U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4), § 3771 (e) (defining “crime victim”). While the sentencing court has
discretionary authority to receive information from a wider range of affected individuals
under 18 U.S.C. § 3661, only those holding statutory crime victim status have rights of
