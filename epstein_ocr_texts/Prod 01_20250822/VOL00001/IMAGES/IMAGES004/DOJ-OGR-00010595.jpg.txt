The concept. of “direct and‘proximate harm,” ‘as used in the CVRA, is, not limitless ‘and only.
‘covers victims of the conduct-underlying the offenses of conviction. See: Wnited States v. Daly,
No. 3:1 1-cr=121 (AWT), 2012 WL 315409, at *5-#6 (D. Conn. Feb. 1, 2012) (“[T]he
‘determination as to whether-person. has'the rights of.a “crime'victim’ for purposes the CVRA is
made with reference to the conduct underlying the charged offense.”) (emphasis added). While

offense. The. Individuals ‘were not minors and até unable'to demonstrate that their alleged abuse
and injuries were a ‘consequence of the charged offenses against minors.

Precluded from Being Heard at Sentencing

victims” of the offenses of conviction. The CVRA provides that where a person ‘is a “crime,
Victim,” as defined in that statute, she has the right'to, be reasonably heard.at. sentencing. 18
U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4), § 3771 (e) (defining “crime victim”). While the sentencing court has
