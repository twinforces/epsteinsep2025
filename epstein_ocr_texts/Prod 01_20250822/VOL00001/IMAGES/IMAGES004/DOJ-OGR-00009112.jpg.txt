to profit by writing books.* This has given rise to the so-called “stealth juror” who deliberately
lies or evades full disclosure of bias to get on a jury. In the O.J. Simpson trial, for example, five
jurors were dismissed for misstatements during voir dire, including “[o]ne juror [who] failed to
reveal that she had been a victim of spousal abuse, despite alleging six years earlier that her
husband had shoved her and forced her to have sex.’”*

The trial of a person accused of a heinous or notorious crime places great pressure on jurors
to convict to achieve personal acclaim for convicting a despised defendant or to avoid scorn for an
acquittal. Here, for example, Juror 50’s social media posts expressed appreciation for the
statements of gratitude he received for bravely telling his personal story of abuse and convicting
Ms. Maxwell. With so many advocacy groups demanding that victim witnesses be “believed,”
jurors may fear condemnation, or worse, if they acquit. Following the acquittal of the officers who
beat Rodney King, for example, riots took place in Los Angeles and jurors received death threats.°

To counter the heightened concern with juror bias in high-profile, sensational trials,
NACDL believes that courts must vigorously protect the integrity of this process on the front end,
through questionnaires and extensive voir dire, and on the back end by refusing to allow a
conviction where a juror, by his false answers to core questions relating to his ability to be fair,
has impaired the Court’s ability to exclude biased jurors from the panel.

Hung Jury: The Diary Of A Menendez Juror (2018); We, The Jury: Deciding The Scott Peterson
Case (2007) (book written by seven of Scott Peterson’s jurors); Madame Foreman: A Rush To
Judgment (1996) (book by three O.J. Simpson jurors, with interviews with five additional jurors);
The Private Diary Of An O.J. Juror: Behind The Scenes Of The Trial Of The Century (1995). The
Goodman book revealed that the juror lied to get onto the jury, which led to a new trial. See Joshua
