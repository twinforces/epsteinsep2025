A lawyer may also consider whether the prospective harm to the victim or victims is
imminent in deciding whether to disclose the information protected by section 6068,
subdivision (e)(1). However, the imminence of the harm is not a prerequisite to
disclosure and a lawyer may disclose the information protected by section 6068,
subdivision (e)(1) without waiting until immediately before the harm is likely to occur.
Whether to counsel client or third person* not to commit a criminal act reasonably* likely
to result in death or substantial* bodily harm
[7] Paragraph (c)(1) provides that before a lawyer may reveal information protected
by Business and Professions Code section 6068, subdivision (e)(1), the lawyer must, if
reasonable* under the circumstances, make a good faith effort to persuade the client
not to commit or to continue the criminal act, or to persuade the client to otherwise
pursue a course of conduct that will prevent the threatened death or substantial* bodily
harm, including persuading the client to take action to prevent a third person* from
committing or continuing a criminal act. If necessary, the client may be persuaded to do
both. The interests protected by such counseling are the client’s interests in limiting
disclosure of information protected by section 6068, subdivision (e) and in taking
responsible action to deal with situations attributable to the client. If a client, whether in
response to the lawyer’s counseling or otherwise, takes corrective action — such as by
ceasing the client’s own criminal act or by dissuading a third person* from committing or
continuing a criminal act before harm is caused — the option for permissive disclosure
by the lawyer would cease because the threat posed by the criminal act would no longer
be present. When the actor is a nonclient or when the act is deliberate or malicious, the
lawyer who contemplates making adverse disclosure of protected information may
reasonably* conclude that the compelling interests of the lawyer or others in their own
personal safety preclude personal contact with the actor. Before counseling an actor
who is a nonclient, the lawyer should, if reasonable* under the circumstances, first
advise the client of the lawyer’s intended course of action. If a client or another person*
has already acted but the intended harm has not yet occurred, the lawyer should
consider, if reasonable* under the circumstances, efforts to persuade the client or third
person* to warn the victim or consider other appropriate action to prevent the harm.
Even when the lawyer has concluded that paragraph (b) does not permit the lawyer to
reveal information protected by section 6068, subdivision (e)(1), the lawyer nevertheless
is permitted to counsel the client as to why it may be in the client’s best interest to
consent to the attorney’s disclosure of that information.
Disclosure of information protected by Business and Professions Code section 6068,
Subdivision (e)(1) must be no more than is reasonably* necessary to prevent the
criminal act
[8] Paragraph (d) requires that disclosure of information protected by Business and
Professions Code section 6068, subdivision (e) as permitted by paragraph (b), when
made, must be no more extensive than is necessary to prevent the criminal act.
Disclosure should allow access to the information to only those persons* who the lawyer
reasonably believes* can act to prevent the harm. Under some circumstances, a lawyer
may determine that the best course to pursue is to make an anonymous disclosure to
