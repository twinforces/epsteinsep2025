1 THE COURT: So, Ms. Menninger, with respect to

2 Saturday, if there's anything in the notice that's suggested

3 that your expert has different expert opinions on, please

4 provide notice. Otherwise we'll see how it plays out.

5 MS. MENNINGER: Of course. Thank you, your Honor.

6 THE COURT: And then LaPorte and Naso, I don't have

7 any sense, based on the disclosures, what evidence this will go
8 to, and the defense says that's because they don't know what

9 evidence the government will produce. What documents do you

10 imagine you would have these experts analyze?

11 MR. PAGLIUCA: JI think it's unlikely that they will

12 testify, your Honor. The only document that was potentially at
13 issue relates to Accuser No. 2. And I doubt that that -- I

14 doubt that that's going to become an issue during trial. We

15 endorsed them just out of an abundance of caution, and I don't
16 really see it playing out. But I think if it -- if it comes

17 up, if it becomes an issue, certainly I'll give as much notice
18 as I can. But I don't really think they're going to be

19 testifying at trial.
20 THE COURT: Good enough for me.
21 Mr. Rohrbach.
22 MR. ROHRBACH: I'd like to say it's good enough, your
23 Honor. The concern is that if the defense decides mid trial
24 that they would like to call these experts, it's going to
25 create a difficult situation for the government to file the
