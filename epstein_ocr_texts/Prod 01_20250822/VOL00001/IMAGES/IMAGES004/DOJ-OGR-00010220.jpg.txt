1 signed the proposed immunity order which will be docketed with
2 Juror 50's name redacted.

i) Juror 50, in view of your assertion of the Fifth

4 Amendment privilege, I have signed an order granting you

5 immunity. It is use immunity with respect to your testimony in
6 this proceeding. That means that no testimony given by you or
7 any information, directly or indirectly, derived from your

8 testimony may be used against you in a federal criminal case,

9 except if you testify falsely today you could be prosecuted for
10 perjury. In light of this immunity, you will be required to

11 answer questions today.

12 So in other words, you need to answer my questions

13 today. You need to answer truthfully. If you don't answer

14 truthfully, you could be prosecuted for perjury. But you will
15 not be prosecuted in federal court based on any truthful

16 testimony that you give here today, even if that testimony

17 indicated that you committed a crime.

18 Juror 50, do you understand that?

19 JUROR 50: Yes, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: All right. I am going to have Juror 50
21 come forward to the witness stand, please.
