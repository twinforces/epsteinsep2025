for cause, but also his peremptory challenges.” United States v. Barnes, 604 F.2d 121,
139 (2d Cir. 1979) (internal quotations and citations omitted). “A juror’s dishonesty
during voir dire undermines a defendant’s right to a fair trial.” Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp.
2d at 468; U.S. Const. amend. VI.

“TA] party alleging unfairness based on undisclosed juror bias must demonstrate
first, that the juror’s voir dire response was false and second, that the correct response
would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” United States v. Stewart,
433 F.3d 273, 303 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556).

A defendant need not demonstrate prejudice when a juror gives a false answer to a
material question during voir dire if the juror would have been subject to a challenge for

316 (2000) (the “seating of any juror who should have been dismissed for cause” “would
require reversal”). When a biased juror deliberates on a jury, structural error occurs, and a
new trial is required without a showing of actual prejudice. See Arizona v. Fulminante,
499 U.S. 279, 307-10 (1991).

B. An intentionally false answer during voir dire is not a prerequisite to

“Intentionally false” juror answers are not a prerequisite to a finding that a
defendant’s constitutional right to a fair and impartial jury have been violated.
McDonough, 464 U.S. at 553-56; id. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring); id. at 557-59
(Brennan, J., concurring in judgment). So long as a truthful answer would have subjected
the juror to a challenge for cause based on bias, an inadvertent false answer is just as
