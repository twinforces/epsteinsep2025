Yes, that's correct, ‘your Honor.

MR; EVERDELL: Paragraph three, your Honér?

FHE COURT: 23. I apologize.

MR; EVERDELL: Yes; your Honor.

THE COURT: I overrule the objection. The first

objection 15 regarding the conélusion that Ms. Maxwell was the

author of the essay in, the paragraph. I overrule the objection

bécause a reasonable inference supported by the trial evidence
is that the defendant authored the essay. Metadata indicated
that the computer was. registered to "GMax" and the document was
saved ‘under the user name "Ghislaine."

The sécond objection is to the assertion that Epstein
transferred Ms. Maxwell approximately $23. million during the
conspiracy. I overrule that objection. Bank statements
