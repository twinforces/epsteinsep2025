Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670 Filed 06/22/22 Page 33 of 55

The defendant’s argument to the contrary—that ‘her particular crime involved ‘undue
influence of:minors—does not demonstrate double-counting. The fact that the defendant’s course
‘of conduct triggers both the harm. targeted: by the: base offense: level and the -harm triggered by an.
enhaneement shows that the enhancement:applics, not that the enhancement.is redundant: with the:
base. offense. level.*

D. The Five-Level Enhancement.in Section 4B1;5 5 Applies:

Section 4B1.5 has two provisions, depending on whether a defendant has a ‘prior sex
offense conviction. Where, as here,,the defendant docs not have a’prior conviction, §-4B1.5(b)
adds five offense levels and sets‘a:‘minimum offense level of 22, so long as the defendant, satisfies
that section’s thrée requirements: (1) the offense of conviction must be a “covered sex. crime,” (b)
the defendant is ncither:a.career.offender nor. a repeat offender, and (c) the defendant “engaged in.
a. pattern of. activity involving prohibited sexual conduet?” Jd. § 4B1..1(b). “Prohibited sexual,
conduct,” in turn, covers any offense tinder Chapters.117, 109A, or 1:10, and any state law offense
that would be a:federal offense-under those chapters if committed.“within,the:special maritime and.
territorial jurisdiction of the United States.” 18 U.S.C. §'2426:(2003); sée U.S.S.G. § 4B 1.5 app.
n.4(A) (incorporating that definition);, see also, e.g.., United States v. Phillips, 43:1. F.3d 86,90 &

n.6 (2d.Cir. 2005) (applying these requirements).

3 The: defendant also argues that the enhancement docs not apply as to Jane and Annic ‘because,

under the: 2003. Guidelines, the undue influence must. occur with the object.of having the minor
engage in.a commercial sex'act. (Def. Mem. 2.1). As,cxplained above, the,2004 Guidclines:manual
applicés, and it contains no such ‘provision. In any. évéent; Jane testified, that she received. moncy’
during the course ‘of her abuse (Tr. 301-02), and Annic testified that-she'was promised a trip to
Thailand which she: ultimately received. (Tr. 2059, 2090-92). See ULS.S.G. § 2G. 1 app. n.J

(incorporating the definition of “commercial sex act” ‘in, 18 U.S.C. § 159 1(c)(1)); 18 U.S.C.

§ 1591(c)(1) (2000) (defining a “commereial. sex, act” ‘and “any sex act, on account of which,
anything of valuc:is given. to.or received. by any person”).
