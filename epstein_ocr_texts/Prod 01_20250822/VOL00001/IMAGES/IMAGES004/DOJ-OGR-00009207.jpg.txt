433 F.3d 273, 303 (2d Cir. 2006) (citing McDonough, 464 U.S. at.556). Ms. Maxwell need not.
‘prove a:deliberate: falschood. Jd.

The government all but ignores Stewart, relying.on United States 'v. Shaoul, 41.F 3d 81.1
(2d Cir. 1994), in.an effort to minimize Langford. The government’s invocation.of Shaoul, fails..

First, Shadul did not'reject the argument Ms. Maxwell makes. here. Nowhere in. Shaoidl
opinion concurring’ in judgment, which together’were supported. by. five justices. See. Shaoul, 41
F.3d at 815-17. This Court, should not read.Shaoul'to have rejected an argument it did not:even
consider.

Sccond, the language from. Shai! on which the govertiment rélics is di@nim. That’s
because:the Shaon! Court-held that the defendant could.not “satisfy the second. part of the
McDonough test—that the juror could have'been challenged for:cause.” /d: at: 8.1.6. The‘Court’s
discussion of deliberate-versus-inadvertent false answers thus was not necessary to Its,
‘conclusion, and this Court:is not’bound by it. Jama'y. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t, 543.U.S. 335,
352 n.12.(2005) (“Dictum settles nothing, even in the court. that. utters it.”).

Third, if the: government’s reading: of Shaoul'were correct, then Shaoul is inconsistent
with, Langford, not. to:mention McDonough. Because Langford. was decided first, and because
MeDonoiigh is a United States Supreme Court. opinion, this Court is bound by both and not by
Shaoul. Compare United States v. Wilkerson, 361 F.3d.7.17, 732 (2d Cir. 2004) (one panel of the
Court of Appeals is “bound. by the: decisions of prior pancls until such:time as they are overruled.
cither by an cn. bane pancl of our Court’ or by the Supreme Court”), withdndep. Cmty. Bankers of
Am. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed, Rsrv. Sys., 195.F 3d 28, 34 (D.C. Cir, 1.999) (“In,the event of,

conflicting pancl opinions .... . the earlier onc controls, as, one ‘pancl of this, court may°not overrule
