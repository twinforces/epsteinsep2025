M3 8TMAX1

1 THE COURT: I will ask the question how does he

2 reconcile the statement that he didn't think anyone would know

3 with the fact that he was posting on social media.

4 MR. EVERDELL: I think we also need some follow-up

a questions that we proposed in our letter about his belief about

6 victim memory, because I think that goes to his ability to

7 evaluate the evidence fairly and impartially.

8 THE COURT: I will deny that.

9 MR. EVERDELL: I believe also he said in his answers
10 that he didn't hope to be on the jury but if he is going to be
11 on a jury, it might as well be something interesting. I'm
12 paraphrasing, but that's the import of his comment. I think we
13 need some follow up about what he meant by that comment. Why
14 was it that he found this interesting? Was it some reflection
15 of the fact that it involved victims of sexual abuse, and
16 because he was the victim of sexual abuse himself that made it
17 interesting for him?

18 THE COURT: I will ask him what he meant.
19 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I may have an issue. I thought
20 the last question about following your instructions, I think he
21 said no. And insofar as saying no, how did he not follow your
22 instructions after he filled out the questionnaire?
23 THE COURT: Okay. I will ask that question and then I
24 will ask the government's question about whether he followed my
25 instructions during voir dire.
