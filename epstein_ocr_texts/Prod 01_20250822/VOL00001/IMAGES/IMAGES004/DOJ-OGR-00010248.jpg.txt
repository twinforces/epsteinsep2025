MR, EVERDELL; I think we also need some: follow-up

questions that. wé proposed in our letter about his belief about

victim memory, because I think. that gges to his ability to

évaltate the evidence fairly and impartially.
THE COURT: I will deny that.
MR. EVERDELL: 71 believe also he said in His, answers,

that he didn't. hope tq be on the jury but if he 1s going to be

on a jury, it might as wéll be something interesting. I'm
Panaphrasing, but ‘that's the import of his comment. I think we
need sorie, fOllow up about. what he meant by that cémrient. Why
was it that he found this intenesting? Was it some reflection
of the fact that it involved victims 6f sexual abuse, and
because he was the victim of sexual abuse himself that made it
interesting for him?

THE COURT: JI will ask ham what, he meant.

MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I may have an issue. I thought
the Last question about following ‘your ,instructions, I thank he
said no. Ahd insdfar as saying né6, how did he not follow your
instructions after he filled out the questionnaire?

THE GOURT: Okay: JI will ask that question and then I
