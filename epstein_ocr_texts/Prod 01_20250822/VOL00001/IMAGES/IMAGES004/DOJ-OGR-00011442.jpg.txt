In. any case, there ‘are several, reasons that concerns about confidentiality should:not
weigh heavily heré. First, the, EVCP imposes no confidentiality requirement on-the. accusers, who
are free'to discuss their submissions to and communications ‘with the:EVCP. Protocol, p 9
(“Individual claimants, are not. bound through the Program by: any. rules of confidentiality.”). In
turn, because. Ms. Maxwell.can compel her accusers to testify about their submissions to and
communications with the EVCP, see’U.S. Const. amend. VI, there is‘no reason fo prevent, Ms.
Maxwell from. subpocnaing the submissions and communications themselves. Again, Ms.
Maxwell is not required.to accept her accusers’ assurances that the story they are telling the jury
is the same they told to the EVCP.

Mote to the;point, the accusers have repeatedly exercised their freedom to discuss the
alleged abuse. Three of the four have: filed:public lawsuits against Mr. Epstcin and/or Ms.
Maxwell, and they’have' repeatedly publicized their claims. The accusers cannot; with.a. straight
face claim-this information is confidential. There’s: no putting the horse back ‘in the barn.
