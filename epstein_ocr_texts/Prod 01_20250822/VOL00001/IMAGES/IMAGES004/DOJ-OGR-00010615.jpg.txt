Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

I am counsel for Maria Farmer, and I am providing the following victim impact statement
for the Court’s consideration with respect to Maxwell’s sentencing.

Pursuant to the Crimes Victims’ Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771, Ms. Maria Farmer
qualifies as a victim as the Defendant participated in her trafficking in 1996. Due to a medical
issue, Ms. Farmer is unable to attend the sentencing in person, therefore she respectfully requests
that the Court read her statement into the record or, alternatively, allow her attorney representative
Sigrid McCawley to read the statement on her behalf.
