The CVRA Applies Only to Federal Crimes

Based on the text, origin and. limited legislative history, the CVRA. applies to victims of
federal crimes only. 18: U.S.C. § 3771(¢). The federal crimes of conviction require the:
involvement of minors. The Individuals claiming sexual abusé'who were not minors may
qualify gencrically as:victims of:scxual abuse: but not.as statutory victims of the federal offenses
of conviction.
The Individtials Are Not "Victims" of the. Counts of Conviction

Neither the: Superseding Indictment northe Court’s jury instructions support a position
that anyone who was'not a ‘minor is a "victim" of the counts of conviction. The involvement. of a
‘minor is an cssential clement. of the federal offense conduct. Maria. Farmer:claims she was
abused during the time period. of the indictment; however, she was not a ‘minor. Sarah Ransome
‘was not a:minor when she claims she interacted with Epstein and.Ms. Maxwell ‘from
approximately October 2006 to April 2007, a full two years after the conduct:in this case: ended.
‘Teresa.Helm also ‘was not.a minor and. it is:unknown, when. she claims ‘to have had, contact with
to: have had contact with Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. None of these Individuals testified. at trial
and their credibility. remains ‘unexamined. Regarding the charges in this case, they do not qualify’
as victims under the CVRA.
The Individuals Are Not "Victims" Within the Meaning of the CVRA.

For the Individuals to invoke the rights enumerated under the CVRA, they must. first be:
victim” as “‘a-person. directly and proximately harmed as, a result:of the commission of a./-ederal

offense or an. offense in the District:of Columbia.” 18'U.S.C. 3771 (c)(2)(A) (emphasis added).
