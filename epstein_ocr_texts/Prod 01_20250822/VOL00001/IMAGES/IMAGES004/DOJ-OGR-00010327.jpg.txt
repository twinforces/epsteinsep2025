I BACKGROUND
A. Jury Selection Process

The jury selection process in this case was designed to screen a sufficient number of
prospective jurors for the high-profile trial while also complying with the Southern District of
New York’s COVID-19 protocols and protecting the health and safety of prospective jurors,
court staff, and case participants during the unprecedented pandemic. Selection proceeded in
three stages: a written pre-screen questionnaire, one-on-one oral voir dire, and, finally, the
exercise of peremptory strikes. The Court developed the questionnaire and voir dire with input
from the parties. See Dkt. No. 367; see also Oct. 21, 2021 Tr., Dkt. No. 459. The questionnaire
was designed to pre-screen for “the major for-cause strike issues in the case”—that is, “the trial’s
length and schedule, a juror’s personal knowledge of the parties, [the] extent of a juror’s
awareness of publicity about the case and the defendant, and any bias due to publicity or as a
result of the nature of the charges.” Oct. 21, 2021 Tr. at 5. In-person voir dire would then focus
on appropriate follow-up questions based on questionnaire responses, additional questions more
appropriately asked orally, and background information to aid the parties’ exercise of informed
peremptory challenges. /d. at 7.

When prospective jurors arrived to complete the questionnaire, and when they returned
for voir dire, they watched videotaped instructions from this Court. The Court prepared those
instructions with the parties’ input. Dkt. Nos. 366, 404, 427. These instructions briefly
explained the jury selection process, explained the nature of the charges (using the same
language that the parties proposed for the jury questionnaire), and instructed jurors not to discuss
the case or consume any media about the case.
