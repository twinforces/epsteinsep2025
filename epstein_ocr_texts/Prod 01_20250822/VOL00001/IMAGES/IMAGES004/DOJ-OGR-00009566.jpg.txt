33(a).! “The defendant bears the burden of proving that he is entitled to a new trial under Rule
33[.]” United States v. McCourty, 562 F.3d 458, 475 (2d Cir. 2009). Because motions for a new

generally defer to the jury’s resolution of conflicting evidence and assessment of witness
credibility.” United States v. Landesman, 17 F 4th 298, 330 (2d Cir. 2021). The “ultimate test on
a Rule 33 motion is whether letting a guilty verdict stand would be a manifest injustice.” United
States v. Peters, 843 F. App’x 369, 374 (2d Cir. 2021) (quoting United States v. Ferguson, 246
F.3d 129, 134 (2d Cir. 2001)).

crimes charged in the Second Superseding Indictment (the “S2 Indictment” or “Indictment’’), and

that the Government therefore constructively amended Counts One, Three, and Four of the

Indictment. Not so. At all times—before trial, in its presentation of the evidence, at closing

argument, and in seeking jury instructions—the Government consistently argued that the
