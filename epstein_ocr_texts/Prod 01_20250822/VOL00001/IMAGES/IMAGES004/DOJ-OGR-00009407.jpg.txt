2 A. Wo, that's not accurate.
a Q. Didn't you tell us a few moments ago that you and Ms. Brune

6 your brief, yes or no?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. So are you saying, then, that you were not trying to convey
i) the notion through the facts section of your brief that you had

11 received the letter from the government?
12 A. No, we weren't trying to convey that impression.
13 MR. OKULA: May I have a moment, your Honor?
14 THE COURT: Take your time.
15 (Pause)
16 Q. Could you turn to Government Exhibit -- I'm sorry, it's
17 defense Exhibit PMD 54. Do you recognize that document?
18 A. Yes.
19 Q. What is it?
20 A. It's the brief that we submitted in support of the motion
21 for a new trial.
22 Q. Can you explain, why does your firm sign it twice? In
23 other words, why do you include it on the front page separate
24 and apart from Susan Brune in New York and you in San
25 Francisco?
