Further, in, both counts, the witnesscs testified. that. they received financial gifts and
‘payments as a micans by which the Defendant, and Epstein. acquired, their'victims’ trust.and
extended the period of sexual abuse. .£.g:, id. at. 302 (Janc testified that she:was given:moncy
“a]lmost every visit” and, that:Epstein paid for things like voice lessons.and clothes). The
Government emphasized such financial gifts as one step in:the. Defendant’s playbook of
grooming. L-g., id, at,285,], (“Then came the next step in the playbook: Making these girls feel,
special, giving them gifts, ‘making fricnds, giving them moncy; promising to help: with their:
futures, promises like sending Annie on.a trip to Thailand or helping to-pay: for Janc’s voice
lessons and.tuition.”), 2890 (“[Janc] told you that Epstein gave her'moncy and. gifts and paid for.

Defendant.

objective of the conspiracy. Was to, transport. minors to New’ York to engage in criminal sexual
activity in violation of. New York law. Count Five, by contrast, focused. on. Epstcin’s residence:
in. Florida, where Carolyn and Virginia Roberts were, paid to give Epstein 'scxualized massages.
Nevertheless, some geographic. overlap between the-two counts remained. All four witnesses
