Further, in both counts, the witnesses testified that they received financial gifts and
payments as a means by which the Defendant and Epstein acquired their victims’ trust and
extended the period of sexual abuse. F.g., id. at 302 (Jane testified that she was given money
“Ta|lmost every visit” and that Epstein paid for things like voice lessons and clothes). The
Government emphasized such financial gifts as one step in the Defendant’s playbook of
grooming. E.g., id. at 2851 (“Then came the next step in the playbook: Making these girls feel
special, giving them gifts, making friends, giving them money, promising to help with their
futures, promises like sending Annie on a trip to Thailand or helping to pay for Jane’s voice
lessons and tuition.”), 2890 (“[Jane] told you that Epstein gave her money and gifts and paid for
school. That money wasn’t free .... That is inducement, that is enticement, that is coercion.’’).
The financial quid pro quo may have become more explicit beginning in 2001, but that shift in
approach is not nearly so dramatic as to suggest that the Defendant and Epstein at that time
entered “a wholly new agreement” with a new “conspiratorial objective.” Haji v. Miller, 584 F.
Supp. 2d 498, 519 (E.D.N.Y. 2008). The similarity-of-operations factor therefore favors the
Defendant.

activity in violation of New York law. Count Five, by contrast, focused on Epstein’s residence
in Florida, where Carolyn and Virginia Roberts were paid to give Epstein sexualized massages.
Nevertheless, some geographic overlap between the two counts remained. All four witnesses
testified about sexual conduct by the Defendant or Epstein in locations other than New York,
whether Florida, New Mexico, or London. The Court admitted such testimony concerning
