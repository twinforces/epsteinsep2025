Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document643 Filed 03/11/22 Page 27 of 49

Keeping with that “narrow” vicw of implied. bias, the Sceond Circuit has ‘consistently’
refuséd to create a sct of unreasonably constricting ‘presumptions ‘that jurors. be excused for catise
‘due: to certain. occupational or other special relationships which. might bear directly or indirectly
on the circumstances of a given case, where... theres, no showing’ of actual ‘bias or prejudice.”
/orres, 128 F.3d. at 46 (quotations and. citations, omitted). For ¢xample, the Second Circuit has
declined to follow:a Ninth Circuit precedent stating that.it was error not'to excuse two bank:tellers
as jurors in.a bank robbery: case. United Siates, v. Brown,644 F.2d 1.01, 104-05 (2d Cir. 1981)
(declining to follow: United States v. Allsup, 566 F.2d 68 (9th Cir. 1977)); see. also.Mikus v.. United
Sfates, 433 F.2d:719, 724 (2d.Cir, 1970) (similar). And it has held.that.a.juror’s prior service ata.

see. also Curry v. Lynch, 323, PF. App’x 63, 65 (2d Cir. 2009) (rejecting argument that a juror had.
implied bias because he owned a printing business that did business with defense counsel).

circumstances of this:case. do:not fall within:the:narrow categories of'implicd bias that.the Second
Cireuit has ‘recognized. This is not, one of the rare, extreme circumstances where’ a. mandatory
‘presumption of bias may be applicd. See; ¢.g., /orres, 128 F.3d at 45; Greer, 285 F.3d at 172.

The defendant principally argues that implied. bias should. be found. based. on. alleged.
‘similaritics. between. the: personal expericnees of Juror ‘50 and the issues being litigated. (Def.
Mein. at 30-35). But'the Second Cireuit has not recognized this as a.proper basis to make a finditig
of mandatory, presumed bias. ‘Indeed, it has specifically: rejected such a-notion:

Just as we have refused to carve out an overly. broad category’ of
