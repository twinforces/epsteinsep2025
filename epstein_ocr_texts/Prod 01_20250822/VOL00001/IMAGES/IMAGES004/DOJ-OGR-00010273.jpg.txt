indicating that, it. is confused, “[i]t is the responsibility of the'trial judge to provide the jury with

sufficient instruction 'to enable it to assess the evidence within the proper Icgal framework and to
reach a. rational verdict”). The Court’s decision not todo so and. to refer'the:jurors. to the cxisting
jury instructions, which had. caused the confusion. in the first place, was erroncous and resulted.in,
a constructive amendment.and/or variance by permitting the jury to:convict Ms. Maxwell on the
United. States vi Millsivin, 40.1, F.3d 53, 65 (2d Cir..2005). (“When the trial, evidence or the jury
charge operates. to broaden the possible bases for conviction from that which. appeared in the
indictment, the indictment. has been, constructively amended.” (cleaned up)). Accordingly, the
Court should vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and, Four and. grant anew trial.

A. The Jury Note Indicated that the Jury Misunderstood the Intent
Requirement for Count Four.

The Court erred ‘when. it coricluded that that‘the Jury Note was “too difficult to parse” and.
declined to give:the jury'a supplemental. instruction. (Tr.:3126-40). In. fact, the text of the Jury
Note is. straightforward, and ‘indicates on its ‘face that the jurors. had an, incorreet understanding of
the intent requirement for Count Four that necded to be clarified ‘with a. supplemental instruction.

Under Count Four (4), ifthe defendant: aided in the transportation, of Jane’s ‘return

flight, but not the flight to. New Mexico where/if'the intent was for Jane-to engage

in-sexual activity, can she be found. guilty-under the second element?'

(Court Exhibit #15). ‘Stated slightly differently, but using the same ‘words that the jurors

theniselveés used, the question posed by the Jury Note was the following:

| The government contends that this.argumentiis “better, framed as‘a challenge:to-the:Court’s response to the jury
note:or'a challenge to the jury instructionsim the: form ofa constructive amendmient.argument.” (Opp..at 20). Itis
not‘clear'to the defense how’these arguments differ ineany material:respect from the one’ we are advancing:, For the
‘sake of-clarity, we are?claiming that the Court’s:response to the Jury Note was ‘erroneous and resulted in a
‘constructive amendment/variance.
