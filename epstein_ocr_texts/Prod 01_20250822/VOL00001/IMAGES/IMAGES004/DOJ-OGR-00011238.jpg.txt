Second, to the extent the defendant’s argument is rooted in more general concerns about
harassment, intimidation, or risks to employment, those concerns arise in different forms for a
large number of witnesses in this and any number of other cases. In this case, Government
witnesses testified about their association with the defendant and Epstein in their true names,
regardless of any feelings they may have had about their testimony. Those witnesses face the same
generalized risks of harassment and negative implications of association with this case in the public
eye as any defense witnesses. More broadly, this is hardly the first high-profile trial in this District,
or this country, yet the defendant has identified no analogous circumstance in which the
generalized concerns identified by the defendant justified the kind of anonymity order the
defendant seeks. And in any number of other cases, witnesses are reluctant to testify publicly in

Shawn. (Def. Letter at 7). That comparison is unfounded. Matt and Shawn’s identities were
