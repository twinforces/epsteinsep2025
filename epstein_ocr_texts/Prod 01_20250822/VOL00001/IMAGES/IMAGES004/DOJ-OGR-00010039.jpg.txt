1 convey. As I think I've already said, though, when I reflect

2 on the brief, I think we missed it. And it's something that I
a greatly regret, there is no question about that.

5 A. Yes, that's right.

6 Q. You participated on that call, correct?

8 Q. Indeed, the Court inquired of the defense counsel why he

9 was getting two different versions of the facts, correct?
10 A. Something along those lines, yes.
Ti Q. When you compare what you said in the culy 21st letter to
12 the facts as laid out in the brief, those are two very
13 different set of facts, correct?
14 A. I can't sort of say for sure what Judge Pauley was
15 thinking, but he certainly was conveying that he wanted to get
16 to the bottom of things and that he was not happy with us.
17 Q. That wasn't my question, Ms. Brune. My quéstion was, if
18 you compare the facts as they are laid out in your letter to
19 the facts as they are laid out in the brief, those are two very
20 different sets of facts, correct?
21 A. I doen't agree with you. I thought what you were asking me
22 to say was what Judge Pauley was thinking.
23 Q. No, that wasn't my question. Is it your testimony here,
24 Ms. Brune, that you did not find it a material fact, the things
25 that you uncovered prior to the return of the jury's verdict?
