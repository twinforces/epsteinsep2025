asking whether he had experienced sexual abuse, but-he ‘was certain that ‘he had answered all
questions honestly.” (/d. at 8). Juror 50 also told this:intervicwer that his.own.cxpericiice. of sexual,

* Pursuant. to Federal Rule, of Evidence 606(b), the foregoing recitation of Juror 50’s public
statements ¢xcludes any reference: to statements ‘that: Juror 50, made about what “occurred. during:
the jury’s deliberations; the cffect.of anything on that juror’s or another juror’ s'Vote; or any juror’s
mental. ‘processes concerning the: verdict: or indictment.” The defendants bricf, in. an. apparent.
attempt to show bias or prejudice, contains'a. recitation of certain of Juror 50’s statements about
what ‘happened during deliberations. (See Def: Mem. at 12-15). Those statements. are not:
admissible in these proceedings. See: Warger'v. Shatiers, 574 U.S. 40, 44 (2014). But the Court.
should.not be misled bythe defendant’s selective, presentation of Juror S0’s statéments, because a.
revicw of the full. interviews: reveals the: impartiality: with-which. he approached this. case and the:
care that the jury took:when, deliberating. For example, Juror 50 told. /he Independent that the jury:
“didn’t. sce cnough dircet evidence to convict on count. two” because “there just wasn’t any direct.
evidence for any’ specific’ trip that Maxwell 'took:any: action to entice Jane to get on those flights.”
(Gov't. Ex. A at.5). During that sdme interview, Juror 50 explained that he voted to convict the
‘defendant.on the remaining counts because “he believed all of the victims who testified” because:
“the accusers corroborated.cach.other and were backed up by other evidence.” (Ud. at:2). ‘He further
explained that he rejected’Professor Loftus’s testimony because “she had:never conducted a-study
on whether [the tactics she studied] would work: with memorics of sexual abuse.” (/d: at 4).
