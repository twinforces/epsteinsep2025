understanding. See'D*Amelio, 683 F.3d. at 416. Accordingly, the Court concludes that, no
constructive amendment resulted as to Count. Four.
3. No constructive amendment occurred as to Count Three.

The Defendant’s argument:as to constructive amendment:of Count Three, conspiracy‘to
transport, wholly depends on her theory.as to Count’Four.” She argues that sinec:it.is “elear” that
the jury convicted the Defendant of Count Four’ based. only on Jane’s New‘Mexico testimony, it
must have convicted on the same basis forthe conspiracy counts. Maxwell ‘Br. at. 16. Because.
no constructive amendment resulted as to ‘Count Four, this: argument is‘unavailing. But:even if
the Court were persuaded, that the jury note revealed that the jury:convicted the Defendant of

therefore claims she was unfairly surprised by its introduction. For purposes ofthis motion, the

Court Will-assume that Jane’s testimony regarding New. Mexico constituted a:varianée from the

addresses-only Count Three:here. Th any event, the Defendant's arguments as to -why:Counts-One.and. Three were
‘constructively amended.are the same. See; Maxwell Br. at 16.
