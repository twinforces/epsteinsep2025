The Congressional intent-underlying the Act was clear: the criminal statutes and the Sentencing

Guidelines, needed to be amended to impose harsher sentences on. these sorts of dangerous,

repeat sexual. offenders to make sure that they.do not “strike again.”

The ‘Sentencing Commission adopted this rationale in:promulgating §-4B1.5. ‘The:
commentary to the guideline explains that the adjustment should only apply to defendants who:
present a continuing danger to the: community because there is a ‘significant risk that they will re-
offend if they are released from prison. See USSG § 4B1.5, emt. background (“This guideline is
intended to provide lengthy incarceration. for offenders who commit sex. offenses against:minors
and who present.a continuing danger to the public.” (emphasis added); seealso. United States v.
Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d.265, 285 (2d. Cir, 2012) (“We further note that this guideline [§4B1.5] is

399

intended to identify “repeat sex. offenders,” who pose. ‘a continuing danger to the public.” (citing
USSG § 4B1.5 cmt. background)). The title of the enhancement itself reflects that it should only

be applicd’to “Repeat and Dangerous” sex offenders. USSG § 4B1L.5.
