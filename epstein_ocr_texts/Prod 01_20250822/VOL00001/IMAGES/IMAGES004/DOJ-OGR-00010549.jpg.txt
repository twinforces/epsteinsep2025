4. Sexual Abuse of Virginia Roberts

Beginning in or about the summer of 2000, the defendant and Epstein entered a new phase
of their scheme to sexually abuse teenage girls. That summer, Maxwell recruited a 17-year-old
girl named Virginia Roberts from the parking lot of Mar-a-Lago to provide Epstein with massages.
(PSR § 56). Over the next several months, Virginia was paid to provide Epstein with sexualized
massages at his Palm Beach residence, in exchange for hundreds of dollars in cash for each
massage. (PSR § 55). Virginia also traveled with Epstein and Maxwell to other locations,

Beach villa in 2001. (PSR ff 58, 59). Thus began the pyramid scheme phase of the defendant and
Epstein’s abuse of teenage girls.

she was sexually abused during paid sexualized massages. (PSR 59). Carolyn met the defendant

introduced Carolyn to the defendant. (PSR { 62). The defendant then told Virginia, “You can
bring her upstairs and show her what to do,” after which Virginia showed Carolyn how to perform
a sexual massage on Epstein. (PSR {| 62-63). Carolyn performed over 100 paid sexualized
massages for Epstein when she was between 14 and 18 years old. (PSR ¥ 64). The vast majority
