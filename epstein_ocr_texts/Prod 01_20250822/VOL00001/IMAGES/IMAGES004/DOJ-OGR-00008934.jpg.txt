instead. instructed. the jury that.the government needed to prove travel “in interstate commerce, as
alleged in the Indictment.” Dkt. 565 at.22.

following: “The Government’s proposed instructions onl} permit thé jury to convict on a
jury: about the agcs of consent: in other'jurisdictions.” Dkt.410-1.at.52.(cmphasis added). The

Finally, the defense requested that the jury charge reiterate the Court’s limiting
‘instructions for Kate and. Annic Farmer in the section of the charge that addressed the: violation

testimony, the government’ stated:

‘Mexico., See, 3509-008 at 7-L1. Shortly before trial, after being:questioned.by the: government on this topic, Jane:

She: then:reiterated'thisin her, testimony. See Tr. 323:15-16 (1 just remember being led to his:bedroomiand,you
