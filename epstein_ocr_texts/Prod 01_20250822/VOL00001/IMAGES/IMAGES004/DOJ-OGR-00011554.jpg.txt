said, I don't neéd repetition of the arguments in 'the papers,
but if there is any additional points. you. want to make, you're
welcome to.

MR, EVERDELL: Your Honor, just ene point. I will be
brief. The government in its papers makes the argument that
the background commentary can't be relied upon. as authoritative
because it is, not explanatory or interpretative of what’ the
guideline is. I think. that is incorrect.

Tt i5 not simply da recitation of what Congress was
considering, That first sentence or two which talks about how
this guideline can only be applied to offenders who reéprésent a
continuing danger to the community 1s imtenpretatave of what.
the guidéline is. The title 6f the guideline is repéat dnd
dangerous. sex offenders. That explanatory commentary explains
how to interpret what dangerous means: It means soméone who is
continuously dangerous to the community, not. someone ‘who's
never been accused of a Crime in the 18 plus years since the
erime in this case, and, has never been, accused of ne-offending.
So. I doh't agree with that point. This is authoritative
guidance from the Sentencing Commission, and the Court should
consider it as such. Thank you.

THE COURT: Ms. Moe, do you want. to respond?

MS. MOE: No, your Hénor. We rest on our briefing on
this issue, but thank you.

THE COURT: Thank you. Anything else?
