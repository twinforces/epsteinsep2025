application. /d. at 2736.

In.her brief, the Defendant reiterates her request:that:the Court. “enter.a.judgment of.
acquittal ‘as to all counts.” Maxwell Br. at'30. ‘The Court has deemed Counts One.and Five
multiplicitous, s¢e.sipra Part I, and therefore the Court will not enter judgment on those counts.
And.at:trial, the jury’ found the Defendant:not guilty ‘on Count Two. Thus, the Court will
consider the ‘sufficiency of the evidence for the remaining counts: Three; Four, and. Six. After
considering the arguments. and evidence, the Court denies the Defendant’?s Rule 29 motion.

The Court first, notes that the Defendant has not provided substantive argument on the
sufficiency of the evidence—in citheér the oral application or'the post-conviction bricfing—for

that the Court should “‘enter a.judgment of acquittal. as to all. counts under Rule: 29 . .. because
the government failed:to prove cach clement of the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.”
