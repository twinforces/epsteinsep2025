MS. MOE! That's, correct, ‘your Honor. dJtst to be able
to see the binder before it"s passed gut to jurors, because
they'll have a binder full of paper and be flipping through it
te turn te exhibits. We just want to have chance to lay eyes

on, that bindér in an abundance Of Gaution. T'vé note that we

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, what we would liké to do is
follow the practice of thas Court that it's been doing forever,
as far as I know, which is that béfore we show anything to thé
witness, we will show it, to the government and we will show it
t6 the Court and the Court's deputy so6 that they Gan see what.
we are showing to ‘the witness. But we do mot want to give them
a whole binder of Cross materials befére the Gross bégins.

THE COURT: All right. That's fine. But in ‘that
case, we woh't place the binder with the jury ==

MR. EVERDELL: That's fine.

THE COURT: == in advance.

MR. EVERDELL: That's fine.
