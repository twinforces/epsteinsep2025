interviewed by the Court; the parties were permitted to propose’ questions before and during the:
heating.”), aff'd, 285 F.3d 158 (2d Cir. 2002).

That course of action is especially appropriate-here for several reasons. First, the subject
matter—the juror’s history of sexual :abuse—presents a particularly high:danger of harassment or
embairassment. Sécond,.as noted above, the déefendant’s brief is littered with information barred
inadmissible: subjects. ‘The Court should exercise its discretion to supervise: the hearing by
conducting the. questioning itself.

2. The.Scope of the Hearing Should Be Limited.

The scope of the hearing should be tightly limited to “only what is absolutely necessary to:
determine the facts with precision.” Janniello, 866 F.2d.at 544; see also Sun Myung Moon, 718
F.2d at 1234; Gagnon, 282. F: App’x.at 40. Here, the only issues relevant under McDonough are

biased against the defendant. No other subjects are appropriate for inquiry.

4 Ip particular, Juror 50, cannot be asked to testify about what was said by any juror (including
him). in the jury:room, or what his mental process was as.a deliberating juror. He also cannot be
asked whether he or .any other juror discussed personal experiences with sexual abuse during
deliberations. Fed. R. Evid. 606(b); Warger, 574 U.S..at.43-44 (“We hold that Rule 606(b) applies
to. juror testimony during a procéeding in which a party seeks to secure a new trial on the ground
that a juror lied during voir dire.”).
!> For the reasons discussed above,

+; the defendant has also not met her
burden with respect to whether Juror 50 answered Question 25 incortectly, namely, whether Juror
50 considers himself:to be a-victim Of a crime. However, in the event that Juror 50’s testimony at
the hearing regarding Question 48 makes clear that Juror 50 answered Question 25 incorrectly as:
well, the Government’ would consent to the Court questioning Juror 50 regarding that question..
However, that questioning should be limited in the same manner as discussed throughout with
respect to Question 48.
