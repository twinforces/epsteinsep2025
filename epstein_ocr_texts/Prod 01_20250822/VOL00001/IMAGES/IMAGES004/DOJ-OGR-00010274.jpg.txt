Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document647 Filed 03/11/22 Page 8of24

Under the second. clement of Count Four, can the defendant'be found. guilty if the

defendant’s intent: was for Jane to engage! in. sexual activity in New’ Mexico and if?

the defendant aided, in the transportation of Jane’s return flight ‘from New Mexico,.

but:not the flight:to New Mexico?

Hence, the question posed.by the Jury” Note contained two parts. The jury wanted.to knowif it
was sufficicnt'to satisfy the second clement.of Count Fourif it found (1); that Ms. Maxwell’s
intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New:-Mexico, and (2) that Ms. Maxwell
assisted with Jane’s return, flight from.New Mexico, but:not her flight to New’Mexico. That is
the straightforward, common sense reading of the Jury Note.

The answer to the first part of the jury’s question is an unequivocal no. The jury
instruction, forthe second, clement of Count.Four charged that the government had to prove
beyond a:reasonable. doubt'that!Ms. Maxwell “knowingly transported Jane. in interstate,

‘with a criminal offense in violation, of New York law.” (Instr. No. 2.1 (emphasis added)). It was
therefore not sufficient to satisfy this clement ifthe jury: found that:Ms. Maxwell intended for
Jane to engage in sexual activity in New’Mexico. Any sexual activity that.occurred, in New
Mexico could not, by definition, be a. violation of New York law.

Accordingly, the Jury Note: revealed that the jury had.a fundamental. misunderstanding of
‘the intent requirement under Count: Four. The jury needed to be given.a supplemental instruction
clarifying that to: convict under Count Four, they necdeéd ‘to find 'that.Ms. Maxwell intended for
Jane to engage:in sexual activity in New York and that any‘scxual activity that occurred.in New
Mexico, while it was potentiallyrelevant evidence, could not have violated. New York law. The
Court’s decision to‘simply refer the jury to the existing jury instruction for the second clement of
Count Four did nothing to cure the:misunderstanding’ because the jury already had those

instructions and, was still evidently confused. about the proof necessary to satisfy Count:Four. As
