e Ofthe 5 jurors seated as alternates, none disclosed on their questionnaires
that they were victims of sexual abuse, sexual assault, or sexual
harassment.*

e Of the 12 deliberating jurors, none disclosed on their questionnaires that
they were victims of sexual abuse, sexual assault, or sexual harassment.

As we now know, however, Juror No. 50 was not telling the truth when he denied being a
victim of a crime or being a victim of sexual abuse, sexual assault, or sexual harassment.
And as explained below, it appears a second deliberating juror was also untruthful when
they denied being a victim of sexual abuse, sexual assault, or sexual harassment.
Il. Juror No. 50’s admissions that he wasn’t truthful with the Court

* The court originally seated 6 alternates, but one alternate became a deliberating
juror when an original juror was excused due to a family commitment. None of the 18
individuals selected for service as a deliberating or alternate juror answered “yes” when
asked if they were a victim of sexual abuse, sexual assault, or sexual harassment.
