States v. Long, 697 F. Supp. 651, 657 (S:D.N:Y. 1988). ‘The defendant has not.made ‘such a.
showing. Her abstract assertions simply do not rise to, that level, arid the law is clear’ that, “proof
of prejudice:must be-definite and not speculative.” Birney,:686 F.2d at 105-06; see also.Long, 697
F. Supp. at 657 (finding that “perecived ‘prejudice is: speculative” where there was “no way of
knowing, what [the unavailable witiess’s] testimony would have been”); United States v. Valona,
834 F.2d. 1334, 1339 (7th Cir, 1987) (noting that ‘prejudice analysis must consider whether the
missing ‘witness “would have withstood cross-examination,” ‘whether the jury: would have found.
him. a “credible witness,” and. whether the testimony, when compared to other trial. evidence
“would affect the trial outcome”); Spears, 159 F.3d at.1085. “Courts have generally found that.
vague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable testimony do, not. justify
dismissing an indictment.for delay.” (Dkt. No. 207 at.17); see also United States.v. Scala, 388 F.
Supp: 2d 396, 399-400 (S.D.N.¥. 2005) (““Counsel’s unsworn assertions as ‘to vague generalities”
that witnesses, “if alive, would give testimony helpful. to [the defendant] do not show ‘that’ [the
defendant’s] ability to present a defense: has: been substantially and. actually prejudiced.”). ‘Here,
“there ‘is no evidence before the Court.as to: what: [the deecased. witnesses] would have testificd,
much. less specific ‘evidence of how losing that testimony has caused. [the defendant] actual
prejudice.” Jd.‘at 400. The defense’s ‘unsworn assertions about what “the defense believes” these
witnesses. “could have established” or “could have testified” to do not justify dismissing the
Indictment or-vacating the:defendant’s conviction. (Def. Mot. at.29-30).

Second, even. assuming that Pinto, Salhi, Markham, ‘and Fontanilla would have testified, as

the defendant conténds, such testimoriy would have no bearing on ‘whether the defendant did,.:in.
