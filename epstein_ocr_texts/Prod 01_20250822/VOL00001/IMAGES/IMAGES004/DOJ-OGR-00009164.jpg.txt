into the subject, by allowing [him] an.opportunity to fully.and fairly brief the Court.on the relevant.
issues.” (/d. at 7).

In. his. motion, Juror 50’s counsel. requested. a ‘copy of Juror 50’s questionnaire, ‘as well. as
the transeript of-his testimony during voir dire. (Juror 50:Mem. at:'4). The defendant opposes Juror:
S0’s request, describing::it. as’ a “discovery request” and. claiming that. the release. of Juror 'S0.’s

2 “ee

questionnaire would-prejudice the “investigation” of Juror:50’s “conduct” and “undoubtably color
Juror No. 50’s testimony.and.allow him to place himself in the bestpossible-posture.” (Def. Mem.
at 52-53). As an. initial matter, the Government notes that Juror S0’s ‘voir dire: was conducted ‘in.
open court. and is therefore available to Juror 50 and, his counsel. As to the request, for his
questionnaire, the Government submits that Juror'50 should. get.a copy of his own questionnaire.
The defendant has characterized Juror 50’s request. for his own questionnaire as a.
“diseovery request,” but Juror 50:is not-a-defendant-and‘he is not secking diseovery.'* He is asking
for. access to his. questionnaire? a, document ‘that. he himself: prepared and swore under penalty of
‘to ‘protect his own privacy: interests. See, e.g, Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California,
Riverside Cty.,.464 U:S..501, 51.1-12:(1984). The privacy concerns that otherwise might require

limiting:access to Juror 50’s questionnaire plainly do not apply toJuror 50 himself or his counsel.'°

'S The defendant claims that courts have “refused discovery to individuals or entities under
investigation” “[uJ]nder ‘analogous cireumstanees.” (Def. Mem. at 53). But in support of that
argument, the defendant. cites only.John Doe Agency Vv. John Doe Corp..'493 US. 146 (1989),
which is elcarly'not analogous as it involved a requést under the Freedom of Information Act and,
an ongoing grand jury: procecding.

19, On January 24,2022, the New York Times Company moved.to unscal, among other things, the
filled-out questionnaires for the twelve scated. jurors. (Dkt. No. 583). The Government intends to
address that motion. on, or before February 11, 2022,in accordance with the: Court’s January’ 26,
2022 order (Dkt. No. 585).
