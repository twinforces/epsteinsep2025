trafficking conspiracy was to “recruit, enticc, hatbor, transport, provide, or obtain” a, minor to:
engage in a.commercial sex act. If the “grooming” had failed to entice Carolyn.and others to
give:sexualized:massages ‘to Epstein:in exchange for cash, there would be:no sex trafficking
count:

For these reasons, Counts. One, Three, anid. Five describe:a single conspiracy, not multiple
‘conspiracies, and are therefore multiplicitous.. Accordingly, the Court should enter judgment on
only one of these counts.

I. The Court Should. Vacate.Ms. Maxwell’s Conviction and:Dismiss the S2_ Indictment

Due to Pre-Indictment: Delay.

The Court should vacate. Ms. Maxwell’s convictions as to. all. courts and dismiss the
Indictment due to: the government’s excessive and prejudicial delay in bringing’this prosecution
against.Ms. Maxwell ‘in violation, of her due ‘process, rights. Ms. Maxwell :previously°made this
claim in her initial and-supplemental pretrial motions. (Dkt. 138,293). The Court denied the
motion cach time on the grounds that Ms.. Maxwell failed. to show “actual. and. substantial.
prejudice” caused. by the-delay. (Dkt. 207 at 16-18: Dkt. 31.7 at.10). The Court, however;
granted:Ms. Maxwell leave to renew‘the: motion after the conclusion. of trial. (Dkt. 207 at..18;
Dkt. 31:7 at 10). Ms. Maxwell, now reasserts the ‘same motion and incorporates the ‘arguments
previously made to-the Court.
charging'this case substantially prejudiced Ms. Maxwell’s defense. For example, critical
documentary ‘records and witnesses that would.have allowed Ms. Maxwell to effectively

challenge’ the government’s proof were'no longer, available, including the following:
