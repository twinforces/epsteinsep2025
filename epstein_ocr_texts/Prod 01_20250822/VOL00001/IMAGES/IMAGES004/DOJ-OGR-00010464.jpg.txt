United States, 552 US. 38; 49 (2007))..A fter correctly. calculating the guidelines range, the: Court:
must next consider the statutory ‘factors sct forth.in 18°U.S.C. §3553(a). Gall, 552.U.S. at 49-50.
As directed by the Supreme Court,.a. district court. “may. not presume that.a. sentence within the
applicable: Guidelines range is reasonable.” Ne/son, 3. United States, 555 U.S. 350; 352 (2009).
Rather, after calculating the appropriate guidelines. range, sentencing courts must consider the:
§3553(a) factors, make an.individualized’‘asscssment, and.impose.a sentence thatiis “sufficient, but
not greater than. nécessary” to. meet the objectives. of sentencing. § 3553(a); Gall, 552'U'S. at'50
18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)
The 3553(a) factors include, among other things:

of the defendant;

2. the need for'the sentence imposed,

(A) to reflect the: seriousness of the: offense, to _ promote respect for. the law,
and to provide just-punishment for the offense;

(B) to afford adequate detérrenice'to criminal. conduct;
(C) to protect the: public: from. further. crimes of the defendant;

(D) to provide the defendant; with, needed cducational. or vocational training,
medical care, or other correctional’ treatment. in the most effective ‘manner;

(E) to. avoid‘unwarranted.sentence disparities; and
3. the kinds of sentences available.
In. this. €ase, We respectfully submit that the § 3553(a) factors—including Ms. Maxwell’s,
“history and.characteristics,” the need for the sentence imposed to provide “just punishment,” and

the need to avoid ‘unwarranted sentencing disparitics - weigh heavily in favor of a sentence
