Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Court is in receipt of the parties’ proposed redactions to the Defendant’s motion for a
new trial, the Government’s response in opposition, and the Defendant’s reply in support. See
Dkt. No. 596. The parties did not propose any redactions to Juror 50’s motion nor the parties
letters dated January 13, 2022. See id. at 7. The Defendant submitted a letter justifying her
proposed redactions, Dkt. No. 602, and the Government submitted an opposition to the
proposals, Dkt. No. 603.

The Court determines that the following proposed redactions are not consistent with the
Court’s prior order, Dkt. No. 596, because they redact information that is widely reported in the
press and/or redact legal arguments:
