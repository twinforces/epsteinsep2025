the multiple millions of dollars. A $750,000 fine will hardly impact her financial outlook, but it
is the most the law will allow in this case. The Court should impose it without hesitation.

With respect to forfeiture, the Government is not seeking to forfeit any property because
the Government has not identified specific property used in the offense conduct that the defendant
herself owned.

Finally, because each of the identified victims has already received monetary compensation
for the harms caused to them by the defendant’s criminal conduct, the Government does not seek
restitution in this case. Restitution is not available where victims have received compensation for
their losses from another source. Each of the six victims identified at trial—Jane, Annie, Kate,
Carolyn, Virginia, and Melissa—has received funds from the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund
and/or civil settlements as compensation for the harms they suffered as a result of the defendant’s
and Epstein’s crimes. The Government is not aware of any otherwise recoverable losses for which
these victims have not received monetary compensation. Accordingly, there is no legal basis for
restitution in this case.
