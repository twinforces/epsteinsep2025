the program.*° Ms. Feldman’s probate-court testimony, the Protocol, the FAQs, the EVCP
website, and EVCP press releases all highlight the program’s promise to maintain confidentiality
of claimants’ information and how that promise is a “cornerstone” of the EVCP.”’ Victims

Program and in deciding to participate in the claims process.”*
