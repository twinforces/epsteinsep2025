Banki, 685 F.3d.99, 118 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting United States v. Rigas, 490 F.3d 208,228 (2d
Cir. 2007)). Thus, the defendant, must,show that “the challenged. evidence or jury instructions
ticd a. defendant’s conviction to ‘bchavior. entirely sepurate from.that.identified in.the:
indictment:’” United States'‘v. Bastian, 770 F:3d,21.2, 223 (2d Cir. 2014) (emphasis added)
(quoting United States. Danielson, 199 F.3d 666, 670, (2d Cir. 1999).

By contrast, “[a] variance occurs when, the charging terms ofthe indictment are left
‘unaltered, but the evidence at trial, proves facts materially. different from those! alleged ‘in the
indictment.” Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 62:1 (quoting Frank, 156 F.3d at 337 n.5). “Although-the
distinction between constructive amendment and variance may appear ‘mercly one of degree;’

prejudice in.order to'prevail.ona;varianee elaim.”” /d., (quoting rank, 156.F/3d at 337 n.5); see
also Rigas, 490 F.3d at:226 (“[A] defendant alleging Variarice must show’ ‘substantial prejudice?
variance where the pleading and the: proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of
‘a. character. that could have misled the defendant :at.the:trial, and where the variance ‘is not-such.as
to deprive the accused-of his right to be protected against.another prosecution, for the same
offense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294 (quoting Sa/moneseé, 352 F.3d at 621-22). Moreover, when
a.defendant has sufficient notice: of the:Government’s theory’ at-trial, she:cannot.claim that she
was unfairly or substantially prejudiced. See United States'v. Kaplan, 490'F.3d 119, 129-30 (2d
Cir. 2007).

Finally, the Court bears in mind.-that the:Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule

33, which ‘permits, the Court: to “vacate any judgment and. grant a/new trial if the interest: of
