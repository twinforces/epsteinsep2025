Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document621 Filed 02/25/22 Page 34of51

It makes no difference, as the defendant argues, that both crimes involved grooming minors
for sexual abuse. (Def. Mot. at 23-24). As Dr. Rocchio testified at trial, the use of grooming
techniques is common among perpetrators of child sexual abuse. (See Tr. 713). But using a

Dkt. No. 317 at 10). Her arguments fare no better post-trial.

The defendant has not and cannot successfully establish a violation of the Due Process
Clause of the Fifth Amendment. First, the defendant has not established that any alleged pre-
indictment delay caused actual prejudice to the defense. Her speculative assertions about lost
