Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670 - Filed 06/22/22 Page 47 of55

Unlike the vast majority of inmates at the MDC, the defendant has been able to receive
almost immediate attention from legal counsel at the MDC, the Court, and the Government when
raising issues regarding her confinement. Her lawyers have not hesitated to alert the Court to
issues requiring its attention, and the Court has ensured that the defendant was able to prepare for
trial and participate in her defense. In addition, the defendant has filed numerous administrative
complaints with the BOP, all of which have apparently been evaluated as unfounded. For example,
the Government understands from legal counsel at the MDC that the BOP has investigated the
defendant’s complaints of physical abuse and concluded that they are unfounded. Legal counsel
at the MDC further informed the Government that all pat-down searches of the defendant that took
place pretrial were, in fact, video recorded.

Taken together with the defendant’s perjury in her civil deposition, her lies to Pretrial
Services, and her blatant lies about her own weight while in BOP custody, the Court can fairly
reject many of the defendant’s complaints about her conditions of confinement. Simply put, the
defendant lies when it suits her. It apparently suits her to spread horror stories about her
experiences in jail to the press in an attempt to garner public sympathy. See, e.g., Laurence

The defense’s attempts to compare the defendant’s conditions of confinement to that of a
defendant under Special Administrative Measures (“SAMs”) are stunningly off-base. As the Court
is well aware, before she was placed in general population, the defendant was permitted out of her
