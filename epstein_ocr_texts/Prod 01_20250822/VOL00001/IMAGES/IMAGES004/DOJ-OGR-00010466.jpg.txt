Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 663 _ Filed 06/15/22 Page 20 0f77

Nor'can.gencral deterrence be used. to justify.a. harsh, sentence for Ms. Maxwell. Probation.
‘identifies two: groups of potential offenders who will purportedly: be deterred from. committing
future crimes asa result of Ms., Maxwell’s sentence: (1) sexual predators who exploit and degrade
minor victims and (2).“untouchable individuals who feel their-privilege and affluence entitle them
to victimize others without fear‘or consequence.” PSR.at 67. With-regard to the first:group, courts
have expressed ‘legitimate, doubt ‘as to whether people who have asexual. predilection for minors.
‘ean. be deterred at all. See, ¢.g., Uitited States ¥..D.M., 942 F. Supp. 2d 327, 346 (E.D.N.Y. 2013)
(“[T]he: compulsive ‘bchavior and disorders: motivating many’ offenders is less susceptible to
general deterrenee.”’). With‘regard to the second group, the:purported justification sweeps far too
broadly. Rather than identify a particular class: of. similarly: situated defendants who will be:
deterred from committing specific crimes, Probation essentially makes the sweeping assertion, that.
a harsh sentence for Ms. Maxwell is necessary to deter rich people from exploiting poor people.
‘See PSR.at.67. That is not the purpose of general. deterrence:and should. not be given any weight
‘in. determining the appropriate sentence.

A. Below Guidelines Sentence Would Provide Just Punishment, Promoté Respect for the.
‘Law; and Avoid Unwarranited Sentencing Disparities

While the offense conduct is indisputably. scrious, the record reflects that/Epstein, was the
main offender. Given the foregoing discussion, a shorter term. of incarceration for Ms. Maxwell
best serves the: long-term goals of punishment. A significantly below-guidelines sentence in this
‘case: would also promote respect for the, law by demonstrating ‘that; the justice: system: considers.
‘each ‘person. who comes before the Court as an individual. A sentence ‘tailored ‘to. Ghislaine
‘Maxwell’s particular circumstances—would appropriately distinguish between, this defendant and
more culpable individuals similarly charged. See United States v. Dervee, 616 F.3d. 174, 187 (2d.

Cir. 2010) (“[CJourts must guard. against:unwarranted.similaritics among sentences for defendants:
