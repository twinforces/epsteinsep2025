Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 663 _ Filed 06/15/22 Page 53 of 77

Ghislaine has managed to live through the most arduous pre-trial detention for over 500
days under'an “enhanced security schedule” at MDC. Brooklyn, with courage, humility and
‘stoicism. During her pre-trial detention, she suffered conditions’ that have constantly and
daily contravened the UN Mandela Rules of detention to which the US is a party. Examples
highlighted by Ghislaine’s counsel includé “severe sleep deprivation, a lack of potable
water; prison computers that do not function and inability to access the Prosecution
discovery or keep jail guards: from reviewing her confidential materials.” |am in awe of the.
depth of her life force and forbearance. This:shows me that:she will be able to emerge from

incarceration with fortitude and magnanimity.

| conclude this letter with.a reiteration of the government's and the Court's own repeated
‘assertions that Ghislaine is no threat to. society; and in restating my strongest belief that
Ghislaine: would bring all her deep and demonstrated qualities to bear again to help society.

| hope greatly that she will be given the opportunity to:do'so sooner rather than later.

Yours! respectfully,

isabel Maxwel
