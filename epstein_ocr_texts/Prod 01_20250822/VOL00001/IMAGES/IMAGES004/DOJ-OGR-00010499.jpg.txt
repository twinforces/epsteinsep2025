Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document663_ Filed 06/15/22 Page 53 of 77
Ghislaine has managed to live through the most arduous pre-trial detention for over 500
days under an “enhanced security schedule” at MDC Brooklyn, with courage, humility and
stoicism. During her pre-trial detention, she suffered conditions that have constantly and
daily contravened the UN Mandela Rules of detention to which the US is a party. Examples
highlighted by Ghislaine’s counsel include “severe sleep deprivation, a lack of potable
water, prison computers that do not function and inability to access the Prosecution
discovery or keep jail guards from reviewing her confidential materials.” | am in awe of the
depth of her life force and forbearance. This shows me that she will be able to emerge from
incarceration with fortitude and magnanimity.
| conclude this letter with a reiteration of the government’s and the Court’s own repeated
assertions that Ghislaine is no threat to society; and in restating my strongest belief that
Ghislaine would bring all her deep and demonstrated qualities to bear again to help society.
| hope greatly that she will be given the opportunity to do so sooner rather than later.

Yours respectfully,
Isabel Maxwell
