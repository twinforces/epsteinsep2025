alter the fact that the evidence and.instructions at trial captured the core of criminality. of the
Indictivient.

The jury note at issuc read:

Under Count Four (4), if the defendant: aided. in the transportation. of Jane’s return flight,

but:riot the flight.to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to cngage:in sexual

activity, can she be ‘found. guilty under the. second. clement?

being asked. For example, the jury could have been asking about aiding+and-abetting liability: as,
