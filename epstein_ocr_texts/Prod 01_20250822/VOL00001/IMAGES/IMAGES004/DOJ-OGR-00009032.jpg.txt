invidious as an intentionally false answer. United States v. Langford, 990 F.2d 65, 68 (2d
Cir. 1993).'! As the Second Circuit held in Langford:

We read [McDonough] multi-part test as governing not only inadvertent

nondisclosures but also nondisclosures or misstatements that were deliberate,

for though the McDonough Court began with the inadvertent response before

it, 1t stated that the further showing of cause must be made even after a juror’s

“failure to answer honestly,” and it hypothesized that there could be various

“motives for concealing.” Concurring in the judgment, Justice Brennan

similarly stated that a second element—bias—should be required even 1f the

juror’s erroneous response was deliberate. Thus, he stated that the

proper focus when ruling on a motion for new trial in this
situation should be on the bias of the juror and the resulting
prejudice to the litigant. . .
... Whether the juror answered a particular question on voir
dire honestly or dishonestly, or whether an inaccurate answer
was inadvertent or intentional, are simply factors to be
considered in th[e] . . . determination of actual bias.

Langford, 990 F.2d at 68 (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 557-58 (Brennan, J.,

concurring in judgment)).

you [potential jurors] have yourself or any members of your immediate family sustained
any severe injury [in] an accident at home, or on the farm or at work that result in any
disability or prolonged pain and suffering?” 464 U.S. at 550. After trial, it was discovered
