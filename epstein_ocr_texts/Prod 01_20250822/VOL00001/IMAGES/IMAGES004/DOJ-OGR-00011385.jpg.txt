jurors on this case:

Il. Modified Defense Strikes
The defense also writes to advise the Court of a small number of prospective jurors that the
defense intended to strike, but inadvertently indicated should proceed to voir dire. The defense
believes that the following jurors should be stricken and should not proceed to voir dire:
