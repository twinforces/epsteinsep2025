interview as part of an hour-long “documentary” called “Ghislaine, Prince Andrew and
the Paedophile,” which aired on the British channel ITV. He has engaged on Twitter with
the journalist who wrote about him, and he has communicated directly with Annie
Farmer. See Ashfar, 196 A.3d at 95-96 (relying on juror’s post-trial conduct as a basis for
concluding juror was biased and new trial was required because juror falsely answered
