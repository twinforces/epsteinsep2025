1 through 42 will be in the main jury selection room and then 43
2 through, I believe 82 -- we will get the final number once we

3 see what the return on the summons is -â€”- will be seated in

4 courtroom 9C also at 500 Pearl, with a live feed to 9C of

a everything taking place in the jury assembly room.

6 I will make preliminary instructions which you have

7 seen after you and I enter the courtroom. The panel members

8 will be seated at that point. I will make my preliminary

9 remarks, the written questionnaire that the jurors can read

10 along with will be handed out at that point, both in the jury
11 assembly room and in 9C simultaneously through court staff. I
12 will instruct the jurors not to write anything on the

13 questionnaire with the exception of circling a number if they
14 have a "yes" response to that question as I read through the

15 questionnaire.

16 So, at that point I will turn to panel member juror

17 no. 1 and go through and read the questionnaire getting "yes"
18 or "no" response to each question. If the answer is "yes"

19 following up as appropriate. To the extent that the matters
20 touched upon could influence other jurors or are of a sensitive
21 nature, we will bring that juror over to the plexiglass area to
22 my right in the jury assembly room, there is markings on the
23 floor where folks stand and the noise machine will be on so
24 that others cannot hear, and I will inquire with the juror as
25 to any necessary follow-up.
