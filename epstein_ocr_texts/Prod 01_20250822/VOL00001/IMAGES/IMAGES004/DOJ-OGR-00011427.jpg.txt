accusers, this Court should resolve cach. of these disagreements in, favor:of Ms. Maxwell and.
This Court.cvaluates'a,.Rule 1'7(c) subpoena under Nivon, 41:8 U.S. at-699=700. See

United States v.. Pena, No..15-CR-55.1 (AIN), 2016 WL 8735699, at * 1-2:(S.D.N-Y. Feb. 12,

2016).° Under Nixon, Ms. Maxwell “must, make a preponderance showing that the materials
‘requested. are relevant, specifically:identified, admissible, and not otherwise procurable by the:
exercise of due:diligence.” Pena, 2006 WL: 8735699, at. *2 (quoting Barnes, 560 Fed. Appx. at
39-40). If Ms: Maxwell satisfics this standard, the ‘Court may quash ‘the subpoena only “if

compliance would be unreasonable. of oppressive.” Fed. .R. Crim. P. '1.7(c).

“In United Statés'v. Pena, this Court declined.to follow the more liberal. standard, for
‘defense subpoenas to third partics articulated :in United States v. Tucker, 249 F.R.D. 58
(S.D-N.Y. 2008). The Second Circuit has. not resolved this. debate. See United States 'v. Barnes,
560 Fed. Appx. 36, 40 n.J. (2d Cir. 2014) (unpublished) (declining to address the defendant’s
argument that the court “forego the Nixon ‘standard for the more permissive standard employed in,
[/tcker]”).

Ms. Maxwell. contends: that: Zivcker articulates. the correct. standard. See Nachamic, 91 FE.

‘Supp. 2d at 562-63 (“A real question, remains as to whether it makes sense'to require a
defendant’s use of: Rule '7(c):to obtain material from a non-party to meet [the Nixon] ‘standard.
Unlike the Government, the defendant, has not had. aii carlicr opportunity to obtain material by
means. of'a grand jury subpoena. Because the Rule states only that a-court may quash a.subpocna,

‘if, compliance would be:unreasonable or oppressive, ’ the judicial gloss that. the material sought
must be evidentiary—defined as rcleyant, admissible and specific—may be inappropriate in:the
context of a defense subpoena of documents from third-parties.” (citing ‘Lomison, 969 F. Supp. ‘at
593 n.14)).

Even:so, this Court:nced not reconsider its ‘decision. in.Pena, because:Ms. Maxwell’s:

subpoena is enforecable under Nixon. Should this Court.disagree, however, Ms. Maxwell makes
this, argument to preserve the record for’potential appellate review.
