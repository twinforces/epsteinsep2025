Finally, at 11:17 p.m. last night (December 5), the government disclosed yet more expert
opinions from Examiner Flatley, again in the form of notes apparently taken by Ms. Pomerantz.!

If there were any doubt before, the government’s midnight disclosure puts to bed the notion that
Examiner Flatley does not intend to offer expert opinion testimony.

As elaborated below, this Court should exclude any opinion testimony first disclosed to

Ms. Maxwell in the November 26 letter, the December 3 email, or the December 5 email.
ARGUMENT

In substance and in brief, here’s what the government’s November 26, December 3, and
December 5 disclosures reveal about the intended substance of Examiner Flatley’s testimony,
who is expected to testify tomorrow, December 7.

® November 26: Examiner Flatley will testify that Exhibits 54 and 55 are clones,

i.é., exact copies, of seized devices. He will testify how he cloned them and how
he’s sure Exhibits 54 and 55 are clones. He will testify that other exhibits
(documents, photos, emails) were extracted from the clones. He will testify that
certain of these were created under the username “gmax.” He will opine about
metadata, what it is, and what the metadata on these extracted documents, photos,
and emails shows. He will testify that he verified the accuracy of the metadata and
how he did so.

' Defense counsel conferred with Ms. Pomerantz on Friday, December 3 about this issue,
after receiving the government’s midnight disclosure from that day but before the government
made yet another untimely disclosure late last night.
