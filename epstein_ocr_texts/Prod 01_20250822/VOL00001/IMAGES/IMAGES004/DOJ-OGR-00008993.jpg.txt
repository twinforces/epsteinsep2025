ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

On January 19,2022, the Defendant filed a motion. fora new'trial pursuant to Federal
Rule: of Criminal Procedure, 33 on;the basis that Juror 50 “falscly answered a;matcrial question
during voir dire.and .. . that, had he answered truthfully, he would have been subject to a
challenge for cause.” Maxwell Br., Jan. 19,2022, at 48. The Defendant contends thatthe
current:paper record:sufficiently supports her motion and should. be granted‘ without .a hearing.
In the alternative, she:requests:that a hearing be. conducted. Jd. She also argucs that if'a hearing
is ordered, a.broader hearing is required. based on a-news article that suggests a second juror'was
allegedly a victim of:séxual abuse. /d. at 48-49.

In.an Opinion & Order filed. under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant’s.
motion, for.a, new trial on the current:record. As.explained in the temporarily scaled Opinion &
Order, Defendant’s motion .on thé currentrecord relies extensively on statements made by Juror:
considering under Federal Rule of Evidence 606. ‘With regard to Juror.50’s statements that. do
not pertain-to,jury deliberations, in. order to resolve the:motion on-this record, the Court would
haye to accept'unsworn statements made to media outlets as true and reach factual
determinations that! are not available: on the current record.
