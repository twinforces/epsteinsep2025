Porensic-Psychiatric Report
Ghislaine Maxwell

Ms. Maxwell’s ability to cope with the stress of her legal proceedings and to participate
meaningfully in her defense are gradually being eroded over time due to the conditions of her
confinement, as reported by Ms. Maxwell, observed by this examiner, and corroborated by
Ms. Saffian and in the results of her psychological testing. Recently she has manifested
symptoms of depression and trauma such as anxiety, and minor cognitive deficits. These
continue to be exacerbated by ongoing sleep deprivation and the conditions of her
confinement. Given my extensive experience working with incarcerated individuals, based on
the manner in which Ms. Maxwell’s symptoms have manifest, it is clear that her symptoms are
in no way related to the charges that have been brought against her. Instead they are directly
related to the conditions of her confinement.

The conditions of her confinement are, in my opinion, directly influencing her increasing
depression and trauma response symptoms, which will continue to worsen over time if she
remains incarcerated under the current conditions. If she were permitted to be released into
the community, her symptoms would likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the
opportunity to properly prepare her defense for trial.

At this tme, Ms. Maxwell currently poses little to no risk to the community, as she has
no prior history of criminal or violent behavior and her current charges could only have been
manifest under a very specific set of circumstances which she cannot find herself in if she were
to be released. Additionally, in my psychiatric opinion, she is not a flight risk, as she has
maintained a strong desire to fight the case against her, despite any psychiatric symptoms that
have manifested. Ms. Maxwell has the personality characteristics of a fighter, she has
demonstrated a firm resolve to fight her current charges and clear her name. Thete is no
indication that she would attempt to flee given her personality profile.

Respectfully,
