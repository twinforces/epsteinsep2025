Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document613 Filed 02/24/22 Page 20 of 66

Juror No. 50 also explained, again based on his personal experience, why it was
immaterial to him and the jury that the alleged victims did not disclose Ms. Maxwell’s
alleged involvement until very recently, some twenty years after the alleged abuse. “I
didn’t disclose my abuse until I was in high school,” he said.

Juror No. 50 also had an excuse for why the alleged victims in this case kept going
back to Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell and accepting help from them even after they had
been abused. The alleged victims’ conduct, explained Juror No. 50, was irrelevant to their
credibility. In Juror No. 50’s view, Ms. Maxwell’s defense team was continually
attacking the alleged victims and trying to get the jury to judge them for their decisions,
as opposed to arguing that their stories were not worthy of belief.

2. The interview with the Daily Mail

On January 5, the Daily Mail published an article based on its interview with Juror
No. 50,° in which he described Ms. Maxwell as a “predator.” Juror No. 50 also shared
that he helped other members of the jury understand things from a victim’s point of view
and explained how “you can’t remember all the details” of traumatic memories: “there
are some things that run together.” When Juror No. 50 told his fellow jurors of the abuse
he suffered, the room “went silent.” Although he couldn’t remember every detail, there
were others that stuck with him: “I know what happened when I was sexually abused. I
remember the color of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video.”
Juror No. 50 said the verdict was for “all the victims.”
