Ms. Maxwell would like to ask Mr. Glassman whether he made a $25 million demand to

Ms. Maxwell to settle the civil case against her. It should be noted that defense counsel did not
question Jane about this demand when they had a chance, so there is no impeachment value to
anything Mr. Glassman could say. It should also be noted that Ms. Maxwell or Ms. Menninger
(who represented Ms. Maxwell in the civil case), who are both already present in the courtroom,
could testify about any such demand. So there is nothing Mr. Glassman could offer on this
subject that would be probative and outweigh the risk of possible disclosure of confidential
information inherent in calling Jane's attorney to the witness stand. Additionally, whether a
settlement demand would have been made in the civil case against Ms. Maxwell seems wholly
irrelevant as that civil case settled well over a year before Jane testified; that is, at the time Jane
testified in the criminal trial, she had no financial incentive to do so.

With regard to demands to the EVCP, Jane adopts the arguments made by the
Government in its opposition, and adds again that the civil case settled long before Jane's
testimony in the criminal trial against Ms. Maxwell — so Jane had no financial interest in the
substance of her testimony.

Finally, we remind the Court that we believe that the subpoena that was served on Mr.
Glassman was invalid under Fed. R. Crim. Pro 17, and that Mr. Glassman is not currently under
valid subpoena.

Accordingly, we respectfully request that the Defendant's motion to compel Mr.
Glassman to testify should be denied.
