Ms. Maxwell. would like to ask.Mr. Glassman whether he made.a $25 million demand to
Ms. Maxwell to scttle the civil case against. her. It. should be tioted that defense counsel did. not
question Jane: about this demand when they had a chance, so there is no.impeachment:valuc to
anything Mr. ‘Glassman, could say. It-should.also be noted that Ms. Maxwell or Ms.. Menninger
(who represented Ms. Maxwell ini the civil casc), who are both altcady present in the Courtroom,
could testify about any such demand. So 'there:is nothing Mr. Glassman could. offer on this
subject. that-would be probative and. outweigh, the risk: of:possible disclosure of confidential
information inherent in calling Janc's attorney to the witness stand. Additionally, whether a
settlement.demand, would have been made in the civil case against, Ms. Maxwell scems wholly.
irrelevant. as that.civil case settled well over a year before Jane téstificd; that.is, at the time Jane
testified in the:criminal trial, she had:no:financial. incentive to do so.

With regard,to demands to the EVCP, Jane adopts the arguments made by ‘the
Government in.its opposition, and adds again that the civil ease settled long before Jane's
substance of her‘testimony.

Finally, we remind the Court that we belicve that the subpoena.that:was. served on.Mr.
Glassman, was invalid: under Fed. R. Crim. Pro 17, and.that Mr. Glassman is not, currently, under
valid subpoena.

Accordingly, we respectfully request that. the Defendant's motion.to compel. Mr.

Glassman.to testify should be denied.
