should-preclude the. defendant from offering the agreement now:in her:case-in chief.

First, the agreement, was in thedefendant’s possession, custody, and control, long before
trial. The: salé agreement is a contract between. the defendant, herself and third-parties. Ifa copy
of the agreement. was not in her personal possession, :it surely was obtainable through her counsel
in that:transaction—who is expected to testify at, trial.,

Second, as. noted, the theory of 'rclévarice for ‘the salé agreement ‘that the Government:
anticipates has been clear since long before the defendant’s Rule 16 deadline. The Government
expects that the defendant ‘will try to use the agreement ‘to show that she did not purchase: the
1994, when she was 17. (Tr. 1176).

Kate’s' testimony‘was hot.a:surprisc'to the defense. Kate described the home in.an‘interview’
with the: Government ‘on September 1,,2021,.:a. report of which was produced.to the defense on.
Oetober ‘1 |. See 3513-037 at,8 (FBI 302); 3513-038 at 12. (underlying notes). Although Kate did.
not, give ‘the street address, she: idéntified, the house’s location as across the strect from ‘the Nags
Head Pub. That fact-did not.go unnoticed. by:the: defense, which made a point of confirming with.
Kate: on. cross examination specifically that the defendant. lived on ‘Kinnerton Street ‘across from,
the Nags Head Pub—twice. Tr. 1235, 1253-54. Even. before the. Government produced. its 3500
material, the defense previewed. its view that Kate’s timeline is incorrect:and she was older at the
time’ of certain events, than she testified she was. See 11/01/21 Tr. at 89 (“It’s quite possible, in
fact likely, that [Kate] is older than [17].”). The defense. has been planning’ to challenge Kate’s
testimony on.this ‘point, for quite some time, and it. knew that Kate said. she visited the Kinnerton,

Strect home. Yet.the defense:did not.producé the sale agrecment in its Rule 16 production.
