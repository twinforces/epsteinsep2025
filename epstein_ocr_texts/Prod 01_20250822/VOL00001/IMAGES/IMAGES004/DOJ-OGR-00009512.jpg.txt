As the letters reflect, coaching for David is about more than teaching a 12-year-
old to turn a double play, “He wants the kids to develop their athletic . . . skills and [for them] to
be as successful . . . as possible, but he clearly believes that there are things more important than
winning games.” Letter of Charles Austerberry; see also letter of Theresa Parse (“Dave
understands how sports can teach children valuable life lessons”). David relates to each child
individually and gives each a chance to play. When a boy with severe disabilities was on the

gone out of his way to tell my wife Kimberly and me how special

MM is as an athlete and he encourages us to continue his

development. The vast majority of coaches in our community are

screamers and not teachers and are singularly focused on their

[own] kids. Dave is different. I sincerely appreciate the many

hours Dave has spent with my son.
