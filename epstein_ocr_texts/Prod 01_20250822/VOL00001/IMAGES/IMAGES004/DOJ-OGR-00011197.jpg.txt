Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

I write to request that this Court issue an arrest warrant for Kelly Bovino and direct the
U.S. Marshals to detain her until she is willing to give the testimony she has been ordered to
provide.

Ms. Bovino was served with a subpoena on November 30, 2021. Exhibits 1 & 2. The
subpoena was issued by the Clerk of this Court. Ms. Bovino has failed to comply with this
Court’s subpoena and order and is unwilling to testify as the subpoena commands. Testimony by
deposition is not possible.

DOJ-OGR-00011197
