IV. The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Under USSG § 2G1.3(b)(2)(B)

Does Not Apply.

Finally, it would be improper for the Court to apply a two-level enhancement on the
grounds that a participant in the criminal activity “unduly influenced a minor to engage in
prohibited sexual conduct.” USSG § 2G1.3(b)(2)(B). First, it would constitute impermissible
double-counting to apply § 2G1.3(b)(2)(B) to the offense conduct related to “Jane,” Annie
Farmer, and Carolyn because it would punish Ms. Maxwell for the same harm that was fully
accounted for in the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and Six. “Impermissible double
counting occurs when one part of the Guidelines is applied to increase the defendant’s sentence
to reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by another part of the
Guidelines.” United States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d 254, 261 (2d Cir. 2012). Ms. Maxwell was
convicted of conspiring to “entice” and “coerce” minors to travel to engage in prohibited sexual
conduct and “enticing” minors to engage in commercial sex acts. (S2 Ind. 4] 12, 24, 27).'°
Webster’s Dictionary defines the word “entice” to mean “to attract artfully or adroitly or by
arousing hope or desire; tempt” and the further explains that the word “tempt” “implies the
presenting of an attraction so strong that it overcomes the restraints of conscience or better
judgment.”!! Similarly, Webster’s Dictionary defines the word “coerce” to mean “to compel to
an act or choice” and further explains that the word “compel” “typically suggests overcoming of
resistance or unwillingness by an irresistible force.”'* Accordingly, the base offense level for
!0 Count Three charged a conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity. S2 Ind. {f
16-19. Although this offense does not contain an element of “enticement” or “coercion,” the offense conduct for
Counts One, Three, and Five (the three conspiracy counts) was consolidated under Count Three for the purposes of
sentencing, pursuant to the Court’s order. See Dkt. 657.
