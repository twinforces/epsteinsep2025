TV. The Two-Point “Undue Influence’ Enhancement Under’ USSG § 2G1.3(b)(2)(B):
Does Not. Apply.

Finally, it would be improper for the Court to apply a two-level enhancement on-the.
grounds that a participant.in the criminal activity “unduly. influenced.a. minor to-cngage in,

prohibited. sexual conduct.” USSG § 2G1.3(b)(2)(B).. First, it would.constitute impermissible

double-counting:to apply § 2G1.3(b)(2)(B) to the offense conduct related:to “Jane,” Annie:
Farmer, and Carolyn because it would punish.Ms. Maxwell for the same harm that was fully
accounted for in the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and. Six. “Impermissible double
‘counting occurs when one part.of the Guidelines is applicd.to increase the defendant’s sentence
to reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully accounted for by. another:part of the:
Guidelines.” United States v. Watkins, 667 F.3d.254, 261. (2d Cir. 2012)... Ms..Maxwell was:
convicted of conspiring to “entice” and “eoeree” minors to-travel to engage in'prohibited, sexual
conduet:.and “cnticing” minors to engage in.commercial sex acts. (S2 Ind. 12, 24, 27)"
Webster’s Dictionary:defines the word.“enticce” to mean “to attract artfully or.adroitly or by

39 66

‘arousing hope or desire; tempt” and the further explains that the word. “tempt” “implies the
presenting of' an attraction so Strong that:it. overcomes the restraints of conscicnée or better
judgment.”" Similarly, Webster’s Dictionary defines the word “coerce” to mean. “to.compel to
an_act.or choice” and further explains thatthe word “compel” “typically suggests overcoming of,

ere ie

resistance or unwillingness by.an. irresistible: foree.”'~ Accordingly,, the base: offense: level :for

0 Count Three'charged.a conspiracy ’to transport minors-with intent:to, engage in criminal sexual activity. $2 Ind. ¢F
16-19. Although.this offense does not contain.an;element of “enticement” or “coercion,’’the offense conduct for
Counts ‘One, Three, and.Five (the three conspiracy counts) was consolidated-under Count Three forthe purposes of
sentencing; pursuant ‘to the:Court’s order. See Dkt. 657.
