contrast: sharply with other jurors who answered “‘Yes” to Question. 48 and were not-struck for
‘cause, but who:disclosed incidents that were not directly: analogous to the: facts presented.at.trial.

In, this situation, where Juror 50 experienced the same traumatic childhood sexual abuse
that the trial victims did, with many. of the same surrounding circumstances, he was not capable
of setting his experiences aside: and impartially deciding the case solely.on the evidence at trial.
See Dangerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472, (“Courts imply bias. “when, there are similarities between,
the ‘personal experiences of the juror arid :the issues being litigated.’” (quoting Witited States. ¥.
Sampson, 820 F. Supp. 2d 151], 163-64 (D. Mass. 201 1)); Sampson 724 F.3d at 167 (“It would-be

(affirming for cause strike of juror in a. structuring ‘case ‘who: did.not disclose she‘had engaged. in
similar structuring activity. herself); Burton'v. Johnson, 948 F.2d 1150, 1159((10th Cir; 19911)
(affirming grant of'new trial when. juror in. murder case involving domestic violence did:not
disclose she was living ‘in, similarly abusive cireumstances at the time of trial).

Furthermore, Juror 50’s decision to, speak to ‘multiple: members of the international press
after trial to “tell. his story” shows how closely he: identified with the victims in.this case.and
reveals.his bias. Juror 50 testified at the Hearing that he usually does not share his expericnee of,

sexual abuse. (Tr. 22) (“I don’t tell very many’ people.”). Despite his normal reserve, Juror 50
