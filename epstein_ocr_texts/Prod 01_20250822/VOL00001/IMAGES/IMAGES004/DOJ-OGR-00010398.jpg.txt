No. 566.’ The Second Circuit has cautioned that supplemental instructions “enjoy special
prominence in the minds of jurors,” Arroyo v. Jones, 685 F.2d 35, 39 (2d Cir. 1982), and that

Cir. 2014) (quoting United States v. Lefkowitz, 284 F.2d 310, 314 (2d Cir. 1960)). Portions of

As to the third element of Count Two, you must determine whether the Government has proven beyond a

reasonable doubt that the Defendant acted with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within

the state of New York in violation of New York Penal Law 130.55.

As to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the Government has proven beyond a

reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported Jane with the intent that Jane would engage in sexual

activity within the state of New York in violation of New York Penal Law 130.55.

An intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York cannot form the basis of

these two elements of Counts Two and Four.
