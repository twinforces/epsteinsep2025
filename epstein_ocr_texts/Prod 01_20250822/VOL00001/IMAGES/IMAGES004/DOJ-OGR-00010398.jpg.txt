No. 566.” The: Second. Circuit.has cautioned that supplemental instructions “enjoy: special,
‘prominence in’the minds of jurors,” Arroyo Vv. Jones, 685 F.2d 35, 39 (2d Cir. 1982), and that
complete accuracy :is of “crucial importance,” Wnited States v.. Kopstein, 759-F.3d 168,172. (2d.
Cir. 201.4) (quoting United Slates v., Lefkowitz, 284 F.2d 31.0, 3.1.4 (2d'Cir. 1960)). Portions of
the requested ifistruiction ‘were. unresponsive, portions were. redundant, arid ‘portions "were legally

inaccurate. The first:paragraph, which pertained to: Count: Two, was ‘unresponsive to the:jury’s

note that.asked only about:Count Four. The second paragraph was‘unnecessary: because it was
redundant. The Defendant now raises for-the first.time,, in:a. footnote, thatthe: Court.should. have
sua sponte provided the jury this paragraph alone. Maxwell, Reply at.9:n.4. But.the charge’as a.
whole already made clear that a violation of New York Penal Law Section. 130.55 was the key’
inquiry. See Jury Charge at 20, 23, 26, (specifying “a criminal.offense under New York

law”), 24 (Count Two instructions on,New York Penal, Law Scetion.1.30.55), 28 (Count Four.
referring, back to these. instructions), 49-50 (specifying the overt’ act. of Jane traveling “from
Florida to New’York for purposes of'scxually abusing her at.the New: York ‘Residence, in.
violation of New York.Penal Law, Section, 130.55”). Finally; the proposal also, inaccurately

stated that “sexual. activity in-any state other than. New York cannot form the basis” of

TThecrequested instruction-read:
AS to the third clement of Count Two, you must.determine: whether the Government has proven: beyond/a
reasonable. doubt that the.Detendant.acted with. the intent that Jane would ‘engage tin: Sexual activity. within
the: state-of New York-in' violation-of New’ York.Penal Law 130.55.
‘As to the second element of:Count'Four, you must: determine: whether the Government:has’proven. beyond a
reasonable. doubt that the: Defendant transported Jane with-the intent that Jane would engage in. sexual

activity within. the state of New: York in.violation of New: York Penal Law’ 130:55:

An. intent that Jane engage‘in sexual. activity:in any: state-other than New: York cannot form-the basis of.
these two elements of Counts*T.worand.Four.
