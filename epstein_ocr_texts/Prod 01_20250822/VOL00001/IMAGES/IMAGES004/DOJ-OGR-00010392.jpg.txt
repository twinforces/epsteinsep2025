Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document657_ Filed 04/29/22 Page 26 of 45
when Jane was under the age of 17, Jane was enticed to travel from Florida to New York for
purposes of sexually abusing her at the New York Residence, in violation of New York Penal
Law, Section 130.55.” Id. at 49.

The Court also gave two limiting instructions to ensure that the jury’s consideration of
certain relevant evidence was properly focused on the core of criminality. These instructions
pertained to testimony about sexual activity that was not criminal conduct under New York Penal
Law Section 130.55. The first limiting instruction pertained to Kate. This instruction informed
the jury that it could not convict the Defendant on Counts One and Three solely on the basis of
Kate’s testimony because Kate could not be considered a victim of the crimes charged. Trial Tr.
at 1167-68. This was so because she was older than seventeen at the time of the events, and, as
explained, the object of the charged conspiracies was transport with intent to engage in sexual
conduct in violation of New York Penal Law Section 130.55, which criminalizes sexual contact
with individuals under the age of seventeen. See Nov. 1, 2021 Tr. at 67-68. The second limiting
instruction pertained to Annie, who testified about sexual contact in New Mexico only. The
instruction explained that her testimony about sexual conduct did not describe “illegal sexual
activity” as alleged in the Indictment, which was a legal term that the Court would explain at the
end of the case. Trial Tr. at 2048-49. This was so because, as explained, the object of the
charged conspiracies was a violation of New York law, not New Mexico law. Both limiting
instructions explained that the jury could determine that the testimony was relevant evidence.
That was so because such evidence tended to establish the Defendant’s intent that transport of a
minor victim to New York was for the purpose of sexual activity illegal under New York law.
The Defendant concedes this point as to testimony about sexual activity in states other than New
