defendants’ direction. Rubenstein, 403 F.3d at 99. The same analysis applies with equal force
here. Even if the defendant and Epstein were the only two knowing participants—which, as
discussed below, they were not—their joint supervision and organization of a large array of
unknowing participants created an otherwise extensive organization that qualifies for the
enhancement under U.S.S.G. §3B1.1.

Here, the defendant acted as an organizer and leader of a massive operation that spanned
many years. In operating as the lady of the house and as Epstein’s right hand, the defendant was
responsible for overseeing and organizing extensive logistics involved in facilitating the sexual
abuse of multiple minors and ensuring a culture of silence that prevented that scheme from being
uncovered. Epstein and the defendant were two knowing participants who took the lead in
identifying, enticing, and grooming minor girls to be abused. Additionally, Sarah Kellen, who

Beyond those three knowing participants, Virginia and Carolyn both recruited other minor
girls to provide paid sexualized massages to Epstein, thereby furthering the scheme and filling a

836-38). Those duties were essential both to the continued functioning of the scheme, by ensuring
that minor girls were available to be abused, and to the avoidance of detection by ensuring that
