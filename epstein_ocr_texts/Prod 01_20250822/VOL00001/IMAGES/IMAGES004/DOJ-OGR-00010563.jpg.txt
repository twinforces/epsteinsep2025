defendants’ direction. Rubenstein, 403 F.3d at.99. The same analysis applics with equal force
here. Even if the defendant: dnd Epstein were the only two. knowing. participants—which, as
discussed. below, they were: not—thcir. joint supervision. and, organization. of a large array of
unknowing participants created, an otherwise extensive organization, that qualifies ‘for the
enhancement under U.S.S.G. §3BiL.1.

cleaning up the massage ‘room after: Epstcin received ‘sexualized massages, and putting away sex
toys in‘the.defendant’s bathroom after Epstein received scxualized:massages. (PSR.44 24, 57; ‘Tr.
