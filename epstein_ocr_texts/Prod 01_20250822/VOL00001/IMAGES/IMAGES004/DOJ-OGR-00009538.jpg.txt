v. Amodeo,, 44 F.3d.141, 145'(2d Cir. 1995); see-also SUC. v. LheStreet:Com, 273 F.3d 222, 232
(2d Cir. 2001) (noting that, a. “document which is presented to the court. to invoke its powers or
affect its decisions” stands on a “different footing” than items merely passed between ‘partics in
discovery). The defendant’s letter previews her argument onthe merits of Juror 50’s ‘motion. to
intervene, which the partics have not'yet’bricfed, yet ignores that'the:motion 1s a.judicial.document:
whether of not'the. Court'ultimatély grants the motion. See. Lugosch, 435 F.3d.at.121, (rejecting the

The defendant.also argues that Juror 50’s: motion is nota judicial document becausc:it-is a
“discovery request.” First, Juror '50 is ‘not asking for discovery. He is asking for access to his
questionnaire: a document that.he himself prepared and. swore‘undeér penalty of perjury, and:which,
now that trial is‘complete, is maintained under seal principally if not. entirely to protect his ‘own.
privacy. interests. Sec; e.g.,.Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Galifornia, Riverside'Cty., 464 U.S.
501;.511-12 (1984). Second, the cases the defendant cites address whether discovery materials
themselves should be dockcted, not whether a.motion for discovery should be. The:issuc here: is
not whether'the questionnaire, should be docketed, but whether'the motion should be.

Turning to thé balancing factors sct ‘forth in. Lugosch, the defendant has identified. io
privacy: interest implicated by ‘public filing of the motion, nor could she. Instead, the defendant
cites the vague concern that ‘potential ‘witnesses at a hearing may Icarn Juror 50’s, views if the
motion.is unsealed, or that publicity regarding the filing will-prejudice her. This.argument has.no
merit, The orily substantive factual, assertion in the motion is a bricf:statement that, Juror 50 “does

not recall. answering. questions regarding his prior éxpeéricnce ‘with scxual assault,” which, as the:
