SCHEDULE

Potential jurors will be called back for further questioning and jury selection from

Tuesday, November 16, 2021, through Friday, November 19, 2021. Your availability

during that week will be required.

The trial will commence on Monday, November 29, 2021. The trial is expected to last

about six weeks. Generally, trial will be held five days per week, Monday through Friday,

from 9:30 a.m. until 5:00 p.m. Trial will not be held on Friday, December 24, 2021

(Christmas Eve Day) and Friday, December 31, 2021 (New Yearâ€™s Eve).
[f you are selected as a juror, you will be required to be present for the taking of testimony and

evidence for as long as the trial lasts. There are no plans to sequester the jury, which means

you will go home every day after court.

All jury service involves some degree of hardship. Our court and justice system depends on

citizens doing their civic duty to serve as jurors, which involves temporarily putting aside their

regular business for jury service. The Court views service on a jury to be one of the highest

duties a citizen owes to the United States. Mere inconvenience or the usual financial hardship

of jury service will not be sufficient to excuse a prospective juror. You must show |
extraordinary personal or financial hardship to be excused from service.
