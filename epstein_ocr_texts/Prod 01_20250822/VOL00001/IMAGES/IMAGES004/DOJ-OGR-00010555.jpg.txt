Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670_ Filed 06/22/22 Page 20of55
1. The Court, and not the Jury, Determines Which Manual to Apply

The defendant claims that a jury must determine which version of the Sentencing
Guidelines to apply, but the defendant offers not a single case that has ever so held. That argument
is inconsistent with the plain text of the Guidelines and established Second Circuit precedent. The
Court should reject this argument.

As an initial matter, it is well settled that a question of fact that increases a defendant’s
offense level under the Guidelines need not be submitted to a jury. United States v. Fusco, 560 F.
App’x 43, 45-46 (2d Cir. 2014); United States v. Morel, No. 10 Cr. 798 (PAC), 2021 WL 2821107,
at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2021). In addition, with respect to the sentencing court’s determination of
which Guidelines Manual to apply, the text of the Guidelines expressly contemplates that the court
should determine the last date of the conspiracy. Application Note 2 provides the following
example of a calculation of the last date of the offense: “For example, if the offense of conviction
(i.e., the conduct charged in the count of the indictment or information of which the defendant was
convicted) was determined by the court to have been committed between October 15, 1991 and
October 28, 1991, the date of October 28, 1991 is the controlling date for ex post facto purposes.”
U.S.S.G. § 1B1.11(b)(1), app. n.2 (2004) (emphasis added). As the underlined language makes
plain, the Guidelines direct sentencing courts to make this factual determination, and not juries.

As the defendant acknowledges, not one of the cases cited in the defendant’s motion
involved increases in the Sentencing Guidelines, and instead, the defendant rests her argument
entirely on cases involving Ex Post Facto challenges to increases of the applicable statutory
penalties. (Dkt. No. 662 (“Def. Mem.”) at 3-4). The law is clear that, so long as a fact at sentencing
does not increase the statutory maximum or minimum penalty, that fact is for the sentencing court
