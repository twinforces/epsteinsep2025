Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670 Filed 06/22/22 Page 20 of 55

1. The Court, and not,the Jury, Determines Which Manual to Apply

The defendant claims that. a jury must determine which ‘version. of the Sentencing
Guidclines'to apply, but the defendant offers not a single:case that has ever so held. That:argument
Is inconsistent with the plain text ofthe Guidelines and established Second Circuit precedent: The
Court should rejectthis argument.

As an initial matter, it is well scttled that a question of fact that. increases a defendant’s
offense level under'the Guidelines need ‘not be submitted 'to ayjury. United States v. isco, 560 F.
App’x.43,.45-46 (2d Cir. 2014); United States v.. Morel, No. 10. Cr. 798 (PAC), 202.1 WL.2821107,
at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2021). In addition, with respect to the sentencing court’s determination, of
which Guidelines Manual 'to apply,’the text.of the Guidclinés expressly. contemplates that.the court
should. determine the last date of the conspiracy. Application Note 2 provides the: following
example ofa calculation of the last date of the offense: “For example, ifthe offense of conviction,
(/.é., the conduct charged in‘the.count of'the indictment or information of'which the defendant was
convicted) was determined by the court.to have been committed. between October 15, 199, and
October 28, 19911, the date of October’28, 1991 is the controlling date for év.post facto purposes.”
U.S.S.G. § 1B1.11(b)(1), app. n.2 (2004) (emphasis added). As:the underlined language makes
plain, the Guidelines direct. sentencing courts to make this. factual determination, and not juries.

As the defendant acknowledges, not one of the cases. cited, in the defendant’s ‘motion
involved. inereases.:in the: Sentencing Guidelines, and.:instead, the defendant:rests her argument
entirely on. cases involving /x Post acto challenges ‘to increases of the applicable, statutory
penalties. (Dkt.'No. 662 (“Def. Mcm.”) at.3-4). ‘The.law is clear that,'so long as a fact at'sentencing

does not increase'the statutory maximum or minimum, penalty, that fact.is for the sentencing court
