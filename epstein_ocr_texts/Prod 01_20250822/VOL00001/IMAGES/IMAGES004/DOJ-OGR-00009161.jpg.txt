first instance, it,held that the district.court’s decision not-to do'so was within its broad diseretion.
Td, at. 306.

As the: foregoing, cases reflect, given the: dangers of post-verdict hearings into jurors’
conduct, to warrant a, hearing, allegations of impropricty must be “conercte allegations of
inappropriate conduct that constitute competent and relevant cvidence.” Baker, 899: F.3d at 130
(quotation, omitted). .A single, anonymous'sentence found in a newspaper article does not.meet:
that standard. Such a report is classic hearsay and suffers from, the risks ‘inherent: on. relying on,
such information. See:Schering Corp. v. Pfizer Inc., 189 F.3d.218, 232 (2d Cir. 1999) (describing
the “four classes of risk peculiar to this kind of evidence: those of (1) insinecrity, (2) faulty
‘perception, (3) faulty memory and, (4) faulty narration”). As such, in the foregoing cases and,
numerous others, courts have:routincly declined to ‘grant evidentiary hearings based.:solely on.
hearsay statements. See also,.e:g., Wnited.States y. Sattar, 395 F. Supp. 2d 66, 77 (S:D.N-Y. 2005),
aff'd sub nom. United. States -v. Stewart, 390 F.3d 93 (2d Cit. 2009); Daniels ...Hollins, No. CNV-
(02-4495FBLB, 2006'WL, 47412, at.*8 (E:D.N:Y. Jan. 9,.2006); United States v. Menendez, 440 F.
App’x. 906; 9.11+12 (1th Cir. 2011). As one court observed, “to permit: an inquiry based on. such.
scant evidence: in.a.case that continues to reccive: an. unprecedented level of publicity would do
serious damage to the policics that justify limitations on postverdict juror scrutiny.” Sfewart, 31:7
F. Supp. 2d.at 443. So too here.

The Court. should deny the defendant’s request. to expand. the hearing to call. every juror
merely to inquire into a single anonymous'statement in ‘a;newspaper article.

4, The Defendant’s “Discovery” Request Should Be Denied
The Court should. deny the defendant’s motion for. “pre-hearing discovery” in its ‘entirety.

Given the “evil consequences” of post-verdict;juror inquiries, courts may ‘not:permit:such inquirics
