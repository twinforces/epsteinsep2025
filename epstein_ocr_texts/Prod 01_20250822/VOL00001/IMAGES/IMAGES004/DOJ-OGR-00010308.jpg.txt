and his. decision to “tell his. story” to the international press. following,trial. ‘In fact, Juror.'50’s
responses only further;revealed his bias. In,the end, what;was cvident before the: Hearing jis even
more, clear-aftér the Hearing — had, Juror 50 given truthful. answers on the questionnaire, his
‘biases and sympathies would. have been ‘fully explored and. he would:have been challenged, and

had he answered, truthfully, would‘have revealed-his prior sexual, abuse. Question. 48 asked
abuse, orscxual assault?” (Court:Exhibit:#], at.24). Juror S0:had answered.“No.” (/d.). Juror
50, admitted ‘that: this was not an.accurate answer and that:the truthful answer'was “Yes (self)”
‘because he had, ‘in fact, been. sexually abused as:a child by his: stepbrother-and his friend. (Tr. 7-
8). Question 25 asked “Have ‘you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a-victim of
a crime?” (Court.Exhibit#1 at 13). Juror 50 had answered “No.” (/d.). Juror ‘50 admitted. that.
this was not.an accurate: answer and.that the:truthful answer was “Yes (self) because.of the
