throughout the night. When the bright lights were turned off in her cell, bright lights remained on
directly outside her cell; and the flashlight checks continued, a regime completely inappropriate
for a non-suicidal inmate. This unjustified sleep deprivation - which continued throughout trial
and afterward - affected her general physical condition as well as her psychological well-being.
This practice does not exist in general population.

Despite never being in contact with any other inmate, under continuous surveillance by
prison guards and cameras, and escorted to and from any isolated location, she was subjected to
an excessive number of physical searches on a daily basis: pat-down searches, strip searches,
body-cavity searches. She was unnecessarily exposed to radiation from body scanners; and was
fortunate not to contract COVID when guards, who were not required to take COVID tests, looked
and searched inside her mouth. Her cell was searched multiple times daily. The searches were
redundant, unreasonable, unnecessary, and abusive beyond any legitimate penological purpose,
especially where Ms. Maxwell had no opportunity to acquire contraband. See Hodges v. Stanley,
712 F.2d 34, 35-36 (2d Cir. 1983). At times, searches were conducted in inappropriate ways and
were especially painful humiliating and intimidating, as when her breasts and genitalia were
touched in a rough and reckless manner. Reports by Ms. Maxwell and counsel concerning sexually
inappropriate searches by corrections officers went nowhere.

It is clearly established that excessive searches are unnecessary and unreasonable when a
prisoner is isolated from other inmates and never out of range of the camera or a guard. Ms.
Maxwell was searched every time she was removed from or returned to her isolation cell, even
when she had no conceivable opportunity (let alone no intention) to obtain contraband. Clearly,
the search policy is one that was not applied consistently. Having been in general population for
the past two months, Ms. Maxwell has only been searched after contact visits with counsel.
