Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 663 _ Filed 06/15/22 Page 24 of 77

throughout the night. When the bright lights were turned off in her ccll, bright. lights remained. on.
directly outside her:cell; and the flashlight:checks continued, a ‘regime completely inappropriate:

for a non-suicidal inmate. ‘This unjustified sleep deprivation, - which continucd, throughout trial

and afterward - affected her general :physical condition. as well as her psychological well-being.
This practice docs ‘not exist in. gencral. population.

Despite never being ‘in. contact with any other inmate, under continuous, surveillanee by.
prison, guards and cameras, and. escorted ‘to and from any isolated location, she was subjceted to
an. excessive number of physical searches ‘on a daily:‘basis: pat-down searches, strip 'scarches,
body-cavity scarches. She'‘was unnecessarily exposed to radiation from body scanners; and ‘was
fortunate not'to contract‘-COVID when. guards, who werenot required to take COVID tests, looked
and searched inside her mouth. Her cell,.was scarched ‘multiple times. daily. The searches were
redundant, unrcasonable; unnecessary, and, abusive beyond. any Icgitimate penological purpose,
especially where Ms. Maxwell had no opportunity to acquire: contraband. See Hodges v. Stanley,
712 'F.2d 34, 35-36 (2d Cir. 1983). At'times, searches were conducted. in inappropriate ways, and.
were especially painful humiliating, and :intimidating, as when her breasts and. genitalia were
touched:in.a rough and reckless manner. Reports’by:Ms. Maxwell and counsel coneerning'sexually’
‘inappropriate searches by corrections officers, went-nowhcre.

It.is clearly established. that: excessive: searches are unnecessary and unreasonable. when a.
prisoner is isolated. from other, inmates and never out.of range of the camera. or a‘guard. ‘Ms,
Maxwell was séarched. every time she was removed. from or returned to her isolation cell, even
when. she had. no conceivable: opportunity (Ict alone: no intention) to obtain. contraband. ‘Clearly,
‘the search policy’ is. one that: was not applicd consistently. Having been jin, general population, for

the past two months, Ms. Maxwell.has only been:scarched after contact visits with counsel.
