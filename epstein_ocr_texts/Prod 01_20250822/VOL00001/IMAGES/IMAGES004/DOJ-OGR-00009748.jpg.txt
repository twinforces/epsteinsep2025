Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document642 Filed 03/11/22 Page 56 of 66
c. Non-privileged emails or other written communications between Juror
No. 50 and any other person, including any news or media organization
about Juror No. 50’s service as a juror in this case;
d. Any record of payments to Juror No. 50 in exchange for any interview
or information about his service as a juror in this case;
2. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram, or other social media networking
platforms identified by the parties, to produce:
a. All communications to and from Juror No. 50 regarding his service as a
juror in this case;
b. All posts, comments, or photographs posted by Juror No. 50 regarding
his service as a juror in this case.
c. All documents reflecting dates on which Juror No. 50 opened or closed
his accounts.
B. The hearing itself
The misconduct identified potentially implicates all 12 jurors who rendered a
verdict here. According to Juror No. 50 and the New York Times, one other juror did not
disclose that he or she was the victim of sexual abuse as a child. Nevertheless, that juror’s
experiences were discussed apparently in support of Juror No. 50’s position. What these
two jurors disclosed to the (presumably) ten jurors who responded to the questionnaire
truthfully will be relevant to determine the identity of the second juror and what Juror No.
50 said to the other jurors.
