In, the end, under. MeDonongh, Langford, Siéwartand Greer, a deliberately false answer

C. Juror No. 50’s answers were. deliberately false.

Even so, the record more than. supports the conclusion that Juror’ No. 50’s answers to
Questions 25 and 48 (not:to mention his answers during in-person. voir dire about:social:media
usc) were deliberately false. Juror No. 50. knew he was the victim.of'a, crime. He was a
prospective juror.in.a ¢asé ‘where the accused was on trial for alleged sexual misconduct with,
minors. Ass the childhood victim, of a. scx crime, answering questions in.a casc about a childhood
sex crime, there isno, plausible explanation for why Juror-No..50 did not answer:Question, 25;
“Yes.” The only believable answer is that he knew that answering that :question “Y-ces” would
lead to further questions like, what’was the crime, which would then. Iead-to questions ‘about, what.

happened. to him, which would end‘with his disqualification.

TA. deliberately false answer by a juror in. voir dire is'thus ncither, necessary nor sufficient
to entitle a defendant toa new trial. It’s not necessary’ because, if'a biased juror actually serves
ona jury, structural, crror occurs, and.a, new ‘trial’is required. even if the juror did not provide a
deliberately false answer during voirdire. Martinez=Salazar, 528 U.S. at 316;,MeDonough, 464
US. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring); id. at 557-58 (Brennan, J., Concurring in. judgment);
Smith, 455 U.S. at 215-16; id. at 220-24 (O° Connor, J., concurring); Stewart, 433. F.3d.at 303;
Greer, 285 F.3d t 171-72; Langford, 990 F.2d.at: 68. And it’s not-sufficient’because a juror may
not be biased. even if he dishonestly answers.a question during voir dire. Greer, 285 F.3d at 173
(“[A]n analysis of bias is ‘required even if the juror’s, crroncous response was deliberate. »).
