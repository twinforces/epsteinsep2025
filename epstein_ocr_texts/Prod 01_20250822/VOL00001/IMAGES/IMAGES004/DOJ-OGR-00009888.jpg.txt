explained in the motion, the “deliberateness” of a prospective juror’s “particular lies [may]
evidence[] partiality’”®—think of a juror who deliberately lies because of a desire to sit on a jury
and punish one of the parties to the case—but the lack of a deliberately false answer does not
prove the absence of partiality.

In the end, under McDonough, Langford, Stewart and Greer, a deliberately false answer
is not required.’

C. Juror No. 50’s answers were deliberately false.

Even so, the record more than supports the conclusion that Juror No. 50’s answers to
Questions 25 and 48 (not to mention his answers during in-person voir dire about social media
use) were deliberately false. Juror No. 50 knew he was the victim of a crime. He was a
prospective juror in a case where the accused was on trial for alleged sexual misconduct with
minors. As the childhood victim of a sex crime, answering questions in a case about a childhood
sex crime, there is no plausible explanation for why Juror No. 50 did not answer Question 25,
“Yes.” The only believable answer is that he knew that answering that question “Yes” would
lead to further questions like, what was the crime, which would then lead to questions about what
happened to him, which would end with his disqualification.

7 A deliberately false answer by a juror in voir dire is thus neither necessary nor sufficient
to entitle a defendant to a new trial. It’s not necessary because, if a biased juror actually serves
on a jury, structural error occurs, and a new trial is required even if the juror did not provide a
deliberately false answer during voir dire. Martinez-Salazar, 528 U.S. at 316; McDonough, 464
US. at 556-57 (Blackmun, J., concurring); id. at 557-58 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment);
Smith, 455 U.S. at 215-16; id. at 220-24 (O’Connor, J., concurring); Stewart, 433 F.3d at 303;
Greer, 285 F.3d t 171-72; Langford, 990 F.2d at 68. And it’s not sufficient because a juror may
not be biased even if he dishonestly answers a question during voir dire. Greer, 285 F.3d at 173
(“[A]n analysis of bias is required even if the juror’s erroneous response was deliberate.”).
