1 throughout this process, this rule is very, very important.

2 That's because your decision in this case must be made solely

3 on the evidence or lack of evidence presented at this trial.

4 In other words, all that you need to know will be presented

a here in open court by the parties. This is critically

6 important to ensuring a fair trial, which I know that all of

7 you would want if you were a party in this court, and I have no
8 doubt it's what you want for the parties who are here today. I
9 expect you to inform me immediately through Ms. Williams if you
10 become aware of another juror's violation of these

11 instructions.

12 Finally, each of you either has or will be given a

13 notebook and pen; and that's because I do permit jurors to take
14 notes. But you don't have to take notes. Notes are just an

15 aid to your own recollection. The court reporters in this case
16 record everything that's said in the courtroom, and any portion
17 of the testimony can be read back to you during your

18 deliberations. If you do take notes, be aware that note-taking
19 may distract you from something important that's happening on
20 the witness stand. Whether or not you take notes, rely on your
21 own recollections and don't be influenced by the fact that
22 another juror has taken notes. If you do take notes, all notes
23 must be left each day in the jury room. Ms. Williams will make
24 sure that they are secure.
25 From this point until the time when you retire to
