note asking a similar question about Annie Farmer’s testimony. See Court Exhibit # 9 (“Can we
consider Annie’s testimony as conspiracy to commit a crime in Counts One and Three?”). But
the Jury Note did not say that, nor did it contain the phrase “in part.” Instead, the Jury Note
asked a much more specific question about whether the jury could convict Ms. Maxwell on
Count Four if it found that she (1) intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New Mexico
and (2) aided with Jane’s return flight from New Mexico, but not her flight to New Mexico. The
government’s speculation about what the jury may have meant cannot alter the clear text and
meaning of the Jury Note, which revealed that the jury fundamentally misunderstood the intent
requirement necessary for Count Four and needed to be given a supplemental instruction to
remedy the confusion.?

B. The Court Erred When It Declined to Give the Jury a Supplemental

Instruction Clarifying the Intent Requirement for Count Four.

The Court further erred when it declined to give the jury a supplemental instruction, as
requested by the defense, clarifying the intent requirement for Count Four — namely, that the
government had to prove that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New
York. The Jury Note showed not only that the jury had a mistaken understanding of the law
concerming intent, but also indicated that the jury might convict Ms. Maxwell on Count Four
based an alternative theory of guilt not charged in the Indictment. At that point, it was the
responsibility of the Court to give the jury a supplemental instruction “to enable it to assess the
evidence within the proper legal framework and to reach a rational verdict” and to avoid a
constructive amendment of the charges. Parker, 903 F.2d at 101; see also Gross, 2017 WL
3 The government chides the defense for engaging in speculation about what the jury may have been thinking before
sending the Jury Note. (Opp. 17-19). The defense engaged in that discussion to explain why the proof at trial may
have led the jury to focus on Jane’s testimony about the conduct in New Mexico with respect to Count Four. But the
Court need not rely on that analysis. The Jury Note speaks for itself. The jury was focused on Jane’s abuse in New
Mexico and misunderstood the intent requirement necessary to convict under Count Four.
