note asking a, similar question about Annie’ Farmer’s testimony. See’Court Exhibit # 9 (“Can-we
consider Annic’s testimony as conspiracy to commit a crime in Counts One and Three?”). But
the Jury Note did not.say:that, nor did.it contain.the:phrase “in-part.” Instead, the Jury.Note

asked a: much more specific question about whether, the jury could convict Ms. Maxwell on

government’s speculation about:what the jury may have meant: cannot. alter the cleartext and.
meaning of the Jury.Note, which revealed that the jury fundamentally misunderstood the :intent
requirement. necessary for Count'Four and:needed-to be given a‘supplcmental instruction to
remedy the confusion.*

B. The Court Erred. When It Declined to Give the Jury a Supplemental
Instruction Clarifying the Intent Requirement: for Count Four.

The Court further erred when ‘it declined to give'the jury a supplemental instruction, as
requested by the defense, clarifying the intent requirement forCount Four — namely, that the
government had to’prove that.Ms. ‘Maxwell intended ‘for Jane to engage in sexual activity in New
York. The Jury Note showed not.only that the jury’ had a-mistaken‘understanding of the law
‘concerning intent, but.also indicated that the jury might:convict:Ms. Maxwell on Count Four
based an.alternative theory of guilt: not charged in the Indictment. At that; point, it-was the
responsibility of:the Court'to give the jury: a. supplemental instruction “to cnable it to assess the
evidence within the proper legal framework and, to reach a, rational verdict” and.to avoid.a,

constructive amendment of the charges. Parker, 903, F.2d at 101; see also Gross, 2017 WL

’ The government chides the defense for engaging in’speculation:about, what thezjury, may have’ been thinking’ before
‘sending the:Jury Note. (Opp. 17-19). The defense: engaged.in. that discussion‘to explain why the‘proof at trial may.
havetled the jury to: focus‘on Jane’s testimony about the:conduct.in’New Mexico with*respect'to Count Four. But:the
Court:need:notirely on that.analysis., The:Jury Note ‘speaks: for itself. The jury was focused-on Jane’s abuse int!New
Mexico‘and.misunderstood.the intent requirement:necessary, to convict under Count.Four.
