Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document653 _ Filed 04/01/22 Page 13 of 40

The parties dispute whether the first: prong of McDonough requires “deliberate juror
‘misconduct”—that is, Whether the juror must: have. deliberately provided a false answer in Vorr
dire. The Government, relying on Second Circuit:precedent:such.as United States 'v. Shaoul,
argues that a deliberate: falschood ‘is required. Gov. Br. at 13 (citing Shaoul, 41 F.3d at 81'S—16).
In contrast, the Defendant contends ‘that McDonough docs not require deliberateness arid ‘that.an
inadvertent falsc statement satisfics the first prong. Maxwell ‘Br. at 23-28; Maxwell ‘Reply: at 9-
14, Dkt. No. 644. ‘The Court-does not resolve this legal dispute because, as explained in the
analysis scction below, :rcgardlcss of which approach. is the correct ‘one, the Court finds:that-the
false answers were not deliberate und that. the second:prong of McDonough is not satisfied.

Unider the sécond ‘prong of MeDonoiigh, the Court “must determine if it would have
‘granted. the hypothetical challenge” for cause if the juror. had.responded accurately. United
States vy. Greer, 285 F.3d,158, 171 (2d. Cir. 2002); United States v. Stewart, 433: F.3d 273, 304
(2d Cir. 2006). “Challenges, for'cause. ate generally based, on-actual. bias, implied bias, or
and. there’ is overlap (and sometimes confusion) in, how they. are discussed in:some of the cases.
Nevertheless, it is:important to attempt to.delincate. .Actual bias:is “bias in fact,” due cither-to
the juror admitting partiality or a judge finding actual partiality’based on the juror’s. voir dire
answers. Wnited States. Torres, 128. F.3d,38, 43 (2d.Cir. 1997). linplied bias is “bias
presumed as.a matter of.law” due to a juror’s relationship to the partics.or connection to the
actual. crime ‘itself. Greer, 285 F.3d_at, 171-72. Finally, a judge: may infer bias, when actual or
implied bias does not apply. “Bias may’be inferred when a juror discloses a fact'that' bespcaks.a

risk of partiality sufficiently significant to ‘warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse

“In an amicus curiac brief, the. National. Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.also argues that delibcrateness is
notrequired under WeDonough. See.Dkt. No. 614.
