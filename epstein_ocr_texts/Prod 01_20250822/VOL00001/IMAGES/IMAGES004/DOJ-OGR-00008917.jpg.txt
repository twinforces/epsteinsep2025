Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document597 Filed 02/11/22 Page2of5
permitted to file an amicus brief not exceeding 10 double-spaced pages. Any authorized amicus
brief must be emailed to the Court for docketing within one week of the Court’s granting of the
motion for leave to file.

The Court provides one note of caution regarding timing. As of Wednesday, February 9,
2022, the Defendant’s motion for a new trial became fully briefed. Although the timing of the
Court’s ruling on the motion cannot be predicted at this time, the Court will rule as expeditiously
as possible. The Court will not delay issuing a ruling if ready to do so simply because an
authorized amicus brief is forthcoming.

If NACDL still seeks leave to file an amicus brief, it may submit a renewed motion
consistent with this Order.

SO ORDERED.
