identical form’ and it has also adopted Rule 3.5(d). These rules mandate disclosure of certain
information to a court even if disclosure may harm the client and, for Rule 3.3 explicitly and
Rule 3.5(d) implicitly, even if the information is protected as confidential client information. See
New York Rule 3.3(c).* But the duty arises only if the lawyer has “actual knowledge.”
13. A second decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and
duties to a litigation opponent or the tribunal. In re Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d 86 (24
Cir. 2003) was an appeal of Rule 11 sanctions. When a party seeks Rule 11 sanctions, the target
of the motion has a 21-day “safe harbor” within which to withdraw or correct the challenged
submission. If it does not, the “mental state applicable to liability for Rule 11 sanctions is
objective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 90. When, however, a court initiates a sanction proceeding,
as by order to show cause, there is no safe harbor. Because the lawyer cannot take it back,
Pennie & Edmonds holds that the required mental state is “bad faith,” a subjective test like actual
knowledge. The Court explained that “[a]ny regime of sanctions for a lawyer’s role in the course
of representing a client inevitably has implications for the functioning of the adversary system.”
Id. In support of its holding, the Court cited the interest of “[a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.
at 91.
14. ‘In sum, from the perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises of our
“vigorous adversary system” control unless the situation is governed by an express exception in
ethics rules, statutes, judicial decisions, or other law. These exceptions, which are written with
appreciation of the need for precision, give lawyers notice of the duties that ovetride their
adversarial obligations. As the Supreme Court wrote in a different context in Polk County v.
Dodson, 454 U.S. 312 (1981):
Within the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a
personal counselor and advocate. It is often said that lawyers are “officers of the court.”
But the Courts of Appeals are agreed that a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue
of being an officer of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the
meaning of § 1983. In our system a defense lawyer characteristically opposes the
designated representatives of the State. The system assumes that adversarial testing will
ultimately advance the public interest in truth and fairness. But it posits that a defense
lawyer best serves the public, not by acting on behalf of the State or in concert with it, but
rather by advancing “the undivided interests of his client.”
Id. at 318 (footnotes omitted). The question I turn to now is whether lawyers from Brune &
Richard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by
not disclosing certain information prior to their July 21, 2011, letter to the Court.

“The ABA Model Rules do not contain Rule 3.5(d). In my view, its mandate appears duplicative of a
lawyer's obligations under New York and Model Rule 3.3(b).
