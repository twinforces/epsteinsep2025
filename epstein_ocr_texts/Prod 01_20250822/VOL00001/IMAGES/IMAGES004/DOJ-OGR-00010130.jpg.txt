identical form? and it has'also adopted Rule 3.5(d):. These:rules mandate disclosure 6f cértain
information toa court even if disclosure may: harm the client and, for Rule 3. 3 explicitly and

New York Rule 3. 3(c).* But the duty arises: only ifthe lawyer has “actual knowledge.”

13. A-second:decision also recognizes the delicate balance between the adversary system and
duties to.a litigation. opponent or the tribunal. ‘Inte Pennie & Edmonds LLP, 323 F.3d.86 (2
Cir. 2003):was an-appeal of Rule 1.1. sanctions. When a party seeks'Rule 11 sanctions, the'target
of the:motion has a.21-day “safe harbor” within ‘which ‘to withdraw or:correct'the challenged
submission. If it does.not, the “mental state applicable to lability for Rule 11 sanctions is
objective unreasonableness.” Jd. at 90. When; however, 'a.court:initiates a sanction proceeding,
as by order to show cause, there'is no safe-harbor. Because the. Jawycr-cannot take it back,

Pennie & Edmonds holds that the requiréd méntal state is “bad faith,” a subjective 'test like actual
‘knowledge. The Court explained that’ “{aJny regime of sanctions fora lJawyer’s role:in the course
of representing a-client inevitably has implications: ‘forthe functioning, of the adversary system.”
Jd. \n support ofits holding, the:Court cited theinterest.of “{a] vigorous adversary system.” Id.
at.91.

14. ‘Insum, fromthe: perspective of a lawyer’s ethical obligations, the premises.of our
“wigorous adversary system”*control unless. the situation:is governed. by.an express exception in
‘ethics rules; statutes, judicial decisions, or: other law. These exceptions, which are written with
appréciation of the need for precision, give’ lawyers notice of. the duties that ovetride their:
adversarial obligations..As the Supreme Court'wrote in.a:different:context in Polk:County v.
Dodson, 454 U:S. 312 (1981): ~

Within ‘the context of our legal system, the duties of a defense lawyer are those of a
personal counselor'and advocate. It is often said.that lawyers:.are “officers ofthe court.” _
But the Courts of Appeals are agreed that:a lawyer representing a client is not, by virtue —
of being: an officer-of the court, a state actor “under color of state law” within the:
“meaning of § 1983. In our system a defense: lawyer characteristically:opposes the
designated representatives of the State. The system assumes’ that. adversarial testing: will
ultimately.advance:the public: interest'in truth and fairness: But it posits that:a defense
lawyer best'serves the public, not by. acting on behalf of the State or'in concert‘with it, but
rather by advancing'“the undivided -interests-of his client.”

Id. at 318 (footnotes omitted). The queéstion I turn to how is whether lawyers from/Brune &

Richard LLP acted in violation of any of the exceptions to their duties in the adversary system by’
not disclosing certain information prior‘to.their July 21, 2011, letter tothe Court.
