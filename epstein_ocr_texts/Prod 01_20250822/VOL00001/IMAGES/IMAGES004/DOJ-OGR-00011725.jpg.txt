LBTVMAX3 Opening â€”- Ms. Sternheim

1 fund is making a claim against Epstein or others of his

2 employees.

3 Now, the fund, administered by some of the same folks
4 that administered the September 11th compensation fund, is

a) different in this regard: 9/11, there was hard proof of what

6 happened to victims. Here, it is based on the memories which

7 we think the evidence will show is unreliable and suspect,

8 memories that will be the subject of this trial. But the

9 claims that were made to the fund, as I said before, were not
10 contested and they were not put before you, a jury, to decide
11 whether they are credible.

12 Let's talk about those four accusers. As I said

13 before, it's Jane, Annie, Kate, and Carolyn.

14 Here's what we expect the evidence is going to show

15 about Jane: Yes, she was and is a talented musician anda

16 singer from a musical family. And Epstein, a patron of the

17 arts and a supporter of young talent, sponsored musicians and
18 artists and actresses and others, and he offered to become her
19 benefactor. He paid for her school, he paid for her vocal
20 lessons, he paid or at least cosigned for a Wall Street
2l apartment that Jane lived in with her mother and her brothers
22 while she went to a prestigious professional school in New York
23 City.
24 Jane and two of her brothers, the ones closest in
25 age -- she has three older siblings from her mother's first
