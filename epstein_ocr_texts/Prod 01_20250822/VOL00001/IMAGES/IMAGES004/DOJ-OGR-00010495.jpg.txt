Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 663 Filed 06/15/22 Page 49 of 77
Ghislaine is educated and hard-working. She found her passion in life at aged 50, when she poured
her heart and soul into setting up and running a non-profit environmental organization, The
TerraMar Project. During its development, Ghislaine reached out to me for educational and
publishing advice. One measure of its success is evidenced in the major collaborations with entities
and organizations, such as National Geographic and Oxford University, that she managed to secure.
These recognized leaders could not afford to be linked to anything but the most reputable entities,
which is how they viewed Ghislaine’s endeavor. Each allowed their logos/names to be associated
on the public TerraMar website.

Ghislaine is a caring person. The goals that she set for TerraMar were laudable and reflect her
concern for the well-being of humanity. The only reason she was compelled to close down the
Project was to protect the supporting individuals and groups from being hounded and starting to be
vilified by the Press after her arrest. I know that Ghislaine still very much wants to find more ways
to give back to society.
We live in a world where malicious envy of people seen to have wealth and perceived ‘undeserved’
social position in life, is perfect fodder for selling newspapers and filling social media platforms
with gaudy, single faceted views. Ghislaine had money because she worked very hard to earn it. Her
positions demanded hard, diligent work, great intelligence, great management skills, great ability to
get on well with people from all walks of life, artistic creativity, and caring about others. Her work
was a far cry from the ‘flippity-jibit socialite’ label that the media has decided to cast on her every
time they reference her.
Iam asking you to consider a lesser sentence for my sister Ghislaine. If Ghislaine is able to regain
freedom while she still has all her faculties, [ know she has much to still offer in dedicating the rest
of what is left of her life to advocacy to helping others. Thank you for your consideration of all the
points in my letter that speak to the worthiness of Ghislaine’s contributions and abilities, and to her
truly wanting to make a positive difference again if given the opportunity to do so.
Respectfully,
