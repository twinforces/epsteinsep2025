Shaoul. Thus, ‘in, the Second. Circuit,’ it is a, “threshold requirement” to establish that a juror
intentionally lied or consciously déccived the court. Sée Shaoiils 41 F.3d at 815; Nix, 275 F. Supp.
3d at 437; Sattar, 395 F. Supp. 2d.at 72. (“The failure to answer honestly must be deliberate; a
‘juror’s good faith failure ‘to respond, though, mistaken, [does] not satisfy even, the ‘first prong of
the test.”” (quoting Shaoil, 41,.F.3d at 815)); United States v. Ruggiero, No. 97 Civ. 2925 (HB),
diré, concluding “it is not: clear that; [the juror’s] failure to respond to the Court’s question was a.
deliberate ‘attempt at.dishonesty, as: she only’ failed. to answer ‘the court’s :question.”); Peres v.
Manhattan.Jeep Eagle, No. 92 Civ. 952.1 (DLE), 1997: WL 403458, at,*5 (S.D.N.Y. July 17, 1997)
(“[T]he first. prong of the test requires a determination of'whether juror number one deliberately’
lied to the Court during voir dire, or whether his answer was the result of a good. faith.
misunderstanding of the question.’’)..

In. sum, to satisfy ‘the. first prong ‘of ‘the governing test, the defendant must ¢stablish.
dishonesty’by Juror 50—a.deliberate falschood or deccit, rather than an honest mistake.

b. The Current Record Does Not Support.a Finding of Deliberate:
Falsehood

On the current record, there .is no basis ‘for the Court. to find that Juror 50 gave any’
deliberately. false: answer during ‘voir dire. ‘To be sure; if his public statements regarding being a,

victim. of sexual. abuse: were truthful,” it would. appear that Juror 50: answered ‘Question. 48

” While some circuits have reached a different. result, the Second Circuit’s view’ appears to be the
prevailing one. See; ¢.g., Fitsgerald.\. Greené, 150 F.3d.357, 3647.3 (4th Cir. 1998) (collecting
cascs).

' Ttis-of course possible that Juror 50’s unsworn ‘public statements were not truthful, while his
sworn answers on the questionnaire were. This is a threshold. fact that must be determined at.a.
hearing. But:for purposes. of discussion in, this. bricf, the Government:.assumes that. Juror:'S0’s
public statements on this subject were truthful.
