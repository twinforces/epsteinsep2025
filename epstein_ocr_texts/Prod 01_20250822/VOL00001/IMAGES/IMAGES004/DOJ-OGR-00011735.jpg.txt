LBTVMAX3 Opening - Ms. Sternheim

There ‘will not be substantive evidence that stipports the
charges. The exhibits that the government is. going to claim
corroborates, will not and will not overcome their burden.
They will not overcome reasonable doubt,

And the Stories of the ‘individual accusérs cannot be
used to corroborate other accusers' stories; they are personal

stories to them, Thé government is trying to stitch together

stories of four different people,. four different stories to
support a pattern. The only pattern that ‘you will See here is
the success of those four people getting big money rewards from
tHe Epstein fund.

Each accuser's story is thin; it lacks support. It"s
like taking paper cuté6uts ahd putting them together, cutouts
that, can't stand on their own, even lanked together cannot
substantiate and stand and will nét support the charges here
beyond a reasonable doubt.

I ask you to scrutinize Glosély all 6f the évidence,
all of the exhibits, all of the documents, but pay particular
attention to those four accusers. They have been impactéd by
Lawyers, by media, by things they have read, and, things they
have Heard, and by money, big bucks. Ahd I ask you again, in
evaluating them and, listening ‘to them, filoocus on memory,
manipulation, and money. Evdluate each of them for
credibility, plausibility, reliability.
