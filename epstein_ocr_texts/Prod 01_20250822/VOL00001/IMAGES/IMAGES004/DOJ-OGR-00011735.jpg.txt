LBTVMAX3 Opening â€”- Ms. Sternheim

1 There will not be substantive evidence that supports the

2 charges. The exhibits that the government is going to claim

3 corroborates, will not and will not overcome their burden.

4 They will not overcome reasonable doubt.

5 And the stories of the individual accusers cannot be

6 used to corroborate other accusers' stories; they are personal
7 stories to them. The government is trying to stitch together

8 stories of four different people, four different stories to

9 support a pattern. The only pattern that you will see here is
10 the success of those four people getting big money rewards from
11 the Epstein fund.

12 Bach accuser's story is thin; it lacks support. It's
13 like taking paper cutouts and putting them together, cutouts

14 that can't stand on their own, even linked together cannot

15 substantiate and stand and will not support the charges here

16 beyond a reasonable doubt.

17 IT ask you to scrutinize closely all of the evidence,
18 all of the exhibits, all of the documents, but pay particular
19 attention to those four accusers. They have been impacted by
20 lawyers, by media, by things they have read and things they
21 have heard, and by money, big bucks. And I ask you again, in
22 evaluating them and listening to them, focus on memory,
23 manipulation, and money. Evaluate each of them for
24 credibility, plausibility, reliability.
