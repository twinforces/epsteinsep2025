Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document621 Filed 02/25/22 Page 30 o0f51

The defendant asks the Court. to ignore these'legal distinctions., In particular, the-defendant.
urges the Courtitiot to apply the first Korfant factor, claiming—without. éxplanation—that‘this first:
factor applies to claims arising from successive prosecutions, and not multiplicity claims. (Def.
Mot. at-22'n.4). ‘But ‘the Korfant factors are applicd both when courts compare indictments in,
Successive prosccutions and ‘when. courts. ailalyze coufts in the same indictment.’ See, eg,
multiple conspiracy counts in the same! indictment); United States v. Diallo, 507 F. App’x 89, 91
(2d Cir. 2013) (holding that two narcotics conspiracy. counts charged in the same. case were: not
multiplicitous ‘under the: Korfant factors); Estrada, 320 F:3d at 180-81 (applying the Korfant
factors to a successive prosecution); Sattar, 3:14 E. Supp. 2d at: 307 (applying the Korfant factors
to a successive prosecution). ‘For good.:reason: it would make little sense to ‘ignore ‘the legal
distinctions. between ‘counts when, determining whether'those counts are different in, law and fact.
for double. jcopardy purposes. See United States v. Hicks, 5 F.Ath,270, 275.(2d Cir. 20211) (citing,
Blockburger vy. United. States, 284 U:S.'299.(1932)). The defendant:asks this ‘Court to ignore the:
first.Korfant factor because itis fatal to her'multiplicity claim. The two counts, are. lcgally. distinct,

and the Court can and should reject the .defendant’s multiplicity claim-for this: reason. alone:

7 The lone. case citéd by' the defendant, United States v. Cooper, 886.F.3d 146 (D.C. Cir. 2018),
held. that two § 37.1 counts in the: same ‘indictment. were ‘multiplicitous. (Def. Mot. at. 22 n. 4). In.
reaching that: conclusion, the Court did not hold that the first Korfant factor was inapplicable: to
that ‘particular, procedural posture. The defendant otherwise cites no casein which a court held,
‘that it ‘was, inappropriate to cxamine the legal differences between counts when cvaluating a,
multiplicity claim.
