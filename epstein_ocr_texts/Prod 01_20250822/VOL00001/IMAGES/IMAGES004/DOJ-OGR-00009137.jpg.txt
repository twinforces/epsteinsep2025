inaccurately. But, as noted, that is not the end of the inquiry. And based on the currently available
information, there is substantial reason to believe that any inaccuracy was an honest mistake, not
a deliberate falsehood.

Juror 50’s only statements on the subject to date undermine the defendant’s claim that he
lied. Juror 50 has publicly stated that he “flew through” the questionnaire and did not recall being
asked about his own history of sexual abuse. (Gov’t Ex. C at 3). He repeatedly stated that he
believed he had answered all the questions honestly. (Gov’t Ex. A at 4; Gov’t Ex. B at 8; Gov’t
Ex. C at 3). Indeed, when asked by an interviewer about whether he had disclosed his history of
sexual abuse on the questionnaire, he confidently replied: “No, they don’t ask your sexual abuse
history.” (Def. Ex. 3 at :21). When the interviewer said that Question 48 asks about sexual abuse
history, Juror 50 responded, in a puzzled tone, “I don’t remember.” (/d. at :35). He continued, “I
would have definitely marked ‘yes’ but I honestly don’t remember that question.” (Jd. at :54).
The defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 50 apparently began blushing, but that reaction
is perfectly consistent with someone realizing they had just made a serious though honest mistake.

Indeed, Juror 50 remembered a question about a family member or relative being sexually
abused. (/d. at 1:09). And Question 48 asks: “Have you or a friend or family member ever been
the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” This question was nearly the
last ina lengthy questionnaire composed of 51 questions, many with multiple sub-questions. Thus,
a juror who was indeed flying through the questionnaire may have, by the 48" question (not
including sub-questions), failed to notice that this question also asked about personal experiences.
Though careful lawyers may have difficulty crediting that explanation, jurors can and do make
mistakes. See, e.g., McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555 (“[J]urors are not necessarily experts in English
usage. Called as they are from all walks of life, many may be uncertain as to the meaning of terms
