would.prevent, him from being fair or impartial., As discussed-above, the minor discrepancies
raised by the Defendant .do not alter this assessment.’

Nor was Juror 50’s inaccurate answer to Question ‘25 unreasonable: He:testificd that he:
‘understood. the question.to ask whether he “was robbed or mugged or, some sort of crime like
that,” and that he did not'think of his. history of “sexual, abuse as beitig,a victim, ofa crime.”
Hearing Tr. at 10, Because neither he nor a friend. or family member had'been robbed or mugged.
or been the ‘victim of asimilar type of crime, he testified, he answered. “No” to, Question 25.

‘That interpretation:of what it mcans to be.a victim of a:crime, while technically incorrect, does
not. evince intentional, deception, or partiality. Cf United States v. Fell, No. 2:01-CR-12,.2014
WL 3697810, at: *7, *13 (D. Vt. July 24, 2014) (creditinig the explanation ofa juror that was
sexually abused.as.a.child. that. she “ha[d] not. considered [herself] a victim of a crime:in all these
years,” in part because the, abuser was “not-convicted of any crime”); McDonough, 464 US at:
555.(“[JJurors are not riccessarily experts, in English usage. Called. as they are from.all walks of
life, many may’be uncertain as to: the meaning of terms which arc relatively: casily understood by
lawyers ‘and judges.”). Evidently, other prospective jurors similarly. ‘interpreted Question 25 to
not refer to uncharged incidents of scxual.abusc.. .For example, JurorC disclosed being {|
[ J” inresponse to Question 48, but in response to Question
25, reported only that:a family member was mugged. See Juror © Questionnaire.

In.sum, the Court concludes that Juror 50.is. not :implicdly or inferably biased.

® The. Defendant also notes'that Juror. 50 apparently:posted-on social:media‘about‘attending therapy to help“deal[]
with the: stress.of the [Maxwell] case.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 9; see also Maxwell Br.at.20. Itis perfectly
reasonable for‘a juror‘to. go to:therapy‘and.use-of such services does not disqualify a citizen from-service. In fact,
courts in-this:district routinely make counscling services available to jurors following;the completion ofa trial.
