Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document615_ Filed 02/24/22 Page 27 of 49

Keeping with that “narrow” view of implied bias, the Second Circuit has “consistently
refused to create a set of unreasonably constricting presumptions that jurors be excused for cause
due to certain occupational or other special relationships which might bear directly or indirectly
on the circumstances of a given case, where . . . there is no showing of actual bias or prejudice.”
Torres, 128 F.3d at 46 (quotations and citations omitted). For example, the Second Circuit has
declined to follow a Ninth Circuit precedent stating that it was error not to excuse two bank tellers
as jurors in a bank robbery case. United States v. Brown, 644 F.2d 101, 104-05 (2d Cir. 1981)
(declining to follow United States v. Allsup, 566 F.2d 68 (9th Cir. 1977)); see also Mikus v. United
States, 433 F.2d 719, 724 (2d Cir. 1970) (similar). And it has held that a juror’s prior service at a
trial involving similar but unrelated offenses which involved the testimony of a common witness
does not give rise to implied bias. See United States v. Garcia, 936 F.2d 648, 652 (2d Cir. 1991);
see also Curry v. Lynch, 323 F. App’x 63, 65 (2d Cir. 2009) (rejecting argument that a juror had
implied bias because he owned a printing business that did business with defense counsel).

Here, there is no suggestion that Juror 50 is related to a party in this case, or that he is a
victim of or has any personal knowledge of the defendant’s crimes. Accordingly, the
circumstances of this case do not fall within the narrow categories of implied bias that the Second
Circuit has recognized. This is not one of the rare, extreme circumstances where a mandatory
presumption of bias may be applied. See, e.g., Torres, 128 F.3d at 45; Greer, 285 F.3d at 172.

The defendant principally argues that implied bias should be found based on alleged
similarities between the personal experiences of Juror 50 and the issues being litigated. (Def.
Mem. at 30-35). But the Second Circuit has not recognized this as a proper basis to make a finding
of mandatory, presumed bias. Indeed, it has specifically rejected such a notion:

Just as we have refused to carve out an overly broad category of
presumed bias based on occupational or status relationships, so we
