‘place” and, more. specifically, to “erisure that the niost critical. evidencé to. bé elicited at the
hearing—namely, the testimony of Juror 50—is not.tainted by outside information, and
influence.” .Dkt.. No. 590 at.2.. The Court agrees that the integrity of any. inquiry Is. a “higher

Defendant’s. motion and the Government’s response is publicly available. And second, the: Court
is the'relevant ‘fact-finder with respect to any potential hearing and. it:is obviously privy to the

information whether filedunder seal or ‘filed publicly.
