Dear Judge Nathan:
I am in receipt of the Court’s Order, Dkt. No. 686. As explained in our submission, due to
a medical issue, Ms. Giuffre is not able to be present physically in the courtroom, but has asked
that I be able to read her statement at the hearing. I seek clarification of Your Honor’s Order
that I will be allowed to read a portion of Ms. Guiffre’s statement at the hearing.
Respectfully,
Sigrid S. McCawley
