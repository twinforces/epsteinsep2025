1 THE COURT: They said 15 to 20 minutes so I imagine

2 the marshals need time to get Mr. Berry across the street. So,
3 unless anyone has anything further, we will break and

4 re-assemble across the street at 500 Pearl. Thank you.

5 So, one question. Mr. Hobson, is the government ready
6 to commence trial?

7 MR. HOBSON: Yes, your Honor.

8 THE COURT: Mr. DeMarco?

9 MR. DeMARCO: Yes, Judge.

10 THE COURT: Thank you.

11 MR. DeMARCO: Your Honor, we are going to meet over at
12 the jury room?

13 THE COURT: We will meet in the alcove outside the

14 jury assembly room. There will be jury department staff there
15 to assist.

16 Thank you.
