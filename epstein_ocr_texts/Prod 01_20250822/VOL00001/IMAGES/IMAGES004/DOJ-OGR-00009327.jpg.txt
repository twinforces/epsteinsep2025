C2GFDAU1 Brune - direct

Fl Ms. Brune?

2 THE WITNESS: I didn't, your Honor,

3 THE COURT: Go ahead and complete your answer, please.
4 A. We had a lot of Google-type information on a lot of

5 different jurors. There were occasions where the information

6 was obviously pertaining to the same person. That was fine.

7 There was certainly situations where we were able to say, well,
8 just not the same person and set it aside. I didn't sort of go

9 to the judge each time and say, you know, Mr. Smith there says
10 that he's -- and now I'm just giving the example -- a retired
11 Car mechanic, but I know there's a Mr. Smith who has some other
12 eccupation. I listened to the voir dire responses and I

13 credited them.

14 Q. The question, though, Ms, Brune, and just so I'm clear

ES about what your testimony is, are you saying that you could not
16 have asked Judge Pauley to ask the question, just a very

Vy specific question of the juror, right then and there?

18 A. I certainly understood that I could have asked Judge Pauley
19 to inquire.
20 Q. And you didn't do that?
21 A, I did not.
22 Q. And you knew you could have done that, correct?
23 A. Of course.
24 Q. Now, you had ways to narrow down the information that you
25 had, correct?
