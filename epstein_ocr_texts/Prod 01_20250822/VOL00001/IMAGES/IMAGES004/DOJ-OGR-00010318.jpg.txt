LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA
983 (9 Cir. 1998) (en banc) (“If a juror treats with contempt the court's admonition to answer
voir dire questions truthfully, she can be expected to treat her responsibilities as a juror — to listen
to the evidence, not to consider extrinsic facts, to follow the judge's instructions — with equal
scom.”).

As Felix Frankfurter observed, “Justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.” Excusing

Juror 50’s false answers because he believes his concealed history of sexual abuse did not affect
his ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror does not satisfy the appearance of justice. Only a
new trial would. The Court should therefore order a new trial.

Very truly yours,
