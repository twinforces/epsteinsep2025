Flatley is expected to testify that that the metadata fields listed on Government

Exhibits 417, 418, 420, 421, and 422 are true and accurate reflections of the

metadata properties for those files, such as the fields listing the author, content

created date, date last saved, last saved by, and last printed. Examiner Flatley will
explain that he confirmed the accuracy of metadata fields by running Access Data

AD Lab. In the course of doing so, Examiner Flatley will explain that metadata is

information about a file, such as the file name and when the file was created. He

will also explain that metadata can be stored in a computer’s file system or

embedded inside certain files, like Word documents.
