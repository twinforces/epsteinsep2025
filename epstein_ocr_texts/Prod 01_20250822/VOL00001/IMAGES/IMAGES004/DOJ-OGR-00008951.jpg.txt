Tr. 41:7-16 (emphasis added). The government.was correct, that,the proof at trial established, at,
most, a single decade-long conspiracy between Epstein. atid Ms. Maxwell with multiple objects,
rather than. multiple independent conspiracies. An analysis of the.Korfant factors confirms that
the three conspiracies, charged in. Counts Onc, Three, and Five are’ virtually identical and are
therefore multiplicitous.*

1. Overlap of Participants and Time

Theré is no dispute that the central co-conspirators in all three charged corspiraci¢s were
Epstein.and Ms. Maxwell. According to the government, Epstcin and.Ms. Maxwell were
“partners in crime” who sexually exploited young girls throughout the entire, ten-year time period
charged.in the Indictment. Tr. 33:7-34:13; Tr. 2842:11-2845:9. Epstcin'was the principal. abuser
and Ms. Maxwell’was his “best friend and right hand” and his “closest associate and second. in
command.” /d. Although other participants later joined the scheme, :such.as Sarah Kellen,
Epstcin.and Ms. Maxwell were the core of the conspiracy from. its inception in 1994 through ‘its
conclusion, in 2004., See United States v. Reid, 475 F. App’x 385, 387 (2d Cir. 2012),
(“[C]hanges in. niembership.do not necessarily convert a single conspiracy into, multiple
conspiracies, and there is no requirement that the same people be:involved throughout the
duration, of the conspiracy: (cleaned up))..

Furthermore, the. Mann.Act conspiracies related to all four accusers who testified at
trial—Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and. Annic Farmer—and spanned the same relevant:ten-year‘period,
1994-2004. Although the scx trafficking conspiracy: (Count; Five) ‘related only to Carolyn and.
lasted ‘for a. shorter time period. from 2001-2004, that.count, which was later added to the S2

Indictment, did not. describe a ‘separate conspiratorial agreement. Rather, it)was simply a subsct

*The first.factor, an-analysis:of the criminal.offenses charged in.“successive indictments,” is inapplicable:here
because Ms. Maxwell has:been. charged. with two § 3/1. conspiracies in. the same indictment. The multifactor. test,
however, remains.applicable. See Cooper, 886 F.3diat 155.
