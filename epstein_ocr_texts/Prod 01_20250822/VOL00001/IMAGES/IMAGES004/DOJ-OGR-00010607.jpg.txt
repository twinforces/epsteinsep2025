Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document672 Filed 06/24/22 Page 16 of 68
The consequences of what Ghislaine Maxwell did have been far reaching for me.
| have struggled with, and eventually triumphed over, substance use disorder.
| have suffered panic attacks and night terrors, with which | still struggle.
| have suffered low self esteem, loss of career opportunities.
| have battled greatly with feeling unable to trust my own instincts, in choosing romantic
relationships.
| have had a hard time identifying dangerous people or situations.
| have also suffered periods nn.
At the age of 45, at 19 years of continuous sobriety and, after many years of engaging in different
modalities of therapy, | am beginning to see some light in deprogramming my own mind and
body from the messages | was programmed with, because of this abuse. What happened to me
at that young age changed the course of my life drastically, forever.
Speaking out about what happened to me opened me up to much criticism and forced me to
relive parts of my story that | would have preferred to have done privately, in the safety of trusted
individuals.
Testifying in this trial was both terrifying and retraumatizing.
| do not, however, regret it for one moment. There is nothing more important than protecting
the innocent and, if | was able to provide, in any way, information helpful to understanding the
nature of this type of abuse, as perpetrated by Ghislaine Maxwell, then my pain has had meaning
and therefore not been for naught.
| remain in deepest gratitude to the other women who came forward and to those who, for
whatever reason, didn’t or couldn’t.
| remain in deepest gratitude to the prosecutors who worked tirelessly to bring Ghislaine Maxwell
to justice, to protect the women who testified and to expose the grotesque malice with which
these crimes were committed.
| remain in deepest gratitude to the people of the jury, who gave up their time and energy, to be
part of this great judicial system, that saw a fair trial was executed.
| remain in deepest gratitude to Judge Nathan, for presiding so cautiously, fairly, and
deliberately.
| remain in deepest gratitude to my partner, friends and family, who tirelessly supported me
through this unnatural and traumatic time.
