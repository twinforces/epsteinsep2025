Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document613_ Filed 02/24/22 Page 11 of 66
asked potential jurors if they would have any difficulty assessing the credibility of
alleged victims of sexual assault or abuse just as they would assess the credibility of any
other witness.

Prior to finalizing the questionnaire, Ms. Maxwell proposed specific questions to
identify potential jurors who had been victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual
harassment. The defense proposed to ask potential jurors: (1) “Whether reported or not,
have you, any family member or anyone close to you, including a child/minor, ever been
the victim of any form of sexual abuse? (This includes actual or attempted sexual assault
or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor,
teacher, or family member;” and (2) “Whether reported or not, have you, or anyone close
to you, including a child/minor, ever felt in danger of being sexually assaulted by another
person, including a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member?” Doc.
367, p 21. The government objected to Ms. Maxwell’s proposed questions. Jd. The Court
partially agreed with the prosecution, asking a single question about whether potential
jurors had been actual victims of sexual assault, sexual abuse, or sexual harassment.

Specifically, Question 48 asked:

Have you or a friend or family member ever been the victim of sexual

harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or

attempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a

stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)

The questionnaire offered three answers: “Yes (self),” “Yes (friend or family member),”
and “No.”
