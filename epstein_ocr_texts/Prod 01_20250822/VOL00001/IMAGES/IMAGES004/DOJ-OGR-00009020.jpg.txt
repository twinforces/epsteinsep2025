A. Juror No. 50’s statements to the media
1. The interview with The Independent

On January 4, 2022, less than one week after the jury returned its verdict, Lucia
Osborne-Crowley of The Independent published an article based on an interview with
Juror No. 50.° Going by the name Scotty David, Juror No. 50 told Ms. Osborne-Crowley
that “[t]his verdict is for all the victims” and “shows that you can be found guilty no
matter your status.” Juror No. 50 admitted to being a victim of sexual assault and abuse,
telling Ms. Osborne-Crowley that he revealed the abuse to the jury and that his story was
fundamental to the jury’s verdict. According to Juror No. 50, the “jury room went dead
silent when he shared his story.”

Juror No. 50 explained to Ms. Osborne-Crowley how his own experience helped
the jury come to believe the alleged victims despite the holes and inconsistencies in their
stories. “I know what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember the colour of
the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video.”

Relying on his own experiences, Juror No. 50 refused to credit the testimony of
Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, Ms. Maxwell’s expert witness on memory. None of Dr. Loftus’s
testimony, said Juror No. 50, “relate[d]to traumatic memory.” Juror No. 50 explained all
of this to the jury. Ms. Maxwell’s accusers “were all believable,” Juror No. 50 said.
“Nothing they said felt to me like a lie.” Sometimes, he said, you can misremember
trivial details of a traumatic event without every doubting the core of the memory.
