the defendant was, an organizer or leader, and ‘that the e¢riminal
activity either involved five or more participants or was

otherwise €xtensive. The guidelines defines a participant as, a

person. whe j.'s criminally responsible for the commission of the
offense bit need not have been, convicted.

So IL think my question fer the geovernment -is, you're
asking the Cotirt to look t6 aS a Grifiinally résponsible -- a

person. whe is criminally responsible for the commission of the

Offense over whom Ms. Maxwell exercised stipervisory or
leadership. role,

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor, As we noted in our
briefing, our view ds that the trial evidence establishes that
the defendant. had a supervisory réle over Sarah Kellén. Here,

we're not wequired to establish that there were five or more

participants; that is, pédple who were ¢riminally responsible
for the charged, conduct, but, rather that 1t was extensive, and
that the deféndant supervised at least one other person.
That's the text of the commentary, although as we moted, the
Second Circuit in applying this factor hasn't really engaged

with that from what we can, tell, but on the factual question of

the trial record and whether it establishes the defendant.
supervised another participant, it absolutely does.
THE GOURT: And the govérnmént is pointing toé Sarah
Kellen. for that conclusion, which you agree, there has to be
one criminally responsible participant who we can point to.
