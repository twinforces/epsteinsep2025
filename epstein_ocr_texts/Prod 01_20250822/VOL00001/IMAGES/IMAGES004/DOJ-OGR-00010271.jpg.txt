Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully.submits this Reply’Memorandum ‘in, Support of her Post-
Trial Motions (“Motion” or “Mot.”).

I. The Court’s Response:to the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #15) Was Erroneous and
Resulted. in a ‘Constructive Amendment/Variance.

As the government statés in its Opposition to Ms. Maxwells Motion (“Opp.”), ‘the partic¢s
agrec that the Mann.Act offenses for which Ms. Maxwell was ‘convicted required. the following,
proof of intent: that’Ms. Maxwell “knowingly transported Jane with.the intent: thatJane engage
in.criminal sexual activity i New York” (Count Four).and that she. “conspir[ed] to entice and
transport minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage: in criminal sexual.
activity in New York” (Counts One and Three). (Opp. at.6 (emphasis added)). Stated differently;
the government agrees that ifthe jury: found that Ms. Maxwell:intended for Jane or the other
victims of the Mann Act conspiracies to engage in:scxual, activity in some place other than, New
York; such as New México, that/would, not be: sufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of the
Mann Act counts. (Opp. at 6-7 (“As the defendant. correctly ‘states. ... ‘it was necessary to prove
that [the defendant] enticed or caused undcraged girls to travel to New York, or conspired'to do
the same, with the intent that they would:engage in illegal scxual. activity that violated. New York
law.” (quoting, Mot. at. 1) (emphasis in. original)).

Similarly, the government does not- dispute that, for:purposcs of a constructive
amendment analysis, Ms. Maxwell’s intent to have Jane orthe other victims of the Mann Act
conspiracies engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New York law
was an “essential element” of Counts One, Three; and. Four, and ‘part.of the “core: of criminality”
for those charges. (Opp. at.6 (“That is the core of criminality charged:in the $2 Indictment, and
its what:'the Government‘proved. at;trial ‘and the Court captured in its jury‘instruetions.”’)). The

only dispute is whether “the evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial. likelihood
