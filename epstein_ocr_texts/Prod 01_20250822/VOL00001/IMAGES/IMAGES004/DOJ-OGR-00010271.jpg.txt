Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 647 Filed 03/11/22 Page5of24

Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Reply Memorandum in Support of her Post-
Trial Motions (““Motion” or “Mot.”).

I. The Court’s Response to the Jury Note (Court Exhibit #15) Was Erroneous and

Resulted in a Constructive Amendment/Variance.

As the government states in its Opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion (“Opp.”), the parties
agree that the Mann Act offenses for which Ms. Maxwell was convicted required the following
proof of intent: that Ms. Maxwell “knowingly transported Jane with the intent that Jane engage
in criminal sexual activity in New York” (Count Four) and that she “conspir[ed] to entice and
transport minors in interstate commerce with the intent that they engage in criminal sexual
activity in New York” (Counts One and Three). (Opp. at 6 (emphasis added)). Stated differently,
the government agrees that if the jury found that Ms. Maxwell intended for Jane or the other
victims of the Mann Act conspiracies to engage in sexual activity in some place other than New
York, such as New Mexico, that would not be sufficient, by itself, to convict Ms. Maxwell of the
Mann Act counts. (Opp. at 6-7 (“As the defendant correctly states ... ‘it was necessary to prove
that [the defendant] enticed or caused underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do
the same, with the intent that they would engage in illegal sexual activity that violated New York
law.’” (quoting Mot. at 1) (emphasis in original)).

Similarly, the government does not dispute that, for purposes of a constructive
amendment analysis, Ms. Maxwell’s intent to have Jane or the other victims of the Mann Act
conspiracies engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New York law
was an “essential element” of Counts One, Three, and Four, and part of the “core of criminality”
for those charges. (Opp. at 6 (“That is the core of criminality charged in the S2 Indictment, and
it is what the Government proved at trial and the Court captured in its jury instructions.”’)). The
only dispute is whether “the evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood
