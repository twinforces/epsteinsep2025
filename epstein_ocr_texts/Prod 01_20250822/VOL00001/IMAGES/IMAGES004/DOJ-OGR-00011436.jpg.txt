(1) furnishing, promising, or offering--or accepting, promising to accept, or
offering to accept--a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting
to compromise the claim; and
(2) conduct or a statement made during compromise negotiations about the
claim--except when offered in a criminal case and when the negotiations
related to a claim by a public office in the exercise of its regulatory,
investigative, or enforcement authority.

(b) Exceptions. The court may admit this evidence for another purpose, such as

proving a witness’s bias or prejudice, negating a contention of undue delay, or

proving an effort to obstruct a criminal investigation or prosecution.
Fed. R. Evid. 408. For at least three reasons, Rule 408 does not apply here.

First, the Rule only prohibits evidence of compromise when the disputed claim is the
same claim that was compromised. As the Second Circuit has held, “Evidence of an offer to
compromise, though otherwise barred by Rule 408, can fall outside the Rule if it is offered for
‘another purpose,’ i.e., for a purpose other than to prove or disprove the validity of the claims
that the offers were meant to settle.” Trebor Sportswear Co. v. The Ltd. Stores, Inc., 865 F.2d
506, 510 (2d Cir. 1989) (emphasis added); Carr v. Health Ins. Plan of Greater New York, Inc.,
No. 99 CIV. 3706 (NRB), 2001 WL 563722, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. May 24, 2001) (“[Rule 408] is not
a blanket rule of inadmissibility for any and all statements in the settlement context. If evidence
is ‘offered for another purpose’ apart from liability for (or damages resulting from) the claim
under settlement discussion, that evidence may be admitted.” (emphasis added)); see also Equal
Emp. Opportunity Comm'n v. Karenkim, Inc., No. 5:08-CV-1019 (NAM/DEP), 2011 WL
13352967, at *2 (N.D.N.Y. Jan. 10, 2011) (“But when settlement-related evidence is related to a
claim not under consideration by a jury, courts generally permit its introduction, so long as it is
otherwise admissible, if it is relevant to a claim that is at issue.” (citing cases)).
