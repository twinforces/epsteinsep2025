to become a “fishing expedition” but. rather must limit the scope of any ‘inquiry “to only: what is
absolutely necessary to determine the facts with précision.” Jannicllo, 866 E.2d.at'543-44. It.is
hard. to imagine a:request more likely to “subject[] juries to harassment” and “inhibit juryroom.
deliberation,” id. at 543, than the defendant?s request:to compel’production of, a juror’s emails and.
other writtcn.communications, aswell as content from. his’ Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,.Instagram,

Request 1(d);calls for communications about any:payment. Juror 50 reccived for media:interviews,
but even ifthe received compensation for post-trial interviews that says nothing whatsoever about
whether the Court would have struck him for cause before trial, based on his alleged, cxpericnce

Requests 2(a) and'2(b) ask the Court to direct:numerousisocial.media companies to produce

all communications to and from Juror 50,about.his jury‘service and.all:posts or.comments regarding
