Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 662 Filed 06/15/22 Page17 of 29

The case law bears this out. The adjustment is typically applied to defendants (virtually
all of whom are male) who repeatedly and often violently sexually abuse or exploit children for
their own sexual gratification and who are caught soon after or while still engaging in that
behavior. See, e.g., Broxmeyer, 699 F.3d at 284-88; United States v. Suarez, No. 21-1721, 2022
WL 1449174, at *1-*2 (3d Cir. May 9, 2022); United States v. Santos, No. 21-10381, 2022 WL
1196761, at *1-*3 (Sth Cir. Apr. 22, 2022); United States v. Sanchez, 30 F.4th 1063, 1067-76
(11th Cir. 2022); United States v. McGrain, No. 6:20-cr-06113 (EAW), 2022 WL 287350, at *1-
*6 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 1, 2022).

In sharp contrast, Ms. Maxwell has never been accused of any sex offenses—or any

uncontrollable impulses that would compel her to re-offend. According to the trial record, it was
Epstein who had such proclivities, whereas Ms. Maxwell’s role was to facilitate Epstein’s sexual
abuse. Indeed, after she moved on from Epstein in the early 2000s, Ms. Maxwell was involved
in two long-term relationships with men who had young children and was actively involved in
their lives without even the slightest hint of impropriety. Most importantly, the government
concedes that Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community. The government never made that
assertion in connection with Ms. Maxwell’s numerous bail applications and there is no evidence
whatsoever to support such a claim. Put simply, Ms. Maxwell is not “dangerous” and there is no
risk that Ms. Maxwell will ever “repeat” the offense. Accordingly, there is no basis to apply
§ 4B1.5, which is meant to apply only to “Repeat and Dangerous” sex offenders.

The government asserts that § 4B1.5 should apply as long as the offense conduct fits
within the text of the guideline, to which it claims to be faithfully adhering. See PSR at 60. It is
