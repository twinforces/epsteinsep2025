In sharp contrast, Ms. Maxwell’has never been accused of any sex: offenses—or any:
crimes, for that mattcr—in the almost 20-ycear‘period since the conduct at issuc in this case

Epstein. who, had.such.proclivitics, whereas Ms. Maxwell’s role was.to facilitate Epstcin’s sexual.

in two long-term relationships with men who:had young children.and was actively involved in
their lives:without cven-the slightest hint.of impropricty...Most importantly, the government
concedes that Ms, Maxwell is nota danger to the community., The: government never made: that,
assertion in-connection with Ms. Maxwell’s numerous. bail applications and there 1s.no evidence

§ 4B1.5, which is. meant.to, apply only to “Repeat and Dangerous” sex offenders.

The government asserts that § 4B1..5 should.apply as long as the offense conduct. fits

within the text of the: guideline, to‘which. it-claims 'to be faithfully adhering. See PSR at: 60. It is
