C. The Court will release Juror 50’s questionnaire.
This. Court:previously reserved ruling on.Juror 50’s request that: the Court release: his jury
questionnaire to, counsel, but'that'the document otherwise remain unde? seal. to protect his

supposed privacy interest. See. Dkt. No. 596 at 5 n.1. The Defendant opposcs both the'unsealing
and. releasing the questionnaire to counscl, arguing that: “advance disclosure . . . ‘will
undoubt[edly] color Juror No. 50’s testimony and allow him:to place himsclfiin-the best possible
posture.” Maxwell Br. at.53. The Government argues that there is no legitimate interest in
limiting Juror 50’s access and.opposeés maintaining the questionnaire under scal. Gov. Br. at.423
see:also Dkt. No. 594.

The Court will provide Juror.50 a.copy of his completed, questionnaire. Unlike the:
partics’ ‘proposed qucstions,, Juror 507s aceéss to his completed questionnaite—the answers:to.
which he ‘wrote—will not undermine the integrity of the inquiry. The Defendant’s concern, that
advance disclosure may'somchow taint: Juror 50’s testimony is unfounded. See United States v:
McCoy etal., No. 14-CR-6181 (EAW),.Dkt. No. 329, :at 15 (W.D.N.Y. June.2,, 2017) (providing
the jury questionnaire to juror’s counsel in advance of the hearing). Rather, delaying disclosure
until the hearing would needlessly delay the fact-finding process.

Moreover, the Court concludes that the presumption ‘of access dictates that the
questionnaire must be: docketed. Juror 50’s.and the Defendant’s request that the questionnaire
remain scaled is governed bythe three-part test articulated bythe Second Circuit in Lugosch ¥.
