“misrepresent[cd] key facts to Pretrial, Services and, by’extension, the Court.” (PSR
4 172, December 28, 2020 Opinion at. 14-16):

° On November''1; 2021, the Court allocuted the defendant; about::whether she had.
engaged ‘in plea discussions with the Government. Although the Court’s: question.
called for a yes or novanswer about plea offers, the defendant elected.to volunteer
the following: “I have riot committed, any crime.” (November |, 2021 Tr. at'‘113).
That was a lic.

o In. preparation. for sentencing, the -defendant.:was ‘interviewed by: the Probation.
Office, and.she refused.to provide any information about:the circumstances of her
marriage and, accordingly, the Probation Office ‘was, unable to ‘verify. these facts.
(PSR. at 145). Moreover, the defendant reported that. she. had. almost. no: asscts,, a
of bail—that she had approximately $22: million in assets. (PSR 4 1.72). In. short,
the defendant. apparently decides when. she wishes to disclose facts to the: Court,
and those facts shift when it serves the defendant’s interests.

Moreover, ‘even. now, at sentencing, the defendant has shown ino acceptance of
responsibility, and ‘her submission fails to even mention, much, less accept. responsibility for, the
harm. she has caused her'victims. Instead, her entire submission is an effort to cast: herself as, a,
victim: of her father, of Epstein, of the media, of prosecutors, of the Burcau of Prisons. Although.
much. of the defendant’s sentencing memorandum. aims to cast, aspersions on, the Government,
these: claims are baseless. ‘This Office.did what it always docs ‘in any casé: it followed 'the facts
and. law. The investigation. uncovered. that ‘the defendant. committed terrible crimes, and. that is

‘what this case is about. The Court should sce:the: defendant? s attack.on the Government’s motives
