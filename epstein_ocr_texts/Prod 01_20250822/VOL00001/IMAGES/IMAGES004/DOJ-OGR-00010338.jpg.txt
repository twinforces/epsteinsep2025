critical role ‘in, those extreme cases where dissatisfied litigants maybe tempted. to harass or
tamper ‘with jurors in.an attempt to impcéach the verdict. See Tanner, 483 US. at.120-2.1.

Finally, what:is not at issuc in resolving this. motion is whether the: Defendant would.have:
exercised ‘a;peremptory strike: against this juror had he accurately disclosed his prior sexual
abuse. Although the Defendant argues inher pre-hearing bricfing:that' she is also. entitled to a
new trial, because Juror 50’s failure to disclose his history denied her‘the: opportunity to exercise
her peremptory challenges, that: is not the law in federal court. .Indecd, in making this argument
she cites only decisions:that:relicd on New: Jerscy state law. Maxwell Br. at 46-47. Butthe rule
‘in New Jersey state courts is different than the rule that binds this Court. See Sfaie'v. Scher, 650
A.2d 1012, 1019-20 (NJ. App. Div. 1994) (explaining that New Jerscy’s “rule differs from its
federal counterpart” of. McDonough). Under McDonough, a. defendant secking a. new'trial must
‘show that “a correct response would’have provided.a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” 464
US. at 555-56 (emphasis added). A desire to,“wipe the slate clean simply to recreate'the.
peremptory’ challenge process” is not-cnough. Ji.;,see also Shaoul, 41 F.3d at 81.6 (concluding
‘that 'a.defendant: failed. to satisfy: the second. prong of McDonough where the defendant: “may:
certainly: exclude: such jurors: by-the usc of peremptory’ challenges, but he has no basis for
arguing that.a district court.is requircd.to sustain, such, a challenge for cause”). That difference
arises in.part. from the fact that.“[uJ]nlike:challengés for cause, ‘peremptory strikes are not
constitutionally required.” ‘Lorres, 128 F.3d.at-43n.4.
