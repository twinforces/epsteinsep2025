1 suspension report, she did not characterize it in that way.

2 All she said was there was a suspended lawyer with the name

3 Catherine Conrad.

4 Q. And you asked nothing of her on what facts she had that

5 demonstrated that to her?

6 BR. «Noy. I dedn’t.

7 @. And is it correct that Ms. Trzaskoma asked you or threw out

B the possibility of doing further research on this Catherine

| Conrad that she had found information about?

10 A. I'm sorry, I'm not sure I understand the question.

11 Q. Did she ask whether anything more should be done to look

i? into this?

13 A. We discussed after she raised the issue with us, you know,
14 what Juror No. 1's responses were on voir dire. We concluded
15 that we did not believe they were the same person and we

16 decided that we didn't need to do any more research at that

L? point.

18 Q. Well, you say "we discussed." Tell us your best

13 recollection what was said.

20 A. I can't recall precisely what was said. I think what we
21 did was we reviewed what Catherine Conrad had said on voir

22 dire, what her responses were and to us that ruled out the

2a possibility that she was the suspended lawyer. It was just
24 inconceivable to me that she was a suspended lawyer. Why would
Al she lie about her highest level of education?
