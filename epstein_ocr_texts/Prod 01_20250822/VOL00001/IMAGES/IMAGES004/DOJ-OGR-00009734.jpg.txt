a serious concern.as to whether an. ordinary person. in [Juror No. 50’s] shoes would. be
able to disregard [his] own experiences in evaluating the evidence.” /d. Morcover, like
the juror in. Ashfar, Juror No. 50?s post-trial conduct further supports a finding of implied
bias. The juror in Ashfar communicated with a victim of sexual assault; here, Juror No.
50 communicated with Annic Famer. The juror in.Ashfar-vicwed himself'as “advocate for
people;” here, Juror No. 50 proclaimed that the verdict against Ms. Maxwell was a.
verdict: “for all. the victims.”

The bias of Juror'No. 50 should.be implied for another'reason: “[R ]epeated lies in
voir dire:imply that;the juror concealed material facts inorder to secure a spot on. the
particular jury.” Daugerdas, 867 .F. Supp. 2d at 472. Herc, not:only did Juror No. 50
falscly deny on the questionnaire that he had been’a victim of a.crime and,a victim of
sexual assault and sexual, abuse, he also falsely answered the Court’s questions about
social media: According to Juror No. 50, he used only Facebook and Instagram and he
deleted all his social media accounts. In. fact, Juror No. 50: was a, Twitter user, having
joined, Twitter:in April 202:1.. His Twitter account appears to. have been active, during trial.
and, voir dire, notwithstanding his claim that he deleted all. his social media accounts.
Moreover, after trial, Juror No. 50 used Twitter to publicize his interviews with. the press
and to communicate directly: to-Annic Farmer. It also appears Juror’No. 50 did not delete
his Instagram,account,

Crucially, “[e]ven when prospective jurors are dishonest for reasons other than a.
desire to: secure a scat, on the jury, dishonest, answers to ‘voir dire questions indicate that,a

juror is unwilling or unable ‘to apply the, law.as instructed bythe court to the evidence
