sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,
acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)

Dkt. No. 462.at.24. In response:to that question, Juror 50 checked. the: box. for “No,” not the: box.
for either “Yes (self)” or “Yes (friend or family:member).” ‘But in, several, public statements:
made to, media. outlets after the trial, ineluding interviews in. 7he Independent and The Daily.Mail
dated January 5, 2022, Juror 50'stated.thatihe was sexually abused.as a.minor. The statements
are direct, unambiguous, and made by Juror 50 himsclf'to, multiple media outlets. Morcover, the
statements themselves describe Juror 50”s:own experience." They: constitute “clear, strong,
substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropricty. has
occurred,” and, so'warrant an evidentiary hearing. Baker, 99 F.3d.at.130.

Although the Court does not decide:whether the threshold to hold.a. hearing based on.
Question 25 alone has been;met, because the: Court will, hold ‘a, hearing on Juror’50’s answer to
Question 48 and because Question 48 and, 25 are sufficiently related, the Court will inquire ints
Juror 50’s answer to Question 25, Question 25 asked.jurors:

Have you, or any of your‘rclatives or close friends, ever becn.a victim of a crime?

Dkt. No. 462 at.13.. Again, Juror 50 checked the box for “No,” and not.the box. for cither “Yes
(self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).” ButJuror 50’s post-trial statements, if true, may
describe criminal conduct of which he was'the victim. Therefore, Juror 50’s answer to Quéstion
25 is sufficiently related to the answer to Question 48 and so the Court will.also inquire as to

Question 25 at'an. evidentiary hearing: See Baker, 99 F.3d_at 130.

*The articles additionally’state that Juror’50. shared this-experience with the'jury“during deliberations. The Court:is
prohibited by Rule: 606 from considering that Juror. 50calso told:this.information.to:the jury. ‘That-Juror’S0 revealed
that‘he also disclosed this information‘to the jury docs not prohibit the Court from-considering Juror 50’s
independent statements made to a reporter about:his own-expericnce.
