Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

By letter dated March 1, 2022, counsel for Juror 50 informed the Court that Juror 50 will
invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination at the hearing scheduled for
March 8, 2022. The Government writes to notify the Court that it is in the process of seeking
internal approval to seek an order, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. §§ 6002 and 6003, compelling Juror 50’s
testimony at the hearing. The Government will, subject to internal approval, submit a proposed
order to the Court in advance of the hearing.

Respectfully submitted,
DAMIAN WILLIAMS
United States Attorney
