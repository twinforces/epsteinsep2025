1 because of the obvious issue that would arise with
2 attorney-client privilege and with Minor Victim 4's right to
3 representation of counsel.
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, first, your Honor, I don't think
5 that it's appropriate for me to have to discuss defense
6 strategy in this context. However —--
7 THE COURT: That's fine. There will be no —- without
8 briefing, you will not call an attorney for a witness, period.
9 I'm happy to see briefing, but until that happens, you won't.
10 MR. PAGLIUCA: That's fine, your Honor.
11 THE COURT: OK.
12 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.
13 We had one other question for your Honor, which is
14 whether the Court intends to, in its preliminary instruction,
15 inform the jury that certain witnesses will be testifying under
16 pseudonyms. We wanted to know that so that we understand how
17 to approach that issue in our opening statement.
18 THE COURT: I think we have a pending proposal, with
19 the two sides having slightly different views as to what
20 language to use for those instructions. I haven't dealt with
21 that yet, but I will. And then I guess the second question
22 you're asking is, will I include that in my preliminary
23 instructions as opposed to at the time the first witness is
24 called. It should come before opening, I presume, because
25 you'll refer to witnesses pursuant to pseudonyms during
