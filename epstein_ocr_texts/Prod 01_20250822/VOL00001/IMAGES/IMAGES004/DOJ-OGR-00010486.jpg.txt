Dear Judge: Nathan,”

This. is:a joint letter fromm Anne Holve (née Maxwell), and ifrom Dr
Philip Maxwell, eldest:siblings of Ghislaine Maxwell: We are worried
that the legal process as it moves'to its close. might not include

information that:provides. a better und erstanding of Ghislaine.

The traumatic background. of Ghislaine began with the 1961
automobile accident to.our'éldest brother Michaél who suffered fatal
injuries that hospitalized him in a-coma-for 7 years. until his;death
These were:the first seven years of Ghisiaine’s life. (The: accident:
happened when she was 3 days old): Our entire family was shaken
up by this. My mother gave: almidst.daily atténtion at Michael's:
hospital bedside until his death. ‘

We believe that forensic psychologists use-objective scales. of

trauma..Also clinical psychoanalysts ‘could asséss her éase.
