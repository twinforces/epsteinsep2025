Dear Judge Nathan,
This is a joint letter from Anne Holve (née Maxwell), and from Dr
Philip Maxwell, eldest siblings of Ghislaine Maxwell. We are worried
that the legal process as it moves to its close might not include
information that provides a better understanding of Ghislaine.
The traumatic background of Ghislaine began with the 1961
automobile accident to our eldest brother Michael who suffered fatal
injuries that hospitalized him in a coma for 7 years until his death
These were the first seven years of Ghislaine’s life. (The accident
happened when she was 3 days old). Our entire family was shaken
up by this. My mother gave almost daily attention at Michael’s
hospital bedside until his death. |
We believe that forensic psychologists use objective scales of
trauma. Also clinical psychoanalysts could assess her case.
