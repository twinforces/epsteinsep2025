Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document663_ Filed 06/15/22 Page 33 of 77

Acknowledging that COVID hardship is a basis for downward variance, courts in this
District have given credit for each day of pretrial detention served during the pandemic See, e.g.,
United States v. Gonzalez, 18 Cr. 669 (JPO) (Apr. 16, 2021), Dkt. 250 at 17 (time served during
the pandemic is “basically like solitary confinement,” “harsher than a usual period,” “more
punitive,” “essentially the equivalent of either time and a half or two times what would ordinarily
be served” (emphasis added); United States. Brissett, 19 Cr. 153 (RMW) (Sept. 22, 2021, Dkt. 56

detention were tantamount to pre-sentence punishment, she is entitled to an additional significant
downward variance from the applicable guidelines.
Extraordinary Conditions of Solitary Confinement Justifies a Hard-Time Credit

To determine the nature and extent to which Ms. Maxwell has been penalized, it is
important to factor in the impact of the hardship on Ms. Maxwell compared to general population
inmates. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of proportionality, Ms.
Maxwell should be given hard-time credit for the time she served in restricted and isolated
detention. Ms. Maxwell was subjected to punitive conditions and abuse in violation of clearly
established law protecting such individuals from punishment, to be free from “needlessly harsh
conditions of confinement.” Jgbal v. Hasty, 490 F.3d 143, 169 (2d Cir. 2007), rev’d on other
grounds, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662 (2009). She posed no danger to the security of the
institution, the staff, or other inmates, and engaged in no misconduct requiring her placement in
segregation. Confining her to unusually restrictive isolation for the better part of two years permits
an inference of punitive intent in the absence of any penological reason. The claim that she was
