crime, in general terms,” but not “the particulars of how a defendant effected the crime.” Jd. at
*20. The “object of a conspiracy constitutes an essential element of the conspiracy offense.”
Id. However, text in an indictment, such as “factual allegations that do not prove essential
elements of a charge” and “general factual allegations leading into the statutory allegations” are
not limitations on the core of criminality alleged in an indictment. /d.

Once a court identifies the core of criminality, the court “must then determine whether the
evidence or jury instructions at trial created a substantial likelihood that the defendant was not
convicted of the crime described in that core, but of a crime ‘distinctly different’ from the one
alleged.” Jd. The Second Circuit has “consistently permitted significant flexibility in proof,
provided that the defendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial.”
Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 53. Accordingly, a defendant “cannot simply show that the facts diverged
greatly from those alleged in the indictment,” but rather that “the evidence and jury instructions
created a substantial likelihood that a defendant was convicted for behavior entirely separate from
that identified in the indictment.” Gross, 2017 WL 4685111, at *21; see United States v. McGinn,
787 F.3d 116, 128 (2d Cir. 2015) (“[T]he proof at trial need not, indeed cannot, be a precise replica
of the charges contained in an indictment... .”). “[T]he Second Circuit has made clear that a
constructive amendment does not occur where the facts at trial involve not a ‘distinctly different
complex set of uncharged facts’ but ‘a single set of discrete facts consistent with the charge in the
indictment.’” /d. (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 412, 419 (2d Cir. 2012)).

“Tn contrast to a constructive amendment, a variance occurs when the charging terms of
the indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence offered at trial proves facts materially different
