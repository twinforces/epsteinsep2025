crime, in general.terms,” but not, “the particulars of how a‘defendant effected the crime.” Jd. at.
*20. The “object of a conspiracy constitutes an cssential elenient of the conspiracy offense”
Id. However, text in an. indictment, such as. “factual. allegations that do :not prove: essential.
clements.of'a, charge” ‘and “general ‘factual allegations. leading into'the statutory allegations” are
not.limitations. onthe, core of criminality‘ alleged in an indictment: Jd.
evidence or jury’ instructions at; trial created a substantial likelihood. that the defendant. was not.
convicted of the crime described in.that core, but of a:crime “distinctly different’ from. the one:
alleged.” Jd. The Second, Circuit has “consistently permitted significant flexibility in, proof,
‘provided that. the defendant. was. given notice of the core of ériminality to, be proven. at. trial:”
Lebedev, 932 F.3d.at.53. Accordingly, a defendant “cannot simply show that the facts diverged.
greatly ‘from those alleged in the indictment,” but rather that “the evidence and jury instructions
created a substantial likclihood. that'a:defendant.was convicted for behavior entirely separate from.

that identified:in the indictment.” Gross, 201.7 WL 4685111, at'*21; see United States v. McGinn,
787 F.3d 116,128 (2d Cir. 2015) (“[T]he proof at:trial need not, indeed cannot, be a precise replica,
of the charges contained. in.an. indictment... . .”). “[T]he Second Circuit has made. clear that a
constructive amendment does not occur where the facts.at trial involve not.a ‘distinctly. different.
complex set of uncharged facts’ but *a.single sct.of discrete facts consistent with’the charge in the:
indictment.” Jd. (quoting United States v..D’Amelio, 683 F.3d.412, 419 (2d Cir. 2012)).

“In, contrast to a:constructive amendment, a variance occurs when the charging terms of

the indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence offered at trial. proves facts materially different.
