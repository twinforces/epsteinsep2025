Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 644 _ Filed 03/11/22 Page 25 of 32

At any hearing it is the Court’s job to evaluate the evidence presented, not present the
evidence. The evidence elicited should be the product of all available investigation and research.
In Dyer v. Calderon, 151 F.3d 970, 976 (9th Cir. 1998), cited favorably by the government,
Judge Kozinski explained the perils of a court conducting a juror bias inquiry with incomplete
information or failing to ask critical questions. "[A] judge investigating juror bias must find
facts, not make assumptions . . . [I]t was the trial court’s obligation to develop the relevant facts
on the record, not merely presume them. The judge’s lack of verve in pursuing the matter casts
doubt on his findings.” /d. at 976-77. The Ninth Circuit en banc opinion also was critical of the
trial judge’s refusal to allow the defense to subpoena a critical witness of the bias. "Where juror
misconduct or bias is credibly alleged, the trial judge cannot wait for defense counsel to spoon
feed him every bit of information which would make out a case of juror bias; rather, the judge
has an independent responsibility to satisfy himself that the allegation of bias is unfounded." /d.
at 978.

If the Court is charged with the responsibility questioning Juror No. 50, what resources
will the Court use to uncover any statements and misstatements made by Juror No. 50? Will the
Court investigate Juror No. 50’s motives? Will the Court hire an investigator to find all of the
posts made by Juror No. 50 about the trial? Having witnessed Juror No. 50 during the trial and
having previously questioned Juror No. 50 -- both through a written questionnaire and in person -
- under the government’s farcical hearing the Court would be a (1) witness, (2) inquisitor, (3)
factfinder and (4) sole decision maker. These multiple, conflicted, roles are no model of due
process.
