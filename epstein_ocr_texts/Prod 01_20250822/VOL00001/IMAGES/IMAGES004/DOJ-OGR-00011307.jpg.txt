state’s: age of consent, the defendant is not ‘charged. with, any such conduct. The: proposed.
instruction. is not fully accurate. when it says that :scxual activity is not: ‘illegal, sexual activity’ as
the Government has.charged in the Indictment” “because the witness’ was over the age-of consent”
in the relevant. jurisdiction; rather, whether the’ sexual activity’ is or is not “illegal, sexual activity”
regarding the offenses in the Indictment is determined, by reference only to New York state law
and. New York"s age of consent. As is clear from. the Government’s proposed request to charge,
the Government is not:procecding on, a' theory that.a violation, of.any law other the New York law
was an object. of the Mann. Act counts. See Proposed Request ‘to Charge at.23, 3.1, 51-52. And.
while sexual activity‘over some other state’s age of consent cannot establish a substantive Mann,
Act offense because it was ‘not “illegal sexual activity,” forthe purposes of the conspiracy counts,
the Government need not prove that any: illegal ‘sexual. activity actually occurred. All that is:
required:is that the defendant intended illegal sexual.activity—that is, a:violation of the New York.
object offerse—to occur. See Proposed. Request to Charge at 45. And, sexual activity in New
Mexico or Florida with. someone below New: York's age: of consent. is direct evidence of that
offense, whatever the local ages of consent.

An instruction that scxual contact. ina jurisdiction. other than. .New York is not “illegal,
sexual activity” ‘because it! was over some other state’s age of consent would likely confuse the
jury: by:(1) informing the jury: about a state age of consent that is notirclevant to the crimes charged.
in.the Indictment, and (2) suggest to the jury that sexual contact was “not illegal” because it was
above that state’s age of consent, even though it,is direct evidence of the Mann Act.conspiracics.

Further, as to ‘the sex trafficking counts, state: laws and ages of consent are entircly’
