in the group massages. To the contrary, in a September 2019 interview, Jane told the government
that Emmy and Michelle “were involved in the sexual contact.” See 3509-001, p 4. Jane made
this claim about Michelle when discussing the abuse she claims to have suffered in New York
when she was “‘young.” /d.

Michelle’s testimony will contradict Jane’s testimony because she will deny being
involved in the sexualized massages that Jane claims she was a part of.

Contrary to the government’s argument, there is no doubt Michelle Healy, who Ms.
Maxwell intends to call as a witness, is the same “Michelle” who Jane claimed both during her
testimony and her September 2019 interview was involved in group sexualized massages with
Mr. Epstein. Jane told the government in September 2019 that Michelle was “short” and that she
introduced Jane to “white Russians,” a vodka cocktail. See 3509-001, p 4. Michelle Healy is
short, and Michelle will testify that she drinks white Russians. And, as Jane testified on the
stand, Michelle will testify that she was good friends with Emmy Taylor, a point the government
ignores in its letter.

As with Eva, Ms. Maxwell has a right to present the testimony of Michelle, who will
deny Jane’s allegations of being involved the group sexualized massages that are the basis of the
charges in this case.*

* Michelle has other relevant testimony to offer, in addition to contradicting Jane’s
account of the group sexualized massages. The government does not challenge this other
testimony.
