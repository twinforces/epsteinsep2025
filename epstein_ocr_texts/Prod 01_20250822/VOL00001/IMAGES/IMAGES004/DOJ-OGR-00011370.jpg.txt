in'the group massages. To the contrary, in a September 2019 interview, Jane told the government
that Enimy and Michelle, “were involved in the sexual contact.” See 3509-001, p 4. Jane,made
this claim about Michelle when, discussing the abuse she claims to have suffered in New’ York
‘when she was “young.” Jd.

Michelle’s testimony: will. contradict Janc’s testimony because she will deny: being
involved in the sexualized massages that Jane claims she! was a ‘part, of.

Contrary to the governmient’s argument, theré is no doubt, Michelle Healy, who Ms.
Maxwell intends'to call. as.a‘witness, is the same “Michelle” who Jane claimed. both during her
testimony-and her: September 20.19 interview was involved in group sexualized massages with
Mr. Epstein. Jane ‘told the government in September 2019 that Michelle. was “short” and that she
introduced. Janc to “white Russians,” a vodka cocktail. See 3509-001, p 4. Michelle Healy is
short, and, Michelle will testify that:she drinks, white Russians. And, as Jane testified on the
stand, Michelle will-testify that she’was good friends with-Emmy Taylor, a point the government
ignores ‘in its letter.

As with Eva, Ms. Maxwell has a right. to, present: the testimony of Michelle, who ‘will
‘deny Jane’s allegations of being involved the: group: sexualized. massages that arc the basis of the

charges in this case."

4 Michelle has other relevant testimony to offer, in addition. to contradicting, Jane’s
account of the group sexualized massages. The government, docs not challenge this other
testimony.
