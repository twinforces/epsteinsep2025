Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 662 Filed 06/15/22 Page 25 of 29
Counts Three, Four, and Six already includes the concept of “unduly influenc[ing] a minor to
engage in prohibited sexual conduct.” The enhancement therefore should not be applied to any
of the three offense groups.

Second, under the 2003 Guidelines, which should apply in this case, the analogous two-
point enhancement only applies if “a participant otherwise unduly influenced a minor to engage
in a commercial sex act.’ USSG § 2G1.1(b)(4)(B) (2003) (emphasis added). There is no
evidence that “Jane” or Annie Farmer engaged in a commercial sex act. Accordingly, the
enhancement should not apply to their two offense groups (Groups 1| and 2).

Third, the evidence does not support that Carolyn was “unduly influenced” to provide
sexualized massages to Epstein. The “undue influence” enhancement applies when “a
participant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”
USSG § 2G1.3(b)(2)(B), Appl. Note 3(B). “[T]he defining characteristic of undue influence is
that it involves a situation where the influencer has succeeded in altering the behavior of the
target.” United States v. Patterson, 576 F.3d 431, 443 (7th Cir. 2009) (internal quotation marks
omitted). Apart from Virginia Roberts initially offering Carolyn the opportunity to massage
Epstein, the record indicates that Carolyn sought out additional massage appointments herself
and recruited other minors to perform sexualized massages to make more money. (Tr. 1527-28,
1543-46). Carolyn further testified that after she became pregnant, she returned to Epstein
without being contacted to earn additional money. (Tr. 1548-49). In addition, Carolyn was not
so influenced by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell that she did whatever they asked of her. Carolyn
testified that she refused their offers to have her travel with them to Epstein’s island. (Tr. 1534-
35). In sum, the record does not support the conclusion that Ms. Maxwell or anyone else
