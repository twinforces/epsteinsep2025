Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670 _ Filed 06/22/22 Page 34 of55

All three of these requirements are satisfied here. The offense of conviction is a “covered
sex crime.” See U.S.S.G. § 4B1.5 app. n.2 (stating that offenses in Chapter 117 of Title 18 are
covered sex crimes); 18 U.S.C. § 2423 (located in Chapter 117). The defendant is neither a career
offender nor a repeat offender. And the defendant “engaged in a pattern of activity involving
prohibited sexual conduct.” As discussed at length above, the defendant transported Jane to New
York, a Chapter 117 offense, she transported Virginia, and she touched Jane and Carolyn’s
breasts—which would be Chapter 109A offenses had they occurred within the territorial
Jurisdiction of the United States. See 18 U.S.C. §§ 2243, 2244, 2246 (2003) (defining “sexual
contact” to include the touching of the breast with the intent to “gratify the sexual desire of any
person,” and criminalizing knowingly engaging in sexual contact with a minor under the age of
16). This is well more than required by the Guidelines. See United States v. Telles, 18 F 4th 290,
303 (9th Cir. 2021) (applying the enhancement where “Telles sexually abused T.B. on two separate
occasions—the first night he arrived in the United Kingdom and the second night of his trip’’).

The defendant has no serious argument that the text of the Guidelines is inapplicable on
these facts. Instead, she argues that the Guideline is only intended to apply to continuing sexual
offenders, and so should not be applied to her. (Def. Mem. 11-14). The background commentary
incorporates her principle, she adds, and such commentary is “authoritative.” (/d. at 14). This
argument fails at each step.

First, applying § 4B1.5(b) to the defendant is entirely consistent with the Guidelines
commentary. That commentary explains that the enhancement is meant to prevent repeat sexual
offenders from committing further crimes, as the defendant notes. But it also explains that the
Guideline was enacted in response to a congressional directive to “ensure lengthy incarceration
for offenders who engage in a pattern of activity involving the sexual abuse or exploitation of
