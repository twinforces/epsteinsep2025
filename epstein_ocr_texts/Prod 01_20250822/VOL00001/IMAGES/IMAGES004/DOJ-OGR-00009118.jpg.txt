Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document614 Filed 02/24/22 Page11o0f12

notwithstanding these prejudices,he is determined tolisten'to the evidence, and be governed by it;
but the law'will not:trusthim.” Bur, 25 F. Cas. at'50. Such aj uror“may'declare that he feels tio
prejudice in,the case;.and'yct the law cautiously'incapacitates him,from:serving on thejury:-because
it-suspects prejudice, because in gencral persons‘in a similarsituation: would. fecl prejudice.” Jd.

In. addition. to these situations in:which. bias ‘must be implicd, there are situations'where
bias may’be inferred. “Bias‘may be inferred when a.juror discloses a. fact. that'bespeaks a risk of
‘partiality sufficiently 'significant'to, warrant, granting the trial. judge discretion to ¢xcusé the juror’
for cause, but:not so great.as to make mandatory a presumption.of. bias.” 7orres, 128 F.3d at 47.

Here, Juror 50’s media statements:establish.both implied and inferred bias.. The, average
person, Who Was, Sexually victimized.and had Juror '50’s, feclings about the crime and, those ‘who
complain, about it could:not be: fair, his protestationsto the ‘contrary notwithstanding. To borrow
‘Chief Justice’ Marshall’s ‘phrase, Juror 50 should have been. “‘cautiously incapacitate[d]” from
serving’on this jury.

The Court should riot allow any juror to thwart its screening process by giving inaccurate
answers and.thereby-createsuch. a.grave potential, realized.in this.case, for depriving the: defendant.
of her:right toa. fair trial. A. new 'trialiis required.
