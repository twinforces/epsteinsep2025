Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document614_ Filed 02/24/22 Page11of12
notwithstanding these prejudices he is determined to listen to the evidence, and be governed by it;
but the law will not trust him.” Burr, 25 F. Cas. at 50. Such a juror “may declare that he feels no
prejudice in the case; and yet the law cautiously incapacitates him from serving on the jury because
it suspects prejudice, because in general persons in a similar situation would feel prejudice.” Jd.

In addition to these situations in which bias must be implied, there are situations where
bias may be inferred. “Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of
partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror
for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.” Torres, 128 F.3d at 47.

Here, Juror 50’s media statements establish both implied and inferred bias. The average
person who was sexually victimized and had Juror 50’s feelings about the crime and those who
complain about it could not be fair, his protestations to the contrary notwithstanding. To borrow
Chief Justice Marshall’s phrase, Juror 50 should have been “cautiously incapacitate[d]” from
serving on this jury.

CONCLUSION

The Court should not allow any juror to thwart its screening process by giving inaccurate
answers and thereby create such a grave potential, realized in this case, for depriving the defendant
of her right to a fair trial. A new trial is required.
