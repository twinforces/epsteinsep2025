following a high-profile trial does not establish bias. This common occurrence is not necessarily
nefarious. See Stewart, 317 F. Supp. 2d at 440. Even if Juror 50 were selfishly seeking his
fifteen minutes of fame, his interview “would have garnered the same amount of media attention
after a verdict of acquittal.” Jd.

The Defendant next argues that “the victims’ testimony personally resonated with [Juror
50] in a way that jurors who had not been sexually abused as children would not have felt.”

deliberations” and to explain why he “‘believe[d] a certain way based on all the evidence that was
provided during the trial.” Hearing Tr. at 22. The Court does not agree, as an initial matter, that
these statements demonstrate bias. A foundational principle is that jurors rely on their common
sense and life experiences to adjudge guilt. All jurors have no doubt experienced the recall of
