who is criminally:responsible:for the: commission of the offense, but need. not have: been

criminal. participants inthe offenses involving “Jane” and.Annic.Farmer were Epstein and. Ms.
Maxwell. There is eertainly‘no ‘support. in the record that, Ms: Maxwell.supervised. Epstein: In

7 Because the Court ruled that “Kate” is‘not.a victim of the offenses’ of:conviction, Probation.and the government
agree, that the: conduct:rclated to **Kate” cannot.bertreated asia separate-offense group: and.is not subjeet to.a
Guidelines analysis. See.PSR at ‘58-59: Westherefore: do not address the application-of any enhaneements:or
