Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document600_ Filed 02/11/22 Page 12 of 37

The defense followed up with a letter requesting that the Court give the jury the
following additional instruction to avoid a conviction on the substantive Mann Act counts based
on a constructive amendment or a prejudicial variance:

As to the third element of Count Two, you must determine whether the

Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant acted with

the intent that Jane would engage in sexual activity within the state of New York

in violation of New York Penal Law 130.55.

As to the second element of Count Four, you must determine whether the

Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the Defendant transported

New York in violation of New York Penal Law 130.55.

An intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York

cannot form the basis of these two elements of Counts Two and Four.
(Dkt. 566). The defense further argued that it would be insufficient and improper for the jury to
convict Ms. Maxwell based solely on New Mexico conduct and that the instruction was
necessary to prevent that outcome. Tr. 3152:11-3154:10. The Court declined to give the
supplemental instruction. The jury ultimately convicted Ms. Maxwell on Count Four and the
two Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three.

indictment.” United States v. Gross, No. 15-cr-769 (AJN), 2017 WL 4685111, at *20 (S.D.N.Y.
Oct. 18, 2017) (cleaned up). “Because the doctrine of constructive amendment protects a
defendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a constructive amendment constitutes a ‘per se violation’
of the defendant’s constitutional rights—i.e. there is no requirement that a defendant make a
