bchavior was ‘voluntary, the defendant. argues that Carolyn did not ‘do “whatever [Epstein and.
Maxwell] asked. of her’?’—noting that Carolyn did-not travel ‘with them to Little SaintJames. (Def.
Mem. 21). But that shows only that their undue influence: was not all-consuming, not that they

lacked influence whatsoever. The standard is “‘undue:influence,’ not-coereion.” United States‘v.
Montijo-Maysonet, 874 F.3d34, 52 (1st.Cir. 2020).

The defendant also. argues that application ‘of this enhancement would constitute: double-
counting because the base offense level for Counts Three, Four, and. Six. covers her conduct:
enticing and coercing ‘minors.. (Def. Mem. 20). This.argument lacks merit. As the defendant.
correctly notes, “[iJmpermissible double counting occurs when one part of the Guidelines is
applied to increase the défendant’s sentence to reflect the kind of harm that has already been fully
accounted for by another part. of the Guidelines.” Watkins, 667 F.3d.at 261. ‘But “when. the
challenged’part of the Guidelines aim[s] at different harms emanating from the same conduct, there
is no. impermissible double counting,” and “[é]nhaneements are not duplicative when they reflect.
different facets of the defendant’s conduct.” Jd, at 261-62 (alterations, ‘citations, and internal,
quotation marks omitted).

The relevant inquiry therefore. is whether the base offense level. is aimed at the same harm.
as the enhancement. Here, itis not: the base offense level (which refers to § 2G1.3) captures the
category of sex offenses against minors, and § 2G1.3(b)(2)(B) applics ‘to the usé of undue:
influence. See: United States v..Kohlmeier, 858 F. App’x.444, 446-47 (2d Cir..2021) (describing
the ‘focus of § 2B1..3(b)(2)(B)); United States v. Arbaugh, 951 F.3d 167, 1°73 (4th Cir. 2020) (“By
its. plain terms, § 2G'1.3(b)(2)(B) focuses .on a. different aggravating factor (unduc influence) than.
§ 2G1.3 (minor victims) . . . .. As such, subsection, (b)(2)(B) does not ‘consider’ the same factor as

these other Guideline provisions.”).
