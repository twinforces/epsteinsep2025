and is belied by an “understanding” months earlier where the government represented that
Accuser-2 “stopped writing in her journal about a month after” her meeting with Epstein, Dkt.
100, p.11 n.2.

Incredibly, the government has never examined or taken possession of the journal and is
relying on the representations of lawyers adverse to Ms. Maxwell in multiple civil litigations, the
same lawyers who have taken an active role in providing the government with selective pieces of
evidence and who regularly bash Ms. Maxwell in the media, hardly a reliable source.”

It is fundamentally wrong to use a part of a writing to, for example, deny bail, or refresh
recollection, or as a past-recollection recorded, or as a prior-consistent statement, and at the same
time ignore the remainder of the writing. The government should know what is in the remainder
of the journal; it simply chooses selective ignorance and relies on lawyers adverse to Ms. Maxwell
for cover. This type of selective disclosure of information is routinely rejected by courts, including
the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Known as the “fairness doctrine,” when one party makes
assertions about parts of a communication or writing the entire communication loses protected
status and requires disclosure to the opposing party. The aim of the doctrine is to protect the adverse
“party, the factfinder, and the judicial process from selectively disclosed and potentially misleading
evidence.” Jn re von Bulow, 828 F.2d 94, 102 (2d Cir. 1987); see also United States v.

2 As Ms. Maxwell previously pointed out, another of BSF's clients confessed to creating a fake
"diary" to sell to a tabloid news journalist, fifteen years after the fact, and while represented by
BSF. See Dkt. 244 at 10 n.4.
