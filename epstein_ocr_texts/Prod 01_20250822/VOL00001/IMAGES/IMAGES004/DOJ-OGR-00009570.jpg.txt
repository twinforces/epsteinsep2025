the Government “consistently maintained that to convict [the defendant] on the Mann Act Counts
(Counts One through Four), it was necessary to prove that [the defendant] enticed or caused
underaged girls to travel to New York, or conspired to do the same, with the intent that they would

never advanced a theory that the illegal sexual activity identified in the S2 Indictment was sexual

“most of [Jane’s] trips were to New York” and “the majority of Jane’s testimony about the trips
consisted of a description of Epstein’s house in New York and the sexual abuse she experienced

including flight records and photographs of Epstein’s New York residence. On the conspiracy

conduct directed at New York. The Government explained that Count Two “is about Jane and
