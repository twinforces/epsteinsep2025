discovery and an expansive hearing—requests that present exactly the sort of “evil consequences”
of which the Second Circuit has warned: “subjecting juries to harassment, inhibiting juryroom
deliberation, burdening courts with meritless applications, increasing temptation for jury
tampering and creating uncertainty in jury verdicts.” United States v. Ianniello, 866 F.2d 540, 543
(2d Cir. 1989). While the Government consents to a hearing, its scope “should be limited to only
what is absolutely necessary to determine the facts with precision.” Jd. at 544. Such a hearing
should be limited to questioning of Juror 50 by the Court, in order to determine: (1) whether he
deliberately lied in response to Question 48, regarding being a victim of sexual abuse, and, if so,
(2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 50 for cause if he had accurately responded to that
question, i.e., based on a finding that he could not be fair and impartial.

categories of prospective jurors: (1) prospective jurors that both the Government and defense
counsel agreed should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both the Government and
defense counsel agreed should be excused or struck for cause; (3) prospective jurors that defense
counsel, but not the Government, believed should be excused or struck for cause; and (4)
prospective jurors that the Government, but not defense counsel, believed should be excused or
struck for cause. /d. at 2:22-3:4. In addition, the Court sent the parties a list of 13 prospective
