Indictment. The Defendant has nevertheless failed to show that she was substantially prejudiced
by this evidence. See Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 621.

When a defendant has notice of the government’s theory of the case before trial, she is
not prejudiced by a variance. See Kaplan, 490 F.3d at 129-30. Pretrial disclosures may put a
defendant on notice of evidence not specifically included in the indictment. See Khalupsky, 5
F.4th at 294. And a defendant’s failure to object to allegedly surprising evidence or to request a
continuance when evidence is introduced suggests that a defendant was not unfairly surprised or
prejudiced. See Kaplan, 490 F.3d at 130.

Here, the Defendant had sufficient notice of the Government’s theory of the case, and of
Jane’s testimony regarding New Mexico specifically, to avoid substantial prejudice. The
Indictment charged a scheme to sexually abuse underage girls in New York. In service of this
scheme, the Indictment alleged that Epstein and the Defendant groomed the victims for abuse at
various properties and in various states, including Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico. Jane had
long recalled traveling to New Mexico, see Maxwell Br. at 16-17, although she did not report
that Epstein had engaged in sexual activity with her at this property until closer to trial. But the
Defendant had adequate notice of this particular testimony such that there was no danger of
substantial prejudice. The Defendant received the Government’s notes of Jane’s interview where
she recalled abuse in New Mexico on November 6, 2021, more than three weeks before trial. At
that point, the parties were still litigating the very instructions for Kate and Annie that the
Defendant claims she would have sought for Jane had she received adequate notice. See, e.g.,
Nov. 23, 2021 Tr. at 28-38; see also Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (concluding in part that the
defendant was not “unfairly and substantially” prejudiced because “[t]he government disclosed
the evidence and exhibits . . . four weeks prior to trial”). Moreover, that the Defendant did not
