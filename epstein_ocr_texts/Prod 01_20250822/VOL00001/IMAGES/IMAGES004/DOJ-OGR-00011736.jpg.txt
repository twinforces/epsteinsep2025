MS. STERNHEIM: Until now, e6ven though they got ‘money’
from a fund, their words have: been. untested. and unchallenged,

and, for the first ‘time, they are being put to 'the ‘test, whether

they support the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.
You have Heard about ‘the presumption of innocence.
That is what every person charged with a crime is cloaked in.

No jury can remove ‘that unless thé government proves each and

every element of each count beyond a reasonable doubt. and they
won't. bé able ‘to do that, ‘they won,"t bé able to meét their

burden...

As I said before, Jeffrey Epstein is not. here,

Ghislaine is here, but you, have the power at, the end of this

case after we've cone back and present argument to show how the
government has not met ats burden. You have the ‘power to
return a verdict 6f nét guilty for Ghislaine Maxwell.

Thank, you,
