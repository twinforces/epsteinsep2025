1 MS. STERNHEIM: Until now, even though they got money
2 from a fund, their words have been untested and unchallenged,

3 and for the first time, they are being put to the test, whether
4 they support the charges beyond a reasonable doubt.

S You have heard about the presumption of innocence.

6 That is what every person charged with a crime is cloaked in.

7 No jury can remove that unless the government proves each and

8 every element of each count beyond a reasonable doubt and they
9 won't be able to do that, they won't be able to meet their

10 burden.

11 As I said before, Jeffrey Epstein is not here,

12 Ghislaine is here, but you have the power at the end of this

13 case after we've come back and present argument to show how the
14 government has not met its burden. You have the power to

15 return a verdict of not guilty for Ghislaine Maxwell.

16 Thank you.

17 THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Sternheim.

18 Let's take a 10-minute break for the jury and we'll

19 have the government call its first witness.
20 Members of the jury, 10-minute break. Thank you.
