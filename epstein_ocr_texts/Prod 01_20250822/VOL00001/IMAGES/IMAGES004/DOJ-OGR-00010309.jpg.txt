‘Question:49, which asked. “Have you or a friend or family. member ever been accused of sexual
harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault?” (Court Exhibit #1 at 25). Juror 50 had answered
“No.” (/d.). Although Juror.50 initially claimed.that-this was an, accurate response’ because he
did not.consideér his stepbrother a “family member,” Juror 50 eventually admitted that this was
not an accurate answer. and. that:the truthful answer was “Yes (friend or family member)”
because a’ stepbrother is.a, family member and Juror 50’s mother reported the stepbrother’s sexual,
abuse to'the, police when. Juror 'S0, disclosed it to her several years after it happened. (Tr. 8-9, 11-
13).

Accordingly; the record is clear that: several of Juror 50’s voir dire'responses were false,
satisfying the first prong of the McDonough test. See United States v. Stewart,,433 F.3d.273,
303 (2d Cir. 2006) (“[A] party alleging unfairness based. on-undisclosed.juror bias must.
‘demonstrate ‘first, that: the juror’s voir dire résponse'was false and sccond, that the correct.
response would have provided a-valid.basis for.a challenge for cause.” (citing: McDonough
Power Equipment, ne-v. Greenwood, 464'U.S. 548, 556 (1984)).'

Il. Had Juror 50 Answered the Questions Truthfully, He Would Have Been Struck for

The:Court must next consider whether the correct: responses to, the voir dire questions
would.have provided. Ms. Maxwell-with:a-valid basis:to challenge: Juror 50 for cause. See
Stewart, 433 F.3d at.303., The Court:must determine whether Juror 50 was capable of being an

impartial, unbiased juror “capable and, willing to décidé the case solely on the evidence before
