massages progressed to ‘involve sexual activity, and, Ms.. Maxwell’s role ‘in, facilitating those
‘massages. Based on all of the information now before the Court, including: a substantially more
‘detailed:proffer by the Government.as to the anticipated:testimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3
(Nov. 5, 2021); see also’ Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43, the Court concludes that ‘some of the anticipated
testimony may serve as dircet evidence of the Mann Act.counts.

The Government rightly acknowledged at the November | pretrial conference that 'Ms.
Maxwell cannot be found. guilty on this'witness’s testimony’ alone foriany of the crimes charged.
in-the Indictment. Nov. 1,,2021 Tr. at 67:1.2-25), 68:13-19, 69:4-9, 70:23-71:2, 72:22-25. As the
Government acknowledged, with respect to the jury’s determination iin this casc, this witness is
at 164:19-165:3.2 However, evidence of. legal conduct. can of. course be relevant. evidence of
illegality. And,conduet that cannot itsclfform:the basis of a conviction can ‘serve. as. direct:
evidence of the crimes charged. See, e.g, United States v. Robinson, 702 F.3d 22, 37 (2d Cir.
2012) (affirming admission, of defendant:pimp’s relationship with and control oyer;women'who
worked.as prostitutes as direct evidence of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) charge). Thus some of the
anticipated testimony: described above:can. serve as direct evidence, notwithstanding the fact that
the alleged conductas to’ Witness-3 was not illegal for the purpose of the charges in this case.

Portions of the anticipated testiniony may also serve permissible:purposes under Rule:
404(b), namely proving motive, intent, and-knowledge. See Fed. ‘R. Evid. 404(b)(2). The

witness is expected to testify about certain, statements. by’Ms. Maxwell. ‘For example, the

* Atthe.November.1 conference, the Court denied the Defendant’s:motion to preclude the Government from
referring to alleged. victims as “‘victims” and “minor. victims?” Nov. ‘1.2021. Tr.at-4.. In contrast’to: the-othervalleged
‘ictiny witnesses, itis: not (nor‘could it be) the Government’s litigating:position that this witness is a victim of the
‘crimes:chargedin'the Indictment. Given this, the Government may not refer'to:this; witness as a “victim” ora
“minor victim” in. front of the:jury. Doing so would-constitute prejudicial-error. for the reasons’ explained ‘inthis:
