Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 644 _ Filed 03/11/22 Page 13 of 32

The government’s invocation of /anner-and Janniello is strikingly: disingenuous. Both
cases involved alleged conduct during trial. and, crucially; during deliberations. The interest: in
“shielding jury deliberations from:public scrutiny” is what motivated the Supreme Court’s
decision, in ‘/anmner, 483 U:S. at 119, and the Second Circuit’s. cautionarynote in /unnicllo, 866
F.2d at '543.

In this case, by contrast, there is at least onc juror who falsely answered voirdire
questions to gain’a, scat: on, the jury; conduct that occurred oitside the jury room. The reluctance
of courts to. second-guess, jury deliberations: by:inquiring into. how:the jury reached :its. decision
simply has no:relevance here, and:neither:do Jaaner or lanniello.

In fact, the government's reliance on Jannicllo is: doubly wrong, because the Second
Circuit there sct aside any reluctance it might have-had to question the conduct. of deliberations
by ordering the defendant’s requested evidentiary hearing. A’s the Court explained, “a, post-trial,
jury hearing must be held’when.a party comes forward with ‘clear, strong, substantial and
incontrovertible evidence . . . that a specific, non-speculative impropriety has occurred.”
lanniello, 866 F.2d at.543 (quoting United States. Moon,'718 F.2d 12.10, 1234 (2d,Cir. 1983)).4
Here, of course, the government concedes: Ms.. Maxwell’s entitlement to:an evidentiary: hearing.

The government, cannot with a. straight face claim that'Ms. Maxwell’s motion risks
exposing Juror No. 50 to harassment.and intimidation. Let’s be clear. The Ga/reason Ms.
Maxwell knows of. Juror. No. 50’s false answers during voir dire:is that Juror'No. 50. has sought
out the limelight. He ‘has sat for several, interviews. with journalists, he has allowed himself'to be
videotaped, he has Tweeted and publicized himself on. social. media, and-he has even participated

* To be clear, this. standard.docs not apply:to Ms. Maxwell’s claim; it applics. when a new

trial motion alleges misconduct-during deliberations. Janniello, 866 F.3d at 543; Moon, 718 F.3d.
at 1234.
