In evaluating the probity of specific instances of conduct, courts consider numerous
factors, including “whether the testimony of the witness in question is crucial or
unimportant, the extent to which the evidence is probative of truthfulness or
untruthfulness, the extent to which the evidence is also probative of other relevant
matters, the extent to which the circumstances surrounding the specific instances of
conduct are similar to the circumstances surrounding the giving of the witness’s
testimony, [and] the nearness or remoteness in time of the specific instances to trial.

conduct is relevant to Mr. character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, and all the
conduct is inadmissible under Rule 608(b).
The Eleventh Circuit’s decision in Ad-Vantage Telephone Directory Consultants, Inc. v.
GTE Directories Corp. makes the point. In that case, Ad-Vantage called Leonard Anton as an
expert witness regarding lost profits /d. at 1462. Anton was a CPA and lawyer. /d. Over
objection, the court permitted GTEDC to cross-examine Anton about, among other things, his
borrowing money from clients. /d. at 1462-63. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit reversed, even
though as a consequence of the reversal the case would have to be tried for a fourth time. Id. at
