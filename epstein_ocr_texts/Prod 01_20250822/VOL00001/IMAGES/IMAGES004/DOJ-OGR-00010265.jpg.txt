1 The parties' briefing, I'll ask you to submit the

2 briefs with redactions only for protecting juror privacy and

3 juror identity.

4 Any reason not to do that by tomorrow?

5 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

6 THE COURT: By tomorrow?

7 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes.

8 THE COURT: Thank you.

9 So that will put everything on the record. As for
10 today's hearing, the only thing that's redacted is Juror 50's
11 name. And that's redacted on the immunity materials, as well
12 as Mr. Spodek's letter just indicated "Juror 50."

13 Anything further, Ms. Sternheim?
14 MS. STERNHEIM: Not at this time.
15 THE COURT: Ms. Moe?
16 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you.
17 THE COURT: All right. We're adjourned.
18 (Adjourned)
