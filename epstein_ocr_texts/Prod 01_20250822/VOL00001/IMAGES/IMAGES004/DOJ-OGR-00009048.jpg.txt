turned red, and he grasped for words when the Daily Mail reporter told him about
Question 48. “Interesting,” Juror No. 50 said, struggling for an explanation. Unable to
credibly explain away his false answer, Juror No. 50 eventually put together a
nonsensical response: “No, No! I know my face is red because I can feel the blood but, I
honestly—that’s why I answered it that way.”

Second, Juror No. 50’s attempt to justify his false answer by claiming he “flew
through” the questionnaire is not worthy of belief. The questionnaire instructed potential
jurors to “carefully” compete it. No time limitation was imposed for completion of the
questionnaire. It emphasized that only the parties and the Court would know the identities
of the jurors. It advised that there are no “right or wrong” answers, “only truthful
answers.” And it assured jurors that their privacy would be respected and that if an
answer to any question was embarrassing or caused the juror particular concern, they
could alert the Court. The Court must presume Juror No. 50 heeded these instructions.
Indeed, there is compelling evidence that Juror No. 50 carefully followed these
instructions and did not “fly through” the questionnaire, as he now claims. yy
