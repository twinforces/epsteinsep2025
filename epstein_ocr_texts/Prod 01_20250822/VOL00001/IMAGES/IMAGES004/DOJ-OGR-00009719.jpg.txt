(It is possible Juror No. 50 deleted his Instagram account before the trial as he told
the Court and then reactivated it or created a new account after the trial. If this Court
holds a hearing, that will be one question Juror No. 50 must answer.)

Shortly thereafter, Juror No. 50 predictably deleted his Twitter account and his
Instagram account. He also appears to have deleted his Facebook and LinkedIn accounts.
