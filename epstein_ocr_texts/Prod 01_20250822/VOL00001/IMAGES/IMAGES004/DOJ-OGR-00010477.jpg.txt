guards commented that they had never seen a non-violent, non-suicidal detainee subjected to such
drastic conditions.”!The treatment was not based on any claim or evidence that Ms. Maxwell was
suicidal, dangerous, violent, or in need of discipline. Quite the contrary. The policies and actions
implemented to detain Ms. Maxwell violated clearly established rights of inmates to be free from
punishment and unreasonable searches. Courts have been confronted with cases challenging
conditions of confinement in the MDC. See Turkman v. Hasty, 789 F.3d 218 (2d Cir. 2015), which
involved many of the same challenges to conditions of confinement.

There can be no dispute that Ms. Maxwell’s detention was far more arduous and constituted
a more serious penalty than conventional detention is general population. While the hardship of
imprisonment is normally measured in quantitative terms, i.e., by the length of the prison term, the
hardship and deprivations experienced by Ms. Maxwell also had a qualitative aspect. The
difference between Ms. Maxwell’s isolation and typical prison conditions is so pronounced that
they differ not only in degree but in nature. This distinction demands a different calibration
whereby each day spent in isolation - especially where isolation is not based on any behavior
manifested by the inmate and while the inmate is presumed innocent - should result in an enhanced
time-served credit.
Incarceration During the Pandemic Supports a Well-Recognized Sentence Reduction

Courts in this district and elsewhere have acknowledged COVID hardship as a basis for
downward variances from the guidelines. But even “before the current pandemic, courts had
recognized that periods of pre-sentence custody spent in unusually hard conditions merited
recognition by courts in measuring the just sentence.” United States v. Romero, 15 CR. 445-18
*! Other similarly charged defendants, e.g., Keith Raniere , 18 Cr. 204 (NGG) (NEXIUM case), and
Robert Sylvester Kelly, aka “R. Kelly,” 19 Cr. 286 (AMD), were detained in general population.
