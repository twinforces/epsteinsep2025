1 assets, and then reported $22 million in assets in support of

2 the December 2020 bail application. The claim now of an

3 inability to pay the fine, as I understand it, at the same time
4 in which the defense has not provided documentation of her

a marriage or the purported pending divorce settlement. So I am
6 unpersuaded based on the balance of facts that the defendant is
7 indigent, and I do intend to impose a fine.

8 I will address restitution at the end. I understand

9 the government is not seeking restitution. So we will pick

10 that up at the end.

11 All right. With that, I'm going to take a break, and
12 then I will come back and hear from -- just fill a few

13 formalities. Neither of the papers make an argument for formal
14 downward departures, as I understood them. In any event, I've
15 considered whether there's an appropriate basis for departure
16 from the advisory range within the Guideline system and do not
17 find any grounds warranting departure under the Guidelines.

18 When we return with the Guideline calculation

19 complete, I will hear from the parties as to what they contend
20 a reasonable sentence is for Ms. Maxwell, taking into account
2l the 3553(a) factors.
22 It's 12:30, which is a shocking fact to me. I suppose
23 we should take a 30-minute break so that everyone can get
24 lunch, as I imagine we still have a fair amount of matters to
25 discuss and time to get through. So we'll take a 30-minute
