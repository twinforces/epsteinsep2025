Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 609 Filed 02/24/22 Page5of13

Intervention in this action by Juror 50 would not prejudice either party to this action. If
granted, intervention would also not delay resolution of the issue subject to a possible inquiry, on
the merits.

For these reasons and those further set forth below, the technical requirements for
intervention are satisfied here. Additionally, the principles of justice, fairness and common-sense
weigh strongly in favor of allowing Juror 50 to intervene. As such, Juror 50’s motion to
intervene and for the release of the sealed Jury Questionnaire and voir dire materials should be
granted, as requested herein
