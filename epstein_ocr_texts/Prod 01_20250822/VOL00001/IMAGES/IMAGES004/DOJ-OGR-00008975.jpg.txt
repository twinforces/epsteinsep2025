Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The annexed documents, previously submitted under seal, contain proposed redactions in
conformance with the Court’s Orders (Dkt. 596, 605). |

The proposed redactions are intended to ensure the integrity of the fact-finding process to
uncover the truth surrounding Juror 50’s conduct during the voir dire process, to ensure juror anonymity
and privacy, and to preserve specific factual information developed by the defense that has not been
publicly reported and that the defense proposes to inquire about at any forthcoming hearing.

In an abundance of caution, we have proposed redactions to information and data about the
responses of other jurors (selected and prospective) to the jury questionnaire because the questionnaires
and sealed portions of the voir dire transcript are not part of the public record. The public disclosure of
juror information, even if provided anonymously, risks compromising the integrity of the jury selection
process and the willingness of potential jurors to disclose personal information.

Very truly yours,
/s/
BOBBI C. STERNHEIM
