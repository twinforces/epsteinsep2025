$2,20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:
conformance with the Court’s Orders (Dkt. 596, 605)."

The proposed redactions are intended to ensure the integrity ‘of the fact-finding process'to
uncover the truth surrounding Juror.50’s, conduct during the voir dire process, to ensure juror anonymity’
and privacy; and to preserve specific factual. information developed by the defense that has:not been.
publicly reported.and that the defense’ proposes to inquire about, at. any. forthcoming hearing.

In.an abundance of caution, we have proposed ‘redactions to information and, data about the
responses. of other. jurors (sclected and:prospective) to the:jury questionnaire because the questionnaires
and sealed, portions of the voirdire transeript are not part of the public record. ‘The public disclosure of
juror information, even if provided arionymously, risks compromising:the integrity of the jury sclection
process and the willingness of potential jurors to disclose:personal information.
