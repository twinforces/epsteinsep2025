1 Q. Sometime after the reading of the note from Juror No. 1,

2 did you spéak to Ms. Trzaskoma about Ms. Conrad, Juror No. 1?

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. Would you tell the Court what was said between you and Ms.
5 Trzaskoma at that time.

6 A. Yes. I recall that we had a conversation. I believe it

7 was as we were walking across Foley Square towards Duane

8 Street. She told me that there was a person with the same name
9 as -- I don't recall whether she said Juror No. 1 or Ms.

10 Conrad, but a person with the same name who was a disbarred

it lawyer but that it was not the same person as Juror No. 1.

12 I began formulating a question to say, how do you

Ls know? She anticipated that question and said, because of the
14 voir dire. I began formulating the question of, what question
15 during the voir dire would have disclosed that? She

16 anticipated that question as I was speaking it and said

17 something to the effect that her educational background did not
18 include law schocl, I said, then it"s not the same person?

14 And she said right. By that time we had finished crossing the
20 street.
21 Q. <Any further discussion about Juror No, 1?
22 A. Not with Ms. Trzaskoma during that time period.
23 Q. Any further discussion with anyone at the Brune firm
