basis for a cause challenge or a peremptory challenge. Juror No. 50’s false answers to
both questions deprived the Court of any basis for any meaningful inquiry on a topic
bearing directly on his ability to serve impartially and the basis for a cause challenge. In
addition, the failure to be truthful on both questions cannot be purely accidental; rather, it
suggests the juror’s intention to shield disqualifying information to advance a desire to
serve, which he has now exploited for self-promotion. !°

We know, moreover, that Juror No. 50 gave at least one other false answer during
voir dire. He falsely said he only used Facebook and Instagram, and he did not mention
Twitter, despite being specifically asked about it. He also said that he deleted his social
media accounts. That was not true since, as we now know, he used Twitter to publicize
his interviews with the press and to communicate directly to Annie Farmer and then
posted on Instagram about his service as a juror.

Truthful answers from Juror No. 50 would have led the Court and the parties to
probe much more deeply into his biases and prejudices, both known and unknown.'’ Had
that happened, the record shows that he would have been removed as a potential juror.

‘6 Juror No. 50 continues his media exploits despite being the subject of this
Motion and represented by counsel. On January 18, 2022, he appeared in a documentary
produced by ITV. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SvnwRuDfrdM at timestamps

'7 This follow-up questioning would not have been a mere formality. We know,
for example, that that Juror No. 55 did not truthfully answer the Court’s questions about
social media use, and it took follow-up questioning proposed by defense counsel to
“smoke out” his falsehoods.
