reecive more scrious punishment than. those defendants who have never been.convicted of a-sex
offense. In this case, the reverse would happen. If we:assume. for the: sake of.argument:that.Ms.
Maxwell. had. been convicted. of a prior sex offense and that § 4B1.5(a) therefore applicd, Ms.
Maxwell’s'recommended sentencing range under. the 2004 Guidelines would be 262-327 months:

based on a Combined. Adjusted Offense Level of 35 and a.criminal history catégory of V. See

USSG 8§ 4B1.5(a)(1)(A) & (a)(2)(B) (2004). By contrast, if we assume the facts
‘Maxwell has never been, convicted of a:prior:sex offense and. § 4B1.5(b) therefore applics—her
recommended sentencing range under the 2004 Guidelines: is 292-365 months based.on.a
Combined, Adjusted Offense Level of 40 and a criminal history category of |. See USSG §§
ABi1:5(b)(1) & (b)(2) (2004). Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell is subject'to, a-substantially higher
Guidelines range than a defendant who-had been. previously convicted of a:scx offense. Such.a
result; would. be unjust and contrary to the express purpose of § 4B1.5.°

Furthermore, by applying; § 4B1..5 Ms. Maxwell. would face the same sentencing range
that Jeffrey Epstein would. face for'the:same offenses, cven.though he was indisputably the more
culpable offender. If would be fundamentally unjust.and contrary to the goals, of sentencing for
the Court to apply the Guidelines in:a-way that. would create no meaningful distinction between.
the most serious offenders and those with lesser culpability., See United States vi Dorvee, 616

E.3d 174, 186-87 (2d.Cir. 2010) (“[A]dherence'to the Guidelines results in virtually no

distinction between.the: sentences for [less culpable] defendants. ....and the sentences. for the most
dangerous offenders... This result, is fundamentally incompatible with § 3553(a).”);.see also
