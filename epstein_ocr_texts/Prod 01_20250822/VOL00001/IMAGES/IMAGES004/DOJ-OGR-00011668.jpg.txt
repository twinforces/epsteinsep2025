1 wetre all on the same page. We're waiting for our 58 remaining
2 jurors to arrive and go to the two courtrooms where they're

3 being held. Once we have everyone -- hopefully we'll have

4 everyone, but once we everyone, the Live feed into those two

5 rooms will come on, I'll say good morning to everyone, I'll ask
6 the two questions that we've discussed, whether they've read or
7 heard anything, and whether there's any reason they can't be

8 fair and impartial, and that they should raise their hands if

9 the answer to either of those questions is yes. I believe both
10 teams will have someone in each of the courtrooms; and, of

11 course, we'll have courthouse staff in the courtrooms. And

12 we'll get indication if there are any hands raised. If there
13 are, we'll bring them in one at a time. I'll have them in the
14 witness box and inquire as to what the basis for the yes

15 response is, and we'll deal with that as we would any other

16 jury selection issues.

17 Once we've resolved that, any of those issues with

18 respect to the first 40 people in ascending order, my plan is
19 to have all of those 40 in the same holding courtroom. And
20 then counsel will exercise their peremptories. I have the
21 board with the numbers of the jurors which will be finalized.
22 We'll come to sidebar and alternate strikes for your
23 peremptories. We'll do first with respect to Jurors 1 through
24 28, the primary juror, ten and six alternating, and then three
25 each with respect to 29 through 40 for the alternates, three
