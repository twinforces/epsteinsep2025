may be made available to Maxwell, if appropriate, at the conclusion of each witness’s direct
testimony.”°? Maxwell also appears to have sought subpoenas directed to “four individuals
seek[ing] similar materials,” including EVCP materials, a request this Court denied in August
2021, again without prejudice to renewal.*°

On November 15, 2021, we learned that Maxwell sought leave to serve a subpoena on
Ms. Feldman for certain EVCP documents and that the Court intended to authorize the subpoena.
That same day, we informed the Court that we were authorized to accept service of the subpoena
and that Ms. Feldman intended to move to quash it. We received a copy of the subpoena on
November 16, 2021. The subpoena requests four categories of materials from four individual
victims: (i) “EVCP Material” (as defined in the subpoena) for the four victims; (11)
communications between the EVCP and the four victims “and/or their Attorneys”; (ii1) copies of
payments to the victims “and/or their Attorneys”; and (iv) any releases that the four victims
executed.

The government filed its motion to quash the subpoena yesterday, which provides ample
basis to quash the subpoena. Ms. Feldman sets forth the following additional reasons to quash
the subpoena.
