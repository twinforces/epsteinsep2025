persuasive -- dlong with the other sources and opinions we've
cited, it's persuasive authority for the fact this is a jury
decision, not a Court detérmindtion.

THE COURT: Are you leaving that argument?

MR. EVERDELL: Yés, your Honor.

THE COURT: We'll do a little back-and-forth so I have
everybody's arguments in mind. Thank ‘you.

Go ahead, Ms. Moe.

MS. ‘MOE? Thank you, ‘your Honor.

The government is confident the 2004 Manual applies in
this Gase. TI believe we did engage with the ex pdést. facto
issue thoroughly in oun brief. The questaon is whether the
factual record at trial establishes that the offense continuéd
throughout the duration of 2004, which it emphatically did.

The téstamohy of a crime victim who testified at this trial
establishes that. the offense conduct, went past November 1,
2004.

THE COURT: So J, ‘think the framing of the question

here is very important and its téecéhhical == this whole

discussion, is very technical. It seems to me the question is

can the government point to a préepohderance of the evidence
that, conspiratorial conduct took place in this very small, time
window, basically November and Décenber 2004. That is what's
in, issue, and the question. is what the trial record establishes
with respect to that two-month window.
