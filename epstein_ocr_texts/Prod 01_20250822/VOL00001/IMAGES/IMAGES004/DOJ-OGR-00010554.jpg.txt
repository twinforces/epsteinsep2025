current:version of the Guidelines as representing the most recent views of the agency charged. by
Congress with developing sentencing policy.” Peieh, 569 U.S. at 549.

Where the: Guidelines have increased. after the offense: conduct has concluded, “the court
shall, use the Guidelines. (Manual, in effect on the date ‘that; the offense of conviction, was
committed.” U.S.S.G. § IB1.11(b)(1). ‘Furthermore, Application Note 2 provides ‘that. “the. last.

course of:the:offense conduct. ‘The'Sccond Circuit has: explained that “[w]here-a conspiracy began.

application of the later version to, the coconspirators docs ‘not violate the Ex Post
Facto:‘Clause.” United States v. -Meneilly, 28 F. App’x.26, 32 (2d Cir. 200.1) (citations omitted).

Here, the offenses, of conviction. spanned from, 1,994 up'to and. including 2004, as:sct forth,
in. the. Indictment, arid.as the proof cstablished. at''trial. As, a result, for Guidelines purposes,
December 311, 2004 is legally the last.date of the offense conduct, and. the 2004 Manual applies.
In her objections, to the PSR, the defendant claims that the Ex Posi Facto clause requires the jury,
‘and. not the Court, to determine the last .date ofthe offense of conviction.. The defendant further
claims that, as a factual matter, the offense conduct ended before November 1, 2004, the dateupon
which the 2004 Manual. became effective. For the reasons sct forth below; the defendant is wrong

as a matter of law and.as a matter.of fact. The:Court should.apply the 2004 Manual.
