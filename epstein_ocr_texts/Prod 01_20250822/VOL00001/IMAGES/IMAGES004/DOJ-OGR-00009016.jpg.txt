At the end of the very brief voir dire examination, the Court asked Juror No. 50 if
he had “[a]ny doubt about [his] ability to” be fair to both sides. /d. at 134. Juror No. 50
said, “no.” /d. The Court concluded: “Other than what I have asked you, do you have any
reason to think that you can’t be fair and impartial here?” /d. Juror No. 50 responded, “I
do not.” Id.

The Court inquired whether the parties had any follow-up questions. Because
Juror No. 50 denied any bias or inability to be fair and impartial, and because his answers
to the questionnaire did not raise any red flags about his ability to serve as a fair and
impartial juror in a case involving alleged sexual assault and sexual abuse, Ms.
Maxwell’s attorneys did not propose any follow-up questions.
