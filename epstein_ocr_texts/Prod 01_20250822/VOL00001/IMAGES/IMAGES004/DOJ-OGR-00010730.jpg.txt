Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document679 _ Filed 06/26/22 Page2of4

Based on information provided by the Warden and the Chief Psychologist of the MDC this
morning, the Government understands the following regarding the defendant’s current status and
conditions at the MDC. On Friday, June 24, 2022, the Warden of the MDC was informed that the
Bureau of Prisons Inspector General’s Office (the “IG”) had received an email directly from the
defendant from within the MDC claiming to be in fear for her safety. Apparently the defendant
claimed to the IG that she feared MDC staff members were threatening her safety. The Warden
and the Chief of Psychology felt obligated to remove the defendant from general population and
investigate the defendant’s claim. Ordinarily, an inmate raising such a safety concern would be
placed in a single cell of the Special Housing Unit (“SHU”) of the MDC. In circumstances where
the facility is concerned that the inmate is at heightened risk of self-harm, however, the MDC will
instead place the inmate on suicide watch. The Warden and Chief Psychologist indicated that at
least two other inmates have recently been placed on suicide watch in similar circumstances.

Here, the Warden and Chief Psychologist assessed that the defendant is at heightened risk
of self-harm, particularly given her upcoming sentencing and sex offender status. As a result, they
are not comfortable placing the defendant in the SHU, but they also need to remove the defendant
from general population to investigate the threat she reported to the IG. Accordingly, the defendant
was placed on suicide watch. Although the defendant has claimed to psychology staff that she is
not suicidal, she has refused to answer psychology staff's questions regarding the threat she
reported to the IG. While she claimed to the IG to be in fear for her safety, she refused to tell
psychology staff what that fear is. Given the defendant’s inconsistent accounts to the IG and to
psychology staff, the Chief Psychologist assesses the defendant to be at additional risk of self-
harm, as it appears she may be attempting to be transferred to a single cell where she can engage
