Based on.information provided by'the Warden. and the Chief Psychologist of the MDC this
morning, the Government understands the following regarding the defendant’s current status. and.
conditions at the MDC. On Friday, June 24, 2022, the Warden of the MDC was informed. that.the
Bureau of Prisons Inspector General’s Office (the “IG”) had. received. an.email directly :from the:
defendant. from within the MDC claiming to'be in, fear for her safety. Apparently the defendant.
claimed, to the IG that she féarcd MDG staff members were threatening her safety. The Warden
and the Chief of Psychology felt obligated to. remove the: defendant from general population, and.
investigate, the defendant’s claim. Ordinarily, an inmate! raising such a. safety concern would be

the facility is concerned.that the inmate is at-heightencd:risk of self-harm, however, the MDE will.
instead:place ‘the inmate: on suicidé watch. The Wardén and Chief Psychologist. indicated that at
lcast two other inmates have recently: been placed. on. suicide watch:in similar circumstances.

Here, the Warden and. Chief Psychologist; assessed that the defendant is at;heightened risk,
of self-harm,-particularly given herupcoming sentencing and.scx offenderstatus. As a.result, they’
are not comfortable:placing the defendant in the SHU, but they also nced.to remove the defendant.
from gencral population to investigate'the: threat she reported.to the IG. Accordingly, the defendant:
was placed on suicide, watch. Although the defendant.has Claimed to ‘psychology staff that she. is
not suicidal, she has refused. to answer ‘psychology staff's questions regarding the: threat. she
reported to the IG. While she claimed to the 1G to be in fear for her safety, she refused to tell
psychology staff what that fear is. Given the:defendant’s inconsistent. accounts to the IG:and to
psychology staff, the Chicf Psychologist. assesses the defendant to be at additional risk of self-

harm, as it appears she may be attempting'to be transferred to, a singlé ccll where she: can engage
