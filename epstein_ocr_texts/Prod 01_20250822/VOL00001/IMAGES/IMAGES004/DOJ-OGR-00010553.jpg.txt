In a:memorandum.dated.June 15,2022, the defendant-urges the: Court to adopt.a:‘sentencing.
range: of 51. ‘to 63 months’ imprisonment, which. reflects a small fraction of the applicable
sentencing Guidelines range. The:defendant reaches this. low number by disputing four aspects. of
the Probation. Office’s calculation. For the reasons, sct forth below, ‘the Court should. reject: the
the Sentencing Guidelines to recommend such.a short sentence for a defendant who spent. ycars

the 2021 Manual, the base offense ‘level, would. be 30 before any enhancements are applied,
whereas the 2004 Sentencing Guidelines Manual (the “2004 Manual’) provides for a base: offense
‘level.of 24 before: cnhancements. :In.other words, under the 2021.:Manual, the offense level is at:

Asa result, the Court may not apply the 2021, Manual, but the Supreme Court has. made clear that.
