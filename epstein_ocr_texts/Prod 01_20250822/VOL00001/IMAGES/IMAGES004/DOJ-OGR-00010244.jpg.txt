M3 8TMAX1

1 MR. EVERDELL: What was â€”-- we gave a number of those

2 in our submissions, but: You talked publicly about the fact

3 that you were in therapy, what was the nature of the therapy?

4 Does it deal with your experiences as victim of sexual abuse?

5 What was the healing process that you talked about? Describe

6 this healing process for me. Does it involve addressing this

7 issue of prior child sexual abuse? Were you in therapy during

8 the trial? Is this an issue that you are still dealing with?

9 THE COURT: I did review those questions proposed and
10 I considered them. The defense did not propose any comparable
11 questions for jurors during the voir dire process who indicated
12 yes to this question and indicated a history of sexual abuse,
13 so those requests are denied.

14 Any other follow-up requests?
15 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think we need to talk
16 further about the nature of abuse. We talked about the fact
17 this was repeated, happened multiple times. This happened with
18 more than one person, a stepbrother and a friend. I think we
19 need to understand because -- I'm not trying to pry, your
20 Honor, I'm not trying to get into these gory details, but it is
21 relevant, the extent of the similarities of this juror's abuse
22 and whether that lines up with the testimony we heard from the
23 victims is relevant in an inguiry to bias.
24 And I think we need to understand a little more about
25 similar questions that we asked -- we proposed to the Court in
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
