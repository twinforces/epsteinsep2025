Maxwell did:not violate: Rule 16 and.the government has suffered no prejudice, would infringe
this constitutional guarantec. And it would pervert:the search for the truth, mislead the:jury, and

ends of ériminal justice would be. defeated. if judgments:were to be founded.on a partial. or
speculative presentation of the facts.” Nixon, 418 U.S, at.709,

This Court.should deny'the government’s ‘motion.
