Finally, the government’s one-sentence 403 argument fails. Gov. Letter at 6 (“[T]he
agreement runs the risk of ‘confusing the issue’ and ‘misleading the jury’ by presenting a
document from which the jury is asked to infer conclusions that range far beyond the
evidence.”). The jury will not be confused or misled by evidence that Kate could not have visited
Ms. Maxwell at Kinnerton Street in 1994 because Ms. Maxwell did not purchase that home for
another two years. In contrast, jurors wi// be misled if they don’t learn that Kate testified to
something that could not have happened.

“The very integrity of the judicial system and public confidence in the system depend on
full disclosure of all the facts.” United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 709 (1974) (“We have
elected to employ an adversary system of criminal justice in which the parties contest all issues
before a court of law. The need to develop all relevant facts in the adversary system is both
fundamental and comprehensive.”). To that end, Ms. Maxwell has a due process right to present
evidence in her defense. U.S. Const. amend. V, VI. Excluding the 1996 Agreement, when Ms.
Maxwell did not violate Rule 16 and the government has suffered no prejudice, would infringe
this constitutional guarantee. And it would pervert the search for the truth, mislead the jury, and
undermine the integrity of the criminal justice system. In the words of the Supreme Court, “The
ends of criminal justice would be defeated if judgments were to be founded on a partial or
speculative presentation of the facts.” Nixon, 418 U.S. at 709.

This Court should deny the government’s motion.
