Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter moving to preclude one exhibit which the
defendant produced in Rule 16 discovery Friday night. Following the close of the Government’s
case in chief, the defendant produced her witness list and Rule 26.2 disclosures. In addition, the
defendant attached two new documents as Rule 16 discovery: a sale agreement for the defendant’s
London home at 44 Kinnerton Street (attached as Exhibit A) and a judicial opinion in United States
v. Epstein, 96 Civ. 8307 (DC) (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31, 1998). The Government seeks to preclude the
sale agreement under Rule 16.!

The sale agreement should have been disclosed on November 8, 2021, the Court’s deadline
' Although the judicial opinion does not appear to be admissible, the Government plans to confer
with the defense on that document.
