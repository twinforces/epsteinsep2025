1 have papers, so we will have to tab through the binder

2 ourselves; so there may be delays on our end. But that process
3 is fine with us, if that's how the defense would like to

4 proceed.

a THE COURT: All right. Look, if it's just a single

6 piece of paper, for example, with a name, let's just use the

7 paper.

8 MR. EVERDELL: Yes.

9 THE COURT: And otherwise, as I said, we'll try it

10 this way. It sounds like there may be efficiencies, there may
11 not be, but we'll try it just with the caution that I have

12 granted anonymity. And so given the layout of the room, I

13 don't want the -- although the names of the witnesses will be
14 known to the jurors, they should not be published to the

15 courtroom.

16 MR. EVERDELL: We'll try and be very mindful of this,
17 your Honor. That's why we are trying to think through this

18 carefully. Before the cross starts, I'll put the paper binder
19 in the witness box for the witness in case paper has to be
20 used, even though that's a backup option. And I will put the
21 manila folders under the jurors' chairs and they will be
22 instructed not to look at them until the time is appropriate.
23 THE COURT: Okay. And so the government has
24 binders -- are you going to collect those binders for the
25 evening?
