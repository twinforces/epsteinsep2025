“None of that relates to traumatic memory,” he said. Loftus said herself
that she had never conducted a study on whether these tactics would
work with memories of sexual abuse, David recalled.

Since the trial, there has been speculation that the fact a juror had been a
victim of sexual abuse could be used by Maxwell as grounds for appeal.
Speaking separately to MailOnline, David said he could not remember the
details of the 50 question pre-trial questionnaire each potential juror was
asked about whether they were a victim of sexual abuse or a relative or a
friend of a victim, but felt he had answered all questions honestly.
David told The Independent that the accusers’ testimony was
corroborated by a significant amount of evidence.
He specifically mentioned Kate - an accuser who testified but was not
allowed to be considered for the actual charges because she was over the
age of consent in the UK when she was abused — and said her testimony
powerfully corroborated the other accusers’ stories.
“She was able to show us that this was a pattern.” David said. “We knew
we couldn't use her testimony to convict Maxwell, but she showed the
pattern of how those girls were groomed.
“She showed us the pattern that happened to all of these girls.
“It was about confusing their boundaries,” he said. “For Jane, it started
with seeing Maxwell topless. For Annie Farmer, it started with Maxwell
showing her how to give Epstein a foot massage.
“The pattern is that Ghislaine talks to you like she is also a teenager. Then
it moves into massage. She tries to make you comfortable, to see what
they can get away with.
“What she did was wrong.”
Annie Farmer's story was backed up by her teenage diary, as well as her
high school boyfriend. That was important to the jury, he said.
Carolyn’s story was backed up by Shawn, her ex-boyfriend who testified
that he used to drive her to Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion.
