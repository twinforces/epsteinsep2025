The defendant also fails to establish that Juror 50 falsely answered Question 25, when he
gave a negative response to the question whether he or relatives or close friends have been the
victim of a crime. Juror 50 has not publicly disclosed the particulars of any sexual abuse that he
suffered, and thus it is not apparent whether it was in fact a crime. Nor is it apparent that, if the
abuse was criminal, Juror 50 deliberately lied when he answered Question 25 in the negative, as
lay persons often may not think of themselves as victims of a crime even where lawyers and judges
would. See, e.g., Fell, 2014 WL 3697810, at *6-7, *13 (crediting juror’s explanation that she did
not disclose past sexual abuse in response to question about whether she had been a victim of a
crime because she did not consider the abuse, for which the abuser was never prosecuted, a crime);
see also McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.

Finally, the available information does not support the defendant’s claim that Juror 50 lied
during voir dire when he (1) stated that he used Facebook and Instagram, without mentioning that
he had a Twitter account, and (2) stated that he had deleted his social media accounts prior to trial.
(See Nov. 16, 2021 Tr. at 133). First, the screenshot of Juror 50’s Twitter account provided by the
defense states that he joined Twitter in April 2021, had only one follower, and only followed 39
people. (Def. Mem. at 18). That hardly bespeaks an active Twitter user, so it was not even
inaccurate, much less deliberately false, for Juror 50 not to mention Twitter when asked “What did
you use, Facebook, Twitter?” (Nov. 16, 2021 Tr. at 133 (emphasis added)). Second, in support
of the argument that Juror 50 lied about deleting his Facebook and Instagram accounts, the
defendant cites only post-trial activity on his Instagram account, but as the defendant must
acknowledge (Def. Mem. at 20), a deleted account can be reactivated with a few clicks. Indeed,
