Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document643_ Filed 03/11/22 Page 20 of 49

The defendant,also fails to establish that Juror 50. falscly. answered. Question 25, when, he
gave:a. negative response to the question whether he or rélatives or close: fricnds have. been the
victim of.a crime. Juror.50.has not publicly disclosed the particulars of any sexual. abuse that he
‘suffered, and, thus itis not apparent whether it:was.in, facta crime. Nor is:it-apparent that, if the:
abuse was criminal, Juror 50 deliberately licd when he answered Question. 25 in. the negative, as
lay‘persons often may: not think of'themselves as victims of a:crime even where lawyers and judges
would. Se, &-g., Fell, 2014 WL 3697810, at. *6-7, * 13 (crediting juror’s explanation that she: did.
not: disclose: past sexual. abuse:in. response to question about whether she had. been a victim. of'a
crime because she did not.consider the abuse, for which the dbuser'was never prosecuted, a crime);
see also MEDonotigh, 464 U.S. at 555.

Finally, the available information does not. support:the defendant’s claim:that.Juror 50 lied.
during voir dire, when he (1) stated that he: used’Faccbook,and Instagram, without; mentioning that.
he had a Twitter account, and (2) stated that:he had deleted his,social: media aécounts:prior to trial.
(See‘Nov. 16,2021 Tr. at 133), First, the sercenshot-of Juror '50’s Twitter account provided by the
defenise) ‘states that; he joined. Twitter in, April, 2021, had only one follower, and only’ followed, 39
people. (Def. Mem. at 18). That hardly bespeaks an active: Twitter user,, so it’was not even.
inaccurate, much less deliberately false, for Juror 50 not to mention Twitter when asked.““What did
you ise, Faccbook, Twitter?” (Nov. 16,2021 Tr. at 133. (emphasis added)). Second, in:support
‘of the argument. that Juror 50 lied about deleting his ‘Facebook and Instagram accounts, the
defendant. cites only post-trial activity on, his Instagram. account, but as the defendant: must:

acknowledge, (Def. Mem. at.20), a deletéd. account can be. reactivated with a few clicks. Indeed,
