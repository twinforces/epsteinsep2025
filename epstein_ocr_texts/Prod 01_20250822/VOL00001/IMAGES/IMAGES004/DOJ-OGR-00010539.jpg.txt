Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 670 Filed 06/22/22 Page 4of55

Given, the exceptionally serious nature of the defendant’s years-long participation ‘in, the
sexual abuse. of minors, consideration of the relevant factors under 18 U-S.C. § 3553(a) weighs
heavily in favor ofa. sentence within. the Guidelines range of 360 to 660 months’ imprisonment.
Most: significantly, the nature and seriousness, of the offense, the harm. to victims, the need to
promote respect for the law, and the history’ and characteristics of the. defendant weigh heavily in.

The Government addresses cach of these factors in turn. below. However;.certain, aspects
of the: defendant’s submission bear addressing up front. First, the Court should. ‘reject the
defendant’s ‘request for a. reduced. sentence in light of conditions at the Metropolitan Detention.
Center: The defendant’s claims are inaccurate—and in fact, the defendant has enjoyed remarkable
privileges.as a-high-profile inmate:that:vastly exceed the benefits accorded:to the average inmate.
Jt;is unsurprising that 'aywoman,who had led a life of ineredible luxury should, complain, about her
life as a prisoner, but that fact docs not:come close to meriting leniency at sentencing, much, less
the extraordinary: degrce of leniency the defendant secks.

If anything stands out from the defendant’s scntencing submission, it; is her complete
failure to address her offense conduct.and. her utter lack of remorse. Instead of showing even.a.
hint. of acceptance of responsibility, the defendant. makes a desperate attempt to cast. blame
wherever else she can. On that.score, the defendant’s.attempt'to .cast.aspersions on the Government
for. prosecuting, her, and ‘her claim that she is being held-responsible for Epstcin’s crimes, are both.
absurd and offensive. Maxwellwas an .adult-who made her own.choices. She made the choice to
sexually‘exploit numerous underage girls. She:made'the:choice to conspire with.Epstcin for years,

held.accountable for her disturbing role in an-cxtensive child exploitation scheme.
