negotiate an appropriate stipulation with the defense. As to these statements, the Government
would stipulate that a meeting occurred at which the relevant law enforcement officer took notes
of the meeting; that the notes are not verbatim, but the officer believes them to be accurate; and
that the notes contain the specific inconsistent statement.?

Other prior inconsistent statements offered by the defense, however, are inadmissible,
either because they are not inconsistent with the witness’s testimony, concern a collateral matter,
or were already read into the record (such that additional extrinsic evidence on the point would be
cumulative and cause undue delay).

For convenience, the Government provides the following tables:

A. Jane

3509-002 was turned

paragraph.
? The defense letter refers to particular paragraphs in the 3500 material. While that is helpful for
purposes of the inquiry now before the Court, the Government would not stipulate to the entire
paragraphs, which contain material that is often neither consistent nor inconsistent.
