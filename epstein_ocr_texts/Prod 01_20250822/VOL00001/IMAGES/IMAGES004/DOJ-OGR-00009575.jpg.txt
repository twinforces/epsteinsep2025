which gave rise to a constructive amendment. Relative to that evidence, Jane’s testimony about
New Mexico, spanning less than three pages of the transcript of her direct examination, was brief
and general. (Tr. 321-23). All of this evidence was a “a single set of discrete facts consistent with
the charge in the indictment.” Gross, 2017 WL 4865111, at *21 (quoting D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at
419). And even if that were not so, the Government is permitted “significant flexibility in proof”
so long as the defendant has “notice of the core of criminality to be proven at trial,” as the defendant
undoubtedly did. Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 53.

The defendant overstates the issue by suggesting that a constructive amendment would
have occurred if the jury “based their conviction solely on the sexual abuse that Jane experienced
in New Mexico.” (Def. Mot. at 13). In fact, the jury was free to rely principally on that evidence
to satisfy elements of Counts One, Three and Four. That is, the jury could have convicted even if
no sexual abuse occurred in New York, so long as it concluded that the defendant intended for
abuse to occur in New York. And evidence of the defendant’s knowledge of sexual abuse that
occurred in New Mexico would support such a conclusion about the defendant’s intent as to what
would happen in New York. But there is no substantial likelihood that the jury erroneously
convicted the defendant of transporting Jane to New Mexico with the intent that she be abused in
violation of some law in New Mexico. That theory of guilt was neither pursued by the Government
nor available under the Court’s jury instructions. See Lebedev, 932 F.3d at 54 (“[T]he evidence at
trial directly addressed the core of criminality charged in the indictment... .”). It is not a
constructive amendment that the Government presented relevant evidence that could lead to a
