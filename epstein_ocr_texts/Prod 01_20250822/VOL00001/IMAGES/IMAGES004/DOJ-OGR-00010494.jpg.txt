To Honorable Judge Nathan:
My name is Christine Malina Maxwell. | am one of Ghislaine’s sisters. I am fully aware of the charges
to which Ghislaine has been found guilty. Despite this fact, I continue to hold my sister in the
highest regard. This letter is being submitted for your consideration as to her sentencing.
My Background
I will be 72 years old before the end of this year. I have been married to my husband, an endowed
professor of Physics and Art & Technology, for 34 years. We have three grown children: an
emergency medicine doctor, a research scientist, and a data scientist. Following in my mother’s
footsteps, I have a Humanities PhD in the arena of Holocaust Studies from the University of Texas at
Dallas. Professionally, I have taught grade school, worked as an editor and marketing director for an
international scientific and educational publishing company, and served as President & CEO of an
information broker company and two online search engine companies. Today, my Internet
knowledge discovery company strives to help people find actionable insights to foster a better,
safer, smarter world.
What I Particularly Know About My Sister
Ghislaine is human. Each of us is born into this world with no choice into which family. Ghislaine
and my other siblings were all fortunate that our parents were able to provide us witha
comfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, a nice home to grow up in, and we all went
to good public or private schools. Yes, we were privileged, but we were not entitled and life was not
always perfect. Unfortunately, our family also became a grieving family. Our eldest brother Michael
was gravely injured in a car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he remained in a coma until his
death when Ghislaine was seven years old. In spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine learn to
adapt and to become a productive and caring human being.
Ghislaine is independent and upstanding. Two attributes of our parents are pertinent to
understanding foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s character. First, both of our parents had an
incredible work ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to
respect the responsibility that came with that privilege. I have witnessed that work ethic in
Ghislaine. She is a far cry from the media’s wholesale mis-characterization of her as just a ‘British
Socialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect others and to follow the Golden Rule: to treat
each person as we would like to be treated ourselves. I have never seen Ghislaine show any hurtful
intentions or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing. As you have stated on three
occasions, Ghislaine is not a threat to the public.
