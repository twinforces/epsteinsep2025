highest:regard. This letter is being submitted for your consideration as to her sentencing.

What I Particularly Know About My’Sister

‘Ghislaine is human. Each of us is born into this, world with no choice into'which family: Ghislaine:
and my other siblings were all fortunate‘that-our-parents were able:to provide us witha,
comfortable upbringing. We always had enough to eat, :a:nice home to grow up’in, and we all went
to good public or private schools. Yes, we were privileged, but’we were not entitled and life-was not
always perfect. Unfortunately, our family’ also: becamé,a grieving family. Our-eldest brother Michael
was gravely injured ina car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he:remained in acoma until-his
death.when Ghislaine was seven-years old. In: spite of this tragedy, I watched Ghislaine'learn'to
‘dapt.and to become,a'productive.and caring human being.

Ghislaine is:independent and upstanding. Two.attributes of our parents are pertinent to
understanding:foundational aspects of Ghislaine’s character. First, both of‘our parents had-an
incredible :work-ethic. We were all encouraged from an early age to work to earn money and to
respect the responsibility. that came with that privilege. have, witnéssed that work ethic in
Ghislainé. She‘is'a far ery from the média’s wholesale mis-charactérization of her as‘jiist a ‘British
Socialite’. Second, our parents raised us to respect:others and to follow the Golden. Rule: to'treat
each person as we would like to be: treated.ourselves.,I'have never seen Ghislaine show any hurtful
intentions:or tendencies against anyone, including any living thing: As you have stated.on three
occasions, Ghislaine is not a threat'tothe public.
