The Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that Government
Exhibits 405 and 419 reflect registry software information for Government Exhibits 55 and 54,
respectively. Examiner Flatley will explain that such registry software information includes
several fields, including registered organization and registered owner, which are user input data.
He is expected to explain that Government Exhibits 405 and 419 were generated by Access Data
AD Lab.

The Government further anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify that he examined
certain exhibits contained on the devices marked for identification as Government Exhibits 54 and
55. In particular, he is expected to testify that Government Exhibits 412, 415, and 424 are emails
on Government Exhibit 54; Government Exhibits 418, 420, 421, and 422 are Word documents on
Government Exhibit 54; and Government Exhibits 418B, 420B, 421B, and 422B contain the
properties, or metadata, for the corresponding exhibits. Examiner Flatley is expected to testify
that Government Exhibits 418, 420, 421, and 422 were created under a user profile named “gmax.”
He is also expected to testify that Government Exhibit 417 is a Word document stored on
Government Exhibit 55. Examiner Flatley is expected to testify that that the metadata fields listed
on Government Exhibits 417, 418, 420, 421, and 422 are true and accurate reflections of the
metadata properties for those files, such as the fields listing the author, content created date, date
last saved, last saved by, and last printed. Examiner Flatley will explain that he confirmed the
accuracy of metadata fields by running Access Data AD Lab. In the course of doing so, Examiner
Flatley will explain that metadata is information about a file, such as the file name and when the
file was created. He will also explain that metadata can be stored in a computer’s file system or
embedded inside certain files, like Word documents.

The Government also notes that Examiner Flatley discussed similar topics in testimony
referenced in the September 15, 2021 letter. See Trial Tr. at 935-36, United States v. Hirst, 15 Cr.
643 (PKC) (describing metadata); Trial Tr. at 292-93, United States v. Dilomasso, 14 Cr. 160
(SAS) (describing hash values). He has also testified about similar topics in United States v.
Healey, 11 Cr. 132 (SAS).

As noted, the Government does not believe that the foregoing testimony encompasses the
sort of “opinion” that requires expert testimony. Rather, Examiner Flatley’s testimony is based on
his first-hand knowledge and observation during his examination of the devices in question. To
the extent he offers anything resembling an opinion, it is the product of reasoning processes
familiar to the average person. While Examiner Flatley possesses specialized knowledge by virtue
of his training and experience, his testimony reflects his investigatory findings and conclusions,
and is not rooted exclusively in his expertise. To the extent Examiner Flatley’s testimony is
characterized as expert “opinion” testimony under Rule 702, we note that his experience and
training are described in his curriculum vitae, which was produced to you on September 15, 2021
bearing Bates number 3503-001.
