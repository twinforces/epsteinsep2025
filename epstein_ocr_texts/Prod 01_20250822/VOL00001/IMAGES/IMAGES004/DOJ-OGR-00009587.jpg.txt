need to repeat those instructions in the context of the full charge, which clarified that “the violation
of law is as charged in New York.” (Tr. 2774-75, 2777). And the fact that the defense failed to
seek or receive a limiting instruction before Jane’s testimony did not provide a separate basis for
including a limiting instruction in the final charge. (Tr. 2777). The Court, the Government, and
the defense were painstaking during trial to ensure that the jury understood that the Mann Act
counts required an intent to commit a criminal sexual act in New York. That the defense missed
an additional opportunity for a limiting instruction is not a prejudicial variance, much less a
constructive amendment.

The S2 Indictment charged three conspiracies under 18 U.S.C. § 371. Counts One and
Three were predicated on two different provisions of the Mann Act, whereas Count Five charged

2021 Order, the Government was entitled to present these three different counts to the jury. (Dkt.
No. 207 at 27). Following the verdict, however, the Government agrees that the Court should enter
judgment on only one of the Mann Act conspiracy counts, given the similarities between those
counts. Accordingly, of the three conspiracy counts charged in the S2 Indictment, the Government
submits that the Court should enter judgment on Count Three, which was predicated on 18 U.S.C.
§ 2423(a), and Count Five, which was predicated on 18 U.S.C. § 1591.

Counts Three and Five are not multiplicitous, and the Court should enter judgment on both
counts. In particular, as discussed in greater detail below, Counts Three and Five arose from
different criminal schemes, involving different criminal conduct, different statutory predicates,
and a different modus operandi. The defendant ignores these important distinctions, claiming, in
