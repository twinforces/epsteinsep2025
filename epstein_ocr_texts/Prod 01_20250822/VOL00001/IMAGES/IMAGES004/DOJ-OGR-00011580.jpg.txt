1 distrust yourself. When a boundary is crossed or an

2 expectation violated, you tell yourself, "Someone who cares

3 about me to do all these nice things surely wouldn't also be

4 trying to harm me." This pattern of thinking is insidious, so
5) these seeds of self-doubt took root even as I learned my sister
6 had also been harmed by them and came to find out years later

7 that many others had been exploited.

8 THE COURT: Just a request to slow down.

9 MS. FARMER: For years these memories triggered

10 significant self-recrimination, minimization and guilt. I

11 blame myself for believing these predators actually wanted to
12 help me. I felt tremendous survivor guilt when I heard about
13 what other girls and young women had experienced at hands of

14 Maxwell and Epstein. I saw about how my sister's concern about
15 me weighed on her and felt guilty about this as well.

16 This toxic combination of being sexually exposed and
17 exploited, feeling confused and naive and blaming myself all

18 resulted in significant shame; that sickening feeling that

19 makes you want to disappear. It was not constant but would
20 come in waves, Similar to the waves that anxiety would also
2l show up. When I think back, I see a slide-show of moments when
22 these feelings would surface and overwhelm me. There are too
23 many of these moments to name and though I have come a long way
24 in my path of healing, I know that these feelings will continue
25 to be triggered at times.
