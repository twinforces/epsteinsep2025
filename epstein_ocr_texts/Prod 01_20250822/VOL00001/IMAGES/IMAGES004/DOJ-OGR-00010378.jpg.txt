a decade,” having both the “earlier phase” and the later “pyramid scheme.” Trial Tr. at 40; see
also, e.g., id. at 2886 (describing 2001 as “the beginning of the pyramid scheme of abuse”). But
a single conspiracy can enter “two or more phases or spheres of operation” without creating a
discontinuity in the underlying unlawful agreement, particularly if the same people are serving
the same roles in each phase. United States v. Pena, 846 F. App’x 49, 51 (2d Cir. 2021)
(summary order) (quoting United States v. Berger, 224 F.3d 107, 114-15 (2d Cir. 2000)); see
also United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d 934, 963 (2d Cir. 1990). Notably, the
Government, after distinguishing between earlier and later phases in the pattern of abuse,
immediately emphasized that “[flor a decade, the defendant played an essential role in this
scheme,” blurring any difference between the two phases. Trial Tr. at 41.

Moreover, though these phases did involve some differing means to acquire minor
victims, the differences presented at trial were not as great as the Government suggests in its
brief. As to both counts, both before and after 2001, the Government emphasized that massage
was a primary means by which the Defendant and Epstein normalized bodily contact and also the
means by which the Defendant and Epstein commonly instigated instances of sexual abuse.
Compare id. at 40 (“You will learn that in the 1990s, they used the cover of mentoring young
girls .. . to introduce massage . . . and that you will learn that they used these so called massages
as a way to sexually abuse the victims.”’), with id. at 41 (“Under this pyramid scheme of abuse,
the defendant could just call girls to schedule massage appointments and hand them cash
afterwards ....”); e.g., id. at 35 (“You will learn that the cover of massage was the primary way
the defendant and Epstein lured girls into sexual abuse.”’), 2852 (“Again and again throughout
this trial, you heard about how these girls were asked to perform sexualized massages on Jeffrey
Epstein.”).
