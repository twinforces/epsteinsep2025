based on, the purported similaritics between his personal historyandthe issucs at.trial. Because
these: arguments overlap, the Court addresses implied and inferred bias together.*

“Implied. bias” is “a concept that is reserved for ‘extreme situations,” warranting a
conclusive presumption of bias as a mattcrof law.” McCoy, 995 F.3d. at:48 (internal quotations
omitted) (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d.at'1.72). Such bias is “attributed ‘to a prospective juror
regardless of actual partiality” because'the law presumes that.“‘an average person in the:position
of the juror in controversy’would be prejudiced.” Zorres, 128 F.3d_at-45 (citing United. States Vv.
Wood, 299 U.S. 123, 133.(1936)); see-also Haynes, 398 F.2d at 984. The category applics to
“certain highly limited-situations where’ a juror discloses a fact that creates such a high risk of.
‘partiality. that the law requires the judge to éxcuse the juror for cause.” 7orres, 128 F.3d at 41.
Namely, “jurors who are:rclated to the parties or who were victims” or otherwise involved. in the
alleged crimevitself are impliedly biased. Jd. .at-453 see also Greer, 285 F.3d,at- 1,72.

On the other hand, a'finding of inferred bias. is a determination within:the trial Court’s
discretion. Greer, 285'F.3d.at. 171; see-also McCoy, 995 F.3d.at:49., “Bias may be inferred when
a juror discloses .a fact'that. bespeaks a risk of partiality sufficiently significant. to warrant
granting’the trial judge discretion to excuse the juror for causc,, but not so great as. to make
mandatory a. presumption of bias.” Greer, 285. F.3d at.171 (quoting Jorres, 128 F.3d at 47)).
The inquiry is whether the juror’s responses at voir dire “permit an inference. that the juror in
question would not be able to decide the:matter objectively:” Jorres, 128 F.3d at 47. Tfsuch.
facts are clicited, “then, just; as ‘in, the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or

her ability to be impartial beconic irrelevant.” Jd. However, “a judge may—particularly when.

° Tt isunsettled-in the. Second:Circuit whether implied.or inferred bias:may serve as'the basis fora post-trial
allegation of juror partiality: See Greer, 285 F:3d at 1.72. Because:the Court determines.that Juror 50 is neither
implicdly:nor. inferably biased, it need not resolve:this issue.
