correct? A. I testified that I thought I was around that age, yes. Q. And I think you said, when
asked to do the math, that it was approximately 1994; correct? A. Yes.”)

Second, the government’s theory of prejudice is bewildering. The government contends
that it was prejudiced by its own failure to investigate whether its witness was telling the truth.”
Gov. Letter at 6. Again, before her testimony, Kate had told the government two different stories
about where Ms. Maxwell lived in 1994—at a home in the Kensington neighborhood, or at the
Kinnerton Street home in the Belgravia neighborhood. The government chose not to investigate
where Ms. Maxwell actually lived in 1994 and which, if any, of Kate’s stories were true. That is
not Ms. Maxwell’s fault. And neither is it her duty to do the government’s work for it. The
government cannot seriously contend that an investigation into where Ms. Maxwell lived “did
not become necessary” until after Kate testified. Gov. Letter at 6.

The government complains about the difficulty of conducting investigations abroad. Gov.
Letter at 6 (“That is a time-consuming international, intergovernmental process involving
multiple agencies in each country that is not likely to generate admissible evidence by the
conclusion of trial.”). The government’s complaints are overwrought. For one thing, the
government had investigators in the United Kingdom investigating Ms. Maxwell’s college
record. There was nothing preventing these investigators from asking the most basic of
questions: When did Ms. Maxwell purchase the Kinnerton Street property?

? The government’s failure to investigate is not limited to Kate’s allegations. The veracity
of another accuser, Jane, is the subject of a post-testimony 3500 disclosure. ay
