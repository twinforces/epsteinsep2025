Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

I am counsel for Virginia Giuffre, and I am providing the following victim impact
statement for the Court’s consideration with respect to Maxwell’s sentencing.

Pursuant to the Crimes Victims’ Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771, Ms. Virginia Giuffre
qualifies as a victim as the Defendant participated in her trafficking from 2000 to 2002, and
testimony relating to that trafficking was presented as evidence during the trial in this case. Due
to a medical issue, Ms. Giuffre is unable to attend the sentencing in person and therefore
respectfully requests that the Court read her statement into the record or, alternatively, allow her
attorney representative Sigrid McCawley to read the statement on her behalf.

Statement by Virginia Giuffre:

Your honor, my name is Virginia Roberts Giuffre. For more than two years, from age 16
to 19, I was abused by Ghislaine Maxwell. Before I begin, I want to acknowledge and profusely
thank the police, FBI investigators, prosecutors and judges who have invested their time and
integrity in this case to hopefully set a precedent for victims and the hunters who prey upon them.

Now, if it pleases the court, I would like to address my victim impact statement directly to
Ghislaine Maxwell.

Ghislaine, twenty-two years ago, in the summer of 2000, you spotted me at the Mar-a-Lago
Hotel in Florida, and you made a choice. You chose to follow me and procure me for Jeffrey
Epstein. Just hours later, you and he abused me together for the first time. Together, you damaged
me physically, mentally, sexually, and emotionally. Together, you did unthinkable things that still
have a corrosive impact on me to this day.

I want to be clear about one thing: without question, Jeffrey Epstein was a terrible
pedophile. But I never would have met Jeffrey Epstein if not for you. For me, and for so many
others, you opened the door to hell. And then, Ghislaine, like a wolf in sheep’s clothing, you used
your femininity to betray us, and you led us all through it.
