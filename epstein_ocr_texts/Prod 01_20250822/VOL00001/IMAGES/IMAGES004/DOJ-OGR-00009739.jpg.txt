turned red, and.he grasped for words when. the Daily: Mail reporter told him about
Question 48. “Interesting,” Juror No. 50 said, struggling for an.cxplanation. Unable to
credibly explain.away his false answer, Juror No. 50,eventually put together a
nonsensical response: “No, No! I know my face is.red because I'can feel the blood but, T

he correctly skipped. follow-up questions ‘that he did. not need to answer.if he answered
“#10” to the initial. question. and provided written. explanations for some questions when.
called to do so. Ex. 1, p 1:7 (Question 34.a); p18 (Question, 37.a). Juror’No.'50 also
certificd, under, the penalty of perjury, that his answers were “true and.correct.” Ex: 1, p
27;

Third, itis simply not credible that Juror No. 50 would, not recognize and. then not

remember that the questionnaire asked if he was a victim of sexual assault, sexual abuse,
