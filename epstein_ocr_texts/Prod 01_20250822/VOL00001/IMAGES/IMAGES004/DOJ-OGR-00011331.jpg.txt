11/10/2021. Tr. at 169 (“I don’t.-think that’s going to‘happen with. witness three becausethat. sexual.
conduct:is not.=- you-don’t need 'to prove: that sexual conduct‘to, prove; an element.”),

Furthermore, the Court has correctly recognized that if the jury hears the details of the sex:
acts between, Epstein and Witness-3, there is a substantial risk that. the jury. “may.-confuse the:
issues. and think thatthe scxual conduct this witness. is describing itsclf constitutes the illegality
charged. in the Indictment duc to the closeness in age ofthis witness to. the age of consent” and as a
result.“may convict.Ms. Maxwell. duc to feelings of immorality or sympathy for'the witness,
despite the lack of:illegality with tegard to. the crimes charged in the Indictment.” 11/19/2021 Op.
and Order at 3.

The government now complains that the testimony of Witness-3 will. be misconstrued. by
the jury as a lack of'detailed recollection iftthe Court docs: not instruct:the:jury that she has been
instructed.not fo go into those details. That is the trade-off they. must live with if they:persist in
calling this ‘witness. Morcover; the government?s argument that the defense has somehow*put at
issuc all of the details of Witness-3’s scx acts with Epstein simply by questioning the accuracy of
the accusers’ memorics'is nonsense. The dates and specifics ofthe alleged abuse of other
misleading ‘as to the:testimony of Witness-3. It-is not.

The Court has already carcfully considered the limits of Witness-3’s testimony and. has
balanced the government’s use of this witness to establish.intent, motive, ctc.,.and the need to

protect Ms. Maxwell, from undueprejudice and a conviction based on,an improper premise. The
