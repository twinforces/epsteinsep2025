Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 692 Filed 11/22/21 Page9of17
States v. Giovinco, No. 18-CR-14 (JSR), 2020 WL 832920, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 2020)
(finding that depression did not impact the witness’s “ability to accurately perceive or recall”
relevant events); see also United States v. Cooper, No. 15-CR-152 (RMC), 2017 WL 11496709,
at *1 (D.D.C. Jan. 27, 2017) (excluding diagnosis of major depressive disorder).

period of... hallucinations”). Further, Dr. Hall several times commented that Alleged Victim
4’s memory was very accurate. F.g., id. at 85 (“No . . . alterations in memory, or changes in
orientation or level of attention.”’); 92 (“Her memory was impeccable and at multiple times
during the evaluation she pointed out to the examiner questions he did or didn’t ask. She reported
her memory is ‘perfect’ and that she will remember every detail of the room in which the
evaluation was done.” (emphases in original)). On review, the Court cannot identify any point in
