Finally, | remain in deepest gratitude to my attorneys Brad Edwards and Brittney Henderson,
without whom this trial may never have come about.

To them | would like to say:
Thank you for listening when no one else would.
Thank you for never giving up on fighting for what is right.
Special thanks to Brad Edwards, for showing me that good men exist and fight for what is right,
no matter the cost.
In becoming, a mother | have learned that forgiveness is important, but so are consequences.
