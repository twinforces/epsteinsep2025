serve as jurors in such cases, the defendant would have cited case law that actually supports that
proposition.

Finally, the defendant also argues that bias should be implied because she alleges that Juror
50 has repeatedly lied. (Def. Mem. at 35-36 (citing Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472)). As
discussed in greater detail above, the record does not support this, and, as a result, this is a far cry
from the extreme circumstances in Daugerdas, where Judge Pauley concluded after a hearing that
the juror “created a totally fictitious persona in her drive to get on the jury” and was “a pathological
liar who does not know the difference between truth and lie.” /d. at 473, 475.

The record also does not support the defendant’s attempt to compare Juror 50 to Juror 55,
7 As noted above, there is no evidence that Juror 50 LF
a. Moreover, the defendant’s analogy misunderstands the nature of the current inquiry, in
which the Court must consider the hypothetical question whether, if the juror had truthfully
answered the relevant question, the Court would have struck him for cause. See Stewart, 433 F.3d

In sum, the defendant has failed to establish implied bias.
