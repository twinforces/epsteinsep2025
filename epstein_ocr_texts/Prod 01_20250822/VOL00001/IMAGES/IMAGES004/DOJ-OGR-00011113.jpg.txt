described above. See Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 12 (Nov. 5, 2021). For example, in a recent murder
trial, the Court permitted the nephew of the victim to describe his uncle’s wounds because the
nephew, who had served as a caretaker, had some information that was not cumulative of the
medical records. The Court expressly cautioned the Government that it would not permit
emotional testimony, or the probative value would be outweighed by the prejudice:

[I]t's clearly a 403 line here. You have cumulativeness with the medical testimony, you

have graphic descriptions from a relative who cared for the victim which could very well

produce sympathies and prejudice that would interfere with and overcome the medical
facts that you need for purposes of proving causation. . . . | am certainly going to cut off
the line at any graphic descriptions. To the extent that walking this person through
questions regarding the medical condition is emotional testimony, I think we are — it will
have to be stopped.
United States v. Berry, No. 20 Cr. 84 (AJN), Dkt. No. 138 at 13; see also id. at 15. In that case,
the Government agreed that the line had to be carefully guarded. /d. at 13-14. The transcript of
that ruling is attached for counsel’s reference. See Exhibit A. The Court cautions the
Government to proceed carefully because the Court will not allow testimony that steps over this
403 line. The Court will allow some leading questions for this portion of the testimony to help
ensure that it does not.

Finally, the Court concludes that this witness’s anticipated testimony as to the sex
trafficking counts is inadmissible. Although the Government’s letter points to some relevant
direct evidence that this witness could provide regarding these counts, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 6-7,
any minimal probative value of this evidence is diminished by its remoteness in time to the
charged sex trafficking conspiracy, which is alleged to have run from 2001 to 2004. This
evidence does not face the same problem as it relates to the Mann Act conspiracies, which are
alleged to have begun in 1994 (and when the Defendant allegedly began her relationship with
this witness.). Because the risk of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the probative value of
