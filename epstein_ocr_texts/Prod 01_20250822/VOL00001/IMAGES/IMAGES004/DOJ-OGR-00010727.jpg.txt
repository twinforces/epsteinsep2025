Dear Judge Nathan:
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s June 25, 2022
Order directing the Government to respond to the application by Sarah Ransome and Elizabeth
Stein to speak at the defendant’s sentencing (Dkt. No. 675).
With respect to individuals who were not among the six individuals demonstrated at trial
to be directly and proximately harmed by the defendant’s criminal conduct, in a June 24, 2022
Order, the Court exercised its discretion to permit these other individuals to be heard at sentencing
through a written statement, and declined to permit these individuals to speak at the sentencing
hearing.
