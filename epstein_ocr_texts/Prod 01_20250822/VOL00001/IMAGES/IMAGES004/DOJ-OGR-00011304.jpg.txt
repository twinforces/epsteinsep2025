Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter regarding the proposed limiting
instructions in the Court’s order regarding Witness-3. (See Dkt. No. 477).

The Government proposes one edit to the instruction in advance of Witness-3’s testimony.
Specifically, the Government proposes inserting the word “solely” in the sentence beginning
“However,” as follows:

However, you may not convict the Defendant solely on the basis of the testimony

regarding the sexual conduct between this witness and Mr. Epstein.

This edit clarifies a potential tension within the instruction. As the Court has ruled,
evidence relating to Witness-3 is relevant to the issues, but cannot on its own support a conviction.
Absent this clarification, it may appear to the jurors that they “may not convict the Defendant on
the basis of [Witness-3]’s testimony,” i.e., the testimony is not offered as relevant evidence the
