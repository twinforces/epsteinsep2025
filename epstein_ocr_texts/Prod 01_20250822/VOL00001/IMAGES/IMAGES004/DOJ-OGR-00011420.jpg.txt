as early as the outset of the representation, while another lawyer may choose to inform
a Client only at a point when that client has imparted information that comes within
paragraph (b), or even choose not to inform a client until such time as the lawyer
attempts to counsel the client as contemplated in Comment [7]. In each situation, the
lawyer will have: satisfied the, lawyer's obligation under paragraph (c)(2), and will not be
subject to discipline.

relationship

[11] When.a lawyer has revealed information protected by Business and Professions
Codé sectidn 6068, subdivision (€):as permitted in paragraph (b), in all but extraordinary

the lawyer is required to. seek to ‘withdraw from the representation, unless the..client has
given. informed consent* to the lawyer's continued representation. The lawyer normally

compelling interest in not informing the client, such ‘as to protect the lawyer, the lawyer’s
family or a third person* from the: risk of death or substantial* bodily harm, the lawyer
must withdraw from the representation. (See rule 1.16.)
