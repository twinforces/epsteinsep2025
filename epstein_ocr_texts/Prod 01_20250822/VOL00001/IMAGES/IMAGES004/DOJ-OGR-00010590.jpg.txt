Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670- Filed 06/22/22 Page55o0f55
CONCLUSION
Ghislaine Maxwell sexually exploited young girls for years. It is difficult to overstate the
magnitude of her crimes and the harm she caused. Her crimes demand justice. The Government
urges the Court to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range of 360 to 660 monthsâ€™
imprisonment.
