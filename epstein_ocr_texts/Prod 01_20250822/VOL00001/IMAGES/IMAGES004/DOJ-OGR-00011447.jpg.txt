behind Ms. Maxwell’s back and under the nose of the presiding judge. This Court and Chief
Judge McMahon concluded that Ms. Maxwell could not have reasonably relied on the protective
order’s promise of confidentiality because the order was subject to modification and because of
the overriding interest in the “truth-seeking function of the judicial process.” June 25, 2021
Order, p 13, 17-18.

If that is true, then it’s equally true that Ms. Maxwell’s accusers cannot reasonably expect
their submissions to and communications with the EVCP to remain confidential for all time and
for all purposes. The EVCP Protocol expressly provides that its confidentiality guarantee is
“subject to law, regulation and judicial process.” And in view of the “truth-seeking function of
the judicial process” and Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights to present a defense and confront
her accuses, any remaining interest in confidentiality must give way.

CONCLUSION

Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena is narrow, specific, and targeted. It seeks only that evidence
which is relevant to her defense and admissible at trial. Although the concerns about
confidentiality are overblown, Ms. Maxwell nevertheless has asked that this Court review the
material in camera before turning it over to the defense. That in camera review would provide
another layer of protection, even as there is no reason to think that Ms. Maxwell is on a fishing
expedition.

Accordingly, and for the reasons given above, Ms. Maxwell requests that this Court deny
the motions to quash.
