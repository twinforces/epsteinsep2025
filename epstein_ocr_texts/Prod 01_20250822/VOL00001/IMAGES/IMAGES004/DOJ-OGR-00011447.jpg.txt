behind Ms. Maxwell’s back,and under the nose of the presiding judge. This. Court.and Chief
Judge McMahon coneluded that Ms. Maxwell could:not have reasonably relied on,the protective
‘the overriding interest. in the “truth-secking function of the judicial process.” June 25, 2021
Order, p 13,.1-7-18.

If that. is true, then. it’s cqually true that Ms. Maxwell’s accusers cannot reasonably expect
their submissions to and.communications with the EVCP*to remain confidential for all time and
forall. purposes. Lhe EVCP Protocol. expressly provides that its confidentiality guarantec is
“subject to law, regulation. and judicial-process.” And. in vicw' of the “truth-secking function of
the judicial, proécss” and Ms. Maxwell’s. constitutional rights to present a.defense and confront.

Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena is narrow; specific, and targeted. It secks only that evidence
which is relevant.to her defense and. admissible at trial. Although. the concerns about.
confidentiality are overblown, Ms. Maxwell nevertheless has asked that this Court, review the
material in camera before turning it over to the defense. That: in camera review would provide
another layer of protection, cven as there, is no‘reason,to think that Ms..Maxwell is on,a' fishing
expedition.

Accordingly, and for the reasons given, above, Ms. Maxwell requests that'this Court deny

‘the motions to quash.
