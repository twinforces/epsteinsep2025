that “[t]hcré is:no allegation that |__| is.a'victim of any improper of illegal conduit. by Mr.
Epstein or Ms. ’Maxwell” and offers no suggestion,that[ __] would face any particularized harm,
should, she: testify’ under her true name. (Def. Letter'at.8). She is no different from the several
Government witnesses: who were closely associated. with. Maxwell and Epstcinwho have already:
testified under their true names. There is accordingly no legal basis for[ __] to testify under a
pscudonym.

Eor Michelle: Healy, the defendant claims that she is'the same Michelle who, on cross-
examination, Jane recalled participating’ in, ‘sexualized massages with her and Epstein after Jane:
reached the age of consent aid moved. to. New York.” On. this'theory, which the Government’
disputes, the defendant claims ‘Healy is a. victim-witness entitled to the same solicitude as the
victims who, testified in the ;Government’s, case-in-chief. (Def. Letter at 7-8). The defendant’s
position is‘misplaced.. First, the defendant has not established that Healy is the same Michellc'that.
Jane referenced in her testimony. Indeed, the Government anticipates filing a.scparate motion to
‘preclude Healy’s testimony in part. because there is an insufficient basis to find. ’that: Healy’s
testimony-would in fact contradict.Jane’s.

Sceond, and-relatedly, it appears based onthe: defendant’s Rule 26.2 disclosures that Healy:
willtestify that she was not a'victim of Epstein, and ‘the, defendant. (Prestimably, if she. were, the

examination ‘thatwa. “Michelle” participated j in. those massages, not that Michelle Healy did SO.
Defense counsel ‘chose not. to ask. for a last name: or otherwise: attempt to identify to which.
“Michelle” she was referring.
