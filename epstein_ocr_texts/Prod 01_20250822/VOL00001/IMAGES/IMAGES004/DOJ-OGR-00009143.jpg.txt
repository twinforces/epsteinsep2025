that must be followed,” but a standard question, approved by the Second Circuit, is: “If you are
selected to sit on this case, will you be able to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented at
the trial and in the context of the law as I will give it to you in my instructions, disregarding any
other ideas, notions, or beliefs about the law that you may have encountered in reaching your
verdict?” Id. at 43-44.

With respect to Juror 50, the defendant has presented no evidence to support a claim of
actual bias. In a public interview, Juror 50 stated that he “went into the trial firmly believing that
Maxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the victims with a skeptical eye” and that
his own experience of sexual abuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent until
proven guilty.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 2, 8). These statements are corroborated by the apparent care with
which the jury approached its deliberations—asking for testimony and other evidence in numerous
questions submitted over the course of multiple days of deliberations—and by its return of a split
verdict, in which it acquitted the defendant on one count. See United States v. Aiello, 771 F.2d
621, 631 (2d Cir. 1985) (citing apparent care with which jury approached deliberations and split
verdict as evidence of impartiality); Greer, 285 F.3d at 174 (citing split verdict as evidence of
impartiality). And Juror 50’s public statements are further corroborated by his answers during voir
dire, during which he unequivocally stated that he would be able to follow the law as instructed
by the Court, that he would decide the case based on the facts and evidence, or lack of evidence,
presented in court, and that, other than what he had been asked, there was no reason to think he
could not be fair and impartial. See Nov. 16, 2021 Tr. at 128, 130, 134.

While the defendant has not argued for a finding of actual bias (Def. Mem. at 38-39), she
at times alludes to the argument. For example, the defendant makes much of the fact that Juror 50
called the defendant a “predator,” said the verdict was for “all the victims,” and commented on a
