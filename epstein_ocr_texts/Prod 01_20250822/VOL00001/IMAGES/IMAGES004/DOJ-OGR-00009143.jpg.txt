that ‘must ‘be followed,” but.a standard question, approved by the Second Circuit, is: “If you are
selected to:sit'on this case, will you be able'to render a verdict solely on the evidence presented. at:
the trial and ‘in. the context.of the law as I will give it to you in. my instructions, disregarding, any
other ‘ideas, notions, or, beliefs about the law that you ‘may ‘have encountered in reaching your:
verdict?” Jd. at'43-44.

With respect to: Juror 50, the defendant has presented no evidence to.support:a claim of
actual. bias. Ina public: interview, Juror 50 stated that he “went ‘into the trial firmly believing’ that:
Maxwell was “innocent until proven guilty’ and:viewing the victims with.a skeptical cye” and-that
his own experience of sexual abuse “did not affect his ability to view Maxwell as innocent ‘until.
proven guilty.” (Gov’t Ex. B at 2,8). These statements are corroborated by the apparent care with
which the jury approached its deliberations—asking for testimony-and other evidence in.numerous
questions submitted over'the: course: of multiple days of deliberations—and by its return, of. a split:
verdict, if, Which it acquitted the deferidant of.one count. See United Statés \. Aiéll6, 771. F.2d.
621, 631 (2d Cir. 1985) (citing apparent care with;which,jury approached deliberations and split
verdict as evidence of impartiality); Greer, 285 F.3d at. 174 (citing split verdict. as, cvidence of
impartiality). And Juror 50’s public statements-are-further corroborated by his answers during voir
dire, during which, he unequivocally: stated that he would. be able to follow the law as instructed.
by the Court, that he: would decide the case based on the ‘facts and. evidence, or lack of evidence,
presented in.court, and. that, other than what. he: had. been asked, there ‘was no reason to think he
could not be fair and,impartial. See Nov.16, 202.1 Tr.'at 128, 130, 134.

While the defendant.has not argued for a ‘finding of actual bias (Def. Mem. at' 38-39), she

called the defendant-a “predator,” said the verdict: was for “all the victims,” and commented ona.
