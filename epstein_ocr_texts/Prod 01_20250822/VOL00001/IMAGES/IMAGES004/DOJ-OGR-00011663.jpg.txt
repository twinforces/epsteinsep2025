1 Protection Act and 615. Why don't you both look at it, confer,
2 see if you can come to agreement, and if not, put ina letter.
3 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.

4 THE COURT: Thank you.

a) MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, one other issue on

6 sequestration. I was hoping to be able to provide a copy of

7 Dr. Rocchio's testimony to either Dr. Dietz or Dr. Loftus,

8 because I anticipate there may be issues that come up that they
9 need to address during their testimony. And so for that

10 purpose I would ask for a limited exclusion from Rule 615 for
11 those witnesses.

12 MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine with the government, your
13 Honor.

14 THE COURT: Thank you. This is why I asked. Make

15 sure we're on the same page.

16 Anything else in that regard?

17 MS. COMEY: Not from the government, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: When may I have an order-of-witness list?
19 MS. COMEY: We would propose by Saturday, your Honor?
20 THE COURT: OK. And, as I always do, I ask at the
21 final pretrial conference if any plea offers were communicated
22 to the defense.
23 MS. COMEY: None were communicated, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: And Ms. Sternheim, that's accurate; none
25 were communicated?
