staff conduct flashlight checks every 30 minutes for inmates housed in the Special Housing Unit
and conduct flashlight checks of inmates in the general population multiple times each night at
irregular intervals, but at an average of at least once per hour.

The defendant’s repeated claims about jail food and her weight should be rejected out of
hand as a basis for a downward variance. Legal counsel for the MDC has informed the
Government that when the defendant was housed outside of the general population, her meals
arrived in containers that were both microwavable and oven safe, and her meals were heated in a
thermal oven as of at least April 6, 2021. As the Government previously informed the Court in
response to the defendant’s complaints about her weight, during her time at the MDC, the
defendant’s weight has fluctuated between the 130s and the 140s. Medical records reflect that the
defendant weighed 146 pounds when she was arrested, and she weighed 144.5 pounds when she
was last weighed in April 2022. In short, the defendant’s claims of extreme weight loss are not
true.

At bottom, the defendant’s complaints about jail seem to come down to the vast gulf
between the conditions of her confinement and the defendant’s lived experience up until her arrest
and detention on July 2, 2020. Until July 2020, the defendant spent her entire life living in
extraordinary luxury. Her childhood and adolescence were filled with wealth and privilege. That
access to wealth continued into adulthood when the defendant found a benefactor in Epstein, who
provided her with millions of dollars and invited her to share in his luxurious lifestyle of mansions,
house staff, private chefs, and private planes. After leaving that relationship, the defendant
remained exceptionally wealthy, residing in palatial estates and owning multiple homes. It is no
wonder, then, that she found jail jarring. Going from being waited on hand and foot to
incarceration is undoubtedly a shocking and unpleasant experience. The massive difference
