Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document675 Filed 06/25/22 Page 6of21

Against; this backdrop, Sarah and Elizabeth, are categorial, “victims” who'should be allowed to
speak at sentencing, Sexual abusers frequently: use their. actual. or perceived. power. to .manipulate and.
coerce victims’ during their abuse or trafficking, Jill. Laurie: Goodman &:Dorchen.A. Leidholdt,
Lawyer's Manual on. Human Trafficking, NY State Jud. Comm. ‘on Women in the Court. 169-76
(2013). The:scheme Sarah, and Elizabeth both describe in their victim impact statements is the: same
scheme Maxwell is: being-sentenced for and it involves;the same defendant and co-conspirators as the
conspiratorial scheme proven at trial.

Moreover, these'victim statements reflect Sarah’s and Elizabeth's personal knowledge of
Maxwell's character'and actions in furtherance of the scheme. Maxwell's argument that Sarah and
Elizabeth do not qualify as real victims because they-were ‘not minors at. the time of the trafficking
‘and. therefore are ‘not victims within the counts of conviction is of no moment, The allegations in the:
second superseding indictment easily encompasses: these: non=minor’victims. For.example, in
paragraph 4(e) of the.second. superseding indictment, which. is a sub-part.of a count.for. which there.
was a.conviction, alleges that “through this! process, Maxwell and Epstein enticed victims to engage
‘in. sexual. activity with Epstein.” Likewise, paragraph 9 of the second superseding indictment alleges
that “among the victims indticed. or enticéd by GHISLAINE MAXWELL, the defendant, weie.
minor victims identified heréin,as' Minor Victim—1, Minor Vietim—2, Minor Victim—3 and Minor
Victim=4.” A fair reading of the indictment is that although it emphasizes minor victims, the sex

trafficking conspiracy—as alleged—encompassed non-minor victims like Sarah and, Elizabeth.
