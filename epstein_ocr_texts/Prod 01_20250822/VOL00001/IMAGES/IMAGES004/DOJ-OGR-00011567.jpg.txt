Having resolved the 'parties" objections, I will
calculate the Guideline range, As explained, I will use the
2003 Guidelines manual. Following Séction, 2G1.1(da)(1), each
victim is considered a separate count of conviction, In
addition to the threé victims, for which an, offense level was

calculated in the PSR -- Jane, Annie, and Carolyn -- I

tetal of 5 groups.

For all groups, the bdse offense level 15 19. That's

Sections 2G61.1(a) and 2X1,1(a).

For Jane and Cardélyn, bécause they were oldér than 12

but were not yet 16 when abuse began, the offense Level is
enhanced by 2, 2G1.1(6) (2) (B).

The offense level for Jane and, Carolyn is further

enhanced by 2 because, they were unduly influenced into a

commercial sex act. 2G1.1(b) (4) (B).

For Anhie, Virginia, ahd Melissa, whd were at least

16, the offense level is increased by 2 because they ‘were

unduly influenced into a commercial act. 261.1. (b) (4) (B).

The offense level for all groups are also. enhanced, by’
4 points because 6f the supervisory role in an extensive

eriminal activity. 3Bl.1/(a).

Carnolyn's groups to 27. And Annie's, Virginia's and Melissa's
