also decline to hold. as a general ‘matter that, where a juror has

engaged in. conduct similar to that. of the defendant.at; trial, the trial

“extreme situations” that:call for mandatory removal.
lorres, 128 F.3d.at,46; see also id, at-46:&.n.11 (rejecting Al/sup decision from Ninth, Circuit;that.
court must.presume that jurors who had “particular . . . prior experiences ‘were biased”). Thus, to
the extent the:cases cited by the defendant: purport:to require such.a presumption of bias, they are
inconsistent: with, binding Second, Circuit ‘preeedent.. (See, e.g:, Def. Mem. at:3:1 (citing Unifed
States ¥. Eubanks, S91, F.2d'513, 5.1.7 (9th Cir. 1979), which relied. on A//sip)).

The remaining cases cited by the defendant are inapposite. Some mercly state a general,
proposition that similarity‘of experiences may. give'rise to.a’presumption of bias, but:then go.on to
resolve the case on other grounds. See, ¢.g.,, Skaggs v. Otis Elevator Co., 164 F.3d S11, 517-18
(10th Cir. 1998); ‘United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F.Supp. 24.445, 472 (S.D.N.Y..2012), vacated
by United States v.. Parsés 789 F.3d 83.(2d Gir. 2015). ‘Others find:that: a juror should, have been
struck not:merely because of similarity of experiences, but also based on.a number of other factors
not ‘present here. For example, in one case: prominently cited ‘by the defendant, a juror ‘in, ‘the:
penalty phase ofa death penalty case. told a “litany of lies,” and ‘the, First Circuit declined to rest
its decision, on any’ particular ‘category of bias, but instead cited the combination, of the juror’s
interpersonal relationships, inability to scparate cmotion from duty, similarity of expericnces,
scope and severity: of dishonesty, and motive for lying, any one of which “taken in isolation, may
be insufficient to ground a finding of a valid basis for.a,challenge for cause.” Sampson v. United
States, 724 F.3d 150, 161 :166-68 (Ist Cir: 2013); see also Hinley vy. Godinez, 975 F.2d 316, 3.19-
20 (7th Cir. 1992) (citing combination of factors in “extreme” case where: two jurors were
burglarized during deliberations and. then changed. their votes as a.result, and. stating that “our
