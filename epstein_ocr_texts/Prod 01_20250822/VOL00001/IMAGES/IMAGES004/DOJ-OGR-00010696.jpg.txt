a deferred prosecution agreement)) “Congress crafted the CVRA to recognize the harm and
anguish suffered by victims of crime. This is why Congress made the statutory rights under the
CVRA permissively accessible. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(d)(3).” Id. Moreover, “[b]ecause victim status can
be argued for even prior to the filing of an indictment, it is clear that Congress intended courts to
look beyond the four corners of an indictment or plea agreement. For example, in the context of the
[drug trafficking] conspiracy here, neither the indictment nor the statement of facts included in the
plea agreement mention violence of any kind. And yet, logic allows for the inference...that [the
defendant’s] paramilitary organization...employed violence and force as part of its method of
operation.” Jd.

It is also important to understand that this case has now moved to a different phase than the
trial phase where, of course, a defendant is entitled to a presumption of innocence and is protected
by the requirement that the government prove guilt by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But, in
determining the “crime victim” issue at sentencing, the relevant standard of proof is the conventional
standard for proceedings in criminal cases outside of trial—preponderance of the evidence. See
United States v. Giraldo-Serna, 118 FSupp.3d 377, 382 (D.D.C. 2015) (“Purported victims under
the CVRA must prove their victim status by a preponderance of the evidence.”) (citing Jn re
McNulty, 597 F.3d 344, 351 (6th Cir. 2010); United States v. Atl. States Cast Iron Pipe Co., 612
FSupp.2d 453, 486, 495, 508 (D.N.J. 2009)); see also United States v. Gushlak, 728 F.3d 184, 195
(2d Cir. 2013) (applying preponderance of the evidence standard to victim restitution issue); United
States v. Kim, 988 F.3d 803, 809 (5th Cir. 2021)(same).
