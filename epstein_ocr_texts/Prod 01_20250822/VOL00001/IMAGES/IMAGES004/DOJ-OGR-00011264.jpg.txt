Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 706 Filed 07/12/22 Page12of12

The Government. has. no. objection to fact’ testimony from Lopez about the admitted
exhibits. On December 13, however, defense counsel informed the Goyernment that they’ may
reccive and. produce financial records about which, they. would ask John Lopez to testify... Such
records have:not been-produced to: the Government as of the:time of this: Ictter. The Court should
Lopez’s testimony. The account statements showing the financial transactions that the Government.
proved at trial were all. produced. to'the defense: more than.a year before trial. Production. of new
exhibits. at'this late date would violate;Rule. 1.6 and would. likely prejudice the Government.
