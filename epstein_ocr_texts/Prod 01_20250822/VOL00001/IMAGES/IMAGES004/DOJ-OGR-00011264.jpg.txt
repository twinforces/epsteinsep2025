Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 706 Filed 07/12/22 Page12of12
The Government has no objection to fact testimony from Lopez about the admitted
exhibits. On December 13, however, defense counsel informed the Government that they may
receive and produce financial records about which they would ask John Lopez to testify. Such
records have not been produced to the Government as of the time of this letter. The Court should
not permit the defense to produce and introduce additional financial records between now and
Lopez’s testimony. The account statements showing the financial transactions that the Government
proved at trial were all produced to the defense more than a year before trial. Production of new
exhibits at this late date would violate Rule 16 and would likely prejudice the Government.
VI. Conclusion
For the reasons set forth above, the Court should deny the defendant’s motion.
Respectfully submitted,
DAMIAN WILLIAMS
