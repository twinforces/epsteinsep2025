Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

I am writing on behalf of witness Jane in regard to Ms. Maxwell's recent filing regarding
her attorney Robert Glassman who represented her in her civil case against the Epstein Estate
and Ms. Maxwell that settled over a year ago.

Ms. Maxwell raises three areas that she wants to solicit testimony from Mr. Glassman.

1. The "Help her case" email

Jane stands on the opposition she submitted on December 6, 2021 and the Government's
opposition regarding that email.

2. The Lion King email

As the Government points out, Jane was extensively cross-examined on this issue. Mr.
Glassman would have nothing to add, and anything he could say would require him to disclose
confidential information in violation of California Rule of Professional Conduct 1.6.
