i THE COURT: Mr. Schectman?

2 MR. SCHECTMAN: Yes, your Honor.

a CROSS-EXAMINATION

4 BY MR. SCHECTMAN:

5 QO. Ms. Edelstein, on May 12th at the end of the conversation

6 that you had on the plaza with Ms. Brune and Ms. Trzaskoma, why

7 didn't you bring information about there being a suspended

8 lawyer with the same name as Juror No. 1, why didn't you bring

9 that to the Court's attention?

10 A. At some point during the conversation we had discussed

11 whether we should bring it to the Court's attention, but after
LA we discussed the issue and concluded that it was inconceivable
13 that Juror No. 1 was the suspended lawyer, we didn't see a

14 reason to bring the fact that there was a suspended lawyer with
15 the name Catherine Conrad to the Court's attention, that there
16 was nothing we were going to ask the Court ta do at that point.
Lh QO. At any time were you trying to sandbag the Court or tamper
18 with the record?

LS A. No.
20 Q. At any time between the juror's verdict on May 24th and the
21 receipt of Ms. Conrad's post-trial letter on June 30, was there
22 any discussion in the Brune firm about raising a juror
23 misconduct issue as an issue on a post-trial motion?
24 A. There was none.
25 9. And why not?
