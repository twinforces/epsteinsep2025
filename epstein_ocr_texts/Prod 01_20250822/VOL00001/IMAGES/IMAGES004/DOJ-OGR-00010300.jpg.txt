Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 648 Filed 03/15/22 Page 10of16

was being considered for as a. juror when he went into jury:selection and only learned after sitting
in. thé courtroom for three Hours. (Vd. at. 13:20-2:1, 17:20-22). He further explained, that he
“honestly never thought [he] would.be chosen to:sit on:this jury” because of the “sheer volume of
people” present for jury selection; he thought “surely they will ‘be, interviewing thousands. of
people. And they ultimately choose. twelve people to sit on.a jury, and I never'thought I would be
‘one of'those twelve.” (Id. at 12:3-4, 13:18-25).

The hearing held by this Court. made clear that Juror 50 did not deliberately. lic or cngage
‘in deccit in.complcting the: questionnaire. Juror 50:made.an “honest mistake.” (/d.. at 23:5). The:
defendant’s motion fails at the first prong of the McDonough test.

B. The Record. Does Not Siipport a Finding that the Court Would Have
Granted. a.Hypothetical for Cause Challenge

The hearing established.that Juror 50 harbored:no bias, approached. his jury service’with an
open mind, and was committed to deciding the casé based on the évidence and, the Court’s legal
instructions. If Juror 50 had accurately answered. the questions relating, to sexual abuse in. the
questionnaire, the Court. would, have asked Juror 50. follow up questions during voir dire to
determine. if it would have granted.a challenge. for catisc. The Court asked those. questions at the
hearing, and. Juror 50’s'sworn responses made clear that he was a fair and impartial juror-who did.
not.harbor any’ bias:and who would not have been excused for cause. Because the defendant cannot:

establish:that Juror.50 was biased, she is: not ‘entitled:to the extraordinary:relicf she secks.

prospective juror would agree that, if-required to serve’ on a.jury, they would rather ‘do-so on. an,
interesting case, and surely. many: prospective jurors ‘would find this case more interesting than ‘a.
contract’ dispute or the like. But.as Juror 50 made clear repeatedly, including twice in. that same:
colloquy, he “did:not sct out in order to get on this jury.” (/d. at 14:4-S).. Were he attempting: to
lic or mislead. the Court, he surely would have omitted.that comment and left his answer.at “I did.
not hope to be on this jury.” (/d. at.14:2). ‘Instead, he gave as complete an answer as he could,
demonstrating'his candor at the hcaring—including’ ‘his candor that he made no effort to’be selected,
as a juror.
