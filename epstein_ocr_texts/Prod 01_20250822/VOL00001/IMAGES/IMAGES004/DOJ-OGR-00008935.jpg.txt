Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document600_ Filed 02/11/22 Page11 of 37

MR. ROHRBACH: Annie only relates to the conspiracy counts, at least as to

these Mann Act charges, and the jury is going to be instructed here that the

relevant illegal sexual activity has to be the violation of the New York offense. So

again, there’s no risk that the jury will think that the sexual contact that happened

in New Mexico is something that on its own is sufficient to show the illegal

sexual activity required by the statute.
Tr. 2775:2-9. With regard to Jane’s testimony, the government reiterated the same point:

MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, these instructions do not put before the jury any

violation of any New Mexico offense whatsoever above or below the age of

consent, so I think there’s no risk that the jury is going to convict the defendant

based on their concerns about a violation of a New York offense.
Tr. 2776:5-10. The Court agreed with the government and declined to include the requested
instructions. Tr. 2777:12-25.

ps The Jury Note

During their deliberations, the jury sent a note inquiring about the proper basis to convict
under Count Four of the Indictment (the substantive transportation count) (the “Jury Note” or the
Note”). The Jury Note read as follows:

Under Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s return

flight, but not the flight to New Mexico where/if the intent was for Jane to engage

in sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second element?
Court Exhibit #15 (Dkt. 593 at 23). The defense argued that the Note indicated that the jury was
already contemplating convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s testimony about
sexual abuse in New Mexico, which was not a violation of New York law, and that their question
focused on whether Ms. Maxwell’s help planning Jane’s return flight from New Mexico,
assuming they found she gave any, was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count Four.
Tr. 3128:6-3140:18. The Court disagreed and did not offer any clarifying instructions, and
simply referred the jury to the charge for the second element of Count Four. Tr. 3140:20-3141:3.
