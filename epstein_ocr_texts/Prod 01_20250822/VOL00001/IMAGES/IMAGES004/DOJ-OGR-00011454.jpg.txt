2020, the U.S. Virgin. Islands probate court. approved the:EVCP as designed. '* On.June 25,
2020, the EVCP announced that individuals could begin the’process of filing claims."

In. her motion, sécking approval, for ‘the subpoena, Maxwell makes, at least two
mischaracterizations of the Protocol for evaluating a claimant’s cligibility for compensation.
First, she says that the Protocol “credits” victims “who have had charges filed against.Epstein or
any employee of Epstein.”'® The Protocol does no such thing. ‘It simply identifies the existence
of any information or findings of law enforcement.as one factor to be considered, as part of a
non-exhaustive list of “appropriate factors and corroborative support” that the administrator ‘may’
consider in evaluating claims."’ ‘Maxwell also mischaracterizes the Protocol when she says that
it “rewards Accusers who have: filed.a lawsuit, legal action. or:claim, of sexual abuse.’””"* ‘This is
inaccurate. .As the Protocol niakes clear, the existence. of “lawsuit[s], legal. action[s].or claim[s]”
was used.to' identify individuals as potential victims to send them claim.forms." ‘Individuals
who.had not:previously filed a lawsuit, legal action, or claim’were also invited to, register:a, claim
with the EVCP.”°

example, the’ EVCP operates “entirely free from any interference or control, by the Epstein
