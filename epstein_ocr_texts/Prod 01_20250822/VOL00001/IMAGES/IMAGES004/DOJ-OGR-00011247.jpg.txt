of the same entry, produced in the criminal discovery and attached as exhibit B, is obviously, and
noticeably, different. The remaining six pages are identical except for the identifying bate ranges.
Examination of the original document would answer legitimate questions about whether the
document has been manipulated, altered, or fabricated. Disclosure of the document in advance of
trial would prevent the unnecessary delay of having a qualified forensic document examiner take
possession of the document, run tests, and offer an opinion during the middle of trial.

Request 10, the Boots

The Court directed the government “‘to notify the Court of its views” regarding item 10.
Instead of notifying the Court of its “views” the government, however, has taken steps to
circumvent the pending defense subpoena request; it is “working to moot request 10” by having
the FBI secure the boots, Dkt. 269, p.2. This is an interference with Ms. Maxwell's ability to
investigate her defense without interference from the government. Ms. Maxwell's original
request was ex parte, now the government is taking possession of the very things subject to Ms.
Maxwell's subpoena. The government’s actions demonstrate a willingness to take control of
evidence when it is tactically advantageous to do so but resist disclosure when it is not. Ms.
Maxwell requests that the court order production of the boots to her lawyers pursuant to the
subpoena, not to the government.

Request 11, the Photographs

Regarding item 11, the photographs, the government offers inconsistent and illogical
positions. In its letter of May 4, 2021, the government first advised the Court that it obtained
“copies of the complete set of requested photographs” which it then produced to the defense.
Two days later it admitted that “some of the original photographs are currently in the Prosecution
Team’s possession” and that it would “make them available to the defendant upon request.”
