Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Counsel:

The Government expects to offer testimony from Computer Forensic Examiner Stephen
Flatley of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (“FBI”) Computer Analysis Response Team
(“CART”). As noted in the Government’s September 15, 2021 letter, although the Government
believes that Examiner Flatley’s testimony will not require admission through Rule 702 of the
Federal Rules of Evidence, the Government provided expert notice. In an abundance of caution,
the Government is providing additional description of Examiner Flatley’s anticipated testimony.

The Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will testify regarding the forensic
examination of the devices marked for identification as Government Exhibits 54 and 55, and his
determination that those exhibits are clones. He is expected to testify that a clone is an exact copy
of one piece of media to another. Examiner Flatley is expected to explain that he connected
Government Exhibits 54 and 55 to a write blocker and subsequently imaged, or made an exact
copy, of the exhibits. The Government anticipates that Examiner Flatley will explain that the
images of Government Exhibits 54 and 55 are exact copies of the original devices because he ran
a hash, or mathematical algorithm that uniquely identifies data, on the original devices and the
images, which are identical.
