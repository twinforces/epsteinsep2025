2080-84 (shopping with Annie in’New Mexico and teaching her to massage Epstein’s feet), 840-
45 (recruiting. Virginia and, instructing Alessi 'to bring her to Epstéin’s Florida house), 1524
(Virginia. receiving money for sex with Epstein), 1'534 (inviting Carolyn to travel)). The jury
evidently credited’ this testimony, and, based, on that testimony and the reasonable: inferences: from,
it, a rational jury‘casily could have (and did) find her guilty on Count One.

The defendant: has made no substantive argument as to the sufficiency of the evidence on,
‘the ‘remaining counts, and for good. reason. Just.as the conspiracies ‘in Counts :One and Three are

Count Four, the record contains evidence that the defendant made travel arrangements for Jane,
including the specific incident.in. which Jane: had. difficulty returning .from New Y:ork to Palm.
Beach, and,that the defendant'traveled with Jane on Epstcin’s private plane. (Tr. 2268-693 see Tr.
316-17 (testimony that the defendant traveled.with Jane on Epstcin’s private jct and would “assist”
in “making travel arrangements”); Tr. 323-24 (“[S]ometimes it would be — Jeffrey would.ask her,
hey, can'you getJane, you.know, tickets and the times and’whatnot and make the arrangements to
be picked.up.”).. That, in combination with evidence of the: defendant’s participation. ‘in. Jane’s
abuse in New York, is sufficient on its own for the jury to convict,on Count Four. See United
States ¥. Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 336, (2d Cir, 2013) (“The record is replete with evidence from
which a reasonable:jury could. infer that sexual access. to Jaire was.a dominant purpose of Vargas-
Cordon’s repeated transport of her from, his New Jersey home: into Brooklyn.”); United States. v.
