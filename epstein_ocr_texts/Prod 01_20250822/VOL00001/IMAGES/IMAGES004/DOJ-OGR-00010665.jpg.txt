themselves. When a, boundary is crossed or an expectation violated, ‘you-tell yourself, “Someone
who:cares enough, about me to do all'these, niece things. surely wouldn’t also’be trying to harm me.”
This ‘pattern of thinking 1s insidious, so these seeds of self-doubt took root even as | learned. my’
sister, had. also been harmed. by’ them, and came to find out: years later that many others had been.
exploited. ‘For years these::memories triggered. significant ‘self-recrimination, minimization and.
guilt. I blamed:myself for believing these predators actually wanted to help me. I felt tremendous
‘survivor guilt when, I’ heard, what; other girls and, young. women, had. experienced, at the hands of
Maxwell and Epstcin. 1 saw: how: my’sister’s concern :about:me weighed.on her.and felt-guilty ‘about.
this’ aswell.

This toxic. combination of being sexually’ exposed. and exploited, feeling confused and.
naive, blaming ‘myself all resulted in, significant shame. ‘That. sickening, fecling that, makes you.
‘want to disappear. It'was not constant, but would come in waves, similar to the waves of anxiety’
that would.also show up. Wher I think back; I sce a slideshow of moments when these feclings
would:surface and:overwhelm me. remember sitting at my desk in a-Houston hospital physically
shaking after sccing, the photo of Maxwell with. Virginia Giuffre and. Prince “Andrew because at
became clear to me how their scheme had. continued; the time an unexpected security’ screening
from a TSA. agent who patted down my chest with the back of her hand, left me crying and,
disorientéd, at‘the airport; a 40th. birthday gathering where I’broke down erying telling: the story to
some ‘friends for the ‘first time. There are too many of these moments to, name, and though I have
come a.long way:in my path. of healing, | know that these: feelings will continue to be triggered at
times.

The'ripple effects of trauma, are undeniable, when one person. is abused, ‘many: others are
harmed. In addition to the way. 1 was impactéd as an. individual, there: was the pain I experienced,
‘as a sister. duc to. how: Maria was abused by: Maxwell and.Epstcin, and the harm caused to the rest
of my: family duc to these events. My sister’s abusc—the sexual assault, Maxwell’s threats that
stole her sense-of safety. and.her career, theway.they‘used her to get.to’ me—had devastating effects
on her and. as. my family watched her grow more ‘isolated, and ‘more physically ill, from, the, stress.
ofall of it; we all felt powerless. It'was heartbreaking and, infuriating, atid we later learned. how
often-this pattern was repeated..A young person.on.the path of pursuing her dreams ‘was: pulled ‘in.
by Maxwell, was abused and. exploited, and.then-had to try to piece: together a lifc:in the aftermath.
‘of this trauma-that: left'them, feeling’ distrustful, and fearful., Most.of these individuals had families
who were also negatively impacted. as they-witnessed and, felt the systemic effects of their loved.
one’s losses, and struggles. The number of people harmed is impossible to measure.

Maxwell-had many opportunitics:to come:clean, but instead continucd:to make:choices'that.
‘caused. more harm. When my’ sister and J first: spoke out:to the media about what happened to: us,
Maxwell. lied about us and threatencd.Maria, thus helping shut down investigations into Epstcin’s
behavior so, they could. together continuc to harm, children and. young ‘women. After this attempt
to alert people to Epstein and Maxwell’s abusive behavior, | avoided being public about it for
almost. two: decades. My shame told. me that I should. hide this fact because it was embarrassing.
Later, as.I pursued. my profession as a psychologist, I. feared it could.potentially ruin. my career. |
worried clients would, not want,to work withme‘if I was associated with this story wrongly labeled.
‘as one of “child prostitution.” I) feared being on. Epstcin. ‘and Maxwell’s..radar because: of their
‘previous liés and threats.
