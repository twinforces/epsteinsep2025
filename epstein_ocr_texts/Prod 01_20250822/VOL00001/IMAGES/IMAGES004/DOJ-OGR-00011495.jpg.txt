Alternatively, if you do not have access to the Program’s Online Claimant
Portal, you can mail your completed Claim Form and all supporting
information and documentation via overnight courier to the address above.

5. What types of information and documentation should I submit to support my
claim?
You should provide as much corroborating information and documentation as
possible regarding the nature, frequency, location, and timeframe of the
abuse, and the impact of the abuse on your life, in order to support your claim.
This includes, but is not limited to, the following types of information or
documents:

a. Contemporaneous written notification or other correspondence (e.g.
letters, emails) of the abuse made by the Claimant to friends, family,
law enforcement authorities, and/or others;

b. Medical or psychiatric counseling/therapy records relevant to the
abuse;

c. Any information, documents or pertinent findings offered by any law
enforcement agencies.

A personal statement describing in narrative form the circumstances of the
abuse and the impact it has had on your life is strongly recommended and
helpful in evaluating your claim.

6. How will I know if my claim is missing information or documentation?
If you submit an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will contact
you or your legal representative (if you are represented), identify the missing
information or documentation, and assist you in completing the submission or
curing any deficiency.

7. Will I have an opportunity to supplement my claim?
Yes. If you submit an incomplete or deficient claim, the Administrator will
contact you or your legal representative (if you are represented), identify the
missing information, and assist you in completing the submission or curing
any deficiency. The Administrator may also contact you or your legal
representative to request additional information and/or documentation to
supplement the claim. You will be afforded an opportunity to cure any
deficiency and supplement your claim before the Administrator’s final
disposition of your claim.
