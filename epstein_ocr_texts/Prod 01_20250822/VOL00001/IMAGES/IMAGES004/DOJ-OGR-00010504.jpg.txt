person. She cares about others. Ghislaineâ€™s first reaction on hearing of a problem is how to
solve it or how to contribute to a solution. Her desire is always to engage, to bring energy to
every problem and to help. Her care and thoughtfulness has been exhibited to me
repeatedly over the years in many individual acts of kindness, to my own knowledge, to
friends, family, and to many third parties including employees whether it was financial help
with school fees, or providing needed accommodation or cash to help out with an
