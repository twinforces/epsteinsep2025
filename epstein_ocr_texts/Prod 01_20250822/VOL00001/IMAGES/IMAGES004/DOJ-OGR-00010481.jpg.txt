more than prisoners in mainstream conditions, it follows that proportionality requires the severity
of confinement be factored into sentencing. Courts sentence convicted offenders to prison as
punishment. Courts order pretrial defendants detained to safeguard the community and to ensure
presence at court proceedings, not for punishment. In evaluating the nature and extent of
punishment, it is important to factor in the actual impact of the hardship on the defendant. If
detention imposes an additional burden on a certain category of defendants, it is necessary to
incorporate the actual total burden of the punishment into sentencing calibrations.

The principle of proportionality requires that the additional burden experienced by Ms.
Maxwell during the 22 months spent is in supermax-type conditions should be factored into the
Court’s sentencing calculus. Based on the underpinnings of punishment and the principle of
proportionality, a hard-time credit for Ms. Maxwell’s unusual detention is warranted.
Imprisonment in any form is a severe hardship. This is especially so when a person presumed to
be innocent is detained pretrial. The standard measure for evaluating the hardship of incarceration
is the length of the prison term, i.e., a value is placed on this quantitative measure when assessing
damages for wrongful conviction. Regardless of whether there is an objective mathematical
formula for Ms. Maxwell’s unique situation, a meaningful credit is warranted.’

There is a manifestly stark qualitative difference in the degree of deprivation, restriction,
and punishment between the first 22 months of Ms. Maxwell’s detention and her current detention
in general population. Her detention in isolation — de facto solitary confinement comparable to
27 Compensation determinations for individuals wrongfully incarcerated is illustrative. Thirty-six states and
Washington, DC, have laws that offer compensation for exonerees. The federal standard to compensate
those who are wrongfully convicted is a minimum of $50,000 per year of incarceration, plus an additional
$50,000 for each year spent on death row. See https://www.congress.gov/bill/] 17th-congress/house-
bill/4019/text?r=13&s=1,The enhanced compensation for incarceration on death row recognizes the
qualitative severity of punishment beyond that which non-capital inmates are exposed.
