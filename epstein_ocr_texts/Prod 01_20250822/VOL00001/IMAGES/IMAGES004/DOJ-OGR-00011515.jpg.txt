Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 734-8 Filed 07/15/22 Page 10of13
| Probate ST-19-PB-0080 171
1} program, quote, contains no assurances that
2) the information submitted by a claimant cannot |
3| be later used against her if she thereafter
4| decides to file suit against the estate or any |
5| other co-defendant.
6 Is that criticism grounded in
7| the way you see the program? |
8) A. No. No. The protocol expressly |
9) secures the confidentiality of anything
10| provided by the claimant. The claimant, and
11; the claimant alone, decides the extent of
12) transparency or disclosure - not the program, |
13} not the administrator, or the estate.
14) Q. A few more, on Page 6,there's a |
15| concern that notes, quote, the program
16} provides no protection to claimants who
17} voluntarily provide information that may later |
18} be used to defend the estate from claims or
19} provides evidence against other victims. Does |
20| the program work that way? |
21) A. No. The program seals all the
22! information and various common law and
23| statutorial privileges apply. We've seen that
24; in these other programs - attorney-client,
25} etcetera; settlement discussions, etcetera.
