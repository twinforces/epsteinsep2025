Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 616 Filed 02/24/22 Page 28 of 32

For all the reasons given in.the motion, Rule of Evidence 606(b)'poses no bar to the
inquiry this Court should.conduct on Ms. Maxwell’s motion, primarily bécause:Ms. Maxwell
possesses evidence from external to the deliberations to substantiate Juror No. 50°s bias. To the
extent the Rule: might apply as a bar to limit certain questions, it violates Ms. Maxwell’s
constitutional rights‘to duc:process and to. confrontation as applied to her. U.S. Const. amends.

V,, VI; of. Pena-Rodrigues y. Colorado, 137 S.Ct, 855 (2017) (finding the no-impeachment rule
of 606(b) ‘unconstitutional as, applied. to juror statements, indicating ractal. bias). The Rules of
Evidence cannot constitutionally prevent Ms. Maxwell from-proving juror: misconduct and
vindicating her'right to‘a fair and ‘impartial jury."
3.. The Additional Biased. Juror Should Be Questioned.
As detailed in the motion. at 21, a.sccond:juror has alerted the, New York, Times that'they
identity: is currently unknown.also failed to disclose their victimhood in:response to:‘Question,

48." ‘The: government would like to bury its head.in the sand and deprive Ms. Maxwell ofthe.

'' See also. Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 40, 49 & n.3 (holding, before Pena-Rodrigues
was decided, that Rule 606(b) bars inquiry to “deliberations evidence” when, secking a new trial
based on juror false statements, during voir dire’but recognizing that “[t]here maybe cases of
juror bias so extreme that, almost by definition, the jury trial right has been abridged. If and.
when stich a, case arises, the Court can. consider whether the usual safcguards aré or aré not
sufficient to protect the integrity of the:process. We:need not. consider'the question, however, for
those facts are not presented-here.”).

Warger doesn’t: control here, though, if only. because it*was a civil and‘not a criminal
case. Moreover, in this case, Juror No. 50’s statenients admitting to having-provided. false
answers during veirdire are statements he:personally:made to the media and ‘on social media.
Those statements are not “deliberations evidence” and:not subject to Rule 606(b):in any case;
even‘under Warger.
