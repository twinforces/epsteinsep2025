talk, to listen to someone’s problems.

Ghislaine’s commitment to ocean conservation and the creation of a charity that engaged
with literally thousands of people across the globe is an example of what her drive,
determination and ability to organise can achieve.
| urge you to take into the balance of your consideration about sentencing, notwithstanding
the gravity of the offences of which she has been found guilty, Ghislaine’s previous lifetime
good character, the high regard and continuing love and esteem of her friends and family
based on a lifetime’s knowledge of her, her character, conduct and achievements; the very
real hope and expectation that she be allowed to participate with and contribute to once
more her family, friends and society at large.
Yours sincerely
Kevin Maxwell
