1 Once we get through, assuming we get through juror

2 no. 1 without any for-cause issues, I will turn to juror no. 2

15 main panel and one strike as to the alternate panel.

16 Obviously, before anyone is dismissed, I will hear from counsel
17 if any applications or issues need to be raised if you are

18 satisfied with our jury. Once we get there we will read the

19 names of the selected jurors, dismiss to the jury department

22 the jurors to the jury room, which is an outfitted courtroom so
23 they can put their belongings down, she can give them notebook
24 and pen, bring them back in. At that point she will swear the
25 jury and I will give preliminary instructions and opening
