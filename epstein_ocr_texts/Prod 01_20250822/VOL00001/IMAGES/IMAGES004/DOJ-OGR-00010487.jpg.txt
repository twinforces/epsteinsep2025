Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 663 Filed 06/15/22 Page 41 of 77
Ghislaine’s evaluation in this area of trauma could only be
favourable to her case. We should say that we ourselves have
undergone lengthy psychoanalytical treatment.

We felt that the quality of the attachment of Ghislaine with Epstein —

revealed characteristics similar to those of entrapment, affecting

those in abusive relationships In this respect we felt sad that

the contribution of the expert in intimate partner violence, Dr. Park

Dietz, could not be heard.

Her relationship with Epstein began at a moment of extreme

vulnerability in Ghislaine’s life after the tragic death of our

father. He our father) was a powerful and dominant figure. And as

elder siblings we witnessed our father taking Ghislaine under his

wing whereby she became over dependent on his approval and

vulnerable to his frequent rapid mood swings, huge rages and

rejections. This led her to becoming very vulnerable to abusive and

powerful men who would be able to take advantage of her innate

good nature.

It is striking that Ghislaine did not show any perverse behaviour

before she met Epstein. Nor did she show any after leaving him,
