1 aspirations of going to law school, and I knew I could not do

2 so without my undergraduate degree, so I declined it.

i) When Ghislaine found out, she flew into a rage. I

4 didn't understand why until she told me that she and Epstein

5 were responsible for giving me that opportunity and that in

6 turning it down I was being ungrateful. I now know that this

7 was their standard operating procedure. Give a gift or a favor
8 and then demand sex in return. Nevertheless, I completed my

9 course work, got my degree from FIT, at which point I left

10 Henri Bendel and took a position at Bloomingdales. I wanted to
11 leave Epstein and Maxwell and the abuse they perpetrated

12 against me behind as I started my professional life. I never
13 wanted to or expected to see them again.

14 One day in the fall of 1995, Maxwell showed up at

15 Bloomingdales looking for me. When I asked her how she knew

16 where I was, she said she asked my colleagues at Henri Bendel.
17 She immediately began befriending me once again, asking me to
18 go out socially. I tried to resist but eventually she wore me
19 down, and I began spending time with them again. They made me
20 feel like they were friends, contemporaries.
21 In one instance, they took me to Florida and insisted
22 that I stay longer than planned which caused me to miss work
23 and led to me being fired. Seizing on this new vulnerability
24 they began trafficking me to their friends. By that time I was
25 trapped. I was assaulted, raped and trafficked countless times
