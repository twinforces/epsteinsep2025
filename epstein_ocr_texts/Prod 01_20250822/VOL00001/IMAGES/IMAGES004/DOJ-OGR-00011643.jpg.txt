now that's different from what's anticipated in light. of the
government's notice and, the marked ‘exhibits and, 3500 material,
wheh would you liké t6 provide additidénal notice?

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, some of the "marked
exhibits" are a placeholder f6r an entire hard drive that. has
any number of documents on, it. Lf the government. is now
representing they will only be referring to the décuménts that
ane separately marked and not to exhibits that say "hard drive
58," "hard drive 85," "hard drive 96," we could dé that, but
they haven't made that representation.

THE GOURT: Fair enough.

MR.. ROHRBACH: Those drives ane marked, for
identification for authentication purposes, but to the extent
that the point is that Mr. Kelso is going to testify about
general principles associated with the creation of documents
