Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 662 Filed 06/15/22 Page 10 of 29

17. (GX-3-B).. Carolyn further testified that she had. trouble remembering details of the events
in question and affirmed that she: [doesn’t] remember the: times and. dates” of her visits. to
Epstein’s Palm.Beach-residenee. (Tr. 1525, 1559).

The government, asserts that Carolyn’s recollection can be credited because even if she
when the event took place. (PSR at 53). As set forth above, this claim is flatly contradicted by
the record. If Carolyn. could not:accuratcly remember how old. she was, when she; first-met
Epstein, the Court should not credit:her recollection .of how. old she. was when she last:saw-him.

Carolyn’s memory of when.she stopped sccing Epstcin was not only unreliable, but also
contradicted bythe other evidence in ‘the record. Carolyn herself testified that her last
interactions with Epstein. were ‘when she returned from Georgia after giving birth to her son on
Mareh 14, 2004. (Tr. 1548-49). Carolyn stated that she went. back to Epstein “four or five
times” because she needed. monicy to buy things ‘for her son, but eventually gave up when it
‘became clear that she was too old for Epstein. (Tr. 1549).4 The message pads that were
admitted in evidence. corroborate that these interactions occurred from. approximately late: spring
through summer 2004, when. Carolyn was:.7 years old. (See GX-3-E (undated message from.
“Carolyn Andriano”; surrounded by messages dated April, 29: and May.2 and included in a.book.
of messages ‘from 2004); GX-3-I (July 6:message from “Caroline Ambriano”s iricluded ina book
‘of messages from 2004); GX-1-B-(July 30 message from “Garolyn.Andriano”; next:to. a message

dated August 1.2, 2004 ‘and included in,a, book of messages from.2004). Accordingly, the trial

4Carolyn’s memory of.her‘interactions with-Epstein:around.the time:of the Georgia interlude: was also’ inconsistent
and contradictory: On-the one hand,, Carolyn'testified that she left'Elorida in 2003: “to escape’ the:traumatic.events”
that'had. happened.in Palm Beach and traveled.to*?Georgia'where she became pregnant*with her child. (Tr: 1548-49,
1617, 1668). On the-other.hand, Carolyn-testified: that she continued to visit -Epstein.in Palny Beach while she was:
pregnant. (Tr: 1549).
