Case 1:09-cr-00581-WHP Document 522 Filed 04/06/12 Page 2 of 29
separate question of whether the motion for a new trial based on the conduct of juror Conrad is
meritorious. That is not a question of legal ethics.
3. In summary, my opinion is that (i) the Brune & Richard lawyers had no ethical obligation
to disclose the results of their March 2011 research in March, or the results of their March and
May 2011 research in May; (ii) the Brune & Richard lawyers had no ethical obligation to ,
disclose the existence or the results of their March and May research in their July 8 motion for a
new trial or during the July 15 conference call with the Court; and (iii) nothing the Brune &
Richard lawyers said or did in the July 8 memorandum or the July 15 conference call violated
their ethical obligations.

Factual Assumptions
4. I have read the following documents: -
--Catherine Conrad’s letter to the Government dated May 25, 2011;
--Defendants’ Brief in Support of a New Trial dated July 8.2011;
--Transcript of Telephone Conference with Court dated July 15, 2011; .
--Letter from Susan Brune dated July 21, 2011;
--Letter from Susan Brune dated July 29, 2011;
--Affidavit of Susan Brune with Exhibits (including Catherine Conrad’s jury questionnaire and
voir dire responses) dated September 15, 2011;
--Government’s Waiver Brief dated October 7, 2011;
--Defendant Parse’s Waiver Brief dated October 27,2011; and -
--Transcript of Hearing dated February 15 and 16, 2012.
5. My opinion is based on the cited documents and I assume as true the facts that emerge
from the sworn testimony at the hearing held February 15 and 16, 2012. I note that the testimony
at that hearing was subject to robust adverse direct examination by Government attorneys.
