be helpful to her. Indeed, she again ignores that the flight manifests may well have helped the
Government. Once again, the defendant’s argument is entirely speculative and unsupported by the
record. The defendant offers no proof or basis for concluding that the flight manifests would be
helpful and merit the extreme relief she seeks.

Third, the defendant’s “motion is unsupported by any proof that might substantiate a
finding of actual and substantial prejudice as a result of the delay.” Berry, 2021 WL 2665585, at
*2 (citing Birney, 686 F.2d at 106). The defendant’s “bare assertions do not satisfy the ‘definite
and not speculative’ requirements attendant on the [defendant’s] ‘heavy burden’ to show actual
prejudice.” Jd. Instead, the defendant appears to “rely on the proposition that the loss of evidence
merits an inference that the evidence would have been both favorable and material.” /d. The
defendant, however, is “not entitled to any such inference” “[a]s the side that bears the burden.”
Id. “Without even a cursory showing of what the evidence would have shown, the [defendant]
raise[s] ‘at most the possibility of prejudice,’ but ‘[nJo actual prejudice is established.’” Jd.
(quoting United States v. Foddrell, 523 F.2d 86, 88 (2d Cir. 1975)).

In short, the defendant’s complaints are nothing more than the type of self-serving, vague,
speculative, and conclusory claims of prejudice that courts have consistently rejected as
insufficient to warrant dismissal of charges based upon pre-indictment delay. The motion should
therefore be denied.

would have contained the information as the defendant speculates, much less that they would have
been helpful to the defense.
