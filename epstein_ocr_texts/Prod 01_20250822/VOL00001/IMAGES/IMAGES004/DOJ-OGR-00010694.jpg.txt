Epstein/Maxwell quid pro quo as the “Hotel California;” you can check-out any time you like, but

conduct. Both statements further describe that for many years after finally extricating themselves
physically from the Epstein/Maxwell trap, they suffered serious mental and physical illnesses.
Elizabeth discusses numerous hospitalizations for mental breakdowns and being unable to hold

Both Sarah and Elizabeth have submitted VISs to the probation office for inclusion in the
Presentence Investigation Report. See Declaration of Robert Y. Lewis, dated June 23, 2022.

For the reasons set forth below, the Court should allow Sarah and Elizabeth to read their
victim impact statements at Maxwell’s sentencing hearing.
