1 I got supplemental briefing on to discuss. The motion in

2 limine 7 of the defense, which is Government Exhibit 52, I got

3 supplemental briefing on that; supplemental briefing on a few

4 exemplars of co-conspirator statements; the remaining disclosed

5 defense experts perhaps, so we'll discuss that. I have a few

6 other things just to tick off the list, and go over logistics

7 for Monday, and take your questions or hear your issues.

8 Ms. Comey, anything before we get underway?

9 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. We do have a few issues
10 to raise. The first is that unfortunately I do think we will
11 need to ask for a briefing schedule to preclude
12 cross-examination on certain topics of government witnesses.

13 On Friday afternoon, the government conferred with defense
14 counsel. We presented about a dozen topics that we believe are
15 clearly improper topics for cross-examination. Yesterday
16 defense counsel told us that they're not in a position to tell
17 us that they will not cross on any of those topics. Because
18 there are many of them and because they include things like
19 criminal convictions that are beyond the scope of 609 and other
20 personal information that might either identify anonymized
21 witnesses or embarrass witnesses, we would ask to be able to
22 submit briefing rather than raise those issues on the public
23 record.
24 THE COURT: You can, but not until you have further
25 discussion and narrow disputes, because that's going to happen.
