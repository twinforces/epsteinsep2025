Her relationship with ‘Epstcin. began at.'a, moment of ¢xtreme vulnerability
Ghislainc's life after the tragic death, of our father. He (our father) was a‘powerful,
aiid.dominant figure. And as elder siblings we witnessed our father'taking Ghislaine
under his wing whereby she became over dependent on his approval: and vulnerable:
to his ‘frequent: rapid. ; mood swings, huge rages and. rejections. This led her to.
becoming very vulnerable’ to abusive andpowerful, ‘men who would. be able to
take advantage of her innate good nature.

Itus striking that Ghislaine did not show any perverse. behaviour before she.met
Epstein. Nor did she show any: after leaving shim. ‘which. she eventually manaece

Exhibit A.
Another psychotherapist and family friend of some.55: years, James Martin Hollomon,

[W]e were privileged, but we were, not entitled and life, was. notalways ‘perfect.

Unfortunately, our family also became a gricving family. Our eldest brother
Michaclwas gravely injured in a, car accident just after Ghislaine was born; he:
remained in a,coma until-his death when, Ghislaine was seven years-old. In, spite:
of this tragedy, | I watched. Ghislaine learn, to adapt, and, to become a productive
and, caring human being.

[BJoth of our’ rparents had an. ineredible. work ethic. We ‘were all cricouraged

that came with that privilege. | have witnessed’ that work ethic i in n Ghislaine.

demanded hard, diligent: work, great:intelligence, ‘great management skills,
