1 (Case called)

2 THE DEPUTY CLERK: Counsel, please state your name for
3 the record, starting with the government.

4 MR. HOBSON: Good morning, your Honor. Adam Hobson,

5 Jacob Fiddelman, and Dominic Gentile for the government.

6 THE COURT: Good morning.

7 For the defendant?

8 MR. DeMARCO: Good morning. For Mr. Berry, Mark

9 DeMarco and Ezra Spilke, Ms. Mayerlin Ulerio, and of course

10 Mr. Berry.

11 THE COURT: Good morning, counsel.

12 Good morning, Mr. Berry.

13 THE DEFENDANT: Good morning.

14 THE COURT: I had hoped to start at 9:00 but Mr. Berry
15 wasn't brought until now. Hopefully that won't repeat going

16 forward. We will make sure that things are in place to prevent
17 that so we can timely get started each day.

18 I thank everyone for being here on time. Let me ask,
19 as a matter of procedure, we will wait for the jury department
20 to let us know when the panel is checked in and assembled and
21 in their seats, and then can head over to 500 Pearl to commence
22 jury selection. My purpose for today is to confirm the receipt
23 of the voir dire questionnaire that I sent yesterday with the
24 noted change, make sure everybody got that. The second is to
25 confirm that there have been no additional plea offers. And
