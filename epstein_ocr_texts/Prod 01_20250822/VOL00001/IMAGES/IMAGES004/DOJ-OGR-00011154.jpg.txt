B. The Court reserves judgment on the admissibility of Dr. Hall’s fact testimony

Finally, two of Dr. Hall’s anticipated opinions are ‘fact testimony'fiot subject to Rule 702.
Specifically, Dr. Hall would. testify that.Alleged Victim 4 told him that she previously disclosed.
other sexual abuse to.a’prior mental health. provides[ but.did not: disclose ‘abuse
by Epsteinto[ |. Defi Br. at'16.? Further, ‘Dr. Hall would:testify that in theit interview
Alleged-Victim,4 “didnot identify Ms. Maxwell asa perpetrator of any abuse.” Notice at 12.
The Defense argues these; statements, are admissible as prior inconsistent statements. Def. Br: at
16-17. The Government concedes that Dr. Hall’s testimony here would be:admissible, including
potentially as‘a’prior ‘inconsistent statement, if relevant. and-not otherwise excludable. Gov't Br.
at 16, 18.

The Court reserves judgment on this. question, but:provides'this guidance. The Defense
will cross-examine Alleged’ Victim.4 and, ‘as the Court has previously ruled, it may ‘ask whether
Alleged Victim.4 on previous océasions implicated Ms. Maxwell in the.alleged sexual abuse by
Epstein. ‘Nov. |, Tr. at'27. Whether the ’Defense:may then admit any’ of Dr. Hall’s testimony will,
depend. on, Alleged Victim 4’s response to that question, whether any‘prior statement: is actually’
“inconsistent” with herresponse, see: United States v. Trzaska, V1.1 F.3d 1019, 1024-25 (2d Cir.
1997) (reversing ‘a.district.court’s admission of prior statements that,were not inconsistent), and.
Whether the Defense satisfies the other'requirements of admitting extrinsic evidence of a prior

inconsistent: statement under Federal Rule:of Evidence 613.

* From the parties’ bricfing, the Court:understands, that. the Defense would not: seck to admit: Dr.
Hall’s testimony about’what Alleged Victim 4 told[__] for the truth of the matter asserted,
as that would be-hearsay: with no: apparent exception. See Def. Br. at‘16.(referring to. Alleged
Victim 4’s statements tol and stating “[t]his evidence is admissible:as.a:prior
inconsistent.statement”). Even then, however, the Court is skeptical that.a. situation would arise
in-which,this statement; could be used,to contradict.Alleged Victim 4’ testimony without.
assuming the statement’s truth.
