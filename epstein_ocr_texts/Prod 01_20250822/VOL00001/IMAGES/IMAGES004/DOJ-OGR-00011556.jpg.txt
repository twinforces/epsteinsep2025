United States v. Guerrero, 910 F.3d, 72 (2a Cir. 2018). Here,
the parties and the probation department agree that applying

the current Guidélinés would résultt tin a Significantly longer

sentence than the application of the guidelines in. place when.

the defendant committed her offensé, whether that is’ the 2003
or 2004 guidelines.

indictment alleged ended an 2004. It's proof at trial that the
conspiracy continued in 2004 related to Carolyn. And the
charged, conspiracy had to end no later than very early 2005
because that's when Carolyn turhéd 18 and can no longér bé
deemed a victim of the federal sex-trafficking offense changed
which proscribés Gohduct with respect to individuals undér the
age of 18. So the government purports to carry ‘its burden, on
this issue based 6n poértidns 6f Carolyn's testimony and sdéme
message pads regarding what occurred ian 2004 and 2005.

Let. me State Clearly, I found, as I said repeatedly in
my factual conclusions on the PSR objections, I found ‘Carolyn
to be a credible witness; as did the jury. The question before
