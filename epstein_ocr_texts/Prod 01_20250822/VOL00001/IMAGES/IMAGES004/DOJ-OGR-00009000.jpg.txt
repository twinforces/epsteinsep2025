There exists no compelling reason to release Juror 50’s pleadings. Any public release of
the documents will set off another round of publicity, speculation, and commentary, all of which
is prejudicial to the truth finding process and Ms. Maxwell’s rights to fair and impartial
proceedings.

The pleadings filed by Juror 50 have questionable merit, have not been ruled upon, and
implicate an ongoing investigation by the parties and the court into juror misconduct. Certainly,
at least at this stage of the proceedings, the pleadings are not “judicial documents” and until the
issues around Juror 50’s motion for intervention and discovery have been resolved they should
remain sealed. If the Court believes Juror 50’s pleadings merit judicial document status the seal
should remain. The pleadings would be afforded the lowest presumption of public access and
compelling reasons to maintain the sealed status exist.

Juror 50 has demonstrated a lack of reliability and an appetite for publicity. Should the
documents be released the sotto voce comments regarding Juror 50’s intent, state of mind, and
actions will be fodder for the media and may influence the memories of other potential
witnesses, including notably the other jurors. Documents regularly remain sealed where public
release would “compromis[e] the interest in the integrity and security of [an] investigation,” Jn re
