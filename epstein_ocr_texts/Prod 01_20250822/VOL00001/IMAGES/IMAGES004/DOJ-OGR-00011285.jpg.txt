page: 3524-013,’ page 3 of 8, on.May. 14, 2021, after: being interviewed multiple times, the
witness said:

EPSTEIN noted once that when he and. Maxwell dated that MAXWELL. would

bring more girls for threcsomes, saying they were sexual relationships. [7

did ‘not recall ‘when. or where EPSTEIN said this to.her. EPSTEIN told[~__—/J

that MAXWELL brought him girls.

The witness continued discussing her “impressions” of the conversation. Nothing in her
“impressions” about: this conversation, relate to Epstein using the discussion to further any
conspiracy. The’witness docs not indicate that any of the “girls” were underage. The:witness
further advised.that during the time she worked for Epstein.“she did. not get the sense’that.he and.
MAXWELL were still in.a romaiitic: relationship.” Jd. Accordingly; the context of the statement:
reflects that anything said by Epstein was “idle chatter” and not. something ‘in. furtherance of any
conspiracy.

The Court should also. exclude. this statcnient under Fed. R. Evid. 403 because, the
probative valuc of the:statement is substantially outweighed ‘by the prejudicial, impact to: Ms.
Maxwell. Epstein is dead and‘not subject to cross examination. It-is not clear by the ‘proffer what
Ms. Maxwell “used todo.” The. witness could-speculate that Epstcin:meant solicit underage
females but, the evidence’ at, trial will establish that Ms. Maxwell hired ‘a number of employees for
Epstcin-prior to 2004. The: statement is overly ‘prejudicial especially when viewed in the context
‘of the other evidence that the government. claims it will produce at trial, ive., direct. statements
from accusers:'that;{Ms. Maxwell reeruited them. This’post-hoc statement attributedto Epstein, by
4 Cooperating, witness (17 years later) will’ be used by the government'to argu¢ that Epstein,
admitted that: Ms. Maxwell was a co-conspirator. Given the weak foundation, forthe alleged

statement; the Court: should exclude it..At.a minimum, the:Court should review the circumstances
