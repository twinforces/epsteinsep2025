Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document648  Filed:03/15/22 Page 5of16

‘intended to’ mislead the Court, while completing his jury questionnaire or during voir dirc., Juror

3° ve

50, testified under oath that. he made an “[iJnadvertent mistake,” “one of the biggest mistakes [he
has] ever made in. [his] life.” (Mar. 8,.2022 Tr. at.14:23-24). On:this record, the defendant cannot
‘satisfy the first prong of the McDonough test.

In. particular, at the hearing, Juror 50 acknowledged that ke inaccurately answered Question,
friends or family. members had. been a victim of sexual harassment, scxual.abuse, or sexual assault.
Juror SO: explained. that he: “didn’t sce the part [of Question 48] where it says sclf, I just—I
completely‘skimmed-way foo fast.” (/d. at ‘14:10=11;.see ulsovid. at ‘14:23-15:2). ‘The:questionnaire
and 'the procéss by which Juror 50 conipleted.'the questionnaire “must be viewed if Context.”
United States 'v. Fell, No. 01. Gr. 12 (WKS), 2014 WL 3697810, at. *13: (D. Vt. July 24, 2014).
Juror 50’s description. of the process. of completing the questionnaire on, November 4, 2021.
erédibly explained how he came ‘to make Unintentional, mistakes on. the questionnaire. Juror 50
testified that he arrived at the courthouse carly, waited 45 minutes to get through the security line,
and. then. sat: in. the courthouse for hours, before’ the Court’s video ‘with instructions on ‘the
questionnaire was played. successfully. (/d. at 12:4-6, 14:10-19). He explained that by the time
he was answering the later questions ‘in the questionnaire, such as Question 48, he was “super
distracted” because of his proximity to the table where prospective jurors were dropping off their

questionnaires and “all the: noise going on, around” him, noting that “[p]eople were asking

McDonoiigh?s prong one, [the juror] dishonestly answered questions at voir dire”). Further; the
defendant suggests that:Shaoul'is inconsistent with. Vnited.States v. Langford, 990 F.2d.65 (2d: Cir.
1993), which—the defendant says—held. that deliberateness iis not required on. prong one. She:
therefore argucs that, as the carlicr decision, Langford controls rather than Shaoul. (Dkt., No. 644
at 12-13). But as Shaoul itself explained, it is not; inconsistent. with, Langford; rather, ‘the:
defendant’s reading of Langford is incorrect. 41. F.3d at 815-16.
