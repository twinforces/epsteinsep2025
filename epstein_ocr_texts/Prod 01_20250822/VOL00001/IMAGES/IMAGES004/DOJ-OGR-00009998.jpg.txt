C2GFDAU1 Brune - direct

1 research about the jurors in this case, is that correct,

2 potential jurors?

3 A. That was one of the things that he did for us. And to be

4 clear, when I say research, what I'm talking about is accessing
5 computer databases concerning the jurors. There was a

6 relatively short period to accomplish that, and 50 a

re combination of the paralegal team and the Nardello firm

8 accomplished that.

9 Q. And are you distinguishing that from, say, out in the field
10 work, going to visit people, talking to them?
LE A. Yes. His specific instructions were that no one should
12 leave his office, that it was to be simply database research.
13 Q@. And were those your instructions?
14 A. Those were my instructions, although I think Mr. Nardello
15 is an ethical man and I don't think he would have done

16 otherwise, but I wanted to be very clear with him.
17 Q. You also had Suann Ingle of Ingle Communications work on
18 your team?
a A. Yes.
20 QO. What was her role for your team?
21 A. Suann did graphics for the opening statement and the
22 closing statement and perhaps some for Dr. DeRosa, and in
23 addition she was in court to just sort of play the PowerPoint
24 during the opening and the closing.
cape Q. So she was one of the people along the wall, is that right?
