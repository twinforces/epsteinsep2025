*! Tt is truc that, in 1996, the Sccond Circuit held that Rule: 408 “docs not require exclusion. of
evidence relating‘to a civil settlement in. a criminal trial.” Manko:v. United States, 87 F.3d 50, 51.
(2d Cir. 1996). ‘But in,2006, the rule:was, amended to:‘make: clear that it applies .‘in, ‘that
circumstance. As the Seventh Circuit has noted: “In:2006 the Supreme ‘Court promulgated an
ametidiment to Rule, 408 demonstrating that at least the new version (which took effect. on
December 1, 2006) applies to criminal « cases.” United. States’ v, ” Roll 484 F.3d 934, 236 (7th Cir.
compromise’ ‘negotiations of other disputed claims are’ not admissible i in 1 subsequent: criminal
litigation, when offered to, prove liability: for, invalidity: of, or amount of those claims”); scé also:
Fed. R. Evid. '1101(b) (rules of evidence apply in.criminal proccédings). And the Second Circuit
has since addressed:the substance of a Rule 408 argument'on a criminal appeal, without
reference to. Manko or to any possibility that Rule 408 was inapplicable i in.criminal cases. See
United States v. Wahl, 563'F. App’x.45, 50-51 (2d Cir. 2014).
