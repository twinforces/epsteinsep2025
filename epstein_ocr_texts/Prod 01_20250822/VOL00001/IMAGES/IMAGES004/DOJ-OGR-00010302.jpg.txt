his ability to render a.verdict. based solely on, the evidence presented, at. trial and the Court’s
instructions as to the law, and that “[a]bsolutely in no way” would his experience with-prior sexual
abuse interfere: with-his ability to assess the credibility of witnesses alleging scxual.abuse. (/d. at.
25:23-26:10).. Juror'50 answered the questions quickly and forthrightly, and his demeanor evineed,
that he. was a ‘fair and scrious juror'who deeply regretted making an inadvertent crtor. See Greer,
285 F.3d-at 171 (quoting United Statesv..Lorres, 128 F.3d:38, 44 (2d:Cir. 1997), for the proposition.
‘that a “finding of actual bias is based ‘upon determinations of demeanor and credibility’ that are
peculiarly within a-trial judge’s province.”)."

On this. record, it is evident. that Juror50 would ‘not have been struck for cause. Of the 58
individuals ‘who, were: qualificd. to, serve as jurors, cight individuals. disclosed, in their ‘written

questionnaires that ‘they themselves had.’been a victim. of :scxual. harassment, sexual abusc, or

+ Juror’ 50’s answers about whether he thought his family or friends would learn about his sexual
abuse through his press interviews do not-undermine his eredibility: While the trial participants,

who have been attentive to developments in this case: for years, quickly lcarned.-of Juror ‘50’s
‘statements, Juror 50 reasonably thought differently about his. friends and, family. As Juror 50
explained, his family and, friends “didn’t even, know that this trial, was even, happening” when. he
‘revealed that he had been on the jury through social medid—media in which he:did not réveal. his
own. expericnée with abuse. (Mar. 8, 2022 Tr..at.42715-43:9). Juror 50'therefore. expected’ ‘that. “a.
little article about a,juror giving x their experience wouldn’t be. . really in the news at.all.” (/d. at.
42:21-23).. His family: and. friends appcar not to: have consumed. media. about. the trial—just like:
many of the actual, and‘prospective jurors in this case, who teported no or ‘almost: no exposure to
the defendant or Jeffrey Epstein on their questionnaires. (See, é.g.; Juror 7; Juror 20; Juror 37;

Juror 54; Juror 89; Juror 15: 1). It.is even-more‘unlikely that they wold learn about his experience
with abuse given:that Juror 50:did not‘use his last name, disconnecting his press interviews from
his Google search results, and that he g gaye'two of his three interviews to foreign press. (See Dkt.

No. 643 at,8-9). And Juror 50 did ‘not think that his interviews would trigger significant. public
attention and further proceedings in the case because he had attempted to answer the questions
honestly and had. nothing to, hide. (Mar: 8, 2022. Tr. at 22:23-23:5 (“I didn’t think this ‘would,
happen .. Jif [lied deliberately I wouldn’t have-told a-soul. I certainly-wouldn’t have put myself
in.a position . . . this position. that I’m. in. now, potentially any’ sort of. criminal. charges, .I just
wouldn’t have’ done it. It was an, honest, mistake’... .”)).. At worst, Juror '50’s expectations about.
the consequences of his interviews'reflect naivety; ‘they do not:reflect deception.
