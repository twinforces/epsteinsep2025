Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

As directed, I write to request that the Court permit three witnesses called by the defense
to testify using pseudonyms or their first names only. Those witnesses are J, Michelle
Healy, and gg. Ms. Maxwell submits this letter at the request of these witnesses.!

Ms. Maxwell has conferred with the government about this request. The government
opposes any form of protective anonymity for these witnesses.

BACKGROUND

So far, there have been ten trial days in this case. During that time, several witnesses have
testified using a pseudonym or their first name only. These witnesses include three of the four
alleged victims (Jane, Kate, and Carolyn) and two other government witnesses (Matt and

' Ms. Maxwell may call as witnesses individuals who share the same true last name as the
alleged victims in this case. Consistent with this Court’s earlier ruling, and subject to her earlier
objections, Ms. Maxwell does not oppose these witnesses testifying using pseudonyms or their
first names only.
