1 plausible. You are going to see, based on the evidence and,

2 importantly, the lack of evidence, that they do not support the
3 charges in this indictment, certainly not beyond a reasonable

4 doubt. There will be no eyewitnesses to their accounts, even

5) when they claim there were all these other people involved in

6 the activities that the government has alleged. There will not
7 be documentation, even that which still exists some 25 years

8 later, that is going to corroborate their testimony.

9 Now, I said before that Epstein was a manipulator. He
10 had the money and the means to create an exceptional world:

11 Beautiful homes, beautiful surroundings, beautiful people. But
12 he also was a mysterious man without attachment. He had no

13 wife, he had no children, he had no boss; yet he attracted all
14 these rich, powerful, famous people before and after his fall
15 from grace back in around 2008. In many regards, he was like a
16 2lst century James Bond. His mystery has stirred interest and
17 his accusers have shaken the money tree and millions of dollars
18 have fallen their way.

19 But Epstein wasn't the only one who manipulated, even
20 though he was a man who, as I said, compartmentalized, had
21 eccentricities, very specific requirements about his diet, his
22 daily physical regime, he demanded perfection, he demanded
23 solitude and silence; but he also surrounded himself with
24 people and traveled at times with an entourage. Yet as open as
25 that may seem, he kept parts of his life locked from others.
