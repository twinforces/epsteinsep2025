meal or helping a younger sibling . . . do [his] homework”); letter of Thomas E. Carnaghi (David
“ts truly a model father [who] sets the bar high for his boys”).”

For the past 15 years, David has devoted much of his free time to coaching youth
sports teams in his community. In his letter to the Court, Phil Allen describes the depth of
David's commitment:

In our town’s Little League Baseball organization, David has held

every volunteer position from an assistant coach to a team

manager. I have seen him do everything from raking baseball

fields ...to throwing batting practice .... During basketball

season, David has also been the coach or assistant coach for

numerous grammar school teams. If there is one example of the

depth of David’s commitment to coaching, it is the basketball

training sessions he designed and managed for students outside of

the organized teams he coached. On his own initiative, David

arranged for a gym to be available during the week for all children,

even those who didn’t make a team.... There are not many of us

_. Who would find the time to make such an impact on the lives of

the children in their community.

a difficult and thankless job in a small community; David has been a leader in Hinsdale in

volunteering his time and knowledge to help our community”),

February 2008, Theresa began experiencing severe dizziness, and the episodes often lasted hours

and sometimes days. Neck pain, heart palpitations and stomach pain followed. See letter of

Theresa Parse, A battery of tests has proven negative, and medication and a change of diet have

given her some relief. But health issues, which may be stress-related, continue to plague her.
