1 Despite my earnest effort I have not realized life's

2 true potential professionally, nor entered any healthy personal

3 relationships. I have never married, and I do not have

4 children, something I always wished for when I was a little

a girl. I shy away from meeting new people and have difficulty

6 making new friends because I fear they too could be associated

7 with Epstein and Maxwell and their enablers and

8 co-conspirators.

9 To this day I attend meetings to treat alcoholism, but
10 I have had numerous relapses, and I cannot always control that.
11 I know that only by the grace of God do I continue to live. I
12 have attemoted suicide twice since the abuse -- both near
13 fatal.

14 Last year, I traveled to New York to attend Maxwell's
15 trial. It was therapeutic to hear the testimony of the four
16 brave victim-witnesses, whose experience paralleled my own, to
17 know that I was not alone, and that our story was finally being
18 told for the world to hear.
19 IT am grateful the jury believed the victims and
20 returned a guilty verdict, but a question still tears at my
21 soul. After all of this, how can this five-star general of
22 this enormous sex-trafficking conspiracy involving hundreds, if
23 not thousands, of vulnerable girls and young women over three
24 decades continue to maintain her innocence? Reflecting on it,
25 I know the answer to my questions.
