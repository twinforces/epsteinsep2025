M6SOmaxs1.

Despite my earnest effort I have not realized life's

true potential professionally, nor entered any healthy personal
relationships. I) have never married, and I do not have
children, something I always wished for when I was a little

girl. I Shy away from meeting new people and Have difficulty

making new friends because I fear they tog could be associated
with Epstéin and Maxwell and their éenablérs and
eQ-conspirators.

To this day I attend meétings to ‘treat alcoholism, but
I. have had numerous relapses, and I cannot always. control. that.
I khow that only by the grate of God do I continue to livé. I
have attempted suicide twice since the abuse -- both near
fatal.

Last ‘year, I, ‘traveled to New York, to attend Maxwell's
trial. It was therapeutic to hear the testimony 6f the four

brave victim-witnesses, whose experience paralleled, my own, to

know that. I was nét alohe, and that our story was finally being

told for the world to hear.

I am grateful the jury believed the victims and
returned a, guilty verdict, but a question still tears at my
s6éul. After all 6f this, how can this five=star genéral of
this enormous. sex-trafficking conspiracy involving hundreds, if

not tHousands, of vulnerable girls and young women over threé

decades continue to maintain her innocence? Reflecting on it,

I. know the answer to my questions.
