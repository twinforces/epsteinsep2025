contains “emphatic language” which “preclude|s] categorical proscriptions on any factor concerning
the background, character, and conduct of the defendant, with the exception of invidious
factors.” /d. (emphasis in original) (citing United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 191 (2d Cir. 2008)
(en banc)).

Additionally, there is nothing in section 3661 limiting sentencing information to individuals
who meet the CVRA’s definition of being directly and proximately harmed by the offense. See
Degenhardt, 405 FSupp.2d 1341, 1343 (D. Utah 2005). Federal judges have broad discretion to
allow “affected individuals to present information to the court at sentencing.” United States v,
Gamma Tech Industries, Inc., 265 F.3d 917, 924 (9th Cir. 2001). See Williams v. New York, 337 U.S.
241, 245 (1949).

At least one federal court of appeals has considered the situation where a person provided
information to the sentencing court even though the defendant objected that the individual did not
meet the CVRA’s definition of victim. In United States v. Leach, 206 Fed. Appx. 432, 2006 WL
3203746 (6th Cir. 2006) (unpublished), the court, while sentencing the defendant to felon-in-
possession of a firearm, allowed the defendant’s estranged wife to be heard. She told the court that
the defendant was a dangerous man who had threatened to kill her. The Sixth Circuit held that the
sentencing court possessed discretion to hear from the wife under section 3661. The Court explained
that the CVRA “did not alter (or, more importantly, limit) a district court’s traditional broad
discretion to consider a wide variety of factors at sentencing.” /d. at 434.

These authorities clearly support the principle that this Court has broad unlimited discretion
in sentencing Maxwell to hear from anyone it believes will have relevant information. Sarah and
