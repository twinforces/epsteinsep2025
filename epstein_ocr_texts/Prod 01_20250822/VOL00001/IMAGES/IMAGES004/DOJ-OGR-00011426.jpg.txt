Def. Mot. for Sub, Attachment A.

Ms. Maxwell filed a motion for issuance of the subpoena, explaining how her subpoena
satisfied Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17(c) and the standard set forth in United States v.
Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974). Unlike Ms. Maxwell’s earlier subpoena to Boies Schiller & Flexner
(BSF), which the Court declined to issue, Dkt. Nos. 252, 298, the Court here authorized and
issued Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena to the EVCP, concluding (preliminarily and correctly) that it
was proper under Rule 17(c). See Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d at 561 (“As the Supreme Court has
explained, it is the responsibility of the court, not the opposing party, to ensure that a subpoena
secured under Rule 17(c) is for a proper purpose.” (citing United States v. Tomison, 969 F. Supp.
587, 594 (E.D. Cal. 1997))). Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena seeks production aft trial (not pretrial), and
it also requests that before the responsive material is produced to her for inspection, this Court
conduct an in camera review. Combined with the narrowness of her request, Ms. Maxwell has
suggested careful procedures to balance her need for the material and the accusers’ interests in
confidentiality.

Everyone agrees that Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena specifically identifies the requested
material, and there is no meaningful dispute that the material she seeks is both relevant and not
otherwise procurable. (The government and Accuser-2 offer cursory arguments about relevance,
which are easily dismissed.) Instead, the disagreement concerns whether the material is
admissible and whether enforcement of the subpoena would be unreasonable and oppressive.
