Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

Ms. Maxwell requests that the “Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion to Intervene
and for Release of Sealed Jury Questionnaire and Transcript, on Behalf of Proposed Intervenor,
Juror 50” and its companion Motion remain under seal, at least until a resolution of Ms.
Maxwell’s forthcoming motion for new trial based on this Juror’s failure to answer truthfully
during jury selection. Juror 50’s Motion and accompanying Memorandum are an attempt to
obtain discovery by a non-party to this criminal case, made by someone who lacks standing to
participate in this prosecution. Accordingly, these pleadings are not “judicial documents” and
are afforded no presumption of public access.

Juror 50 first seeks to intervene suggesting that “it is indisputable that precedent supports
intervention by interested third parties in criminal matters...” Memo. at 8.

Au contraire, “the long line of precedent hold[s] that a non-party lacks a judicially
cognizable interest in a defendant's prosecution.” United States v. Stoerr, 695 F.3d 271, 278 (3d
Cir. 2012). Juror 50 is not a party here and there is no legal basis for Juror 50 to intervene in this
