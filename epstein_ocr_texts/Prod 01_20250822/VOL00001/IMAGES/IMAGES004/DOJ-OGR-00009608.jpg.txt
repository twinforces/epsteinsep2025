made any. showing that the preindictment. delay. was an intentional device designed. by the
Goverment to gain.a.tactical advantage.”); Wnited States. Martinez, No. 94 Cr. 219 (RPP),.1995
WL 10849, at *4 (S.D.N-Y. Jan. 12, 1995) (“In..order to establish improper delay by the
Government in filing ‘an indictment, a defendant ‘must show that ‘the delay was the result of an,
intentional, device of the Government'to gain tactical advantage over the accused.” (citing, United
States: y. Hoo, 825 F.2d 667, 671 (2d.Cir. 1987))). Indeed, some version of the phrase:“‘delibcrate
device” and “tactical advantage” is found ‘in nearly every’ Sccond'Circuit decision on..the issue’
See, e.g., Alameh, 341 F.3d at ‘176 “intentionally used. delay to gain unfair tactical. advantage”);
Cornielle, 171 F.3d at 752 (requiring “intentional device” to gain, “tactical advantage”); Lawson,
683. F.2d,at 694 (delay not “engineered by the government-for an improper-purpose, such as gaining
a.tactical advantage”); Snyder, 668 F.2d.at.689; United States v. Watson, 599 F.2d.1149, 1156 n.5

4. Discussion

Because the defendant has: failed to establish ‘prejudice, the :Court need not. address the
defendant’s specious arguments: that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-indictment
delay was improper or designed to gain any’sort of tactical advantage. See Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL
4043140, at *5. In any évent, in denying the defendant’s pre-trial: motions and supplemental. pre-
trial motions, the Court noted the absence of “evidence that the: Government’s delay: in bringing
these: charges was designed ‘to thwart Maxwell’s ability to'’prepare a.defense.” (Dkt. No; 207 at.

17; Dkt. No. 317 at 10). That remains true.
