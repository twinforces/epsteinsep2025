made any showing that the preindictment delay was an intentional device designed by the
Government to gain a tactical advantage.”); United States v. Martinez, No. 94 Cr. 219 (RPP), 1995
WL 10849, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 12, 1995) (“In order to establish improper delay by the
Government in filing an indictment, a defendant must show that the delay was the result of an
intentional device of the Government to gain tactical advantage over the accused.” (citing United
States v. Hoo, 825 F.2d 667, 671 (2d Cir. 1987))). Indeed, some version of the phrase “deliberate
device” and “tactical advantage” is found in nearly every Second Circuit decision on the issue.
See, e.g., Alameh, 341 F.3d at 176 (“intentionally used delay to gain unfair tactical advantage”);
Cornielle, 171 F.3d at 752 (requiring “intentional device” to gain “tactical advantage”); Lawson,
683 F.2d at 694 (delay not “engineered by the government for an improper purpose, such as gaining
a tactical advantage”); Snyder, 668 F.2d at 689; United States v. Watson, 599 F.2d 1149, 1156 n.5
(2d Cir. 1979); United States v. Tanu, 589 F.2d 82, 89 (2d Cir. 1978); United States v. Laurenti,
581 F.2d 37, 40 n.11 (2d Cir. 1978); United States v. Hillegas, 578 F.2d 453, 460 (2d Cir. 1978).

4. Discussion

Because the defendant has failed to establish prejudice, the Court need not address the
defendant’s specious arguments that the Government’s purpose in any alleged pre-indictment
delay was improper or designed to gain any sort of tactical advantage. See Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL
4043140, at *5. In any event, in denying the defendant’s pre-trial motions and supplemental pre-
trial motions, the Court noted the absence of “evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing
these charges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense.” (Dkt. No. 207 at
17; Dkt. No. 317 at 10). That remains true.
