(Weinstcin's Federal Evidence § 613.04[1.] (2d:ed. 2001.)). To be ‘sure, every time Jane: denied
making.a statement but agreed the 3500 material reflected the statement; she denied its. substance
to the jury; the prior statement is therefore provable by extrinsic: evidence because Jane’s trial,
‘testimony=I did not make the prior statement, or I don’t remember making the ‘prior statement;
the FBI agent made a typo—would Icad to a:rclevant conclusion different from any. other
relevant conclusion:resulting: from. anything the witness said. See id..And.-referring Jane to the
3500 material, which. was not: admitted into evidence, is not’ sufficient to protect Ms. Maxwell’s
right:under Rule: 613 to prove the statement. by-extrinsic evidence.

Extrinsic evidence is. disallowed only when'the witness admits making the, prior
inconsistent statement. Witited States v. Jones, 578 F.2d 1332, 1340 (10th Cir. 1978) (“The
principle is that-where itis sought to impeach, a witness by showing:a prior inconsistent
statement: and the witness, admits the prior inconsistent statement, the witness is thereby:
impeached and.further. testimony: is not:necessary.”). Where:the witness admits the 3500:material,
contains the statement, but-denies making the statement or remembering making the statement,
the Witness has not “admitted. the statement” within the meaning of Rule 613. Cf id.

Due to the:press of time, Ms. Maxwells counsel was not. able to indicate: cach. disputed

prior inconsistent statement that was read ‘into’the record by the deadline of 10:15 p:m.
