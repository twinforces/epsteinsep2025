(Weinstein's Federal Evidence § 613.04[1] (2d ed. 2001)). To be sure, every time Jane denied
making a statement but agreed the 3500 material reflected the statement, she denied its substance
to the jury; the prior statement is therefore provable by extrinsic evidence because Jane’s trial
testimony—I did not make the prior statement, or I don’t remember making the prior statement,
the FBI agent made a typo—would lead to a relevant conclusion different from any other
relevant conclusion resulting from anything the witness said. See id. And referring Jane to the
3500 material, which was not admitted into evidence, is not sufficient to protect Ms. Maxwell’s
right under Rule 613 to prove the statement by extrinsic evidence.

Extrinsic evidence is disallowed only when the witness admits making the prior
inconsistent statement. United States v. Jones, 578 F.2d 1332, 1340 (10th Cir. 1978) (“The
principle is that where it is sought to impeach a witness by showing a prior inconsistent
statement and the witness admits the prior inconsistent statement, the witness is thereby
impeached and further testimony is not necessary.”). Where the witness admits the 3500 material
contains the statement, but denies making the statement or remembering making the statement,
the witness has not “admitted the statement” within the meaning of Rule 613. Cf id.

Due to the press of time, Ms. Maxwell’s counsel was not able to indicate each disputed
prior inconsistent statement that was read into the record by the deadline of 10:15 p.m.
