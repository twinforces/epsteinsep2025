1 evidence admitted at trial. In determining what evidence you

2 accept, you must make your own evaluation from the testimony of
3 each of the witnesses and the exhibits that are received in

4 evidence. It is essential, however, that you keep an open mind
5 until you've heard all of the evidence in the case. A case can
6 be presented only step by step, witness by witness, before all
7 evidence is before you.

8 As you know from your experience, you can hear one

9 person give his or her version of an event and think it sounds
10 very imoressive or even compelling; and yet, upon hearing

11 another person's version of the same event or even the same

12 person cross-examined with respect to the event, things may

13 seem very different. In other words, there may be another side
14 to any witness's story.

15 You should use your common sense and good judgment to
16 evaluate each witness's testimony based on all of the

17 circumstances. Again, I can't emphasize too strongly that you
18 must keep an open mind until the trial is over. You should not
19 reach any conclusion until you have all of the evidence before
20 you.
21 As I mentioned during jury selection, this case has
22 received and will continue to receive significant attention in
23 the media. To protect their privacy, I have permitted
24 witnesses, if they choose, to be referred to in open court by
25 either their first name or a pseudonym. The full names of the
