In re: Ghislaine Maxwell, Statement for Consideration by “Kate”

| began writing this statement on Mother's day, because, it has been my experience, that it was.
only in becoming: a mother, to a daughter, that: gave me the courage arid impetus! to speak out
about: the abuse | had suffered and made me: understand the gravity and horror of what had
taken place.

It was, in fact, when my daughter was about 11, or 2,, that;| reached out to attorney Brad Edwards
and began to.'tell him the full extent of the heinous manipulation and abuse, instigated and
perpetuated by Ghislaine Maxwell. From the very: first conversation, | was emphatic that
Ghislaine was the true enabler and facilitator of my abuse.

It has been proven to: be true for me (and fer many survivors, of this kind of grooming and
insidious abuse with whom | have spoken), that the experience of looking at my own baby girl
and imagining her falling victim to such ‘atrocities, awakened compassion in me for myself as a
young girl and for the many, many others who suffered because of Ghislaine Maxwell. It'was this
experiéncé that fueled a'call'to action.

It was the very skilled grooming, perpetrated on me, intentionally:and consistently, that instilled
in me, the belief that | could not say no to Ghislaine Maxwell, or Epstein.

| witnessed on numerous occasions, over many years, Ghislaine. Maxwell trying to recruit other
girls and making consistent and insistent demands on me and others, to:do the same.

| witnessed her relentless and insatiable drive to méet the sexual needs of Epstein, at'any cost to
the vulnerable girls and women, upon whom she preyed and fed to Epstein and other powerful
men, to whom she wished to ingratiate herself.

There was never any ambiguity or doubt about her having full knowledge of what was to take
place once she recruited girls.

The many acts that were perpetrated on me by Epstein, including) sexual
assault, were never consensual, and would have never occurred, had it not been for the cunning
and premeditated role Ghislaine Maxwell played:

She repeatedly reinforced rewards for acquiescerice and consequences for disobedience.
Being around her was. like. being spun really fast in a circle and then trying to maintain balance. It

was like'a roller coaster ride, designed to disorient and disempower me'as.a vulnerable, young
girl, for the sole purpose of providing me to Epstein for sexual abuse.

The best ‘way to imprison.someone, is to make them create the prison bars in their own mind,.to
instill enough fear to make sure they never risk.leaving or-disobeying and make the bars invisible
to éveryoneé, so that ho. Gne can see their cage, of heartheir silent Screams.
