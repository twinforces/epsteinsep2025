Finally, for all the reasons given in the new trial motion and the letters about sealing, Ms.
Maxwell maintains that Juror No. 50 should not be provided a copy of the questionnaire, which

investigate Ms. Maxwell’s claim, Juror No. 50’s request for the questionnaire now pales in

has the luxury of a double standard. If a juror had falsely answered material voir dire questions
to favor Ms. Maxwell, the government would not hesitate to prosecute the juror for contempt or

the government invokes words like “finality” and “disfavor” and sighs, “well, no trial is perfect.”
