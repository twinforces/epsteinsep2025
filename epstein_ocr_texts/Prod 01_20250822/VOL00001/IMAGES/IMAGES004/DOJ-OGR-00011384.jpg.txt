Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The parties respectfully submit this joint letter in response to the Court’s email earlier
today regarding prospective jurors that the Court proposes to strike from the list of jurors
proceeding to voir dire.

1. The Parties’ Positions Regarding the Court’s List

The parties have conferred about the Court’s proposed list of strikes. The government has
no objection to the Court’s proposal to strike all jurors on the list.

The defense largely agrees with the Court’s proposal, but requests that a limited number of
jurors on the list proceed to voir dire so that the Court can inquire further about the nature of any
travel or hardship conflict that these jurors have identified.

More specifically, the defense agrees that the following jurors should be excused from voir
dire:

23, 114, 215, 257, 338, 420, 422, 542, 561
2051282.1
DOJ-OGR-00011384
