10 remember hearing anything else about Ms. Maxwell?

11 JUROR: Nothing.

12 THE COURT: The question is -- it's an important

13 question -- can you put aside anything that you have read or

14 heard about Ms. Maxwell and decide the case based on the facts
15 and evidence, or lack of evidence, here presented in court?

16 JUROR: Absolutely.

17 THE COURT: And follow my instructions as to the law?
18 JUROR: Yes.

19 THE COURT: In your questionnaire, you indicated
20 before the questionnaire you had heard about Mr. Epstein. What

22 described, do you recall anything that you heard about Mr.
23 Epstein?
24 JUROR: Not really. I don't really have cable, so
25 it's very rare that I even see anything.
