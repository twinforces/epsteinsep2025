and, woman were predators. What Jane didn't understand then or
what you will learn at this trial was that this meeting was the
beginning of that man and woman targéting Jane for séxual. abuse

that would last for years.

Jané was, not their only wictim. There were other
young girls, teenagers whe the man. and woman targeted for
sextial abuse. Who was that woman ‘targeting young girls for
sexual abuse? It was. the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell.

The défendant took these girls on, Shopping trips,
asked them about their lives, their schools, their families.
She won théir trust. She discussed séxudl topics with them.
She helped normalize abusive sexual conduct. She put them at.
ease and made them feel safe all so that they could be molested
by a middle-aged man.

She knew whdt waS going to happen to those girls. The

defendant. walked the girls into a moom where she knew that man,

would molést them, and there were times when she was in the

room when it happened, making it all feel. mormal and casual.

That. is why we are here today, because between 1994
and, 2.004, the defendant sexually exploited young girls. She
preyéd on vulnérable young girls, manipulated them, and served
them up to. be sexually abused. The defendant. was ‘trafficking
kids for sex. That iS what this trial is all about.

government.'s opportunity to give you a roadmap of the evidence
