a devoted stepmother to her husband’s two youngsters, who were ages three and four and a half at
the start of the relationship. Sadly, the marriage could not survive the negative impact of this case

Ms. Maxwell has always worked hard. Her many educational, occupational, and
avocational accomplishments include becoming an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT), a
helicopter pilot, a submersible pilot, a banker; partnering with the Cleveland Clinic to establish a
telemedicine platform to enable people in remote areas to obtain quality medical treatment; helping
develop the Clinton Global Initiative; and supporting a variety non-profit and charitable
organizations. In 2012, at age 50, she turned a lifelong passion for the oceans into a non-profit
environmental organization, The TerraMar Project, with the mission of creating a "global ocean
community" based on the idea of shared ownership and responsibility of the global “commons”
(the high seas and international waters). She spoke on topics related to ocean conservation, giving
TED Talks, and delivering a speech at the United Nations. National Geographic and Oxford
University were among the organizations that collaborated in support of the project. The TerraMar
Project was closed after Epstein’s death to spare her partners from invasion of privacy by the press
due their association with her. See PSR 178.

a villain, rich heiress, and vapid socialite. See Exhibits A -I.

Her eldest siblings, Anne Halve, a psychotherapist, and Philip Maxwell, recount the
impact of their father:
