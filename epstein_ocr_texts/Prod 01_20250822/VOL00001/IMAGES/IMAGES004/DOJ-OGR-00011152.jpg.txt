63. These out of court statements would be hearsay if admitted for their truth, and so are
presumptively inadmissible at trial. Fed. R. Evid. 802. The Defense identifies several means by
which it may admit these hearsay statements. Def. Br. at 14-17.

First, “[u]nder Rule 703, experts can testify to opinions based on inadmissible evidence,
including hearsay, if ‘experts in the field reasonably rely on such evidence in forming their
opinions.’” United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d 179, 197 (2d Cir. 2008). But Rule 703 does not
permit an expert to “simply transmit that hearsay to the jury.” /d. Rather, those underlying facts
and data that would otherwise be inadmissible may be disclosed to the jury “if their probative
value in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.”
Fed. R. Evid. 703. Here, the hearsay underlying Dr. Hall’s diagnoses, including
PY would have little probative value unless the
Government were to challenge the accuracy of Dr. Hall’s diagnoses. See United States v. Chai,
No. 13-CR-290 (PAC), 2015 WL 293995, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 22, 2015). The Government
represents in its brief that it would not do so in the event that Dr. Hall’s diagnoses are admitted.
Gov’t Br. at 13. And admitting the underlying hearsay, without a relevant need to substantiate
the accuracy of Dr. Hall’s conclusions, would result in significant prejudice, including confusing
the jury and delaying the trial with a large volume of unnecessary details. The Court therefore
concludes that, based on the parties’ current proffers, the facts and data underlying Dr. Hall’s
opinions are not admissible via Rule 703.

Second, the Defense says that Alleged Victim 4’s statements are admissible under one of
two hearsay exceptions in Rule 803. Def. Br. at 15. It says the statements were statements of
her “then-existing state of mind . . . or emotional, sensory, or physical condition.” Fed. R. Evid.
803(3). But while a number of Alleged Victim 4’s statements to Dr. Hall may pertain to motives
