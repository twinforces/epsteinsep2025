63. These out of court statements would. be hearsay’ if admittcd.for their truth, and. so are
‘presumptively inadmissible at trial. Fed. R. Evid.'802. The Defense: identifies séveral means by
which it may:admit these: hearsay statements. Def. Br. at 14-7.

First, “[u]nder Rule: 703, experts can testify to opinions based, on inadmissible cyidenec,,
including hearsay, if*experts,in the ficld reasonably rely on such evidence. in forming their
opinions.” United States v. Mejia, 545 F.3d 179, 197 (2d Cir. 2008). ‘But Rule’703 does not
permit an, cxpert:to “simply transmit:that.hearsay to the jury!” /d. Rather; those underlying facts,
and data that‘would otherwise be inadmissible may be disclosed to the jury “if their probative

represents in, its brief that it would.not do so in,the event that: Dr. Hall’s diagnoses are:admitted.
Gov’t Br. at.13. And admitting the underlying hearsay, without .a‘relevant nced ‘to, substantiate
the accuracy: of Dr. Hall’s conclusions, would result in significant prejudice, including confusing
the jury and. delaying the trial-with a. large: volume of unnecessary details. The Court therefore
concludes that, based on the parties’ current:proffers, the facts and. data’underlying Dr. Hall’s
‘opinions are not admissible via-Rule 703.

Second, the Defense says that Alleged Victim 4’s statements .are:admissible under onc of
two hearsay exceptions in.Rule 803. Def. Br. at 15. It says'the, statements, were statements of
her “then-existing state of:mind ... . or emotional, sensory, or physical,condition.” Fed. R. Evid.

803(3). But while a number of Alleged Victim, 4’s statements, to Dr: Hall may:pertain to motives
