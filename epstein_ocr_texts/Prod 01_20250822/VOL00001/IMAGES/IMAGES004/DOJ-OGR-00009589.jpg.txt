offense charged in another count.” United States v. Rigas, 281 F. Supp. 2d 660, 666 (S.D.N.Y.
2003) (citing Chacko, 169 F.3d at 146). With respect to conspiracy counts, if the two counts
charge distinct conspiracies, “there is no double jeopardy problem regardless of an overt act or
other evidentiary overlap.” Estrada, 320 F.3d at 180. In the Second Circuit, courts apply the
factors set forth in United States v. Korfant to determine whether two conspiracy counts are
distinct. /d. at 180-81 (citing United States v. Korfant, 771 F.2d 660, 662 (2d Cir. 1985)). The
factors include “the criminal offenses charged, overlap of participants, overlap of time, similarity
of operation, common overt acts, geographic scope, common objectives, and degree of
interdependence.” United States v. Guzman, 7 F. App’x 45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2001) (citing Korfant,
771 F.2d at 662); Estrada, 320 F.3d at 181.

When applying the Korfant factors, the Second Circuit has emphasized that “‘no dominant
factor or single touchstone determines whether’ the compared conspiracies are in law and fact the
same.” Jd. (quoting United States v. Macchia, 35 F.3d 662, 668 (2d Cir. 1994)). Moreover, “[alt
a certain level of generality,’ the fact that two conspiracies ‘overlap with respect to a number of
characteristics, including time frame, geographic locale, participants, and criminal objective’ does
not negate the existence of two conspiracies if ‘[t]here exist sufficient distinctions between the
schemes charged.” Guzman, 7 F. App’x at 55 (quoting Macchia, 35 F.3d at 668).

B. Discussion

Counts Three and Five charged different offenses. The Court should reject the defendant’s

multiplicity claim and enter judgment on Counts Three and Five.
