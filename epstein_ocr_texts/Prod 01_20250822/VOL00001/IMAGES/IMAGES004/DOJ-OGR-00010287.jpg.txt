overt. acts alleged.in Count Five could casily have been alleged in Count. Three because they
were in furtherance of the same conspiracy. Hence, the differing overt.acts do not indicate:
different conspiracies. See Calderone, 982 F.2d.at:48 (finding two conspiracies were
multiplicitous even though twenty-one overt acts listed inthe second. conspiracy were, not; listed.
in:the first, because they*were “all in/furthcrance of the broader conspiracy alleged in:the first”).

D. _—_ Similarity of Operation, Common Objectives, and ‘Degree of
Interdependence

Finally, the government argucs that Counts Three and Five. were different conspiracies
because they were “fundamentally independent schemes, with different objectives and.modes of
operation.” (Opp..at 32). In doing so, the government convenicntly ignores the argument it-
made tothe jury at-trial — namely, that. Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annic Farmer were all victims of
the same criminal plan.to sexually. exploit underaged girls, which Epstein and, Ms. Maxwell
carried out using the. same methods throughout the entire course ofthe conspiracy. (Tr. 2848),
(“[Maxwell] ran.the same playbook over and ‘over and. over again as she exploited young girls.
The similarities, between what happened.:to Jane and Annie and-Carolyn and, Kate are incredibly
powerful cvidenec of the defendant’s guilt.”).

The government attempts to: side-step this obvious inconsistency by: arguing thatthe
conspiracy charged in.Count: Three involved “groom[ing] [victims] to travel to Epstcin’s
properties for sexual abuse,” whereas Count Five involved “paying:victims for-so-called
‘massage appointments,’ where they were’ sexually exploited.” (Opp. at 32). But.“grooming”
and travel were not. exclusive to Count Threc. Carolyn testified about being progressively
introduced.to more scrious sexual situations, which was a form of “grooming. (Tr. 1'521-23,
1537). She also testified, that Epstein and’Ms. Maxwell asked her to travel to his island. (Tr:

1534-35). Similarly, payment and massages were not.cxclusive to, Count Five. Janc testified
