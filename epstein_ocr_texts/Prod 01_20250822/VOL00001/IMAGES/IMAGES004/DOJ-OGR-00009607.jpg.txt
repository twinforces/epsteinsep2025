B. The Defendant Has Failed to Establish that the Government Delayed the Indictment
for an Improper Purpose
3. Applicable Law

If, and only if, a defendant has established significant, actual prejudice does the inquiry
turn to the reason for the delay. See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL 4043140, at *5 (“Because
Defendant failed to show prejudice, the Court need not even address the second prong[.]”’). The
reason for delay violates due process only if it is so extreme that it departs from fundamental
notions of “fair play.” United States v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783, 795 (1977). The Supreme Court
has “defined the category of infractions that violate ‘fundamental fairness’ very narrowly,”
Dowling v. United States, 493 U.S. 342, 352 (1990), and the Supreme Court has “stressed the
importance for constitutional purposes of good or bad faith on the part of the Government when
the claim is based on loss of evidence attributable to the Government,” Arizona v. Youngblood,
488 U.S. 51, 57 (1988).

The Second Circuit has clearly held that a defendant seeking the dismissal of an indictment
filed within the statute of limitations must establish that the Government acted intentionally,
deliberately, or with some strategy, and that the Government used that delay to gain a tactical
advantage over the defendant. See, e.g., Cornielle, 171 F.3d at 752 (delay must be an “intentional
device to gain [a] tactical advantage over the accused” (quoting Marion, 404 U.S. at 324)); see
also United States v. Alameh, 341 F.3d 167, 176 (2d Cir. 2003) (“To show unjustifiable conduct,
a defendant must demonstrate that the government has intentionally used delay to gain unfair
tactical advantage.”); United States v. Delacruz, 970 F. Supp. 2d 199, 203 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (“[The
defendant’s] motion to dismiss would nevertheless fail for the independent reason that he has not
