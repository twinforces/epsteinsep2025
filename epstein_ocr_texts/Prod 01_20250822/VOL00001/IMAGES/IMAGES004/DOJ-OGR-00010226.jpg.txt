1 going to ask you to turn to question 49. It's on page 25.

2 Question 49 reads: Have you or a friend or family

3 member ever been accused of sexual harassment, sexual abuse or
4 sexual assault, and then in parenthesis: This includes both

5 formal accusations in a court or law or informal accusations in
6 a social or work setting of actual or attempted sexual assault
7 or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,

8 acquaintance, supervisor, teacher or family member.

9 When you filled this out on November 4, you checked

10 no. Is that an accurate answer?

11 A. Yes, your Honor.

12 Q. So the incident that you described in response to 48 in

13 which, as I understand it, you informed your mother when you

14 were in high school that when you were nine or ten a family

15 member had engaged in sexual abuse with you, is that correct?
16 A. YS,

17 Q. So why is that not responsive to question 49?

18 A. Because I don't consider them part of my family. I never
19 considered them part of my family even when they lived with us
20 for a few years.
21 Q. And when you filled out the questionnaire, when you got to
22 this question were you thinking about what happened to you but
23 you didn't respond yes because you didn't consider them a
24 family member, or you didn't consider it?
25 A. I didn't even consider it at all.
