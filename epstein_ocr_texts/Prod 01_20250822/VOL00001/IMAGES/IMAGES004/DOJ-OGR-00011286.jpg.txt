‘surrounding the statement during the trial.and cvaluate admissibility prior to.any attempt by the
government'to introduce the statémient. The. government should be instructed that it caniot
discuss the alleged. statement in its opening remarks.

Similarly, the second .cxample concerns direction, from.Epstcin, and‘€C-2 to CC-1 to
“help someone who was:coming to take the computers...” Again, this statement ‘does not appear.
to’be during or in furtherance of any conspiracy alleged. in the indictment. See-Luiwak v. United
States, 344 US. 604 (1953); Knilewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440 (1949). The government
now seems to concede this point, falling back: on.the:time honored “effect.on. the listener” and
therefore not offered:for the truth ofthe mattcr:cxecption to'the hearsay‘rule. ‘The'problem with.
the government’s position, However, is that the statement’ and subsequent. actions. are not:relevant
to.any material issuc inthis :case. The apparent: point of the proffered evidence is to.demonstrate
‘that, in 2005, Epstein was extracting his computers in. advanec of the search and. thus, may have
had some guilty. knowledge. Ms. Maxwell is: not :charged’with tampering or obstruction and
Epstein’s motives for allegedly directing CC-1 to do something ‘with his computers is not
‘relevant to Whether: Ms. Maxwell. conspired’to do, the things alleged, in the indictment. Again, any
probative value associated:with this action is substantially outweighed by the prejudice to.Ms.
Maxwell who was:not present, did not participate, and,had no knowledge of. cither the: statement

or. the acts.
