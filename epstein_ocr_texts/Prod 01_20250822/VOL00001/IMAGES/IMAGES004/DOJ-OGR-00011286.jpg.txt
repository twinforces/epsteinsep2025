surrounding the statement during the trial and evaluate admissibility prior to any attempt by the
government to introduce the statement. The government should be instructed that it cannot
discuss the alleged statement in its opening remarks.

Similarly, the second example concerns direction from Epstein and CC-2 to CC-1 to
“help someone who was coming to take the computers....” Again, this statement does not appear
to be during or in furtherance of any conspiracy alleged in the indictment. See Lutwak v. United
States, 344 U.S. 604 (1953); Krulewitch v. United States, 336 U.S. 440 (1949). The government
now seems to concede this point, falling back on the time honored “effect on the listener” and
therefore not offered for the truth of the matter exception to the hearsay rule. The problem with
the government’s position, however, is that the statement and subsequent actions are not relevant
to any material issue in this case. The apparent point of the proffered evidence is to demonstrate
that, in 2005, Epstein was extracting his computers in advance of the search and thus may have
had some guilty knowledge. Ms. Maxwell is not charged with tampering or obstruction and
Epstein’s motives for allegedly directing CC-1 to do something with his computers is not
relevant to whether Ms. Maxwell conspired to do the things alleged in the indictment. Again, any
probative value associated with this action is substantially outweighed by the prejudice to Ms.
Maxwell who was not present, did not participate, and had no knowledge of either the statement
or the acts.
