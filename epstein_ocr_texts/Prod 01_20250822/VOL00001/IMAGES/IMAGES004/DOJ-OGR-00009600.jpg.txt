Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL 4043 140, at.*4-5. (death of a defensewitness.and defendant’s own memory
issues insufficient, prejudice):

2. Discussion

The defendant contends, that she: has suffered substantial prejudice due ‘to the, death, of
certain witnesses and the unavailability of certain:documentary:records. (Def. Mot. at'25-30). The
defendant’s speculative: claims ‘fail to establish substantial and actual prejudice caused. by the:
allegedly excessive pre-indictment: delay. See Birney, 686 F.2d at: 105-06.

The defendant claims she has suffered ‘substantial prejudice as a result of pre-indictment
delay. duc to the unavailability of (1) Alberto Pinto and Roger Salhi, architects who worked for
Epstein; (2); Sally Markham, “a-property. manager hired to help run Epstein’s properties:in the:carly
2000s”; and.(3) Lynn.Fontanilla,'the live-in.housekeeper in Epstein’s New Y ork townhouse. (Def.
Mot. at 29-30).° The defendant’s speculative claims of prejudice do not'withstand,scrutiny. First,
the fact that'certain.deceased witnesses. cannottestify docs:not compel.a:finding of actual prejudice.

defendant must.demonstrate a:substantial, actual prejudice tohis ability’to defend himself.” United

” The defendant also reasserts that the witnesses “already mentioned. in [her] previous filings” —
namcly, Jeffrey Epstcin, Epstcin’s mother, Michacl,.Cascy (the alleged agent. of Minor Victim-1),
and Palm. Beach Police ‘Department; Detective Joseph. Recarey—“could have provided evidence
contradicting the government’s. proof?” (Def. Mot. at 29). The Court already rejected the
defendant’s claims-of actual prejudice as to;these witnesses, finding that the defendant “provide[d]
no indication of what:many of these potential witnesses might have testificd:to” and noting “serious
doubts under all ofthe relevant cireumstances that a jury’would.have found testimony from_Epstein,
eredible even if he had waived his. right ‘against. scl f+inerimination, and, testified on her behalf.”
(Dkt.-No. 207 at 18). ‘The defendant:-offers no, new: arguments as,to, these witnesses, and her claims
certainly fare. no better after the. trial in this matter.
