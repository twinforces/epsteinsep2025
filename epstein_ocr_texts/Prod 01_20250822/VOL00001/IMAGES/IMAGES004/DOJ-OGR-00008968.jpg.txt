here, the misstatement concerned, an. issue so central that. it is likely the juror, had, he answered
accurately, would have been. ‘disqualified for cause ‘or disqualified through a peremptory
challenge. And thé impact to a fair trial ‘from the scatinig of such a.juror is ¢ven more'threatened
when the issue hidden by:a'potential juror‘is,'as some reports have indicated, ‘raised by that person
during deliberations. ‘Requiring ‘proof of willfulness would make the post-trial inquiry too
subjective and thereby dilute the obligation to be accurate in the first place. Such.a:rule could tip
the balance in.dcécisions by favoring ‘findings that would avoid’the expense and inconvenience of

which we: believe will. lead. this ‘Court to conclude ‘that:a finding of willfulness: should :not be
required.

‘evidence and:opinions that tended to incriminate the defendant:and that ongoing publicity during
the trial had revealed matters discussed. outside the presence of the jury, the: defendant was
entitled to a new: trial as a result. of the “inherently ‘prejudicial publicity which saturated the
community....”); Jrvin v. Dowd, 366 U.S. 717, 728 (1961) (finding where there-was continued
adverse publicity fostering, a ‘strong prejudice against defendant who had.allegedly confessed,to
six murders. in a small,.arca, which caused, two-thirds of the jury to admit before hearing any

testimony to possessing a, belicfin. his guilt, that defendant must be retried). These are the cases
