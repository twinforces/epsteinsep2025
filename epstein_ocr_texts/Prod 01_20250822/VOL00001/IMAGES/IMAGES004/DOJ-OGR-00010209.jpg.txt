the.Calphalon company:to.Newell, :Parse was introduced to Peter Barnhart, Calphalon’s Executive
Vice-President; SaraJane Kaspetzak, Dean Kasperzak, and other:members-of the K asperzak-family’
in.1998. Asa result of'the work that Parse was doing in:helping the Calphalon.stockholders dispose
of their Newell shares, Parse became. aware: of the large taxable gains that the stockholders would,
receive. In:a meeting at Parse’s office, Parse introduced Peter Barnhart-to Paul/Daugerdas (then an
Altheimer & Gray partner) ‘for the purpose of having Daugerdas pitch a J&G tax. shelter to the
Calphalon ssharcholdets.. Parsé subsequently attendéd a mécting with Daugerdas, the Calphalon
shareholders, and several attorneys ‘ftom ihe law firm. of Shumaker Loop & ‘Kendrick. In’ that
mecting and.in Parse’s presence, as Dean: Kasperzak testified at trial, Daugerdas opened, with the ted-
flag statement thatthe information thathe was:about to provide:wasicompletely:confidential.and that.
the shareholders ‘could not even, share it. with, the sharcholdeis’ own investment advisors or!
accountants. (Tr. 6243). Daugerdas then described ‘the'tax:shelter which he-said-would resultin.the
shareholders’ paying'virtually:no:taxes on the gains,:Kasperzak further testified, “We were told that:
the: profit potential was'very low-and that going forward, Should.we choosé'to go forward, if wewere
questioned about the matter, that our intent. was in fact to make a profit, but in order for this: tax
shelterto’work, there had.to be, in effect, 'a loss to balanee off the gains {fromthe stock sale.’ ” (Tr.
6244), Theurging by Daugerdas forthe sharcholders to.make false statements about:their intent.is

wholly‘inconsistent with, good ‘faith —all.of which Parse’ witnessed.,

* The'testimony’of Erwin:Mayer‘and.other trial.witnesses made‘clear that the expected short-
term duration of the Treasury-note:transactions, combined withthe lack: of'volatility-of the-specific:
Treastity notes:chosen.for the transactions,-meant thatthe Shoit sale was vittually certain. produce
‘only:a.small loss. or gain on this’purported “investment.”
