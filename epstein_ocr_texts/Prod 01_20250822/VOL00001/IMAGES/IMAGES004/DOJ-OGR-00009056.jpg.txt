Il. The scope of any evidentiary hearing

Ms..Maxwell.does not believe an evidentiary hearing is required because the
undisputed. evidence shows, (1) that Juror No. 50 falsely answered a material question
during voir dire and (2) that, had he answered truthfully, he would have been, subject to a
challenge for cause. If this Court.disagrees, however, a formal evidentiary hearing is
appropriate.

When, as here, there is a plausible claim. of;juror misconduct, “an. unflagging duty
falls to'the district court:to investigate the claim.” United States v.1-rench, 904 F.3d 11.1,
117 (st Cir. 2018) (quotation omitted). “[A] ‘formal evidentiary hearing [is] the gold
standard for.an inquiry into alleged juror misconduct.” United States v. Ikrench, 977 F.3d
114, 122 (1st Cir. 2020), cert. denied, 141, S, Ct. 2601 (2021), cert. denied sub nom,
Russell'y. United States, 141 S. Ct. 2601 (2021),

A. Pre-hearing discovery
Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court authorize subpoenas to:
l. Juror No. 50 to produce:
a. Emails or other'written communications between Juror No. 50 and any
alleged victim orWitness in. this case;
b. Emails or other written. communications between Juror No. 50.and ‘any

other juror in this casc;.
