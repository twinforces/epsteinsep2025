insufficient basis for an evidentiary hearing, especially one that, according to the Defendant,
would require the Court to “haul [11] jurors in after they have reached a verdict” to probe for
who, if anyone, may have been mentioned in the article. Guzman Loera, 24 F.4th at 161
(quoting Moon, 718 F.2d at 1234).

Second, Federal Rule of Evidence 606 bars the Court from considering Juror 50’s
statements as evidence of another juror’s statements purportedly made during deliberations. As
previously quoted, the rule states:

During an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not

made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.” Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(2). In addition to these
exceptions enumerated in the rule, the Supreme Court has held that Rule 606 “give[s] way”
where “a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on racial stereotypes or
animus to convict a criminal defendant.” Pena-Rodriguez v. Colorado, 137 S. Ct. 855, 863
(2017). Absent one of these circumstances, evidence within the ambit of Rule 606 may not be
considered.

Here, the Defendant relies on Juror 50’s statements of what another juror allegedly stated
during deliberations. That proffer is barred by Rule 606.

In response, the Defendant argues that Juror 50’s statements about the second juror fall
outside the scope of Rule 606 because she “does not seek to impeach the verdict based on the
