was still the lady of the house, supervising other staff, (GX 606), and flight records make clear that
the defendant and Kellen flew together on Epstein’s private planes approximately thirty-nine times
in 2003 and approximately ten times in 2004, confirming their continued overlap, (GX 662).

The combination of this evidence demonstrates that Kellen joined the conspiracy when
Maxwell was still second in command under Epstein. Given Maxwell’s role in the household and
in the conspiracy, she certainly exercised authority over Kellen. The clear inference from this
record is that Maxwell instructed Kellen regarding how to schedule massages and run the part of
the scheme that Maxwell had previously handled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls
to schedule appointments following Maxwell’s directions. Thus, even if the defense were correct
that the defendant needed to supervise a knowing participant in the scheme for the leadership
enhancement to apply, the record amply supports the conclusion that Maxwell did so with respect
to Kellen.

Given the breadth of the defendant’s criminal scheme, spanning multiple continents,
abusing multiple victims, and employing numerous underlings to accomplish the conspiracy’s goal
over the course of multiple years, the defendant clearly warrants the enhancement under U.S.S.G.
§ 3B1.1 contemplated by the PSR.

C. The Two-Point “Undue Influence” Enhancement Applies

Pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2G1.3(b)(2)(B), two levels are added if “a participant . . . unduly
influenced a minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct.” This enhancement applies where “a
participant’s influence over the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor’s behavior.”
Id. app. n.3(B). Where, as here, “a participant is at least 10 years older than the minor,” the
Guidelines provide for “a rebuttable presumption . . . that such participant unduly influenced the
minor to engage in prohibited sexual conduct. In such a case, some degree of undue influence can
