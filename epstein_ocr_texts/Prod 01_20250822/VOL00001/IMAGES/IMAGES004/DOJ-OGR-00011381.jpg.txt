ORDER.
Defendant.

ALISON J. NATHAN, Circuit Judge, sitting by designation:

The Court is. in receipt of the:partics’ proposed.redactions to motions that were not
previously docketed: See Dkt..No..698. With one exception, the Court concludes ‘that;the
proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect information subjcct'to Fed..R. Evid. 412. and
the privacy interests of witnesses, including individuals:subjcet to the Court’s'pscudonym order,
and. individuals who were anticipated to be called. as witnesses, at trial, but*were not ultimately:
called. See Lugosch v.. Pyramid. Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d.1.10 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court will.
file unredacted copies of all items under seal.

The Court coricludes, however, thatthe: proposed redactions'to Dkt. No. 725 are not
narrowly tailored. The private information of vietim-witnesses who are discussed. in the letter
may be protected. by narrow redactions: However, there ‘is no basis to redact the Ictter’s general
request to identify the proper scope of cfoss-cxamination.. Accordingly, the Defendant is
ORDERED to.confer with. the Government and.dockct:proposed revised.redactions on. or before
12:00 p:m.,on Friday, July 15, 2022. The Ictter:at- Dkt. No. 725 was filed. under'temporary seal
at Dkt. No. 71.2. Because the Court concludes that.scaling, in not justified, the Clerk of Court. is

respectfully directed to strike the entry at’Dkt. No. 712. fromthe: docket.
