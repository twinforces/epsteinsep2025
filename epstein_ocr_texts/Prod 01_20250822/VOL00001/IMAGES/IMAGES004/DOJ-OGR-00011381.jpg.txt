UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DOCUMENT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ELECTRONICALLY FILED |

United States of America,

_y—
20-CR-330 (AJN)
Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.

ALISON J. NATHAN, Circuit Judge, sitting by designation:

The Court is in receipt of the parties’ proposed redactions to motions that were not
previously docketed. See Dkt. No. 698. With one exception, the Court concludes that the
proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect information subject to Fed. R. Evid. 412 and
the privacy interests of witnesses, including individuals subject to the Court’s pseudonym order,
and individuals who were anticipated to be called as witnesses at trial, but were not ultimately
called. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court will
file unredacted copies of all ttems under seal.

The Court concludes, however, that the proposed redactions to Dkt. No. 725 are not
narrowly tailored. The private information of victim-witnesses who are discussed in the letter
may be protected by narrow redactions. However, there is no basis to redact the letter’s general
request to identify the proper scope of cross-examination. Accordingly, the Defendant is
ORDERED to confer with the Government and docket proposed revised redactions on or before
12:00 p.m. on Friday, July 15, 2022. The letter at Dkt. No. 725 was filed under temporary seal
at Dkt. No. 712. Because the Court concludes that sealing in not justified, the Clerk of Court is
respectfully directed to strike the entry at Dkt. No. 712 from the docket.
