48, and, if so, (2) whether the Court would have struck Juror 50 for cause if he had accurately
responded to that question, i.e., whether he was actually biased.

For the reasons set forth below, the Government submits that: (1) the Court should conduct
the questioning; (2) the questions for Juror 50 should be narrowly tailored; (3) there is no basis to
call any other jurors as witnesses; and (4) the defendant’s request for “pre-hearing discovery”
should be denied.

1. The Court Should Conduct the Questioning

First, as noted, given the dangers of harassment and embarrassment presented by juror
inquiries, the Court has the power and duty to closely control the proceedings. The Court can—
and courts in this District frequently do—choose to personally question the jurors, often giving the
parties an opportunity to propose to the Court questions for the Court to ask. See, e.g., Calbas,
821 F.2d at 896 (district court conducted examination of juror, and Second Circuit concluded that
the district court “wisely refrained from allowing the inquiry to become an adversarial evidentiary
hearing, so as to minimize intrusion on the jury’s deliberations”); Loliscio v. Goord, 263 F.3d 178,
191 (2d Cir. 2001) (“[T]he scope of such a post-verdict inquiry, and the extent, if any, to which
the parties may participate therein are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial court.’’);
Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. v. T&N, No. 87 Civ. 4436 (JGK), 1997 WL 221203, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.
Apr. 28, 1997) (“The Court examined Juror No. 5 under oath in the presence of counsel for both
parties, after both parties were given the opportunity to submit proposed questions. To protect the
juror from harassment or embarrassment, the Court personally conducted the questioning of the
juror.”); United States v. Shakur, 723 F. Supp. 925, 928 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (district court examined
juror in camera, after permitting counsel to file suggested questions), aff’d 888 F.2d 234 (2d Cir.
1989); United States v. Greer, 998 F. Supp. 399, 404 (D. Vt. 1998) (“All of the jurors were
