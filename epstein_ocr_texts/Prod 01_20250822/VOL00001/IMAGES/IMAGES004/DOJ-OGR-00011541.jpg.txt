To some extent, the government points, T think, to
pest conspiracy conduct, and that concerns me, And so IL would
like to ask you to draw my attention t6 what im the trial
record specifically speaks to November and December of 2004.

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

As a threshold. matter, the government's understanding

of the conspiracy. In. other words, if the conspirators are
taking actions periodically over time, the question is what is
the last date of the conspiracy? What does the trial evidence
éstablish about the final date? And here the trial éviderice
was that the conspiracy was ongoing through all of 2004 and
inte 2005.

THE COURT: But, to make that. point, I think you're
relying on post cénspiracy evidence.

MS. MOE: No, your Honer. We're mnelying on evidence:

THE COURT: It exceeds also the date of Carolyn's 18th
birthday. And So it's hot just what the indictment chargés ==

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

THE GOURT: == but by a Gohspiracy that is dependent.
here on Carnolyn being under 18 for its continuation. And so
that's why I see what you're pointing to as post Gonspirdcey,
not only because it goes past, what the indictment, charged, but
because I. think legally you're pointing to non-conspiracy
