Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this letter in response
to the Court’s Order, dated November 19, 2021, requesting that the parties submit any suggested
edits to the proposed limiting instructions set forth in the Order. (Dkt. No. 477). The defense does
not have any edits to the Court’s proposed instructions. However, the defense requests the
opportunity to respond to the government’s lengthy submission, either in writing or orally at the
final pretrial conference on November 23, 2021.

Sincerely,

/s/ Christian Everdell
