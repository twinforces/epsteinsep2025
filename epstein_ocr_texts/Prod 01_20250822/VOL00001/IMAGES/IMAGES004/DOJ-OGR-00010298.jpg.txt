Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document648  Filed:03/15/22 Page 8.of 16

“crime” did not, prompt-Juror 50 to disclose his experience of childhood sexual abuse, which was
not criminally prosecuted, on _his.questionnaire. Lay persons often may not think of themselves as
victims of a crime ‘even. where: lawyers:and, judges would. See;.e.g., Fell, 2014 WL:3697810, at.
*6-7,, *13 (crediting juror’s explanation that ‘she did not-disclose past sexual. abuse in response to
question about’ whether she had been a Victim of a.crime because she did not' consider'the, abuse,
for, which the abuser, was never prosecuted, a-crime). Juror 50-plainly’ stated that he “[a]bsolutely
[did] not” ‘‘[i]n any way: .. . intentionally ‘provide an. Inaccurate answer’ to Question 25; that he
did not answer'no to 'Question.25 to “make it more likely that [he] would be selected.for the jury”;
and that he did not try to tailor his answers about his history of sexual abuse to “make it more
likely that [he] would. be selected for the jury.” (Mar. 8, 2022 Tr. at.17:1-10):

The same is true regarding Question 49. After Juror 50 explained that he:had been.abused,
by a.stepbrother “whois no longer'a part of the ‘family” (7d. at 8514-15, 9:3-8), the Court directed,
Juror 50’s' attention to Question 49, which asked whethcr'he, a fricnd, or family member had ever
been, accused of'scxual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual, assault, Juror 50 initially stated that
his ‘negative answer to that question was accurate. The Court asked'why Juror: 50’s scxual abuse
by: a family: member did :not count, and Juror SO:responded.“[b]ecause I don’t consider them part.
of my family. I'never considered. them part of: my family even when they lived with, us for a. few
years.” (/d. at. 11212-20). Only. after the Court pressed Juror 50 and asked, him several. ‘pointed.
questions about:Question.49, did Juror. 50 realize that he should-have:answered. yes to that question.
“(b]ecause by law, by marriage, that-person. was [his] stepbrother:” (/d: at 1'3:5-6).

Juror 50’s testimony about Question, 49:.illustrates the point that a lay juror filling out'a
questionnaire cannot be held to the standard of.a-trained:lawyer conducting a close-cxamination of

a document. See McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555; Dyer, 151 F.3d at. 973. Juror: 50’s answer: to
