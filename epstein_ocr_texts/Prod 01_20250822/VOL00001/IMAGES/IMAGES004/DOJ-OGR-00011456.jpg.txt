C. The Critical Importance of Confidentiality to the EVCP and Similar Programs

Ms. Feldman’s declaration explains why confidentiality is so critical to programs like the
EVCP.”’ As she notes, “it can be incredibly difficult for victims of sexual abuse to share such
deeply personal, intimate, private information about their experiences and the impact it has had
on their lives,” and many victims “suffer from a loss of trust and confidence in individuals in
positions of authority.”°° The EVCP sought to create an environment where claimants did not
feel a need to “censor themselves” about their experiences.*! Creating that environment simply
would not be possible without strong assurances of confidentiality. As expressed to Ms.
Feldman by victims’ attorneys and victims themselves, “many victims were initially reluctant to
participate in the EVCP — or would have refused to participate — without an express assurance of
confidentiality.”*?

Any intrusion on that promise would threaten the foundation of the program. As Ms.
Feldman explains, “[c]ompromising confidentiality in any way would eviscerate the very
foundation and fabric of the EVCP, and would have a disastrous chilling effect on victims.”*?
Compelling the EVCP to disclose the information it promised to keep confidential would be
“anathema to the integrity of this Program and others like it” and “would turn the Program on its
head with far-reaching consequences to this victim population and beyond”—meaning for the
EVCP and the viability of other past, existing, and future litigation-alternative victim
compensation programs.*4 Ms. Feldman is unaware of any other instance in which an
