The Administrator acknowledges that some claimants may not be able to
provide documentation to corroborate the claim. In that event, you should
still submit a claim, including a personal statement. You will also be afforded
an opportunity to meet with the Administrator and provide an oral
presentation about the abuse you suffered. Your oral and written
presentation, together with other corroborating information available to the
Administrator, may support a claim for compensation.

9. I submitted my claim. When will a decision be made?
Claims will be processed promptly, on a rolling basis, generally in the order
in which they are received. Upon completion of the review of your claim by
the Administrator, you will be notified of any deficiencies in your claim (if
necessary) or of the claim determination. Claim determinations are made
only after a substantially complete claim has been submitted.

10. Can review of my claim be expedited or accelerated?
In general, claims are evaluated in the order in which they are received. If
you believe you face exigent circumstances that warrant an expedited review
of your claim, such as terminal illness or significant financial hardship, please
indicate the situation on the Claim Form or attach a cover letter with your
claim submission with an explanation of the circumstances and contact the
Administrator at ClaimantServices@EpsteinVCP.com with the subject line
“Expedite Request”. “Significant financial hardship” includes an imminent or
pending foreclosure or eviction proceeding, utility cut off, or other similar
circumstances, as demonstrated by appropriate documentation.

11.If I submit a claim, will my information be kept confidential?
This Program is confidential. All of the information submitted pursuant to
this Program will be used and disclosed only for purposes of processing and
evaluating the claim and administering the Program and other Program-
related work. No information provided by Claimants will be provided to the

by whom the Claimant alleges she was trafficked or sexually abused. The
Estate has agreed that no information obtained solely through the Program
will be disclosed publicly or used by the Estate in defending itself from any
claim, regardless of forum. The Program’s files are not available for
inspection, review or copying by the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein during or after
the Program, and all pertinent mediation privileges, settlement privileges and
other privileges apply.
