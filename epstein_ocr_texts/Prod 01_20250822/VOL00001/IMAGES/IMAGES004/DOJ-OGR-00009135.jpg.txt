and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for
cause.’” Jd. at 815 (quoting McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556). The Second Circuit held: “Clearly,
this is a two-part test.” Jd. Specifically, “in order to obtain a new trial, a defendant must show
both that a juror gave a dishonest answer, and that the correct answer would have provided a basis
for the defendant to challenge the juror for cause.” /d. at 816 (emphasis in original). Because the
defendant in Shaoul, as in McDonough, had failed to satisfy the “threshold requirement” of
dishonesty, the Circuit affirmed the district court’s denial of his motion for a new trial. Jd.

In so doing, the Second Circuit specifically rejected the argument that “a new trial is
mandated when the correct disclosure would have sustained a challenge for cause, regardless of
the juror’s honesty in failing to answer the question correctly.” /d. at 815 (quotation omitted). As
the Circuit explained, that argument relied on a “contorted” and “incorrect” reading of its prior
decision in United States v. Langford, 990 F.2d 65 (2d Cir. 1993). Shaoul, 41 F.3d at 815. Here,
the defendant’s argument relies in significant part on the very same reading of Langford that was
explicitly rejected in Shaoul. Compare Shaoul, 41 F.3d at 815, with Def. Mem. at 24, 27.

The defendant’s reliance on two concurring opinions in McDonough fares no better.
Justice Rehnquist’s opinion for the Court in McDonough was joined by six other justices.’ That
opinion, and not the concurrences, therefore sets forth the Court’s holding. Cf Marks v. United
States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977) (determining court’s holding by reference to concurring opinions
only “[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys
the assent of five Justices”). And to the extent those concurrences may be considered in construing
the holding of McDonough, they were clearly available to the Second Circuit when it did so in
8 While the vote count is not always clearly listed on Westlaw or other legal research sites, the
official version in the U.S. Reports indicates as much. See https://tile.loc.gov/storage-
