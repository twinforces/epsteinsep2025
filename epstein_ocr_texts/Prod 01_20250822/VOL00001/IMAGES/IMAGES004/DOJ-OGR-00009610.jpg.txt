Because the defendant. cannot meet ‘her “heavy burden” of establishing cither clement of
unconstitutional delay; Cornielle; 171 F.3d, at 752, let alone both, her motion to, vacate her

IV. The Court:Should'Deny the Defendant’s Motion for Judgment of. Acquittal Under
‘Rule:29

In.a brief. paragraph at. the end. of her motion, the defendant “reasserts th{c] same:motion”
under, Rule 29 she made following the close of the Government’s:case and, the close of her case
and “incorporates the arguments previously made to the Court.” (Def. Mot. .at 30). The Court.
should.reject those: arguments as it has before,

The defendant has only offered a specific challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence as to
Counts One and. Two, the enticement counts. Specifically, the defendant argued that the: record
lacked sufficient, evidence that.the defendant “or anyone else who allegedly participated in this
conspiracy persuaded, induced, or enticed Jane to, travel. to New York to engage in illégal sexual
activity.” (Tr. 2266-67; see Tr. 2269-70 (“There is not.'testimony whatsoever that Ghislaine:
Maxwell encouraged [Janc] to travel.”)). Of course, the jury acquitted the defendant on Count:
T.wo, the substantive cnticement count. .As t6 Count One, the jury could have readily concluded.
that the defendant conspired with, Epstein, to groom minor victims and entice them to travel to
Epstcin’s various ‘properties, including his home in New York, to be sexually abused. For instance,
Jane testified that.she was abused by Epstein and the defendant in New York. (Tr. 320). And the:
record is repletewith testimony. regarding the manner in which the defendant;worked,with Epstein,
to groom-minor victims and, entice them to travel to Epstein’s properties. (Sée, é&¢., Tr. 300 (Jane:
secing, the: defendant'topless), 348 (making Jane feel:special, in part by taking her on “ficld trips”),
