MS. MOE: ‘Thank you, ‘your Honor. I"m going to bring
to the Court's attention an issue that came t6 our attention
regarding prospective Juron No. 93. We learned, following voix
dire, based on publicly available information, that that

prospective juror is an attorney at a financial institution.

At trial, there will be a witness from that financial
institution. He is mone than a records custodian in the sense
that He is an executive director at that financial institution.
And, he'll be talking about certain, financial transactions.

During our meetings with this witness, an attorney for
the financial institution had been, present along with outside
counsel for the financial institution.

So we want to just bring that to the Court's
attention. We flagged that for the defense as well.
