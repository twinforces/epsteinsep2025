no legal effect). Although Rule 12(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure references
“pleadings,” “a district court has the inherent power to strike a party's submissions other
than pleadings.” Mazzeo v. Gibbons, No. 2:08-CV-01387-RLH-PA, 2010 WL 3910072,
at *3 (D. Nev. Sept. 30, 2010); see also Metzger v. Hussman, 682 F. Supp. 1109, 1110
(D. Nev. 1988) (motion to strike granted and motion in opposition not considered by the
court). This Court should strike all the filings made by Juror No. 50.

Alternatively, Ms. Maxwell requests that the “Memorandum of Law in Support of

and logic show that there is no right of access to discovery materials”). See SEC v. The
Street.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 233 (2d Cir.2001) (rejecting claim that deposition testimony
became a “judicial document” “because the Court reviewed it 1n order to decide whether
or not to enter [a] protective order’).

The fact that Juror No. 50 filed these pleadings does not make them “judicial
documents.” United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I”), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995)
