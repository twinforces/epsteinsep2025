Re: United States ¥. Ghislaine. Maxwell
S220 Cr. 330 (AJN)

‘Dear Judge Nathan:

Ghislaine Maxwell submits this lettér-in response to-the. Court’s order (Dkt. 665). Ms.
Bryant (collectively, the “Individuals") as "victims" of the counts of conviction and disputes that
the Individuals qualify as statutory-victims:within the definition of a “crime victim" contained. in

The issue that requires résolution in advance of sentencing is whether the Individuals, or
their-representatives, have statutory crime:victim status under'the CV.RA. Under the statute,
definition of “crime victim” takes'as a given that there hasbeen a “‘federal offense” committed.
Sée 18 U.S.C. § 3771(€)(2)(A). Ms. Maxwell asscrts:that'the. Individuals are, ot statutory’ crime
to the alleged abuse, (ii) the alleged abuse occurred during the period alleged ‘in the indictment,
and (iii) the Individuals. were “directly and-proximately: harmed asa. result of the commission of.

[the] /’ederal offense.” Jd.(cmphasis added).
