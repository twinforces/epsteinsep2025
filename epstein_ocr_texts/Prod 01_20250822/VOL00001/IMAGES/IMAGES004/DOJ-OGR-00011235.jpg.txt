Alessi, David. Rodgers, and Nicole Hesse. .And the Government did. not:seck anonymity for a
number of other. witnesses the Government:ultimately did not; call at trial."

Til. = Discussion

The defendant’s motion should be denied for two:rcasons. First, it:secks anonymity: for
categories of witnesses that courts generally have not previously permitted to testify with their
identitics protected. Second, the defendant’s request does not implicate her right.to a fair trial or
to present a.defense.

First, none of the defense witnesses satisfy any of the established, categories of witnesses

' The Government also offered. a large number of exhibits under seal or in redacted form. Those
requests largely, ifnot entirely, concerned (1) witnesses whom the Court permitted to testify using
‘pscudonyms orunder their first names; (2):personal identifying information, such as addressés; (3)
information related to third partics, that is, individuals:‘who are not testifying at trial or at issue in.
the case; or (4) exhibits where information. for testifying witnesses was co-mingled ‘with private:
information so extensively. that-redactions were impractical.
