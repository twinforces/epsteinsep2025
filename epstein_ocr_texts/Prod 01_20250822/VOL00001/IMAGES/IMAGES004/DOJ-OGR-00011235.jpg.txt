witnesses using pseudonyms or first names, and to redact or seal certain exhibits, as a further
measure to protect the identities of the four Minor Victims. The Government did not argue that
those witnesses merited pseudonyms on their own, but rather that they needed derivative
anonymity to protect the Minor Victims.

Numerous other witnesses testified at trial for the Government under their true name,
including those closely associated with the defendant and Epstein, such as Larry Visoski, Juan
Alessi, David Rodgers, and Nicole Hesse. And the Government did not seek anonymity for a
number of other witnesses the Government ultimately did not call at trial.

The defendant now seeks anonymity protection for three lay witnesses, none of whom are
offered to testify as victims of sexual abuse: a. Michelle Healy, and i.

Ill. Discussion

The defendant’s motion should be denied for two reasons. First, it seeks anonymity for
categories of witnesses that courts generally have not previously permitted to testify with their
identities protected. Second, the defendant’s request does not implicate her right to a fair trial or
to present a defense.

First, none of the defense witnesses satisfy any of the established categories of witnesses
who courts have permitted to testify under pseudonyms. The defendant does not even suggest that
Po fits into any such category. (Def. Letter at 8-9). Indeed, the defense concedes
' The Government also offered a large number of exhibits under seal or in redacted form. Those
requests largely, if not entirely, concerned (1) witnesses whom the Court permitted to testify using
pseudonyms or under their first names; (2) personal identifying information, such as addresses; (3)
information related to third parties, that is, individuals who are not testifying at trial or at issue in
the case; or (4) exhibits where information for testifying witnesses was co-mingled with private
information so extensively that redactions were impractical.
