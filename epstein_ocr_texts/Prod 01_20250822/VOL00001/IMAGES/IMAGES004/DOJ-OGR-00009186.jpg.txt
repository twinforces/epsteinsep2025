SEMENT Scotty revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual abuse and that it did not affect his ability to view
Maxwell'as innocent until proven guilty:

Today’Scotty is:completely satisfied that they reached the right verdict,and that, with Maxwell's conviction, justice
has been done.

He.says that he. believes she will spend the. rést of her life in prison Unless a deal is done to réduce her sentence.,
But said that he:had no idea of the severity of the potential sentence until after the verdict was reached and that.it
would not have influenced anything if he had.

He:said, ‘It satisfies me to, know that'we did our due diligence and that’ we brought justice for these victims, for
these:girls who-are now women.’

Hé said that; ultimately, hé-and the rest of thé jurors weré Convinced that Epstein and Maxwell's livés were.so
intertwined" that. it: was inconceivable that she was not fully aware of his crimes.

She.aided and.abetted, he said..And with her conviction she wasn't paying or being held accountable for Epstein's
crimes as hér-attorneys have argued, Scotty-sdid, instead shé:was answering to hér own guilt because shé,was
‘every bit as culpable’ as he.

According to Scotty, ‘The prosecution proved their:case beyond reasonable doubt.’
