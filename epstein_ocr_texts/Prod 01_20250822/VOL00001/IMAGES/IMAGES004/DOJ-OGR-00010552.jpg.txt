involvement in the offense is immense,” and:that she was essential to “fostering a culture for the
abuse to continuc.” (/d..). Morcover,'the Probation Office observed. that the defendant’s conduct.
reflected.a.dark world view: “it appears that the defendant: viewed the victims as objects who could.
be: manipulated for her and Epstein’s own sclfish ‘purposes ‘without any ‘regard ‘for their personal,
wellbcing, health, or safety.” (/d.).

As the PSR reflects, the ‘United States Probation Office has ‘calculated an applicable
sentencing range ‘under the advisory. United States Sentencing’ Guidelines of 292. to 365 months,
based on a-total offense level of 40. The Government does not object tothe calculation sct forth.
in the PSR, except that the Government respectfully submits that, as noted. in, the Government’s
objections to, the PSR, the: Guidelines calculation should include two additional groups relating to
two victims: Virginia Roberts.and the victim identificd at trial as Mclissa. (PSR at 45). Pursuant.
to the Court’s discovery order, ‘the Government notified the defense by Ictter' on, September 13,
including Virginia.Roberts and'Mclissa. The Government:did just that attrial. (See, e.g., Tr. 2874,
2882-84 (discussing cvidence demonstrating the ‘abuse of Virginia Roberts and Mclissa in.
summation); PSR 44 55-58, 80). The. PSR. notes that Virginia Roberts and. Mclissa.do:not appear
by name ‘in the indictment, but. Application Note 6 to U.S.S.G: § 2G1.3 expressly ‘instructs that if
the relevant conduct.of an offense of conviction. includes “prohibited sexual. conduct in. respect to
more:than one minor, whether specifically cited in the:count of conviction, each such:‘minor shall
be'treated as, if contained jin. a'scparate, count-of conviction.” (emphasis added).

Accordingly, the offense. level should be increased by two levels, pursuant to U-S.S.G.
§ 2G1.3(d)(1). Ais a result, the applicable sentencing range is 360 to 660 months’ imprisonment,

based on.an offense level. of 42.
