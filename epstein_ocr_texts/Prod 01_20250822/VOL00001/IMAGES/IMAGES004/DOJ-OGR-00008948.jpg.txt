a-part and.furtheranee of their scheme to abuse’ minor victims, [Ms.. Maxwell] and Jeffrey
Epstein enticed and. causéd ‘minor victims to travel to Epstein’s ‘residences in different states,
which [Maxwell] knew and. intended would result:in their grooming, for and subjection to sexual
‘abuse.”’).

Ms. Maxwell moved to, dismiss the multiplicitous, conspiracy counts iin. her. pretrial.
motions. (Dkt. 1.22, 210,293). The Court, citing the Second Circuit’s holding in, United States v.
Joséphburg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir. 2006), found that the motion was premature because Ms.
Maxwell had not been.convicted:on the :conspiracy: counts and, hence,, was not:yet:in jeopardy of
receiving multiple punishments for the same offense. (Dkt. 207 at, 27-28; 'Dkt.317 at.9-10). The
Court deni¢d Ms. Maxwell’s motion without:prejudice, deferring the résolution of the
multiplicity claim-until after the: conclusion of the trial. Jd.

The trial is now over, and, Ms.. Maxwell;was convicted on, all three conspiracy counts.
The government’s theory of prosecttion.and the prooftclicited at trial were entirely aligned with
the allegations inthe Indictment — that Ms. Maxwell participated in a. single criminal, conspiracy
‘with Epstein, which, may have evolved slightly over time, but.always maintained the same
overarching objective, the same core: participants, and:the: same method ‘of operation throughout
the entire time period:in, the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell now faces the’ prospect of being punished
multiple'times forthe same offense in violation of her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause.
Accordingly, we move the Court to impose judgement.on. only one ofthe three conspiracy
counts.

As Applicable Law:

“An indictment is multiplicitous when ‘it-charges a:single offense as an offense multiple
tines, in séparate counts, when, in law'and fact, only one crime: has been Committed.” Wnited

States v. Chacko, 169 F.3d.140, 145 (2d Cir. 1999). Multiplicitous indictments violate:the
