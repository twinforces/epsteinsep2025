Renowned Claims Resolution Experts Announce Commencement of the
Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program

New York, NY — Today, individuals who'were. sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein may begin the
process of filing claims with 'the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program (“Epstein VCP” or
“Program”). The Epstein VCP isa voluntary, non-adversarial, confidential claims resolution program’
that has been established to compensate victims-survivors and resolve. their:'sexual abuse claims
against Jeffrey Epstein and the Epstein Estate. The, Epstein VCP will operate entirely independently
of the Epstein Estate.

The Program was designed over the last several months by nationally recognized independent:
claims ‘administration experts Kenneth R.. Feinberg, Camille S. Biros and Jordana (“Jordy”) H.
Feldman (“Co-Designers”) with input from attorneys, representing over 70 victims; the Attorney.
General of the Virgin Islands, the Epstein Estate and other interested parties. The Program will be
administered by Ms. Feldman (the “Administrator’), the former Deputy Special Master of the
September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, the litigation-alternative program administered by. the
U.S. Department. of Justice that compensates victims who have become sick or died as a result of
their September 11th-related exposure.

“This, Program provides ‘victims. of Jeffrey Epstein the opportunity to be heard outside. the glare of
public courtroom proceedings, and to receive ‘acknowledgment by an independent third party as to
‘the legitimacy of their experience and the long-term ‘suffering it has wrought,” said Ms. Feldman.
“Treating victims with dignity and respect and providing them with appropriate ‘compensation is
central ‘to our’work with the Program, even as we recognize that' rio. amount of money'will erase the.
years of pain these victims have endured.”

“These, programs. are as much about offering validation ‘as, providing fair compensation,” said Mr.
Feinberg who, along with Ms. Biros, has designed and administered similar compensation, programs:
for the Catholic: Church sexual abuse claims, the Perin Staté sexual abuse claims, arid the
September 11th Victim Compensation Fund, among others.

The Program provides victims with an attractive alternative to litigation by offering a process that is
speedy and cost-effective. The. Program also removes barriers to pursue ‘claims in civil:courts,
