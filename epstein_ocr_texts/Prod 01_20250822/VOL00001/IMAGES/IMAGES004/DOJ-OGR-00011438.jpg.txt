Finally, “evidence that a party lied during settlement negations may be admissible to
impeach that party under Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b) when she later testifies at trial,”
Wright & Miller, 23 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid., § 5305 Scope—Impeachment by Prior
Inconsistent Statement or Contradiction, (2d ed., Apr. 2021 update), despite the language in Rule
408(a) saying compromise evidence is generally inadmissible to impeach by a prior inconsistent
statement or contradiction. As Wright & Miller recognize,

evidence of false statement during compromise negotiations would not be barred

by Rule 408(a)(2) if offered to impeach on the theory it is a specific instance of

conduct probative of a witness’ character for untruthfulness and, thus, potentially

admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 608(b). This is consistent with the
language of Rule 408(b), which permits admission of false statements made in
negotiations so long as offered for a purpose other than that addressed by Rule

408(a).

Wight & Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid., § 5310.

Mot. at 3. Instead, the government elides the proper inquiry, saying that the information in the
payment records is otherwise procurable. /d. But that’s not the question, and even if it were, the
government is wrong.

According to the government, the 3500 material includes statements from the accusers
attesting to the amounts of money they received. /d. But the constitution does not require Ms.
Maxwell to take her accusers’ words for it. U.S. Const. amend. VI. She has a right to know
