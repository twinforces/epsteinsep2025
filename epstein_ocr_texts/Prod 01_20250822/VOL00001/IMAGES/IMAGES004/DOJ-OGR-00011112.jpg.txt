Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document690 _ Filed 11/19/21 Page4of23

The probative value of the anticipated testimony must of course be balanced with any
potential prejudice under Rule 403. As the Court noted at the November 1 conference, there is a
risk that the jury may confuse the issues and think that the sexual conduct this witness is
describing itself constitutes the illegality charged in the Indictment due to the closeness in age of
this witness to the age of consent. Nov. 1, 2021 Tr. at 89-90. There is also the risk that the jury
may convict Ms. Maxwell due to feelings of immorality or sympathy for the witness despite the
lack of illegality with regard to the crimes charged in the Indictment. However, the Court
concludes that this risk of prejudice can be sufficiently minimized through two avenues. First,
the testimony must be carefully limited. Second, there must be a clear limiting instruction.

As to the first, the witness is limited to stating that sexual activity occurred but is
precluded from providing detailed descriptions of the sexual activity. There is little to no
probative value of a witness describing sexual activity when that witness’s testimony regarding
the sexual activity cannot form the basis for the conviction of the crimes charged. For example,
any prejudice fon iii described above is substantially diminished
by limiting the proffered testimony to the Defendant’s interaction with the witness and testimony
indicating that sexual activity allegedly took place without describing the details of that sexual
activity. Unlike the details of the sexual conduct itself, this anticipated testimony would not be
unduly prejudicial. In contrast, the minimal probative value of the details of sexual conduct
would be substantially outweighed by the risk of the jury convicting Ms. Maxwell on an
improper basis. The same is true of the witness’s subjective experience of the sexual conduct
and any emotional or other impact the sexual conduct had on the witness because such testimony
cannot form the basis of a conviction in this case. Accordingly, the witness is limited, as the
Government phrased it, to describing her “factual experience” as to the lines of testimony
