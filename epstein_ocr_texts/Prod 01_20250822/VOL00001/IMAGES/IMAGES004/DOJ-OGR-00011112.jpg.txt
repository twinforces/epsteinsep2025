Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document690 Filed 11/19/21 Page 4 of 23

The probative value of the anticipated.testimony must.of course be balanced with any:
‘potential prejudice undér Rule. 403. As the Court noted. at. the November ‘| conference, theré is. a
risk that the jury may ‘confuse the issues and.think that the sexual. conduct this witness is
describing itself constitutes the illegality charged.in the Indictment duc to the closeness in.age of
this Witness to the age of: consent. ‘Nov. 1, 2021 Tr. at 89-90. There is also-the risk thatthe jury’
lack of illegality with regard to the crimes, charged in, the Indictment. However, the Court:
concludes that-this risk of prejudice. can be sufficiently:minimized through two avenues. First,
the testimony, must be carefully limited. Sccond, there’must be:a clear limiting instruction..

As to, the first, the witness is limited to stating that.séxual. activity occurred. but is
precluded from providing detailed descriptions of the sexual. activity. There is little tono

probative value of'a, witness, describing scxual activity when, that. witness’s testimony ‘regarding

the sexual activity carinot. form the basis for the conviction, of the crimes, charged. For example,
any prejudice from[ «described above is substantially diminished
by limiting the:proffered testimony to, the Defendant’s intcraction’with the ‘witness, and testimony’
indicating that sexual activity. allegedly took place without describing the details: of that.scxual
activity. ‘Unlike the details of the sexual conduct itself, this anticipated testimony would not be
unduly prejudicial. Im .contrast, the minimal. probative value of the details of sexual conduct.
would be substantially outweighed. by the risk of the:jury convicting Ms. Maxwell on an
improper basis. The same is true:of the witness’s subjective expericnee of the sexual conduct:
and. any emotional or other impact-the sexual conduct had ‘on the witness. because such testimony

Government phrased it, to, describing her “factual expericnee” as'to, the lines of testimony’
