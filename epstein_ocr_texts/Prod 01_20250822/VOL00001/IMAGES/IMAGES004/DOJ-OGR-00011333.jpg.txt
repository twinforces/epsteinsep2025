Re: — United'States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

Ms. Maxwell has. disclosed 'to the government'the. Deecmber 19, 1996 Agreement for
Sale of 44 Kinnerton Street London SW 1, Gov. Letter Mot., Ex. A. The 1996 Agreement:is
impeachment-cwidence, the relevance of which Ms. Maxwell could not have known until Kate
testified on dircct.cxamination that Ms. Maxwell. lived. in the.Kinnerton Strect-home in 1994. The
1996 Agreement contradicts Kate’s testimony. by proving that'Ms. Maxwell did not.purchase
Kinnerton Street until 1996. Ms. Maxwell was not réquired to:disclosé the 1996 Agreement, to
the government until now.

The government; does. not deny the authenticity or relevance of the 1996 Agreement. ‘The
1996 Agreement shows that Ms. Maxwell contracted to purchase 44 Kinnerton Strect in.
December 1996 and completed the sale in, early’ 1997. The:Kinnerton,home is in the Belgravia
neighborhood. of London.

Kate, by contrast, testified under. oath that she visited-Ms. Maxwell’s home‘on Kinnerton

‘Street in, 1994 when Kate was 17 years old.
