2 A. I don't believe the suspension report has a Bronxville
2 address. If you're referring to the Appellate Division.
3 Q. Did you lock at the Westlaw report?
4 A. Yes.
5 @. And did you notice the Bronxville address in the Westlaw
6 report?
7 A. There was a Bronxville address listed somewhere in the
8 Westlaw report.
9 QO. And did you note a reference to someone that had been
10 identified by your firm previously as having the same name as
ley the father of Catherine Conrad, immigration judge?
12 A. I'm not sure what you're referring to as someone having
13 been identified earlier. There was, I think there was a
14 mention -- well, I don't know that in the report there's a
15 mention of any father. I think that there's talks about head
16 of household of a house that was owned and it lists two people.
17 I didn't know who Catherine Conrad's father was.
18 QO. That was Robert Conrad, is that correct, the one you saw
13 was head of household?
20 A. That's correct.
Zu Q@. And when you saw the e-mail traffic at some point, did you
22 see there was a reference by people in your firm who had
23 referred to Robert Conrad in the e-mail traffic?
24 A. Later on when I saw the e-mail exchange.
25 Q. And those e-mail exchanges existed during the course of the
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
