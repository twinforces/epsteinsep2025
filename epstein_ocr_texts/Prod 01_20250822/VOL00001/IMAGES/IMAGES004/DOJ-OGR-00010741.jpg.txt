It is also important to understand that this case has now moved to a different phase than the
trial phase, where (of course) the defendant is entitled to a presumption of innocence and is
protected by the requirement that the Government must prove guilty by proof beyond a reasonable
doubt. But, in determining the “crime victim” issue at sentencing, the relevant standard of proof is
the conventional standard for proceedings in criminal cases outside of trial: preponderance of the
evidence. See United States v. Giraldo-Serna, 118 F.Supp.3d 377, 382 (D.D.C. 2015) (“Purported
victims under the CVRA must prove their victim status by a preponderance of the evidence.”)
(citing Jn re McNulty, 597 F.3d 344, 351 (6th Cir. 2010); United States v. Atl. States Cast Iron Pipe
Co., 612 F.Supp.2d 453, 486, 495, 508 (D.N.J. 2009)); see also United States v. Gushlak, 728 F.3d
184, 195 (2d Cir. 2013) (applying preponderance of of the evidence standard to victim restitution
issue); United States v. Kim, 988 F.3d 803, 809 (Sth Cir. 2021) (same).

Against that backdrop, Kate is a “victim” who has a right to speak at sentencing just as she
was permitted to testify during the trial. In addition, this Court also possesses broad discretionary
power, derived from statute and common law, to hear from Kate in determining the appropriate
sentence. See 18 U.S.C. § 3661; see also United States v. Degenhardt, 405 F.Supp.2d 1341, 1343
(D. Utah 2005) (discussing the court's discretionary powers to hear from victims).

Federal courts have wide discretion to gather information at sentencing subject to only a
few constitutional or statutory restrictions. See United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443,446 (1972)
(“[A] judge may appropriately conduct an inquiry [at sentencing] broad in scope, largely unlimited
either as to the kind of information he may consider, or the source from which it may come.");
Williams v. New York, 337 U.S. 241,247 (explaining that in order to determine an “appropriate
sentence” judges need “the fullest information possible concerning the defendant’s life and
characteristics.”). The Federal Rules of Evidence do not limit the evidence that the court can
