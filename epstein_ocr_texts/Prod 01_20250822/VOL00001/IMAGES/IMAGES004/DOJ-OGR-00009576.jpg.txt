conviction outside of the scope of the S2 Indictment only if taken entirely in isolation and applied
by a jury that disobeyed the Court’s instructions.

b. The Second Jury Note

The defendant argues that, notwithstanding the tight connection between the Indictment,
evidence at trial, and jury instructions, the jury in fact actually convicted the defendant for
transporting Jane to New Mexico to engage in criminal sexual activity there. This argument relies
almost entirely on a single jury note.

During deliberations, the jury sent the following note:

Under Count Four, if the defendant aided in the transportation of Jane’s

return flight, but not the flight to New Mexico, where/if the intent was

for Jane to engage in sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the

second element?
(Tr. 3126). The note led to a lengthy discussion, at the conclusion of which the Court concluded
it should refer the jury back to the jury charge on the second element of Count Four because the
jury note was otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and legally.” (Tr. 3126-40).

That night, the defense filed a letter seeking reconsideration of the Court’s response and
raising the possibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial variance. (Dkt. No. 566 at 2-3).
The defense asked the Court to give an additional instruction in the morning. (/d. at 7). That
proposal instructed the jury as to the intent elements of Counts Two and Four, and ended with the
sentence that “[a]n intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any state other than New York

The Court rejected the defendant’s request. The Court noted that the jury did not inquire
about Count Two, so there was no basis to respond to the jury note with information about Count
