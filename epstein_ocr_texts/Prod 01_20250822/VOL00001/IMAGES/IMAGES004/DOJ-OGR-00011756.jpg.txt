LBT.CMAX4 Visoski - direct,

probably couldn't séé 'the passéngérs as well, but depending
upon how the car approached the aircraft, if I'm sitting in the
cockpit looking down, I would be able 'to Sée the driver of the
can.

®. Dtiring that same period between 1994 and 2004, who do you
remember that you saw driving passengers up to Mr. Epstein.'s
plané in Palm Beach?

A, There were probably several. Typically, it was the house
Manager at ‘the time that would drive Mr. Epstein to the

airplane. One name comes. to mind would be Juan Alessi, and

another woéuld havé béen one of thé house tanagers, Janusz.
There were probably a couple more that I'm just drawing a blank
on their names right row.

Q. That's fine. Now switching gears 'to New York, about when.
dé. you remember first visiting Mr. Epstein's New York
residence?

A. Well, he first had a Korie oh 69th Street, sO it was in 1991
that, I went to his very finst mesidence, and then it was
probably a year or maybe two years later 6n that He had
purchased a different. townhouse or brownstone, they call it, I

employment I visited the home.
