The Presentence Investigation Report
On June 9, 2022, Probation filed its final PSR recommending a below-guidelines sentence
of 240 months’ imprisonment, followed by a five-year term of supervised release. See PSR at 65.
Regarding a sentencing recommendation, Probation has identified several
mitigating factors. Maxwell is 61 years old, and a guidelines sentence may be
tantamount to a lifetime term of imprisonment. The defendant has a reported history
of philanthropy, charitable work, and helping others namely her work with the
Clinton Global Initiative, The TerraMar Project, her use of EMT skills to help
others, and her tutoring of inmates at the MDC. We further acknowledge that
Maxwell is not solely responsible for the horrendous and irreparable damage caused
by the decade.
PSR at 66-67.
Adjustment to Incarceration
Despite her extraordinarily restrictive conditions of detention, Ms. Maxwell has availed
herself of any programming or work opportunity available to her. While in solitary confinement,
she completed six courses, but until transferred to general population, she never had the
opportunity to make use of that training. Post-trial she was permitted to work as an orderly which
has continued in general population. Since placed in general population, she has eagerly provided
a wide variety of assistance to the women is her unit, including GED tutoring. See PSR. §16. In
addition, she has participated in and completed several educational courses. See PSR §15.
* Ms. Maxwell is planning to appeal her conviction following sentencing. Accordingly, any discussion of
the trial evidence in this submission is not an admission by Ms. Maxwell as to its accuracy or veracity.
