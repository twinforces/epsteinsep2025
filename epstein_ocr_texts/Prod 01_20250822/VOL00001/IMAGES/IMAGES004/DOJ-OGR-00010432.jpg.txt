A. Ms. Maxwell Does Not Present a Continuing Danger to the Public.

It.is clear from.the Guidelines commentary and the Congressional intent underlying the
creation. of § 4B1.5 that the adjustment docs not apply to. Ms. Maxwell. The Sentencing
‘Commission created § 4B1.5 after the ‘passage of the Protection of Children from Sexual
Predators Act of 1998 (the “Act”). See. Pub. Law. 105-314 (Oct. 30, 1998). As part of the Act,
Congress directed the Sentencing Commission to. reviewand amend the Sentencing Guidelines
applicable to several offenses. involving child sexual abuse and exploitation, including the
enticement and. transportation offenses charged in the S2 Indictment, to ensure they were
“appropriately severe.” /d., Section. 502. Congress.also specifically directed the Sentencing’
promulgate amendments “‘to increase:penaltics applicable:to the[sc] offenses ... in‘any case in
which the defendant-engaged. in a:pattern of:activity involving the sexual abuse or‘exploitation of
a:minor.” /d., Section 505. In response, the Sentencing Commission. created § 4B1.5, which was
added to the Sentencing Guidelines on November 1, 2001. See’'USSG, App’x C, amend. 615..

The legislative history of the Act makes clear that the purpose of the law, and. § 4B1-5
specifically, was to protect children from-habitual scxual predators. and to inflict severe:
punishments on repeat (and often violent) offenders who ‘presenta, significant.risk. of recidivism.
Congress was particularly concerned about the danger these defendants pose to: the community
because they arc typically far more likely to.re-offend. than, other criminal. defendants — a fact
which numerous members of Congress cited as, a primary justification for'the passage of the Act.

° “Constituents deserve to be:protected from, socicty’s worst-offender-- the repeat

sexual predator..... [T]he recidivism rates of sex offenders are astonishingly
high — released rapists. are.:10’times. more likely to repeat their crime than-other
criminals. The Congress has a.responsibility to address the: issue by passing a
bill that: would ‘put an end ‘to this cycle of violence: repeated by a. single

perpetrator.” Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment. Act. of 1998,
Hearing Before the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on.Crime, 105"
