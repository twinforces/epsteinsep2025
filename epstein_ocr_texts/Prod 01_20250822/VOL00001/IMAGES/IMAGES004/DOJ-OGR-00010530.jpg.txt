Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

Counsel for Ms. Maxwell write to inform the Court that we do not request sealing or
redaction of the letter submitted by Robert Y. Lewis, Esq., counsel to Sarah Ransome and
Elizabeth Stein. However, Mr. Lewis’s letter raises an issue that we believe the Court must
resolve prior to the sentencing hearing; namely, who may submit victim impact statements to the
Court or address the Court at sentencing under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”).

Under the CVRA, a “crime victim” has, among other things, “the right to be reasonably
heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any
parole proceeding.” 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4). The CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “a person
directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense
in the District of Columbia.” 18 U.S.C. § 3771(e)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The concept of
“direct and proximate harm,” as used in the CVRA, is not limitless and only covers victims of
the conduct underlying the offenses of conviction. See United States v. Daly, No. 3:11-cr-121
(AWT), 2012 WL 315409, at *5-*6 (D. Conn. Feb. 1, 2012) (“[T]he determination as to whether
person has the rights of a ‘crime victim’ for purposes the CVRA is made with reference to the
conduct underlying the charged offense.) (emphasis added).

The conduct underlying the offenses charged against Ms. Maxwell ended “in or about
2004.” To our understanding, Ms. Ransome alleges that she was a victim of Epstein and Ms.
Maxwell from approximately October 2006 to April 2007, a full two years after the conduct in
this case ended. She therefore does not qualify as a “crime victim” under the CVRA. We do not
know when Ms. Stein alleges that she was a victim, but she would also not qualify as a “crime
victim” if the conduct she alleges post-dates 2004 or she was not a minor. According to
uncorroborated press reports Ms. Stein claims to have met Maxwell in 1994 when Ms. Stein was
21 years old and not a minor.

In his letter to the Court, dated June 14, 2022. Mr. Lewis requests that Ms. Ransome and
Ms. Stein be given an opportunity to speak at Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding and
references that Ms. Ransome spoke at the hearing conducted by Judge Berman following
Epstein’s death. But the sentencing proceeding to be held on June 28 is far different from the
hearing conducted by Judge Berman. Following Epstein’s death, the government moved for a
nolle prosequi to dispose of the case pursuant to Second Circuit law holding that if a defendant
