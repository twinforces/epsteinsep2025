Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell:

Dear Judge Nathan:

Counsel for. Ms. Maxwell write to inform the Court that we do not-request sealing or.
Elizabeth, Stein. However, Mr. Lewis’s letter raises an issue that we believe’ the Court, must.
resolve prior to, the sentencing’ hearing; namcly; who ‘may: submit victim impact-statements to the
Court or address the Court at sentencing under'the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”).

Under the CVRA, a “crime victim” has, among other things, “the right to be reasonably
heard at. any’public.proceeding in the district.court involving releasc, plea, sentencing, or any
parole proceeding.” 18°U:S.C..§ 3771(a)(4). The'CV-RA defines a “crime victim” as “a person
direétly. and. proximately harmed. as a result of the commission of a Fedéral offense or'an offense
‘in. the District of Columbia.” 18. U.S.C. § 3771 (¢)(2)(A) (emphasis added). The concept of
“direct and:proximate harm,” as used in the: CVRA, is not limitless and. only ‘covers victims of.
the conduct underlying'the offenses of conyiction, See United States v. Daly, No. 3:1 1-cr-121
(AWT), 2012 WL 315409, at *5-*6(D. Conn. Feb. 1, 2012) (“[T]he determination as to whether.
‘person.has the rights of a. ‘crime ‘victim’ for purposes the CVRA. is'made with reference to the.
conduct underlying the charged offensé.”) (emphasis added).

The conduct underlying the offenses charged against!Ms. Maxwell ended “in or about
2004.” To our understanding, Ms. Ransome alleges that she was a-victim of Epstcin and Ms.
‘Maxwell from approximately’ October 2006 to.April ‘2007, a full’two years after the conduct in
this case ended. She therefore docs not.qualify as a “crime victim” underthe CVRA. We do not.
know when Ms. Stcin-alleges that she was.a victim, but-she would also not qualify as.a “crime:
victim” if the :conduct:she alleges post- -dates 2004 or she was not.a minor. According, to
uncorroborated press'reports Ms. Stein claims to have met/Maxwell in 1994 when Ms. Stein was
2.1,-years old.and not:a minor.

In his letter tothe Court, dated June 14, 2022.'Mr. Lewis requests that Ms. Ransome. and
Ms. Stcin be given an ‘opportunity to:speak at Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing proceeding and.
references that!Ms. Ransome'spoke:at'the hearing conducted:by Judge Berman. following
Epstcin’s death. But'the sentencing proceeding to’be held.on June 28 is, far different:from the
hearing conducted by Judge Berman. Following Epstein’s death, the government moved for'a
nolle proséqui.to dispose of the case pursuant to Second Circuit law holding 'that.if'a defendant
