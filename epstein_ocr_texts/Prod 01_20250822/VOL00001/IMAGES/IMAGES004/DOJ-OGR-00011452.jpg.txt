effectively achieve the EVCP’s important societal goals of providing redress to victims and
efficiently resolving civil claims outside the glare of a public proceeding. Because Maxwell’s
subpoena would compromise that confidentiality and eviscerate the foundation of the EVCP and
similar programs, compliance would be “unreasonable or oppressive” under Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 17(c)(2). And because Maxwell’s subpoena seeks information that is largely
(if not entirely) inadmissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 408, it fails the test in United States
v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 702 (1974). Maxwell also seeks to subpoena statements of a witness or
prospective witness that are not subject to subpoena under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure
17(h). The subpoena should be quashed in its entirety.
