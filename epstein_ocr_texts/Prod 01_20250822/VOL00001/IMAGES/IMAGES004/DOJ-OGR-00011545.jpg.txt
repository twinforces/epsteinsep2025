1 with the point, which is we're focusing on the record evidence.
2 The conspiracy as charged requires there be to be a minor

3 involved. Carolyn is not a minor in 2005. Her birthday is

4 January -- I don't know if I can say that, I'm sorry, but you

5 understand it's at the beginning.

6 THE COURT: It's early.

7 MR. EVERDELL: It's early. So as of 2005, she is not
8 a minor any more. So if we're looking to the end date of the

9 conspiracy that's charged in the indictment, that does not

10 exist in 2005, and Carolyn is not a minor in 2005, that

11 evidence can't be used to support the end date of the

12 conspiracy that is charged.

13 So what we'tre really talking about is one message pad
14 that is undated, unverified, and not even in evidence. It's

15 not even properly authenticated. I would also point out --

16 it's not reliable, your Honor. But I would also point out that
17 I think we did have testimony that there were multiple message
18 pads going on at any one time. The surrounding message pads

19 are not a perfect indicator of when that message would have
20 been taken if it's undated. It could have been weeks, months
21 afterwards that someone decided to use that message pad to take
22 that message instead of another of message pad that was ongoing
23 at the same time. So there is no reliable credible evidence
24 that's the date of that message pad.
25 And so, your Honor, we cited a number of cases in our
