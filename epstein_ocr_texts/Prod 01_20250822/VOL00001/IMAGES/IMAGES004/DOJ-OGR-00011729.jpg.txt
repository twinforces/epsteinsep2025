2 THE COURT: Thank you for your patience.
3 Ms. Sternheim, you may proceed.
4 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.
a Let's go back to Annie for just a couple of minutes.
6 Whatever you hear Annie claim happened there, Annie
7 did not believe that she was a victim until later. People
8 convinced her otherwise. And interestingly, she will tell you
9 that she stopped writing in her diary before the events she
10 will testify to concerning New Mexico.
11 Now, Annie is a 41-year-old psychotherapist who met
12 Ghislaine once in Santa Fe. Never saw her again. Never saw
13 Epstein after that. Never traveled to New York after that.
14 She now promotes herself as a victim and speaks publicly.
15 Now, you should wonder why she is even a part of this
16 case. Because from our perspective, what happened in New
17 Mexico is not illegal conduct under the terms of this
18 indictment. She will claim that she's scarred by what happened
19 there. Yet ask yourself, if it was so traumatic, why has she
20 kept for 25 years the boots she claims Epstein purchased for
21 her to wear in the snake-filled brush of Santa Fe, boots that
22 have been well-worn over more than two decades. Now, Annie's
23 lawyers helped to set up the fund, and she was awarded $1.5
24 million for whatever she claims and didn't believe was
25 victimizing in Santa Fe.
