supermax detention - involved imprisonment within imprisonment. It was so different from
conventional conditions of pretrial detention as to constitute a different form of hardship and
tantamount to a different form of punishment. Typically, a defendant receives time-served credit
for each day incarcerated prior to sentencing. Pretrial detainees have received and continue to
receive credit beyond time served for detention during COVID. See, e.g., Gonzalez; Brissett,
supra. Ms. Maxwell should receive a hardship credit in addition to a COVID credit due to the
restrictive and harsh conditions of her pretrial detention.

CONCLUSION

Ghislaine Maxwell is not an heiress, villain, or vapid socialite. She has worked hard her
entire life. She has energy, drive, commitment, a strong work ethic, and desire to do good in the
world. She has supported friends and family through tough times and personal crisis and currently
is assisting women in her unit at the MDC. She has endeavored to contribute to society (e.g., by
becoming an EMT, developing a platform so that people in remote areas could receive quality
medical assistance, helping launch the Clinton Global Initiative, creating TerraMar, providing
GED tutoring for inmates in her unit) and will continue to do so throughout her sentence and when
she rejoins the community beyond prison walls. She has also tried to protect the people around
her (Ted Waitt’s children, her stepchildren, the people at TerraMar) from the onslaught of press
and public vilification that come with having been associated with her.

She had a difficult, traumatic childhood with an overbearing, narcissistic, and demanding
father. It made her vulnerable to Epstein, whom she met right after her father’s death. It is the
biggest mistake she made in her life and one that she has not and never will repeat. She has never
been accused of anything untoward in the over-15-year period since her relationship with Epstein
