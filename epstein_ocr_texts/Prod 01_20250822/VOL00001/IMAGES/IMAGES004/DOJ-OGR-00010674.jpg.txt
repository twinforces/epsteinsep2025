Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

I am counsel for Teresa Helm, and I am providing the following victim impact statement
for the Court’s consideration with respect to Maxwell’s sentencing.

Pursuant to the Crimes Victims’ Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3771, Ms. Teresa Helm
qualifies as a victim as the Defendant participated in her trafficking in 2002. Ms. Helm thus
requests the Court’s permission to make an oral statement at the sentencing.

Statement by Teresa Helm:

Ghislaine Maxwell, I was 22 years old when you entirely derailed the trajectory of my life.
You made a choice to view me as an individual less than you. You saw me as an object whose
only purpose was to be manipulated, used, abused, regarded as trash, and sent back from where I
came. You meticulously convinced me through your deceptive charm and conversation that you
were someone worthy of my bright and inspired young mind to look up to. You crafted your impact
on me. You groomed me. Then, you sent me off to another monster. I trusted you. You had
groomed me so well, I unsuspectingly walked myself to the home of that monster. I walked myself
to the home of that predator that hurt me. You manipulated and betrayed me into feeling and
believing that I was safe.

One of the most devastating outcomes to you hurting me is how I then began to view and
treat myself. I began to view myself as unworthy of love. I began treating myself as the garbage I
was regarded as. My life got so dark, the despair so intense, I nearly did not make it out alive. Do
you even remember me?

I am on the outside of prison walls. Freedom. Yet, I will forever fight for the freedom that
you callously stole from me.
