which are relatively casily understood by lawyers and judges.”); Dyer. Calderon, 151 F.3d 970,
973 (9th Cir. 1998) (“[W]é must be ‘tolerant, as jurors may’ forget. incidents long buried in their
minds, misunderstand.a question or. bend the truth.a bit to avoid.cmbarrassment.”); United States
vi, Fell, No. 01 Cr. 12,2014 WE 3697810, at *13 (D. Vt.July 24, 2014) (“[T]he written juror:
questions not including sub-parts.”).'' And, in any event, the credibility of Juror 50’s explanation,
as to'why, iffhe was indecd a victim of sexual ‘abuse, he answered this question inthe negative is
properly resolved not based on a. review of ‘unsworn public statements, but ata. hearing at. which.

the Court can question him on this subject and assess his credibility:

Furthermore, the defendant's suggestion[
LE] is undermined by several aspects of Juror 50’s ‘conduct. For example, when answering
the questions about exposure: to pretrial, publicity, Juror 50 disclosed that he had read about the
defendant.and her connection to Epstein. |
[| he would, presumably, have: lied. about other potentially
disqualifying facts, too. Similarly, if Juror 50 deliberately’ lied under penalty of perjury: in. order
to serve on the jury,,it would make little sense ‘for him to immediately: publicize that fact, thus
exposing himself to criminal liability.. See Perez, 1997 WL 403458, at *6 (“I find it improbable
that a juror who lied.on voirdire in order to be émpancled ona jury in. an age discrimination case:
to avenge himself against a discriminatory employer who was not a party to the: lawsuit would.
reveal this motivation after rendering a. verdict. If this had been. the juror’s intent, there was no

reason why'he would expose himself to defense counsel immediately following:the verdict.”),

'' Indeed, Juror 50’s counscl, in his:motion.to intervene, discussed infra at.Part II, wrote'that Juror
50 “does not recall answering questions [in'the questionnaire] regarding his’prior expericnee with,
sexual assault”” (Juror 50 Mem. at 5):
