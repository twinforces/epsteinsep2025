Judge Nathan:

This letter provides evidence regarding Ghislaine Maxwell's character and future that bears on your
upcoming sentencing in her case.

My name is Jamie Hollomon. I am a JD graduate of the Univ. of Pennsylvania Law School and an
MS graduate of the Univ. of California Santa Cruz in counseling psychology. For the past 27 years I
have practiced psychotherapy, first for Butte County's Division of Youth and Adult Services from
1995-2011 and then since then I've run my own private practice here in Santa Cruz, CA. I have never
treated Ghislaine Maxwell professionally, Rather, I am writing this as a long-time close friend of the
whole Maxwell family including Ghislaine.

My father, Dr. Herbert Hollomon, met Robert Maxwell, Ghislaine's father, in the mid-1950s because
my father was a major research science manager at General Electric Co and Maxwell was by then
already a major publisher of world science. Apart from earlier whole family stays with the Maxwells in
the early 60s, my parents sent me back to Oxford for an entire summer for work experience and to stay
with the Maxwell family in 1966 - Ghislaine was 5. I returned again in 1980 for more work experience
that summer and returned multiple times in later years to see the siblings and her mother Betty after
