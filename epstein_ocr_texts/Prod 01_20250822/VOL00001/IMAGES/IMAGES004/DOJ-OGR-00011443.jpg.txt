Annie Farmer (Accuser-2) has eschewed confidentiality at every opportunity. She sued in
her own name in this court against Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. See Dkt. No. 1, Annie Farmer
v. Indyke, Case No. 19-cv-10475 (LGS) (Nov. 12, 2019). She spoke publicly and using her real
name at the Epstein bail hearing and case dismissal hearings, even though she was not a named
victim in that case. Dkt. No. 36, United States v. Epstein, Case No. 19-cr-490 (RMB) (July 15,
2019). She has appeared (with her face in full view) in the Ne¢flix documentary using her real
name, on Dateline, 20/20, and many podcasts. All of these public statements reflect the same
facts and circumstances alleged in this criminal case. She is represented by David Boies and
Sigrid McCawley, who also represent Ms. Giuffre and numerous other Epstein-accusers. Mr.
Boies and Ms. McCawley have been prime advocates for the unsealing of all the filings in the
Giuffre v. Maxwell litigation before Judge Preska. See generally Dkt. Nos. 945 et seq., Giuffre v.
Maxwell, Case No. 15-cv-7433 (LAP).
