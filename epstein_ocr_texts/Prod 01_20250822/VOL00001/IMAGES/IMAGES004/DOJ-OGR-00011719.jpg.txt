LBTVMAX3 Opening - Ms. Sternheim

certainly ‘their attorneys, couldn't be Galléd as witnesses 'to
talk about that. Beyond that, I can't imagine a good-faith
basis, 'to proffer that evidence t6 cane before this jury about

that.

MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, the government well knows, 'that

the lawyers for these people sat in their offices. through

proffer sessions. If nothing 6lsé, théy are witnesses to what
went on in. that room. They also separately were in
communiGation with ‘the government providing informdtion to the
gevernment; and the ggvernment, in. turn, was helping them build
their cases, their civil Gases, and their cases for settlément.
So there is a good-faith basis to maise these ‘things.

THE COURT: I had said clearly, since it's unélear,
how you can call lawyers for witnesses in ‘this case as

withesses. themselves; that you wouldn't d6 so unless you

briefed, it specifically. You Mave mot done that. So you may
not refer to that testimony that you soniehow anticipdété getting
in, although I don't, knew hew you will in ‘your opening, You
may not. I was véry Clear that before that would happen, you
would have to brief it. I haven't seen any briefing, so you
may not reference it.

MS. STERNHEIM: But, Judge, may I just say there's no
dispute that if a witness to a proffer has information that may
be a conflict, with the testimony here, there is no privilege to
that.
