LBTVMAX3 Opening â€”- Ms. Sternheim

1 certainly their attorneys couldn't be called as witnesses to

2 talk about that. Beyond that, I can't imagine a good-faith

3 basis to proffer that evidence to come before this jury about

4 that.

5) MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, the government well knows that
6 the lawyers for these people sat in their offices through

7 proffer sessions. If nothing else, they are witnesses to what
8 went on in that room. They also separately were in

9 communication with the government providing information to the
10 government; and the government, in turn, was helping them build
11 their cases, their civil cases, and their cases for settlement.
12 So there is a good-faith basis to raise these things.

13 THE COURT: I had said clearly, since it's unclear,

14 how you can call lawyers for witnesses in this case as

15 witnesses themselves; that you wouldn't do so unless you

16 briefed it specifically. You have not done that. So you may
17 not refer to that testimony that you somehow anticipate getting
18 in, although I don't know how you will in your opening. You

19 may not. I was very clear that before that would happen, you
20 would have to brief it. I haven't seen any briefing, so you
al may not reference it.
22 MS. STERNHEIM: But, Judge, may I just say there's no
23 dispute that if a witness to a proffer has information that may
24 be a conflict with the testimony here, there is no privilege to
25 that.
