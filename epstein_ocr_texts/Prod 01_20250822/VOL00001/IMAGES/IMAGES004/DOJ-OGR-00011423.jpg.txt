To the extent the Court were to compel Mr. Glassman's testimony, Mr. Glassman would
need time to consult ethics counsel and perhaps the California State Bar. We would also
respectfully request that any testimony be conducted remotely to prevent the time, expense, and
COVID risk in light of what should be extremely limited testimony.
Respectfully submitted,
