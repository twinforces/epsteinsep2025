LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI GC: STERNHEIA

decided post-trial to reach out:to one of the ‘victims in this case, ‘publicly acknowledge his, own
scxual abuse; and loudly proclaim to the international press that Ms. Maxwell’s: guilty verdict
was a verdict. “for all the victims.” At the Hearing, Juror 50 explained his'reasons for doing this:
“After sitting on this trial for séveral weeks and sccing the victims bé brave enough to, give their
story; [ felt like:ifthey can do it, then so-can.I.” (Tr. 24).

Juror 50’s testimony shows that the victims’ testimony: ‘personally resonated, with.him.in a.
way that jurors ‘who had not been sexually abused as children ‘would:not have'felt. ‘It caused-him.
to. regard himself’ as.an advocate: of the’victims rather than a neutral arbiter of the facts. ‘Even if
the Court credits Juror 50’s contention (and it should not) that; he did not have'these emotions at:
the time of voir dire ‘and. only: developed. them after hearing the witness’ testimony, it still shows:
that Juror 50‘was not capable of “separating [his] own life experiences from, the evidence’ in the
case.” Sampson, 724 F.3d at 167; ste also Ashfar, 196 A.3d at 94-97 (finding bias for juror who
did. not-disclosc his prior sexual abuse, communicated with.a female victim of scxual assault, and
identified. himself as ‘‘an advocate, for the. people”).

Moreover, the hearing ‘testimony established that Juror 50’s. history of sexual abuse did,
in fact, compromise his ability to’be fair and impartial. Prior to the Hearing, Juror.S0 told-the
‘press, that: he recalled. several, details of his own.sexual abuse and. that-“some of it can be ‘replayed
like a:video.” At the Hearing, Juror 50 underscored that.his ‘own. experience of sexual. abuse
shaped his belicfs about how victims’ memories of traumatic events work. He stated that he
talked to'the press about, “how I view things and.how | can. recall memories .... [and] remember
things and recall things, like:the color of the wall[.]” (Tr. 23). He further stated that his own
memories are “why I belicve a-certain way” about the nature:of victims’ memories. (Tr. 22). As

Sct forth, in our initial Motion, Juror 50’s belicfs directly contradict Dr. .Loftus* expert'testimony
