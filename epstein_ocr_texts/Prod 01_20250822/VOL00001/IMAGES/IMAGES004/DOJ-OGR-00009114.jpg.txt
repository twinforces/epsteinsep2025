‘protections of the voir dire‘process. See Porter v. Zook, 898 F.3d 408, 431 (4th Cir. 2018): (It. 1s
clearly established law that “the “honesty” aspect of the first McDonough prong as cncompassing
not just straight lics, but also failures to disclose.”).

Once:an untrue.answer is.discovered, under the second prong of the MeDonongh test, “the
district;court must:‘determineifiit would have. granted.the hypothetical challenge.”” Stewart, 433
F.3d at.304 (quoting Uniied States v.. Greer, 285 F.3d.158, 171 (2d Cir. 2002). That requires an,
inquiry. into whether. accurate and. complecte afiswers, together with the answers to the “follow-up
questions.(and answers),”-would have provided“ valid-basis to:challenge forcause.” Porter, 898
F.3d at.432; see:also United States 'v. Golombo, 869 F.2d, 149, 15:1 (2d Cir. 1989): (noting false
answers prevent “follow-up questions” that may:expose bias).

In this case; the first prong under McDonough is satisfied by Juror 50’s press statements
showing that his purported voir dire answers — that he was. not sexually abused as a child and that
he. would view abuse victim witnesses like any. other witness —-were untrue. Juror 50 apparently:
toldthe Court in his Questionnairc'that he would assess the:eredibilityof.alleged scx crime'victims
“Sust the way [he] would, any other witness” (Question 47), and he denied that he had been the
victim of sexual abuse (Question 48). Further, he was asked if he or anyone close:to him-had any
experience that would, affect his ability to be fair and impartial,.and he apparently said no.
(Question. 50). Question 51 even gave. Juror SO thé opportunity to answer ‘these questions
confidentially to avoid embarrassment.or protect-his privacy, but he reportedly'declined. During

live questioning,Juror 50'purportedly: assured the Court: that he could be fairand impartial.
