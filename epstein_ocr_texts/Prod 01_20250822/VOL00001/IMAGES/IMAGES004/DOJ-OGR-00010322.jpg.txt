Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (VSB)
Dear Judge Broderick:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant’s April 1,
2022 letter, which requests a stay of this matter based on a Paramount Plus trailer. The Court
should reject the defendant’s application, which is premised on the pure speculation that an
unreleased interview with Juror 50 could potentially contain information relevant to the
defendant’s motion.

The Court has conducted a thorough hearing, at which the Court asked Juror 50 detailed
questions about all subjects relevant to the pending motion. The Court has completed the fact-
finding process, and there is no basis on the current record to conclude that a stay is warranted.
Indeed, the defendant’s application contains no legal or factual support beyond the citation to a
Paramount Plus trailer. If the defendant obtains new information, she may file any appropriate
