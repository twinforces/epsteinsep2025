MR. ROHRBACH: Yes. Thé government believes, that its

notice, in. combination. with its 3500 materials and the cases

it's pointed the défense to, Should give the défense an

understanding of Mr, Flatley's ‘opinions, to the extent that
they're expert, opinions at all and not just fact opinions.
THE COURT: Well —--

MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, my point is that

Ms. Menninger says that she would have her expert review
Mr, Flatléy's testimony in other Gases to see if there are

opinions he disagreed with, and, I just wanted to clarify that

the défensé expert shdéuld review the material the Government
has provided them.

THE COURT: That's fine, but it's your nétice that
sets up the opinions that ‘your expert. is offering.

MR. ROHRBACH: Yes; your Honor.

THE COURT: So what. they should do is ,look at the
néoticé, and if their éxpéert has different views tHah what.'s in
the motice, they should, provide those views.

MR. ROHRBACH: Yes; your Honor.

THE COURT: If your notice is insufficient under Rule
16 to tell us now what opinions your expert is going to
provide, then you may have problems down the road. But I'm not
going to have them held. to a different standard. than what the
government has done here,

MR. ROHRBACH: Of ‘course, your Honor.
