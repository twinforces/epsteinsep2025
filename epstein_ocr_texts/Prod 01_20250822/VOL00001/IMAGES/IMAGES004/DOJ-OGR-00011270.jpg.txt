the witness in good faith asserts that he cannot remember the relevant events,” in which case “the
trial court may, in its discretion, exclude the prior testimony”). Similarly, “prior silence
concering critical facts might be deemed inconsistent with later testimony which includes their
purported recollection,” but only if “the failure to mention those matters . . . conflict[s] with that
which is later recalled.” United States v. Leonardi, 623 F.2d 746, 756 (2d Cir. 1980). “Where the
belatedly recollected facts merely augment that which was originally described, the prior silence
is often too ambiguous to have any probative force, and accordingly is not sufficiently inconsistent
to be admitted for purposes of impeachment.” Jd. at 756-57 (citation omitted). Additionally, “the
probative value of a witness’s prior silence on particular facts depends on whether those facts are
ones the witness would reasonably have been expected to disclose.” Hong Fei Gao v. Sessions,
891 F.3d 67, 78 (2d Cir. 2018).

Second, whether the proponent gave the witness an “opportunity to explain or deny the
statement” and the adverse party “an opportunity to examine the witness about it.” Fed. R. Evid.

Third, whether the evidence is “competent and otherwise admissible.” Ghailani, 761 F.
Supp. 2d at 118.

Fourth, whether the impeachment relates to a non-collateral matter. See, e.g., United States
v. Blackwood, 456 F.2d 526, 530 (2d Cir. 1972).

Finally, whether the evidence’s probative value is not substantially outweighed by the
factors in Rule 403.
