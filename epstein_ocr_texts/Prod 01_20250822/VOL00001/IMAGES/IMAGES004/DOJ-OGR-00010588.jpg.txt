Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document670 - Filed 06/22/22 Page53o0f55

Money is a key theme underlying the criminal conduct in this case. The defendant’s access
to wealth enabled her to present herself as a supposedly respectable member of society, who rubbed
shoulders with royalty, presidents, and celebrities. That same wealth dazzled the girls from
struggling families who became the defendant and Epstein’s victims. That same wealth enabled
the defendant and Epstein to hire a parade of staff to transport victims and maintain the fabulous
properties where those victims were abused. That same wealth motivated the defendant to make
sure that Epstein’s repulsive desire for sexual contact with teenage girls was always met. That
wealth was the defendant’s reward. The defendant has lived a life of extraordinary privilege, and
she profited from her relationship with Epstein. It is only right that she should suffer some small
financial penalty for the incalculable harm she has caused.

The defense’s submissions to the Probation Office suggest that the defendant is attempting
to make the outrageous claim that she cannot afford a fine. (Dkt. 106). This Court has already
found that the defendant has attempted to conceal the full extent of her assets in connection with
this case. After getting caught in her lie to Pretrial Services that her only asset was her London
townhouse, the defendant provided a very different picture when seeking bail in December 2020.
The breakdown of the defendant’s finances provided then demonstrated that the defendant is a
remarkably wealthy woman. (See Dkt. No. 97, Ex. O). That wealth appears to have primarily
come from Epstein. The primary source of funds reflected in that financial breakdown was the
sale of the defendant’s Manhattan townhouse. Kate testified at trial that the defendant told Kate
that Epstein obtained the New York townhouse for the defendant. (Tr. 1194). Additionally, the
evidence at trial demonstrated that Epstein transferred a total of approximately $23 million to the
defendant. (PSR § 23). The defendant’s dishonesty surrounding her finances is an aggravating
factor weighing in favor of an above-Guidelines fine in this case. The defendant’s assets range in
