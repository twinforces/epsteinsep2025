DISCUSSION

Events in March 2011
15. The Brune & Richard Jawyers had no duty’to:reveal to the court. Tizaskoma’ s discovery:
ofa 2010 court order suspending a’ Bronx.lawyer with the same ‘name ‘as'juror Conrad. None-of
the lawyers had knowledge that the Bronx: lawyer and juror Conrad were’the same person. None
even had “clear and convincing” evidence.or “strongly suspected” — the objective. and subjective
tests. Doe rejected.— they were the samé-person. Trzaskoma and Brune: (who was told ofthe
discovery though not shown the: suspension order.that Trzaskoma discovered but did ‘not print)
‘resolved.to await juror Conrad’s voir dire answers. Those.answers, including j juror Conrad’s
Bronxville: address, directly contradicted any identity’ between the:juror. and. ‘the lawyer. ‘This.was:
conclusion would require: the lawyers to believe that: a: suspended lawyer would. repeatedly:
perjure herself in, federal court in order to siton.a jury.

Events in May 2011

16. Juror. Conrad gave the Court a note asking, if the jury was going’'to be instructed on
‘vicarious liability and respondeat supérior. The:contents of the note led Trzaskoma, assisted by
others at the-firm, to take another look at the issue the :next day. The 2010 suspension:order and:
an earlier. suspension order from 2007 were found. Both identified a Bronx lawyer. A. paralegal
discovered the Westlaw profile and forwarded it to Trzaskoma in an email that highlighted
selected information. After seeing the selected. information but before reviewing the:entire
profile, Trzaskoma-wrote “Jesus, I-do think it’s:her,” but then, after reviewing the entire-profile,
changed ‘her mind in light of the contradiction betwéén the juror’s voir'dire answers:and ‘the
limited information about lawyer Conrad (different levels of education, different: addresses, etc.).
In.addition, Trzaskoma did not: believe that the given.age of the Bronx lawyer agreed with the
apparent age of juror Conrad.

17... Trzaskoma-discussed the issue’ with Brune.and Edelstein later in the day..All three
-concluded ‘that j juror Conrad was not the suspended, lawyeér.. Co=counsel with: whom. the.matter

* was thereafter‘informally discussed thought:the question:not worth pursuing... Because the Brune
& Richard lawyers didnot believe —let:alone have actual knowledge — that the juror and ‘the
suspended lawyer were the:same person, they did not present their information to the:Court. At

' least five lawyers, based'on what they had seen or béeri told, reached this conclusion.

18. At this ‘time, ‘asearlicr; no Brine & Richard lawyer had actual knowledge that;juror
Conrad ‘was aawyer Conrad. Actual: now edge | is the: mental state. that creates’ the disclosure duty

19. Any notion'that: silence was intended ‘to preserve uridetected. a basis for a.new trial motion
in'the event of conviction is belied by the.lawyers’ actions. There‘was sno effort to seek ‘a:new
