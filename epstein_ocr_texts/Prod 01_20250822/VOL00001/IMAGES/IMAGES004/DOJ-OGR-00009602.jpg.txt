a factual matter, the record is crystal clear that these witnesses were not with the defendant and
Epstein at “every moment” during the period charged in the Indictment. See Pierre-Louis, 2018
WL 4043140, at *4. It would thus be “impossible” for them “to testify that [the] defendant did not

an irreplaceable way that would have helped, rather than hurt, her. Cornielle, 171 F.3d at 752.

has not set forth what Pinto and Salhi would have attested to had the charges been brought sooner.
Moreover, at trial, the defendant cross-examined other employees who worked for Epstein during
the relevant time periods—such as Juan Alessi and pilots Larry Visoski and David Rodgers—and
