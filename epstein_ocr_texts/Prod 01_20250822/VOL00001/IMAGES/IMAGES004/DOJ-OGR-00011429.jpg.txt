impeachment evidence constitutes exculpatory evidence that must be disclosed. The disclosure
of impeachment evidence, where ‘the [g]overnment’s case depended almost entirely on [the
victim’s] testimony,’ goes to the heart of Brady and Giglio.” (quoting Giglio v. United States,
405 U.S. 150, 154-55 (1972))).°

Lastly, Ms. Maxwell has a constitutional right to compulsory process, U.S. Const. amend.
VI, which includes the ability to compel production of relevant documents. See Nixon, 418 U.S.
at 711.

B. The materials requested are relevant.

The standard for relevance is “very low,” United States v. White, 692 F.3d 235, 246 (2d
Cir. 2012) (explaining that Rule 401 prescribes a “very low standard”), and the definition of
relevance is “very broad,” United States v. Certified Envil. Servs., Inc., 753 F.3d 72, 90 (2d Cir.
2014). “Evidence is relevant if: (a) it has any tendency to make a fact more or less probable than
it would be without the evidence; and (b) the fact is of consequence in determining the action.”
Fed. R. Evid. 401. “To be relevant, evidence need not be sufficient by itself to prove a fact in
issue... .” United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102, 132 (2d Cir. 2010).

Moreover, materials don’t magically lose their relevance simply because other evidence
might also be relevant to the same issue. Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 179 (1997)

3 See also United States v. Petrillo, 821 F.2d 85, 90 (2d Cir. 1987) (explaining that
impeachment evidence of uncorroborated testimony is material where the witness “whose
credibility was at issue supplied the only evidence linking the defendant[] to the crime”); Grant
v. Alldredge, 498 F.2d 376, 382 (2d Cir. 1974) (finding Brady violation occurred where the
prosecution did not disclose that a witness identified someone other than the accused); United
States v. Wilkins, 326 F.2d 135, 140 (2d Cir. 1964) (where the state’s case depended on the
positive identification by two witnesses, the existence of two other witnesses who would testify
the defendant was not the perpetrator of the crime was material).
