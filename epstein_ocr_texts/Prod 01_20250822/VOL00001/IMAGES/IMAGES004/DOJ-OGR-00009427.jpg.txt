2 REDIRECT EXAMINATION

a BY MR. SHECHTMAN:

4 Q. Mr. Schoeman, just to be clear, on May 13th or sometime

3 thereafter Ms. Trzaskoma told you that she had rejected the

6 conclusion that Juror No. 1 was a suspended attorney, is that
7 correct?

8 Asus Yes,

9 MR. SHECHTMAN: Very good.

16 MR. OKULA: Nothing else, your Honor.

UL THE COURT: Mr. Schoeman, did you get any

12 understanding from Ms. Trzaskoma as to why it was that she was
13 sharing this information or her deliberative process with you?
14 THE WITNESS: I didn't have an understanding. We,

15 having spent many months of trial together, often shared

16 information. It was consistent with our pattern of sharing

17 information during the course of the trial. But I have

18 described I think the entirety of the conversation.
