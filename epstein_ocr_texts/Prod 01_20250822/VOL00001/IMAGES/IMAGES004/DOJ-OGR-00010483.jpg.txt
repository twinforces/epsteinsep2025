ended. In fact, she has been involved in two committed, long-term, loving relationships with men
who had young children. She is not a danger to the community and there is no concern about
recidivism.

In imposing an appropriate sentence, we urge the Court to credit a number of factors:

=» Ms. Maxwell is being sentenced for non-violent offenses which occurred
decades ago (1994 to 2004).

= Ms. Maxwell is over 60 years old.

=» Ms. Maxwell is not a danger to the community in any way.

= Ms. Maxwell has no prior criminal history or prior bad acts.

=» Ms. Maxwell has served the entirely of pre-sentence detention during the
COVID pandemic.

= Ms. Maxwell served 22 months of pre-sentence detention under extraordinarily
abnormal and restrictive conditions of solitary confinement as a non-violent
defendant who posed no danger to herself or others.

=" Ms. Maxwell is being sentenced solely for reasons of punishment.

= Ms. Maxwell is not being sentenced for rehabilitation.

= Ms. Maxwell poses no risk of recidivism.

In addition, Ms. Maxwell’s personal characteristics and history of lawful behavior pre- and
and post-dating the offense conduct further distinguishes her situation and warrants sentencing
consideration.

Probation recognizes that a downward variance is warranted in this case. However,
noticeably absent from Probation’s justification is any mention of detention served during the
pandemic and under harsh conditions of solitary confinement. A poll taken of the CJA Panel and
Federal Defenders of the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York has resulted in no cases
where Probation has referenced conditions of confinement or COVID, despite requests by defense
