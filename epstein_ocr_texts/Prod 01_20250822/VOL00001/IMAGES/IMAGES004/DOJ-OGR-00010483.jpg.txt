defendant: who posed. no danger to herself or others.

a Ms. Maxwell is being sentenced solely for reasons of punishment:

a Ms. Maxwell is not.being sentenced for rehabilitation.

‘consideration.

Probation ‘recognizes. that a downward. variance is warranted. in, this. casc. However,
noticéably absent from Probation’s justification is any mention of detention served during the:
pandemic and under harsh. conditions of solitary:confinement. A:poll taken ofthe CJA. Panel and.
Federal, Defenders of the Southern, and Eastern, Districts, of New York has resulted.in ‘no cases.
