‘When you did that, Ghislaine, you changed the course of our lives forever. You joked that.
you were like a new mother to ‘us. As a'woman, | think. you understood the damage_you_were
causing—the price you were making ‘us victims pay. You. could have put.an end ol the:
molestations, the sickening manipulations | that-you.arranged, witnessed and even took. part:in. You.
could’ve called the authorities and, reported that you were a part-of something awful.

T'was young and naive when we-met, Ghislaine, but you knew that. In fact, you. were
counting’on it. My life.as a young person was just beginning. You-robbed me of:that by exploiting
my hopes and.ambitions.

Ghislaine, the pain you have caused, me is ‘almost. indescribable: ‘Because of your, choices
and. the; world ‘you, brought..me into, | don’t slecp. Nightmares wake me at all hours. In those
dreams, | rélive. the awful things ‘you. and. others did 'to.me and the things, you forced me, to do.
Those ‘memories: will never go away. I have trouble :mecting new people without questioning if
somehow they are going, to hurt me, too. I don’t allow: my: children. to stay over at fricnds’ houses,
or to walk down the street.alone: I ‘don’t trust. anyone to be near them without me or: ‘my husband.
close by: am hyper-vigilant, because | know that; evil, exists. You, taught. me: that.

There is not a,day that goes by: that.1 don’t ask, “Why?” Why,, Ghislaine, did you. enjoy.
hurting us so:much? ||. worry every: single day and:night that you will g get. away-with it. and evade
being punished. | will worry about, that until you are brought fo justice. And. what should that.
justice look like? Ghislaine, you deserye'to spend the rest of your life in,a jail ecll. You, deserve to
be'trapped ina cage forever; just like you. trapped your victims.

But Ghislaine, I want you to know that while you tricd.to. break :me, you didn’t suceced.
Despite you, [have grown into a‘woman, ‘who‘tries'to dog good | in the world—a woman: who, on her
best. days, fecls like she is'‘making a difference. My promise to you is as. follows: As long as you.
and.‘perpctrators, like you, continue to prey upon the ‘vulnerable, I will not stop standing ‘up and
speaking out. Together; with so many others ‘you abused, we will do all we can to keep predators
from stealing x the innocence of children. I will never give up. I'will never go away. Ifyou ever get
‘out of-prison, I will be: here, watching you,. making. sure you never hurt anyone. else: again.

Thank. you, your, honor.

Respectfully,

Sigrid S. McCawley
