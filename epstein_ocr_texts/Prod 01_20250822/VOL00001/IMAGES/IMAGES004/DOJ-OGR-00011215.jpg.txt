RE: 44 KINNERTON STREET, LONDON SWi
POSSIBLE VOLUNTARY FREEHOLD TRANSFER
Thank you for your recent enquiry regarding Miss Maxwell's interest in the possibility of
purchasing the freehold of the above property on a voluntary basis.
Grosvenor currently has a policy where we are willing to quote terms to lessees who have
leases which were originally granted for more than 21 years. The terms reflect the right under
the Leasehold Reform Act 1967 {as amended).
We charge a valuation fee of £2,000 plus VAT (£2,350) payable in advance for preparing this
quotation which will be reimbursed if the matter proceeds to completion. Please can you send
a cheque payable to Eaton Square Properties Ltd and marked for my attention. We will send
you a receipted invoice with our written quotation.
Once | have received the above fee and relevant documentation the next stage of the process
is for us to inspect the property and ! should be grateful for notification of how this can best be
arranged. | will be accompanied at this inspection by Paul Tayler who gives his Input on
market values. | confirm that we approach our valuation to the premium payable on a similar
basis to that laid down by the Leasehold Reform legislation,
| look forward to receiving our valuation fee and any other relevant documentation in order
that we can progress matters.
