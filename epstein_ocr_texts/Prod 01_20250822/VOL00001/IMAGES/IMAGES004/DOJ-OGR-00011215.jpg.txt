quotation which wil be reimbursed if the matter proceeds to completion, Please can you send
a cheque payable to Eaton Square Properties Ltd and marked for my attention. We will send
you a receipted invoice with our written quolation.

Is for us to inspect the property and I should be graleful for nolification of how this can best be
arranged. | willbe accompanied at this Inspection by Paul Tayler who gives his Input on:
