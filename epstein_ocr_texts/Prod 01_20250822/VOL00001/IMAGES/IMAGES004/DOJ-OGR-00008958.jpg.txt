Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document600_ Filed 02/11/22 Page 34 of 37
the defense had substantial reason to believe that Epstein did not start living in the 71 Street
townhouse until the beginning of 1996. Had property records for the 71*' Street townhouse been
available, they could have rebutted Jane’s testimony and challenged the accuracy of her
recollection.

Similarly, when Jane testified about her trip to Epstein’s ranch in New Mexico when she
was “15 or 16,” she recalled staying at a “giant ranch sort of in the middle of nowhere ... [which]
seemed very empty on the interior.” Tr. 321. From her description, it is clear that Jane was
referring to the large ranch house that Epstein constructed on the property, and not the triple-
wide trailer where he stayed while the large house was under construction. The defense had
significant reason to believe that the large ranch house was not completed until the end of the
1990s, when Jane would have been closer to 18 or 19 years old. But because property records
showing the dates of construction were not available, the defense could not challenge Jane’s
recollection with contrary documentary evidence.

E. Deceased Witnesses

Finally, in the over 20-year period that elapsed from the time of the charged conduct to
the time of trial, numerous potential witnesses who could have provided evidence contradicting
the government’s proof had died. In addition to the ones already mentioned in our previous
filings, the following individuals, among others, were no longer available to the defense:

e Alberto Pinto and Roger Salhi — Mr. Pinto and Mr. Salhi were architects who
built, renovated, and decorated many of Epstein’s residences, including the house
in Palm Beach, the New York residence, and the ranch in New Mexico. The
defense believes they could have established (i) when Epstein moved into the 71“
Street townhouse and what it looked like inside over the relevant time period, (ii)
when the large ranch house was built, and (iii) that the Palm Beach residence was
being renovated for almost a year in the mid-1990s and that Epstein had to move
into a rental house during renovation. All of this evidence would have cast
significant doubt on Jane’s recollection of events.
