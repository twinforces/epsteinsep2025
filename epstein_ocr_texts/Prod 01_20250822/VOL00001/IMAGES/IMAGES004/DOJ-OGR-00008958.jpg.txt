Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document600 _ Filed 02/11/22 Page 34 of 37

the defense had substantial. reason, to believe that, Epstein did:not start'living in the 7:1" Strect
townhouse until the beginning of 1996. Had.property records for the 715" Street townhouse been
available, they could have rebutted Jane’s testimony and challenged:the accuracy of her
recollection.

Similarly, ‘when.Jaie testified about her trip to Epstein’s ranch. in New. Mexico when she
was “1S5'or 16,” she recalled staying at a “giant ranch, sort.of inthe middle of:nowhere:..... [which]
secmed very. empty..on the interior.” Tr. 321. From-her description, it is clear that Jane’ was
referring:to the large ‘ranch house that Epstein constructed on the-property,, and:not the triple-
wide trailer where he’ stayed while the large house was under construction. The defense had
significant reason to believe that the large ranch. house was not.completed until the end of the
1990s, when Jane would have'been closer'to 18 or 19 years old. But because:property records
showing the dates of construction were'not available, the defense could not;challenge Jane’s
recollection with contrary ‘documentary evidence.

Finally, im the over 20-year period that clapsed, fron the time of the charged conduct, to
the time of trial, numerous potential-witnesses who could have provided evidence contradicting
the government’s proof had dicd.. ‘In‘addition to the ones already mentioned in our previous
filings, the following individuals, among, others, were no, loriger available to, the defense:

o Alberto Pinto and Roger Salhi = Mr. Pinto and. Mr. Salhi were-architects who
built, renovated, and. decorated-many of Epstcin’s residences, including the house
in Palm. Beach, the New York residence, andthe ranch in. New Mexico. The
defense belicves they could have established (1) when Epstein. moved into the 7.1~
Street townhouse and what it looked.Jike inside over the relevant time period, (11)
‘when the large ranch-house'was built, and (111) that the Palm. Beach. residence was
being renovated ‘for alniost.a year in the mid-1990s and;that Epstein had.to move

into a:rental house during renovation. All of this:evidence would.have. cast
significant doubt on Janc’s recollection. of events.
