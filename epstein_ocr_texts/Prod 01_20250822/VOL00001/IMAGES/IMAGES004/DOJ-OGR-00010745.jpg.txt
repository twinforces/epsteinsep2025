Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 682 Filed 06/24/22 Page 2 of 4.

The Defendant contests whether the remaining ‘four individuals—Maria, Farmer, Sarah.
Ransome, Teresa Helm, and Juliette Bryant—are “crime victims” within the meaning, of the
CVRA. The'Defendant contends, among other things, that the record.docs not establish, that they
were under the’ relevant: statutory age at the time of the incidents they describe or that; the conduct
occurred ‘within the time period charged in the indictment and-established. at trial. However, the
Court necd ‘not resolve this question, because “the sentencing court’s diserction is largely
unlimited. cither as to’the kind, of information.it.may consider; or the source from ‘which. it:may
come.” United States v.. Eberhard, 525 F.3d 175, 1.77 (2d:Cir..2008) (cleaned up). ‘Indeed, 18
US.C. § 366], provides that:“[n]Jo limitation shall be placed, onthe information, concerning the
background, character, and:conduct ofa person convieted of an offense which a court ofthe,
United States may: receive and consider for thepurpose of imposing an appropriate sentence.”
Sée; e.g, United Siales v., Garigen,; No. 21=112, 2022. WL 258568, at *1 (2d Cir. Jan.'28, 2022)
(summary: order) (finding no duc process violation in.allowing individual to speak at sentencing
even assuming they lacked “an express right... .. under the [CVRA].” because “the court was
certainly within its:power to'permit them to speak” under § 3661 and.dcfendant, “clearly was free
to object or respond:to any of the:statements that [individuals] made during her sentencing, and
the district court was permitted.to consider all of these statements.as relevant in, formulating a
Sentence” (cleaned up)).

Accordingly, the Court, exercising its diserction under § 3661, will permit Maria:Farmcr,
Ransome, Helm, and Bryant.to be reasonably heard at. sentencing through written submissions.
The Court will-therefore. allow: their written-submissions to be part of the record and consider
them for what they appropriately may: be considered, The Court,will, however, exercise its

diserction.and deny their requests to make an. in-pérson statement, to the: extent. they so request.
