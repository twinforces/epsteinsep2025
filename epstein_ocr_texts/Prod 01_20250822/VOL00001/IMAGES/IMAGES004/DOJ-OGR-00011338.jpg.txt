For another'thing, evidence that Ms. Maxwell did, not purchase the Kinnerton Street
homeruntil. 1996 is publicly available and accessible via the internet.? The government could
hhave:asked those same investigators to obtain;property records. Further, the government has' the
ability: to avail itself of a Mutual Legal Assistance: Treaty (MLAT), an agreement; between the
United States and United.Kingdom.and an investigatory tool frequently used. by the government
for the purpose of gathering and exchanging information with the United Kingdom in the course’
of criminal investigations.

Now'that:the: date of Ms. Maxwell’s purchase:of.Kinnerton Street:is relevant, Ms.
Maxwell has requested ‘these registry entrics. from Her Majesty’s Land Registry: These entries:
Show the transfer of title. of 44 Kinnerton Street:to, Ghislaine Maxwell in. March, 1997 after the.
as she’ has, them.

In addition, just this: morning,, Ms.. Maxwell. obtained a copy of'the Transfer of Title: for
Kinnerton Strect to Ms. Maxwell. Ms. Maxwell, provided this document to the government
within thrée hours of first: récciving it. Thus, onee it became clear'that the: 1996 Agreement was
relevant, it took, just days. for Ms. Maxwell to obtain independently relevant and admissible:
evidence, proving the same‘point—that Kate testificd'to an, impossibility. Because’ the
government has reccived a copy of the Transfer of Title, and because Ms. Maxwell will
immediately produce the public records she obtains from the‘Land Registry, the government

cannot-claim to be prejudiced by the discovery of the 1996 Agreement.
