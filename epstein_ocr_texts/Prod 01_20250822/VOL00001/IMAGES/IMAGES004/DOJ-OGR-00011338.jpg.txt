For another thing, evidence that Ms. Maxwell did not purchase the Kinnerton Street
home until 1996 is publicly available and accessible via the internet.? The government could
have asked those same investigators to obtain property records. Further, the government has the
ability to avail itself of a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), an agreement between the
United States and United Kingdom and an investigatory tool frequently used by the government
for the purpose of gathering and exchanging information with the United Kingdom in the course
of criminal investigations.

Now that the date of Ms. Maxwell’s purchase of Kinnerton Street is relevant, Ms.
Maxwell has requested these registry entries from Her Majesty’s Land Registry. These entries
show the transfer of title of 44 Kinnerton Street to Ghislaine Maxwell in March 1997 after the
1996 Agreement for Sale. Ms. Maxwell will provide these documents to the government as soon
as she has them.

In addition, just this morning, Ms. Maxwell obtained a copy of the Transfer of Title for
Kinnerton Street to Ms. Maxwell. Ms. Maxwell provided this document to the government
within three hours of first receiving it. Thus, once it became clear that the 1996 Agreement was
relevant, it took just days for Ms. Maxwell to obtain independently relevant and admissible
evidence proving the same point—that Kate testified to an impossibility. Because the
government has received a copy of the Transfer of Title, and because Ms. Maxwell will
immediately produce the public records she obtains from the Land Registry, the government
cannot claim to be prejudiced by the discovery of the 1996 Agreement.
