F.2d 660, 662 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam), Count Three and Count Five are multiplicitous. The
Court should therefore enter judgment only on Count Three.°

A. The Criminal Offenses Charged
The government argues that the differences between the offenses charged in Count Three
and Count Five are fatal to the defense’s multiplicity argument. Not so.° Count Five is not a
distinct conspiracy simply because it alleged a different statutory object than Count Three, as the
government claims. (Opp. at 27). If that were the case, the government would never have
conceded that Counts One and Three were multiplicitous because they, too, alleged different
statutory objects. Count One alleged a conspiracy to violate the enticement statute (18 U.S.C. §
2422), while Count Three alleged a conspiracy to violate the transportation statute (18 U.S.C. §
2423(a)). (Ind. 99 11-12, 17-18). Moreover, each of these statutory objects has different
elements. For example, enticement does not require actual travel in interstate commerce,
whereas transportation does. (Compare Instr. 14 with Instr. 19). Enticement requires persuasion
or inducement to travel, whereas transportation does not. U/d.) Transportation (in this case)
requires that the defendant know that the individual transported was under the age of seventeen,
whereas enticement does not. (/d.). These legal distinctions are no less significant than the
distinctions between Count Three and Count Five that were highlighted by the government —
e.g., the age of consent was seventeen for Count Three and eighteen for Count Five, and Count
> As discussed further below, the conspiracy charged in Count Five is a smaller subset of the larger conspiracy
charged in Count Three. The Court should therefore enter judgment on Count Three.
6 The government suggests that the defense deliberately asked the Court to ignore this factor to avoid the Court’s
consideration of it. That is absolutely incorrect. The first Korfant factor, as set forth in the Korfant case itself, is
“the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments.” Korfant, 771 F.2d at 662 (emphasis added). Hence, it
was not evident that this factor applied in cases where the multiplicitous counts were in the same indictment. The
defense accepts that the Second Circuit has applied this factor in such cases and the Court may consider it here. See
United States v. Guzman, 7 F. App’x 45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2001). But this factor is by no means fatal to the defense’s
multiplicity argument.
