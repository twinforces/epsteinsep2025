F.2d 660, 662 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam), Count‘Three and Count Five arc multiplicitous. ‘The
Court should thercfore enter'judgment only on Count Three”

A. The Criminal Offenses Charged

The government. argucs that-the differences between the offenses charged in Count Three
and Count Five are fatal to the defense’s multiplicity argument. Not so.* Count.Five is:not.a
distinct conspiracy simply: because it, alleged a, different, statutory object than Count Three, as the
government claims. (Opp. at.27). If that Were the casc, the goverfiment would never have
conceded that Counts One:and Three were multiplicitous because they, too, alleged different
statutory objects. Count One alleged, a conspiracy ‘to violate the: enticement; statute (1.8 ULS.C. §
2422), while Count Three alleged a conspiracy to violate the transportation statute (18 U.S.C. §
2423(a)). (Ind. 44 11-12, (17-18). Moreover, cach of these statutory: objects: has different
elements. For example, enticement. does not require actual travel in ‘interstate commerce,
whereas transportation.does. (Compare Instr. 14 with Instr. 19). Enticement requires persuasion
‘or inducement-to travel, whereas transportation, docs not., (/d.), ‘Transportation (in this casc)
requires that. the defendant know that'the individual transported ‘was ‘under’ the age of seventecn,
whereas enticement does not. (/d.). These legal. distinctions are no less significant than the
distinctions. between Count Three and’Count Five that were highlighted’by the government —

e.g., the age. of consent was seventecn, for Count Three-and cighteen. for Count'Five, and Count

® Asdiscussed, further below, the conspiracy charged in Count Five is;a smaller, subset of'theslarger conspiracy:
charged in:‘Count Three. ‘The Court should.therefore enter judgment on Count Three.

6 The government suggests that the: defense deliberately asked the:Gourt to ignore’this: factor, to avoid the Court's
‘consideration oft. That is absolutely incorrect.. The first Korfanttactor, as set forthamthe Korfant case itself, is
“the criminal offenses'chargedsin successive midiciments.” ‘Korfant, 771, F.2d. at 662 (emphasis added). ‘Hence, it
was‘not evident.that this ‘factor applied:n cases where the*multiplicitous counts were inthe same indictment. The
idefense:accepts that.the Second Circuit. has:applied.this factoriin such cases and the: Court'may consider it here: See.
United States:v. Guzman, ‘1... App’x.45, 54-55 (2d Cir. 2001). ‘But this factor:is by*no means fatal.to-the defense’ s
multiplicity argument.
