district have ordered plaintiffs to produce their EVCP releases to Maxwell:(in one case with.the

amount:redaeted), so she is.already aware of the content of the EVCP’s general, release.”
Forcing the EVCP ‘to turh over:information, it-promised.all claimants. it would keep

confidential—an, indispensable condition that:victims relicd upon—would “disembowel, the very:

core” of this:program and others. like it.*°

‘Compliance would be unreasonable and oppressive
and, accordingly, this: Court-should. quash the subpoena.
B. The documents soughtare inadmissible under Vederal Rule of Evidence 408.

The subpoena should, also be: quashed. becausé the records sought,are inadmissible under
Federal Rule of Evidence 408. ‘Rule 17(c), in. gencral, authorizes subpoenas returnable before
trial, as well as ‘subpoenas returnable at trial “to obtain impeachment material.” UWnifed States v.
Donziger, No. 19-CR-561 (LAP), 2021. WL 1865376, at *4 (S:D.N:Y. May 10, 2021). The test.
set forth in Nixon “governs both varictics” of subpoenas. Denziger, 2021, WL.1865376, at *4.
Under Nixon, the subpocna must “clear three hurdles: (1) relevancy; (2) admissibility; (3)
specificity.” Nixon, 418 U.S. at.700.. Here, Maxwell’s subpoena fails, at a:minimum, to clear the
admissibility hurdle, because Rule 408 makes the documents sought largely, if not entirely,
‘inadmissible.

Under. Rule 408(a), evidence: of accepting a valuable consideration to compromise a
claim, as well as statements or conduct made in connection with negotiations about the claim, are
“not, admissible—on behalf of any party—cither'to prove or disprove'the validity or amount. of a
disputed claim.or to impeach by a:prior inconsistent statement or a contradiction.” Fed. R. Evid.

408(a). Inadmissibility under, Rule 408 provides .a, basis to quash.a Rule 1'7(c) subpoena. See
