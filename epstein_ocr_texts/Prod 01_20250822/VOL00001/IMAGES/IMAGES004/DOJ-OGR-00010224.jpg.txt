7 Q. You said stepbrother?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. I'm going to ask you to look at question 48B. Question 48B
10 reads: If your answer to 48 was yes, do you believe this would
11 affect your ability to serve fairly and impartially as a juror
12 in this case?

13 When you filled this out on November 4, you left that
14 blank. What is an accurate answer to 48B?
15 A. It would have been no, because it did not affect my ability
16 to be fair and impartial at all.
17 Q. I'm going to ask you to turn to page 13 of the
18 questionnaire. Question 25 reads: Have you or any of your
19 relatives or close friends ever been a victim of a crime?

al November 4. Is no an accurate answer?
22 A. Looking back at it now, no, it's an incorrect answer.
23 Q. Who would have an accurate answer have been?
24 A. It would have been yes.
25 Q. Yes self, yes friend or family?
