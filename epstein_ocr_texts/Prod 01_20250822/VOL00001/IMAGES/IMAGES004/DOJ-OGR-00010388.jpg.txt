126.F.3d 105, 109 (2d.Cir. 1997). “[W]hen the ‘charge upon,which the defendant is tried. differs
significantly from, the charge upon which the grand jury voted,” a constructive: amendment.
oceurs and reversal is:required. Wnited States v.. Khalupsky,,5 F Ath 279,.293 (2d Cir..2021).

that, upon revicw, it is‘uncertain. whether the :defendant-was convicted. of conduct that:was the
‘subject. of the grand jury’s indictment.” United States y. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 608, 620:(2d Cir.

225 (2d Cir. 2016) (alteration in original) (quoting United States v. D’ Amelio; 683, F.3d 412,418
(2d Cir. 2012)). The Court then determines whether the evidence or jury instructions at trial

that core, but' instead of'a crime, “distinctly different.” J) ’Amelio, 683 F.3d.at 416,419. The
Sccond Circuit has “consistently permitted significant flexibility in proof, provided that:the

defendant was given notice of the core of criminality to be ‘proven at trial.” United States v.
