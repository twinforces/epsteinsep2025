segregated due to the high-profile nature of her case is belied by the fact that the case and the
inmate are still high profile, yet Ms. Maxwell is now in general population.

If a restriction or condition is not reasonably related to a legitimate goal — if it is arbitrary
and purposeless- a court may infer that the purpose of the governmental action is punishment and
may not constitutionally be inflicted upon detainees. Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 539 (1979).
Failing to implement reasonable alternatives suggests that the decision to keep her restricted was
made with no legitimate penological purpose and amounts to impermissible punishment.”
Proportionality Supports a Hard-Time Credit

The principle of proportionality — a core principle of the Eighth Amendment 7? and U.S.
Sentencing Guidelines 74 - requires that sentences should be relative to the crimes committed.”>
The Guidelines Manual states that one of the objectives at the core of the Sentencing Reform Act
is “proportionality in sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately different sentences
for criminal conduct of differing severity.” 7° If inmates in isolation or supermax detention suffer
*? Excepting inmates charged with terrorism, disciplined for severe institutional infractions and violence,
and Mexican drug lord “El Chapo”, Ms. Maxwell has been subjected to the most unusual and punitive form
of pretrial detention. Accordingly, it is appropriate to make a sentencing submission that exposes the
unfairness of her detention in the hope that the government (e.g., DOJ, BOP, and prosecutors) not repeat
such disparate treatment and courts recognize that it cannot abandon its supervisory powers to permit BOP
bureaucrats to exercise administrative measures without accountability.

* “Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments
inflicted.” U.S. Const. amend xiii.
“USSG, Part A, §§ 2-5 (2021).
*> See Solem v. Helm, 463 U.S. 277, 284-90 (1983) (discussing the longstanding principle that a punishment
should be proportionate to the crime).
°° USSG, Part A, §3. The most basic objective is to “combat crime through an effective, fair sentencing
system” through (i) honesty in sentencing (that is, removing the power of the parole commission to reduce
the term to be served); (11) reasonable uniformity in sentencing - by reducing the wide disparity of sentences
for similar offenses; and (iii) proportionate sentences. See id. at §§2-3.
