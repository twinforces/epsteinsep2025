1 (In open court)

2 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge?

3 THE COURT: Just a moment.

4 Yes, Ms. Sternheim.

5) MS. STERNHEIM: I'm just inquiring if that format was
6 satisfactory to the Court.

7 THE COURT: I think so.

8 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.

9 THE COURT: I think the information I'm getting is

10 that we're missing three jurors who are not yet accounted for
11 on the security line.

12 (Pause)

13 THE COURT: Current status is we're missing one juror
14 from the fifth floor, and two from the first floor. I think
15 we'll give it five more minutes and then I'll move one juror
16 from the first floor to the fifth floor, unless counsel has

17 concerns with that. And I'm not going to tell you who the

18 juror is yet.

19 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, we would just ask whether the
20 Court has attempted to call the missing jurors.
21 THE COURT: That's happening now.
22 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.
