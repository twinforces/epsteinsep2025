The CVRA guarantees crime victims the::tight to “reasonably -heard at any: public

United States v: Degenhardt, 405 'F.Supp.2d 1341 (D. Utah 2005). Various courts: have held that:
the:‘CVRA right to be reasonably. heard, guarantecs ‘victims the right'to, make an in-court:statement.

with the defendant, defense counsel, and. the -prosccutor, rather than ‘turned into a ‘faceless
stranger.’”” Degenhardt, 405 F:Supp.2d at 1348 (quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808,825

of’ Sen. Kyl, agreed to by Sen. Feinstein). Congress ‘understood. that it was extending :rights to
“literally millions of'people”—i.c., victims who were being denied rights in the: federal. criminal.
