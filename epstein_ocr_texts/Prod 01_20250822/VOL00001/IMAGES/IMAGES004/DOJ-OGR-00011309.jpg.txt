Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document714_ Filed.07/12/22 Page 6of7

the Marin.Act with the New York’ state law (including the New York age of consent) as. its object,
‘or for-violations of § 159], and conspiracy‘to commit:those offenses. There is accordingly: no:risk,
‘that the jury will convict-the defendant.for violating an unidentified local sex’ crimes, law for which
the Minor Victim was above'the age of consent. As a result, the Government:respectfully requests
that the Court refrain from ‘giving the second. limiting instruction.atall during this trial.

If the Court nevertheless decides 'to give the second limiting instruction, the Government:
proposes the following revision to give the jury an understanding both of. what is and what is. not
illegal sexual activity:

Lanticipate that’you. will hear testimony from the next witness about. scxual.conduct
that she says she had, with .Mr. Epstein | in. [insert relevant jurisdiction, c.g. New
Mexico]. ‘instruct you that if and. when, because the witness was over the age of
consent; in [insert relevant jurisdiction, ‘e.g. New Mexico] .at. the relevant time
period, the sexual conduct she’ says, occurred’with Mr. Epstein: was not itself “illegal
sexual activity” as the Government’ has charged.:in ‘the. Indictment. [The age of
consent in that jurisdiction ‘is [insert relevant age of consent or analysis.
thereof]]. Howcver, to. the extent: you conclude: that her testimony: Is: relevant to:
the issues before you, including the.defendant’s intent for that witness to engage
in illegal ‘sexual activity. in New York as charged in the, Indictment, you ‘may:
consider it. Even ‘when the ‘witness was over the age of consent in [insert
relevant jurisdiction, e.g., New Mexico], at the relevant time period, you may
conclude that the’ witness was below the: age of ‘consent in. New York, which is
17 years old. [For witnesses relevant, to the sex, trafficking counts: Further,
the sexual conduct, may: be considered, in determining whether the defendant:
intended the witness to engage ina “commercial sex act” before. reaching the
age of 18, and for which the age of consent :in [insert relevant jurisdiction] is
irrelevant.| However, you ‘may not. consider this testimony :regarding sexual
activity. that took: place above the age of consent. with respect to the relevant.
statute as I have just described it as any kind of reflection, on, Mr. Epstein’s nor
Ms. Maxwell’s character or propensity to commit. any’ of the crimes, charged in, the:
Tndictment.

The ‘proposed -revision ‘provides the jury’ with, information that matches: the expected.
testimony; provides the jury with sufficient. context about the question. before it'to, avoid.confusion

about how it can and :cannot.consider the ‘sexual activity; avoids an‘inaccurate statement of state:
