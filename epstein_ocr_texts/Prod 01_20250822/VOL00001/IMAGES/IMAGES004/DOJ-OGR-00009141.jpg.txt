are few aspects of a jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would be less inclined to disturb a trial
judge’s exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in the
empanelling of a jury.’” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d at 172). This is because the district court
“observes the jury on a day to day basis” and therefore “is in the best position to sense the
atmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at 171 (quotations and citations omitted) .

How, then, would the Court have ruled on a hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 50
had disclosed that he was a survivor of sexual abuse? The Court’s decisions with respect to
similarly situated jurors provide clear evidence. Of the 58 jurors who were ultimately qualified,
eight jurors disclosed that they themselves had been a victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse,
or sexual assault. With respect to each, the Court asked a few follow-up questions (and sometimes
only one question), focusing on the ultimate issue of whether the juror could be fair and impartial
notwithstanding the juror’s experience. (See Nov. 16, 2021 Tr. at 18-19, 52-57, 200, 207-08, 259,
293, 532, 635). In each case, the juror affirmed that he or she could be fair, and not only did the
Court not strike the juror for cause, neither party even moved to do so on these grounds. For good
reason: People who have experienced sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault can be
fair and impartial jurors.

Thus, if Juror 50 had disclosed a history of sexual abuse, the Court would not have
immediately granted a challenge for cause, as the defendant’s brief suggests. Instead, the Court
properly would have asked follow-up questions designed to determine whether Juror 50 could be
fair and impartial notwithstanding that experience and could decide the case based on the evidence
and the law. Here, because Juror 50 did not disclose any history of sexual abuse, the Court did not
have occasion to ask such follow-up questions. Accordingly, the Government believes that a
limited hearing is warranted to ask Juror 50 such questions. If Juror 50 credibly states that he
