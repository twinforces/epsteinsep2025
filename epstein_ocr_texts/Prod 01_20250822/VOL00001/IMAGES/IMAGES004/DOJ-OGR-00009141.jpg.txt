are few aspects of a.jury trial where [the Second Circuit] would, be less inclined.to disturb _a, trial.
judge’s Exercise of discretion, absent clear abuse, then in ruling on challenges for cause in. the
empanelling, ofa jury.”” Jd. (quoting Greer, 285 F.3d.at 172). This is because the district. court.
“observes the jury on ‘a, day to day basis” ‘and. therefore, “is in the best position to sense the
atmosphere of the courtroom.” Greer, 285 F.3d at ‘171 (quotations and citations omitted) .

How, then, would the Court have ruled on, a ‘hypothetical for cause challenge if Juror 50
had. disclosed that he was a survivor of scxual. abuse? The Court’s, decisions ‘with respect to
similarly situated jurors: provide clear evidence. ‘Of the $8.jurors who were ultimately qualified,

properly would have asked. follow-up questions ‘designed to determine whether. Juror 50 could be
fairand impartial:notwithstanding that experience ‘and could decide'the case based,.on the evidence:
andthe law. Here, because Juror 50 did not disclose. any history ofscxual abuse, the Court did not
have: oceasion. ‘to ask: such, follow-up questions. .Accordingly; the Government believes that a.

limited, hearing is warranted. to,ask Juror 50 such questions. If Juror 50 credibly states that. he
