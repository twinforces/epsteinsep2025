EXCLUSIVE: 'Ghislaine was a predator as guilty as Epstein’:
e e I ! e
Maxwell juror describes moment he ‘locked eyes’ with sex
trafficker and reveals his own abuse ordeal
* Scotty David , a juror in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial, was one of the 12 men and women who convicted Maxwell
on five of the six counts of sex-trafficking last week
¢ Scotty says he went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ but ‘After all
I've learned, she's just as guilty as Epstein. I don't want to call her a monster, but a predator is the right word
¢ During the trial Scotty, who works in finance, was seated in the third row of the jury box, in the back corner.
From his vantage point, he said, he had a vista of the entire court and the 'perfect view’ of Maxwell herself
* Scotty said that Maxwell's manner in court was discussed during deliberations. He said, 'We did discuss that
we thought she was a little standoffish and not necessarily cold, more like she was paying attention’
¢ Scotty revealed that he was not the only juror to share a story of sexual abuse and that it did not affect his
ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven guilty
¢ Scotty is completely satisfied that they reached the right verdict and that, with Maxwell's conviction, justice
has been done. He says that he believes she will spend the rest of her life in prison unless a deal is done
* He said, "It satisfies me to know that we did our due diligence and that we brought justice for these victims, for
these girls who are now women'

A juror in the Ghislaine Maxwell trial has revealed how he viewed her as a 'predator', describing the moment he
‘locked eyes' with Jeffrey Epstein's accomplice - and revealed his own child sex abuse ordeal to the jury.
Scotty David said he had helped the other members of the jury understand things from a victim's point of view
and explained how ‘you can't remember all the details' of traumatic memories - this was a crucial line of attack by
Maxwell's lawyers who called a ‘false memory' expert witness.
David also claimed that the five guilty verdicts returned in New York last week, possibly condemning Maxwell to
spend the rest of life behind bars, were for ‘all the victims’.
