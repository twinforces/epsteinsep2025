Robert Maxwell himself died in. 1991.
So you see how our families met, how we've all been friends for over 60 years:and ‘how I've

maintained.a close relationship with the Maxwell clan for most'of my life. Though I was spending

more of iy tithe With the-older siblings who were closest'to my age, I also-chose deliberately to spend

time as well with Ian, Kevin. and Ghislaine, from early on until they were soon going to'prep'school
together during term-time: You-may know that their-father'was narcissistic, demanding and highly
controlling: He letthem: know’early that-he was going to leave his large fortune to. charity. So, all the:
kids: kriew they had.to “iriake it on’their own” despite the wealth and privilege in which they were

growing up:

As I got'to know each.of these kids, including Ghislaine, I noticed that early on, every single one
worked very hard at:their jobs, as Bob wouldn't bear any idleness, and each strove for their father's and
tidther's respect through their intelligence and their own hatd'work. So it didn't surprise’me that in her
prep school classés, as well as her bachelor's work at Oxford, where Ghislainé had followed, her elder’
siblings, she produced exemplary grades. and a reputation as a.sérious. student. Lalso personally ‘noticed.
that Ghislaine was quick-witted,. smart, full of initiative and good humor, and sincetely caring towards

‘éveryone she knew.

So let me share, your Honor, my' core point-here. Ghislaine is.a very. smart atid sensitive person. I
observed this'since I met her at:age’5. I'vealready heard through her sister Isabel,that she -has-truly
regretted ever meeting Jeffrey Epstein. She has been severely punished with.nightly awakenings every

15 minutes in her years already now in jail. She lost:her bid:for retrial. Like other smart, insightful
