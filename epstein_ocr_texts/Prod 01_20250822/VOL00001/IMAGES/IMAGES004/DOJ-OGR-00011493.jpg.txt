e If you have not filed a lawsuit, legal action or claim against Jeffrey
Epstein and/or the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein and/or related entities and
individuals, and you have not been identified as a victim of Jeffrey Epstein
to the Administrator on or before June 25, 2020, you may also be eligible
to participate in the Program. You must first register to participate in this
Program on the Program website at www.EpsteinVCP.com.

To register, you must complete a Registration Form setting forth your
name, contact information, a summary description of the nature of your
claim and other requested information. Upon registration, the
Administrator will perform a preliminary review to consider if you are
eligible to participate in the Program. If the Administrator deems that you
are eligible to participate in the Program, she will then send to you a Claim
Form and other relevant Program information.
** Note: The fact that you are sent a Claim Form and other relevant
Program information indicates that the Administrator has determined
only that you are eligible to participate in the Program. It does not indicate
that the Administrator has determined that you are eligible to receive
compensation. That determination is made only after you submit the
Claim Form and all required documentation, and that information is
evaluated by the Administrator.
