appropriate sentence” (emphasis added). ‘The critical words, “no limitation,” grant:a-sentencing court
extremely broad discretionary authority to- consider wide-ranging unlimited information about
Maxwell’s “background, character, and conduet—crucial information clearly possessed by Sarah and
Elizabeth.
The Second. Circuit:has recognized the broad. scope of this provision. In. United States v.

Morrison, 778 F.3d 396, 400-01.(2d Cir, 2015), the Second. Gircuit noted. that section .3661
