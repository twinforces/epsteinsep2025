Sash), And even. when Guidelines commentary is explanatory and. binding, it is “akin.'to an
agency’s interpretation of its. own Icgislative rules,” and. therefore: docs not control. where it is
“inconsistent with the regulation.” Stinson ‘Vv: Wnited. States, 508 U.S. 36, 45 (1993) (quoting
Bowles ¥. Seminole Rock & Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945)).. Ifthe. Guidelines, commentary
were flatly-inconsistent-with the plain text of the Guideline its¢lf—because the Guideline squarely:
applies ‘where the commentary says it should not=the Guideline itself, would control. Sée Sash,
396 F.3d at 522 (“We need. not. resort to background commentary. interpretations when. ‘the

Finally, the defendant’s argument that the public docs not néed to be protected. from her is

III. ‘Discussion

A. ‘The Defendant’s Conduct Warrants a Term of Imprisonment Within the
‘Guidelines Range of 360:.to 660 Months’ Imprisonment

‘1. The Nate atid. Seriousness. of the Offense,

The defendant stands convicted of scxually: cxploiting:multiple underage girls. ‘Her'crimes

‘were monstrous, and the ‘Court should.impose a, sentence that reflects her role in scrious federal

+The: defendant also argues that application of the Guideline to her would yicld absurd results,

because'she would.have a lower sentencing range if she had been convicted of a: ‘prior sex offense,

and, (she claims), the same sentencing range that Epstein, would. face. (Def. Mem. 14-16). But
Section.4B1.5(a) is structured differently. than Scction.4B1..5(b), setting x floors, for the offense level
and.criminal history category rather than imposing a five-level ificrease. See U.S.S.G. Amend.

615. (explaining that.§ 4B11.5(a)’s penalties rely on the prior:conviction but §:4B1.5(b) docs not).

Because ‘the Guidelines have different structures, where—as here—a defendant iis near'the top of
the Guidclines by ‘virtue’ of her criminal, conduct. on her one and. only conviction, the five-level.
enhancement is more significant than § 4B1.5’s penalty floors. ‘That result is not- absurd, buta,
refléction. of the seriousness of the défendant’s conduct.
