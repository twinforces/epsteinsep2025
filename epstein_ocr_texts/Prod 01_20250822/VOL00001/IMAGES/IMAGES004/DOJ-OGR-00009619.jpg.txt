Re:  United.States’v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr.330(AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in. response to defense counsel's request
to adjourn the hearing currently scheduled.to occur on.March 8, 2022 to a.date in May 2022. (Dkt.
No. 627). The Government strongly opposes defense counscl’s request, as an. adjournment—Ict.
alone a-two-month‘adjournment—is not in-the interests of justice. As an initial matter, this case. is
scheduled for sentencing in June and. that date should not be delayed. The victims in. this case

Nearly one'wecek after the:Court issued its Opinion and Order scheduling the March 8,:2022
hearing (Dkt. No. 620),, defense counsel ‘filed its adjournment request, citing scheduling conflicts
of the defendant’s Colorado-based counsel. But the defendant is represented by multiple.attorneys,
at least two of whom are available.! Moreover, because the Court has alrcady:ruled that the Court
will:conduct:the questioning of Juror 50, and because the parties have had an.opportunity to submit.
questions for the Court’s consideration in,advanec of the hearing (/d., at 1.6-1'7), the defendant docs
' Defense counsel’s. letter notes that Ms. Sternhcim.has a trial..scheduled to start the following

week, on March. 1,6, 2022, but‘the Government notes that'Ms: Sternheim.is onc of multiple defense
attorneys in that case ‘as well.
