Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 642 Filed 03/11/22 Page 64 of 66

For its part, this Court.expressed “confidence” that its voir dire:process would
“smoke out” a.juror‘who was dishonest. Ms. Maxwell relied on the Court’s process. And
the Court and the parties relicd on. the presumption:to which. everyone is entitled: that
potential jurors would carefully and honestly engage in voir dire:

Unfortunately; we now know that Juror No. 50 (and at least one other juror) did
not-honor their obligations to give “only truthful answers.” Ex: 1, p 3. They are no longer
entitled to the presumption of honesty.

Because Ms. Maxwell’s jury was not the. fair and. impartial. one guaranteed her by
the United States Constitution, this Court.should vacate the jury’s verdict and, order anew
trial. In the alternative, this Court should hold an evidentiary hearing and éxamine all
twelve jurors.
