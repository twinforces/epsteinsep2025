2. Inferable bias

“Inferable’ or ‘inferred’ bias exists ‘when.a.juror:discloses a fact that bespeaks a
tisk of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant. granting the trial judge discretion, to
excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make mandatory a presumption of bias.’”
Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at.474 (quoting United States v. Greer, 285 F.3d 158, 1:71.
(2d Cir, 2002))..A, court should ‘dismiss:a. potential juror for inferable bias “after having
received responses, from the juror that permit an. inference that:the juror'in question would,
not.be able to decide the matter objectively.” Jorres, 128 F.3d.at 47. “[T]his is so even.

decide the case’ impartially.” /d.

“Moreover, once facts are élicited ‘that permit'a finding of inferable bias, then, just
as in the situation of implied bias, the juror’s statements as to his or her ability to be
impartial become irrelevant.” /d. “The crux.of the implied bias analysis in a case like this
one is. found in'an examination of the similarities between. the juror’s cxpericnecs and the
incident. giving rise to the trial.” 7orres, 128 F.3d.at 48 (quoting Gonzales. Thomas, 99
F.3d 978, 989 (10th Cir. 1.996)). Assuming this Court docs not imply’bias, it should
nevertheless infer bias.

In United States v. Lorres, the defendant'was convicted of conspiracy to launder
the proceeds of a heroin trafficking scheme by structuring financial transactions. 128 F.3d.
at 41. Over the defense’s objection, the district court (Judge Preska) dismissed for cause a
potential juror who admitted that she “had at'onc time engaged in the ‘structuring’ of

cash transactions.” /d. at 42.:On appeal, the Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that; the
