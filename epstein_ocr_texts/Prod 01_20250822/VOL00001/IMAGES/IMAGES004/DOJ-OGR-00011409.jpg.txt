Jane will prevent-her from committing a-crime that would cause death or great’bodily harm.
Accordingly, Mr. Glassman cannot. testify about any communication he allegedly had with Jane
without violating, Rule 1.6.

Additionally, Mr. Glassman's testimony would’be wholly irrelevant. Ms. Maxwell, claims
the statement in.Ms. Moc’s email is relevant for only*two reasons: (1) “Jane’s motive to
cooperate and-testify,” and (2) “her memory and capacity as a witness since she cannot recall. a
highly consequential, conversation she just; had months ago.” (Maxwell Motion at 1-2). Both
alleged reasons are based on a faulty premise and_are factually’ untruc..

The August.'1.7, 2021 email from:Ms. Moe expressly states that the alleged statement at.
issuc occurred. before Ms. Maxwell was criminally charged —:rot “just ... months ago” in August’
2021.-- as Ms. Maxwell. appcars to insinuate. Ms. Maxwell.was arrested.and charged.on July 2,
2020 — more than. a year before the email ‘from Ms. :Moe was. written.

Jane's civil case settled of December 11, '2020—8, months’ before Ms. Moc’s émail was.
written,and approximately a year before she testificd.at'this trial. Accordingly, ‘once: Jane made
‘the decision to settle her civil case in December of 2020, there'was no-case to “help” in. August
of 202:1 when the email was written or. a-year later when.she testified at this trial.

Further, Ms. Maxwell contends that because Jane testified. on cross-examination that she
did not kriow that. cooperating with. the government would help her civil. case, Mr. Glassman’s
purported statement:'to Ms. Moc in-August of 2021 would somchow be relevant in ‘shedding light.
on that issue. Not only would this’be improper impeachment and ‘an. attempt to foree an ‘attorncy

to'take a position adverse to his, client, it is.also misleading.
