Jane will prevent her from committing a crime that would cause death or great bodily harm.
Accordingly, Mr. Glassman cannot testify about any communication he allegedly had with Jane
without violating Rule 1.6.

Additionally, Mr. Glassman's testimony would be wholly irrelevant. Ms. Maxwell claims
the statement in Ms. Moe’s email is relevant for only two reasons: (1) “Jane’s motive to
cooperate and testify,” and (2) “her memory and capacity as a witness since she cannot recall a
highly consequential conversation she just had months ago.” (Maxwell Motion at 1-2). Both
alleged reasons are based on a faulty premise and are factually untrue.

The August 17, 2021 email from Ms. Moe expressly states that the alleged statement at
issue occurred before Ms. Maxwell was criminally charged — not “just ... months ago” in August
2021 -- as Ms. Maxwell appears to insinuate. Ms. Maxwell was arrested and charged on July 2,
2020 — more than a year before the email from Ms. Moe was written.

Jane's civil case settled on December 11, 2020—8 months before Ms. Moe’s email was
written and approximately a year before she testified at this trial. Accordingly, once Jane made
the decision to settle her civil case in December of 2020, there was no case to “help” in August
of 2021 when the email was written or a year later when she testified at this trial.

Further, Ms. Maxwell contends that because Jane testified on cross-examination that she
did not know that cooperating with the government would help her civil case, Mr. Glassman’s
purported statement to Ms. Moe in August of 2021 would somehow be relevant in shedding light
on that issue. Not only would this be improper impeachment and an attempt to force an attorney
to take a position adverse to his client, it is also misleading.
