THE COURT: Thank. you ‘for your patience.

As I. have stated, the guideline range applicable to
this casé is 188 to 235 months' wmprisonment .

Under the Supreme Court's decision in. a case called
Bookér and related cases, the GWideline range is only one

factor that the Court must consider in. deciding the appropriate

sentence. I am also réquired 'to consider ‘the other factors set
ferth in a provision called 18 U.S.C. 3593(a). These include
the naturé and circumstances 6f the offense, and the Histéry
and, characteristics of the defendant; the meed for the sentence
imposed to6 reflect the sériousness of the offense, to promote.
respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the

offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, t6

pretect the public from further crimes of the defendant, to
provide needed educational, vdécatiohal training, medical Gare,
or other treatment. I am ‘to take into account the kinds of
sentences available, as T havé said, the guideline range, any
pertinent. policy statement, the need to avoid unwarranted
sentence dispdrities among defendants with similar récords who

hawme been found guilty of similar conduct, the need, to provide

restituti6n aS appropriate under the law to any victims of the

offense.

I am required to impose a, sentence sufficient, but no
greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes I Nave just

described. I have given substantial thought and attention to
