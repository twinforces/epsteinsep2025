them with respect to only. onc, and only onc, criminal ‘statute —New York’Penal Law, Section
130.55. In the final jury charge, the Court.denied. several of the defense-requests for clarifying
language, including that the Mann Act charges were premised.on, travel to New York.and that
‘sexual. activity that occurred,outside of New York: could not;be considered “illegal, sexual
activity” as charged:in the Indictment.

Maxwell was convicted on three of the four Mann Act:counts based on Janc’s testimony’ about
sexual abuse she ‘experienced at Epstein’s ranch. in New Mexico when. she was. 15 or 16 years old.
A jury note ‘sent during their deliberations (Court:Exhibit.#15) clearly indicated. that.the jurors
were considering convicting Ms. Maxwell on Count Four of the Indictment based solely on the
New-Mexico conduct. The Court denied the defense’s request to give:a clarifying instruction to
the jury that the New’Mexico conduct: could not: form the basis of'a, conviction, on the: substantive
Mani Act counts. because it was not a Violation of New York law. ‘Instead, the Court dirceted the
jury to the existing jury charge for Count Four. The jury ultimately convicted:!Ms. Maxwell on
‘Count Four‘and the two Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts:‘Onc and Three.

Jane’s testimony about sexual abuse in-New Mexico presented the jury with.an
alternative basis for conviction on, the Mann Act, counts that'was entirely: distinct. from the
charges in the Indictment, which were premised. ona violation. of New York law. The Court’s
instructions to the:jury were insufficient to prevent:them. from.convicting.on this. basis, which
constituted a.constructive amendment .and/or a variance, fromthe charges in the Indictment.
Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell moves under Rule 33 of the Federal, Rules of Criminal Procedure for

the Court to:vacate her convictions on Counts One, Three, and Four and grant.a new'trial.
