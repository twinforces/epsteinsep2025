Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The parties respectfully submit this joint table reflecting the remaining statements about
which the parties disagree. The parties have omitted from this table the statements from previous
tables in which the parties have reached agreement. The parties note that many of these statements
raise one of two questions: (1) must counsel show the witness the prior inconsistent statement
under Rule 613(b), and (2) is a statement admissible when the witness affirms that the 3500
material contains the inconsistent statement and also expresses disagreement with the substance.
