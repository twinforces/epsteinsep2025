There are also clear inconsistencies between the Defendant’s intended redactions, as
stated in her accompanying letter, and her proposed redactions, compare Dkt. No. 602, with
Proposed Redactions to Maxwell Br. at 48-49, and between some of the proposed redactions
themselves, compare Proposed Redactions to Gov. Br. at 35-36, with Proposed Redactions to
Maxwell Reply at 22.

The Defendant also proposes redactions related to “Juror 50’s exact responses to the
questions on his jury questionnaire” because it is “being kept temporarily under seal.” Dkt. No.
602. The Court notifies the parties that Juror 50’s completed questionnaire will be docketed in
accordance with a forthcoming Order. The Defendant must accordingly eliminate proposed
redactions premised on the sealing of Juror 50’s questionnaire.
