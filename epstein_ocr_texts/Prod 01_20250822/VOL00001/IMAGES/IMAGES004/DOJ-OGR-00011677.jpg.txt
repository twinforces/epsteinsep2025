1 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.
2 I just wanted to confirm that in doing alternating
3 strikes, we would start or the government would start. I'm not
4 sure.
5 THE COURT: I think since the defense has ten, the
6 defense should start.
7 MS. STERNHEIM: So two/one, one/two, two/one, and till
8 we get to the one and one and one.
9 THE COURT: That's fine with me. Ms. Comey?
10 MS. COMEY: That's fine with the government, your
11 Honor.
12 THE COURT: Okay. So the defense will do two;
13 government is one; defense, two; government, one.
14 MS. STERNHEIM: Usually it's one and then two.
15 THE COURT: That's fine.
16 MS. STERNHEIM: Alternating.
17 THE COURT: That's fine. Or you can -- as you know, I
18 don't do alternating strikes.
19 MS. STERNHEIM: I know. And I appreciate that --
20 THE COURT: I've given into the requests of both sides
21 to do it this way. You can just alternate one, one, and the
22 defense goes, or you could do what you proposed.
23 MS. STERNHEIM: I think we're fine with the typical
24 way.
25 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. The typical way is fine.
