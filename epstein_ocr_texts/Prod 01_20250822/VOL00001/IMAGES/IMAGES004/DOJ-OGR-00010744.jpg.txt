ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, Circuit Judge, sitting by designation:

The Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA) “guarantees to the victims of federal crimes an
array of substantive and participatory rights, including the rights to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole
proceeding, to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case, and to receive full and
timely restitution as provided in law.” United States v. Murillo-Bejerano (In re Rendon Galvis),
564 F.3d 170, 174 (2d Cir. 2009) (per curiam) (cleaned up). “In any court proceeding involving
an offense against a crime victim, the court shall ensure that the crime victim is afforded
th[ose] rights.” 18 U.S.C. § 3771(b)(1).

In accordance with the procedure required by this Court’s prior order, Dkt. No. 671, the
Government has provided statements from seven individuals asserting they are crime victims
under the CVRA. As explained below, the Court will permit all seven individuals to provide
statements and the Defendant’s request for redactions is denied.

As a preliminary matter, the Defendant does not object to the inclusion of statements
from three of these individuals: Annie Farmer, Kate, and Virginia Giuffre. Accordingly, their
written submissions are deemed part of the record and to the extent Annie Farmer, Kate, and/or
Giuffre seek permission to make an oral statement at sentencing, that request is granted.
