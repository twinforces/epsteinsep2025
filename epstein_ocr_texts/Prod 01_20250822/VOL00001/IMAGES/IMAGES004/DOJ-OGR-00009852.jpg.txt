Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 643-1 Filed 03/11/22 Page5of6
Jane’s story was backed up by her high school boyfriend, who
remembered being told about Epstein when they were younger.

The accuser’s stories were backed up by flight logs which placed Jane on

at least one flight with Maxwell, David said.

Their stories were backed up by Maxwell's “little black book” — an address

book found in Epstein’s home that listed the names of “masseuses”

including Jane and Carolyn.

David said the little black book also gave the jurors clues about how

Maxwell and Epstein had evaded accountability in the past. There were

names of several Palm Beach police officers listed on a first-name basis in

that book, David said.

“Those girls’ names and phone numbers were listed next to the words

‘mom’ and ‘dad‘” he said. “Professional masseuses do not need their

parents with them.”

Many speculated that the jury chose to acquit Maxwell on count two

because that count related solely to Jane, and that Jane was less credible

than other victims.

But David told The Independent that wasn't the case.

“We simply didn’t see enough direct evidence to convict on count two,”

he said. “It wasn’t about not believing Jane.”

Count two was a substantive charge that required proof that Maxwell

“enticed” Jane to travel across state lines. David said there just wasn’t any

direct evidence for any specific trip that Maxwell took any action to entice

Jane to get on those flights.

“T personally was willing to find her guilty on count two,” he said. “But we

all decided in the end that there wasn’t enough evidence.”

David also explained that he was convinced by the closeness of Maxwell

and Epstein’s relationship and the key role she played in his life.
