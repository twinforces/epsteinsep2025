that relates to the subjcét mattcr'of the Witness's testimony.”).

This case now ‘involves a ten-year time period. beginning 27 years ago. The indictment
and the accusers. are vague regarding when things happened, what;things happened and who may
have been present’when. anything is alleged to, have happened. Accuscr-2’s journal contains
dated entries that:place ‘events in context with other alleged events. Accuser-2’s journal, from
1996 purports to, document encounters with, Epstein in New York. The S2 indictment, paragraph
9(b),, claims:that “Maxwell intcracted with [Accuscr-2] on at Icast one occasion ‘in. or about 1,996
at Epstcin’s residence in New Mexico....” The journal references. other dates, places, and events
in 1996. The absence of any mention of Ms. Maxwell. in context with other recorded events is
both relevant.and exculpatory.

As a piece of physical, evidence, the journal, is'subject;to inspection and. testing. Sce F.R.
Crim. P. :1.7(c)(1). Moreover, were the journal in the possession ofthe government it would be.
subject.to inspection under F.‘R. Crim, P. 16 (a) (1) (E) which provides, in relevant part:

Upon a defendant's request, the government. must permit-the defendant'to
inspect.and:to. copy or photograph books, papers, documents, data,
photographs,, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copics or portions of.
any ofthese items, if the item is within the g government's possession,
custody,. or control, and:
(1) the item is -material to preparing the defense;
(ii) the: government intends to use the item in its‘case-in-chief at trial[.]

To avoid any disclosure obligations, the government has simply accepted, partisan

to introduce at trial. ‘Comparison of’one of the five pages demonstrates the problem. Attached as
