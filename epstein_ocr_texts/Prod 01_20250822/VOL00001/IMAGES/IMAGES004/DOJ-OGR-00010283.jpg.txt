three required. travel to New York-whereas Count:Five did not require interstate travel. (Opp. at
28). Yet the government, still readily concedes that. Counts Orie and, Three: are multiplicitous
because the conduct underlying, these counts is. so similar. Count Five.is no different.’

Indeed, it 1s, evident from,the way'the government charged. the $2 Indictment thatthe
conduct, charged in Count Five. is:part ofthe same conspiratorial agreement as'the. conduct
charged.in Counts One and Three. The Court will recall that Counts Five and.Six, the sex:
trafficking counts, ‘were added to the Indictment after the government; located Carolyn and.
secured her:as a-witness. These:counts:are based primarily: on her allegations of sexual abuse
and. are therefore limited to the time period from, 2001-2004. But:in superseding the Indictment,
the government did not treat: Carolyn’s allegations asa separate conspiracy. Instead, the
government.recognized.that:the abuse she described. was a.continuation of the same:conspiracy
and fully incorporated her allegations into the existing Mann.Act conspiracics. For example, the
government cxpanded the date range. of Counts One. and ‘Three from 1994-1997 to 1994-2004 to
include Carolyn’s abuse and added an overt act to both counts alleging that!Ms. Maxwell
“invited [Carolyn] to travel from Florida to a place outside of Florida with.Epstein.” (Ind. 4%
13e, 19c). Consistent with this:charging theory, the government.argucd to the jury that it:could
consider all of the evidence related to Carolyn as evidenee of the Mann, Act conspiracies. (Tr.
2895) (“The ‘first two conspiracy counts are from. 1994 to, 2004. Those counts are about.Jane,

Garolyn, and Annic.” (emphasis added)).

?-The cases cited by the government are:not to the:contrary. In. United Siatesv. Villa, No. 12: Cr. 40 (IBA), 2014
WL 252013 (D:, Conn. Jan. 22, 2014), the!District Court.considered.the nature ‘of the offenses intholding that the
relevant.conspiracies: were different but did not rely exclusively‘on that factor:and ‘instead. based its decision.on a
thorough analysis:of all-of the Korfantfactors. United States'v. Sattar, 31.4 F. Supp..2d 279 (S.D.N-Y.,.2004) is
inapposite on this point. because the:relevant conspiracies were ‘charged under two'separate clauses of the! general
conspiracy, statue.and; were therefore distinct.conspiracies on their face, whereas the:conspiracies:in the Indictment,
in'this:case*were all-charged-under the ‘same ‘clause:,
