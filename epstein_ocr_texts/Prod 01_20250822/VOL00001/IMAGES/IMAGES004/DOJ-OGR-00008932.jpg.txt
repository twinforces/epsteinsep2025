A. Background Facts
1. Legal Instructions to the Jury

The possible bases for:conviction on the Mann Act counts was an issue'that:came up
repeatedly and litigated cxtensively'in the context of the motions in, /imine, the Court’s limiting
‘instructions at trial, and the jury charge. On these: occasions, the government:repcatedly:
confirmed. that.a, conviction on.the Mann, Act-counts could, only: be based. on.an intent. to violate
New; York law—spécifically, New York Penal Law, Section '130.55—and not.any other’ state’s
penal laws. Yet the :government also repeatedly objected:to defense efforts to clarify that point
and ensure'that;the jury did not:improperly consider evidenee of sexual, conduct that took:place

For'example, when, the defense moved in limineto preclude Kate’s testimony on the
grounds that. she was above the age of consent-in the relevant,jurisdictions and therefore her:
testimony: was: not probative of the Mann.Act conspiracics, the government confirmed that Ms.
Maxwell could.only be convicted.on the'Mann, Act conspiracies based-on a:violation of New
York law:

THE COURT... [I]f the.only evidence in the case: pertained. to [Kate], if all the

testimony ‘of [Katc] is accepted bythe jury, could the defendant’be found guilty:of

any crimes charged in,the indictment?

MS. MOE: ...The answer. is no.... With:respect to the Mann, Act conspiracies, the
particular criminal, sexual activity relates to a ‘particular statute’ in New York....

THE COURT: The particular statute in New York ... that’s [130.55] right?

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

THE, COURT: So the Manin. Act ... the case'that the. government is going:to prove.
here is going to incorporate that as the illegal sexual. conduct.
