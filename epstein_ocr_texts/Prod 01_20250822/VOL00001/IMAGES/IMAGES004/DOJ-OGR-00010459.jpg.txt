unresolved circumstances and under a cloud of business impropriety. With Mr. Maxwell deceased,
her brothers, Ian and Kevin, employees of their father, shouldered the accusations. All family
assets were frozen, Elisabeth Maxwell was left penniless, the brothers were tried and ultimately

Life After Epstein

In 2003, Ms. Maxwell began a seven-year romantic relationship with Theodore “Ted”
Waitt and developed a strong and loving bond with his four children, ranging in age from six to
twelve. Her relationship with Waitt was on track for marriage and gave her what she had always
hoped for and wanted most — the opportunity for a loving, stable family life and the chance to
become stepmother to Waitt’s children. But her hopes were destroyed, as was so much of her life,
by her previous association with Epstein. A Miami lawyer named Scott W. Rothstein, Esq.
attempted to blackmail Waitt to keep Ms. Maxwell’s name out of civil lawsuits related to Epstein
that his law firm was planning to file. Ms. Maxwell’s relationship with Waitt could not survive
the blackmail threats and it ended soon afterwards.!* The same thing has now occurred again
several years later as a result of this prosecution. In 2013, Ms. Maxwell began a new relationship
with the man she would later marry. She was with her husband for over seven years and became

” Through his law firm, Rothstein Rosenfeld Adler (“RRA”), Rothstein perpetrated a massive $1.2 billion
dollar Ponzi scheme in Florida. Touting RRA as the “preeminent sexual harassment firm in the country,”
Rothstein claimed to be representing numerous underage girls who had been involved with Epstein. In the
spring of 2009, RRA recruited Bradley J. Edwards, Esq., who immediately joined the firm. By the end of
October 2009, Rothstein became a fugitive, and later returned to face arrest, to plead guilty to RICO charges
in SDFL, and to receive a 50-year sentence. See 09 Cr. 60331(JIC). Rothstein had targeted Waitt, the deep-
pocket co-founder of Gateway, Inc., because of his ongoing relationship with Ms. Maxwell, who had
previously been involved with Epstein. Rothstein demanded $10 million to keep Ms. Maxwell’s name out
of civil lawsuits. Waitt successfully resisted Rothstein’s blackmail attempt, but Ms. Maxwell was named
in lawsuits filed by RRA. Ultimately, Ms. Maxwell’s relationship with Waitt did not survive the ordeal.
