‘who have been found. guilty of dissimilar:conduet:”) (citing Gall’v. United States, 552 US. 38555
(2007)).

In, addition, a. non-guidelines sentence would avoid: unwarranted sentencing disparities. It,
‘would, be:plainly unjust'to sentence Ghislainé Maxwell as if she'were Jeffrey Epstein. Had.Epstcin
been .tricd.on this indictment he would have been.cxposcd to a comparable guideline range. Justice:
would not be served, by sentencing Ms. Maxwell to the extent of the more culpable: Epstein. Nor
should. she be sentenced. as if'she. Were, Harvey Weinstein. Following a state jury trial. convicting,
the guideline range calculated by’ Probation for Ms. Maxwell.

Morcover,.a ‘non-guidelines sentence would at least mitigate the drastic: disparity. between.
the penalties under state and, federal law-in, this case. The predicate state offense’ in Counts Three
and Four — New York Penal Law § 130.55 — is a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum term of
90 days’ imprisonment. See United States'v. Brown, 843 F.3d.74, 88-89 & n.2 (2d Gir. 2016)
(Pooler, J., dissenting) (noting the: stark: difference in sentences for offenses involving ‘the sexual,
exploitation. of minors under federal law ‘versus New York State law). Viewing, the conduct. of
conviction in the: light most favorable: to the government, imposition of a guideline ‘sentence for
‘Ms. Maxwell will lead.to inequitable and. disparate results.

In this: case, the goals of -sentencing will be achieved. by a significant downward. variance:
from the unduly. harsh Guidelines range of 292 -.365 ‘months and Probation’s recommended. 240-:
month sentence for offense conduct that, occurred, 18 to 28 'years ago and ‘where a 60-year-old.
female defendant. with. no prior- or post-offense history of misconduct :requires:no rehabilitation.

by incarecration ‘and poses no risk of recidivism.
