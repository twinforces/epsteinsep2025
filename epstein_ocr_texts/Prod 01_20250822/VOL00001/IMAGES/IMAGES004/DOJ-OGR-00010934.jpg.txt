SUMMARY OF THE CASE
The Court is selecting a jury for a trial commencing on Monday, November 29, 2021.
Although it is never possible to predict the length of a trial, currently this trial is expected
to last approximately six weeks.
This is a criminal case. The Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged in an Indictment
with various criminal offenses. The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the |
charges—referred to as “counts”—that the Government intends to prove to the jury at trial
beyond a reasonable doubt. |
The charges in the Indictment stem from allegations that from at least 1994 through 2004, the |
Defendant conspired with and aided and abetted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minors to travel to
engage in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity,
and to engage in sex trafficking of a minor.
The Indictment charges the Defendant in 6 counts: Count One of the Indictment charges the
Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage
in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Two
charges the Defendant with enticing a minor to travel to engage in sexual activity for which a
person can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abetting the same. Count Three
charges the Defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to engage
in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense. Count Four
charges the Defendant with transporting a minor to engage in sexual activity for which a person
can be charged with a criminal offense, and aiding and abetting the same. Count Five charges
the Defendant with participating in a sex trafficking conspiracy. Count Six charges the
Defendant with sex trafficking of a minor, and aiding and abetting the same.
Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms. Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before
she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must find that the Government has proven each
element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt. |
