render. that paper a judicial document subject to the right of public access. We think that
the item filed must; be relevant to the performance of the judicial function and ‘useful in
the judicial. process in order for it to be designated a judicial document.”)..Morcover, if
stricken, the documents, enjoy no presumption. of public access. Brown v. Maxwell, 929
F.3d 41, 51-52. (2d.Cir. 201.9) (funder Civil Rule 12], “the district court may:strike such
material from the filings on the grounds that.it is “redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or
scandalous..” Because such rejected. or stricken material is not. “relevant to the
performance: of the judicial function” it would not be considered a “judicial. document”
and;would enjoy no presumption. of public access.”).

The Second Circuit established a framework in Liigosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d:Cir. 2006) for courts. to utilize in determining when the
public has a right of access to particular documents. The Court. of’ Appeals held that
“[b]efore any such common law right.can attach, however, a court must first conclude
that the documents at.issue are indeed ‘judicial documents.” Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 119.
“Once the court has determined.that the documents are judicial documents and. that
therefore a common law presumption of access attaches, it must determine the weight of
that presumption.” /d. “Finally, after determining the weight‘of the presumption. .of
access, the court must ‘balance competing considerations, against. it.”” /d. at 120.

There exists no compelling reason to release Juror No, 50’s pleadings. Any public

release of the documents will sct off another round of publicity; speculation, and
commentary, all of which is prejudicial to the truth finding process and Ms. Maxwell’s
rights to fair-and impartial proceedings.
