Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 700 Filed 07/12/22 Page 3of6

This evening the Government showed Government Exhibit 52 to a different employee of
Epstein and the defendant’s, Juan Alessi. Alessi worked for Epstein at his Palm Beach house from
approximately 1990 until approximately 2002. Alessi has explained that, during his employment,
he observed a contact book with a dark blue or black cover, which cover was blank, and with many
entries printed in black ink on white paper. See 3504-046. The book was bound, and Alessi was
instructed to put identical copies of it on Epstein and the defendant’s desks and elsewhere around
the Palm Beach house.” During the course of his employment for Epstein Alessi reviewed multiple
versions of the book: the book was replaced annually with new versions, and the old versions are
destroyed. Alessi observed both the defendant and Epstein use the contact book.

When the Government showed Alessi Government Exhibit 52 tonight, Alessi recognized
it as a copy of the contact book he had previously described. See 3504-047. Alessi identified the
book by the cover, binding, formatting, and variation in the entries. Alessi also reviewed the
entries inside the book and identified numerous entries as containing contact information for
individuals that he specifically recalls being included in the copies of the books he remembers
seeing in Palm Beach. That includes the entry for the witness testifying as “Jane,” see GX 52-F,
and the entry for Florida masseuses—including some of the individuals on that list, see GX 52-G.
Although this version of the contact book post-dates his employment with Epstein, Alessi was able
to determine that fact in part by noticing that his own contact information had been removed from
the book.’

D Alesel alae explained that thane were two similar-looking books, one for Epstein and one for the
defendant.
3 Alessi generally recalls the book being thicker and featuring a larger font size. Notwithstanding
that recollection, he believes this is a copy of the contact book based on the foregoing.
