Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document642 Filed 03/11/22 Page 57 of 66

Ms. Maxwell requests that any hearing begin with the questioning of Juror No. 50.
Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court first advise Juror No. 50 about the nature of the
hearing and then allow defense counsel to question Juror No. 50 followed by questioning
from the government, re-cross examination by defense counsel, followed by any
questions from the Court and any additional questions from counsel based on the Court’s
questions.

If, after this examination further inquiry is required, Ms. Maxwell suggests that the
second juror be summoned to Court for an identical process. If necessary, this process
should be repeated as to all remaining jurors.

After the examination of the jurors the parties should be afforded a period of time
to conduct any further investigation warranted by the information presented at the hearing
followed by post-hearing arguments, either oral or written.

Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) does not prohibit this inquiry, because Ms.
Maxwell does not seek to impeach the verdict based on the content of deliberations. Cf
Fed. R. Evid. 606(b) (providing that, with certain exceptions, “a juror may not testify
about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury’s deliberations”
during ‘“‘an inquiry into the validity of a verdict”). Instead, she intends to show that her
jury was not fair and impartial as required by the Sixth Amendment because at least two
jurors gave false answers during voir dire to material questions that, if answered
truthfully, would have subject them to a challenge for cause.

To the extent Rule 606 might apply to certain questions asked at the hearing, Ms.
Maxwell need not inquire into the content of deliberations to establish her jury bias
