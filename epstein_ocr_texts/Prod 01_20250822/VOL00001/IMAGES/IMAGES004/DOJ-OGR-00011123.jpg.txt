1 paralegals, I will ask each of you to stand as I say your name
2 so that the jurors can see you, the panelists can see you. So,
3 I will note Mr. Schneider is part of the team but not present
4 today and may not be present every day of the trial.
S Appropriate, Mr. DeMarco?
6 MR. DeMARCO: Yes, Judge.
7 THE COURT: OK. So Jesus Ortiz is the pronunciation.
8 How about, Mr. Hobson, how do I pronounce no. Q?
9 MR. HOBSON: I believe, your Honor, it is Vyacheslav,
10 and the last name is Polosin.
11 THE COURT: Vyacheslav Polosin. OK.
12 Special Agent Stefano Braccini?
13 MR. HOBSON: And he is in the courtroom.
14 THE COURT: OK. I think that's it. Other issues to
15 take up?
16 MR. HOBSON: I don't think so, your Honor.
17 THE COURT: Mr. DeMarco?
18 MR. DeMARCO: No, your Honor. Not now.
19 Judge, how much time do we have before we walk over?
20 Maybe we could use this time efficiently, because I do have --
21 I raised with the government an issue I was going to raise with
22 their first witness so you tell me.
23 THE COURT: I was told around between 10:00 and 10:30
24 but we won't know until they actually call over so I'm happy to
25 use the time and if we get the call, we will pause.
