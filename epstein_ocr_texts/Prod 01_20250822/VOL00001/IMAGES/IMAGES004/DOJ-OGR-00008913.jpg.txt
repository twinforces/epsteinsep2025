Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document596 - Filed 02/11/22 Page5of7
Order, via email on or before February 16, 2022. Because this Order resolves the scope of
redactions for all filings related to the motion, the Court adjourns sine die the briefing schedule
previously set for the parties to justify any proposed sealing or redactions to the new trial motion
papers. See Dkt. No. 585. The Court will rule on the proposed redactions so the filings can be
docketed, and the Court will file under seal unredacted copies of any documents for which
redactions are approved.

At the time the briefs are docketed with approved redactions, the Defendant is further
ORDERED to docket Exhibits 2 and 3 to her motion and the exhibit to her reply, and the
Government ORDERED to docket all exhibits to its opposition, all of which are publicly
available documents.!

I. Juror 50 Motion to Intervene

The Court is also in receipt of Juror 50’s motion to intervene, which both the Government
and the Defense oppose. Defense Motion, at 51-52; Government Response, at 44; see also
Defense Ltr., Jan. 13, 2022. The Court denies the motion. Juror 50 cites no authority to support
a juror’s intervention when he will possibly be subject to a post-verdict inquiry. The cases he
cites in support are inapposite; he is not seeking to intervene to assert First Amendment access
by the press, to quash a subpoena, or to prevent dissemination of privileged information.
Although cases do support that a juror should have legal counsel in a post-verdict inquiry into
allegedly false voir dire responses, as Juror 50 does have, no cases support intervention. See,
e.g., McCoy, No. 14 Cr. 6181 (EAW), Dkt. No. 329 at 6-7 (appointing counsel for juror alleged
1 Exhibit 1 to the Defendant’s motion, which is Juror 50’s completed questionnaire, is to be maintained temporarily
under seal pending the Court’s ruling on whether a hearing will be held and on the New York Times Company’s
motion to unseal the filled-out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. Dkt. Nos. 583, 585. The Court will
address Juror 50’s request that a copy of his questionnaire be released to his counsel at that time. The Court notes
that the voir dire transcript is currently available to the public.
