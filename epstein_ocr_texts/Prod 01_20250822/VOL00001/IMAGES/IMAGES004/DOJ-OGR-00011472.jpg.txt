Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 734-1 Filed 07/15/22 Page6of7

14. | Asamatter of public policy, ensuring confidentiality in litigation-alternative
victim compensation programs like the EVCP is an absolute imperative. To compromise
confidentiality in any way in this case would threaten the integrity, credibility and viability of
this program and all others like it — past, existing, and future. It has been my experience that
victims, alleged tortfeasors, other interested parties, and courts have long recognized and
respected the need to protect confidentiality in victim compensation programs as integral to
program integrity. I personally know of no situation in which an independent administrator has
been forced to disclose information and/or documentation that was submitted to, maintained by,
exchanged with or distributed by a litigation-alternative compensation program for any purpose.
To open the door in any way would disembowel the very core of this program and have
devastating consequences for this and other victim compensation programs, particularly those
involving claims of sexual abuse. Forcing disclosure of Program records, despite the fact that
confidentiality is an express, agreed-upon, court-mandated term of the Program, would invite
and embolden others who are pursuing civil legal claims or who are facing criminal prosecution
or who are pursuing criminal prosecution of others or who otherwise want to get their hands on
confidential information to file similar requests.

15. I designed the EVCP with confidentiality as a centerpiece and cornerstone of the
claims process. Safeguarding that confidentiality in full and without condition is essential to the
integrity and success of this Program, and the viability of other similar compensation programs.

statements about the Protocol. Ms. Maxwell’s motion expressed that “the Protocol credits
claimants who have had charges filed against Epstein or any employee of Epstein.” That is not
an accurate characterization of the Protocol. The Protocol includes a non-exclusive list of factors
