Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 643-1 Filed 03/11/22 Page2of6
Scotty David, who wishes to be identified by his first and middle name,
told The Independent in his first media interview that he believed all of the
victims who testified against Ghislaine Maxwell in her sex-trafficking trial
that took place in lower Manhattan over the past four weeks. All of the
accusers corroborated each other and were backed up by other evidence,
he said.

David said he is proud to be part of holding Maxwell accountable for her
crimes.

“This verdict is for all the victims,” David told The Independent. “For those
who testified, for those who came forward and for those who haven't
come forward. I’m glad that Maxwell has been held accountable.
“This verdict shows that you can be found guilty no matter your status.”
David told The Independent that he found all of the accusers who testified
to be believable and credible, despite the defence’s many attacks on their
credibility and their attempts to poke holes in their memory.

“They were all believable. Nothing they said felt to me like a lie.” he said.
David knows that sometimes you can misremember small details of
traumatic memories without ever doubting the core of the memory. He
knows that because he is himself a survivor of sexual abuse.

“I know what happened when I was sexually abused. I remember the
colour of the carpet, the walls. Some of it can be replayed like a video,” he
said. He explained this to the jury.

“But I can’t remember all the details, there are some things that run
together.”

So he knew that some misremembered details doesn’t mean the memory
itself didn’t happen.

There were also questions from the jury about why the girls didn’t come
forward earlier.

But David said he knows what that’s like, too. “I didn’t disclose my abuse
until I was in high school,” he said.
