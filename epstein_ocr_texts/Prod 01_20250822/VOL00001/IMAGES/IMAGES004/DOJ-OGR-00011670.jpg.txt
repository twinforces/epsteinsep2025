1 the routine during trial or may we all participate?
2 THE COURT: I think it's just a distancing question to
3 make sure that we have sufficient space. So maybe what we can
4 do is have kind of a first layer of lawyers -- a first layer of
S lawyers and then -â€”-
6 MS. STERNHEIM: A backup team.
7 THE COURT: -- a backup team behind them so that we're
8 keeping everyone distances, as is required.
9 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.
10 I think Mr. Everdell has an issue.
11 MR. EVERDELL: Yes. Thank you, your Honor.
12 Just a matter of choreography. Assuming we do get to
13 witnesses today, pursuant to the Court's instructions, we have
14 a binder of materials for the witness. Once cross begins,
15 we'll need to take just a brief break to deliver the binder to
16 the witness box. And I believe for the first witness we may
17 have some manila folders to hand out to the jurors which we
18 would instruct them not to look at until they are instructed to
19 do.
20 THE COURT: Okay. And does this overlap with the
21 request put in yesterday regarding using video for cross?
22 MR. EVERDELL: It does, your Honor. We have prepared
23 as if we need binders. We still would like that request to be
24 considered so that we can use electronic, but we have prepared
25 the first couple witnesses with binders.
