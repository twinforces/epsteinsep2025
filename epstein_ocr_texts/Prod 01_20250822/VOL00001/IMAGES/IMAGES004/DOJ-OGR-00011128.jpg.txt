10 would interfere with and overcome the medical facts that you

11 need for purposes of proving causation. So, because this

12 witness is testifying first it's difficult for me to know

13 exactly what additional facts you need to extract from the

14 witness but I am certainly going to cut off the line at any

15 graphic descriptions. To the extent that walking this person
16 through questions regarding the medical condition is emotional
17 testimony, I think we are -- it will have to be stopped.

20 specific factual questions you believe that you need and that
21 are not cumulative with the medical testimony, but I'm going to
22 guard this line very carefully, and you should too.

25 that line and I am -—- with the ability to maybe construct some
