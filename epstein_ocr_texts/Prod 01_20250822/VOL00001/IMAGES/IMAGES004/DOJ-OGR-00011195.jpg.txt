Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Counsel:

I write pursuant to the Court's Order of November 23, 2021 directing a supplement to
the disclosure for Certified Forensic Examiner Robert Kelso's expert opinion to the extent he
intends to offer rebuttal testimony to any opinions offered in the government's original
disclosure for Stephen Flatley, dated September 15, 2021.

I note that yesterday you provided a supplemental notice for Mr. Flatley. That
supplement was untimely. Thus, we intend to object at trial to the admission of any opinions
from Mr. Flatley not included in your September 15, 2021 disclosure. This supplement for
Mr. Kelso does not purport to respond to anything contained in your Flatley supplement.

We anticipate that Mr. Kelso will testify about the meaning of certain pieces of
metadata associated with computers and computer files, such as “Authors,” “Last saved by,”
“Registered Organization,” and “Registered Owner” and potentially others. Mr. Kelso will
testify about where the data contained in these types of metadata fields originates and how it
propagates. Mr. Kelso will testify that a particular value in one or more of these metadata
fields, such as a version of person’s name, does not necessarily mean that person authored the
underlying documents or had any interaction with the documents. This testimony may cover
any exhibits offered by the Government.

Mr. Kelso's testimony may also encompass the metadata associated with defense
exhibits, including testimony about the values contained in certain metadata fields and their
meaning. Because the defense cannot anticipate at this juncture which exhibits may be
necessary, depending upon evidence offered by the government during its case in chief, the
defense reserves the right to disclose the metadata testimony from Mr. Kelso at the same time
it identifies any particular exhibit that it will introduce as impeachment or rebuttal exhibits.
