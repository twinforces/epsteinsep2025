Re:  United:States'v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20'C¥. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

Counsel for Juror:.50 has filed :a.‘motion to ‘intervene, and to obtain a copy of certain,
matcrials:relating to jury selection. The motion was submitted byemail:to Chambers. .In an:Order
dated January 12, 2022, the Court directed the parties “to submit via email any proposcd.redactions
on or before January 13, 2022, justifying any such request: by. 'réfercneé to the three-part test
articulated by the Second Circuit:in Lugosch v..Pyramid Co..of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110:(2d Cir.
2006).”" The Government respectfully submits that no redactions are necessary, and accordingly.
the motion. should be publicly'filed.

The defendant. opposes any’ ‘public. filing of Juror 50’s' motion, arguing that jt is not a
judicial. document. This argument is meritless. Juror 50’s ‘motion, to ‘intervene is quite obviously’

“relevant to‘the performance ofa judicial function and useful inthe judicial. process.” United States
