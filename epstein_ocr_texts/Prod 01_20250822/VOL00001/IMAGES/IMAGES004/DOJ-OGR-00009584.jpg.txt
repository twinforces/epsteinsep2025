didnot modify any essential clement, of the offense or permit conviction based on, an entirely.
different theory. Referring'the jury back. to the:same instructions could-not have caused.a:different.
result.

The S2 Indictment charged the defendant with Mann.Act offenses with an intent to engage
in. sexual activity in violation ‘of.a New’ Y.ork statute. The Government put on. évidence. that the
‘Court charged the jury that the Government had to‘prove an intent to violate that. New York statute
beyond a reasonable doubt. “[T]he allegations:in the:indictment.and the proof.and jury instructions:
‘substantially correspond’ with cach other, as they:involve'a single course of conduct.” 1) ‘Amelio,
683. F.3d .at-424. “It therefore follows that. [the defendant] was convicted, of conduct that was the:
subject. of the grand jury’s indictment, and. there: was no constructive amendment. of the:

indietment:” Jd:°

° Even if the Court.agreed. with the defendant. that. the ‘proof as to Count Four was constructively’
amended, vacatur of the Mann Act.conspiracy counts would.be inappropriate. The jury note asked,
specifically: about Count.Four, and:suggested.no confusion as‘to the conspiracy counts. Morcover,
the j jury notes—which are of primary importance under the defendant’s theory—reveal that the
jury was focused.on Annie’ Farmer’s testimony’as to the Mann Act conspiracy counts (Tr. .3.102-
07). And Annic’s'testimony of:abuse in.New Mexico is no less. significant‘than Jane’s. Finally, it:
is entirely. unclear how the jury’s erroneous ‘understanding: of the law relating ‘to a substantive:
transportation. offense could prejudice the jury’s. understanding for the enticement conspiracy’
charge. See United , States v. yap 407 FP. App" ‘x 506, 5.10 (2d Cir. 2010) ("Constructive
remainder. of | the indictment ‘would, have stood.”); United States Vi “Milstein, 401. P3d 53, 66 (2d,
‘Cir.'2005) (per curiam) (reversing'on one count due to a constructive amendment; but rejecting the
contention that it requiréd:reversal, “as.a result of prejudicial spillover”).
