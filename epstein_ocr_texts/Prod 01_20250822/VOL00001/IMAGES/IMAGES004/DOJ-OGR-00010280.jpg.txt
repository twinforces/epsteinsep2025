Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 647 Filed 03/11/22 Page 14 of 24

Court’s crror was compounded by its earlier refusal to instruct.the jury. that Jane’s ‘sexual abuse
in. New ‘Mexico could not, be considered “illegal sexual activity” as charged in the Indictment:
because it:was not.a. violation.of New York law, as it had. instructed with-regard to Kate and
Annic Farmer’s testimony. (Tr. 2775-77). Asa result, the jury instructions. were insufficient to
properly instruct the jury on the law and created a substantial. likelihood ‘that Ms. Maxwell was
convicted of a crime other than.the one alleged in,the Indictment. ‘Moreover, because the Mann
Act conspiracy'counts (Counts, One and Three) ‘required. an identical finding of intent, there is a
substantial. likelihood.that the jury: improperly: convicted Ms..Maxwell on those counts: based:on
the same conduct. Accordingly, the Court, should vacate Ms. Maxwell’s convictions on Counts
One, Thrée, and Four; and. grant a new trial on. these counts.

I. All. Three Conspiracy Counts Are Multiplicitous Because They Are Based.on a.

Single Underlying Criminal Scheme.

The government concedés ‘in its Opposition. that.the Mann Act conspiracies charged in
Counts One and Three are:so similar that they are multiplicitous, and that the Court should. only
enter judgment.as to one of those two counts. (Opp. at 24):(“[T]he Government agrees that the
Court should enter judgment.on.only one of the Mann. Act conspiracy counts, given. the
similaritics between those counts.”). The government maintains, however, that the sex:
trafficking conspiracy’ charged in.Count.Five is, not-multiplicitous, and that the ‘Court should, enter:
judgment-on Counts Three and Five because they. “arose from different criminal schemes,
involving different.criminal conduct, different statutory predicates, and.a different modus
operandi.” (Opp. at.24).

The ‘government's attempt.to separate and. distinguish:the conspiracies ‘charged. in Counts
Three and Five:is directly contrary ‘to its theory of*prosccution ‘and the proof at trial, and flics in.

the ‘face of the arguments. the government.made'to. the jury. The government never framed these
