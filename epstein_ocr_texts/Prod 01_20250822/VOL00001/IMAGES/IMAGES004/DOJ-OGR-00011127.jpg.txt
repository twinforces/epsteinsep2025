1 testimony will be from the medical experts is that as a result
2 of the gunshot wound, that caused paralysis and paraplegia in

3 the victim. Paraplegia commonly leads to things such as

4 bedsores or pressure sores from not being able to move one's

5 body; also other conditions such as a colostomy bag, a

6 collapsed rectum, a permanent catheter, all of which can lead

7 to infections and that in this particular case it was the

8 complications of the paraplegia that led into infections or

9 sepsis and that it was the sepsis that ultimately, in 2010,

11 MR. DeMARCO: Your Honor, if I may?

12 THE COURT: Sure.

13 MR. DeMARCO: In my reading of the 3500 notes that

15 wounds, he describes a horrific odor, I think he described it
16 as the smell of death in Mr. Jones' apartment at or near the

17 time of his death. It's facts like these that I am focusing

18 on.

19 THE COURT: Yes.
20 MR. DeMARCO: The paraplegia, the medical testimony
21 from the medical examiners will establish that Mr. Jones was a
22 paraplegic and he was in a wheelchair. But, my concern is
23 about the graphic description of the bedsores, the compression
24 sores, and also the horrific odor witnessed by Mr. Vega.
25 MR. HOBSON: Your Honor, we are certainly cognizant of
