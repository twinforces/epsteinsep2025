So too, one of the victim witnesses present at trial was not a minor under the law of the place
where she was abused. Nonetheless, the Court allowed her to testify with a limiting instruction.
Maxwell’s offense conduct was not limited to minor victims.

Sarah and Elizabeth have the right to deliver an in—court statement at Maxwell’s sentencing.
The CVRA guarantees all crime victims the right to be “reasonably heard at any public proceeding in
the district court involving...sentencing.” 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4). This is the right of any victim to
give what is commonly referred to as a “victim impact statement.” See generally United States v,
Degenhardt, 405 F.Supp.2d 1341 (D. Utah 2005). Various courts have held that the CVRA’s right to
be reasonably heard guarantees victims the right to make an in—court statement. As one court
explained: “At a sentencing hearing, the other participants will speak directly to the judge. Read
against this backdrop, the CVRA commands that a victim should be treated equally with the
defendant, defense counsel, and the prosecutor, rather than turned into a ‘faceless stranger.” /d. at
1348, quoting Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 825 (1991). The Ninth Circuit has reached an
identical conclusion. See Kenna v. U.S. Dist. Court for C.D. Cal. 435 F.3d 1011, 1017-18 (9th Cir.
2006). These holdings are consistent with the intentions of the CVRA’s drafters. As Senator Kyl
explained, “the very purpose of this section is to allow the victim to appear personally and directly
address the court.” 150 CONG. REC. S10, 911 (daily ed. Oct. 9, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl),
quoted in Degenhardt, 405 FSupp.2d at 1346.

Further, victim impact evidence is probative of the offense conduct because an “assessment of
the harm caused by the defendant has long been an important factor in determining the appropriate
punishment, and victim impact evidence is simply another method of informing the sentencing
