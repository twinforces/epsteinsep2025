So too, one of the'victim witnesses present at trial was not ‘a minor under the law’of the place
where she was'abused. Nonetheless, the Court allowed. her to testify with a limiting instruction.
‘Maxwell’s offense conduct was not limited. to minor victims.

Sarah and Elizabeth have the right to deliver an.in—court statement at Maxwell's sentencing.
The CVRA guarantees all crime victims the right to: be “reasonably: heard at any public proceeding in
the district. court involving....sentencing.” 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (a)(4). This is the right of any victim. to
give what is commoily:referred to as a “victim imipact:starement.” See generally United States v.
Degenhardt, 405 FSupp.2d 1341 (D. Utah, 2005). Various courts have held that the CVRA’s right to

identical conclusion. See:Kenna v. U:S. Dist. Court.for C.D. Cal., 435: F.3d 1011, 101.7-18 (9th, Gir,
2006). These holdings are consistent with the intentions of the CVRA’s drafters. As Senator Ky!
explained, “the:very purpose of this section is to allow the victim to appear. personally and, directly
address the court.” 150 CONG. REC. $10, 911 (daily ed. Oct. 9,,2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl),
quoted in Degenhardt, 405. ESupp.2d at 1346,

Further, victim. impact evidence is probative of the offense conduct; because an. “assessment of
the harm. caused by the defendant has’ long been an important factor in ‘determining ‘the appropriate

punishment, ‘and victim impact evidence is simply another method of informing the sentencing
