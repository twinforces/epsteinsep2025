Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document596 Filed 02/11/22 Page/7of7
discovery material is also unavailing. While discovery materials themselves may not be judicial
documents, Juror 50’s motion is not a discovery document. The Defendant also fails to articulate
how docketing Juror 50’s own motion could affect the testimony of any potential witness and
ultimately affect the integrity of any inquiry into Juror 50’s conduct. The possibility of media
attention does not outweigh the presumption of access. Accordingly, the Court DENIES the
Defendant’s alternative request to seal the motion.

The Court reserves judgment on whether Juror 50’s motion should be redacted in light of
the principles and conclusion discussed above or on another basis. The parties may propose any
narrowly tailored redactions to Juror 50’s motion that are consistent with this Order via email on
or before February 16, 2022. The parties also submitted letters to the Court via email on
January 13, 2022, that addressed sealing of Juror 50’s motion. Any redactions to those letters
must be proposed by that same date. As noted above, the Court will rule on any proposed
redactions so the filings can be docketed, and the Court will file under seal unredacted copies of
any documents for which it approves redactions.

SO ORDERED.
