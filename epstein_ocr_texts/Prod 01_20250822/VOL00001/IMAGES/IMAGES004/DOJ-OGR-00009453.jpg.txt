and the ensuing investigation.

‘Events in July 2011
The July.8 Memorandum of Law

20. The memorandum does not reference the:discoveries:in March.or May. There was no
duty to do so. ] accept that.the Brune & Richard lawyers could anticipate a possible waiver claim
and:could.see how the government could cite the information that they had in Marchand May to
bolster that claim. But the lawyer. ethics‘rules i impose no general duty to volunteer information
‘that:an ‘opponent might use to:support its argument and the. exceptions in the'rules cited: do not
creaté-one specifically.

21. To put it otherwise, in order: to.find.a duty to reveal. there‘must be a source ofthe duty.
‘Professional conduct rules do impose dutiés to réveal, but they-do:so in a way that gives lawyers
‘notice of their requirements. No:rule required disclosure of the information. discovered i March
or.May. Any such mule would have to specify’the information required'to'be revealed and the
level of confidence ‘in the accuracy of that'information. Here, the rules i imposing:a duty to.
disclose to the tribunal.are Rules 3.3(b):and 3.5(d): Thesé-niles use actual knowledge:as the level
of confidence réquired for'the duty to disclosure: The information the lawyers had about the
material they had gathered in March and May négates actual knowledge; the actions of the
lawyers.are consistent only with a conclusion of a lack of actual knowledge. In sum, only if the:
lawyers:had had actual: ‘Anowledge i in March or‘May. would they have had to. reveal that in July,
and they did not havé. actual knowledge.

22. In certain places, the memorandum contains statements that:are apparently alleged to:
imply that the Brune & Richard: Jawyers did-not have information-about juror Conrad’s: identity
prior to:;June 20, when they re received: ‘a. copy of her letter to the government.

* Because the premises:of the adversary system are central here, instruction from the contiguous world: -
~ Of Rule 11 is again'apt:

The:primary purpose of.Rule 11 is todeter baseless court filings, but this goal must be

considered in light: of the-fact:that; in an adversary system-of litigation, the essence of the

lawyer's task.is to present.issues of facts and law-“as: favorably as fairly possible” i in:Support-of
the-client'siclaim. See United Nat: Ins. Co. v. R & D:batex COrp.; 242 F.3d 1102, 1115 (9 Cir.

2001). ‘Therefore, judges:should “impose:sanctions on: lawyers for their mode of advocacy‘only: 2
in the: most egregious:situations, lest.lawyers'be deterred from: vigorous représentation:of'

their clients.” Id. (citing Schlaifer Nance &.Co., Inc.'\v..Estates of Warhol, 194 F.3d 323, 341.(2

Cir. 1999).
