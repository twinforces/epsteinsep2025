“fit? the facts.of thé case”). “Expert eviderice can be both powerful and quite misleading because
against. probative force ‘under Rule 403... exercises more control over experts than’ over: lay’
witnesses.” Daubert v..Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 595 (1993) (internal.
quotation.marks and citations omitted).

Dr. Loftus has elsewhere testified that leading questions by the Government and response
pressure:can.create suggestive:memorics. But at:no time:has the defendant elicited testimony from.
Jane, Kate, Carolyn,or Annie: that they were asked.such questions or subject to such ‘pressure.
Accordingly, testimony from. Dr. Loftus on that point docs not fit the facts of the case arid. has. iio
probative valuc. It:also would substantially prejudice the Government'by suggesting tothe jury—
without evidence=that the Government. or,.a therapist manufactured. false memories in the Minor:
Victims. Dr. Loftus*s opinion on. suggestive activities therefore should not contain. testimony:
about, Government.questioning or response pressure exerted. by therapists.

Vv. The Court Should. Preclidé Testimony from John Lopez About Undisclosed
Exhibits.

Finally, the Court, should, preclude testimony from John Lopez about-undisclosed. exhibits.
Lopez is expected to, testify about. financial. records in ‘the casc. Although ‘the defendant, sent: a.
letter purporting to notice Lopez.as an.cxpert:witness in an.abundance of caution, the Government
‘understands. ‘from conferring with the defense that the defendant does, not plan, to clicit: expert:

testimony from him."

+ The Government ‘has.also received no supplemental-expert-notice for Lopez. As the Government.
explained jin its. motion. to preclude: expert ‘testimony :from Lopez, the: original expert: notice was
‘insufficient.
