uf suspended attorney named Catherine Conrad, the same name as
# Juror No. 1?
Fe A. Iwas never in a position where I needed to or had to make
4 decisions about the investigation. I don't understand that I'm
3) here as an expert witness. I can tell you as a matter of fact
6 what I knew, what I was told, the conversations I had, but I
Ff really can't go beyond that, Mr. Okula.
8 Q. You're not going to answer my question? You've hired
9 private investigators many times as a lawyer, right?
10 A. I have.
11 0, Are you unwilling to answer the question that I just asked
LZ about what steps you would take if you learned that Catherine
i Conrad, a suspended attorney, was in existence and you knew you
14 had Catherine Conrad sitting in seat number 1? Are you not
is going to answer that question?
16 A. What you are ignoring is it's such a far-fetched idea that
17 any citizen would come in here and lie to be a juror. I have
18 never experienced it as a practicing lawyer. It never occurred
19 to me it happened in this trial, and it's not something I have
20 ever thought about it. When I've used investigators it's ,
21 because I'm defending someone in a criminal case or civil case
ae and I want to look at facts, You're asking me to speculate and
23 give opinions about an experience I've never had.
24 MR. OKULA: Judge, I have no further questions for Mr.
25 Berke.
