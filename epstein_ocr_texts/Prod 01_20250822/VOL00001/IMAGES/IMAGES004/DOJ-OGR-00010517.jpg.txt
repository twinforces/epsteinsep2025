Porensic-Psychiatric Report
Ghislaine Maxwell

Ms. Maxwell reported that she has filed over 100 grievances regarding the conditions
of her pretrial confinement since her incarceration at the MDC 1n July of 2020. I reviewed
numerous grievances filed to the court by Ms. Maxwell’s legal team since her incarceration,
which allege that Ms. Maxwell has been subject to physical and emotional abuse by the
correction officers, poor and unsanitary living conditions, malnutrition, difficulties reviewing
the millions of legal discovery documents 1n the case against her, and sleep deprivation. She 1s
currently housed in segregation from all other inmates, reportedly with a team of 10 correction
officers at a time — three officers are on duty from 7am until 8pm, and two officers from 8pm
until 7am — groups of which rotate on a bi-weekly basis and many of the officers are reportedly
often hostile toward her. here are cameras on her constantly, some are stationary and one
camera is on wheels and follows her as she moves throughout the facility. Ms. Maxwell
reported that she has been threatened by correction officers that she will be subject to
discipline if she is ever out of the camera’s view.

Ms. Maxwell reported that she is subject to numerous pat searches per day, despite
being completely isolated, during which she alleges to have been touched in a sexually
inappropriate manner by correction officers on multiple occasions. Ms. Maxwell reported that
in January of 2021, a correction officer grabbed her breast with intense pressure during a
routine pat search, causing her significant discomfort and pain. She reported that she often
refuses to go to recreation to avoid being searched, which has negatively impacted her physical
health because she is unable to get fresh air or exercise. She was reportedly denied an extra
blanket in the winter and on more than one occasion an officer took one of her blankets from
her after her request for an extra blanket was granted. She further reported that she was not
provided a proper food regimen for the first few months she was incarcerated, wherein she
was provided with small, inadequate portions or rotten food. She has reportedly lost at least
15 pounds since her incarceration and has experienced hair loss. She reported that currently,
she suffers from constant headaches and back pain.

Ms. Maxwell is subject to flashlights being shined on the ceiling of her cell in 15-minute
intervals every night since she has been incarcerated. A letter authored by U.S. Attorney
Audrey Strauss states, “... MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes because
the defendant, while not on suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule...because
MDC has identified a number of factors that raise heightened safety and security concerns
with respect to this detendant.”! Ms. Maxwell reported that these flashlight checks have
significantly hindered her ability to sleep, as she frequently wakes up every time the guards
shine the flashlight into her cell. When she was brought from the detention facility to court,
she was awoken at 3am, transported, and held in a cold cell for hours prior to her scheduled
court appearatice.

Upon my initial meeting with Ms. Maxwell in October 2020, she did not manitest
psychiatric symptoms of any kind. She was coherent, optimistic, and confident in her ability
to defend herself in court. Over time, she has manifest depressive symptoms, anxiety, and
