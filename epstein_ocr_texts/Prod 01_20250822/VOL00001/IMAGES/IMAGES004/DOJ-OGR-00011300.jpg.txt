Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:
The Government writes in opposition to the defendant’s motion for an arrest warrant for
Kelly Bovino. It is not clear that Bovino is under subpoena for the same reasons Robert Glassman
has previously articulated.! Assuming she is, however, the defense letter correctly states that the
Court “has authority” to issue an arrest warrant. (Def. Letter at 2-3). But the Court is not required
to do so, and in this case, the Court should exercise its discretion to not sign the arrest warrant.
The defendant has been aware of the 3500 material that forms the basis of the defendant’s
' The defense subpoena was served on November 30, 2021, (see Def. Letter Ex. 2), but it required
her to appear at the United States Courthouse at 9:00 a.m. on November 29, 2021 (see id. Ex. 1)—
an impossibility. The defense has cited no law for the proposition that Bovino has refused to
“comply with an order of the court to testify,” 28 U.S.C. § 1826, by failing to comply with a
subpoena with which she could never have complied.
