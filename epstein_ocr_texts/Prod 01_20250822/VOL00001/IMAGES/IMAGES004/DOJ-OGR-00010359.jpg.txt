personal memories, some from decades earlier and some involving sensitive or tragic events. So
long as jurors can be fair and impartial and decide the case based solely on the evidence and the
law as instructed, then it is those “very human elements that constitute one of the strengths of our
jury system, and we cannot and should not excommunicate them from jury deliberations.” U.S.
ex rel. Owen, 435 F.2d at 818. In any event, Rule 606(b) bars the Court from relying on these
statements because they pertain to Juror 50’s “mental processes concerning the verdict or
indictment.” Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(1). “[P]arsing how jurors considered the evidence or their
mental states while hearing testimony is exactly what Tanner and the plain text of Rule 606(b)

811 F. Supp. 828, 834 (E.D.N.Y. 1992) (Rule 606 does not permit inquiry into jurors’
discussions or “reactions to the evidence as it developed” (cleaned up)).

Juror 50’s “healing process” because the Defendant had not proposed comparable questions
during the voir dire process for other prospective jurors who indicated a personal history of
sexual abuse on their questionnaires. Hearing Tr. at 28-29. Moreover, that an individual has
undergone a “healing process” at some point in his life does not evince that the experience
interferes with his ability to be fair and impartial. Juror 50 credibly testified that his sexual abuse
is not usually on his mind, that the subject matter would not upset him in a way that would
distract him from his duty, and that he would not think about his own experience in a way that
