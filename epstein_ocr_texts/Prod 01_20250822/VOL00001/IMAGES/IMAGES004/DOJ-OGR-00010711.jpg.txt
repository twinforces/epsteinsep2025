receiving the most information possible in making its sentencing decision and allow all the victims of
all Maxwell’s sex trafficking crimes to speak.

IV. If the Court Does Not Believe that Sarah and Elizabeth Are Entitled to be Heard at

Sentencing, They Should Be Given Additional Time to Brief and Argue the Issue

For all the reasons just explained, Sarah and Elizabeth believe that they have established
entitlement to deliver their victim impact statements at Maxwell’s sentencing. But if, for any reason,
the Court has doubts about this issue, Sarah and Elizabeth respectfully request additional time to
develop factual and legal arguments in support of their position. Sarah and Elizabeth have had just
48 hours to respond to the Court’s June 21* order setting out procedures for briefing this issue. Such
a short time frame has deprived them of an opportunity to develop both factual and legal arguments
supporting their position. The Court should give them additional time to develop their position.

CONCLUSION

For all these reasons, the Court should allow Sarah and Elizabeth to orally deliver their
victim impact statements at Maxwell’s sentencing or, in the alternative, provide them with additional
time to further brief this issue.
