1. The Government indicated in a redacted footnote that it believed the juror to be Juror 50, and
a review of his questionnaire showed that he had provided a negative response to a question that
asked whether a prospective juror had been a victim of sexual abuse. Jd. at 2 n.2.! Finally, the
Government requested that the Court offer court-appointed counsel to the juror in the event a
hearing was ordered. A letter from the Defendant followed shortly thereafter also informing the
Court about the juror’s interviews. Dkt. No. 569. The Defendant filed a second letter that same

informed him that the Court was unable to provide any guidance or response to his question. Juror 50 then asked the
District Executive if he could access his questionnaire. The District Executive, again at the Court’s direction,
informed Juror 50 that the questionnaire was not a public document and could not be provided to him.
