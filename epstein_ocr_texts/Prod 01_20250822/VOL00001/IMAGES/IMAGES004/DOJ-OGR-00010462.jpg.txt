great-ability toget-on well with people from all‘walks of life, artistic creativity,
and. ‘caring about others. Her work was. a. far. cry’ from the “flippity-jibit
socialite’ label. that the media, has decided to cast on. her every: time they

[F]rom a ‘very carly age cach. of us had. to learn and demonstrate: what our father
termed. “the 3. Cs? Consideration, Concentration. arid. Conciseness” and to “always.
treat others. as you would like to be treated yourself.” We were quizzed, on, these:
them: Ghislaine w was no 6 exception. in “deeply absorbing, exhibiting and living these
values. For example, | think:it is no small feat.to train and. become a helicopter'pilot,
an Emergeney. Medical. Technician (EMT),submersible. pilot and more, as they’ all.
require dedication, concentration and quick thinking and reactions and no small
amount of courage.

My sister was also ‘very. entrepreneurial. in creating’ and investing’ in multiple
conipanics andorganizations which created. products and. services, as well as
employment. An important example is that in 2012, Ghislaine: turned.a_ lifelong
passion for the oceans. into a non- -profit, The TerraMar Pi ‘eject, with the mission
to ereate'a "global. oecan community" based onthe idea, of shared ownership’ and
responsibility of the global, ““commons”—the high. seas or international waters.

them. ‘She also has an enduring capacity. for'fricndship, a warm heart, and the ability
to.convert.those feclings into action when required to help. those less fortunate than.
herself. She had discrectly: supported some friends financially and others by
providing a, roof over their heads when. they were down on. their luck, often for
weeks at a-time.

Exhibit E.

Ghislaine is an intelligent, warm. hearted, gencrous, kind, funny, thoughtful. and.
loving person. She cares about others. Ghislaine's first reaction,on hearing of a.
problem is how tosolve it or how to contribute toa. solution. Her desire’ is always
to. cngage, to bring energy toévery problem and to. help.
