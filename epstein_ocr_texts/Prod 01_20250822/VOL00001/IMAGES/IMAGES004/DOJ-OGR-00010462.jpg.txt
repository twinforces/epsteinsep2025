great ability toget on well with people from all walks of life, artistic creativity,
and caring about others. Her work was a far cry from the ‘flippity-jibit
socialite’ label that the media has decided to cast on her every time they
reference her.

Exhibit C.
[F]rom a very early age each of us had to learn and demonstrate what our father
termed “the 3 Cs: Consideration, Concentration and Conciseness” and to “always
treat others as you would like to be treated yourself.” We were quizzed on these
principles constantly and had to regularly report examples of how we followed
them. Ghislaine was no exception in deeply absorbing, exhibiting and living these
values. For example, I think it is no small feat to train and become a helicopter pilot,
an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT),submersible pilot and more, as they all
require dedication, concentration and quick thinking and reactions and no small
amount of courage.
My sister was also very entrepreneurial in creating and investing in multiple
companies andorganizations which created products and services, as well as
employment. An important example is that in 2012, Ghislaine turned a lifelong
passion for the oceans into a non-profit, The TerraMar Project, with the mission
to create a "global ocean community” based on the idea of shared ownership and
responsibility of the global “commons”—the high seas or international waters.

Exhibit D.

Her brothers, Jan and Kevin Maxwell, confirm the support Ghislaine has provided to

others:
My sister is Aunt to 13 nieces and nephews (now aged 18 to 37) and I have
witnessed at first hand over the years her generosity to them — be it paying their
school fees, mentoring them and they grew up or providing job opportunities for
them. She also has an enduring capacity for friendship, a warm heart, and the ability
to convert those feelings into action when required to help those less fortunate than
herself. She had discreetly supported some friends financially and others by
providing a roof over their heads when they were down on their luck, often for
weeks at a time.

Exhibit E.
Ghislaine is an intelligent, warm hearted, generous, kind, funny, thoughtful and
loving person. She cares about others. Ghislaine's first reaction on hearing of a
problem is how tosolve it or how to contribute to a solution. Her desire is always
to engage, to bring energy toevery problem and to help.
