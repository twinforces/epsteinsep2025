Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S220 Cr..330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

We respectfully submit this letter following the hearing on March 8, 2022 (the
“Hearing”) in further support of Ghislaine Maxwell’s.Motion, for.a. New Trial. (“Motion”).

The ‘Court has now heard. from,Juror 50: in his ‘own words. If there is one thing we
léartied from Juror.50.at the Hearing, it is this: he should neverhave been a member of this jury:
Juror 50 conceded that he gave false responses'to not one, but three critical questions on the juror
questionnaire, all of which, had he ‘answered them truthfully, would have revealed-his prior
sexual abuse. The abuse Juror 50 described atthe Hearing, which he-should. have disclosed. on
the questionnaire’ and during voir dire, was remarkably. similar to the dbuse described by the
govermment’s four key victim witnesses and. would, by itself, have formed’the basis for a
challenge for cause. Morcover, his answers'to the Court’s questions, which he:gave after careful.
preparation by his attorney and-under'the’protection, of government-granted. immunity, alternated
between. inconsistent, implausible, and, contradictory, and. at all 'times, lacked credibility:

Juror 50’s: explanation, that‘he “flew through” the questionnaire: does not hold water, and.
his repeated after-the-fact assurances that the sexual abuse he suffered .as‘a,child did not: affect:
his ability to be:a fair and impartial juror'were sclf-scrving and simply:not believable. Like

anyone in his position, Juror 50 docs. not want to be responsible for the retrial of Ghislaine
