1 children of their rapists, then we must take a stand on zero

2 tolerance to those who abuse their power to groom and traffic

3 and rape the vulnerable.

4 How you do anything is how you do everything. Every

5) single person should have equal value. Every single person

6 should have an equal right to be protected. Every single child
7 must have their innocence defended. No person should be

8 shielded from the consequences of their actions no matter their
9 status or class. Ghislaine's lack of remorse and her blatant
10 refusal to take responsibility for her crimes towards us is the
11 final insult.

12 Having a difficult childhood is irrelevant to the

13 choices she made to traffic and supply women/children to

14 Jeffrey Epstein and other powerful men. Despite the atrocities
15 perpetrated on me, I have never recruited a child or any person
16 to be sexually abused. Someone being a hard worker does not

17 excuse sex trafficking of minors. Someone starting a

18 non-profit does not excuse sex trafficking of minors. Someone
19 who had it difficult or even an abusive father does not excuse
20 sex trafficking of minors. Losing money and prestige does not
21 excuse sex trafficking of minors. The lack of remorse or
22 responsibility taken by Ghislaine for how she ruined the lives
23 of countless women and children is exactly how we can tell that
24 she doesn't think what she did is wrong. She is not sorry, and
25 she would do it again.
