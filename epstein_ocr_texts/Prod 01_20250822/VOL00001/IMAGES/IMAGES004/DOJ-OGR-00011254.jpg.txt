e Testimony from John Lopez about undisclosed exhibits.

1. Applicable Law

Federal Rule of Evidence 402 provides that “[i]rrelevant evidence is not admissible.”
Accordingly, any evidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence of the charges

Notes). But even then, “[e]xtrinsic evidence offered for impeachment on a collateral issue is
properly excluded.” United States v. Purdy, 144 F.3d 241, 245-46 (2d Cir. 1998); see United Sates
v. Dore, No. 12 Cr. 45 (RJS), 2013 WL 3965281, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. July 31, 2013) (Sullivan, J.)
(“[T]he Second Circuit has held . . . that introduction of extrinsic proof of a prior inconsistent
statement is only appropriate as it relates to matters which are not collateral, i.e., as to those matters
which are relevant to the issues in the case and could be independently proven.” (internal quotation
