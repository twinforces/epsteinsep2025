the Calphalon company to Newell. Parse was introduced to Peter Barnhart, Calphalon’s Executive
Vice-President, Sara Jane Kasperzak, Dean Kasperzak, and other members of the Kasperzak family
in 1998. Asaresult of the work that Parse was doing in helping the Calphalon stockholders dispose
of their Newell shares, Parse became aware of the large taxable gains that the stockholders would
receive. In a meeting at Parse’s office, Parse introduced Peter Barnhart to Paul Daugerdas (then an
Altheimer & Gray partner) for the purpose of having Daugerdas pitch a J&G tax shelter to the
Calphalon shareholders. Parse subsequently attended a meeting with Daugerdas, the Calphalon
shareholders, and several attorneys from the law firm of Shumaker Loop & Kendrick. In that
meeting and in Parse’s presence, as Dean Kasperzak testified at trial, Daugerdas opened with the red-
flag statement that the information that he was about to provide was completely confidential and that
the shareholders could not even share it with the shareholders’ own investment advisors or
accountants. (Tr. 6243). Daugerdas then described the tax shelter which he said would result in the
shareholders’ paying virtually no taxes on the gains. Kasperzak further testified, “We were told that
the profit potential was very low and that going forward, should we choose to go forward, if we were
questioned about the matter, that our intent was in fact to make a profit, but in order for this tax
shelter to work, there had to be, in effect, a loss to balance off the gains from the stock sale.” (Tr.
6244). The urging by Daugerdas for the shareholders to make false statements about their intent is
wholly inconsistent with good faith — all of which Parse witnessed.

* The testimony of Erwin Mayer and other trial witnesses made clear that the expected short-
term duration of the Treasury note transactions, combined with the lack of volatility of the specific
Treasury notes chosen for the transactions, meant that the short sale was virtually certain to produce
only a small loss or gain on this purported “investment.”
