Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 681-1 Filed 06/26/22 Page4of/7

Under the CVRA’s plain language, “a party may qualify as a victim, even though [she] may
not have been the target of the crime, as long as [she] suffers harm as a result of the crime’s
commission.” Jn re Fisher, 640 F.3d 645, 648 (Sth Cir. 2011) (“Fisher IP’). Thus, the CVRA
“instructs the district court to look at the offense itself only to determine the harmful effects the
offense has on parties.” Jn re Wellcare Health Plans, Inc., 754 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir. 2014)
(cleaned up). Because of this requirement to identify an offense’s “harmful effects,” numerous
CVRA “victim” cases have found it necessary to look beyond the narrow “record” of the charges
themselves. See, e.g., In re Fisher, 649 F.3d 401, 403-04 (Sth Cir. 2011) (collecting cases) (“Fisher
IP’).

An instructive case comes from the D.C. Circuit, which reversed a district court decision
denying “victim” status in a drug trafficking case. The Circuit explained that in determining
whether a decedent’s family had CVRA “victim” status, the district court erred by “limit[ing] its
evaluation to the indictment and the statement of facts submitted by [the defendant] as part of his
negotiated plea agreement.” Jn re de Henriquez, No. 15-3054, 2015 WL 10692637, at *1 (D.C.
Cir. 2015). The Circuit noted that “[uJnder the CVRA, victims may participate in proceedings even
when there has been no formal charge.” /d. (citing 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(9) (victims have the right
to timely notice of a deferred prosecution agreement)). Moreover, “[b]ecause victim status can be
argued for even prior to the filing of an indictment, it is clear that Congress intended courts to look
beyond the four corners of an indictment or plea agreement. For example, in the context of the
[drug trafficking] conspiracy here, neither the indictment nor the statement of facts included in the
plea agreement mention violence of any kind. And yet, logic allows for the inference . . . that [the
defendant’s| paramilitary organization . . . employed violence and force as part of its method of
operation.” Jd.
