‘Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE, Document 681-1 Filed 06/26/22 Page 4 of 7

Under the CVRA’s plain language, “a party’ may qualifyas a victim, even though [she] may’
not, have been the target of the crime, as long as [she] suffers harm as a result of the criime’s
commission.” Jn ve:Fisher, 640 F.3d. 645, 648 (Sth. Cir. 2011) (“Fisher I). Thus, the CVRA
“instructs the district: court to look at the offense itself only to determine the harmful effects the
offense has on, parties.” Jn re Wellcare Health Plans, Inc., 754 F.3d. 1234, 1239 (11th Cir. 2014)
CVRA “victim” cases have found it:ncceessary' to look beyond the narrow “record” of the charges
themselves. See, ¢.g:, Inre Fisher, 649 F.3d.401,-403-04.(5th Cir. 201.1) (collecting cases) (“/isher
Ir’).

An instructive case comes from. the D.C. Circuit, which. reversed, a district court decision
denying “victim” status in. a drug trafficking case. The Circuit ‘explained that ‘in. determining
whether a. deecdent?s. family had, CVRA “victim” status, the district court; crred by “limit[ing] its
evaluation to the indictment andthe statement. of facts. submitted by [the defendant] as ‘part of his
negotiated plea agreement.” /n.re de Henriquez, No. 15-3054, 2015 WL 10692637, at *1, (D.C.
Cir. 2015). The Circuit noted that. “[uJnder the CVRA, victims may. participate in proceedings even,
when there has been no formal charge.” Jd: (citing ‘18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(9) (victims have the right
to timely notice of a ‘deferred-prosecution agreement)). Morcover, “[b]ecause victim status can be
argued. for even‘prior to the filing of an indictment, itis clear'that Congress intended courts’to look’
beyond ‘the four corners. of an :indictment or plea. agreement. .For example, in. the context. of the
(drug trafficking] conspiracy here, neither, the indictment nor the statement-of facts included in,the
pléa agreement mention violence of any kind. And yet, logic allows for the inference... . that [the
defendant’s] paramilitary organization .. . cmployed ‘violence and force as ‘part of its method of

operation.” da:
