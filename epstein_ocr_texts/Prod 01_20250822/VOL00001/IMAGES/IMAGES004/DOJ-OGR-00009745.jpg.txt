Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 642 Filed 03/11/22 Page 53 of 66

E. Juror 50’s material misstatements (and those of the second unidentified.
juror) prevented. Ms. Maxwell from exercising her peremptory
challenges, denying her a fair trial.

Proper voir dire plays.a-vital role in assuring'a defendant’s Sixth.Amendment right
to an impartial jury: Without an.adcequate voir dire the'trial judge's responsibility to
remove prospective jurors who may not-be able impartially: serve cannot. be fulfilled.
“Similarly, lack of adequate voir dire impairs the defendant's right to exercise peremptory:
challenges where'provided by statute or’rule, as. it is in the ‘federal courts.” Rosales=Lopez
v. United States, 451 U.S. 182, 188 (1981) (citation omitted).

The role:of peremptory challenges in a criminal.trial cannot be overstated:

Peremptory challenges have been, an integral, aspect of criminal. trial.

procedure for over six hundred. years: and. continue to be universally

employed throughout! the country. The underlying thesis is ‘that, with. the
exception. of challenges for cause, ‘the suitability of: a ‘particular juror. is
counsel's decision'and not the court's. Consistent with. that'thesis and subject

to constitutional, strictures, a peremptory challenge can rest on.a good reason,

a bad reason, or.no reason at all.

(cleaned up).

Fed..R. Crim. P. 24 entitles a number of peremptory challenges to prospective
jurors. Here, Ms. Maxwell.ecxercised all of her peremptory challenges and, whether for
cause or peremptory, would not have knowing allowed a juror ‘who: (1) claimed to be a
victim of sexual abuse; or (2) neglected to disclose that the juror had/been’a victim. of
sexual abuse; (3) misrepresented the status of the juror’s social media to remain, on the
jury. Had Juror 50 disclosed any of these issues, Ms. Maxwell would have used ‘a

peremptory challenge against.this juror and not.as to:any of the other remaining jurors.
