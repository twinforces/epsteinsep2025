The government did not timely disclose Examiner Flatley’s expert opinions, waiting until
November 26, December 3, and late last night to make the disclosures. Under Rule of Criminal
Procedure 16(d)(2), this Court can exclude these opinions.

Rule 16(d)(2) says:

(2) Failure to Comply. Ifa party fails to comply with this rule, the court may:

(A) order that party to permit the discovery or inspection; specify its time, place,

and manner; and prescribe other just terms and conditions;

(B) grant a continuance;

(C) prohibit that party from introducing the undisclosed evidence; or

(D) enter any other order that is just under the circumstances.

Fed. R. Crim. P. 16(d)(2).

“T]he government . . . violate[s] Rule 16 if it... call[s] expert witnesses who were not
timely disclosed.” United States v. W.R. Grace, 526 F.3d 499, 516 (9th Cir. 2008) (en banc).
“When the government has failed to comply with Rule 16, the district court has broad discretion
to determine what remedial action, if any, is appropriate.” United States v. Miller, 116 F.3d 641,
681 (2d Cir. 1997). “Tt is well-settled that a court may in its discretion preclude expert
examination pursuant to Rule 16(d)(2)(C) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure regarding
any topics or opinions not properly disclosed.” United States v. Mahaffy, No. O5CR613(S-
3)(ILG), 2007 WL 1213738, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 24, 2007). “A court may preclude the
testimony as a whole, or any part that it determines was not properly disclosed to the [defense].”
Id. “Even if the disclosure provides a sufficient summary of any opinions to be offered by the
witness, it may be excluded if the [party] has made no attempt at all to describe the bases and
reasons for those opinions.” /d.
