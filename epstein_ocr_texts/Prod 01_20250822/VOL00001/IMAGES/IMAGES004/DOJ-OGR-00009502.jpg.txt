2 Mr. Shechtman, do you want to be heard further?
2 MR. SHECHTMAN: I will and I will try to be brief,
3 Judge. I think really four points. The government has
4 repeated at the argument here what it said in its brief. Which
Me was that Mr. Parse benefited from the strategic choice that his
6 clients made and I'll hold the strategic choice point for
F second. But I take that to mean that he got acquitted here
8 because she was on the jury. And that, my father used to say
9 arguments were nonsense on stilts, and that is nonsense on
10 Stilts, I mean, your Honor knows exactly what happened here.
i ta There was a partisan in the jury room, a woman who couldn't
12 follow instructions and the like, Your opinion couldn't be
13 stronger on the point. And she was fighting the good fight to
14 convict him on 100 percent.
15 So to say we got the benefit of having her on there
16 because we were acquitted isn't worthy, respectfully, of the
17 government.
18 And the related point this was a split verdict, it is
15 a split verdict because she couldn't carry the ball as far as
20 she wanted to, but not because Mr. Parse benefited by her
21 presence.
22 The second thing I'd say is this. I take it there are
23 two competing visions cf what happened here, and at the end of
24 the day, your Honor is going to have to decide, One is that
25 what happened in that court, your Honor, in the plaza, is that
