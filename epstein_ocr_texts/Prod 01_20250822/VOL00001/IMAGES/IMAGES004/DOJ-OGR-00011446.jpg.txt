Epstein, and Ms. Maxwell—will somehow impair the: functioning of the EVCP in working with
others: Indeed, the EVCP is ‘now closed and ‘there is ‘no 'more' work to be done=the cut-off for
claims has passed, the money.has been paid, and the fund.is closed.

‘unreasonable or oppressive, even; though,the government moved to quash, given.“the absence of
objections from all but'one doctor”).

Finally, Ms. Maxwell’s due process right.to cqual treatment would be violated:were she
not entitled to inspect. the matcrials simply because they are! “confidential.” U.S. Const. amend.
V.. The judicial promise of confidentiality Ms. Maxwell received in Giuffre v.. Maxwell'turmed

out. to be illusory. after the government secured.an ex parte modification of the protective order
