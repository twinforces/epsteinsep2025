464 U.S. 501, 505 (1984). Public scrutiny is essential to “enhance[] the
quality and safeguard|] the integrity” of criminal trials. Globe Newspaper
Co. v. Superior Ct. for Norfolk City, 457 U.S. 596, 606 (1982). Openness
preserves and is essential to “public confidence in the administration of
justice.” ABC, Inc. v. Stewart, 360 F.3d 90, 98 (2d Cir. 2004).
Accordingly, we respectfully ask that the Court unseal Defendant’s
Motion for a New Trial and the questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors.
We also respectfully ask this Court to make clear that all subsequent
documents filed related to this motion should be filed without sealing and
with only the redactions necessary to adequately protect the safety of
jurors and their identities. We thank the Court for its attention to this
matter.

Respectfully submitted,
David E. McCraw
