will experience if it becomes public that she testified at the request of Ms. Maxwell cannot be
overstated. If her identity is revealed, My will be a prime target for media hysteria and
harassment in all its forms.

At trial, this rationale for anonymity extended beyond the alleged victims themselves to
include several witnesses and third parties. Exhibits with witness or third-party identifying
information were filed under seal or redacted. (As noted above, there were at least forty-five
times when an exhibit or series of exhibit was admitted either partially or fully under seal to
protect the identity or privacy of a victim, third party, or witness.) Thus, even though yg is
not an alleged victim in this case, that does not mean she lacks profound professional and
personal privacy interests in not having her true name revealed in public. Likewise, ay
should be afforded the same privacy protection as have other witnesses whose true or full
identity has been safeguarded—courtroom artists should be precluded from drawing her true
facial likeness.

Finally, Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights to present a defense, to compulsory process,
and to effective assistance counsel would be compromised without the protection of anonymity
requested here. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. As this Court said at the pretrial conference, “[g]liven
the sensitive and inflammatory nature of the conduct alleged, such publicity may cause further
harassment or embarrassment, and other alleged victims of sex crimes may be deterred from

by the defense. As to J in particular, there is no question she will face vitriol,
harassment, and intimidation once she yy is publicly labeled asa
