1 in New York and Florida during a three-year period. Things

2 happened that were so traumatizing that to this day I am unable
3 to speak about them. I don't even have the vocabulary to

4 describe them. In the most literal sense of the word, Epstein
S and Maxwell terrified me. They told me that if I told anyone,

8 I was once bright, fun, outgoing and kind. I loved

9 life and people genuinely enjoyed being around me. After

10 meeting Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, it felt like

11 someone shut off the lights to my soul. My secrets became too
12 much for me to handle, and I began doing whatever I could to

13 try to get away from Maxwell and Epstein. I changed jobs,

14 apartments, cities and even states to try to get away.

15 Everywhere I went, they found me.

17 finally starting law school. They found me again, and it was
18 more than I could take. I was hospitalized with a nervous

19 breakdown. It would be the first of over two dozen
20 hospitalizations in a decade following my involvement with
2l Epstein and Maxwell.

23 began to experience physical symptoms that doctors could never
24 quite put their fingers on. I could no longer even pretend to
25 be able to hold down a job or take care of myself in any
