matter. The request is not to intervene by a journalist for public access. See United States v. Aref,
533 F.3d 72, 81 (2d Cir. 2008) (motion to intervene to assert the public's First Amendment right
of access to criminal proceedings is proper). Nor is the request from a subpoena respondent.
United States v. RMT Co., 599 F.2d 1183, 1186 (3d Cir. 1979) (persons affected by the disclosure
of allegedly privileged materials may intervene in pending criminal proceedings and seek
protective orders). Although Juror 50 has expressed a questionable interest in the outcome of this
case, that does not afford him standing to intervene. Notably, the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure make no reference to a motion to intervene in a criminal case. This is a recognition of
the general rule that “a private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or
nonprosecution of another.” Linda R.S. v. Richard D., 410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973). And as one
court has noted, “[e]ven crime victims, who enjoy various statutory rights of participation, have
no right to intervene in the district court in a criminal case.” United States v. Collins, 2013 WL
4780927, at *1 (E.D. Wis. 2013).

The second request by Juror 50 is for discovery. Ms. Maxwell’s position, to be more fully
articulated in her forthcoming substantive response to this Motion, is that this request should be
denied. For purposes of the issue concerning maintaining the seal on public access, discovery
requests are not “judicial documents.” United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 519(S.D.N.Y.
2013) (“experience and logic show that there is no right of access to discovery materials”). See
SEC vy. The Street.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 233 (2d Cir.2001) (rejecting claim that deposition
testimony became a “judicial document” “because the Court reviewed it in order to decide
whether or not to enter [a] protective order’’).
