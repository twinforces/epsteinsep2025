defendant based on an unsupported, speculative leap from Jane’s testimony. That,is not plausible,
and it certainly is nota “substantially likely” conclusion ‘that can be drawn ‘from an inscrutable
jury note.

Second, even. if the jury was so confused, the Court’s:response ameliorated that confusion.
The Court did not tell the jury that it-could ‘convict. based solcly on conduct occurring in. New
Mexico. Instead, it referred the jury to the: instruction that: explained. that the: second element. of’
‘Count Four requires the Government to prove the defendant’s intent. “that. Jane engage in sexual
activity: for which any: person can. be charged ‘with.a criminal offense in violation. of New York.
Law,” and further stated that “Count. Four alleges sexual activity forwhich an individual could be
charged ‘with a violation of New York Penal. Law, Scction 130.55.” (Inst. No. 2:1). The defendant.

States v. Little; 828 E. App’x 34, 38 (2d, Cir. 2020) (“Such a discrepancy, however, docs not rise
of the offense.”). ‘For instance,.if the jury:had concluded that the defendant transported Jane from.
New’ Mexico to New York with intent to. violate ‘New York; law—which jis onc available reading
of the jury note—that would be ‘a, permissible ‘basis. for conviction, but outside the limitations.
