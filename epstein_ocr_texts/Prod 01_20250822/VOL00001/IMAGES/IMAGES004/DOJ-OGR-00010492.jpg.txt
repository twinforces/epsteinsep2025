people, she fully recognizes how much her whole life has dramatically changed. So she does not need
many more months, or certainly years, to pay for whatever crimes the verdict says she committed and
aim for rehabilitation.

You will surely sentence her in a just manner. I assure you that upon her release, under probation and
beyond, just as she never committed a single crime before her arrest, nor will she commit any other
crimes, and instead, dedicate her entire life and work to helping the world. I knew her to be
hardworking and committed to her aims throughout her young life when I knew her personally, and
through her siblings when I heard about her later on when she was in New York and elsewhere.

I want you to be assured of two things specifically, since I have treated former prisoners myself. First,
she doesn't need much prison time to learn her lesson the hard way. In fact, I'm sure she already has.
And second, she will surely respond to probation responsibly, and dedicate her whole life to ocean
clean-up from plastics and all the other debris, or indeed to other critical social causes. This is because

she isn't stupid, and after all this hellish fate re Epstein, the only way she will be able to create some
good out of her life will be through that kind of dedicated work. Her siblings will certainly support that.
The faster she can be permitted to rehabilitate herself in that way, the faster she will do only good in
this world. More time won't accomplish anything. Your honor, please believe me and only sentence her
to the lower range of the sentencing guidelines.

Thank you very much for your attention. Sincerely yours,
