M3 8TMAX1
approached the questionnaire process, whether He took ‘the
Court's instructions seriously, We would just propose asking
parallél questions about the questions he was, asked, ‘in, person,
in. particular because the juror was asked during voir dire
similar questions, abotit questions, of bias for or against the
government, impartiality. And so to clarify the record,
whether he took answering ‘those questions, in ‘person seriously
and. answered truthfully.

MS. STERNHEIM: Could we Rave a moment?

THE COURT: You may.

(Pause)

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, J, think there was several.
dreas of follow=up here that are warranted.

First, the juror made some reference ‘to his healing

process. I Couldn't quite understand what he said at. thé time,
victim of a crime, TI think we néeéd té understand his hedling
process and, what, he has gone through, because that affects his
ability t6 be ah ampartial juror in a case involving séxual
abuse. Is this something that he still is seeking treatment
for? Is this. something he is. stall thinking? How hé dédls

with the healing ‘process and how he thinks about himself as a

victim affects how he views the victim witnesses in this Case,
and I think there ought to be more questions about that.
THE COURT: What's the proposed question?
