2. ‘The questioning should encompass any topic on which actual bias
may be based..

Moreover, the questioning should be'significantly broader than proposed’by the:
government: Although Ms. Maxwell need not prove Juror'No. 50’s intent, whether he acted
deliberately is “is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate determination. of bias. . . .
Greer, 285 F.3d at 173. An.analysis of Juror’No. 50’s intent, requires consideration of the totality
of the circumstarices. And if only because Juror No. 50 has a:pattern and practice of giving false
answers to the Court, Ms. Maxwell isnot required.to accept .any post-hoc assertion by him that
he did not act; deliberately. Gf. United States’v: James, 609 F.2d 36, 46 (2d Cir. 1979) (“[W]hen.
attempting ‘to Show’ bias or interest, a opposed to bad reputation, the examiner is not'bound:to
accept the witness” answer, but is free'to call additional witnesses for impeachment.”).

The government; disingenuously suggests, that; the: Court;"nceed not inquire about. the
details of the victim’s sexual. abuse, just as the Court did not.probe such details with respect to
other jurors who answered Question 48 affirmatively." Resp. at. 34 n.16. Apparently the
government has forgotten that Question 48a itself (approved. of by the government). asked. for
details of ‘any affirmative: answer. to'‘Question.48, and. cach. of the:other jurors who.answered.48
inthe affirmative provided those details. in written forny when thcy answered, Question 48a.
There was. thus. io need forthe. Court'to inquiré the details during the live voir dire. For
‘example, the government points to Juror ‘189 and notes the Court only followed-up with the
question whether a question, concerning ability’to be fair and impartial. Resp. at 36. Yet; Juror
189s. answer to 48a contained the details of her alleged abuse[————s—S~S™~—SC_]
