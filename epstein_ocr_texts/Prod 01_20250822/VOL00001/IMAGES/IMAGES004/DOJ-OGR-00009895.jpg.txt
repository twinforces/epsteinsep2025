2. The questioning should encompass any topic on which actual bias
may be based.

Moreover, the questioning should be significantly broader than proposed by the
government. Although Ms. Maxwell need not prove Juror No. 50’s intent, whether he acted
deliberately is “is among the ‘factors to be considered’ in the ultimate determination of bias. . . .”

The government disingenuously suggests that the Court "need not inquire about the

question whether a question concerning ability to be fair and impartial. Resp. at 36. Yet Juror
189’s answer to 48a contained the details of her alleged abusc
