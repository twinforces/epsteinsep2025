Ms. Maxwell’s motion concerns an email AUSA Alison Moe sent her colleagues Lara
Pomerantz and Maurene Comey concerning an alleged conversation she had with Mr. Glassman
on August 17, 2021. Ms. Maxwell appears to seek to compel Mr. Glassman to essentially
corroborate a statement in Ms. Moe’s email wherein she states “He also mentioned that he had
told her it would ‘help her case””.

In the unusual effort to compel a witness's lawyer to testify against his own client, Ms.
Maxwell claims that Mr. Glassman waived the attorney-client privilege. It is axiomatic that Mr.
Glassman did not and could not waive the attorney-client privilege — only Jane could do that. To
be clear, Jane did not and does not waive the privilege in any way. And Jane does not authorize
Mr. Glassman to testify about any of his alleged communications with her.

Further, as a California attorney, Mr. Glassman is bound by California Rule of
Professional Conduct 1.6. (Rule 1.6 is attached hereto as Exhibit 2). Rule 1.6 prohibits an
attorney from disclosing confidential information of the client except in two extremely narrow
circumstances. A California attorney may only disclose confidential information if: (1) the client
gives informed consent, or (2) the attorney believes disclosure is necessary to prevent the client
from committing a crime that will cause death or grave bodily harm. Here, to the extent the
“ther” in Ms. Moe’s email refers to Jane, Jane gives no such informed consent. And Mr.
Glassman obviously has no reason to believe that disclosing any alleged communication he gave
minimum, distasteful and designed to intimidate the witness, and should be discouraged. But
procedurally, the appearance date on the subpoena is November 29, 2021 - two days before he
was served - making it impossible for him to comply. Additionally, Mr. Glassman was not
provided with a witness fee or milage fee as required by Rule 17.
