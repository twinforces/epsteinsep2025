Ms. Maxwell’s motion concerns.an.cmail AUSA. Alison Moe sent, her colleagues Lara
Pomerantz and Maurene Comey concerning aii alleged Conversation she had with.Mr. ‘Glassman
‘on August 1.7, 2021. Ms. Maxwell appears'to seck to ‘compel Mr. Glassman to essentially
corroborate: a, statement.in, Ms. Moe’s email wherein, she states “He also mentioned that he: had
told-her it Would “help her case””.

In;the unusual cffort to: compel.a witness's lawyer to testify against his ‘own. ¢licnt, Ms.
Maxwell claims that Mr. Glassman waived the attorney-clicnt'privilege. It. is axiomatic that. Mr.
Glassman.did not and could not waive:the attorney-client privilege-— only Jane-could do that. To
be'clear, Jane did not,and does not waive the privilege in any way. And. Janc does ‘not authorize’
Mr. Glassman to'testify about any of his alleged communications with. her.

Further, as a.California. attorney, Mr. Glassman is bound by California Rulc of
Professional, Conduct. 1.6. (Rule 1.6 is attached hereto as. Exhibit 2). ‘Rule, 1.6 prohibits an,
attorncy from. disclosing confidential information of the clicnt éxcept in two extremely:narrow
circumstances, A California attorncy may: only disclose confidential information, if: (1) the client
gives informed.consent, or:(2) the attorncy’belicves disclosure ‘is necessary to‘prevent: the client
from committing a.crime that-will cause death or grave bodily harm. .Here, to the extent the
“her” in Ms. Moc’s cmail refers to Jane, Jane gives no such informed consent. And Mr.
Glassman.obviously has no reason to believe that disclosing any alleged communication. he gave
minimum, distasteful and designed to intimidate-the witness, and should.be discouraged. But.
procedurally, the appearance date on,the subpoena, is November 29, 2021 -'two days before he

was served:- making it :impossible for him to comply. Additionally, Mr. Glassman:was not.
provided with.a witness ‘fee or milage fee as, required by Rule 17.
