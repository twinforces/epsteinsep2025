Case 1:09-cr-00581-WHP Document 605 _ Filed 03/18/13 Page 4 of 41
charged Parse, Donna Guerin, Denis Field and Craig Brubaker with a wide-ranging corrupt endeavor
to obstruct and impede the IRS in connection with the design, marketing, implementation, and
defense of four tax shelters known as Short Sale, Short Option, SWAPS, and HOMER. Likewise
incorporating the factual allegations of the conspiracy count, Count Twenty-Five charged Parse,
along with Paul Daugerdas, Guerin, Field, and Brubaker, with mail fraud as to the overarching
scheme to defraud the IRS through the design, marketing, implementation, and defense of the
Jenkens & Gilchrist tax shelters.

The proof at trial demonstrated that Parse — an investment representative at Deutsche Bank
Alex Brown and certified public accountant — participated as a key actor in the largest criminal tax
fraud in history. That fraud, which featured Parse’s five-year involvement in four fraudulent tax
shelters, resulted in the creation of over $7 billion of fraudulent tax deductions or benefits, $1.6
billion in Guidelines tax loss, and well in excess of $230 million in actual loss to the United States
Treasury. Parse’s role in the fraud - as one of the principal Deutsche Bank employees who steered
bank clients to the J&G tax shelters, established the evanescent brokerage accounts for those
shelters, executed the crucial Treasury short sale and options “investments,” executed the pivotal
transfers between accounts, and who helped facilitate the fashioning of the options and other
financial instruments used in the shelters - was indispensable to the shelters’ success. Consequently,
Parse earned substantial commission income from his role in the tax shelters — over $3 million.

For the reasons spelled out below and in the Probation Department Presentence Investigation
Report (“PSR”), we submit that Parse’s conduct, and the resulting harm, is deserving ofa significant
prison sentence.
