1. The Défendant’s. Motion for a New Trial Should Be Déniéd. on the Current Record

A. Applicable Law

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33(a) provides that, “[u]pon the defendant’s niotion,
the court:may vacate any judgment and:grant:a-new trial if the interest.of justice:so requires.” “The
defendant: bears the burden, of. proving that he: is entitled to a:new trial under Rule 33,'and before

ordering a new trial-pursuant to Rule 33,,a district court must find that there :is “a.real coneern:that

an. innocent:person.may have been convicted.” United States v. MeCourty, 562 F.3d.458, 475 (2d.
Cir. 2009) (quoting' United, States y. Ferguson, 246 F.3d. 129, 134 (2d. Cir. 2001)). “It is well
scttled that motions for new trials-are not.favored and should be granted only-with great caution.”
United. States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876, 879 (2d Cir. 1958). “[Rule 33]:motions are granted, only
in ‘extraordinary circumstances,’ and. are committed to'the trial court’s discretion”? MeCourty,

562 F.3d.at 475 (citing Wnited States v. Torres, 128 F.3d 38,48 (2d Cir. 1997)) (alterations in.

Similarly, Juror'50 told The Daily Mail that the jury “did our duc diligence” ‘before, reaching ‘a,
verdict, and, that.'the defendant’s decision ‘not to testify “was simply sect to one side and not
discussed during; x-deliberations.” (Gov't Ex. B.at 5). Juror 50 also, indicated that he, “[a]bsolutely”
felt “sympathy” for the defendant, and that the jury took their, job “very seriously because we took:
it as, this could be: our sister, ‘our:sister, could. be‘on trial here,” and.therefore: “[w]e: really have to
comb: through. the, evidenee and:make sure:we have enough, proof to say that:she’s cither guilty’ or:
not.” (/d. at 5). When. describing’ deliberations, Juror 50 indicated that the: jury: began. its
delibcrations “by reading ‘the. instructions. page by page” and then. “worked methodically through.
cach count starting with. count 2,” which was: the only charge on. which the j jury: did’ not convict.

and attached post- -it, notes as 18 they built, the « case > for cach a as they. saw. ‘it t and deliberated. towards
consensus.” (/d. at:9). He also “said he never felt pressure from citherthe judge or the rest:-of the
jurors to reach a verdict,” and that “(t]he prosccution:proved their case beyond a:reasonable:doubt-”
(id. at 9, 12).

To be clear, the Government. docs not’believe that the foregoing statements. are admissible ‘in, this

proceeding; they’ are described herein response to the defendant’s selective presentation of Juror
50’s description of déliberations.
