1 THE COURT: What I was going to say to that request is
2 essentially what you've done, which is that I'm happy to try

3 with the electronic. So, of course, the concern is that where
4 I've -- in particular, where I have -- I suppose there's two

a) concerns. One, where I've allowed a witness to testify under

6 pseudonym, it's possible that the material that you're using

7 would identify the witness. And so because of the way the room
8 is structured with counsel table screens viewable to the

9 gallery, we have to be cautious of that.

10 And your suggestion was to not put it on counsel's

11 screens, but to put it on my screen, the witness screen, my

12 deputy's screen. And what I was going to say to that is I'm

13 happy to try that, so long as it's completely clear to the

14 government what it is that the witness is looking at and what
15 you're directing the witness to so that there's no discrepancy
16 between what the government is aware that you're showing the

17 witness and what you're showing the witness.

18 So I'm happy to try that so long as you've got paper
19 to enable if that were to fail or if, in any event, so that the
20 government can have precisely what you're showing the witness,
21 and that youtre fully describing on the record any aspect of
22 the document that you're identifying for the witness.
23 MR. EVERDELL: Totally clear, your Honor. Absolutely.
24 And the government has informed us that they have
25 copies of the 3500 material, of course, and they have copies of
