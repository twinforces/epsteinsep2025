if they. found, that Ms. Maxwell had intended Jane to engage in, sexual activity in New Mexico:
(Def. Mot. at 13). The Court: was right to reject these arguments during trial.

First, the meaning of the jury note: is entirely ambiguous. It:is.at.a:minimum unclear (1)
whieh flights are referenced im the note, (2) where the, sexual, activity was. intended to occur, and.
(3) What question. is posed by the note.

The defendant argues that the note’s mention ofa flight to. New Mexico is a. specific
reference to'a,1997 flight-from New. York'to New Mexico captured.in ‘the flight logs that.lists both,
the defendant:and Jane as passengers. (See Def. Mot. at 14 (citing GX 662-R at.48)). The jury:
may have considered. that flight, or some other flight. (See, ¢.g.. GX_662 at.51 (flight, to'Santa, Fe
from Palm Beach. with Epstein, the defendant, and.“ female”); Tr. 316, (testimony. from Jane'that:
she sometimes traveled on commercial flights)). If it was that flight, the subsequent flight record.
departing Santa Fe did, not. include the defendant or Jane (see. GX, 662. at 48), providing no
information about'the. flight'that'the,defendantthinks ‘was'the. focus of the jury’s.attention. And to
the extent. it was a “return” trip, the origin of the trip to’ New: Mexico: was ‘New York, so the jury
could easily have inferred that the “return” trip ‘was also to New York. That.is, the defendant may’
or. may not be right about which flight the jury had:in mind. And ifthe jury: was.asking about this:
arranged, could have béen highly significant and. proper evidence of guilt. The: deferidant’s
presumption that the: jury was focused on this particular trip and. specifically on a return. flight. to

Florida, with.no relevance to the:case is mere:conjecture.
