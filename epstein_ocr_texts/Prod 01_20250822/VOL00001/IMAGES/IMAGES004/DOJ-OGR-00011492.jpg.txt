3. Do I have to stay pending litigation or dismiss my lawsuit in order to
participate in the Epstein Victims’ Compensation Program?

No. If you have filed litigation against Jeffrey Epstein and/or the Estate of
Jeffrey Epstein and/or related individuals and entities, you do not need to
stay the litigation or make any other concession in a pending litigation in
order to participate in the Program. Litigation may continue during the
processing of your claim in the Program. Likewise, if you have not yet filed a
lawsuit, you remain free to file a lawsuit and engage in litigation concurrently
with participation in the Program. You will, however, need to provide the
Program with information about the litigation, including the case number,
venue and date where the case was filed.

If the Administrator determines that you are eligible to receive compensation,
and issues you a compensation determination letter, you will have the
freedom to determine whether to accept the offered compensation. If you
choose to accept the offered compensation, you must dismiss with prejudice
any existing lawsuits, legal actions or claims filed against the Estate and/or
related entities and individuals set forth in the Release in order to receive
payment.

4. Ipreviously entered into a settlement agreement with Epstein and/or the
Estate. Can I participate in the Program? Do I have to submit a copy of the
settlement agreement to the Program? (Added July 28, 2020)

Claimants who previously entered into a settlement agreement with Epstein

and/or his Estate are not precluded from participating in the Program. The

Administrator will, however, consider the prior settlement in evaluating the claim,

as set forth in the Protocol. In order to do so, the Program must obtain and review

a copy of the settlement agreement. The Administrator recognizes impacted

Claimants’ concerns that providing a copy of the settlement agreement to the

Program could constitute a breach of the terms of the agreement. To address those

concerns, the Estate has agreed to produce a copy of the Claimant’s settlement

agreement to the Program provided that the Claimant, or counsel acting on the

Claimant’s behalf, consents in writing to the Estate’s production of the agreement

to the Program for purposes of the Administrator’s evaluation of the claim. The

Estate has also agreed that it will waive any objection to, and will not asserta claim

because of, a Claimant providing a copy of the settlement agreement to the

Program for purposes of the Administrator's evaluation of the claim.
