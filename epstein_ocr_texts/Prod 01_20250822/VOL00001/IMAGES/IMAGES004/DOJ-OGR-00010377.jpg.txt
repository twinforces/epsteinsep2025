minors for sexual abuse. Trial Tr. at 714-19. Applying that expert testimony to the witnesses’
testimony, the Government argued that the Defendant’s conduct as to each victim followed a
uniform “playbook.” E.g., id. at 2184 (“She ran the same playbook again and again and again.
She manipulated her victims and she groomed them for sexual abuse.”’), 2853 (““The patterns you
saw throughout this trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways
that you know that Maxwell is guilty.”). And the Government emphasized the many similarities

acquired underage girls by paying them for so-called “massage” appointments. Gov. Br. at 32
(quoting Trial Tr. at 40). To be sure, the Government in both its opening statement and its
closing arguments explained that the Defendant and Epstein’s abuse “evolved over the course of
