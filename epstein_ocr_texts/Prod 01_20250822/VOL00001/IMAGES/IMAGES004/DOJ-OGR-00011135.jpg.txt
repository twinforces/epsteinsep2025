witnesses’ testimony, not their qualifications or the reliability of their methods under Rule 702.
Def. Br. at 1, 5-6. But one aspect of the Rule 702 and Daubert inquiry is “fit,” which asks
“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied to the facts of the case that it

The Court will grant the Government’s motion and exclude Gershman. First, his
expected testimony is irrelevant. At the November | pretrial conference, the Court ruled that it
would “preclude affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the
investigation.” Nov. 1 Tr. at 17. As the Court explained, “[t]he length of the investigation, the
investigative techniques used, and the fact that the defendant was not initially a target of the
