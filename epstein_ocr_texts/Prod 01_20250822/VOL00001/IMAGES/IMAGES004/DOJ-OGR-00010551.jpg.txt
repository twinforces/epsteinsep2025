fully nude when the defendant walked into the massage room. (/d.). The defendant told Carolyn
that she had a nice body and touched Carolyn’s breasts. (/d.).

At some point, Epstein asked Carolyn if she had any young friends she could bring for
massages. (PSR § 71). Carolyn ended up bringing multiple girls to massage Epstein, including

would be paid hundreds of dollars in cash. (/d.). During those massages, Epstein masturbated and
touched Carolyn’s and her friend’s breasts and buttocks. (/d.).

named Melissa. (PSR { 80). Melissa was just 16 years old when she went with Carolyn to
Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. (/d.). Melissa went to Epstein’s residence to provide Epstein
with massages on multiple occasions when she was under the age of 18. (/d.). When Melissa and
Carolyn went to the Palm Beach house, they remained in the home for about an hour and then
returned with hundreds of dollars in cash. (/d.). An entry entitled ‘“Melissa’s cell (Carolyn’s
friend),” as well as multiple entries with Carolyn’s full name and an entry entitled “Virginia

“Massage — Florida.” U/d.; PSR 9.57). Thus, as a direct result of the pyramid scheme that began
with Virginia and continued with Carolyn, Melissa suffered repeated sexual abuse.
