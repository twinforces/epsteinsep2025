1 If there is a response that is too difficult or

2 embarrassing for you to share in open court, you may request to
3 speak at sidebar with me and counsel. However, if you have

4 already shared the information publicly, including in media

5 interviews, then I will not allow the sidebar.

6 There's a binder in front of you. I have marked the

7 document in there as Court Exhibit 1, so it's Court Exhibit 1

8 to the record for this hearing proceeding and you may open

9 that.

10 That is a copy of the questionnaire that you filled

11 out on November 4, 2021. Please take a moment and look through
12 it so that you're familiar with it and can identify it.

13 A. Yes.

14 Q. Do you recognize that as the questionnaire that you filled
15 out on November 4, 2021, as part of the jury selection process
16 in this case?

17 A. Yes, your Honor.

18 Q. I will ask you to turn to page 24 and look at question 48.
19 That question reads: Have you or a friend or family
20 member ever been the victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse
21 or sexual assault, and then in parenthesis, this includes
22 actual or attempted assault or other unwanted sexual advance,
23 including by a stranger, acquaintance, supervisor, teacher or
24 family member. Do you see that question 48?
25 A. Yes, your Honor.
