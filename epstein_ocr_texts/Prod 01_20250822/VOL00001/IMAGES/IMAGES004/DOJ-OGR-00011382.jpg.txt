Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 726 Filed 07/13/22 Page2of3
The Court’s Chambers also received an email from Defense counsel inquiring whether to
docket three joint letters regarding jury strikes that were previously filed with the Court, but not
docketed. Because docketing the letters would not undermine the important interest of
protecting juror anonymity and privacy, the parties ace ORDERED to docket the three letters on
or before 12:00 p.m. on Friday, July 15, 2022.
Finally, to ensure a complete record, the Court has identified four additional documents
that have not previously been docketed nor subject of a sealing request:
e November 19, 2021 Administrator Feldman’s Motion to Quash Defendant’s Rule
17(c)(3) subpoena, with exhibits
e November 22, 2021 Defendant’s Response to Motions to Quash Defendant’s Rule
17(c)(3) subpoena
e December 6, 2021 Jane’s Opposition to Defendant’s Motion to Call Counsel to
Testify
e December 15, 2021 Jane’s Opposition to Defendant’s December 13, 2021 Motion to
Call Counsel to Testify
The parties are ORDERED to confer with each other and counsel for the relevant movants and
indicate on or before 12:00 p.m. on Friday, July 15, 2022, whether there are any requests to
seal or redact the outstanding documents. Any documents not subject to a sealing request must
be docketed on ECF by that same date. Any proposed redactions must be justified by reference
to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga.
This resolves Dkt. No. 698.
SO ORDERED.
