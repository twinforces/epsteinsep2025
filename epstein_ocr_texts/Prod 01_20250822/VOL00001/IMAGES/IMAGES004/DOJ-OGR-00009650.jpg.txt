m. You responded “Yes” because you carefully read the question and realized that
it was asking something different?

n. The two questions before Question 41 asked if information you had heard about
the case might make it difficult for you to be a fair and impartial juror?

o. You responded “No” to those questions?

p. By contrast, Question 41 asked whether you could put aside anything you heard
and decide the case on the evidence?

q. You responded “Yes” to that question?

r. Because you had read the question carefully enough to know that your response
to the question was different from the previous two?

21. Please look at pages 24 of the questionnaire. That is where Question 48 appears?

a. You told the reporter from Reuters that you “flew through” the questionnaire
and you don’t recall being asked on the questionnaire about personal
experiences with sexual abuse?

b. You also told the reporter from the Daily Mail in your video interview that you
weren’t asked about your sexual abuse history in the jury questionnaire?

c. When the reporter from the Daily Mail told you that Question 48 asked that
very question, you said “I don’t remember it being there.”

d. But you also said, “I definitely remember a family or relative or something ...
being sexually abused.”
