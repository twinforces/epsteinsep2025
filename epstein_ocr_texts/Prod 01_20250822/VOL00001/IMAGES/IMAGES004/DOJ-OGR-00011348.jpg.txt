(2) another, witness whose: character the witness being cross-cxamincd,has testified.
about.

By testifying, on another matter, a witness does not waive any privilege against sclf-
incrimination for testimony, that relates only to the witness’s character for
truthfulness.

Fed. R. Evid. 608.

Rule 608(b) permits inquiry, at the court’s discretion, into'specific instances of a
witnhess’s conduct.that are “probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness.” Fed. R. Evid. 608(b). In
turn, Rule: 403 “circumscribes” the court’s discretion even further “by requiring the court to
weigh the probative value of the evidence ‘against;the danger of unfair’prejudice from it.” Ad-
Vantige Tel. Directory Consultants, Ine. ¥. GLE Directories Corp., 37 F.3d 1460, 1464 (11th.
Cir. 1994) (citing Fed. R. Evid, 403). Where the specific instances of conduct are nof probative:
of truthfulness or untruthfulness, the; Court: has no discretion: to, permit inquiry on cross=
examination. Fed. R. Evid. 608(b).

“Rule 608(b) is intended to be restrictive. . .. The'rule docs not, authorize inquiry on
cross-cxamination into instances of conduct. that-do not. actually indicate a lack of truthfulness.”
United States v. Nelson, 365 F. Supp. 2d 381, 386(S:D.N-Y. 2005) (quotation. omitted). “Acts.
probative of untruthfulness under Rule: 608(b) include such acts as forgery, perjury, and fraud.”
Ad- Vantage, 37 F.3d at 1464 (citing 3 Jack B. Weinstcin.& Margarct A. Berger, Weinstein’s:
Evidence ¥ 608[5] at 608-45 to 608-46 (1994)). By contrast, unethical, conduct is not, as a,
general matter, probative of untruthfulness. /d. (“Anton’s borrowing’ from his clients, while
ethically questionable, is: likewise irrelevant:to his truthfulness as.an expert.”). Indeed, “[t]o infer
untruthfulness from any uncthical act ‘paves the way to the exception which ‘will swallow the

Rule.” Jd. (quoting 3 Weinstein. & Berger, J 608 [05] at: 608-49 (1994)).
