This is a case where alleged child victims of sexual abuse delayed disclosure of their
claimed abuse for many years. The central issue in the trial was the credibility of the accusers
about those claims. Accordingly, it was important for Ms. Maxwell to screen prospective jurors
and eliminate any juror with a background that would, consciously or unconsciously, make the
juror more sympathetic to the accusers, dismiss challenges to the accusations as overly
aggressive defense tactics, and credit the alleged victims’ stories because of abuse suffered by
the juror as a child.

The Court denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to have her lawyers question prospective jurors
on this topic, denied Ms. Maxwell’s request to include additional questions on the written
questionnaire on this topic, but assured Ms. Maxwell that the Court would “smoke out” potential
jurors who did not tell the truth:

I will individually, one-on-one, question[] the jurors, and with the parties present,

I feel confident that I can discern any clear dishonesty. This is not just going to be

a summary voir dire; it will be probing. . . . Ifa juror’s going to lie and be dishonest,

we will smoke that out.

Although given multiple opportunities to identify himself as a victim of child sexual
abuse, Juror No. 50 failed to truthfully respond to very clear and pointed questions such as “were
you the victim of a crime” and specifically, whether

Have you or a friend or family member [have] ever been the victim of sexual

harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or attempted

sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,

acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)

Had Juror No. 50 truthfully disclosed his child-victim status he would have been immediately
challenged for cause by Ms. Maxwell regardless of his answers to any other questions. In the
unlikely event this challenge was denied, Juror No. 50 would have been questioned, in camera,
