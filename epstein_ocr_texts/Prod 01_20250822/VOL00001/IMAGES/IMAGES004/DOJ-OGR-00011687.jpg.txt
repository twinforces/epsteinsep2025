1 your family and friends that you're a juror in a criminal case,
2 but you may not tell them anything else about it until you've

3 been discharged by me.

4 Third, do not let anyone talk to you about the case or
a about anyone who has anything to do with it. If any person

6 should attempt to communicate with you about this case at any

7 time throughout the trial, either in or out of the courthouse,
8 you must immediately report that to my deputy, Ms. Williams,

9 and to no one else. Ms. Williams will report it to me. And

10 when I say report that communication to no one else, I mean you
11 should not tell anyone, including your fellow jurors. To

12 minimize the probability of any such improper communication, it
13 is important that you go straight to the jury room when you

14 come in in the morning, and that you remain in the jury room

15 for the duration of the trial day. You should not linger in

16 the public areas of the courthouse on this floor or elsewhere
17 on your way in and out.

18 Fourth, do not do any research or any investigation

19 about the case or about anyone who has anything to do with the
20 case on your own. Don't go visit any place described in the
21 trial, don't read or listen to or watch any news reports about
22 the case, don't go on the internet or use whatever digital or
23 communications device it is you use to see what you can learn
24 to inform yourself about this matter. Again, I know that in
25 this day and age there is a temptation, but as I've made clear
