jurors—that were included on, the list,of jurors that the’partics agreed:should:proceed.tovoir dire—
that the Court “thought.should, be considered for excusing.” Jd. at 3:5-11. While'the Government
did. not: object. to the: Court’s proposal, defense counsel objected to excusing four of the 13
prospective jurors; those ‘four proceeded’to voir dire. /d: at 3:1.2-16. On November 1:5, 20211, the:
Court éalculated that the parties had agreed that 23...of the 694 prospective. jurors should proceed.
to voir dire, which. the Court determined was a “sufficient number to: get to the number of jurors
that 'we need.” /d; at 4:9=13. Thus, the Court had no occasion to and did not rulc) on whether to
strike:the prospective jurors whom only one party had challenged for cause.! The Court indicated
at the November 15 conference that it planned.to qualify 50 to 60 of the 231 jurors after voir dire.
Td, at-4219-20.

On November 16, ‘2021, the: Court commenced. the voir dire portion of the jury: selection.
process. The Court asked ‘prospective jurors several. follow-up questions. to questions. in the jury:
questionnaire which prospective. jurors, had answered. affirmatively, including, for example, the
prospective: jurors’ familiarity: through the media with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein; the
prospective jurors’ history (or'that of a.friend or family:member) ofprior sexual harassment, scxual

abusc, or sexual assault; and'the-prospectivejurors’ experience (or that of'a:relative-or close friend)

|The defendant. is therefore incorrect when she. asserts that “(t]he Court granted. all.23 of the[]
challenges , ‘for, cause made’ by the defense” that: the Government did not: agree with. (Def..Mem.

at 10). Similarly misleading is the: defendant’s ‘statement‘that, “the partics jointly agreed-to excuse
67 of the ‘114 who answered ‘yes’ when. asked. if they had been. a‘victim of sexual abuse, sexual
assault, or sexual harassment:” (Def. Memo. at. 9). That assertion ‘fails to note 'that a significant
number of those prospective jurors-had stated thatthey:could not be fair and:impartial.for.a number
‘of reasons, including ‘their familiarity through the :media with the: defendant and. Epstein; that the
Government agreed to strike or excuse many of those jurors for reasons other than, their responses
to Question:48; and. that the Court did:not ultimately rule, on whether any’ of those, jurors should be
struck for cause.
