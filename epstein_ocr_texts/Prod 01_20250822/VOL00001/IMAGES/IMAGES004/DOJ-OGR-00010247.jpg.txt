Thanks for telling my story. So if he says: I didn't expect

the world to hear about my sexual abuse, yet at the same time
he's télling Annie Farmer, one of ‘the Victims, in this, case,
pest-trial, "Thanks for telling my story," that suggests to me
that! hé warntted to be kriown, as, 'thée Victim of séxtal abuse, He
wanted to be seen as a champion of sexual abuse, and that this

explanation that’ he iS giving is Simply false.

There's also the Facebook. post that he made after the
fact --

THE COURT: Just a moment. I will ask him tq explain,
té6 reéoncile that if He Gan, that he said he didn't think
people would know about it with the fact that be went. on social
media and thanked ohe of the witnesses in the case. I will ask
about ‘that.

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, he said this is a verdict.
for all of the victims, which I think includes himself. How
does Ke reconcile that comment with the fact that he didn't
sexual abuse, meaning: I'm doing this for the victims of
sexual abuse. That's clear import of that comment. 2 think
that's a Conflict.

There's also his Facebook, posts after the fact where
he says: I can now téll everybody that I was a juror on the
Ghislaine Maxwell trial. What an ineredible, surreal.
experience. Again, telling the world that I'm out here.
