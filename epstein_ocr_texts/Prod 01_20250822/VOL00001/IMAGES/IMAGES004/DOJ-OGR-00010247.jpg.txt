1 Thanks for telling my story. So if he says: I didn't expect

2 the world to hear about my sexual abuse, yet at the same time

3 he's telling Annie Farmer, one of the victims in this case,

4 post-trial, "Thanks for telling my story," that suggests to me
5 that he wanted to be known as the victim of sexual abuse, he

6 wanted to be seen as a champion of sexual abuse, and that this
7 explanation that he is giving is simply false.

8 There's also the Facebook post that he made after the
9 fact â€”-

10 THE COURT: Just a moment. I will ask him to explain,
11 to reconcile that if he can, that he said he didn't think

12 people would know about it with the fact that he went on social
13 media and thanked one of the witnesses in the case. I will ask
14 about that.

15 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, he said this is a verdict
16 for all of the victims, which I think includes himself. How

17 does he reconcile that comment with the fact that he didn't

18 want to share with the world that he himself was a victim of

19 sexual abuse, meaning: I'm doing this for the victims of
20 sexual abuse. That's clear import of that comment. I think
al that's a conflict.
22 There's also his Facebook posts after the fact where
23 he says: I can now tell everybody that I was a juror on the
24 Ghislaine Maxwell trial. What an incredible, surreal
25 experience. Again, telling the world that I'm out here.
