requested to provide information.© The BOP employees and contractors we interviewed included
employees involved in various aspects of the emergency response, who worked at MCC New York in the
days leading up to the response and following the response, as well as other individuals with information
pertinent to our investigation. Additionally, the OIG participated in interviews of 15 inmates who had been
housed at MCC New York during time periods relevant to our investigation, including three who were
housed in the L Tier of the SHU on the day Epstein died.’ Those three L-Tier inmates were housed in cells
opposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of sight to Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9-10.
The OIG also reached out to one of Epstein’s attorneys to discuss the possibility of providing information,
but ultimately the attorney declined to be interviewed, citing attorney-client privilege (the attorney-client
privilege survives a client's death) and issues related to ongoing litigation involving Epstein’s estate.
The OIG also collected over 127,000 documents, as well as MCC New York video and photographs. Among
these were BOP documents, including staff rosters; daily logs and reports; investigative and incident reports;
documentation regarding inmate counts and 30-minute rounds; inmate housing assignment
documentation; inmate transfer documents; Psychology Department reports and medical records relating
to Epstein; Epstein’s institutional phone call records; MCC New York records of Epstein’s visits with his
attorneys; electronic communications, including text messages and emails of BOP employees and
contractors; MCC New York security camera surveillance video; records from contractors regarding the MCC
New York security camera system; service records for MCC New York's security camera system; MCC
New York photographs, including photographs taken of efforts to revive Epstein on the morning of
August 10, 2019; BOP policies and program statements; MCC New York Post Orders; and financial records.
The OIG also conducted forensic analysis of the computers located in the SHU and BOP cellular telephones.
In addition, the OIG reviewed FBI investigative records, including interview reports (FD-302), notes from
witness interviews and other meetings, and electronic communications. The OIG also reviewed Epstein’s
autopsy report and interviewed the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy on Epstein.

6 On a separate occasion, the relative contacted the OIG to say that the relative had “photographic proof” that the door
to Epstein’s cell was left open the night Epstein died. When the OIG followed up with the relative to request copies of
the photographs and any information regarding this allegation, the relative stated that upon further review, the
photographs did not show what the relative previously communicated to the OIG.
7 The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York sought interviews from inmates housed in the L Tier of
the SHU on the night that Epstein died, each of whom was represented by counsel. Three inmates agreed to be
interviewed. The OIG does not have the authority to compel or subpoena testimony from individuals who are not
DOJ employees.
