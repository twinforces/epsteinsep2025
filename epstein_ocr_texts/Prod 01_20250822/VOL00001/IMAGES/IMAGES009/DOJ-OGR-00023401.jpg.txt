medical record note reflected that, on this same date, Epstein was provided with his personally-owned
medical device. BOP witnesses told the OIG that on that same date, Epstein and Inmate 3 were moved to
cell Z06-220 in the L Tier of the SHU to accommodate the electrical needs of Epstein’s medical device. Of all
the cells in the SHU, cell Z06-220 was the closest cell with a direct line of sight to the SHU Officers’ Station in
the common area of the SHU, which was approximately 15 feet away.
Inmate 3 told the OIG that when he and Epstein were first assigned as cellmates in cell ZO6-220 in the L Tier,
the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 that he had a “cool bunkie” for him, an “old guy” who
would not bother Inmate 3. Inmate 3 said he told the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant that he slept on the
bottom bunk, and the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant said that would not be a problem because his new
cellmate slept on the floor. Inmate 3 said he was surprised by this response because he understood that
sleeping on the floor was not allowed and he had previously been disciplined for doing so.
When Epstein arrived in the cell, Inmate 3 recognized him and said he (Inmate 3) told the Day Watch
Operations Lieutenant that the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant had “jammed up” Inmate 3. Inmate 3 said
he knew Epstein had tried to hang himself and had just come from suicide watch. According to Inmate 3,
the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant told Inmate 3 not to worry, that Epstein was okay, and that Inmate 3
should keep an eye on him. Inmate 3 asked the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant if he was supposed to
serve as a suicide prevention advocate, that is, an inmate who is assigned to the suicide watch area.
Inmate 3 said the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant laughed and brushed off Inmate 3’s comment.
According to Inmate 3, COs brought two mattresses to the cell for Epstein and placed them on the floor.
Epstein put the mattresses on the right side of the cell, which is only partially visible through the cell door
window when the cell door is closed. Inmate 3 noted that Epstein also had two extra blankets, which Inmate
3 said was also unusual because none of the inmates had extra blankets.
Inmate 3 said he asked Epstein to please not kill himself or hang himself while Inmate 3 was his cellmate
because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. Epstein told Inmate 3 not to worry and that he was not
going to cause Inmate 3 any trouble.
that inmates were physically located in the cells to which they were assigned in SENTRY. Associate Warden 1 told the
OIG that the error would have been identified if SHU staff members had conducted a bed-book count, but there was no
requirement to do a bed-book count every certain number of days. Associate Warden 1 explained that during a bed-
book count, the staff members have a roster with them while conducting the count of inmates assigned to their housing
unit to ensure all inmates are accounted for and in their assigned cells. The OIG’s investigation revealed that these and
other cell assignment and recordkeeping errors would have been uncovered had MCC New York SHU staff been
undertaking inmate accountability measures, such as rounds, counts, census checks, and bed-book checks.
