I can help you.

I am now throwing you a lifesaver. You can donate to my university, the historically black
college, Morgan State University. Our accepting your $5 million will show the world you are
not a pariah and may help you avoid a conviction like Bill Cosby. The donation can be for
“The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics,” which will show the
world your support for women.

Alternatively PRX OOO ave $3 million “Breakthrough Awards” to two math
professors. You can give me a similar award BQU@OCR of Oxford, former President of
the Royal Society, wrote to me in 2007, “I thought your analysis of the bee epidemic was
nice, and could well be useful.” In 2018, I solved a problem of Pélya Prize-winne iii
which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a “challenging question” in 1976) about matchings in
infinite geometric lattices.

I am willing to publically stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you in
the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now.

If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will reject
your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my alma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 million for a
lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They’ve raised less than £10,000!

I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that accepting
money from you would be “a tough one for a UK institution,” but if you funded me as an
individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they might be
open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer and you’d
have an advocate at one of the world’s most prestigious universities publically defending you. I
could probably generate positive media coverage on your behalf as an Oxford don.

Cordially,
