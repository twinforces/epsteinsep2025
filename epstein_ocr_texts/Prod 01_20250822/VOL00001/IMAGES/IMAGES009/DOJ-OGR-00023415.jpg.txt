harming others. Epstein also agreed to contact staff immediately if he experienced any suicidal thoughts or
psychological distress. Forensic Psychologist 3’s report further stated that Epstein was receptive to her
utilization of cognitive behavioral therapeutic techniques. She wrote that there did not appear to be a need
for follow-up at the time and Epstein expressed a willingness to self-refer to Psychology Department staff if
needed. According to the report, Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and
SHU reviews.
On August 1, 2019, according to BOP records, BOP Receiving and Discharge staff, who are responsible for
processing inmates who enter or leave the facility, notified the Staff Psychologist that the previous day when
the U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) had brought Epstein back to MCC New York from court, they had provided
a form on which it was noted that Epstein had “suicidal tendencies.” The OIG reviewed the USMS Prisoner
Schedule Report for July 31, 2019, as well as the USMS Prisoner Custody Alert Notice that had annotated in
the remarks that Epstein had “Mental Concerns: Suicidal Tendencies.” The Chief Psychologist told the OIG
that the USMS annotates suicidal tendencies for many inmates if the USMS was aware the inmate was
previously on suicide watch. Therefore, the Chief Psychologist said the annotation was not abnormal since
Epstein had just come off suicide watch and Epstein may have told the USMS that he had been on
suicide watch.
Following receipt of this information from the Receiving and Discharge staff, the Staff Psychologist
conducted a suicide risk assessment on August 1 that included a review of Epstein’s previous clinical
encounters, medical records, and data in the Psychology Department and SENTRY systems. According to
the Staff Psychologist’s assessment, Epstein denied stating he was suicidal and was surprised that the form
noted that he had suicidal tendencies. The Staff Psychologist said that Epstein told her that the incident
report he received for the marks on his neck arising from the July 23 event had been expunged. The OIG
confirmed that the incident report was expunged. Epstein also said his cell mate talked at night and kept
Epstein awake but that Epstein wanted to give it 3 to 4 more days before determining if he wanted another
cellmate. The Staff Psychologist concluded in her report that Epstein did not appear to be a danger to
himself and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation and agreed to immediately inform staff if he had
any of these thoughts. Epstein told her that he had social supports in the community and that he had
reasons to live and positive future plans. The Staff Psychologist noted that Epstein was currently
psychologically stable and that suicide watch was not indicated at the time. The Staff Psychologist
concluded that Epstein’s overall acute suicide risk was low, and the overall chronic suicide risk was absent.
Epstein was again provided supportive and educative interventions and educated about routine and
emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff. The Staff Psychologist’s report noted
that Epstein would continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews and that he would be
seen by Psychology Department staff the following week to monitor his mental status and provide further
intervention, if needed.
On August 8, 2019, the Chief Psychologist conducted a clinical follow-up session with Epstein. According to
her report, Epstein described his sleep as fair and requested that he be placed in general population. The
report further stated that Epstein denied feelings of depression, anxiety, and any suicidal ideation,
intention, or plan. Epstein told the Chief Psychologist that he received the necessary documentation to
make phone calls and asked if his previous phone calls over the speaker phone counted as his monthly
phone contact. The Chief Psychologist stated in her report that Epstein had no mental health concerns and
did not appear to be in any distress. The Chief Psychologist wrote that SHU staff had not reported any
unusual behaviors related to Epstein. She provided Epstein with supportive interventions and
