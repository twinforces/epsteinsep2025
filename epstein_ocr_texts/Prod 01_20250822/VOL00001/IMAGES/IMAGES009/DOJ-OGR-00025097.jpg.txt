MCC NEW YORK UPDATES

*" Psychology has been providing feedback at Executive Staff
Meetings regarding inmates at-risk for suicidality and
discussing cellmate placement (both GP and SHU) for inmates
with significant mental health issues and suicide risk
factors.

= When inmates are added and released from Suicide Watch, an
email and a phone call is made to Warden and the Operations
Lieutenant notifying them of the addition or termination of
the watch as well as their need for cellmates. This
recommendation is also placed in the Post Suicide Watch
Report in PDS and the psychologist indicates exactly who
they contacted about the inmate's need for a cellmate in
the recommendation section of the report.

" Suicide Watch Books are reviewed daily by a psychologist
and audited to see if the Unit Officer and Lieutenant make
appropriate rounds and signed the log books each shift (MW,
DW, and EW). Inconsistencies are sent to the Captain and
Associate Warden of Programs.

Correctional Systems

*" Since September 9, 2019, inmates have been tracked when
released from court by utilizing the PP63 Sentry function
as opposed to tracking by out count. There has been no
issues to date utilizing this procedure.

*" All releases are being reviewed by a higher authority other
than the CSO/SCSS. Typically reviewed by the Case
Management Coordinator.

Correctional Programs
Inmate Accountability:

" New bed books have been provided to each unit. A daily
schedule of bed book counts has been established to ensure
appropriate accountability of all inmates. Bed book counts
are notated in the Daily Lieutenant Logs for Executive
Staff review. Additionally, an Executive Staff member is
present each evening to monitor this process and identify
discrepancies. All discrepancies are typically corrected
immediately.
