Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone
calls. So far, no phone calls.
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with
his legal team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to
9south and then he would not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he’s been
eating snacks from the vending machines and no proper meal.
Thank you in advance for your help.
Sincerely,
