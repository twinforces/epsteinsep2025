Good afternoon all,
Below please find complaints from Epstein's attorneys. Can you check to see if he has toilet paper and that
his CPAP is plugged in?
Thank you,

Good afternoon M
Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not
plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.
Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the
calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.
Thank you in advance for your help.
Best,
