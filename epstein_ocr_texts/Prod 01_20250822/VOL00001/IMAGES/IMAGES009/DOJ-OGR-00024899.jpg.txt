Good morning: Same presentation today, but he said he thinks his memory for the incident (injury to his
neck) may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. He is supposed to get his CPAP machine today. He is
aware he will be returning to SHU, but said he is feeling unwell due to his inability to sleep and numbness in
his arm. He requested to have one good night of sleep with his CPAP and will return to SHU with a cellmate
tomorrowf I told him he
can stay down one more night to receive his CPAP and a good night's sleep, but that he would be returned
to SHU tomorrow. It was explained that there is no mental health issues precluding him from returning to
SHU tomorrow and that we could not house him in the SW/Hospital area becaus¢""""" jor more
comfortable for him[>™* He will
remain on psychological observation today and will transition to the SHU tomorrow. Thank youlrrc |

AW Skipper-Scott,
Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.
He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse saw him.
