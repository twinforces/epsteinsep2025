telephone call, Epstein told Individual 1 that the press had gotten crazy, and they discussed personal things
such as books, music, and hygiene while incarcerated. According to the representations by Individual 1’s
counsel, Epstein told Individual 1, “They are trying to keep me safe,” and that his case would take a little
longer than he originally thought. He told Individual 1 he loved her, to be strong, and that he would not be
able to call her again for another month.
Senior Officer Specialist 1 told the OIG that he was not a witness to Epstein’s August 9 call, but he had
previously discussed telephone calls with Epstein and knew that Epstein had the requisite paperwork that
allowed him to place calls through the Inmate Telephone System. Senior Officer Specialist 1 told the OIG
that Epstein was issued the necessary documentation to make telephone calls when Inmate 1 was his
cellmate. Senior Officer Specialist 1 also advised the OIG about an interaction that he had with one of
Epstein’s attorneys prior to August 9 when he was on an elevator with Epstein and the attorney. According
to Senior Officer Specialist 1, Epstein’s attorney asked him about getting Epstein the necessary
documentation to make calls. Senior Officer Specialist 1 said he then verified that Epstein was able to make
calls through the Inmate Telephone System. When Senior Officer Specialist 1 asked Epstein why he had said
he was unable to make calls, Epstein responded, “[T]hey said they monitor those phone calls.” Senior
Officer Specialist 1 said that in a subsequent conversation with Epstein’s attorney, the attorney asked how
Epstein could get an unmonitored call. Senior Officer Specialist 1 told Epstein’s attorney that decision had to
be made by a Lieutenant or Unit Manager.
Noel told the OIG that after Epstein’s attorney conference on August 9, the Unit Manager plugged a
telephone line in the legal line, and placed Epstein in a shower area within the SHU where he was afforded a
telephone call. The OIG investigation determined that the legal line is an unrecorded telephone line outside
of the Inmate Telephone System, which is designed for inmates to use when speaking with their counsel and
therefore is not recorded. Noel said that after the Unit Manager set Epstein up with the call, he left the SHU
and did not instruct Noel, or anyone else to Noel’s knowledge, to monitor Epstein’s call. According to Noel,
the call was not monitored or logged. Noel said that approximately 15 to 20 minutes later, while Epstein
was still using the telephone, the Unit Manager called the SHU staff via telephone, told Noel that Epstein’s
time was up, and asked that Noel retrieve the telephone from Epstein. Noel estimated that Epstein’s call
lasted for 20 minutes and said the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and the Material Handler were also
present in the SHU during Epstein’s phone call. Noel reported that she took the phone back from Epstein,
left Epstein alone in the shower, and went to use the bathroom on 10 South. Noel said that upon her
return, Epstein was already placed back in his cell.
The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was present in the SHU on August 9 during
the time of Epstein’s telephone call but did not overhear Epstein’s conversation. The Evening Watch SHU
Officer in Charge also said that while Epstein was having his telephone call, the officers were distracted by
the actions of another inmate. The Material Handler said he did not recall seeing the Unit Manager or
Epstein in the shower area on the night of August 9, and did not have any knowledge or information
regarding a phone call made by Epstein that night.
The Northeast Regional Director told the OIG that if Epstein’s call was authorized by an MCC New York
official, then it should have been done on a speaker phone while being monitored by a staff member, and
the call should have been logged and a record of the call should have been created. The Northeast Regional
Director said Epstein’s unmonitored telephone call was extremely concerning because “[w]e don’t know
