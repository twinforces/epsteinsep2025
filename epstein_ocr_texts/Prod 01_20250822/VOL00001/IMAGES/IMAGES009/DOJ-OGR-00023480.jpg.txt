6. The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing

shortages at its prisons.
Since at least 2015, the OIG has repeatedly found the need for BOP to address staffing shortages, including
medical staffing shortages.® This investigation and review revealed the direct impact of staffing deficiencies
on inmate safety. For example, the Material Handler worked three consecutive shifts—24 hours straight—
on August 9, 2019, which was certainly a contributory cause to the lack of adequate means of accounting for
inmate location and wellbeing in the SHU. The Material Handler told the OIG that no one did the 10 p.m.
SHU inmate count because they were tired. Additionally, the OIG’s investigation and review found that in
connection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office
arranged for technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY) assignments to MCC
New York to perform necessary mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. Yet, during the course of
the TDY rotations, work was not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade because sometimes TDY
staff were used to cover shortages at MCC New York's custody posts. Without adequate staffing, the BOP
cannot fulfill its mandate to ensure safe and secure correctional facilities. The OIG therefore recommends
that the BOP continue to develop and implement plans to address staffing shortages at its institutions.

7. The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes as may be

appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.
The OIG’s investigation and review found that there was an excessive amount of linens in Epstein’s cell at
the time of his death. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require that SHU cells be searched,
but they do not specifically address the issue of excessive bed linens, which the Captain told the OIG
present a safety hazard because an inmate can use them to harm themselves or escape from the
institution. Therefore, the OIG recommends that the BOP evaluate its cell search procedures and make
changes as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.

to respond to inmates’ medical needs during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 pandemic. These findings are summarized
in the OIG’s Capstone report.
