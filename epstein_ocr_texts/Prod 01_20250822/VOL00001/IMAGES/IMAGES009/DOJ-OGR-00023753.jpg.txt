The request for the meeting should be sent to both MCC and MDC
Legal Departments. MDC Brooklyn’s Legal Department fax number is

12. Foreign Attorneys
Attorneys who are not licensed in a state or jurisdiction of the
United States must provide verification of their status as a
licensed attorney in good standing in a foreign jurisdiction,
prior to their initial visit. Foreign attorneys should contact
their respective Consulate Office, who will provide the attorney
official documentation (raised seal for most countries) stating
that the individual is in fact an attorney in good standing in
that country. The attorney must provide to the MCC New York
Legal Department, the original letter from his or her consulate
verifying the foreign attorney’s status as a licensed attorney
in good standing. Once the status of the foreign attorney has
been confirmed, that attorney will be processed as a legal
visitor for future visits for one year only. The attorney may
request to be placed on the list on an annual basis by following
the above described procedure.

B. Telephone Calls

ae Unmonitored Telephone Calls
Inmates may place unmonitored telephone calls to their attorneys.
See 28 C.F.R. §540.105; and Program Statement 5264.07, Sec.8,
Telephone Regulations for Inmates. All housing units, excluding
Special Housing Unit (SHU), have access to unmonitored telephones
with a direct connection to the SDNY Federal Public Defenders’
Office. Some units also have unmonitored telephones with a
direct connection to the EDNY Federal Public Defenders’ Office.
If the inmate’s attorney cannot be contacted on the provided
telephones, the inmate must specifically request Unit Team staff
assistance in writing. The Unit Team staff will review the
request, and if approved, the call may be placed from the Unit
Team’s unmonitored telephones. In order to receive an
unmonitored attorney call, the inmate or the inmate’s attorney
must request Unit Team approval, demonstrating that other
correspondence, visiting, and normal telephone use is inadequate.
Inmate requests for unmonitored attorney calls are carefully
reviewed insofar as important Bureau interests are not affected.
Frequent unmonitored telephone calls increase an inmate’s
opportunity to pursue illegal activities without detection.
Additionally, staff time and attention is unfairly focused on the
single inmate receiving numerous unmonitored telephone calls at
the expense of the many other inmates on a caseload.
