With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested last night and is currently being
detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an indictment tomorrow. His attorney, /S)G)NENOO EEE Nas represented
him in the past, and represents him in connection with our case and has been in touch with us throughout the weekend. He
went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but was just told he is not allowed in because he
is from out-of-state.
We’re concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the presentment (as we would be for any
defendant) and so | wanted to reach out to you—is it at all possible to address this issue so can meet with his
client this evening? I’m available anytime at POMOOF}to discuss, if that’s helpful, o an also be reached
directly a that’s easier (though if you reach out directly to him if you could please just let me know afterward I’d
be grateful).
thanks very much,
