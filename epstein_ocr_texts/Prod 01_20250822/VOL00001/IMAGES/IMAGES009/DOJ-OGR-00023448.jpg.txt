Chapter 6: The Availability of Limited Recorded Video Evidence
Due to the Security Camera Recording System Failure

In August 2019, the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York) had
approximately 150 video security cameras:(00 audio) placed throughout the institution. The Office of the
Housing. Unit (SHU) where Epstein was confined at the time of his death o on 1 August 10; 2019, including onéat
the énd of the L:- Tier wheré Epstein was' housed that showed any moverent in oF out of inmate. célls and in
the Tier’s hallway: In addition to broadcasting live‘videéo, MCC New York had a system that recorded the live
video feeds. Following Epstéin’s death, MCC New York'officials and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
investigators attempted to review video recordings related to the incident-and discovered that, although the
security;cameras were working and transmitting live video, recorded video ‘from most of the cameras in'the
SHU area was not available dueto a malfunction of the video recording:system that had occurred on July’29,
2019, ?, Including video from the cameraat the end of the L Tier. Asa result, while the L Tier'video camera’
was not being. recorded, “One of the c cameras that, had available, recordings from August. 9: and 10" was a
camera located outside a housing unit adjacent to the SHU. That-;camera captured video of a large part of
the common 'area of the SHU, including the SHU Officers’ Station and portions of the stairways leading to
the different SHU tiers, including, the LTier. Thus, anyone entering or r attempting t to-enter ‘the. Tier from
recorded byt that camera. In addition, the recordings showed the SHU Officers’ Station where the two. SHU
staff were:seated at a.desk immediately:outside the entrance to the L Tier. and diagonally, across from
Epstein's cell, which was:the first cell on the righthand side of the L Tier.

|. Background on the Security Camera System at MCC New York

All video' surveillance from MCC New. York's cameras was connected to-a' Digital Video Recorder (DVR)
system. The DVR system had two.data storage systems that: were labeled “DVR 1”-and “DVR 2,” and:each
consisted of 16 hard drives used, for ‘Storing’ sidigital recordings: Roughly, half of MCC New York's’ security
assigned to DVR, 1 only’ recorded to the DVR 1 hard drives, and cameras s assigned to, DVR. 2 only recorded to
the DVR'2 hard drives: Therefore, if DVR 2 crashed, no video ‘from the DVR 2-dssigned cameras could be
retrieved from DVR 1, and vice. versa.

The OIG's investigation revealed a history of ‘camera problems :at MCC NewYork. In August 2019, the
Electronics Technician was the only’such technician at MCC NewYork. The Electronics Technician told the:
OIG that when he began work, at MCC New York.in 2016, he, found that the facility's security camera ‘system
needed to be upgraded., According to the Electronics Technician, the system had not been properly
maintained prior to his arrival, the hard drives in the DVRs frequently: malfunctioned and needed to be
replaced, anid the overall system was. outdated, in part because the cameras. were analog.and not digital.
