Disk failures occur in DVR 2 of MCC New York's security camera system,

which results in the system being unable to record, although the cameras

continue to work and broadcast live video feed. MCC New York personnel

do not learn of the DVR 2 recording failure until August 8, 2 days before

Epstein’s death. Roughly half of MCC New York's security cameras,

including those located in the SHU, are assigned to record to the

DVR 2 system.
July 30, 2019 Epstein is transferred back to the SHU.”

An MCC New York Staff Psychologist from the Psychology Department

sends an email to over 70 BOP staff members stating that Epstein “needs

to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.” Epstein and his new cellmate

(Inmate 3) are placed in a cell within the SHU that can accommodate the

electrical needs of Epstein’s medical device.

MCC New York conducts disciplinary proceedings against Epstein for

alleged self-mutilation and ultimately concludes that there is insufficient

evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act.2. When Epstein

is psychologically evaluated in connection with the disciplinary

proceedings, he says he does not remember how he sustained the marks

around his neck.

MCC New York personnel attempt to obtain an estimate from Company 1

to run the wiring and conduit for the new camera system, which would

eliminate the need for BOP technicians to perform the work.
July 31, 2019 According to court records, Epstein appears in court for a status

conference, at which time the court sets deadlines for motions and

responses. Upon his return to MCC New York, the U.S. Marshals Service

provide paperwork to BOP that indicates Epstein had

“suicidal tendencies.”
database that contains information relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs
of federal inmates, was not updated to reflect this change because it indicated that Epstein was transferred back to the
SHU on July 29, 2019.
20 The OIG's investigation revealed that at some point after he returned to the SHU from suicide watch and
psychological observation, Epstein asked two different MCC New York staff members if he can be housed with the same
cellmate Epstein initially said tried to kill him.
21 The BOP’s inmate discipline program and the offense with which Epstein was charged is further described in
Chapter 2.
