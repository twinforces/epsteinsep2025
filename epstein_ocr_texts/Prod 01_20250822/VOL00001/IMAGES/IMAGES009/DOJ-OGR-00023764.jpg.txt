Administrative Detention Status. A non-punitive form of
separation from the general population used when the continued
presence of the inmate within the general population would pose a
serious threat to life, property, self, staff or other inmates,
or to the security or orderly running of the institution. This
housing status may also include inmates who require protective
custody, those who cannot be placed in local population because
they are en route to another institution (holdovers), and those
who are awaiting a hearing before the Unit Discipline Committee
or Discipline Hearing Officer. Program Statement 5270.07, Inmate
Discipline and Special Housing Units, found at Bureau’s public
website.
Additionally, all newly arriving inmates at MCC are placed in the
Special Housing Unit until they are screened and an appropriate
housing unit (general population or SHU) is determined.
