MCC NEW YORK UPDATES
Current Assessment:
Some of the issues identified are due to seriously reduced
staffing levels, improper or lack of training, and follow up and
oversight. Since January 1, 2019, MCC New York has hired 18
staff and lost 33 staff to retirement, and transfers within the
BOP and other agencies.
To date approximately approximately 148 staff from multiple
regions assisted NYM which we are very grateful for their
assistance. All subject matter TDY staff are required to
provide a report to the Warden prior to their departure. This
report is similar to a Program Review report and includes areas
of concern, tasks done well and recommendations. These reports
will be shared with the Associate Wardens and Department Heads
for guidance.
Further, to ensure the training and efforts that will occur is
sustainable, there will need to be continuous oversight by
leadership. Therefore, several positions will need to be added
to the staff compliment, such as an Associate Warden over
Correctional Services, a Deputy Captain, and an Assistant Case
Management Coordinator, Assistant Food Services Administrator,
to name a few.
