EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of
Prisons’ Custody, Care, and Supervision of Jeffrey

Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in

New York, New York

Introduction and Background

According to its website, the Federal Bureau of Prisons
(BOP)’s current mission statement is “Corrections
professionals who foster a humane and secure
environment and ensure public safety by preparing
individuals for successful reentry into our
communities.” However, the Department of Justice
(DOJ) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has
repeatedly identified long-standing operational
challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to
operate its institutions safely and securely. Many of
those same operational challenges, including staffing
shortages, managing inmates at risk for suicide,
functional security camera systems, and management
failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and
procedures, were again identified by the OIG during
this investigation and review into the custody, care, and
supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious
inmates, Jeffrey Epstein.

The OIG initiated this investigation upon receipt of
information from the BOP that on August 10, 2019, in
the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York,
New York (MCC New York), Epstein was found hanged
in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit
(SHU). The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner,

City of New York, determined that Epstein had died
by suicide.

The OIG conducted this investigation jointly with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), with the OIG’s
investigative focus being the conduct of BOP personnel.
Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of
Epstein’s death and determined there was no
criminality pertaining to how Epstein had died.

This report concerns the OIG's findings regarding MCC
New York personnel's custody, care, and supervision of
Epstein while detained at the facility from his arrest on
federal sex trafficking charges on July 6, 2019, until his
death on August 10.

Epstein is Assigned to the SHU on July 7

Epstein was assigned to a cell in the SHU on July 7 due
to media coverage of his case and inmate awareness of
his notoriety. SHU inmates are securely separated
from general population inmates and kept locked in
their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.

BOP policy requires SHU staff to observe all inmates at
least twice an hour and that Lieutenants conduct at
least one round in the SHU each shift. BOP policy also
requires multiple inmate counts during every 24-hour
period. Among other things, inmate counts and rounds
enable BOP staff to observe inmates and ensure they
are secure in their cells and in good health. Further, to
eliminate safety hazards, MCC New York requires SHU
staff to search SHU common areas and at least five cells
daily, and to search the entire SHU every week.

On July 18, the court refused to set bail for Epstein and
ordered him detained pending trial on the
criminal charges.

Incident Involving Epstein on July 23

While in MCC New York, Epstein was screened on
numerous occasions by psychological staff, including a
formal suicide assessment on July 9. In the evaluations
he denied having thoughts or a history of attempted
suicide. Psychological staff determined Epstein did not
meet the criteria for a psychological diagnosis.

On July 23, at 1:27 a.m., correctional officers (CO)
responded to Epstein’s SHU cell where they found
Epstein with an orange cloth around his neck. Epstein’s
cellmate told officers Epstein tried to hang himself.
Medical staff examined Epstein, observed friction
marks and superficial reddening around his neck and
on his knee, and placed him on suicide watch. BOP
policy requires that inmates identified as suicide risks
be placed on suicide watch until no longer at imminent
risk. The BOP uses a less restrictive monitoring form,
