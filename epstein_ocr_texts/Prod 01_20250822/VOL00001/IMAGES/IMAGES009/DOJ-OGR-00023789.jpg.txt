be for “The Jeffrey Epstein Chair for the Promotion of Women in Mathematics,” which will
show the world your support for women.

Alternatively SQM ORIG ave $3 million “Breakthrough Awards” to two math
professors. You can give me a similar award. oe Oxford,
former President of the Royal Society, wrote to me in , | thought your analysis of
the bee epidemic was nice, and could well be useful.” In 2018, I solved a problem of Pélya
Prize-winner RR which he posed in 1981 (he implied it was a “challenging question”
in 1976) about matchings in infinite geometric lattices.

I am willing to publically stand with you, and your gift could generate support for you in
the black community: public support is something you sorely need right now.

If you want to donate to a more prestigious university, the danger is that they will reject
your gift, but Lincoln College, part of my alma mater Oxford University, needs £1.5 million for
a lectureship in Pure Mathematics. They’ve raised less than £10,000!

I spoke with the head of the college and the head of development. The latter said that accepting
money from you would be “a tough one for a UK institution,” but if you funded me as an
individual and pointed out to them that I could then take up the lectureship for free, they might
be open to that. The benefit to you is that I would then be an Oxford University lecturer and
you'd have an advocate at one of the world’s most prestigious universities publically defending
you. I could probably generate positive media coverage on your behalf as an Oxford don.

4 Screntist Or Tue Year: Dr. 5. Allen Counter, (1) director of the Harvard
Foundation of Harvard University, and Dr. Benedict H. Gross (r), dean of Harvard
College and Leverett Professor of Mathematics, present the Harvard Foundation
“2004 Scientist of the Year Award” to noted mathematician Professor Dr.
Jonathan David Farley. Farley is currently a visiting professor of applied math-
ematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He graduated summa cum
laude from Harvard College with straight A’s in mathematics and later earned
a Ph.D. in mathematics from Oxford University. “Jonathan Farley is one of the
world’s most impressive young mathematicians,” said Dr. Counter. “He is a mod-
el of excellence for young people of all backgrounds, but especially African
Americans who may see their intellectual potential in him. Harvard is proud to
honor his achievements and acknowledge his fine example.”
