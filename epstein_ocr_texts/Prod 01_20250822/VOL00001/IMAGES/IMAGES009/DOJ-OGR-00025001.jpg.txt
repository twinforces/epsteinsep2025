Presenting Problem/Symptom
Inmate Epstein was seen by this writer for suicide risk assessment today, 7/9/19 at 7:30 a.m. for precautionary reasons.
He returned from court yesterday evening. He did not mark any mental health items or symptoms on his Psychology
Questionnaire (PSIQ) when he entered the institution. Nonetheless, Inmate Epstein has various risk factors for
suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense/trafficking charges, pre-trial status, and he had
a court proceeding yesterday which could have given him bad news regarding his legal situation. Inmate Epstein
returned from court after duty hours yesterday evening and staff notified the on-call psychologist. Inmate Epstein was
placed on a precautionary psychological observation status until psychology could interview him this morning to conduct
a formal suicide risk assessment in order to determine whether he is currently at-risk for suicidality.
