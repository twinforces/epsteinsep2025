An attorney may not call an inmate. Attorneys who need to speak
with an inmate and do not anticipate that the inmate will call
them must visit the inmate in person or contact the inmate by
letter. Similarly, attorneys may not fax documents to inmates
or to MCC New York staff for delivery to inmates.
2. Inmates Telephone System (ITS)
The Bureau of Prisons extends telephone privileges to inmates as
part of its overall correctional management strategy. See 28
C.F.R. $540.100, et seg., Subpart I - Telephone Regulations for
Inmate; and Program Statement 5264.07, Telephone Regulations for
Inmates. Telephone privileges are a supplemental means of
Maintaining community and family ties that may contribute to an
inmate's personal development. An inmate may request to call a
person of his or her choice outside the institution on a
telephone provided for that purpose. However, limitations and
conditions may be imposed upon an inmate's telephone privileges
to ensure adherence to other aspects of the Bureau's correctional
INManagement responsibilities. In addition to the procedures set
forth in this subpart, inmate telephone use is subject to those
limitations which the Warden determines are necessary to ensure
the security or good order, including discipline, of the
institution or to protect the public. Restrictions on inmate
telephone use may also be imposed as a disciplinary sanction.
See 28 C.F.R. Part 541.
Inmates must submit a list of numbers they wish to be placed on
their approved telephone list. Inmates can only call numbers
placed on their approved telephone list. Once an inmate submits
the initial list, it will be processed as soon as possible.
Inmates may submit additional telephone numbers once they are
assigned a Correctional Counselor or Case Manager from the Unit
Team.
Inmates are advised of the institution’s telephone monitoring
capability. See 28 C.F.R. $540,102. A notice is posted next to
each inmate telephone advising that calls are monitored.
Ordinarily, calls are paid for by the inmate, but in some cases
the receiving party pays. See 28 C.F.R. §540.105. Third party,
conference calls or use of two phones on the same number, or
other alternative call arrangements are not permitted, thus
limiting the opportunity for inmates to use the phones for
criminal or other inappropriate purposes. Inmates who use the
telephone improperly are subject to disciplinary actions which
may result in the loss of telephone privileges, and in some cases
criminal charges.
Inmates may place attorneys on their approved telephone list.
However, the calls are recorded and subject to monitoring. Such
calls are not attorney-client privileged calls. Inmates seeking
attorney-client privileged calls must request an unmonitored
telephone call as described above in section B{l).
