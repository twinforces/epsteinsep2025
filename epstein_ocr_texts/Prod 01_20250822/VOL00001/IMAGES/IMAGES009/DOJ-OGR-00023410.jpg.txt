companion program at an institution to utilize inmate observers, who are selected, trained, and supervised
by the institution’s Suicide Prevention Program Coordinator.
On July 9, 2019, the Chief Psychologist conducted a suicide assessment of Epstein. She reviewed Epstein’s
medical record and interviewed him, which revealed that he possessed some risk factors for suicidality.
Epstein denied having any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan, and also denied having any
history of mental health treatment or any current mental health symptoms. The Chief Psychologist’s
assessment was that Epstein had “protective” factors present that could decrease his risk of suicide. The
Chief Psychologist assessed factors that included his willingness to engage in treatment, view of death as
negative, future orientation, and the fact that he adamantly denied any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan.
The Chief Psychologist's assessment was that Epstein had numerous protective factors that outweighed his
risk factors for suicidality and that he had a positive outlook regarding his legal case. Epstein remained on
psychological observation pending a suitable cell assignment, and the Chief Psychologist noted that a
suicide watch was not warranted at the time of her report.
On July 10, 2019, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein for a psychological observation and noted that,
according to the psychological observation logbook, Epstein had been eating his meals, sleeping, and
interacting with other inmates. During this meeting with the Chief Psychologist, Epstein voiced concerns
over being housed in the SHU. Epstein asked the Chief Psychologist to be “single-celled” if he were to be
housed in the SHU and had also requested a shower, his property, pen, and paper. The Chief Psychologist
stated Epstein had been provided a shower on this date. She provided Epstein with coping skills strategies,
to which he was receptive. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan; and Epstein
stated he was looking forward to his upcoming court hearing regarding pretrial release. The Chief
Psychologist’s assessment was that Epstein was psychologically stable at the time and that he could be
released from the psychological observation area. She noted that Epstein would be housed in the SHU with
a cellmate and would be seen the following morning to evaluate his mental status and stability. Following
this July 10 assessment, Epstein was taken off of psychological observation and returned to the SHU with
documented recommendations for a cellmate and next-day contact by the Psychology Department.
The following day, July 11, 2019, the Staff Psychologist attempted to see Epstein in the morning and
afternoon, but he was meeting with his attorneys. Since the Staff Psychologist was unable to meet with
Epstein, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein in the attorney conference area for a psychological
observation follow-up. During this meeting, Epstein expressed concerns about a number of issues,
including not yet receiving his property, not having enough water during his attorney conference, and a
desire to attend recreation. Epstein was upset about having to wear an orange uniform and the Chief
Psychologist explained the orange uniform was because he was being housed in the SHU. During this
clinical contact, the Chief Psychologist provided Epstein with additional coping strategies, to which he was
receptive. Additionally, Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures for contacting the
Psychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes available through the
Psychology Department. Epstein continued to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan and was
