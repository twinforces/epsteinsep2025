Attachments: TEXT-.htm, Certification of Identify Form.pdf
Good morning
| spoke with folks here and confirmed we can proceed under our usual procedure for releasing medical/psych
records to defense counsel. Accordingly, please send me a cover letter confirming you're defense counsel of
record, the attached certification of identity, and a Rule 17 subpoena (no need to be so-ordered; a clerk's
subpoena Is fine). Normally we would require a HIPAA release as well, but privacy rights don't survive death
in this context. Once | receive the certification, letter, and subpoena,, | will have the USAO's Civil Division
authorize the records release as wall counsel pursuant to United States ex rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462
(1951) and the associated regulations.
Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.
Thank you,

Td
