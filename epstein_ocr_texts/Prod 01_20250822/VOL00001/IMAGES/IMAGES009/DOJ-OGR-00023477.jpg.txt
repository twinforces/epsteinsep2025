MCC New York's failure to ensure that its security'camera system was fully functional and make timely
repairs is. consistent with the OIG's previous observations regarding weaknesses in the BOP's overall system
of'security:cameras., Dating’ back to at,least.2013, the OIG has repeatedly observed inadequacies in the’
BOP's overall system of security cameras, including inoperable cameras, an insufficient number of cameras,
poor video quality, and inadequate video storage. In a 2016 réport on the BOP's contrabanid interdiction
efforts,'the OIG identified specific deficiencies with the camera system, and recommended that the BOP
evaluate thé system to determine néeded upgrades.** Ih response to the 2016 recommendation, the BOP
assessed the camera systems at each institution Over the next several years.and determined that 45:0f its:
122 institutions, including MCC New York; required camera system upgrades. The BOP worked to upgrade
the systems at those 45 institutions between 2019 and 2021. In June 2021, the BOP reported that it had
updated all cameras:at the 45 institutions with the latest software and equipment, and that it. had installed
additional cameras to bolster surveillance. However, :as reported in an October 2021 Management Advisory’
Memorandum issued to'the BOP, the OIG analyzed the reported upgrades at the: 45 institutions and found
that the BOP had addressed some but not.all.of the deficiencies described in the 2016 OIG report. In its
2021 Management.Advisory Memorandum, the OIG recommended that the BOP develop a comprehensive
strategic plan for transitioning to a fully digital security camera:system. The BOP has provided the OIG with
a strategic plan that includes éstimated cost projections dnd timelines for addréssing the,
concérns and completing'the system upgrades. As of 2023, the OlG's 2021 recommendation -
remains open.

The BOP’s failure to:address the issue:of functional security camera systems'across the agency. and at,
individual institutions presents an ongoing risk to the safety of BOP staff and inmates and has the potential
to impair the investigation of and accountability for staff and inmate misconduct. It is imperative that the
BOP prioritize the expeditious expansion ‘and modernization of its security'camera system to mitigate
security risks:

Il. Recommendations

The OIG investigation identified multiple shortcomings ih BOP policies'that should be further assésséd to
ensure the BOP can more effectively handle issues that arise in connection with the custody and care of
inmates. The recommendations address issues related to.and the custody and care of inmates at risk:for

suicide; measures designed to increase safety, such as staff rounds, inmate ‘counts, and cellsearches; and
institutional security camera systems and staffing shortages, two longstanding issues for the: BOP.

1. The BOP:should implement a process for assigning a cellmate following ‘suicide watch
or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular
individual or sécurity considerations:
