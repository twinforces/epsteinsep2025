Same presentation today, but he said he thinks his memory for the incident (injury to his neck) may be impaired
because of his sleep apnea. He is supposed to get his CPAP machine today. He is aware he will be returning to SHU,
but said he is feeling unwell due to his inability to sleep and numbness in his arm. He requested to have one good night
of sleep with his CPAP and will return to SHU with a cellmate tomorrow.
I fold him he can stay down one more night to receive his CPAP and a good
night's sleep, but that he would be returned to SHU tomorrow. It was explained that there is no mental health issues
precluding him from returning to SHU tomorrow and that we could not house him in the SW/Hospital area because?”
