The email below is from one of two staff here that has been targeted by the New York Times soliciting
information on Epstein via their personal email. | will monitor this closely and | have already put out an email
to all staff on the media and who are the only approved staff that are allowed to speak to them. In addition
the Warden held a recall today expressing the concerns if staff are sharing information and how it is
prohibited. Please let me know your thoughts.
New York Times must be getting staff email addresses through social media outlets.

| hope this finds you well. My name isPOMMCY ind I'm a reporter with The New York Times. I'm
sorry to reach out out of the blue, but at NYT we are working on a story about MCC and what happened to
Jeffrey Epstein. We're trying to learn a little more about the prison and how it works internally (| hear there
have been some issues with staffing, overtime etc), and | was wondering if you might be free for a quick chat
on background (meaning that | will not use your name in any article, or anything that could identify you).
I'd just like to learn a bit more about the prison itself -- there are a lot of rumors flying around, as you know,
and we'd like to be able to speak in concrete terms about the prison from people who know it best. Please
let me know if you're free or give me a ring: 212-556-@Gia
Thanks,
