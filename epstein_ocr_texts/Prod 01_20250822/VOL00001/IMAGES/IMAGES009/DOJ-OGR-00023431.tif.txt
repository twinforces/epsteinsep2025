documentation shows the count was verbally cleared by the Control Center at 10:30 p.m. It therefore
appears that the video depicts Noel conducting a later round in the SHU, as she was required to do every
30 minutes during her shift, and not the 10 p.m. SHU count.
Noel said she wrote the 73 on the count slip but she did not remember if she or someone else had written
“+ 1" on the count slip and she did not know why “+1” was on the count slip. Noel claimed that, unlike the
4 p.m. count slip, which the Evening Watch Officer in Charge pre-filled, she did not prepare the 10 p.m.
count slip in advance of the count. Noel said she did not know that the 10 p.m. SHU count slip, which listed
73 inmates, was inaccurate, and she could not explain why the 12 a.m. count also inaccurately listed that
73 inmates were physically present in the SHU, whereas the 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. count slips accurately listed
72 inmates in the SHU.
Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that on August 9, 2019, he worked in the Control Center from
approximately 4 p.m. until 12 a.m., and then he worked as an Internal Officer from 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on
August 10. According to Senior Officer Specialist 6, he took the August 9 10 p.m. institutional count by
himself in the Control Center, and assisted with the 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts on August 10 as an
Internal Officer. Senior Officer Specialist 6 confirmed to the OIG, as MCC New York records reflect, that he
had received verbal counts from all units by 10:30 p.m., and further stated that he had cleared the
institutional count at 10:36 p.m., which was when paperwork was complete and the count was
officially complete.
Senior Officer Specialist 6 reviewed the MCC New York 10 p.m. institutional count, which showed that the
SHU had 73 inmates assigned, whereas the Receiving and Discharge Department had zero inmates assigned
to the unit. When questioned by the OIG about the 10 p.m. SHU count slip that listed “73 + 1" inmates and
was signed by the Material Handler and Noel, Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that he believed that
the “+ 1" on the count slip was in his handwriting. Senior Officer Specialist 6 also reviewed the 10 p.m.
Receiving and Discharge count slip, which listed “9S + 1” on the count slip and told the OIG that it was his
handwriting.*? Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the “9S + 1” on the SHU count slip meant that he
was “ghost counting” the inmate (Inmate 4) who had been moved from the SHU, located in the 9 South area,
to the Receiving and Discharge area earlier that day. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said that because there
were, in actuality, only 72 inmates in the SHU during the 10 p.m. count, he should have written “73 - 1" on
the SHU count slip rather than “73 + 1”.
39 According to BOP records and witness interviews, “9S” refers to the SHU, which was located in 9th Floor South section
of MCC New York.
