All,
For now | would recommend holding his funds until further instruction. Ensure this is documented and you
might want to check with Lt. [BISRAon the appropriate measures to maintain the funds. Thanks.

Good Morning,
I/M Epstein # 76318-054 appeared on our SENTRY RELEASE report. Due to the nature of the situation, | am
waiting for further instructions on how to proceed with releasing his funds. On a normal basis the process is
to forward the funds to the address located in SENTRY. The inmates account balance ($566.27) Please see the
attached P.S. 4500.12 on proper procedures for deceased inmates along with the SENTRY address on file.
