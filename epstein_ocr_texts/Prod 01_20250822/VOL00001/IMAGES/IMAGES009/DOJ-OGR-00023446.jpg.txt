following suicide watch and psychological observation, Inmate 3 asked Epstein not to kill himself while
Inmate 3 was his cellmate because Inmate 3 had a chance to go home soon. In response, Epstein told
Inmate 3 not to worry and that he was not going to cause him any trouble.
When Inmate 3 left on August 9, he told Epstein that he would leave the clothesline in the cell so that
Epstein could wash his clothes. Inmate 3 did not say anything about a noose having been in the cell, but he
said there were five blankets in their cell when he left.
C. Autopsy Results
On August 11, 2019, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on
Epstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide. One of the
office’s Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by the First Deputy
Chief Medical Examiner. In connection with this investigation, the OIG interviewed the Medical Examiner
who performed the Epstein autopsy (hereinafter the “Medical Examiner’). The Medical Examiner told the
OIG that the pattern of Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner
explained that a different fracture pattern is present if there has been a manual compression of the neck
versus a sustained pressure like in a hanging, and the pattern of Epstein’s neck fractures was that of a
hanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in
skin, on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages are caused when the blood flow is obstructed and the
small skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally identified plethora, which is purple
discoloration of the skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent with
suicide by hanging. The Medical Examiner stated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora were identified from
his neck up. In homicidal strangulations, according to the Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally
found only in the eyes and mouth, and in a different pattern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner
explained, a marked and obvious ligature furrow that peaked upward which is consistent with suicide as
opposed to a ligature strangulation.
The Medical Examiner further stated that there was no evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what
is seen in victims of strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is
invariably some signs of a struggle, even if the victim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the
autopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any marks on his hands (no broken
fingernails, no debris under the fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that would have evidenced a
fight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likely due to convulsing from hanging, no bruising on his body.
We also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,
which is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told
the OIG, hemorrhaging in the muscles in the back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you
would expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has been an incomplete compression as opposed to a
sustained compression like a hanging.
In addition, the Medical Examiner determined that the cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in
Epstein’s cell could have caused the fractures and superficial injuries the Medical Examiner identified during
the autopsy. The Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrow was too broad to have been
caused by the electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell. The Medical Examiner said blood
toxicology tests were conducted and no medications or illegal substances were identified in Epstein’s
system. The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein’s death a suicide was the Medical Examiner's
