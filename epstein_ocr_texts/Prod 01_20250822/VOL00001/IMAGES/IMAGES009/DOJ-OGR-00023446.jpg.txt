Cc. Autopsy Results
On August 11,'2019, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of New York, performed an autopsy on’
Epstein and determined that the cause of death was hanging and the manner of death a suicide. One of the
officé’s Medical Examiners performed the autopsy, and the autopsy report was reviewed by'the First Deputy
Chief Medical Examiner. In connection with this investigation, thé OG interviewed the Medical Examiner
who performed the Epstein autopsy (héreinafterthe “Medical Examiner”). Thé Médical Examiner told. the
OIG 'that the patternof Epstein’s neck bone fractures was consistent with a hanging. The Medical Examiner
explained that a.different fracture pattern is present ifitthere has been.a manual compression of the neck
versus a sustained pressure likeina hanging, and ‘the pattern ‘of Epstein's neck fractures was that of'a
hanging. The Medical Examiner also said Epstein had petechial hemorrhages, which are pinpoint bleeds in
skin, ‘on his face and mouth. These hemorrhages :are caused when the blood flow is ‘obstructed and the
small skin capillaries burst. The Medical Examiner additionally. identified plethora, which is purple’
discoloration of the:skin, and stated that both petechial hemorrhages and plethora are consistent. with
suicide by’ hanging. The Medical Examinerstated that Epstein’s petechia and plethora‘were identified from
his neck up. In homicidal'strangulations, according to the: Medical Examiner, these conditions are normally
fourid only'in the eyes and mouth, and in a different pattern. Epstein also had, the Medical Examiner
explainéd, a marked and obvious, ligature furrow that peaked upward Which is consistent with suicidé as
opposed 'to a ligattire strangulation.

The Medica! Examiner further stated that there was no:evidence of defensive wounds consistent with what
is seen in victims of'strangulation. The Medical Examiner told the OIG that in strangulation cases there is
invariably some signis of a struggle, even if thevictim is impaired. The Medical Examiner noted that the
autopsy did not identify any signs of a struggle. Epstein did not have any'marks:on his hands (no broken,
fiigernails, ho debris under the ‘fingernails, no contusions to his knuckles) that Would have evidenced a
fight, and, other than an abrasion on his arm likély:due to convulsing from: hanging, no. bruising on his, body.
We also were told by the Medical Examiner that Epstein did not have strap muscle hemorrhages of the neck,
which is bleeding in the lung muscles in the front of the neck. Nor did he have, the Medical Examiner told
the OIG; hemorrhaging in the muscles in the: back of his neck. The Medical Examiner explained that you
would expect to see that hemorrhaging when there has: been an incomplete ‘compression as opposed toa
sustained compression like a hanging.

In addition, the Medical Examiner determined thatthe cloth material of the ligature (noose) found in
Epstein's cell could have caused the fractures and Superficial injuries the Medical EXaminer identified during
the autopsy. The Medical Examiner also-told the OIG thatthe ligature furrow was too, broad to have been
caused by the electrical cord of the: medical device in Epstein's: ‘cell. The Medical Examiner said blood
toxicology tests were conducted and no medications:or illegal substances were identified in Epstein's
system. The Medical Examiner stated that the ruling of Epstein's death a’ suicide was the Medical Examiner's
