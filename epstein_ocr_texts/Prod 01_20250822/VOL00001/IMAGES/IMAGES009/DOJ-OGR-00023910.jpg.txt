hi Lee,
hope you are well. We saw an article tonight on someting called Radaronline
reporting that Jeffrey Epstein attempted to commit suicide at the MCC
(unsuccessfully.)
Are you in a position to help me on that with some sort of confirmation or
information. (Or to dispel its veracity?) thanks, Pre |
