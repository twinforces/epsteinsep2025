Good morning,
This is my second request for information concerning Jeffrey Epstein. The subject was
a registered sexual offender in Florida and is currently on our public website as Federal
Incarceration. In order for FDLE to change his status to deceased, we need some kind
of documentation from your facility confirming his death.
Thank you,
