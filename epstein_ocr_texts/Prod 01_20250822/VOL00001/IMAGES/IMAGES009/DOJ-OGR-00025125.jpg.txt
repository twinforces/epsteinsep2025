All staff members assigned to a suicide watch post are responsible for signing the post orders prior to performing the
staff suicide watch. Attached please find a copy of the NERO Waiver permitting staff monitored suicide watches in
SHU.
With regard to SHU Suicide Prevention training, this continues to be conducted on a quarterly basis. However, the
sign-in sheets for this training are now be examined by the SHU Lieutenant for accuracy. If a staff member who is
assigned to SHU misses the training, the sign-in sheet will be routed to the Captain, who will coordinate with the
Chief Psychologist and schedule a time to receive a make-up session for the SHU Suicide Prevention Training.
SHU training is conducted quarterly two weeks from the beginning of the new quarter. A representative from
Psychology will provide the required suicide prevention training. In addition, the SHU training on BOPLEARN will
be completed by all staff assigned to SHU that day of training. SHU staff will be allotted time during that day to
complete all prescribed web-based training as identified on the agenda. Staff who are assigned to SHU but have not
received the mandatory training before assuming the post will be roster-adjusted to attend another training day as
assigned by the Captain.
Staff assigned to suicide watch shall maintain a chronological log of the inmateâ€™s behavior. Blank log books will be
maintained in the Lieutenants office and on the 2" Floor. A chronological record of events will commence
immediately upon the initiation of watch, It is the responsibility of the staff member initiating the watch to obtain a
blank log book prior to initiating the watch. Different log books will be used for each inmate on suicide watch; each
log book will contain entries for one suicide watch only. The name and register number of the inmate on watch shall
be clearly printed on the front cover of the log book and at the top of each page in the log book in which entries are
made.
During some suicide watches, staff observers may cover some shifts and inmate companions may cover others. In
this instance, two separate log books must be used: one for the shifts during which staff are maintaining constant
visual observation (blue) and another for shifts during which inmate companions are providing constant visual
observation (yellow). When separate inmate companion log books are used, staff must sign the inmate companion
log book every 60 minutes.
Lights will remain on inside the cell 24 hours day to ensure the inmate on watch can be seen. A Lieutenant will
make rounds every shift and remove the inmate from the cell and perform a cursory search. No food items, trays,
eating utensils, milk cartons, toilet paper, plastic bags, reading materials, pens, pencils, or anything else not
prescribed by Psychology staff should be in the cell.
The inmate will be outfitted in a suicide preventive smock, suicide preventive blanket, suicide preventive mattress.
and if necessary a suicide preventive helmet. Inmate Companions will be searched prior to assuming duties. Inmate
Companions are not allowed to have radios, mp3 players, magazines, books or anything that would distract them
from maintaining constant supervision. Inmate Companions will not have direct or physical contact with inmates on
suicide watch.
12. Staffing: The Drug Abuse Program Coordinator positon at MCC New York was abolished during Phase I of the
staff realignment during fiscal year 2018. Re-establishing
the Drug Abuse Program Coordinator position would provide the institution with an additional supervisory
psychologist to provide critical clinical services.
Staffing in the Correctional Services department is relevant to the reconstruction. However, the details about this
topic are provided in an After Action Review completed separately from this report.
