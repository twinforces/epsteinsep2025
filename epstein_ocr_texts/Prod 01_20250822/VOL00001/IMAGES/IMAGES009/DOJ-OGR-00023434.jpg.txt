Thomas acknowledged that neither he nor Noel conducted any rounds or counts in the SHU during their
shift between approximately 12 a.m. and approximately 6:30 a.m. Thomas said the August 10, 2019 round
sheets were signed, but the rounds were not conducted because he was tired that day. Thomas recalled
“dozing off from here and there” during his shift, but he did not know if Noel slept.
Thomas did not recall having a conversation with anyone concerning the discrepancy between the 12 a.m.
SHU count slip, which listed 73 inmates, and the institutional count, which listed 72 inmates in the SHU.
Thomas said he had filled out and signed the 3 a.m. SHU count slip, which listed 72 inmates in the SHU.
Thomas did not know why the number of inmates was different on the 12 a.m. and 3 a.m. count slips and
did not recall speaking with the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant about the 12 a.m. count. Thomas
told the OIG that he knew he was falsely certifying the count slips when he signed them on August 10, 2019.
B. Staff Rounds in the SHU
1. CO Rounds
As detailed in the BOP Policies section of Chapter 2, in addition to inmate counts, BOP policy and MCC
New York SHU Post Orders required that COs assigned to the SHU conduct rounds to observe all inmates at
least twice an hour. As part of their assigned duties, MCC New York SHU officers had to walk each of the
tiers of the SHU twice an hour on an irregular schedule, once during the first 30 minutes and again during
the second 30 minutes, with both rounds occurring no more than 40 minutes apart. COs working in the
SHU were required to complete and initial an official MCC New York form, often referred to as a “round
sheet,” which was reviewed and signed by a supervisor, documenting the date and time of each 30-minute
round in each tier of the SHU.*°
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that SHU staff spoke about conducting rounds on Epstein
every day. He said that the Warden, Lieutenants, and other MCC New York staff members frequently told
the SHU staff to conduct rounds and to keep an eye on Epstein. To reinforce this message, the Day Watch
SHU Officer in Charge created a sign on orange paper that he hung on a computer in the SHU officer's area
that said, “MANADATORY [sic] ROUNDS MUST BE CONDUCTED EVERY 30 MINUTES ON EPSTEIN # 76318-054
AS PER GOD!!!” The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said the sign was hanging on the computer on
August 9 and 10, 2019, and it was clearly visible to everyone who worked in the SHU. The Acting Evening
Watch Activities Lieutenant confirmed that written instructions to conduct rounds on Epstein were posted
on the SHU computer.
4 This BOP form is officially entitled “MCC New York, Special Housing Unit, 30 Minute Check Sheet.”
