individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody. Upon removal from

suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care recommendations are made

by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP thoroughly evaluates each

celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at moderate to high risk

for suicide.
OIG Analysis: The BOPâ€™s response is not fully responsive to this recommendation. Recommendation 1
focuses on the process for assigning a cellmate following suicide watch and psychological observation.
Recommendation 2, on the other hand, focuses on procedures to ensure that inmates at high risk for
suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended continue to have a cellmate until the recommendation is
changed or rescinded. Our investigation and review determined that BOP employees did not take steps to
ensure that Jeffrey Epstein continuously had a cellmate in response to Psychology Department personnel
having determined that he needed to have an appropriate cellmate, and absent any indication that security
or other considerations relating to Epstein warranted his not having a cellmate.
The OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) develops the recommended
procedures; (2) provides the procedures to the OIG; and (3) implements the procedures.
Recommendation 3: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and documenting
approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation,
which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, and provide guidance on standard
components that each institution should include in its process to mitigate security issues that can
arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological observation.
Status: Resolved.
BOP Response: The BOP reported the following:

The BOP concurs with this recommendation.
OIG Analysis: The BOP concurred with this recommendation but did not provide any additional
information. The OIG will consider whether to close this recommendation after the BOP (1) evaluates the
current process for obtaining and documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on
suicide watch or psychological observation; (2) provides guidance on standard components that each
institution should include it is process; and (3) provides to the OIG documentation of the evaluation and the
guidance forwarded to institutions for inclusion in their institution-specific processes.
Recommendation 4: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate whereabouts
and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods through policy,
training, or other measures.
Status: Resolved.
BOP Response: The BOP reported the following:
