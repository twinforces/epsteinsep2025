August 10, 2019, after Noel called the medical emergency, the Correctional Systems Officer received a call
from staffiin the SHU instructing her to.call 911 for an ambulance. The Correctional Systems Officer notified
the New York Police Department;(NYPD) via the MCG New York institutional NYPD telephone. The
Correctional Systems Officer then informed NYPD that MCC New York needed an ambulance ‘and medical
assistance for one of the inmates, The New York City Fire Department and EMS arrived at MCC New York'at
6:43 a.m. and were éscorted to the second-floor médical area. EMS departed MCC New York with Epstein
and a BOP escort Via ambulance and chase car to the local hospital at’7:10.a.m.

The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, told the OIG that, she was relieved as the Operations Lieutenant
prior to.6 a.m. on August, 10, 2019, but:was still working on things like the Daily.Activity Reports and
Lieutenant Logs that she did not.get'to finish during her shift. At.some point, the Morning Watch
Operations Lieutenant heard ‘that there was a medical emergency in SHU,.so she‘went to assist because: she:
knew that inmates would need to be given food,and other things would ‘heed to bé done. The Morning
Watch Operations Lieutenant'estimated that she went‘to the SHU around 7.a.m. to help with the inmate
meals, anid believed 'the Electronics Technician 'was also helping out. Noél was'there, but shé was, not
helping with delivering food to the inmates. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that after the
meals: were delivered, she finished up. and went home.

All MCC: New York staff members who were interviewed by the OIG said they did not know of.any
information suggesting that Epstein's cause of death was something other'than suicide. Additionally, no
inmate provided the OIG with information suggésting'that. anyone. assisted Epstéin with taking his own life
or had any credible information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death was something otherthan suicide.
Some MCC New York staff'tald the OIG that Epstein’s death could have been prevented if, among other
things, Epstein had been assigned a new:cellmate after Inmate 3's departure and rounds and counts had
been conducted in the SHU as required. Some witnesses:also faulted MCC New York staffing shortages,
which resulted in excessive overtime and meant that MCC New York staff members.were often overtired
during their shifts. Other MCC New York: staff members told the OIG that even if inmate safety and
accountability. measures had, been property. executed, an inmate who wanted, to take his life would have
found a way todo so.
