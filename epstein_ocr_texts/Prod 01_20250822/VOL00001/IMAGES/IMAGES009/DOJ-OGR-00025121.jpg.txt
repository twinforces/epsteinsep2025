(verbally) to Psychology Staff or the on-call psychologist. Please ensure to maintain constant visual observation of
the inmate until formal steps can be taken to ensure his/her safety pending a formal assessment by a Psychologist.”
The Psychology Department uses PSY ALERT codes more frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with
a history or charge of a sex offense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately on classification and/or
identification, and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution. If an inmate is moved in and out of our
institution for court, etc., the inmate is assessed immediately prior to being released to a unit.
R&D staff have been reminded of the U.S. Marshal and Court alert notices. Psychology Staff are notified
immediately if there are suicidal concerns noted by the Courts. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an
inmate that enters the institution with an alert notice is placed on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and
Warden are notified. These inmates receive a suicide risk assessment by a psychologist before being released to the
general population.
Inmates who initially enter and/or transfer into the institution with a PSY ALERT assignment will be seen by a
member of the Psychology Services Department immediately and prior to being released to the general
population. R&D will review the PP44 code and Intake Screeners will utilize the PP64 to determine if inmates
entering the facility have a PSY ALERT assignment. If there is not a psychologist in the building when a PSY
ALERT inmate is identified and/or if it is during non-duty hours, the Operations Lieutenant will immediately be
notified and will then contact the on-call psychologist. The on-call psychologist will come in after hours to
screen the inmate in R&D and determine their appropriateness for general population, as well as any other
pertinent housing considerations, prior to the inmate’s release to general population.
Inmates may also be assigned a PSY ALERT function code by a psychologist while housed at this institution.
Psychologists will consider not only inmates with substantial mental health concerns for a PSY ALERT assignment,
but will use PSY ALERT codes frequently with high profile cases and with inmates with a history or charge of a sex
offense. The PSY ALERT code is applied immediately and not just when an inmate is about to leave the institution.
The attached institutional procedural memorandum has been reviewed by Central Office Psychology Services and
implemented by MCC New York Psychology Services to outline the follow-up procedures when existing PSY
ALERT inmates return from trips such as court proceedings and hospital trips. If any movement occurs with an
existing PSY ALERT inmate, psychology must be verbally notified immediately when the inmate returns back to the
institution. This would include movement from court, institutional movement, or hospital trips. The Psychology
Department will also be notified of a PSY ALERT inmate’s movement prior to the inmate leaving. The Psychology
Department will be provided with the court lists as well as the Prisoner Schedule Report on a daily basis. These
reports will be reviewed daily by a member of the psychology department to assess whether a PSY ALERT inmate is
scheduled to go out to court the following day.
When an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department
returns from court with a notice from the Judge or Marshal’s Office indicating imminent mental health concerns or
concerns related to suicidality, the PSY ALERT inmate will be seen by a psychologist immediately and prior to their
return to general population. A psychologist will determine at that time ifa PSY ALERT inmate is ready to return to
general population, their psychological stability, and their treatment needs. If the inmate returns after hours and there
is no psychologist in the institution, the PSY ALERT inmate will be placed on suicide watch pending a suicide risk
assessment by a psychologist. The Operations Lieutenant, On-Call Psychologist and Warden will be notified.
