other MCC New York employees who the OIG found created false documentation on earlier
dates and times not proximate to the Epstein’s death.

o MCC New York Staff Failed to Ensure that the Institution's Security Camera System was Fully
Functional Resulting in Limited Recorded Video Evidence. BOP policy also requires SHU staff to
ensure the functionality of the video camera surveillance system. This investigation and review
revealed longstanding deficiencies with MCC New York's security camera system. Although
video cameras in the SHU provided live video feeds to monitoring stations, system deficiencies
resulted in nearly all of the cameras in and around the SHU where Epstein was being housed to
not record video starting in late July 2019 and continuing through the date of Epstein’s death.

e Long-standing Operational Challenges. The DOJ OIG has repeatedly identified long-standing
operational challenges that negatively affect the BOP’s ability to operate its institutions safely and
securely. Many of those same operational challenges, including staffing shortages, managing
inmates at risk for suicide, maintaining functional security camera systems, management failures,
and widespread disregard of BOP policies and procedures, were again identified by the OIG during
this investigation and review of the custody, care, and supervision of Epstein, one of the BOP’s most
high profile inmates.

e No Evidence Contradicting the FBI's Determination that there Was No Criminality Associated with
Epstein’s Death. Separate from the OIG's investigation, which focused on the conduct of BOP
personnel, the FBI concurrently investigated whether Epstein’s death was the result of criminal
conduct by any non-BOP actors. Among other things, the FBI investigated the cause of Epstein’s
death and determined it was not the result of a criminal act. The Office of the Chief Medical
Examiner, City of New York, determined that Epstein died by suicide. While the OIG determined
MCC New York staff engaged in significant misconduct and dereliction of their duties, we did not
uncover evidence contradicting the FBI's determination regarding the absence of criminality in
connection with Epstein’s death.

The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures documented in the
report all contributed to an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP’s
custody was provided with the opportunity to take his own life. The BOP’s failures are troubling not only
because the BOP did not adequately safeguard an individual in its custody, but also because they led to
questions about the circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death and effectively deprived Epstein’s numerous
victims of the opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice process. The fact that these failures
have been recurring ones at the BOP does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for
DO] and BOP leadership to address the chronic problems plaguing the BOP.
The DO] OIG made eight recommendations to improve the BOP’s management of its correctional
institutions. The BOP agreed with all recommendations.
