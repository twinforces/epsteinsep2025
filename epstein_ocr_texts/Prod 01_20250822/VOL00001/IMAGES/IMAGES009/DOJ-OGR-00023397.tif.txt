The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant documented in a BOP report that when she returned to the
Health Services Unit, Senior Officer Specialist 4 informed her that Epstein had said that his cellmate had
tried to kill Epstein and had been harassing him. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant then spoke
with the cellmate (Inmate 1), who said he was wearing headphones and was asleep when he felt something
hit his legs. Inmate 1 said he called out to Epstein and when Epstein did not answer, he got up, turned on
the light, and saw Epstein sitting on the floor, leaning to the side with a string around his neck. Inmate 1
told the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that he then called the guards. Inmate 1 provided a similar
statement to BOP officials at approximately 2:50 p.m. on July 23, 2019.
The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant’s report notes that she also spoke with Epstein, who told her that
he had returned to his cell after an attorney visit at approximately 8 p.m. the previous day, at which time his
cellmate was reading the Daily News newspaper. Epstein’s said his cellmate turned to a page of the
newspaper that had Epstein’s picture and reported that Epstein was worth $77 million. Epstein told the
Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant that he looked at his picture, balled it up, and threw it in the garbage.
Epstein further stated that he woke up at approximately 1 a.m. to get a drink of water, returned to his bunk,
and the next thing he remembered was that he was snoring and MCC New York staff were inside his cell.
When asked about the allegations against his cellmate, Epstein said he had been told that if his cellmate
hurt him, MCC New York staff would not care.
Inmate 2, who was housed in the same SHU tier as Epstein on July 23, told the FBI about an incident that
occurred in the SHU around 1:20 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. on an unspecified date. Inmate 2 said he was reading a
book when he heard an inmate scream and bang on the cell door to get the SHU officers’ attention.
Inmate 2 said he could only see the cell door and not inside. According to Inmate 2, Senior Officer
Specialist 2 responded to the cell and then left and returned with additional officers. The FBI was further
told by Inmate 2 that the officers opened the cell door, removed an inmate, placed the inmate in handcuffs,
and put the inmate in the shower area. Inmate 2 stated that the officers reentered the cell and Inmate 2
heard a thump as if something had hit the floor. The officers then pulled the other inmate out of the cell,
placed him ona stretcher, and took him away. Inmate 2 also told the FBI that, later in the evening, around
2:10 a.m. to 2:15 a.m., the COs returned to the cell where the incident had occurred earlier. He said he
further observed the officers clean out the cell and use a video camera to record the inside of the cell.
Inmate 2 said he saw the officers remove from the cell orange clothing items that had been tied together.
Inmate 2 also said that the first inmate to be removed from the cell later told Inmate 2 that he was sleeping
when his cellmate had tried to kill himself by hanging himself from the ladder of the bed.
According to BOP records, medical staff evaluated Epstein at approximately 6:20 a.m. on July 23, 2019, and
observed friction marks and superficial reddening of his neck and one knee. The red mark spanned two-
thirds of Epstein’s neck (front and sides) and was 2 inches wide. Epstein told the medical staff that he did
not know what had caused his injuries, and that he went to drink a little water and woke up snoring.
Later that morning, the MCC New York Staff Psychologist conducted a suicide risk assessment and
determined that Epstein should remain on suicide watch. During the assessment, Epstein denied any
knowledge of how he sustained the marks on his neck. The Staff Psychologist noted in the assessment
report that it was unclear whether Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if someone else did.
Medical staff examined Epstein at approximately 1:08 p.m. the following day, July 24, 2019, and observed
that the central part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion. According to BOP records,
Epstein told the medical staff that he still did not want to talk about how he sustained his injuries, but he
