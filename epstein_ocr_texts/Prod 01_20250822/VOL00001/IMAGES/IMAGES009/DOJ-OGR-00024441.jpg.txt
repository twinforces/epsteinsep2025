Good afternoon! We understand two employees of the Metropolitan Correctional Center in
Manhattan are about to be charged re: lapses the night of Jeffrey Epstein’s death.
Are you representing either of them in the criminal matter? If not, who is? We’d like to reach out of
fairness and to ensure we are separating fact from rumors.
Any guidance/point in the right direction would be most appreciated.
