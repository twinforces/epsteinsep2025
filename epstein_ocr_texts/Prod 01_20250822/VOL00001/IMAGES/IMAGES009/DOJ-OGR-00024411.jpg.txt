Hello, I’m working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges against, _|

POmme ve spoken to an AFGE union official EE -fnse attorney. The
story will run over the weekend so I’d appreciate a response by COB today.
The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification of
documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note that the
facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people | spoke to, there has not been a hiring
surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein’s suicide.
Has any money been allocated for improving MCC as a facility since Epstein’s death?
Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein’s suicide?
Any changes in BOP policies following Epstein’s suicide?
Is it correct that Noel and Thomas were responsible for roughly 50 to 70 inmates the night of the
suicide?
What is the attrition rate for BOP correctional officers? What's the average length of time a person stays
in the job? (NYC-area would be best if it’s available.)
Can you share anything supervisors at MCC have told the rank and file in the wake of these charges?
What's the message to overworked, disgruntled correctional officers?
Thank you,
Manhattan Federal Court reporter
