count. Senior Officer Specialist 6 explained that the action he took was known as “ghost counting,”
something he said he would not have done without authorization from the Operations Lieutenant or
someone of a higher rank than himself. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant denied having
authorized a “ghost count” and we found no evidence to corroborate Senior Officer Specialist 6’s claim that
the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant knew of and approved the false count.
The OIG found that Senior Officer Specialist 6 modified the count slips received from the SHU and Receiving
and Discharge, failed to request a recount of the SHU inmates, and cleared the 10 p.m. institutional count
knowing that it was inaccurate in violation of BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders.
5. Failure to Adequately Supervise SHU Staff and Conduct Lieutenant Rounds
The OIG also found that MCC New York supervisory personnel failed to effectively perform their duties,
which contributed to the fact that Epstein was unobserved for many hours before his death. As discussed
above, federal regulations require that MCC New York supervisory personnel “put forth honest effort in the
performance of their duties,” which includes appropriate supervision of SHU personnel.®’ Additionally, BOP
policy requires that a Lieutenant visit the SHU during each shift to ensure that all procedures are
being followed.®
The OIG's investigation revealed that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Morning Watch
Operations Lieutenant had oversight of the SHU during their respective shifts.°? The Evening Watch
Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that on August 9, 2019, he did not supervise the 4 p.m. count or conduct
any rounds in the SHU. He acknowledged that he signed some of the pages of the 4 p.m. count, but he did
not sign all of the pages as he should have. Beginning at 10 p.m. on August 9, the Morning Watch
Operations Lieutenant was the sole supervisor overseeing the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations
Lieutenant told the OIG that she noticed an error in the 12 a.m. count on August 10, which was due to SHU
staff including Inmate 4, who had been internally transferred to Receiving and Discharge, among the
inmates in the SHU. According to the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant, the SHU staff should have
conducted another count and submitted a new count slip, but she did not know if they actually did so.
During her shift, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant conducted one round in the SHU at
approximately 4 a.m. on August 10. The OIG's review of the available SHU security camera video revealed
that the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant was present in the SHU for approximately 7 minutes, during
which time she conferred with Noel and Thomas, who were seated at and around the SHU Officers’ Station
in the common area of the SHU. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she was not
required to visit each tier or go to each individual cell during a lieutenant round, but rather the purpose of
the Lieutenant round was for her to speak with the officers on duty. This description of a Lieutenant round

83 The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant also had oversight over the SHU during her overtime shift (4 p.m. to
10 p.m. on August 9, 2019) in an acting capacity. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Acting Evening
Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant did not supervise any
institutional counts, which was due to the start and end time of her overtime shift. The Acting Evening Watch Activities
Lieutenant also told the OIG that she conducted one round in the SHU sometime between 5 p.m. to 8 p.m., during which
time she walked down all of the tiers.
