Hey guys,
| received a phone call from {EXPN who claims to be Jeffrey Epstein's brother. He was asking the
status of Mr. Epstein's property and if or when it would be released to him. | explained to him that normally
we mail it to the last know address on record. He left his number just in case anyone wanted to reach out.
