Chapter 1: Introduction
The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is a component of the Department of Justice (DOJ) that operates
122 institutions across the United States. According to its website, the BOP’s current mission statement is
“Corrections professionals who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by
preparing individuals for successful reentry into our communities.” However, the DO] Office of the
Inspector General (OIG) has issued numerous reports over more than a decade identifying long-standing
operational challenges facing the BOP that have negatively affected its ability to operate its institutions
safely and securely. Those reports have contained dozens of recommendations to the BOP. As we detail in
this report, many of those same operational challenges and systemic issues, including significant staffing
shortages, providing appropriate custody and care of inmates at risk for suicide, the absence of functional
security camera systems, and management failures and widespread disregard of BOP policies and
procedures, were once again identified by the OIG during the course of this investigation and review into
the custody, care, and supervision of one of the BOP’s most notorious inmates, Jeffrey Epstein. We
therefore make further recommendations to the BOP in the conclusion of this report to help it address
these recurring issues.
The OIG initiated this investigation upon the receipt of information from the BOP that on the morning of
August 10, 2019, in the Metropolitan Correctional Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York),
inmate Jeffery Epstein was found hanged in his assigned cell within the Special Housing Unit (SHU). The SHU
is a housing unit where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate population and kept locked
in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their own safety as well as the safety of staff and
other inmates. Epstein had been placed in the SHU on July 7, 2019, the day after his arrest, due to the
significant media coverage of his case and awareness of his notoriety among MCC New York inmates.
According to information obtained by the OIG during the investigation, at approximately 8 p.m. on August 9,
all SHU inmates, including Epstein, were locked in their cells for the evening. Additionally, the six separate
tiers or groups of cells within the SHU were also securely locked. At approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10,
2019, SHU staff unlocked the door to the SHU tier in which Epstein’s cell was located in order to deliver
breakfast to inmates through the food slots in the locked cell doors. When SHU staff entered the tier to
deliver breakfast to Epstein, SHU staff knocked on the locked door to Epstein’s cell. Epstein, who was
housed alone in the cell, did not respond to SHU staff. SHU staff unlocked the cell door and found Epstein
hanged in his cell, with one end of a piece of orange cloth around his neck and the other end tied to the top
portion of a bunkbed in Epstein’s cell. Epstein was suspended from the top bunk in a near-seated position
with his buttocks approximately 1 inch to 1 inch and a half off the floor and his legs extended straight out on
the floor in front of him. Epstein’s cell contained an excess amount of prison linens, as well as multiple
nooses that had been made from torn prison linens.
SHU staff immediately activated a body alarm, which notified all MCC New York staff of a medical emergency
and prompted MCC New York staff assigned to the Control Center to call for 911 emergency services. SHU
staff then ripped the orange cloth away from the bunkbed, which caused Epstein’s buttocks to drop to the
ground. SHU staff laid Epstein on the ground and immediately initiated cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR). At approximately 6:33 a.m., other MCC New York employees responded to the SHU. A responding
MCC New York Lieutenant took over administering CPR and asked SHU staff to retrieve an automated
external defibrillator and call for the duty nurse. A Clinical Nurse responded and continued to perform CPR
on Epstein in the place of the Lieutenant. At approximately 6:39 a.m., Epstein was placed on a stretcher and
