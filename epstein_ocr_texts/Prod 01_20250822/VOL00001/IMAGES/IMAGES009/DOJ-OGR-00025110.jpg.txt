5. Telephone Calls
As noted in the response, there is a lack of documentation to substantiate that a lieutenant facilitated two
telephone calls to Mr. Epstein. However, this does not address the report of two telephone calls being provided.
This response implies that the reporting of two staff members is inaccurate.
The response neglects the documented telephone call to Mr. Epstein's deceased mother.
Institution Response:
On August 29, 2019, Warden J. Petrucci, signed a referral related tof failure to follow policy in
allowing Epstein to complete an unmonitored phone call. The referral was submitted to the Office of Internal
Affairs on that same date and is pending further action at this time.
7. Follow-Up
Please provide documentation for the follow-up training provided to staff detailing the content of the training
and to whom it was provided.
Institution Response:
As recommended by Central Office, the Chief Psychologist has conducted suicide prevention trainings during
Department Head Meetings, e-mail correspondence, SHU Staff Trainings, and Lieutenantâ€™s Trainings. The
follow-up training sign-in sheets, Department Head Meeting Minutes, and e-mails provided by psychology staff
regarding PSY ALERT Inmates are attached for your review.
8. Inmate Accountability and Assignment Accuracy
Periodic and unannounced checks are now conducted in SHU to determine pp30 assignments and actual inmate
placement match. Please provide an operational definition of periodic. Please do the same for routine, as it
relates Executive Staff bed book counts in all units. Where will the periodic and routine reviews be documented
and will they include the identity (e.g., name and title) of staff who complete them?
Institution Response:
An Executive Staff and Duty Officer schedule has been implemented to conduct daily 4 P.M. and 10 A.M.
weekend bed book counts. Any discrepancies noted are documented and sent via email to Unit Mangers and
Captain at the conclusion of each count for corrective action. Please see the attached schedule.
9. Attorney Log Books
Please provide a copy of the log book audit.
Institution Response:
The audit revealed the Random Visitor Log Book did not reflect visitor pat searches after May 19, 2019. In
addition, the log book does not offer a column to annotate a staff witness. The Contractor/Volunteer Log
Book was not always filled in properly. The Law Enforcement Log Book was up to date; however, the time of
departure was not always documented. The Attorney Log was missing inmate register numbers and more often
than not was legible. There was no Visitor Denial Log created. The audit conducted on September 25, 2019, is
attached for your review.
