Thank you for letting me know and for your response.
I was informed bY hat he had submitted my completed application to the legal
department for the inmate Jeffrey Epstein yesterday morning. Does this reflect any of your
records? If not, I will be happy to resubmit. If so, can I send the application to you directly via
email? Please let me know.
