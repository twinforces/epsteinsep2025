With apologies for the delay, medical staff can accept his CPAP machine. Would you or one of your
associates be able to bring it in next week? It must be provided to medical staff rather than directly to your
client.
Thank you,

Mr
Is Mr. Epstein approved to receive a CPAP machine? If so, should we
send it directly to him through the inmate mail system? Please confirm.
Thank you.
