then returned to the SHU and worked there for approximately 1 hour, along with the Morning Watch
Operations Lieutenant and Noel. The Electronics Technician believed he was in the SHU prior to 7 a.m. and
until approximately 8 a.m., but he was not positive with regard to the times. The Electronics Technician said
he delivered food to the inmates on one tier while the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant did the same
on another tier while Noel unlocked the doors outside of the tiers for the Electronics Technician and the
Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant. The Electronics Technician said that when they were delivering food
to the inmates, he heard the inmates saying, “You killed him. You weren't making rounds. You killed him.”
The Electronics Technician told the OIG that the inmates also said Thomas and Noel just sat at the SHU
Officers’ Station and never checked on the inmates. The Electronics Technician told the OIG he understood
the inmates to be saying that Thomas and Noel were responsible for Epstein’s death because they had not
conducted rounds during their shift. The Electronics Technician said he believed that Epstein took his own
life and said he had no reason to believe otherwise.
Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he responded to the emergency call at 6:33 a.m. and when he arrived, staff
members were already performing CPR on Epstein. Senior Officer Specialist 6 said he assisted with
transporting Epstein to the Health Services Unit, taking Epstein to the ambulance, and then followed the
ambulance to the hospital in another vehicle, and stayed at the hospital until he was relieved from duty.
The OIG also reviewed photographs that were taken in the MCC New York Health Services Unit of EMTs
attempting to resuscitate Epstein. The photographs show, among other things, Epstein on his back with an
intravenous line in his arm, his orange BOP-issued shirt ripped open and laying around his arms, and him
wearing orange BOP-issued boxer shorts. None of the photographs taken at MCC New York show Epstein in
a hospital gown, although the OIG did review photographs taken at New York Presbyterian Lower
Manhattan Hospital which show Epstein in a hospital gown.
Additionally, the OIG participated in interviews of three inmates assigned to the same SHU tier as Epstein at
the time of his death and who were housed in cells opposite Epstein’s cell and therefore had a direct line of
sight to Epstein’s cell.4* One such inmate was Inmate 5, who was assigned to a cell directly across from
Epstein’s cell on the left side of the tier and who told the OIG that he could see all the cells on the right side
of L Tier, where Epstein was housed. Inmate 5 believed a count was last conducted within the SHU on
August 9, 2019, a little before 12 a.m., and said that no additional count was conducted after that time.
Inmate 5 did not see anyone, or hear anyone, go into Epstein’s cell on the night of August 9 or the morning
of August 10 prior to a male CO discovering Epstein on the morning of August 10. Inmate 5 said the male
CO knocked on Epstein’s assigned cell, looked in, and then opened the door. Inmate 5 could only see
Epstein’s legs from the knee down but could tell that Epstein was laying down on his back because his feet
were pointed upward. The male CO bent down to shake Epstein and was saying, “Epstein, Epstein.” The
male CO then tried to pick up Epstein from behind, with his arms wrapped around Epstein. Inmate 5 said
both the officer and Epstein fell back to the floor, with Epstein falling to the side of the officer. Inmate 5 said
that once the two fell, he could then see that it was Epstein. The CO then started giving Epstein chest
compressions and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. At this point, the officer said, “Fuck!” and asked the
female CO, who was standing near the L Tier gate, if she has pressed the button. The female officer said,
“Yeah, a long time ago.” A Lieutenant then arrived at Epstein’s cell along with a male nurse who tried to
#8 As noted previously, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York sought interviews from all of the
inmates housed in the L Tier of the SHU on the night that Epstein died.
