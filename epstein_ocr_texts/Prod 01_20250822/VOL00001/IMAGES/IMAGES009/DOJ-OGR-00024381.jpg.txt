This is a heads up that our public affairs office, IPPA leadership, and the Director's office drafted a statement
for all Epstein inquiries today that DOJ's public affairs folks are now reviewing. USMS will also see it because
they are getting media inquiries and called me. And DOJ's Legislative Affairs team as well as BOP's legislative
affairs folks are getting Congressional interest (Members' offices saying we should take better care of him,
etc).
The final response to media that will be approved by DOJ should be given to me within the hour and | will
send it out to more than 30 reporters who've emailed me. I'll give the response to who can give it to
media who've contacted him in Lee's absence (Lee also has been in touch with me to be sure | have all |
need).
I'll send you all the final approved response from DOJ when | get it.
