Institution Response: 3. Cellmate Assignments:
Inmates with serious mental illness and those at-risk for suicidality are discussed during staff meetings, department
head meetings, SHU meetings, morning meetings, and close out meetings. The Captain, Associate Wardens,
Warden and Psychology Services discuss the inmate’s needs. The Legal Department also assists when the inmate’s
attorney or court are concerned about an inmate’s mental health. Psychology Services are involved in making
recommendations regarding the types of cellmates with whom inmates at-risk for suicidality should celled.
Psychology Services takes into consideration the suicide risk factors involved with a particular inmate and shares
their knowledge with Executive Staff.
The psychological reconstruction team suggests MCC New York Executive Staff did not take into account Mr.
Epstein’s sex offender-specific needs in assigning him a cellmate in SHU. However, that is not correct. MCC New
York Executive Staff considered a variety of factors in determining the most appropriate cellmate for Mr. Epstein,
including but not limited to history of sex offenses, nature of the inmate, cooperation status, etc.
Prior to Mr. Epstein being taken off suicide watch, MCC New York Executive Staff, with input from Psychology
staff, assessed all the inmates in SHU at that time and narrowed the list down to the most appropriate candidates.
the other inmates in SHU at the time were there for disciplinary reasons and were otherwise not appropriate to be
housed with Mr. Epstein. The other notable inmate in SHU with a history of sex offenses? "© ]was deemed
dangerous to Mr. Epstein due to his threatening nature. Accordingly, MCC New York Executive Staff narrowed the
possibilities to cooperators. Specifically, Efrain Reyes, Register Number 85993-054, was placed in SHU for claims
he was being threatened and extorted on his unit, and he was confirmed as proffering with the U.S. Attorney’s
Office. As both he and Mr. Epstein were in SHU for safety reasons, Mr. Reyes was deemed an appropriate cellmate.
Based on the above, consideration was made for Mr. Epstein’s sex-offender-specific needs in choosing his cellmate
in SHU. His charged crime was just one of the factors reviewed in making the determination. MCC New York
Executive Staff also considered high publicity inmates with ample reasons not to hurt Mr. Epstein, and cooperators
who are not only vulnerable themselves, but also had a lot to lose should they harm Mr. Epstein.
