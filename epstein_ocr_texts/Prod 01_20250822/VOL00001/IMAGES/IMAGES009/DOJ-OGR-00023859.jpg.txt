If you need something for Program Review, I'm happy to write a memo explaining why your office hasn't
done anything with the funds yet. Do you think that would be sufficient?

It is ona daily report that we run and with program review approaching, the review team may ask why this
inmate hasn't been cleared off of the report. In light of the circumstance, | just wanted clarification on what
should be done because of what is being put out in the media.

Hi All,

(BOM asked me last week to reach out to his attorneys to find out what they wanted us to do with the funds. |
explained to defense counsel that our normal practice was to cut a check to the next-of-kin that we have on-
file. However, given the circumstances and the discussion of Epstein's will in the media, | told defense
counsel we wanted to make sure we didn't need to do anything differently here. Defense counsel told me
they would get back to me. | haven't heard from them yet. Is there a deadline by which we need to release
the funds?

Thanks,
