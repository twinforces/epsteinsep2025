thé search was not of Epstein’s cell.4® BOP records

The Day. Watch SHU Officer in Charge: told 'the OIG ‘that:
at least five cell searches should be conducted on the:
day and night,watch'shifts within the SHU, and that
cell searches are conducted in cells:every time the:
inmate departs the:cell. He said the SHU Officer in Charge was réesporisible for making:sure the searches
Were conducted and logged into the BOP TRUSCOPE databasé. The Day’ Watch SHU Officer in Charge said
that only one cell search was entered into TRUSCOPE on August 9, 2019, because cell searches were tedious
to enter, and he was busy. He did not believe that it was'a problem that only one cell search was logged on
August 9 because he said the SHU staff would have gone into.every cell when the inmates took their
showers. He:said that during the period of Epstein’s custody, SHU. inmates showered on Mondays,.
Wednesdays, and Fridays. The Day'Watch SHU Officer in Charge: said that ‘during showers, SHU'staff
searched-every. cell. He explained that-all of the SHU cells should have been searched on Friday, August 9
because it was a shower day. He said SHU staff'should also conduct cell searches when inmates go to'the
recreation area or for.attorney visits. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, Epstein’s cell
should have: been ‘searched because both Epstein.and Inmate 3: left the cell on the: morning of August 9. He
further stated that he believed that'the majority of-cells in the SHU were séarched although, as noted above,
the SHU staff logged only one cell search ins TRUSCOPE on August 9 and the search was not of Epstein’s cell.
