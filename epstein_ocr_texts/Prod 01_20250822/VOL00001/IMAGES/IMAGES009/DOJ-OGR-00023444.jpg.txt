shown a picture of Epstein’s cell, Noel verified that it

a Tee z 3 Tai ¥ "the mattress on the floor was Epstein’s, as he always
a Xo -__ slept on the mattress on the floor. As detailed in the
, 7 BOP policies section of Chapter 2, MCC New York
s SHU Post Orders required that COs assigned to the
} ‘ he SHU during the daytime tours of duty conduct at
, least five cell searches each day, and that the entire

searched every week. The OIG investigation
revealed, however, that on August 9, 2019, the SHU

io ta a Fai the search was not of Epstein’s cell.42 BOP records
teas Nees, did not indicate when Epstein’s cell was last searched.
Source: Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, City of The Pay Watep BHU Officer InsChmtge told tHe Ol that
New¥ark at least five cell searches should be conducted on the
day and night watch shifts within the SHU, and that
cell searches are conducted in cells every time the
inmate departs the cell. He said the SHU Officer in Charge was responsible for making sure the searches
were conducted and logged into the BOP TRUSCOPE database. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said
that only one cell search was entered into TRUSCOPE on August 9, 2019, because cell searches were tedious
to enter, and he was busy. He did not believe that it was a problem that only one cell search was logged on
August 9 because he said the SHU staff would have gone into every cell when the inmates took their
showers. He said that during the period of Epstein’s custody, SHU inmates showered on Mondays,
Wednesdays, and Fridays. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that during showers, SHU staff
searched every cell. He explained that all of the SHU cells should have been searched on Friday, August 9
because it was a shower day. He said SHU staff should also conduct cell searches when inmates go to the
recreation area or for attorney visits. According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, Epstein’s cell
should have been searched because both Epstein and Inmate 3 left the cell on the morning of August 9. He
further stated that he believed that the majority of cells in the SHU were searched although, as noted above,
the SHU staff logged only one cell search in TRUSCOPE on August 9 and the search was not of Epstein’s cell.

strips and tied like a noose. Figure 6.5 depicts one such noose, which is illustrative of the types of linens found in
Epstein’s cell; the noose depicted is not the ligature Epstein used to kill himself.

information and provides unit officers an electronic event log.
