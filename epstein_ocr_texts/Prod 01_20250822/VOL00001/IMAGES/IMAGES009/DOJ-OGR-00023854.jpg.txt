Wow, right as | finished my last email, my boss just gave me the final response that I'll now send to all the
reporters who reached out to our public affairs office in Central Office (you can send this to media who
contacted you too MG
Jeffrey Epstein is currently housed at MCC New York and not in a local hospital as has been
reported. As with all inmates, for privacy and security reasons, we do not share information on an
inmate's medical status or their conditions of confinement.
