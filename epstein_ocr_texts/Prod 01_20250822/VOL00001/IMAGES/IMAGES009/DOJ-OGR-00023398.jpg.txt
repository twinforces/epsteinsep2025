believed that his cell mate had something to do with it. BOP’s Special Investigative Services (SIS) opened an
investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether Epstein harmed himself or had
been assaulted.
On July 24, 2019, at approximately 8:45 a.m., Epstein was removed from suicide watch. However, Epstein
remained in the same cell that he was placed in the previous day and was under psychological observation
until July 30, 2019.4
The MCC New York Chief Psychologist told the OIG that an inmate is placed on suicide watch when the
inmate is believed to be imminently suicidal. During suicide watch, the inmate is under constant
observation by staff; the cell lights are on 24 hours a day; and the inmate is given a special mattress,
blanket, and smock to wear. The Chief Psychologist explained that although psychological observation is a
lower classification, at MCC New York the psychological observations were the same as suicide watch except
that inmates were allowed to have their clothing and some materials, such as books, as determined by
Psychology Department. At MCC New York, psychological observation was used to see how an inmate was
doing before releasing the inmate to a housing unit.
The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that the Psychology Department independently makes the decision who
goes on and off suicide watch. The Chief Psychologist also stated that the Psychology Department makes
recommendations to the institution’s management about where inmates are housed when they come off of
suicide watch. According to her, the Psychology Department always recommends that inmates coming off
of suicide watch be housed with other inmates; however, she said the recommendations cannot always be
carried out due to other security factors. When that occurs, the Psychology Department recommends
conducting increased rounds and keeping an eye on those inmates.
The Chief Psychologist further told the OIG that, based on a conversation with the BOP’s National Suicide
Prevention Coordinator from the BOP’s Central Office, she passed along to the MCC New York executive
staff the recommendation that Epstein be housed with an alleged sex offender in the SHU.*° The Chief
Psychologist stated that the MCC New York Warden and Associate Wardens decided who Epstein would be
housed with and the Psychology Department was not involved in that decision.
According to BOP records, as a result of the July 23 incident, MCC New York subsequently conducted
disciplinary proceedings against Epstein for alleged self-mutilation, but ultimately found that there was
insufficient evidence to find that Epstein engaged in a prohibited act. When Epstein was psychologically
evaluated on July 30, 2019, in connection with disciplinary proceedings, Epstein said he did not remember
how he obtained the marks around his neck. On August 2, 2019, the SIS investigation into the July 23, 2019,
incident was completed and found insufficient evidence to support either that Epstein had harmed himself
or that he had been harmed by his cellmate.
74 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU
on July 30, 2019.
5 Neither of Epstein’s cellmates at MCC New York were alleged to be sex offenders.
