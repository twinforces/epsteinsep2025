The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he eventually learned later that evening that
Epstein did not have a cellmate. According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after Epstein
returned from his attorney visit and placed a telephone call, he escorted Epstein to his cell and saw that
Inmate 3 was not there. According to the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, after he realized that
Epstein did not have a cellmate, he, Noel, and the Material Handler, all of whom were working in the SHU
that evening, talked about Epstein needing a new cellmate. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said
SHU staff could not just put anyone in the cell with Epstein. In his interview with the OIG, the Evening Watch
SHU Officer in Charge stated that he called someone (he could not recall who) and notified that person that
Epstein did not have a cellmate. OIG interviews did not identify an individual who received such a call or
who witnessed the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge making it.
Senior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that on August 9, he worked in the SHU from approximately 8:45 a.m.
until 4 p.m. Senior Officer Specialist 5 said when he reported for duty, Epstein was already with his
attorneys, Inmate 3 had already left the SHU, and neither inmate returned to the SHU prior to his departure.
Senior Officer Specialist 5 told the OIG that he did not know Inmate 3 had been released from MCC
New York and that no one told him Epstein would need a new cellmate, including the Day Watch SHU Officer
in Charge, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, or anyone from the Psychology Department.
CO 2 told the OIG that on August 9, he worked in the SHU from 8 a.m. until 4 p.m. CO 2 said he did not
recall Inmate 3 departing the SHU that day, and that he was unaware that Epstein needed a new cellmate.
The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that he was the Operations Lieutenant at the MCC
on August 9 from approximately 2 p.m. until 10 p.m. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he was
aware that Epstein was required to have a cellmate due to a mass email that was sent to all of the MCC
New York Lieutenants. According to the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, everyone who regularly
worked in the SHU should have known that Epstein was required to have a cellmate. The Evening Watch
Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that he did not know Inmate 3 had left MCC New York earlier that day
and was unaware that Epstein did not have a cellmate. He said that if Inmate 3 had been transported to
Receiving and Discharge as “WAB" and the SHU Lieutenant was off, then another supervisor should have
been notified. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that SHU personnel assigned to his
shift should have notified him that Epstein was without a cellmate, but he had not been informed. The OIG’s
investigation revealed, however, that the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant was one of the recipients of
the USMS email notifying MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3’s scheduled transfer out of MCC
New York on August 9. According to the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant, the Acting Evening Watch
Activities Lieutenant conducted the Lieutenant round in the SHU on August 9, and she only would have
known that Epstein was without a cellmate if someone from the SHU told her or if she walked through the
SHU tiers during the round. The Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant said he believed that if the Evening
Watch Acting Activities Lieutenant knew that Epstein did not have a cellmate, she would have notified him.
Both the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant and the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the
OIG that they were unaware that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. The Acting Evening Watch Activities
Lieutenant, who was serving in this position on August 9 from approximately 4 p.m. until 10 p.m., told the
OIG that because her ordinary position was a Senior Officer Specialist, she was not aware that Epstein was
required to have a cellmate. The Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant recalled hearing that Epstein
had been placed on suicide watch, but said she never received specific instructions regarding Epstein. She
said the SHU staff did not tell her about the requirement that Epstein have a cellmate or that his cellmate
