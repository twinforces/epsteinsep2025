I visited inmate Epstein in SHU on Thursday. He was getting ready to meet with his attorneys for the day so I had
gone to visit him right after the SHU meeting. He had a cell mate at the time with whom | saw him interact
with. He did not report any mental health concerns and he denied any suicidal thoughts or intention. He was
asking this writer to go to general population and was making requests for various needs he had at the time.
He wanted social calls without them being on a speaker phone. He wanted a book he had left in the suicide
watch area. His mood was not depressed or anxious. There were no signs of distress. He had planned on
meeting with his attorneys to work on his legal situation.
