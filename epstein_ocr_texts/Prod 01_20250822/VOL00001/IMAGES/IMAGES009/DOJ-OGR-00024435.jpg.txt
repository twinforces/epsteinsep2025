Hi there,
I'm writing a piece for the site Gothamist about conditions at MCC. See allegations below, compiled from
defense attorneys , current prisoners and their loved ones. Please send comment ASAP if you would like to
respond.
Regards
—that some cells in the facility are covered in mold
— that some cells in the facility have separate spouts for hot and cold water, making it impossible for
prisoners to take showers at a reasonable temperature
—that prisoners at MCC are treated with disdain. They “be lucky if they were treated like dirt under
somebody else's shoe, but they're not even treated that well,” said one lawyer
— that overcrowding, understaffing and underresourcing are grave problems at the facility (“whether its
people who are suicidal, people who need medical care, people who need psychiatric care, people who need
spiritual guidance or religious accommodation, people who need programming, so they don't just get
warehoused there - all of that is lacking.”)
— that in the spring of 2019, toilets on the women’s floor at MCC flooded, and the women were forced to
clean up the feces themselves
