With apologies for the weekend email, we have a defendant, Jeffrey Epstein, who was arrested
last night and is currently being detained at MCC, and is expected to be presented on an
indictment tomorrow. His attorney, PQQ OG PP GBhas represented him in the past, and
represents him in connection with our case and has been in touch with us throughout the
weekend. He went to MCC today to meet with him in advance of the presentment tomorrow, but
was just told he is not allowed in because he is from out-of-state.
We’re concerned about the defendant not having access to his attorney in advance of the
presentment (as we would be for any defendant) and so I wanted to reach out to you—is it at all
possible to address this issue s can meet with his client this evening? I’m
available anytime at to discuss, if that’s helpful, or PQI@QVOM: an also be
reached directly at f that’s easier (though if you reach out directly to him if you
could please just let me know afterward I'd be grateful).
thanks very much,
