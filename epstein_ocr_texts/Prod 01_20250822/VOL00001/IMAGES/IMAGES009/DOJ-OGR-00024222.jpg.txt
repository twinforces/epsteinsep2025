Good afternoon Boi â€”_|
Please thank Judge Berman for the opportunity to attend today. Warden Petrucci sends his regrets for not
being able to make it, but he would still appreciate meeting the Judge. Please let me know if Judge Berman
would be amenable and has any open time in his schedule.
Thank you,
Staff Attorney

Good morning Christine,
| apologize, but Warden Petrucci told me he won't be able to make it on Tuesday. As you likely know, we've
had quite a few visitors here at MCC recently. The Warden just learned about a meeting on Tuesday
morning, and he needs to be in attendance. That said, he would welcome the opportunity to meet Judge
Berman another time. Perhaps the Warden and | could go over to the courthouse sometime next week at a
time convenient for the Judge? Please let me know if that sounds feasible.
Thank you for your help, and | look forward to seeing you on Monday (re ey and Tuesday.
Best,
- Attorney
