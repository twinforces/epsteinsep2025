Psychology verbally notifies the Operations Lieutenant when inmates are removed from suicide watch and that they
will need to be placed with a cellmate. Cellmates are recommended not only for SHU inmates being removed from
suicide watch, but also for inmates returning to the general population setting. The C&A officer is responsible for
entering the proper assignment.
Once an inmate is removed from suicide watch, psychology staff sends an e-mail to the Executive Staff, IDO, and
Lieutenants informing them the inmate is being removed from suicide watch and can return to a cell with a cellmate.
The e-mail contains the name of the staff member whom psychology verbally spoke with. This recommendation for
a cellmate and conversation with the Lieutenant is also documented in the Post Suicide Watch Report and placed in
BEMR/PDS.
Psychology Services has eliminated the use of Psychological Observation to avoid any confusion as to the needs of
inmates on a watch status.
2. Rounds: 30-minute rounds are required by P5500.14, Correctional Services Procedures Manual.
Institution Response: 2. Rounds:
SHU training is conducted quarterly in which emphasis will be placed on the importance of diligent rounds within
the policy guided timeframes. In addition, the SHU Lieutenant will review documentation (SHU Round Sheets) on a
daily basis and provide the Captain with an assurance memorandum of their completion weekly. SHU Rounds sheets
will be maintained on the specified range to ensure officers are completing required rounds. A staff member must
observe all inmates confined in continuous locked down status, such as administrative detention or disciplinary
segregation, at least once in the first 30 minute period of the hour, followed by another round in the second 30
minute period of the same hour, thus ensuring an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are to be
conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 40 minutes apart. All observations must be documented.
Closer observation may be required for an inmate who is mentally ill, or who demonstrates unusual or bizarre
behavior. These inmates have been identified with an orange photographic door tag to ensure staff are aware to take
more security pre-cautions in dealing with this inmate. Two hour Captain video review and six hour IDO video
review are being conducted.

3. Cellmate Assignments: When Mr. Epstein was placed in SHU on July 7, 2019" —
In an effort to treat Mr. Epstein the same as other inmates, a statement
repeated by multiple staff, Executive Staff may have inadvertently overlooked the need to consider unique risk
factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and convicted of a sex offense. On July 25, 2019,
ere kent an e-mail to Shirley Skipper-Scott, Associate Warden explaining a consultation between © 07 __ |
National Suicide Prevention Coordinator. In the e-mail, [°° __]Reviewed the consult and
recommendation from the Psychology Services Branch, Central Office that Mr. Epstein be housed with another
inmate who had also been accused of committing a sex offense. There is no evidence this information was
considered beyond this e-mail, and Mr. Epstein was never housed with another inmate charged or convicted of a

sexual offense.
