Good morning all,
Epstein's attorneys are trying to get him his CPAP machine per our request. Can we have them hand-deliver
it to medical staff as we have in previous instances?
Thank you,

Mr.
Is Mr. Epstein approved to receive a CPAP machine? If so, should we
send it directly to him through the inmate mail system? Please confirm.
Thank you.
