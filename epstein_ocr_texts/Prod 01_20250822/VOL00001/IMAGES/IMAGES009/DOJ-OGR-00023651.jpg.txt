Hello i
I left you a voicemail earlier today regarding my paralegal application for Jeffrey Epstein, Reg.
#763 18-054. I was told today by the lobby guards that I had to re-submit my application and to
ask the legal department directly on the reasoning. I wanted to reach out to ask what in my
application needed to be changed or fixed so that I do not repeat the mistake.
I really appreciate your help.
Thank you,
