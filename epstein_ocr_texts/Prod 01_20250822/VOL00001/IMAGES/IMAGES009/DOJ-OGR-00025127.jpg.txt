MEMORANDUM FOR J. PETRUCCI, WARDEN

MCC NEW YO
FROM: J. Ray Ormo t Pastors’ Director
Northeast Region
SUBJECT: After Action Review Team
On August 14, 2019, a team of staff will arrive at MCC New York
to perform an After Action Review on the apparent suicide of
Inmate Jeffrey Epstein Reg. No. 76318-054. The duration of this
visit will be fluid and conclude once the assessments are
complete. During this visit, the teams will work largely
independently, but may require your staff to perform specialized
tasks or be available for interviews, etc. Please ensure your
staff are responsive to the team’s requests.
Upon arrival, the team will begin their assessments without
delay. J. A. Keller, Regional Director, Southeast Region, and
the team will meet with you to discuss the plan for the week. I
am requesting you have a staff member from Computer Services
available to assist with any network needs that may arise. If
feasible, any videos or electronic records must be available for
the team to review independently. It may be necessary to
utilize external hard drives or allow team members temporary
access to a local drive. Several team members will have
government issued laptops for use during this review.
As mentioned, ensure your staff are available and responsive.
Also, advise your local union of this visit. Union
representation should be quickly accessible should the need
arise.
