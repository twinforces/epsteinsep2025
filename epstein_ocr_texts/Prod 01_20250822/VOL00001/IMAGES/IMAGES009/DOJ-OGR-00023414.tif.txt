his personally owned medical device. BOP records state that Epstein was aware he would be returning to
the SHU but reported that he did not feel well due to lack of sleep and other medical concerns. Epstein
asked to stay on psychological observation, where he felt safe, for one more night to get some sleep and
then return to the SHU with a cellmate the following day. According to BOP records, the Chief Psychologist
informed Epstein that he could stay 1 more night and explained that there were no mental health issues
precluding him from returning to the SHU the following day. The Chief Psychologist explained to Epstein
that he would be placed in a safe situation in the SHU. Epstein again was provided supportive interventions
and psychoeducation regarding additional coping strategies. BOP records state that Epstein was somewhat
receptive but more concerned with getting phone calls, recreation, and housing placement concerns.
On July 30, 2019, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Staff Psychologist that he had not slept
well, and Epstein discussed how he did not think he would be able to sleep well in the SHU because of the
noise. The Staff Psychologist annotated in the clinical contact summary that documentation revealed
Epstein had eaten and taken a shower the day prior (July 29) and also had eaten breakfast on July 30. The
Staff Psychologist annotated, Epstein did not display indications of disturbed thought process or content
and denied current suicidal or self-harm ideation. BOP records further stated that Epstein agreed to
immediately report to staff if he began to have suicidal or self-harm thoughts and that Epstein was future-
oriented and did not appear to be a danger to himself. The Staff Psychologist noted in her clinical contact
report that she had consulted with the Chief Psychologist and that psychological observation of Epstein
would be discontinued. According to her clinical contact report, the Staff Psychologist educated Epstein
about routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff and noted that
Epstein would be seen the following day to monitor his mental status and provide further intervention if
needed. The Staff Psychologist also noted in her report that the SHU Lieutenant was informed that Epstein
needed to be housed with an appropriate cellmate.
Also on July 30, 2019, the Staff Psychologist completed an evaluation of competency related to Epstein being
able to proceed with the disciplinary process. Epstein had been charged by BOP with a prohibited act,
specifically tattooing or self-mutilation, for the incident that occurred on July 23, 2019. In conducting the
evaluation of competency, the Staff Psychologist reviewed the suicide risk assessment completed by the
Chief Psychologist on July 9, 2019, in which Epstein had denied a history of mental health treatment and
having any past or present suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. The Staff Psychologist also reviewed the
suicide risk assessment that she herself completed, dated July 23, 2019, which stated that it was unclear at
the time if Epstein had placed the string around his neck or if it was done by someone else. According to
the Staff Psychologist’s notes from her competency evaluation on July 30, the determination of an inmate’s
competency to proceed with the disciplinary process was based on a clinical assessment of the inmate’s
ability to understand the nature of the proceedings and his or her ability to assist in his or her own defense.
After a review of available psychological and psychiatric records and information related to the offense, the
Staff Psychologist found that Epstein was competent to proceed with the disciplinary process.
That same day, July 30, Epstein was removed from psychological observation and transferred back to the
SHU, consistent with what he had been told by the Chief Psychologist the prior day.
On July 31, 2019, according to BOP records, Forensic Psychologist 3 conducted a clinical visit with Epstein
and noted that he was in a pleasant mood, generally slept well, and was getting readjusted to being in the
SHU. Epstein told Forensic Psychologist 3 that he was getting along with his cellmate. According to her
report, Epstein explicitly denied recent and current suicidal ideation or intent and denied having thoughts of
