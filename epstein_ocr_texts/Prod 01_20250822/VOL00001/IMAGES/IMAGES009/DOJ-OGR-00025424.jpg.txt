As you are probably aware inmate Epstein was found dead in his SHU cell in NYM this past Saturday
morning. We need to reconstruct as best we can inmate Epstein's 292 record for the week prior to his death
(Monday, August 5, 2019 through Friday, August 9, 2019). Please make this your number one priority and e-
mail me the results when you are done. This is a time critical task.
Thanks.
