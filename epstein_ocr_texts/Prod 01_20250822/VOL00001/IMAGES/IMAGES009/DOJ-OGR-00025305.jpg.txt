Good morning‚Äù |
My apologies, but | have been away from my desk in meetings the past three days. | received your
voicemails regarding the status of Mr. Epstein's personal effects. Presently, while the external investigation
continues, any personal property attributable to Mr. Epstein is being held as evidence. Once the outside
investigators release the property, we hope to be able to return it to his family as expeditiously as possible.
If you have any further questions, please email me and we can try to arrange a mutually convenient time to
chat further.
Thank you,
