review, may be granted an additional six hours of library time on
Fridays by making a request to the Education Department. All
requests for additional law library time are, of course, subject
to staff availability, number of inmate requests, and security
concerns. If the pretrial inmate is pro se, as in representing
his/herself, the inmate should provide the Education Department
with official court documentation verifying his/her status.
There is also a basic law library in the Special Housing Unit
(SHU).
If the law library does not have the reference material the
inmate needs to do the research, the inmate may consult with the
Education Department staff on the possibility of requesting
additional materials.

2. Access to Computerized Discovery Materials
MCC New York’s law library has computers which inmates may access
during their scheduled law library hours.
All electronic discovery materials must be sent in CD-ROM formats
instead of DVD disks. MCC New York currently does not have the
equipment to support DVDs. Material from DVD disks should be
broken down and distributed onto several CDs. MCC New York
computers have the capability to play industry standard audio or
video files in the following formats:
l. video clips of AVI, MPG, MPEG, WMV
2. audio clips of WAV, MP3, WMA
3. documents in PDF form, HTML, TXT, JPG, DOC
Due to licensing issues, MCC New York does not support RealPlayer
recorded audio or video formats, CD-RW disks, files made for a
non-Microsoft computer {such as MacIntosh) or discovery in non-
standard/proprietary format.

3. Leisure Library
All housing units have been assigned a time for utilizing the
leisure library. Inmates should check the unit bulletin board
for days and times scheduled.

4, Service of Process
Bureau staff are prohibited from effecting service of process on
inmates. MCC New York policy requires that an inmate be served
by a federal, state or local law enforcement official (Marshals
or Sheriffs). Because service of process occurs within the
secure confines of the institution, private process servers, who
are not also law enforcement officials, may not serve inmates.
The qualified process server must contact MCC New York’s Inmate
Systems Management department to schedule an appointment before
coming to the institution.
