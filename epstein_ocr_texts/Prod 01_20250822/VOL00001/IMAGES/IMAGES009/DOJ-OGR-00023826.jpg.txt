Hi All,

(Xe) ] asked me last week to reach out to his attorneys to find out what they wanted us to do with the funds. |
explained to defense counsel that our normal practice was to cut a check to the next-of-kin that we have on-
file. However, given the circumstances and the discussion of Epstein's will in the media, | told defense
counsel we wanted to make sure we didn't need to do anything differently here. Defense counsel told me
they would get back to me. | haven't heard from them yet. Is there a deadline by which we need to release
the funds?

Thanks,
