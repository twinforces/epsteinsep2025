The ‘combination of negligence, misconduct, and outright job performance failures: documented in this
report all contributed to'an environment in which arguably one of the most notorious inmates in BOP's
custody w was s provided with the opportunity: ts to take his own life, resulting i in significant questions being asked
importanttlys depriving his humerousivictimns: many of whom’ were e underage girls atthe time of the alleged
crimes, of their ability to seek justice through the:criminal justice process. The*fact that these failures have
been recurring ones atthe BOP: does not excuse them and gives additional urgency to the need for
Department of Justice (DOJ) and BOP leadership to. address the chronic staffing, surveillance, security, and
related problems plaguing the BOP.

The OIG has completed its investigation and is providing this report to’the BOP for appropriate action.

Unléss otherwise noted, the OIG applies thé preponderance of the evidence standard ih determining
whether DO] personnel have committed misconduct. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board applies this
same standard when reviewing a federal agency's decision to take: adverse action againstan employee
based on such misconduct. See'5'U.S.C.'8 7701(c)(1)(B) and 5.C.F.R. 8 1201.56(b)(1)(ii).

A. MCC New York.Staff Failed to Ensure that Epstein Had a Cellmate on August 9 as
Instructed by‘the Psychology Department on July 30.

On July'30,.2019, the MCG New York Psychology Department'sent an email to over 70 BOP staff members
stating that Epstein “needs to be housed with an.appropriate cellmate.” The Psychology Department's
directive that Epstein have an appropriate cell mate arose out of the events that occurred on July 23, 2019,
when Epstein was ‘found ying o on the ‘floor of his: cell with a piece. of orange: cloth around his neck. Epstein’s
infrate housed on ‘the same SHU t tiér at the. time (inmate 22) corroborated several aspects of imate T's
account. Epstein’s accounts of What’ had occurred varied. Epstein initially told MCC New York staff that he
thought his: cellmate had tried to kill him, but thereafter he repeatedly said he did not know what had
occurred. Epstein later-asked two different MCC New-York staff members: if he could be:housed with the
same cellmate Epstein initially accused of having tried to. harm him.

As a result of this incident, Epstein was placed on suicide watch ‘and then psychological observation.
Consistent with the Psychology Department's diréctive,; the Captain,and the SHU Liéuténant each told the
OIG that théy'verbally informeéd. SHU staff of Epstein’s, cellinate requirement. These and other witnesses
said staff members regularly assigned tothe SHU knew that Epstein needed to have a cellmate. However,
despite the Psychology: Department's widely disseminated July 30 email instruction and the subsequent
verbal direction provided by the: Captain and the SHU Lieutenant, Epstein was left.without.a cellmate on
August 9:and, less than 24 hours later, Epstein died by'suicide.

1. Failure’ to’ Make Required Notifications Regarding the Need to Assign Epstein'a
New Cellmate
The OIG's investigation and review:revealed that on August 9, 2019, MCC New York staff'assigned to the SHU
failed'to notify their superiors that. Epstein's cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred out of MCC New York:

and therefore Epstein needed to be assigned a new cellmate. The failure to make these required
notifications—and the supervisors’ failure to properly supervise the SHU staff, discussed further below—:
