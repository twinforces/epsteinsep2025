Court Ordered Studies
At anytime during an inmate’s pre-trial confinement, the judge
may order one of numerous studies found at 18 U.S.C. $4241 et
seq. Once a judge signs the request for designation, the court
must send a copy to the USMS and Probation who will then contact
Dbscc. Since the inmate is not sentenced, he is not yet in Bureau
custody, therefore the Bureau cannot make the designation without
an official request from the USMS to the Bureau in Grand Prairie.
Neither the Legal Department ner any institution staff have a
role in the process. It is up to the attorneys on the criminal
case to make sure the order is processed as described in this
paragraph. If questions arise, the attorneys may contact the
DSCC {contact info. above).
H. Health Services

1. Sick Call
Inmates are advised during their initial screening and physical
examination that if they wish to be evaluated by the Health
Services Department, they must submit @ sick call slip to the
department. It i858 imperative that inmate’s use this system, as
it helps the department track requests and have inmates seen on a4
first need to be seen basis. If an inmate has a verified chronic
condition (i.e. diabetes, hypertension, etc.) he will be placed
in a chronic care clinic and scheduled for appointments
automatically.
Sick call slips are available on the housing units and there is a
sick call box on each unit in which to submit the slips. The
sick call box on each housing unit will he emptied daily by a
member of Health Services Staff and given to the medical staff
for triage. Requests will be prioritized in accordance with
greatest medical need. Inmates will be charged a $2.00 co-pay
fee for all non-chronic care, non-emergent appointments.

2. Emergency Care
Any time there is a medical emergency on a unit, the inmate
should notify the unit officer who can call the on-duty P.A.

3. Medication
With regards to medication, MCC New York staff will make every
effort to continue an inmate on a specific medication as long as
the inmate has proof that he is on that medication {a
prescription, a prescription bottle, ete.). However, for safety
of staff and other inmates, there are several medications that an
inmate may be on that are not on the national Bureau of Prisons
formulary. In this instance, if medical staff find it necessary
to prescribe a substitute medication, they will do se. If an
inmate is prescribed a medication that has refills, it is their
responsibility to notify the pharmacy when they need a refill.
