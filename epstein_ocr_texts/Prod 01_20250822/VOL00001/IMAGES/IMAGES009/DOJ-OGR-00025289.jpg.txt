[icy this looks like an outstanding report. Its unbelieveable all you report without the benefit of
interviews or video, and it raises significant concerns. After you get feedback, please send me a
final draft. Please mark it as draft so I can give to the director as a draft. She is considering
asking you to label this as an interim report in light of the limited ability to do interviews. But she
can decide once she sees this report. Thanks again.
