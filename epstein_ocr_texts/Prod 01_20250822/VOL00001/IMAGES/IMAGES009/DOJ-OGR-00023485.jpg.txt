Appendix B: OIG Analysis of the BOP’s Response

The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) provided a draft of this report to the Federal Bureau of Prisons
(BOP), and the BOP’s response is incorporated as Appendix A. The BOP indicated in its response that it
agreed with all eight recommendations.
The following provides the OIG’s analysis of the BOP’s response and a summary of the actions necessary to
close the recommendations. The OIG requests that the BOP provide an update on the status of its response
to the recommendations within 90 days of the issuance of this report.
Recommendation 1: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate following suicide
watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or
security considerations.
Status: Resolved.
BOP Response: The BOP reported the following:

The BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in custody who face mental

health challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation. Our practice is to

carefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved and overarching

safety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP has updated its

process related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP's revised process,

upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists make

individualized care recommendations about clinical follow-up and other custodial concerns,

including housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees work

collaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed

appropriately.
OIG Analysis: The BOP’s response is responsive to this recommendation. The OIG will consider whether to
close this recommendation after the BOP (1) provides for the OIG's review a proposed process for assigning
a cellmate following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the
particular individual or security considerations, that addresses issues identified in the OIG’s report; and (2)
implements the process.
Recommendation 2: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for suicide
and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the
recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate re-
assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security
considerations.
Status: Resolved.
BOP Response: The BOP reported the following:

The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As described in its response to Recommendation

1. BOP’s current process related to suicide watch and psychological observation applies an
