7. Follow-Up: Mr. Epstein arrived at MCC New York on Saturday, July 6, 2019. While conducting the 10:00 p.m.
institution count thatevening/"™ "i" ‘| Facilities Assistant reported she observed Mr. Epstein in his cell. In an e-
mail she sent to Drs Bio | SEE fd Lieutenant" ater that evening, she described Mr. Epstein as
"distraught, sad and a little confused." She said she then asked Mr. Epstein if he was okay, and he reportedly said he
was. However, Ms. [Re |noted in her e-mail she was not convinced of this, adding, "He seems dazed and
withdrawn." She went on to say, "So just to be on the safe side and prevent any suicidal thoughts can someone from
Psychology come and talk with him." Despite the fact that Lieutenar™”™ pened the e-mail there is no evidence
that he contacted the on-call psychologist as is required by P5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program. Additionally, if
Ms. Peo pas concerned about suicide risk, P5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program, requires her to maintain direct,
continuous observation of Mr. Epstein. When["""° _|opened the e-mail the following Monday morning, Mr.
Epstein was evaluated by"°""™ at approximately 9:30 a.m.
Mr. Epstein was denied bail on Thursday, July 18, 2019. This was a significant disappointment for Mr. Epstein and
likely challenged his ability and willingness to adapt to incarceration. Given the potential impact of the judge's
decision, a psychologist should have assessed Mr. Epstein's mental status upon his return to the institution. The BOP
developed a SENTRY assignment of PSY ALERT for purposes such as this.
Specifically PSY ALERT is used "to ensure, if movement occurs, that all staff consider the special psychological
and management-related risks associated with the inmate." Furthermore, P5324.07, SENTRY Psychology Alert
Function states, "When a decision to move [any PSY ALERT] inmate occurs, any special psychological needs of the
inmate are reviewed and considered by Psychology Services staff [and] any safety and security concerns are
highlighted for non-Psychology Services staff." Psychologists should use the PSY ALERT assignment more
frequently with high profile cases and with inmates who have a history or charge of sex offense. Both of these
groups of inmates are susceptible to exaggerated or unrealistic fears about correctional settings and experience stress
associated during movement and periods of transition (e.g., cell/unit changes, movement to and from court,
institutional movement, and release of information through the media).
Mr. Epstein was reportedly in court on July 31, 2019. It is unknown what time he departed or returned to MCC New
York because this information was not entered in SENTRY. Regardless, upon his return, the United States Marshals
Service (USMS) provided R&D staff with a Prisoner Custody Alert Notice regarding Mr. Epstein. The notice
indicated Mr. Epstein had "MTL Mental Concerns Suicidal Tendencies." The USMS requested R&D staff sign the
form, and they then departed with the signed copy. On August 1, 2019, at 8:46 a.m., Def Dr fei, [an e-
mail reporting she had just become aware of the above information. In the absence of additional information about
this notation, this should have been considered a referral to Psychology Services about a potentially suicidal inmate
and procedures should have been followed as outlined in P5324.08, Suicide Prevention Program. Specifically, when
a staff member becomes aware an inmate may be thinking about suicide during normal working hours, that staff
member must contact Psychology Services and maintain the inmate under direct,continuous observation until he is
placed on Suicide Watch or seen by a psychologist. There is no evidence Mr. Epstein was monitored under these
conditions from the time he returned from court until he was seen by Dr. Bi, [or a suicide risk assessment on
August 1, 2019, at approximately 1:30 p.m.
Institution Response: 7. Follow Up:
Staff have been trained that it is required that they make verbal contact with either Psychology Staff or a Lieutenant
when they have concerns for an inmate’s mental health. If Psychology Staff is not in the institution, an inmate is
placed on suicide watch, and the on-call psychologist and Warden are notified.

As part of their signature block, all Psychology staff have added the following: “If you are emailing about an inmate
that may be at risk for suicide or self-harm, this is an emergency situation. Please make sure that you make contact
