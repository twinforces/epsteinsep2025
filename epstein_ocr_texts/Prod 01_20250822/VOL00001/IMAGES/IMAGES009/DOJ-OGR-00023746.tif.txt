MCC New York staff are aware of the importance of the
institution’s pretrial detention mission. MCC New York staff
are expected to act in a professionali manner and are governed by
a code of employee conduct. Attorneys who feel that they have
been treated unprofessionaliy by a staff member are asked to put
their complaint in writing to the Warden's Office, MCC New York,
150 Park Row, New York, NY 10007. All complaints will be looked
inte and appropriate action will be taken if necessary.
In turn, our staff appreciate the professionalism and courtesy
expected from attorneys and other officers of the court.
Attorneys are expected not only to abide by the Attorney Guide,
but generally to act in a professional manner. In addition, ail
visitors are expected to refrain from using profanity and keep
their voices at a conversational level when speaking with staff,
inmates and other visitors. All visitors, inciuding attorneys,
are prohibited from using cell phones within the institution,
including the lobby.
All visitors, ineluding attorneys, who violate MCC New York's
visiting rules, create disturbances at the institution or in any
way jeopardize the security or orderly operation of the
institution may have their visiting privileges restricted or
suspended.
The information contained in this Guide is meant to be a general
guideline and is not all-inclusive. We cannot envision every

contain the answers to all questions. For example, in the event
ef an institution emergency, security needs of the institution
will override any portion of this Attorney Guide.
