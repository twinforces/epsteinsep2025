SUBJECT: RESUBMITTAL OF PROCEDURAL MEMORANDUM FOR
PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION
The original Procedural memorandum for Psychological Observation was initially submitted on July 20,
2005 to the Warden and through the Associate Warden of Programs. The procedures outlined below
have been in effect since the aforementioned date. This memorandum is being resubmitted as revisions
have been made since this period of time and updated signatures are necessary.
1. PURPOSE: To establish procedures at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC),
New York with regard to inmates placed on Psychological Observation status.
2) DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a
mental illness, a serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental
status), or drug intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate
is no longer mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general
population or the Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological
observation differ from inmates placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal
(e.g., have not expressed self-harm or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to
his/her impairment in mental status or functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping,
disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her behavior can be unpredictable.
Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary designation to be utilized until
such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to function independently in
general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or transferred to an
inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.
3. PROCEDURES: The following are the guidelines for a Psychological Observation:
A. Only a member from the Psychology Services Department may place and remove an
inmate from Psychological Observation status as only a psychologist can determine if an
inmate is at elevated risk for suicide or not. Upon placement or removal of Psychological |
Observation, the Psychologist will notify the Operations Lieutenant, Health Services Staff
(i.e., Physician Assistants, Health Services Administrator, and Clinical Director), Food
Service Administrator, and Duty Officer.
B. Psychological Observations will be conducted in the suicide watch area or when not
feasible due to space limitations, one of the designated suicide watch cells in SHU. The
inmate on observation will be continuously monitored by either an Inmate Companion or a
