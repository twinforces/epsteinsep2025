Sent: Thu, 25 Jul 2019 10:39:12 +0000
Good morning,

Reaching out in response to reports that Jeffrey Epstein, being held at Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, was found
injured in his cell after a possible suicide attempt, allegedly semi-conscious with marks on his neck.
Can you provide a statement in response to these reports and clarify what happened? Is there a possibility that Epstein will be
transferred to another facility?
Feel free to give us a call at 718-861-(9]Gi
Thank you.
Best,
