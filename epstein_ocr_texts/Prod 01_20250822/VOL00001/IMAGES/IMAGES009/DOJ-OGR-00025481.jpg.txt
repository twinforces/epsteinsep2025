Questions & Proposed Responses:
Hello, I’m working on a story about morale at MCC in Manhattan in the wake of charges against
I’ve spoken to an AFGE union official ang ldefense
attorney. The story will run over the weekend so I’d appreciate a response by COB today.
The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification
of documents charges. Morale was already bad because of staffing issues. The story will also note
that the facility itself is in very bad shape and that, according to people I spoke to, there has not
been a hiring surge or any major reforms in the wake of Jeffrey Epstein’s suicide.
