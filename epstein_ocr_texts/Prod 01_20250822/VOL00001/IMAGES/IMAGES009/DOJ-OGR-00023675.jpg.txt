Good afternoon all,
Below please find concerns raised by Epstein's attorneys with legal visiting. To summarize, they are

1) greater access for Epstein using the bathroom during legal visits;
2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference.
Please review and advise so that | can respond. Thank you.
