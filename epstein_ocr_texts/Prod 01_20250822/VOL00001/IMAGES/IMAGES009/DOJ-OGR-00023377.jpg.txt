Center, which maintains the master count of all inmates, and then remain in the unit until the Control
Center accepts the count. If a count reported verbally does not match the master count, then the Control
Center must notify the Operations Lieutenant and the staff members must recount the inmates. If the
second count does not match the master count, then the Operations Lieutenant will order a bed-book
count, that is, when inmates are counted using their picture cards, which are on file in the Control Center. A
Lieutenant must take at least 1 count in the morning and one in the evening.
Correctional staff prepare count slips for each count, which must be prepared in ink, signed by both officers,
and retained for 30 days. Count slips may not be altered. BOP policy provides that the “official count will
not be cleared until all count slips are received and verified in the Control Center.”

b. 30-Minute Rounds
The BOP uses additional accountability measures for inmates who are in administrative detention or
disciplinary segregation, i.e., for those detained in a SHU. In such cases, a correctional staff member must
observe all inmates at least twice an hour, once during the first 30 minutes (e.g., 12 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.) and
again during the second 30 minutes (e.g., 12:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.). BOP policy provides that these “rounds are
to be conducted on an irregular schedule and no more than 40 minutes apart.” These same requirements
for rounds are also described in the Post Orders for the MCC New York's SHU.

c. Documentation Regarding Inmate Status and Confinement
BOP policy also provides that each institution must prepare a daily change/transfer sheet, which indicates
changes to an inmate's status, including housing and job assignments and medical convalescence. The MCC
New York SHU Post Orders require that correctional staff assigned to the SHU create a SHU file for each
inmate housed in that unit and that morning watch officers audit the inmate files every night. The MCC
New York SHU Post Orders further specify that all pertinent information about an inmate's confinement
should be noted on a Special Housing Unit Record Form (BP-292), and that SHU officers must maintain a log
of pertinent information regarding inmate activity and enter such information into the BOP computer
system TRUSCOPE, which provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related
information and provides unit officers an electronic event log.

d. Cell Searches
BOP policy requires that BOP staff routinely and irregularly search housing units to, among other things,
maintain sanitary standards and eliminate safety hazards.’* The MCC New York SHU Post Orders require
that officers assigned to the SHU conduct searches of the SHU common areas and cells, and that the entire
SHU be searched every week. BOP policy and MCC New York SHU Post Orders require written
documentation of each housing unit search.

3. Psychological Screening

a. Initial Screening
Pursuant to BOP policy governing inmates in pretrial detention status (Program Statement 7331.04, Pretrial
Inmates), all pretrial inmates must have an initial risk/needs assessment screening within 48 hours of
12 BOP Program Statement 5521.06, Searches of Housing Units, Inmates, and Inmate Work Areas.
