Chapter 3: Timeline of Key Events

Except as otherwise noted, the following information is derived from the Federal Bureau of

Prisons (BOP) records and the Office of the Inspector General's interviews.

September 21-24, The BOP awards contracts to two companies (Company 1 and 2) to

2018 upgrade the security camera system at Metropolitan Correctional Center
in New York, New York (MCC New York). At the time, images from the
MCC New York's analog video cameras are recorded to a Digital Video
Recorder (DVR) system, which is divided into two DVR systems. Cameras
assigned to the DVR 1 system record only to the DVR 1 hard drives, and
cameras assigned to DVR 2 system record only to the DVR 2 hard drives.

March 17, 2019 In connection with MCC New York's upgrade of its security camera
system, the BOP’s Northeast Regional Office begins arranging for
technicians from other BOP institutions to perform temporary duty (TDY)
assignments to MCC New York to perform necessary mechanical,
electrical, plumbing, and wiring work. However, during the course of the
TDY rotations, work is not consistently conducted on the camera upgrade
because TDY personnel are sometimes used to cover shortages at MCC
New York's custody posts.

July 2, 2019 According to court records, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York returns an indictment charging
Epstein with sex trafficking and conspiracy to commit sex trafficking.

July 6, 2019 Epstein is arrested at an airport in New Jersey and is transported for
detention pending his initial court appearance to the MCC New York as a
pretrial detainee. Epstein is placed in the general inmate population and
medically screened.

July 7, 2019 An MCC New York Facilities Assistant asks the Psychology Department to
evaluate Epstein because he appears “distraught, sad, and a little
confused.” Epstein is assigned to the MCC New York's Special Housing
Unit (SHU) because of significant media attention and his notoriety
among other MCC New York inmates.”

The SHU is a housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate
population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their own safety as well as the
safety of staff and other inmates.
