fact, they had not.°
On November 19, 2019, a federal grand jury of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
returned an indictment that charged Noel and Thomas with one count each of conspiracy and multiple
counts each of falsification of records, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 88 371, 1001(a)(3), and 2. The indictment
alleged that on August 9, 2019, Noel failed to conduct the mandatory 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. counts of inmates
in the MCC New York SHU, and that on August 10, 2019, both she and Thomas failed to conduct the
mandatory 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. counts and mandatory 30-minute rounds within the MCC New York
SHU. The indictment further alleged that Noel and Thomas created, certified, and submitted false
documentation indicating that the counts and rounds had been done as required to conceal their failure to
perform their assigned duties. As a result, it appeared from documentation that prisoners in the SHU,
including Epstein, were being regularly monitored when, in fact, no CO had checked on Epstein from
approximately 10:40 p.m. on August 9, 2019, until approximately 6:30 a.m. on August 10, 2019, when
Epstein was found hanged in his cell.
On May 25, 2021, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York entered into deferred
prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas. Their respective agreements, which are part of the court
record in their cases, included admissions by Noel and Thomas that they falsely certified that they had
conducted counts and rounds. The agreements also required each of them to truthfully and completely
disclose all information related to their activities and employment with the BOP; be interviewed by the
U.S. Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York, the FBI, and the OIG; complete 100 hours of
community service; refrain from violating the law; and fulfill other conditions related to pretrial supervision
and their establishment of good behavior. On December 13, 2021, after Noel and Thomas successfully
fulfilled the terms of their deferred prosecution agreements as determined by the prosecutors, the
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York entered a nolle prosequi order and dismissed all
charges pending against them. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York for other BOP employees assigned to the SHU who also falsely certified inmate count
slips and round sheets on the day before and the day of Epstein’s death.
As discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7 of this report, the OIG found that, in addition to Noel and
Thomas, many other MCC New York staff members engaged in administrative misconduct, exercised poor
judgment, and/or failed to adequately perform their assigned duties.
I. Methodology
During the course of this investigation, the OIG interviewed 54 witnesses, several on more than one
occasion. The witnesses interviewed included Noel, Thomas, and other MCC New York staff assigned to the
SHU on August 9-10, 2019; MCC New York supervisors at the time of Epstein’s death, including the Warden,
Associate Wardens, Captain, and Lieutenants; medical staff; staff members responsible for the MCC
New York security camera system; other BOP staff and contractors; and a relative of Epstein, who had

Sheet.” Each of the 6 tiers in the SHU had a separate round sheet, each of which had 13 entries reflecting 30-minute
rounds were conducted, when they were not, in fact, completed.
