Thank you for letting me know and for your response.
I was informed ON ie he had submitted my completed application to the legal department for the inmate
Jeffrey Epstein yesterday morning. Does this reflect any of your records? If not, I will be happy to resubmit. If so, can I send
the application to you directly via email? Please let me know.
Thanks again,

Attached starting at p. 26, please find the application and NCIC check form. Paralegals must submit new applications yearly to
retain legal visiting privileges. Please be advised, our records reflected that your last application expired in September 2018.
Please complete the attached and return them for processing at your earliest convenience.
