Hello BO
I left you a voicemail earlier today regarding my paralegal application for Jeffrey Epstein, Reg. #76318-054. I was told
today by the lobby guards that I had to re-submit my application and to ask the legal department directly on the reasoning. I
wanted to reach out to ask what in my application needed to be changed or fixed so that I do not repeat the mistake.
I really appreciate your help.
Thank you,
DOJ-OGR-00023652
