The thrust of the story is that morale has plummeted at the facility in the wake of the falsification

(2) Has there been a hiring surge since Epstein’s suicide?
(3) Any changes in BOP policies following Epstein’s suicide?
(4) Is it correct thatPorr™ were responsible for roughly 50 to 70 inmates the night of

Pt
(5) What is the attrition rate for BOP correctional officers? What’s the average length of time a
person stays in the job? (NYC-area would be best if it’s available.)
