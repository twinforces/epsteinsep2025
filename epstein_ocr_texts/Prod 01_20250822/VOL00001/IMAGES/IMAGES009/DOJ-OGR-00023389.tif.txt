obligations as a registered sex offender. The court found that the United States had also shown by a
preponderance of the evidence that Epstein was a flight risk based on the severity of the criminal charges
and severity of the potential punishment; the strength of the evidence against Epstein; and Epstein’s
criminal history, sex offender registration, vast wealth and substantial liquid assets, multiple residences, a
foreign residence, limited family ties in the United States, private plane(s), extensive overseas travel, and
possession of a foreign passport bearing Epstein’s photograph but not his name. Finally, the court found
that Epstein’s pretrial release proposal was inadequate because, among other things, it did not contain
sworn, accurate, or comprehensive financial statements; it required excessive court involvement in routine
aspects of the proposed home confinement; the proposed consent to extradition was unenforceable; and
the proposed appointment of a trustee to monitor Epstein’s compliance with release conditions was
unacceptably vague and problematic due to the potential conflict of interest presented by monitoring the
conduct of a person who paid the trustee's salary, and allegations that Epstein engaged in unlawful acts with
his employees during the sex trafficking conspiracy. Epstein appealed the court’s order on July 22, 2019.
This appeal remained pending at the time of Epstein’s death.
I. MCC New York's Special Housing Unit
Epstein was initially assigned to MCC New York's general inmate population, but on July 7, 2019, at
approximately 7:20 p.m., he was moved to the SHU pending reclassification due to the significant increase in
media coverage and awareness of his notoriety among other MCC New York inmate residents. The SHU is a
housing unit within MCC New York where inmates are securely separated from the general inmate
population and kept locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day, to ensure their own safety as well
as the safety of staff and other inmates. Inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or
disciplinary segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that
removes an inmate from the general population when it is necessary to do so to ensure the safety, security,
and orderly operation of the correctional facility or to protect the public. The MCC New York employee who
was the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant on August 9, 2019, told the Office of the Inspector
General (OIG) that most inmates housed in the SHU are “locked down” in their cells for most of the day.
Other witnesses told the OIG that SHU inmates are locked in their cells for approximately 23 hours a day.
The Warden of MCC New York during Epstein’s period of detention at that facility, along with Associate
Warden 1 and the Acting Evening Watch Activities Lieutenant, explained that this was one of the reasons
that conducting rounds in the SHU was so important. Unlike inmates in general population housing, SHU
inmates could not physically approach a staff member; therefore, the staff member had to go to each
inmate's cell.
Witnesses told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine in the SHU was to meet with his attorneys in the attorney
conference room all day until approximately 8 p.m.2 MCC New York attorney logs confirmed that Epstein
had daily visits with attorneys from several different law practices throughout the period of his detention at
MCC New York. This is consistent with the information available in SENTRY, a BOP database that contains
information relating to the care, classification, subsistence, protection, discipline, and programs of federal
inmates, which indicates that Epstein had one to two attorney visits on all but 1 day he was detained at MCC
New York. BOP emails reflect that other attorneys expressed frustration to a Supervisory Staff Attorney with
the BOP’s Consolidated Legal Center for New York because attorneys had to wait hours or were unable to
2 As discussed in Chapter 1, BOP policy provides that SHU inmates may be escorted from their cells by MCC New York
staff for visits, including legal visits, court appearances, medical and psychological attention, showers, and recreation.
