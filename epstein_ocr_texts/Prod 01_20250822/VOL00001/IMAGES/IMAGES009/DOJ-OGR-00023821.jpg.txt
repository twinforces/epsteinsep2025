Good afternoon all,
Below please find concerns raised by Epstein's attorneys with legal visiting. To summarize, they
are requesting:
1) greater access for Epstein using the bathroom during legal visits;
2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference.
Please review and advise so that I can respond. Thank you.

Good morning Mr. 90)
I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a
meeting last Friday wit ORT and Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told
our client that he would be allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when
meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer [MBM told my client and I that he would not be
allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or unless he sees a memo from
Liutenant Bor Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the bathroom. Can Mr.
Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone
calls. So far, no phone calls.
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with
