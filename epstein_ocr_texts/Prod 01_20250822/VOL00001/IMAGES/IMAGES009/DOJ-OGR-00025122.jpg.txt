When an existing PSY ALERT inmate who has already been initially screened by the Psychology Department
returns from court routinely, and without a notice from the Judge or Marshal's Office, they will be screened by a
member of the Psychology Department within 24 hours to assess if they are experiencing any significant distress
regarding their court proceedings that may be exacerbating their mental health difficulties and/or risk factors.
Per guidance from Central Office Psychology Division, the Psychology Department will conduct a training with
R&D staff to help train them about PSY ALERT inmates and to recognize signs of psychological distress and
suicidality. Suicide Prevention and PSY ALERT Trainings have recently been conducted by the Psychology
Services Department with Lieutenants and during a recent Department Head Meeting. Further, an e-mail regarding
PSY ALERT procedures was sent to all Lieutenants, Receiving and Discharge (R&D), Psychology and Health
Services staff.

MCC New York has four suicide watch cells and each is for single occupancy use. The suicide watch cells are
located in Health Services. Each cell is abbreviated with the unit code HO1 in SENTRY followed by the four-digit
cell number. The doors are identified by a painted number from one to four. Two reviews were conducted. The first
revealed Mr. Epstein was in HOI-OOIL according to SENTRY but the Suicide Watch Log Books indicate he was in
cell 4. A second review was conducted on August 13, 2019, while there were four inmates on in these cells.
SENTRY showed two inmates assigned to HOI-OOIL, one assigned to H01-002L, and the fourth inmate assigned to a
general population housing unit. Through physical observation of the dedicated suicide watch cells there were four
HOI cells, however a review of the BOPWARE Inmate Housing Format, only shows three cells.
Inmate movement and assignments are not accurately reflected in SENTRY as required by P5500.14, Correctional
Service Procedures Manual.

With regard to the accuracy and accountability of inmates placed on suicide watch status in the hospital area,
Psychology Services now runs a daily SENTRY roster of all the inmates on suicide watch in that area. The roster is
examined to ensure that the inmates placed on suicide watch in a suicide watch cell are keyed into SENTRY with
