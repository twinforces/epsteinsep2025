8. The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional security camera
systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the capacity to
record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system
functionality checks.

As discussed in the Conclusions section of this chapter, the OIG found that, even though the highest levels
of leadership knew of the MCC New York security camera system’s recurring deficiencies, prior to Epstein’s
death, no one was tasked with the responsibility of checking the security camera system on a routine basis
to ensure that the system was functional. As a result, when on July 29, 2019, video from approximately half
of the institution’s security cameras was no longer being recorded, the problem went undetected for
11 days. The OIG also found that there are no BOP policies that specifically state that security camera
systems must have the capacity to record or that institutional staff must perform periodic checks to ensure
the camera system is fully functional. Cameras that are failing to provide good quality or any live video
streams put the safety of BOP staff members and inmates at risk, and the lack of video recordings can
potentially hinder investigations of wrongdoing by staff and inmates. The OIG therefore recommends that
the BOP enhance existing policies and protocols so they specifically state that all institutional security
camera systems must have the capacity to record, and that specified staff at each institution must conduct
periodic checks of the security camera system to determine its operational status and take corrective action
as soon as possible when the system is found to be inoperable. Such routine checks would help ensure that
camera system malfunctions are detected and corrective actions are initiated in a timely manner.
