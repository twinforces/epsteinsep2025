Chapter 7: Conclusions and Recommendations
I. Conclusions
Our investigation and review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) custody, care, and supervision of
Jeffrey Epstein identified numerous and serious failures by employees of the Metropolitan Correctional
Center located in New York, New York (MCC New York), including falsifying BOP records relating to inmate
counts and rounds and multiple violations of MCC New York and BOP policies and procedures, which
compromised Epstein’s safety, the safety of other inmates, and the security of the institution. Specifically,
we found that MCC New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to make sure that,
among other things, Epstein and other inmates were accounted for and safe, such as conducting inmate
counts and 30-minute rounds, searching inmate cells, and ensuring adequate supervision of the Special
Housing Unit (SHU) and the functionality of MCC New York's security camera system.
We further found that multiple BOP employees submitted false documents claiming that they had
performed the required counts and rounds and that several MCC New York staff members lacked candor
when questioned by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) about their actions. Two MCC New York
employees, Tova Noel and Michael Thomas, were charged criminally with falsifying BOP records relating to
their conducting inmate counts and rounds. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York
subsequently entered into deferred prosecution agreements with Noel and Thomas and the court
dismissed all charges against them after Noel and Thomas successfully fulfilled the terms of their
agreements. Prosecution was declined by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York for
other MCC New York employees assigned to the SHU on August 9-10, 2019, who the OIG found also
created, certified, and submitted false documentation regarding inmate counts and rounds on the day
before and the day of Epstein’s death.
The OIG also found that the MCC New York staff failed to carry out the Psychology Department's directive
that Epstein be assigned a cellmate and that an MCC New York supervisor allowed Epstein to make an
unmonitored telephone call the evening before his death.
The OIG determined that the combination of these and other failures led to Epstein being alone and
unmonitored in his cell, with an excessive amount of bed linens, from approximately 10:40 p.m. on
August 9, until he was discovered hanged in his cell at approximately 6:30 a.m. the following day.
Additionally, the OIG found that staffing shortages, a persistent issue for the BOP, compromised the ability
of MCC New York staff to adequately supervise inmates. As detailed below, we make a number of
recommendations to the BOP to address the serious issues we identified during our investigation
and review.
While the OIG determined that MCC New York staff committed significant violations of BOP and MCC
New York policies and falsified records relating to their conducting inmate counts and rounds, the OIG did
not uncover evidence that contradicted the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) determination regarding
the absence of criminality in connection with how Epstein died. All MCC New York staff members who were
interviewed by the OIG said they did not know of any information suggesting that Epstein’s cause of death
was something other than suicide. Likewise, none of the interviewed inmates provided any credible
information that Epstein’s cause of death was something other than suicide.
