Good morning Christine,
| apologize, but Warden Petrucci told me he won't be able to make it on Tuesday. As you likely know, we've
had quite a few visitors here at MCC recently. The Warden just learned about a meeting on Tuesday
morning, and he needs to be in attendance. That said, he would welcome the opportunity to meet Judge
Berman another time. Perhaps the Warden and | could go over to the courthouse sometime next week at a
time convenient for the Judge? Please let me know if that sounds feasible.
Thank you for your help, and | look forward to seeing you on Monday (re and Tuesday.
Best,
. orney
