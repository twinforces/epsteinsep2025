F. Administrative Remedy Program
It is imperative that inmates attempt to resolve any condition of
confinement issues internally either by speaking to appropriate
staff or through the Administrative Remedy Process. Further, all
housing units have bulletin boards that have information
explaining sick call procedures, access to discovery directions,
etc.
The Bureau’s Administrative Remedy Program is a process through
which inmates may seek formal review of an issue relating to
virtually any aspect of their confinement, if informal procedures
have not resolved the matter. See 28 C.F.R. Part 542 -
Administrative Remedy; and Program Statement 1330.13,
Administrative Remedy Program. This program applies as follows:
{1} to inmates confined in institutions operated by the Bureau of
Prisons; (2) to inmates who are designated to contract
Residential Reentry Centers (RRCs), formally known as Community
Corrections Centers, under Bureau of Prisons responsibility; and
(3) to former inmates for issues that arose during their
confinement. See C.F.R. §542.10.
Inmates are obligated to attempt informal resolution of
grievances prior to filing a formal request for administrative
remedy. See 28 C.F.R. $542.13. The deadline for completion of
informal resolution and submission of a formal written
Administrative Remedy Request, on the appropriate form, is 20
calendar days following the date on which the basis for the
Request occurred. See 28 C.F.R. §542.14. Once an inmate has
filed a formal grievance at the institution level (BP-9), the
Warden of that facility has 20 calendar days to investigate anda
provide the inmate a written response. See 28 C.F.R. $542.18.
If the inmate is not satisfied with the Warden’s response, he/she
has 20 calendar days to file a Regional Administrative Remedy
Appeal (BP-10). See 28 C.F.R. §542.15. Once received in the
Regional Office, the Regional Director has 30 calendar days toa
investigate and provide the inmate a written response. See 28
C.F.LR. $542.18. If the inmate is not satisfied with the Regional
Director’s response, he/she has 30 calendar days to file a
Central Office Administrative Remedy Appeal (BP-11). See 28
C.FLR. $15. Once received in the Central Office, the
Administrator, National Inmate Appeals, has 40 days to
investigate and provide the inmate a written response. 28 C.F.R.
§542.18. After receiving the Administrator’s response, the
inmate has exhausted the Bureau's Administrative Remedy Program.
The program provides for expedited investigations and responses
in emergency situations, as well as extensions of time for both
filing grievances and receiving responses. At any level, an
Administrative Remedy may be rejected if it does not fully comply
with Program Statement 1330.13, Administrative Remedy Program.
