It is frankly unbelievable to me that BOP is issuing public press releases on this before telling us basic
information so that we can relay it to his attorneys who can relay it to his family. When can we expect to get
either some sort of statement we can pass along to counsel as accurate and reliable or have a call with
someone?
| understand from the Marshals that they have been unsuccessful in reaching anyone with authority at BOP,
and given the BOP press release that was just put out | assume we need to speak with someone there. Please
advise.
Thank you.
