In April of this year, BOP’s leadership announced tts new mission as "corrections professionals
who foster a humane and secure environment and ensure public safety by preparing individuals
for successful reentry into our communities." BOP’s new core values include accountability,
integrity, respect, compassion, and correctional excellence. Of note, our core value of
accountability requires BOP employees to be responsible and transparent to the public,
ourselves, and to those in our care and custody by the standards we establish, the actions we take,
and the duties we perform. As reflected in our mission and core values, BOP is committed to
providing a safe environment for both employees and adults in our custody.
Recommendation One: The BOP should implement a process for assigning a cellmate
following suicide watch or psychological observation, with criteria for exceptions based on the
particular individual or security considerations.
BOP’s Response: The BOP recognizes the importance of careful monitoring of adults in
custody who face mental health challenges and therefore concurs with this recommendation.
Our practice is to carefully consider both the well-being and safety of the individual involved
and overarching safety and security concerns. In the years since Mr. Epstein’s death, the BOP
has updated its process related to suicide watch and psychological observation. Under BOP’s
revised process, upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, psychologists
make individualized care recommendations about clinical follow-up and other custodial
concerns, including housing and cellmates. Mental health, custody, and unit team employees
work collaboratively to ensure that each individual removed from suicide watch is housed
appropriately.
Recommendation Two: The BOP should establish procedures to ensure inmates at high risk for
suicide and for whom a cellmate is recommended will continue to have a cellmate until the
recommendation is changed or rescinded, including establishing a contingency plan for cellmate
re-assignment, with criteria for exceptions based on the particular individual or security
considerations.
BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. As described in its response to
Recommendation 1, BOP’s current process related to suicide watch and psychological
observation applies an individualized approach to the care and custody of adults in custody.
Upon removal from suicide watch or psychological observation, individualized care
recommendations are made by psychologists, custody, and unit team for each individual. BOP
thoroughly evaluates each celling assignment on an individual basis for persons deemed to be at
moderate to high risk for suicide.
Recommendation Three: The BOP should evaluate its current process for obtaining and
documenting approval for social or legal visits while an inmate is on suicide watch or
psychological observation, which allows for institution-specific variations in the process, and
provide guidance on standard components that each institution should include in its process to
mitigate security issues that can arise when an inmate is on suicide watch or psychological
observation.
