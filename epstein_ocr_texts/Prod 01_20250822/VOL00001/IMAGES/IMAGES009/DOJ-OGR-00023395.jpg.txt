Ill. | Epstein’s Initial Cell and Cellmate Assignment from July 7 to July 23
According to the Warden, MCC New York typically housed inmates in the SHU with a cellmate. Upon
Epstein’s initial transfer to the SHU on July 7, 2019, he was assigned a cell in the M Tier of the SHU with
Inmate 1. The Warden explained that Epstein was a high-profile inmate and that he initially selected
Inmate 1 to be Epstein’s cellmate because Inmate 1 was another high-profile inmate, and the Warden
believed Inmate 1 to be the least likely SHU inmate to harm Epstein.?? Epstein and Inmate 1 were housed
together in cell 205-124.
23 In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty in a Florida state court to a felony charge of procurement of minors to engage in
prostitution in violation of Florida Statute 8 796.03. As a result of this conviction, Epstein was required to register as a
sex offender.
