Re: EPSTEIN, Jeffrey, Federal Register No. 76318-054
United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19-cr-00490-RMB
Dear Chief Judge McMahon and Judge Berman:
I am writing to notify the Court of the death of Jeffrey Epstein, who passed away Saturday,
August 10, 2019, at around 7:37 a.m.
Mr. Epstein had been found unresponsive in his cell in the Special Housing Unit at around
6:30 am from an apparent suicide at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) in New
York, New York. Responding staff immediately initiated life-saving measures and
requested emergency medical services (EMS), by whom Mr. Epstein was transported to a
local hospital for treatment of life-threatening injuries. Mr. Epstein was pronounced dead at
the New York Presbyterian-Lower Manhattan Hospital in New York, New York.
At this time, there are no preliminary reports identifying the exact cause of death. An
autopsy is pending, and we expect to have more information as to the cause of death from the
medical examiner in the near future. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is actively
investigating the incident. In addition to the FBI’s investigation, the Attorney General has
requested that the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General look into the matter
as well.
