Apologies, my prior email was missing some of the contact information for Epstein’s attorneys. Please
disregard the prior subpoena and request.
Attached please find a revised subpoena with a corrected list of attorney phone numbers to exclude.
In addition, please accept our written request for the e-mail correspondence of inmate Jeffrey Epstein
