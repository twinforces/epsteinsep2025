Focus of Session
Inmate Epstein was seen today for a psychological observation contact in the hospital area by this writer.
Subjective/Objective Presentation
Inmate Epstein appeared well and it was noted in his log book and eating/sleeping chart that he has been eating his
meals, sleeping, interacting with the inmate companions, and pacing in his cell. Today, he presented this writer with
numerous concerns and requests. He stated he does not want to be housed in the SHU because he is not comfortable
there; he wants to be single-celled if he goes to the SHU; he wants Colace, not the Ducolex he received from medical
yesterday; he wants to be able to walk around and go to recreation; he does not want to wear an orange uniform to his
legal visits because he is treated “like a punished inmate;" he wants a phone call before he leaves the psychological
observation area; he wants a shower and towel; he would like to be housed in the cadre (5S) unit; and would like his
property, paper, and a pen.
Inmate Epstein's concerns were addressed by this writer and it was explained to him he will not be single-celled or
placed in a housing unit for safety and security concerns. His medical concerns (constipation) were discussed with
health services as well as his desire to be placed on Colace. Inmate Epstein was provided a shower this morning.
Intervention(s)
Inmate Epstein was provided with supportive intervention and coping skills strategies today. He was receptive to
interventions and was able to elucidate his various needs. He did not present with any acute psychopathology and
continues to deny any suicidal ideation, intention, or plan. He is looking forward to his bail hearing on Monday but
stated he is aware that even if he gets bail, it will take at least two weeks to sort things out so he can leave the jail.
Progress/Plan
Inmate Epstein is not in any psychological distress, does not present with any mental health symptoms or complaints,
and is denying any suicidality. He appears psychologically stable at this time and can be released from the
psychological observation area. Inmate Epstein will be housed in the 9S area with a cellmate. He will be seen again
tomorrow by psychology to evaluate his mental status and psychological stability.
