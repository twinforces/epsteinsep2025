the L.Tier during that timeframe other than the inmates who were locked in their assigned cellsi:on that:tier
of the SHU.

We also hoted that the surveillance camera in the L Tiér, as shown in thé photograph in Figure. 6.7, was in
plain view'of the inmates and therefore inmates would Have been aware that any Kallway' movements,
including into or out.of Epstein’s cell, were being live streamed and could be monitored, even if,
unbeknownst'to. them, the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system was not recording the live stream at that
time. As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP. staff'and
inmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing ‘in locations where,
they. know:cameras are: not located.%* Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video.of the
SHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the: desk at the SHU Officers’ Station
immediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their’seats or approached the,
L Tier, We additionally found that Thomas's and Noel's: reaction on the morning of August 10: upon finding.
Epstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates,
was. consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm ‘to Epstein prior to’ Thomas entering Epstein’s
céll at'about 6:30'a.m.:on August 10:

We further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and, psychological:observation
due to the events of July 23, 2019; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his
cell on the morning of August 10; and that he had’signed a new’ Last Will and Testament on August,8, 2 days
before he, died: No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his: death. Additionally, the inmates
who'were interviewed consistently reported that on'the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not
systematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which Was one of the primary mechanisms forthe
SHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed ih the SHU. As a‘résult, Epstein was
unmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an-excess amount.of linens,.which provided an
opportunity for him to commit suicide.

Finally; the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why'Epstein's injuries were:
more consistent'with, and indicative: of, a suicide by hanging rather than a Homicide by strangulation. The:
Medical Examiner also told the OIG thatthe ligaturé ‘furrow was too broad to have been causéd by the
electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that’ blodd toxicology tests revealed rid. Medications.
or illegal substances were in Epstein's system. The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris
under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises.on his body, that
would have indicated Epstein had been astruggle,.which would be expected if’Epstein’s: death had beena
homicide by: strangulation. / .

This is not the first time thatthe OIG has found significant job performance aid management failures on
the ‘part’ of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policiés that aré designed to ensure that
inmates are safé, secure, and in good health. For instance, the OIG's December 2022 investigation and
review of the BOP's handling-of the transfer of James “Whitey” Bulger identified serious job performance and
