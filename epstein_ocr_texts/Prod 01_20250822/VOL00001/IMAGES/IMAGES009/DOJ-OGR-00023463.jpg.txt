the L Tier during that timeframe other than the inmates who were locked in their assigned cells on that tier
of the SHU.
We also noted that the surveillance camera in the L Tier, as shown in the photograph in Figure 6.7, was in
plain view of the inmates and therefore inmates would have been aware that any hallway movements,
including into or out of Epstein’s cell, were being live streamed and could be monitored, even if,
unbeknownst to them, the Digital Video Recorder (DVR) system was not recording the live stream at that
time. As the OIG has noted in numerous prior reports regarding the BOP’s camera system, BOP staff and
inmates are aware of where prison cameras are located and often engage in wrongdoing in locations where
they know cameras are not located.°® Additionally, the OIG did not observe on the recorded video of the
SHU common area that Noel and Thomas, who were seated at the desk at the SHU Officers’ Station
immediately outside the L tier during that time period, at any time rose from their seats or approached the
L Tier. We additionally found that Thomas's and Noel's reaction on the morning of August 10 upon finding
Epstein hanging in his cell, as described to us by Thomas, Noel, the responding Lieutenant, and inmates,
was consistent with their being unaware of any potential harm to Epstein prior to Thomas entering Epstein’s
cell at about 6:30 a.m. on August 10.
We further noted that Epstein had previously been placed on suicide watch and psychological observation
due to the events of July 23, 2019; that numerous nooses made from prison bed sheets were found in his
cell on the morning of August 10; and that he had signed a new Last Will and Testament on August 8, 2 days
before he died. No weapons were recovered from Epstein’s cell after his death. Additionally, the inmates
who were interviewed consistently reported that on the evening Epstein died the SHU staff did not
systematically conduct the required rounds and counts, which was one of the primary mechanisms for the
SHU staff to ensure the safety and security of inmates housed in the SHU. Asa result, Epstein was
unmonitored and locked alone in his cell for hours with an excess amount of linens, which provided an
opportunity for him to commit suicide.
Finally, the Medical Examiner who performed the autopsy detailed for the OIG why Epstein’s injuries were
more consistent with, and indicative of, a suicide by hanging rather than a homicide by strangulation. The
Medical Examiner also told the OIG that the ligature furrow was too broad to have been caused by the
electrical cord of the medical device in Epstein’s cell and that blood toxicology tests revealed no medications
or illegal substances were in Epstein’s system. The Medical Examiner also noted the absence of debris
under Epstein’s fingernails, marks on his hands, contusions to his knuckles, or bruises on his body that
would have indicated Epstein had been a struggle, which would be expected if Epstein’s death had been a
homicide by strangulation.
This is not the first time that the OIG has found significant job performance and management failures on
the part of BOP personnel and widespread disregard of BOP policies that are designed to ensure that
inmates are safe, secure, and in good health. For instance, the OIG’s December 2022 investigation and
review of the BOP’s handling of the transfer of James “Whitey” Bulger identified serious job performance and
