Medical Record, Clinical Interview
Inmate Epstein was placed on psychological observation when he returned from court yesterday evening 7/8/19 for
precautionary reasons. He is not on a suicide watch at this time. He was seen this morning for a psychological observation
contact and suicide risk assessment this morning, 7/9/19, at 7:30 a.m. as it was determined he possessed some at-risk
factors for suicidality.
Reason for Referral
Inmate Epstein is being seen for suicide risk assessment today for precautionary reasons. Inmate Epstein has various
risk factors for suicidality at this time including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense/trafficking charges,
pre-trial status, and he had a court proceeding yesterday which could have given him bad news regarding his legal
situation. As such, this writer instructed R&D staff, as well as the Lieutenant's Office, to immediately notify the
psychology department when he returned from court. Inmate Epstein returned from court after duty hours and denied
suicidality. The aforementioned staff notified the on-call psychologist and inmate Epstein was placed on a precautionary
psychological observation status until psychology could interview him this morning to conduct a suicide risk assessment.
