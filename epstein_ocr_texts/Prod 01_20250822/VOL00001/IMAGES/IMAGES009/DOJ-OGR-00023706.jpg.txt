Good afternoon Mr XO CXC]
Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap
machine was not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.
Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls.
Both times, the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.
Thank you in advance for your help.
Best,
