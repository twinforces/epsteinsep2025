As you might imagine, we are getting increasingly frantic calls from defense counsel who
continue to be seeing information in the press that we—the U.S. Attorney's Office—haven't
yet received. We need to know as soon as possible the very basic facts, such as time and cause
of death at the absolute minimum. It has now been hours since this was reported publicly.
Please advise when we can expect to receive either a written report on those basic facts or
when we can have a call to get that information to relay to his counsel. It is extraordinarily
frustrating to have to tell them that we have less information than the press. Please advise.
Thank you,
