Institutional History: On July 6, 2019, Mr. Epstein was arrested at Teterboro Airport in
New Jersey upon his return from Paris, France. It is unknown whether he was anticipating this
arrest. He was transported to MCC New York and keyed into SENTRY at 9:24 p.m. that
evening. Mr. Epstein was placed in a general population housing unit for approximately 22
hours. On July 7, 2019, at approximately 7:20 p.m. he was moved to the Special Housing Unit
(SHU) pending reclassification due to the significant increase in media coverage and awareness
of his notoriety among the inmate population.
With regard to his adjustment to a correctional setting, Mr. Epstein received one incident report
while in BOP custody for Self-Mutilation on July 23, 2019. As of August 15, 2019, the incident
report had been expunged though it is unclear why it had been expunged and whether
Mr. Epstein knew this. Also, a review of financial transactions associated with Mr. Epstein’s
prison account revealed one of his attorneys was depositing funds into his cellmate’s (inmate
Reyes) commissary account for unknown reasons.

hyperlipidemia, sleep apnea, hypertension, constipation, prediabetes, neuralgia, and neuritis

omega 3, methylprednisone, and bisacodyl. Mr. Epstein was also prescribed insulin, and the
prescription required him to go to the institution pharmacy for administration of this medication.

machine on July 30, 2019, per BEMR.
