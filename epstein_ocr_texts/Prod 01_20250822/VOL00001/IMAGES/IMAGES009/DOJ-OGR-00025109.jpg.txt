3. Cellmate Assignments

Documentation exists reflecting the role of the local Psychology Services department in communicating the
importance of Mr. Epstein's status as a sex offender with specific needs to the Associate Warden. This includes
consultation with the Psychology Services Branch in Central Office. The communication chain and decision
making of Executive Staff lacks transparency as there is no documentation of the process or staff members
present when decisions were made about the housing of Mr. Epstein. After the fact explanations may not
accurately reflect what occurred.

Institution Response:

As was noted, there was no documentation indicating Psychology Services was present when housing decisions
were made regarding Mr. Epstein. Psychology services is present at the weekly SHU meeting, Executive Staff
meetings, and weekly Opening and Close-Out meetings. During these meetings, the Chief Psychologist or
Acting Chief Psychologist are present to provide recommendations and feedback to the Executive Staff on
housing concerns regarding inmates with mental health issues or risk factors for suicidality. When an inmate
presents with unique risk factors associated with individuals who have been charged with and/or convicted of a
sex offense, careful evaluation is made with regard to housing these inmates with appropriate cellmates.
Moving forward, a plan has been established to have a sign-in sheet and checklist at these meetings where
housing issues are addressed, indicating who was present and what the housing plan is for these inmates with
psychological concerns. These checklists will be maintained in a binder by the Associate Warden of Programs.
Please see the attached checklist.

4, Documentation Accuracy

Professional responsibility requires taking into account multiple descriptions of an incident as noted

in your response. However, when discrepancies exist these should be compiled and noted in

documentation to decrease the likelihood of conflicting conclusions.

As noted in the reconstruction report, an incident report must be written within 24 hours of having

the information that an inmate likely violated BOP rules.
Preconceived notions challenge the ability to remain open about alternative
explanations, and subsequent systemic changes may be needed.

Please develop and provide local training for all staff that at a minimum reviews the time frame for

writing incident reports and offers guidance when there is not clear evidence of an infraction. Include

an outline of the training and evidence of staff who attended the training.

Institution Response:

Additional information (slides) has been included in our Annual Training presentations for Report Writing. In
addition to the established training, the slides further differentiate and provide guidance to staff regarding when
it is appropriate to write an Incident Report and when, in cases of a lack of evidence, a memorandum is more
appropriate. The additional information is being provided to all staff as a part of Annual Training. Annual
Training began the week of January 6, 2020, and will continue through the week of March 8, 2020.
