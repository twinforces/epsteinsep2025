Good afternoon Mr. SOO)

Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap machine was not plugged in last

night, so he was unable to use it.

Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls. Both times, the calls were on

speaker phone, with officers present.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Best,
