C. Removal on August 9 of Epstein’s Cellmate from MCC New York
According to MCC Néw York repoits, including the Daily Log:and the Lieutenant's Log, on August 9, 2019, at’
approximately 8:38, a.m., Epstein’s céllmate, Inmate 3, was “pre-temoved”.and trarisferred out. of MCC
New York in:d routine, pre-arranged transfer. The Daily Log’tracks inmate movemenits throtighout MCC
New York.each day; while MCC New York Lieutenants utilize the Lieutenant's Log to document the daily
activities that:took place within the institution during their respective shifts.

The Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist was the, supervisor of Receiving and Discharge on August 9,
2019, and was responsible ‘for overseeing all inmate movements in and out of the institution that day. The
Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist'verified that Réceiving and Discharge would have ‘used the.
USMS emails,sent'on August 8, 2019, 'to coordinate Inmate. 3's:transfer out MCC Néw York, and sincé

Inmate 3.Was listed as “WAB" on the USMS. emails, that meant hé was. being transferred ‘from the facility and
not-coming back. She explained to.the OIG that if Inmate 3 had been going to court, as many pretrial
inmates: held at MCC New York often did, the Baily Log would have reflected “court,” rather than” pre-
remove.” Since the Daily Log listed Inmate 3 as “pre-remove,” the Receiving and Discharge personnel who
entered the information into: the report were made aware that: Inmate 3:was being transferred from MCC.
New York.on or before the morning'of August 9, 2019. The Supervisory Correctional Systems Specialist told
the OIG that the language, in the USMS emails (“WAB,” i.e.,. “with ‘all belongings”) ‘and MCC New York reports
(“‘pre-removed”) made it clear that Inmate 3 would not be:returning to the ‘SHU or MCC New York.

The OIG also interviewed the ‘Correctional Systems Officer, who-was the Receiving and Discharge officer who
handled inmate movement in and out of MCC New York:on August 9, 2019. The Correctional Systems
Officer confirmed that the Daily Log reflected that Inmate 3 was “pre-removed” on August 9, 2019; at
8:38:a.m., because he was being officially moved from the institution to;another prison. She explained to
the OIG that the ordinary process was that Receiving. and Discharge personnel would enter the information
regarding Inmate 3 into SENTRY, along with information pertaining’to other inmates who would be leaving
their MEC NewYork. housing units. Receiving and Discharge. used this information to create the daily call
out list, which had.all of the inmates” names ‘and times that they were to be moved. The Correctional
Systems ‘Officer told the OIG that the call out list’from August 9, 2019, was rio longer available because the
call out lists'were printed and hand-deliveréd to thé housing units, each day, and then discarded by the units
at the.end of the day. She also said each day's call out list was.only maintained electronically for a 24-hour
period, and then it was updated (overwritten) with the next.day’s list. In her OIG interview, the Correctional
Systems Officer explained what would have occurred on this: date: based on her experience. Receiving and
Discharge personnel would have printed copies of" the call out list for August 9, 2019, which the MCC

New York internal officer would distribute to the various housing units within the facility. Based on the
other records reflecting Inmate 3’s ‘transfer, the Correctional Systems Officer:said the call out list created for
August 9, 2019, would have listed “WAB” next:to Inmate 3's name, which meant that he was departing from
the institution and not,returning.

Correctional Officer (CO) 1 told the OIG that on the morning of August 9, 2019, he and Day Watch SHU
Officer in Charge escorted Inmate 3 to Receiving and Discharge and Epstein to his legal visit.
