Just a heads-up that Judge Berman invited the Warden and I to the hearing this morning. The Warden
declined because of another meeting and asked to meet the Judge at a later date, but I'll be attending. I asked
(BORAAOH Judge Berman's expectation was for me to sit at counsel's table or in the galley, but she never
responded. In that case, I defer to you unless we hear otherwise when we get there.
Thanks,
