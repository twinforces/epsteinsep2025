Hello]
| left you a voicemail earlier today regarding my paralegal application for Jeffrey Epstein, Reg. #76318-
054. | was told today by the lobby guards that | had to re-submit my application and to ask the legal
department directly on the reasoning. | wanted to reach out to ask what in my application needed to be
changed or fixed so that | do not repeat the mistake.
| really appreciate your help.
Thank you,
