Comments
This writer consulted a ll Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has various risk
factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pre-trial status, and a court
proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal situation. As such, when inmate
Epstein returns from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been informed to immediately notify the psychology
department. If he returns after duty hours, the aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist
and to place inmate Epstein on a watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment.
