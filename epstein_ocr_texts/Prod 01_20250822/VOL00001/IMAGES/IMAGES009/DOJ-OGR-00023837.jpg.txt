Good morning Mr _|
| tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last
Friday wit SOOO Sand Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be
allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday,
Officer [IBRBtold my client and | that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could
come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenan{ior Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far,
no phone calls.
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, heâ€™s been eating snacks from the vending machines
and no proper meal.
Thank you in advance for your help.
Sincerely,
