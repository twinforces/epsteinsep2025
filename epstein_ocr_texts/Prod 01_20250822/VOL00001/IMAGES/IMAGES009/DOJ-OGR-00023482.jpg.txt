FROM: Colette 8. Peters, Director
SUBJECT: Response to the Office of Inspector General’s (OIG) Draft Report:

Investigation and Review of the Federal Bureau of Prisons’ Custody, Care,

and Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center

in New York, New York
The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) appreciates the opportunity to formally respond to the Office of the
Inspector General's (OIG) above-referenced draft report. BOP values OIG's careful review of the
facts and circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein and concurs with the
recommendations resulting from this engagement. The lessons learned during the course of this
engagement will be applied to the broader BOP correctional landscape.
The facts and circumstances related to those few BOP employees at MCC New York in this
report reflect a failure to follow BOP’s longstanding policies, regulations, and/or laws. While
this misconduct described in this report is troubling, those who took part in it represent a very
small percentage of the approximately 35,000 employees across more than 120 institutions who
continue to strive for correctional excellence every day.
In the Report, OIG makes recommendations to enhance BOP policies and practices and improve
accountability. In response to this and previous OIG and Government Accountability Office
(GAO) engagements, BOP has already begun to evaluate nationwide trends and strengthen
employee accountability.
