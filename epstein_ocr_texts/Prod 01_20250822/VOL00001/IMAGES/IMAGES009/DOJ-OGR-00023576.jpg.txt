Good afternoon all,
Below please find concerns raised by Epstein's attorneys with legal visiting. To summarize, they are
requesting:
1) greater access for Epstein using the bathroom during legal visits;
2) the 2 social calls he was allegedly promised; and
3) the ability to eat his lunch meal in attorney conference.
Please review and advise so that | can respond. Thank you.

Good morning
| tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last
Friday with OO Sand Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be
allowed to use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday,
Officer {SG told my client and | that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could
come or unless he sees a memo from Liutenant|[I0pr Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to
use the bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?
Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far,
no phone calls.
Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal
team and an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would
not be allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, heâ€™s been eating snacks from the vending machines
and no proper meal.
