PSYCHOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF INMATE DEATH

This is an interim report, due to an inability to gather all necessary data. Formal interviews were
not conducted as a part of this reconstruction to avoid interference with pending investigations
by other Department of Justice components. A copy of the video is normally made by Special
Investigative Staff following a significant incident, but there was no such video in this case since
the original video was confiscated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to the
beginning of this reconstruction. The absence of these two sources of information severely
limited the ability to establish accurate timelines, confirm subjective reports, establish
converging and diverging lines of facts, or discover new areas of inquiry. As a result,
information typically gathered, reviewed and consolidated during a reconstruction to support
actionable findings and recommendations is limited.
