This can be accomplished by placing the empty bottle on the daily
pill line cart that comes around to each housing unit at least
once a day. If medical staff feel that an inmate should not be
in possession of certain medications they need (certain
psychiatric medications), the inmate will be administered the
medication by pharmacy during daily pill line.
4. Independent Medical Examinations (IME)
If an attorney seeks a court order for an IME, the following
information must be included:
(1) Inmate’s name and register number;
(2) A court order or similar court signea document for the
examination;
(3) A provision for time and date to be determined by all
affected parties;
(4) Expected length of examination;
{5) Name, title, and organization of each person attending
(all-non attorneys and non-legal representatives will
have to fill out an application so MCC can complete a
background check (See Attachment B);
(6) List of all equipment to be used; and
(7) An indication of whether the inmate’s consent has been
obtained.
All of the above should be faxed to the Legal Department who will
make arrangements with the medical department for a convenient
time and date. The physician entering will be subject to using
the equipment available at MCC New York. The physician will also
have to complete Attachment B.
5, Visits with Inmates in Local Hospital
All USMS inmates (inmates who have not yet been sentenced) will
be referred to the USMS for visiting, whether legal or social.
I. Special Housing Unit (SHU)
MCC New York has a SHU to house inmates separate from the general
population. The SHU consists of two categories of cells:
administrative detention and disciplinary segregation.
Disciplinary Segregation Status. A form of separation from the
general population in which inmates who commit serious violations
of Bureau rules are confined by the Discipline Hearing Officer,
for specified periods of time, in a cell removed from the general
population. The DHO imposes the sanction of disciplinary
segregation upon determining that no other available disposition
will adequately achieve the purpose of punishment and deterrence
necessary to regulate an inmate's behavior within acceptable
limits.
