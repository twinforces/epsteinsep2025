4. Suicide Response
Recognizing that failure to appropriately respond to an emergency can jeopardize the safety of staff and
inmates and the security of the institution, the BOP’s Standards of Employee Conduct require that
“employees respond immediately, effectively, and appropriately during all emergency situations.” The MCC
New York General Housing Unit Post Orders outline the required response to a suspected inmate suicide.
These orders require that MCC New York staff notify the Operations Lieutenant and Control Center of the
situation. The orders further provide that, once there is adequate staff present, immediate action must be
taken to open the inmate's airway and initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, even if MCC New York staff
believe that the inmate “has been dead for a period of time.” MCC New York staff are to continue
cardiopulmonary resuscitation until they are relieved by medical staff or another rescuer. The BOP policy
governing crime scenes and the collection of evidence provides that the need to immediately attend to an
apparent suicide victim, undertake lifesaving measures, and ensure inmate and staff safety take precedence
over efforts to preserve a crime scene."?
5. Inmate Discipline
Federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 541.1-541.8, and BOP policy (Program Statement 5270.09, Inmate Discipline
Program) establish an inmate discipline program, which is designed to ensure the safety, security, and
orderly operation of correctional facilities, as well as the protection of the public. The inmate discipline
program applies to all inmates in BOP custody, including inmates with pending criminal charges. One of the
guiding principles of this program is that BOP staff are to take disciplinary action when and to such a degree
as necessary to regulate the behavior of inmates to promote a safe and orderly institution. “Tattooing or
self-mutilation” is among the prohibited acts sanctioned through the inmate discipline program. This
prohibited act falls within the second most severe category of offenses on a 4-tier scale. The BOP defines
“tattooing or self-mutilation” as “[t]o put indelible patterns on the skin; to injure, disfigure or make imperfect
by removing or irreparably damaging parts of the body (wrist cutting falls within this offense).”"* The
definition does not make an explicit reference to suicide attempts other than inclusion of “wrist cutting.”
Among other things, BOP policy addressing the inmate discipline program identifies the prohibited acts,
describes the process for adjudicating violations, and lists applicable penalties for each category of offense.
As relevant to this matter, the discipline process begins when a staff member observes an inmate commit a
prohibited act and issues a report documenting the incident. A BOP supervisor then investigates the alleged
inmate misconduct, which includes taking a statement from the inmate regarding the incident. If an inmate
appears to be mentally ill at any stage of the disciplinary process, a mental health staff member will
examine the inmate and assess the inmate’s competency to participate in the disciplinary process. If the
inmate is found to be competent and the prohibited act falls into the first or second most severe category,
the matter is referred to a discipline hearing officer, who will hold a hearing and make a determination as to
whether the inmate committed the prohibited act and, if so, impose any of the sanctions that correspond to
the severity of the prohibited act. At the hearing, the inmate is advised of his or her rights and permitted to
