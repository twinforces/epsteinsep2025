My boss, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw, sent a formal request to Governor Ron DeSantis
to have the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE) to assume the
lead role in the administrative review-criminal investigation while Mr. Epstein
was under the care and control of the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office,
copies of those requests are attached.
| met with part of the FDLE investigative team yesterday and turned over to
them the start of our investigation.
Below you will find the POC from FDLE and with your permission I'd like to
forward your contact information to him if he would need to contact your
office. __
