| just got off the phone with Central Office and they are recommending we conduct a suicide risk assessment
with this inmate when he returns from court. Should he return from court and psychology is gone for the
day, he is to go on PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSERVATION unless, of course, he reports he is suicidal. In that case,
he is to go on Suicide Watch. Inmate Epstein will likely be receiving bad news in court today and has
multiple risk factors for suicidality as identified by BOP statistics. Let's be proactive.
"This writer consulted a Office, regarding inmate Epstein. Inmate Epstein has
various risk factors for suicidality including a high profile case with media attention, sex offense charges, pre-
trial status, and a court proceeding today which could potentially be giving him bad news regarding his legal
situation. As such, when inmate Epstein returns from court, R&D staff as well as Lieutenant's have been
informed to immediately notify the psychology department. If he returns after duty hours, the
aforementioned staff were instructed to notify the on-call psychologist and to place inmate Epstein ona
watch status until psychology can conduct a thorough suicide risk assessment."
