City of New York other inmates complain that they were not issued the same
number of items. The Captain stated that it is also a security
issue because it “gives the inmates the materials to be able to make homemade fashioned and improvised
nooses” or “use it as escape paraphernalia,” such as a rope that inmates had used to escape from another
facility in Chicago.
Inmate 3 told the OIG that Epstein was allowed to sleep on the floor, which he said was unusual for the SHU
where that was not normally allowed. Inmate 3 said Epstein also had two extra blankets, which no other
inmate had, as well as two pens, which inmates were not allowed to have. Epstein would ask for things, and
if the COs said no, Epstein would tell them he was writing down their name and providing the information to
his lawyer. According to Inmate 3, the COs were on “eggshells” around Epstein. Inmate 3 said that when he
left the SHU on August 9, 2019, there was an orange cloth twisted around the ladder, strings on the side of
the ladder, and a string tied across the bed. Inmate 3 explained that the string tied across the bed served as
a clothesline, and that the strings were part of a sheet they had ripped. According to Inmate 3, one night he
woke up, saw Epstein fidgeting with the clothesline, and asked Epstein what he was doing. Epstein said he
was trying to fix the clothesline, but Inmate 3 told him no and flushed the clothesline down the toilet. As
discussed in Chapter 4, when Inmate 3 and Epstein first became cellmates upon Epstein’s return to the SHU
