conference from 8 9 19to8 8 19.PDF
Do you mind calling attorney conference in the morning and reminding them to hold room 3 open for 10:00
AM? PROPOR PME POO PPG and Epstein will likely have an attorney visit, but we need room 3
open for this hearing. If they have to keep Room 3 closed from 8:00 to 10:00 to ensure it is available, then
that's what we have to do. DO this is
an federal civil case out of SDNY so we should accommodate.)
Thanks!!
