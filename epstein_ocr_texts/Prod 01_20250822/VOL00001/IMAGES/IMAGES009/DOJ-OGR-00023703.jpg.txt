Hi
Thank you for letting me know and for your response.
| was informed by QMO that he had submitted my completed application to the legal
department for the inmate Jeffrey Epstein yesterday morning. Does this reflect any of your records? If not, |
will be happy to resubmit. If so, can | send the application to you directly via email? Please let me know.
Thanks again,
