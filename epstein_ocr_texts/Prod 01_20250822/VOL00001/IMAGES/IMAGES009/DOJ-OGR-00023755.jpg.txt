3 Emergency Telephone Calls
Inmates requiring an emergency social phone call due to 4a death
or serious illness of an immediate family member shall submit a
request to the Religious Services Department. Likewise, if an
individual needs to contact an inmate for these reasons, they
should call the main number and ask to speak to the Religious
Services Department.
C. Legal Mail
All legal mail must be addressed to the inmate. All mail
addressed to staff on behalf of an inmate will be returned to
sender. Inmates may not receive documents via facsimile.

1. Legal Mail Envelopes:
The Bureau has established procedures by which an inmate may
receive confidential legal mail. See 28 C.F.R. § 540.18; and
Bureau of Prisons Program Statement 5800.10, Mail Management
Manual (“PS 5800.10"). The Code of Federal Regulations provides
that special mail, which may only be opened in the presence of
the inmate, will be treated as such “if the sender is adequately
identified on the envelope, and the front of the envelope is
marked ‘Special Mail - Open only in the presence of the
inmate.’" 28 C.F.R. § 540.18(a). However, the presence of a
return address with a firm name does not suffacientiy adentify
the sender of the material as an attorney.

Specifically, the attorney must be adequately

identified on the envelope as an attorney . . . The

use of the titie "Esquire" without additional

indication of the sender's occupation does not

establish the bearer as an attorney or legal aid

supervisor. Mail from individuals using the title

"Esquire" as the exclusive identification of their

status shall not be handled as special mail, even if

the envelope contains some special mail markings.
P.S. 5800.16, Ch. 3, p.5. To maintain consistent handiing of
legal mail, strict compliance with these procedures wiil be
enforced by MCC New York mail room staff. To properly identify
legai mail, counsel must write their name (not just the firm's
name) and their legal status (i.e., attorney), in the return
address portion of the envelope. This information, in addition
to writing elsewhere on the envelope “Special Mail —- Open oniy
in presence of inmate,” will ensure that legal mail is treated
as confidential attorney-client communication.
