13. Sex Offense Risk Factors
Psychologists are subject matter experts in sex offender risk factors and they play a crucial role in sharing this
knowledge through traditional settings such as ICT, AT, and institutional meetings. However, Executive Staff
play a pivotal role in establishing and addressing institutional culture and promoting and participating in
training. A lack of a broad understanding of sex offender specific risk factors requires an intentional training
approach led by Executive Staff. They must be out front talking about inmates with a sex offense, expressing an
understanding of sex offender dynamics, modeling agency condoned expectations for the understanding and
treatment of inmates with a sex offenses, and assisting with institutional trainings. These practices encourage a
broader acceptance by line staff.
