“A Message from the Inspector General:: Investigation and Review on the BOP’s Custody, Care, and
Supervision of Jeffrey Epstein at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, New York;” June
2023

Hello, I'm Michael Horowitz, Inspector General forthe U.S. Départment of Jtistice.

Today my office released a report on the Federal Bureau.of Prisons, or BOP’s, custody, care, andsupervision
of inmate'Jeffrey Epstein at the MCC New York. On August: 10, 2019, Epstein was found hanged | in. his locked
cell within the prison’s secure Special Housing Unit. The, New York City's Office of the Chief Medical
Examiner determined that Epstein:died by suicide.

Today's report follows numerous other OIG reports; unrelated to Epstein, that have repeatedly identified
long-standing operational challenges at the BOP that négatively affect its ability to operate institutions safely
and securely. Today's report identified many. of these same operational challenges, including significant job
performance and management failures:on the part of BOP personnel; widespread disregard. of BOP policies;
and deficiericies with the BOP’s staffirig levels; sectirity camera systems; and .cUstody and care of irimates at
risk for:suicide.

For example, we determined that MCC. New York staff failed to ensure Epstein was-assigned a cellmate as
instructed by MCG New York's Psychology Department following an incident on July 23" where Epstein was
found unresponsive in his cell with a:cloth wrapped around his neck. In addition, we, concluded that: MCG
New York staff failed to undertake required measures designed to ensure Epstein and other inmates were
accounted for ‘and safe in their cells, such as inmate: counts and rounds; and searches of célls: Had Epstein's:
cell been searchéd as required, it'would have revéaled that Epstein had @xcess prison blankets, linens, and
clothing if his cell. MCC New York staff'also failed to.enstire that the institution's sectirity camera system
was fully functional, resulting in limited recorded video evidence.

While we determined MCC. New York staff engaged in significant misconduct, we did not uncover evidence
contradicting the FBI's: determination that there was no criminality in‘connection-with how Epstein ‘died.

The combination of negligence, misconduct, and outrightjob performance failures.documented in today’s
report all-contributed to an environment in which arguably one ofthe most notorious inmates in BOP’s,
custody was left:unmonitored and. alone in his cell with.an excess of prison linens, thereby providing him
with: the opportunity to‘take his‘own life. ‘The BOP’s failures are troubling not only because the BOP did not
adéquatély safeguard ‘an individual in its custody, but also because they led to questions about the
circumstancés stirrounding Epstein’s déath and éffectively deprived Epstein's numerousVictims of the
opportunity to seek justice through the criminal justice system.

The fact that these chronic problems and failures:have been recurring:ones:does notexcuse them, and
gives additional urgency to the need for DO) and BOP leadership'to address'them.
