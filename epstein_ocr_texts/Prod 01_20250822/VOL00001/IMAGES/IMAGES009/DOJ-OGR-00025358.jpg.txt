Institution:
As an inmate charged with a violation of Bureau of Prisons rules or regulations referred
to the Discipline Hearing Officer (DHO) for disposition, you have the following rights:
1. The right to have a written copy of the charge(s) against you at least 24
hours prior to appearing before the Discipline Hearing Officer;
2. The right to have a full-time member of the staff who is reasonably available
to represent you before the Discipline Hearing Officer;
3. The right to call witnesses (or present written statements of unavailable
witnesses) and to present documentary evidence in your behalf, provided
institutional safety would not be jeopardized;
4. The right to present a statement or to remain silent. Your silence may be
used to draw an adverse inference against you. However, your silence alone may
not be used to support a finding that you committed a prohibited act;
5. The right to be present throughout the discipline hearing except during a
period of deliberation or when institutional safety would be jeopardized. If
you elect not to appear before the DHO, you may still have witnesses anda staff
representative appear on your behalf;
6. The right to be advised of the DHO’s decision, the facts supporting that
decision, except where institutional safety would be jeopardized, and the DHO’s
disposition in writing; and,
7. The right to appeal the decision of the DHO by means of the Administrative
Remedy Procedure to the Regional Director within 20 calendar days of notice
of the DHO’s decision and disposition.
I hereby acknowledge that I have been advised of the above rights afforded me at a
hearing before the Discipline Hearing Officer. I have further been advised that if
I have previously received either a presumptive or effective parole date from the
Parole Commission, a finding by the DHO that I committed the prohibited act(s) may
result in a rescission or retardation by the Parole Commission of the presumptive
or effective parole date.
