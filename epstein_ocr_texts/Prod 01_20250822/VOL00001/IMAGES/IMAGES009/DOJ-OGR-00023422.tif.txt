The Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant both told the OIG that they
did not know Inmate 3 had been transferred out of the facility, despite the fact that both were recipients of
the second email the USMS sent on August 8 that included the information about Inmate 3's impending
transfer out of MCC New York on August 9. Rather, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant and the Day
Watch Activities Lieutenant told the OIG that they believed Inmate 3 had been removed from MCC New York
for a court appearance.
The Day Watch Activities Lieutenant did not recall Inmate 3 departing the institution with all of his
belongings or having any conversations with the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge or anyone else regarding
Inmate 3’s departure from MCC New York. According to the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, he did not
know that Epstein was without a cellmate. Other senior officials, including the Warden, Associate Warden 1,
and the Captain, were also unaware of Inmate 3’s transfer and the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.
These officials concurred that while all SHU staff and supervisors were responsible for notifying a supervisor
in the chain-of-command of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge
bore primary responsibility for the notification because he was the SHU Officer in Charge and one of two
people who saw Inmate 3 leave the facility with all of his belongings. The Captain told the OIG that since
Epstein was in the attorney conference room all day, no one may have even thought about it, and may have
only become aware when they put Epstein back in his cell after his attorney visit that evening. The Captain
said as soon as the SHU staff became aware that Epstein was without a cellmate, they should have notified
the Evening Watch Operations Lieutenant. The Captain said that if he had been informed, he would have
taken immediate action to ensure that Epstein was either assigned a new cellmate or monitored until that
assignment occurred. The Captain, however, was one of the recipients of the USMS August 8 email that
notified members of MCC New York supervisory staff of Inmate 3's transfer to another facility. The Warden
and Associate Warden 1 did not receive this email.
The Warden told the OIG that he was off duty on August 9, 2019. The Warden said that in the event Epstein
was without a cellmate, the plan was to review the situation and decide who should replace Inmate 3, but
that no inmate in the SHU was preselected to replace Inmate 3 if this event occurred.
2. Evening Watch Staff Actions on August 9
The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he was the SHU Officer in Charge on August 9
from approximately 2 p.m. until 10 p.m. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he relieved the Day
Watch SHU Officer in Charge from his duties and worked in the SHU with Senior Officer Specialist 5, a
Material Handler, CO 2, and CO Tova Noel. The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated that when he
began his shift, Epstein was visiting with his attorneys in the attorney conference room. The Evening Watch
SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he did not recall having a conversation with the Day Watch SHU
Officer in Charge about Epstein needing a cellmate. When advised that the Day Watch SHU Officer in
Charge was confident about their conversation, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge stated, “I don’t
necessarily want to call anyone a liar[] per se, but | don’t remember him speaking to me about this. So,
maybe he spoke to [Senior Officer Specialist 5], and maybe | was standing there, and he thought | heard
him.” The Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge said if Inmate 3 had left MCC New York with all of his
belongings, then someone should have found another inmate to replace him because Epstein was required
to have a cellmate.
