Good morning,
Reaching out in response to reports that Jeffrey Epstein, being held at Metropolitan Correctional
Center in Manhattan, was found injured in his cell after a possible suicide attempt, allegedly semi-
conscious with marks on his neck.
Can you provide a statement in response to these reports and clarify what happened? Is there a
possibility that Epstein will be transferred to another facility?
Feel free to give us a call at 718-8610
Thank you.
Best,
Assignment a
