Good afternoon all,
Below please find complaints from Epstein's attorneys. Can you check to see if he has toilet

Good afternoon Mr XO OHXCH]
Our client, Jeffrey Epstein, has informed us that he has no toilet paper in his cell. His CPap
machine was not plugged in last night, so he was unable to use it.
Also, since his arrival at MCC, he has only been able to make two fifteen minute phone calls.
Both times, the calls were on speaker phone, with officers present.
