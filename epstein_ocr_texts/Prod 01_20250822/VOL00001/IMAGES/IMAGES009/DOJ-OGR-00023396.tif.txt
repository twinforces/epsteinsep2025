IV. Events of July 23 and the Placement of Epstein on Suicide Watch and
Psychological Observation from July 23 to July 30
According to BOP documents, at approximately 1:27 a.m. on July 23, 2019, Senior Officer Specialists 1 and 2
heard noise coming from the M Tier in the SHU, the tier where Epstein was housed. Senior Officer
Specialist 2 documented in a BOP report that upon checking cell Z05-124, he saw Epstein laying down near
his bunk with “a piece of handmade orange cloth” around his neck, and Senior Officer Specialist 1 wrote in a
BOP report that Epstein’s cellmate (Inmate 1) said Epstein had attempted to hang himself. In his interview
with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 1 said that Inmate 1, who appeared shaken up, told him that he had
been asleep on the floor of the cell and was awoken when he felt Epstein land on him. Senior Officer
Specialist 2 reported that after he had been alerted by the noise, he grabbed the door keys, called the
Control Center for assistance, and then he and Senior Officer Specialist 1 entered the cell, where they
secured and removed Epstein’s cellmate. Senior Officer Specialist 1 reported that he then reentered the
cell, placed Epstein on his side, and removed “an orange homemade rope” from his neck. In his interview
with the OIG, Senior Officer Specialist 1 said Epstein had a sheet around his neck, which was attached to the
bunkbed ladder in the cell. Senior Officer Specialist 1 said that Epstein was sitting on the floor of the cell
with his back against the bunkbed ladder. Senior Officer Specialist 1's report said that Epstein was
breathing, but unresponsive, so he began chest compressions, at which time the Morning Watch Operations
Lieutenant and other staff arrived. Senior Officer Specialist 1 confirmed in his OIG interview that they
started cardiopulmonary resuscitation but stopped when they realized that Epstein was already breathing.
The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant documented in a BOP report that when she arrived at the SHU,
she saw Epstein lying in the fetal position in his cell, breathing heavily and snoring, wearing only a t-shirt and
boxers. The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant observed that Epstein’s neck was red, but she saw no
further injuries. She called out to Epstein, who flickered his eyes and continued snoring. The COs
unsuccessfully tried to get Epstein to stand on his own, and then placed him on a stretcher and took him to
the Health Services Unit.
According to BOP records, at approximately 1:40 a.m., Epstein was transferred out of the SHU and placed on
suicide watch. As previously noted in Chapter 2, inmates on suicide watch are housed in a dedicated room,
typically in the health services area, where they are continuously monitored by specially trained staff
or inmates.
Senior Officer Specialist 3 documented in a BOP report that when he and others responded to the call for
assistance and gained access to the SHU, he saw Epstein lying on the floor of his cell snoring. He and the
other officers verbally instructed Epstein to stand up, but Epstein did not. He and other officers then lifted
Epstein onto a stretcher to remove him from the cell.
Senior Officer Specialist 4 wrote in a BOP report that he responded to a body alarm in the SHU and helped
remove Epstein from his cell, placed him on a stretcher, and took him to the second floor for a medical
assessment. Senior Officer Specialist 4 further reported that, while he was observing Epstein in the Health
Services Unit, Epstein told Senior Officer Specialist 4 that he thought his cellmate had tried to kill him.
Epstein further stated that his cellmate had tried to extort him and that for the last week his cellmate had
threatened to beat him if he did not pay him. Epstein told Senior Officer Specialist 4 he had not reported
this to MCC New York staff, but that he had told his lawyers.
