I’ll call you separately in a moment, but just in case email is faster, | just received a phone call from
defense counsel that a person close to Mr. Epstein received a phone call from an individual named

fsreircy phonetic) who claimed to be an investigator with the MCC and told the individual that
Mr. Epstein’s body was ready to be picked up at the hospital and that the individual could make
arrangements for retrieval of the body >°).,__ left his phone number as 646-83¢P° 7]
Can you please confirm whether that individual is in fact with BOP and/or MCC? Defense counsel is
understandably concerned that they (and others with connections with Mr. Epstein) are starting to get
hoax or otherwise inaccurate information through phone calls and emails. And we would again
respectfully but urgently request that if there is information like this that needs to go to
representatives for Mr. Epstein, that it come to us so we can pass it along to his counsel with
confidence that it is true and accurate.
(Separately, if it is accurate that BOP / MCC is prepared to release Mr. Epstein’s body, his defense
counsel is extremely concerned about whether that has been enough time for a full autopsy and any
other investigative steps, and we would want to confirm that the FBI team addressing this matter has
also been informed—but that’s only if this is not a hoax, obviously.)
Please advise as soon as possible, as the individual is waiting to know whether they should take steps
to retrieve the body.

thank you,
