Good morning Mr

I tried calling you earlier. My client, Jeffrey Epstein (76318-054) informed me that he had a meeting last Friday with

OOK han Mr. Pluorde, where Mr. Pluorde told our client that he would be allowed to
use the bathroom once every hour on the third floor when meeting his attorneys. Yesterday, Officer Pe. |
told my client and I that he would not be allowed to use the bathroom unless a Liutenant could come or
unless he sees a memo from Liutenant [Mr Mr. Pluorde allowing the staff to allow our client to use the
bathroom. Can Mr. Pluorde or anyone else make this memo available?

Our client also informed us that in that meeting he was told that he was going to have 2 phone calls. So far, no phone
calls.

Also, can he be allowed to eat in the client attorney room? He spends all of the day meeting with his legal team and
an officer told him that if he wanted to eat, he would have to go back to 9south and then he would not be
allowed back downstairs. So for the last few days, he’s been eating snacks from the vending machines and no
proper meal.
