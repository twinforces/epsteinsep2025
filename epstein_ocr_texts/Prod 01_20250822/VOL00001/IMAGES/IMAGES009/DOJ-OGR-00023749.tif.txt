opening of the box. Larger packages may be broken down into
several smalier envelopes. These boxes are emptied Monday-
Friday, excluding federal holidays, and the contents are
processed with other mail received from the post office that
day. Envelopes must be ciearly marked with the attorney’s name
(including language that identifies that person as an attorney),
inmate’s name and register number and the following statement:
“SPECIAL MAIL-OPEN ONLY IN THE PRESENCE OF THE INMATE.” See
below, page 12. Unauthorized items found in the inmate’s
possession will be treated as contraband.
Tape Players, VCRs & Computers to Review Discovery Material
Due to security concerns, attorneys may not bring electronic
eguipment into the secure confines of the institution. However,
MCC New York has tape players, VCRs and televisions for
attorneys to review discovery materials with clients in visiting
rooms. These items are available on a first come, first served
basis by oral request to the visiting room officer.
MCC New York also has a computer that attorneys may use to
review computer CDs with their clients. The computer is
available during attorney visiting hours and should be reserved
at least 24 hours in advance by calling the Legal Department.
Attorneys who make an appointment to use the computer will have
preference over those who do not make an appointment. Attorneys
should bring a copy of the CD discovery when meeting with an
inmate.
Audio and video cassettes and CDs may also be mailed directly to
an inmate via the legal mail procedures explained below in the
Legal Mail section, Cl. Inmates may review their DVD and CD-Rom
discovery material as described in the Law Library Section, El.
5. Private Conference Rooms
These rooms are available on a first come, first served basis.
There are twelve conference rooms in the building. Institutioral
security and fire safety requiations restrict the total number
of people that may be in the visiting room at any one time.
Ultimately, it is a correctional decision where any visit will
take place.
6. Multipie Client Visits
Attorneys are not limited in the number of inmates they may
Visit in one day. However, only one inmate may be brought down
to the visiting room at any time. Please see below in
Separation/Codefendant Meeting Section 11 for instruction on Co-
Defendant Meetings. When an attorney has finashed the legal
visit and the inmate has been sent back to the unit, another
inmate may be brought down to the visiting room.
