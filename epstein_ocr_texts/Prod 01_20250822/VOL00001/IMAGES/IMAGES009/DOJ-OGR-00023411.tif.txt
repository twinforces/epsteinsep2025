scheduled to be seen again the following week. The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that Epstein and his
attorney mocked her for thinking Epstein was suicidal.*®
On July 16, 2019, at Epstein’s request, the Chief Psychologist met with Epstein during his attorney
conference. The Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein did not have any psychological concerns and denied
suicidality. The Chief Psychologist noted that she provided Epstein with psychoeducation regarding
additional coping strategies. Epstein was educated about routine and emergency procedures to contact
Psychology Department staff and reminded of self-help books and audiotapes that are available to him. The
Chief Psychologist noted in her clinical contact report that there was no need for follow-up and that Epstein
would be seen in the SHU for rounds and monthly SHU reviews.
According to the BOP After Action Review submitted by the Southeast Regional Director, the Chief
Psychologist’s meeting with Epstein on July 16, 2019, at Epstein’s request during his attorney conference was
inappropriate. The Southeast Regional Director wrote in the report that Epstein attempted to “bring his
attorneys into the fray regarding the mental health treatment being provided by the institution.” In the
After Action Review, the Southeast Regional Director wrote that it was not typical for the BOP to provide
psychological intervention in the presence of others, nor was it appropriate for a BOP psychologist to meet
with an inmate’s attorney. When asked by the OIG about these findings, the Chief Psychologist stated that
the intention was to check on Epstein, not to breach any security.
On July 18, 2019, the Chief Psychologist conducted a monthly SHU review and noted that Epstein was
unavailable due to a meeting with his legal team and that she would attempt to interview Epstein in the near
future to complete his monthly review.
As noted previously, at approximately 1:27 a.m. on July 23, 2019, Epstein was found lying on the floor of his
cell with a piece of homemade orange cloth around his neck. The Chief Psychologist made a general
administrative note in Epstein’s file that she was contacted by the Operations Lieutenant at approximately
2 a.m., and informed that Epstein was being placed on suicide watch after he was found with a string loosely
hanging around his neck. That morning, Physician Assistant 1 assessed Epstein for injuries and noted in
BOP records that Epstein was cooperative, alert, and oriented. According to BOP’s medical records, Epstein
did not appear distressed and was smiling during the clinical assessment. Epstein said he did not know
what had happened and could not explain the mark on his neck. Physician Assistant 1 noted that Epstein
had a circular line of erythema, i.e., superficial redness on the skin, that was 2 inches wide and spanned two-
thirds of the way around the front and sides of the base of his neck. According to the BOP report, one
section of the erythema (or redness) in the front of his neck had marks of friction, and there was no
inflammation, deformities, hematomas, lacerations, or tenderness. The BOP report stated that Epstein was
able to move his neck without any restriction and denied having any pain, discomfort, or respiratory
problems. Physician Assistant 1 further noted there was another small erythema (or redness) on Epstein’s
left knee about 2 centimeters in diameter, which was noted as mild. Physician Assistant 1’s assessment was
that the injury was unspecified and was self-inflicted.
78 Upon reviewing a draft of this report, the Chief Psychologist noted that Epstein’s attorneys were not “mocking” her;
the attorneys and Epstein were simply laughing at the fact that she was inquiring as to whether Epstein was suicidal and
dismissing the possibility that Epstein could be suicidal.
