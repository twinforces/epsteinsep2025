If complaining about a sensitive issue, in the sense that the
inmate’s safety or well-being would be placed in danger if the
request became known at the institution, the inmate may submit
his administrative remedy directly to the appropriate Regional
Director, marking “Sensitive” upon the request and explaining, in
writing, the reason for not submitting the request at the
institution. See Program Statement 1330.13, Sec.8{d) (1),
Administrative Remedy Program. If the Regional Administrative
Remedy Coordinator agrees that the request is sensitive, the
request shall be accepted, investigated, and responded to.
Otherwise, the request will not be accepted, and the inmate will
be advised in writing of that determination, without return of
the request. The inmate may then pursue the matter by submitting
a request for Administrative Remedy locally to the Warden. The
Warden shall allow a reasonable extension of time for such a
resubmission. See 28 C.F.R. $542.17.
Special procedures regarding the appeal of Disciplinary Hearing
Officer (DHO) actions may be found at 28 C.F.R. §542.14(d) (2).
Appeals from DHG actions shall be submitted initially to the
Regional Director for the region where the inmate is currently
located.
G. Inmate Designations
The majority of inmates at MCC New York are pre-trial inmates
who, if sentenced, will serve their sentence in another
institution. However, an inmate is not transported to a new
institution immediately upon sentencing. The sentencing court
must first provide to the USMS the final presentence
investigation report and a signed judgement ana commitment order.
The USMS must then forward these documents along with a request
for designation to the Designation and Sentence Computation
Center (DSCC), located in Grand Prairie, Texas. When designating
an institution for an inmate to serve a sentence, the Bureau
considers many factors, including but not limited to, the
security level of the inmate, medical or psychiatric concerns and
judicial recommendations. Once an institution has been
designated, the inmate will be transported on the next bus or
airlift on which space is available. This entire process often
takes several weeks to complete. Contact information for DSCC is
as follows:
