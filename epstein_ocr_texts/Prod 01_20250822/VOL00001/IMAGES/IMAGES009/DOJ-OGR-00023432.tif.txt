Senior Officer Specialist 6 did not recall if he wrote on the count slips at the time of the 10 p.m. count or
during the 12 a.m. count when Inmate 4 was transferred in SENTRY from the SHU to Receiving and
Discharge. Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that if he had made the notations at the time of the
10 p.m. count, he should not have cleared the count. Instead, he should have created a new master count
sheet and requested that the SHU staff conduct a new count, provide a new count slip, and discard the
inaccurate SHU count slip. Senior Officer Specialist 6 told the OIG that an Operations Lieutenant would have
needed to authorize him to do the “ghost count” and write on the count slips, although he could not recall
precisely who gave him the authorization or when he had done so. The OIG investigation and review
determined that the only Operations Lieutenant on duty at the time was the Morning Watch Operations
Lieutenant, who started her shift at 10 p.m. on August 9. When questioned by the OIG, the Morning Watch
Operations Lieutenant adamantly denied having authorized a “ghost count” and the OIG identified no
record or witness (other than Senior Officer Specialist 6) to indicate that she had done so. The OIG
interviewed other MCC New York personnel, who said “ghost counting” was not permitted, and stressed the
importance of an accurate physical count of inmates.
3. The 12a.m.,3a.m., and 5 a.m. SHU Counts on August 10
The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant told the OIG that she supervised the August 10 12 a.m.
institutional count from the Control Center. During the count, the Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant
said she identified the issue with the inaccuracy of the SHU count slip because it counted Inmate 4 as
present in the SHU, when in actuality he had been removed from the SHU and placed in the Receiving and
Discharge dry cell the previous day (August 9, 2019). The Morning Watch Operations Lieutenant said that
after learning of the discrepancy, she made the appropriate update reflecting the inmate transfer in
SENTRY. This update is reflected in Inmate 4’s Inmate History Quarters, which states that Inmate 4 was
transferred out of the SHU into a different housing unit on August 10, 2019, at 12:35 a.m. The Morning
