Hi—

SSM from the Washington Post here. We are in the process of working on a story about the cameras outside Jeffrey
Epstein’s cell on the morning of his death. The story will assert that the data in those cameras was found to be
corrupted/unreadable, though it is being sent to Quantico for further analysis.

Can the BOP comment on that assertion? Is the functionality of cameras a larger issue at BOP or MCC? Are you able to say what
other cameras might have captured that night to support the assertion that Mr. Epstein killed himself?
Thank you,
