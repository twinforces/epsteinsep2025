No worries. Thank you for the update.
Just to clarify, this means that until my application is cleared I will be unable to visit Mr. Epstein, correct?

Attached starting at p. 26, please find the application and NCIC check form. Paralegals must submit new applications yearly to
retain legal visiting privileges. Please be advised, our records reflected that your last application expired in September 2018.
Please complete the attached and return them for processing at your earliest convenience.
Thank you,

Hello
| left you a voicemail earlier today regarding my paralegal application for Jeffrey Epstein, Reg. #76318-054. | was told today by
the lobby guards that | had to re-submit my application and to ask the legal department directly on the reasoning. | wanted to
reach out to ask what in my application needed to be changed or fixed so that | do not repeat the mistake.
| really appreciate your help.
Thank you,
