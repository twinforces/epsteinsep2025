Hugh,
1. The attached spreadsheet has three tabs with counts on Attempts, Self Harm and Placement on Suicide
Watch for all of our institutions between 2014-2018 and it was shared with IPPA.
2. This is a reporter's question sent to IPPA along with our response and my recommendation for adding
more information.
(4) Also, does BOP have any special initiatives under way to help reduce the numbers? What is BOPâ€™s
response to the union's contention is staffing shortages Is at the root of the problem?
