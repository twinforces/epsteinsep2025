resulted in Epstein being housed without a cellmate at the time of his death, which was contrary to the
Psychology Department's directive issued just 10 days earlier.
BOP standards of conduct require that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”©' MCC
New York Post Orders for the SHU require, among other things, that all SHU officers “maintain a log of
pertinent information regarding inmate activity, detailing time, persons involved (if pertinent) and the event,
which must be logged into TRUSCOPE.”® Importantly, the SHU Post Orders clarify that they “are not
intended to describe in detail all the officer's responsibilities. Good judgment and common sense are
expected in all situations not covered in these post orders.”
On August 9, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, and CO
Tova Noel were each assigned to the MCC New York SHU as their permanent quarterly assigned post and
served as the SHU Officer in Charge during their respective shifts. The OIG investigation found that each
of these employees knew that Epstein was required to have a cellmate at all times per the Psychology
Department's directive.
The OIG further found that on August 9 the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, the Evening Watch SHU
Officer in Charge, and Noel each became aware at various times during their respective shifts that Epstein’s
cellmate, Inmate 3, had been transferred from the institution with all of his belongings, a status known to all
MCC New York staff members as meaning the inmate was being permanently transferred out of the
institution. Specifically, the OIG investigation found that on the morning of August 9, the Day Watch SHU
Officer in Charge and CO 1, who was also assigned to the SHU, reviewed the MCC New York daily call out list,
a document that identifies all inmates who were leaving their housing units each day, which listed Inmate 3
as being scheduled to depart MCC New York with all of his belongings. At approximately 8:30 a.m., CO 1
escorted Inmate 3 from the SHU to Receiving and Discharge to be transferred out of the institution, and the
Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge escorted Epstein from the SHU to the attorney conference room for his
daily meeting with his attorneys. During the escort, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge and CO 1
discussed the need to assign Epstein with a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s transfer. The Day Watch SHU
Officer in Charge told the OIG, and stated in a memorandum that he prepared following Epstein’s death,
that he notified his relief, the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge, of the need to assign Epstein a new
cellmate, and that he likely notified an unspecified Lieutenant. However, the OIG did not credit the Day
Watch SHU Officer in Charge’s account because no other witnesses or evidence confirmed that he had in
fact passed on information regarding Epstein’s need for a new cellmate, either to a supervisor or his relief.
6 BOP Program Statement 3420.11.
62 TRUSCOPE is a BOP database that provides institution staff with detailed inmate and institution security-related
information and provides unit officers an electronic event log.
& Noel served as the SHU Officer in Charge after the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge’s shift ended at 10 p.m. on
August 9, 2019.
6 Receiving and Discharge is the area of MCC New York that is responsible for processing inmates who enter or leave
the facility.
6 The OIG did not find that CO 1 failed to make appropriate notifications because his immediate superior in his chain-
of-command, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, was aware of the need to assign Epstein a new cellmate.
