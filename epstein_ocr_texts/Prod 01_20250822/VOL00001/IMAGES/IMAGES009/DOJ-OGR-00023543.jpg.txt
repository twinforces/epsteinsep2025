Hi—

(OTIVOMG from the Washington Post here. We are in the process of working on a story about the
cameras outside Jeffrey Epstein’s cell on the morning of his death. The story will assert that the data in
those cameras was found to be corrupted/unreadable, though it is being sent to Quantico for further
analysis.

Can the BOP comment on that assertion? Is the functionality of cameras a larger issue at BOP or MCC?

Are you able to say what other cameras might have captured that night to support the assertion that
Mr. Epstein killed himself?

Thank you,
