9. Attorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured following Mr. Epstein’s death.
Specifically, three Attorney Log Books located in the Attorney Visiting and Front Lobby
areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the Attorney Visiting area were not
secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after the
reconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.08 states, “In the event of a
suicide, institution staff, particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law
enforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same level of protection as any crime
scene in which a death has occurred.” This policy further states, “All possible evidence
and documentation will be preserved to provide data and support for subsequent
investigators doing a psychological reconstruction.”

Further, a review of the attorney log books identified many errors and signify a systemic
concern. For example, there were two concurrently open attorney log books in the
Attorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the two attorney log books, one
in the Attorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff
were unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the
reconstruction, some of the log books could not be accounted for. Within the log books,
entries were made out of chronological order, attorneys did not consistently sign in and
out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently
labeled, log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been
torn off of several books. At the current time, these log books are not functioning as an
adequate system of control and monitoring.

revealed that the list used for accountability and inspection purposes was inaccurate and
incomplete.
