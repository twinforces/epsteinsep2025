in an honest effort to perform official duties."° The ethical regulations also mandate that federal employees
not use federal property “for other than authorized activities.”
BOP policy (Program Statement 3420.11, Standards of Employee Conduct) imposes several additional
standards of conduct on its employees. At all times, BOP employees must “[c]onduct themselves in a
manner that fosters respect for the Bureau of Prisons, the Department of Justice, and the U.S. Government.”
Because “[i]nattention to duty in a correctional environment can result in escapes, assaults, and other
incidents,” BOP employees “are required to remain fully alert and attentive during duty hours.” BOP policy
provides that employees can use government property for authorized purposes only, and further specifies
that personal use of government office equipment, such as computers, “will not take place during official
working hours.” BOP policy requires that employees “obey the orders of their superiors at all times.”
B. False Statements and Lack of Candor
Under federal law, “whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive...branch of the
Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully... makes or uses any false writing or document
knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry” has violated
18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3). The terms “knowingly and willfully’ mean that the subject acted with knowledge that
the conduct was, in a general sense, prohibited by law. It is not required that the subject was aware of the
existence of Section 1001.
Under BOP standards of conduct discussed above, employees are required to cooperate fully with official
investigations, which includes providing “all pertinent information they may have” and “truthfully responding
to questions.”
c Relevant BOP Policies Regarding the Operation of Correctional Facilities
1. Special Housing Units
SHUs within BOP facilities are governed by federal regulations, 28 C.F.R. 88 541.21-541.33. These
regulations provide that the BOP may establish SHUs “where inmates are securely separated from the
general inmate population.” These regulations and BOP policy (Program Statement 5270.11, Special
Housing Units) explain that inmates in the SHU are either on administrative detention or disciplinary
segregation status. Administrative segregation status is a non-punitive designation that removes an inmate
“from the general population when necessary to ensure the safety, security, and orderly operation of
correctional facilities, or protect the public.” There are several reasons an inmate can be placed in
administrative detention status, including when an inmate's presence in the general inmate population
presents a threat to self or others, or when administrative detention status is necessary for the protection of
the inmate. Assignment to the SHU for protection reasons can be based on being a victim of an assault,
acting (or being perceived) as an informant, refusing to enter general population, or because of staff
concerns about the inmate's safety.
