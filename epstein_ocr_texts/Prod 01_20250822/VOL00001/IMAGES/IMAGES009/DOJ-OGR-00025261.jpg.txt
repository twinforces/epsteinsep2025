Here is the final version I'm sending fr You're welcome to send this to him or other reporters
as well who are asking for an update.
We considered using new language but we realized the language from our original response last week
(repeated below mostly) covers everything being asked - medical status and conditions of confinement
(which we interpret as including where he's housed within an institution).

Reporter:
Question (reporter emailed OPA & MCC NY):
Can you provide an update on inmate Jeffrey Edward Epstein, Register Number: 76318-054,
who is being held without bail at New York MCC?
Specifically, what is the status of the investigation into the injuries he sustained to his neck last
week, and where is he currently housed?
Please let me know asap.
Proposed Response:
Jeffrey Epstein is currently housed at MCC New York. As with all inmates, for privacy and security reasons, we
do not share information on an inmate's medical status or their conditions of confinement.
