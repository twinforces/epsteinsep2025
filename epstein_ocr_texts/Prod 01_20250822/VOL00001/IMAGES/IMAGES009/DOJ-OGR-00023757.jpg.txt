oi Court Clothing
Court clothing for trial can be delivered in one of two ways:
1) Prior to an individual bringing in clothes, it is the
inmate’s responsibility to submit an “Authorization to Receive A
Package or Property BP-331" to his Unit Counselor. This form
can be obtained from the inmate’s Unit Team. The Unit Counselor
will then deliver one copy of that form to the Receiving and
Discharge (R&D) Department. The inmate wili receive the other
copies of that form so that he may mail one to the individual
who will be dropping off the court clothes. The individual
bringing the clothing should call R&D staff in advance before
dropping off clothes. Once authorized, they must bring the copy
of the BP-331 form with the package and notify the lobby officer
who will contact a staff member from the R&D department. An R&D
staff member will then report to the lobby and accept the
clothing.
2) A court order can be obtained in lieu of the BP-331 form
mentioned above. A call to R&D in advance of dropping the
clothing must still be made. Inmates are allowed up to two sets
of trial clothes.

6. Mail for multiple defendants
If a case involves several co-defendants who will need to view
the same discovery material, the package/envelope of discovery
must be addressed te the Legal Department, as described above,
and the mailing must contain a cover letter indicating all
inmates and Register Numbers who are to have access to this
discovery material.
