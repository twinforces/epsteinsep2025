Good morning,
The Associated Press reached out to our Senior Attorney here at MCC New York inquiring if he is
representing Staff involved in this incident. We are not going to respond to this inquiry.
Thank you

Good afternoon! We understand two employees of the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan
are about to be charged re: lapses the night of Jeffrey Epstein’s death.
Are you representing either of them in the criminal matter? If not, who is? We’d like to reach out of
fairness and to ensure we are separating fact from rumors.
Any guidance/point in the right direction would be most appreciated.
