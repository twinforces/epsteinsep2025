the correct cell assignment noted. The Associate Warden, Programs, is notified if there are any inconsistencies.
Moreover, the four suicide watch cells now all have SENTRY Assignments of H0O1-001L â€”HO01-004L. Further,
Psychology Services Department reviews suicide watch log books on a daily basis to assess whether the Lieutenants
have conducted rounds during each shift and whether the Unit 2 Sallyport and Unit 2 Officers are conducting hourly
rounds. Any inconsistencies noted in the logbooks by Psychology staff will be reported immediately to the Captain
and the Associate Warden over Programs to address appropriately.
The Operations Lieutenant will physically check the PP30 Cell Assignment Roster when inmates are quartered on
suicide watch. The Lieutenant will ensure the Counts and Assignments (C&A) Officer keys cell assignments
correctly and annotate any errors in the daily log and contact the Captain immediately. Guidance was sent to the
Lieutenants regarding keying of suicide watch bed assignments after hours. The Lieutenants were instructed that
upon placing an inmate on suicide watch, they are responsible for contacting C&A and providing the cell
assignment. Additionally, the Lieutenant will run a PP30 with the selection category for suicide watch. The
Operations Lieutenant will email the roster to the Captain, as he will be responsible for verifying that each inmate is
in the appropriate cell. This verification process will ensure inmates placed on suicide watch are keyed into accurate
bed assignments and will eliminate inmates being keyed into the same cell.
Additionally, the Lieutenants were instructed to contact the Captain and on-call Psychology statf by telephone when
the need for suicide watch placement is determined after hours. Psychology staff have been instructed to contact the
Warden upon receiving said notification. After consultation with the Warden, Psychology staff will designate
whether a staff or inmate companion will be assigned. Psychology staff will in turn inform the Shift Lieutenant of
this determination.
To ensure inmates are assigned to the correct cell inside the Special Housing Unit, periodic and unannounced checks
are conducted. Specifically, SENTRY Roster PP30 Quarters assignments are audited daily by the SHU Lieutenant.
Executive Staff also conduct routine bed book counts in all units. Any and all discrepancies identified are addressed.
Results will be maintained by Correctional services in the Lieutenants Log. The Morning Watch Lieutenant is
responsible for observing one count during his or her shift in SHU which is documented daily in the Lieutenants
Log.
In order to properly account for inmates in the unit, staff have been informed not use the Inmate Locator Form, due
to the forms being unreliable in accounting for inmates and cell assignments. A Unit Accountability Board along
with a SENTRY PP30 Quarters Roster have been placed in the unit to establish better oversight over inmate
accountability.
Correctional Staff are required to perform routine rounds of the second floor suicide watch area every hour. On Day
watch, Monday through Friday, the 2 Sally Officers are required to perform rounds on suicide watch inmates, as
prescribed by the Captain. After hours, the Unit 2 Officer will be responsible for making rounds, serving meals,
collecting trash in the area, and performing the count with the Internal 1 or Internal 2 Officer assisting with duties as
assigned by the Captain. To ensure that staff are informed of the importance of Suicide Prevention and
responsibilities when one occurs. Lieutenants will reinforce the message through conference calls with staff. Roll
Call notes will be placed on TRUSCOPE to notify staff of which inmates are currently on suicide watch.
9. Attorney Log Books: Four log books were not secured following Mr. Epstein's death. Specifically, three Attorney
Log Books located in the Attorney Visiting and Front Lobby areas and an Inmate Search Log Book located in the
Attorney Visiting area were not secured. All four books were still in use at the outset of the reconstruction and after
the reconstruction team advised staff to secure them. P5324.08 states, "In the event of a suicide, institution staff,
particularly Correctional Services staff, and other law enforcement personnel, will handle the site with the same
level of protection as any crime scene in which a death has occurred." This policy further states, "All possible
