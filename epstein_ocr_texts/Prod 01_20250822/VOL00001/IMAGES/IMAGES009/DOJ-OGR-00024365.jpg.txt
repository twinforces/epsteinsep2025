Hello,
I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out because we suspect one of the paramedics involved in
responding the Jeffrey Epstein call posted information online before it was reported in the mainstream
media.
We were able to view posts on the website 4chan, frequented by far-right trolls, that were published a full 45
minutes before ABC news first reported Epstein’s death. I'd like to send you the posts to verify whether the
information in them is correct and whether it could have come to your team but in addition to that, do you
have any statement on the situation?
Thank you,
