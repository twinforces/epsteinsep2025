Also on July 23, 2019, the Staff Psychologist conducted a suicide risk assessment that included a clinical
interview of Epstein and a review of Epstein’s medical record, the psychology data system, and a review of
the SENTRY database. According to the Staff Psychologist’s report, Epstein denied knowing why he was
placed on suicide watch. BOP records state that Epstein recalled getting a drink of water the night prior and
then went back to bed. Epstein’s next recollection was hearing himself snoring. The BOP assessment
records reflect that Epstein wanted to know why he was on suicide watch and he was informed that he had
been found with a string on his neck. The Staff Psychologist noted that it was unclear whether Epstein had
placed the string around his neck or if someone else did. Epstein denied current suicidal or self-harm
thoughts or ever having these thoughts; denied a history of self-harm and suicide attempts; and denied
feeling hopeless and fearing for his safety. Epstein told the Staff Psychologist that he lived to enjoy life and
that his future plans included fighting his criminal case and getting back to his normal life. The Staff
Psychologist noted that Epstein was to remain on suicide watch for further observation. The Staff
Psychologist told the OIG she had advised BOP staff that Epstein would need a cellmate.
The Chief Psychologist said she considered three possibilities to explain the July 23 incident: (1) Epstein
and/or Inmate 1 were gaming the system to get something they wanted that they were not getting;
(2) Epstein, who really was suicidal, had conducted a rehearsal; or (3) Inmate 1 had assaulted Epstein. The
Chief Psychologist told the OIG that after Epstein told her he wanted to be housed with the same cellmate
he originally said had assaulted him, she began to think that the third possibility (assault by Inmate 1) was
less plausible than the other two possibilities, although she did not know for certain.
The following day, July 24, medical staff examined Epstein at approximately 1:08 p.m., and observed that the
central part of the red mark on Epstein’s neck had some abrasion. Epstein told the medical staff that he still
did not want to talk about how he sustained his injuries, but he believed that his cellmate had something to
do with it. BOP’s SIS opened an investigation into this incident but was unable to determine whether
Epstein had harmed himself or had been assaulted.
On July 24, 2019, after 31 hours and 5 minutes, Epstein was removed from suicide watch. Epstein remained
in the same cell that he was in under suicide watch and was under psychological observation until July 30,
2019.7? Also on July 24, 2019, Forensic Psychologist 2 completed a Post Suicide Watch Report. According to
Forensic Psychologist 2’s report, Epstein continued to claim a lack of memory regarding how he sustained
the scar around his neck. The BOP report further stated that Epstein adamantly denied suicidal ideation,
intentions, and plans, that Epstein identified reasons to live and was future-oriented, and that Epstein was
assessed for a willingness to engage in treatment. The BOP report reflected that Forensic Psychologist 2
inquired further if Epstein could recall the previous day’s incident and Epstein stated that he had been trying
to remember. Forensic Psychologist 2 asked Epstein why he told another inmate that Epstein’s cellmate had
tried to kill him but was now claiming he has no memory of the incident. Epstein told Forensic
Psychologist 2 that he did not recall himself or his cell mate tying a string or rope around his neck.
Following Forensic Psychologist 2’s examination of Epstein, she determined that he should be removed from
suicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that she discussed the decision to step Epstein down to
psychological observation from suicide watch with the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, who both
22 Epstein’s BOP medical records reflect that he was removed from psychological observation and returned to the SHU
on July 30, 2019; however, SENTRY inaccurately reflects that Epstein was transferred back to the SHU on July 29, 2019.
