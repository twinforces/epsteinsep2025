The CNN article is quite critical and says DOJ officials are expressing frustration that the info BOP provided is
turning up wrong. The only example they give is that officials believed over weekend he as released on bail,
but it turns out that he was just moved to another facility. That is NOT TRUE. He was released and is not in
BOP custody. Can you call OPA and ensure they know the truth as they are the DOJ officials that CNN is
referring to. We never said he was released on bail...we only said he was released and that remains accurate.
Thanks.
