Hi Darrin
At Judge Berman's invitation, | went to the hearing in Epstein's case this morning. As you likely know, the
government had asked the court to grant their request for a nolle pros. At the start of the hearing, Judge
Berman said he was using the hearing as an opportunity for the victims to be heard. He then gave the
government and defense counsel a chance to speak.
