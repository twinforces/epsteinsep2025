Focus of Session
Mr. EPSTEIN was seen today by this writer for a follow up appointment after he was removed from Psychological
Observation yesterday.
Subjective/Objective Presentation
Mr. EPSTEIN presented in a pleasant mood and reported he is generally doing well. He stated, "| could be better," but
acknowledged he is doing as well as can be expected given his circumstances. He reported he is going to court today
for a status hearing. He stated he generally slept well last night and is readjusting to being placed back in SHU. He
reported getting along well with his cell mate. He was informed of appropriate procedures for contacting Psychology
staff while he is in SHU, if needed.
Current Mental Status: Mr. EPSTEIN was alert and oriented. He was polite, calm, and cooperative in demeanor. He
exhibited a neutral affect with appropriate range. Eye contact and hygiene were appropriate. He spoke with normal rate,
tone, and volume. His thoughts were organized and coherent, with no loosening of associations or tangential,
circumstantial, or irrelevant content. There was no evidence of perceptual disturbance, delusional ideation, or a formal
thought disorder. He did not engage in any bizarre or inappropriate behavior. He noted having normal sleeping and
eating habits. Mr. EPSTEIN explicitly denied recent and current suicidal ideation, planning, and intent. He was future-
oriented and expressed a commitment to life and safety, agreeing to contact staff immediately should he experience
suicidal ideation or psychological distress. He also denied thoughts of harming others.
Intervention(s)
Supportive interventions and cognitive behavioral therapeutic techniques were utilized. Mr. EPSTEIN was receptive to
all interventions.
Progress/Plan
Mr. EPSTEIN was educated about both routine and emergency procedures for contacting psychology. There appears to
be no need for follow-up at this time and he expressed willingness to self refer to psychology staff if needed. He will
continue to be seen during routine SHU rounds and SHU reviews while he is housed in SHU. He was encouraged to
reach out for PRN services should he experience any psychological distress.
