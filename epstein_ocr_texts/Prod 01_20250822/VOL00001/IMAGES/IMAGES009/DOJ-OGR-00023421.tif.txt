Watch SHU Officer in Charge, he did not select a new cellmate for Epstein because he was not certain that
Inmate 3 had been discharged from the institution, although he assumed that Inmate 3 would not return to
the SHU. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that when his shift ended at approximately
2 p.m., he informed the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge and Senior Officer Specialist 5 that, if Inmate 3
did not return to the SHU, Epstein would need a new cellmate upon Epstein’s return from his attorney visit.
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said he specifically recalled telling the Evening Watch SHU Officer in
Charge, in the presence of Senior Officer Specialist 5, “Make sure this guy gets a bunkie,” to which the
Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge replied, “All right.” The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge said that, at
some point that day, it was likely that he also informed the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant, but he could
not specifically recall if he had done so.
The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that a replacement cellmate should have been identified
as soon as it was confirmed that Inmate 3 had left the institution. He said a new cellmate could have been
reassigned before the 4 p.m. SHU count if it was known that Inmate 3 was not coming back, but the SHU
staff members had until Epstein returned from his attorney visit to assign Epstein a new cellmate.
According to the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, SHU staff definitely should have realized that Inmate 3
was not returning both during the 4 p.m. count and when Epstein returned from his attorney visit later that
evening. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that Epstein’s daily routine was that he would
be with his attorneys in the attorney conference room until approximately 8 p.m., so SHU personnel had
time to make a new cellmate assignment. He said all SHU staff members shared the responsibility to find a
replacement cellmate and that anyone assigned to the SHU could have found another inmate to replace
Inmate 3. However, he also said that due to Epstein’s high profile, the SHU personnel should have asked a
Lieutenant to contact the Psychology Department to see which inmate should be placed with Epstein.
On August 12, 2019, following Epstein’s death, the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge wrote a memorandum
to the Warden stating, “On Friday August 9, 2019 at approximately 1:50 p.m., | S/O/S [the Day Watch SHU
Officer in Charge] passed on to oncoming staff member [the Evening Watch SHU Officer in Charge] and
present shift staff [Senior Officer Specialist 5] and [CO 2] that Inmate [3] was going WAB [i-e., with all of his
belongings] and possibly may not return. Also that Inmate Epstein #76318-054 will be needing a cell mate
upon arrival from his attorney visit.” The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge departed the SHU at
approximately 2 p.m. and worked an overtime shift as a driver for MCC New York. He stated that he did not
follow up with the SHU staff to verify that Epstein had been assigned another cellmate.
MCC New York staff with responsibility for oversight and staffing of the SHU during the Day Watch, including
the Warden, Associate Warden 1, the Captain, the SHU Lieutenant, the Day Watch Operations Lieutenant,
the Day Watch Activities Lieutenant, and the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge, told the OIG that they all
knew Epstein was required to have a cellmate pursuant to the Psychology Department’s determination.
They also confirmed that everyone who regularly worked in the SHU knew of this requirement, and that it
was the responsibility of all SHU staff to notify a supervisor upon learning that Epstein needed to be
assigned a new cellmate due to Inmate 3’s transfer to another prison. The Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge
and CO 1, however, were the only two MCC New York staff members working the Day Watch on August 9,
2019, who told the OIG that they were aware of Inmate 3’s transfer and the need to assign Epstein a new
cellmate. CO 1’s immediate superior (the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge) was already aware of the need
to assign Epstein a new cellmate. While the Day Watch SHU Officer in Charge told the OIG that he made a
number of notifications, other witnesses could not confirm that he had passed on information regarding
Epstein’s need for a new cellmate.
