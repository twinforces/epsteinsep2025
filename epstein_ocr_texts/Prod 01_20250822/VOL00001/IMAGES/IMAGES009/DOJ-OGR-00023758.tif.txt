States Attorney’s Office for a determination of whether to
release the documents, pursuant to the Touhy regulations, 28

2. Medical Records
Medical records may be obtained by defense counsel with a Consent

consent form is required. The request can be mailed to the Legal
Department. If the inmate is no longer assigned to MCC New York,
then the requesting attorney must file a FOIA request toe the
following address:

Health Services staff are not at liberty to discuss information
with an inmate’s attorney related to that inmate’s medical
condition. Attorneys are encouraged to seek such information
directly from their clients.
If a newly arriving inmate has prior non-Bureéau medical records,
you may send the materials to MCC New York, ATTN: Health Services

E. Inmate Legal Activities

1. Law Library
The law library at MCC New York consists of legal books, electric
typewriters, and computers on which inmates may access and view
discovery material on CD-ROM format. The Education Department
also provides copy machines for inmates to use in preparing any
legal documents.

during their scheduled law library hours, which are one day a
week, Monday through Thursday. Inmates should check the bulletin
boards in their respective housing units for days and times
scheduled. Inmates may sign up to access the law library between
the hours of 7:45 a.m. and 10:40 a.m., and from 12:30 p.m.
through 3:30 p.m. Since MCC New York is a high-rise building,
