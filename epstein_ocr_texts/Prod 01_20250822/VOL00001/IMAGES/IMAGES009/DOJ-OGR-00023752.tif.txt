ll. Separation Assignments/Co-Defendant Meetings
Co-defendant meetings must be requested at least 24 hours in
advance of the meeting, e.g. for a meeting on Tuesday at 2:00
P.M., the request must be submitted by Monday at 2:00 P.M.
Written requests shoulda be faxed to the MCC New York Legal
Department, (646) 836-7665, and should include the names of
everyone attending the meeting, including, but not limited toa,
attorneys, paralegals, interpreters, investigators, co-defendants
on bail and co-defendants at MCC New York. Please indicate which
attorney represents each inmate. Also, please include with the
request a copy of the first page of the indictment showing that
the requested parties are co-defendants. This must be provided
every time a meeting is requested.

Separation Orders: An inmate with a “separation order” is
prohibited from coming in contact with the inmate from whom he or
she is separated. Such a restriction would normally prevent a
co-defendant meeting. Ordinarily, the request can be
accommodated if the AUSA who placed the separation order notifies
the institution that the separation does not apply to co-
defendant meetings. However, if the inmates have been separated
due to security concerns, whether based on information developed
by an outside agency or the Bureau of Prisons, MCC has the
discretion to not allow the meeting. Attorneys who are aware of
separation orders between co-defendants should include with their
request the name and phene number of the AUSA assigned to the
case in question. These requests should be made as far in
advance as possible, as the meeting will not be scheduled if the
responsible Assistant United States Attorney cannot be contacted.
For co-defendant meetings that involve one or more inmates from
McC New York and one or more inmates from MDC Brooklyn, it is the
responsibility of the defense attorney to contact the responsible
Assistant United States Attorney, who will, in turn, contact the
USMS to arrange transportation of the inmate. The Bureau of
Prisons does not transport inmates for co-defendant meetings.
