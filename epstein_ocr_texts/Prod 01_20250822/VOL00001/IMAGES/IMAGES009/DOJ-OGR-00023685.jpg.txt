Good morning]
My apologies, but | have been away from my desk in meetings the past three days. | received your voicemails regarding the status
of Mr. Epstein's personal effects. Presently, while the external investigation continues, any personal property attributable to Mr.
Epstein is being held as evidence. Once the outside investigators release the property, we hope to be able to return it to his family
as expeditiously as possible.
If you have any further questions, please email me and we can try to arrange a mutually convenient time to chat further.
Thank you,
DOJ-OGR-00023685
