Commissioner Rick Swearingen

Florida Department of Law Enforcement

Tallahassee, FL 32308

Dear Commissioner Swearingen:

Today, I received the attached letter from Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric
Bradshaw. I am requesting that FDLE assume the criminal investigation regarding
Jeffrey Epstein.

Also, Iam requesting that FDLE initiate a preliminary inquiry into misconduct
and allegations that go beyond the reported concerns with Jeffrey Epstein’s work
release.

Finally, please find attached my Executive Order reassigning this matter from
Palm Beach County to the State Attorney for the Nineteenth Judicial Circuit of Florida,
Bruce Colton.

Thank you for your prompt attention in this matter.

erely,
on DeSantis
Governor
