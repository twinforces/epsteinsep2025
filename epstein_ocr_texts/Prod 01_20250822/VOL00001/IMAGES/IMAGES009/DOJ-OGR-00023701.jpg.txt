Attached starting at p. 26, please find the application and NCIC check form. Paralegals must submit new applications yearly to

the lobby guards that | had to re-submit my application and to ask the legal department directly on the reasoning. | wanted to
reach out to ask what in my application needed to be changed or fixed so that | do not repeat the mistake.
