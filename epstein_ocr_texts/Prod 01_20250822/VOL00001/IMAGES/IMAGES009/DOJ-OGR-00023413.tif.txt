concurred with her determination. Epstein was therefore taken off suicide watch and placed on
psychological observation, during which time BOP records reflect that he was continuously observed by
inmate companions and seen daily by Psychology Department staff. Forensic Psychologist 2 annotated in
the Post Suicide Watch Report that the reason for removing Epstein from suicide watch was due to Epstein
stating he had no interest in killing himself; he had described having a wonderful life; and Epstein had said it
would be crazy to take his own life and he would not do that to himself. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI
that following her clinical visit with Epstein on July 24, 2019, she was cautious with Epstein’s case and his
self-reporting of what had occurred the previous day. Forensic Psychologist 2 stated that she observed
signs of positivity and that Epstein “adamantly denied suicide.” Nevertheless, she was not comfortable
taking Epstein off suicide watch and instead opted to place Epstein on psychological observation, which was
a step down from suicide watch. Forensic Psychologist 2 told the FBI that “I made the decision with the
consent” of the Chief Psychologist and Associate Warden 2, with whom she had consulted. Forensic
Psychologist 2 told the FBI that placing Epstein on psychological observation allowed him to possess hygiene
products, two novels, attend legal visits, and take showers. It also allowed him to have standard inmate
clothing, a flex pen, a toothbrush and toothpaste, soap, and deodorant. However, Forensic Psychologist 2
explained that it was not healthy for inmates to stay on suicide watch for extended periods of time and they
are re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis.
According to Forensic Psychologist 2’s Post Suicide Watch Report, Epstein expressed a feeling of safety being
housed in the psychological observation area rather than the SHU and asked if there was a safer unit for
him to be housed. Forensic Psychologist 2 informed Epstein that he would remain on psychological
observation for the near future, but his long-term housing would need to be revisited because it is not ideal
to remain in psychological observation for extended periods of time. The BOP report states that Epstein
was again educated on routine and emergency procedures for contacting Psychology Department staff.
According to BOP records, between July 25-29, 2019, Epstein was seen daily by the Chief Psychologist or the
Staff Psychologist while he was on psychological observation. On each of these dates, according to BOP
reports, Epstein adamantly denied any suicidality and denied having any memory of what occurred on
July 23, 2019, which resulted in him being placed on suicide watch. Additionally, on each date, Epstein was
provided with supportive and coping skill interventions to which he was receptive. BOP records state that
Epstein expressed concerns about being housed again in the SHU because he felt it was dangerous; he
could not sleep well due to noise from other inmates; and it was difficult for him to work on his legal case.
The Chief Psychologist told the FBI and the OIG that she met with Epstein on July 25, 2019, and he was in
good spirits. She said that during this clinical visit, Epstein said he was baffled over the July 23, 2019 incident
and asked the Chief Psychologist to give him some cues to help him remember. The Chief Psychologist told
the OIG that she kept Epstein on psychological observation because he had not answered her questions
regarding the possible suicide attempt. The Chief Psychologist told the OIG that she coordinated with the
BOP’s National Suicide Prevention Coordinator, who recommended that Epstein be housed with a sex
offender in the SHU. The Chief Psychologist notified Associate Warden 2 of this recommendation via email.
BOP records further reflect that, during his clinical visit on July 28, 2019, Epstein told the Staff Psychologist
that he was agitated for hours the previous night because of a non-stop toilet flushing and that the noise
was similar to when he was housed in the SHU. The Staff Psychologist informed Epstein that he would be
moving to a different cell.
On July 29, 2019, according to BOP records, Epstein reported to the Chief Psychologist that his memory of
the July 23, 2019 incident may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. On this date, Epstein was to receive
