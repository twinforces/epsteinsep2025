were two concurrently open attorney log books in the Attorney Visiting area. Further, the different purposes of the
two attorney log books, one in the Attorney Visit area and one in the Front Lobby, could not be explained. BOP staff
were unable to articulate a system of control for the log books, and during the reconstruction, some of the log books
could not be accounted for. Within the log books, entries were made out of chronological order, attorneys did not
consistently sign in and out, significant information was illegible or missing, columns were not consistently labeled,
log book opening and closing dates were inconsistent, and the cover had been tom off of several books. At the
current time, these log books are not functioning as an adequate system of control and monitoring.

relevant logbooks are identified, secured immediately and replaced with new ones to ensure the institution can
