made two edits/clarifications below on 7/29 first part, and 8/9 regarding the psych alert.
Feel free to call me if you have any questions.
In terms of releasing the info, I don't have any concerns per se, however, this is all subject to an
ongoing investigation. Normally, I would never release such information without first ensuring
that the investigative body (OIG/FBI) do not have any concerns that its release may interfere
with their investigation. Of course, you may have already done that, but in any event that is
between you and them and not my business.

Hugh/Ray: Can you verify that the information below is accurate? It’s based in large part on the
timeline you sent.
Is there any reason why this information shouldn’t be released to the public?
On July 23d, Epstein was placed on suicide watch and received medical evaluation. Epstein
received daily psychological evaluations while on suicide watch.
On July 29" after daily interaction with Epstein, and according to established procedures, MCC-
New York Psychology Services Department determined he no longer warranted placement on
suicide watch. Epstein was returned to the Special Housing Unit (SHU) with a requirement that
he have a cellmate. He was with same cellmate from that date until August 9". In addition, the
SHU confinement includes frequent head counts as well as 30 minute checks.

appearance. That inmate was eventually released from custody by the Court and did not return
to the institution. On August 9". Enstein was in a legal visit with his lawvers all dav until 6:45
