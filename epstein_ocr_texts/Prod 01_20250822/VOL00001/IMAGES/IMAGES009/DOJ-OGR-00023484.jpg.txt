BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.
Recommendation Four: The BOP should evaluate its methods of accounting for inmate
whereabouts and wellbeing and make changes as may be appropriate to improve those methods
through policy, training, or other measures.
BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.
Recommendation Five: BOP policy should clarify what is required of a lieutenant when
conducting a round.
BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.
Recommendation Six: The BOP should continue to develop and implement plans to address
staffing shortages at its prisons.
BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation. Hiring and retaining qualified
personnel is a key priority and BOP has developed and implemented a multi-pronged approach
that involves enhanced recruitment efforts and appropriate incentives. While the issues raised in
the OIG’s report were the result of employees failing to adhere to their duties, as opposed to a
staffing shortage, the BOP welcomes the opportunity to continue the significant work that has
already been undertaken and that is ongoing regarding staffing.
Recommendation Seven: The BOP should evaluate its cell search procedures and make changes
as may be appropriate to improve those procedures through policy, training, or other measures.
BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.
Recommendation Eight: The BOP should enhance existing policies regarding institutional
security camera systems to ensure they specifically state that such systems must have the
capacity to record video and that BOP institutions must conduct regular security camera system
functionality checks.
BOP’s Response: The BOP concurs with this recommendation.
The BOP appreciates OIG’s careful attention to this engagement, and its willingness to provide
specific, feasible recommendations that address the root causes of issues raised in the incident
described. Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this report. We look forward to
working with OIG to close these recommendations.
