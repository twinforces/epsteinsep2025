Thank you. The first thing is that Inmate Epstein incorrectly wrote his reg. # on his request for the religious
diet, so Sentry didn't recognize the number. Just before Chaplain[&@iiwas leaving yesterday, we realized
the inmate had transposed two of his numbers, and | told him I'd take care of putting him on the religious
diet designation. SARs aware of the inmate's dietary needs and has been providing the religious diet
since last Friday I've been told.
| also have another religious diet interview scheduled, which will require data entry.
Thanks again,
Chap
