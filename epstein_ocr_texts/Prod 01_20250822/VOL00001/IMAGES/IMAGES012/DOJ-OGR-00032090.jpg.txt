Jeffrey Epstein: International Moneyman of Mystery Page 3 of 4
species represents the highest evolutionary form of the political animal. To be
up close to him, as he was during the African journey, is akin to seeing the
rarest of beasts on a safari. As he put it to a friend upon his return from Africa,
"If you were a boxer at the downtown gymnasium at 14th Street and Mike
Tyson walked in, your face would have the same look as these foreign
leaders had when Clinton entered the room. He is the world's greatest
politician."

“Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist
with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-
first-century science," Clinton says through a spokesman. "I especially
appreciated his insights and generosity during the recent trip to Africa to work
on democratization, empowering the poor, citizen service, and combating
HIV/AIDS."
Before Clinton, Epstein's rare appearances in the gossip columns tended to
be speculation as to the true nature of his relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell.
While they are still friends, the English tabloids have postulated that Maxwell
has longed for a more permanent pairing and that for undetermined reasons
Epstein has not reciprocated in kind. "It's a mysterious relationship that they
have," says society journalist David Patrick Columbia. "In one way, they are
soul mates, yet they are hardly companions anymore. It's a nice conventional
relationship, where they serve each other's purposes."
Friends of the two say that Maxwell, whose social life has always been higher-
octane than Epstein's, lent a little pizzazz to the lower-profile Epstein. Indeed,
at a party at Maxwell's house, her friends say, one is just as apt to see
Russian ladies of the night as one is to see Prince Andrew. The Oxford-
educated Maxwell, described by many as a man-eater (she flies her own
helicopter and was recently seen dining with Clinton at Nello's on Madison
Avenue), lives in her own townhouse a few blocks away. Epstein is frequently
seen around town with a bevy of comely young women but there has been no
boldfaced name to replace Maxwell. "You may read about Jeffrey in the social
columns, but there is much more to him than that," says Jeffrey T. Leeds of
the private equity firm Leeds Weld & Co. "He's a talented money manager
and an extremely hardworking person with broad interests. Most unusual,
though, is that in this media-obsessed age he is not in any sense a self-
promoter."
Born in 1953 and raised in Coney Island, Epstein went to Lafayette High
School. According to his bio, he took some classes in physics at Cooper
Union from 1969 to 1971. He left Cooper Union in 1971 and attended NYU's
Courant Institute, where he took courses in mathematical physiology of the
heart, leaving that school, too, without a degree. Between 1973 and 1975,
Epstein taught calculus and physics at the Dalton School.
By most accounts, he was something of a Robin Williams—in—Dead Poets
Society type of figure, wowing his high-school classes with passionate
mathematical riffs. So impressed was one Wall Street father of a student that
he said to Epstein point-blank: “What are you doing teaching math at Dalton?
You should be working on Wall Street -- why don't you give my friend Ace
Greenberg a call."
