2 || I mean, I’m sorry, he is circumcised, my bad. He’s circumcised, a
3 hundred and ten percent sure. A matter of fact, he has some sort of
4 birth defect. On his thing. I don’t know what it is [giggles] I’ve
5 never like really looked at it, because I’ve never done anything
6 where | had to touch it. I’ve never touched it out of the whole time
7 I worked for him I never touched his penis. Like, he I’m pretty
8 sure he he rubbed it against me, but I’ve never ever been like, okay
9 I’m letting you do this or I’m gonna do this to you. Um, it’s really
10 weirdly shaped. I don’t know, do you want me to like tell you

32 get fully hard, ever. Like, I just could tell by looking at it, like, by
33 looking you can obviously tell if you’re hard or not and I could tell
34 that he wasn’t.
35
36 DETECTIVE: Okay.
37
38 P| So I don’t know if that’s some sort of thing that’s wrong with him,
39 but it definitely was not normal. And I have, I mean it’s not like I
40 sleep around, you know, but I’ve seen, and it was not normal.
