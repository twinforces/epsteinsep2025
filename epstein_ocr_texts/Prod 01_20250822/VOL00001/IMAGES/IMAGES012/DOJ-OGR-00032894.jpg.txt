A review of the telephone message books, which were obtained during
the search warrant, was conducted in which various messages from
different dates were made to Jeffrey Epstein. The telephone message
books have a duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message
is written into the book, the top copy is then torn on the perforated
edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls,
dates and telephone numbers were on the copy of the messages. I
recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been
interviewed. The body of the messages was time of the day that they
called for confirmation of "work." Other names and telephone numbers
were located in which the body of the messages were, "I have girls for
him" or "I have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah
for Jeffrey Epstein. Based on the context of the body of the
messages, I requested subpoenas for subscriber information on the
telephone numbers and the time frame involved. Copies of the messages
were made for evidentiary purposes. :
