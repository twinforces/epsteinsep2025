Upon Robson s entry in the unmarked Detective vehicle, I placed a tape
recorder within the vehicle to record any conversations within the
vehicle. During the ride back to the police station, Robson advised
she is attending Palm Beach Community College at the Palm Beach
Gardens Campus and is majoring in journalism.
Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the
interview room in the Detective Bureau. I explained to Robson that I
appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should
she desire to leave at any time she may do so. I further explained
the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated she
understood. During the taped sworn interview, Robson was asked how
she came in contact with Epstein. Robson stated back when she turned
17 years of age she was approached by a friend Molly in the Canopy
Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make
money.
She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make
| $200.00. Robson thought about the offer and agreed to meet with
Jeffrey. Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name)
picked her up and she was taken to Epstein's house. Upon her arrival
at the house, she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the
house. She was also introduced to a white female known to her as
Sara. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known to her as Jeff
Epstein s bedroom. Sara arranged the massage table and covered the
table with a sheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them
next to the massage bed. Sara then left the room and informed her
Jeff would be in aminute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a
towel. He lay on the table onto his stomach and picked massage oil
for Robson to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated, He tried
to touch me and I stopped him. I asked how he tried to touch her. He
grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson also stated
Epstein has a vibrator, which is large and white in color. Robson
told Epstein, I'll massage you but I don't want to be touched. Robson
stated she performed the massage naked. At the conclusion of the
massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.00 for the massage. He explained, I
know you re not comfortable, but I'll pay you if you bring some girls.
He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she once tried to
bring a 23-year-old female and Epstein stated that the female was too
old. Robson was asked how many girls she brought in total to Epstein.
Robson stated six that she can remember. Robson stated she brought

I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised the victim
was the youngest. Robson stated every girl she brought knew what to
expect when they arrived. They were told they would provide a
massage, possibly naked, and some touching. I asked her if the victim
was aware. She stated every girl she brought knew what to expect.
She explained she knew the victim wanted to make money. She
approached the victim and explained about going to work for Jeff. The
