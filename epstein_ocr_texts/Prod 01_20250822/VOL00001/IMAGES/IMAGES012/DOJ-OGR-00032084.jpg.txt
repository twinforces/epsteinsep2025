SEAN "Puffy" Combs confirmed our account of how Heath Ledger scuffled with his bodyguards at the
VH1/Vogue Awards after-party Combs threw at Lotus. "Heath is from Australia, and he parties hard now,"
Combs told "Access Hollywood." The two became pals on the set of "Monster's Ball." "He's coming at me, he's
like, 'Puff, people don't know that we're the best of friends,’ so it's like my security held him up for a second...
and | was like, 'No, that's my brother.'" Sins of his grandfather
"DISCO Bloodbath" author James St. James is following up his notorious tell-all about killer club kid Michael Alig
with another true-crime tome. He's shopping around "Killer Grandpa," his investigation into a lynching that his
grandfather led in 1935. "My grandfather was a sheriff in Fort Lauderdale, and he lynched a black man that
allegedly raped a white woman," James told us. "About 100 people gathered to watch, and they passed a gun
around and everyone took a shot at the body. It became this big town secret, and | write about what really
happened." James, a 1980s club kid who fell in with Alig's inner circle, is played by Seth Green in "Party
Monster,” the movie adaptation of "Disco Bloodbath." But James said he was "shocked" when he watched a few
scenes of Green mincing it up with Macaulay Culkin, who plays Alig. "! didn't know | was so gay! | thought! was
more like Steve McQueen, but Seth is flouncing around the whole time. Seth is much cuter than me, actually,
and looks better in drag."
