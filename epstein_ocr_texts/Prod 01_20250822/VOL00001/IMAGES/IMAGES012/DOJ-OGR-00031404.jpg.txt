of the charmingly inevitable accidents of Epstein’s rise, Greenberg was a senior partner of the house;
Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne later told New York that Epstein’s forte was dealing with wealthier
clients, helping them with their overall portfolios. Leslie Wexner, founder of Limited Brands, reportedly
made Epstein his financial adviser and was instrumental in building his fortune. Epstein was no
footman: he loved luxury and, in his own words, saw himself as a financial architect, someone who
could show the rich how to live with their money. “I want people to understand the power, the
responsibility, and the burden of their money,” he once wrote. At times, his powers seemed magical. “I

answer in the shortest period of time. That’s my definition of IQ.”
A Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. “He has the ability to
make connections that other minds can’t make,” says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. “He is
extremely smart and probing. He can very quickly acquire information to think about a problem and also
to identify biological problems without having all the data that a scientist would have ... He also has an
