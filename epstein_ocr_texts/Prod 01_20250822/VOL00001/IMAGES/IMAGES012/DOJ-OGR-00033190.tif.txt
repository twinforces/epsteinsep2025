Re: BB. v, JEFFREY EPSTEIN
OUR FILE NO.: 080303

Dear Ms. Hackett,

As we discussed, I have agreed to cancel the deposition of ASA Daliah Weiss at this time.
Based on the conversations with Ms. Weiss and you, I do not foresee the need at this time to
reset this deposition, but I cannot completely foreclose the possibility of deposition in the future
pending further discovery in the Epstein cases. As | mentioned to you, if [ believe there is
additional information that develops in these cases that would require me to reset Mrs. Weiss for
deposition, I will provide you with notice prior resetting this deposition so that you will have an
opportunity to address the court in 4 timely manner.

Should you have any additiona] questions please do not hesitate to contact me at your
convenience,
