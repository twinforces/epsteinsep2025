Along comes a game warden in his boat. He
pulls up alongside the woman and says, "Good
morning Ma'am. What are you doing?"

) Reading a book, " she replies, thinking, :"Isn't
that obvious?"
You're in a restricted fishing area, " he informs
her.
"I'm sorry officer, but I'm not fishing, I'm
reading."
"Yeas, but you have all the equipment. For all I
know you could start at any moment. I'll have ;
to take you in and write you up."
"If you do that, I'll have to charge you with
sexual assault, " says the woman.
"But I haven't touched you, " says the game
warden.
"That's true, but you have all the equipment.
For all 1 know you could start at any moment."
"Have a nice day ma'am, " and he left. |
