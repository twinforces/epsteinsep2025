Greetings from Tallahassee
Current mood: Â© peaceful
I made it! I'm atl love it here. My dorm is so big and nice, compared to most of
the other dorms on campus. I've been going to class now for three weeks and I love
it. AS a matter of fact, I'm doing quite well. I'm so glad! Who knew that doing good in
high school would pay off?...j/k. I've totally fallen in love with Jrhe weather,
most of the time is perfect. It's beautiful up here. This weekend Will is visiting and I
am so excited. I'm goinna show him all over. We're going to have the best time!
Hopefully, everything will continue to go well. If I keep up this pace I'll have a
descent chance at the dean's list. OMG! I would just die! Wish me luck! I miss
everyone! XOXO -""
