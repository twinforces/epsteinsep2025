zombies and puppies
Current mood: Â© content
hey,
halloween was so much fun! will and i ended up going to a party. our makeup was
awesome. i only have one pic of us up right now but i'll soon have more. the one i
have up is of us after the make-up had been on for hours,......it started to peel off in
the pic but i think it still looks awesome. also, we found a red pitbull puppy a few
days ago. i wrote a bulletin about her but i forgot to add that she is sooo00co0 good
with children. i have an 18 month old living with me and she is just soooo nice to
him. she loves to play with him and has not shown one sign of agression. even with
another dog that is bigger than her, a cat and a baby constantly bothering her. i
want to keep her soooo bad, i just can't tho. someone please take her!!!!!! and
provide her with a good home!!!!! thanku. <3.
