the other dorms on campus. I've been going to class now for three weeks and I love
it. AS a matter of fact, I'm doing quite well. I'm so glad! Who knew that doing good in
high school would pay off?...j/k. I've totally fallen in love with[jThe weather,
most of the time is perfect. It's beautiful up here. This weekend Will is visiting and I
am so excited. I'm goinna show him all over. We're going to have the best time!
Hopefully, everything will continue to go well. If I keep up this pace I'll have a
descent chance at the dean's list. OMG! I would just die! Wish me luck! I miss
