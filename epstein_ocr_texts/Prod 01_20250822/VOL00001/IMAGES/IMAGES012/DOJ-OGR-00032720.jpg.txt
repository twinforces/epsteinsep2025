Det. Recarey directed me to a second detached structure located on the
South East corner of the property. This area of this structure was
assigned with single letters to identify a particular part of the
room. In the office area, designated as Room B, I observed a powered
on Dell Dimension 2350, attached to an LCD flat panel monitor. The
screen displayed an open Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with URL
address of http://home.bellsouth.net/. I observed no other active
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. The power
cord was removed from the back of the Dell CPU and I disconnected the
cable modem to prevent remote access. At that time, the Dell CPU,
marked with Serial Number 6WTVN21, was secured and turned over the
evidence custodian for future forensic analysis via. property receipt.
I also located several media related items within Room B, which were
recorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence
Custodians.
I then responded to a Bedroom designated as Room F, where I observed a
white in color CPU marked Premio. The Premio CPU was in a computer
desk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were powered on.
The CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software,
warning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. I removed
the power cable from the back of the Premio CPU and shutdown all other
media. The Premio CPU, marked with Serial Number 2000091078, was
secured and turned over the evidence custodian for future forensic
analysis via property receipt. I also located several media related
| items within Room F, which were recorded onto a property receipt and
turned over the Evidence Custodians. *
| This concluded my participation in the search of the residence.
