MD Aso in the room, was the dresser /armoire where we located a
bottle of peach flavored Joy Jelly (Sexual Lubricant). Additionally,
there were several photographs of young naked teenage girls within the
closet, which was consistent with what the witnesses said. The
massage table was also located within the master bedroom. Video tapes
were located beside the television, which were also collected. An
itemized list of the property and locations was prepared on the
property receipts. At approximately 2:55 pm, the house was secured;
the exit. of the residence was videotaped. Upon our exit of the
property, I encountered Atty. Guy Fronstein who advised he was

his assistance with the investigation.
Due to Hurricane Wilma, which struck South Florida causing massive
power outages, the courthouse was closed due to the lack of power. I
was previously told that the Chief Judge had extended the filing
deadlines due to the hurricane and the Courthouse being closed. On
October 27, and 28, 2005 the courthouse was closed and I could not
file the search warrant and inventory at the clerk's office. On
October 31, 2005, I responded to the courthouse and filed the
| paperwork along with an order to seal, signed by Judge Johnson, to
| deny any release of any paperwork on this case.

On October 20, 2005, at approximately 8:30 a.m., Thursday morning, I
was advised by Captain Gudger that a search warrant would be executed
and that I was to assemble the Crime Scene Investigative Team and
stand by the south side of the building ready to go. I designated
Evidence Specialist Annette Badger to handle the inventory return, the
documentation of the property receipts and the collection and bagging
of the evidence at the scene. I further instructed CSI Kim Pavlik, ID
# 8807, to accompany us and perform the role of photographing the
scene and the items that may be taken into custody by the affiant,
Detective Joseph Recarey, ID # 7915.
My responsibility was to go through from the reading of the warrant to
the final exit from the residence and perform a video recording of the
reading of the warrant, the initial walk through of the residence
showing the current condition and then finally a walk through of the
residence at the time of the police exit.
We started out towards the residence, which was located at 358 El
Brillo and arrived at approximately 9:33 a.m. The search was
