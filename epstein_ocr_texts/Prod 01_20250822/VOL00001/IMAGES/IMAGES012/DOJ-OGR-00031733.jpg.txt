guy that has a local tv show. He goes all around to
these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I
recognized him and went over and talked to him. He
was really nice. He's having this concert to promote
his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into
going. I was standing there in a sea of Harleys and
Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving
KH T donated a football and a
Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had two toys in it so
it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap.
Just wanted to let everyone know what I was up to.
Bye!

BUMMER MAN
Current mood: @ crushed
Category: School, College, Greek
I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for bn Jan. 5. I'm
packing up Will's and my room soon and it’s making
me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so
weird not having my best friend with me. I don't
want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I
have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to
go. Have you been through this situation? How did u
deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling
20 different emotions and I have no idea how to deal
with it.

GGGRRRRRR,,......00fETTEEHEEEEY
Current mood: @) pissed off
| I forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at
Victoria's Secret. They said they suspected me
of "causing losses to their company." -Which by the
way is bullshit! I was ‘by the book' on
EVERYTHING!!!!!!! I got so fed up in that office that I
handed the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and
walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE MANI I
already have another job if I want it, and it's so much
more money$$$$$$. I'm going to be making more
money than my old bosses at VS. Success is
definately the sweetest revenge. ASSHOLES! !!!!
