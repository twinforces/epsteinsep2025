firm which has since filed bankruptcy as a result of massive fraud by one of its partners.
It is alleged that they used their civil cases filed against Mr. Epstein as one of their more
lucrative devices to perpetrate this fraud. Based on what I have learned and read, there
have been false filings, forged judge’s signatures, and forged Eleventh Circuit Opinions.
Itis also possible that other third parties have engaged in this conduct by falsely alleging
Mr. Epstein has violated the terms of his probation.
With this in mind, It appears that Mr. Epstein could be a victim of fabricated attacks
designed to do nothing more than question his compliance with his probation and
community control requirements. | truly want my client, as | am sure you do, to complete
his probation without continued false accusations being made against him. | would
suggest a meeting so we may discuss these problems. Given the fact that false
accusations are being made against my client, | would take the unusual step of producing
my client for such a meeting if you think it would be helpful.
Please give me a call with your thoughts on this and whether those documents satisfy your
request.
