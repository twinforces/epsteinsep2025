Re: State of Florida v. Jeffrey E. Epstein
Case No.: 2006CF009454A KX

Dear Mr. Goldberger:

As you know, we represent Fe in all matters pertaining to Jeffrey
Epstein. If you plan on scheduling Ms." ~‘ for deposition please contact us to schedule to
a date convenient for Ms Mill and myself. In addition, we would like to conduct a single
deposition to be used for both the criminal and the civil matters. Please let us know if you
will agree to this or if we should seek court approval for same. Of course, we understand that
the State Attorney’s Office will need to agree to this as well, and we have not yet contacted
them for approval.

Sincerely
effrey M. Herman
