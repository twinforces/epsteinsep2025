I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised the victim was the youngest as she was fourteen
when the massage occurred. Robson stated every girl she brought knew what to expect when they arrived.
They were told they would provide a massage, possibly naked, and allow some touching. I asked her if the
victim was aware. She stated every girl she brought knew what to expect. She explained she knew the victim
wanted to make money . She approached the victim and explained about going to work for Jeff. The victim
agreed and arrangements were made to bring the victim to Epstein’s house on a weekend. Robson stated that
sheand ~° (Lateridentifiedas~ ‘ ‘*_ ~~-~) picked up the victim at the victim’s house. They traveled to
Epstein’s House and entered through the kitchen door. They met with the house chef and Epstein’s assistant
Sarah, the blond woman referred by the victim. The victim was introduced to Epstein while they were in the
kitchen area. Sarah led the victim upstairs and Epstein went upstairs. When the massage was over, the victim
returned to the kitchen area. Robson stated she was paid $200.00 for bringing the victim to Epstein’s house.
Robson stated the victim told her she was paid $300.00 for the massage.
Robson stated the victim was the last person she brought to Epstein’s house. She further stated that she had
changed her cellular number to avoid being contacted by Sarah. Robson stated Sarah (Later identified as Sarah
Kellen) is Epstein’s personal assistant. She continued stating that she had no direct contact with Epstein when
he was going to travel to Palm Beach. Robson said when Epstein announces to his assistant, Sarah, that he is
traveling to Palm Beach, Sarah would then contact Robson to arrange girls to “work” for Epstein.
Robson stated that once her parents discovered that she was visiting Epstein, they disapproved of the encounters
with him and she stopped. Robson further stated that Sarah still tries to call Robson’s house and leaves
messages.
Sgt Frick entered the room and explained that based on her own statements, she had implicated herself by
bringing underage girls to Epstein’s house. Robson provided cellular telephone numbers for the girls she had
mentioned previously. Additionally, she also provided possible addresses and areas in which they lived. As
Robson was being taken home in the vehicle, a tape recorder was placed within the vehicle to record any
conversations within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson made the comment “I’m like a
Heidi Fliess”. (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in California). Robson was
dropped off at her house without incident.
On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I went to speak with JJ We met with Mrs. {J Mother) at their front
door.
