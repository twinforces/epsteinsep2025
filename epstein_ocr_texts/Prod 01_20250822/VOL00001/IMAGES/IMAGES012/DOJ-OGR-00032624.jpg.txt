On May 10, 2006, information was received that Epstein's associate,
Leslie Wexner, The Limited Inc, CEO's, plane had arrived in West Palm
Beach, PBIA. The plane, a Gulfstream 4 bearing a N900LS registration,
was on the tarmac at Galaxy Aviation. As Epstein had recently
acquired the services of a new attorney, and the fact that Epstein's
house is currently under remodeling, it was believed that Epstein may
be in Palm Beach. I conducted physical surveillance at the residence,
358 El Brillo Way. I observed a large construction crew conducting
remodeling at the house. The contractor, David Norr, was observed
driving a Ford Explorer, white in color. The vehicle has a Florida
registration of F30Q0F. Norr left Epstein's house and traveled north
on County Road. Det Caristo and I conducted surveillance on Norr.
Norr traveled to several construction sites and checked on certain
jobs. Surveillance was discontinued on Norr and Det Caristo and I
traveled to Galaxy Aviation. I observed the white plane with a blue
stripe along the body and tail of the plane; the tail number was.
visible on the bottom of the tail, closer to the body of the plane.
We maintained visual surveillance on the plane until 4:57 p.m., when a
caravan of Cadillac Escalades drove onto the tarmac. We observed
several people exit the vehicles and discovered that they were part of
the executive team for Limited Inc. The executives were in Palm Beach
County for an executive meeting for the day. They arrived in Palm
Beach County on May 9, 2006 at 9:30 pm and were scheduled to leave on
the 10th at 5:00 pm.
On May 12, 2006, I met with ASA Lana Belohlavek at the State
Attorney's Office. She explained that her boss, Barry Krischer, was
requesting this case be taken to the Grand Jury again. I explained to
her I had requested arrest warrants for Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen,
and Haley Robson. I asked that she either issue the warrants or
direct file, as sg much time has elapsed since the original request to
the Grand Jury. Ã© explained that the Palm Beach Police Department had
concluded the case _in December of 2005 and has been waiting for the
case to go forward] Belohlavek stated the original offer was again
offered to the new defense attorney. She was waiting for their answer
by Friday May 19, 2006. She stated she would advise me of the answer.
