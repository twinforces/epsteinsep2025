Copies of the tapes that were submitted into evidence were requested.
Additionally, trash pulls were started on September 21, 2005. Sgt.
Szarszewski made telephone contact with Tony Higgins, Supervisor of
the Sanitation Department, and requested that trash be collected at
the Epstein House located at 358 El Brillo in Palm Beach. Sgt
Szarszewski met with Sanitation worker, Jeff Williams and observed him
enter the property at 358 El Brillo. Shortly thereafter, Williams
exited the property and placed the three white trash bags in the empty
well in the rear of the truck. Williams then drove away where he met
with Sgt. Szarszewski who removed the bags from the well and placed
them into one large black trash bag. The bag was returned to the
Police Station where I was waiting for him. Upon his arrival, we
inspected the bags where several notes and papers were found. These
notes contained names of girls with times. Additionally, there was a

On September 22, 2005, I was informed by Sgt. Szarszewski that there
would be no trash pick up as it was recycle pick up day. A request
for copies of the micro and standard size cassettes were requested
from crime scene to familiarize myself with the interviews conducted.
On September 23, 2005, the tapes were received and I began to become
familiar with the interviews that were conducted. Det. Krauel had met
with Town of Palm Beach Sanitation worker, Jeff Williams and observed
