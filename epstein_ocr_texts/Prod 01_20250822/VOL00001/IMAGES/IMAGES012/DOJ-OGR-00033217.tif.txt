Subject: RE: Meeting with Epstein's attorneys
Hi Barry — I just left a voicemail for Claudette, but figured I would send this to you, too. Our plea negotiations are
not going very well, and ] have given the defense a deadline of tomorrow afternoon to provide me with a signed
agreement. If we cannot reach such an agreement, then I need to indict the case on Tuesday and | will not budge
from that date. During my last phone call with defense counsel, he told me that they have changed their minds
again, and they only want to plead to state charges, not concurrent state and federal. | said that is fine, but we will
need a signed non-prosecution agreement (between the defense and us) by tomorrow afternoon, and an agreement
at least verbally worked out with your office by Monday. I just think that Mr. Epstein is having second thoughts
about spending time in jail and paying damages to the girls. I know you are out tomorrow, but if something comes
up, I will call Claudette and e-mail you. Thanks.
