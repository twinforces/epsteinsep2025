breaks. Eisenstein related a story from their youth which attests to the playful side of
Jeffrey’s nature:
In high school, although we both were excellent academically, we were
jokers in physical education. We were in great physical shape, but we just
didn't take the class seriously, One month before graduation, our phys-ed
teacher called us into his office and informed us that even though we were
“two smart boys”, we would not graduate because we would get a failing
grade in phys-ed. We asked what we could do to turn it around, he said it
was too late. After 10 minutes of negotiating with our teacher, Jeff
convinced him that we would do anything he asked us to do until
graduation. Weill, Jeff managed to volunteer us to not only lead gym class
every day, but we both had to double every exercise that the rest of the
class did ... including track, Our gym teacher gave us “C” and we
graduated.
Eisenstein summarized the nature of his longstanding friendship with Jeffrey in the
following words:
Over the years, his genius has taken him to achieve levels of success
unattainable by anyone I’ve ever met. No matter how busy he ever is, no
matter where on earth he is, whenever I needed advise, or just talk to Jeff,
he was always there. As we’ve gotten older, our lives have become more
complicated, but we have never missed calling each other on our
birthdays. It’s a small, silly thing, but how many childhood friends do you
know, who have never forgotten your birthday? The most important thing
to me is that as vast a difference [as] our worlds are, our long-term, deep
seated friendship is the strongest lifelong friendship one could ever have;
it’s just not like recently acquired friends, business associates, or even
family. People who are fortunate to have these kind of friends are the only
ones who could comprehend this special relationship.
Jeffrey has had two long-term intimate relationships with women during his
adulthood. In about 1981, Jeffrey met Eva Andersson (now Andersson-Dubin), then 20,
who was a Swedish model and former Ms. Sweden. They developed a long and still
enduring friendship. The relationship endured for eleven years as an intimate one.
During that time, Jeffrey encouraged Eva to fulfill her dream of becoming a doctor. He
encouraged her and set about to pay her expenses at medical school in Sweden. She
reported that he frequently flew over to see her and ensure that she was keeping up with
her studies. When she continued her medical studies in California, Jeffrey was there to
. cheer her on and pay her expenses. She successfully completed medical school and
presently works in New York City as a well-regarded internist.
