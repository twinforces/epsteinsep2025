I think, as you suggest, the defendant simply needs to finish his sentence as it was
agreed to in the initial resolution. Thanks. MM

This dragon just keeps raising its ugly head! May I tell him to just file his motion to
modify with the Court? I don’t know how to convey to him anymore than I already have that
his client is a registered sex offender that was fortunate to get the deal of the century,
fortunate enough, even as a sex offender, to be granted work release while serving his
jail sentences (I am not aware of that ever happening before) and certainly fortunate to
plea at a time when it was not required by statute that he be placed on sex offender
probation with all of the restrictive conditions that the vast majority of individuals in
his similar situation would have been subjected to. Please advise.

It is obvious you have spent a lot of time on my request for my client and I. sincerely
appreciate the thoroughness and the attention. As my clients case seems to lend itself to
misunderstandings and miscommunications by others, I thought it important to clarify some
facts assumed in error.
I have spoken to Mr. Gaines at probation and he confirmed the following: Yes termination
of supervision on a sex offender is unusual, however a modification to probation from
Community control is not uncommon when the probationer has been in compliance without
violation. In fact the department’s current policy on re-entry to the community dictates
that an offender be stepped down as soon as possible. He was also under the
misimpression, as others might have been, that Epstein’s charges called for sex offender
probation. They do not, he is eligible for normal probation. As with many of the issues
in my clients case, sterile questions that may have been asked tend to lead to answers
that though well meaning are not applicable.
As for the timeliness of the police reports of the attempted breakins, I wanted you to be
aware that I confirmed with Wackenhut that they called the police each time and spoke to
the captain on duty, there should be a record. I said to you it was my advice to the
client that he not file a formal report.
