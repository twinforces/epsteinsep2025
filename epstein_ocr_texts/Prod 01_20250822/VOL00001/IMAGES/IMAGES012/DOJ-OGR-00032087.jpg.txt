THINGS may be turning sour for gal-about-town Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the fat and fraudulent former
owner of the Daily News, the late Robert Maxwell. | hear that some of the 39-year-old Ghislaine's friends on the
Manhattan and London party circuit are cutting her because she's had so much adverse press over her
relationship with Prince Andrew, Fergie's ex, with whom she recently attended a downtown S&M-themed party.
Her relationship with "Randy Andy" is said to be platonic, but the socially prominent women in Ghislaine's â€œset"
have recently sworn off any kind of publicity. A series of lacerating articles - and the publication of the vapid
"Bright Young Things," written by one of their own, Brooke de Ocampo - has portrayed this crowd as a bunch of
twits living off their trust funds.
Ghislaine's own funds are something of a mystery. Her father lavished money on her and set her up in at least
one business in New York. But Maxwell's own ill-gotten gains were seized after he took a dive off his yacht,
which was named for her. There are plenty of British pensioners who lost their only means of support in the
crash of Maxwell's house of cards and who find it obscene that Ghislaine manages to own an apartment on the
Upper East Side and a mews house in London.
She is said to be on some kind of retainer from mysterious New York financier Jeffrey Epstein, who reportedly
has holdings in several major companies. Epstein also likes the company of attractive young women, and it's
said that Ghislaine has been very good about introducing him to some of her pals.
Ghislaine and her two elder sisters don't talk about where their money is coming from, but they are said to be
heavily involved in some kind of Internet company. It would be awful luck for Ghislaine if her social standing
were diminished at the same time as tech stocks are going down the toilet.
