rough times
Current mood: & sad
Everything sucks right now,
My best-friend's dad passed away and I had to come
back to cooper city to visit her. (I grew up here.)
The funeral was today. I couldnt look at him laying
in the coffin. I saw the top if his head but it already
looked 'not so good' so I decided not to try and see
the rest. Robyn's father's family didn't console her or
her younger brother at all. They're assholes. Thank
God she has me. I hope everything ends up being
okay. I've had a really rough week. I've been
Snapping at everyone I care about. I feel emotionally
stressed. I'm going through a really tough time.
There's been so much death around me. It's really
overwhelming.
