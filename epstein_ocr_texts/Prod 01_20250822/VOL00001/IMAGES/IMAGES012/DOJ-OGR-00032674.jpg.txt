2 “Z Well, there’s a couple things, things that I found by myself, things

3 that I’ve looked up on the internet. Um, what he specifically told

= me when I asked him the first time was “Oh I’m a brain scientist’

3 and | said what the fuck is a brain scientist? I was like that’s not a

6 real job you’re like tell me the truth but anyway I took that as he,

7 he told me his explanation was ‘It’s my job to know how people’s

8 brains work’ and I said, whatever the fuck that means, whatever,

9 you know you’re just some old guy, and I went home. And then I
10 looked up on the internet, um, about him and he was apparently an
11 invest an he works for a financial firm and he would invest other
12 people’s money, like people sign their fortunes over to him he
13 invests it and he gets commissions off of the money that they
14 make, Umm and then he just takes, I know that he himself besides
15 investing other people’s fortunes you know he’s invested all his
16 money he owns tons of companies, umm sponsors sports teams,

30 school. | filled out my application and he told me that it wasn’t
31 good enough. And, so I filled it out again and it was like three
| 32 times so I’m pretty sure he wasn’t checking into it he was just
33 telling me that he was. But I think that has a lot to do with the
34 reason I stayed there so long. Cause my dream was like right in
| ao front of me, you know. It was so close.

37 DETECTIVE: Aside from having been with Na, uh, Nada or Nadia um was there
38 anybody else that you brought to the house?
39
40 a I brought a few people. Um, I brought , She
