4. Broken “Sex Toys” in Epstein’s Trash, The Police Report details
the police “discovery” in Epstein’s trash of what is described as pieces of “sex
toys” and makes the point that these materials corroborate witness statements.
Omitted from both the Police Report and the Probable Cause Affidavits is the fact
that during the course of executing the search warrant on Epstein’s home, the
police realized that a key “sex toy” was in fact the entirely innocent broken handle
of a salad server. Though the “sex toys” play a prominent role in the Police Report
and Probable Cause Affidavits, the Police Report was never amended to reflect the
discovery of this new and highly relevant evidence.

i Polygraph Examination and Report. The State Attorney was
provided with a report of a polygraph examination of Epstein and the polygraph
examiner was subsequently interviewed by the State Attorney. The polygraph
exam focused on the allegations being made with respect to Ps 11
report confirmed that (a) no sexual conduct occurred; (b) Epstein never threatened

ps (¢) 8 told Epstein she was 18 years old; and (d) Epstein
believed jg Was 18 years old. Though these results were provided to the
Police Department and Detective Recarey was given an opportunity to meet with
the polygraph examiner, after confirming that he would attend he inexplicably
failed to appear or to send a representative in his place. No information
concerning the fact of the exam appeared in the Police Report or the Probable
Cause Affidavits.

6. Meetings with the State Attorney. Attorneys for Epstein provided
other information to the State Attorney, as well. Though clearly material, virtually
none of it was included in the Police Report. For example, at the meeting at which
the polygraph expert was made available for questioning, the psychiatrist who
conducted a psycho-sexual examine of Epstein (and who concluded he was
healthy) was also made available to discuss his evaluation. Also provided at the
meeting was information concerning EE MySpace website profile,
including her false representations that she was 18 and nude and otherwise
provocative photos that she chose to use to represent herself to the public. After
