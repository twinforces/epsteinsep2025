Re: State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 2006CF009454A XX
Dear Ms. Belolavek:
Po was apparently served with the attached subpoena sometime last week.
It is a Subpoena for Deposition tqguyes who is not presently residing with ___<l. I
attempted to contact you today to discuss this matter, unsuccessfully. The deposition is
scheduled for February 6 at 9:30 a.m. It is my understanding that __ is not aware of this
subpoena and will not be appearing for the deposition. In addition, I do not know that service of
the subpoena on ft is sufficient for because she does not reside with him.
Mr. Epstein’s counsel Jack Goldberger is aware that I represent a. a
civil claim filed on behalf of his daughter ~ “_ [| however, he did not send me a copy of the
notice or subpoena for deposition, nor did he contact me to coordinate same. In the future, I
would appreciate if your office and Mr. Goldberger’s office would keep me in the loop on the
scheduling of the depositions for the I. ‘amily.
Thank you for your assistance in this regard.
Very truly yours,
66 Heren/y yn
Jeffrey Herman
