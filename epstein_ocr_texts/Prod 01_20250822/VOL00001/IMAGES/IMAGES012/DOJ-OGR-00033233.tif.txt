attend a college of his choice when the time comes. I would not have been
able to [do] this if it wasn’t for Mr. Epstein.
Another example is that of a building worker named Philip Diaz whom Jeffrey is putting
through vocational school in heating, refrigeration, and air conditioning. Mr. Indyke
related that Jeffrey also takes time from his otherwise hectic schedule to meet with and
mentor Mr. Diaz.

A final education example was related by David Lambert, an employee:

While working late, after normal business hours, I have developed a
relationship with the cleaning man who details our office space. Alfredo
and I reflect life’s issues and family matters as best fas] a Colombian and
English speaking friend may, but it takes us deep and a look or gesture
speaks louder than words at times. One night our sign language, broken
English and Spanish went to the topic of his oldest daughter attending
college. Alfredo told me how proud he is of her attending college. “Me
daughter, she very, very happy.” I could see the emotion in his eyes which
led to the words spoken loudly, clearly, and emphatically “... because,
Mister Jeffrey.” After many such conversations with Alfredo it’s clear to
me he was angst ridden for his children, not being able to provide the
dream of a college level education, his children aware and sad of such

‘ man. This is what my provider, Jeffrey Epstein, does for people. If he is
aware of human suffering he will act quickly, generously, and without
thought. Then he will walk away. His goal has been achieved and a life's
crisis avoided, human suffering eliminated.

Jeffrey is also aware that tragedy is a part of the landscape that people have to
face and address. When he learns of employees facing such life critical events, he brings
the same virtues, ie., empathy, a determination to identify and solve the problem, and
generosity, which he uses in other areas of his life, to bear on the problem. Mr. Indyke
faced one such problem, and his recollection of it is worth quoting at length:

Shortly after I began working for Jeffrey, I experienced a personal and

unexpected tragedy. After five years of marriage, my wife and I learned
that I was infertile and we could not have children in the traditional

manner. The recommended treatment protocol required my wife and I to

undergo prohibitively expensive in-vitro fertilization cycles, which we

could not afford and which were not then covered by the company’s

medical insurance.

I meekly approached Jeffrey and asked him if it would be possible to drop

my wife and me from the company’s medical policy in exchange for a
