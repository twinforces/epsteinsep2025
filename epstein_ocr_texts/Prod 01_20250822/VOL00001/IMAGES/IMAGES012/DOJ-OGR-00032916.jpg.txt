Venero stated she only provided massages for Epstein and his
associates and nothing happened during those massages. Venero stated
as she does Swedish style massages, the patient is usually sore after
the massages. I thanked her for her assistance and the interview was
concluded at this time.
I received a facsimile from T-Mobile Cellular service on telephone
number 561-317-5844, which is assigned to David Rodgers, pilot for Mr.
Epstein, who resides in Lake Worth. Rodgers' telephone number was
dialed on several occasions by Sarah Kellen. A background on Rodgers
indicated he has a valid FAA pilot license First Class for the
Southern FAA Region. Rodgers has another historical FAA license for
Airline Transport Pilot.
Investigation Continues.

On Friday, February 3, 2006, I had made arrangements to meet with
Joanna Harrison at the Palm Beach Police Station. At approximately
1:00pm, Harrison and her friend, Victoria Bean arrived at the police
station. During an interview with Harrison, she stated she met
Epstein when she turned eighteen years old and was brought to
Epstein's house to provide a massage. She advised this occurred on
May of 2005. She advised Haley Robson had informed her if she wanted
to provide a massage for $200.00. Harrison agreed and was brought to
Epstein's house to provide a massage. Harrison stated she had been to
the house on many occasions during the massage sessions. Harrison
also stated she would remove her clothing to provide the massage on
Epstein. Harrison advised Epstein would pay her $300.00 to rub his
back, legs and chest. During the massages, Epstein would masturbate
himself as she rubbed his chest. I asked her if Epstein ever touched
her breasts during the massages. Harrison replied. "Yes." I asked her
| if Epstein ever touched or massaged her vagina. Harrison stated he
| had on several occasions. I asked her if he ever penetrated her with
either his penis or any other objects. Harrison stated that during a
massage he inserted his fingers in her vagina as she massaged him.
She stated this occurred one time only. Harrison stated the massage
would be over when Epstein would climax onto a towel. I asked
Harrison if she had any formal massage training to which she replied
that she did not. Harrison was then asked if she ever brought anyone
to the house to "work." Harrison stated she brought two people to the
house. She advised she received money for bringing people to the
house to "work." Harrison stated she brought a girl named "" | " and
her friend Tory Bean. Bean was still waiting for Harrison in the
lobby of the police station. I thanked Harrison for her time and her
cooperation and escorted her to the lobby.
I asked Ms Bean if I could speak with her about this investigation. I
