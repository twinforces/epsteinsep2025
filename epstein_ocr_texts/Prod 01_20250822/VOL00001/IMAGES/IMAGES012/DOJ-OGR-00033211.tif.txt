II. Unreported Criminal Histories and Mental Health Problems of the Witnesses
Relied on in the Police Report and Probable Cause Affidavits.

Virtually every witness relied on to support the Police Report and the probable
cause affidavit has a background that casts significant doubt on whether the
witness is sufficiently credible to support a finding of probable cause, let alone to
sustain what would be the State’s burden of proof at a trial. (Indeed, nearly all the
witnesses, and certainly those deemed complainants, were friends, which
undercuts any claim that one story corroborates another.) Though this evidence
was submitted to the PBPD, none of it was included in the Police Report, the
probable cause affidavit, or released to the public. Below we address solely the
omitted criminal histories. Following that, we list other factors that make each
witness unworthy of belief and incapable of withstanding cross-examination at
trial — all of which was previously provided to the PBPD but omitted from the
Police Report, the probable cause affidavit and the public disclosure.

6. Juan Alessi: While the Police Report (at page 57) and the probable cause
affidavit (at page 21) contain assertions by Alessi which allegedly support the
bringing of criminal charges, omitted is the evidence revealing Alessi’s
evident mental instability; prior criminal conduct against Epstein; and bias
towards Epstein. As the PBPD well knew, in 2003, Alessi was filmed taking
money from Epstein’s home. After being caught on videotape unlawfully
entering Epstein’s home and stealing cash from a briefcase, Alessi admitted to
the PBPD that he entered the house unlawfully on numerous occasions,
stealing cash and attempting to steal Epstein’s licensed handgun (which in fact
went missing). Officers assigned to the investigation prepared a report
detailing Alessi’s confession. Also known to the PBPD, but omitted from the
Police Report, is that Alessi claimed he intended to steal the gun in order to
kill himself. Though this information is clearly material to any determination
of credibility, and was specifically known to Det. Recarey at the time the
Police Report and probable cause affidavits were written, it was omitted.

7. Po While the Police Report and probable cause affidavit rely
on statements of MM the father of omitted is
evidence, known to the PBPD, that casts doubt on credibility and
sustainability as a witness. Omitted from the Police Report and probable
cause affidavit is Federal fraud conviction, which defense
investigators discovered and turned over to the PBPD during the course of the
investigation. a cved 21 months in federal prison for his offense.

8. perce, MLC Report and probable cause affidavit rely on
statements of the step-mother of Po omitted is
evidence, known to the PBPD that casts doubt on her credibility. Omitted
from the Police Report and the probable cause affidavit ‘Sit state
conviction for identity fraud — criminal use of identification information. This
information, uncovered by defense investigators, was also turned over to the
PBPD during the course of the investigation.
