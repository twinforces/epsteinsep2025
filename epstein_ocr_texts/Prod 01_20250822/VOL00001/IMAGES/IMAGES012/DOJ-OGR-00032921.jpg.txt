Atty Guy Fronstin and acknowledged the deal made between them.
Fronstin stated in the message, he spoke with his client, Jeffrey
Epstein, and agreed to the deal. Fronstin asked to call off the grand
jury as they would accept this deal. Belohlavic stated a probable
cause would be needed to book Epstein in the county jail and would let
me know as to when it would be needed. I explained my disapproval of
the deal and not being consulted prior to the deal being offered.
However I expressed that was only my opinion and the final approval
would come from the Chief of Police. She explained to have Chief
Reiter call Barry Krisher about the deal. I left the area and
returned to the police station where I briefed the Chief about the
deal offered.
I checked my voice mail messages and discovered a message from Jj
stepmother for the victim Jj She was calling because the State
Attorney's Office still had not returned any of her calls as to when
they are needed for this case. I then called ASA Belohlavic's office
and left messages for her to call the victims on this case and |
explained to them what the State Attorney's Office had done.
On April 17, 2006, at approximately 4:30 pm, State Attorney
Investigator Tim Valentine called to officially notify me of the
cancellation of the Grand Jury. He requested I contact the victims
that had been served to appear, to notify them of the cancellation. I
advised Valentine that as this Grand Jury session was called based on
the State Attorney's Office decision to have the victims heard by the
Grand Jury that I felt it was the States Attorney's Office
responsibility to contact the victims and advise them of the reason
they were no longer needed.
