‘ase No. . . . : 1-05-000368 (Continued)

On 102005 at approx 0930hrs I assisted with the execution of a ;
search warrant at 358 El Brillo Ave, Palm Beach.

. Initially I was assigned to enter the residence and conduct a
sweep of the premises for safety purposes. I then accompanied CSEU
tech Pavlik while she photographed the exterior of the house. Once
this was complete I was assigned to search certain areas of the house
with Det. Dawson as part of the search warrant.

We began in the garage, searching three Mercedes Benz vehicles, a
Harley Davidson motorcycle and adjacent closets in the garage.

Nothing of evidentiary value was located.

“We then searched two closets off the kitchen area on the east
side. These can best be described as pantry or storage closets.
Nothing of evidentiary value was obtained.

A small office with adjoining bath was then searched. In the bath
area I located a phone message book with recent messages. This item
was seized as evidence. Please note this bath and shower area are not
used as designed but are storage areas containing a variety of items
to include a gun safe in the shower and assorted household items.

We then searched a bath area and closet at the base of the main
stairs in the foyer. Inside the closet two massage tables were
located as well as partial nude female photographs. These items were
later seized as evidence. Nothing of evidentiary value was noted in
the bathroom.

We then searched two bedrooms upstairs on the east side of the
residence. Located in the bath room of the south bedroom was penis |
shaped soap. Located in the bedroom of the northern bedroom was penis
and vagina shaped soap as well as an adult sex toy. These items were
seized as evidence.

We then searched the pool cabana located in the south west corner
of the property. Several photographs of nude females were seized as
evidence.

I was then assigned to stand by with a person I believe was
Douglas Schoettle. Mr. Schoettle was in the residence at the
beginning of the search warrant. He was present during the warrant
service and subsequent search. I stood by with him until the search
was completed and I departed the residence. I had no conversation
with him regarding the reason for our presence.

Regarding seized evidence, all items were photographed in place
and then collected by CSEU personnel.

This concludes my involvement in this case.
