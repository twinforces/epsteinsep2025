1 was, Nadia had a red one, and that didn’t vibrate. Then, strap-ons

4. DETECTIVE: //Okay.
5
6 a Like, any toy you can think of he used on me.
7
8 DETECTIVE: Okay.
9
ii” And, I’m not, definitely not by my choice, it was like, oh it’s there
11 and it’s happening now. I think.
IZ
13 DETECTIVE: Okay. Did you ever stop him, say hey listen, I’m not, I’m not good
14 with that?
15
16 P| Yeah, yeah, definitely. Before I let him um, like before things
17 progressed where I would let him touch me, I would not let him do
18 anything to me, even with stuff that wasn’t attached to his body. I
19 said no for a very long time until he upped it by like a hundred or
20 two hundred dollars, you know?
21
22 DETECTIVE: Okay.
23
a [sighs]
25
26 DETECTIVE: When you’re saying strap-on, did he use the strap-on?
27
28 po No, but he probably would need to. Um, sorry, I’m just trying to
ZY make myself feel a little bit better. Um, well I don’t know if you
30 would count like him, he never actually put it on, but it was him
31 me and Nadia in the bedroom, and we were all in bed together, and
32 I was messing around with her, you know, and he was watching,
33 and
34
35 DETECTIVE: At his request?
36
aT P| Every time except one time was at his request. The time that it
38 was not his request was on his birthday. And instead of getting
39 paid three hundred dollars, I got paid like five, six hundred dollars.
40 Um, it was a gift, I guess you could call it a gift from me and
4] Nadia. Um, we went shopping at this like sex place on
42 Okeechobee [ph], and um we bought a bunch of stuff and then we
43 just went at it in front of him. And, I don’t know. It’s not like I
44 was enjoying it either, like in my mind I’m like ‘Oh god, when this
45 is over, you’re getting so much money.’ Like that’s what I would
46 think of, I’d just close my eyes and think of something else.
