events are described by || Detective Recarey cited to support a claim that
displayed in the house were photos of and Marcinkova having sex. That is
contradicted by the recording

ME Detective Recarey also reported that {ill stated that on one occasion she

“continued rubbing his legs, thigh, and feet. .. . [and then Epstein] turned over
onto his back. She continued to rub his legs with oils. Epstein touched her breasts
and began to masturbate”. (Police Report at 40). That “episode” appears to be
synthesized from reports of two separate incidents. However, concerning neither
did Milf make mention of rubbing Epstein’s legs, thighs, and feet or of Epstein
turning over onto his back. Nor did she allege that Epstein masturbated while
touching her breasts. Detective Recarey also claims (Police Report at 40) that
during the sworn statement said “Epstein had purchased [Marcinkova] from
her family in Yugoslavia . . . [and] bragged he brought her to the United States to
be his Yugoslavian sex slave”. No such statement is made by , who refers to
Marcinkova as Epstein’s “girlfriend” and refers offhandedly to other women in the
home as “slaves”.

Nor did Detective Recarey include admission that on one occasion
she engaged in sexual conduct with Epstein’s girlfriend as a birthday “gift” to
Epstein. Neither is attention paid in the Probable Cause Affidavits of the fact that

WE naintained a MySpace webpage in which she admitted to various criminal
and dishonest acts, including creating false references for her work and her
extensive drug use.' Nor does Detective Recarey include that refused to
discuss the disposition of the thousands of dollars she said she was given by
Epstein. (Transcript at 31). Or that she falsely claimed not to use drugs (id.)

| despite her MySpace entries that scream “I can’t wait to buy some weed! !!!!!!”.
Finally, Recarey knew that =~ was not to be believed when she claimed she had
been given a car by Epstein because when preparing the Probablt Cause Affidavits
* A fleeting reference can be found in the Police Report (at 67), however, her marijuana use is only
generally noted and no mention is made of her other admitted or proven dishonest conduct, including the
report of her thefts from her employer.
