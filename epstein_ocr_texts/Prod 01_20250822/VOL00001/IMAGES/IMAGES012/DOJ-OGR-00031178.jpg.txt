Probable Cause Affidavit

Agency ORI# FLO 500600

As the interview was concluded and Robson was being taken home, a tape recorder was placed within
the vehicle to record any conversations made within the vehicle. During the drive back to her home, Robson
made the comment “ I’m like a Heidi Fliess”. (Hollywood Madam who sent girls to clients for sexual favors in
California). Robson was dropped off at her house without incident.

On November 7, 2005, I made contact with fF at her home. During a sworn taped
statement EEEtated she met Jeffrey Epstein through Haley Robson. Robson would approach females who
wished to work for him. stated she was offered to work for him but declined. BE. «tained that
“work” means give massages. She was asked about any formal training in providing massages which she said no.

said she accompanied Robson and other females who taken to Epstein’s house to provide massages.
further stated she had been to the house approximately 4 or 5 times in the past year. Each time any girl
was taken to Epsteins house, they were previously told they would have to provide a massage, possibly naked.
It was also told that should Epstein require them to do anything extra, and they were not comfortable with the
request, just to tell him and he would stop. PE stated Robson received $200.00 for each girl she brought
over to massage Jeffrey Epstein. When I asked which girl appeared to be the youngest, she replied, the victim,
= stated she looked really young, fifteen years old at the most. GRIN further stated she did not know
the victim personally stated she only went to the house to accompany Robson.

As Robson knowing the age of the victim, solicited the victim to commit a lewd a lascivious act and

based on the above facts, I have sufficient probable cause to arrest Haley Robson for Lewd and Lascivious Acts
to a victim under the age of 16.
