14
15 DETECTIVE: Was this after you graduated from high school, or

18 for me. He wanted more than I was willing to give. I didn’t

38 money as I asked him for, he doesn’t know that I hate him the way
39 Ido. I kept that connection. I figured he used me, I’d be able to
40 use him. Um, I| hate to say that but I figured if | wanted to use him
4] I could.
