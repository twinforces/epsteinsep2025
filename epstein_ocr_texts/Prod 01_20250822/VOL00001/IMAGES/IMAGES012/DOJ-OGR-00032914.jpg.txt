On January 25, 2006, Det Caristo and I, responded to 3307 Baltusrol
Lane in Lake Worth and met with AT ton stated last
year, when she was seventeen years of age, she met Jeffrey Epstein
through her former room mate Dana Burns. Burns was allegedly dating
Epstein at the time. Burns and Eaton had once cohabitated together
when they modeled. Eaton explained Burns called her on her telephone
and advised her that she was in Palm Beach and requested to see her.
Eaton made arrangements to meet with her at Epstein's house. Eaton
arrived and met Epstein and Burns. Burns and Eaton went to the Palm
Beach Mall together and went shopping. Eaton advised that Burns and
she had received money from Epstein to go to the mall. They visited
Victoria's Secret and purchased undergarments from the store utilizing
monies given by Epstein. Eaton advised she purchased one item and
Burns purchase various items. The money used to purchase the items
was the money given by Epstein.
Burns and Eaton continued shopping and having a day together. Eaton
stated Burns explained how she and Epstein have been dating each other
and he has been paying all of her bills. Eaton claimed Burns advised
they met in New York and had been dating ever since. They later
returned to Epstein's home and encountered Epstein. He had a brief
conversation with Eaton about her modeling career. He knew of her
modeling career from Burns. He requested to see her modeling
portfolio and explained that he could help her with modeling jobs.
Eaton had her book with her to show Burns and showed the book to
Epstein. He commented negatively about her photographs and portfolio.
| Eaton felt uncomfortable with the comments made as she had been
working with other professional modeling companies who had offered her
work from her photographs. Epstein requested to see what was
purchased at the mall. Burns took out the undergarments which were
purchased. She immediately showed Epstein different sets purchased.
Epstein then requested to view what Eaton purchased. Eaton was
reluctant to show the outfit however since it was Epstein's money that
purchased the item, she pulled it out of the bag. Epstein asked her
to try it on. Eaton looked at Burns who told her "yeah, try it on."
Feeling compelled to try the undergarment outfit on; she went to
another room and put on the bra and panty set. She walked out to the
living room where they were sitting, and modeled the suit. She then
went back into the other room and changed back into her clothes.
Eaton returned into the room and told Burns she would be going home.
Burns scheduled another day for Eaton to return for massages with her.
Eaton stated within that same week, she returned to meet with Burns
and have a massage. Burns had told her that she would be unable to
stay with her as she would be going on a bike ride with Epstein.
Burns explained she could stay at the house and take advantage of the
massage.
