was employed at ie Florida. On October 28, 2005,
some three days re was caught by a
manager asi attempte to leave the store with merchandise in her purse,
the security tag still attached. (According to a report of the incident iil
found “kneeling on the floor digging through her purse”. As the manager
approached, MMMM‘pulled out a pair of black SLT panties that had the sensor
on them”.) Seeing the manager, WM claimed “someone is trying to set me
up”. Following an internal investigation, which disclosed additional thefts
from both the store and a customer, she was fired. (In addition to the theft
above, she was seen by co-workers with store merchandise in her car; she was
believed to have engaged in a fraudulent “return scheme”; and she obtained a
pair of shoes from another store in the same mall by exchanging them for a
pair of just purchased men’s shoes inadvertently left behind by a customer).
In a recorded interview by a Loss Prevention manager, BM admitted to
merchandise theft of $209 [and asserted] “that her reason for stealing was that
she understood she was not getting paid enough and was struggling
financially”. This information and supporting documentation was duly
presented to the PBPD, but was never included in the Police Report or
probable cause affidavit, and never released to the public.
