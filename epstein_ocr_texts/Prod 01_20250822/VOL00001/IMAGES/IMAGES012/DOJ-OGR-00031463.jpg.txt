On Monday, 10/13/03, at 2:00 p.m., Mr. Jeffrey Epstein came into
the police department and informed me that earlier today he met
with his former houseman Juan Alessi at Green's Pharmacy in Palm
Beach. Epstein stated that he presented Alessi with a photograph
obtained off the video surveillance system, whereby Alessi
admitted to breaking into the house and taking the money. Alessi
told Epstein that he broke into the house to take a gun that
Epstein usually keeps behind his desk. He could not find the
gun so he took the money. Alessi said he and his wife are having
problems and they no longer live together. He wanted the gun
because he was contemplating suicide.
( Epstein stated that Alessi has already returned $2,000. of the
stolen money and that he will be making arrangements with Alessi
to pay off the remaining funds. I asked Epstein if he knew of
Alessi's current address or phone number and Epstein said that
Alessi was going to call him at 5:00 p.m. today and he would
make arrangements for Alessi to come into the police station to
be interviewed. Epstein stated he no longer wants to prosecute
Alessi but is concerned over the fact that the gun Alessi said
he broke into the house to steal is still missing, yet Alessi
said he does not have it.
ATTN POLICE CLERKS: As Alessi has returned $2,000. to Epstein
and arrangements have been made for the return of the rest of
the money, please show a full recovery of the $2700. cash. **
