webpage, the photo hose to represent her, is that of a naked girl
(presumably provocatively lying on the beach. As late as July
2006, well after commencement of the PBPD investigation iii was
(evidently) falsely representing herself on the website as being 18 years old.
This evidently false representation corroborates in’'s assertions
(confirmed by the polygraph examination), that ii cisco,
represented to Epstein that she was 18 years old. The illuminating webpage
also contains ne that of all her body parts, she “love[s] her
ass”, she drinks to excess, smokes, uses drugs, “gets into trouble”, has beaten
someone up, has shoplifted “lots”, “already lost” her virginity, earns
“$250,000 and higher”, and has no regrets in life because “you only live once”.
As with the other impeaching information, this material, vital to determining
credibility, was provided by the defense to the PBPD but was never included
in the Police Report or probable cause affidavit and never released to the
public with the other details of the case.

or the probable cause affidavit or released to the public.

21. Juan Alessi Lied . Alessi is significant, of course, because the Police Report
includes a statement by Alessi that “the bed would almost always have to be
made after the massage[s]” (at page 57). The implication being that Epstein
