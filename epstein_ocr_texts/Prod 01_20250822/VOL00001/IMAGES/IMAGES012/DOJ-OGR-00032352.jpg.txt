Case No. .. . : 1-05-000368 (Continued)
was the telephone number for Haley Robson during the time frame when
the victim, §§vas brought to the Epstein house to "work." An
analysis of the phone records, of all incoming and outgoing calls,
showed that on February 6, 2005, the day the victim, Sa 2: brought
to the house, Robson first called Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant,
at 917-855-3363at 12:50 pm (EST). The next call was made to Epstein's
house in Palm Beach, at 12:52 pm (EST). The following call was made
to the victim, Jet 1:01 pm (EST) and at 1:02 pm (EST). This
confirms the information provided by the victim and victim's father.
I photo copied the records and enlarged the page 8 of 10 to show the
calls made by Robson on February 6, 2005.
To this date, I have not heard from PE 2-2: ail
will attempt to establish contact with them during the evening hours.
I received a package from Atty. Guy Fronstin, which was hand
delivered at the police station. Within the package, was a letter
from Alan Dershowitz, and two www.myspace.com profiles. The profiles
were that of —~ : . and ... __, -~_._._. MySpace.com is a social
networking service that allows members to create unique personal
profiles online in order to find and communicate with old and new
friends. This package was in response to a previous meeting in which
Mr. Dershowitz called to assist in the investigation in providing any
additional witnesses such as house employees who have been reluctant
to speak with law enforcement.
I reviewed the profiles Mr. Dershowitz enclosed. P| who designed
her blog to be NS 5t i] attends an
High School, sends and receives messages from friends which contain
some profanity. Upon reviewing her friends' comments section from
Myspace, most of her good friends sent messages to establish contact
and invite her to go out.
I then reviewed Mi web blog which was provided by Mr.
Dershowitz. Ms. ~~ designed her blog to be "PimpJuice." Her blog
states that her interests include music, theater and weed (Marijuana) .
I reviewed her packet in which Miiiiigeclares her love for her live-in
boyfriend. She also describes using marijuana with her boyfriend Will
Tucker.
The letter Mr. Dershowitz sent advised he was looking into the
allegation that one of the private investigators used by the private
attorneys of Epstein, attempted to impersonate or state that they were
police officers from Palm Beach. Mr. Dershowitz advised that the
investigators used to interview FS i stsi‘is@d had "quite a distinct
speech impediment", did not claim to be nor did they impersonate
themselves as a police officer. This package was sent to both ASA
Lana Belohlavic and ASA Daliah Weiss at the State Attorney's Office.
I made telephone contact with ASA Weiss to confirm she received the
package and request an interview with Sarah Kellen, Nada Marcinkova,
and Janusz Banasiak. She advised she would assist in attempting to
contact Mr. Dershowitz.
