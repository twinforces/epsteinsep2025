RE: Mr. Epstein
From Aileen Josephs, Esq.
Ms. Sanchez:
Women in our County have been watching this case with great
concern. I strongly suggest that you do not attack the victim(s). If you feel
your client is innocent, you can file a libel suit- of course, the truth is an
absolute defense to libel, and please keep in mind that not knowing the age
of a child is no defense to statutory rape or any sexual crime committed
against a child.
Sincerely,
Aileen Josephs, Esq.

Ms. La Tosha Lowe- request to place this letter in State’s file
