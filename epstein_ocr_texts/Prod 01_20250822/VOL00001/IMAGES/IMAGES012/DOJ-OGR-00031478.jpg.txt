Current mood: ®) pissed off :
fi forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at Victoria's Secret, They said they
suspected me of "causing losses to their company." -Which by the way is bullshit! I
was ‘by the book' on EVERYTHINGIJ!III!! I got so fed up in that office that I handed
the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE
zn MAN! I already have another job if I want it, and it's so much more money$$$$$$.
I'm going to be making more money than my old bosses at VS. Success is definately.
the sweetest revenge. ASSHOLES!!!!1T} a
