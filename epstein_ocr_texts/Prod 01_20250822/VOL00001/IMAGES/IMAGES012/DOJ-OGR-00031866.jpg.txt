Probable Cause Affidavit
Palm Beach Police Department
Agency ORI# FLO 500600
On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I responded to the address of Robson and viewed her vehicle parked in the
driveway. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were
investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she would
accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the
interview she would be returned home.
Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I
explained to Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to
leave at any time she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson
stated she understood. During the taped sworn interview Robson was asked how she became in contact with
Epstein. Robson stated back when she turned 17 years of age she was approached by a friend “Molly” in the
Canopy Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money. She was told she
would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. Robson thought about the offer and agreed to
meet with Jeffrey.
Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) picked her up and she was taken to Epstein’s
house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of the house. She was also
introduced to a white female known to her as Sara. She was led upstairs to the main bedroom known to her as
Jeff Epstein’s bedroom . Sara arranged the massage table and covered the table with a sheet. She brought out
the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sara, then left the room and informed her Jeff would be
in, ina minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He removed the towel and laid nude on the
massage table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson to rub on him.
During the massage, Robson stated “He tried to touch me and I stopped him.” I asked how did he tried to
touch her. He grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson also stated Epstein has a vibrator
which is large and white in color. Robson told Epstein, I’ll massage you but I don’t want to be touched.
Robson stated she performed the massage naked.
At the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.00 for the massage. He explained, I know you’re
not comfortable, but I’ll pay you if you bring some girls. He told her the younger the better. Robson stated she
once tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the female was too old. Robson was asked how
many girls did she bring in total to Epstein. Robson stated six that she can remember. Robson stated she had
brought the following girls: the victim,  exereremeararcon $I § (6 female), 6 female),
WE 20d at the time they were brought to Epstein’s house, all the girls were 14 through 16 years of age.
