l P| It was a little circle and then yeah one girl told oh I got Alex to do
2 this and then you know. He, not that I would want anybody to get
3 involved in this but I brought girls I didn’t like and really frankly
4 did not give a shit about. Girls that I knew were skanks that would
5 do anything. Who, like, girls that would just like suck dick in the
6 bathroom at school. Like not even people that I was friends with
7 I'd just hear a rumor about a girl and be like hey I know a way you
8 can make two hundred dollars. But I would tell them before they
9 went I would tell them flat out like this is what you gotta do, are
10 you cool with this cause I am not going to take you if you’re not.
1] And I told them, they all knew that I got paid to bring them. And
12 I, it Wages’, Mandy Biorklin. Mandy never did anything
13 though, she took off her shirt — she was a little overweight so he
14 didn’t want anything to do with [laughs], she was my best friend so
15 I you know she was another story, I did care about her but um she

27 regular thing, and she just took her shirt off. And then he said
28 ‘Okay well Millis gonna finish up here, do you want to go wait by
29 the pool’ and she went downstairs and went swimming and I was

39 probably two because it was her first time. The way it went was if
40 you worked there for the first like three times, you got paid two

45 dollars or I mean I got lots of gifts, like I got lots of stuff from this
| 46 guy. I don’t know.
