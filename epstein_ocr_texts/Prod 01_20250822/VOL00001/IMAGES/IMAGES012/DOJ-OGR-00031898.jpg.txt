Probable Cause Affidavit

Agency ORI# FLO 500600
While in the home, I observed the pink and green couch within the master bedroom area just as the girls
previously mentioned. The stair way which is located from the kitchen area to the master bedroom area is lined
with photos of naked young girls. Additionally, numerous photographs of naked young females were obtained
as they appeared to be photographs of the girls that had been at the house to provide massages. Various phone
message books were also taken in which his assistant had left messages for Epstein as to which girls were coming
to provide massages.
During the course of the investigation, It was determined that Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s assistant made the
arrangements to have girls come and “work” for Epstein. Kellen was aware of various ages of girls as she had
maintained contact with the girls that had been previously at the house. Additionally, there were various phone
messages left for Epstein by Kellen in which the message had made references such as “the girls would have to
come after they are released from school”.
Based on the facts, there is sufficient probable cause to charge Sarah Kellen for Principal in the 1* degree for
Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor 2 counts a second degree felony in direct violation of Florida State Statues
794.05(1) as she orchestrated the arrangement with Epstein and the masseuses in which Epstein had vaginal
intercourse with!” ~* and MMMM t should be noted that both girls were minors when this occurred. There is
sufficient probable cause to charge Sarah Kellen with Principal in the 1“' degree for Lewd and Lascivious
