spotlight and makes it clear that nothing in return is expected.
Jeffrey has also been an important benefactor to the Scholar Rescue Fund of the
Institute of International Education. This fund is designed to provide support and safe
haven to scholars who would otherwise be silenced, imprisoned, or even killed in such
places as Iraq, Iran, Rwanda, and Sudan. Jeffrey has also been one of the major sponsors

courage, dedication, and vision” to encourage them to pursue their chosen fields of
endeavor to make improvements in the world. Yet another example of Jeffrey’s
generosity in the educational arena arose during his trip through Africa with former
