2 DETECTIVE: Okay. Let’s get to the point where he’s actually inserting his, his
3 fingers inside you. Um, at what point, from when he started just
4 touching you to the point where he actually put his fingers inside
5 of you?
6
7 po He did that once in the beginning, and at the time I was, um, dating
8 somebody, and that person was aware of what I did. Um, and was
9 like — this person, by the way, who said this stuff that I’m about to
10 tell you is like now a crack-head, like on drugs, so they’re way
1] wack, they’re like crazy. And he was actually my boyfriend, he
12 goes ‘Oh I have no problem with it, as long as he’s not putting
13 anything inside of you.’

15 [First tape ends. ]

17 [Second tape begins. ]
18
19
20 i I wouldn’t let him put anything in me until one day he did just out
21 of nowhere. And I said wait a second my boyfriend, you know, we
22 had this thing, you can’t do that. You know, I’m, I’m allowed to
23 work here as long as you don’t do that. And he said ok. Well, a
24 couple months later I guess he assumed me and my boyfriend had
25 broken up, and he just did it one day, he just did it without asking
26 or anything. And then | said what are you doing I said you know
2? that’s not cool and he goes ‘Oh I thought we did that last time.’
28 And | said no we did not do that last time. And, then he goes, uh
29 and then he just offered me more money. He’s like, “Well why
30 don’t I just give you something extra and we can try this out.” And
| 31 I was like [sigh] all nght. Very hard guy to say no to. I don’t
| ae know if any of you guys ever talked to him.
33
| 34 DETECTIVE: Persistent.
35
36 P| Yeah.
37
38 - DETECTIVE: [ haven’t spoke with him but he is persistent from what | can tell.
39
40 P| //Qh, yeah. Well if you talk to him I mean he straight up tries to
4] control the situation. Every, every word that comes out of your
42 mouth it seems like he knows what you are going to say. Like,
43 that’s his job, that’s how he made his money is knowing what
44 people are gonna say and what people are gonna do.
45
46 DETECTIVE: What did he tell you he does for a living?
