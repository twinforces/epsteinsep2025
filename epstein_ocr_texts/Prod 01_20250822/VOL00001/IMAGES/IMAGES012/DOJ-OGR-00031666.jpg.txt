RE: Freedom of Information Request
Jeffrey Epstein Case
Case Number 2005CF009454A |
Dear Ms. Belohlavek:
Enclosed please find a copy of the Freedom of Information that was sent on
August 14, 2006 to the Public Information Department of the State Attorney’s Office and
pending there ever since.
I understand that at the moment the file cannot be released because it is still an
“active investigation”, yet all notices related to hearings on this case, or the dates,
time and place of the hearings for this case are public record, even if the decision to
postpone, cancel or change is done “orally” I was informed that the file in your office has
no record of this request to change the date of the scheduled plea conference of January
4, 2008. The Freedom of Information Act was created to ensure transparency from our
government officials and prevent sub rosa dealings.
I respectfully request that I be informed of the the hearing dates related to this
case. If the hearing date is changed “orally” [ respectfully request pursuant to this FOIA
that I still be contacted. It is imperative to ensure the trust that we have in your office
that hearings are public and that the public be given due notice of them, particularly when
a citizen pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act makes such a request.
Thank you.
