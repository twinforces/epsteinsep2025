On October 3, 2005, Sgt Frick and I responded to the address of Robson and viewed her vehicle parked in the
driveway. Sgt. Frick and I knocked on the door and met with Haley Robson. Robson was told that we were
investigating a claim involving Jeffrey Epstein of El Brillo in Palm Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to
accompany us back to the police station for further questioning. She was also told that at the conclusion of the
interview she would be returned home.
Upon Robson’s entry in the unmarked Detective vehicle, I placed a tape recorder within the vehicle to record any
conversations within the vehicle. During the ride back to the police station, Robson advised she is attending Palm
Beach Community College in the Palm Beach Gardens Campus and is majoring in journalism.
Upon our arrival at the police station, Robson was brought to the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I
explained to Robson, that I appreciated her willingness to assist us and informed her that should she desire to leave
at any time she may do so. I further explained the interview room door is only closed for privacy. Robson stated
she understood. During the taped sworn interview Robson was asked how she became in contact with Epstein.
Robson stated back when she turned 17 years of age she was approached by a friend “Molly” in the Canopy
Beach Resort in Rivera Beach. Robson was asked if she wanted to make money.
She was told she would have to provide a massage and should make $200.00. Robson thought about the offer
and agreed to meet with Jeffrey. Molly (Unknown last name) and Tony (Unknown last name) picked her up and
she was taken to Epstein’s house. Upon her arrival to the house she was introduced to Epstein in the kitchen of
the house. She was also introduced to a white female known to her as Sara. She was led upstairs to the main
bedroom known to her as JeffEpstein’s bedroom. Sara arranged the massage table and covered the table with
asheet. She brought out the massage oils and laid them next to the massage bed. Sara, then left the room and
informed her Jeff would be in, ina minute. Jeffentered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He laid on the table
onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated “He
| tried to touch me and I stopped him.” I asked how did he tried to touch her. He grabbed her buttocks and she
| felt uncomfortable. Robson also stated Epstein has a vibrator which is large and white in color. Robson told
Epstein, I’Jl massage you but I don’t want to be touched.
Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At the conclusion of the massage, Epstein paid Robson $200.00
for the massage. He explained, I know you’re not comfortable, but I’Il pay you if you bring some girls. He told
her the younger the better. Robson stated she once tried to bring a 23 year old female and Epstein stated that the
female was too old. Robson was asked how many girls did she bring in total to Epstein. Robson stated six that
she canremember. Robson stated she brought Rs
HS 200 at the time they were brought to Epstein’s house, all the girls were 14 through 16 years of age.
I asked Robson which one was the youngest. Robson advised the victim was the youngest as she was fourteen
when the massage occurred. Robson stated every girl she brought knew what to expect when they arrived. They
were told they would provide a massage, possibly naked, and some touching. I asked her if the victim was aware.
She stated every girl she brought knew what to expect. She explained she knew the victim wanted to make
money . She approached the victim and explained about going to work for Jeff. The victim agreed and
arrangements were made to bring the victim to Epstein’s house ona weekend. Robson stated that she and
