in 1991, Ghislaine reported that she had come to New York City at a very dark time of
her life. Her father, Robert Maxwell, a well-known publisher, had been found dead
floating in the Atlantic Ocean, having gone overboard from a yacht. Her two brothers
were involved in subsequent criminal proceedings related to the death, for which they
were eventually acquitted. Ghislaine had no close friends in New York City at the time.

Ghislaine met Jeffrey through mutual friends. She found the friendship
immediately rewarding, as he engaged her in intellectually stimulating conversation.

, Moreover, Jeffrey understood that there were few bright spots for her during that period,
and he never allowed her to become despondent. He understood that there were practical
things he could do for her. He gave her books to read — good novels, scientific studies ~
containing issues to challenge her mind. Then they would discuss the issues and, in the
process, take her outside of her personal concems. Jeffrey had the insight to take her to
comedy clubs on a weekly basis. This she found enormously palliative in relieving her
depression. She believes that without Jeffrey at that time, she would have likely fallen
into a deep depression.

Jeffrey also offered to arrange for Ghislaine to secure a loan that would help her
get a foothold in the business world. She explained that Jeffrey’s way of helping friends
with his money is always with a view toward maintaining their dignity. He would never
just give out money as it is too demeaning to the recipient. When he gives money to
people he does not know, it is always anonymously so that the recipient feels no need to
give it back. These gifts are meant to allow the recipient to continue the work that Jeffrey
finds interesting and useful. In the case of Ghislaine, Jeffrey arranged for the loan, which
she subsequently paid back. In this way, she was able to maintain her self-respect.

Over time, their relationship became intimate. However, as with Eva, it ended
amicably around 2000 upon the realization that the nature of the demands of his work,
i.e. the long hours and the frequent travel to maintain contacts around the world,
precluded a good married life with children. Ghislaine and Jeffrey remain friends to this
day. She wrote of their relationship:

My experience of Jeffrey, is of a thoughtful, kind, generous loving man,
with a keen sense of humor and a ready smile — a man of principles and
values and a man of his word. If he made a promise, he would always
follow through. In fact, I never saw him break a promise. He is
