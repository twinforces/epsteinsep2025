The Telephone Solicitation Act provides that consumers may register their telephone
numbers in a "No Sales Solicitation" list published by the Florida Department of
Agriculture and Consumer Services, Division of Consumer Services. There is an
initial fee of $10.00 for the first year of this service and $5.00 for every year
thereafter. With certain exemptions, telemarketers are prohibited from placing a
sales solicitation call to any number that appears on the Divisionâ€™s list or any
unlisted or unpublished telephone number.
