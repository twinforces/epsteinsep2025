On 08/21/09 I was assigned to obtain copies of the security
cameras and log in sheets for 1 Clearlake Plaza in West Palm
Beach, FL which is the business address for Jeffrey Epstein. On
08/21/09 I received the copies of the log in sheet and noted that
Mr. Epstein’s name does not appear on the log in sheet which he
would only be required to do if he were in the building after
1900 per the Property Manager, Mrs. Michelle Horn.

On 08/24/09 I received the security camera videos which were
formatted to DVD. I could not discern Mr. Epstein on the CD’s but
the camera angle is poor and does not allow one to see the entire
area, just the door area.

The DVD’s and Log In Sheets were TOT ASA Burns per her
request.
