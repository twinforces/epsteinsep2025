2 621 2005 Go I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for in Jan. 5. I'm
packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making
me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so
weird not having my best friend with me. I don't

deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling
20 different emotions and I have no idea how to deal
with it.
