Edmondson said Krischer's office reviewed the police evidence and decided to
investigate further.
"The prosecutor looks at the witnesses and physical evidence from a broader view,”
Edmondson said. "Because of the nature of the allegations, in particular the lengthy
sexual activity on part of the individuals and elements of financial reward to the
individuals, the case was referred to the grand jury. The grand jury heard from law-
enforcement officials and witnesses and reviewed all of the evidence before determining
that the appropriate charge was felony solicitation of prostitution.”
