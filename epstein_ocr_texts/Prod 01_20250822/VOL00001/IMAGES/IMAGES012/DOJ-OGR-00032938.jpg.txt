NOTES/COMMENTS; “y
Jeffrey,
Attached is a schedule comparing the valuc of the Managed Properties as of 1/1/2002 ani!
the estimated value as of 12/31/2004, including the calculation of the Performance Fee.
Regarding your request for the value of the Exchaded Properties as of 1/1/2002, the E&'”
appraisal done in 2001 only inchided “Managed Properties”. Approximately 1,000 acres wes':
not inchided im the E & Y appraisal because they were identified before the appraisal 2;
Excluded Properties. In addition, a significant portion of the acres (approximately 100()1
included in the appraisal were transferred to Excluded Properties before the Beginning Valu :
was finalized. If you would like me to prepare an estimate the value of the Exclndei!
Properties as of 1/1/2002 please let me know.
