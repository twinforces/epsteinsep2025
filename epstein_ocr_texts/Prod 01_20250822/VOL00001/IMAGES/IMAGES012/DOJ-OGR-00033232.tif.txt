Lesley Groff, a personal assistant to Jeffrey, reported a number of
accommodations Jeffrey has made, i.e., purchase of a vehicle for her
commute, extended maternity leave, a reduced work week and permission
to work from home, which have strengthened her family life.
Lauren Kwintner, another New York City-based employee, told of
accommodations from 2003 to 2005 that Jeffrey made for her to attend to
her father, who had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, at both ,
Sloane Kettering Memorial Hospital and subsequently the Hospital for
Joint Diseases, until his passing.
Bella Klein, also a New York City-based employee, was a single mother
whose son was accepted to Cornell University; Jeffrey has paid up to 70%
of his tuition expenses; the son now has his Master’s Degree and is
working on his Ph.D.
Harry Beller, a sixteen-year employee, is an orthodox Jew who is required
to be home prior to sundown on Fridays and on al! Jewish holidays.
Jeffrey has always accommodated his religious commitments, on occasion
permitting pressing Friday transactions to take place on the following
Monday. Mr. Beller also told of Jeffrey’s assistance in making available
any of his contacts in the medical field and to take any necessary time off
when one of his sons was diagnosed with Retinoblastoma.
Jeffrey has been especially generous in funding the educational pursuits of his
employees (and their family members) as a way of assisting them to better themselves
and achieve their full potential. Mr. Indyke has written that over the last six years,
Jeffrey has funded literally hundreds of thousands of dollars in tuition assistance to many
individuals (some of whom Jeffrey has no connection with whatsoever) from the pre-
school to the post-graduate levels. Mr. Beller, mentioned above, for example, has been
the recipient of tuition assistance for all six of his children! Another employee, Emad
Hanna, who was hired by Jeffrey at a particularly trying time of his adult life, told of
Jeffrey’s sponsorship of his son’s AAU baseball team and of the tuition assistance for his
son:
Jeffrey Epstein has paid out of his pocket my son's high school tuition for
2 years now totaling around $20,000 and has given him the opportunity to
get a top notch education at a private all boys catholic high school and my
son has thrived in that environment and averaged a grade of 91 in his
freshmen (sic) year and from all the travel baseball experience he was
able to make the JV basebail team at one of the top schools in New Jersey.
This has paved the way for my son to possibly have the opportunity to
