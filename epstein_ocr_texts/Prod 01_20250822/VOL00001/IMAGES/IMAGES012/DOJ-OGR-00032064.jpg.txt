Next: The police lock onto Epstein’s sybaritic lifestyle.

The lengthy police narrative in the case doesn’t make clear how police connected gray-haired Jeff with
Jeffrey Epstein, but when the girl identified his picture in an instant in a photo lineup, police threw
themselves into an investigation of the modern and palatial house on El Brillo Way.

Paim Beach Island is a 3.75-square-mile spit of land famous for towering ficus privacy hedges on
Mediterranean-influenced architecture that begins at over $5 million for a single-family home. But the
police did their work miles across the water, in the sprawling, drab subdivisions of West Palm Beach,
where, according to police reports, high-school girls had been recruited to visit Epstein’s house. The 14-
year-old was used to set up her 18-year-old go-between, Haley Robson. Robson had massaged him once
and thereafter refused, but had agreed to procure girls, for $200 a head. “I’m like Heidi Fleiss,” she said.
The police net went wider, to malls and community colleges, and Olive Garden restaurants and trailer
parks, and the story was always the same. Skinny, beautiful young girls were approached by other girls,
who said they could make $200 by massaging a wealthy man, naked. Robson said Epstein had told her
the younger the better—which she said meant 18 to 20. The rules were simple. Tel! him you're 18.
There might be some touching; you could draw the line. “The more you do, the more you are paid.” A
couple of the girls said they went all the way into the experience—one told police she visited 50 times,
another hundreds of times, both having sex with Epstein and Nada Marcinkova, a then-!9-year-old
beauty who Epstein told one of them was his “sex slave”; he’d purchased her from her family back in
Yugoslavia.

Epstein’s friends” belief that he was targeted for his big life reflects the fact that the police locked onto
Epstein’s sybaritic lifestyle. They made careful note of the girls’ thong panties, the shape and color of
the sex toys Epstein favors, and the erotic art in his home, from photos to the mural of a woman to the
statue of the man with a bow. Police repeatedly pulled his trash to dig out phone messages and kept an
eye on his private planes. Once, they even reported on Wexner’s plane, noting the procession of Cadillac
Escalades that made its way across the tarmac. After word of the investigation got back to Epstein,
through his girls, police served a search warrant at the house right under the noses of New York
decorator Mark Zeff and architect Douglas Schoettle, who were there planning a renovation, and seized
a dozen or so photographs of naked women the girls had described as well as the penis- and vagina-
shaped soaps.

Those soaps were even in guest bathrooms. No wonder; Epstein didn’t see his sex life as tawdry, wasn’t
hiding it from his circle. Wolff believes that Epstein had created an idealized world from “a deep and
basic cultural moment” once epitomized by Hugh Hefner. “Jeffrey is living a life that once might have
been prized and admired and valued, but its moment has passed ... I think the culture has outgrown it.
You can’t describe it without being held to severe account. It’s not allowed. It may be allowed if you're
secretive and furtive, but Jeffrey is anything but secretive and furtive. J think it represents an
achievement to Jeffrey.”

Some girls who “worked” for Epstein-—the term favored by the unfriendly assistant, Sarah Kellen, who
allegedly kept the Rolodex—seerm to have embraced that fantasy, too. One girl said she was “so in love
with Jeff Epstein and would do anything for him.” Two college girls/aspiring models were matter-of-
fact about what they’d done, and surveillance reports describe a fleet of girls jogging into the house.

But generally the girls’ feelings as portrayed by police interviews ranged from disgust to fear. Epstein
was the hairy troll under the bridge they had to pass over to get quick money. One girt “stated she was
very uncomfortable during the incident but knew it was almost over.” Another kept looking at the clock,
and Epstein said she was ruining his massage. Other girls said they were weirded out, grossed out. They
didn’t like his egg-shaped penis, definitely didn’t want it inside them. Some couldn’t say just what
