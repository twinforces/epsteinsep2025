client’s family office. The premise for the business is simple, if counter-intuitive:
extreme wealth brings a host of unique and often intractable problems to its possessor,
ic., family, security, investment, tax planning, estate planning, etc. Jeffrey has studied
families possessing such wealth, offers advice in all of these areas and, in the process,
insulates the family head from the passions and emotions of other family members
affected by the decisions of the family head.' In essence, Jeffrey offers new potential
clients the scenario of “no longer having to worry about their money.” Jeffrey continues
in this unique “niche” business to this day. The business is currently based in the U.S.
Virgin Islands, with New York City being the base of his charitable operations. Jeffrey’s
business and personal interests currently employ approximately 160 people. Of these,
however, he is the only income-producing person.

Jeffrey is single, having never married or fathered any children. He has shied
away from becoming a parent because the demands of his business would not allow him
the kind of time and presence needed to be a good parent. During his adulthood, Jeffrey

° has had two long-term relationships: the first with Eva Andersson from 1981 to 1990,
and the second with Ghislaine Maxwell from 1991 to 2000. (These will be treated in

greater detail below.) Jeffrey currently maintains residences in New York City; West
Palm Beach, Florida; the Virgin Islands; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Paris, France; as he
was enrolled as a visiting fellow at Harvard, he also has a rented apartment in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.

Jeffrey has always been shy socially but is articulate and engaging in person. He
has preferred to maintain his privacy despite his business associations with many wealthy
and well-known people in New York City and elsewhere. In 2005, Jeffrey agreed to
accompany and fly former President Bill Clinton on his AIDS Initiative journey to
Africa. While Jeffrey does not regret his decision to do so because of the great good that
it did, it has also had the collateral effect of raising Jeffrey’s profile in the media and
otherwise impacting the quiet life he has sought to live.

‘Jeffrey offered the following example. The daughter of a client becomes engaged. Because of the
difficulty of knowing whether her suitor is motivated by love or by money, a pre-nuptial agreement is
called for. Were the client to insist on this with his daughter, he might well incur her wrath because of the
implicit questioning of the motivation of her betrothed. With Jeffrey as the family advisor to the client,
however, it would be he who would deliver the news to the daughter, and it would be he who would incur
and absorb her wrath, thus insulating the client from these unpleasantries.
