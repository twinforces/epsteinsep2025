Biker Bitch
Current mood: @) exhausted
Category: Automotive
I am $00000000000000000 tired. Today was the Toys For Tots bike rally. My
neighbor has a Harley so I went with him. It was soooo0000000 cool! There was 400
bikes, It was awesome. I even go to meet this guy that has a local tv show. He goes
all around to these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I recognized him and
went over and talked to him. He was really nice. He's having this concert to
promote his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into going. I was standing
there in a sea of Harleys and Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving
KHUIIITEEEEIEEEE IT donated a football and a Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had
two toys in it so it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. Just wanted to
let everyone know what I was upto. Bye!

I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for [pn Jan. 5. I'm packing up Will's and my room
soon and it's making me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so weird not
having my best friend with me. I don't want to be without him but it doesn't seem
like I have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to go. Have you been through
this situation? How did u deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 20
different emotions and I have no idea how to deal with it.
