Dear Lanna Belohlavek,

Tam at a lost fUr words, and. trying to hold the: tears back, 2 “after roa reading about the

sickening details of billionaire Jeffrey. Epstein’ 's. case: I have-to say. in this instance, your
office along with the entire judicial system, failed the people. miserably, by not
adequately punishing a, chronic child ‘molester ad rapist. This man of wealth and

Prestige preyed on innocent, Poor, GIRLS and. systematically raped them. at this will. He

corrupt natire of our: system. if this happened to Tytone from ‘Dade County, he would be:
facing the death penalty. How can a person who molested one, let alone hundreds of
girls, receive this joke of'a.jail sentence, and now be a free man?! How?!! Becausc he is
rich? Just the thought of him being in his ‘million dollar mansion, sexually raping: these
girls makes me sick. Now, I understand the pressure of taking ona powerful person with
unlimited legal defense funds. Sometimes the premise, that any: conviction is. better than
none can be appropriate, this was not that time. You.did. NOT need his cooperation nor
did you need to: strike a deal. Even without his testimony, ‘and just: the victims, ‘your
office-could have put this monster away for at least 20 years, if‘nof life.

I'm sure you have read Conchitta Sarnoff’s piece on the Daily Beast detailing this
monsters, actions. If your office has:not read the piece, you should. by all means use it as
a Cautionary tale on how not to prosecute a rich child.abuser and human. trafficker. Now,
[ do not ‘know. the side story- your ‘investigation, legal technicalities, how: much hush’
money. was paid.out, ect ect. But] do know that after-people such as Jeffery Epstein have
raped. the entire country. of their’ retirement savings, he: shouldn’t be allowed to do the
same thing to young children. 1.do sincerely hope, you, and. your office did ALL, you
legally‘could have to put this man in-prison. However after researching the case, it, seems
you failed to:come: down with any authority or justice. I only hope; the:Palm Beach DA’s
office and the US. DA. can find further evidence, to’re try him and put him away: for good!
It would do our socicty much. good, ‘and set a standard thai no one person is above the
justice system, especially child molesters. I would hope '‘that'as a Jawyer, that is suppose
to defend the’ ‘public, you have a change of heart, and imagine if that-was your. little sister.
or'daughter, and do ALL ‘you can to bring this 'to a full trial. with no deals. ‘The American
pcople. deserve bettér, and so:do the:children that were abused. I hope you understand the
anger and frustration being expressed and absorb it to the fullest. Because you. and the
whole DA’s office nee to. know this- that-monster:doesn’t, deserve freedom!
