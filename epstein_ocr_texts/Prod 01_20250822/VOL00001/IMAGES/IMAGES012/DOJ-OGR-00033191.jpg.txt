Dear Lanna Belohlavek,

I am at a lost fur words, and trying to hold the tears back, after reading about the
sickening details of billionaire Jeffrey Epstein’s case. I have to say in this instance, your
office along with the entire judicial system, failed the people miserably, by not
adequately punishing a chronic child molester and rapist. This man of wealth and
prestige preyed on innocent, poor, GIRLS and systematically raped them at his will. He
lived his life and continues to live his life, above the law, and once again has proven the
corrupt nature of our system. If this happened to Tyrone from Dade County, he would be
facing the death penalty. How can a person who molested one, let alone hundreds of
girls, receive this joke of a jail sentence, and now be a free man?! How?!! Because he is
rich? Just the thought of him being in his million dollar mansion, sexually raping these
girls makes me sick. Now, I understand the pressure of taking on a powerful person with
unlimited legal defense funds. Sometimes the premise, that any conviction is better than
none can be appropriate, this was not that time. You did NOT need his cooperation nor
did you need to strike a deal. Even without his testimony, and just the victims, your
office could have put this monster away for at least 20 years, if not life.

I’m sure you have read Conchitta Sarnoff’s piece on the Daily Beast detailing this
monsters actions. If your office has not read the piece, you should by all means use it as
a cautionary tale on how not to prosecute a rich child abuser and human trafficker. Now,
I do not know the side story- your investigation, legal technicalities, how much hush’
money was paid out, ect ect. But I do know that after people such as Jeffery Epstein have
raped the entire country of their retirement savings, he shouldn’t be allowed to do the
same thing to young children. I do sincerely hope, you, and your office did ALL you
legally could have to put this man in prison. However after researching the case, it seems
you failed to come down with any authority or justice. I only hope, the Palm Beach DA’s
office and the US DA can find further evidence, to re try him and put him away for good!
It would do our society much good, and set a standard that no one person is above the

justice system, especially child molesters. I would hope that as a lawyer, that is suppose
to defend the public, you have a change of heart, and imagine if that was your little sister
or daughter, and do ALL you can to bring this to a full trial with no deals. The American
people deserve better, and so do the children that were abused. I hope you understand the
anger and frustration being expressed and absorb it to the fullest. Because you and the
whole DA’s office nee“ to know this- that monster doesn’t deserve freedom!
