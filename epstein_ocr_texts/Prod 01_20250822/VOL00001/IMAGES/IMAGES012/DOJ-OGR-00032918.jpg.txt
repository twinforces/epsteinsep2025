On February 15, 2006, I made telephone contact with Brittany Beale who
provided directions to where I could locate her. Det Caristo and I
responded to 806 Old Dixie Hwy in Lake Park to meet with Brittany
Beale. Upon my arrival, I met with Beale in the parking lot directly
behind MAACO Auto Painting. She was advised I was there to speak with
her about an ongoing investigation that concerned Jeffrey Epstein in
Palm Beach. Beale stated she knows Epstein very well and did not want
to speak with me about Mr. Epstein. She was very fond of Epstein and
did not want to speak with me about anything concerning Jeffrey
Epstein. I explained to her that she was seen at the house and I
would like to speak with her. She stated she knew there was an
investigation and that I had spoken with other people and therefore I
should know what happened at Epstein's house. Beale ended the
conversation and walked back into her boyfriends business, Blanton
Automotive. Det Caristo and I left the area and returned to the
police station.
Investigation continues.

A Grand Jury Session was requested during the month of February 2006,
in which all the girls that had been interviewed would have been
called to testify before the Grand Jury to seek an indictment against
Jeffrey Epstein. Due to subsequent meetings with the State Attorney's
Office and Defense Attorney Alan Dershowitz the Grand Jury was
postponed until a later time. Dershowitz had provided a package of
material on the main victims in this case in which they appear on
myspace.com and speak about alcohol use and some marijuana use. The
State Attorney's Office wanted time to review the material.
I requested additional subpoenas from the State Attorney's Office in
which I requested information from Dollar Rent a Car and Jet Aviation.
The information requested from Dollar Rent a Car was for the rented
vehicle by Alfredo Rodriguez while under the employ of Epstein for one
of the victims. The other subpoena requested was for Jet Aviation for
dates and times when Epstein's planes were in Palm Beach County.
I continued to research other names that were acquired either from
interviews or intelligence gathered during the investigation. I
