Around 1974, Jeffrey decided to try his hand at teaching and obtained a teaching
position in mathematics with an annual salary of $12,000 at the Dalton School, a highly
respected private school in uptown Manhattan which caters to the wealthy. Children in
his classes included, for example, those of Robert Redford, Joel Grey and those of
wealthy financiers. This was a social class to which Jeffrey had not previously been
exposed. As a teacher, Jeffrey was commended for being lively, interesting, and
uniquely gifted in presenting the material in a way which challenged the students. As
matters would turn out, Jeffrey’s experience at the Dalton School would become life-
altering on a number of different jevels.
As Jeffrey recounts the key event, he was urged by a student to attend an art
gallery opening which he reluctantly agreed to do. While there, Jeffrey was approached
by a parent of one of his students who had been told that Jeffrey was an especially
talented mathematics teacher. The parent asked him if he had ever considered working
on Wall Street (Jeffrey states that at the time he did not even know where Wall Street
° was), and referred Jeffrey to Alan Greenberg, then a high level executive at Bear Stearns.
During his subsequent interview with Mr. Greenberg, Jeffrey admitted that he did not
know what a stock or a bond was. Mr. Greenberg explained that he had detected a sea
change in the stock and bonds market from qualitatively based valuation to quantitatively
based valuation. Based on Jeffrey’s mathematics aptitude, Mr. Greenberg offered him a
job on the spot. Jeffrey agreed and started with the firm at the end of the school year.
Jeffrey utilized his mathematics expertise in becoming an adept options trader,
and came to know a number of successful investors. His success in the position is
reflected in the fact that by 1980 he had become the youngest limited partner in the firm.
Believing, however, that he could do better on his own on the outside, he decided to
resign from Bear Stearns in 1981. Capitalizing on his knowledge of and experience
investing in esoteric financial instruments at Bear Stearns, combined with his exposure to
; the unique family and financial problems of the “hyper-rich” gained from his experience
| at both Bear Stearns and the Dalton School, Jeffrey started a business called J. Epstein &

Company (now Financial Trust Company) wherein he acts as a family advisor to the

“hyper-rich.” The services he provides consist of a broad array of financial advice (on

investment, trusts, estates, asset allocation, etc.) and organization and management of the
