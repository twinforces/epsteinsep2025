10, 2006, at approximately 2:30 p.m., I served AD at her residence in
Royal Palm Beach. The subpoena was given to her mother, TD.
I learned through one of the victims (AH) that she was personally
contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein.
The source assured [she would receive monetary compensation for her
assistance in not cooperating with law enforcement. [§§falso stated
she was told, "Those who help him will be compensated and those who
hurt him will be dealt with." I told Jthat tampering with a
witness/victim is an arrestable offense and very serious. I asked her
who approached her during this encounter. [originally was reluctant
to provide the name of the person who approached her to offer her not
to testify because she felt they were still friends.
On April 11, 2006, Det Dawson and I traveled to Tallahassee, Florida
and met with the victim, QMfidentified Brittany Beal, W/F,
02/01/1987, as the person who approached her in Royal Palm Beach while
she was home during Spring Break in March 2006. [§Jalso stated she |
did not want to pursue the intimidation charges on Beal. [jwas
concerned that the defense attorney was given a copy of the report as
certain things she had told me in confidence were repeated to her by
Beal. Prior to our departure, the victim was given a copy of her
subpoena for the Grand Jury which was scheduled to commence April 18,
2006.
Upon our return from Tallahassee, I notified the State Attorney's
Office of what was told to me. I also notified them that the
subpoenas were delivered to the witnesses and they would be calling
for arrangements for the date and time needed for the Grand Jury. I
spoke with ASA Weiss and informed her of the possible intimidation by
the defense. .
On April 13, and April 14, 2006 I attempted contact on several
occasions with ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic to ascertain when the
victims needed to report for Grand Jury testimony. Messages were left
on their voicemail. On April 17, 2006, during the hours of 9:00 am
and 11:30 am, I again left messages for ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic
for either of them to return my call as I had not heard from the State
Attorney's Office as to the time and date of the Grand Jury.
At approximately 12:30 pm, I went to the State Attorney's Office and
located ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavic in their offices. I entered ASA
Belohlavic's office who informed me that she was going to return my
call. She explained that an offer was made to the defense, Atty Guy
Fronstin and Atty Alan Dershowitz. The offer is 1 count of Agg
Assault with intent to commit a felony, five years probation, with
adjudication withheld. Epstein would have to submit to
psychiatric/sexual evaluation and no unsupervised visits with minors.
When asked about the all the other victims, ASA Belohlavic stated
that was the only offer made as to one victim, Asa Belohlavic
cell phone rang and went to voice mail. She checked her voice mail
and played the message on speaker. The caller identified himself as
