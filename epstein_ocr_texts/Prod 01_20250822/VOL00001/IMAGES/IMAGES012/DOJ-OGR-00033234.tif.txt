different one or cash payment. Puzzled by my request, Jeffrey naturally
asked why. When I told him, he was visibly affected and without even a
moment’s consideration, he told me to go for treatment and send him the
bills. Having been with Jeffrey only a few months, I was astounded by his
generosity and hurried to my desk to call my wife to share the amazing
news.
In the days and weeks that followed, Jeffrey personally researched
infertility issues and shared the results of his research with me. He
identified the experts in the field to make sure that my wife and I were
seeing the right people. He and I spoke often about these issues and the
progress of our treatment cycle.
Unfortunately, the first cycle ended up a failure. Though my wife and I
were hesitant to ask him, Jeffrey insisted that we undergo another cycle at
his expense. The second cycle resulted in a pregnancy which had to be
terminated because of genetic defects in the fetus. My wife and I were
devastated and once again Jeffrey offered emotional, as well as financial,
support and encouraged us to proceed, When the third cycle failed and
my wife was then diagnosed with infertility problems, Jeffrey met with me
. to go over my wife’s and my options, which now included in-vitro
fertilization with donor eggs, an even costlier endeavor. Jeffrey did not
blink and insisted to pay for the treatments if my wife and I decided we
, were willing to proceed. He also helped us explore options of private
adoption through an agency. We chose the former, which Jeffrey funded,
while we also pursued the in-vitro/egg donor option at Jeffrey's expense.
At the unsuccessful completion of our fourth cycle and a failed adoption
. attempt, my wife and I were at the end of our rope and did not want to
continue. Without Jeffrey’s support and stubborn daily encouragement we
would not have. He even recruited his then girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell,
to meet with us to offer assistance with local adoption and overseas
adoption procedures and to encourage us to try again. Thankfully, after
our fifth cycle, my wife and I were blessed with twin daughters. Although
Jeffrey was adamant that we owed him nothing, Jeffrey honored us by
agreeing to be the godfather of our children.

The bottom line for Jeffrey Epstein is that while he has become an improbably
successfully business man, he has also been an unusually understanding and generous
human being. His generosity has taken many forms and has benefited many people, but
has been primarily directed to employees and others he comes in contact with,
educational institutions, “bleeding edge” scientific researchers, wellness organizations,

and civic groups. His aim has been to improve the lives of individuals by helping them
