JEFFREY EPSTEIN

Jeffrey Epstein is a person who, having been raised in modest, lower iniddle
class circumstances in New York City, parlayed an aptitude for Mathematics, a
teaching experience in a private school, and a chance referral to a Wall Street
executive into a unique, niche business to the wealthy which in turn has made him a
wealthy person. While this represents Jeffrey’s outward achievement in life, it is
hardly the measure of the man. To those who have known him long or intimately, he is
a loyal and unselfish friend who has a playful sense of humor. To those in the
scientific, education, wellness, and civic communities who have benefited from his
largesse, he is an unparalleled patron seeking nothing for himself. Finally, and most
importantly, to those whe work for him at every level, and to many of those ordinary
citizens he has learned of, he has been an extraordinarily generous and understanding

person, mentor, and friend. .

Personal History
Jeffrey Epstein was born in the Coney Island section of Brooklyn, New York in
. 1953. One of two sons born to Seymour and Paula nee Stolofsky Epstein, Jeffrey was

high school when she went to work for an insurance agency. Jeffrey recalled that, during:
his youth, the family often played a card game called “Concentration” for entertainment
from which he may have developed his early acumen for numbers. Jeffrey described a
' normal family upbringing in which he felt economically and emotionally secure.

Jeffrey attended public schools where his aptitude in mathematics became evident
early on. He skipped the third grade at P.S. 188 and was subsequently placed in a special
program which resulted in his skipping the eighth grade at Mark Twain Junior High
School. After his family moved to Seagate, Jeffrey was graduated from Lafayette High
School in 1969 at the age of sixteen. Thereafter, continuing to live at home, Jeffrey
attended Cooper Union in Manhattan for two years where he studied Math and Physics.

University. During this period, Jeffrey drove taxicabs summers in New York City for
spending money.
