Current mood: & blah
i'm just writing this blog because i'm so bored.
okay,..uuummm,...something cool???? oh here we
go: yesterday i was in walmart with my bf will and i
got a phone call from pacific sunwear. i applied like 2
weeks ago and since then have gotten a job at
Victoria's Secrets but the guy said that he wanted me
to come in and talk to him about working at the store
if i still want. now the cool part is that i was just
talking to will about how i wanted a second job that
morning. it's funny how things seem to wokr out so
well. anyway, there's really nothin mush else going
