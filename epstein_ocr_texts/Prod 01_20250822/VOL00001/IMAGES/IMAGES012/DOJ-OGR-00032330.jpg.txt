On October 20, 2005, I assisted Defective Recarey in the execution of
a search warrant at 358 El Brillo Way, Palm Beach, Florida, 33480.
Upon the announcement of the search warrant, immediate contact was
made with three white males who came out of the house or surrounding
structures. Those males were identified as Janusz Banasiak, Daniel
Estes, and Mark Zeff. As other members of the police department
cleared the home, I kept watch over these three males. Once the house
was cleared, those males were turned over to Detective Recarey.
Detective Dicks and I were assigned to assist in the search of the
main house, the cabana and the servant's quarters. We started in the
garage. All areas of the garage were searched to include four
vehicles. These vehicles were three black Mercedes Benz cars
registered to Jeffrey Epstein. The fourth vehicle was a Harley
Davidson motorcycle, green in color, registered to Jeffrey Epstein.
Nothing was recovered from the garage.
A towel closet and pantry located off the kitchen were searched and
yielded negative results.
The kitchen was searched and taken into evidence was a phone message
book that was located near a house phone.
North of the kitchen was an office room which contained a computer.
The room had a closet that contained a locked gun locker. The
combination was entered by Banasiak in the presence of Sgt. Frick and
the safe was opened. Items were taken from the room. See the
completed property receipt for a detailed list.
A green bathroom located on the first floor was searched and nothing
was taken.
A closet located just west of the green bathroom was searched. Two
massage tables were located in the closet along with a photo of a nude
female from the waist up. See the property receipt for details.
