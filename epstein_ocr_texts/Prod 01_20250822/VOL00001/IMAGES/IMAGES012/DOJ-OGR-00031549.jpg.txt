Defendant.

RESPONSE TO MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER

COMES NOW the Defendant, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, by and through his attorney and
files his response to the Motion For Protective Order filed by counsel for State’s witness
Jane Doe No. 1.

1. In summary fashion, counsel for Jane Doe No. 1 complains that serving a
witness for deposition by the use of a process server and the service of the witness’
parents for the deposition to ensure service, amounts to “continuous and systematic
harassment”. '

2. The Motion For Protective Order was filed by one of the attorneys purporting to
represent Jane Doe No. 1 in a separate civil proceeding.” While disagreeing with the

' Undersigned counsel for the Defendant responds only to the issues in the Motion for
Protective Order concerning service of a subpoena for deposition and the date for that deposition.
Defendant and undersigned counsel have no knowledge of any agent of the Defendant going to
the witness’ place of employment representing “himself as an attorney who needed to contract
(sp) her” as alleged “on information and belief” in paragraph 8 of the Motion for Protective
Order.

2 The Motion for Protective Order was filed by attorney Theodore Leopold. While he
purports to represent Jane Doe No.1, attorney Jeffrey Herman also claims to represent the
interests of Jane Doe No. 1. In that separate civil proceeding, the two law firms are presently
litigating who represents the interests of Jane Doe No. 1.
