“My belief is that Jeff maintains some sort of money-management firm, though
you won't get a straight answer from him," says one well-known investor. “He WAieErGl
once told me he had 300 people working for him, and I've also heard that he
manages Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It's like looking at the
Wizard of Oz -- there may be less there than meets the eye."
Says another prominent Wall Streeter: "He is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque
figure. He likes people to think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of
aloofness. The whole thing is weird."
The wizard that meets the eye is spare and fit; with a long jaw and a carefully

and fifteen minutes every day doing advanced yoga with his personal
instructor, who travels with him wherever he goes. He is an enthusiastic
member of the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations.
He dresses casually -- jeans, open-necked shirts, and sneakers -- and is

be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as | do, and
many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his
social life."
But beautiful women are only a part of it. Because here's the thing about
Epstein: As some collect butterflies, he collects beautiful minds. "I invest in
people -- be it politics or science. It's what | do," he has said to friends. And
his latest prize addition is the former president. In his eyes, Clinton as a
