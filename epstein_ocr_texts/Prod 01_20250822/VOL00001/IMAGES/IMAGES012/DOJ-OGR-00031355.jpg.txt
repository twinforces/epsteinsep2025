but atleast it feels like it right now. I don't know how
I'm going to adjust. I'm so scared to feel lonely.
Anyway, I finished orientation today. It was sooo00
boring. I tried to pick my classes and they were all
full. It sucks. I have to wake up at 8am when

| registration opens and go on the computer and finish

applying for classes because for some reason that
shit will be open tomorrow. I don't know. My
INTENDED major is International Affairs. I chose it
this morning at 3am because I had to register today
and I had no idea what I wanted to do. I'm so last
minute on everything. I CAN'T WAIT TO BUY SOME
WEEDIITIEIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE teen T CAN'T
WAIT! (Hold On: Let me say that
again) I CAN't WAIT TO BUY
WEED! T also want to get a
vaporizer so I can smoke in my room because
apparently there are 'narcs' everywhere. Well, I'm
really excited about starting class and meeting
people. If you've read to this point then I feel bad for
you. I'll stop torturing and finish this thing up,...... I
hope everyone is having a happy new year. I'm sorry
to those of you I promised to hang out with but
couldn't because I had no time before I left. I was so
busy guys, don't hate me. I'm sorry :( I'll be in touch
to all of those who know me. Wish me luck!

I am leaving Will to go to Jp three days. I
am moving to Tallahassee in twelve days. I'm
so sad; I can't stand it. I guess you can say I'm
sulking,.....but I can't help the way I feel. The whole
thing is so bitter-sweet. -------------------------I've
been crying a lot ®
