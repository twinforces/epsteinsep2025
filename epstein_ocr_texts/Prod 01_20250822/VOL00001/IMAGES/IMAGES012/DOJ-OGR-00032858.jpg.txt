Det. Dawson was assigned to relieve Officer Munyan at 4:00 pm; he
informed me that at approximately 8:00 pm, Epstein had left for the
airport and his private jet was sitting on the tarmac. Epstein's
private vehicle drove to the jet and unloaded packages into the jet.
It appeared that Epstein left the county at this time. Surveillance
will continue to determine when Epstein will return.

On Friday, September 23, 2005 at approximately 1:45 p.m., I began to
copy a tape micro cassette, under case number 05-368 and property
number 05-243, tape number 1. I placed the tape in the telex copy-et,
series 2 machine and began to go through the copying process.
Approximately 1/2 through the tape, the tape wrapped around the
spindle and became locked and stretched the tape. I examined it and
determined that it was in the best interest to leave it as it is as a
prior copy had been made and turned over to Sergeant Frick. I
immediately took the tape to Sergeant Frick and allowed him to examine
it and then obtained the copy from him and Detective Recarey and
brought the copy of the tape down and made a copy for him based on
that. The tape was placed back in the original container and is
retained in the evidence bag under the previously mentioned property
number of 05-243. It is not advisable to attempt to copy this tape as
further damage could result to the recorded material and there is an
existing copy anyway.

On 3-24-05 at 11:00 pm, a copy of tape 2 (case number 05-294) had been
made for Det. Pagan by Evidence Specialist Annette Badger. The copy
was turned over to Detective Recarey.
On Friday, 09-23-05 at approimately 2:15 pm, I was in the process of
reproducing audio tapes (micro and standard) to standard size when it
was discovered, in the test review process, that tape number 2 was
blank. I notified Sgt. Frick and Det. Recarey. I was informed that
they had a prior copy and I could use it to make a master tape. I did
so and when reviewing and signing the evidence sheet, I noticed
Evidence Specialist Badger had written "#2 is blank."
I obtained that copy from Det. Recarey and made a new copy on a
standard size tape. The new copy was placed in the evidence bag under
