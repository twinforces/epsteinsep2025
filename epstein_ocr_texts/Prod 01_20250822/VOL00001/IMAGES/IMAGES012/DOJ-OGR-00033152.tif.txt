You have suggested that to resolve all the issues my client move to transfer his
community control and that your office would support his transfer. I appreciate that and
spoke to Mr. Gaines about that and he doesnâ€™t believe that would be possible to New York.
Mr. Gaines suggested an agreement to allow Mr. Epstein to travel for business purposes
without the present 48 hour limitation but strictly at the discretion and with the
approval of probation for the remaining short portion of his supervision would be
appropriate. He advised me that the department would not object to such a modification.
This to me is the fairest way to deal with the issues, and to insure Mr. Epstein is
treated like others, Let me know and I can prepare some proposed language that I think
would work for everyone
