GGGRRRRRR,.......00f2UEEEOIIUTEEETTE!
Current mood: @) pissed off
I forgot to let everyone know I quit my job at
Victoria's Secret. They said they suspected me
of "causing losses to their company." -Which by the
way is bullshit! I was 'by the book’ on
EVERYTHING!!!!!1! I got so fed up in that office that I
handed the Loss Prevention lady back my keys and
walked out. GO ME! STICKIN' IT TO THE MAN! I
already have another job if I want it, and it's so much
more money$$$$$$. I'm going to be making more
money than my old bosses at VS. Success is
definately the sweetest revenge. ASSHOLES! !!!!!
