brought her to the interview room and explained to her that I was
conducting an investigation on Jeffrey Epstein and felt she may have
information pertaining to the investigation. Ms Bean identified
herself as Victoria Bean and resides in Wellington, Florida. She
advised approximately a year ago she was brought to Epstein's house to
provide a massage for money. Bean stated she needed to make money and
felt it was a quick way to make some money. Bean stated she was
brought to the house by Harrison and was introduced to Epstein and his
assistant. She was brought to his main bathroom and provided a
massage. I asked her if she provided the massage naked. Bean stated
she did. She rubbed Epstein's legs, back and chest. I asked Bean if
Epstein touched her during the massage. She advised he did not,
however he did masturbate himself as she rubbed his chest. Once he
climaxed the massage was over. She was paid her money and left the
area. Bean advised it occurred one time and she never returned to
Epstein's house. The interview was concluded and Bean was escorted to
the lobby.

I located a telephone number for Courtney Wild and attempted to
contact her on several occasions. I called 561-856-2617 and spoke
with Ms. Wild who advised she would speak with me in Deerfield Beach
where she resides. Due to a scheduling conflict, we were unable to
meet. I informed her I would contact her to schedule another
appointment to speak with her about this investigation. I have
attempted to meet with her and make telephone contact with negative
results.

On February 13, 2006, I met with David Rodgers at 7318 Heathley Drive
in Lake Worth. Rodgers was identified as Epstein's pilot. I spoke
with Rodgers who advised he has been employed with Epstein since 1991.
He flies both planes for Epstein depending where he wants to fly to.
Rodgers was asked about passengers in the plane he flies. Rodgers
stated unless Epstein flew to his island off of St Thomas, there would
be no way of knowing who the passengers were. I mentioned a recent
flight to Ohio, where Rodgers flew to Ohio to pick up Dana Burns.
Rodgers stated he recalled flying on several occasions and did

â€˜remember Burns. Rodgers stated once he is in the cockpit, he does not
know who the passengers are. When he prepares the passenger
manifests, he lists Epstein and his assistants he knows by name, Sarah
and Adrianna. Rodgers stated he would list either female or male
passengers on the manifests only to keep a count on the passengers.
Mrs. Rodgers came into the living room and recommended that her
husband consult with an attorney. Mr. Rodgers agreed he would speak
with the family attorney to inform him of this questioning. I
explained to Mr. Rodgers that he was not the suspect in this
investigation and ceased all questions. Based on the fact Rodgers
could not advise who passengers were in the plane, I then left the
area.
