A review of the telephone message books, which were obtained during
the search warrant, was conducted in which various messages from
different dates were made to Jeffrey Epstein. The telephone message
books have a duplicate copy (Carbon Copy) which, once a phone message
is written into the book, the top copy is then torn on the perforated
edge and the carbon copy is left in the book. First names of girls,
dates and telephone numbers were on the copy of the messages. I
recognized various numbers and names of girls that had already been
interviewed. The body of the messages was time of the day that they
called for confirmation of "work." Other names and telephone numbers
were located in which the body of the messages were, "Ihave girls. for
him" or "I have 2 girls for him." These messages were taken by Sarah
for Jeffrey Epstein. Based on the context of the body of the
messages, I requested subpoenas for subscriber information on the
telephone numbers and the time frame involved. Copies of the messages
were made for evidentiary purposes.
I obtained MMH igh school yearbooks for 2005, 2004 and
2003. I first reviewed the 2005 yearbook and located most of the
girls I had spoken with. Additionally, I located TT
Based on the corrected name spelling, I was able to locate her to her
residence in Loxahatchee. On December 8, 2005, Det. Caristo and I
responded to MMMM Fn) Loxahatchee. I located .‚Äù -at
her home. She advised she is attending High and is
participating in the early release program so she can maintain her
part time job. As she is still a minor, I left my business card to
have her mother return my call to request an interview with her
daughter. We then left the area.
I also had previously researched the telephone number for "Tatum" and
telephone number 561-640-7912. A subpoena had been issued for the
information on 561-640-7912. The telephone number was registered to
Scott Miller of 1558 Velvet Place E. A query of Tatum Miller revealed
that she is the daughter of Scott Miller and is currently residing at
4938 21 Road North in West Palm Beach. Det. Caristo and I attempted
contact with Miller with negative results. I left my business card on
her front door requesting she return my call. We then responded to
1558 Velvet Place E in West Palm Beach. I also attempted contact with
Mr. Miller with negative results. I left my business card for him to
return my call.
