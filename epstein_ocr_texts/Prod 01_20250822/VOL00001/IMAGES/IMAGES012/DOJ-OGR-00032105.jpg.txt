A billionaire investor and part-time Palm Beach resident has been indicted on a felony
charge of solicitation of prostitution after police say he had sex with underage girls whom
he paid for massage sessions at his El Brillo Way home.

| A Palm Beach County grand jury found that Jeffrey E. Epstein, 53, "did solicit, induce,

| entice or procure" prostitution with girls, who were between 14 and 16 years old, on at

least three occasions between Aug. 1, 2004, and Oct. 31, 2005.

| Epstein surrendered at the Palm Beach County Jail Sunday and was released on a $3,000

| bond. His attorney, Jack Goldberger, said Wednesday the third-

degree felony indictment is based on false accusations and that Epstein wasn't aware the

| girls were minors.
The next step will be an arraignment at which Epstein will enter a plea and a trial date
will be set, but an arraignment has not yet been scheduled. Upon conviction, a third-
degree felony is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
A resident of New York, Epstein has owned a five-bedroom, 7,234-square-foot
waterfront home at 358 El Brillo Way since 1990.
The indictment followed an 1l-1month sexual battery investigation bo Tt Der ch sais

The investigation also focused on Epstcin's assistant, Sarah Kellen, 27, of New York
City, and on Haley Robson, 20, of Royal Palm Beach, who police said were paid by
Epstein to help facilitate the massages and sex. Robson found and transported the girls to
Epstein's house for the massages in an upstairs bedroom, police said. Neither Kellen nor
Robson has been indicted or arrested on any charge.
Police took sworn statements from five alleged victims and 17 witnesses concerning the
massages and alleged unlawful sexual activity.
During their visits, the girls were introduced to Kellen, who took their names and phone
numbers, then sent them to Epstein's bedroom for massages and sexual contact, according
to police. Epstein would then pay the girls $200 or $300, police said.
