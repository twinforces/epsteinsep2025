1 P| Um, a couple of days later, I believe it was a Saturday night. [I’m

2 almost positive it was, cause I know I didn’t have to go to school

3 the next day. Um, and definitely wasn’t a Friday. So it next

4 Saturday night after that. She set it up, and I picked her up from

5 the her apartment, and we drove to the island and I worked, um,

6 and he paid her three or four hundred dollars to bring me.

10 a And that was it.
11
12 6 DETECTIVE: All right. Um, and this was a year and a half ago, correct?
13
i4 f Maybe two, I’m not sure, I didn’t really keep track
15
16 DETECTIVE: //Okay. How old were you when you first, uh, went over there?
17
18 aa If it was two years ago I was sixteen, if it was a year and a half, I
19 would have been sixteen or seventeen, I don’t know.
20
21 DETECTIVE: Okay.
22
23 az Like, I really don’t know.

af
28 a Just a massage.
29
30 DETECTIVE: Okay. Did she explain, um, how you would have to be dressed to
31 give a massage?
32
33 p | She said that he wanted cute girls, so | looked cute, did my best, I
34 didn’t — I didn’t think that it was what it was. I wasn’t naive
35 enough to think that he was gonna pay me two hundred dollars just
36 for nothing, [stutters] I, 1 don’t know, like | don’t know what was
37 going through my head. I absolutely don’t know. And I — the back
38 of my mind I was thinking, oh, well, it could be legitimate, but I
39 was also thinking, you know, at the same time, is she fucking
40 crazy? Like, this guy’s not gonna pay you money for not doing
41 anything, not letting him cop a feel or nothing. You know? So I
42 didn’t know what to think, I was like oh, I'll just go and I'll feel it
43 out and if I don’t like it, P'1l leave. Like, in the middle of it, like I
44 don’t care. If he does something that I have a problem with then
45 I'll leave.
