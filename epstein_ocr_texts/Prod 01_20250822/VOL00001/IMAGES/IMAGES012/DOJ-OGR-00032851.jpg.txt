that her daughter was having with a boy named Zack. Hernandez stated
that it was her opinion that both girls liked Zack. Hernandez

On 03/16/2005, PBSO Sgt. Chris Keen left a message that he was
returning my call. I spoke with Keen and discussed the case with him
and inquired if he had any open allegations or cases where the suspect
resided in Palm Beach. Keen stated he was unaware of any. Keen
offered any assistance if needed. Keen stated it was his experience
that due to the age of the parties involved, it would be difficult to
interview them and expect the investigation to remain confidential.
Because of the time delay, there was no need for the victim to be
taken to a medical facility for a physical for the purpose of
obtaining evidence. There was also no need to take her to CPT as she
was already in a juvenile facility, with an assigned therapist, in
which coordinating a day and time to obtain a statement could be made.
On 03/17/2005, I queried Jeffery Epstein on the internet and obtained
