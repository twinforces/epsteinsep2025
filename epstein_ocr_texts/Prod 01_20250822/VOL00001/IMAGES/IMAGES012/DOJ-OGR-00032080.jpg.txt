Abstract (Document Summary)
Leslie Wexner, founder and chair of the Limited clothing-store chain, bought the place in 1989 for $15,000.
[Jeffrey Epstein]'s mentor and one of his clients, Wexner is rumored to have sold the palatial digs to him for just
$1. Epstein quickly spent $10 million to gut the place and completely redo the interior.
SOCIALITE Samantha Boardman ditched her beau, Conde Nast editorial director James Truman, last year for
man-about-town Todd Meister. According to our spies, Boardman ditched Meister after she caught him in
flagrante with a 19-year-old coed. But don't feel too bad for her. Women's Wear Daily reports Boardman has a
new man - Vanity Fair's Graydon Carter. Truman must not be too pleased. When Boardman dumped him, he
needed to recuperate at a Buddhist retreat upstate. Editorial meetings at Conde Nast must be a hoot these
days.
"DISCO Bloodbath" author James St. James is following up his notorious tell-all about killer club kid Michael Alig
with another true-crime tome. He's shopping around "Killer Grandpa," his investigation into a lynching that his
grandfather led in 1935. "My grandfather was a sheriff in Fort Lauderdale, and he lynched a black man that
allegedly raped a white woman," James told us. "About 100 people gathered to watch, and they passed a gun
around and everyone took a shot at the body. It became this big town secret, and | write about what really
happened.” James, a 1980s club kid who fell in with Alig's inner circle, is played by Seth Green in "Party
Monster," the movie adaptation of "Disco Bloodbath.” But James said he was "shocked" when he watched a few
scenes of Green mincing it up with Macaulay Culkin, who plays Alig. "| didn't know | was so gay! | thought | was
more like Steve McQueen, but Seth is flouncing around the whole time. Seth is much cuter than me, actually,
and looks better in drag."

PAGE SIX'S scoop last month that mysterious money manager Jeffrey Epstein had flown Bill Clinton, Chris
Tucker and Kevin Spacey to Africa on his private 727 has sent journalists all over town trying to find out just who
Epstein really is.
Vanity Fair has a reporter on his trail, but New York magazine beats them to the punch with a feature this week
on Epstein's strange history.
Epstein, 49, a former Dalton School math teacher from Coney Island, is said to manage $15 billion for super-
wealthy clients he'll only take on if they have at least $1 billion in assets.
"According to people who know him," New York reports, “if you were worth $700 million and felt the need for the
services of Epstein & Co., you would receive a not-so-polite no-thank-you.”
Noted mergers/acquisitions lawyer Dennis Block of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft recalls trying to give
Epstein a client whose funds were below the $1 billion cutoff.
"| sent him a $500 million client a few years ago and he wouldn't take him," Block reports. "Said the account was
too small. Both the client and | were amazed. But that's Jeffrey."
Most Wall Streeters, however, aren't even certain what Epstein actually does for a living. "My belief is that Jeff
maintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won't get a straight answer from him," says one
powerful investor. "He once told me that he has 300 people working for him, and I've also heard he manages
Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It's like looking at the Wizard of Oz."
Some say that Epstein once quit his seat on the board of the Rockefeller Institute because he hates wearing a
suit, Supposedly telling a friend, "It feels like wearing a dress."
