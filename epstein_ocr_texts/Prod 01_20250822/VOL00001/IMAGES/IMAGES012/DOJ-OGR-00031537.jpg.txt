Re: Jane Doe v. Epstein
Dear Jack:
This letter is written due to the deep and serious concern about the ethics of your co-counsel.
Because your co-counse] refused to provide copies of the documents and photographs used in his
direct examination of Byesterday to the State Attorney or me, which is the professional and
customary thing to do, and the fact that he refused to even allow the court reporter to mark the
documents as exhibits I am quite fearful we may never see the exhibits again.
Therefore I am compelled to write this letter to confirm that you have agreed that you will
provide the State Attorney and me copies of all the exhibits, properly identified, that were used
during irect examination.
Very truly youts,
THE ‘J. LEOPOLD
