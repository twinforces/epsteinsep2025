When it became clear, however, that the demands of Jeffrey’s life could not
include staying in one place and having a family, Eva and he realized that they had no
future as a family unit. They parted amicably. Eva eventually married and has had three
children. This notwithstanding, they have continued to speak with each other nearly
every day (as does her oldest daughter, Celina), having missed only a dozen times or so
in the 26 years they have known each other. She described their current relationship as
follows:

Today [Jeffrey] is a very close and important friend to my family. He is
the godfather of my three children and is close friend of my husband as
well. Whenever Jeffrey is in New York, he will always come over in the
evening and visit with us, help the children with their math homework, and
conduct science QO & A at the dinner table. He will always remember the
children’s birthdays and he is constantly on the lookout for educational
games for the kids. Four years ago when I had a cancer scare, Jeffrey
was extremely supportive in visiting me everyday in the hospital. I could
not ask for a better friend or godfather to my children.
. Jeffrey has enjoyed an especially close relationship with Celina, 12. Celina wrote
glowingly of their weekly science lesson when “Uncle Jeff,” as she calls him, takes time
: from his personal and business schedule to go over to her apartment and discuss science
and mathematics lessons she is learning at school. They might talk about such things, for
example, as why the sky is blue or how fast light travels. After their lesson is over, they
then spend some time at the piano where “Uncle Jeff’ helps her work on her singing
voice (even though, as she knows, “Uncle Jeff’ does not have any real expertise in this
area). The closeness of their relationship is perhaps best suggested, however, by an
incident Celina related in her letter:
One of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me happened about 2
years ago when I was at ballroom dancing class. It was father-daughter
dance day and unfortunately my father was stuck in a business meeting. I
didn’t know what I would do because you had to bring your father to the
dance class. I got to the class alone, but then soon enough a quick phone
call to Unele Jeff didn’t leave me standing there, alone for more than 10
minutes. Uncle Jeff substituted for my father that night, and the way he
rushed to the class felt exactly like having my father there.

After Eva and Jeffrey decided to put their relationship on a platonic basis, Jeffrey
entered into another significant relationship with Ghislaine Maxwell, then 29, beginning
