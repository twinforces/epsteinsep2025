Case No. .. . : 1-05-000368 (Continued)
inspected for future use. The items collected were placed into
evidence.
It became evident that some of the recordings were recorded with
background noise and some interference. The calls most affected were
the control phone calls from the victim to the suspect Haley Robson.
I obtained the graphic equalizer and discovered that the calls are
able to be legible with the use of the equalizer by lowering the
background noise and increasing voice gain. I also learned that a
tape was broken during the coping of the tape. I returned the copy of
the tape marked Property Number 05-243 to have it recopied to have an
original in evidence and a working copy with the file.
Upon researching the file, it was discovered that the suspect, Haley
Robson's cellular calls were subpoenaed incorrectly. The suspect
telephone number was 561-308-0282 and the original request was for
561-908-0282. I requested the information through Cingular Cellular
Service from February 2005 through the present. The purpose was to
have a record of Robson making calls to victim, Jeffrey Epstein and
the frequency of calls. The request was submitted to the State
Attorney's Office.

On or about September 23, 2005 at approximately 0915 hours, I
responded to 358 El Brillo and met with PB Sanitation worker Jeff
Williams. Williams had been previously notified to assist in trash
pulls at the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo, Palm Beach,
Florida. I observed Williams enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo and
remove several plastic bags of trash and place the contents into the
back of an empty sanitation truck.
I then followed Williams to a predetermined location and seized the
trash from the truck. The trash was transported to the Palm Beach
Police Department where I began sifting through its contents. There
was a total of 4 white in color plastic bags and each contained
documentation and correspondence for 358 El Brillo and Jeffrey
Epstein. All documents of evidentiary value were removed and turned
over to Det. Recarey for follow-up.
On or about September 26, 2005 at approximately 0900 hours, I
responded to 358 El Brillo and met with PB Sanitation worker Jessie
Jones. Jones had been previously notified to assist in trash pulls at
the residence of Jeffrey Epstein, 358 El Brillo, Palm Beach, Florida.
I observed Jones enter the driveway of 358 El Brillo, where no trash
was located within the receptacles. I left the area without incident
and notified Det. Recarey to that affect.
