told me that he had purchased a spy camera from a store on
Okeechobee Blvd. and had set up the camera which was ina
clock in his office facing the briefcase with the money in it.
Epstein then placed $4,000. in U.S. currency, one hundred dollar
bill increments and left the bag on his desk as he always does
when he is in town. Epstein said that he went to bed with the
camera system monitoring the bag and desk area, only to wake up
and twice to have $100. missing from the bag and the suspects
image on his computer hard drive. It should be noted that there
were thirteen one hundred dollar bills still in the white envelope
and that nothing else in the house appeared to be disturbed by the
suspect.
Epstein took me to the computer room where he showed me a computer
monitor that was displaying a still frame of the suspect. The
computer indicated a time of 0428 a.m., when the suspect came into
the office area, walked behind the desk, opened the hand bag, and
then opened the center drawer to the desk. It appeared as though
the suspect was familiar with the house and the desk. Epstein
told me that he did not know who the suspect in the photo was
but thought it might be his former houseman because of his size
and shape. Epstein also pointed out that the suspect in the
video was wearing moccasin type shoes like his former houseman
did due to his back injury. The suspect was a white male who
was 5'10" in height, 250 lbs., wearing tan pants, white shirt,
and a hat. Epstein provided me with the former houseman's
information which was Juan P. Alessi, DOB 02/12/50, Living at
1515 South Flagler Dr., Apt. 1901, West Palm Beach, Florida.
I advised Epstein that I would need to obtain a copy of the
surveillance video from his computer hard drive in order to
have in hands. Epstein told me that he had limited working
knowledge of the system but he would contact the company who
_....__had_installed the system and have them make a copy by Monday.
Epstein told me he would call when he had more information. ===
Epstein took me to the desk where the carry on bag was and told
me that he believed that the suspect might have gained entry
into the house from the sliding glass doors on the south side
cf the house but not the west side of house because he had
personally locked all the sliders on that side of the house.
It is believed that the suspect also left the house by the
same sliding door that was unlocked as there were no pry marks
or indication of forced entry into the house. Epstein also showed
me the bookcase behind the desk where he kept his Glock 9 mm
handgun between the books which was now missing. Epstein could
not supply me with the serial number for the handgun at this
time but advised he would contact Gator Gun on Okeechobee
Bivd. to obtain the information.
Crime Scene Manager Greg Parkinson processed the crime scene and
collected the envelope that the money had been taken out of.
