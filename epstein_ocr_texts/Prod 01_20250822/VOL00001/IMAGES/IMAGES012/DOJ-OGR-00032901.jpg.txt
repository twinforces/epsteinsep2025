responded to 1801 Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard, also known as the Palm
Beach Mall. I located the Simon Youth Foundation. I located
Mes inside the foundation and informed her that I was
investigating a case against Jeffrey Epstein and knew she had been at
the house. . . started to cry and advised she had put that part
of her life behind her. I explained that although she is seventeen
years old I needed to inform her parents that she would be
interviewed. She provided her home telephone number. I attempted
contact and left voice mail messages at the house to speak with her
parents.
Det. Caristo and I then iocat es at her residence located
at j West Palm Beach. I attempted to interview her
about Jeffrey Epstein. She advised she is so in love with Jeff
Epstein and would do anything for him. She further explained that she
would not speak with us about him either negative or positive. She
asked us to leave her property. I informed her that although she did
not wish to speak with us, I had sufficient information at this point
in the investigation to know she was at Epstein's house and provided
girls to Epstein to work. I also explained that prior to our arrival
at her residence I had telephone contact with her father ,guupps
Me «WhO was told she would be interviewed. pa is
currently seventeen years old and as a juvenile, parental notification
| would be required. We then left the area and returned to the police
| station.
| While at the police station, I left another telephone message for
MEME parents. I began an analysis of Sarah Kellen's Cellular
telephone. The telephone number 917-855-3363 is assigned to Sarah
Kellen and the financially responsible party is Jeffrey Epstein of 457
Madison Ave. in New York City, New York. The time frame which was
subpoenaed was September 2005, through October 2005. There were
eighty seven pages of calls made either to the cell phone or from the
cell phone. The local (561) numbers were analyzed. A spread sheet
was prepared and placed into the attachment file of who was called.
The unknown numbers were researched using FoneFinder.com and subpoenas
were requested to determine subscriber information. This was done to
identify additional victims or witnesses. The analysis revealed that :
Kellen had called the victim/witnesses frequently when Epstein was in
the Town of Palm Beach to "work." This confirms what the girls
interviewed had previously stated. Kellen would notify them when
Epstein was in town and their willingness to "work." The CD was placed
into evidence.
Investigation Continues.
