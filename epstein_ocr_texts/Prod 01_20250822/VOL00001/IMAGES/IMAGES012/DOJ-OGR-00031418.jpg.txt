On 10/06/03, at 1100 hours, Det. Recarey and I went to oh
358 El Brillo and met with Mr. Epstein's personal
assistant Sarah Kellen in regards to obtaining the video
footage of the suspect burglar.
Det. Recarey obtained a video of the footage starting at
0426 hrs, and ending at 0430 hours. The before
mentioned video shows a white male inside the Epstein
residence moving a duffle bag and opening a desk
drawer. A copy of this video footage was captured onto
a compact disk and was placed into evidence via a
property receipt.
At 1400 hours, Det. Dawson and I went to the Towers
Condominium, 1515 South Flagler Drive in West Palm
Beach, where the suspect currently resides. I observed ,
several video cameras on the outside of the building and
a doorman at the main entrance on the south side of the
building.
At 1550 hours, I was advised by Crime Scene Manager
Greg Parkingon that he had located fingerprints for the
suspect Alessi from a Town of Palm Beach
identification card application.
At 1630 hours, I called the Towers Condominium and
spoke with the manager of the condominium who
verbally identified himself to me as Donald Dement.
Dement gave me his direct business number
561-833-8170, and his home phone number
ยง61-624-2892. Dement told me that he was familiar
with the name Alessi but he advised he wouldn't
recognize him. Dement told me that they had several
video cameras and that they did record the surveillance
camera but the recording system had broken on Sunday
night and he didn't have anything on the tapes.
Dement told me that the condo does have a midnight
doorman who stands duty at the desk in the lobby and
anyone coming in the building regardless of what door
they come in, would have to pass the doorman. Dement
told me that the desk man for Sunday morning, 2300 to
0700 hours was Greg and he next worked on
Wednesday, 10/08/03. Dement was not familiar with
what Alessi drives or which parking spot was his but he
advised that he would check and call me back in the
' morning.
