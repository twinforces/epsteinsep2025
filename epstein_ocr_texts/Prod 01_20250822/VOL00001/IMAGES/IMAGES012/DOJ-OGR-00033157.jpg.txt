RE: State of Florida v. Jeffrey Epstein
Case No, 2008CFO009381A
Dear Barbara,
Pursuant to our telephone conversation of November 30, 2009 and your subsequent email
to me, | am providing the following information to you concerning Jeffrey Epstein’s air travel
from May 1, 2009 through November 30, 2009.
As you know, Mr. Epstein was in the custody of the Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office |
until July 22, 2009. | have confirmed that since Mr. Epstein’s release from custody, he has
traveled twice by air. The first trip was on September 14, 2009 when he traveled by
helicopter to Miami to meet with counsel. He returned that day from Miami to Palm Beach
County by automobile. Larry Visoski was the pilot and Nadia Marcinkova was the only
other passenger. Both the trip and the mode of transportation were pre-approved by
probation. On August 27, 2009 Mr. Epstein flew on a single engine Cessna aircraft to
Sikorsky Helicopters in northern Palm Beach County. Larry Visoski and Nadia Marcinkova
accompanied Mr. Epstein on this short flight. Once again the trip and the method of
transportation were pre-approved by probation. There have been no other aircraft flights
taken by Mr. Epstein during the time period. | am told there are not flight logs kept for the
helicopter but | am enclosing the fuel receipt for the Miami helicopter trip as well as another
document confirming the September 14, 2009 Palm Beach - Miami helicopter flight. | am
also enclosing documents for the August 27, 2009 Cessna flight to Sikorsky Helicopters.
On another note, there appears to be false information being presented to either the State
Attorney's Office or the Probation Office about Mr. Epstein allegedly violating the terms of
nis probation. None of this is true and in fact Mr. Epstein has an unblemished record with
probation without any violations since his being placed on supervision. | note that many
of the false allegations against Mr. Epstein have been brought by the Scott Rothstein law
