Why should Xanax not be prescribed?
If you are sensitive to or have ever had an allergic reaction to Xanax or other tranquilizers,
you should not take Xanax. Also avoid Xanax while taking the antifungal drugs Sporanox or
Nizoral. Make sure that your doctor is aware of any drug reactions that you have experienced.
Do not take Xanax if you have been diagnosed with the eye condition called narrow-angle
glaucoma.
Anxiety or tension related to everyday stress usually does not require treatment with Xanax.
Discuss your symptoms thoroughly with your doctor.
Special warnings about Xanax
Xanax may cause you to become drowsy or less alert; therefore, driving or operating
dangerous machinery or participating in any hazardous activity that requires full mental
alertness is not recommended.
If you are being treated for panic disorder, you may need to take a higher dose of Xanax than
for anxiety alone. High doses--more than 4 milligrams a day--of Xanax taken for long
intervals may cause emotional and physical dependence. It is important that your doctor
supervise you carefully when you are using Xanax.
As with all antianxiety medication, there is a small chance that Xanax could encourage
suicidal thoughts or episodes of euphoria known as mania. If you notice any new or unusual
| symptoms after starting Xanax, call your doctor immediately.
|
| Xanax should be used with caution in elderly or weak patients, and in those with lung disease,
alcoholic liver disease, or any disorder that could hinder the elimination of the drug.
