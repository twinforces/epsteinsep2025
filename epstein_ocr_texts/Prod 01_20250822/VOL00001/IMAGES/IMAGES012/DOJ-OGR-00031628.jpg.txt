Low Income Assistance for Telephone Service - Lifeline and Link-Up
Low income support may be available for your home telephone service. Lifeline and
Link-Up provide assistance with monthly recurring and connection charges to
qualified residential telephone subscribers. These programs make telephone service
more accessible to those who otherwise might not be able to afford it.

You may be eligible if you currently receive income-based benefits from a plan such
as Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), Food Stamps, Medicaid,
Supplemental Security Income (SSI), Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program
(LIHEAP), or Federal Public Housing/Section 8. If you are at or below 125% of the
poverty level, but not currently receiving benefits from one of the listed programs,
