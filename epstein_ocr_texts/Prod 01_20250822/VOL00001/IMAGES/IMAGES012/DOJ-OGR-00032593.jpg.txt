use, lying to get her job and lies about the reason for her termination; a written
report detailing her multiple thefts from a former employer; parts of her story were
inherently incredible; she made false statements about having been given a car by
Epstein; and she refused to state the disposition of the money paid to her by
Epstein.

= po a potential victim; she had multiple runaway
complaints lodged by her parents and was assigned to a special high school for
drug abusers; she published false representations that she was 18 on her MySpace
webpage, along with nude photos of herself, boasts about having beaten someone,
details of her drug use and a claim that she was earning in excess of
$250,000/year. Nor is there reference to the fact that police had recently
responded to a complaint at her home to find her “under the influence of a
narcotic”.

The State Attorney relies on the professionalism, the integrity and the skill
of members of the Palm Beach Police Department to conduct investigations and to
report all material facts fairly and accurately. That is essential so that prosecutors
can make charging decisions consistent with the facts, the law, the appropriate
allocation of limited resources and public policy. If police officers hide facts,
misstate evidence, or otherwise fail to provide prosecutors with all material
information then justice cannot be served. It is our unfortunate but unmistakable
conclusion that Detective Recarey failed to discharge his duty in this matter.
Moreover, his decision to release to the public the Police Report and Probable
Cause Affidavits, particularly when they contained material omissions and
misstatements of fact, was intended to harm Epstein, ill served the criminal justice
system, and ultimately failed the people of Palm Beach County.

We are prepared to provide any other information you may need in
