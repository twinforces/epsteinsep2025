Epstein was doing because they kept their eyes averted. Two or three girls started crying when they
talked to police, one hysterically. One wanted to tell the police but knew that he was “powerful” and was
afraid he would come after her family. A 17-year-old model described an uncomfortable encounter in
which Epstein offered to help her get jobs, then belittled her modeling portfolio before cajoling her to
model the underwear he’d bought for her. A 16-year-old who needed money for Christmas said she was
so upset by Epstein’s removing her underwear as she massaged him that she broke off her friendship
with the girl who brought her. Another called Epstein “a pervert.”
Epstein clearly did not see it that way. The girls knew what they were getting into and came willingly
and were well paid. He was a sexy guy who was working to give the girls pleasure. The master bedroom
was a sensual place, with a mural of a naked woman and a hot-pink couch, and a wooden armoire with
sex toys. The lights dimmed, music came on. Still, it is a stretch to say Epstein’s love shack was like
Hugh Hefner’s. Playboy was state-of-the-art pornography for the sixties. Today, cutting-edge porn is
men with bankrolis picking up young amateurs, say, high-schoo} cheerleaders or college girls on break,
and daring them to go further and further for more cash, all the way to sex toys and lesbian sex. At 52,
Epstein was outside the demographic of the makeout artists of The Bang Bros, Girls Gone Wild, and
Coeds Need Cash, but he surely saw himself in that erotic milieu, and seems to have been shocked that
his activities would result in a police investigation.
His claim that he’d given a total of $100,000 to Ballet Florida for massage was absolutely true. “The
massage and therapy fund is excruciatingly important to us. It’s part of a dancer’s life to have daily
massages,” says the ballet’s marketing director, Debbie Wemyss, who notes that Epstein’s generosities
preceded his public troubles. Police were not impressed. They interviewed a licensed deep-tissue
masseuse whom Epstein frequently employed. She said she got $100 an hour, and there were no happy
endings.
Next: Epstein mounts an aggressive counterinvestigation.
The 14-year-old told Epstein she was 18 and in the twelfth grade. In Florida, this is not a defense. The
law protects the young by placing the burden on the adult to learn the truth. And while Epstein’s girls
might have fooled a lot of people—they were tall and grown-up—it’s difficult to believe Epstein
wouldn't have suspected some were underage. (Though Epstein later passed a Jie-detector test saying
that he believed the girls were 18.) Girls needed to be driven home or given rental cars. Offered
whatever they wanted from Epstein’s chef, they often gobbled cereal and milk. One 16-year-old told
police that Epstein told her repeatedly not to tell anyone about their encounter or bad things could
happen. Alfredo Rodriguez, a houseman, told police that at his boss’s direction, he brought a pail of
roses to a girl to congratulate her on her performance in a high-school drama.
“He has never been secretive about the girls,” Wolff says. “At one point, when his troubles began, he
was talking to me and said, ‘What can I say, I like young girls.’ | said, ‘Maybe you should say, ‘I like
young women.’ ~ '
Epstein mounted an aggressive counterinvestigation. Epstein’s friend Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard law
professor, provided the police and the state attorney’s office with a dossier on a couple of the victims
gleaned from their MySpace sites—showing alcoho! and drug use and Jewd comments. The police
complained that private investigators were harassing the family of the 14-year-old girl before she was to
appear before the grand jury in spring 2006. The police said that one girl had called another to say,
“Those who help [Epstein] will be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”
By then, the case was politicized. The Palm Beach police had brought stacks of evidence across the
