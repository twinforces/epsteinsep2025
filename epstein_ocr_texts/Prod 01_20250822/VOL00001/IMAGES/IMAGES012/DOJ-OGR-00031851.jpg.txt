Re: State of Florida v. Jeffrey E. Epstein
Case No.: 2006CF009454A KX
Dear Mr. Goldberger:
As you know, we —e all matters pertaining to Jeffrey
Epstein. If you plan on scheduling Ms. (gg for deposition please contact us to schedule to
a date convenient for Ms. and myself. In addition, we would like to conduct a single
deposition to be used for both the criminal and the civil matters. Please let us know if you
will agree to this or if we should seek court approval for same. Of course, we understand that
the State Attorney’s Office will need to agree to this as well, and we have not yet contacted
them for approval. .
