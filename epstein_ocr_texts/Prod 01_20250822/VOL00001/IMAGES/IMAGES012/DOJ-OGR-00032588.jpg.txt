e Significant and material misstatements of fact, which misstatements were
consistently slanted to support a finding of probable cause.
e The public release to the press of the Police Report and Probable Cause
Affidavits, all of which contained material omissions of fact and material
misstatements of fact, and which release was done to cause harm to
Epstein and to influence state and federal prosecutorial authorities.
Below we set out some of the most significant of these actions. Provided
herewith is an Appendix containing the underlying documents to which we refer.
Tab numbers correspond to the section (I or II) and paragraph number.
I. Inaccuracies and Material Omissions

i. The Video Surveillance Equipment

Both the Police Report (at 43) and the Probable Cause Affidavits (at 18)
make particular mention of the “discovery” of video surveillance equipment (or
“covert (hidden) cameras” as they are called) in Epstein’s garage and
library/office. Inclusion of this information insinuates a link between the
equipment and the events at issue: the Probable Cause Affidavits note that “on the
first floor of the Epstein residence . . . [Recarey] found two covert cameras hidden
in clocks. One was located in the garage and the other located in the library area
behind Epstein’s computer. . . . the computer’s hard drive was reviewed which
showed several images of Haley Robson and other witnesses interviewed. All of
these images appeared to come from the camera positioned behind Epstein’s
desk”. (Probable Cause Affidavits at 18).
