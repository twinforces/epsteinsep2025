Recarey was in possession of the two month rental agreement, contradicting . -
statements. Yet HMM fanciful claim that she was given a car appears in the Police
Report, without reference to the fact that Recarey knew that to be untrue. Nor is
the evidence that she engaged in multiple thefts from her retail employer included.

a Sworn Statement of Juan Alessi. The Police Report and Probable
Cause Affidavits detail information purportedly obtained by Detective Recarey
from Juan Alessi, a former Epstein house manager. The statement was recorded by
a stenographer. A comparison of the transcript and the Police Report and Probable
Cause Affidavits reveal significant differences. Detective Recarey reports that
“Alessi stated that towards the end of his employment, the masseuses were
younger and younger”. (Police Report at 57). Alessi actually stated that for the
most part the masseuses did not appear young. (Transcript at 9). Alessi further
declared that only “one” girl was young and in his judgment she looked “16 or
17”. Gd.).

Detective Recarey also notes (Police Report at 57) that Alessi claimed “the
bed would almost always have to be made after the massage”. This statement is
directly contradicted by other witness statements, which are devoid of any

| accusation by any woman that any activity ever occurred on the bed. Indeed,
Alessi himself actually stated that on a “few” occasions the bed was unmade after
a massage, suggesting Epstein may have taken a nap. (Transcript at 11-12). Alessi
further explained that even in the absence of a massage he could be called upon to
make Epstein’s bed three or four times a day, (id), thus providing an innocent
explanation for the frequent bed making. It was in fact Detective Recarey who
suggested that “something else occurred”, and even then, Alessi insisted he did not
know of “something else”: “. . . or something else, I cannot [say]”. (/d.).

There is also no mention of Alessi’s burglary of the Epstein residence; his
theft of cash and possible theft of a gun; or of Alessi’s suicidal ideations, all of
which made him an unreliable witness.
