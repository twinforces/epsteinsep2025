i G: You wrote that to your friend, didn't you?
2 MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. Asked and
3 answered, for the fourth time. :
4 MR. TEIN: You are improperly objecting,
5 Mr. Leopold. You have no grounds to object. And
6 that's not an objection.
@ MR. LEOPOLD: It is an objection.
8 MR. TEIN: Then terminate the deposition if |
9 you think it's been asked and answered.
10 MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, I am not precluded
i
LL from just making an objection to the form of the
2? question. As the courts well know, and if you !
13 practice here in West Palm Beach, many of the |
14 judges require you to set the objection with ;
15 specificity. And I will do that. And if you :
16 don't want me to, you can make the record. But I
LZ will do that. |
18 MR. TEIN: Here's what we'll do, Ted. You :
19 can -- I will allow you to reserve an objection to :
20 form for every single one of my questions.
Hail Otherwise, all you're doing is obstructing.
22 MER. LEOPOLD: I wen"’t do that. |
23 MR. TEIN: Of course; because you want to |
24 obstruct.
25 MR. LEOPOLD: All right.
