Defendant Epstein would be harassment. A protective order under rule 3.220(1)(1) would
prevent this harassment.
8. Counsel for Witness Y. Doe has contacted both the attorneys for the State
and for Defendant Epstein regarding this request, and neither has responded.
WHEREFORE, Witness Y. Doe respectfully requests a protective order requiring
that the deposition in the criminal case and the civil case captioned Jane Doe No. 3 v.
Jeffrey Epstein, case no. 08-CV-80232-Marra/Johnson, United States District Court for

this Court deems just and proper.
