Dear Mr. Leopold:

Yesterday’s fax from you is more of the same misrepresentation of the record and self-
serving grandstanding that you engaged in throughout Wednesday’s deposition. Anyone
who reads the transcript will see the desperate tactics you used. You had no standing to
object on any basis other than privilege. Despite that, you made improper speaking
objections, mischaracterized the record and coached your client’s answers. Ms.
BEER ccosition proves beyond any doubt that the intervenor’s complaint that you
filed against Mr. Epstein for $50,000,000.00 [sic] is frivolous and violates FED. R. Cv. P.
11. Beyond your stunts and meritless allegations, you clearly lied to us about your
availability for the deposition, necessitating Mr. Goldberger’s changing his vacation
plans.

Finally, your letter, like your reckless and libelous accusations, is nonsense. The
deposition exhibits — including the photos that your client posted on the Internet of
herself in various states of undress simulating intercourse, fellatio and violent gang rape —
were numerically stamped and bar-coded. You well know that we provided the court
reporter with color copies, which will be attached to the deposition transcript. You also
know that both you and Ms. Belohlavek agreed to that procedure before you left the
deposition room. If you have any question about the authenticity of the photographs
when you receive the exhibits, you can ask your client about the evidence she destroyed ,
last week after she was already under subpoena.

I hope that in the future you can comport yourself within the bounds of professionalism.
Very truly ygurs,

f
MichaeRR. Tein
