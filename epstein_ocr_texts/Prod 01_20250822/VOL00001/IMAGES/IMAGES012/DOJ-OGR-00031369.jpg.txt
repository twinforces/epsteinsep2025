Biker Bitch
Current mood: @) exhausted

I am $00000000000000000 tired. Today was the Toys For Tots bike rally. My
neighbor has a Harley so I went with him. It was sooooc000000 cool! There was 400
bikes, It was awesome. I even go to meet this guy that has a local tv show. He goes
all around to these different bike spots. I think he's hilarious. I recognized him and
went over and talked to him. He was really nice. He's having this concert to
promote his show and I think I'm gonna try and talk Will into going. I was standing

| there in a sea of Harleys and Triumphs and Hondas and Suzukis and I was loving

KHUIITETITTTETTTTEEIEL T donated a football and a Fantastic 4 action figure set. It had
two toys in it so it was pretty cool. They talked and moved and crap. Just wanted to
let everyone know what I was up to. Bye!

I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for bn Jan. 5. I'm packing up Will's and my room
soon and it's making me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so weird not
having my best friend with me. I don't want to be without him but it doesn't seem
like I have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to go. Have you been through
this situation? How did u deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling 20
different emotions and I have no idea how to deal with it.
