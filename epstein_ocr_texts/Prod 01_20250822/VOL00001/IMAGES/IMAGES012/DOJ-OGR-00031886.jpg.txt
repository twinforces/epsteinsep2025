would be speaking with her. She expressed if her daughter had information, she wanted to assist. We
interviewed [who denied having any inappropriate encounters with Jeff (Epstein). She stated she had gone to
Jeff's House with Haley Robson approximately eight months ago, and sat in the kitchen with the house chef, but
nothing happened. As the parents were present during the interview, we felt that J was withholding information

and advised should she wish to speak with me again to telephone me. Sgt Frick and I thanked Mrs. S for her
time and left the area. She stated she would ask J again after we left as to what happened at Epstein’s house. I
