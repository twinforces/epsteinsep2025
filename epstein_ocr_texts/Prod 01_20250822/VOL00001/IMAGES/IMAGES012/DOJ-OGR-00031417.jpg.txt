into a circular flagstone drive way was in the open position. The
western most gate was in the closed position. The front was
locked on my approach and I continued traveling to the west
where there is a small double gate which has a sign, "Please keep
gate closed". This gate was opened and leads to a large patio with
a swimming pool. To the west of the swimming pool is a walk
way leading to a dock which then leads directly across to the intra
coastal waterway. The dock was examined and checked for any
signs of a boat tying up or the presence of anyone that may have
left either debris such food containers, cigarettes, cigars etc. None
was found. It should be noted that the exterior temperature was
79 degrees and the humidity was 63 percent. There is a small
cabana at the southern end of the pool which had computer
equipment as well as exercise equipment. None of this had been
touched or tampered with.
On the south side of the residence in the southwest corner Mr.
Epstein indicated that he believed this was the area that the
intruder made entry to the residence. The room is a computer
room and Florida type room and has three double sliding glass
windows present. The eastern most and western most are
identical in shape having two glass panels. The central one has
three glass panels and is the only one of the three that has a set of
14 flagstones leading directly into the room. The flooring is a
wood type of flooring and the western set of sliding doors was
found ajar, however the sandy area directly outside of the door did
not indicate the presence of shoe prints or barefoot prints. The
central window was found ajar and still had the lock mechanism
in the extended outward position. The two windows believed to
have been entered were processed and no latent fingerprints were
found on the western most, no fingerprints were found on the
eastern most. There was one mark that was found that was not a
fingerprint but could have been made from either a cloth or a
xubber glove and this was found on the interior of the central
window .
Once inside the residence, the person went over to a desk which is
a veneer covered desk and there was a black bag underneath. The
black bag is approximately 2' long by 1' high and was placed on
the southern side of the interior of the desk by the pedestal. The
individual knelt down and pulled the case open and removed cash
from a white envelope. There were thirteen one hundred dollar
bills left, still in the envelope when I examined it. The thirteen
one hundred dollar bills were removed in the presence of Det.
Melnichok and Mr. Epstein and they were counted and turned
directly over to Mr. Epstein for security purposes. The top of the
desk, sides of the desk and bottom of the desk was processed for
latent fingerprints and no latent fingerprints of value were found
on those areas. The envelope will be transported to headquarters
and processed chemically for latent fingerprints. There will be a
supplement to that effect that will follow.
