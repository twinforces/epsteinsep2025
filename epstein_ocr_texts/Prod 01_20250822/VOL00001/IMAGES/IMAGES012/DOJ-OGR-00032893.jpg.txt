massages.
He was asked if he remembered any names of the girls that massaged
Epstein. He tried to remember and was unable to provide any exact
names of any girls. Alessi was asked about any contact with anyone
from the Epstein organization. Alessi said he did speak with Mr.
Epstein shortly after my initial contact with him to find out what was
going on. Alessi also stated that approximately on November 11, 2005,
he was contacted by a private investigator from the Law Office of Roy
Black. The investigator had called him to meet with him to ascertain
what he was going to tell the police. Alessi stated they met at the
Carrabba s Restaurant in Boynton Beach and discussed the same
questions I was asking him. I informed Mr. Alessi and Mr. Morrell
that as this is an ongoing investigation and anything we discuss
should be confidential. They both acknowledged the fact that the
information would be kept confidential. It should be noted that a
court reporter was present during the interviews and would be
providing a copy of the statements to me when they become available.
On November 21, 2005, I received a voice mail from Mr. Fronstin who
advised he would not be making Mr. Epstein available for any
statements. He did have some words that he wanted to relay on behalf
of Mr. Epstein. I telephoned his office and left a message for him to
return my call.
On November 29, 2005, I received a call back from Mr. Fronstin who
left a voice mail after hours on November 28, 2005, advising he would
return my call during normal business hours to speak with me reference
the case on November 29, 2005.

On November 29, 2005, at approximately 2:30 p.m. I received a
telephone call on the department issued cell phone. Mr. Fronstin
stated he was calling to relay information that Mr. Epstein wished he
could relay. Mr. Fronstin stated that he would not allow Mr. Epstein
to speak with me at this time. He further stated that Mr. Epstein is
very passionate about massages. He continued that Mr. Epstein had
allegedly donated over $100,000 to the Ballet of Florida for massages.
The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound for him that is
why he has had many massages. Mr. Fronstin stated he appreciated the
way the investigation has not been leaked out into the media. I
explained to Mr. Fronstin that it is as important to protect the
innocent if the allegations are not substantiated. Mr. Fronstin was
told of the allegations that the private investigators assigned to the
case have been portraying themselves as police officers.
Additionally, I explained that my cell phone had been called by the
private investigators. Mr. Fronstin advised he was not aware of that
and advised they were under the direction of Attorney Roy Black in
