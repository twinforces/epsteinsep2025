what kind of gifts. Rodriguez stated he purchased IPODS, jewelry,
anything the girls would want.
Rodriguez stated the amount of girls that came to the house was
approximately fifteen. Each of the girls knew each other and all
seemed to know at [RRMMHigh School who Mr. Epstein was.
When asked to identify these girls, Rodriguez stated he could not at
the moment but knew he wrote their names down on a journal he kept
during his employ with Mr. Epstein. He kept a journal in the event he
needed to explain either to Mr. Epstein or his assistants what was
done at the house or who visited the house as he stated he was
in-charge of Mr. Epstein's personal security while in Palm Beach. I
informed him I would need to view this journal to which he stated he
would research the book and contact me to provide the book. The
interview was concluded and left the area. I returned back to the
police station where the micro cassette was placed into evidence. At
approximately 7:20 pm, I was notified Rodriguez located the journal
and would call me on January 5, 2005 to provide the journal.

On January 5, 2006, I attempted to meet with Alfredo Rodriguez to
recover the folder or journal in which he kept the notes that were
given to him during his employ with Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. He kept this
folder to justify what he did during his employ should the need arise
to justify what occurred with the monies he had to keep or any
questions as to the petty cash he withdrew from the household account
from the bank. At approximately 10:00 pm, I attempted contact with
Mr. Rodriguez and discovered he was assisting his wife at her place of
employment and would not be able to meet with me. Mr. Rodriguez
stated he would meet with me on January 6, 2006, in Broward County, in
the morning hours.
On January 6, 2006, at approximately 9:00 am, I received a telephone
call from Mr. Rodriguez who advised he had the file in hand and would
be traveling northbound to meet with me in Broward County. At 10:50
am, I met with Alfredo Rodriguez at the parking lot of Bank of America
in Boca Raton on Yamato Road and Military Trail (known as the Polo
Center). Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents,
a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary with direction to deliver a
bucket of roses to NE: ch School after
high school drama performance. Also in that same note was direction
to rent a car for [J MMMM and direction to extend the rental
contract. I returned to the Palm Beach Police Station and placed the
folder into evidence.
