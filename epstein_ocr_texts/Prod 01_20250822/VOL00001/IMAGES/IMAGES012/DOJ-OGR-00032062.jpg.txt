of the charmingly inevitable accidents of Epstein’s rise, Greenberg was a senior partner of the house;
Bear Stearns CEO Jimmy Cayne later told New York that Epstein’s forte was dealing with wealthier
clients, helping them with their overall portfolios. Leslie Wexner, founder of Limited Brands, reportedly |
made Epstein his financial adviser and was instrumental in building his fortune. Epstein was no
footman; be loved luxury and, in his own words, saw himself as a financial architect, someone who
could show the rich how to live with their money. “I want people to understand the power, the |
responsibility, and the burden of their money,” he once wrote. At times, his powers seemed magical. “

mathematics to psychology to biology. He takes the smallest amount of information and gets the correct

A Columbia University geneticist says Epstein has that insight in science, too. “He has the ability to
make connections that other minds can’t make,” says Richard Axel, a Nobel Prize winner. “He is
