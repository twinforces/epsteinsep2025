requested a court reporter to be present to take the statement of the

years, from the period of 1994 through 2002. She advised she had

house cleaning, shopping and other preparations when Epstein would
arrive in town. Alessi stated the preparations consisted of preparing
the house and bathrooms for his arrival. She advised she did view
several masseuses that arrived at the house. She advised that two or
three girls would come during a day and provide the massages. The
