second day that we were here but all I did was get
applications. The day after that I was like "fuck this”
and didn't turn them in. I was just so tired.

Yesterday is when I took them. I ended up getting a
job at Victoria's Secret. I only get paid $6.40 an
hour but hopefully that will change soon. I also get a
discount at all of the Limited stores, Express stores
and Bath & Body Works. I like my boss so far, I
mean I've only met her twice but she's pretty cool.
Will is trying to get a job at FYE. He likes music so I
think it's a good fit for him. I really hope he gets it.
The boss guy called him back to set up an interview
the day he came in with the application, I think that's
a good sign. It starts at 4pm. He's at the mall right
now. I got to call him and ask him how it went ina
lil’ while. It's only 3:45 right now. Oh, it was so
funny - I used him as one of my references for my VS
job and the lady called me back and told me that
William Tucker gave me such an outstanding refrence
that she didn't need to call anyone else back,.....he
got me the job! Just like that. He made me sound
fucking great,..I lied and said that he was the old
stock manager for Hollister. She bought it. Str8. No
complaints from me. Ok,...well I'm gonna go smoke

.f some resin (sp?) considering I have a limited supply
of mary j and have to conserve. I miss everyone back

' home. ilove you guys. Don't forget about me.
