f pee this is part of something i saved, from you. i
: & Ree came across it tonight and it made me happy:
ee rs | | "I just want to kiss her on the forehead and tell
2) 6 qm her she’s the most beautiful girl in the world”
ae eee) | right back at you, missy. that, along with the
| rest of what you said, meant a lot to me then,
| . aS and still does. how serendipitous that i found it
tonight. (it was a crying in the back room
night.) =\
j meant to call you from work, but i'm sam,
thus, i didn't want to be a burden. and i have
no idea where my phone even is, as usual,
regardless, i hope you're having an okey
wonderful weekend... |
