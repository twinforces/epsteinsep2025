On 10/13/03, Det. Pagan and I went to 1515 So. Flagler
Drive, Apt. #1901, West Palm Beach, Florida, in an
attempt to locate suspect Juan Alessi. As we were
getting into the elevator on the ground floor, we came in
' contact with Alessi's wife, Marie Alessi. I explained to
Marie why we were there and she agreed to speak to us.
Marie said she and her husband, Juan Alessi, have been
separated for approximately two months and they are
going through divorce proceedings. Marie said Juan no
longer lives with her at this address and she has a court
erder which states Juan is to have no contact with her.
Marie said on this date, at approximately 1100 hours,
duan drove by her as she was walking out of the Rogas
Department Store located on the southeast corner of
Okeechobee Blvd. and Military Trail. Marie said Juan
waved at her and that was the extent of their contact.
Marie said she does not know where Juan is living. She
said he is driving a white Caravan. Marie supplied me
with Juan's cell phone number, 309-5439. Marie
advised Juan has been depressed lately, due to their
separation. I advised Marie to be aware of her
surroundings and be on the lookout for Juan and if she
comes in contact with him to call the police
immediately. Marie also supplied me with her son's
phone number, John Alessi, 309-2645.
I called Juan Alessi on his cell phone. Juan agreed to
come to the Palm Beach Police Station for an interview.
Juan arrived at the police department and I placed him
in the interview room in the Detective Bureau. I read
Juan his Miranda Rights from a prepared rights card in
which he stated he understood and signed .
I asked Juan what his connection was with Mr. Epstein,
