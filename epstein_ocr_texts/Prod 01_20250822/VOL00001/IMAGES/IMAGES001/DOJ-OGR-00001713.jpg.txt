seeking the Court’s assistance with two critical issues ‘that. greatly impact. Ms. Maxwell’s. ability
to receive a fair trial:on the schedule set. by the Court, First, we tequest that the Court enter an.
order directing ‘the government to. disclose ‘to defense counsel ‘the identities of the three alleged.
victims referenced in the indictment (“Victims, 1-3’), subject to the'restrictions of the protective:
order entered by ‘the Gourt, so that. Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel can meaningfully
inveStigate. the. alleged conduct, which is low over 25 years old. Second,'we request that the
Court enter an. order. directing the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) ‘to release Ms. Maxwell into the

while she is detained s SO, ‘that she cz can n meaningfully participate n.the:preparation of her defense.
1. Disclosure of Victim Identities

The Court: should order the government ‘to disclose the identities of Victims 1-3 to
defense. counsel, subject to the restrictions of the: protective order, because ‘Ms. Maxwell. cannot.
préparé for orréceive a fair'trial without this. information. Moreover, the, requested. disclosure is
duthorized -uiidet the Jaw: in this Circuit, and :is natrowly-tailored and reasonable under ‘the

accounts of Victinis, 1-3, the threé individuals specifically réferenced. in the indictment. It is
thérefore critical. for the defense to know the names of these individuals. as Soon as possible, 0)
