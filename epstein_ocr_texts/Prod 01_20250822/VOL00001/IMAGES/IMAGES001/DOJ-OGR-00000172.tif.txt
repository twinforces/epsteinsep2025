allegedly facilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme.
The defense sought a government promise not to
prosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed
Epstein employees, and a promise to forego immigration
proceedings against two of the female assistants:
Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions
of the Agreement also precludes the initiation
of any and all criminal charges which might
otherwise in the future be brought against
[four named female assistants] or any employee
of [a specific Epstein-owned corporate entity]
for any criminal charge that arises out of the
ongoing federal investigation .... Further, no
immigration proceeding will be instituted
against [two named female assistants] as a
result of the ongoing investigation.
The second new provision related to the USAO’s
efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:
Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions
of the Agreement resolves any and all out-
standing [legal process] that have requested
witness testimony and/or the production of
documents and/or computers in relation to
the investigation that is the subject of the
Agreement. Each [legal process] will be
withdrawn upon the execution of the
Agreement and will not be re-issued absent
reliable evidence of a violation of the agree-
ment. Epstein and his counsel agree that the
computers that are currently under [legal
process] will be safeguarded in their current
condition by Epstein’s counsel or their agents
until the terms and conditions of the Agree-
ment are fulfilled.
