Part II — The likely outcome of an extradition request from the United States of
America to France in the case of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell

33. In this case, if an extradition request were to be transmitted by the USA against Ms
Ghislaine Maxwell, the French judicial authorities would most certainly decide that she
has to remain in custody given her flight from the USA and the violation of her bail terms
and conditions in this requesting State.

34. Having outlined the different stages of the French extradition procedure, the second part
of this opinion will examine the likely outcome of an extradition request against the
person of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, if she were to be released on bail and decided to flee
from the USA to France. It will first outline the general bars to extradition (A), and then
analyze the status of the protection of nationals from extradition in the French legal
system and in the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France (B). It will conclude
that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell’s extradition from France to the USA would not be legally
barred by her French citizenship, and that it is highly unlikely, under the specific and
unique circumstances of this case, that French authorities will refuse to enforce an
extradition decree.

A. General bars to extradition

35. Several bars to extradition may classically be invoked before French courts, namely (1)
a claim that the requested person would be at risk of human rights violations in the
requesting State (with regards to the right to a fair trial and the right to be free from
torture, inhumane or degrading treatment); (11) the dual criminality rule; and (iii) a claim
that the extradition request is politically motivated.

(i) Human rights bars

36. Under the case law of the French Cour de cassation, the Investigating Chamber of the
Court of appeal must consider allegations of human rights violations pertaining to the
conditions of trial and detention in the requesting State!’. These claims center on the
right to a fair trial (Article 6 ECHR)!° and the right to be free from torture, inhumane
