1 IT took it and threw it at him.

2 At that point, I ran to the door again and figured out
3 how to get out of there. A girl outside asked me where I was

4 going and she said to be careful. She said that Mr. Epstein

5 knew a lot of powerful people, including Bill Clinton, and that
6 if I didn't do what Mr. Epstein wanted, I would not be able to
7 have any job in the industry.

8 I was so scared. I couldn't wait to get out of there,
9 and I left. I took the train home. I had spent all of my

10 Savings getting Victoria's Secret lingerie to prepare for what
11 I thought would be my audition. But instead, it seemed Like a
12 casting call for prostitution. I felt like I was in hell.

13 Thank you, your Honor.

14 Thank you.

15 THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Allred.

16 Was there anybody else, any victim's counsel or any of
17 the other victims who have not been heard and wish to be heard?
18 Well, OK then. All I have to say, really, is thank

19 you, all of you, for your participation in today's remarkable
20 hearing. I think everybody has benefited greatly from your
21 input, and especially from the testimony of victims here today
22 and who have had the courage to come forward.
23 We have also benefited throughout these proceedings,
24 however brief altogether, from the attorneys' legal advocacy
25 and their written and oral submissions. I'm grateful to them
