Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 142 Filed 02/04/21 Page 15 of 38
Id. Thus, the NPA limits the benefit to Epstein to immunity “in this District.”

Next, the NPA sets forth 13 provisions labeled “Terms of the Agreement.” These include
the details of Epstein’s guilty plea and proposed sentence in the Florida state court, as well as
Epstein’s agreement to waive his right to contest jurisdiction, liability, and damages up to an
agreed-upon amount in certain civil actions brought by identified victims. NPA at 3-5.

In the paragraph following the “Terms of the Agreement,” the NPA provides that

will not institute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of

Epstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or

Nadia Marcinkova.

NPA at 5 (emphasis added). Unlike the provision that Epstein will not be prosecuted “in this

the Federal Grand Jury investigation” (id. at 2), the sentence regarding co-conspirators contains
no limitation on the scope of conduct for which “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” cannot be
