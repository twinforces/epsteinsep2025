Re: United States-v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully: writes to bring the: Court’s attention to a recent decision. by
Judge Crotty in United States v. Schulte, 17 Cr. 548: (PAC), which jis attached hereto as Exhibit, ‘1
(“Schulte Op.”). In that case, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss'the ifidictment on November
16, 2020 (see 17 Cr. 548 (PAC), ECF No. 435), which was virtually identical in:multiple respects
to the January 25, 202,1 motion to dismiss the indictment filed by defendant Ghislaine Maxwell in,
the above-captioned, case (See 20 Cr. 330 (AIN), ECE No. 126). Like: Maxwell, the defendant in.
Schulte asserted, among other things, a.claim, under, the Sixth Amendment of the Constitution,
arguing that. the indictment should be dismissed because the grand. jury sitting’ in, White Plains
unfairly underrepresented Black and Hispanic individuals. Judge Crotty rejected those claims: in.

their entirety and, denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss. Judge Crotty’s thorough, well-

reasoned decision supports the Government’s-position ‘in this case.
