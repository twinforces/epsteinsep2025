constitutes a “compelling reason” requiring her release. S/ephens, 2020 WL. 1295155 at «3°
Even speaking by phone: with.Ms..Maxwell presents daunting challenges due to COVID-
19-related protocols requiring ‘at least72 hours’ notice'to schedule a.call, unless it is urgent; in,
which case counsel can émail a request'to the MDC. As, counsel learnéd this past.week,,
however, even an-urgent call. request does not mean the call. will take place in the time required.
At approximately 5:30 p.m. on, July 6, 2020, the Court: ordered us to confer with Ms. Maxwell,
about waiving her physical presence atthe atraigninent, initial appearance, and bail hearing, arid
ordered. counsel for both sides to jointly;report back by 9:00-p.m. that night, with,a, proposed date
and time ‘for these-:proceedings. We promptly emailed’the MDC 'to request. an urgent. call,
making specific reference to'the Gourt’s Order, but were not connected: with Ms. Maxwell until
9:00 p.m. There will no doubt be other orders of the Court with no guarantees we will be able to:
reach our ¢lient'in time. if she is detained.’ In addition, during this past.week, Ms. Maxwell’has
not been able to physically review documents and has had limited access to writing materials.
The prohibition, on in-person, visits. means we must:read to her any. documents requiring’ her
review, and she, has’virtually‘no ability to také notes. The age of the allégations in-this ase

compound these problems. Under'the current circumstances, Ms. Maxwell.cannot review

* Since the Court issued jts: epinion:in Stephens, numerous other courts in. this District have ordered, defendants
released on.bail, over the government’s objection, due:to. the:pandemic and its impact on the defendant’s.ability to
prepare for-trial. See, eg:, United States a. Carrillo- Villa, 20-MIJ-3073 (SLC) (SDNY. Apr. 6, 2020) (releasing;
undocumented defendant i in drug conspiracy case because of inability: to. meaningfully communicate with law yer and
risk: :of COVID- L2G Mnited States v. Hudson, ‘19-CR-496: (GM) (S: DINCY.. Mar. 19, 2020) (releasing defendant in
drug conspiracy, loansharking, and, extortion case, whose two prior, pre- -COVID-19 bail applications, were denied,
because of-inability-to;prepare. for upcoming trial and:risk of COVID- 19); United. States. Chandler, ‘19-GR-867
(PAC), 2020 WL: 1528120, sat #1. (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 31,.2020) (releasing defendant on felon in: possession case, with
prior manslaughter conviction, duc to inability to:prepare for trial due:to COVID-1.9:restrictions).

’ The government has recently-worked with:the BOP to set up a-standing call between counsel and Ms. Maxwell
‘each morning until thezinitial appearance. to facilitate.attorney-clientcommunications. While-we greatly appreciate;
these efforts, they: are:a short-term patch to a:persistent problem that shows no signs:of abating. Nor would it be:
appropriate, onan, ongoing basis,. for the: prosecutors to be:involved insand dictate the date and time-of our
communications withour client in connection with the-preparation‘of our-defense.
