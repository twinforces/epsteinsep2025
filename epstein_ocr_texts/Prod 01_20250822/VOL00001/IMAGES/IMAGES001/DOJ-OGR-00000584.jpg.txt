Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36- Filed 07/24/19 Page 74 of 74 4

1 of the Crime Victims' Rights Act and the rights of the victims,
2 particularly the way in which they're being treated in this

5 particular process which is different than last time.

4 So with that, if your Honor had any questions to

5 educate the Court on the CVRA case, I would answer them. But

6 otherwise, she would just like to make a statement. Thank you.
7 THE COURT: Absolutely.

8 MS. WILD: Hi, your Honor. My name is Courtney Wild.
9 I was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein starting at the age of
10 14. And I would just like to ask the Court to not grant him

11 bond, to keep him in detention just for the safety of any other
12 girls out there that are going through what I'm going through.
13 It is a public case, and it's just -- he's a scary person to

14 have walking the streets.

15 THE COURT: Where did that occur? The sexual

16 inappropriateness.

17 MS. WILD: In Palm Beach, Florida.

18 THE COURT: Great. Thank you so much.

19 MS. WILD: Thank you.
20 THE COURT: I think that concludes our work for today.
al T'll hopefully see you all on Thursday. Thanks very much.
