Re: United States-v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government:respectfully submits'this letter in response to the Court’s January.25,20211
order allowing: the partics to respond. to a letter from legal counscl at the Metropolitan Detention,
Center (“MDC”) also dated January 25, 2021. (Dkt. No. 117). In particular, MDC Icgal. counsel.
asks the, Court to'vacate its, January: 15,.2021 order directing the MDC to ‘permit the defendant fo
Use a, laptop. to review discovery on. weekends and. holidays. While the Government has. no
objection to the defendant’s request. for additional. laptop access, the Government also gencrally
defers'to the MDC regarding, x how. it manages its inmate population. The Government:will continue
to defer to the MDC here, particularly because the defendant. has had ample access to discovery
even'without laptop access on, weekends and holidays.

Given the Volume of discovery iin. this-case, ‘which totals more: than two million pages, the
Government and the MDG:‘have: both made: significant efforts ‘to ensure: that the defendant has
extensive access to: her discovery: materials. Sinec the Government: made its first. discovery:
production in August 2020, the defendant has ‘had ‘exclusive ‘access to a.BOP desktop computer in,
the MDC on'which to review her discovery. When’ the defendant. complained of technical, issues
reviewing: ‘portions. of ‘her discovery’ on, that desktop computer, the Government produced.
reformatted copics of discovery: ‘materials and instructions: regarding how-to open particular files.
‘Because:the defendant continued to complain thatshe was unable:to: review ccrtain, discovery ; files
on the desktop'computer, the Government.agrecd to provide a laptop for the defendant to use’ in,
her review of discovery. On November: 18, 2020, the Government hand delivered. the laptop to
the MDG for the defendant’s cxelusive use.

As the Court is aware, the defendant-has received, and continues to reccive more time: to
review her discovery than any other ‘inmate at the MDC. In particular, the: MDC permits the
defendant. to review discovery thirteen hours ‘per day, seven days per weck. On, weekdays, the
MDC. permits ‘the defendant to use the laptop during her thirteen. hours of daily review time. On
weekends and holidays, the MDC. would ordinarily only allow the defendant ‘to. use: the BOP
‘desktop computer, which provides access to much of the discovery material. While, as noted.
above, the: Government’has no particular objection to the: defendant’s request for weekend access
