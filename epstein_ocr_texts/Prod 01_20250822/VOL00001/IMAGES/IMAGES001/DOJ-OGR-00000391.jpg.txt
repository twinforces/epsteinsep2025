5 THE COURT: I have a question about the Southern

6 District of Florida nonprosecution agreement dated probably in
7 2008 -- is that correct?

8 MR. ROSSMILLER: It's dated in 2007, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: Is that a public document?

10 MR. WEINGARTEN: It is, your Honor. It's been

11 publicly filed in connection with other civil litigation.

12 THE COURT: Does that agreement bear on in any way the
13 search and results of the search that were conducted at Mr.

14 Epstein's townhouse over the weekend?

15 MR. ROSSMILLER: Not in ways that I am aware of now,
16 your Honor. Again, we are very much in progress on the search.
17 We will continue to consider any other implications beyond this
18 case as we continue to review those materials.

19 On a separate note, your Honor, I want to add the
20 government noted it is aware of its victim obligations. In
21 terms of notification, we have made notification to individuals
22 that we are in particular aware of. We also have listed a
23 phone number for victims to be in touch with the FBI, with the
24 U.S. Attorney's office. We have also put a website up and have
25 asked victims to be in touch with us through those sources as
