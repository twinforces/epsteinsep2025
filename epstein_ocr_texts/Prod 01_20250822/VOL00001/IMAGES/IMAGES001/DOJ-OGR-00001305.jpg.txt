line by line in a way that is not possible through a screen. The fact that the interview room will be
unavailable when the Aspen courtroom is in use is also unacceptable because the courtroom has
been, and will be, in frequent use, just as it was when the parties in this case met all day for the
Daubert hearing and pretrial conference on February 4. The Court’s calendar is also constantly
shifting, meaning that the defense team will have little to no ability to confidently predict when
they will be able to meet with Mr. Robertson. The proposal involving the Santa Fe County
Detention Center fares no better. The government’s language is tellingly equivocal. First, it states
that “the Santa Fe jail is potentially willing to amend their policy that currently bars in-person
attorney visits in response to this Court’s concerns.” Doc. 298 at 1 (emphasis added). Later, the
government writes that the jail is willing to allow in-person meetings, but that it will “work to
accommodate in-person visits between Robertson and his attorneys.” /d. at 2 (emphasis added).
Rather than inspire confidence, the language of government’s motion reflects the high level of
uncertainty that our jails have operated with over the last year. The truth remains that the Santa
Fe County Detention Center, like all jails, can still go into a full and indefinite lockdown at any
time due to the continued spread of COVID-19 (and potentially the virus’s recent and more
infectious variants). The Court also does not want to put the jail or the defense team at risk of
COVID-19 because the jail feels compelled to deviate from what it believes are its best safety
practices. Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. Robertson the
consistent and predictable in-person contact with his defense attorneys that he needs.

Finally, the Court will not grant the requested stay pending appeal, as it noted in its earlier
release order. Doc. 300. First, the government has failed to cite or apply the legal standard for
such a stay. See D.N.M. Local R. Crim. P. 47.7 (“A motion, response or reply must cite authority
in support of legal positions advanced.”). Second, the Court does not agree that the government
