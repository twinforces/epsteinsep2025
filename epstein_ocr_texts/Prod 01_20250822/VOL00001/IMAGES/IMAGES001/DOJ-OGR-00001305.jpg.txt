line by line'in a -way that is not possible through.a sereen.. The fact.that the interview room will be
unavailable when the Aspen courtroom is in use. is also, unacceptable becausé the: courtroom. has
been, and will. be, in. frequent use, just as :it. was when. the parties in this case met all day for. the:
Daubert hearing and ‘pretrial conference on, February 4. The Court’s calendar iis ‘also constantly:
shifting, meaning that the defense team will. havé little. to no ability’ to confidently predict ‘when.
they'will be able to. meet. with Mr, Robertson. The ‘proposal, involving the Santa Fe: County:
Detention:Center‘fares no better. The government’s language'is tellingly'‘cquivocal. First, it states
that “the. Santa Fe jail.is potentially willing to amend their policy that currently: bars.:in-person.

COVID-19 because the jail, feels compelled to deviate from. what it, believes are its best. safety
‘practices. Neither of the government’s proposals are adequate to provide Mr. Robertson the
consistent. and predictable in-person contact with his defense attorneys that he:needs.

Finally, the Court’will not.grant the requested,stay pending appeal, as it noted in. its carlier
release order. Doc. 300. First, ‘the. government has failed to. cite, or apply the legal standard for
such a.stay. See’D.N/M. Local R. ‘Crim. P..47-7 (“A. motion, response or reply must cite authority

in, support of legal positions advaneed.”).. Second, the Court docs not ‘agree that-the: government.
