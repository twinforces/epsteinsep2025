in the U.S, Virgin Islands, his principal residence, Florida, and New York. Mr. Epstein, has
scrupulously fulfilled his obligations i in every jurisdiction i in which he was'required to register
throughout the 10-year hiatus between his rélease and ‘present arrest. All of his travel. has. been
meticulously: reported to the registration authoritics so that they'have been aware of his precise:
location every: single day:for the: past 10 years. Better: still, the pending charges date back. 14-17
years, from 2002 to 2005. Yet, tellingly, they allege: no recurrence of the conduct underlying the
NPA and Florida. state conviction, at;any time in the ensuing decade ‘and a half (2005-2019).

under 18 U.S.C. §1591. Any’perception that Mr. Epstein, poses any’ conceivable danger or flight

risk may be readily dispelled by a’slate of highly-restrictive conditions, which amply suffice’ to
secure his ‘release?
