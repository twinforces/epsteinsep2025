Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 144 Filed 02/04/21 Page 10 of 25

No statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense

involving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of 18 years shall

preclude such prosecution before the child reaches the age of 25 years.

18 U.S.C. § 3283 (1994). Thus, if an individual committed an offense involving the sexual or
physical abuse of a 16-year-old person on June 1, 1994, and the victim reached age 17 on July 1,
1994, then the statute of limitations as to that offense would have expired on July 1, 2002, when
the victim reached age 25—-such that an indictment in 2020 would be time-barred. There is no
dispute that all three of the accusers here turned 25 long ago, and thus the statute of limitations in
effect at the time of the offenses has expired.

In 2003, however, Congress amended the statute and extended the time in which a
prosecution could be brought to within the life of the victim. See 2003 Amendment at 660.7 18
U.S.C. § 3283, as amended in 2003, provided as follows:

No statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense

involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of

18 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child.

18 U.S.C. § 3283 (2003). While the government would apply the 2003 Amendment retroactively
to offenses Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have committed years earlier, nothing in the text suggests
that the statute may be applied retroactively.

To the contrary, the Supreme Court has repeatedly stressed a strong “presumption against
retroactive legislation” that is “deeply rooted in our jurisprudence.” Landgraf v. USI Film Prod.,
511 USS. 244, 265 (1994) (emphasis added). “[T]he principle that the legal effect of conduct
should ordinarily be assessed under the law that existed when the conduct took place has
timeless and universal appeal.” /d. (internal quotation omitted). “Retroactivity is not favored in
° The statute was amended again in 2006 to its current version, which further modifies the limitations period to the
life of the victim or 10 years after the offense, whichever is longer. 18 U.S.C. § 3283. Because all three of the
alleged victims identified in Counts One through Four are alive, the 2006 amendment does not affect the analysis
here. Moreover, the government relies on the 2003 Amendment. Gov. Mem. at 5-6.
