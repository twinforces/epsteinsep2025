This Reply responds to the arguments the Government does raise:
1. The Court did not conduct a “lengthy bail hearing.” Resp.42.
The ‘transcript of the video arraignment and bail hearing spans only 91
pages, with the bail arguments on pages 22-79. The Government did not

bail hearing, each time the Government mentioned the strength of its
case, it cited to the Indictment. See, e.g., Ex.D, p.24 (“Turning first to the
.. strength of the evidence, the indictment in this case. arises .... The
indictment further chargés that ...”); pg..25 (“The indictment makes plain

evidence ... there is an. incredibly strong incentive for the défendant to flee
..). The court erred in agreeing that.the Indictment itself demonstrates
strength. 7d. at 82 (“[I]t is appropriate to consider the strength of the
evidence proffered by the government in assessing risk of flight. The
government’s evidence at this early juncture of the case appears strong.
Although the charged conduct took place:many years ago, the indictment
describes. ...”). At no point did the Government introduce or even proffer

any actual evidence.
