of the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.
Those motions became fully briefed one week ago and are now pending before this Court. The
Government strenuously contests each of the motions and the Court has not yet adjudicated
them. Without prejudging the merits of any of those pending motions and mindful of the
presumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view that in light of the proffered strength
and nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See Dec.
Op. at 9-10.

The Court’s assessment of the Defendant’s history and characteristics has not changed.
See Dec. Op. at 10-16. The Defendant continues to have substantial international ties, familial
and personal connections abroad, substantial financial resources, and experience evading
detection. /d. at 10-11. And the Court’s concerns regarding the Defendant’s lack of candor
regarding her assets when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. As the Court
emphasized in its denial of the second motion for release on bail, the discrepancies between the
information presented to the Court and to Pretrial Services in July 2020 and the information
presented to the Court in December 2020 raised significant concerns about candor. See Dec. Op.
at 16. There remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of
conditions of release. Jd. While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cutting in
the opposite direction, including the Defendant’s family ties in the United States, these do not
overcome the weight of the considerations that lean in favor of continued detention.

As aresult, none of the evidence or arguments presented in this third motion for bail alter
the Court’s assessment of the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to
favor release, the first three factors and the presumption of detention all support the conclusion
