Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide an update regarding the
defendant’s conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pursuant to
the Court’s Order dated December 8, 2020. (Dkt. No. 92). This update is based on information
provided to the Government by MDC legal counsel regarding the conditions of the defendant’s
confinement over the last two months.

The defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate
at the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permitted to review her discovery thirteen hours per
day, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to both a
desktop computer provided by the MDC and a laptop computer provided by the Government on
which to review discovery. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the
MDC desktop computer to send and receive emails with her attorneys.! This discovery review
' Per BOP policy, all inmate emails are routinely purged every six months. In response to
complaints from the defendant and defense counsel regarding prematurely deleted emails, MDC
staff examined the defendant’s inmate email account. That examination revealed that the
defendant had herself deleted some of her emails and had archived others. That examination
revealed no evidence to suggest that MDC staff deleted any of the defendant’s emails.
