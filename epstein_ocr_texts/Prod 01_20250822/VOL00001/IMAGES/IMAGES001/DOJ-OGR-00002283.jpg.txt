INTRODUCTION

Ms. Maxwell, pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a) and 14, requests that the Court enter an
order severing Counts Five and Six of the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) from Counts
One through Four because these Counts have been improperly joined and a joint trial would
result in substantial prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.

Counts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell made materially false
statements at two civil depositions in 2016 that were part of a defamation action brought against
her more than twenty years after the conduct alleged in Counts One through Four supposedly
took place (1994-1997). The plaintiff in the defamation action, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, made
wild and false accusations that she had been sexually trafficked by Epstein and Ms. Maxwell to
dozens of famous politicians, professors, foreign leaders, and others. When Ms. Maxwell denied
these allegations as false, Giuffre sued for defamation. Discovery conducted in the defamation
action established that Giuffre’s stories, sold to tabloids for large sums of money, were in fact
false. Those accused by Ms. Giuffre, Professor Alan Dershowitz, for example, denounced her as
a “serial liar.” Regardless, Ms. Giuffre is not one of the three accusers identified in Counts One
through Four of the Superseding Indictment and her claims relate to a different time period
entirely. Allowing Counts Five and Six to be tried along with Counts One through Four will
significantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell because it will allow the government to introduce testimony
of alleged sexual abuse that purportedly occurred outside of the time period alleged in Counts
One through Four, despite the fact that Ms. Maxwell (unlike Jeffrey Epstein) was never
criminally charged with that conduct. As a result, the jury may convict Ms. Maxwell of Counts
One through Four based on an improper inference of criminal propensity.

Furthermore, the Court and the jury and the Court will have to resolve numerous complex
legal and factual issues in connection with the perjury charges that will lengthen and complicate
