INTRODUCTION

Ms. Maxwell, pursuant‘to Fed. :R. Crim. P.-8(a) and. 14, requests, that the Court enter an
order severing Counts Five and Six of the Superseding. Indictment (“Indictinent”) from Counts
One through Four because these Counts have been improperly joined and a.joint trial would.
result. in substantial prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.

Counts Five aiid Six-of the Indictinent allege that-Ms. Maxwell made materially false
her more than twenty years, after the conduct alleged in:Counts, One through Four supposedly
took: place: (1994-1997). The plaintiff in the defamation action, Virginia. Roberts Giuffre, made
wild and. false accusations that she had. been, sexually. trafficked by Epstein ‘and, Ms. Maxwell to
dozens of famous politicians, professors, forcign.Icaders, and others. When. Ms. Maxwell denied
these: allegations as false, Giuffre sued for defamation. Discovery conducted. in the defamation
action established that Giuffre’s, stories, sold to tabloids for large:sums of money, were in fact
false. Those accused by Ms. Giuffre, Professor Alan. Dershowitz, for‘examiple, denounecd her as
a “serial liar.” Regardless, Ms. Giuffre isnot one of'the three accusers identified in;Counts: One
through Four of the Superseding Indictment. and her claims relate to a different time-period
entirely. Allowing Counts.Five and. Six.to be tried along with Counts Onc through Four will
significantly prejudice’ Ms., Maxwell’because it will allow the government.to introduce testimony:
of alleged, sexual abuse that purportedly occurred outside of the'time period alleged:in Counts
One through Four, despite the: fact that-Ms. Maxwell (unlike Jeffrey Epstein) was never
criminally charged, with.that:conduct. As.a, result, the jury;may conviet Ms. Maxwell, of Counts
One through Four based on an. improper inferetice. of criminal propensity.

legal and. factual issues in connection withthe perjury charges that will lengthen.and complicate
