chance.” (Schulte Br: at 17.) But'the Court will not assume of infer that this. District has been
operating under an intentionally discriminatory Jury Plan since:2009. Seé Rioux,.97 F:3d.at-659
(rejecting Equal Protection, challenge due to lack of evidence showing intentional
discrimination). Therefore, the. Defendant’s Equal. Protection claim.must be‘rejected.

I. JSSA.

Schulte’s remaining'claims arise under the JSSA. To succeed on.these claims, he must
demonstrate-a “substantial failure to comply” with the JSSA’s provisions.. LaChance, 788 F.2d
at 870.. “Mere technical yiolations:of the procedures prescribed. by the Act do not constitute
substantial failure to comply with its provisions.” Jd. (cleaned up). The criteria for
differentiating betwééri.a substantial and technical error tums on the “nature and extent:of its
effects[.]” Jd. The.Court holds that Schulte cannot.demonstrate a substantial failure to comply
with the JSSA.and that his statutory claims must:therefore be rejected."

As an initial matter, Schulte tepleads his Sixth Amendment:fair cross-séction challenge
under the ISSA. (Schulte Br. at 19.) But given that the Duren test governs fair cross-section
‘for the.reasons stated above.. See-supra.7=17.

Apart from his. fair. cross-section challenge, Schulte ‘also contends that,the following
defects constitute substantial violations of the SSA: (1) the Government’s decision to seek'the
Indictment:from White Plains and not Manhattan; (2)'the exclusion of inactive voters from

certain counties located in the White Plains array; (3) the:allegedly erroneous proration of jurors.

'1 'To'be sure, these arguments were already rejected by the Court under the systematic exclusion
prong of the Sixth Amendment analysis. See supra 15-17. But because Schulte:pleads these
defects as separate violations of the JSSA, the Court conducts a separate analysis here.
