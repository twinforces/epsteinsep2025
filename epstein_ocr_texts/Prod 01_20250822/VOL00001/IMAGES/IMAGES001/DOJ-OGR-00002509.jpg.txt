Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 138 Filed 02/04/21 Page 6 of 26
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Ms. Maxwell brings this motion under Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(A)(ii) which requires
that motions to dismiss an indictment for pre-indictment delay be raised by pretrial motion. She
respectfully requests, however, leave to supplement this motion after the government provides
her with meaningful discovery. Depending on the status of the case after the disclosure of
meaningful discovery, Ms. Maxwell may request that the Court defer ruling on this motion until
after any trial if the indictment has not been dismissed on other grounds. See United States v.
Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 326 (1971) (“Events of trial may demonstrate actual prejudice.”); United
States v. Crouch, 84 F.3d 1497, 1516 (Sth Cir. 1996) (except for “compelling cases, the district
court, rather than grant such a motion prior to trial, should carry it with the case, and make the
determination of whether actual, substantial prejudice resulted from the improper delay in light
of what actually transpired at trial”; affirmed); United States v. Glist, 594 F.2d 1374 (10th Cir.
1979) (motions to dismiss for preindictment delay taken under advisement prior to trial and
granted as to one of four counts after five days of trial).!
