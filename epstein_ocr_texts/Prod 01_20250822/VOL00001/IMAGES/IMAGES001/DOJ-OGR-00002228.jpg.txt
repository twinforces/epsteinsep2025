document to seek to resist her extradition, bail would almost certainly be
refused for the duration of the extradition proceedings.

(b) The majority of the bars that might be relied upon by Ms Maxwell? require
the extradition judge to make a finding that extradition would be
oppressive. Quite apart from the other factors rendering those bars
unavailable to Ms Maxwell, as set out in the Opinion, it is difficult to
conceive of circumstances in which a finding of oppression could be made
in relation to the serious charges faced by Ms Maxwell in circumstances
where she had absconded from the United States and was contesting her
extradition in breach of good faith undertakings relied upon to secure her
bail. Similar considerations apply to the balancing exercise required in
assessing whether extradition would breach the right to family life under
Article 8 of the ECHR. The remaining bars to extradition and human rights
bars are unlikely to be available to Ms Maxwell for the reasons given in
the Opinion’.

(c) A breach of the undertakings in the waiver of extradition would be highly
likely to be viewed as a sign of bad faith and cause the extradition judge to
treat any evidence given by Ms Maxwell with scepticism.

4. Second, it is not correct that section 93 of the Extradition Act 2003 (‘the 2003 Act’)
confers a general discretion on the Secretary of State to refuse extradition if a case is
sent to her by the extradition judge’. The ambit of the power in section 93 is
described at paragraph 8 of the Opinion. The Secretary of State may only refuse
extradition on the grounds provided for in that section, namely: (a) if an applicable
bar to extradition® is found to exist; (b) the Secretary of State is informed that the
request has been withdrawn’; (c) there is a competing claim for extradition from

° The bars to extradition that the Secretary of State must consider are: (a) the death penalty (s. 94); (b) speciality
(s. 95); (c) earlier extradition to the United Kingdom from another territory (s. 96); and (d) earlier transfer to the
United Kingdom from the International Criminal Court (s. 96A).
