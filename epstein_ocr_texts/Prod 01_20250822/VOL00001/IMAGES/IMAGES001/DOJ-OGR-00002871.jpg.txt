no impact on several of the defendant’s motions, such as the motions to suppress (Motion 3 and
Motion 11), the motion to dismiss the perjury counts (Motion 4), and the motion to strike
allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 as surplusage (Motion 6), the Government does not
anticipate objecting to any defense request to file supplemental briefing regarding any issue that is
implicated by the S2 Indictment. The Government also notes that the S2 Indictment was returned
by a grand jury sitting in Manhattan, rendering moot the defendant’s motion to dismiss based on
the use of a grand jury sitting in White Plains (Motion 9).

Respectfully submitted,
