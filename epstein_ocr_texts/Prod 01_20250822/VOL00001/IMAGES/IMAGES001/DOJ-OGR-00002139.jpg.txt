and degrading treatments in custody (Article 3 ECHR)!”. If the Investigating Chamber
finds that the requested person would face a risk of being subject to violations of their
Article 3 rights, or that there is a risk of a “flagrant denial of justice” in the requesting
State, it must deliver a negative opinion to the extradition request.

37. In the recent years, human rights bars to an extradition request made by the United States
of America are only the subject to in-depth scrutiny by French courts when the requested
person faces the imposition of the death penalty'® or the imposition of a life

extradition is requested for purposes of enforcing a judgment, the time remaining to be
served must be at least six months.”

41. There is no doubt that the conduct referred to in the Grand Jury charges against Ms
Ghislaine Maxwell, contained in the Superseding Indictment S1 20 Cr. 330 (AJN), filed
on July 8", 2020, also constitutes criminal conduct under French law, as the crime of
“proxénétisme’’.

42. Article 225-5 of the French Criminal Code defines the crime of “proxénétisme” as “the
fact, by anyone, in any manner whatsoever: 1° To aid, assist or protect the prostitution
