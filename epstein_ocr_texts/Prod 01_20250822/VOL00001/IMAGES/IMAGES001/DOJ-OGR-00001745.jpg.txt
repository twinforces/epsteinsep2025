Maxwell the same'privileges given to other detainees.” Dkt: No. 42,at 5. In,a footnote, the
defense clarifics'that.“[a]s long as, Ms. Maxwell. is monitored in the same ‘manner, and receives
the same privileges as other pretrial detainees, it is: not:necessary to: move her to the general
population.” Dkt. No. 42 at.5'n.4.

The Court sces no basis for granting the Defendant’s request for an order. directed to
BOP. First, the Government, has assured, the Court that “[a]s with all. inmates, the defendant is

with, due process of law,” Wolfish, 441 U.S. ‘at 535, it does, not. follow that ‘surveillance measures,
aré punitive just because the Defendant deems.them. “onerous.” Dkt.. No. 42 at 4. The
Defendant has ‘provided the: Court:with no cvidence, and no. reason, to belicye, that the
surveillance measures, are motivated by. improper purposes.

As aresult, Defendant’s request is ‘denied. To ensure that Ms. Maxwell is able to
continue to adequately. participate in her defense, however, the Court hereby ORDERS the

Government to provide written status updates every 90, days detailing any material changes to the
