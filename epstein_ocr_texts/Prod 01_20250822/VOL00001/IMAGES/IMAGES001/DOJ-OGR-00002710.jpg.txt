IV. Motion For a Pretrial Evidentiary Proffer or Hearing to Determine:
Admissibility of: Co-Conspirator Declarations

Ms. Maxwell, anticipates that the government may. offer testimony regarding
statements allegedly made by unindicted co-conspirators, including statements of Jeffrey
Epstein, who is deceased. .Any. such testimony would be highly prejudicial to. Ms. Maxwell
in, the context ofthis case, especially because statements by Mr. Epstein, which would be’
testimonial in nature, are fot subject to cross-examination. Seé Crawford v. Washington,

of trial, it'1s essential, that the government demonstrate the ‘admissibility of any co-
conspirator declarations. at 4. héaring prior to trial. See United Sites v. James, 590 F.2d 575

The, Sécond, Circuit’ instructs courts to, follow the procedure enunciated in Unitéd
States'v. Geaney, 417 F.2d 111.6 (2d Cir. 1969). “Under the Geaney: rule, statements

Subject to the later submission of the necessary evidence” to establish prerequisites for
admission. United States v. Lracy:, 12 F.3d 1,186, 1.199 (2d Cir. 1993). Should.the government
‘fail to:meet its: burden of persuasion and the ‘Court finds that the conditionally adinitted -co-
conspirator statements. were not made during or in furtherance of the charged. conspiracy, any:

‘cautionary instruction would be of doubtful utility to ensure thaf all jurors would.disregard
