For these reasons, we respectfully request that the Court order the government to
immediately disclose all favorable evidence (Brady and Giglio material) within its
possession and to immediately disclose all such material upon future discovery or receipt, to
provide the defense will have ample opportunity to make use of it at trial.
IV. Motion For a Pretrial Evidentiary Proffer or Hearing to Determine

Admissibility of Co-Conspirator Declarations

Ms. Maxwell anticipates that the government may offer testimony regarding
statements allegedly made by unindicted co-conspirators, including statements of Jeffrey
Epstein, who is deceased. Any such testimony would be highly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell
in the context of this case, especially because statements by Mr. Epstein, which would be
testimonial in nature, are not subject to cross-examination. See Crawford v. Washington,
541 US. 36 (2004). To avoid serious and irreparable prejudice that would result at the time
of trial, it is essential that the government demonstrate the admissibility of any co-
conspirator declarations at a hearing prior to trial. See United States v. James, 590 F.2d 575
(5™ Cir. 1979).

The Second Circuit instructs courts to follow the procedure enunciated in United
States v. Geaney, 417 F.2d 1116 (2d Cir. 1969). “Under the Geaney rule, statements
proffered as coconspirator statements may be admitted in evidence on a conditional basis,
subject to the later submission of the necessary evidence” to establish prerequisites for
admission. United States v. Tracy, 12 F.3d 1186, 1199 (2d Cir. 1993). Should the government
fail to meet its burden of persuasion and the Court finds that the conditionally admitted co-
conspirator statements were not made during or in furtherance of the charged conspiracy, any
cautionary instruction would be of doubtful utility to ensure that all jurors would disregard
