13 made inquiry as to what happened in the first incident. When
14 there was an allegation of an attempted suicide, the court made
15 inquiry. The court obviously was interested.

16 I recall your language. You talked about that being
17 one of the several open questions indicating an interest on the

24 could assign a lawyer to help the court. I think this is an
25 area where there is intense public interest. We have complete
