2. Co-Signers, Moral Suasion, ‘and Ties to the Community

The dearth of detailed. financial information about the defendant himsclf, much. less his
brother or friend, further shows the hollowness of the: proposal. The: Court: cannot possibly
evaluate whether there would be any. incentive whatsoever for those the two’ proposed co-signers
‘to exercise moral suasion, over the defendant=or whether, as,noted above, ‘the defendant. could
casily compensate ‘them, perhaps ‘many times over, for any loss they incurred ‘through. the
‘defendant’s ‘flight from justice. The defendant. provides no information about his brother other
than.that he lives.half.the:year in the home he purportedly would pledge, and. even less information.
about, Mr. Mitchell, other than, that. he is “Mr. Epstcin’s friend,” his “close personal. friend, of
decades,” and his “close personal:friend.” Relcase’Motion at 4,9. Their willingness to “guarantee”
his: appcaranice, Release Motion at 9, is meaningless in the absérice. of such information.

Morcover, the notion that way individual co-signer could meaningfully secure a bond for
this. defendant strains credulity. Given the defendant’s wealth and his extraordinary risk of flight,
any bond ‘for this defendant; would assuredly have to be in'the hundreds of millions, of dollars. to
even be claimed to be sufficient to, guard against the risks posed. bythe defendant’s release. The
defendant. offers. no reason to believe any co-signers could meaningfully sign such.a bond, much.
less these two particular individuals, which. is yet.another reason. the: proposed package is patently

3. The Deferdant’s “Consent” to Extradition is Unenforceable and Impractical

The defendant's offer to sign a.so-called “consent” to extradition provides no additional.
reassurance whatsoever. Asan initial matter, the Government would need to find, and re-arrest.the
defendant. before such, a waiver would, even ‘come into play. Moreover, even. assuming ‘the
Government could locate and.apprchend the defendant, numerous courts have'récognizéd that such
purported waivers.areuncnforceable and cffectively micaningless because any'defendant'who signs
such a. purported waiver and then flees will assuredly contest. the validity and/or: voluntariness of
to flec). See, eg. , Uisted. States Ve “Morrison, No. 16- MR- 18, 2016 WL: 7421924, ‘at 4 (W. D: N. Y.
Dee, 23,201 6); United: States v. Kazeem, No. 15 Cr: 172, 2015 WL 4645357, at *3 (D. Or. Aug.
3, 2015); United. Sates v. Young, Nos. ‘12 Cr. $02, 12:Cr. 645, 2013 WL 12131300, at:*7 (D. Utah
Aug: .27, 2013); United’ States v. Cohen, No.-C 10-00547, 2010 WL 5387757, at *9 nL (N.D.
Cal. Dec. 20, 2010); United States v. Bohn, 330 F. Supp. 2d 960, 961 (W.D. Tenn. 2004); United
States v, Stroh, No..396 Cr. 139, 2000 WL 1832956, at, *5 (D. Conn. Nov. 3,2000); United States
v,, Botero, 604 F. Supp. 1 028, 1035 (S-D. Fla. 1985)... The: Department of Justice’s Office of
International Affairs is unaware of any country anywhere in. the world that ‘would consider an
anticipatory’ extradition, Waiver binding. And, of course, the defendant could choose 'to flee 'to a
J jurisdiction with which. the United. States does not: have an.cxtradition treaty.

Beyond being impossible to guarantee, extradition is typically a lengthy, complicated. and
expensive process, and the possibility that it would be successful neither provides any real
‘deterrent to the defendant’s incentive to flee :nor-any: measure of justice to: the victims who would
be:required to wait years for-his return. : .
