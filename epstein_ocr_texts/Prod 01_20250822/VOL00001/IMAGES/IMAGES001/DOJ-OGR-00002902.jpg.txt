takes place in a day room that is separate from the defendant’s isolation cell. Accordingly, the
defendant is permitted out of her cell from 7am to 8pm every day. While in the day room, the
defendant has exclusive access to the MDC desktop computer, the laptop, a television, a phone on
which to place social or attorney calls, and a shower. The defendant is also permitted outdoor
recreation every day, although she has the option of declining such recreation time if she wishes.

The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to
communicate with her attorneys. Currently, the defendant receives five hours of video-
teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel every weekday, for a total of 25 hours of attorney
VTC calls per week. At times, unexpected incidents, such as institution-wide lockdowns or short
staffing, delay the defendant’s arrival to her VTC call with counsel by up to 30 minutes. When
such delay occurs, however, the MDC permits the defendant to make up for any missed time either
by extending that day’s VTC call or by permitting the defendant extra time on the next day’s VTC
call. All of these VTC calls take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC
staff can hear her communications with counsel. During these VTC calls, MDC staff place a
camera approximately 30 feet away from the door to the room where the defendant conducts the
VTC calls. The camera has a full view of the door to the VTC room, but the camera cannot view
either the defendant or her attorneys while the door is closed during VTC calls. The camera does
not capture any sound from the defendant’s VTC calls with her attorneys. In other words, the
camera records who enters and exits the VTC room, but it does not record activity inside the VTC
room. The defendant is also permitted to use the phone in the day room to place phone calls to her
attorneys as needed.

In addition, defense counsel now have the option of meeting with the defendant in person
at the MDC. On or about February 16, 2021, the MDC resumed in-person visitation. As a result,
