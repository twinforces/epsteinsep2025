‘Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 75 Filed 11/24/20 Page 2 of 2
LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C: STERNHEIAA

The government highlights ‘what Ms. Maxwell is;permitted but not what she is. denied:
‘equal treatment accorded other inmates ‘in. general: population. Ms..Maxwell has spent the
entirely of her pretrial detention. 1 in de: facto. solitary: confinement under the most:restrictive
conditions where’ she is excessively and ‘invasively: scarched and. is monitored. 24 hours per-day.
In addition to camera surveillance in her cell, a:‘supplemental camera follows her movement:
‘when she 1s permitted, to, leave her isolation cell and.is focused on Ms. Maxwell and, counsel
during 1 ‘in-person legal visits. And :despite:non-stop in-cell.camera surveillance, Ms. Maxwell’s
sleepris disrupted every 15-minutes when.she is awakened. ‘by:a flashlight to ascertain whether
she is breathing.

Ms. Maxwell is.a non-violent, exemplary pretrial. detainee with no criminal. history; no
history of violence, no history of mental health issues. of suicidal. ideation. She is overmanaged
under conditions more restrictive:than inmates housed in..L0South, the most: restrictive unit:in the
MCC; or individuals convicted. of terrorism, and capital:murder and incarcerated at FC] Florenee:
ADMAX, the most restrictive facility operated by‘the BOP. The MDC concedes that itis unable
to place her in gencral ‘population, for her safety and the sccurity of the institution, but fails to
explain why she is deprived of.all other opportunities provided to general population inmates.

Stating that'Ms. Maxwell “continues to have more time to: review her discovery than any
other inmate at. the MDC, even while in quarantine” gives the unfair impression that she is being
given a perquisite. However, given the voluminous discovery in this case, the most recent:
production alone being: 1.2: million documents, the time: accorded. Ms. Maxwell. remains
‘inadequate for her to review and prepare the defense of her life.

Duc fo the failure of MDC’s. Warden and:Legal Department.to respond to recurring
problems and, complaints, counscl have reached out to the government. While we appreciate, any:
assistance provided by government counsel, it has done little to 'redress the: many concerns
regarding the disparate treatment of Ms. Maxwell.

Rather than, receive second-hand information, from counsel, the: defense requests that the
‘Court summon Warden, Heriberto Tellez to report directly to the Court and counsel on Ms.
‘Maxwell’s conditions of detention.

Your consideration is greatly appreciated.

Very truly yours,

Babli CG. Starnheim.
