Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document97 Filed 12/14/20: Page 31 of 45

Indeed, the discovery. reflects that it was not hard at all. for the government'to locate Ms.
Maxwell'when they wanted to find her by tracking her primary. phone.

In sum, the. cellphone clearly shows that. Ms. Maxwell. was-not “good at” hiding: or
that: she was avoiding arrest, as the government claimed. (Tr. 31-32). She was trying to
protect herself as best as she could from harassmenit by the press, not capture by law
enforcement. Moreover, this should not be a:bar to granting bail. The proposed conditions
ensure her presence at home in plain. sight. off | (and the security guards), GPS=
moiiitored, and-uider. strict Pretrial. supervision.

D. Ms. Maxwell Has Waived Her Extradition Rights and Could, Not Seek
Refuge in the United Kingdom or France

At the initial hearing, the government argued that. Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen
who has lived. in the United States for almost 30 years, might flee to the United. Kingdom. or
France if granted bail, despite the ‘fact that she did not leave the country for-nearly a ‘year after:
Epstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not
extradite its citizens to the United States pursuant-to French, law.” (/d:) At the bail hearing, the
government'represented that “France will.not extradite a French. citizen to'the United ‘States, as a.
matter of law, even if the defendant is a.dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by
the United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the
extiadition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions ate incorrect, particularly given Ms:
Maxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her, extradition, rights with respect to both, the United Kingdom
and France.,

As we noted forthe Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would
attempt:to flee the United, States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive

and, opportunity'to flée after the arrest.and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chosé to remainiin this
