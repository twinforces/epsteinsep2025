Indeed, the discovery reflects that it was not hard at all for the government to locate Ms.
Maxwell when they wanted to find her by tracking her primary phone.

In sum, the cellphone clearly shows that Ms. Maxwell was not “good at” hiding or
that she was avoiding arrest, as the government claimed. (Tr. 31-32). She was trying to
protect herself as best as she could from harassment by the press, not capture by law
enforcement. Moreover, this should not be a bar to granting bail. The proposed conditions
ensure her presence at home in plain sight of f | (and the security guards), GPS-
monitored, and under strict Pretrial supervision.

Refuge in the United Kingdom or France

At the initial hearing, the government argued that Ms. Maxwell, a naturalized U.S. citizen
who has lived in the United States for almost 30 years, might flee to the United Kingdom or
France if granted bail, despite the fact that she did not leave the country for nearly a year after
Epstein’s arrest. (Dkt. 22 at 6.) The government asserted in its reply brief that France “does not
extradite its citizens to the United States pursuant to French law.” (/d.) At the bail hearing, the
government represented that “France will not extradite a French citizen to the United States as a
matter of law, even if the defendant is a dual citizen of the United States,” and that extradition by
the United Kingdom would be “lengthy” and “uncertain” with bail “very likely” pending the
extradition proceeding. (Tr. 27.) These assertions are incorrect, particularly given Ms.
Maxwell’s irrevocable waiver of her extradition rights with respect to both the United Kingdom
and France.

As we noted for the Court at the initial hearing, the concern that Ms. Maxwell would
attempt to flee the United States is entirely unfounded given that Ms. Maxwell had every motive
and opportunity to flee after the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein, but chose to remain in this
