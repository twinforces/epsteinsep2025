conduct that allegedly took place more than two decades ago—accusations so vague that they do
not even link Ms. Maxwell to the only specific allegation of travel by Accuser-1 in the
indictment (see Indictment JJ 11b, 17b).

To try to bolster its case, the government alleges that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in
Epstein’s alleged “sexual abuse” of two other individuals, Accuser-2 and Accuser-3, and has
included allegations regarding Ms. Maxwell’s interactions with these two individuals in the
indictment. But the allegations as to Accuser-3 cannot possibly support the charges against Ms.
Maxwell: Although the gravamen of a § 2422(a) or § 2423(a) offense is enticing or causing an

Maxwell (or Epstein, for that matter) enticed her to do so or transported her. Moreover, although
both § 2422(a) and § 2423(a) require an intent that the traveling individual engage in unlawful
sexual activity, the indictment alleges no facts suggesting that Epstein’s alleged sexual activity
with Accuser-3, who was over the legal age of consent in England at all relevant times, was

Maxwell that will prejudice the jury against her.

To enable the presentation of evidence regarding Accuser-3, the government claims the
alleged “sexual abuse” of Accuser-3 is somehow an “overt act” in furtherance of conspiracies to
cause unspecified individuals to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity.
The government’s inclusion of these allegations, however, is nothing more than an attempted
end-run around its obligations under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). The “overt act” alleged as to
Accuser-3 has nothing to do with the alleged conspiracy. Moreover, the allegations regarding
Accuser-3 are unduly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the
allegations regarding Accuser-3 be stricken as surplusage, or in the alternative, that the
