‘prosecution.

The ongoing review of discovery confirms the lack of evidence in support of the
stale allegations in, the indictment. Further, the: government’s concessions reveal that it
‘failed. to:properly investigate the allegations of.at least one of its three core witnesses. The
passage.of time:continues to reveal. information. and. lack ‘of evidence that undermine the
‘purported strength of the government’s case.

Bail Must Be Granted.

The detention of Ms. Maxwell. on 25-year-old allegations — based on the lowest grade
misdemeanor under New York Penal Law 130.55° — preserited in a sensationalized
indictment containing pictures to inflame the public and entice and feed the media frenzy’ —
‘4s unwarranted. in ‘the face: of the unique bail package before the Court. Relentless ‘media
coverage of Ms. Maxwell, which preceded and impacted the bringing of this prosecution,
has. increased significantly. since: her arrest and detention. Ms. Maxwell’s continued.
detention — providing daily fodder for media for the past nine months—continucs to. severely’
undermine her presumption of innocence.

In the face of this enhanced bail ‘package, the government’s. claim, that Ms. Maxwell
poses “an extreme risk.of flight” rings hollow. The government urges the: Court to apply a.
standard that; defies the law - an. absolute guarantee against all ‘risks. See’ United, States v.
Orta, 760, F.2d 887, 888 .n.4 (8th Cir. 1985) ("Thelegal'standard required by. the [Bail

Reform].Actis one of reasonable assurances, notabsolute:guarantees."). Under'the Bail

T What other, purpose could'be served by. the inclusion, of arpicture of Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey [:pstein-taken, over, a:
