Re: United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB)

Dear Judge Berman:

The Government respectfully submits this letter to briefly respond to one aspect of the
defendant’s July 16, 2019 letter (ECF No. 24), and to provide the Court with additional information
regarding the defendant’s foreign passport. The defendant’s July 16, 2019 letter asserts: “[A]s for
the Austrian passport the government trumpets, it expired 32 years ago. And the government offers
nothing to suggest—and certainly no evidence—that Epstein ever used it.” (ECF No. 24 at 7). In
fact, the passport contains numerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use
of the passport to enter France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s.

The Government further notes that the defendant’s submission does not address how the
defendant obtained the foreign passport and, more concerning, the defendant has still not disclosed
to the Court whether he is a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United
States.

Respectfully submitted,
GEOFFREY S. BERMAN
United States Attorney
