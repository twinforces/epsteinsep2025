District courts havethe inherent authority to compel:pretrial disclosure of the identities. of
‘government. witnesses. See. United. States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d. 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975). Such.
‘disclosure iswarranted when there is a specific: showing that the disclosure: is material to the
preparation of the defense and.reasonable in, light. of the circumstances surrounding ‘the’ case. See’
at. 302; United States, v..Rueh, No. 00 GR. 91 (RWS), 2001 WL.96177, at.*9 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.

5, 2001). (ordering: disclosure of government ‘witness. list ‘where defendant “ha[d] meét his burden
10 show a particularized need that ‘wees the possibe angers of disclosure") This

warrant the disclosure of their identities. See United Siaies Vv. War ‘me, No. ‘OOCRIOA. 2009 WL
4271 1.1, at.*2 (W.D.N-Y. Feb. 20, 2009) (ordering government to, disclose identity of sex crime
victim. where “defendant’s ability to adequately: prepare a defense against. this charge: is
significantly compromised without: bemg advised of the identity of the alleged v victim” »: see also

facts surrounding the crime : charged.’ sy

The defense’s narrowly-tailored request, which orily sééks' the disclosure of the identity
of Victims 1-3, and not the government’s entire witness list, is also reasonable in light of the:
circumstances of this case. And because the protective order, prohibits Ms., Maxwell, defense
counsel, and. others. on, the: defense team, from disclosing or ‘disseminating the identity of any
alleged victim, or potential, witness referenced in. the discovery. materials (Dkt. 36 { 5), ‘the
disclosuré will have no impact’ on-the privacy interésts, of Victims 1-3. Nor is:theré, any’basis for
the government ‘to claim. that there is a risk that witnesses will. face: intimidation. or refuse to
testify:” To. the contrary, many alleged. victims have already: chosen. to speak on. the record. in.
criminal, proceedings. in the Epstein caseand. in, this case; to file civil suits against Mr. Epstein,
Ms. ‘Maxwell ‘and. others, ‘and to provide deposition. | testimony and, discovery-in those: suits; and to
give interviews. ‘to 'the press, and other television and. film productions. Moreover! Victiins 1-3
aré no longer minors, but are now: adults :in their, late 308 or-early 40s, ‘which:provides. additional.
assurance that: they. willbe willing to appear for trial. Disclosure is therefore warranted ‘here.

* Th, determining ‘whether. to, order pretriail disclosure of the identity ‘of witnesses, some district courts have
considered the following, factors: a) Did, the offense alleged ‘in. the indictment : ‘involve: a crime of violenec? (2)
Have: the defendants ‘been arrested, or convicted for crimes involving violence? (3) Will the evidenec in. the: case
largely consist.of testimony relating to, documents (which by their nature are not easily: altered)? (4) Is. there a
realistic possibility that supplying: the ‘witnesses? ‘names prior to: trial will increase the ‘likelihood that the
prosecution* s'witnesses will. not: ‘appear at trial, or will be unwilling: to. testify: at trial? (5) Does the indictment; allege
offenses occurring over an extended ‘period, of time, making ‘preparation of the defendants’ defense. complex iand,
difficult? (6): Do, the defendants have ‘limited funds with which to ‘investigate and prepare their defense? ‘Ruch,
2001, WL296177, at #78 (citation oinitted). The Secoiid Circuit, however, has not adopted ‘these factors, for'do they
constitute ati,cxhaustive list of factors thit the Court: “may: Consider in. deterinining- whicther to disclose the, identities
Of alleged victiiis.

3 ‘Notably, the: government did not: argue. at. the. bail. hearing. that Ms. Maxwell posed a danger to the community.
