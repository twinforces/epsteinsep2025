acts are so serious that both crimes carry a statutory presumption ‘that no condition or combination
of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as‘required. 18 U.S.C. § 3142
(e)(3)(E). The défendant repeatedly engaged in this conduct, targeting girls as young as 14 years
old, for a period of years, and involving multiple minors.

These offenses carry significant penalties, and the defendant faces up to 35 years’
imprisonment if convicted. The possibility of a substantial sentence is a significant factor in
assessing the risk of flight. See United States v.. Moscaritolo, No. 10'Cr: 4 (JL), 2010 WL 309679,
at *2 (D:N.H. Jan. 26, 2010) (‘T]he steeper the potential sentence, the more probable the flight
risk is, especially considering the strong case.of the government... . .”):(quoting United States v.
Alindato—Perez, 627 F. Supp. 2d'58, 66(D.P.R. 2009)). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory
maximum of decades in prison. This fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone
to flee from prosecution, but the incentive to flee is especially strong for this defendant, who, -at
age.58, faces the very real prospect of spending a substantial portion of the rest of her life in prison.

The strength of the evidence in this case underscores the risk that the defendant will become
a fugitive. As the facts set forth in the Indictment make plain, the evidence in this:case is strong.
Multiple victims have provided detailed, credible, and corroborated information against the.
defendant. The victims are backed up contemporaneous documents, records, witness. testimony,
and other evidence. For example, flight records, diary entries, business records, and other evidence
corroborate the victims’ account.of events. This will-be compelling evidence of guilt at any trial
im this case, which weighs heavily in favor.of detention.

The passage of time between the defendant’s conduct and these charges does not counsel
otherwise. As an initial.matter, all of the conduct:is timely charged, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3283,

which was-amended in 2003 to extend the limitations period for conduct that was timely as of the
