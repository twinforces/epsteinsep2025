Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 32 Filed 07/18/19 Page 19 of 33
(“Jeffrey Epstein never once checked in with City cops in eight-plus years since a Manhattan :
judge ordered him to do so every 90 days”).
Mr. Epstein is a Level II sex offender in New York State which is the highest category
of risk to reoffend. This designation requires that Mr. Epstein report his presence in New York to |
law enforcement authorities every 90 days. As discussed at the July 15, 2019 bail hearing, .
counsel for Mr. Epstein made an application in New York State Supreme Court in 2011 to |
reduce Epstein’s sex offender registration status from Level III to Level I. If granted, this
reduction would have allowed Mr. Epstein to avoid his reporting obligations. In a Sex Offender |
Registration Act Hearing on January 11, 2018, held before the Honorable Ruth Pickholz, Mr. |
Epstein’s application was (firmly) denied, principally because it had been established by the |
Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders. See People v. Epstein, Indict. # 30129/2010, (N.Y. Sup. |
Ct.), SORA Hearing Transcript, dated Jan. 18, 2011. |
At the hearing, New York County Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Gaffney joined in |
Defense Counsel’s appeal to review and overturn the decision of the Board of Examiners of Sex
Offenders and achieve a downward modification of Mr. Epstein’s sex offender status. Id. at 2-15.
Judge Pickholz appeared to be stunned by the joint Defense Counsel/District Attorney
application, stating: “I am just a little overwhelmed that the People are making this application. .
.. | have done many SORAs much less troubling than this one where the People would never
make a downward [adjustment] argument like this. . . . | have never seen the prosecutor’s office |
do this. I have to tell you, I am shocked.” Id. at 4-5. Judge Pickholz also ordered Mr. Epstein to
report as a Level III sex offender every 90 days in New York. Id. at 12. “I am sorry [Mr. Epstein]
may have to come here every 90 days. He can give up his New York home [on East 71st. St.] if
he does not want to come every 90 days.” Id. Epstein appealed but Judge Pickholz’s decision
