The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant’s motions are
“relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,” thereby
qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United
States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo I’), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995). And the Court also finds that
the common law presumption of access attaches. /d. at 146; see also Nixon v. Warner
Commce’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978). Nevertheless, the proposed redactions are narrowly
tailored to serve substantial interests. Most notably, these redactions are narrowly tailored to
protect the Government’s ongoing investigation. In addition, many of the Defendant’s proposed
redactions crucially serve the interest of protecting the personal privacy interests of third parties.
See Under Seal v. Under Seal, 273 F. Supp. 3d 460, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2017).

The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted documents and
corresponding exhibits by no later than February 5, 2021. With respect to Motion 3, the
Defendant is ORDERED to docket the version that includes the Government’s proposed
redactions in addition to her own.
