1. From about 1994 to 2004, petitioner “coordinated,
facilitated, and contributed to” the multimillionaire fi-
nancier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of numerous
young women and underage girls. Pet. App. 4a. The
abuse followed a pattern. Petitioner and Epstein would
identify vulnerable girls living under difficult cireum-
stances; isolate them from their friends and families,
gaining their trust by giving them gifts and pretending
to be their friends; normalize the discussion of sexual
topics and sexual touching with the girls; and then
“transition[] to sexual abuse, often through the pretext
of [a girl] giving Epstein a massage.” Gov’t C.A. Br. 5;
see Pet. App. 4a, 94a. Petitioner and Epstein paid vic-
tims large amounts of cash to provide Epstein with sex-
ualized massages, and after a victim had begun giving
massages, they would offer her additional money to re-
eruit other girls. Gov’t C.A. Br. 5-6.

Petitioner and Epstein carried on those activities at,
among other locations, Epstein’s residences in Palm
Beach, Florida, and New York City. See Gov’t C.A. Br.
