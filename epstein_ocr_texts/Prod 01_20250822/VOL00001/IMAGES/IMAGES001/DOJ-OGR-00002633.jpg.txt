‘Secretary of Labor. Ina brief oral statement, Acosta explained that continued media attention, on
his: handling of the Epstein, investigation rather than on the economy: was unfair ‘to the Labor
Department.

On August 1 0,.20 19, Epstein was found hanging in his cell and was later. pronounced dead.
The New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded that Epstein had committed-suicide.

As a result of Epstein’s ‘death, the U.S. Attorney’s Office: for the: Southern District of
New: York filed a nolle proséqui to. dismiss the pending indictment: against Epstein. On.
August 27, 2019, the district court held a hearing at which niore. than.'a dozen: of Epstein’ 8.
victims—including victims of the conduct in Florida:thatwas. addressed through the NPA—spoke
about the impact of Epstein’s crimes. ‘The court dismissed the Epstein indictment on
August 29, 2019.

After Epstein’s death, the federal district court in Florida overseeing the CVRA litigation
denied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as' moot. Among its: findings,
the court concluded that although. the government had ‘violated the CVRA, the government; had
asserted“‘legitimate and legally supportable positions throughout‘this litigation,” and.therefore had.
not litigated. in bad. faith. The court also: noted it expected ‘the government to “horior its
representation that it. will provide training; to ‘its employees about the CVRA. and the proper
treatment. of crime victims,” “as well as honoring its’ ‘promise to.meet:with the victims.

for a writ of mandamus in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleverith. Circuit, seeking:
review of the. district court’ s order denying. all-of her: requested remedies. In.its responsive brief,
the government argued that.“as‘a matter of law, the legal obligations under the CVRA do not.attach
prior to the-government charging a.casé” and thus, “the CVRA was not’ ‘triggered i in [the Southern
District of Florida] because no criminal, charges were brought:” ‘Nevertheless, during oral.
argument, the government conceded that the USAO had not been “fully. transparent” with ‘the
petitioner and had “made a mistake. in causing her to believe that the case was ongoing when in,
fact the NPA. had been-signed.” On.April 14, 2020, a divided panel of the:Court of Appeals:denied.
the petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not: attach until a defendant has been criminally charged.
On, August 7, 2020, the.court granted the petition. for rehearing en .banc and vacated the panel” S
opinion; as of the date of this Report, a, briefing:schedule has been issued, and oral.argument is set:
for December'3; 2020.
