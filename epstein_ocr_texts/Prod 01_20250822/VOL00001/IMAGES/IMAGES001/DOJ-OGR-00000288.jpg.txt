IV. Sixth Amendment

Finally, ifia case such as'this one, which will likely. involve:voluminous discovery and ‘is
predicated on.cvents allegedly. occurring 14 or more years ago, it is critical-to counscl’s ability to
provide effective assistance,.as well.as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully contribute to his
defense, that Mr. Epstein. be permitted pretrial release. The Sixth Amendment.“does not provide
merely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the: accused personally the right
to make his defense. It is the:aceused, not counsel, who must be “informed of the nature and
cause of the accusation,’ and who must be ‘confronted with the witnesses against him,’ and who
must be accorded. “compulsory: proccss for obtaining witnesscs in his favor.” /arettay:
California, 422 U:S. 806, 819 ( 1975). Given:the unique circumstances of this: case, Mr.
Epstein’s exercise of these important Constitutional rights would be materially: ‘impaired by his
pretrial. detention.

Vv. Conclusion

Wherefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Epstein, respectfully submits that his conduct
over the past: 14° years proves that. he poses no risk of flight or threat:to the safety’ of the
community. Even ifthe Court should have concerns to, the contrary, there clearly exist ‘a
combination of conditions that would be sufficient to assure. his presence as. required and/or the
safety of the: community, including but not.limited to some or all.of the conditions proposed.
supra, or any other conditions the Court deems:necessary.and appropriate.

Yours truly;
