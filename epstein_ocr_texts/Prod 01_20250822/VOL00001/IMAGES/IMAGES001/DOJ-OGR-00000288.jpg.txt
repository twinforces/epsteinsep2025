Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document6 Filed 07/11/19 Page 15 of 16
IV. Sixth Amendment
Finally, in a case such as this one, which will likely involve voluminous discovery and is
predicated on events allegedly occurring 14 or more years ago, it is critical to counsel’s ability to
provide effective assistance, as well as the defendant’s ability to meaningfully contribute to his
defense, that Mr. Epstein be permitted pretrial release. The Sixth Amendment “does not provide
merely that a defense shall be made for the accused; it grants to the accused personally the right
to make his defense. It is the accused, not counsel, who must be ‘informed of the nature and
cause of the accusation,’ and who must be ‘confronted with the witnesses against him,’ and who
must be accorded ‘compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor.’” Faretta v.
California, 422 U.S. 806, 819 (1975). Given the unique circumstances of this case, Mr.
Epstein’s exercise of these important Constitutional rights would be materially impaired by his
pretrial detention.
V. Conclusion
Wherefore, for all of the foregoing reasons, Mr. Epstein respectfully submits that his conduct
over the past 14 years proves that he poses no risk of flight or threat to the safety of the
community. Even if the Court should have concerns to the contrary, there clearly exist a
combination of conditions that would be sufficient to assure his presence as required and/or the
safety of the community, including but not limited to some or all of the conditions proposed
supra, or any other conditions the Court deems necessary and appropriate.
