ARGUMENT

The Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot overcome the statutory

presumption in favor of detention in this case for the following reasons, among others:
I. Victims Seek Detention

Pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), a crime victim has the right to be
reasonably heard at certain public proceedings in the district court, including proceedings
involving release. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4). Consistent with that requirement, the Government has
been in contact with victims and counsel identified through this investigation in connection with
the argument regarding bail.

Multiple victims and/or their counsel have asked the Government to seek detention (and to
inform the Court of their views in that respect) for multiple reasons. First, they believe that the
defendant’s continued detention is necessary under the CVRA’s right to be reasonably protected
from the accused. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(1). They have specifically conveyed to the Government
that they would be fearful for their safety ifthe defendant were released. For the reasons articulated
herein, the Government believes those concerns to be well-founded.

Additionally, certain victims have asked the Government to advise the Court that they are
specifically concerned about the defendant’s proposal to be released even if under conditions that
included home detention and full-time private guards. They believe it would be unfair to victims
of a wealthy defendant, like Epstein, if he were to be given greater freedoms than others would be
in similar circumstances, and that such an arrangement would be inconsistent with their rights.
They specifically asked the Government to advise the Court that they believed such an arrangement
could result in harassment and abuse by the defendant. ?

Il. The Defendant’s Proposal Does Nothing to Mitigate His Flight Risk

Each of the relevant factors to be considered as to flight risk—the nature and circumstances
of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant—
counsel strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do nothing
whatsoever to mitigate those risks.

A. Defendant Proposes No Infringement Upon His Ability to Use his Vast Wealth to Flee

It might not be immediately apparent to a reader of the Release Motion that the defendant
is extravagantly wealthy and worth, according to records relating to the defendant recently
obtained by the Government from a financial institution (“Institution-1”), more than $500 million.
> The Government is aware of at least one additional attorney for a victim who has publicly stated
that her client supports the pretrial detention of the defendant. The Government is unaware of any
victim who has expressed support for the defendant being granted pretrial release on bail.
