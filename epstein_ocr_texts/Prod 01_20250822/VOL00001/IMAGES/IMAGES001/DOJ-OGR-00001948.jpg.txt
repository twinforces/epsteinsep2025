And the notion that. anyone could mead the indictment.

that Has béen reéturnéd in this ecasé and néw reach thé

conclusion, that an, adult woman, cultivating the traffic of
underage girls, knowing that they will be sexually abused and
exploirted by an adult man, and conclude that, that. is chilling

Turning to the facts we have proffered, to the count
about. the deféndant's finances, and particularly about the
defendant's conduct in, hiding, jit appears, youn Honor, that it
1s undisputed that the defendant was living in. hiding and took.
those, actions. There cannot be any spin or characterization of
