provision as to Epstein. See, e.g., LaSalle Bank Nat’l Ass’n v. Nomura Asset Capital Corp., 424
F.3d 195, 206 (2d Cir. 2005) (“In interpreting a contract under New York law, ‘words and
phrases ... should be given their plain meaning,’ and the contract ‘should be construed so as to
give full meaning and effect to all of its provisions.’”) (citations omitted); Port Consol., Inc. v.
Int’l Ins. Co. of Hannover, PLC, 826 F. App’x 822, 827 (11th Cir. 2020) (same under Florida
law). The Justice Manual supports this view, admonishing prosecutors who do not wish to bind
USAOs in other districts to “explicitly limit the scope” of the NPA to their districts. Justice
Manual, Comment to § 9-27.630 (emphasis added). The absence of the phrase “in this District”
from the co-conspirator immunity provision therefore compels the opposite inference: that the
parties did not intend to limit the co-conspirator immunity provision to the SDFL.

Moreover, “a promise to bind other districts can be inferred from the negotiations
between defendant and prosecutor.” Russo, 801 F.2d at 626. One relevant factor in this analysis
is the extent to which the USAO negotiating the plea agreement acted on its own, as opposed to
involving other USAOs or other offices within the Department of Justice. Cf, e.g., United States
v. D’Amico, 734 F. Supp. 2d 321, 349 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (finding that defendant “offers no
meaningful support for his claim that he ‘reasonably understood’ the Agreement to bar
subsequent prosecutions in this District... . He does not claim, for example, that the SDNY
USAO was in any way consulted or involved in the plea negotiations.”); United States v.
Laskow, 688 F. Supp. 851, 854 (E.D.N.Y.) (“defendants concede [] that the Central District had
no knowledge of the investigation that was taking place in the Eastern District at the time the
Central District plea was being negotiated. .. . The Central District, unaware of defendants’
potential criminal liability in the Eastern District, could not have intended to insulate defendants
from prosecution which they had no reason to foresee.”), aff'd, 867 F.2d 1425 (2d Cir. 1988).
