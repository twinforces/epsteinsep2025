A. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in Particular ‘Case

Grand jury secrecy may scrve:legitimate purposes in ordinary cases, but this:is no ordinary’
case. In addition to the public interest thatthe Government identifies, Epstein Dkt. No. 66 at 4-5,
disclosure of the grand jury transcripts in this case serves the interest of Epstcin’s and Maxwell’s
victims ‘in. bringing’ light: to Epstcin’s and Maxwell’s horrific: crimes. This transparcney: and
accountability is a form. of justice. Epstein. is ‘the, world’s most notorious séx offérider, and his
crimes span decades, with.thousands of:victims. :Epstcin-was a calculated. predator who preyed. on.
‘minors and.young women using'wealth, deceit, and manipulation. Maxwell, his righthand woman,
played. a, central ‘role ‘in ‘recruiting, grooming; and. trafficking Epstcin’s victims, oftentimes

enabled Epstein. to conduct a.decades-long sex-trafficking scheme:

Given the: magnitude and .abhorrence:of Epstein arid. Maxwells crimes, unsealing the grand,
jury transcripts is not just appropriate, it is necessary to understand the ‘full-scope of the abuse and
those who enabled it. For years, 'victims of Epstcin’s and. Maxwell’s crimes have been, silenced,
fearful ofthe:repercussions of'exposing the many powerful individuals in Epstein’s network, many
of whom. have: not: yet been named or investigated. Unséaling: the grand, jury transcripts would,
allow additional important information to cmerge ‘without requiring the ‘victims: to expose:

to expose such information. The Government; itself ‘acknowledged that there are “over one
thousand ‘victims,’ * ‘yet only a small fraction—approximately .onc-fifth—have. received
‘compensation, underscoring the continuing lack of full accountability: for Epstein, Maxwell, and.
their co-conspirators. The intcrests of the victims should.therefore weigh, in favor of disclosure.
Sée Matter of Aiani v. Donovan, 98 A.D.3d972, 974. (2d Dep’t 2012) (ordering disclosure: of
banking récords requested in. connection'with grand jury proceedings based on the interests, of the
victims).

B. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Transcripts Who, Might Be Affected. by
Disclosure.Are Still Alive

This factor considers whether individuals ‘who may be affected.by the disclosure: of' grand
jury materials may be adversely impacted by unscaling. This case’presents.a rare ‘and compelling’
circumstance where the victinis seck transparency, :not secrecy. In /are National Security Archive,
for. example, where'the: proceedings held.substantial-historical importance. and the living witnesses
did not express'any objection, to the release, the Court:found.that the release of grand jury’testimony’
was. appropriate. 2008 WL. 8985358, at *1—2.(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2008). The victims represented,
