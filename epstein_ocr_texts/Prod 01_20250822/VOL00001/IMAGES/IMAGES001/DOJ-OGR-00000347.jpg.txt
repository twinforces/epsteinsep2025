A. The-Defendant: Poses.an Extreme Flight Risk

Each of the relevant factors to be:considered as to:flight:risk —the:nature:and. circumstances
of the offense, the:strength of the evidence, and, the history and. characteristics of the defendant —
counsel strongly in favor of detention,

‘lL. The Nature and Circumstances of the Offense and the Strength of the Evidence

The “nature and circumstances” ‘of this offense plainly favor detention. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3142(g)(1) (specifically enumerating “whether the offense... . involves a.minor ‘victim” as a.
factor‘in bail applications). Indeed, the crime of sex trafficking of a minor is so scrious that ‘fora.
defendant, charged with that offense, there is a préstmiption that no condition or combination of
conditions'will reasonably: assure'the appearance of the defendant as:required and the safety of the
community. 18 US.C 8 3142 (c)(3)(E). Here, as specified i in the Indictment, the defendant’s
conduct:was committed scrially, over‘a‘period of ycars, and affected. dozens of victims.

The seriousness of the charge is also, reflected. in the: penalti¢s the defendant faces, which
‘include upto 45 years of:incarceration:for Counts One and’Two ofthe Indictment.* As:the Second
Circuit has noted, the possibility of a:severe sentence is a significant factor in assessing the risk of
flight. See Jackson, 823 F 2d at 73 see also United States. v. GO isner Os, 328 F.3d G10, 618 (10th Cir.
‘gave ¢ her z a 1 strong incentive to abscond); “United States. y, Tom send, 897 F.2d 989. 995 (oth Cir. 1990)
¢ ‘Facing the much graver ‘penalties possible under the present indictment, the defendants have. an. even.
greater incentive to consider flight.” *). Here, the defendant is facing a statutory:maximum of decades
in-prison. Even in.the absence of means—which, as discussed. in. detail below, the defendant. has
in abundance—this fact alone would provide a compelling incentive for anyone to fail to appear.
tis particularly compelling fora defendant who.is:66 years old, and,therefore faces the very real,
prospect of spending the rest:of his life in'prison if convicted.

The likelihood ofa substantial period of. incarceration. is buttressed by the strength: of the
that the defendant sexually abused ‘dozens ‘of-n ‘minor. ‘victims, “and the conspiracy count. ‘lists
numerous overt. acts committed:in furtherance of the defendant’s crimes."

> The current:penaltics for violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 include.a.10: year mandatory. minimum.
sentence. However, that Posen was created aah an, amendment to the statute in 2006.

therefore relevant here, was a:maximum. of 40 years” imprisonment.

+ With, respect tothe evidence in this case, the Court-should start its analysis by accepting that the
Indictment. 1s, sufficient, on. its own, to establish. probable cause that the defendant committed the
érinics of scx trafficking and, scx’ traffickitig conspiracy: Contrérds, 776 F.2d at 54. (“Were:an
evidentiary hearing addressing the existence of probable cause: required i in every: §:3142(c) case in.
which an indictment had been filed, the court would. spend scarce judicial ‘resources considering
that which a. grand. j jury had. already determined, and have less time to focus on, the application of
