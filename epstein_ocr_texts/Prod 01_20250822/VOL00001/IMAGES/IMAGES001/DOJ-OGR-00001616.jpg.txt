evidence and witness testimony, will conclusively. establish.that the defendant groomed the victims
for sexual. abuse by Jeffrey Epstein.!

The defendant’s:motion.alludes to defenses. in this case, allof which.are legal or procedural.
in, nature, and, none of which ‘pass muster, Ict-alone counscl.in, favor of bail. To begin, with, the
notion. that ‘the. defendant. is proteeted from “prosecution. by: the Non-Prosecution. Agreement.
(“NPA”) between Jeffrey'Epstcin.and the U:S..Attorney’s Office in the Southern’District of Florida.
(“SDEL”) is absurd. That. agreement: affords her no protection in, this District, for at:Icast three
reasons. First, the defendant was not a party to that agreement nor named in it asa. third-party:
beneficiary, and the defendant offers no basis to think she would have standing to claim.any rights
under the NPA. Tellingly, the defendant cites no authority forthe proposition that an agreement.
she was not.a ‘party to and that. does not: even identify her by name: could. possibly be invoked. to
bar her prosecution. Sccond, and cqually important, the NPA docs not bind the Southern District:
of New York, which was not.a:party to the agreement. See Uirited States v. Anriabi, 771. F.2d 670,
672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (““A, plea, agreement ‘binds only the office of the United States
Attorney for the district in which the plea, is entered.‘unless, it affirmatively. appcars that the
agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”)); Wnited. States v..Prisco, 391. F. App’x.920, 9211.
(2d Cir. 2010). ‘This rule applies even when. the text.of the agreement refers to the’ signing party’
as the “Government.” Annabi, 771 F.2d, at.672.

Third, and. perhaps most :important, even. assuming the NRA. could, be read to protect this

defendant. and bind this, Office, which ‘are ‘both legally unsound propositions, the Indictment.

. Additionally, and. beyond the strong evidence set forth in the Indictment, in just. the past week,
and ‘in response. to. the charges. against the defendant being made public, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. (“FBI”) and the US. Attorney’s Office: have been. in touch with additional.
individuals who have-expressed.a:willingness to provide information. regarding. the defendant. The
Government is in. the process of receiving and, reviewing this additional evidence, which has ‘the:
potential to, make the Government’s case even stronger:
