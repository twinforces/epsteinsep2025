evidence and witness testimony, will conclusively establish that the defendant groomed the victims
for sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein."

The defendant’s motion alludes to defenses in this case, all of which are legal or procedural
in nature, and none of which pass muster, let alone counsel in favor of bail. To begin with, the
notion that the defendant is protected from prosecution by the Non-Prosecution Agreement
(“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of Florida
(“SDFL”) is absurd. That agreement affords her no protection in this District, for at least three
reasons. First, the defendant was not a party to that agreement nor named in it as a third-party
beneficiary, and the defendant offers no basis to think she would have standing to claim any rights
under the NPA. Tellingly, the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that an agreement
she was not a party to and that does not even identify her by name could possibly be invoked to
bar her prosecution. Second, and equally important, the NPA does not bind the Southern District
of New York, which was not a party to the agreement. See United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670,
672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam) (“A plea agreement binds only the office of the United States
Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the
agreement contemplates a broader restriction.”)); United States v. Prisco, 391 F. App’x 920, 921
(2d Cir. 2010). This rule applies even when the text of the agreement refers to the signing party
as the “Government.” Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672.

Third, and perhaps most important, even assuming the NPA could be read to protect this
defendant and bind this Office, which are both legally unsound propositions, the Indictment
' Additionally, and beyond the strong evidence set forth in the Indictment, in just the past week,
and in response to the charges against the defendant being made public, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (“FBI”) and the U.S. Attorney’s Office have been in touch with additional
individuals who have expressed a willingness to provide information regarding the defendant. The
Government is in the process of receiving and reviewing this additional evidence, which has the
potential to make the Government’s case even stronger.
