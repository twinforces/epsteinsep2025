Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals from orders of the District Court entered

are AFFIRMED and that Appellant’s motion for bail, or in the alternative, temporary pretrial
release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3142(i), Dkt. 39, is DENIED. During oral argument, counsel for
Appellant expressed concern that Appellant was improperly being deprived of sleep while
incarcerated. To the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her sleeping conditions, such request
should be addressed to the District Court.
