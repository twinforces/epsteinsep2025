‘Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 38o0f74 38

had presented in the state of Florida that talked about other

allegations leading to the tier three classification.
New Mexico, as I understand it, --

THE COURT: Béforé you get. to New México, the court,

as I read -- and I did this morning. So it.'s fresh in my

mind -—- Judge Pickholz she relied on the state

administrative body that imposed, so to speak, or who in the

first! instance Sdid that a level 3 was the appropriate level,

after considering the series of factors which are reflected in
this transeript.

You know, judges often do just. that. She says in this

transeript that. she's had many of these Cases. They're cGalled

SORA hearings. I must say it's -—- I don't know what the word
is I'm looking for, but. you'll read it yourself.

She was taken aback I have to say, really taken aback,

Jiage Pickholz was, that this application was being presented

to her. She sdysS things like, I have néver eévén the
prosecutor's office do this. So the prosecutor joined in with
defense counsel, 2 think Kirkland & Ellis and the ADA from

Vancé"s office joined together, and they both argued for

lowering the offense lével from a 3 to ail.
She says a few things like that which are pretty

unusual, for a judge to say, in effect -- first of all, she said

the. board madé a recommendation. And second, shé séémied to be

suggesting that. this was uniqué.
