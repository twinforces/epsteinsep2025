Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 38 of 74 38

1 had presented in the state of Florida that talked about other

2 allegations leading to the tier three classification.

3 New Mexico, as Il understand it --

4 THE COURT: Before you get to New Mexico, the court,

5 as I read -- and I did this morning. So it's fresh in my

6 mind —-— Judge Pickholz -- she relied on the state

7 administrative body that imposed, so to speak, or who in the

8 first instance said that a level 3 was the appropriate level,

9 after considering the series of factors which are reflected in
10 this transcript.

11 You know, judges often do just that. She says in this
12 transcript that she's had many of these cases. They're called
13 SORA hearings. I must say it's -- I don't know what the word
14 is I'm looking for, but you'll read it yourself.

15 She was taken aback I have to say, really taken aback,
16 Judge Pickholz was, that this application was being presented
17 to her. She says things like, I have never even the

18 prosecutor's office do this. So the prosecutor joined in with
19 defense counsel. I think Kirkland & Ellis and the ADA from
20 Vance's office joined together, and they both argued for
al lowering the offense level from a 3 toa l.
22 She says a few things like that which are pretty
28 unusual for a judge to say, in effect -- first of all, she said
24 the board made a recommendation. And second, she seemed to be
25 suggesting that this was unique.
