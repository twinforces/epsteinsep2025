‘Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 32 Filed 07/18/19 Page 32 of 33

Defendant and their purported role as indépendent monitors. (The sane: problem arises in
relation to private 24/7 security guards.) This is‘especially’ problematic where, as here, it is
alleged that employees of the Defendant:may: have engaged in unlawful acts with and on. behalf:
of the Defendant. According to. the Government, “the defendant worked with others. including
employes and associates. who facilitated his exploitation. of minors, by among other things.
contacting victims and. scheduling their sexual. encounters with, the defendant, both in New: York
and in Florida.” Dkt. 11, Ex. 1 at 2.

(6) “As a fallback,’ the: Defense suggests the utilization of and. the: funding of a private
security guard agency to “virtually guarantee” Mr. Epstein’s, presence in-court and, presumably,
also to Supervise his behavior. This contitigeéricy plan:is not:a part of Mr. Epstein’s 14 point:
proposal. Nevertheless, the Court is.asked by the defense to “revisit” its legal, viewpoint as,
expressed in an, carlier decision.concerning 24/7 private home security guards.

Each bail package in. each. case. is. considered and. evaluated on its individual merits by: the
Court. And, in view of.the Court's finding of dangerousness. a new bail proposal likely’ would. be
futile. See, e.g., United Ferranti, 66 F.3d at. 544 (“No conecivable conditions coiild ensure the
safely of the community.”); Orena, 986 F.2d at 632 (“We do not-agree thatthe bail conditions set
by. the district: court eliminate the danger to the community or.are superior'to detention for
purposes of the Bail Reform Act.”); United States. v.Colombo, 777 F.2d 96, 100 (2d Cir. 1985)

‘to ‘be a dangerto the community.”).
