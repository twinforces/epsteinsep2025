Ghislaine’s bail hearing. The content of this letter is the truth and within my knowledge
| first met CR NTENTETEETNSrersremermry
Ghislaine and her immediate family have been family friends for decades
Ce Following our first encounter we became close
friends and remained in constant touch ever since. We would always speak on her birthday which
falls on Christmas Day
Ghislaine and | would regularly socialize together as
mongst many other adoring friends and family members. | was
immediately drawn to Ghislaine when | first met her and both her honesty and_integrity shone
_ from the moment we first met and | was therefore delighted to be ——
ey Ghislaine and it deeply disturbs me that a
country as great as the United States would even think that Ghislaine poses a danger to children or
ors and further to this | would have absolutely no hesitation in allowing Ghislaine to look after
Ghislaine is a prominent individual and | believe she will fight these charges to the end. She will not
evade justice and is not in any way a flight risk. She should be granted bail immediately so that she
can form a proper defence to these horrendous charges. She has faced monstrous allegations in the
press that forced her to have to worry about her safety
| am not : paid or retained to provide this letter. | would however respectfully be prepared to
offer any financial surety that | can afford in order to meet any bail pledge that the court may set. |
await t ourts decision and remain on standby should | be asked to fulfil any such commitment
Yo faithfully
