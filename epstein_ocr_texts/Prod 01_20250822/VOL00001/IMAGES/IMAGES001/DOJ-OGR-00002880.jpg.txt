because: “the subpoena. was not craftcd.to call for admissible evidence. ‘Rather, it called for the
production ofthe entire investigative file and ts ‘accurately described as a fishing expedition.”).

Similarly, Request 12:asks for “EVCP Material,” which. is defined as “any submission to
the Epstcin. Victim’s Compensation Program made by You, including any claims.on behalf of
persons who have. accused Jeffrey Epstein, or Ghislaine Maxwell of any misconduct, any releases
signed by You or Your Clients, ‘and. any compensation reecived by You. or Your Clients.” This
Request does not satisfy the Nixon standard—the. Defendant is not a. party or otherwise privy’ to
what information BSF has, submitted to the confidential Epstein Victim’s Compensation.Program.
‘or on. behalf of which clients:BSF has submitted such information. The: Defendant.cannot mercly:
request every piece of confidential information that. BSF submitted to the Program. in the hopes
that something’ relevant and admissible turns up. This Request.thus cannot-pass muster under Rule
1'7(c).

Second, although BSF does not know what arguments. the Defendant:made: in her ex parte
motion, the documents and.items requested in. the Subpoena bear no.apparent. relevance: to. the:
Defendant’s guilt or innocenee of the charges in this matter. And to the extent, they would. be
relevant solely for impeachment purposes, or relevant but inadmissible, the Defendant. cannot:
obtain.them.in advanec of trial pursuant.to. Rule 17(¢). Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 699-700, 701.

Request | secks communications between BSF and the U.S. Attorney about. the Defendant.
from 2015 through the present, ‘and. Requests 3 through 5.seek communications between BSF and.
BSF’s co-counsel from.2015 through. the present regardingany mectings with the: U.S. Attorncy’s
Office about the Defendant. But such communications are not relevant to the Government’s
allegations that the Defendant.cnticed minors to travel, and transported minors, to engage: in sex.
acts between, 1994 to 1.997, nearly ‘20 years’prior to any such communications. ‘Nor do ‘such.
communications bear any apparent. relevance to whether the: Defendant:perjured herself in a, civil
deposition. If-such.communications are relevant, they are only relevant to the Defendant’s false
narrative that: BSF somchow colluded with the Government—an allegation that could serve no
other purpose than impeachment of the.Government’s potential witnesses. Request 8—secking
any grand jury subpoena issucd to. BSF for documents related to litigation. concerning, the
Defendant—is similarly aimed at developing some ill-informed narrative:.of collusion, between,
BSF and the Government, as the Defendant-has on.numcrous occasions.accused.BSF of improperly.
providing the Government: with confidential documents, governed, by a protective order :in a.
Separate civil matter. See, e.g., ECF No. 134 (Defendant’s motion. to suppress evidence obtained
by subpoena‘to what.appears: to 5 be BSF). Even if'these documents were:relevant to anything other

2 Requests 3 through 5 also seek protected work ‘product. Those Requests seck
communications between BSF and its co- >-counsel i in: several. ‘matters s relating to Jelteey Epstein and.
Where a eritninal defendant socks ‘to. subpoena work product, the deferidant c can only’ overcome the
privilege by demonstrating a “substantial need” for the: requested :items and that he “cannot,
without unduc hardship, obtain. their substantial cquivalent by other. means.” United States: v.
Weisberg, No. 08-CR-347 NGG RML, 201.1 WL 1327689, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. ’5,'2011). Given,
the marginal potential evidentiary value of the communications, the Defendant will, be unable to
demonstrate:a substantial need for protected communications, between BSF and its co-counscl.
