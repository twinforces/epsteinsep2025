e New Mexico, Florida And The Virgin Islands |
With respect to Mr. Epstein’s sex offender status in New Mexico, Defense Counsel has |
submitted a letter, dated August 19, 2010, from Regina Chacon, Assistant Bureau Chief, Law |
Enforcement Record Bureau of the New Mexico Department of Public Safety, which states that |
Mr. Epstein “is not required to register [as a sex offender] with the State of New Mexico at this |
time for [his] 2008 Florida conviction of Procuring [a] Person Under 18 for Prostitution.” Dkt. |
25, Ex. A. The Court requested from the Defense all application materials that Mr. Epstein may |
have submitted to the New Mexico Department of Public Safety, believing that the Department |
would not initiate the waiver of Mr. Epstein’s sex offense registration on its own. No such |
materials have been received by the Court as of this date.
The Court understands that Mr. Epstein is also registered as a sex offender in the Virgin
Islands (Level I) and in Florida (Level J). It has received no materials from the Defense
regarding sex offender applications or proceedings in those two jurisdictions.
In sum, based upon all of the proffers and evidence set forth at pp. 10-21 above, the Court
finds by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Epstein poses a danger to other persons and to
the community.
G. Mr. Epstein Also Poses A Risk Of Flight
In the section that follows, the Court considers “risk of flight” even though it has already
determined that Mr. Epstein presents a danger to the community. “[A] finding of either danger :
| to the community or risk of flight will be sufficient to detain the defendant pending trial.” |
