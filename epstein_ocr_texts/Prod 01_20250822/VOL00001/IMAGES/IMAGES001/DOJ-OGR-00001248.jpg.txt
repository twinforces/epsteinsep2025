her intent. not to flée. (Dec. Op. at. 13 7.2). The Court. recognized that, “a defendant could.
strategically: offer to waive the right to: extradition while intending to: resist any subsequent
extradition that might. result.” (Id.). So too here. An offer to renounce her foreign citizenship

“(s]hould. the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary,’ ” (Mot. at, 4) iis another strategic, but.
hollow offer given,that the defendant’ would.be:free to fight.extradition-oncein ‘the: United Kingdom,
or France, or any other jurisdiction of hér choosing (/.¢., the ofie to which she chooses to flee).

As such, the defendant’s claimed “willing[ness]” ‘to renounce her citizenship in. both the:
United Kingdom and. France js little more than, window dressing. After receiving’the defendant’s
Third, Bail Motion, the Government, through the Department of Justicc’s Office of International
Affairs (“OIA”), contacted the French Ministry: of Justice (“MOJ”) to'understand the impact of the
defcndant’s offer to, reriounce her French, citizenship on Franceé’s' categori¢al, unwillingness’ to
deport its own. citizens for crimes they have committed. In response, the MOJ provided the
Government with a. letter setting - forth the relevant. law and conclusively indicating that the:
defendant’s offer to waive her French citizenship will not make her cligible fo be extradited. from
France because, for purposes, of extradition, nationality ‘is assessed. as of the time the charged.
offense Was Committed. That letter in its original French, aswell as an English translation of the
letter, are:attached hercto as Exhibit A. See. Ex. A (“[A]ny loss of nationality subsequent to’ said
‘offense has no bearing, upon the removal. proceedings and shall not supersede said asscssment of
nationality. ” see also Dkt. No. 100, Ex. ‘Bat 3 (MOJ letter stating that the French Code of
at the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested”), The defendant's
renunciation of her Freneh, citizenship in, 202.1 would not change the fact that she was a Freiich
citizen.at the:time she is alleged to have: committed the charged crimes in the 1990s.and 2016. As
such, the defendant’s citizenship at the time of the alleged crimes would’bar her extradition, from
France, making her offer to renounce her French citizenship meaningless..

Meanwhile, the defendant’s offer to give up her British:citizcnship docs not:mean,that' she
will not fight cxtradition.once in.the. United Kingdom or that an ‘extradition request to the: United
Kingdom would ‘be successful. The Government ‘understands ‘from OFA that a. defendant’s
nationality has historically played little to no-role in extradition from.the United Kingdom. ‘Indeed,
Article 3 of the 2003 Extradition. Treaty’ between, the United. States: and the United Kingdom
expressly ‘prohibits using nationality as a basis to, deny extradition. See
https://www.congress.gow/108/cdoc/tdoc23/CDOC-108tdoc23.pdf at 5 (“Extradition shall not be
refused based. on the nationality of the person sought.”); see:.a/so ‘Crown Prosecution Service,
Extradition, Legal Guidance; International and organised erime (May ‘12, 2020),
‘https: /Iwww: eps.gov.uk/legal- guidance/extradition, (setting ‘forth the statutory bars ‘to extradition,
which do not.include nationality). In. any event, assuming the Government could. locate and.
apprehend the defendant if she. were to,‘fleé, as set forth. in. the Government’s opposition, to the
Second Bail Motion, a judge in. the United, Kingdom must. make an independent decision on,
passage of time, ‘forum, and. considerations of the individual’ 'S ‘mental. or ¢ physical condition. The
Government ‘understands from ‘OIA that extradition. from. the United Kingdom, is, frequently’
extensively litigated, unecrtain, and subject’ to multiple levels of appeal. ‘This process is lengthy,
complicated,, and time- -consuming, and would provide ‘no measure of justice. to the victims: who
