articulated in Annabi “really has no analytically sound foundation [in Second Circuit case law].
It just keeps replicating itself each time it is cited.” Gebbie, 294 F.3d at 547.

It appears that the Second Circuit is the only court of appeals to take the position
articulated in Annabi. Given that three circuits have held otherwise—and that one of them has
addressed the Second Circuit’s reasoning in Annabi in detail—it is likely that the Eleventh
Circuit would follow the weight of authority and hold that absent an express provision to the
contrary, a plea agreement or non-prosecution agreement executed in the name of “the United
States” binds USAOs in other districts.

As previously demonstrated, there is no conflict between this position and Annabi as
applied to these facts, because Annabi supports dismissal here. But to the extent that Annabi
could be construed as limiting the NPA’s effect to the SDFL, it would be inconsistent with the
Eleventh Circuit’s likely disposition of the issue and should not be followed here.

We understand that Epstein and his counsel sought to ensure, to the fullest extent
possible, that third parties would not face criminal liability in connection with his actions, in part
to minimize the likelihood that he would be subpoenaed as a witness. Thus, Epstein and his
counsel reasonably understood that, unlike Epstein’s own immunity, the immunity for his alleged
co-conspirators from federal prosecution would not be limited to the SDFL. To the extent that
the government intended to impose such a limitation, it was the obligation of the government, in
drafting the agreement, to ensure that such limitations were included. Having failed to do so, the
government may not now ask this Court to read limitations into the co-conspirator immunity
provision that it did not include at the time the NPA was negotiated.
