1 order. I think, frankly, the outcome of that will be effected
2 by the coming week. But we do expect to have those

5 conversations and therefore request that speedy trial time be

4 excluded until Monday.

5 THE COURT: I am going to find under 18 United States
6 Code 3161 that the request for adjournment, joined in by both

7 sides, to and including Monday the 15th at 10:00 a.m., is

8 appropriate and warrants exclusion of the adjourned time from

9 speedy trial calculations.

10 I further find that the exclusion is designed to

11 prevent any possible miscarriage of justice to facilitate these
12 proceedings and, initially at least, so that counsel has time
13 to prepare written bail submission and to guarantee effective
14 representation of and preparation by counsel for both sides.

15 Thus, the need for exclusion and the ends of justice outweigh
16 the interests of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial
17 pursuant to 18 U.S.C. section 3161(h) (7) (A) and (B).

18 Does anybody want to add anything to today's session?
19 MR. ROSSMILLER: Your Honor. May we have one more
20 moment with defense counsel?
al THE COURT: Sure.
22 (Pause)
23 MR. ROSSMILLER: Nothing from the government. Your
24 Honor.
25 THE COURT: Defense?
