1 with the mandates, whether it's an administrative agency or a

2 court's bail release order.

5 Three, I know of no other proceedings, in answer to

4 the question your Honor asked -- I think it was question two -â€”-
5 like the proceedings in New York.

6 I will verify that with the counsel in the different

7 jurisdictions who can provide primary rather than secondary or
8 hearsay evidence so we can give you in an additional submission
9 some meaningful and particularized responses to your Honor's

10 questions of this morning.

11 THE COURT: That would be helpful.

12 There are two things. One is another disclosure on my
13 part. I did happen to read in the New York Post a story about
14 the New York state sex offender registration.

15 The thrust of that story was that Mr. Epstein -- or at
16 least it appeared to me to be the thrust -- was not in

17 compliance with his obligations in New York.

18 Again, it's a newspaper story. I did see it. I share
19 it with you. You probably saw it too.
20 MR. WEINBERG: I think I did. I think that's where I
21 checked with counsel, and that's where I learned of this
22 nine-day rule which I was not familiar with before checking.
28 But what I can say is nobody on the New York side has
24 ever informed Mr. Epstein, despite the now ten-day deluge of
25 publicity, that he has ever been in violation.
