1 directly.

2 MR. WEINBERG: I'd rather you ask him, your Honor.

3 Thank you.

4 THE COURT: Then we'll get to Mr. Boies.

5 By the way, before we do, does everybody here except
6 me know who the two people are who got the $250,000 and

7 $100,000 checks?

8 MR. ROSSMILLER: Your Honor, we've advised defense

9 counsel who those individuals were. Yes.

10 THE COURT: Can you tell us.

11 MR. ROSSMILLER: We're not prepared to make that

12 statement currently, your Honor.

13 MR. WEINBERG: Generically, your Honor, they're

14 long-time friends and employees of Mr. Epstein. One is a

15 friend. One is an employee.

16 THE COURT: Okay. The only question I really have --
17 MR. ROSSMILLER: I'm sorry, your Honor. I apologize
18 for interrupting.

19 I should say the government is more than happy to
20 advise the Court of that information in a sealed submission. I
21 just don't want to reveal the names of potential witnesses and
22 frankly potential victims in open court at this time.
23 THE COURT: So you know them, and the defense knows
24 them as well.
25 MR. ROSSMILLER: We're happy for the Court to know
