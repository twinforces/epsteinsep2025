Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant’s letter of
August 17, 2020 (the “Defense Letter’), requesting that the Court enter an order permitting the
defendant to file under seal in certain civil cases (the “Civil Cases”) discovery materials produced
by the Government in the instant criminal case, and to refer to, but not file, additional other
discovery materials produced by the Government in the Civil Cases. Those applications should
be denied."

As an initial matter, the Government has already produced, and will continue to produce,
substantial volumes of materials in discovery consistent with its obligations. Those include
materials the Government obtained via search warrant, grand jury subpoenas, or other investigative
methods available only to the Government. Indeed, the Government has already produced more
than 165,000 pages of discovery to the defense, including the materials relevant to the Defense
Letter. Through her most recent application, the defendant seeks permission to use, in unrelated
civil litigation, materials produced pursuant to the protective order in this case and designated
“Confidential” thereunder. As detailed herein, the Government’s designation is entirely
appropriate given that the materials—court orders and applications—have been kept under seal by
the issuing judges, and pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.

' The Government has drafted this letter in a manner that avoids revealing the contents of sealed

materials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the Government does not seek permission to

seal or redact this submission. Because the Defense Letter repeatedly references, and attaches as

exhibits, materials that are sealed and that would jeopardize an ongoing grand jury investigation if

filed publicly, the Government intends to submit a separate letter, under seal, proposing redactions

to the Defense Letter and requesting that the attachments to the Defense Letter be filed under seal.
