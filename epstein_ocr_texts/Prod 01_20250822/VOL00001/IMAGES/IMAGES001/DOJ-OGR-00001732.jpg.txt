Re: United States‘v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr..330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition. to the: defendant’s. letter of
August. 17, 2020 (the “Defense Letter”), requesting that the Court enter an. order permitting the
defendant:to file:under seal.in, certain,civil cases (the “Civil, Cases”) discovery materials. produced.
by the Government in the instant criminal case, and to. refer to, but, not file, additional other
discovery materials’ produced by ‘the. Goverhinient iin. the Civil. Gases. Those applications should.
be:denied.' :

As an initial matter, the ‘Government has already produced, and, will continue 'to produce,
substantial, volunics of materials in discovery consistent, with its obligations. Those include
matcrials.the Government obtained via.scarch. warrant, grand jury subpocnas, or other investigative
methods available only to > the Government. Indeed, ‘the Government has already produced more
Letter. Through: her most recent ‘application, the defendant secks: permission, tor usc, in, n-unrelated.
civil, litigation, materials produced pursuant to the, protective order ‘in this case and. designated
“Confidential” thereunder. As, detailed licrcin, the Government’s. designation is entirely’
appropriate given:that the matcrials—court orders.and applications—have ‘been kept under scal by:
the issuing judges, and. pertain:to an ongoing’ criminal, investigation.

"The Government has drafted. this letter in.a manner that avoids revealing the contents of scaled
materials and grand jury information. Accordingly, the:Government does ‘not seck: permission to
seal or'redact this subniission. Because the Defense Letter répeatedly ‘references, and attaches as
exhibits, materials that are scaled and that would jeopardize an-ongoing grand jury: investigation if
filed publicly, the:Government intends to submit a scparate Ictter, under scal, proposing: x redactions
to the Defense’Letter and:requesting thatthe attachments fo the Defense Letter be filed under scal.
