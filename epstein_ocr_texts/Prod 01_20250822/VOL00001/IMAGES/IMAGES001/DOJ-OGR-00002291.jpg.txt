Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 120: Filed 01/25/21 Page 13.of 19

(Indictment 4 2; accord id. 4,8.) As discussed.in Ms. Maxwells Memorandum in, Support of her
Motion to Dismiss Counts Five and Six, bécause'the statements at 1ssuc aré not, perjurious, the
questions asked were confusing, ambiguous, and. improperly formed. None of the questions, or
any answers, were material, to any issuc in the defamation action. There‘were no “crimes”
concealed by.Ms. Maxwell’s answers:which. were both true and reflective. ofthe poor
‘questioning by the plaintiff's lawyers. The Government does not articulate how:statements like:
“T don’t know what: you.are‘talking about,” an. admission, that, Ms. Maxwell “could not make a
list” upon demand, her lack of knowledge about undefined “devices” or. “toys” could possibly:
“conceal her crimes.” Accordingly, the government’s purported, connection between the Perjury
Counts and the Mann.Act Counts defics logic: and:is insufficient to:permit:joinder under Rule
8(a). See Botti, 2009 WL 3157582, at *5 (joinder improper due to “speculative nature of the
Jink” between, structuring counts alleging false statements to IRS: agent and, separate: corruption
counts); Milan, 2009 WL 2328870, at.*3 Goinder improper where. alleged perjury arose. from.
false statement in, connection,with defendant’s bail application, not an, attempt to “cover up”
‘underlying scheme to defraud with which defendant was charged).

B. The Perjury'Counts.Should Be Severed, Under Rule 14(a) Because ‘Their
Inclusion Will Substantially Prejudice Ms. Maxwell at Trial

Even.if the Court finds. that joinder is. properunder Rule. 8, the Court should nevertheless.
‘exercise its: diserction tosever Counts Five and. Six ‘under Rule 14(a) because of'the substantial
prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.and. these proccedings. A joint trial of the Perjury Counts will ‘require:
a. full-blown-re-litigation. of the defamation action, which-will result :in.a collateral matter taking
over the trial. Substantial amounts of evidence that: would-be inadmissible and irrelevant as to
the Mann. Act Counts ‘will, nccessarily, be presented in. order to:prove the Perjury Counts. For

example, there:will need to be a.collateral trial.on. whether Virginia Roberts Giuffre’s statements
