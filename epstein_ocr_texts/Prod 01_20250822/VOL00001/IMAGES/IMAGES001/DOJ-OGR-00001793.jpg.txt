Although the Government does not believe it has any obligation to gather or review emails
sent or received by attorneys at the USAO-SDFL as part of their separate, prior investigation, the
Government nonetheless intends to gather and review the emails sent to or from Attorney-1 to the
extent those emails were preserved and gathered by OPR. As noted, Attorney-1 was the primary
line assistant on that investigation, and Attorney-1’s emails are thus the most likely to contain
communications with or regarding potential witnesses. The Government has already obtained
Attorney-1’s emails from OPR, and given the volume, the Government intends to load those emails
into an electronic review platform and then conduct targeted searches of those emails for terms
relevant to this case, including the defendant’s name and the names of victims and witnesses.
Based on our understanding of the USAO-SDFL investigation, we do not believe that there are a
substantial number of overlapping victims or witnesses between that investigation and this
prosecution. But to the extent searches of Attorney-1’s emails reveal non-duplicative Giglio or
3500 material for any such victims or witnesses, the Government will produce any such identified
material consistent with any schedule for pre-trial disclosures set by the Court. The Government
does not intend to request or review emails for any other USAO-SDFL or Department of Justice
attorney or otherwise perform a comprehensive review of the internal e-mails of that prosecutor’s
office from its wholly separate investigation, including by asking for any other material gathered
by OPR as part of its investigation.

Sixth, beginning in or about 2019, attorneys with the United States Attorney’s Office for
the Southern District of Georgia (“USAO-SDGA”) were designated to participate in the
representation of the United States in civil litigation brought by Epstein victims for violations of
the Crime Victim Rights Act (“CVRA”) by the USAO-SDFL in connection with the Florida
Investigation after the USAO-SDFL was recused from that civil litigation. The Government
intends to contact the USAO-SDGA and ask whether it (a) had any substantive communications
with witnesses relevant to this prosecution during its participation in the CVRA civil litigation, or
(b) gathered any information regarding the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell. If so, the Government
will request any and all records regarding those topics and will review those records for materials
that warrant disclosure in this case. Otherwise, the Government does not intend to request or
review any materials from the USAO-SDGA.

As noted above, none of these other offices or agencies has played any role in the
investigation or prosecution of this case. In particular, none of these offices and agencies has
participated in witness interviews or taken any other investigative steps with the Prosecution Team.
Nor did any representative of these other offices or agencies play any role in developing strategy,
making charging decisions, or presenting this case to the grand jury. Accordingly, although the
Government maintains that none of these agencies is part of the Prosecution Team in this case,
given the similarity of the nature of the conduct investigated in this case and the conduct
investigated by those other offices and agencies, the Government is prepared to undertake the
extensive efforts described above to obtain and review additional material. The Government will
continue to produce any portion of those materials that warrants disclosure in this case, including
in connection with its production of Giglio and 3500 material.
