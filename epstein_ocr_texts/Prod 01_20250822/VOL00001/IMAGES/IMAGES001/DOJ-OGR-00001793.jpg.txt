Although the Government docs:not belicye:it has any: obligation, to: gather or revicw emails
sent or reccived. by. attorneys at the USAO-SDFL as part.of their:separate, prior investigation, the
Government nonctheless intends to gather and ‘review: the cmails, sent to or: from Attorney=1 to the
extent those emails were preserved and gathered by OPR. As noted, Attorncy-1 was the primary’
line assistant on that investigation, and Attorney-1’s emailsare thus the most likely to. contain.
communications with or regarding potential witnesses. The Government: has already obtained.
Attorncy-1.’s. cmails from OPR, and.given,the volume, the Government intends to load those emails
into an, cleetronic ‘review. platform and, then, conduct: targeted, searches of those, emails for terms
relévant ‘to this case, including the defendant’s name and ‘the names of ‘victims and.'witnesses.
Based on our tinderstanding of the USAO-SDEL investigation, we do not belicve that'there. are a.
substantial. number .of overlapping victims or witnesscs between that investigation and. this
prosccution. But'to the extent searches of Attorney-1’s emails reyeal non-duplicative Giglio or
3500 material for any:such, victims or witnesses, the Government will produce:any such identified.
material consistent with any’ schedule for pre- -irial disclosures set by the Court. ‘The Government.
attorney ‘or otherwise e perform a comprehensive review of the internal e-mails of that prosecutor’ 'S
‘office from its wholly separate investigation, including by: asking. for any: other material gathered.
by OPR. as part of its investigation.

the Souithern District “of Georgia (USAO- SDGA”) * ‘were ~ designated to “participate in “the
representation of the United. States in civil. litigation brought by Epstein victims for violations of
the Crime Victim ‘Rights Act (“CVRA”) by the USAQ-SDFL in connection with the Florida.
Investigation. after the USAO-SDEL, was recused. from. that. civil litigation. The Government.
intends to contact'the USAO-SDGA and, ask whether it (a), had, any substantive Communications
with witnesses relevant to this prosccution during’ its participation in-the CVRA.civil litigation, or
(b) gathered any information regarding the: defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell. If'so, the: Government:
will:request any and all records regarding those topics and:will review those records for materials
that warrant. disclosure in this:case. Otherwise, the Government: docs not; intend, to request or:
review any materials from the USAO-SDGA.

As noted above, ‘none of these other offices, or agencies has, played any role ‘in the
investigation or prosecution. of this case. In -particular, ‘nore of these offices and. agencics has
participated in witness interviews or taken any other i investigative steps with the.Prosecution. Team.
Nor did any representative of these: other offices or.agencics play any:role in developing strategy,
making charging decisions, or presenting this case fo the g grand j jury. Accordingly, although the
Government ‘maintains that none, of these agencics. is part; of the Prosceution Team in'this ease,
given. the similarity of the nature of the conduct investigated in this case and the conduct:
investigated by those other offices and agencies, the Govertiment is prepared to undertake the
extensive.cfforts described above to obtain and. review additional material. The -Government will.
‘continue to. produce any: portion. of those materials that warrants disclosure in, this case, including:
in, connection, with its production.of Giglio and 3500 material.
