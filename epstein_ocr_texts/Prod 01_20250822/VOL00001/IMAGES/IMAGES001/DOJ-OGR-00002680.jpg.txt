PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Motion to
Strike Surplusage from the Indictment (“Motion”).

Although Ms. Maxwell is charged with conspiring to cause individuals to travel in
interstate or foreign commerce to engage in unlawful sexual activity, the indictment contains no
allegation that Accuser-3 ever traveled.’ Moreover, throughout the period alleged in the
indictment, Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent in England, where all alleged conduct
as to her took place. Therefore, the Court should strike all allegations regarding Accuser-3 from
the indictment, as they are nothing more than a transparent attempt by the government to
introduce Accuser-3’s testimony as evidence of a conspiracy, when it is at most “other acts”
evidence subject to the balancing test required by Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).

Counts One through Four of the indictment allege that between 1994 and 1997, Ms.
Maxwell violated and conspired to violate two separate provisions of the Mann Act: 18 U.S.C.
§ 2422 (now § 2422(a)), which prohibits the enticement of individuals to travel in interstate or
foreign commerce for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity, and 18 U.S.C.

§ 2423(a), which prohibits the transportation of individuals under age 18 in interstate or foreign
commerce with the intent that they engage in unlawful sexual activity. The substantive Mann
Act counts involve Ms. Maxwell’s alleged enticement and/or transportation of Accuser-1.

The indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell engaged in group sexual encounters with
Jeffrey Epstein and Accuser-1 and that, on at least one occasion, Ms. Maxwell enticed or caused
Accuser-1 to travel from Florida to New York for the purpose of engaging in such encounters
with Epstein. But to do so, it must rely on the accusations of a single individual regarding
' This individual is described in the indictment as Minor Victim-3. Similarly, we refer to the individuals identified
in the indictment as Minor Victim-1 and Minor Victim-2 as Accuser-1 and Accuser-2, respectively.
