IV. ‘Witnesses Whose Memories Have Failed, or Corrupted.

Many potential witnesses have been. contacted in relation to, this matter and other related
litigations. Significant numbers of potential'witnesses no longer-remember when,cvents may
have occurred, who was present, and do not have documents to refresh. their memories. One
cxaniple of:the. pervasive and prejudicial meniory loss relates. to the identity of passengers or MF:
Epstein’s planes. Dave Rodgers was onc of Mr. Epstein’s pilots beginning’ in .991.'Mr. Rodgers
kept: flight: logs, produced in.civil litigation and. subsequently released or caked ‘to the media.
The logs contain.the dates, locations of travel, and.a rudimentary list of'passengers, often
identified only by gender, initials, or one name.'Mr. Rodgers destroyed:-records prior to 1994.
According to Mr. Rodgers, without his logs he is unable to récall who was on.a particular ‘flight.
Ex. C at 211-212. And, even with the logs ‘he cannot identify many ofthe passengers. “Maria”
may or. may not be:a witness in ‘this matter. /d: at 41. Where the logbook describes “one or two.”
females, Mr. Rodgers has. id memory of who those. people were. Jd. at 44-45. Referring toa
flight involving “Nadia,” Mr. Rodgers testified “I’m:not sure what. Nadia that would-be.” Jd. 58.
The ‘widespread. dissemination of the flightlogs combined'with the vague. passenger descriptions,
has allowed.any female: who might have been‘under the age of. 18 between 1.994-2013 to claim.
that they'were ‘on the flight:and a victim of Epstein.
