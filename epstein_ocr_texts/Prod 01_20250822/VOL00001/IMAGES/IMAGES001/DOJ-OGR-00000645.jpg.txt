1 court must still make its own independent determination. A

2 conclusory statement from the government that dismissal is

3 appropriate does not satisfy the court's obligations.

4 It is also, in my view, required that the court

5 consider the views of the victims in the case at the hearing

6 and before deciding whether to grant the motion. This is being
7 done here both as a matter of law and as a measure of respect

8 that we have for the victims' difficult decisions to come

9 forward in this matter.

10 In a case called United States v. Heaton,

11 H-e-a-t-o-n-, the government filed a Rule 48 motion for leave
12 to dismiss a charge against a defendant who allegedly committed
13 a sexual offense against a young victim. Although I should

14 point out, very importantly, that that defendant was still

15 alive, which distinguishes it from our case.

16 Nevertheless, I think it is irrelevant because in

17 evaluating the Rule 48 motion, then district Judge Paul G.

18 Cassell -- who is now a law professor at the University of Utah
19 and is regarded to be a noted expert in victims' rights --
20 concluded that under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, victims
21 have broad rights that extend to a court's decision whether to
22 grant a government motion to dismiss under Rule 48.
23 I completely share that viewpoint in these
24 circumstances, even though the facts of our case, as I said,
25 are somewhat different from those in Heaton. I believe it is
