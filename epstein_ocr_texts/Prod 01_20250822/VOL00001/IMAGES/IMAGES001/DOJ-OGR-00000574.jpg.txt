Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 64 of 74 64

1 Here's how we know that it's not the case that someone
2 who doesn't commit a crime for 15 years, if that is the case

3 here, but for someone who has not been convicted of a crime for
4 15 years, that that establishes the rebuttal of presumption.

5 The reason we know that's not the case is because

10 then you're not convicted of a crime for a while, that that

11 itself rebuts the presumption, really turns the presumption on
12 its head. That simply doesn't make any sense, your Honor.

14 is related, the statute of limitations goes very far back. And
15 in fact, there is no explanation for this type of crime.

16 Congress has decided that if you commit sex crimes

17 against children, you will have to look over your shoulder for
18 the rest of your life. And that's as it should be, your Honor.
19 Certainly there is no argument here from the defense regarding
20 the statute of Limitations.

23 have been charged. So in discussions of obstruction, in
24 discussions of witness tampering.
25 Your Honor, the idea that if there was misconduct it
