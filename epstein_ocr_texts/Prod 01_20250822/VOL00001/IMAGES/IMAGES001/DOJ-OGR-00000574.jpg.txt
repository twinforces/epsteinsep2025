‘Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 64of74 64

Here's how we know that it's not the case that. someone

who. doesn't. commit a crime for 15 years, if that is the case

here, but for someone who has not beén convicted of a Grime for
15; years, that that establishes thé rebuttal of présumption.
The reason we know that's not. the case is because

someone who is 7/0 years old who is arrested for the very first

time who's lived a@ law-abiding life for 70 years is still

subject ‘to the presumption.

So. the idea that if youtre convicted of a crime and
then you're mot convicted of a crime for a while, that that
itself rebuts the presumption, really turns the presumption, on
its head. That simply doesn't make any sense, yotir Honor.

With respect to the idea that it's old conduct. which
us related, the statute of limitations goes very far back. And
in fact, there is no explanation for this type of crime.

Congress has dsécided that if you Commit Sex crimes

against. children, you will havé to 100k Ovér your Shoulder for

the rest of yyour life. And that's as it should be, your Honor.

Certainly there is no argument here from the defense regarding

the statute of limitations.

The defense has argued a couplé different timés about,

a couple different things that if there was a crime, it would

nave been charged. So in discussions of obstruction, in

discussions of witness tampering.

Your Hénor, the idéa that if theré was miSéonduct. it
