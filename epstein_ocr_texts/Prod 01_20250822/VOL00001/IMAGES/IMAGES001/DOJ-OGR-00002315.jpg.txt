‘Case. 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 124 Filed 01/25/21 Page:5.of 8

In many: cases the bar for sufficiency of an indictment is low. It is also true that courts
find, :in certain casés, that‘the discovery:provided.in connection with the matter'may cure various
pleading deficiencies. See, ¢.g.,. United States v. Jain, No. 19-CR-59\(PKC), 2019. WL 6888635,
at *2 (S:D.N.Y. Dee. 18, 2019) (“When supplemented by discovery material, no additional,
information is necessary for'trial preparation or to-prevent surprisc.”). However, “while an
indictment:parroting the language ofa federal ‘criminal. statute: is ‘often, sufficient, there are: crimes:
that must be charged with greater specificity.” United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549. U.S. 1.02. at:
109.

These are those crimes.

Here; neither the Indictment nor the discovery inform Ms. Maxwell about critical
information necessary to prepare her defense. The Indictment.contains multiple.open-ended time
periods:

° “from at least in or about 1994, up to and. ineluding at; least; in or about 1997”

o “beginning in.at:least.1994” 4 4.

These phrases make the time frame alleged limitless and. micaningless for application of
the:statute of limitations ‘or any defense.

In. addition. to not identifying the individuals accusing Ms. Maxwell, of.a crime, the
Indictment, through the'use of inconsistent and vague phrases, makes it impossible. to know who
may, or may not, be someone that the Government claims:is a“‘victim.”

e ‘minor girls” ¢ 1;
e “victims” 1;
o “vietims'were as young as 14” 13

o “certain girls were in fact. under'the age of 18” 4 1;
