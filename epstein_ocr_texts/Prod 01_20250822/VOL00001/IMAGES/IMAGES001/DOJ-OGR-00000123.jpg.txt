Epstein from 2001 to 2007, other offenses that were
the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office
investigation, and any offenses that arose from the
related grand jury investigation.

The Court has no trouble concluding that the
perjury counts are not covered by the NPA. Those
charges do not relate to conduct in which Maxwell
conspired with Epstein and stem from depositions in
2016, more than eight years after Epstein signed the
NPA. Maxwell now concedes as much, though her
motion sought to dismiss the $1 superseding indictment
in its entirety, perjury counts and all.

The Mann Act counts, too, fall comfortably outside
the NPA’s scope. The S1 superseding indictment
charges conduct occurring exclusively between 1994
and 1997, some four years before the period covered by
the Southern District of Florida investigation and the
NPA. The NPA does not purport to immunize Epstein
from liability for crimes committed before the period
that was the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s
Office investigation. Maxwell’s protection is no
broader. The Court thus concludes that the NPA does
not cover the offenses charged in the S1 superseding
indictment.

C. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary
hearing

In the alternative to dismissing the indictment,
Maxwell requests that the Court conduct an eviden-
tiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The
Court finds no basis to do so.

The cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings
on the scope of a plea agreement mostly involved oral
agreements where there was no written record of the
full set of terms reached by the parties. All of them
