interest in these offences being tried®. Similarly, there is a high threshold in relation to injustice’,
and it is very unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to meet it. There is a general presumption that
Justice will be done despite the passage of time and the burden is on the requested person to establish
the contrary’. In assessing injustice, the appropriate judge would have regard to the procedural
safeguards that exist under US domestic law”. Further, the judge is very likely to place weight on the
fact that Ms Maxwell had, in the hypothetical scenario under consideration, absconded from ongoing
proceedings that would otherwise have resulted in her trial in the US. As the English High Court
expressed it in Zollman “the very fact that the accused invokes justice to prevent [their] extradition
requires consideration of the circumstances which have led to the fact that [they are] not facing
justice in the country from which [they have] fled””°. In those circumstances it is very unlikely that
Ms Maxwell would be able to rely on the bar of passage of time to defeat extradition.

Forum

32. It is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to rely on the bar of forum, which applies where
extradition would not be in the interests of justice because: (a) a substantial measure of the requested
person’s ‘relevant activity’ ”’ occurred in the UK; and (b) having regard to ‘the specified matters’””
relating to the interests of justice (and only those matters), the extradition should not take place”.

33. Although some of the conduct alleged in the superseding indictment is said to have occurred in
London”, three of the ‘specified matters’ are likely to weigh heavily against a finding that extradition
would be barred by forum. First, it appears that the majority of the harm caused by the offending”
alleged in the superseding indictment occurred in the United States. An extradition judge would treat
