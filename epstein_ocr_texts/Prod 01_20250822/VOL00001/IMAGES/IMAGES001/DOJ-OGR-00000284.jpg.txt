Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document6 Filed 07/11/19 Page11 of 16

Other than his 2008 guilty plea predicated. on conduct substantially overlapping the same
conduct.charged here, Mr. Epstein has, no criminal history. ‘Congress specifically listed these
factors as considerations for the Court, and their absence: therefore should weigh. in favor of Mr.
Epstein’s pretrial. release. Mr..Epstcin comes from a-stable and humble ‘family: background.. All
of his: remaining, family. members, his brother, niece, and. nephew, reside:in the United States.
Through his business and. the’ five residences he maintains in the United States, Mr. Epstcin
employs people, many of whom have been with, him for more than.a,decade, and fecls personally:
responsible for their livelihoods. Mr. Epstein.is admittedly wealthy with. all of his financial
resources (other than his Paris residence) in the United States (inéluding the U.S. ‘Virgin Islands)
and will provide: the Court with:more specific information regarding his asscts.in a scaled
supplemental disclosure priorto the upcoming, bail, hearing if'the Court.grants leave to file:such, a.
sealcd;supplement. Mr. Epstcin has, to this point, not provided. a complete financial disclosure
on advice of counsel, motivated by a desire to cnsure the accuracy of the information ‘provided to
the Court. During:the years since his release, from.incarceration. in ¢onncétion with. his, Florida
guilty plea, Mr. Epstein has been a. law- abiding citizen without a single allegation of criminal
misconduct: during that.period and‘has :focuscd:his ‘efforts on business and philanthropy. At the
Court’s request, Mr. ‘Epstein, will provide a scaled list. of his philanthropic donations.

Crucially, the government has failed’to proffer any cvidence that Mr. Epstein has ever
indicated. an intent to flee from this: investigation. or any other criminal. matter, ‘which. several
courts have observed. is a.critical factor in evaluating. whether pretrial release is appropriate: See
Hanson, 613 F.Supp. 2d at 90 (“In this case, ... . there is no strong circumstantial evidence
indicating x that Mrs. Hanson. intends to flee the United States”): United Stales'v. Vortis, 785 F.2d,
327 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (serious intent.to flee is an important factor); United States ¥. Cole, TLS E.
Supp. 677, 679 (E.D. Pa.1988) (defendant told undercover agents he would flee if.arrested). In.
fact, Mr. Epstein has displayed long: ‘term, consistent compliance with. Court orders and other
legal requirements. Asa result:of his 2008 guilty-plea and corresponding ; ‘sex-offender
designation, Mr., Epstcin ‘is required to (1) register for life as a, sex, offender; (2), regularly verify
his address ‘with Virgin Islands, Florida, and-New York authorities; (3) annually update his
registry photograph; and (4) provide registration. authorities with detailed itineraries for all travel
(both domestic and. international) in which he:engages.. Mr. Epstcin-has strictly complied with
these: requirements, without exception, for approximately ten ycars.

The Court inquired,about the relationship of the New"York State registration
classification. arid the:requirements of the Bail Réform Act. Arid while it is true that the New
York: Appellate.Division. held that Mr. Epstein was appropriately: classificd as a.level-three: sex.
offender, this inquiry was entirely backward-looking,and based on the allegations contained. in a
Florida probable cause’ affidavit-describing conduct ending in 2005 that were neither admittcd-to
nor within'the scope of Mr. Epstein’s guilty plea. See.People'v: Epsiein,'89 A.D. 3d,570, 571
(N.Y. App. Div. 2011). While Mr. Epstein has madestio subsequent. attempt to challenge the
continuing nature. of his designation, his law-abiding behavior for the énsuing decade plus
