B. At A Minimum, This Court Should Order A Hearing At Which Maxwell
May Inquire Into The Circumstances Surrounding The Government?s

Misrepresentations To Cd

Ifthe Court is disinclined.to grant relicf'on the present record, then at a:‘minimum it.
should-hold an evidentiary. hearing‘to probe the government’s misstatements to [+d
and the extent to which the prosecutor’s office had, in fact, coordinated with ______| prior
to'the issuance: of the grand jury subpoena. These factual. issues ‘go directly to whether the
predicate finding for(— _] ruling—namely, that no Chemical Bank, collusion had.
occurted—was mistaken. See, @.&., United, Statés v. Paredés-Cordéva, No. S1 03 CR. 987DAB,,
2009 WL 1585776, at:*1 (S.D'N.Y. June 8, 2009) (“An evidentiary hearing is normally required
‘to. address motions’to suppress ‘where a factual issue is in dispute.”).

An evidentiary hearing is: warranted for :an. additional reason as well: If it turns out-that
the prosecutor knew (or was reckless in not-knowing) that 7] had previously
approached.his office, both before and after the Maxwell depositions, in an.cffort'to:stir up a
criminal:prosccution and. dangled the deposition transcripts as.a.carrot, then. suppression would
be-warranted on that basis alone. Cf /-ranks v. Delaware, 438'U.S. 154,,155-56 (1978) United
States v..Rajaratnam, 719 F.3d 139, 146,(2d Cit. 2013) (“Pranks instructs a district court'to hold.
a hearing, to determine whether the: alleged misstatements ‘or omissions in the warrant or-wirctap
application;were made intentionally or with reckless disregard for the truth and, ifso, whether
any such misstatements. or omissions were material.”).

For these reasons, this Court should: (1) suppress all evidence the government obtained
from {Jani any other evidence derived. therefrom} or (2). suppress the April and July
2016 depositions and all. evidence derived therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts. Five.and Six.

Maxwell requests an.cvidentiary. hearing on this: Motion.
