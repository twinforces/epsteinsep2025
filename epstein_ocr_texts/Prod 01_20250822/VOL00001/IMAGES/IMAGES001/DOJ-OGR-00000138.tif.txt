occurred. The indictment adequately describes the
time and place of the charged conduct.

Maxwell next contends that allegations of noncriminal
conduct render the charges impermissibly vague. The
Court disagrees. Rule 7 requires only that the language of
the indictment track the language of the statute and
provide a rough account of the time and place of the
crime. Tramunti, 513 F.2d at 1113. The language of the
S1 superseding indictment does so. The Government’s
decision to provide more details than those strictly
required does not hamper Maxwell’s ability to prepare
a defense. Maxwell’s argument that some of the con-
duct alleged is not inherently criminal goes to the
merits of the Government’s case, not the specificity of
the charges.

Finally, Maxwell argues that the indictment is
vague because the government does not provide the
names of the alleged victims. The Court sees no basis
to require that the alleged victims’ names be included
the indictment. The names of victims, even if important,
generally need not appear there unless their omission
would seriously prejudice the defendant. See United
States v. Stringer, 730 F.3d 120, 127 (2d Cir. 2013);
United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364, 369
(S.D.N.Y. 2019). Maxwell likely knows the identity of
the alleged victims described in the indictment at this
point because the Government has provided extensive
discovery on them. Moreover, the Government has
agreed to disclose their names in advance of trial.
There is thus no unfairness here. See Stringer, 730
F.3d at 126. As discussed below, the Court will require
the parties to negotiate and propose a full schedule for
all remaining pretrial disclosures.
