1 prosecutors who have worked this investigation and this case,

2 which is very different in experience for all of my clients and
3 the other Epstein victims in this case, because they were

4 allowed to be a part of the process. While some of them

5 elected not to be here today, that opportunity should always be
6 allowed for them.

7 In 2008, we filed that case under the Crime Victims'

8 Rights Act because our clients' rights were violated, and as

9 your Honor knows, a federal judge has ruled in our clients'

10 favor that their rights were violated. So this hearing today
11 means a lot to them. The fact that they may never get their

12 chance to speak in court, they may never get complete closure,
13 and all of us have to wonder, if their rights had been afforded
14 them the first time, would any of us be here right now. Or

15 wouldn't it more likely be the case that everyone, including

16 Jeffrey Epstein, would have turned out better for it?

17 Today, I have not only represented, but met and become
18 very close with many of these victims. Many of these

19 survivors. They are very strong people. They are people who
20 have persevered through a lot of adversity. It's been a roller
21 coaster of emotions that has led us to where we are today. And
22 while they have all been cast over the years because of the
23 secrecy of the first investigation, in the shadow as victims,
24 you can't put them all in one bucket and say one size fits all.
25 They are each individual people who were harmed differently and
