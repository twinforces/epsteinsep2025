charges alleged-in, Counts One through Four, 18 U.S.C. § 3283, which.as amended in 2006,
authorizes 'the:-prosécution of certain. specific. crimés during “the, life of the child, or for ten years.
after. the offense, whichever is longer.” As a practical matter, this is tantamount to no:statute of.
limitation and. allows. for:substantial, abuse by the government, particularly in.a,case with, no

government's reasons'for the delay’must be weighed. against'the prejudicial effects of the delay
on the defendant. United States +. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 324 (1971). The showing, of*prejudice,
however, does not.end a preindictment delay, inquiry. because “proof of prejudice jis generally a
