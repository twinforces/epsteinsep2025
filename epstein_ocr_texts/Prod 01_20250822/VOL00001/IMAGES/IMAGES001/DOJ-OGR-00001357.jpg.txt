Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide an update regarding the
defendant’s conditions of confinement at the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pursuant to
the Court’s Order dated December 8, 2020. (Dkt. No. 92). Over the past two months, the
Government has had multiple communications with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendant’s
conditions of confinement. This update is based on information provided to the Government by
MDC legal counsel through those communications.

The defendant continues to receive more time to review discovery than any other inmate
at the MDC. Specifically, the defendant is permitted to review her discovery thirteen hours per
day, seven days per week. During the entirety of that time, the defendant has access to a desktop
computer provided by the MDC on which to review discovery. Additionally, pursuant to the
Court’s January 15, 2021 Order, the defendant also has access to a laptop computer provided by
the Government on which to review discovery for the full thirteen hours per day, seven days per
week. Also during those thirteen hours per day, the defendant may use the MDC desktop computer
to send and receive emails with her attorneys.

The defendant also has as much, if not more, time as any other MDC inmate to
communicate with her attorneys. Due to the elevated number of COVID-19 cases within the MDC,
in-person visits have been suspended since in or about December 2020. While in-person visits are
suspended, the defendant has had regular video-teleconference (“VTC”) calls with her counsel. In
particular, the defendant has VTC calls with her counsel every weekday for three hours per call.
If defense counsel requires additional time to speak with the defendant, counsel may request to
schedule an additional phone call on Saturdays as needed. All of these VTCs and telephone calls
take place in a room where the defendant is alone and where no MDC staff can hear her
communications with counsel.

The defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at
the MDC. All inmate mail is sent to the MDC’s mail room, where every piece of mail is processed
