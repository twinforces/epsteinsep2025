1 not do so. The Court ordered Doe 1's transcript released after

2 undertaking a particularized review of that transcript and

5 finding that the presumption of public access warranted

4 unsealing. Having received no normal objection from Does 1 or

5 2, the Court cannot discern a justification for continued

6 sealing of their names in this case's documents. Accordingly,

7 the names and identifying information for Does 1 and 2 should

8 be unsealed.

9 Additionally, Alan Dershowitz's name and information
10 identifying him may be unsealed. By his letter at docket entry
11 1138, he has requested that redactions of his name in these
12 materials be unsealed in all cases.

13 Finally, excerpts of any deposition testimony for
14 nonparty Does in the Court of Appeals that has already been
15 unsealed may be unsealed here also with redactions, if any,
16 ordered by the Court of Appeals.
17 For efficiency, I will not repeat this caveat as to
18 each document; I will only comment when it is not applicable.
19 Unless there is a specific comment, personal identifying
20 information for all nonparty Does should be redacted, with the
21 exception of Does 1 and 2, Professor Dershowitz, and in
22 deposition testimony already unsealed by the Court of Appeals.
23 The other names of Does and identifying information
24 will remain sealed until we move to particularized
25 consideration of those Does.
