time Io would have said -- and I will say it. now -- as you
pointed out, what I, said the other day at our conference 1s
that when we get to the bail issue, we're going to have
conversations dnd discussions that. sound like merits
discussions, and they aren't.

And .I very much. agree with you that the presumption of
innocence everybody has to bear in mind, although sometimes

it's a little difficult. when we have these Conversations to

separate them. out.

It's just fundamental that. Mr. Epstein 1s presumed to
be innocent. now and until such time, if it comes, that, a jury
or a court makés a determination of gifilt. So we dlways have
to remind ourselves of that, even though we're ‘having these
conversations that seem to touch on meritis discussions.

but. the board found a lével, 3. Then shé goés on to say: "I

seen the prosecutor's office do anything like this. JI have
never seen it."

So I read it today. It came up, and I thought, I'd
share it with dll of you. She's suggesting, although you're
making plausible legal arguments, that. there is really no

basis, at least. in her opinion, to reduce the level, from Level.

& to level 1.
