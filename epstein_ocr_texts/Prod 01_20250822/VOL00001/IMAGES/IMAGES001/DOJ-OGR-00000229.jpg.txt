Petitioner moved to dismiss the indictment, arguing
that the coconspirators clause of Epstein’s NPA, see p.
4, supra, barred her prosecution because she was
charged as Epstein’s coconspirator. Pet. App. 55a. The
district court denied the motion, finding that the NPA
bound only the Florida USAO. J/d. at 56a-58a. The court
further found that most of the charged offenses would
have fallen outside the scope of the NPA even if it had
applied to the New York USAO. See id. at 59a-60a.'

Petitioner was tried on the nonperjury counts in
2021, Gov’t C.A. Br. 2, and the jury found her guilty on
five counts, Pet. App. 39a. The district court entered
judgment on three of those counts, dismissed two on
multiplicity grounds, and sentenced petitioner to 240
months of imprisonment. /d. at 39a-41a.

3. The court of appeals affirmed. Pet. App. la-23a.
It rejected, among other claims, petitioner’s contention
that Epstein’s NPA barred her prosecution. Jd. at 8a-
12a. The court cited circuit precedent for the proposi-
tion that a “plea agreement binds only the office of the
United States Attorney for the district in which the plea
is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the agree-
ment contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. at 8a
(quoting United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d
Cir. 1985) (per curiam)). And here, the court found,
“(njo-thing in the text of the NPA or its negotiation his-
tory suggests that the NPA precluded USAO-SDNY
from prosecuting Maxwell” for the charged offenses.
Id. at 12a.

! The district court did not address whether the two counts that
were added between the first and second superseding indictments
would have fallen within the scope of the NPA. See D. Ct. Doc. 317,
at 2-5 (Aug. 18, 2021).
