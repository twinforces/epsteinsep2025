“bail statute does not . . . require that foreign defendants be detained simply because their

return cannot be guaranteed through extradition”);

e United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129 (D.D.C. 2004) (ordering release of
defendant, an Israeli national who had resided in South Africa for the 18 years preceding
his arrest when he landed in Colorado for a family ski trip based on allegations he
violated the Export Administration Act and the International Economic Emergency
Powers Act by acquiring products capable of triggering nuclear weapons and exported
them to Pakistan, despite defendant’s lack of any ties to the United States, despite finding
that defendant had “no ties to the United States or the Washington, D.C. area,” despite
finding that “no evidence [was] presented establishing that Defendant has ever lived in
this country, owned property here, or that he has any family or community ties in the
United States,” despite finding that defendant “was only in this country in order to
participate in a ski vacation with his wife and daughter,” and despite finding that “the
weight of the evidence against Defendant is substantial”);

e United States v. Hanson, 613 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C. 2009) (ordering release of
defendant, a naturalized citizen of the United States, despite finding defendant “thas
strong ties to [her home country of] China,” finding that the defendant owned property in
China, that the defendant spent almost all of her ten years of marriage living abroad with
her husband, that during 2008 the defendant spent only 22 days in the United States, that
the charges against the defendant (violations of International Emergency Economic
Powers Act and the Export Administration Regulations) “were serious and carried a
potential for a significant period of incarceration” and that the “government has strong
evidence against” the defendant “including her own statement to investigators that she
smuggled the UAV autopilot components out of the United States and knew there were
licensing requirements for such items”).

The fact that the government will potentially seek a significant sentence if Mr. Epstein is
convicted on all counts similarly does not preclude pretrial release in this case — several courts
have ordered pretrial release despite finding that the defendant faced serious charges carrying
significant potential sentences. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63 (reversing district court order of
detention despite finding that defendants, natives of Indonesia, faced “lengthy term of
incarceration” and “strong” evidence of guilt existed); Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129 (ordering
release of defendant, an Israeli national who had resided in South Africa for the 18 years
preceding his arrest, despite finding that “the weight of the evidence against Defendant is
substantial”); Hanson, 613 F. Supp. 2d 85 (noting that charges “were serious and carried a
potential for a significant period of incarceration” and that the “government has strong evidence
against” the defendant “including her own statement to investigators that she smuggled the UAV
autopilot components out of the United States and knew there were licensing requirements for
such items”). As the government concedes, the increases in sentencing exposure enacted after
