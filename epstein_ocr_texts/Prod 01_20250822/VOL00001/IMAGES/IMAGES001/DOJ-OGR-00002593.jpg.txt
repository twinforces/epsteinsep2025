Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 142 Filed 02/04/21 Page 21 of 38

Contrary to the government’s position here, courts applying these traditional, contract.
principles to non-prosecution agreements have recognized that third:parties who claim. immunity
in such agreements have standing, to enforce their rights as third-party beneficiaries, even where
they have not been expressly named in:the non-prosccution agreement. See, ¢.g., United States
. GEW Const. Co., 583 F. Supp. 197, 203 (D.S.C.) (“an:intendéd third party beneficiary of a
contract may enforceits provisions as against the. promisor wa ifthe Government, in.
negotiating the aforementioned plea agreements, ‘promised’ that there would’be no prosecution.
against.[the third party] for antitrust violations arising tn. aay jurisdiction, the promise: must. be.
enforced”) (emphasis ‘in original), aff'd, 749.F.2d 33 (4th Cir. 1984).

Two cases in particular illustrate the infirmity in. the government’s argument. In. United
States v. Florida West.Int’l Airways, Inc., 853 FE. Supp. 24.1209 (S.D. Fla. 2012), the
government, following a plea agreement with.a forcign, air cargo provider that immunized. certain,
classes of the provider’s employees. and related corporations, indicted.a U.S. airline and an
‘individual, both of whom asserted that they were within the scope of employces and corporations
covered by theplea agreement. /d. at-1215-16. Following a.two-day evidentiary hearing, the
court concluded that only the individual ‘was covered by the plea agreement, but flatly:rejected
the proposition that cither party lacked.standing to invoke the plea agreement if covered. by:it—
even. though the’ parties, were not identified in the plea‘agreement: by:name. /d. at 1228-29.
Applying Florida law, the court held that “the signatory partics unmistakably intended to: confer
immunity on.a discrete class of corporations and individuals . . . that could include the
Defendants.” /é. at.1228. The court added:

The plea agreement unquestionably conferred a.direct benefit on a class of

individuals: immunity. Morcover, the Plea Agreement evinced an, intent:to
extend this benefit: to a-definable class of third parties: employees of [the cargo
