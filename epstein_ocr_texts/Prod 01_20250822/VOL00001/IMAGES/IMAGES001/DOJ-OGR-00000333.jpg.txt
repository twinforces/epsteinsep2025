Indeed, ‘while the defendant has ‘still ‘not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty. of
‘perjury, in. connection ‘with his application ‘for bail, his token effort to, account: for his finances
makes: painfully clear the. need for detention. The defendant.reports having an extraordinary:
amount. of moncy «in both. total. asscts and. cash. or cash-cquivalent holdings. And. while the
defendant. repeatedly represents in, his Release ‘Motion, that his asscts are “in the United States,”
there is absolutely nothing in the: defendant’s minimal, financial submission to verify that:

Indeed, and.as discussed.further below, even:assuming the defendant’s assets are presently
in. the: United States, nothing in. the: proposed package ‘would. prevent the defendant from.
transferring liquid asscts out, of the country. quickly and ‘in anticipation of. flight: or relocation. The
defendant-is an, incredibly sophisticated financial ‘actor with decades of experience in the industry
and significant tics to financial institutions and. actors around the world. He could. casily transfer
finds, atid. Holdings, 6n.a:moment’s' to places’ Where. the Government ‘would. ricver ‘find them so as
to ensure-he could:live comfortably while a fugitive.

But;perhaps most important, even.were, the defendant to'saerifice /iferally all of.his current:
assets, there 1s every indication that he would, immediately be able ‘to resume making ‘millions or
tens of millions of dollars per year outside of ‘the, United. States. He. already cams at Icast’
$10,000,000. per yar, according to records from Institution- 1, while living in the U.S. ‘Virgin.
Islands, traveling, extensively abroad, and. residing in, part in‘Paris, France; there ‘would’be little to
stop the defendant from, fleeing, transferring’ x'his unknown asscts abroad, and then, continuing’ to do
whatever it: is he does to carn his vast.'wealth. from ‘a, computer: terminal beyond ‘the; reach of
extradition.4

That the defendant faces up to.45 ycars of incarecration on the current counts: with, which
he is. charged provides 'the motive for him,do so and. is another, significant ‘factor in ‘assessing ‘the
risk of flight. See United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d_4, 7 (2d:Cir. 1987). So too is the strength of
the evidence, detailed above..and :in the Government’s Detention Memo. Indeed, that evidence,
alrcady robust less than.a’weck ‘ago when the Indictment-was unsealed, is growing stronger by'the
day. Just. since the ‘Indictment was ‘unsealed, several additional. women, in multiple jurisdictions,
have identificd.themselves to the Government as having, been, victimized by: the defendant ‘when
they’ were minors. Morcover,. pursuant to judicially-authorized search warrants, the Government:
has discovered and, seized a significant volume of photographs of nude and seminude young
women and_girls in the defendant’s Manhattan: residence, and isin the process of reviewing dozens
‘of clectronic discs that contain still more such photos.” And dozens of individuals have called. the:
Government in recent days. to’ convey. information regarding the defendant. and the allegations

TAs noted.in. the: Government’ 's.Detention. Memo, the: defendant. is a frequent trayeler and. regularly

traveled toor from: a foreign, counity’si since © 20 i 8 sone. ‘Extensive international travel of this nature
further demonstrates ‘a-significant risk of flight. See, ¢.g:, United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp.
2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005).

* The Government’s review of these materials, scizced:carlier this weck, remains ongoing.
