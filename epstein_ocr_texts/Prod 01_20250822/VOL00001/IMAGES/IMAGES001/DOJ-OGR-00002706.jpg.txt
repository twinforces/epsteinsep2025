the government further advised that, to the extent it had access to an unredacted copy of the
report, it would produce it when it produces Gig/io material.

It is the government’s responsibility to obtain unredacted copies of these reports and
produce them to the defense. The government cannot absolve itself of its Brady obligations by
producing redacted documents “as is,” when they could easily obtain unredacted copies from the
FBI. See Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437 (1995) (the government “has a duty to learn of any
favorable evidence known to the others acting on the government’s behalf in the case, including
the police”). An informed witness who fails to mention the defendant when making a police
report is certainly exculpatory under Brady. United States v. Torres, 719 F.2d 549, 555-56 (2d
Cir. 1983); Jones v. Jago, 575 F.2d 1164, 1168 (6th Cir. 1978); Clemmons v. Delo, 124 F.3d
944, 952 (8"" Cir. 1997); White v. Helling, 194 F.3d 937, 944 (8 Cir. 1999).

The timing for Brady disclosures is now. As this Court ruled:

“The Government must disclose to the defense all information ‘favorable

to an accused’ that is “material either to guilt or to punishment’ and that is

known to the Government. . . . The Government shall disclose such

information to the defense promptly after its existence becomes known to

the Government so that the defense may make effective use of the

information in the preparation of its case.”
