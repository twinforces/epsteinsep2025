States:y. Johnson, 21 F.Supp. 2d 329, 334-35 (S.D:N-Y.. 1998); see. also United States v..Kenny,
883 F. Supp. 869, 874 (E.D.N.Y. 1995). The only geographic nexus in‘this case to this
District—Epstein’s New York residence—is:in the Manhattan Division,, andthe: case will be:
tried within, the Manhattan Division. The appropriate comparison.here is ‘therefore’ between the
Manhattan. Division and the qualified wheel. for’ White Plains.

Mr. Martin’s analysis found significant’underrepresentation. of both Black and Hispanic
persons in the White Plains qualified wheel when, compared.to the eligible juror population of
the Manhattan, Division. Mr. Martin found that the eligible juror population of the Manhattan
qualified wheel refilled in;February 201,7 (and thus ‘in, effect.in 2020) was 8.76% Black ‘and.
10.48% Hispanic, (id. 455). Thus, Mr. Martin found an “Absolute. Disparity” of 12.16%
underrepresentation for Black jurors (20.92% minus 8.76%) and.an “Absolute Disparity” of
17.58% for Hispanic jurors (28.06% minus 10.48%). Jd. $§61+62. Mr: Martin also ‘found.
significant underrepresentation.using:a “Comparative Disparity” analysis (id: f¥ 69-70), which
reflects a:cognizable group’s absolute disparity as a percentage of the population percentage of
that group, and a standard. deviation analysis (id. 9 74-75), which méasures.the statistical
significance ofa group’s‘underrepresentation.

Mr. Martin ‘further found that there would be: significant°underrepresentation even if the.
White Plains qualified:'wheel. were compared to the eligible juror population of the entire.
Southern ‘District. of New York. ‘For the whole ‘District, the eligible juror population is. 18.09%
Black and 23.41%, Hispanic. /d. § 19. Thus, when compared to the. whole District, an absolute

for Black jurors ‘and 12.93% for’Hispanic jurors. Jd. [§,'59-60.. As with:the comparison to the
