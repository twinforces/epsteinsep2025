requested—the defendant can make such arguments, and the Government can and will vigorously
oppose them, at the appropriate stage in this case.

Finally, to the extent the defendant contends that the relief requested is somehow necessary
to her ability to bring issues to the attention of other courts, the Defense Letter completely fails to
explain what legal argument she wishes to make in her Civil Cases based on the discovery
materials she has identified or what relevance those materials have to the litigation of the Civil
Cases. The fact that the Government issued grand jury subpoenas and obtained court authorization
for compliance with one of those subpoenas has no conceivable relevance to disputed issues in the
Civil Cases. To the extent the defendant argues that the requested relief is necessary to ensure that
courts adjudicating the Civil Cases are aware of the existence of the documents at issue, the
defendant identifies no specific reason why these materials are relevant to the issues pending in
those cases, other than to falsely accuse the Recipient and the Government of some sort of
malfeasance.°

In sum, the defendant’s arguments in favor of her application offer no explanation of the
relevant legal theory the materials would support, not to mention a compelling reason for this Court
to permit an end-run around the protective order and permit the use of criminal discovery to litigate
a civil case. Accordingly, the application in the Defense Letter should be denied.

Respectfully submitted,

° If anything, the Defense Letter suggests that the defendant intends to use criminal discovery
materials to attack the Government in the Civil Cases, attacks of no discernable relevance in those
cases and made in a forum in which the Government is not a party and would have no opportunity
to respond.
