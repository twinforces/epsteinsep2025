Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 100 Filed 12/18/20 Page 9 of 36

the Court concluded.that electronic monitoring and, home:sccurity guards “would be insufficient”
because: the défendant could remove:the monitor and. évade security guards. (Tr. 87-88). Finally,
the Court rejected the defense’s arguments about. the: risks of COVID-19 and the difficulty of
preparing a.dcfense with. an inearecrated client. ‘In so doing, the Court noted that. the defendant:
has no underlying conditions that place her at heightened. risk: of complications. from. COVID-19
and emphasized that the defendant had many months to‘prepare for trial. (Tr. 89-90).

Viewing all of these factors together; theCourt ordered. the defendant detained pending’
trial. (Tr. 91).

Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 31411 ct seq., federal courts are crpowered. to
order ‘a. defendant detained pending trial upon a. determination that the defendant. poses a:risk of
flight. 18 U.S.C: § 31.42(c¢). When seeking detention on this ground, “(t]he Government'’bears the
burden of proving by a:preponderarice. of the éviderice. both:that' the. defendant ‘presents an actual.
risk ‘of flight’ and that ‘no condition, or combination, of conditions could be imposed on the
defendant: that would reasonably assure his presence in. court.” Wnited States V..Boustani, 932
F.3d 79, 81 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting United States-v. Sabhani,.493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007)). The
Bail Reform Act lists three factors to be considered in the detention. analysis when the Government.
secks detention. based. on flight risk: (1) the nature and. circumstances of the crimes charged; (2)
the weight of the evidence against the person; and (3) the: history and. characteristics .of the
defendant, including the person’s “character ... [and] financial resources.” See 18 U.S.C. §
3142(g). Ifa judicial officer concludes. that “no condition or combination of conditions will,
reasonably assure the appearance of the:person.as required . ... such judicial officer'shall, order the

detention of the person before trial.” 18 U.S.C. § 3:142(c)(1)-
