JOSHUA ADAM SCHULTE, . :
é OPINION & ORDER
Defendant. :

Defendant Joshua Adam Schulte (“Defendant” or “Schulte”) is a former employee of the |
Central Intelligence Agency (“CIA”) who is charged with stealing national defense information |
from the CLA and transmitting it to Wikileaks. Schulte initially proceeded to trial in February
2020. The jury returned a guilty verdict on two counts, but failed to reach a unanimous verdict
on the national security charges. The Defendant moved for a mistrial with respect to those |
counts, which the Court granted.

Shortly after the first trial ended, New York City emerged as the global epicenter of the :
COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the majority of in-person proceedings throughout the
Southern District of New York were suspended. Grand juries and jury trials were no exception. |
Nevertheless, on June 8, 2020, the Government obtained a third superseding indictment (the ,
“Indictment”) in anticipation of a second trial. |

Schulte now moves to dismiss the Indictment on the grounds that the grand jury venire |
that returned the Indictment did not reflect a fair cross-section of the community, in violation of
the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, and the Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968 (“JSSA”), 28
U.S.C. § 1861 et seq. For the reasons set forth below, Schulte’s motion is DENIED.
