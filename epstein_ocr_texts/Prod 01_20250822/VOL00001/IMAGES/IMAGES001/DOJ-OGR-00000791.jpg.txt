18. US.C. § 3142(e). A Court does not need to ‘find both bases are proven‘to order a défendant’s

detention. Séé id.: United States v. Blanco, 570 F. App*x, 76, 78 (2d Cir. 2014). Dangerousness
means that;the defendant is a “danger to:the safety of aily other person orthe community.” 18
U.S.C. § 3142..A finding: of dangerousness must be supported by clear and convincing evidence.

See,e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540,542 (2d Cir. 1995). “Where there is, a' strong

probability that:a. person will commit additional crimes if réleased, the need. to protect the
community becomes sufficiently compelling ‘that detention is, on balance, appropriate.” United

States v. Chimurenga, 760. F.2d 400, 403.(2d Cir: 1985). “[E]ven a single incident of witness

tampering . . . [may be] sufficient to revoke bail.” Lak6ntaine, 2:10 F.3d at 134.

To order detention based upon risk of flight, the:Court must find’by ‘a preponderance of
the évidence, that “that no conditions could reasonably assure ‘the defendant's presence at trial.”
See. e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823..F.2d 4,5 (2d Cir. 1987); 18 U.S.C. § 3.142. “[T]he
constitutional limits on a.detention period’based on dangerousness to the community may’be
looser’ than the limits on a detention period based solely on risk of flight. In the ‘former case,
release risks injury-to othérs, while in the latter case. releasé risks. only the loss ofa conviction.”

United. States v. Millan, 4 F.3d.1038, 1048 (2d Cir, 1993) (quoting United States.v.Orena, 986

F.2d 628, 631.(2d Cir. 1993)).-A bail package that “may reasonably: assure the appearance of [the
defendant] at ‘trial will not [nécessarily] assure 'the safety ofthe community.” United States v:
Rodriguez, 950 F.2d 85, 89 (2d Cir. 1991).

The Bail Reform. Act sets forth the following four factors to be considered in the
release/remand analysis: (1) the nature and. circumstances of the ctime(s) charged; (2) the -weight
of the evidence against the person; (3) the history and.characteristics of the defendant, including

the person’s character and ‘financial ‘resources; and (4) the. seriousness. of the danger posed by the
