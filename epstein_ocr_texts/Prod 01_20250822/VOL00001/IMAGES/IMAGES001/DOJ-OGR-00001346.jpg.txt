original plan. (and. would reduce searching). Receipt. of the letter was acknowledged, but. to date
there ‘has ‘been’ no response and. little, if ‘any, redress to the most ‘serious conditions. Upon,
information and, belicf; decisions concerning Ms. Maxwell’s specialized detention are made by’
Warden, Tellez, or from-others outside the MDC. .A-report'from the MDC Légal Department'would.
provide second-hand. information. Accordingly, Warden Tellez should be: directed. to provide:a.
first-hand accounting: to the Court and counsel ‘why: Ms. Maxwell.:is being detained. under such
individualized, conditions.

‘Your consideration. is greatly appreciated.
Respectfully submitted,
