1 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
2 THE COURT: All right. Then I will set the schedule
3 as jointly proposed by counsel. To reiterate, I am setting --
4 let me ask, Ms. Moe, if we are going to proceed to trial, how
a long of a trial does the government anticipate?
6 MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government anticipates that
7 its case in chief would take no more than two weeks. But in
8 terms of the length of time to block out a trial date, in an
9 abundance of caution, in view of the need for jury selection
10 and the defense case, we would propose blocking three weeks for
11 trial.
12 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.
13 With that, I will adopt the schedule. I hereby set
14 trial to commence on July 12, 2021, with the following pretrial
15 schedule:
16 Initial nonelectronic disclosure generally, to include
17 search warrant applications and subpoena returns, to be due by
18 Friday, August 21, 20.
19 Completion of discovery, to include electronic
20 materials, to be due by Monday November 9, 2020.
2l Any initial pretrial defense motions, based on the
22 indictment or disclosure material and the like to be due by
23 Monday, December 21, 2020.
24 If any motions are filed, the government's response
25 due by Friday, January 22, 2021.
