III. This case is an ideal vehicle for resolving the
split over this important and recurring
question.

This case is especially worthy of review because it
cleanly presents the issue at hand, which is ripe for
this Court’s attention. In this case, the government
made a written promise that Epstein’s co-conspirators
would not be prosecuted by the United States, and
Maxwell was in fact prosecuted as a co-conspirator of
Epstein by the United States. The only question is
whether the government’s promise that the “United
States” would not prosecute her was enforceable
against the U.S. Attorney’s office in New York, or only
against the Southern District of Florida. The circuit
split on this issue is well developed and ripe for the
Court’s review.

CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, this Court should grant
the petition for certiorari.

Respectfully submitted,
