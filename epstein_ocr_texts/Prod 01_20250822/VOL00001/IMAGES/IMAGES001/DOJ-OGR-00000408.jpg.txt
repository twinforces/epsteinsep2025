14 would reasonably assure your presence in court and the safety
15 of the community.

16 You have the right to be represented by counsel during
17 all court proceedings, including this one, and during all

18 questioning by the authorities. If you cannot afford an

19 attorney, I will appoint one to represent you.
20 It is my understanding that you are being represented
21 by retained counsel. I want to advise you that the right to
22 the appointment of counsel is an ongoing right that you possess
23 throughout these proceedings. If at any time you are unable to
24 continue with retained counsel for financial reasons, you can
25 apply to the court at any time for the appointment of counsel.
