Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document126 Filed 01/25/21 Page 10 of 13
Manhattan Division, Mr. Martin found statistically significant underrepresentation using both the
comparative disparity and standard deviation analyses. /d. {| 67-68, 74-75.

To satisfy the third Duren element, a party need only establish that the
underrepresentation is due to the systematic exclusion of a cognizable group during the jury
selection processes—i.e., that the discrepancy is “inherent in the particular jury-selection process
utilized.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 366. Regardless of whether the White Plains qualified jury wheel
is compared to the eligible jury population of the Manhattan Division or to that of the entire
Southern District of New York, the primary reason for the significant underrepresentation of
Black and Hispanic jurors on the White Plains wheel is the choice to pursue an indictment from a
grand jury drawn from the White Plains Division, as opposed to the Manhattan Division or the
District as a whole. This decision resulted in the systematic exclusion of eligible jurors residing
in the southern counties of this District.

Moreover, Mr. Martin’s standard deviation analysis found that regardless of whether the
Manhattan Division or the entire District is used as the point of comparison, the percent of both
Black and Hispanic jurors in the White Plains jury wheel differs from that in the comparison
population by more than three standard deviations. Martin Decl. {fj 74-75. According to Mr.
Martin, if there is no systematic overrepresentation or underrepresentation of a distinctive group,
the divergence of demographics should exceed three deviations only approximately 0.5% of the
time. /d. § 73. Thus, the underrepresentations here are “not the result of random factors, chance,
or luck” but “the result of a systematic process that under represents” each group. /d. 9] 74-75.
See Jackman, 46 F.3d at 1248 (finding fair cross-section violation due to systematic exclusion of
residents from communities with large minority populations).
