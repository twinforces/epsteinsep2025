comparative. disparity and standarddeviation analyses. Jd. [4 67-68, 74-75.

To satisfy the third Duren element, a:party need only establish-that the:
underrepresentation.is due’ to the systematic exclusion, of a cognizable.group during ‘the jury
seléction procéssés—i.c., that thé discrépancy‘is “inherent in‘the-particular jury-sélection process
utilized.” Duren, 439 U.S, at 366. Regardless of whether the White Plains qualified jury wheel
is compared tothe eligible jury’population of the Manhattan Division-or to‘that.of the-entire
Southern District of New York, the primary reason for the significant underrepresentation of
Black and Hispanic-jurors on'the White Plains wheel is the choice to pursue an indictment from a
grand jury drawn. from.the. White: Plains ‘Division, as opposed to'the: Manhattan Division or, the
District.as a;whole., This decision-resulted in,the systematic: exclusion of eligible jurors residing
inthe southern counties of this District,

Moreover, Mr. Martin’s standard deviation analysis found that regardless of whether the
Manhattan.Division.or the:entire District.is used as the point of comparison, the percent of both
Black ‘and. Hispanic. jurors in the’ White Plains jury wheel differs from, that in the comparison
population. by:more-than three standard deviations. Martin Decl.'f¥ 74-75. According to Mr.
Martin, iftthere is no systematic overrepresentation or underrepresentation of a distinctive group,
the divergence of demographics, should exceed three deviations only approximately:0.5% of the
tine. /é. q 73. Thus, the undetrepresentations here-are “not the result of random factors, chance,
or luck” but “the result of a systematic process that under represents” each. group. Id. §{ 74-75.
See Jackman, 46 F.3d at. 1248 (finding fait cross-section violation. due to systematic exclusion of

residents from. communities ‘with large minority populations).
