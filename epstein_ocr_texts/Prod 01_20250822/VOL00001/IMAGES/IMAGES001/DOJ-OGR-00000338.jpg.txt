Honorable Richard M. Berman
United, States District. Judge:
July 12, 2019

Bruno, 89 F. Supp. 3d:425, 432 (E-D.N-Y.. 20.15) (“Even if Defendant; had the financial capacity’
to replicate: a private jail within his own home, this Court is not convinced ‘that such a set of
conditions. would be sufficiently effective in: this case to protect the community from Defendant,

‘or that such ‘disparate treatment based on wealth is permissible under ‘the Bail.Act.”)); Borodin,

1.36 F. Supp. 2d at 134 (E:D.N.Y. 2001) (Nickerson, J.) (“It is: contrary to underlying’principles of
detention and_release on bail that; individuals otherwise/ineligible for release should be:able to’buy.
their ‘way out. by constructing a private jail, policed by security guards not.trained or ‘ultimately
accountable-to the government, cvcn. if carefully selected.”).

If the defendant’s appearance’ can only be assured through use of round-the-clock guards,
the defendant belongs. in, a federal, detention ‘center, not released under bail conditions that.
effectively create a private prison of oné, using guards'to be paid by the defendant himself. It is
frankly outragcous for the defendant to suggest that preventing him from using his vast wealth to
duplicate: a private: prison that. cannot ‘control, monitor, and contain. him consistent with the
requirements of'the Bail,Act'would cause him to somchow “beara. special disadvantage.” ‘Release
Motion at; 12 n.9. Indeed: “What. more compelling case for ‘an. order of detention is there than a.
case in which only an armed guard and the threat of deadly force is sufficient to assure the
defendant’s appearance?” Zairah, 2016 WL 3681432, at'*12 (quoting United States v.. Valerio, 9
F. Supp. 3d at 295).

I. The-Defendant. Provides.No.Assurance He is.Not a Danger’ to the Community‘and a
Risk 'to Obstruct Justice.

A. Danger to the Community.

In. the first instance, the defendant’s. argument that 14 years without.a criminal conviction,
climinates “any danger presumption” should be réjected. Were: that, the casc—which ‘is certainly’
is:not—a lack..of criminal record for any: defendant. would automatically rebut the presumption.
applicable to crimes such. as:scx trafficking. That is manifestly incorrect. See United States v.
Artis, 607 F.. App’x 95, 97 (2d Cir, 2015) (finding that a defendant’s lack of criminal record ‘was
“not; so compelling as to defeat; the ‘presumption, or to manifest clear error in'the. district court’s
determination. that. no combination of rclease conditions . . . could ‘reasonably: assure against.
dangerousness and, the risk of: flight”). Morcover, ‘here, the defendant not. only has a. criminal.
record, but has. been convicted ofa sex crime. involving ‘a.minor.

But; the ongoing and, forward-looking danger ‘posed, by the defendant is further
demonstrated. by the defendant’s maintenance of,a. substantial collcction.of photographic: trophics
of his’ Victims’ atid. other young females .in his, mansion, as discovered by the Government'through.
‘its search warrants. As indicated in the Detention:Memo,, the many discs found:in the defendant’s
residence .included. those with hand-written labels including: the following: “Young [Name] +
[Name],” “Mise nudes 1,” and.“‘Girl. pics nude.” Not surprisingly, the Government, has found. that.
such discs contain photographs of scxually suggestive :photographs of fully- or partially-nude
females appearing to be underage.
