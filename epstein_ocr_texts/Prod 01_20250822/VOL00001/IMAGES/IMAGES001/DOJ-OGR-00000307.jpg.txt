Petitioners lack Article III standing and because the claims raised by Petitioners in these
proceedings are not constitutionally ripe.

1. The Claims Raised in the Petition Must Be Dismissed for Lack of Subject

Matter Jurisdiction Because the Petitioners Lack Standing to Bring Those Claims.

These proceedings pursuant to the CVRA must be dismissed for lack of subject matter
jurisdiction because Petitioners lack standing to pursue the remedies that they are seeking for
alleged CVRA violations. As the Supreme Court has explained,

to satisfy Article II’s standing requirements, a plaintiff must show (1) it has

suffered an “injury in fact” that is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or

imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the
challenged action of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely
speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.
Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 180-81
(2000); see also, e.g., Young Apartments, Inc. v. Town of Jupiter, 529 F.3d 1027, 1038 (11th Cir.
2008) (quoting Harris v. Evans, 20 F.3d 1118, 1121 (11th Cir. 1994) (en banc)). Moreover, “a
plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought.” Friends of the
Earth, 528 U.S. at 185.

Here, the record incontrovertibly demonstrates that Petitioners cannot satisfy the third
prong of the standing test, and the Petition and these proceedings must accordingly be dismissed
for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.” E.g., Florida Wildlife Federation, Inc. v. South Florida

court’s jurisdiction, a “trial court is free to weigh the evidence and satisfy itself as

to the existence of its power to hear the case” without presuming the truthfulness

of the plaintiff's allegations.

omitted); see also, e.g., McMaster v. United States, 177 F.3d 936, 940 (11th Cir. 1999) (“[W]e
determine whether this lawsuit survives the government’s factual attack [on subject matter
jurisdiction] by looking to matters outside the pleadings, and we do not accord any presumptive
truthfulness to the allegations in the complaint.”); Scarfo v. Ginsberg, 175 F.3d 957, 960-61
(11th Cir. 1999).
