Defendant.

For ‘the reasons set: forth, herein, the Government. respectfully ‘submits ‘that: Ghislaine
Maxwell, the defendant, poses an, extreme risk: of flight; that she will not be able to rebut’ the
statutory presumption. that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the
appearance of the defendant as required, 18. U.S.C. §3142(c)(3)(E); and that the Court: should
therefore order. her detained..

The charges in this case are ‘unquestionably serious: the Indictment alleges that. Ghislaine
Maxwell, in-partnership with Jeffrey Epstein, a.sérial sexual predator, exploited and.abused:young
girls for:years. As.a result of her disturbing and. callous conduct, Maxwell:now faces the very real.
prospect of serving many years in prison. ‘The strength of the Government’s evidence and, the
substantial prison term the defendant,would face. upon conviction all create a strong incentive for
the defendant to flee. That.risk: is only’ amplificd ‘by the defendant’s extensive international ties,
her citizenship in two forcign countries, her'wealth, and her lack’ of meaningful ties to the United.
States. In short, Maxwell has three passports, large sums of moncy,, extensive ‘international.
connections, and absolutely no reason to stay in, the United States and face the possibility of a.

lengthy ‘prison. sentence.
