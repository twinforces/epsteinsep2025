French law, is simply incorrect. Accordingly, the defendant’s foreign tics, wealth, and skill at.
avoiding detection continue to’'weigh. in favor of :detention.

First, there:can be: no scrious dispute that the defendant has forcign tics. She is a:citizen.
of three countries ‘and holds three passports. As was already noted at'the original hearing and. is
again evidenced iin, the Renewed, Bail Application, the. defendant has close. relatives and friends
who live abroad, aswell as a. multi-million dollar foreign property and at. least one: foreign, bank,
account. (Tr..83). In an.attemptito, minimize the defendant's forcign ties, the defense emphasizes
the defendant’s relatives-and friends.in the United States, history of residence in the United States,
and, United. States citizenship. But the Court was already aware of those factors when making its
original detention decision. (Seé Tr. 84; Dkt. 18 at 2, 12). The letters and documentation included,
in. the Renewed Bail Motion simply prove points that were not in dispute. ‘What. that.
documentation, docs..not do, however, is, suggest that the defendant;.has the kind. of tics to this
country that come with. any cmployment in. the United. States or any’ dependents living, here.
Indeed, as:noted.in the Pretrial Services‘Report, the defendant stated in July that she‘has no children,
and. has, no current employment. (Pretrial, Services Report at 3).

The Renewed Bail-Motion.fails:to establish sufficiently strong-tics to the United States that
would-prevent-her from flecing.. Although the defendant now claims‘her marriage’would keep her
‘in the United States, her motion does not address ‘the plainly inconsistent statements she made to
Pretrial Services .at'the time of her arrest, when, as documented. in the Pretrial Services Report, the:
defendant. said. she was “in the process of divorcing her husband.” (Jd.). On. this point, it bears
noting that'the. defendants motion. asks that she:be permitted to.live.with[ __] ifgranted bail,
not.her spouse. Morcover, the fact that the defendant’s spouse has only now come forward. to

support;the defendant should be afforded little weight given that he refused to come forward.at.the
