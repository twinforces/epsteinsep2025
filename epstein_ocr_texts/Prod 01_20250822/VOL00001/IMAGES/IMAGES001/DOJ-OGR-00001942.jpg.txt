1 litigation before your Honor about what is in the NPA, and the
2 government, we expect, is going to take the position that

3 unlike '07 is covered and nothing else. We disagree with that,
4 which we will lay out for your Honor. What do they do? They

a decide we will reach back and indict '94 to '97, totally

6 tactical, your Honor. So now we have a case where the conduct
7 is 25 years old, no tapes, no video, none of the sort of things
8 you would expect in that age of case, that we are going to have
9 to defend, and we are going to defend. And I think it goes to
10 the court's consideration of the weight in the context of the
11 only application that's before your Honor, which is how to

12 weigh the 3142 factors with the structure of the statute, with
13 the guidance of the Second Circuit and the Supreme Court, which
14 is in favor of bail, in favor of bail on appropriate

15 conditions.

16 So we submit that the package we laid out for the

17 court is sufficient that we are certainly willing if the court
18 deems it necessary to leave the proceeding open and we think we
19 could be back before the court within a week if that is what
20 the court wants or there is more detail which has been hammered
21 by the fact that our client has been, by design, by design,
22 kept in custody. And let me just give your Honor a little
23 flavor.
24 THE COURT: Wait, Mr. Cohen. I missed that last point
25 could you repeat it, please.
