Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Ghislaine Maxwell, Reg. No. 2879-509
Dear Judge Nathan:
This letter is written in response to your order dated December 2, 2020, concerning Ghislaine
Maxwell, Reg. 02879-509., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention center in Brooklyn,
New York. You expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement and well-being.
The Bureau of Prisons’ (BOP) policies and procedures are designed to ensure staff and inmates can
work and live in a safe and secure environment. In determining Ms. Maxwell’s current housing
assignment, MDC Brooklyn considered various factors including Ms. Maxwell’s expressed concern for
her safety and well-being amongst the general inmate population. We have discussed our decision with
Ms. Maxwell several times and provided her with guidance as to how to address any concerns through
her Unit Team or the BOP’s Administrative Remedy Program, 28 C.F.R. §§ 542.10 — 542.19. To date,
staff have addressed her complaints in accordance with BOP policies.
In her current assignment, Ms. Maxwell, like other inmates housed at MDC Brooklyn, is allowed
access to the common area of the housing unit from 7:00 AM through 8:00 PM, daily. She has access to
recreational space, social calls, television, shower, legal telephone calls, email, computers, and discovery
material. A discovery laptop is available to her from 8:00 AM through 5:00 PM. When Ms. Maxwell
returns to her cell at 8:00 PM, like other inmates she has access to drinking water, snacks she purchased
through the commissary, and discovery material. Since August 3, 2020, Ms. Maxwell has been able to
purchase items from the full commissary list. She recetves commissary every second week like all other
inmates.
