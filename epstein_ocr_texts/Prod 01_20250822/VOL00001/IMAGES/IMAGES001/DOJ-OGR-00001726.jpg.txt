The government reliés on two grounds:to justify its position: (i) the néed “to protect the
privacy of the alleged. victims,” and (ii) the: “lack of any legal precedent” granting such a
request. (Gov't Resp. at 4). Both.of these:reasons are unpersuasive..

AS to, the privacy interest, the government glosses over the facts and circumstances of this
case, which significantly diminish any privacy’ interest that may exist. As'we stated, in:our:initial
letter motion, many of Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims are actively litigating civil. suits against Ms.
Maxwell and have made public: statements identifying themselves by'name in. court proceedings,
to ‘the press, and in. other public ‘fora. Although we cannot ‘say for certain whether the three
individuals referenced in the indictment have done this—because.at-this point. we can only guess
who they are—it seems likely that:they, too, fall into this catégory. Furthermore, although these
individuals: claim to. have been minors when, the conduct, alleged I in the indictment occurred
the g voverninent ‘argued that these alleged victims would be subject. to ‘any: risk of intimidation, or
that they’ would likely refuse to appear, for ‘trial if their identities,were disclosed. Hence, any’
privacy interest that.'‘may exist is diminished and should. not.supersede Ms. Maxwell’s right to
prepare het defense to, ensure a fair trial. Sée United Statésv. Warme, No. 09CR1L9A, 2009 WL.
427111, at *2 (Ww. D. N ¥. Feb. 20, 2009) (ordering goverment to disclose identity: of alleged
identity to. ‘the defendant ‘would “subject the victim to a ‘significant ‘tisk, or to increase’ the
likelihood that victim: will refuse'to appear or testify, the interest of the defendant ‘in being able to
prepare a défense outweighs the governinent’s. intérest in keeping the name, of [the alleged.
victim] undisclosed.”).

The government’s assertion, that there is no legal precedent for Ms. Maxwell’s request. is
‘incorrect. (Gov’t,Resp. at.4).. The case law ‘in. this Circuit, is unambiguous that’ the Court has the
power'to grant the, requested relief. A's we statéd in. our initial letter, the Second Circuit. formally’
recognized ‘that. district courts have the authority to order ‘the disclosure .of ‘the: identities of
‘government witnesses in United States v. Cannone, 598 F.2d.296, 301. (2d Cir, 1.975). Although.
Cannone, itself, found that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the disclosure of
witness identities under the facts of that: case, the government. acknowledges that this ‘Court has
the authority under Cannoneé-to issue Such an-ordér in-this case. (Gov't Résp. at'2).

The defense. also cited. in its initial. letter United States v, Warme, a directly analogous
precedent in which, a. district: court in this Circuit relied on Cannone and its progeny-to order the
government: to disclose the identity of a rape victim, to: the. defendant, roughly. one.month after
indictment—theé exact. sane reliéf that Ms. Maxwell requests here. (Dkt. 38 at 3-4): In Warne,
thé defendant asked the:district court to ordér-the government.to disclose thé identity of:a victim.
who was allegedly raped by the defendant:a little over. two years before the indictment was filed,

someone if-you already: know-who that: ‘person is. Morcover, itraises the question, of why:the government is
unwilling:to go the extra step:and.simply:provide the: defense with. the actual’ birthdays.of the alleged victims.
