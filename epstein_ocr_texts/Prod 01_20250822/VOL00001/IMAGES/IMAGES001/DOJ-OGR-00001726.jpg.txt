The government relies on two grounds to justify its position: (1) the need “to protect the
privacy of the alleged victims,” and (ii) the “lack of any legal precedent” granting such a
request. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). Both of these reasons are unpersuasive.

As to the privacy interest, the government glosses over the facts and circumstances of this
case, which significantly diminish any privacy interest that may exist. As we stated in our initial
letter motion, many of Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims are actively litigating civil suits against Ms.
Maxwell and have made public statements identifying themselves by name in court proceedings,
to the press, and in other public fora. Although we cannot say for certain whether the three
individuals referenced in the indictment have done this—because at this point we can only guess
who they are—it seems likely that they, too, fall into this category. Furthermore, although these
individuals claim to have been minors when the conduct alleged in the indictment occurred
roughly 25 years ago, they are no longer minors; they are now adults in their early 40s. Nor has
the government argued that these alleged victims would be subject to any risk of intimidation or
that they would likely refuse to appear for trial if their identities were disclosed. Hence, any
privacy interest that may exist is diminished and should not supersede Ms. Maxwell’s right to
prepare her defense to ensure a fair trial. See United States v. Warme, No. 09CR19A, 2009 WL
427111, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 2009) (ordering government to disclose identity of alleged
rape victim and stating, “Inasmuch as the government has not demonstrated that disclosing the
identity to the defendant would subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the
likelihood that victim will refuse to appear or testify, the interest of the defendant in being able to
prepare a defense outweighs the government’s interest in keeping the name of [the alleged
victim] undisclosed.”’).

The government’s assertion that there is no legal precedent for Ms. Maxwell’s request is
incorrect. (Gov’t Resp. at 4). The case law in this Circuit is unambiguous that the Court has the
power to grant the requested relief. As we stated in our initial letter, the Second Circuit formally
recognized that district courts have the authority to order the disclosure of the identities of
government witnesses in United States v. Cannone, 598 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975). Although
Cannone, itself, found that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the disclosure of
witness identities under the facts of that case, the government acknowledges that this Court has
the authority under Cannone to issue such an order in this case. (Gov’t Resp. at 2).

The defense also cited in its initial letter United States v. Warme, a directly analogous
precedent in which a district court in this Circuit relied on Cannone and its progeny to order the
government to disclose the identity of a rape victim to the defendant roughly one month after
indictment—the exact same relief that Ms. Maxwell requests here. (Dkt. 38 at 3-4). In Warme,
the defendant asked the district court to order the government to disclose the identity of a victim
who was allegedly raped by the defendant a little over two years before the indictment was filed,
someone if you already know who that person is. Moreover, it raises the question of why the government is
unwilling to go the extra step and simply provide the defense with the actual birthdays of the alleged victims.
