Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 100: Filed 12/18/20 Page 28:of 36.

Setting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional. assets beyond those included in the.
financial report, the vast majority of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated:
with the defendant. (See'Def. Ex. O at 10). Based.on the report, it seers clear that the defendant
slowly funneled the majority of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five:
years. As a sesult, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the
defendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him
rather: than his ‘own independent assets. In other words, were the defendant to flee; she would.
largely be sacrificing her own money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion of her spouse
co-signing the bond. In sum, the deferidant’s submission does not change the Government’s:
position at the original bail hearing that the defendant has considerable financial resources, and
could live a.comfortable life as a fugitive.

The combination of all these factors, including the defendant’s foreign ties, demonstrated
ability: to. live in. hiding, and financial resources, confirm ‘that tlie defendant’s characteristics
continue to weigh in favor of detention. Given the multiplicity of factors supporting detention,
this is not one of the rare cases in which a private security company. could conceivably be
considered as.a bail condition. See United States v. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2019). The
Second Circuit has squarely held that “the Bail Reform. Act does not permit a two-tiered bail
system in which defendants of lesser means are detained pending ‘trial while wealthy defendants

are released to self-funded private jails,”'and that “a defendant may be released on such a condition

The
‘Court need not resolvé this question, however, because regardless of whether the defendants:
husband may have additional undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key takeaway. from the:
financial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed
bond is based, originated with the deféndant, meaning he would not be losing his own money if
the defendant fled.
