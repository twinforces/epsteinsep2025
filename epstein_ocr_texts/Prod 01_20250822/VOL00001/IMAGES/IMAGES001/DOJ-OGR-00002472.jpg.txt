1 a First Amendment right to access -- pursuant to the mandate

2 from the Court of Appeals. The Court observes, however, that

3 "the right of an accused to fundamental fairness in the jury

4 selection process" may be a countervailing interest that weighs

6 Here, however, the Court rejects Ms. Maxwell's

7 argument that the unsealing of any of the materials under

8 consideration today will jeopardize her right to a fair trial,
9 let alone sufficiently enough to overcome the presumption of

10 public access that attaches to these materials. Ms. Maxwell's
11 observation of the general media coverage of the unsealing

12 process does little to show how the unsealing of any specific
13 information at issue in the current round of unsealing will

14 jeopardize her right to a fair trial that is likely many months
15 away, or why this cannot be cured through the normal processes
16 in place for jury selection.

17 As a corollary to this countervailing interest, Ms.

18 Maxwell argues that the unsealing process should be put on hold
19 because the Court that is overseeing her criminal prosecution
20 has not yet determined whether these documents will be
21 considered admissible evidence or testimony at trial. The
22 Court finds that this argument is entitled to little weight at
28 this stage with respect to these specific documents. The
24 public's First Amendment right of access to these documents is
25 not outweighed by the prospective inadmissibility of certain of
