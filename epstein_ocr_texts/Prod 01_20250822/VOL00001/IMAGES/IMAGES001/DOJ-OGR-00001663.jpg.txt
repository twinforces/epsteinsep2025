Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter to request the opportunity to respond to
defense counsel’s letter motion seeking the entry of a protective order, which was filed this
morning. The Government and defense counsel were in discussions — as recently as 6 p.m. last
night — in the hopes of jointly proposing a protective order. Until seeing the filing on ECF this
morning, the Government had understood those discussions to be ongoing. In light of the
defense’s letter, however, the Government respectfully requests until 5 p.m. tomorrow to submit a
response.

Respectfully submitted,
AUDREY STRAUSS
Acting United States Attorney
