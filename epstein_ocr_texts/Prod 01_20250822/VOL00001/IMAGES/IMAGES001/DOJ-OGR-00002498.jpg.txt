1 the Court is not obliged to do the balancing test that the

2 Court has so carefully done today and previously. The fact

S that someone â€”-- there is going to be many reasons why a party
4 doesn't want to weigh in, and it doesn't absolve the Court and
5 the parties from the obligation of taking those steps, even if
6 it is a burden. That's part of the process here, Judge.

7 THE COURT: Anything else, counsel?

8 MS. WALSH: Christine Walsh from Holland & Knight, on
9 behalf of the Miami Herald.

10 We do agree with Ms. McCawley that the process seems
11 to be duplicative with regards to the Does who are not

12 responding that the Court will need to go back and revisit

13 documents that are being released piecemeal. And if there is
14 not objections, those should be considered at one time.

15 THE COURT: Anything else, counsel?

16 MS. McCAWLEY: Yes, your Honor. One more option for
17 you to consider, with Ms. Menninger raising the concern about
18 people who we didn't get a return receipt from. We can also
19 segregate out those for whom we did get a return receipt from,
20 meaning they received it, we got the return receipt, and they
21 did not object, so we would have that body. If that's a
22 concern for the Court, we could narrow it at least somewhat.
28 THE COURT: Anything else, counsel?
24 Thank you. Some of you have taken the words right out
25 of my mouth.
