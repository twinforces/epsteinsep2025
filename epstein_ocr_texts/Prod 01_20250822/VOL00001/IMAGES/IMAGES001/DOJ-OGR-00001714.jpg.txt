that wé, can. mount an efféctive défense investigation and adequatély prepare for trial. This is.
especially true inthis :case:where'the alleged. misconduct took place:on-unspecified dates roughly
25 years ago in. multiple locations—namely, ‘New York, Florida, New Mexico, and. the United
Kingdom—and, where’ the central ‘figure, Jeffrey Epstein, is alleged to have engaged. in,
misconduct with dozens, ifs not hundreds, of oer victims. The defense should ‘not have to

It is now almost six. weeks since Ms.-Maxwell’s arrest, and. the government is just now’
beginning to produce Rule 16 discovery, ‘despite confirming to the Court; that discovery would.
begin,‘as soon as the Court.entered a protective order. Moreover, the government still, has not:
confirined, to the, défense the identities,.of Victims 1-3. Ms. Maxwell ‘was, arréstéd on. July’ 2,
2020., On July:14, 2020, during her arraignment and bail hearing, the government indicated that
it had “begun. preparing an initial production” and-would be “prepared to produce a first batch. of
discovery: as. soon as a protective order [was] entered by the Court. vl The Court, entered. the
protective order on July: 30, 2020. (Dkt. 36).. The following day, July: 3:1, 2020, defense. counsel.
contacted the government and requested disclosure of ‘the identities of Victims 1-3. ‘The.
government refused ‘to do, so, stating that it would only disclose the identities of alleged victiins
through its ‘production of Rule 16 discovery, or as Part of i its Production of Jencks Act ‘material
load. the Rule 16 ‘discovery. "However, the government did not make its first production until
after 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday, August 5, 2020.

The government's initial production. was a subset of non-electronic discovery materials,
totaling nearly 13,000 pages, which, the. defense expeditiously ‘reviewed for high-level content.
Upon initial review, the materials contain certain records related. to one specific. individual.
However, nothing'in, the ‘production specifically. identifies this individual as Victim 1, 2, or'3.
The défense should not’ be réquired to speculate Whether this, individual is. one of thé 'three
alleged Victims, and if so, which. one. Moreover, the initial production does not. appear to
contain any materials identifying the other two alleged Victims. Although. the government has
indicated that it will provide additional discovery on a rolling ‘basis, if the initial production i is
any: guide, it seems unlikely. that later productions will sufficiently’ identify the remaining alleged.
Victims. Furthermore, ‘the defense should. not be forced to wait almost two additional ‘weeks

the defense’ s s ability’ to adequately investigate ‘ihe ‘charges against thee and. that investigation ‘will,
be significantly:impaired until we know forcertain the names of Victims. 1-3.
