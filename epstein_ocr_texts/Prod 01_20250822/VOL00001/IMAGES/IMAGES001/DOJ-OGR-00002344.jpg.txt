Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
On January 25, 2021, the Defendant filed twelve pre-trial motions. Four of those were
filed on the public docket, but the Defendant filed the other eight under temporary seal because
pending the Court’s resolution of her request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See
Dkt. No. 127. The Government responded that it did not oppose the Defendant’s proposed
redactions, but with respect to her motion to suppress under the Due Process Clause (Motion 3),
the Government requested a limited set of additional redactions in order to be consistent with the
other proposed redactions. Dkt. No. 128.
The Court will adopt the Defendant’s proposed redactions as to Motions 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 10,
and 11; as to Motion 3, the Court adopts the Defendant’s original redactions and the additional
redactions that the Government proposed. The Court’s reasoning is guided by the three-part test
articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.
2006). Under this test, the Court must: (1) determine whether the documents in question are
“Judicial documents;” (11) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the
materials; and (i11) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at
