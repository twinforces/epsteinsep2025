careful to note that it does not account for any possible income from inheritances. (Def. Ex. O at

The financial report further shows that the defendant apparently spent the last five years
moving the majority of her assets out of her name by funneling them through trusts to her spouse.
That pattern suggests the defendant has used the process of transferring assets as a means to hide
her true wealth. As the Renewed Bail Application points out, the defendant currently has
approximately $3.4 million worth of assets held in her own name, which is close to the amount of
wealth she told Pretrial Services she possessed in July 2020. Importantly, though, that number
omits the millions of dollars of assets that she has transferred from her name through trust accounts
to her spouse, including funds that were used to purchase the New Hampshire property where the
defendant was residing when she was arrested. This confirms that the Government was right to
be concerned that the defendant had refused to identify her spouse or his assets to Pretrial Services.
That practice further demonstrates the defendant’s sophistication in hiding her assets and
maintaining assets that are under her control in other names.

In this vein, the financial report suggests that the defendant originally brought more than
$20 million to her marriage, but that her husband brought only $200,000.? (See Def. Ex. O at 10).
8 On this score, it bears noting that that defendant told Pretrial Services that the property was owned
by a corporation, and that she was “just able to stay there.” (Pretrial Services Report at 2). The
defendant’s lack of candor does not inspire confidence that she can be trusted to comply with bail
conditions.

° The Government has not been able to verify this financial information—in part because the
defense has declined to provide the Government with the spouse’s current banking information—
