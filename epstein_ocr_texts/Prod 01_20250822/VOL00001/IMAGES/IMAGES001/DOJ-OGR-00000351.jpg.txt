harassed both [redacted] in connection to this attempt to delay their voluntary receipt of process
all in violation of 18 USC 1512(d)(1).”> Doe v. United States, 08 Civ. 80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkts.
361 at 3-4, 361-7 through 361-11. In addition to 18 U.S.C. § 1512(d), prosecutors also proposed
that the defendant could plead guilty to 18 U.S.C. § 403, that is, a knowing or intentional violation
of the privacy protection of child victims and child witnesses, to which the defendant’s then-
counsel replied: “Already thinking about the same statutes.” Jd. Dkt. 361-11. They also discussed
a possible obstruction plea that “could rely on the incident where Mr. Epstein’s private
investigators followed [redacted] father, forcing off the road.” /d. Dkt. 361-10.

The defendant’s apparent previous willingness to obstruct a federal investigation, harass or
tamper with witnesses, and hire private investigators that “forc/ed] off the road” the father of an
individual relevant in the investigation is alarming. It should especially weigh on the Court’s
consideration here because the defendant was apparently willing to take those steps before even
being charged and thus facing federal indictment; the incentive to interfere in the Government’s
case here, where an Indictment has been returned, is exponentially greater. And as discussed
above, the defendant has nearly limitless means to do so.

Finally, despite having been previously convicted of a sex offense involving an underage
victim, the defendant has continued to maintain a vast trove of lewd photographs of young-looking
women or girls in his Manhattan mansion. In a search of the New York Residence on the night of
his arrest, on July 6-7, 2019, pursuant to judicially-authorized warrants, law enforcement officers
discovered not only specific evidence consistent with victim recollections of the inside of the
mansion, further strengthening the evidence of the conduct charged in the Indictment, but also at
least hundreds—and perhaps thousands—of sexually suggestive photographs of fully- or partially-
nude females. While these items were only seized this weekend and are still being reviewed, some
of the nude or partially-nude photographs appear to be of underage girls, including at least one girl
who, according to her counsel, was underage at the time the relevant photographs were taken.
Additionally, some of the photographs referenced herein were discovered in a locked safe, in which
law enforcement officers also found compact discs with hand-written labels including the
following: “Young [Name] + [Name],” “Misc nudes 1,” and “Girl pics nude.” The defendant, a
registered sex offender, is not reformed, he is not chastened, he is not repentant;® rather, he is a
continuing danger to the community and an individual who faces devastating evidence supporting
deeply serious charges.
