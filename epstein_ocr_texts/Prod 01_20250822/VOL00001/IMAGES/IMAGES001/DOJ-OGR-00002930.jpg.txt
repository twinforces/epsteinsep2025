‘witnesses, ‘including: potential FRE 404(b) witnesses, and trial exhibits, the government’s
speculation about the length of the trial is entirely. one-sided and lacking in any. reliable estimate
of'a-defense case. The government’s April,12"" disclosure of information and ‘statements
regarding 226 witnesses containing cxculpatory information.requires intensive investigation.
The: delayed. expansion. of its. prosecution.and its unilateral. expansion. of the: length of trial
severely impaets defense preparation, trial, readiness, and conflicts with other trial commitments.

To assist'the Court and defense counsel, in accurately determining the length of trial, Ms.
‘Maxwell requests that the Court order the government to disclose: a list-of trial, witnesses, its
alleged FRE 404(b) evidence, and. a,listiof potential trial exhibits. ‘With this information, the:
Court and. the parties will be making decisions based on. facts, not speculative promises.

At the barest minimum, we require a.90-day. continuance. In:rclianee on the firm trial
date set by the Court at Ms. Maxwell’s arraignment on July 14", 2020, counsel-prioritized the
July 12, 2021 trial date, clearing and scheduling our calendars to avoid interference. Counsel
have other clients and, firm commitments to try:cases specifically scheduled to follow’the:
summer trial. ofthis case. These commitments make'us unavailable ‘from. September through
‘December, and possibly spill over into January, make trying'this case ‘unlikely, if‘not impossible,
before: mid-January. We are extremely. hard. pressed to request any: continuance, especially onc
which will prolong.Ms..Maxwell’s miserable and punishing detention, but.the need for time:to
properly prepare Ms. Maxwell’s defense as a-result of the additional charges requires us to:do'so,
causing Ms. Maxwell to'rcluctantly agrec'to this request.

In addition, ‘motion. hearings, ‘in.limine motion practice, and any Jitigation-regarding
expert: witnesses have not yet commenced, and issucs ‘regarding jury selection, including but not

limited:to a jury questionnaire, have not yet been settled. Yesterday, we met*with the
