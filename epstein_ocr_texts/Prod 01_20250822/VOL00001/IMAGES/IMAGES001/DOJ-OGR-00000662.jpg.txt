1 all due respect, we believe there is an inherent and central

2 role, a pivotal role in your Honor to find out what happened to
3 a defendant in a case before the court, whether or not the

4 court grants the nolle pros today or whether it holds it

5 pending an investigation into Mr. Epstein's death.

6 We're not here without significant doubts regarding

7 the conclusion of suicide. We are not here to say what

8 happened. We don't know what happened. But we deeply want to
9 know what happened to our client.

10 Thank you, sir.

11 THE COURT: And you, as Mr. Weingarten, have the same
12 view of the nolle prosequi motion?

13 MR. WEINBERG: Yes, your Honor.

14 THE COURT: OK.

15 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, may I respond to some of those
16 points?

17 THE COURT: Sure.

18 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.

19 Just briefly. With the exception of the noting that
20 the defense does not have an objection to the government's
21 motion, virtually everything else that defense counsel just
22 argued, respectfully is completely irrelevant to the purposes
23 of today's proceeding and to the motion that is pending before
24 your Honor.
25 As an initial matter, the question --
