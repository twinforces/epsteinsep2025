any such, issucs: as the discovery ‘process continues. To date, the defendant has ‘yet to ask: the
Government a.single substantive question about the discovery. The’ Government.is also prepared.
‘to engage in, good faith discussions with the defense about.an appropriate schedule for disclosure
of 3500 material, exhibit lists, atid witriess lists, all of which the Government éxpécts to produce:
reasonably in advance of the trial date in July 2021. to permit'the defense to investigate witnesses.
But particularly given the nature.of the charges, the Government’s strong, desire to protect: the
privacy of the alleged victims, and the lack.of‘any legal precedent for the defendant’s request, the
Government respectfully submits. that at the present. time—cleven, months prior to ‘trial, nearly
three months prior’ to, the Sevens deadline, and. r more - than four months prior to the pretrial

B. The Defendant’s Request-that:the Court ‘Dictate the Conditions of Her Confinement

The defendant’s requests: with. respect to the conditions: of her confinement. at. the:
Metropolitan:Detention Center (“MDC”) are similarly premature and. unavailing, and her request.
that the Court dictate the terms of her:confinement to the Bureau, of Prisons. (“BOP”) should. also
be denied.

As an initial matter, the defendant’s argumentthat she:is being treated “worse” than other
inmates jis:incorrect. There is ‘no merit to her complaints. about being monitored. by staff, as it is
entircly appropriate for BOP to carefully monitor any inmate, particularly anew ‘inmate who has
never before’ been inearcerated.and who faces the strong likclinood.of serving many ycars in prison.
Additionally, like all inmates, the defendant may be subject. to observation or searches of her
person or space as appropriate.” It is. otherwise entirely unclear what specific, “privileges, given to
other: ‘pretrial detainees” the defendant believes she is being denied. —

More generally, the defendant, like, all.‘pretrial inmates, is ‘subject; to an individualized.
assessment by the BOP with respect to his or hér placement. in a facility. Here, for reasons
including safety, sccurity, and ‘the. orderly functioning ‘of the facility, BOP has made the
determination. that, at: present, the defendant should not. be fully integrated into the dorm-style
accommodations of the general population. The Government understands from BOP that it will

‘from the Defense: Letter, and has,since conferred ‘with BOP to ‘understand and: to, address the issucs
as appropriate. Morcover, as'noted below, the: defendant filed the instant, challenge to the BOP’s
plan. to permit her. time: to review discovery: before the BOP had.a chance to implement (and
ultimately modify) that plan.

* Defense counsel claims that prison staff “constantly observe’ the defendant “including'‘her;phone
conversations with defense counsel.” ” This is misleading. AS with all inmates, the: defendant. Is

calls with their counsel, and then call other individuals on,a non-recorded line.
