consequences.” United States’ v. Sabuth, 990. F. Supp. 1007, 1018 (N-D. Ill. 1998), (quoting,
BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 1270 (6th ed.1990)).

As noted by Chief Judge McMahon in United States 'v.. Santiago, 987 F. Supp. 2d 465,
488-9] (S.D:N.Y. 2013), “[t]he Second Circuit has never specifically: declined to adopt-the:
Lovasco “Footnote 17° test (as restatéd:in. kight Thousand kight Hundred Fifty Dollars). Nor has
it specifically’ found that-pre-indictment delay engendered. in reckless disregard-of circumstances
that would likely impede 'a.dcfendant’s ability'to mountia defense can never violate the Due
Process Clause.”

Courts generally agree that (1) “tactical, reckless, or bad.faith preindictment delay that.
unduly prejudices a defendant is constitutionally dubious,” United States v. MéNeal, No. 03 CR
80, 2006 WL 760186, at *6.(N.D.-IIl. Mar. 20, 2006); and.(2) determinations of prejudicial
preindictment-dclay. are fact-specific inquirics.that; will turn,on ‘the unique circumstances of a
case. See Marion, 404 U.S. at 324-25: Lovasco, 431 US. at'7974

This is that case,

* Several Circuit Courts of Appeal interpret MarionéLovasco ‘as requiring a balancing test that
weighs the: prejudice io a defendant against’ the government's reasons for. the delay.. See, e: Bs, United
States»: Valentine, 783 F.2d 1413, 1416 (9th Cir. 1986): Howell ¥. Barker, 904 F.2d 889, 895 (4th Cir:
1990); United. States. v. Sowa, 84 F.3d. 447, 451 (7th. Cir. 1994); United Siates v: ‘Moran, 759 F.2d 777,

940 F.2d 646 (Ist Cir. 1991) (quotation omitted) (holding that a defendant may. show a due process
violation based, om excessive preindictment: delay. incurred in.reckless disregard of circumstances, ‘known
to the prosecution, Suggesting that there existed an, appreciable tisk, that-delay would impair'the, ability to

(recognizing reckless disregard:standard). Legal commentators have, for:many years, discussed the;
Circuit split regarding the'test to be applied to claims of’ pre-indictment delay and.called:for'the U.S.
Supreme Gourt'to:resolve the matter. See,.e.g., Phyllis Goldfarb, ® “When Judges Abandon Analogy: The
Problem of Delay:in Commencing Criminal Prosecutions,” 3 1 WM.& MARY.L. REV. '607 (1990); Eli.
