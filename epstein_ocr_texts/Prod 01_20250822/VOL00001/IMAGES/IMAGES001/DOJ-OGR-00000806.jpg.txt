his [unlawful] conduct, by .. . contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters.” |
Indictment § 4. These crimes, as already noted, carry a maximum sentence of 45 years of |
incarceration and give rise to a presumption of pre-trial remand. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (e)(3)(E); see |
United States v. Hardy, 2019 WL 2211210, at *10 (D.D.C. May 22, 2019) (“The significant |
harms and dangers of these crimes animated the Congress to create the statutory presumption of |
detention.”). The nature and circumstances of the crimes charged and the severity of the potential !
punishment support a finding that Defendant poses “a serious flight risk and that no conditions
can be set to reasonably assure his appearance for trial.” United States v. Cilins, 2013 WL
3802012, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 19, 2013). |

e Weight Of The Evidence |
The Government’s evidence against Mr. Epstein appears strong. The evidence includes |
testimony of victims, some of whom were minor girls when they were allegedly sexually abused |
by Mr. Epstein; other witnesses, including potential coconspirators; physical evidence, including
passports reflecting extensive foreign travel; sexually suggestive photographs of nude underage |
girls; plea discussions; and police reports describing witness tampering and intimidation. See,
e.g,, United States v. Fama, 2013 WL 2467985, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 7, 2013) (“the Court |
recognizes the difficulty inherent in assessing the Government's case before trial, and is mindful |
not to reach any conclusions about [the Defendant’s] guilt or innocence. Indeed, some courts
have described the weight of the evidence factor as the ‘least important’ of the § 3142(g) factors |
for these reasons.”’); see also Hir, 517 F.3d at 1090. |
e History And Characteristics Of The Defendant Including His Financial Resources

held plea discussions regarding witness tampering in Florida in 2008. He is a registered Level III |
