November 28, 2018, however, the Miami Herald
published an extensive investigative report about
state and federal criminal investigations initiated
more than 12 years earlier into allegations that
Epstein had coerced girls into engaging in sexual
activity with him at his Palm Beach estate.? The
Miami Herald reported that in 2007, Acosta entered
into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein in the form
of the NPA, which permitted Epstein to avoid federal
prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence
by pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution
charges.” According to the Miami Herald, the govern-
ment also immunized from prosecution Epstein’s co-
conspirators and concealed from Epstein’s victims the
terms of the NPA. Through its reporting, which
included interviews of eight victims and information
from publicly available documents, the newspaper
painted a portrait of federal and state prosecutors who
had ignored serious criminal conduct by a wealthy
man with powerful and politically connected friends by
granting him a “deal of a lifetime” that allowed him
both to escape significant punishment for his past
conduct and to continue his abuse of minors. The
Miami Herald report led to public outrage and media
scrutiny of the government’s actions.’
