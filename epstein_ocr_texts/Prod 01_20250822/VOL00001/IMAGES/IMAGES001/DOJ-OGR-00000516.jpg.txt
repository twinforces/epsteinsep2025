‘Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 6.of 74 6:
presumption ‘that bail will be granted. That is not. true with
respect. to the charges here.

The presumption of remand, as in this case, may be.
rebuttéd by the defénsé. And if it. is, thé government. has the

burden of proving that remand is nevertheless warranted.

Indeed, the government -bears this burden of persuasion
throughout.
The burden with respect to the safety of the community

is clear and convincing evidence, and the burden with respect

to risk of flight is preponderance of the evidence.
The defense argues that the presumption of remand is

rebutted here. And I refer to several places where they say

that, but one is at. page 6 and following of their letter.
application for release of Mr, Epstein.

So my question as relates to this burden and
presumption is| for the defense partictilarly, how was the burden
rebuttéd in this ¢cdsé which is sonéthing that they contend
they*ve been able to doa.

And my question for the government. is whether that

presumption Has been rebutted and, if so, how has the

government, been ablé to prove remand iS appropriaté, if it has.
So here is another question. Actually, I have a lot

of: questions. But the ones that are on top of my mind are

five. We have all the time in the ‘world. So if you have ‘more

quéstions, I'd be happy to havé thém answered.
