Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 _ Filed 07/24/19 Page 6 of 74 6

1 presumption that bail will be granted. That is not true with

2 respect to the charges here.

3 The presumption of remand, as in this case, may be

4 rebutted by the defense. And if it is, the government has the
5 burden of proving that remand is nevertheless warranted.

6 Indeed, the government bears this burden of persuasion

7 throughout.

8 The burden with respect to the safety of the community
9 is clear and convincing evidence, and the burden with respect
10 to risk of flight is preponderance of the evidence.

11 The defense argues that the presumption of remand is
12 rebutted here. And I refer to several places where they say

13 that, but one is at page 6 and following of their letter

14 application for release of Mr. Epstein.

15 So my question as relates to this burden and

16 presumption is for the defense particularly, how was the burden
17 rebutted in this case which is something that they contend

18 they've been able to do.

19 And my question for the government is whether that
20 presumption has been rebutted and, if so, how has the
21 government been able to prove remand is appropriate, if it has.
22 So here is another question. Actually, I have a lot
23 of questions. But the ones that are on top of my mind are
24 five. We have all the time in the world. So if you have more
25 questions, I'd be happy to have them answered.
