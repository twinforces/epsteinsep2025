1 MR. WEINGARTEN: The last thing we did today was

2 refuse to answer questions. What we said at Pretrial is heaven
i) forbid we make a mistake, and in terms of assets, we wanted to

14 the defendant is a threat to obstruct justice, the court needs
15 to take that into account. The allegations raised -- and I

16 just read them briefly because we just got the government's

17 letter -- relate to negotiations between the feds and the

18 defendant. Back when the Southern District of Florida was

19 attempting to find an appropriate remedy, there were
20 discussions going back and forth: Can we squeeze you into this
21 statute? And it didn't work, and it didn't work because there
22 is no factual basis. That is the reference to the alleged
23 obstruction. Not obstructive acts. Instead, the feds in
24 Florida agreed to the plea to the state offense because there
25 was no appropriate statute that covered conduct that was
