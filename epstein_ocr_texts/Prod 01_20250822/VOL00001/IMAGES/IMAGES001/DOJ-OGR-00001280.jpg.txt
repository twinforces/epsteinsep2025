of the government’s case and warrant granting bail on the conditions'proposed.” Def. Mot. at 7.
Those motioris. becamé ‘fully’ bricfed one’ week ago. arid. are, now pending. before this Court. The
Government strenuously contests cach of the motions and the:Court has not yet adjudicated
them. Without-prejudging the merits of any: of those pending motions, and ‘mindful, of the
presumption of innocence, the Court remains of the view. that in. light of the: proffered strength
and nature of the Government’s case, the weight of the evidence supports detention. See’Dec.
Op. at 9-10.

The Court’s assessment.of the Defendant’s-history:and characteristics has not.changed.
See'Dee. Op. at-10—-16. The Defendant continues to have, substantial international tics, familial
detection. Jd. at 10-1,1. And the Court’s concerns regarding’the Defendant’s lack of candor
regarding her asscts when she was first arrested have also stayed the same. A's the Court.
emphasized ‘in its denial of the second motion for release on. bail, the discrepancies: between the
information presented, to the Court and, to Pretrial Services in July.2020 and the information
‘presented. to the Court in December 2020 raised significant concerns about:candor. See Dec. Op.
at 16. There:remains considerable doubt as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide: by any sct.of
conditions of release. Jd. ‘While there continue to be certain mitigating circumstances cutting in,
the opposite direction, including:the. Defendant’s family tics in ‘the. United ‘States, these, do snot
‘overcome the:weight of the considerations that lean, in favor of continued detention.

As a result, none of the evidence or arguments:presented in. this third‘motion for bail alter
the Court’s assessment ofthe 18 U.S.C. §.3142(g) factors. While the fourth factor continues to

favor release, the first three factors and.the presumption. of detention all support the conclusion
