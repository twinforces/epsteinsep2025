11. According to the protocol, Ms. Maxwell was to move away from the windows, if possible, and
move into a safe room inside the house. This is normal protocol in these situations. A safe room
typically has water, food and communications. It is also able to be locked and barricaded from
the inside to ensure it gives enough time for a 911 call to be placed and the police to arrive
before exposure to the threat.

2 im reported to me immediately after Ghislaine Maxwellâ€™s arrest. He confirmed to me that
after radioing Ms. Maxwell, one or two vehicles pulled up and stopped near where | | was
standing. He was told to stop and move no further by a number of individuals who got out of
the vehicles. At that time, he could see that they were federal agents because they were wearing
FBI jackets and had weapons visible. The agents physically searched J and questioned
him.

13. | | was later taken to a vehicle where Ms. Maxwell was sitting. She asked him if he would
look after the dogs and the cat, which he agreed to do.

14. I understand that, as part of her renewed bail application, Ms. Maxwell is proposing a
substantial bail package that will include the following conditions, among others: (i) Ms.
Maxwell will surrender all of her travel documents, and (ii) she will be subject to home
confinement with electronic GPS monitoring. I also understand that, upon release, Ms.
Maxwell will be monitored 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by our security teams.

15. In light of the proposed bail package and the strict conditions of her confinement post-release,
as well as our long-standing relationship with Ms. Maxwell, my company will be posting a $1
million bond in support of her bail application.

16. I have never once posted a bond for a client in the past. I am happy to post a bond for Ms.
Maxwell in light of the factors discussed above and my relationship with her, because I am
confident that she will not try to flee.
