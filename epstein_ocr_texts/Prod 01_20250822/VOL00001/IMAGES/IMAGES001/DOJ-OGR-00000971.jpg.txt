Case: 26-4 BOBSHAUR DSeuMEeN IE Hied GPAB?720 Pagers of 260
2020 WL 3536277, at *4—5 (2d Cir. June 30, 2020). Although the presumption “remains a factor
to be considered” even after the defendant has met her burden of production, “[aJt all times. . .
the government retains the ultimate burden of persuasion by . . . a preponderance of the
evidence” that the defendant poses a flight risk that cannot be addressed by any bail conditions.
English, 629 F.3d at 319 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); see also United States
v. Deutsch, No. 18-CR-502 (FB), 2020 WL 3577398, at *5 (E.D.N.Y. July 1, 2020). And
regardless of the presence of the presumption or the nature of the charges alleged, “[n]othing in
this section [3142] shall be construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”
18 U.S.C. § 3142()); see also United States v. Crowell, No. 06-CR-291E(F), 2006 WL 3541736,
at *3 (W.D.N.Y. Dec. 7, 2006) (those charged with crimes involving minors “continue to enjoy
the presumption of innocence in setting conditions of release.”’).
B. Ms. Maxwell Has Rebutted the Presumption That She Poses a Flight

Risk. and the Government Has Not Carried Its Burden That No

Combination of Conditions Can Be Imposed To Reasonably Assure Her

Presence In Court

The government has not carried its burden of establishing that no set of conditions
will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court. As set forth below, Ms.
Maxwell’s personal history, her family and other ties to this country, and her conduct prior
to her arrest easily rebut the presumption that she presents a risk of flight. For these same
reasons, the government cannot establish that the strict bail conditions she proposes, which
are consistent with a number of cases in this Circuit in which courts have ordered release,
will not “reasonably assure” her presence in court. Accordingly, the Court should order Ms.
Maxwell released pursuant to her proposed conditions.
