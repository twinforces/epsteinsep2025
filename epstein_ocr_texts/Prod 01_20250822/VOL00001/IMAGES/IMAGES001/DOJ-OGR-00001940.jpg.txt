defendant, the less important it becomes to identify and
restrain each and every asset. over which defendants may

exercise some Control in order to mitigate risk of flight." So

if the court -- and we have suggested them, but they may be
modified by the court -- can ‘put in place stringent bail
conditions, we don't need to have a side-long, month-long
hearing about my client's dsseéts which is. just designed to keep
her in. detention. That was an. observation. by Judge Raggi in
SabHnani «

Judge, veny quickly on the nature and circumstances of

the offensé and the wéight of the evidence, we don't think,
your Honor, this is the place to litigate legal motions. This
1S a bail hearing. It is not the place to6 litigate complex
legal. questions that, we will be presenting to ‘your Honor. It's
very soon on the motid6n schedule, and we thank thé court for

agreeing to the schedule. But there ane a few things that are

worth pointing Out.

We believe there are very significant motions here

that will afféét whether this indiétmént survives at all 6r thé

shape of this indictment and, given the government's

representation that it is not. planning to supersede, will

affect the shape of the entire case, on any case at all that

proceeds before the court at trial, if there is a trial. That
is exactly what we submit, the court can consider, again, in

exercising its discretion as to the weight of the evidence.
