Ghislaine Maxwell moves under the Fourth Amendment, Martindell v. Int’! Tel. & Tel.
Corp., 594 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979), and the Fifth Amendment, to suppress all evidence the
government obtained from a grand jury subpoena it issued to [I and to
dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are the fruits of that unlawful subpoena.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Ms. Maxwell’s Motion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and Dismiss Counts 5
and 6 sets forth the facts relevant to this motion. Ms. Maxwell incorporates those facts by
reference here.

In summary, the government obtained MY file, including the
ee, by way of a grand jury subpoena enforced through an ex parte
proceeding befor lls
Ree. Although the government claimed not to know what was in
a file and that A had no role in instigating the investigation of
Maxwell, both of these representations to I were false.

In turn, the government issucd 31 i io thc
Ren. Sc Motion under the Due Process Clause to Suppress and
Dismiss Counts 5 and 6, Ex. C, at 3. The government could have been, but was not, more
targeted in its approach. The government has not provided Maxwell with a copy of the subpoena,
but the record shows that the subpoena was incredibly broad and, as explained below, ultimately
unlawful.

The subpoena violated the Fourth Amendment because it was overbroad and because it
effected a warrantless search and seizure of material in which Maxwell had a reasonable
expectation of privacy. Moreover, by securing a modification of the Protective Order through a
secret, ex parte proceeding, the government violated Martindell v. Int’l Tel. & Tel. Corp., 594
