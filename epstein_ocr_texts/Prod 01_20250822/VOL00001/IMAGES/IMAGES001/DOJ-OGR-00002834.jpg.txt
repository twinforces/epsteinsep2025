the Government had engaged in “prosecutorial gamesmanship” and forum shopping by seeking |
the Indictment from White Plains. Commonsense compels a contrary conclusion. |
Finally, Schulte cites United States v. Johnson, 21 F. Supp. 2d 329 (S.D.N.Y. 1998), for
the proposition that the relevant community is “widely understood to mean the ‘district or |
division where the trial will be held.’” Id. at 334-35, The differing facts in Johnson, however, |
make that case distinguishable from the case at bar. 3
In Johnson, the defendants moved to dismiss an indictment obtained from White Plains :

on the ground that the fair cross-section requirement had been violated. Id. at 333. In assessing

that claim, the Johnson court defined the relevant community as White Plains because that was
“where the trial [was] to be held.” Jd. at 335. The key fact there, however, was that the
defendants’ grand and petit juries were both drawn from White Plains, see id., which made it ,
only logical to conclude that the White Plains counties represented the relevant community. See
id. at 334-35. But the circumstances here are quite different; Schulte’s grand and petit juries
derive from different courthouses in the District. Accordingly, this factual distinction precludes

application of Johnson’s conclusion that the relevant community is “the district or division .

where the trial is to be held.” See 21 F. Supp.2d at 334-35. Schulte’s reliance on Johnson is

misplaced.

iii. Underrepresentation Analysis
Having determined the relevant jury venire and community, the underrepresentation

analysis itself is clear-cut. The “primary approach used in this Circuit” is the absolute disparity

method. Barnes, 520 F. Supp. 2d at 514 (examining case law); see Allen, 2021 WL 431458, at

7 Alternatively, even if Johnson is undistinguishable, the Court is bound to apply Bahna, which

bears directly on this case and is a holding of the Second Circuit.
