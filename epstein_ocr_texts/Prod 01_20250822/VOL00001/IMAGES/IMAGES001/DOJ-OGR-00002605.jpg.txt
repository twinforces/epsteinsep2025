acknowledged, by omission, that one of the three alleged victims referenced in the current
indictment was interviewed by the USAO for the SDFL. See Reply Mem. at 6 (“two of the
victims referenced in the Indictment were never approached or interviewed by the SDFL’”).

As noted above, Epstein and his counsel sought to prevent prosecution against his

of covered conduct—and even if it did, the conduct alleged here would be covered. At most, the
co-conspirator immunity provision is ambiguous, and thus must be construed against the
government. Because the co-conspirator immunity provision bars the government’s prosecution
of Ms. Maxwell on charges arising out of her alleged conspiracy with Epstein, the indictment
