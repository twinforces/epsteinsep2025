SOMAPI Report Highlights
Adult Sex Offender Recidivism

Observed recidivism rates of sex offenders are
underestimates of actual: reoffending.

Sex crimes:are oneiof the most undetrepérted crimes:
and are often unseen byanyéne. other'than.the vietim
and perpetrator. Low reporting levels make it‘extremely
difficult! to estimate actual sexual recidivism rates.
Additionally, only a small:portion of’sex. offenses:
reported to law enforcement'result in. the;offender‘s
arrest: Therefore,it's generally recognized that observed,
recidivism:rates are underestimates of thé true reoffense
tatés of. sex offenders:

‘Sex offender recidivism is difficult to ‘measure.
Recidivism rates are:néastifed differently fro ©
to the Hext, With different results. Studies differ in 1 how"
feeidivisim is defined (1.¢.,:rearrest vs.:reconviction), how
long:offenders are followed and what'types of offenders
are.included (i.¢., rapists vs. ‘child molesters).

Recidivism rates of sex offenders range from 5 percent
after 3 years to 24 percent after 15 years.

Relatively low rates are reported, in.studies using observed
sexual recidivism rates over follow- -up periods shorter
than S°years: For example; a :2003-study. (Langan, p.,
Schmitt; E., &’Durosé; M:; “Recidivism of:Sex Offenders
Réleased Erom Prison.in 1994,” Bureau, of Justice Statistics)
found @ sexual recidivism rate.of about 5-percent using a

3-year follow-up period for‘a large sample of'sex offenders:

released from’ ‘prison. Studies employing longer follow-up
periods consistently: report higher rates of recidivism. For
example, a:2004'study (Harris; A.J.8:, & Hanson,.R:K: “Sex
Offender Recidivism: A Simple: Question; Public Safety:
and: ‘Emergency Preparedness Canada) reported séxtial
recidivism rates of 20: ‘percent and 24: ‘percent for'a sample
OF Sex. Offeriders based on a 10- -VCar: and '15- year follow-up
period, respectively.

Sex. offendets —: regardless of type — have higher:
rates of general recidivism than sexual recidivism.
Recidivism. studies have consistently. found:that‘adult sex
offenders have much higher rates of general reoffending
than sexual reoffending. A 2004’study (Hanson, R.K., &
Morton- -BourgonaK,, “Predictors-of Sexual; Recidivism: An
Updated Meta-Analysis;” Public Saféty and Emergency’

sexual-recidivism.rate of 14, percent, based on follow-up:
‘protecting the public from‘sex' offender reoffense should

Measuring sex. offender recidivism is
difficult-due to underreporting and different
methods. used in research studies. Studies:
with.longer follow-up periods show that
recidivism increases over time. Furthermore,
different “types” of sex offenders have
different recidivism rates.

aiid found that sex offenders had an average overall.
recidivism.rate of 37:pereent compared to an average

periods of 5 to 6 years. This stiggests that policies aimed at
