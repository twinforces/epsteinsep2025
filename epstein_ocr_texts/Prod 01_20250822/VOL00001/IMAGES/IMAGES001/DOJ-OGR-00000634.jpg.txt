RELIEF REQUESTED .

Relator/ Intervenor requests seizure of the politically corrupt organization USDOJ:; associated
with abuses of prosecutorial discretion, fraud, and public corruption. Intervenor has witnessed the

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

e intervenor was a licensed engineer and bridge inspector for State of Washington. In 2012/2013,
intervenor filed a whistleblower complaint with the Washington State Auditor’s Office. The
complaint was escalated to Michael Horowitz's office of the Inspector General (OIG; See EXHIBIT A
Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration). OIG refused to investigate the
complaint. State of Washington fraudulently concealed that it secured funds for fixing the bridges
that Intervenor complained about, and misrepresented the safety issue. Intervenor later discovered
that State of Washington concealed this information so that “Democrats” and Republicans could
launder $70 billion to the Association of General Contractors (AGC) and the labor unions through |
intervenor’s attorneyz.

e On 12/27/19, Intervenor filed a False Claims complaint in the District Ct of Western WA under the
False Claims Act, seeking $1 billion in damages and qui tam bounty against “Democrats”,
Republicans, and his former attorneys for fraud (See EXHIBIT B Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby
attached by Declaration (first 2 pages only)).

e On5/1/13, USDO! submitted a fraudulent motion to dismiss intervenor’s claim (See EXHIBIT C Case
1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration), falsely stating that intervenor’s allegations
“lack sufficient factual and legal support.”

e 0On5/13/19, Intervenor filed a petition for quo warranto against Bill Barr and other USDOJ attorneys
for conspiracy, fraud, obstruction, and perjury (See EXHIBIT D Case 1:19-CR-00490-RMB hereby
attached by Declaration).

e On5/14/19, Intervenor had his False Claims complaint fraudulently dismissed by the District Ct.,
after fraud, perjury, and obstruction were proven against USDOJ (See EXHIBIT E Case 1:19-CR-
00490-RMB hereby attached by Declaration).
