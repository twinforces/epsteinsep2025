An even more loosely defined immunity agreement was enforced in favor of a third party
in United States v. El-Sadig, 133 F. Supp. 2d 600 (N.D. Ohio 2001). In E/-Sadig, the court held
that the defendant, who was alleged to have purchased firearms unlawfully for two members of
the Saudi royal family who had traveled with a Saudi prince to the United States, had standing to
enforce an oral agreement between the government and the prince not to prosecute any of the
individuals involved in the purchase. 133 F. Supp. 2d at 601. The court concluded that “even if
the non-prosecution agreement was never directly communicated to [the defendant], he can
enforce the non-prosecution agreement as a third party beneficiary.” Jd. at 608. Moreover, the
court reasoned, because the prince himself “was not involved in any of the illegal activity, his
efforts to obtain a commitment not to prosecute were obviously intended by him to benefit third-
parties,” and therefore the defendant was a third-party beneficiary with standing to enforce the
agreement. Jd. at 609.

Both Florida West and El-Sadig illustrate how the government’s argument that Ms.
Maxwell lacks standing to enforce the NPA is contrary to bedrock principles of contract law, as
applied to immunity agreements. Like Ms. Maxwell, the defendants in Florida West and El-
Sadig were not parties to the agreements at issue. Like Ms. Maxwell, the defendants were not
specifically named in the agreements. Yet in both cases, the courts held that the defendants were
third-party beneficiaries with standing to enforce the agreements, because the parties to the
agreements obviously intended to confer on them the benefit of immunity. Ms. Maxwell
similarly has standing to enforce the co-conspirator immunity provision of the NPA, as the
