An even-more loosely defined immunity: agreement was enforced in-favor ofa third-party
In, United States v. El-Sadig, 133 F. Supp. 2d 600 (N.D. Ohio 2001). In E/-Sadig, the court held.
that the defendant, who was alleged to: have purchased firearms unlawfully: for two. members of
the Saudi royal family who had-traveled with a Saudi prince to the United States, had standing to
enforce an oral agreement between the government and.the:prince. not to prosecute any of the.
‘individuals involved in the purchase. 133 F. Supp. 2d.at 601. The court:concluded. that “even if
the non-prosecution agreement was never directly communicated to [the defendant], he can
enforce the non-prosecution agreemenit.as a'third party beneficiary.” /d. at.608. Moreover, the
court. reasoned, because the prince himself “was not: involved in any of the illegal activity, his
efforts to obtain, a commitment not: to prosecute were obviously intended by him. to benefit third-

Sddig, were not partics to the agreements at issuc. Like Ms, Maxwell, the defendants, were not
specifically:named in the agreements, Yet in’both cases, the courts ‘held that the defendants were
third-party beneficiaries with, standing to enforce the agreements, because the parties to, the
agreements obviously:intended to. confer on them the bencfit-of:immunity. Ms. Maxwell

similarly has standing to enforce the co-conspirator immunity provision ‘of the NPA,,as the
