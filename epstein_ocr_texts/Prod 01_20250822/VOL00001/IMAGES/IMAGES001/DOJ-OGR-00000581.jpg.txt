Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36_ Filed 07/24/19 Page 71 of 74 cal

1 proceeding against him pending, but we had a case pending

2 against him at that time. And we were in the middle of

3 discovery, and we had situations in which we had witnesses who
4 were cooperating with us and then were contacted by either

5 Mr. Epstein or his lawyers and who then stopped cooperating

6 with us. So I thought the Court ought to have that piece of

7 information.

8 THE COURT: So that sort of supports the idea that

9 payments were made or at least the inference that one could

10 draw to keep people silent.

11 MR. BOIES: Yes. I don't personally know to whom they
12 were made, and I have been given no explanation as to why they
13 were made.

14 What I do know is that this was a time when we had

15 intensive evidence to take depositions and discovery and

16 interview present and former employees of Mr. Epstein.

17 We had experience where if we contacted somebody and
18 we actually had some conversations with them, then Mr. Epstein
19 would get them a lawyer, and they would stop cooperating. That
20 proceeding was still going on at the time that these payments
21 were made.
22 If I could just introduce you to Annie Farmer who is
28 one of our clients who would just like to speak very briefly to
24 the Court.
25 THE COURT: Sure.
