1 401-3. Excerpts from Detective Recarey's deposition.
2 These pages were released by the Second Circuit without

3 redactions.

4 401-4. Excerpts from the depositions of the Doe. We
5 are not up to that Doe yet. Remain sealed.

6 401-5. Excerpts from the deposition of Doe No. 1.

7 Unseal and redact only names and identifying information of

8 nonparties.

9 401-6. Excerpts of the deposition of a Doe. We are
10 not up to that Doe yet. So it shall remain sealed.

11 Counsel, may I ask you to proceed as you did last

12 time, confer, and prepare the documents for unsealing pursuant
13 to this order, and post the documents within a week on the

14 public docket. As before, give them an appropriate name, such
15 as documents ordered unsealed on January 19.

16 Counsel, are there any questions?

17 MS. MENNINGER: I have two housekeeping questions, I
18 think. I recognize your Honor just said one week. If it's

19 possible to ask for one week and one day. We have all of our
20 motions due in Ms. Maxwell's criminal case next Monday. And
21 the burden on my paralegal staff to get these redactions done
22 at the same time, one extra day would be very helpful.
23 THE COURT: If that's all you need, one day, that's
24 fine. If you need a couple more, confer with Ms. McCawley and
25 just let me know. Certainly you have the one day.
