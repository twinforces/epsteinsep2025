Re: USAvvs. Epstein, 1:19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Hon. Judge Berman:,

As a Suffering victim of Leste and his’ ¢o- COnSPHTALOTS. I would like to highlight some:

member of ihe DOJ «

One,.J'am not sure the highest:priority here is the victims, justice: forthe victims or
combatting child exploitation, or at least I do not {eel this way. If there was justice for the victims
we would sce: some.kind of accountability for the years, they allowed this horrible human being,
af youc can, call him. that, 16 pricy on underage > and young § girls While le jet- Setting ar wound the world
notorious private island. ‘And to make. mailers t more ‘Severe: e-continued io tralfic, rape and assault
victims while. on ‘prison. work- release and/or even atter’being a registered SEX: offender for about a
decade. Rather, I tecl. like: the DOJ’s and. FBI's priority::is protecting the “third-party”, the
wealthy-men, by focusing on, scrubbing their names.off the files of which, the victims, “know who
they are”. To learn’ that our own president: has ‘utilized thousands of agents, to protect his identity’
and these high-profile individuals is monumentally mind-blowing. That:is their focus? Wow!

Two, the fact that he “Killed himself” in prison Jeaves us all empty; without.answers,
Without resolution, with the ongoing conspiracy that: will never dic. | askimyself everyday, what
happened? Did he really “Kill. himself"? Is.he still alive? Where is he buried? Why didn’t we get
to sec his dead. body? This. all leaves. me fearful, angry and rightfully devastated and damaged.

Three, the. latest’ attention On. the “Epstcin E Files”, the “Client List" i8 OUT OF CONTROL

Why ‘the lack ofc concern wvin.handling such sensitive e infor mation. for the v vietims ssake?

Lappreciate your time ‘reading my short-thoughts and feeling and. my anxicty and.
frustration, is NOT aimed, at: you, obviously. It is. aimed. at the very government here, the ones,
asking to release these transcripts, exhibits, cte., of which ‘the victims are not-privy to while they
have-concluded that there is:nothing more. to sec-on the files they hold. Yet no one has seen. them,
but them. I am beside myself. .

I think What I Would-request from you, your honor, is to, consider having, an. approved.
third-party ‘review: these documents to ensure ‘that NO victims names or likenesses are revealed

through this. release. It;is imperative with the. scrutiny ‘over this ‘media ‘frenzy that the victims, are
completely and entirely protected.
