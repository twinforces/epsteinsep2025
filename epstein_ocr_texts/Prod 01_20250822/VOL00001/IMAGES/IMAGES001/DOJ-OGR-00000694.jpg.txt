MS. GIUFFRE: Good morning, your Honor.

THE COURT: Good morning. How are you?

MS. GIUFFRE: Okay. Thank you. My namé is Virginia

Reberts Giuffre, that's V-i-r-g-i-n-i-a, Roberts,

R-6-b-e6-r-t-s, Giuffre, G-i-u, dotible F, for Fred, -r-é.

I am a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
‘in, the dark and cruel dnd criminal acts they committed against
me and hundreds of ‘other girls and young women. for years and
years, and years, unstoppéed.

Thank. you. for allowing me to address the Court and
speak the truth. I commend the prosecutors from the Southern
District of New York for the ongoing investigation, and its
pursuit of justice for us victitis: It has given me hdépe, and I
will not, Let go of that hope.

When I was récruited by Ghislainé Maxwell at.
Marn-a-Lago, just before I, was 17, I thought I, was given a big
break, and I'd be ablé to resét my life and become an actual
real massage therapist. My hopes were quickly dashed, and my
dreams weré stolen. Jeffrey Epstein is no6 longer alive; but
this is not about how he died. This is about how he lived.

He will not Have, his day ih Court, but the reckoning
of accountability has begun, supported by the voices of these
brave. ahd beautiful wé6men ih this Courtrod6m téday. The
reckoning must. not end. It must continue. He did not det
alone and we; the victims, know that. We trust the government
