1 MS. GIUFFRE: Good morning, your Honor.
2 THE COURT: Good morning. How are you?
3 MS. GIUFFRE: Okay. Thank you. My name is Virginia
4 Roberts Giuffre, that's V-i-r-g-i-n-i-a, Roberts,
iy R-o-b-e-r-t-s, Giuffre, G-i-u, double F, for Fred, -r-e.
6 IT am a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell
7 in the dark and cruel and criminal acts they committed against
8 me and hundreds of other girls and young women for years and
9 years and years, unstopped.
10 Thank you for allowing me to address the Court and
11 speak the truth. I commend the prosecutors from the Southern
12 District of New York for the ongoing investigation and its
13 pursuit of justice for us victims. It has given me hope, and I
14 will not let go of that hope.
15 When I was recruited by Ghislaine Maxwell at
16 Mar-a-Lago, just before I was 17, I thought I was given a big
17 break, and I'd be able to reset my life and become an actual
18 real massage therapist. My hopes were quickly dashed, and my
19 dreams were stolen. Jeffrey Epstein is no longer alive, but
20 this is not about how he died. This is about how he lived.
21 He will not have his day in court, but the reckoning
22 of accountability has begun, supported by the voices of these
23 brave and beautiful women in this courtroom today. The
24 reckoning must not end. It must continue. He did not act
25 alone and we, the victims, know that. We trust the government
