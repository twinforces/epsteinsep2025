asked about. this alleged incident.

The investigators, certainly not authorized by
Mr. Epstein, to go and drive people off the road. There is
simply no proof ‘that he atithorized it! or wntil discovery knew

it. There was no charge against an investigator which I

contend there would be, given the intensity of this

investigation in Florida.

I see the claim. But if the state attorney believed that a
representative of Mr. Epstein drove a parent off the read, I

don't think that would be missing in the negotiations between

his new counsel.

attorney who I know well. Mr. Black has never been. asked about

it or told about it and does mot know the investigator.
Mr. Goldberger doesn't know the investigator. I have no ether

explandtion, other than it, doesn't risé to cledr and convincing

‘evidence.

that the government.'s language on page 11 ef their submission,

your Honor, is most, telling in terms of whéther thése wires
