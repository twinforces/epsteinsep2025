does not mean that those people would be unable to visit her were she to flee to another country.
In addition, the Defendant continues to lack any employment ties to the United States—another
factor weighing in favor of detention. Furthermore, it is apparent from the letters that the
Defendant has significant ties to family and friends abroad. In light of this, nothing in the
renewed motion for bail alters the Court’s fundamental conclusion that flight would not pose an

spouse’s assets and assets that had been transferred to trust accounts) and the representation that
the New Hampshire property was owned by a corporation and that she was “just able to stay
there.” See Pretrial Services Report at 2. The Defendant now claims that she “was detained at

her arrest... . For the reasons already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything

Defendant was unable to provide an exact number, however, the difference between the number
she originally reported to Pretrial Services and the number now presented to the Court in the
Macalvins report, a report on the Defendant’s finances prepared by a prominent accounting firm
for purposes of this motion, see Def. Mot., Ex. O, makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation
