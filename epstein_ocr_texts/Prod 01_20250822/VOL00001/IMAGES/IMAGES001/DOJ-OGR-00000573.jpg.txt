Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36- Filed 07/24/19 Page 63 of 74 63

1 districts were aware of it, which there is no evidence that

2 they were. The approval of jurisdiction to contemplate federal
3 charges and a federal NPA, as the defendant tried to wiggle out
4 of this agreement after it had been signed, is different from

5 having the NPA apply outside of the Southern District of

6 Florida which it does not.

7 What they're describing is a normal appeal process,

8 and there is an entirely separate process for getting coverage
9 outside of the relevant district, and what they're describing
10 ain't it. It didn't happen here.

11 Your Honor, the defense has kept coming back to this
12 idea of 1591 being enslavement, of pimping people out, of

13 people servicing individuals 15 to 20 times a day as they

14 mentioned in one of its submissions. Quintessential sex

15 trafficking is sex trafficking that is met by the elements of
16 the crime which we have here.

17 The defense said we don't have consent here or putting
18 the issue of consent aside. Your Honor, it's underage girls.
19 It's underage girls that are involved in this case, and it's
20 underage girls who are the victims. To say that consent is
21 some sort of a separate issue that we should ignore is
22 offensive, frankly, and it's not supported by the law.
28 Moving along, with respect to compliance following a
24 prior conviction rebutting the presumption, it's easy to figure
25 out why that's not the case, your Honor. I'll explain why.
