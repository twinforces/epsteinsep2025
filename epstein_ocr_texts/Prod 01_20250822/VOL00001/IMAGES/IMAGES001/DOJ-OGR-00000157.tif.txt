I. OVERVIEW OF FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The Palm Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD)
began investigating Jeffrey Epstein in 2005, after the
parents of a 14-year-old girl complained that Epstein
had paid her for a massage. Epstein was a multi-
millionaire financier with residences in Palm Beach,
New York City, and other United States and foreign
locations. The investigation led to the discovery that
Epstein used personal assistants to recruit girls to
provide massages to him, and in many instances, those
massages led to sexual activity. After the PBPD
brought the case to the State Attorney’s Office, a Palm
Beach County grand jury indicted Epstein, on July 19,
2006, for felony solicitation of prostitution in violation
of Florida Statute § 796.07. However, because the
PBPD Chief and the lead Detective were dissatisfied
with the State Attorney’s handling of the case and
believed that the state grand jury’s charge did not
address the totality of Epstein’s conduct, they referred
the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) in West Palm Beach for a possible federal
investigation.

The FBI brought the matter to an Assistant U.S.
Attorney (AUSA), who opened a file with her supervisor’s
approval and with the knowledge of then U.S. Attorney
R. Alexander Acosta. She worked with two FBI case
agents to develop a federal case against Epstein and,
in the course of the investigation, they discovered
additional victims. In May 2007, the AUSA submitted
to her supervisors a draft 60-count indictment outlining
