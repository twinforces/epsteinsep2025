the risk of flight she poses. When FBI agents arrived at the defendant’s remote property in New
Hampshire on the morning of July 2, 2020, they discovered the property was barred by a locked

noticed a cell phone wrapped in tin foil on top of a desk, a seemingly misguided effort to evade
detection, not by the press or public, which of course would have no ability to trace her phone or
intercept her communications, but by law enforcement.

purchased the New Hampshire property in cash. The guard informed the FBI that the defendant
had not left the property during his time working there, and that instead, the guard was sent to
