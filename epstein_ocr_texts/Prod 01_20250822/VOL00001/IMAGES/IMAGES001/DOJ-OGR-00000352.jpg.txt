CONCLUSION
As set forth above, in this case, the risk of flight in this case is extraordinarily real. The
defendant is extremely wealthy, has extensive foreign contacts, and is charged with serious
offenses that carry a potential statutory sentence of up to 45 years’ imprisonment—even a fraction
of which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his life in jail. In
sum, the defendant’s transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his extensive
international travel and ties outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his access to and
ownership of private planes, all provide the defendant with the motive and means to become a
successful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to have perpetrated—the abuse
dozens of underage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass,
intimidate and otherwise tamper with victims and other potential witnesses against him, render his
dangerousness readily apparent.
Accordingly, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant cannot and will not
be able to meet his burden of overcoming the strong presumption in favor of detention, that there
are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in this
case or protect the safety of the community, and that any application for bail should be denied.
Very truly yours,
