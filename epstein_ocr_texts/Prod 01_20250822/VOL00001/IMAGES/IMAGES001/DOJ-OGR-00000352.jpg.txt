CONCLUSION

As sct forth above, in. this case, the risk of flight in. this case is extraordinarily ‘real. “The
defendant. is extremely wealthy, has ‘cxtensive forcign contacts, and is charged with scrious
offenses that.carry a’potential statutory’sentence of up to 45 years’ imprisonment—ecven.a fraction
of which could result in the defendant, who is 66 years old, spending the rest of his.life: im jail. In,
sum. the defendant's transient lifestyle, his lack of family or community ties, his ¢xtensive
international travel, atid. tics outside the country, and his vast wealth, including his acess to atid,
ownership:of private: planes, all. provide the: defendant. with. the motive and means ‘to become: a
successful fugitive. Further, the nature of the offenses he is alleged to:have perpetrated—the abuse
dozens of undcrage, vulnerable girls—along with his demonstrated willingness to harass,
intimidate and othcrwisc tamper with:victims and other potential witnesses, against him, render his
dangerousness readily apparent.

Accordingly, the Government respectfully: submits that the defendant ‘cannot.and will not
be able to mect his burden of overcoming ‘the: strong presumption in ‘favor of detention, that there:
are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court procecdings i in, this
cas¢ Or protect the safety ofthe community, and that ary application for bail, should be denied.
