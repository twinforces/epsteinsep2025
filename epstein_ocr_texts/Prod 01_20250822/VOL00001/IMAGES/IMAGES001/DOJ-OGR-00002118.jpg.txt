3. If I am released on bail in connection with the Indictment, I hereby voluntarily
and irrevocably waive any rights to contest any extradition request by the United States under the
Treaty with respect to the offenses charged in the Indictment. Specifically, I consent to
extradition pursuant to Part 2 sections 127 and 128 of the Act in connection with the offenses

affidavit to assist in determining my extraditability.

5. I make this waiver freely and voluntarily, after having consulted with counsel.
