WILLIAM JULIE
‘AVOCAT A LA COUR:

subsidiarity of domestic law in relation to international instriments as stated by the
aforementioned law of 10.March 1927: the legislative provisions on extradition are applicable
only in the silence or in the absence of international conventions.””

It follows from. thé:provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure .that thie.
key question. is: whether France may extradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty
between the USA and France and/or under the Extradition Treaty between the European Union
and the USA, not whether France may extradite its citizens under French legislation.

As previously outlined, the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France. does not preclude
‘the French government from extraditing’a’ French national and must therefore be distinguished
from a number of other international agreements: signed by: France: which contain a. clear
prohibition. to: that extent. The Treaty between the USA and France’ gives the French
government discretion ‘as to whether or not to extradite its own citizens'to the USA.

It is noted that the letter of the.French Minister does not provide:any answer'on.this issue.
2 The DOJ Memorandum and the Peterson Case

Ini ‘support of its argunient that the: Fretich. government would not extradite Ms Ghislaine
‘Maxwell to the USA, the: government relies on the-case of Mr Hans Peterson, a dual. French
American citizen whose extradition to'the US was.denied by France.in 2007,

The. Peterson precedent should only be cited with. great:caution. First, T-am not awaré that:this
case has given rise: to a published judicial decision, therefore it:should not be interpreted as the
‘Support of any legal:rule or principle,.In. addition, in regards to the.documents that the DOJ has
referred to in its memorandum, I doubt that:a judicial decision has ever occurred in this case:
as mentioned by the 2007 letter of US Senators Richard J, Durbin and Barack Obama to: the
French, Minister of Foreign Affairs, the French Minister of Justice communicated its decision
refusing:extradition on August:22™ 2007, only a few days. after the suspect was arrested (at the.
beginning of August 2007). This decision is not. a Court decision but. a discretionary decision
‘from the French. Ministry of Justice. ‘It actually séems very. unlikely:that:a court ‘decision. could
have been rendered ‘in this timeframe. This indicates that; the case must not have been handed
onto the court by-the Ministry of Justice in the earliest stage of the extradition process.

A. refusal to extradite may possibly be ‘challenged by the requesting government before: the
French Conseil d’Etat, which 1s the French Supreme. Court for. administrative. matters, as for
example the United Kingdom: and Hong: Kong successfully challenged a. decision ‘from the
French authorities not to extradite an individual whose extradition they had requested (Conseil

d'Etat, 15 October1993, no. 142578). In'the Peterson case, the American government did not
