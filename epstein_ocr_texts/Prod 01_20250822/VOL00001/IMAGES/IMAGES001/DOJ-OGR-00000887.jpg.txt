statement might have occured ‘decades ago and. have: no. felewe ance to, the. charges i in

safeguarded, The. exception the: ‘Defense seeks is too broad and risks under mining the

‘protections ‘ofthe priv acy of witnesses and alleged victims 'that.is ‘required by law. In

contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to, publicly

reference individuals who have spoken, by: name on, the record in this case, ‘It/also

allows the Defensc'to ' 'referenc[e] the identities of individuals they’ believe:may: be
felevant!;. to. Potential Defense. Witnesses and their counsel diifing the course of the.

‘investigation and preparation of the defense case. at trial." Dkt. No, 33- 1,5. This
proposal adequately balances the-interests at stake. .And.as the Gov emment's: letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at.4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception.to the.
protective order ‘for a, specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the

Court on a case-by-case: basis., Second, ‘restrictions on the ability. of potential,

‘witnesses and. their counsel.to use:discov ery materials for purposes other than
‘preparing for trial. inthis case:are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented,

despite the fact'that'there have been many high-profile criminal, matters that had

related. civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions including Rule

6(c) of the Federal ‘Rules of Criminal Procedure, the:Priv acy'Act of 1974, and other

‘policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all.of which the Court expeets.the Government to scrupulously

follow. Furthermore, ‘the Gover nment-indicates that it will likely only: provide potential.
witnesses with:materials that those-witnesses already have-in. their possession. See Dkt.

No. 33 at 6. Aid ofcourse, those/witnesses who do 'téstify'at trial Wwould.bé subject to

examination on the record as to what’materials were. ‘provided-or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing ‘in the-Defense!s papers explains how ‘its unprecedented

‘proposed restriction. is somehow: necessary: to ensure a fair-trial. For the foregoing
+easons, the Court, adopts the:Government's: proposed protective order, which will be

entered on the docket. 'This resolves ‘Dkt:No. 29.'SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge
