Turning to several specific points, your Honor, that I
would like to respond to. I want to address the notion that
the defendant ‘would havé Surréndéeréd if thé government had

asked her to. As defense counsel conceded, no offer along

those lines was 6ver mdde. And of Golirse the government
deesn't have to accept the defense counsel's representation
that? their client would surrender.

In fact, the fact that the government took these
measures to arrest the défendant reflects how seriously the
government. takes the risk of the defendant of flight. Why on
earth would the government notify the defendant through her
counsel that she was about to be indicted and arrested if ‘the
government. had 5é6rious concerns that she was a risk of flight?
That 1s exactly what. eccurzed here.

In addition, it is interesting that defense Counsel
notes that. it should have been, obvieus to ‘the government, that

the défendant would have surrendered when, at the same time, in

eivil litigation in this district, defense counsel declined, to

accept, 5ervicé On behalf Sf plaintiffs whdé were seeking td sue

the defendant in connection with some of these allegations, and

they were required to, seek leave Of tHe Cdéurt to serve the
defendant through ‘thein counsel.

Your Honor; turning to the question of the defendant's
finances there is still at this point, no substantive response.
