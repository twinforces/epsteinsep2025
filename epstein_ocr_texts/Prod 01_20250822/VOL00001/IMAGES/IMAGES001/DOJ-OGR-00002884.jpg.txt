United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell

Dear Judge Nathan:

This. weck’s filing of the second superseding: indictment presents. new and ‘complicating
issues. In.addition to expanding.a three-year. conspiracy to 10. ycars, the government has. added
two’serious charges that drastically change the focus of this. case. That the government, has made’
this move late in the game with trial, sct for July 12!"—is obvious taetical gamesmanship.
Adding charges that were never launched. against Jeffrey Epstein based on evidence that was in
the government’s possession. for’ycars is shocking, unfait, and.an abuse.of power. More. than
doubling the time period. of the originally charged conspiracy from 1.994 to,.2004 (previously
1997) and alleging two.distinetly: different: substantive counts requires: additional Investigation;,
requests ‘for ‘additional. discovery; the need to supplement pretrial motions that have ‘fully’ briefed
and are pending before the Court; and ‘the drafting and filing of additional motions pertinent to
the new indictment. Accordingly, a ticw bricfing schedule :is required.

Even.more concerning | is the impact this late- ‘breaking, filing has on. Ms. Maxwell’s
constitutional. rights. Her liberty interests now clash, with‘her right to effective assistance of
counscl. The Court:is aware of the cxtraordinary circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s detention, its
‘deleterious effect on her health and well-being, and the realistic: concern whether she will be:
strong cnough.to withstand the stress‘of trial.

Counscl have ‘not yet determined whether to formally. move fora, continuance. This
decision. isnot an,casy one. Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers have'been diligently preparing for
trial. However, the government’s continued refusal to, provide the most. basic: discovery —names
‘of accusers — coupled with. what amounts to.a new indictment (aftcr What Was supposed to be. the
close: of discovery. and the resolution. of: very complicated legal issucs).has. effectively prevented
trial preparation from, moving ‘forward in an, orderly manner., Accordingly, 'we have requested
an, opportunity to confer with government:counsel with the g goal: of clarifying the neeessity of
moving the trial date.
