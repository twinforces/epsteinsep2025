Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 192 Filed 03/31/21 Page 2 of 3
LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA
To be clear, any such request will not be made from any desire of Ms. Maxwell to delay
her trial but rests squarely on the government’s late, tactical, expansion of this prosecution.
At the initial appearance on July 14, 2020, the defense agreed to the July 12" trial date
based on the government’s representation that is would not file a superseding indictment:
The trial schedule that we are agreeing to, of course subject to the court's
approval, assumes there will be no substantive superseding indictment. If there is
one, which the government has advised us they don't believe is imminent or I
assume not at all, we might have to come back to the court to address not just trial
schedule but other schedule as well.

July 14, 2020 Transcript at 16 -17 (emphasis added).

In response, the Court made the following inquiry:

Let me go ahead and ask, Ms. Moe, Mr. Cohen has made a representation but I
will ask if you do anticipate at this time filing any further superseding indictments
adding either defendants or additional charges?

Id. at 17.

The government confirmed:

MS. MOE: Your Honor, our investigation remains ongoing, but at this point we
do not currently anticipate seeking a superseding indictment.
Id.

Based on that representation, Ms. Maxwell accepted a July 12, 2021 trial date and her
lawyers planned accordingly, postponing trials in other cases to preserve this high-priority date.
It was only after considerable judicial and defense resources were expended that the government
belatedly superseded, again, with no justifiable reason given the age of these allegations. The
timing suggests that the decision to supersede was prompted by the filing of defense pretrial
motions and government concern about the now-apparent weakness of its case. The government
may be entitled to supersede but not when its decision disrupts the schedule set by the Court and
relied on by Ms. Maxwell. This delay has a prejudicial effect on counsel’s readiness for trial and
Ms. Maxwell’s prolonged detention.

This is no longer the “two-week” trial as represented by the government. By adding
charges that encompass dozens of additional witnesses, the government has unilaterally
destroyed the possibility that this case can be completed in the time allotted. The continual media
attention this case garners, in addition to podcasts, documentaries, books and the like, will likely
require the bulk of that time to seat a fair and impartial jury, provided that constitutional right
can be guaranteed.
