It means recognizing that when the parties intended
to mean “only in the Southern District of Florida,”
they said so explicitly, and that their use of the
all-encompassing term “the United States” in the
co-conspirator clause was purposeful.

The government’s invocation of “context” and the
purported purpose of the NPA is no more persuasive.
The government suggests that a broad grant of
immunity cannot have been made because there
was no consultation with the Southern District of
New York. Opp.10. The record does not permit such a
conclusion, as the district court denied a hearing and
the Petitioner was not granted any discovery, so there
is no way to confirm who was consulted. But the record
is clear in any event that the NPA was signed on behalf
of the United States Attorney for the Southern District
of Florida, who was heavily involved in the negotiation
and approval process. In addition, representatives of
the Department of Justice were also actively involved
in the drafting and approval process, including the
Chief of the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section
and the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General
for the Department’s Criminal Division. OPR:27, 28, 84.

If these officials failed to do what their internal
policy suggested was appropriate, it is irrelevant. The
provision in the U.S. Attorneys’ Manual advising U.S.
Attorneys not to bind other districts was relevant in
OPR’s review of the government attorneys’ actions
in this case. It does not inform the outcome here,
however, despite the government’s heavy reliance on it
agreements to limit their scope when that is what they intend,
and the burden is on them to be specific. When they decline to use
simple narrowing terms, this Court should make clear that the
broad language they use will be given its ordinary meaning.
