presumably in an effort to circumvent the time frame
covered by the NPA.

On March 29, 2021, the government added in its
superseding indictment an alleged sex trafficking
offense (Count Six) related to conduct and offenses
wholly within the timeframe and subject matter cov-
ered by the NPA. The sole complainant to the allega-
tions in Count Six had been presented to the Grand
Jury in the Southern District of Florida and her
evidence formed the basis of a conspiracy charge and
a sex trafficking charge in a proposed indictment of
Epstein that was dropped pursuant to the terms of
the NPA. Thus, the complainant’s allegations were
part of those for which Epstein pleaded guilty and
paid restitution, in exchange (in part) for his co-
conspirators to be immune from prosecution.

Maxwell moved to dismiss based on the express
plain language of the NPA which precluded charges by
the United States against any co-conspirator of
Epstein:

In consideration of Epstein’s agreement to
plead guilty and to provide compensation
in the manner described above, if Epstein
successfully fulfills all the terms and condi-
tions of this agreement, the United States also
agrees that it will not institute any criminal
charges against any potential co-conspirators
of Epstein, including but not limited to
[four named individuals]...
(App.30-31) (emphasis added). Alternatively, Maxwell
sought discovery and a hearing to establish affirma-
tive evidence of intent to bind the United States as a
whole.
