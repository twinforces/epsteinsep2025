The Court’s request for updates concerning Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement
does little to improve her situation. Quite the contrary. The government’s update letters are
anything but helpful: They fuel media attention which resounds to Ms. Maxwell’s detriment. The
government’s attempt to publicly embarrass and humiliate Ms. Maxwell in the hostile court of
public opinion further erodes the likelihood that her case will be tried by a fair and impartial jury.
The government’s review of the MDC may be Yelp-worthy, but it does not justify Ms.
Maxwell’s inappropriate detention. If the government wants to compare Ms. Maxwell to other
defendants, it should do the right thing and consent to bail.

It is debatable whether the public has a “right to know” about Ms. Maxwell’s conditions
of confinement, but clearly, it does not extend to personal and medical information. The
government safeguards personal information regarding its witnesses and is reluctant to release
any unless mandated by statute or court order. Yet the government fails to accord Ms. Maxwell
the same treatment.

Should the Court request further updates from the government, we request that they be
limited to changed circumstances and filed under seal or subject to appropriate redaction.

Very truly yours,
BOBBI C. STERNHEIM
