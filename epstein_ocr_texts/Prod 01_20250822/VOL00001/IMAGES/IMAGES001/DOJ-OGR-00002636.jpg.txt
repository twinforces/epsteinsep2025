investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice:? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations

of misconduct against. Department law enforcement agents when they rélate:‘to a, Department
attorney’s. alleged professional misconduct:

In its investigations,.OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs
the. challenged. conduct.and whether a subject attomey -violated. that standard., Departinent
attorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in.the’performance of
their duties, including the Constitution, statutes, ‘standards of conduct imposed by attorney
licensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR. finds misconduct when it
concludes. by a. preponderance of the evidence: that a subject attorney violated such a standard
intentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to'OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR.conchides that
(1) no-elear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in, question or (2):the subject did not
intentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs-the.conduct, then:it concludes that the
subject’s conduct does not:constitite professional misconduct. In some:cases, OPR may-conclude’
that a subject: attorney’s: conduct. does not satisfy the elements necessary fora professional.
misconduct finding, but that the circunistarices warrant another finding, In such cases, OPR may

conclude that a subject: attorney. exercised poor. judgment,. made_a mistake, or otherwise acted.
inappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subjéct attorney’s:
conduct was. appropriate under the circumstances. !"

TV. ISSUES CONSIDERED

In. this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations, The first relates to:
the negotiation, execution, ‘and implementation of the NPA. The’ second relates to the USAQ’s:
interactions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The:two sets:
of issues:are described below and:are analyzed separately in this Report.

A. The Negotiation, Execcution,.and Implementation of the NPA

In ‘evaluating whether any of the subjects committed -professional. misconduct; OPR
‘considered whether any of. the NPA’s provisions: violated a clear or unambiguous statute,
professional responsibility rule or standard,:or Department regulation:or policy. In particular, OPR.
‘considered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (1) charging decisions, (2) declination.
of criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants.
9. 28 CPR. § 0: 39a(a)(1). OPR has authority to investigate the. professional conduét of dttomeys occurring
during their employment by the Departrnent; regardless, of whether the attorney léft the Department before or during:

OPR2S. investigation. -Over its, 45-year “history, OPR has routinely investigated thé conduct’ of ‘former Department:
attorneys. ‘Although forrier. Department attor neys cannot: ‘be: disciplined, bythe Department, OPR’s determination that;
a former Department attorney violated state:rules of professional conduct:for attorneys could result in,a referral:to an,
appropriate state attorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings résulting from investigations. of the: conduct:

of Depattment attorneys, éven former employees; may assist Department: managers in supervising, future casés:

10 In some:instances, OPR declines’ to:open an investigation based upon a review. of the initial complaint. or after

a preliminary i inquiry into the matter. In December 2010; one of: the: attorneys representing victims in the-CVRA.
litigation. raised allegations that: ‘Epstein. may have exerted i improper: influence over the federal criminal investigation
and that the USAO had deceived, the victims: of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant.to tts.
standard policy, OPR -declined to:open an investigation into. those allegations at that. time in, ‘deference to ‘the.
then-pending CVRA litigation.
