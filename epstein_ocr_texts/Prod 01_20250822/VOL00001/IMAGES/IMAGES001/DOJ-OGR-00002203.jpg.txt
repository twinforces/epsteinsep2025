Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 100-2 Filed 12/18/20 Page 4 of 4

Article 3 of the Bilateral Extradition Treaty signed on April 23, 1996 between the United
States of America and France stipulates that “The requested State is not bound to grant the extradition
of any of its nationals, but the Executive Power of the United States has the right to do so at its
discretion if it deems it appropriate.”

In application of this Treaty and of the general principle of non-extradition of nationals under
French law, France systematically refuses to grant the extradition of French nationals to the American
judicial authorities, while the American authorities regularly agree to extradite their nationals to
France.

It should be noted that the principle of non-extradition of nationals applies not only to the
United States but also to all other States except the Member States of the European Union under the
terms of the Law of March 9, 2004 transposing the framework decision of June 13, 2002 on the
European arrest warrant, which provides that the surrender of the requested person may not be refused
on the sole ground of his French nationality.

This principle of non-extradition of nationals fits into the context of the construction of the
European judicial area which itself is part of a very specific process of political integration between
the Member States of the European Union. This high level of political integration existing between the
Member States of the European Union goes hand in hand with a certain homogeneity within these
States in terms of the scale of penalties as well as in terms of adjustment of penalty methods; the
member states being bound by the same international obligations (in particular the obligations arising
from the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and
from the case law of the European Court of Human Rights).

In any event, the principle of non-extradition of nationals is a principle of extradition law from
which France has never deviated outside the framework of the European Union.
