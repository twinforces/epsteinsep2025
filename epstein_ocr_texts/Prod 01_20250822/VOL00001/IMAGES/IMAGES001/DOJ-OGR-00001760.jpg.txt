Re: Proposed Redactions to Request to Modify Protective Order (Under Seal)
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,
In accordance with this Court’s Order of August 18, 2020 (Doc. 44), Ms. Maxwell hereby
respectfully submits under seal her proposed redactions to her Request to Modify Protective
Order (“Request”), filed under seal on August 17, 2020. Ms. Maxwell also has filed her Reply
under seal and contemporaneously submits her proposed redactions to that pleading.!
Ms. Maxwell has no opposition to keeping under seal, and redacting from her Request and
Reply, the contents, description and discussion of the sealed materials themselves; because the
government has marked them Confidential, the Protective Order requires as much. See Doc. 36,
4 15.
The government’s proposed redactions, however, go further and propose to redact yy
ES. The covernment would
have this Court redc lll
Re ©0 the premise that it would “risk jeopardizing the
government’s investigation.”

redactions to this letter.
