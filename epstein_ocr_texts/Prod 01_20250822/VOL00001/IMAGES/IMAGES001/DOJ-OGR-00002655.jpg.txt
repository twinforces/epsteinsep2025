PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully:submits this Memorandum in Support’ of her. Motion to
Dismiss Counts One Through Four of the Superseding Indictment as Time-Barred (“Motion”).
‘to reach back more:than 25 years and bring charges that-have: long been time-barred. Counts
Once through Four charge: Ms,. Maxwell with offenses allegedly committed. between 1.994 and.
1997. But the applicable statute of limitations, 18 U.S.C. § 3282, expired five years after the
alleged conduct.

In.an attempt-to get around its statute of limitations problem, the government has invoked.
18 U.S.C; § 3283, as that statute was amended in 2003—many years after the alleged conduct
occurred. But the government’s:reliance on. that‘provision is improper for two separate and
independent reasons, either of which, by itself, mandates dismissal, of Counts One. through. Four.

First, the charges are time-barred even tinder § 3283 unless the Court retroactively:
applies the: 2003 amendment:to the statute to cover Ms,. Maxwell’s conduct from the 1990s,
rather than, the version of § 3283 ‘that was in cffect at the time of the alleged offenses. But
Congress made surpassingly clear that:it:did not intend the 2003. amendment to apply
retroactively. To the contrary, the conference committee considered and rejected an express
retroactivity provision.in the House'version.of the bill, and one of the bill’s original Senate co-
sponsors: acknowledged _.on the Senate floor that the omission-was intentional. Moreover, any
such retroactive application would have a‘presumptively impermissible retroactive effect.

Second, even.if the 2003: amendment could be applied retroactively, § 3283 docs not
apply to any of the offenses alleged. in the indictment.at a//, Section 3283 is an.exception.to the
general five-year statute of limitations, and it applies only to an “offense involving” the sexual or

physical. abuse of. kidnapping of'a child. The Supreme Court has repeatedly:made clear that the
