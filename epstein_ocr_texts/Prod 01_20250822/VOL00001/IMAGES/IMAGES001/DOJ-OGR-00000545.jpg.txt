Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 35 of 74 25

1 that -- by the way, you're suggesting that the measure of

2 recidivism is a reported classic case by the prosecutor, state
3 or federal, indictment, etc., etc.

4 That may not even occur in most instances because a

5 lot of cases that are even referred to prosecutor offices are

6 never formalized or never brought.

7 So I'm not sure that the passage of time, without more
8 and without more study and with let's say discipline of a

9 defendant -â€”- I'm not sure that that gets us there.

10 MR. WEINBERG: I guess I would have two responses.

11 THE COURT: Sure.

12 MR. WEINBERG: One, that the level of publicity

13 brought to Mr. Epstein and brought in this case and even

14 brought before the bringing of this case, his wealth which

15 makes him an attractive civil defendant as well as a criminal
16 defendant -- and there have been a number of complaints or

17 threats or notices or demands by different civil lawyers.

18 But there is an unprecedented amount of publicity that
19 would mobilize and motivate people who were victimized by him.
20 If there were any people victimized by him after 2005, it is
21 utterly lacking in the average case where some victim doesn't
22 know that they've got an ear, whether it's an ear of the civil
23 bar or an ear of the United States Attorney, to receive,
24 positively receive, and embrace an allegation against
25 Mr. Epstein.
