‘Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36 Filed 07/24/19 Page35o0f74 35
that —-— by the way, you're suggesting that. the measure of
recidivism is a meported classic case by the prosecutor, state

or federal, indictment, étc., etc.

That may not é6éven occur in most instances because a

lot. of; cases that are even referred to prosecutor offices are
never formalized or never brought.
So I'm not sure that the passage of time, without more

and withotit. more study dnd ‘with let's say discipline of a

defendant -- I'm not sure that that. gets us there.

MR. WEINBERG: I guess I would have two responses.
THE COURT: Sure.

MR. WEINBERG: One, that? the lével, of publicity

brought. to Mr. Epstein and ‘brought in this case and even

brought. before the bringing of this case, his wealth which

makes him an attractive civil defendant. as well as a eriminal

defendant! -- and there Have besn a number of Complaints or
thréats Or notices or démands by differént civil lawyers.

But there is an unprecedented amount of publicity that

would mobilaze and motivate people who were victimized by him.

If there were any people victimized by him after 2005, it is

utterly lacking in the average casé whéré some victim doesn't

know that they've got an ear, whether it"™s an ear of the civil.

bar or an ear of the United States Attorney, to receive,

positively receive, dnd embrace an allegation against

Mr. Epstein.
