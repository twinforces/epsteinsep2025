In urging a different conclusion, the defense again cites the same cases discussed in its
initial briefing and at the July 14, 2020 hearing to argue that the proposed bail conditions are
consistent with or exceed those approved by courts in this Circuit for “high-profile defendants with
financial means and foreign citizenship.” (Mot. at 34; see Dkt. 18 at 16, 21; Tr. 48-51). The Court
should reject the defense’s efforts to raise the same precedent that the Court already took into
consideration when denying bail. ““A motion for reconsideration may not be used . . . as a vehicle
for relitigating issues already decided by the Court.” Jackson v. Goord, 664 F. Supp. 2d 307, 313
(S.D.N.Y. 2009) (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court already considered and rejected
the defendant’s efforts to liken her case to other “serious and high-profile prosecutions where the
courts, over the government’s objection, granted bail to defendants with significant financial
resources.” (Tr. 88). Noting “crucial factual differences,” the Court described those cases,
including United States v. Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2018), United States v. Dreier,
596 F. Supp. 2d 831 (S.D.N.Y. 2009), and United States v. Madoff, 586 F. Supp. 2d 240 (S.D.N.Y.
2009), as “not on point and not persuasive,” and distinguished the defendant for a number of
reasons, including the defendant’s “significant foreign connections.” (Tr. 88; see id.
(distinguishing Esposito where the risk of flight appeared to “have been based on the resources
available to defendant, not foreign connections or experience and a record of hiding from being
found”); id. (distinguishing Madoff where “the defendant had already been released on a bail
package agreed to by the parties for a considerable period of time before the government sought
detention”)).

The Court already engaged in a fact-specific analysis in ordering the defendant detained.
Among the reasons provided, the Court found that the “the defendant not only has significant
financial resources, but has demonstrated sophistication in hiding those resources and herself.”
