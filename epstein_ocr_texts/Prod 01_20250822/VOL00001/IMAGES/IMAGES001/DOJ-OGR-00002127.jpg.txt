any extradition request from the US Government to the competent French Authorities
(“The Waiver’). (See Exhibit B).

e All extradition requests from the USA to France must be examined by the Investigating
Chamber of the competent Court of appeal, which has jurisdiction over the legality of
extradition requests in France.

e Under the circumstances of this case, where Ms Maxwell would have fled from the USA
to France prior to her trial in violation of her bail conditions, it is highly likely that Ms
Maxwell would be placed in custody in France from the earliest stages of the extradition
proceedings.

e As the principle against the extradition of nationals is not part of the Extradition Treaty
between the USA and France, the Investigating Chamber of the Court of appeal would
not oppose the extradition of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell on the ground that she is a French
citizen.

e The final decision to extradite and its execution would ultimately be a matter for the
executive.

e Inthe recent past, J am not aware that the French authorities would have had to address
the situation in which the United States sought extradition of a French citizen who was
also a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from in that
regard. However, it is our view that under the specific and unique facts of this case, it
is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an
extradition decree against Ms Maxwell because of several critical factors, namely: her
United States citizenship; the fact that she has signed an irrevocable Waiver in the USA;
the fact that in the present situation, the only way the issue would be raised in France is
if Ms. Maxwell would have already fled to France in violation of very strict bail
conditions, and the fact that a failure by French authorities to grant extradition would
result in an obligation to try Ms. Maxwell before French courts for the conduct described
in the Indictment. Finally, France would be inclined to preserving the interests of the
USA for obvious diplomatic reasons.

e With regard to timing, if the requested person has consented to extradition, the
Investigating Chamber must deliver its ruling no later than 14 working days after the
