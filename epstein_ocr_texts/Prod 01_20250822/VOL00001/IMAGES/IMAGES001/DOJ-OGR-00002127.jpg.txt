any extradition. request. from, the US Government tothe competent French Authoritics
(The Waiver’). (See Exhibit’B).

e All extradition-requests fromthe USA to Frarice-imust be éxamined.by'the Investigating
Chamber of the competent :Court of appeal, which, has jurisdiction over'the legality of

extradition:requests in Erance.

o ‘Under the circumstances of this case, where Ms Maxwell would have fled.fromthe USA
‘to: France prior to her trial:in.violation of her bail. conditions, it is highly: likely that Ms
Maxwell'would be:placéd in custody’ in France ‘from the carlieststages of the:extradition

‘proceedings:

° As the principle against;the extradition of nationals is not part of the: Extradition Treaty
‘between-the USA. and. France, the Investigating Chamber of the Court of appeal would

is highly. unlikély' that thé French. govérnmeént' would, refusé ‘to.:issue: and éxecute. an
extradition, decree. against Ms Maxwell because of'several, critical factors, namely: her
‘United States citizenship; the fact that she has signed.an irrevocable Waiver:in the: USA;
‘the fact that in-the present situation, the only way. the issue would be raised.in.France is
if Ms. Maxwell ‘would have. already: fled to France: in violation of very strict bail
conditions, and the fact, that.a. failure by French authorities ‘to: grant, extradition would
result in.an obligation to try Ms. Maxwell before.French courts forthe conduct:described
in, the Indictment, Finally, France would be inclined to preserving the ‘interests of the

‘USA for obvious diplomatic: reasons.

o With regard to timing, if the requested ‘person ‘has consented to: extradition, the

Investigating: Chainber :inust. deliver its ruling no later than. 14 working days after the
