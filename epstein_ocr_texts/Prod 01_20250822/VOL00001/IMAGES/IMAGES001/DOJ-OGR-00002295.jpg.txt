to present “some overlapping proof” and “five limited overlapping witnesses” to prove both
charges).

Finally, severance is appropriate because a joint trial including the Perjury Counts will
necessarily introduce into the trial the issue of Ms. Maxwell’s credibility, even if she decides to
assert her Fifth Amendment right not to testify. By alleging that Ms. Maxwell lied about sexual
and other salacious topics, the Government is explicitly putting its very big thumb on the
credibility scale. The Government will attempt to argue to the jury that Ms. Maxwell lied about
the allegations in the Perjury Counts and that Ms. Maxwell is a liar in general. This is a tool not
normally afforded to the accuser in a criminal case. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for Ms.
Maxwell to lodge appropriate objections and the Court to make appropriate rulings and provide
limiting instructions on the evidence. There is a substantial risk that the jury will convict Ms.
Maxwell on Counts One-Four because her credibility was attacked in connection with the
Perjury Counts. In short, a joint trial on Counts One through Six guarantees a mess. The Court
should therefore sever the Perjury Counts under Rule 14(a).

CONCLUSION

For the reasons set forth above, the Court should sever the Perjury Counts (Counts Five
and Six) from the Mann Act Counts (Counts One through Four) and order that they be tried
separately, pursuant to Rules 8(a) and 14 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.
