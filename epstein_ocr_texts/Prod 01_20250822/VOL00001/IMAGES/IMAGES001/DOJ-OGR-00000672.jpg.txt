a you have handled this investigation, and especially how you

6 have treated the victims in this case.

7 Like I said, I have many who want to speak. Some that
8 can't. This is a very difficult day for them. But we

9 appreciate the opportunity and the invitation.

10 The first client that I have that is going to address
11 your Honor is the one who walked into my office in 2008 asking
12 just to be heard, Courtney Wild.

13 THE COURT: Hold on one second. Did you all want to
14 be seated?

15 You don't need to be standing. Whatever is more

16 comfortable until you're ready to give some comments. It's up
17 to you.

18 Ms. Wild, if you could spell your name for the court
19 reporters, please.
20 MS. WILD: Courtney, C-o-u-r-t-n-e-y, last name Wild,
21 W-i-l-d.
