Second, he is also wrong on the law. Courts have found that Section 1591 applied to both
suppliers and consumers of commercial sex acts. See, e.g., United States v. Jungers, 702 F.3d
1066, 1069 (8th Cir. 2013) (upholding the conviction of a defendant who attempted to pay for oral
sex from an underage girl and explaining: “The sole issue raised on appeal is whether ‘[t]he plain
and unambiguous provisions of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 apply to both suppliers and consumers of
commercial sex acts.” We conclude they do.”) (alteration in original). The lone case cited by the
defendant, Fierro v. Taylor, No. 11 Civ. 8573, 2012 WL 13042630 (S.D.N.Y. July 2, 2012), relied
heavily on the statutory interpretation undertaken by two district courts in the District of South
Dakota, United States v. Bonestroo, No. 11 Cr. 40016, 2012 WL 13704 (D.S.D. Jan. 4, 2012), and
United States v. Jungers, 11 Cr. 40018, 2011 WL 6046495 (D.S.D. Dec. 5, 2011), both of which
were explicitly overruled by the Eighth Circuit decision in Jungers, 702 F.3d 1066. In the seven
years since Fierro has been decided, it does not appear to have been cited by a single other court.
Additionally, other cases in this Circuit and elsewhere have upheld convictions of procurers or
customers. See United States v. O’Connor, 650 F.3d 839 (2d Cir. 2011) (upholding convictions
under Section 1591 of both the buyer and seller of a child); United States v. Cook, 782 F.3d 983
(8th Cir. 2015) (rejecting a constitutional challenge that Section 1591 would be void for vagueness
if applied to purchasers); United States v. Mikoloyck, No. 09 Cr. 036, 2009 WL 4798900 (W.D.
Mo. Dec. 7, 2009) (“contrary to defendant’s argument, 18 U.S.C. § 1591 clearly applies to those
who attempt to purchase underage sex, not merely the pimps of actual exploited children”) (citing
United States v. Roberts, 174 F. App’s 475 (11th Cir. 2006) (in which defendant was convicted
under sections 1591(a) and 1594(a) even though no actual children were involved)).
CONCLUSION
As set forth above, the defendant’s proposed bail package is insufficient and insubstantial.
Pretrial Services, victims, and the Government all recommend pretrial detention due to the unusual
and concerning confluence of factors in this case, including the defendant’s extraordinary wealth,
demonstrated willingness to interfere with victims and witnesses, continued possession of lewd
photographs of young females, and both the incentive and means to flee prosecution.
Very truly yours,
