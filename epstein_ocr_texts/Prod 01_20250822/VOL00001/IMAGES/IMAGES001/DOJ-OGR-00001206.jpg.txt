IN THE MATTER OF AN OPINION
ON THE EXTRADITION LAW OF ENGLAND AND WALES
RE GHISLAINE MAXWELL
ADDENDUM OPINION

1. | This Addendum Opinion is provided in response to the Government’s Memorandum
in Opposition to the Defendant’s Renewed Motion to Release dated 16 December
2020, insofar as it pertains to matters of English extradition law and practice.

2. The primary conclusions of the Opinion dated 8 October 2020 (‘the Opinion’)
remain unchanged, namely: (a) in the majority of cases, proceedings in England and
Wales in relation to US extradition requests are concluded in under two years; (b) it
is virtually certain that bail would be refused in an extradition case in circumstances
where the requested person had absconded from criminal proceedings in the United
States prior to trial and in breach of bail; and (c) on the basis of the information
currently known, it is highly unlikely’ that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able
successfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to the charges in the
superseding indictment dated 7 July 2020. In addition to those conclusions, the
following three points may be made.

3. First, as noted in the Opinion’, Ms Maxwell’s waiver of extradition would be
admissible in any extradition proceedings in England and Wales. While such a
document cannot compel a requested person to consent to their extradition once in
the United Kingdom, the document would be a highly relevant factor in any
contested extradition proceedings. In particular:

(a) If Ms Maxwell were to rely on such a waiver to secure bail in the United
States and then, having absconded, renege on the undertakings in that
' The Government observes, at p.16 of the Motion, that this leaves open a “possibility” that extradition could be
resisted. Absolute certainty in any legal context is rare but the practical effect of the conclusion in the Opinion is
that, at this stage and on the basis of the information currently known, it is difficult to conceive of circumstances
in which Ms Maxwell could successfully resist extradition, and her extradition would be a virtual foregone
conclusion.
