17 Counsel, I am going to do an aside here because I

19 With respect to Ms. Maxwell's deposition, you are to

22 Judge Sweet relied on the index in making his rulings.
28 280-1. Correspondence with Ms. Menninger. Same
24 thing. Unseal and redact only names and identifying
25 information of nonparties, including search terms.
