2.  ‘Ms..Maxwell’s Counsel. Was.in Regular_Contact:with.the:Government
Prior to Her: Arrest

At no timé, however, did Ms. Maxwell intend to flee of hide from the government, -as the
government argued at the last, bail’hearing. In fact, her intent:was exactly the opposite. .As her
spouse’s letter makes clear, after:spending'a few months away[ sid Ms. Maxwell
moved [ so that she could [ ‘be within.
driving, distance ofthe prosecutors in New York:in,case they wished'to speak to her. (Ex. A
12) (‘[Ghislaine]'was adamant'to not only'stay in ‘the United States-to fight-the, smears against:
her, but to be within driving distance of New York.”). Contrary'to the impression given. bythe
government, Ms. Maxwell was not. “changing locations on multiple occasions” as, if she were a
fugitive from justice. (Tr. 87). After Ms.. Maxwell. moved into the house in New Hainpshire in
arrest. (See Ex. B) (“[S]he was finally able to locate a place where she could not be moving
around constantly:and collect herselfto fight for her life and ‘to clear-her name?’ ’).

Ms: Maxwell, through her counsel, was also in regular contact with:the government
from. the moment of Epstéin’s arrest up the time of her owii arrest, as would be, customary’ in
such situations. Defense counsel. corresponded by email, spoke. on the phone, or had in-
person meetings with, government in, July, August, September, and October 201.9, and also
in January and March. 2020. The timeline. attached to this submission illustrates the extent
event that the government was considering any charging decisions against Ms. Maxwell.
We were never given. that opportunity, which is. uncharacteristic for the Souther District of

New York, nor were we ‘given any notice of her impending, arrest.
