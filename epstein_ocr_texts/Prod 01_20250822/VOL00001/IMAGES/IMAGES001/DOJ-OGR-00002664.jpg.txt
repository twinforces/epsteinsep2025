Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 144 Filed 02/04/21 Page 16 of 25

In. the civil context, the Second Circuit has acknowledged a distinction. between
retroactively applying an extended. limitations. period to revive astale claim, which has. been held.
impermissible under Landgraf, and retroactively extending the limitations period :for. alive claim,
which has been held’permissible. See, e.g., Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 57-58 (2d Cir. 2017)
(collecting and comparing civil cases). The criminal context, however, is. fundamentally
different,

Ata minimum, 7oussie “potentially alters the seceond step inthe. Landgraf approach” in
criminal.cases. United States v. Miller, 911 F.3d 638, 645 (st Cif. 2018) (evaluating 2003
Amendment in adjudicating ‘ineffective assistance of counsel claim). “In. other words, when.
Congress has sounded an. uncertain ‘trumpet, a.court ought to refrain ‘from applying an enlarged:
criminal. statute of limitations:rctrospectively.” Jd. As shown.in the first step of Landgraf, the
trumpet sounded by Congress in, cnacting the 2003 Amendment was anything but uncertain:
congressional intent is. clear.

In. the criminal context, the retroactive application. of an extended statute of limitations to
revive a time-barred claim is not:‘merely an impermissible: effect under Landgraf; it violates the
Ex. Post Facto Clausé. Stogner v. California, 539 U.S. 607,618 (2003). As Landgraf itself
recognized, however, the’principle against: retroactivity is not simply an application of the Ex
Post Facto Clause; rather, it is a “deeply rooted” presumption based on “[e]lementary.
considerations” of fundamental “fairness.” Landgraf, 51:1. U.S. at 265-66. See also Thom -y:
Ashcroft, 369 F.3d 158,163 n.6 (2d Cir. 2004) (Calabresi, J., writing for the majority ‘but noting
he! was speaking. for himself) (stating that anti-retroactivity presumption in Landgraf 1s.“triggered.
* For this:reason, the:governmentwould be barred from prosecuting Ms. Maxwell for‘any offense.against the third
accuscr (identified in the indictment as:Minor. V.icfim-3). even if the 2003,Amendment.otherwise applied, because

the third accuser reached-age 25in [_. and:thus:the statute of limitations-as to-her had expired by the time:
of the,2003 Amendment.
