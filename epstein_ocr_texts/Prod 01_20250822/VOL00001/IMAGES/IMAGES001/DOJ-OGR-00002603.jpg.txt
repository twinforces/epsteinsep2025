C. The NPA’s Prohibition, on the Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators. Is
Not Limited to Prosecution for Conduct, Between 2001. and.2007 or for:
Particular Statutory Offenses.

Einally, the government has characterized the NPA’s co-conspirator immunity: provision
as “limited by: its terms to conduct-spanning from 2001 to 2007 ..... and to violations of'statutes
not charged in this Indictment.” Reply Mem. at.5-6. This characterization is grossly inaccurate.
The co-conspirator immunity provision contains:no limitation as to cither the time period. or the
statutes on which'such criminal charges might be based.’

Just.as the NPA deviates from the standard agreement in failing to include language
limiting its scope to the SDFL, it also deviates from the standard agreement by failing to specify
the conduct, including the time period, for which the putative defendant—or, in this case,
potential. co-conspirators—cannot be prosecuted. As with its failure to. limit the co-conspirator
immunity provision to the SDFL, the government may not now rewrite the’ NPA to limit-the
scope of covered conduct. in a mariner that.it. failed to do in drafting the NPA. .At:minimum, the
absence of any such. limitation. renders the scope of the:provision. ambiguous, and. any ambiguity.
must be construed against;the government. See.Feldman, 939 F.3d_at: 189.

While: the NPA’s factual recitals reference the 2001-07 time period and list five potential.
statutory offenses, the’NPA’s'substantive provisions establish no such limit‘on the immunity. for
potential. co-conspirators—or, for'that:matter, for: Epstein himself—to cither that time:period or
those offenses. As to Epstein, the NPA-provides immunity-for (i) “any offenses that:arose” from
the undefined. “Federal Grand Jury, investigation” and (ii) “any other offenses that have been the
subject.of the joint. investigation by the Federal. Bureau of Investigation and the United States

* The governments. assertion. thatthe co-conspirator:immunity provision.is limited to “violations:of statutes not
charged in.this Indictment” (Reply Mem. at:6) is incorrect forthe additional reason that both the NPA and the;
current.indictment (“Indictment”) reference: violations.of the Mann Act. Gompare NPA at (1. (citing 18 U'S.C.,
Ss 2422(b), 2423(b), 2423(c)) with Indictment.4F 10, (alleging-conspiracy to. violate § 2422(a)) and. 15 (alleging
conspiracy-to-violate § 2423(a)).
