Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 64 Filed 07/25/25. Page 4of4

withheld is a.question best left’to, the. court-adjudicating that future case. We are concerned. that,.

if'this Court explicitly or implicitly blesses the Government’s proposed redactions of non-victim-

related personally identifiable information (even. in passing), that-opinion will be treated:as a.
proverbial thuiib on the scale in our FOIA case without:materially'affecting the Court’s decision
in. this. case:

Government’s s promise to redact ot personally identifiable information, we are concerned ‘that: the
Government will then argue in its FOTA case that “Judge Berman agreed. that this information.
should not.be publicly disclosed.” Therefore, we respectfully request that this Court not take ‘the
Government’s statements regarding non-victim-related personally . identifiable: information. into
account when reaching its decision regarding:the Government’s motion, and we furthér request
thatthe Court-specify that it is noz opining on that question, should it grant the Government’s
motion.

‘Lhe Government takes no position on the intervention of MSW Media. I did not consult
with a.rcpresentative forthe former defendant.

Since rely,
