The report shows nothing of the sort. Ms. Maxwell, who was‘sitting in.a jail cell at the time;
was asked by Prétrial Services to estimate her assets. Accordingly, she gave her best
estimate of the assets. she held inher own name, which the:government concedes she did
with remarkable accuracy considering that.she had not reviewed her financial statements.”

The government’s.arguments further confirm that it has lost all’ objectivity and will
government asserts that Ms. Maxwell has demonstrated “sophistication in hiding her assets”
and characterizés her transfers to'a trust as.“funneling” assets to: her spouse to. “hide: her true
wealth.” (/d. at 24). There is nothing unusual, let alone nefarious or even particularly
sophisticated about transferring assets into a trust of a spouse. Indeed, Ms. Maxwell fully
disclosed these transactions on.her joint tax returns. More importantly, all of the assets
disclosed in the financial report, whether they are owned by Ms. Maxwell:or her spouse, are
included in the bond axiount atid are subj ect to forfeiture if she ‘flees.

The government further argues that the financial condition report shows ‘that Ms.
Maxwell has accéss to millions of dollars of “unrestrained funds” that she:could use to flee
the country and reimburse any of her sureties. for the loss of their security. (/d. at 23). That.
characterization is simply untrue. First, as disclosed in the financial report, Ms. Maxwell
has procured significant loans oi the basis of a riegative pledge. over her London property.
Second, the $4 million controlled byherspouse[ se s—is—is@C
could only be liquidated with considerable. difficulty.

The government also faults Ms.. Maxwell for not including.a valuation of future

contingent assets.and income that may never materialize. (/d. at 23-24). For‘example,[ |

° Moreover, for thé reasons disciisséd in our initial memorandum, Ms. Maxwell was réluctant to discuss-anything
about her spouse and clearly expresséd her reluctance to. Pretrial Services éarly on:ifi the iiterview.
