law of the Statute, by its structtire, favors rélease. The
Supreme Court has. and the Second Circuit has advised us that a
very Limited number of people shotild be dé@tatinéd ‘prior to ‘trial
because of the statute's structure, and the government nowhere

mentions that. Tt basically acts. as if all it has to do is

They alsgq say nothing about the burden, which is
discussed on a case written f6r the Second Circuit by Judge
Raggi, and also the U.S. v. English case. Without going into a

rebutted, and we submit it is here, and theh it is the burden
flight. and that there are no Gonditions or combination of

conditions to secure the release, which we submit they haven't

decidéd that we sHould come before your H6nor with a package
that was set out subject, of course, to the ruling provided, by
the court, subject of course to verification as to suretors by
Pretrial Services and the court. We didn't want to just walk
in, and say; Judge, we should be entitled to bail; please set
