If, ‘as here, there is‘probable cause’to find that;the defendant committed ‘an. offense:
specifically enumerated in. § 3142(c¢)(3), a-rebuttable presumption arises “that.no condition:or
‘combination of conditions will reasonably assure” the defendant’s appearance or the safety of the
community. or others. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(3). In.such. circumstances, “the defendant ‘bears a.
limited. burden ‘of production... ... to rebut that presumption by: coming forward with cvidence:that
he docs not pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.” Wiited States v. English, 629
F.3d 311, 3.19 (2d Cir. 201:1) (quoting Wnited, States vi. Mercedes, 254 F.3d,433, 436 (2d Cir.
2001.)); see also United States v. Rodriguez, 950 F:2d 85, 88 (2d Cir. 199.1) (“LA] defendant must.
introduce some evidenec contrary to'the presumed, fact in order to rebut'the presumption.”).
Nonetheless, “the government retains ‘the, ultimate. burden. of'persuasion by cléar and convincing
‘evidence that the defendant presents.a danger tothe community,’ and ‘by the lesser standard of'a,
preponderance of the evidence that the defendant:presents a risk of flight.” English, 629. F.3d. at.
3.19 (quoting. Mercedes, 254 F.3d at 436); see-also United States-v. Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1144:
(2d Cir. 1986) (“The government retains the burden of persuasion [in.a presumption casc].”).
Even when. ‘‘a defendant has met his burden of production,” however; “the presumption favoring:
‘detention docs not. disappear entirely, but. remains:a.factor'to be:considered among those weighed
by the district court.” United. States'v. Mattis, 963, F.3d 285, 290-91 (2d Cir. 2020).

Ill. ‘Discussion

The ‘Defendant bases her third motion for bail on the Court's inherent powers to review
its own bail decisions, arguing that the new conditions she ‘proposes warrant reconsideration of.
the Court’s carlicr rulings. See-Def. Mot. at 4. She also argues that the strength ofthe.
Government’s case is diminished in light of the arguments she advanees ‘in her pre-trial, motions,

which are currently pending before the Court. /d. at 7. Having considered. those arguments, the:
