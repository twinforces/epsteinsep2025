II. The Government Has Not Carried Its Burden Under 18 U.S.C. § 3142,

The grave concerns raised by the current COVID-19 crisis notwithstanding, Ms. Maxwell
must be released because she has met her limited burden of production showing that she does not
pose a flight risk, and the government has entirely failed to demonstrate that no release condition
or combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court.

A. Applicable Law

As the Supreme Court has recognized, “[i]n our society liberty is the norm, and detention
prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.” United States v. Salerno, 481
U.S. 739, 755 (1987). Pretrial detention is appropriate only where “no condition or combination
of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the [defendant].” United States v.
Sabhnani, 493 F.3d 63, 75 (2d Cir. 2007) (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)). The Bail Reform Act
provides that a court “shall order the pretrial release” of the defendant (18 U.S.C. § 3142(b))
(emphasis added), but may impose bail conditions if “such release will not reasonably assure the
appearance” of the defendant in court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c). Where conditions are necessary,
such release shall be “subject to the /east restrictive . . . set of conditions that [the court]
determines will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.” 18 U.S.C. §
3142(c)(1)(B) (emphasis added). Consequently, “[u]nder this statutory scheme, ‘it is only a
limited group of offenders who should be denied bail pending trial.’” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).
