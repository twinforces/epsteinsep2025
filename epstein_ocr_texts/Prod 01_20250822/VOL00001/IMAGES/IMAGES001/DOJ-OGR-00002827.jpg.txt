Il. Fifth Amendment

The Equal Protection clause of the Fifth Amendment similarly forbids the ‘exclusion of
tacial minorities from grand and petit juries.’ Casianeda v. Partida, 430.U.S.:482, 492 (1977).

§ 1861. The Second Circuit has held that fair cross-section challenges brought under the JSSA
must also be analyzed using the Sixth Amendment’s,Duren test. See United States v. LaChancee,
788 F.2d 856, 864 (2d Cir. 1986). Thus, if a fair cross-section challenge fails under the Sixth

Amendment, italso fails tinder the JSSA. See id. (““[B]ecause the Duren test governs ‘fair cross
