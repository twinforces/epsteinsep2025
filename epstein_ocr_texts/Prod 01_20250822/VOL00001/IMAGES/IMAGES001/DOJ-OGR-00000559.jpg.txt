Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36_ Filed 07/24/19 Page 49 of 74 a

1 conditions, along with monetary conditions, the combination of
2 home detention, monitoring, video cameras, a visiting list

5 approved by pretrial, a waiver of search and seizure were more
4 than sufficient to abate any danger, either of obstruction or

5 of underlying criminal behavior in a case called, U.S. v.

6 Patriarca.

7 THE COURT: That reminds me of another question.

8 Do you think that bail conditions equally apply to

9 risk of flight and/or danger to the community? It strikes me
10 that they're different kind of concepts.

11 MR. WEINBERG: I think your Honor is completely

12 correct. There is an overlap. I think the danger to the

13 community is abated more by a lesser list of conditions that I
14 don't even think the government would quarrel with, were they
15 not seeking detention.

16 We could work with the United States Attorney and

17 agree to conditions that would essentially eliminate danger

18 because he'd have no way to communicate, so long as the

19 government trusted that the lawyers who were visiting him were
20 not going to go and engage in license threatening misbehavior
21 which I assure you that Mr. Weingarten, myself, and Mr. Fernich
22 are not.
23 The conditions for flight, if I can turn to flight, I
24 contend deal directly with some of your Honor's questions about
25 the monetary conditions and some of the government's objections
