‘Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 49of74 49
conditions, along with monetary conditions, the combination of

home detention, monitoring, video cameras, a visiting list

approved by pretrial, a waiver of search and seiztire were more

than sufficient to abate any danger, either of obstruction or

of underlying criminal behavior in a case called, U.S. v.

Patriarca,
THE €QURT: That reminds me of another question.

Do you think that bail. conditions éqially apply to

risk of flight and/or danger to, the community? It strikes me

that they're different kind of. concepts.

MR. WEINBERG: I think your Honer is completely

correct. There is an overlap. I think the danger to the
community is abated more by a lesser list of conditions that 1

don't even think. the government. would quarrel with, were they

not. seeking detention.
We. Could work with the United States Attorney and

agree to conditions that would esséntidlly eliminate danger

because he'd have no way to communicate, so long as the

government trusted that. the lawyers who were visiting him were

not, going to go ard engage in license threatening misbehavior

which I assure you that. Mr. Weingarten, mysélf, and Mr. Fernich

are not.

The conditions for flight, if 2 can turn to flight, I

contend deal directly with some, of yotir Honor's questions about

thé monetary conditions and some of thé government's objections
