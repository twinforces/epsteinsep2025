witnesses, including potential FRE 404(b) witnesses, and trial exhibits, the government’s
speculation about the length of the trial is entirely one-sided and lacking in any reliable estimate
of a defense case. The government’s April 12" disclosure of information and statements
regarding 226 witnesses containing exculpatory information requires intensive investigation.
The delayed expansion of its prosecution and its unilateral expansion of the length of trial
severely impacts defense preparation, trial readiness, and conflicts with other trial commitments.

To assist the Court and defense counsel in accurately determining the length of trial, Ms.

alleged FRE 404(b) evidence, and a list of potential trial exhibits. With this information the
Court and the parties will be making decisions based on facts, not speculative promises.

have other clients and firm commitments to try cases specifically scheduled to follow the
summer trial of this case. These commitments make us unavailable from September through
December, and possibly spill over into January, make trying this case unlikely, if not impossible,
before mid-January. We are extremely hard pressed to request any continuance, especially one
which will prolong Ms. Maxwell’s miserable and punishing detention, but the need for time to
properly prepare Ms. Maxwell’s defense as a result of the additional charges requires us to do so,
causing Ms. Maxwell to reluctantly agree to this request.

In addition, motion hearings, in limine motion practice, and any litigation regarding
expert witnesses have not yet commenced, and issues regarding jury selection, including but not
limited to a jury questionnaire, have not yet been settled. Yesterday, we met with the
