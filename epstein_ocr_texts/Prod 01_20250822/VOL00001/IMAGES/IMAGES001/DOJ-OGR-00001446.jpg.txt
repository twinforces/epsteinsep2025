Case 21-770, Document 73, 05/27/2021, 3109708, Page6 of 24
things, Judge Nathan emphasized Maxwell’s “substantial international ties,”
including “multiple foreign citizenships,” “familial and personal connections
abroad,” and “at least one foreign property of significant value.” (/d.). Judge
Nathan further noted that Maxwell “possesses extraordinary financial resources,”
lacks “any dependents, significant family ties or employment in the United States,”
and made representations to Pretrial Services about her finances that “likely do not
provide a complete and candid picture of the resources available.” (/d. at 83-84).
Accordingly, Judge Nathan found that the Government had carried its burden of
demonstrating that Maxwell “poses a substantial actual risk of flight” and that “even
the most restrictive conditions of release would be insufficient” to ensure Maxwell’s
appearance, especially in light of her “demonstrated sophistication in hiding [her
financial] resources and herself.” (/d. at 86-87). Judge Nathan also rejected
Maxwell’s arguments about the difficulty of preparing a defense while incarcerated,
finding that measures in place were sufficient to ensure Maxwell’s access to her
counsel. Judge Nathan directed the Government to work with the defense “to
provide adequate communication between counsel and client” and invited the
defense to make specific applications to the District Court for further relief if the
process was “inadequate in any way.” (dd. at 90-91).
