defense counsel indicated that they would consent to the requested extension on four conditions.
First, the defense asked that the motion deadlines in this case be extended by three weeks. Second,
the defense asked that the Government provide the defendant with a laptop on which to review her
discovery at the Metropolitan Detention Center. Third, the defense asked that the Government
provide the defense with the names of the three Minor Victims listed in the Indictment by
November 23, 2020. Fourth, the defense asked that the Government provide the defense with all
Jencks Act material by November 23, 2020. In response, the Government agreed to the first two
conditions, but did not agree to the second two conditions. Accordingly, the parties have been
unable to reach agreement on the requested two-week extension of the deadline for the Production.
4, I hereby certify that the foregoing statements made by me are true.
