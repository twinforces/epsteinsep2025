2002 WL. 1467845, at *1 (S:D.N.Y. July 8, 2002) (similar); see also United States v. Fox, 275 F.
Supp. 2d. 1006, 1012 & n.7 (D..Neb. 2003) (surveying the casclaw and. adopting’ the “majority
view” that Rule 17(c) “does ‘not ordinarily permit. the use of ex parte applications by the
purpose: of secking the documents is for use at trial,” and. even then, only if “there is a.good. trial-
