3. The Proposed Bail, Package Is More Than
Adequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence

For the reasons stated above, the Court: should release Ms. Maxwell because. the
circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk:
and prevent:her from: meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government.
has not carried. its burden under 1.8. U.S.C. § 3142. We respectfully submit that the proposed
bail:package represents the “least.restrictive” set of conditions. that will reasonably. ensure Ms.
Maxwell’s. presence in court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142 (¢)(1)(B).

The. package includes six.co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and
friends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her.
despite the unrelenting tnedia attacks that: Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered
as a.result of this case. ‘Each of them has voluntarily agreed to.assume responsibility for an
extremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond. is.
also to be secured by real property. in. the United Kingdom worth-roughly $3.75 million.

The package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering
all passports atid no. new ‘travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastém.
Districts of New York, and home detention ‘with. electronic GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell,
for personal ‘reasons, will continue to need security’ guards. to protect her ‘upon release.
Under the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report: to Pretrial

which.a court can.grant’pretrial release’to a.defendant:on the:condition ‘thatthe defendant pays for private armed
security, guards. Boustani, nevertheless, held that a:defendant may be:released on'such.a condition iftthe defendant
“is‘deemed to be’a flight.risk primarily-because-of his wealth. In otherwords; a.defendant:may be releasedon such.a
condition-only: where, bit for-his wealth, he:would not have been detained” 7d¢. (emphasis ‘in original). We submit:
‘thatva similarly: situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no:prior criminal:record,, significant ties to: the United
States, and a:demonstrated lack of intent to ‘flee the country;.as well:as numerous, supportive:co-signers,, but‘ who: did
