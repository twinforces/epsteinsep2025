a. country that does not extradite its citizens, has access to-untold financial resources, and has every
motivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes. See United States v. Boustani, 356 F.
Supp. 3d 246, 255(E.D.N.Y. 2019) (“|The combination of Defendant’s alleged deceptive actions,
access to substantial financial resources, frequent international travel, complete lack of ties to the
United States, and extensive ties to foreign countries without extradition demonstrates Defendant
poses'a serious.risk of flight.”) (citing United States-v. Zarrab, No. 15 Cr. 867 (RMB), 2016 WL
3681423, -at *8 (S.D.N-Y. June 16; 2016)). The defendant’s proposed bail package is essentially
nothing more than an unenforceable promise to return to Court. Given the gravity of the charged
crimes, the defendant’s substantial resources, her willingness to evade detection, and her lies under
oath, the Court should take the proposed bail package for what it is worth: nothing.
V. The COVID-19 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release

Finally, the current pandemic is not:a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in
this district have regularly rejécted applications for release. based on assertions about the.
generalized risks of COVID-19.. See, e.g., United States v. Paulino, No. 19 Cr. 54 (PGG), 2020
WL 1847914, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 13; 2020) (Gardephe, J.) (denying bail application by defendant
with hypertension, stating that “|a]s serious as it is, the outbreak of COVID-19.simply does not
override the'statutory detention provisions |of the Bail Reform:Act|”.(internal quotation omitted));
United States v. Ortiz, 19 Cr. 198 (KPF), 2020 WL 2539124, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 19, 2020)
(quoting United States v. Nunez, No. 20 Cr. 239 (ER) (S.D.N-Y. Apr. 10, 2020) (Ramos, J.)
(“|BJecause there isa pandemic does not mean that. the jailhouse doors ought to be thrown

opéen”)). Significantly, the defendant has not claimed that:she is at a higher tisk from COVID-19
