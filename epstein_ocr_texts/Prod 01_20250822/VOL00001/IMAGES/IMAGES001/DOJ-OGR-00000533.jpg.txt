1 coincidental that on the Saturday before the Monday filing by

2 Mr. Epstein in Florida in the CVRA case Mr. Epstein is

S arrested.

4 We have evidence not only of an enormous amount of

5 overlapping evidence, but we have evidence of the involvement

6 of the Department of Justice; the CEOS unit, the Child

7 Exploitation Unit, both before the nonpros agreement was

8 executed, they were involved with the Southern District of

9 Florida. And after, they volunteered essentially to be part of
10 a team in the event that Mr. Epstein did not conclude his

11 obligations under the CVRA.

12 THE COURT: You mentioned in your submissions -- and I
13 think you mentioned or your colleague mentioned the last time
14 that we were in court -- that high-level Department of Justice
15 officials approved the non-prosecution agreement.

16 MR. WEINBERG: Yes, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: Who are they?

18 MR. WEINBERG: First, the agreement was executed on

19 September 24, 2007. Appeals were taken by Mr. Epstein
20 challenging the federal interest in what was a potential state
21 prosecution.
22 The first level was the criminal division. The head
28 of the criminal division, Alice Fisher, assigned to Sigal
24 Mandelker. I may be mispronouncing her name, but she is the
25 current Undersecretary of the Treasury.
