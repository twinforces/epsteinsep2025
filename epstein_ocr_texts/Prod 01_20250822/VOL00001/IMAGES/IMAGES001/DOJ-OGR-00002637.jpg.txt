of immunity, or (6) the deportation of criminal aliens. The potentially applicable standards that
OPR considered as to each of these issues are identified and discussed later in this Report. OPR
also examined whether the evidence establishes that any of the subjects were influenced to enter
into the NPA, or to include in the NPA terms favorable to Epstein, because of an improper motive,
such as a bribe, political consideration, personal interest, or favoritism. OPR also examined and
discusses in this Report significant events that occurred after the NPA was negotiated and signed
that shed additional light on the USAO’s handling of the Epstein investigation.

B. The District Court’s Conclusion That the USAO Violated the CVRA

To address the district court’s adverse judicial findings, OPR assessed the manner, content,
and timing of the government’s interactions with victims both before and after the NPA was
signed, including victim notification letters issued by the USAO and the FBI and interviews
conducted by the USAO. OPR considered whether any of the subject attorneys violated any clear
and unambiguous standard governing victim consultation or notification. OPR examined the
government’s lack of consultation with the victims before the NPA was signed, as well as the
circumstances relating to the district court’s finding that the USAO affirmatively misled Epstein’s
victims about the status of the federal investigation after the NPA was signed.

V. OPR’S FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS

OPR evaluated the conduct of each subject and considered his or her individual role in
various decisions and events. Acosta, however, made the pivotal decision to resolve the federal
investigation of Epstein through a state-based plea and either developed or approved the terms of
the initial offer to the defense that set the beginning point for the subsequent negotiations that led
to the NPA. Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he participated in its drafting and approved
it, with knowledge of its terms. During his OPR interview, Acosta acknowledged that he approved
the NPA and accepted responsibility for it. Therefore, OPR considers Acosta to be responsible for
the NPA and for the actions of the other subjects who implemented his decisions. Acosta’s overall
responsibility for the government’s interactions or lack of communication with the victims is less
clear, but Acosta affirmatively made certain decisions regarding victim notification, and OPR
evaluates his conduct with respect to those decisions.

A. Findings and Conclusions Relating to the NPA

With respect to all five subjects of OPR’s investigation, OPR concludes that the subjects
did not commit professional misconduct with respect to the development, negotiation, and
approval of the NPA. Under OPR’s framework, professional misconduct requires a finding that a
subject attorney intentionally or recklessly violated a clear and unambiguous standard governing
the conduct at issue. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that required Acosta to indict
Epstein on federal charges or that prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the state.
Furthermore, none of the individual terms of the NPA violated Department or other applicable
standards.

As the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and
Department policy to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate, as long as his
decision was not motivated or influenced by improper factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to
initiate a federal prosecution of Epstein was within the scope of his authority, and OPR did not
