Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell

Dear Judge Nathan:

The government’s letter of April 6" is yet another:‘regurgitation of its previous letters
regarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement. No matter how often the government tries
to present Ms. Maxwell’s detention as superior'to other inmates, it continues to miss the mark.
We:stand by our previous responses and-rcitcrate:that-Ms. Maxwell’s detention is unwarranted
and overly‘restrictive. It:is tantamount to “pay-=it-forward” punishment: served:pretrial.

The goveriiment’s letter provides. the opportunity’ to ‘flush out the persistent-unsanitary
conditions at the MDC, which,long predate Ms. Maxwell’s detention. This past weckend there
‘was a pervasive stench of sewage in Ms. Maxwell’s’unit. necessitating guards to flush:pipes by
pouring water down open drains in an cffort to trap and.disperse gascous cmissions..As guards
explained to Ms. Maxwell, there arc three drains in the day: area, andwhen the plumbing system
goes unused, gases escape from the drains and cause the stench. At.timeés the stench in Ms.
Maxwell’s isolation. cell has been. overwhelming ‘duc to‘overflowing of toilcts in.the:cellblock
above. ‘Duc to lack of'privacy, Ms. Maxwell refrains from-using the toilet :in the isolation ccll,
‘stench is apparent-upon, entering the visiting area. Of the many: defense ‘counsel who visit:
