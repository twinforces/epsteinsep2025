The Impact of the Potential Penalties Is Overstated, The government asserts that
detention is warranted because of the potential for’a,long sentence ‘in this case. (Gov. Mem.
at:4-5.) This oversimplifies the governiig standard. Although the severity of potential
punishment is a relevant consideration, the Second Circuit “require[s] more than evidence of
the commission of.a serious crime and the fact of a‘potentially long sentence to support a
finding of risk.of flight.” /‘riedman, 837 F.2d at 49-50 (district court’s: finding that
defendant. posed.a risk of flight-was clearly erroneous, despite potential, for “long sentence
of incarceration”): séé also Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 65, 76-77 (reversing, detention order
where defendants agreed to significant physical. and. financial restrictions, despite the. fact
that. they’ faced. a “lengthy term. of incarceration”). Accordingly, the asserted potential for a

long seiitence does not ineet the governmeiit’s burden of persuasion.
