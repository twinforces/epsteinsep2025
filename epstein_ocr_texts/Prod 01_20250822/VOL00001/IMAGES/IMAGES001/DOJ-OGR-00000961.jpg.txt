PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Opposition to the
government’s July 2, 2020 Memorandum in Support of Detention (““Gov. Mem.”).

It is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered more public attention than the
government’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2019, Epstein was indicted for
offenses relating to sexual misconduct, amid overwhelming media attention focused on the
nature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth and lifestyle. On August 10, 2019, Epstein died in
federal custody, and the media focus quickly shifted to our client—wrongly trying to substitute
her for Epstein—even though she’d had no contact with Epstein for more than a decade, had
never been charged with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always
denied any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many of these stories and online posts were
threatening and harassing to our client and those close to her.

But sometimes the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not
Jeffrey Epstein. She was not named in the government’s indictment of Epstein in 2019, despite
the fact that the government has been investigating this case for years. Instead, the current
indictment is based on allegations of conduct that allegedly occurred roughly twenty-five years
ago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to the
presumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since 1991, has
litigated civil cases arising from her supposed ties to Epstein, and has not left the country even
once since Epstein’s arrest a year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, and highly
publicized, criminal investigation. She should be treated like any other defendant who comes
before this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in this Circuit and
other circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should be released on bail, subject
to the strict conditions proposed below.
