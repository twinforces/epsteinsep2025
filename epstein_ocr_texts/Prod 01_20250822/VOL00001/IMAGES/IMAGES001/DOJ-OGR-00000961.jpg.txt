Ghislaine: Maxwell respectfully:submits this Memorandum in,Opposition, to the
government’s July 2,.2020 Mcimorandum. in S upport.of Detention (“Gov. Mcm.”).

It-is difficult to recall a recent case that has garnered.more public attention, than the
government’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July2019, Epstein was indicted ‘for
‘offenses: relating to: sexual misconduct, :amid overwhelming media attention focused on the
nature of the charges and. Epstcin’s ‘wealth and lifestyle. On, August.10,.2019, Epstein. died in,
‘federal custody, and.the média:focus quickly shifted.to our clicnt—wrongly trying to substitute:
her for Epstein—even though she’d had.no contact with Epstein for more than.a decade, -had
never been charged, with a.crime or becn:found liable, in.any civil, litigation, and has always
denied. any allegations of'claimed misconduct. Many of these storics and, online. posts were.
threatening and. harassing to our client:and those. close to. her.

But: sometimes the simplest*point is the: most: critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not.
Jeffrey Epstein. She was not named in-the government’s: indictment of Epstein in.2019, despite
the fact.that the government has been ‘investigating this. case for ycars. Instead, the current.
indictment is based on allegations of conduct'that allegedly occurred:roughly twenty-five ycars
ago..Ms..Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled to'the
presumption of innocenec. Far from “hiding,’” she ‘has ‘lived.in the United States since 19911, has
litigated ‘civil cases arising 'from her supposed tics'to Epstein, anid.has not left the country’ even
‘once since Epstein’s arrest a’ycar, ago, even,though/she was aware of the pending, and highly
publicized, criminal. investigation. She ‘should. be treated like any other:defendant’who comes
before this Court, including as to bail. Under the Bail Reform.Act, case law in this: Circuit and
other circuits, as well as decisions of this Court, Ms. Maxwell should. be released on bail, subject

to the strict conditions proposed below.
