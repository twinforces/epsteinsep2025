government should be required, at a minimum, to remove this shroud of mystery and file a bill of
particulars to permit Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense and avoid unfair surprise at trial.
Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d at 574. Accordingly, we request the particulars set forth in Exhibit A. (See
Ex. A).

II. Motion for Disclosure and Inspection of Documents

Ms. Maxwell seeks an order directing the government to produce certain material
believed to be in the possession of the government or its agents, or which could be obtained by
the government from other prosecutorâ€™s offices, law enforcement officers and investigators,
witnesses, or persons having knowledge of the events giving rise to this case. Ms. Maxwell
requested these documents from the government, but was denied. As discussed further below,
Ms. Maxwell has good reason to believe that some of these documents contain exculpatory
Brady material; hence, the government has a duty to produce them to the defense, and should be
ordered to do so immediately. The alternative means of obtaining the requested documents
would be through subpoenas served on the government and unidentified witnesses, which is an
impractical pursuit. The government would likely move to quash any subpoena, requiring court
intervention; and it would be impossible to serve subpoenas on witnesses without knowing their
names and locations. We therefore request that the Court direct the government to produce the
documents set forth below.
