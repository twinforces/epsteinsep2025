United States v. Annabi, 771, F.2d 670, 672 (2d-Cir. 1985). Annabi'supports dismissal here by
confirming that.where, as here; both the text of the NPA.and the facts and circumstances of the

so bound. Alternatively, any application, of Annabi that limits the NPA’s effect to the SDFL

prosecutions ‘for (1) conduct between 2001 and 2007 and (ii) statutory offenses specitically:
referenced inthe factual recitals to the NPA. Again, the co-conspirator immunity provision
contains no such limitations and thus :forecloses this, argument. The text ts clear, but even if it

‘intent to warrant discovery and.an evidentiary hearing on the issue. Accordingly, if the
indictment is not dismissed, Ms. Maxwell requests leave to conduct discovery as to the intent of
the parties, to the NPA with respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision, as well as an
evidentiary hearing in.aid ofthis Motion.
