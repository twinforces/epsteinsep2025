United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985). Annabi supports dismissal here by
confirming that where, as here, both the text of the NPA and the facts and circumstances of the
underlying negotiations demonstrate an intent to bind the United States (other USAQs), they are
so bound. Alternatively, any application of Annabi that limits the NPA’s effect to the SDFL
would conflict with the likely interpretation of the NPA by the Eleventh Circuit, which should
apply in case of any such conflict.

Third, the government argues that the co-conspirator immunity provision prohibits only
prosecutions for (i) conduct between 2001 and 2007 and (ii) statutory offenses specifically
referenced in the factual recitals to the NPA. Again, the co-conspirator immunity provision
contains no such limitations and thus forecloses this argument. The text is clear, but even if it
were ambiguous, it must be strictly construed against the government.

In the alternative, to the extent there is any doubt that the NPA bars this prosecution, the
facts and circumstances surrounding the NPA at least raise sufficient issues regarding the parties’
intent to warrant discovery and an evidentiary hearing on the issue. Accordingly, if the
indictment is not dismissed, Ms. Maxwell requests leave to conduct discovery as to the intent of
the parties to the NPA with respect to the co-conspirator immunity provision, as well as an
evidentiary hearing in aid of this Motion.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

On or about September 24, 2007, Epstein and his counsel entered into the NPA with
Acosta, the United States Attorney for the SDFL.* While USAOs in a number of judicial
districts, including this District, typically use a standard template for plea agreements and other
non-prosecution agreements, this NPA did not follow such a standard format. To the contrary,
