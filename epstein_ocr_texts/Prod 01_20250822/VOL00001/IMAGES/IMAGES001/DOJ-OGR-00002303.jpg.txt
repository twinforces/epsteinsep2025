Ms. Maxwell, pursuant.to the Fifth, Amendment to the United. States Constitution and
Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(6)(3)(B)(11), ‘requests that. the Court, dismiss. éither Count ‘One or Count Three
of the Superseding Indictment as multiplicitous because:these Counts, as alleged, charge the
‘same: offense'twice and therefore violate the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth, Amendment.

Count Onc ofthe. Superscding Indictment (“Indictment”) charges. Ms. Maxwell. with
Indictment 44 9=11. Count Three of the Superseding Indictment again charges Ms. Maxwell

underlying the § 371 conspiracy charged. In Count/One, it isa violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422
(enticing minors to travel to engage:in illegal :scxual activity). Jd. 449-10. In Count Three, itis
‘a, violation of 18 U.S.C; § 2423(a) (transporting minors, with, intent to engage, in illegal,sexual.
activity). Jd. 4§ 15-16. This minor variance is insufficient to avoid the Fifth Amendment’s
double jeopardy bar.

in. fact and inlaw.” /d. (quoting United Statés ¥. Estrada, 320. F.3d 173, 180.(2d Cir. 2003).
“{TJhe principle danger created by multiplicity is that.a defendant will receive multiple
punishments ‘for a single offense.” Unifed States v. Colion, 231 F.3d.890, 910.(4"" Cir. 2000).
