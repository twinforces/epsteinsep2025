EB The Proposed Bail Package Is More Than
Adequate to Secure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence

For the reasons stated above, the Court should release Ms. Maxwell because the
circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic will greatly increase her personal risk
and prevent her from meaningfully participating in her defense, and because the government
has not carried its burden under 18 U.S.C. § 3142. We respectfully submit that the proposed
bail package represents the “least restrictive” set of conditions that will reasonably ensure Ms.
Maxwell’s presence in court. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1)(B).

The package includes six co-signers—Ms. Maxwell’s siblings, relatives and
friends—many of whom reside in the United States, and all of whom continue to support her
despite the unrelenting media attacks that Ms. Maxwell and they, themselves, have suffered
as a result of this case. Each of them has voluntarily agreed to assume responsibility for an
extremely large bond amount of $5 million, in order to secure her appearance. The bond is
also to be secured by real property in the United Kingdom worth roughly $3.75 million.

The package also includes stringent travel and physical restrictions, including surrendering
all passports and no new travel applications, travel restricted to the Southern and Eastern
Districts of New York, and home detention with electronic GPS monitoring. Ms. Maxwell,
for personal reasons, will continue to need security guards to protect her upon release.
Under the circumstances, if the Court requires it, the security guards could report to Pretrial
Services.'°

which a court can grant pretrial release to a defendant on the condition that the defendant pays for private armed
security guards. Boustani, nevertheless, held that a defendant may be released on such a condition if the defendant
“is deemed to be a flight risk primarily because of his wealth. In other words, a defendant may be released on such a
condition only where, but for his wealth, he would not have been detained.” /d. (emphasis in original). We submit
that a similarly situated defendant who, like Ms. Maxwell, had no prior criminal record, significant ties to the United
States, and a demonstrated lack of intent to flee the country, as well as numerous, supportive co-signers, but who did
