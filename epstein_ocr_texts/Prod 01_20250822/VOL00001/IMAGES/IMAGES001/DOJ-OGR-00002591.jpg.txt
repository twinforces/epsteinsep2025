that the facts and circumstances of the negotiation of, the NPA. are ‘consistent with.the parties’
intent to‘provide potential co-conspirators with the broadest immunity: possible. Even if there
were ambiguity, which there is not, that ambiguity must be construed against the government and
in favor of the defense. Accordingly, the: indictment must: be dismissed. In the alternative, Ms.
Maxwell should be permitted to take: discovery regarding the intent of the parties to'the NPA
with. respect to the co-conspirator:immunily provision, and. the Court: should hold.an evidentiary:
hearing in aid of this Motion.

I. The Indictment Should Be Dismissed for Breach of the NPA.

“Plea agreements have long been, interpreted in,accordance with contract law principles.”
United States v. Gonzalez, 93. F. App’x 268, 269 (2d Cir. 2004). “In interpreting whether a:plea
agreement has. been breached, this court looks to the reasonable understanding of*the:partics as. to
the terms ofthe agreement.” Jd. at: 269-70 (internal quotations and citations omitted). However,
thé government “must bear'the burden. for any lack of clarity in the agrécment and ambiguities
should be resolved. in favor ofthe defendant,” Janes: v. Dalsheim, 864 F.2d.974, 979. (2d Cir.
1988).. Here,. the NPA unambiguously precludes prosecution of Epstein’s potential co-
conspirators, and the indictment in.this case must be dismissed.

In. support of its July:2020 motion, for‘Ms, Maxwell’s detention, the government raised
three arguments why it contends: the NPA does ‘not bar Ms. Maxwells prosecution: (1) that Ms.
Maxwell supposedly lacks standing to enforce the NPA; (ii) that the co-conspirator immunity:
provision applics only-in the SDFL; and (iii) that the provision is limited to. conduct occurring
during the 2001-07 time period and ‘to violations of statutes specifically:referericed:in the NPA.
Government’s.Reply Memorandum in Support of Detention (“Reply Mem.”), Dkt. No, 22. (filed

Jul. 13, 2020), at 5. None of these arguments has merit.
