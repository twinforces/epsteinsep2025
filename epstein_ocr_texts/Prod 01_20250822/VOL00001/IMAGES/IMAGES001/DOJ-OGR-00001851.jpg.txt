Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20. Cr. 330 (ASN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

On ‘behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we plan to file a. Renewed Motion for’
Release on. Bail. (the. “Motion”) and respectfully request an i” camera conference, with all

in-camera conference would be the most: efficient: form ‘to address ‘these issues and, other
confidentiality concerns related, to the Motion. We intend. to Provide a ‘full set of materials to the
that ssensifive contents of the submission be accorded confidentiality protections similar to ihose
that the government,routinely requires in protective orders, including the one in this case.

Inthe four months since this Gourt denied Ms. .Maxwell’s request ‘for bail and granted ‘the
government’s motion for detention, Ms. Maxwell arid her. counsel, have assembled substantial
information that. was not. available: to present at. the initial hearing,.as well as a comprehensive
bail package co-signed:by sureties who were unable to come forward at that time, Accordingly,
Ms. Maxwell now'seeks ‘to renew‘ her request for bail pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3 142(f).

Ms. Maxwell’s, renewed. application ‘will rely on sensitive. and, private information ‘that, if
made public, would be highly damaging to, both.Ms. Maxwell and third parties, including?
¢ Letters from.Ms. Maxwell’s family members and close’ friends, who have agreed to

serve ‘aS ‘sureties fo support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed. bail application. ‘The letters
contain personal, détails that, if madé public, would invite identification and.
