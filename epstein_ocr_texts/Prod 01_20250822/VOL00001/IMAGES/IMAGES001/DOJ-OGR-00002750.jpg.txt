defendant cannot simultancously pursue bail in both. the Second, Circuit.and the district court. To
allow her to seck 'relicf in both ‘venues runs counter to the principles of judicial economy:
underpinning x the divestiture of jurisdiction upon the filing of:a notice.of appeal. See-Rodgers, 10. L
F.3d at 251."

The Court’s lack of jurisdiction to grant the Third.Bail Motion doés not leave: the.defendant.
without a:remedy. The defendant can withdraw‘ her-pending bail appeal to restore, jurisdiction to
this Court. Alternatively, the Court can follow the procedure:set forth-in Rule 37(a) of the Federal.
Rules of Criminal Procedure, which:provides that.if the-defendant:makes'a timely motion for relicf
“that the court lacks ‘authority to grant beeause of:an appeal that.has becn docketed and. is pending,
the court. may: (1) defer.considcring the motion; (2) deny the motion; or (3) state cither that. it-
would grantthe motion if the court of appeals remands for that purpose or that the motion.raises 4.
substantial. issue.” However, the defendant should not be permitted: to simultancously:pursue bail
in‘both this Court and the Sccond.Circuit.

Ill. The Court Should Not Revérse Its Prior Well-Reasoned. and Thorough. Bail
Decisions

Even if this Court had. jurisdiction to ‘grant. the Third Bail. Motion, the motion should. be:
denied. This Court has already twice made the determination that the defendant. poses a risk of
flight. In, particular, the Court has ‘found, “the charges, which carry ‘a, presumption. of detention,

" While the Government has:not identificd a.case addressing the precise issuc with, which the Court;
is confronted, scveral considerations support the Government’s position. that the Court does not
presently have jurisdiction to grant: the. Third. Bail Motion. In. addition ‘to the rule articulated by
the Supreme Court in. Griggs: | in CI hing v. United States, the Second Circuit ‘found that while an.
a. motion fo amend the: Section 2255 motion, 298. F.3d. 74, 180 nS (od Cir. 2002) (The distelet
court: could not:rule on any ‘motion affecting an aspect; of the case that was before [the Second
Circuit], includitig a ‘motion. to aniend ‘the motion, while that appeal was -pending.”’). Here, too,

while:the defendant’s appeal of the denial of'the. Second Bail/Motion.is pending, the: Court should
not:grant the :defendant’s motion. to reconsider that: very. same bail ruling. Rule 9 of the Federal
Rules of Appellate Procedure, which, governs. release ‘in, a criminal case, also supports ‘such a.
reading. Rule 9(b), which governs. release after a judgment. of conviction, provides that. a “party:
entitled’to do, so may obtain review of a district-court order regarding rélease after a judgment of
conviction by filing a notice of appeal from that order in the district court, or by’ filing, a motion in.
the court of appeals if the party has already filed a notice of appeal from. the judgment of
conviction.” In, United States v. Hochevar, 214 F.3d.342 (2d Cir. 2000), the Second Circuit:found.
that Rule:9(b) contemplates going’to the, district court first fora bail:ruling x after a notice of appeal
from the ae conviction ‘s filed: Rule a which g n governs, release Pefor Cc a Judgment of

of F appeals ‘must promptly d determine” the - presjudement bail sppeal Such promptness would not:
be necessary if defendants could go back to the district court with, another bail motion ‘while the
bail appeal is:pending.
