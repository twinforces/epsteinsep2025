NPA’s references to the. “United States” demonstrate a,definitional intent not to limit such
provisions, to the USAO-SDFL.

The NPA begins with several factual recitals. After noting, certain details of the
investigation and. indictment by the Florida. State Attorney’s Office, the recitals state, among
other things, that (i) '‘the:“United States Attorney’s, Office” and ‘the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (“FBI”) have “conducted. their own investigation into Epstein’s background and
any offenses that may have been committed by Epstein against the United, States from in or
around 2001. through in. or around September 2007, iricluding” five enumerated federal criminal
offenses; (ii).Epstein. secks “to resolve. globally his state: and federal criminal. liability” and thus
1s agreeing to comply’ with-the terms of the NPA “in exchange for'the benefits provided by this
agreement”; and (iii) “the interests of the United States, the State of Florida, andthe Defendant
will be served. by the following procedure.” NPA at 1-2 (emphasis added), ‘Nowhere in the
recitals, is reference made specifically to the SDFL or to the USAO-SDFL, nor is there any
suggestion. that the-partics in any way intended to limit the “global[]” resolution of Epstein’s
liability.

The NPA then-provides, that “prosecution [of Epstein] in this District for these offerises
shall be deferred.in. favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided. that Epstein abides by”
the terms, of the NPA. NPA at 2. The NPA also provides that, after-its terms are fulfilled,

no prosceution. for the offenses sct out on pages 1 and 2 of this Agreement [c:g.,

the five enumerated federal offenses], nor any other offenses that have’ been the

subject of the joint investigation by: the Federal ‘Burcau of Investigation and. the

United, States Attorney’s Office, nor any offenses that arose from, the Federal

Grand Jury investigation” will be instituted in this District, and the charges
against Epstein if any, will be dismissed.
