F. Supp. 2d 240 (S.D:N.Y:. 2009).

The Court’s concerns regarding, the absence of any dependents, significant family tics, or
employment in.the United ‘States, meanwhile, apply. with somewhat less, force in, light. of the
evidence submitted in. support ofthis motion. See id: at 84:4-84:9. The Defendant has.
submitted.a, litany of letters of support written, by. friends and, family members. See‘Def.. Mot.,
Exs. A-N, W-X. These Ictters, according to the Defendant, support.her claim that she has
significant tics to the United. States and attest to the Defendant’s character. The Defendant.
places particular emphasis on,the letter written by her spouse, whose identity and. connection,to
the Defendant was withheld. fromthe Court.at'the. initial bail hearing. See:Def. Mot. at! 11-13.

‘the :Government’s, characterization of the Defendant's “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at 9, was
belied by the “quict family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at ‘11; see also Def: Mot, Ex. A
44/4-5., Other letters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective tics'in, the
United States are strongerthan was originally presented. to, the Court in the initial bail hearing.
These letters substantiate the:Defendant’s claim that she has. important'ties to people:in
the United States, but;they leave unaltered the: Court’s conclusion, that: flight would not:pose an,
insurmountable burden. for the Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant now argucs that
her newly’ revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective tics in the country, but
at the time'‘she was arrested, she was not living with him and claimed to be’ getting divorced. See:
Pretrial Services Report.at 3. Indeed, she docs not propose to live:with him:were she to be
released on bail, undereutting her argument.that that relationship would. create an. insurmountable

burden to her flecing. Furthermore, the fact*that she has‘fricnds and family in the United States
