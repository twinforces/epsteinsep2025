Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell’s Renewed Motion for Bond

Although this Court denied Ghislaine Maxwell’s motion for bond
(see Ex. A, Order, April 27, 2021), it appeared concerned with the
conditions of her confinement during oral argument and instructed Ms.
Maxwell that “[t]lo the extent Appellant seeks relief specific to her
sleeping conditions, such request should be addressed to the District
Court.” (Ud.).

Ms. Maxwell did just that, explaining again to the trial judge the
erueling conditions of her confinement, which includes shining a
flashlight in Ms. Maxwell’s eyes every 15 minutes, over the past 318 days
in solitary confinement, even though she is not suicidal and even though
no other inmate suffers such abuse. Ex. C, Doc. 256. The government
responded, Ex. D, and although it previously intimated that Ms. Maxwell
might be suicidal (she’s not), it now said that the sleep deprivation was
justified because she is housed alone, because of the nature of the
charges, and because the case is high-profile. Not one of these reasons
makes any sense upon any examination. The government did not provide
an affidavit from anyone at the jail or explain why depriving Ms. Maxwell
