granting the dubious premises that make up this deductive reasoning, the Court remains ,
unpersuaded because, again, the true cause of the exclusion—younger people moving more |
often—is an external force, not a systematic defect inherent in the Jury Plan. Rioux, 97 F.3d at )

systematic exclusion}. At bottom, the Court cannot charge the District’s Jury Plan with a Sixth
Amendment violation because of how often people move residences throughout the District.
Third, Schulte asserts that the Jury Plan’s exclusive reliance on voter registration lists
constitutes systematic exclusion. This claim, however, is foreclosed by the Second Circuit’s
