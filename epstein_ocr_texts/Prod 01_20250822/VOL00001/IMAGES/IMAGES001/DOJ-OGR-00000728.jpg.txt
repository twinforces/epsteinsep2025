Finally, it is unfortunate that your opinion piece may have been construed as an effort to |

chill Ms. Giuffre’s and Mr. Boies’ right to be heard under 18 U.S.C. § 3771 at the August 27,

2019 public hearing. You wrote: “[W]hatever informational interests the victims may have

would be served by affording them a chance to attend the hearing, not by giving them a speaking /

role.” |

Sincerely,

Richard M. Berman :
