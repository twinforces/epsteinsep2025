1 thought I read in all of these papers somewhere that New Mexico
2 was examining its decision that he needn't be registered in
3 that state.
4 MR. WEINBERG: It may be. And if they advise that he
5 is to register --
6 THE COURT: He would I'm sure.
7 MR. WEINBERG: -- it is just an incremental additional
8 registration obligation because he's under so many in Florida,
9 New York, and the Virgin Islands.
10 The so other part of danger -- and I apologize. I
11 will get to flight --
12 THE COURT: No apology needed.
13 MR. WEINBERG: -- is the government allegation that as
14 a result of the incident reports in Palm Beach dating back to
15 2006 that Mr. Epstein is a danger to others and should be
16 detained.
17 What I would respond to that is that the report -- and
18 I showed Mr. Rossmiller a slightly better, unredacted version
19 of page 86 of an incident report of Detective Recarey from the
20 Palm Beach Police -- reflected that the date of the complaints
al by the parents was May 22 or May 23, 2008.
22 It was the week that Mr. Epstein had hired new counsel
23 there which was a Mr. Jack Goldberger from West Palm Beach.
24 And Mr. Goldberger was scheduled, according to the incident
25 report, to meet with the representatives of the State
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
