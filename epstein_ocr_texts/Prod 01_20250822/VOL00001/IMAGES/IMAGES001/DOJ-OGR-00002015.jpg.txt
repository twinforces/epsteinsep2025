alerted. the government on August 27, 2020 that there were significant. portions of the first three
discovery productions that Ms. Maxwell could ‘not tead., (Dkt. 66). Despite numerous attempts
to’ fix these:problems over. the succeeding: weeks, including producing a replacement hard.drive
containing these: productions, the problems were not.resolved ‘and the replacement hard drive was
broken. In addition, the fourth and fifth productions, which Were, produced. after the, defense
alerted the government to these problems, contained. some of the same:technical-problems and
included a, significant:number, of unreadable documents. Most recently, the.hard drives for the
sixth arid séventh productions have stopped furictioning properly. As.a-tesult, Ms. Maxwell. has:
cannot.defend herself if'she cannot review'the discovery.

Most-recently, Ms. Maxwell-has had to:endure the added. burdens of quarantine. On
Novemiber 18,2020, Ms. Maxwell was given.a COVID test: and placed in. 14-day quarantine due
to contact with a staffer who tested positive. The revolving tear of guards assigned to Ms.
Maxwell, some coming from other BOP institutions confronting their own COVID outbreaks,
heightens her exposure to the virus. As, reported by the associate warden to the Criminal, Justice
check and response to'a few questions does little to detect an, asymptomic: carrier. The constant
Strip, searching, touch wanding: and in-mouth checking of Ms. Maxwell heightens her risk for

exposure to COVID-19.

“ On_November 18,2020; the government; at our request, provided.a laptop-computer'to Ms. Maxwell in‘the MDG,
which it’ believed. would:remedy:the issues with:unreadable documents, and has agreed to-provide anew hard drive
containingsall ofthe discovery. ‘It is too. carly’to: tell. whether, the;new ‘laptop. andhard drive will. solve allcof the
‘technical:problems. We note, however, that:now: that Ms. Maxwell has been.released. from quarantine, she only has:
access to the laptop from 8am-Spm, five:days:a week, which:will effectively limit her:review time to that time slot
because of compatibility issues: between the recently produced’hard drives and the:prison computer.
