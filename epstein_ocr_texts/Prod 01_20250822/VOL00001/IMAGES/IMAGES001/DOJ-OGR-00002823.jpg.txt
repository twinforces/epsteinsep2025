L Procedural History
Following an extensive investigation by law enforcement authorities, Schulte was
arrested in August 2017 on suspicion of leaking national defense information that he had !
obtained while working for the CIA. (Schulte Br. at 2, ECF 435; Gov’t Opp. Br. at 1, ECF 444.) |
Schulte has been in custody since his arrest. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 1.) :
On June 18, 2018, an indictment charged Schulte with thirteen counts of espionage and :
other offenses. (See id.) On October 31, 2018, the Government obtained a superseding
indictment, which incorporated the same offenses as the initial indictment but added two |
additional counts of unlawful disclosure and criminal contempt of court. (See id. at 1-2.)
On February 2, 2020, Schulte proceeded to trial on the eleven national security related
charges. (d. at 2.) On March 9, 2020, the jury returned a guilty verdict on two counts: (1) :
making false statements to law enforcement, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001, and (2) criminal |
contempt of court, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 401(3). Ud.; Schulte Br. at 2.) The jury, however,
was unable to reach a unanimous verdict with respect to the remaining eight national security
charges. (Schulte Br. at 2.) Accordingly, the Court granted the Defendant’s motion for a |
mistrial on those counts. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 2.)
Immediately following the trial, New York City emerged as the global epicenter of the
COVID-19 pandemic. See Hopkins Hawley LLC v. Cuomo, No. 20-CV-10932 (PAC), 2021 WL |
465437, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 9, 2021) (describing the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on New
York City). As a result, the vast majority of in-person proceedings throughout the Southern
District of New York (the “District”) were substantially dialed back or suspended altogether.
See, e.g., Standing Order, M-10-468 (CM) (S.D.N.Y. April 20, 2020). Grand juries and jury
