1 risk of flight or dangerousness, they are still entitled to the

2 same Sixth Amendment rights to access defense counsel to

3 prepare their case.

4 MR. COHEN: Of course, your Honor. My point was a

5 more narrow point. My point is that the facts in those cases

6 are different from our case in a meaningful way and the court

7 was doing a different evaluation. That was the point I was

8 making on this case.

9 So in conclusion, we believe this is a compelling case
10 for bail. We believe that the government, which has the burden
11 of persuasion that never shifts, has not made a showing as
12 required, that our client is a risk of flight. When you
13 consider the risk, as Judge Raggi put it, in Sabhnani, the
14 actual risk of flight, not fantasy and not speculation, when
15 you consider that the only factors they really point to are
16 ones that the cases have already addressed, such as
17 international travel and passports.

18 We also submit that the government has not carried its
19 burden of showing there is no condition or combination of
20 conditions that secure release.
21 So we would ask the court to grant bail today. And if
22 the court needs more information from us, we would respectfully
23 request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so
24 that we can try to satisfy the court because we want to.
25 Thank you, your Honor, for your time.
