accused could justifiably infer “handled” meant “touched”).

Moreover, “a perjury conviction must rest on the utterance by the accused of a false
statement; it may not stand on a particular interpretation that a questioner places upon an

The Government has selectively, and misleadingly, omitted testimony and objections to
questions that place Ms. Maxwell’s statement in context. The complete exchange:
