II. DISCUSSION
1. The NPA Between Epstein and USAO-SDFL
Did Not Bar Maxwell’s Prosecution by
USAO-SDNY

Maxwell sought dismissal of the charges in the
Indictment on the grounds that the NPA made between
Epstein and USAO-SDFL immunized her from prose-
cution on all counts as a third-party beneficiary of the
NPA. The District Court denied the motion, rejecting
Maxwell’s arguments. We agree. We review de novo the
denial of a motion to dismiss an indictment.°®

In arguing that the NPA barred her prosecution by
USAO-SDNY, Maxwell cites the portion of the NPA in
which “the United States [] agree[d] that it w[ould] not
institute any criminal charges against any potential co-
conspirators of Epstein.” We hold that the NPA with
USAO-SDFL does not bind USAO-SDNY.

It is well established in our Circuit that “[a] plea
agreement binds only the office of the United States
Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered
unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement
contemplates a broader restriction.”!! And while Maxwell
contends that we cannot apply Annabi to an agreement
negotiated and executed outside of this Circuit, we
have previously done just that.!? Applying Annabi, we
