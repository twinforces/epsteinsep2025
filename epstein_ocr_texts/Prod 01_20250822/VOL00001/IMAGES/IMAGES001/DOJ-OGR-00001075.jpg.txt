THE COURT: All right. THank, you, Mr. Cohen.

Ms. Moe, would the government like a brief reply?

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank, you, very much.

Your Honor, I want to begin by addressing head. on. the
notion, that the government's presentation in this, case is.
somehow about spins or about throwing dirt ‘or about the media.
Your Honor, my Colleagues, dnd I aré dppearing ‘today on behalf
of the United States Attorney's Office ‘of the Southern. District
of New York: Our presentation of the defendant's. conduct is
detailed in ‘an indictment. that was returned, by a grand jury ‘in,

this Gourt. These are the faéts. It is fot dirt. It is not

spin. That is the evidence and that. is what. we have ‘proffered
to thé court.
And the notion that. anyone could mead the indictment.

that has been returhéed in this case and now reéacth the

conclusion that an, adult woman, cultivating the traffic of
underage girls, knowing that they will be sexually abused and
exploited by an adult man, and conclude that, that is chilling
cénduct;, that is, on the face of the indictment, your Honér.
Turning toe the facts we have proffered, to the count
about. the deféndant's finances, and particularly about the
defendant"s conduct in, hiding, it appears, your Honer, that it
1s undisputed that the defendant was living in. hiding and took.
those actions. There cannot be any spin or characterization of
this spin. Those are the facts that appear to be undisputed.
