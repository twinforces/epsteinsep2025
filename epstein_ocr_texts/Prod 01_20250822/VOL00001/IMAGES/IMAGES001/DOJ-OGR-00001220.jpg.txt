COVID-19 related travel restrictions. Jd. at 83:21 83:25. The Court also observed that the
Defendant had family and personal connections to the United States but concluded that the
absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or employment in the United States also
supported the conclusion that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her. Jd. at
84:4 84:9. While the Defendant’s renewed motion for bail addresses some of these factors, it
does not alter the Court’s conclusion.

The first few considerations remain relatively unchanged. The Defendant continues to
have substantial international ties and multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have
familial and personal connections abroad. None of the evidence presented in support of the
present motion fundamentally alters those conclusions. To address the Court’s concern that the
Defendant’s French citizenship presented the opportunity that she could flee to France and that
she would be able to resist extradition on that basis, see Tr. at 83:18—83:20, the Defendant now
offers to waive her right to extradition from both the United Kingdom and France, along with
expert opinions reports claiming that such waivers would likely make it possible to resist an
extradition request from the United States to either country. See Def. Mot., Exs. T, U, V. As the
Government points out in its brief, however, the legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested.
The French Ministry of Justice, for instance, indicated in a letter submitted in conjunction to the
Government’s opposition that the French Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits” the
extradition of a French national. See Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. B. And while the Defendant’s own
expert attempts to rebut the Ministry of Justice’s letter, see Def. Reply, Ex. A, even the
Defendant’s own experts use probabilistic, rather than absolute, language, leaving open the
possibility that extradition would be blocked. See, e.g., Def. Mot., Ex. U at 2 (“On the basis of
the information currently known, it is highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able
