IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Plaintiff,
No. 17-CR-02949-MV-1

v.

DASHAWN ROBERTSON,
Defendant.
MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER

THIS MATTER is before the Court on the Defendant Dashawn Robertson’s Motion to
Reconsider Motion for Review of Detention Order and Immediate Release. Doc. 274. The
government filed a response in opposition [Doc. 282] and Mr. Robertson filed a reply [Doc. 284].
The United States Probation Office (USPO) also filed two memorandums addressing Mr.
Robertson’s release. Docs. 277 and 287. The Court then discussed the motion at length with the
parties and the USPO at the February 4, 2021 pretrial conference in this case. Doc. 297 at 4-6.
After carefully considering the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, the weight of the
evidence against Mr. Robertson, his history and characteristics, and the potential danger to the
community posed by his release, the Court found that a combination of extremely strict conditions
could reasonably assure Mr. Robertson’s appearance in court and the safety of the community, as
required by 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f). Jd. The Court also found that Mr. Robertson’s release was
necessary to allow him to effectively prepare for his upcoming trial under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(4)
because the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has significantly hampered his ability to meet or
communicate with his attorneys. /d. The Court accordingly ordered Mr. Robertson to be released
under strict conditions to La Pasada Halfway House on February 5, 2021. See Docs. 300 and 301.
