email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on
the question of detention pending trial.

Finally, the time between the Defendant’s arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the
Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district.
See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act
from today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a remote
proceeding, the Court finds “that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion] outweigh the best
interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial.” 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A). The
exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss a potential protective order,
which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in a manner protective of the rights of
third parties. See Dkt. No. 5.

SO ORDERED.
