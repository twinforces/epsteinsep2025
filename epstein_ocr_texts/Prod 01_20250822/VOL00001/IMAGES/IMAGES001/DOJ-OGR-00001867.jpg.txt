scheduled for: August 17", it fails to report that the VTC: was unsuccessful because the audio
connection failed: and, despite constant ongoing requests, no subsequent VT.Cs have been
‘Scheduled.

The letter ignores the fact'that there is: an outbreak of COVID in the MDC, with some 80:
‘inmates festing positive, far in excess of the number of positive cases reported. from March to
Deeember:. See https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/BOP (reported 12/7/20). While: Ms. Maxwell. is
tsolated from, general. population. inmates, the crew of security guards who monitor her 24/7 are:
not subject to mandatory. testing, with some guards assigned to..her. detail ‘rotating in from. BOP
facilitics where inmates and. staff thave tested positive. And while Ms. Maxwell may: not be:
exposed to other inmates, she is exposed, to individuals while escorted to a, common area. for
body‘scanning,, further risking her exposure to COVID.

While réciting. BOP poliéy, the letter fails to-address:

required to remove her:mask for an in:mouth inspection, heightening her exposure’
to COVID as:she was ’placed.in, quarantine;

o why Ms. Maxwell’s legal papers are repeatedly inspected.

extraordinarily onerous conditions of, constraint on, Ms. Maxwell. 'to avoid the catastrophic.
consequenecs of negligence occurring at the MCC that. resulted in the death, of Jeffrey. Epstein.
The Attorney ‘General. of the United. States has’ said as much. Beyond ‘the. decision, to not. place
Ms. Maxwell in general population, to which'we have no ‘objection,, the letter virtually concedes:
that other restrictions imposed on. Ms. Maxwell arc not in response to any concern, specific to her
and tacitly suggests the hcightencd restrictions are in response to’ the’ high-profile nature of the
case and the acknowledged failure by the, BOP to kecp Epstein = an. actual threat to himself =
alive. As ABC News reported:

Attorney General William, Barr told ABC News on, Wednesday that he is keeping a close
Manhattan j jail while awaiting trial last year. Barr said he ' was is Vivid" " ‘Epstein, died while
‘in. custody last August. The invéstigation into Epstein has continued even after his death.
I belicve very strongly'in. that case," Barr told ABC News on Wednesday. . . . “And as,
