because.MDCE has identified a number of factors.that raise heightened safety'and security concerns
with respect to this defendant, including: (1) the nature of the charges, (2) the potential stress. for
inmates that can arise ‘in high-profile cases, and.(3) the need to ensure the defendant?s safety while:
she is incarcerated in a cell by herself—a. housing determination made by MDC: staff based on.
various factors, including the defendant’s expressed concern for her safety if she were to be:housed,
in:the general population."

As to the Court’s question, whether the defendant can, be provided. with “appropriate eye
covering,” MDC Iegal.counsel has informed the Government that.the defendant cannot be provided
with an.cye. mask. Eye masks are not available. for purchase in commissary and. are not issucd to
inmates and, therefore, are considered. contraband. The defendant ‘is permitted, however, to'use
non-contraband items to cover her eyes at night.

Should the Court have any questions or require: any additional details. regarding this topic,
the ‘Government will promptly confer with legal, counsel at MD€ and, provide additional
‘information.

Respectfully submitted,

United States Attorney

The MDC has determined the defendant’s, current: housing assignment: based, ‘in :part, on her:
coneérms about being housed in the general population and as an, altcimative. to het being housed.
‘in-the SHU. By: contrast, in.the SHU, most inmates havea ccllmate ‘which provides an additional.
check should:something go:wrong or should an inmate need medical attention.in the middle of the

night.
