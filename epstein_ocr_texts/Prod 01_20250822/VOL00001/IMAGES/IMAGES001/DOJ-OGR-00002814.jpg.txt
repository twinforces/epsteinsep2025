to clay the trial; arid (4) that the application ‘is made in good faith and, is not

Nixon, 418 U.S. at 699-700. In other words, the proponent, of a, Rule I'7(c) subpoena “must clear

THE SUBPOENA FAILS TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 17(C€)

The Defendant cannot demonstrate that the Subpoena mects Rule 17(c)’s:requirements for:
four, independent reasons. J/:i«st, the Subpocna ‘is overbroad and non-specific, anda clear fishing’
expedition to “sce. what.may turn up.” See United States: ¥. Ayenatti, No. (S1)19.ER. 373 (PGG),
2020 WL. 86768, at *4. (S. DN.Y. Jan. 6, 2020) (denying motion for issuance of Rule: 17(c)
subpoena). “Subpocnas secking * any and. all’ materials, without.mention. of‘ specific admissible
evidence,’ justify the inference that. the defense is engaging ‘in, the type of ‘fishing expedition’
prohibited, by Nixon.’ United States ve. Mendinticta=lbarro, 956 F. Supp. ‘2d 5115 512=513
(S.D.N.Y. 2013) (interfial quotation. marks omitted). (grantifig motion. to quash. Rule 17(c)
subpoena).

Here, the Subpoena-plainly. fails Nixon’s specificity requirement. ‘Requests | through § all
seck: “communications” between “You” and a designated individual or entity, including the U.S.
Anon anid BSF’s co-counscl, about,a certain subject. The Subpoena défines “communications”
“all forms of correspondence, including regular:mail, email, text message, memorandum, or
other written. communication of information. of any kind,” ‘and defines. “You” as “any owncr,
sharcholder, partner or cmployce of Boies, Schiller, Flexner, LLP, including but. not. limited. fo
David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, ‘Peter Skinner and » any former owner, sharcholder, ‘partner or:
employee, or independent contractor of the firm.” Such broad. Requésts are:plainly overbroad and,
non-spceific, and do not meet the strictirequirements, of Rule 17(C). Sée,.@.8., Mendinueta-lharro,
