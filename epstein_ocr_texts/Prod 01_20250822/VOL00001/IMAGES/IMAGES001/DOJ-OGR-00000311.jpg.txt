II. The Claims Raised in the Petition Are Not Constitutionally Ripe, and. These
Proceedings Must Thus Be Dismissed for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction.

This Court. must also. dismiss these proceedings for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,
because the Petitioners’ claims are not: constitutionally: ripe.

Ripeness, like standing, “originate[s] from the Constitution’s Article II] requirement that
the jurisdiction of the federal courts be limited. to actual cases and controversies.” Elend vy.
Bashant, 471. F.3d 1199, 1204-05 (11th Cir. 2006). “*The ripeness doctrine keeps ‘federal courts
from deciding cases prematurely,’ Beaulien v.. City.of Alabaster, 454 F.3d 1219, 1227:(1.1th Cir.
2006), ‘and ‘protects. [them] from engaging. in, speculation or wasting thcir resources. through the
review of potential or abstract disputes,” Digital Props., Ine. %.-Cite of Plantation, 12.1 F.3d 586,
Pittman v., Cole, 267 F.3d. 1269, 1278 (11th Cir, 2001) (““The ripeness doctrine prevent[s] the
‘courts, through avoidance ‘of premature adjudication, from entangling, themselves in abstract.
disagreements ....’”) (quoting Coalition forthe Abolition of Marijuana, Prohibition vy. Gitv of
Atlanta, 219 F.3d 13014 1315 (11th Cir. 2000) (citations and quotations omitted))). Under the
ripeness doctrine, a. court must therefore: determine “whether there is sufficient injury to mect.
Article IIIs requirement of'.a, case or controversy ‘and, if, so, whether'the claim is. sufficiently.
mature, and the issues, sufficicntly defined and coriercte, to ‘permit. éfféctive decisionmaking by
the court.” Jn re. Jacks, 642 F.3d 1323, 1332 (11th Cir. 201 1) (quoting Gheffer v. Reno, 55 F.3d.
1517, 1524.(1 Ith Cir. 1995).

ooe

When. evaluating whether.a claim. is ripe, a:court considers: “*(1) the fitness of the issues
for judicial decision, and. (2), the hardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.”” Id.

(quoting Chéffer, 55 F.3d at.1524 (citing Abbott Labs. v Gardnér, 387 US. 136, 149 (1967)));
