count but also for a sex trafficking conspiracy count.
MR. WEINGARTEN: We have had good conversations with

the, presecutors, and we like and respect them. We are looking

forward to getting discovery; We dare interestéd to see whether

the prosecutors in Florida, who are now under severe criticism

10 years later, steered the alleged victims to New York,

whether or not they violdted their responsibilities under the

NPA.

THE COURT: Whether the federal prosecutors in Florida

violated their terms and conditions?

MR. WEINGARTEN: That will certainly be germane.

THE COURT: ‘Is that thé point?

MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes.

THE COURT: Got it.

MR. ROSSMILLER: Your Honor, if I could very briefly
respond to those points?

THE COURT: Sure,»

MR. ROSSMILLER: I expect. this will be briefed and
argued on Thursday. 2 don"t intend to go into extensive
details about that. I just, want to flag for the Court ‘that
defénsé counsel is saying that. this conduct, is ancient. What
he is not saying is it is beyond the statute of limitations,
because it 1s not.

Second, the allegation that this is some kind of a

conspiracy within thé Department of Justicé is just. false.
