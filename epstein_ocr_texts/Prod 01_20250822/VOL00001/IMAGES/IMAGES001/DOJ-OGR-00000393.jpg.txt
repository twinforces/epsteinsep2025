1 count but also for a sex trafficking conspiracy count.

2 MR. WEINGARTEN: We have had good conversations with

3 the prosecutors, and we like and respect them. We are looking
4 forward to getting discovery. We are interested to see whether
5 the prosecutors in Florida, who are now under severe criticism
6 10 years later, steered the alleged victims to New York,

7 whether or not they violated their responsibilities under the

8 NPA.

9 THE COURT: Whether the federal prosecutors in Florida
10 violated their terms and conditions?

11 MR. WEINGARTEN: That will certainly be germane.

12 THE COURT: Is that the point?

13 MR. WEINGARTEN: Yes.

14 THE COURT: Got it.

15 MR. ROSSMILLER: Your Honor, if I could very briefly
16 respond to those points?

17 THE COURT: Sure.

18 MR. ROSSMILLER: I expect this will be briefed and

19 argued on Thursday. I don't intend to go into extensive
20 details about that. I just want to flag for the Court that
21 defense counsel is saying that this conduct is ancient. What
22 he is not saying is it is beyond the statute of limitations,
23 because it is not.
24 Second, the allegation that this is some kind of a
25 conspiracy within the Department of Justice is just false.
