“Defendant is currently, or has been in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country
other than the United States.” Dkt. 23 at 2. |
Defense counsel contends that Defendant has one active passport that was surrendered
and that “Mr. Epstein has no foreign passports.” Dkt. 6 at 3 n. 3. With regard to the Austrian
passport, the Defense explains that “Epstein . . . acquired the passport in the 1980s, when
hijackings were prevalent, in connection to Middle East travel. The passport was for personal

hijackers or terrorists should violent episodes occur.” Dkt. 24 at 8. Details about how the |
passport was procured by Mr. Epstein in the name of another individual were not provided and

numerous ingress and egress stamps, including stamps that reflect use of the passport to enter |
France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia in the 1980s.” Dkt. 30. By submission
dated July 18, 2019, the Defense explains: “Epstein was given the passport at issue by a friend . . |

or customs authority. The passport stamps, predating his receipt of the document, do not reflect
Mr. Epstein’s entries or exits.” Dkt. 31.
Defense counsel has submitted a one page document called “Asset Summary - June 30,
