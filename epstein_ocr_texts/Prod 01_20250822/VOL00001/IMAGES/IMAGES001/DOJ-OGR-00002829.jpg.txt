A. Underrepresentation

The second element under,Duren éxamines whether the; groups’ representation. “in
venires from which juties are.selected is not fair and reasonable in-relation to the number of such
persons .in the community.” 439 U.S. at 364. To answer this question, however, the Court must
first define the relevant. variables, namely (a) the jury venire. and (b), the community.

is Relevant Jury Venire

The parties dispute which jury pool ought to be used to analyze the Defendant’s fair:
cross-section challenge. Schulte relies on United States v. Rioux,,97 F.3d. at 648, and.contends
that the White Plains qualified wheel:is the relevant jury venire. (Schulte Br. at 8.) The
Government argues that the White:Plains mastet wheel constitutes the appropriate jury venire.
(Gov't Opp. Br. at 15.) The Court agrees with, the Government.

“Neither the Suprerne Court:nor the Second, Circuit has defined the “relevant jury pool’

(examining caselaw); see also Allen, 2021 WL 43.1458 (stating that the “Second Circuit has*not
stated a preference for'the use of one Wheel over the other”). In Rioux, for example, the Second.
Circuit observed ‘that'the “relevant jury poo! may’ be defined by: (1)'the master list; (2), the
qualified wheel; (3) the venires; or (4) a combination of the three.” 97 F:3d ‘at 655-56.
Although the Rioux court did-:designate the.qualified jury: wheel as the relevant vénire,. see id.,
that conclusion. only followed because the parties agreed “that the qualified whecl-may serve as
the-relevant jury pool.” /d. That is not the case here, so the Court:finds Rioux to be of little
impact.

Instead, the Court concludes that the White.Plains master-wheel is the relevant jury

venire. As noted by the Government (Gov’t-Opp. Br. at 16-18) several district courts within this
