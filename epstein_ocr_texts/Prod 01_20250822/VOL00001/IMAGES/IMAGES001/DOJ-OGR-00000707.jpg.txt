1 I ask that you very seriously consider the final

2 decision, because it will undoubtedly affect all other facets

3 of this case, including any future charges brought against the
4 recruiters or third parties to his crimes. I do not want the

S narrative to be, Those poor girls. I want to send a message to
6 anyone who would consider engaging in similar acts to think

7 twice beforehand. I want some sort of closure for those of us
8 who relive those horrible moments where we were assaulted,

9 abused, and taken advantage of by Epstein.

10 You have the opportunity to help us seek that closure.
11 I appreciate your time and consideration and ask for your

12 continued support in dealing with this case to illustrate that
13 we, Epstein's victims, do matter.

14 Sincerely, Jane Doe 8.

15 On behalf of Lisa Bloom and The Bloom Firm, thank you,
16 your Honor.

17 THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Gibbs.

18 Did we have any other victim's counsel or victims?

19 Ms. Allred.
20 MS. ALLRED: Good morning, your Honor.
21 THE COURT: Good morning. How are you?
22 MS. ALLRED: Fine. Thank you.
