Dear Judge Nathan:
The Government respectfully submits this letter in connection with the Court’s Order of
March 24, 2021, regarding the defendant’s application for an order authorizing a subpoena
pursuant to Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for records from Boies Schiller
Flexner LLP (“BSF”). For the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully requests that
the Court (1) direct the defendant to provide the Government with a copy of the proposed subpoena
to BSF and notice of all existing and future applications for subpoenas under Rule 17(c) returnable
in advance of trial, and (2) direct that any productions made in response to Rule 17(c) subpoenas
be produced to the opposing party and marked confidential under the protective order.
I. Background
As the Court is aware, the Government has produced to the defendant more than 2.7 million
pages of discovery pursuant to the Government’s various discovery obligations, including Rule
16. The parties are also in discussions about the timing of further productions by the Government,
including material provided pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3500 and Giglio material.
