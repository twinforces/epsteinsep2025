7 developments in this case.

8 MR. ROSSMILLER: Yes, your Honor, we are acutely aware
9 of our obligations to the victims in this case. We have

10 notified them and we expect to continue to do so as the case

11 moves forward.

12 THE COURT: Second, for my background, I am aware that
13 there are certain conditions that attach to Mr. Epstein's sex
14 offender status resulting from his Florida state prosecution in

17 to be at high risk of committing another sex crime with minors.

19 MR. ROSSMILLER: Your Honor, as the government set
20 forth in its submission to Judge Pitman, and we copied this
21 Court, it is our understanding that the defendant is a tier 3
22 sex offender in New York and that that is characterized as
23 high-risk individual.
24 THE COURT: The guestion that I have is what are the
25 implications, if any, of the search conducted by the U.S.
