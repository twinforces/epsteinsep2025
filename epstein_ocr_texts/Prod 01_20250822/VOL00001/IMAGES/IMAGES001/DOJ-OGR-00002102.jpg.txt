Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97-21 Filed 12/14/20 Page 7 of 29
An overview of the timeframes in relation to US extradition requests

12. The timescales applicable to extradition proceedings are defined by statute and are set out in Annex D,
along with the circumstances in which the time-limits can be extended.

13. There are few publicly available figures with respect to the timescales in Part 2 extradition cases in
general, and none with respect to US extradition cases. In July 2013, the UK Government estimated that,
on average, Part 2 extradition cases took approximately 10 months to conclude*’. In practice, contested
US extradition cases can take longer than 10 months, although the majority conclude within two years.

14. These timescales are significantly reduced in cases such as this one where the requested person consents
to his or her extradition at an early stage in the process. In those cases, extradition would be likely to take
place within three months.

B. Consent to extradition

15. At the initial hearing where a requested person is first produced before the court, the appropriate judge is
required to give them “the required information about consent”’**. This information is: (a) that the person
may consent to extradition; (b) an explanation of the effect of consent and the procedure that will apply if
consent is given; and (c) that consent must be given in writing and is irrevocable”.

16. Where consent is given before the case has been sent to the Secretary of State, it must be given at a
hearing before the appropriate judge*’. Once the case has been sent to the Secretary of State, consent must
be given to the Secretary of State*!.

17. Where consent is given before the case is sent to the Secretary of State, the consequences are as follows:

(a) If the appropriate judge has not fixed a date for the extradition hearing, they are not required to do
so”;

(b) If the extradition hearing has begun, the appropriate judge is no longer required to proceed with
it®;
