that will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other
person and the community.” The evidence submitted herewith relates directly to factors on
which the Court relied in its initial detention order. Among the bases for the Court’s initial order
denying bail were its findings that:

* Ms. Maxwell’s lack of “significant family ties” in the United States suggested

“that flight would not pose an insurmountable burden for her” (Tr. 84):
¢ the Court lacked “a clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the resources
available to her” that would allow it to set reasonable bail conditions (Tr. 87);
* “\clircumstances of her arrest ... may cast some doubt on the claim that she
was not hiding from the government” (Tr. 85);

¢ Ms. Maxwell “is a citizen of France, a nation that does not appear to extradite

its citizens” (Tr. 83): and

* the government had proffered that its “witness testimony will be corroborated

by significant contemporaneous documentary evidence” (Tr. 82).

The additional evidence submitted herewith demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell does have
significant family ties in the United States; that her assets have been thoroughly disclosed and
reasonable bail conditions can be set; that Ms. Maxwell has never attempted to hide from the
government; that Ms. Maxwell has waived her extradition rights and it is highly likely she would
be extradited from the United Kingdom or France; and that the government’s case against her is
not supported by the corroborating documentary evidence which the government represented at
the initial hearing.

The evidence submitted herewith is significant and substantial, and it could not have
reasonably been obtained, assembled, and submitted in the 12 days between Ms. Maxwell’s
airest and her initial detention hearing. This evidence has a material bearing on whether
reasonable bail conditions can be set, and it shows that the proposed set of conditions will
reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in court.
