treatment of the victims, reflected.poorly onthe Department as a whole, and is contradictory to the
Department’s mission to :minimize ‘the frustration and, confusion that victims of. a crime endure.

OPR. determiricd that rione .of the subjcets ‘was. :rcsponsible for communications scnt to
certain victims. after the NPA was signcd that described the case as:“under:investigation” and. that.
failed to inform them, of the NPA. The letters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who
was not. directly involved. in the investigation, incorporated standard form language ‘used. by the
FBI when communicating ‘with victims, and were not. drafted or reviewed by the ‘subjects.
Moreover; the statenient that the matter was “under investigation” ‘was not ‘false: because the
government in ‘fact continued to investigate the case ‘in. anticipation that Epstcin:would not fulfill.
the terms.of the NPA. ‘However, the letters risked-misleading the victims and contributed to victim.
frustration, and. confusion by failing to provide ‘important ‘information, about the status of the
Investigation. The, letters also demonstrated, a ‘lack of coordination, between, the, federal agencics
responsible for communicating ‘with Epstein’s victims and showed. a lack of attention. to, and,
oversight regarding, communication With. victims.

After the NPA, was signed, Acosta. clected to defer to: the State Attorney: the decision,
whether to notify victims about the :state’s plea. hearing pursuant tothe state’s own-victim’s rights
requirements. Although .Acosta’s decision ‘was ‘within his authority’ and. did. not constitute
‘professional misconduct, OPR concludes that. Acosta exercised poor judgment. when he failed to
make certain. that the state intended. to and would notify: victims identified through the federal
investigation about the stateplea. hearing. His decision. left victims uninformed.about an important.
procecding that resolved the federal. investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had.
communicated, with victims for months. ‘It also ‘ultimately created the misimpression. that; the:
Department intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure ‘that’victims were
made aware. ofa court proceeding ‘that was. rclated to their own cases, and thus he ‘failed to ensure
that victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.

OPR, concludes that the decision to’‘postpone notifying victims, about the terms of the NPA,
after ‘it. was signed and the omission of information about the NPA. during victim interviews and.
conversations ‘with victims® attorneys in. 2008: do not constitute professional misconduct.
‘Contemporancous records show:that these-actions-were based on: strategic concerns about creating
impeachment evidence that Epstein; s victims ‘had financial, motives to .make: claims: against him,
evidence that could ‘be used. against victims ‘at a trial, and, were ‘not for the purpose of silencing
victims. Noncthcless, the failure to reevaluate the strategy prior ‘to, interviews of victims and.
discussions ‘with victims’ attorneys occurring in 2008 léd ‘to interactions that contributed. to
victims’ feclings that the. government was ‘intentionally concealing information from them.

After examining: the full scope and context ‘of the government’s intcractions with victims,
OPR concludes that. the government’s lack of transparency and its inconsistent messages led, to
victims feeling confused and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and the public the

misimpression ‘that the government had colluded ‘with Epstein’s counsel. to keep the NPA secret.
from: the victims, and undercut public confidence i in nthe qegitimacy of the resulting agreement: The

‘that the. ‘victims ' ‘were “not ‘treated with ‘the forthrighiness. and sensitivity expected by. ‘the
Department.
