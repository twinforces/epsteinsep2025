B. Danger to Obstruct Justice

The defendant has also already demonstrated a willingness to use intimidation and
aggressive tactics in connection with a criminal investigation. Far from being “musty,” Release
Motion at 6 n.6, the defendant’s past behavior in connection with being investigated for sexually
abusing children is the best predictor of his likely incentives and activities in connection with being
charged with sexually abusing children. For example, in the incident the defendant now claims
was not attributable to or authorized by him, the contemporaneous police report indicates that
pressure tactics were at the very least coordinated closely with individuals in the defendant’s orbit.
See Palm Beach Police Report (the “Police Report’) (Ex. B). According to the Police Report, the
parent of one of the defendant’s victims was driven off the road by a private investigator. The
Police Report provides further information regarding victim and witness threats and intimidation
reported against an individual who was directly in contact with an assistant of the defendant,
followed “immediately” by a call to that same individual from a phone number associated with the
defendant’s businesses and associates.

Separately, and in addition, there are also extensive allegations of obstruction and
tampering in connection with civil lawsuits brought against the defendant following his 2008
conviction. See Doe v. United States, 08 Civ. 80736 (S.D. Fla.), Dkt. 291-15 at 21-23, 31.
Moreover, police reports suggest that an associate of Epstein’s was offering to buy victims’ silence
during the course of the prior investigation. Specifically, one victim reported that “she was
personally contacted through a source that has maintained contact with Epstein,” who “assured
[the victim] that she would receive monetary compensation for her assistance in not cooperating
with law enforcement.” Indeed, the victim reported having been told: “Those who help him will
be compensated and those who hurt him will be dealt with.”’ See Palm Beach Police Report
(Ex. C).

And Epstein’s efforts to influence witnesses continue to this day. As in the past, within
recent months. he paid significant amounts of money to influence individuals who were close to
him during the time period charged in this case and who might be witnesses against him at a trial.
By way of background, on or about November 28, 2018, the Miami Herald began publishing a
series of articles relating to the defendant, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior
conviction and the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). Records obtained by the Government
from Institution-1 appear to show that just two days later, on or about November 30, 2018, the
defendant wired $100,000 from a trust account he controlled to an individual named as a possible
co-conspirator in the NPA. The same records appear to show that just three days after that, on or
about December 3, 2018, the defendant wired $250,000 from the same trust account to another
individual named as a possible co-conspirator in the NPA and also identified as one of the
defendant’s employees in the Indictment. Neither of these payments appears to be recurring or
repeating during the approximately five years of bank records presently available to the
Government. This course of action, and in particular its timing, suggests the defendant was
attempting to further influence co-conspirators who might provide information against him in light
of the recently re-emerging allegations
