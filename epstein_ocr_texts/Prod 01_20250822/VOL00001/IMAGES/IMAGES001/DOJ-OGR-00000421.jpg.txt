1 So this is a huge problem for the department and what
2 solution ensues, and I suggest the solution that ensued is this
i) indictment. To us, this indictment is essentially a do-over.

4 The allegations are from 2002 to 2005. This is old stuff.

5 This is ancient stuff. This is the very stuff that was

6 investigated by the feds in Florida, a sophisticated three-year
7 investigation. Two of the alleged victims in this indictment

8 are from Florida. The indictment here tracks the conduct that
9 was investigated in Florida back before the agreement was

10 reached. Obviously we need to get discovery to find out just
11 how inextricably Linked the investigation back in Florida is

12 with what's going on here. We do know we are talking about

13 ancient conduct. We do know we are talking about facts that

14 are from 2002 to 2005, facts that were known to the United

15 States prosecutors before they entered into the NPA, the

16 declination. This is essentially a redo. That's how it feels
17 to us. And if we are correct, that should chill the blood of
18 every defense attorney who negotiates a deal with the United

19 States.
20 In addition, we have -- the central allegation here is
21 trafficking, and obviously it is useful and relevant to make
22 inquiry as to why the trafficking law was passed. It is to
23 cover abhorrent conduct, where young girls are kidnapped, they
24 are fooled, they are forced to come usually to unfamiliar
25 places, work in brothels where they service 15, 20 guys ina
