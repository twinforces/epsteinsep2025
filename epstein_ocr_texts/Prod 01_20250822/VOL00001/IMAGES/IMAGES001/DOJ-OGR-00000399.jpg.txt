1 negotiating that agreement, which again did not include the

2 Southern District of New York. We don't expect that to be any
5 impediment at all here.

4 THE COURT: Got it.

5 This is a small item. In the pretrial services report
6 which was prepared today -- how many, if more than one,

7 passports does Mr. Epstein have?

8 MR. WEINGARTEN: Mr. Epstein reported today one. Two
9 others were rescinded. As we understand it, there is one

10 effective passport today.

11 I would like to make one other point about the

12 pretrial that is extremely important.

13 THE COURT: Go ahead.

14 MR. WEINGARTEN: The way it reads is that we have

15 refused to provide information about income and assets.

16 THE COURT: I didn't really read it that way myself.
17 I thought it was incomplete in some places and I thought it

18 could be beefed up, so to speak. But I imagine that in the

19 bail application those matters may be dealt with.
20 MR. WEINGARTEN: Exactly.
21 THE COURT: For Mr. Rossmiller: In your letter you
22 describe some obstruction or harassment, witness tampering,
28 alleged, by Mr. Epstein. That, I take it, is going to be
24 included in any response or any bail submission made by the
25 government?
