INTRODUCTION

Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Third
Motion for Release on Bail.

As Ms. Maxwell has stated on numerous occasions and reaffirms here: she has no
intention or desire to leave this country. She is an American citizen, has lived in United States
for 30 years, has strong family ties and the support of friends and family residing in this country.
She wants nothing more than to remain in the United States under whatever conditions the Court
deems necessary so that she can effectively prepare for trial and vigorously defend against the
25-year-old charges in the Indictment. Ms. Maxwell has already proposed an expansive and, to
our knowledge, unprecedented set of bail conditions that would reasonably assure her
appearance. (See Dkt. 97.) In light of the Court’s denial of that application (see Dkt. 106), Ms.
Maxwell now proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the extraordinarily
restrictive bail package she has already offered.

e First, Ms. Maxwell will renounce her French and British citizenship to eliminate
any opportunity for her to seek refuge in those countries, if the Court so requires.

e Second, Ms. Maxwell will have her and her spouse’s assets—excluding funds
earmarked for living expenses, for legal fees and other expenses necessary to
defend her against the criminal charges in this case and related civil lawsuits and
for taxes—placed in a new account that will be monitored by a retired federal
District Court judge and former United States Attorney who will function as asset
monitor and will have co-signing authority over the account.

The former condition goes well beyond the extradition waivers that the Court deemed
insufficient and should satisfy any concerns the Court may have that Ms. Maxwell may try to
seek a safe haven in France or the United Kingdom. (See id. at 11-13). As a non-citizen, Ms.
Maxwell will not be able to avail herself of any protections against extradition that may apply to
