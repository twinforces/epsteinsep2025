Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 103 Filed 12/23/20 Page 13 of 15

as Mr. Julié’s accompanying rebuttal report explains (see Ex. A), the MOJ letter ignores that the
extradition provisions in French Code of Criminal Procedure apply only in the absevice of an
international agréement providing otherwise. (Id. at 1). This rule is.necessitated by the French.
Constitution, which requires that international agreements prevail over‘national legislation. (/d.)..
‘Thus,:éxtradition. ofa. French-national to the United States is legally permissible if the extradition
treaty between the United States and France provides for it—which it does. (/d. at 3).

The government’s reliance:on a 2006'case—in which France refused to extradite a
French national who.was also-a U.S. citizen—provides no precedent as to how. a French court
would-tule on.an extradition request regarding: Ms. Maxwell because, as Mr. Julié:notes; the
United States did not challenge the refusal. in the French courts. (/d. at 2-3). Nor does it
undermine Mr. Julié’s opinion that, in the unusual circumstance where a citizen of both.countries
has executed an extradition waiver and then fled to France in violation of bail conditions set by a
US. court, it is “highly unlikely” that an extradition decree would not be issued. (Id! at 3).

The government offers no rebuttal to the opinion of Ms. Maxwell’s U.K. exiradition
expert,. David Perry. Nor:does it.dispute Mr. Perry’s opinion. that Ms. Maxwell would be “highly
unlikely” to-successfully:resist extradition from the United.Kingdom, that her waiver would be
admissible‘in any extradition proceeding, and that—contrary:to the government’s representation
at the initial bail hearing (Tr: 27)—bail would be “extremely unlikely.” (See. Def. Mem. Ex. U at
q 39). Mr: Perry’s addendum opinion (attached as Ex, B) reiterates these points, opining that the:
waiver would be‘a.highly relevant factor” in the U.K. proceeding, both-to the-likelihood of

-extradition and to the likelihood of bail while the proceeding is pending. (Id: | 3).

T Noi, as thé goveriiment'suggests, does the Secretary of Staté have. general “discretion to deny'extradition” aftéra
court has entered a final extradition order. (See Gov. Mem. at 19).. That discretion is limited to a. handful of
exceptional :circumstances that would likely: be inapplicable to.Ms:.Maxwell "S$ CASE. Cd. 994-5).
