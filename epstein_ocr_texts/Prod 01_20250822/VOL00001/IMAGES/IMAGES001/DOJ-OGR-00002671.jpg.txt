Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 144 Filed 02/04/21 Page 23.0f 25

Nor does §.3283. apply to extend the statutes of limitations ‘under Counts Three. and Four.
Those counts arise under. 1'8 U.S.C; § 2423(a), which:prohibits “transporting” minors across. state:
lines. “with. intent'that:the [minor] engage ‘in .... any sexual activity for-which any person can.be
charged with a.criminal, offense” (emphasis added).° ‘Neither that offense nor a conspiracy to
“transport” a minor'with such intent necessarily entails “the sexual. or physical. abuse, or
kidnaping, ofa child.” 18 U.S.C, § 3283. ‘Instead, as with § 2422(a), the offense:is a“*crime of
intent and a conviction is entirely sustainable even if'no underlying criminal sexual, act: ever
occurs.” United States v. Broxmeyer, 61.6 F.3d 120,129 n.8 (2d Cir. 2010). For this reason,
Counts Three and Four are not subject:to § 3283’s extended statute of limitations.

It-does not matter that the ‘particular facts alleged in/the indictment fall within, § 3283.
“The embellishment of'the indictment does not.lengthen:the time for prosecution.” Bridges, 346
U.S. at 222. Nor does it matter that sexual abuse of'a minor may “often accompan[y]” the
offenses charged. Seé id. “[U]nder the statiite[s] creating the offense[s],” physical or sextal
abuse of a minor, or kidnapping, is not “an essential. ingredient.” Jd. Thus, § 3283’s extension
‘for. “offense[s] involving the sexual. or’ physical abuse, or kidnaping, of: a child under the age of

18. years” docs not apply.

” 18 U.S.C. § 2423 was amended effective September 13, 1994, to.add.a subsection.(b).and make cosmetic
adjustments, immaterial:here, to: what is now subsection (a). Violent Crime Control.and Law Enforcement Act of
1994. PL. 103- 322, Sept. 13, 1994, Litke-X VI, § 160001(g),.108 Stat. 1796.
