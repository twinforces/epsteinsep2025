Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97-21 Filed 12/14/20 Page 6 of 29

9. A requested person may appeal the decision of the appropriate judge to send the case to the Secretary
of State, the decision of the Secretary of State to order extradition, or both’*, except in consent cases
where the person is deemed to have waived their rights of appeal”. Where the requested person is
discharged at the extradition hearing or by the Secretary of State, the requesting government may
appeal the decision to discharge*’. Extradition appeals are heard by the High Court. An appeal may be
brought on a question of law or fact and may not be brought unless the court grants leave to appeal
which requires the Appellant to establish that there is a reasonably arguable ground of appeal*’.

10. Either party may appeal a decision of the High Court to the Supreme Court, but only where the High
Court has certified that the decision involves a point of law of general public importance, and either
the High Court or the Supreme Court concludes that the point is one that ought to be considered by the
Supreme Court®”. Where leave is granted, the Supreme Court may either grant the appeal, or dismiss
it’. In practice, such appeals are extremely rare; in the past ten years, only one US extradition case
has been considered by the Supreme Court™.

11. In some cases, a requested person may apply to the European Court of Human Rights and seek an
injunction to prevent the extradition from taking place until the application is determined®. Such
applications, which must be based on an alleged violation of a right under the ECHR”, are also very
rare.
