Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 456-457 (1995) (Sealia,
J., dissenting) (citing Graver Tank & Mfg. Co. v. Linde
Air Prods. Co., 336 U.S. 271, 275 (1949)).

2. Petitioner nevertheless urges (Pet. 7-12) the Court
to grant a writ of certiorari in this case to resolve as-
serted disagreement in the courts of appeals over how
broadly references to “the United States” or “the gov-
ernment” in a plea agreement should be read. That con-
tention is likewise misplaced.

The Second and Seventh Circuits have stated that a
promise regarding a defendant’s prosecution on behalf
of “the government” or “the United States” by default
“binds only the office of the United States Attorney for
the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirm-
atively appears that the agreement contemplates a
broader restriction.” United States v. Annabi, T71 F.2d
670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam); see Rourke, 74 F.3d
at 807 & n.5 (7th Cir.). And in the Third, Fourth, and
Eighth Circuits, “when a United States Attorney * * *
contracts on behalf of ‘the United States’ or ‘the Gov-
ernment’ in a plea agreement for specific crimes, that
attorney speaks for and binds all his or her fellow
United States Attorneys * * * absent express contrac-
tual limitations or disavowals to the contrary.” Gebbie,
294 F.3d at 550 (8d Cir.); see United States v. Carter,
454 F.2d 426, 428 (4th Cir. 1972) (en banc), cert. denied,
417 U.S. 933 (1974); United States v. Van Thournout,
100 F.3d 590, 594 (8th Cir. 1996).”

2 Petitioner appears to acknowledge (Pet. 10-11) that the Ninth
Circuit has not expressly addressed the matter at issue here. In
Thomas v. Immigration & Naturalization Service, 35 F.3d 1332
(1994), a cooperation agreement “plainly and unambiguously * * *
bound the INS,” zd. at 1337, so no need existed to address a more
