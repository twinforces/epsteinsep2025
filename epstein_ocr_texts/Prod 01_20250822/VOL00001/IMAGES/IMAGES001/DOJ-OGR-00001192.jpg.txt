counts (Counts Two and Four) are based on the testimony of only one witness, Minor Victim-1.
It is also telling that the government does not even attempt to rebut the defense’s assertion that it
did not begin issuing subpoenas for documents related to Ms. Maxwell until just after the death
of Jeffrey Epstein. This confirms that the case against Ms. Maxwell was assembled after the fact

“outcry” witnesses who will corroborate a contemporaneous account of abuse from one or more of the accusers.
Instead, they will testify only that “both [Ms. Maxwell] and Epstein knew and interacted with certain minor victims
when those victims were minors.” (/d.). Again, the fact that Ms. Maxwell may have “met and interacted with”
someone when they were a minor proves absolutely nothing.
