Re: United States'v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr..330 (AJN)
Rule.17 Subpoena.to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP.

Dear Judge Nathan:

I write on behalf of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (“BSF”) with respect to Defendant.
Ghislaine. Maxwell’s:motion for an.order authorizing a subpocna‘on BSF pursuant.to. Rule. 1 7(c)(3)
of the Federal. Rules of Criminal. Procedure (the “Subpoena”) and the Court’s March. 12, 2021,
Sealed.and. £x. Parte Order requiring BSF to file a lettcr:indicating (1) whether service on BSF can.
be deemed ‘adequate notice on victims whose ‘personal or confidential ‘information, the Subpoena.
is aimed at obtaining and (2) whether the victims object to or:scck modification of the Subpoena.

Eirst, BSF does not.object to service on.BSF constituting adequate notice on any-victims it:
represents. The Order and. Subpoena, however, do nof indicate which, victims are to be ‘provided.
with notice. The Order states that the Defendant identified five individuals who require notice,
but the Subpoena appears to seck personal and confidential information about all of” the Epstein
victims that BSF represents, which.is more than five individuals. Thus, inan abundance of caution,
BSF will notify cach of. the Epstcin. victims it represents, unless. otherwise directed. by the court.
Second, BSF, both on its own, behalf and ‘behalf of the women that. it represents, objects to the
Subpoena.in its. entirety for the following reasons.

BACKGROUND

The Government in this case has charged the Defendant with enticing (and conspiracy to
entice) minors.'to travel,'to engage in illegal, sex ‘acts. and transportation of (and. conspiracy to
transport) ‘minors with ‘intent ‘to engage in criminal sexual activity from 1994 to 1997. The facts
underlying. those charges involve three minor victims: ‘Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and
‘Minor Victim-3. The Government has also charged the Defendant with two counts of perjury for
lying under oath during.a civil.deposition in a defamation action brought by Virginia Giuffre:when
asked if she was aware of Jeffrey Epstcin’s sex trafficking scheme and whether she‘had ever given.
Minor Victim-2:a massage. BSF represents Minor Victim=2 (Annie Farmer).and Virginia Giuffre,
but does. not represent and.has never represented Minor Victim-, or Minor Victim-3.

Defendant: has made clear since the: time of her arrest that. she seeks to impugn the:
credibility of her accusers by constructing .a, false ‘narrative ‘that. BSF’s: cooperation with the
