Re:

Dear Hon. Judge Berman?

I come. forward to-you-today in disdain, disgust and fear of how the United. States of
America’s DOJ has handled the promise‘to release the “Epstein Files”. Out of respect for the
court, I will keep this short, to, the point: and as direct. as ‘possible. It has been, a very difficulf.time

use quotations: because what are these “Files” exactly, anyway?”

I-regrettably feel the need to come forward and shed some light on the Government’s
motion:to unseal transcripts, documents and exhibits from the “case” that was newver'tried. ‘Sad to
say, for the victims wé never got our day in court. Apparently, Epstein killed himsélf under
‘whose watch? Oh, was it Trump’s. DOJ? Hmmm, interesting..Although, | am for complete. and
utter transparency in this. case, we deserve transparency from our own government, the agencies
that were supposed to be. there to protect us victims and. guess what, they utterly and completely
failed us. Unfortunately, with their disregard for the victims | feel. it-is imperative:to write this
léetter‘to the court.

Becausé, | personally desire-to remain anonymous ‘I feel like ] do not have a-voice.
Therefore, with. it being myright to have an opinion as.a Victiin in this, mattér ] have a voiceto
‘speak’ to the court and'to the United States.

Dear United States, T wish you would have handled ‘and would handle the whole “Epstein
Files” with more respect towards and for the victims. I‘am.not some’ pawn. in your political
warfare. What-you have done.and continue to do is eating at me day after day.as you help to
perpetuate this story indefinitely. Why-not be:completely transparent? Show us all the files with
only the necessary redactions! Be done. with.it and allow ine/us to.heal. You protect:yourself and
your powerful and wealthy “friends” (not,enemies) over the ‘victims, why? T he victims know*the
truth, we know‘who are in the files and.now: so do you. Do you really. think: the! public: 1s, that

Silent and coritinue to hide. from.all the pain and suffering, out.of fear of you and your wealthy:
‘powerful “friends”. In the end we. are thé biggest voices of the truth and the truth always. comes
out. in time.
