this as a weighty factor”. Second, a court would be likely to consider that the interests of the
victims’’ would be best served by a trial in the United States. The High Court has held that the
interests of victims” “will be in having a trial at a place where, if they do give evidence or wish to be

34. It is highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to establish that her physical or mental condition

is such that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite her*'. In order to rely on her physical or
mental health in opposition to extradition, Ms Maxwell would need to serve evidence sufficient to
meet the statutory test. Most cases in the ‘unjust’ category relate to the persons’ fitness to plead to

and stress and hardship, which occur in most extradition cases, are not sufficient®’. Even in cases
where the requested person suffers from a serious medical conditions, it is often possible for the
requesting state gives an assurance as to the medical care that will be provided™, or an undertaking to
return an individual if they are later found to be unfit to plead*, and thus ensure that extradition is
possible notwithstanding the requested person’s medical problems.
