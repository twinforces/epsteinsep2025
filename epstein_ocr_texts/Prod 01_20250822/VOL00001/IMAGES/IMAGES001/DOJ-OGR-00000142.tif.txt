disqualifying Maxwell’s chosen counsel based on their
involvement in the earlier civil case.

Rule 14(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
allows a court to order separate trials if joining
all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the
defendant. A defendant seeking severance must show
significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the
court of conducting multiple trials. United States v.
Walker, 142 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir. 1998). The harm to
the defendant must be more than “solely the adverse
effect of being tried for two crimes rather than one.”
United States v. Werner, 620 F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir.
1980). Though this standard is demanding, the Court
concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury
counts, Maxwell meets it here. Trying all counts
together would compromise Maxwell’s right to the
counsel of her choice and risk an unfair trial.

Trying the perjury counts together with the Mann
Act counts would risk an unfair trial on each set of
counts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations
of sexual abuse, which would potentially expose the
jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible.
In particular, a joint trial would potentially expose the
jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil
litigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s
charged conduct. This presents a significant risk that
the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various
crimes charged and find guilt when, if considered
separately, it would not do so. See United States v.
Halper, 590 F.2d 422, 430 (2d Cir. 1978). Second, the
evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may
prejudice the jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s
truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of the
perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting
