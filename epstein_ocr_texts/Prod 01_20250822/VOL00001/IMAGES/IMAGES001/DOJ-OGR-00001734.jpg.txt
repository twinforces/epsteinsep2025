Government in. discovery i in,this criminal, case, and to’which,the protective: order unquestionably:
applies, fo litigate her Civil Cases. There ‘is no basis to:modify the Protective Order here.

Second, there is good reason.why both partics: proposed, andthe Court ordered, a protéctive
order that prevents the defendant ftom using matcrials obtained through the process of criminal
discovery i in. any” of the many civil ‘cases in, which, she is, or:could become, a party. To allow the
defendant. to do so would. permit, the dissemination, ofa, vast, swath of materials, ‘including those
that are confidential due to'witness privacy: interests, ‘personal identifying information of third
‘parties, and relevance in.ongoing grand.jury:investigations. Here, the Government was particularly
cconcerned.about the defendant’s interests in blurring these lines because, among other reasons, her
counsel. ;in the criminal case are: also ‘her counscl jin the Givil ‘Cases. ‘It would. be grossly:
‘inappropriate for defense counscl to be permitted to sift, through, the criminal, case discovery, and.
cherry-pick, materials they may believe could ‘provide some advantage in. their efforts to defend.
against,accusations of abuse by ‘victim plaintiffs, delay court-ordered disclosure of previously-
scaled materials, or any-other Icgal cffort'the. defendant may be undertaking at any particular'time.
And. yet that is what the defendant proposes.

Lhird, the specific documents at issuc ‘pertain, to ex parte applications made. as ‘part of an,
ongoing erand. j jury investigation. Those: documents were filed under séal arid presently remain
under, scal ‘because. the relevant judicial officers have. ordered ‘that. all filings regarding those
matters, including the discovery materials referenced.in. the Defense Letter, remain.scaled.* As
the U.S. Attorney’s Office: for the Southern, District of New York, has stated. publicly, the
investigation into the conduct of the defendant iin, this case and other possible:co-conspirators of
Jeffrey Epstein remains active. The full scope and details of that investigation, however, have not:
becn.madepublic.? Accordingly, ‘the, matétials the defendant secksto file inthe Civil. Cases. were
produced under a “Confidential” designation. Any argument ‘that such ‘materials: are not

misapprehends the: importance of maintaining » the confidentiality of criminal investigations.® See,

3 The only: exceptions to'those scaling orders are (I) as noted. above, the permission from. Court-1
to provide the April 2019 order alone to'the Recipient, and, (2) pursuant to separate permissions
the Government has ‘obtained. in connection with its discovery ‘obligations, that the entirety of the
record. relating to the Subpoenas may be provided to the defendant as discovery in this case. The
defendant’s claim that the relevant materials were produced to the defendant, in discovery without.
any application to the sealing courts, Def. Ltr. at 7, 1s incorrect.

*To the extent it would be uscful. to this Court for the: Government ‘to further claborate on the:
nature of the ongoing grand.jury investigation, the Government. is prepared to file-a. supplemental.
Ictter specifically on, that, subject ex. parte and. under seal should the Court. request. such. an.
‘explanation.

* Morcover, ‘if counsel for the .defendant:in her Givil Gases believe that certain documents: are

improperly sealed, there is no impediment to counsel making ‘scaled. applications to Court-I and.
Court-2, respectively, to unscal the relevant'materials. Presumably they have not,done so because
