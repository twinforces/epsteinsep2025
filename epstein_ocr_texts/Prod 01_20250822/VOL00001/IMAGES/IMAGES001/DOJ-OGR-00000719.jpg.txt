1 He forcefully penetrated me. I was numb. There was

2 pain, but his use of the vibrator and his fingers in previous

3 sessions with me had left a black hole-like void between my

4 legs. I protested, but he forced my face into the bed to

5 stifle my cries. That was my first time.

6 I got a few hundred dollars, as usual, as he led me

7 out of his mansion with assurances that I was on the right path
8 guided by him. I lied to myself and tried to believe him. I

9 became a hollow shell. If I missed an appointment, he

10 threatened me and let me know who was in charge. "Do you know
11 how important my time is? I'll bury you. I owe this -- I

12 won't say the word -- Fting town." He would hang up.

13 I would stand there frozen in the street, terrified

14 that his assistant would call to reschedule. I made sure to

15 stay in line and not disobey him. I was in complete denial.

16 Being paid after every scheduled meeting felt routine and

17 disgusting. He was the master of the universe and the world

18 bent to his will.

19 He would eventually brag to his assistants about my
20 ability to please him sexually right in front of me, leaving me
al feeling grotesque and worthless. Everything in my outside life
22 was falling apart. I distanced myself from friends and grew
23 further away from my family. I felt less human after each
24 ordeal. My psyche broke down completely and wouldn't let me
25 continue.
