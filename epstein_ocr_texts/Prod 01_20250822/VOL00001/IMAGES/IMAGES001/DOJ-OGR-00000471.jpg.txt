Re: US v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 CR 490 GDNY) (RMB)
Dear Judge Berman:

Jettrey Epstein replies to yesterday’s government letter.

Epstein was given the passport at issue by a friend. Some Jewish-Americans were informally
advised at the time to carry identification bearing a non-Jewish name when traveling internationally in
case of hijacking. He never used the document to travel internationally and never presented it to any
immigration or customs authority. The passport stamps, predating his receipt of the document, do
not reflect Mr. Epstein’s entries or exits. His expired US passports, seized by the government and in
its possession, would verity his true travel. The defense has asked the government to bring the original
document to court for examination and inspection.

As Mr. Epstein truthfully reported in his Pretrial Services interview, he is a lite-long American
citizen. He has no other citizenship or legal permanent residency.

Respectfully,
Martin Weinberg
