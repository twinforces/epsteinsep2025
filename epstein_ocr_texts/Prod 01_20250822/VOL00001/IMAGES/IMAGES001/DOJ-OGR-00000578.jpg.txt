‘Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 68of74 68
case.

Second, there's an inherent contradiction \between the
government's tying these two payments by Mr. Epstein ‘in
Novembér and edrly Décémber Of 2018 to witnessés as if these
are akin to an attempt to influence a witness.

If the government's position has any reality to it,
that Mr. Epstein reads an article and perceives that a friend
may be a witness, then that. provides pretty strong evidence
that Mr. Epstein was concerned about an investigation.

Even if the government. kept it. secret and yet he

repedtedly flew not, just out of the country but. into the
country with the knowledge, with the belief, again, if ‘the
government can tie these payments to an understanding; an

intent to effect a future investigation, that provides. fairly

eloquent evidence, your Honor, that. Mr. Epstein does not intend
toe flee.

And his conduct bétweén Noveniber dnd December 3, 2018,
and the present. is the antithesis of a defendant who wants ‘to
flee. He was arrested flying into Teterboro from, Europe.

Lastly, Mr. Joseph Jaffe is here, your Honor. If
your Honor in any way wantéd him to inform the Court what
services he and his company can provide to better or to be one

of the multiple conditions that. we've offered the Court as a

Gondition of release, he is Here.

THE COURT: TI could ask you through him or him
