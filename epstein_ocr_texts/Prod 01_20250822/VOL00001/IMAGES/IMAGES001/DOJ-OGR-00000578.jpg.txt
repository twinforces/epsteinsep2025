1 case.

2 Second, there's an inherent contradiction between the
3 government's tying these two payments by Mr. Epstein in

4 November and early December of 2018 to witnesses as if these

5 are akin to an attemot to influence a witness.

6 If the government's position has any reality to it,

7 that Mr. Epstein reads an article and perceives that a friend
8 may be a witness, then that provides pretty strong evidence

9 that Mr. Epstein was concerned about an investigation.

10 Even if the government kept it secret and yet he

11 repeatedly flew not just out of the country but into the

12 country with the knowledge, with the belief, again, if the

13 government can tie these payments to an understanding, an

14 intent to effect a future investigation, that provides fairly
15 eloquent evidence, your Honor, that Mr. Epstein does not intend
16 to flee.

17 And his conduct between November and December 3, 2018,
18 and the present is the antithesis of a defendant who wants to
19 flee. He was arrested flying into Teterboro from Europe.
20 Lastly, Mr. Joseph Jaffe is here, your Honor. lf
al your Honor in any way wanted him to inform the Court what
22 services he and his company can provide to better or to be one
23 of the multiple conditions that we've offered the Court as a
24 condition of release, he is here.
25 THE COURT: I could ask you through him or him
