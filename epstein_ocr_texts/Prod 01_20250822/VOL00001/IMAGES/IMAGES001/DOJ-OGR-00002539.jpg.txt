asserted. “legitimate and Icgally'supportable:positions throughout-this litigation, ” and therefore had.
not litigated in. bad faith. The court also noted it expected the government ‘to “honor its,

prior to the government charging a,case” and thus,. “the CVRA.was not triggered. in [the Southern,
District. of Florida] because no criminal charges, were brought.” ‘Nevertheless, during’ oral
argument, the government conceded that ‘the USAO had.-not been “fully transparent” with. the
petitioner and had. “made. a mistake in. causing her to belicve that the case was ongoing ‘when in.

the petition, ruling that CVRA ‘rights do not. attach until a.defendant has been criminally charged.
