1 today. I'll note that in light of the court's order indicating
2 that the victims and their counsel would be permitted to be

3 heard in court here today, the government has endeavored to

4 provide notice to all known victims of today's proceeding. We
5 did so either directly where a victim was not represented by

6 counsel or through counsel where a victim is represented by an
7 attorney.

8 The government does not know exactly how many victims
9 or their attorneys are here today and we do not know how many
10 of them or their counsel would like to speak. To the extent

11 any individuals do wish to speak, we do not know the substance
12 of what they would like to say. We have left that entirely up
13 to the individual decisions of the victims and their attorneys.
14 I will note, though, that throughout this case, the

15 government has endeavored and done our utmost to fulfill our

16 obligations under the Crimes Victims' Rights Act. We have done
17 so by trying to keep as many victims as we are aware of up to
18 date about the ongoing case and about any developments in the
19 case.
20 We will continue to provide services and offer
21 services to any of the victims in this case, even after the
22 indictment is dismissed. Both the U.S. Attorney's office and
23 the FBI have been in touch with all known victims or have
24 attempted to be in touch with all known victims, either again
25 directly where victims are not represented by counsel or
