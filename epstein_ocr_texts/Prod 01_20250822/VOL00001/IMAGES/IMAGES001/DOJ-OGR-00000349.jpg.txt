conduct that occurred in New York. The prior NPA included a list of several dozen victims
identified in the prior investigation, all of whom were abused in the State of Florida, and none of
whom are a part of the conduct charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.

Each of these factors—the seriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and
the possibility of lengthy incarceration—creates an extraordinary incentive to flee. And as further
described below, the defendant has the means and money to do so.

2. The Characteristics of the Defendant

The history and characteristics of the defendant also strongly support detention. The
defendant is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial resources to fund any attempt
to flee. Indeed, his potential avenues of flight from justice are practically limitless.

As the defendant acknowledged in his most recent New York State sex offender
registration, he has six residences, including two in the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his own
private island), and one each in Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York; and
Stanley, New Mexico. The most recent estimated value of the defendant’s New York City mansion
alone is more than $77 million. The most recent tax-assessed value of the defendant’s Palm Beach
estate is more than $12 million. The defendant’s primary residence is a private island in the U.S.
Virgin Islands, a place where any sort of meaningful supervision would be all but impossible.

Moreover, the defendant has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex registration
documentation of “current vehicles” lists no fewer than 15 motor vehicles, including seven
Chevrolet Suburbans, a cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mercedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,
and a Hummer I]. These cars are registered in various states and territories including the Virgin
Islands, New York, Florida, and New Mexico. The defendant also has access to two private jets,
giving him the ability to leave the country secretly and on a moment’s notice and to go virtually
anywhere he wants to travel. He is a very frequent international traveler and regularly travels to
and from the United States by private plane. In particular, between January 1, 2018, and the
present, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol has logged approximately more than 20 flights in which
Epstein was traveling to or from a foreign country. Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport
arriving on just such a private international flight after having spent approximately three weeks
abroad. Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk of
flight. See, e.g., United States v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36 (D.D.C. 2005). There can be
no assurance that, upon release, the defendant would suddenly lack access to such means of travel.

Finally, the defendant has no meaningful ties that would keep him in this country. The
defendant has no known immediate family. He is not married and has no children. He has friends
and associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his extensive international travel, and his
professional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are plainly capable of being handled by the
defendant remotely. Simply put, there would be no meaningful reason for the defendant to remain
in the country, while he would have every incentive (and every resource needed) to flee.

Nor would home confinement with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the
defendant’s presence as required. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would
