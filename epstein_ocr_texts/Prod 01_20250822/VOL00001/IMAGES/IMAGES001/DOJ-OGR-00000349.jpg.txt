conduct; that. occurred. in New York. ‘The ‘prior NPA included a.list;of several dozen. victims
identified. in the prior investigation, all of whom Were abused in. the State of Florida, and none of
whom.are a part.of the eonduct' charged in Count Two of the instant Indictment.

Each of these factors—the scriousness of the allegations, the strength of the evidence, and.
the possibility of lengthy incarccration—creates an. extraordinary incentive to‘flec.. And.as further
described. below, the :defendant:has the: means and mioney. to. do so.

2. The:Charactcristics of the Defendant

The history: and characteristics of the defendant; also strongly support detention. The
deéfendant.is extraordinarily wealthy and has access to vast financial:resources to, fund any attempt.
to flee. Indeed, his:potential avenues: of flight from.justice are practically:limitless.

As the: defendant acknowledged, in his ‘most recent New York: State sex. offender
registration, he has siv residences, including two in. the U.S. Virgin Islands (including his own.
private island), and, one: each in. Palm Beach, Florida; Paris, France; New York, New York: and,
Stanley, New Mexico. The most recent:estimated valuc:of the defendant’s New York City mansion.
alone is more than $77 million. The most:recent tax-assessed. value of the defendant’s Palm.Beach.
estate is more than $12‘million. The defendant’s primary residence is.a private island.in the U.S.
Virgin Islands, a place, where any‘sort of meaningful supervision, would, be all but:impossible.

Morcover,, the: defendant. has access to innumerable means to flee. His sex::registration.
documentation of “current. vehicles” ‘lists. no fewer than 15 motor vehicles, including seven.
Chevrolet. Suburbans, a.cargo van, a Range Rover, a Mereedez-Benz sedan, a Cadillac Escalade,
anda Hummer Il. These cars are: registered in. various states and'territorics including’ the Virgin,
Islands, New’ York, Florida, and. New Mexico. The defendant, also has accéss to two private jets,
giving, him ‘the, ability’ to leave the country scerétly' and. on,a moment’s notice and to go virtually
anywhere he.wants to'travel. He is a. very: frequent ‘international traveler and ‘regularly:travels to
and from the United. States by private plane. Jn ‘particular, between. January: 1, 2018, and. the
present, US. Customs and Border Patrol. has. logged ‘approximately more than. 20 flights i in: which,
Epstein'was traveling to or from a foreign, country, Indeed, he was arrested at Teterboro Airport.
arriving on just such a-private international flight after having spent approximately. three weeks
abroad. .Extensive international travel of this nature further demonstrates a significant risk: of
flight. See, e.¥., United States'v. Anderson, 384 F. Supp. 2d 32, 36(D-D.C. 2005). ‘There:can be
no assurance’that, upon. release, the defendant would suddenly lack; access to:such:means of travel.

Finally, the defendant has no meaningful tics that would keep him-in this country. The
defendant.has no known immediate family. He:is not:marricd:and has:no children. He has. friends
and. associates worldwide, as demonstrated by his .cxtensive: international travel, and. his
professional obligations, if any, can and seemingly are’ plainly capable of being handled. by the
defendant.remotely. Simply put, there would be:no meaningful reason for'the defendant:to remain.
in'the country, while he. would have every incentive (and every:resource needed)'to flee.

Nor would. home confinement: ‘with electronic monitoring reasonably assure the
defendant’s presence’ as required. At best, home confinement, with clectronic monitoring would.
