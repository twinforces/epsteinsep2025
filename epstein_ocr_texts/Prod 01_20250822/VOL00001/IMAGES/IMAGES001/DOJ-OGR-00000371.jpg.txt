left the office.

You have done more in other cases, looking into it.

to tell you, I am shocked.

that took over the case and they don’t have: anything, any
affidavits, any statements, any notes. |

"THE COURT: Why don't you speak to ‘the prosecutor
that did: do the case, I am sure you could find that
prosecutor.

_ MS, GAFFNEY: I can find her, but based upon: what
the other prosecutor said, they did not speak to that
prosecutor either.

THE. COURT: You did not ‘speak to the prosecutor
yourself, you did. not speak to ‘them, that is hearsay. You
did not speak to the prosecutor that handled the case,

MS. GAFFNEY: That's right.

investigation here.

MS. GAFFNEY: I mean I called the prosecutor.
