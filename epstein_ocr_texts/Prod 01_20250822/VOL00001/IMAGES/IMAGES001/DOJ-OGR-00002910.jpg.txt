Maxwell chooses not to respond to'guards during the nighttime is no indication that she is

‘inadequate to review the millions of pages of discovery-under circumstances that are not
conducive to preparing for trial. It is unreasonable to'belicve that not, being able to scarch, mark,

imagine how the:government would respond. if this was a 25-year-old. document-driven fraud.
