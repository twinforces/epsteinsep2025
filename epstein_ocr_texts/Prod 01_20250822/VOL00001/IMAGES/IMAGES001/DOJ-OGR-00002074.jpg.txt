Financial Condition Report. I also posed questions to the Macalvins
accountants and requested additional documents that I required to confirm the
amounts listed in the Financial Condition Report and accompaiiying
schedules: At all times, I was given complete access to the relevant
documents and allowed to:ask any questions I thought pertinent to.my
analysis.
Conclusion

7. Based on my review, I believe that the Finaticial Condition Report represents
a complete and accurate summary of the assets held by Ms. Maxwell and her
husband, as well as assets that were, or are currently, held in trust for the

benefit of Ms. Maxwell, for the time period from 2015-2020.
