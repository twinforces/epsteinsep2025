Moreover, as the information, currently available to the Government about. the BSF
subpoena makes ‘plain, the; Government’s concerns arc ‘well founded. Indeed, the defendant has
alrcady sought issuance ofa subpoena that appears'to directly: implicate: the Government's intcrests
by expressly and, improperly secking broad. categories of victim information and.communications
with the Government. While the Government. has not.scen the subpocna to, BSF, it also appears
that the subpoena. constitutes a. fishing. expedition for potential impeachment. material, which.
plainly runs. afoul of the Nixon test. (Letter from, BSF to'the Court at 2, Dkt. ‘No. 191).° ‘Insofar
as the defendant is attempting, to engage. in. such an. improper expedition. inthis casc—or even if
the defendant is merely: pushing. the limits of a ‘Rule 17 subpocna—the Government respectfully:
submits that it should be afforded the opportunity ‘to, bring its concerns to the Court’s attention.

The Government recognizes that some information, such as portions of .a defendant’s
explanation for why. a ‘particular request ina ‘particular subpoena. mects the Nixon standard, may’
reveal critical. defense strategy mriting ev parte consideration. by the Court. But'the Government.
respectfully submits. that interest: can be served. through specific defense requests tailored to the:
particular.redaction or.application.at.issuc, rather'than,a-default whereby ‘the defendant is permitted,

to-proeced entirely’ ex parte in secking, documents and matcrials pursuant .to, Rule 17(c).

(emphasis added); sce: United States'v. R6vess'162. F.R.D. 468,470 (S.D.N-Y. 1995) (Rules 17(a)
and.1.7(b), which:govern the issuance of subpoenas returnable at (rial, also:do not.provide guidance:
as to the proper: procedure for obtaining a pretrial subpoena duces tecum.’ ’). These procedures are,
at.a, bare ‘minimum, in tension with proceeding ex. parfe or under the rules. that. govern, subpoenas
for trial‘testimony.

* The Government has also riot Scen any response filing by the defendant, Which per the Court’s
March 24, 2021 Order:was to be filed. on. or before April.2, 3021. To the extent-the defendant did
file such,a response, it was neither, dockcted nor provided. to the Government, and as such, the
Government is unable to address. ‘herein any arguments made by the defendant about the BSF
subpoena.
