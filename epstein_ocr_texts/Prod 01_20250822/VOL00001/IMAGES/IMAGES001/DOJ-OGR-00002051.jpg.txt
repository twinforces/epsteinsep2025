Your Honor: f
This statement is in support of Ghislaine Maxwell's character and her request for bail.
| sincerely hope you will see fit to grant Ghislaine Maxwell, | | bail to properly prepare for
trial. However, should you not do so, | am afraid for her life given the conditions to which she is
being subjected. If | may, just because Jeffrey Epstein died in Federal pretrial custody, should
NOT mean that Ghislaine should become the scapegoat, and be treated so harshly. | sincerely
hope that Ghislaine's life will not be forfeited due to the adverse extreme conditions in which she is
being held, or that she have a severe mentalhealth or physical health breakdown as a
consequence of her current conditions and treatment.
Accordingly, | join with TE wn haveextremely strong faith in Ghislaine's respect for the
judicial process and her absolute determination and right to prove her innocence at trial.! am
demonstrating my faith that she will not seek to flee if she is granted bail, by placing $25,000 cash
in good faith towards her bond. Ghislaine Maxwell has NO reason to flee. When she could have left the
country, she chose not to. The people she loves most, her husband a : here. She
remained in the US to prove her innocence. The US is her home.
