Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

Annie Farmer submits the following statement in opposition to the Defendant’s renewed

motion for bail.
is 2K 3

I appreciate the opportunity to again be heard by the Court in this matter and once more
request that Ghislaine Maxwell not be released prior to her trial. I write this not only on behalf of
myself, but all of the other girls and young women who were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine
Maxwell sexually abused me as a child and the government has the responsibility to make sure
that she stands trial for her crimes. I do not believe that will happen or that any of the women she
exploited will see justice if she is released on bail. She has lived a life of privilege, abusing her
position of power to live beyond the rules. Fleeing the country in order to escape once more would
fit with her long history of anti-social behavior.

Drawing on my personal experience with Maxwell and what I have learned of how she has
lived since that time, I believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me and many other children
and young women is evidence of her disregard for and violation of the rights of others. She has
demonstrated a complete failure to accept to responsibility in any way for her actions and
demonstrated a complete lack of remorse for her central role in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.
She was both charming and manipulative with me during the grooming process, consistent with
what many of the women she abused have described. She has frequently lied to others, including
repeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades lived a parasitic lifestyle
relying on Epstein and others to fund her lavish existence.

Maxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern is her own welfare, and
that she is willing to harm others if it benefits her. She is quite capable of doing so once more. She
will not hesitate to leave the country irrespective of whether others will be on the hook financially
for her actions because she lacks empathy, and therefore simply does not care about hurting others.
She would in fact be highly motivated to flee in order to reduce the possibility of continued
imprisonment, the conditions of which she has continuously complained. Her actions over the last
several years and choice to live in isolation for long periods suggest that being comfortable is more
