Re: United.States’v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

Annie Farmer submits the: following statement. in opposition, to the Defendant’s renewed
motion. for bail.

38 KK

I appreciate the opportunity to again be heard, by the Court in this matter ‘and, once more
request. that Ghislaine Maxwell not. be released ‘prior fo her trial. I write this not: only. on behalf of
myself, but all of the other girls. and young. women. who Were victimized by Maxwell. Ghislaine
Maxwell sexually abused ‘me: asa. child and the. government. has: the responsibility to make sure
that she stands trial for‘her crimes. 1-do.not believe'that-will happen or that any:of the womenishe
exploited, will see justice if she’ is released on bail. She has lived a, life of privilege, abusing her
position of power'to live beyond the rules. Flecing the country. in order to escape once more ‘would
fit with her long. history of anti-social. behavior.

Drawing ‘on my ‘personal expericnee with Maxwell.and what:I have learned of how she:has
lived ‘since that:time, I’ believe that she is a psychopath. Her abuse of me’and ‘many other children.
and, young women, is.cvidence of her disregard ‘for and violation of the rights, of others: She has
demonstrated. a complete failure to accept ‘to résponsibility in any way for her actions arid
demonstratéd.a.complete lack of remorse forher central role. in procuring girls for Epstein to abuse.
She was both charming and manipulative: with me during the g grooming ‘process, consistent with
what many-of the: women. she abused have described. She:has frequently licd to others, including
repeatedly lying about me and my family. Maxwell has for decades: lived.'a, parasitic: lifestyle
relying on Epstcin.and others to fund her lavish existence.

Maxwell has repeatedly demonstrated that her primary concern. is her own welfare, and
that she is willing to harm.others if it benefits her. She is quite: capable of doing so once more. She
will ‘not hesitate to Jeave the country. irrespective of whether others'will be on the hook financially
for her actions because she’ lacks empathy; ‘and therefore simply docs:not care about hurting others.
She would in fact be highly motivated to ‘fleé in order to réduce 'the possibility of continued
imprisonment, the conditions of which she has:continuously complained. Her actions over the last
several years and choicc'to live:in isolation for long, periods suggest that being comfortable: is more
