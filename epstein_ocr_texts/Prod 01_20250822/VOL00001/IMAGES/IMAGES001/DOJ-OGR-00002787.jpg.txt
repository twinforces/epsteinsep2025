deprivation, and other conditions adverse to her physical-health.and mental ‘well-being, Ms.
‘Maxwell responded appropriately. and. accurately to questions:posed. by’ Pretrial. Services which
‘were restricted to her personal. assets. Since then, financial. documents = collected and
‘professionally. vetted by a highly: respected accounting firm = have been. submitted to the
government; and the Court and provide full details and supporting: documentation concerning’
‘Ms. Maxwell’s, personal assets and those jointly: held with the spouse. Further, no ‘valid
challenge has, been made to those submissions.

The government challenges, the Court: by inancly’ stating that: if “the only'way’to, keep
the defendant: from ‘using' her ‘asscts to flee is to take away’ control. of her assets, then she is too
great.a risk’to release.” (Dkt.165 at 8.) This statement. is fundamentally. illogical as it
‘undermines most.conditions of release. For:cxample, the same could be said. of electronic:
monitoring:=‘1.c., ifthe only way. to keep a, defendant: from-flecing the jurisdiction is to:place
him. on. home confinement: with clcetronic’monitoring, then he is too great-a flight risk to
release.* The ‘Court should readily. dismiss this frivolous argument. Under the Bail Reform Act,
if there are appropriate conditions for'releasc, bail should be granted. The conditions
collectively proposed in the previous and present. bail applications provide ample assurance that.

‘Ms. Maxwell will be present. at:trial.

* Moreover, in an effort to further obtuse: ate the nicrits of Ms. Maxwell's bail application, the government
desperately argues that funds: for legal Se ‘16S, ss presently | held-i in nattorney'« escrow Faccounts, Ww would be

become: accomplices to ay. iolation ofa court or der shows: utter disrespect for Ms. Maxw ell: S defense team..
In particular, New’ York counsel, who-have spent the entirety of their legal.carcers practicing:in this distri ict
and, establishing Well- FeSspectéd reputations among the bench and bar. take imbrage: at the, governments
callous assertion.
