Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 168 Filed 03/18/21 Page5of5

above, however, the Court will give the Government an opportunity to justify the ongoing need
to redact this information and these documents; by March 22, 2021, the Government may file a
letter with the Court—under seal, if necessary—yustifying the redaction and sealing requests.

Finally, the Court denies the Government’s request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal.
While portions of that transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record.
See Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 1212-1. In light of this, the Court sees
no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant portions.

In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket on ECF their
brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file a letter with the Court
justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding pages 1-128 and 187-188 and
Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The parties are further ORDERED to meet,
confer, and jointly propose redactions to the Defendant’s cover letter objecting to the
Government’s proposed redactions by March 22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to
meet, confer, and propose redactions to Exhibit 11 of the Government’s submission by March
22, 2021,
Dated: March 18, 2021
