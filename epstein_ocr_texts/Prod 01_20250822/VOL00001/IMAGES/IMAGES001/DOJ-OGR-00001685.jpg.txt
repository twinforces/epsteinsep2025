Dear Judge Nathan:

On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this letter to reply to
the government’s response letter and submission regarding the proposed protective order in the
above-captioned case, dated July 28, 2020 (“Government’s Response” or “Gov’t Resp.”) (Dkt.

restriction is “no broader than is necessary” to protect that interest, and must consider the impact
that the restriction may have “on a defendant’s due process right to prepare and present a full
defense at trial.” United States v. Lindh, 198 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2002). Throughout
its letter, the government inverts this standard, claiming that the burden is on the defense (which,
