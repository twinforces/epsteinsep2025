Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 140 Filed 02/04/21 Page 17 of 22
Id. at 294. Either avenue, explained the Court, would provide the real party in interest notice of
the government’s request and an opportunity to be heard, either by moving to quash the
subpoena or opposing intervention and modification of the protective order. /d.

The Court also rejected the government’s argument that the district court was too
solicitous of the witnesses’ Fifth Amendment rights. /d. at 295. According to the Government,
the witnesses were under no compulsion to testify, and having given testimony, they voluntarily
waived any Fifth Amendment right they may have had. /d. But as the Second Circuit explained,
the government’s argument ignored the reality of civil litigation:

Unless a valid Rule 26(c) protective order is to be fully and fairly enforceable,

witnesses relying upon such orders will be inhibited from giving essential

testimony in civil litigation, thus undermining a procedural system that has been
successfully developed over the years for disposition of civil differences. In short,
witnesses might be expected frequently to refuse to testify pursuant to protective
orders if their testimony were to be made available to the government for criminal
investigatory purposes in disregard of those orders.

Id. at 295-96. The Court thus held:

[A]bsent a showing of improvidence in the grant of a Rule 26(c) protective order

or some extraordinary circumstance or compelling need, none of which appear here,

a witness should be entitled to rely upon the enforceability of a protective order

against any third parties, including the Government, and that such an order should

not be vacated or modified merely to accommodate the government’s desire to

inspect protected testimony for possible use in a criminal investigation, either as

evidence or as the subject of a possible perjury charge.
Id. at 296.
