risk of flight. or dangérotisness, they dre still entitled to the

same Sixth Amendment rights to access. defense counsel to

prepare their case.

MR. COHEN: Of course, your Honor, My point was. a
more harrow point. My point is that the facts in ‘those cases.
are different from our case in. a meaningful way and. the court
was doing a different Evaluation. That was the point I was
making on this case,

So in conclusion, we believe this is a compelling case
for bail. We believe that the government, which has the burden
of persuasion that hever shifts, Has not made a showing as
required, that. our client is a risk of flight. When you
consider thé risk, as Judge Raggi put. it, ih Sabhnani, the
actual, risk of flight, not fantasy and not speculation, when
you ¢onsidér that. the only factors they really point to are
ones that the cases have already addressed, such as
international travel and passports.

We also submit that the government has not carried, its

burden of showing there is ho conditidn or combination of

conditions that secure release.

So wé would ask the Gourt to grant bail today. And if
request that the court leave the proceeding open for a week so
that we can try to satisfy the court because we want to.

Thank. you, your Honor, for your time.
