1 evidence from his home consistent with victim accounts. Even

2 the room where the abuse occurred, your Honor, the massage

3 room, was still set up in the same way it was 15 years ago,

4 with a massage table and sex paraphernalia.

S And with respect to the photographs â€”--

6 THE COURT: When you say the evidence was consistent

7 with victim accounts, is it limited to the massage table and

8 massage room or is there something else?

9 MR. ROSSMILLER: Descriptions of the massage room and
10 the massage table, that's correct, your Honor.

11 THE COURT: Okay. All right.

12 MR. ROSSMILLER: With respect to the photographs, your
13 Honor, some of those were found in a Locked safe which also

14 held electronic disks with labels that included the words

15 "Young Miscellaneous Nudes 1" and "Girl Pics Nude."

16 Your Honor, this is not an individual who has left his
17 past behind. He is a continuing danger to the community and an
18 extraordinary risk of flight and, for those reasons, the

19 government joins the pretrial recommendation that the defendant
20 be detained pending trial.
2l THE COURT: All right. Thank you.
22 Mr. Weingarten.
23 MR. WEINGARTEN: Thank you, your Honor. I will use
24 the podium, if that's okay.
25 THE COURT: That's fine.
