you will recall, after he committed suicide, I said that I was confident that we would
continue to pursue this case vigorously and pursue anyone who's complicit in it. And so

I'm very happy that we were able to get Ms. Maxwell.”

A source said the BOP is taking extra preventative measures to regain the public's trust

and confidence as well as preserving the integrity of the Justice Department.'

It is obvious that Ms. Maxwell is bearing the brunt of BOP incompetence. Being “livid”
over the death of Epstein, the Department of Justice is seeking to repair the BOP’s tarnished
reputation by placing Ms. Maxwell under extraordinarily harsh conditions, not in any response to
Ms. Maxwell’s requirements, but rather in response to the failed handling of a completely
different inmate.

Ms. Maxwell has been an exemplary detainee. The psychological and physiological
impact of solitary isolation is well documented. Ms. Maxwell has not, by her conduct or by
virtue of the charges, brought this type of overly restrictive confinement upon herself. The
conditions under which she is detained are punitive, unwarranted, deleteriously impacting her
ability to prepare her defense, and interfering with counsel’s ability to provide the legal
representation to which she, and any other detainee, deserves.

The MDC’s letter is insufficient. The warden of the institution bears responsibility for
the conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is confined. Warden Tellez should be directed to
respond to the numerous concerns that have been brought to his attention.

Very truly yours,
BOBBI C. STERNHEIM
