47. Article 4 of the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France provides that
“le]xtradition shall not be granted by France when the offense for which extradition is
requested is considered by France as a political offense or as an offense connected with
a political offense or as an offense inspired by political motives”.

48. A political motivation claim requires the Investigating Chamber to examine, to some
extent, the merits of the case. The Court is also required to look into the merits of the
case where the requested person argues that there is a manifest inconsistency between
the conduct and the legal offenses in respect of which the extradition is sought’.

49. The conduct described in the indictment does not appear to be manifestly inconsistent
with the offenses charged therein.

50. As to political motivation, French courts have never opposed extradition requests from
the USA on this ground‘, In fact, in the past ten years, only one published decision of
the Cour de cassation has denied an American extradition request, on the ground that
the Investigating Chamber had not verified that the criminal conduct described in the
request constituted a crime in France at the time of commission”. All other published
decisions which have ruled on a request from the USA have granted extradition”®.

51. In light of the elements contained in the Superseding Indictment, Ms Ghislaine Maxwell
could not oppose her extradition to the USA on the basis of a political motivation claim,
that would have no serious ground, and therefore the Investigating Chamber would not
look into the merits of the case against her.
