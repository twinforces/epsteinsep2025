47, Article: 4. of the: Extradition. Treaty between ‘the USA and France provides that
“[e]xtradition, shall not. be. granted by. France when the offense for which extradition: is
requested is considered-by France. as a political offense or as, an offense connected: with

a political offense or as an offense inspired by: political motives,”

48. A. political motivation claim. requires the, Investigating- Chamber to examine, ‘to, some
extent, the merits of the case. The Court is also required ‘to look ‘into the merits of the
case ‘where. the. requested person argues. that there is.a manifest ‘inconsistency: between

the.conduct.and the legal. offenses in respect of which the extradition is sought”.

49. The conduct described :in the. indictiment. does not. appear to be manifestly inconsistent

with the offenses charged therein.

50. As to’ political motivation, French. courts have never opposed extradition requests from
the USA. on-this, ground”. In fact, ‘in the past ten years, only one published. decision. of
the. Cour de cassation, has ‘denied an, American, extradition request, on the ground. that
the. Investigating Chamber had ‘not: verified ‘that; the criminal conduct described. in the
request constituted. a crime in, France: at the time of, commission”>. All other published.

decisions which have ruled ona request from the USA‘have granted extradition”®.

5.1. In light of the elements contained in the Superseding Indictment, Ms Ghislaine Maxwell
could not ‘opposc her extradition to the.USA on the.basis ofa political motivation claim,
that would ‘have no scrious ground, and. therefore'the ‘Investigating, Chamber would not

look into ‘the merits ofthe case-against her.
