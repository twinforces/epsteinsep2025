United States v. Dreier, 596 F. Supp. 24.831 (S.D.N-Y. 2009), and. United States v. Madoff; 586
F. Supp. 2d 240 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)):

The Court’s.concerms regarding the absence of any dependents, significant family ties, or
employment in the United States, meanwhile, apply with somewhat less force in light of the
evidence submitted in support of this motion. See id, at 84:4 84:9. The Defendant has
submitted a litany.of letters of support written by friends and family members. See Def. Mot.,
Exs. A N, W X. Thesé letters, according to the Defendant, support her claim that she has
significant ties to the United States and attest to the Defendant’s character. The Defendant
places particular emphasis on the letter written by her spouse, whose identity and connection to
the Defendant was withheld from the. Court at the initial bail hearing. See Def. Mot. at 11-13.

In that letter, her:spouse expounds.on the lives they led before her arrest, noting in particular that
the Government’s characterization of the Defendant’s “transient” lifestyle, Dkt. No. 4 at.9; was
belied by the “quiet family life” that they had enjoyed. Def. Mot. at 11; see also Def. Mot, Ex. A
{| 4-5. Other letters similarly highlight that the Defendant’s family and affective ties in the
United States are stronger than was originally presented to the Court in the initial bail hearing.

These letters substantiate the Defendant’s claim that she has important ties to people.in
the United States, but they leave unaltered the Court’s conclusion that flight would not:pose an
insurmountable. burden for the. Defendant. Among other things, the Defendant now argues that
her newly revealed relationship with her spouse signals her deep affective ties in the country, but
at the time she was arrested; she was not living with him and claimed to be getting divorced. See
Pretrial Services Report at 3. Indeed,.she does not propose to live with him were she to be
released on bail, undercutting her argument that that relationship would create an insurmountable

burden to her fleeing. Furthermore, the fact that:she.has friends and family in the United States
