‘investigation in, 2007 (see Dkt. 199 at..1-+2), long before commencing this prosecution. against Ms.
Maxwell. We cannot adequately prepare for a trial containing the new charges.and a.
substantially expanded conspiracy in the less than three:months ‘remaining.

Government Opposition to a Continuance Is Unreasonable

The government implies. that:the assumptions underlying the July 12 trial, date: are
‘irrelevant because it represented, as it always does, that:its: investigation. was “ongoing.” But
“ongoing investigation” does not imply superseding the indictment to, enlarge the originally
charged conspiracy from four to cleven years and. adding two new distinct charges bascd.on
distinct alleged conduct that purportedly took:place outside the time: period of the original
charges. This is not.a situation where the government’s “ongoing investigation” has yielded, for
example, a new overt act to an existing conspiracy. The government has effectively added.a
brand new case on top of the existing case. This is a:significant expansion of the case against
Ms. ‘Maxwell that requires considerable time for the: defense to investigate and prepare. Indced,
by its.own admission, the government needed more'than two months after its January 2020
interview of Accusecr-4 ‘to properly investigate her allegations and obtain the second Superseding
indictment. Yt, the.government confidently: contends that the defensewill not.need any
additional time to prepare to defend against: this revised prosecution. The government’s double=
standard approach.is simply wrong. The defensc:is entitled to conduct:a. meaningful. defense

The governnicnt’s recent production of 3500 material for:non-testifying witnesses
underscores the significant amount of time:that:the: defense will. need to investigate. On-April 13,
2021, in.a highly unusual, if not unprecedented disclosure, the government produced, over 20,000
pages of interview notés, reports and other materials. related to 226: scparate, witnesses whom. the

government docs not intend.to call.as witnesses: at trial, Ms. Maxwell:has not yet reccived these
