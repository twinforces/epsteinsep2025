VI. ORGANIZATION OF THE REPORT

The Report is divided into three chapters. In Chapter One, OPR describes the relevant
federal, state, and local law enforcement entities involved in investigating Epstein’s criminal
conduct, as well as the backgrounds of the five subjects and their roles in the events in question.
OPR provides a brief profile of Epstein and identifies the defense attorneys who interacted with
the subjects.

In Chapter Two, OPR sets forth an extensive account of events relating to the federal
investigation of Epstein. The account begins with the initial complaint in March 2005 by a young
victim and her parents to the local police—a complaint that launched an investigation by local law
enforcement authorities—and continues through the mid-2006 opening of the federal
investigation; the September 2007 negotiation and signing of the NPA; Epstein’s subsequent
efforts to invalidate the NPA through appeals to senior Department officials; Epstein’s June 2008
guilty plea in state court; and, finally, efforts by the AUSA to ensure Epstein’s compliance with
the terms of the NPA during his incarceration and until his term of home detention ended in July
2010. After describing the relevant events, OPR analyzes the professional misconduct allegations
relating to the decisions made regarding the development and execution of the NPA. OPR
describes the relevant standards and sets forth its findings and conclusions regarding the subjects’
conduct.

Chapter Three concerns the government’s interactions with victims and the district court’s
findings regarding the CVRA. OPR describes the relevant events and analyzes the subjects’
conduct in light of the pertinent standards.

OPR sets forth the extensive factual detail provided in Chapters Two and Three, including
internal USAO and Department communications, because doing so is necessary for a full
understanding of the subjects’ actions and of the bases for OPR’s conclusions.
