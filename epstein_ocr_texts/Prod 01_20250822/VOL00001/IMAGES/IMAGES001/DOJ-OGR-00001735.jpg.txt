eg., United. States v. Smith, 985 F. ‘Supp. 2d 506, 53] (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (“As a general proposition,
courts have repeatedly recognized that. materials, ‘including even ‘judicial documents which ‘are
presumptively‘accessible, can.be kept:from the: public: if their dissemination might. ‘adversely affect.
law enforeement, interésts.””) (citing United Statés v.. Amodéo, 71. F.3d 1044, 1050)); sce also
United. States v. Park, 619 F. Supp. 2d 89,94 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (holding that-the need to “maintain.
the scerecy of. the Government's investigation” outweighed the ‘public’ s right of. access to certain.
sentencing documents).

Fourth, defense counsel cites not a single case to support ‘the argument. that a criminal
‘defendant. should be permitted to use criminal. discovery materials. in. her civil.cases. Nor is the
Government aware of. any. Though precedent on this. issue: appears to be::somewhat sparse—
perhaps because few’ defendants attempt. such a maneuver—see’ United States v. Calderon, 1S. Cr.
025.2017 WL. 6453344, at *3 (D. Conn. Dec. |, 2017) (discussing the: relative lack of specific
guidance in the context of an application to modify protective ordérs in criminal cases), See also
United States. ¥. Morales, 807 F.3d 717, 72.1 (Sth Cit. 2015) (“[m]otions to modify protective
orders in.criminal cases appear to be:infrequent’ »), decisions that. do ‘exist!have rejected the kind of
blurring of the ‘line between criminal and ‘civil procecdings that the defendant attempts here. See’
Galderon, 2017 WE 6453344, at;.5-6 (denying a defendant’s. application. for modification, of a.
criminal ‘protective order'so he could: usc certain discovery materials in. a.FOIA suit); Uniied States
if. DeNunsio, --- FE. Supp. 3d ---, 2020 WL 1495880, at *2-3 (D. Mass. March 27,2020) (denying
a. defendant’s motion, to modify two protective orders in his criminal -case: for the: ‘purpose: of
pursuing claims in a‘civil action, even. following:the completion,of trial).

Absent any. authority upon which to rely; the defendant, in. urging’ a contrary conclusion,
makes, various assertions and accusations, none of which ‘warrant a different outcome. In.
particular, there ‘is ‘no merit or particular relevance. to the defendant’s argument that the
Government | 'sceretly obtained a volume ‘of materials relevant to its criminal case without telling
the defendant. That is how grand. jury subpoenas and ‘investigations frequently work., ‘Defense
counsel’s overheated rhetoric: notwithstanding, there is, simply nothing’ nefarious about. the
Government obtaining materials through grand, jury subpocna process, let alone: anything about
the manner in which the Government obtained these :materials that warrants the relicf requested.

Certainly to the ‘extent the defendant asserts that. her adversary in civil litigation has
engaged in, some sort of improper conduct=assertions the Government by. no means intends to
suggest agrecnient with—such argunients éven if credited would not be a proper basis to
circumvent the plain. language of the protective order (or-the existing scaling orders) in this case.
In any event, of the materials at issue, the only:documentithe defendant’s civil adversary has access
to is the lone April 2019 order, meaning any purported. imbalance between the parties in the Civil,
Cases at; this stage is significantly overstated: And to the extent the defendant. may seck to make
similar accusations against the Government or challenge the: manner in.'‘which the Government.
obtairied 'the, materials at issuc—a challenge. that itself Would not’ justify the. rélicf presently’

investigation.
