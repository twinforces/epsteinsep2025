the NPA was the result of an extensive 3-year investigation by

law enforcement. in Flerida. In essénce, the Feds made Mr.

Epstein plead to a state offense and they declined prosecution

federally, and that is translated in the NPA. Mr, Epstein did

his time, Mr. Epstein is on the registration list, and Mr.

Epstein paid the alleged victims.

that there 15 a séparaté basis not. only for a séx trafficking
