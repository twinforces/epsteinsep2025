11 his time, Mr. Epstein is on the registration list, and Mr.

12 Epstein paid the alleged victims.
13 As I am sure you have noted from the indictment, that

19 prostitution, calling it sex trafficking. We think that is the
20 heart of everything, and that will be the centerpiece of our
21 defense, at least legally.

28 asserting is that the episodes that occurred in Manhattan were
24 not included in the nonprosecution agreement in Florida and
25 that there is a separate basis not only for a sex trafficking
