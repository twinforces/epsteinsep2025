for the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of this

Agreement, nor any other offenses that have

been the subject of the joint investigation by

the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the

United States Attorney’s Office, nor any

offenses that arose from the Federal Grand

Jury investigation will be instituted in this

District, and the charges against Epstein if

any, will be dismissed."

Nor does Annabi, as Maxwell contends, apply only where subsequent
charges are "sufficiently distinct" from charges covered by an
earlier agreement. In Annabi, this Court rejected an interpreta-
tion of a prior plea agreement that rested on the Double Jeopardy
Clause, reasoning that even if the Double Jeopardy Clause
applied, the subsequent charges were "sufficiently distinct" and
therefore fell outside the Clause’s protections. Annabi, 771 F.2d

construction it announced depended on the similarities between
earlier and subsequent charges.
