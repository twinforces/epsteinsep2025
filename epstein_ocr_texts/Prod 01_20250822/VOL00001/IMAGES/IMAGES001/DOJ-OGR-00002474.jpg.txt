LOAas6 W20-cr-00330-AJN Document 136-9 Filed 02/04/21 Page 8 of 33 7

1 transcript is outweighed by Ms. Maxwell's countervailing

2 interests in resisting disclosure of the details of her

5 private, intimate relationships with consenting adults. This

4 testimony is, in any case, far afield from the sex trafficking
5 and sexual abuse allegations that were central to the dispute

6 in Giuffre v. Maxwell. Although the prurient interest of some
7 may be left unsatiated as a result, Ms. Maxwell's interest in

8 keeping private the details of her sexual relationships with

9 consenting adults warrants the sealing of those portions of her
10 testimony (and any materials that reference them).

11 For the sake of efficiency, my chambers will share

12 with the parties a copy of the transcript that highlights the
13 portions of Ms. Maxwell's deposition that should remain

14 redacted. This will avoid, I know you're happy to hear, my

15 reading into the record my line-by-line determinations

16 regarding the full 193-page transcript.

17 Ms. Giuffre, likewise, asserts certain privacy

18 interests that she argues outweigh the presumption of public

19 access in certain documents. The Court finds, as it did for
20 the last round of motions it considered for unsealing, that
21 Ms. Giuffre's privacy interests in her medical records, where
22 they reference the medical treatment she received, outweigh any
23 public interests in those materials. So when I refer to
24 medical information to be redacted, I am referring to
25 information describing medical treatment. The parties agree,
