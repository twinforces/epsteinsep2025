LUaS6 WW20-cr-00330-AJN: Document 136-9 Filed 02/04/21 Page 8 of 33 7
transcript is outweighed by Ms. Maxwell's countervailing

interests in resisting disclosure of the details of her
private, intimate relationships with consenting adults. This
testimony is, in any ¢dsé, far afiéld from the sex trafficking
and sexual abuse allegations that were central to the dispute
in Giuffre v. Maxwell, Although the prurient interest of some
may be left, unsatiated as a result, Ms. Maxwell.'s interest, in
keeping private ‘the details of her sexual rélationships with,
consenting adults warrants the sealing of those portions of her

testimony (and any materials that reference them).

For the sake of efficiency, my chambers will share

with the parties a copy of! the transcript that highlights the
portions of Ms. Maxwelil.'s deposition that should remain

redacted, This will avoid, I know you're happy to hear, my

reading into the record my line-by-line determinations
regarding the full 193-page transcript.

Ms. Giuffre, likewise, asserts certain privacy
interests that she argues outweigh the presumption of :public
access in certain documents. Zhe Court finds, as it did, for
the, last reund of motions it censidered for unsealing, that
Ms. Giuffre's privacy interésts in her medical records, where

they reference the medical treatment ‘she received, outweigh. any

public interests jin those materials. So when I refer to
medical information to be redacted, I am referring to

information deséribing medical treatment. The parties agreé,
