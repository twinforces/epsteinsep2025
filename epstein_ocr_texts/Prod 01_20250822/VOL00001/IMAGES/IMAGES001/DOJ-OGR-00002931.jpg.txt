government in person to confer on a briefing schedule for supplemental pretrial motions, as well
as other deadlines, which we are prepared to discuss with the Court at the arraignment.

The government’s revised trial estimate from two to four weeks remains unrealistic and
does not include jury selection, which will take longer than usual in this media-saturated case.
We oppose advancing jury selection beyond early distribution of questionnaires to prospective
jurors. Even if the case were tried on the previous indictment on July 12th, carving off any time
required for trial preparation is unwarranted and unfair.

A continuance is justified based on the second superseding indictment. The new charges
up the ante and double Ms. Maxwell’s sentencing exposure. To deny her a continuance
undercuts her constitutional right to a fair trial and effective assistance of counsel. A
continuance - the need for which is caused solely by the government - is reasonable and
necessary in defense of Ms. Maxwell. The denial of a continuance risks a miscarriage of justice.
Despite Its Necessity, A Continuance Further Prejudices Ms. Maxwell

A delay of the July 12" trial — especially one that accommodates counsel’s other trial
schedules — has a direct and deleterious impact on Ms. Maxwell as a result of her continued
detention, the details of which are well known to the Court. In addition to her prolonged
detention, she is the victim on ongoing hostile media reporting which impacts the ability to seat
fair and impartial jurors.

On April 26", Second Circuit will hear oral argument on Ms. Maxwell’s bail appeal and
may moot any need for a further bail application. Nonetheless, Ms. Maxwell reserves her right to
seek a bail hearing depending on the Circuit’s decision.
