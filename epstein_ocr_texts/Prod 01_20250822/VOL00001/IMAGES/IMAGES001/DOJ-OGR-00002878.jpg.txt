of this lawsuit with the Southern District of New York’s U.S. Attorney’s Office: to try to

No...20-2413 (2d Cir. July 30, 2020), ECF No., 10-1 (explaining the: Defendant’s “concerns that
[Ms. Giuffre] and [BSF] were acting as either express or de facto agents of the government” and.

‘Subpoena, which. secks, or example, communications between BSF and the Government and.
BSF’s ‘submissions on behalf of its: clients to an independent claims. program administered by:
Jeffrey Epstein’s Estate, is a transparent. attempt to further this false narrative and. to fish, for

THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 17(C)

Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule governs. nonparty subpocnas
in.¢riminal.proceedings. Rule. 1 Hc)“ “was not intended to.provide a means of discovery forcriminal.
cases.” United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 698 (1974); seealso, e.g, United States v. Barnes,
560°F.. App’x:36, 39 (2d Cir. 2014) (“Rule 1.7 subpoenas are properly used. to obtain. admissible
evidence, not as a, substitute for discovery.’’); United. States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 553
(S:D.N.Y. 1995) (explaining that although the civil rules permit subpoenas “to seck production of
documents or other materials which, although.not themselves admissible, could lead to admissible
evidence,” criminal “Rule. 17(c).cannot be used to. obtain. leads as to the existence of additional
documentary. evidence or to seck information relating to the: defendant’s case” (internal quotation.

| A motion to quash the Subpoena i is:not yct ripe: becausce,, without. having the benefit. of the:

Defendant’s sealed.briefing on_/her motion and, any-other orders’ pertaining to it, it appears that.the:
Court has not, granted Defendant’s motion for an. order ‘authorizing service of the Subpoena on.
BSF. The Court; however, should exercise :its discretion and deny the Defendant’s motion. See
United States v. Weissman, No. 01. Cr. 529 (BSJ), 2002. WL 1467845, at *1. (S. D.NLY. July 8,

2002) (Rule: 17(c) expressly: commits ‘the decision whether to require pre- trial production. of
documents'to the sound.diseretion.of the court. ”). Should the Court-wish to hear further-from BSF
prior to deciding the Motion, BSF is prepared to appear'before the Court and/or move to intervene
and. to quash the Subpoena.
