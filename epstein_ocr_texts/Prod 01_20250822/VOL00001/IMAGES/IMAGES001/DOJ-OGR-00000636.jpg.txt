, and the substantial Jaw. Intervenor has been denied these rights so that the conspiracy can continue
laundering tax money. Intervenor has already proven that USDOJ/ OIG are politically corrupt federal
| agencies, as intervenor filed a whistleblower complaint with WA State Auditor and OIG in 2012/2013
because he was worried about structural bridge collapse. As a result of filing this complaint, intervenor
| had his career and reputation destroyed by OIG, State of WA, and his attorneyz. Relator has already
shown that OIG/ USDOJ agencies cannot be trusted as they specialize in fraud and deception (see
complaint No CV 18-6051 on Pacer for the entire complaint).
I
CONCLUSION
| For the foregoing reasons, and the fact that USDOJ and OIG have already been proven by relator to be
politically corrupt agencies, G. respectfully requests that the Court approve his motion, and surrender
USDOJ to relator.
The obstruction of the quo warranto proceedings and the “apparent acquittal” for USDOJ, has resulted
| in the “apparent suicide” of Jeffrey Epstein while under USDOJ / Bill Barr watch. Relator has already
demonstrated/ proven that USDOJ/ OIG are corrupt and assisting Republicans and “Democrats” to
launder tax money. [nteryvenor’s motion should be granted.
