Re: Request to File Under Seal: Proposed Redactions to Request to Modify Protective
Order and Reply in Support Thereof
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:
This is a letter motion to file under seal Ms. Maxwell’s Proposed Redactions to Request to
Modify Protective Order (“Proposed Redactions”) as well as her Reply in Support of Request
to Modify Protective Order (“Reply”).
The Protective Order in this case states:
The Defendant, Defense Counsel, Defense Staff, Defense Experts/Advisors, Potential
Defense Witnesses, and Other Authorized Persons are prohibited from filing publicly
as an attachment to a filing or excerpted within a filing any Confidential Information
or Highly Confidential Information referenced in the Discovery, unless authorized by
the Government in writing or by Order of the Court. Any such filings must be filed
under seal, unless authorized by the Government in writing or by Order of the Court.
See Protective Order (Doc. 36) at § 15.
The Proposed Redactions and the Reply contain content designated as Confidential
Information by the Government under the terms of the Protective Order.
Ms. Maxwell therefore requests permission to file the Proposed Redactions and Reply under
seal, at least until such time as the Court has ruled on the proposed redactions set forth
therein.
