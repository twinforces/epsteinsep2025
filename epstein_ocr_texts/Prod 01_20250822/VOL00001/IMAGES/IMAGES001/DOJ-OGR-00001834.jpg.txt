Government as part of its. Ongoing. investigation, ‘well. in, advance. of any trial in, this :matter.

Premature disclosure of these:witnesses” identities and:sensitive information.about those witnesses
risks jeopardizing the Government’s ongoing investigation, in at. least two respects. First,

disclosure ‘would tend. to reveal, to the defendant the scope of and, cvidenec gathered, during’ the
Government’s ongoing ‘investigation, the details, of which are not:currently: public or: known to the
defendant. Second, an order requiring: the immediate ‘production of these Materials would risk:
deterring other victims from coming forward to be interviewed and:from providing evidence to the
Government, ‘Victims who may“be considering cooperating with the Government’s investigation,
may decline to do so if they belicve that. the information they provide—even information, outside
‘the ‘period charged in the Indictment=must. be immediately’ disclosed to the defense in. this case.
Given thé sensitivity of the Materials, the necd.to:protect the Government?s ongoing investigation,

and the minimal. (if'any) relevance: ofthe Materials to: the offenses charged ‘in. the Indictment, the
Government respectfully submits that good. cause exists. pursuant ‘to Rule 16(d) to delay their
disclosure.

Accordingly, ‘the ‘Government respéctfully requests that the Court approve the
Government’s request to delay’ diselosure of these, Materials.

There is no dispute that the materials referenced in the Government’s
letter will be-turned over to the defeise. The Government has
‘indicated thatjit, will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the
timing of stich disclostire. See Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the
‘Government has articulated plausible reasons for some delay of

disclostire, see Dkt. No. 65-at 4, the Cotirt grants the:Government’s

‘request to.delay disclosure. However, the Government’s proposal to.

delay disclostire until 8 weeks in advance of-trial is insufficient. In
order'to ensure that:the defense can adequately prepare for trial, the
Government shall prodtice the refereticed materials, which.are not
voluminous, to the defense by: March.12, 2021. Disclosure of the
Materials will:of course be stibject to the protective order entered by:
the Court, see Dkt. No. 36.
