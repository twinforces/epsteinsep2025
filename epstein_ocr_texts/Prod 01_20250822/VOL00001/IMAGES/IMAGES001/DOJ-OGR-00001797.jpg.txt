1, The Materials Are Subject-to. Disclosure Under Brady Because They Refute the

Government’s Theory of the. Charged :‘Crimes

The government states that, as part of 1 its “broader investigation into Epstein’s sexual. abuse:
of minors,” it interviewed “dozens” of alleged victims ‘of | Epstein’ s sexual abuse and obtained
sensitive documents and photographs ‘from certain alleged victims who claim they were assaulted.
after 1997 —i.¢:, after the end.of the time period charged in;Counts, One'through. Four, of the
superseding indictineént (the “Indictment”). (Dkt: 60 at 2). Stated differently, the governinent has
interviewed and collected evidence from numerous: ‘witnesses who have fever. asserted that Ms..
anything: whatsoever: to do with, any episode of sexual abuse ‘they may’ have experienced.
Although the government represents, that. these women were’ sexually ‘abused by Epstein'after the
time period charged in Counts One through Four of the Indictment, this evidence ‘is still
fundamentally inconsistent with the government’s théory that Ms. Maxwell.was. Epstein’s:

“madam” and the principal facilitator of his sexual abuse scheme.

Furthermore; this evidence directly:contradicts the. government’s theory of the perjury.
counts. The government insists that the Materials are irrelevant to the. charges 'in'the Indictment
because 'théy relate to instaricés of’sexual abuse that took place after 1997, and therefore. “post-date
the time period charged in the: Indictment.” (Dkt. 60 at.2). That:is incorrect. The government
forgets that it chose to put at issue Epstein’s sexual abuse that occurred. after 1.997 when. it
included the perjury counts in‘the Indictment.

The Pet} uty counts stem from a defamation suit. brought against Ms. Maxwell in 201 5 by
join. a, lawsuit challenging the validity of: Epstein’ s Non- Prosecution. ‘Agreement executed i in 3007.
Accuser-],’s motion “described:Maxwell’s. role as one of the main women who Epstein. used fo
procure under-aged. girls for sexual, activities, and 'aprimary co-conspirator and participant. in his,
sexual, abuse and sex trafficking scheme.” (/Acciiser=1] vi Maxwell, 15*CV-07433 (RWS)
(S.D.N.Y.), Dkt. | at {.27). Ms. Maxwell ‘publicly. denied.Accuser-1’s allegations, claiming that:
they-were untrue. Accuser-1, in turn, claimed:that:these statements were:defamatory and sued Ms.
Maxwell.

Counts Five and, Six allege that Ms. Maxwell lied at: two different: depositions, in this case.
The scope of these depositions was. not limitéd:to the 1994-1997 timefranié. On-the contrary, Ms.
Maxwell was: asked questions: about, among other. things, her anew ege of: Epstein's S: » sexual
