1. The Proposed Additional Bail Conditions Will Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s

Appearance in Court

As set forth above, Ms. Maxwell now proposes two additional restrictions that eliminate
any means or opportunity that she may have to leave the country. The Court should therefore
reconsider its earlier ruling and grant bail under the proposed conditions. See United States v.
Rowe, No. 02 CR. 756 LMM, 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2003) (“[A] release
order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on reconsideration was known to
the movant at the time of the original hearing.”); see also United States v. Petrov, No. 15-CR-66-
LTS, 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting “Court’s inherent authority for
reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).

A. Renunciation of Foreign Citizenship

To demonstrate her commitment to abide by her conditions of release and to provide
further assurance to the Court that she will not attempt to leave the country, Ms. Maxwell is
willing to formally renounce her foreign citizenships in France and the United Kingdom. Should
the Court feel this drastic condition is necessary, the required documents will be submitted to the
appropriate authorities. Moreover, as a standard condition of bail, all of Ms. Maxwell’s
passports will be surrendered to the government and no further application will be made.

If the Court deems it a necessary condition of release, Ms. Maxwell will formally
commence the procedure to renounce her foreign citizenship. The requisite paperwork is in the
process of being completed. Renunciation of UK citizenship can be accomplished immediately
upon granting of bail. The process of renouncing her French citizenship, while not immediate,
may be expedited.

Citizenship is a precious and priceless asset. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to give up
citizenship from the county of her birth and the country of her upbringing demonstrates her
