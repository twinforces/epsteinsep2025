B. Ms. Maxwell Has Provided a Thorough Review of Her Finances for the
Past Five Years

The goveriiment raised concefiis at the initial bail hearing about the accuracy aid.
completeness of the financial disclosures that Ms. Maxwell provided to Pretrial Services.
(Dkt. 22 at 11-12: Tr. 28-29, 34-35). The Court stated that it didnot have “a clear‘picture of
Ms. Maxwell's finances and the. resources available to -her” and therefore. had no way “to set
financial bail conditions that. could reasonably assure her appearance in court.” (Tr. 86-87).

To. address the Court’s questions about Ms. Maxwell’s ‘finarices, défense counsel.
retained Macalvins, a highly reputable accounting firm in.the United. Kingdom, to conduct
an analysis of Ms. Maxwell’s assets and finances for the past five years. The Macalvins
accouiitaiits. reviewed thousaiids of pages of financial. documeiits, including bank statements,
tax returns, FBAR filings, and other materials to create a.clear picture of the assets. held by
Ms. Maxwell and. her spouse, ‘as well as any assets held ‘in trust ‘for the benefit of Ms.
Maxwell, and the source of those assets from 2015-2020. This analysis, which is based. in
‘substantial part. on documents that the government provided in discovery, has involved.a
significant amount of work and has takén substantial time to complete. It was-not-possible
to perform. this analysis in the brief time between. Ms. .Maxwell’s arrest and.the initial bail
hearing, especially with Ms. Maxwell detained. following her arrest.

The Macalviiis report was also reviewed by[ __], a Certified Fraud Examiner
and a. former IRS Special Agent with over 40 years of experience in complex financial fraud
investigations. As a Special Agent, [ ‘investigated numerous financial. fraud and criminal
tax cases, including several inthis District. [ reviewed the Macalvins report.and the
underlying documents and determined that it presents a‘complete.and accurate summary of the

assets held. by.Ms. Maxwell and her'spouse, as'well as assets:thatwere, or aré, currently, held. in
