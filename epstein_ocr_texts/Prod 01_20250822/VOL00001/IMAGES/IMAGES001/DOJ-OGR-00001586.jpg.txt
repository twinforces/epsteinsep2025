the United Kingdom and France, aswell as a citizen of the United States, and.has ‘passports for
each country; has traveled internationally in:the past; and has financial means. And echoing
recent media stories, the government speculates that Ms. Maxwell was “hiding” from law
enforcement during the pendency of the investigation, even ‘though she has been.in regular
contact with.the government, through. counsel, since Epstein’s arrest. Finally, the government
