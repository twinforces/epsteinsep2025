Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36_ Filed 07/24/19 Page 14 of 74 La

1 Your Honor, with a case that's no longer covert, we

2 have been able to dramatically expand the scope of our

3 investigation in just the last week. And that additional

4 evidence builds on a case that was already indicted by a grand
5 jury, that already included evidence of dozens of alleged

6 victims, that already included significant corroborated

7 evidence, evidence that led to the charges for which this

8 66-year-old defendant could serve up to 45 years in prison.

9 The defendant has essentially conceded that the

10 government will be able to prove the elements of the crimes

11 currently alleged. They acknowledged in their submission that
12 the government likely will be able to show that the defendant
13 engaged in sex acts for money with girls he knew were under

14 age.

15 Now, in the face of all of this evidence and the

16 extraordinary incentives for the defendant to flee, what does
17 the defendant propose? Nothing that would meaningfully

18 mitigate the risks of danger and especially flight.

19 THE COURT: Are you talking about the bail package
20 now?
21 MR. ROSSMILLER: Yes, your Honor.
22 So in the first instance, the defendant's one-page
23 financial disclosure form is more significant for what it does
24 not include than what it does. It is cursory, as the Court
25 said, at best.
