‘Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page14of74 14
Your Honor, with a case that's no longer covert, we

have been able to dramatically expand the scope of: our

investigation in just the last ‘week. And Chat additional

evidence builds oh a cdsé that. was alréady indicted by a grand

jury, that already included ‘evidence of dozens of alleged

victims, that already included significant corroborated

evidence, evidence that. led to the charges for which, this
66-year-old defendant? could serve up to 45 years in prison.

The defendant ‘has essentially conceded that the

government will be able to prove the elements of the crimes
currently alleged. They acknowledged in their submission that

the government likély will be able to show that. the defendant’

engaged in sex acts fioor money with girls he knew were under
age.

Now, in the face of all of this evidence and the
extrdordinary ‘incentives for the defendant to flee, what does
the. defendant propose? Nothing thdt would meaningfully
mitigate the risks of danger and especially flight.

THE COURT: Are you talking about the bail package

now?

MR; ROSSMILLER: YeS, your Honor.

So in the first instance, the defendant's one-page
financial disclosure form, is more significant for what it does
not include than what it does. It is cursory, as the Court,

Said, at best.
