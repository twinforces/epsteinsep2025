suffered severe professional and reputational damage simply by being associated with her. Ms.
Maxwell therefore did what any responsible person would do — she separated herself from
everyone she cares about and removed herself from the public eye in order to keep herself and
her friends out of harm’s way.”

Lacking any evidence required under the governing standard that Ms. Maxwell
presents an “actual risk of flight,” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75, the government’s flight risk
argument is reduced to the following: Ms. Maxwell is a woman of means who has foreign
citizenship and has traveled internationally in the past, and who now faces serious charges.
But if that were sufficient, then virtually every defendant with a foreign passport and any
meaningful amount of funds would need to be detained as a flight risk. See Hung v. United
States 439 U.S. 1326, 1329 (1978) (to detain based on risk of flight, government must show
more than “opportunities for flight,” and instead must establish an “inclination on the part of
[the defendant] to flee”). That is not what the Bail Reform Act requires. Indeed, courts in
this Circuit and elsewhere commonly find that bail conditions can adequately address risk of
flight, even where individuals have foreign citizenship and passports or otherwise substantial
foreign connections, and financial means. See, e.g., Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 66; United States v.
Hansen, 108 F. App’x 331 (6th Cir. 2004); United States v. Hanson, 613 F. Supp. 2d 85 (D.D.C.
2009); United States v. Bodmer, No. 03-cr-947(SAS), 2004 WL 169790, at *2-3 (S.D.N.Y.
Jan. 28. 2004); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129 (D.D.C. 2004); United States v.
Kashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 1050-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1989).

Finally, the ongoing travel restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic would
pose a significant hurdle to Ms. Maxwell’s ability to flee the United States, particularly to
” The media spotlight has also drawn out people who claim to speak for Ms. Maxwell, and even purport to have had
direct communications with her, but who, in fact, have no ties to Ms. Maxwell whatsoever. One such person has
even given numerous television interviews on news shows in the United Kingdom.
