Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page15 of 31
STANDARD OF REVIEW
The question of whether a bail package will reasonably assure the
defendant’s presence is a mixed question of law and fact. United States
v. Horton, 653 F. App’x 46, 47 (2d Cir. 2016). This Court reviews the
district court’s purely factual findings for clear error. Jd. However, the
district court’s ultimate finding “may be subject to plenary review if it
rests on a predicate finding which reflects a misperception of a legal
rule applicable to the particular factor involved.” Jd. at 319-20 (quoting
United States v. Shakur, 817 F.2d 189, 197 (2d Cir. 1987)). That is,
“even if the court’s finding of a historical fact relevant to that factor is
not clearly erroneous, [the appellate court] may reverse if the court
evinces a misunderstanding of the legal significance of that historical
fact and if that misunderstanding infects the court's ultimate finding.”
Shakur, 817 F.2d at 197.
