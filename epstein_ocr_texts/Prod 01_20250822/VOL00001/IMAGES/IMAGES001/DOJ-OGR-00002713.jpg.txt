Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 148 Filed 02/04/21 Page 20 of 23

Court may-order the disclosure when a balancing of the defendant’s need. for-disclosure and. the
government's need for:concealment. indicates that such an order*would. be in the interests of
justice. See Cannone,528 F.2d at 300-02. Trial courts generally exercise discretion to order.
such disclosure upon a. finding that a-defendant’s request. is material to the preparation of the case
and is otherwise reasonable. See id: at 300-01. Courts assess the. materiality:and reasonableness:
‘of the request through the application of a six-factor test set. forth in. United States v. ‘Lurkish, 458

'P. Supp. 874:(S.D.N.¥. 1978):

l. Did the offense. alleged :in the indictment :involve.a crime. of'violence?
2. Have the defendants been. arrested, or convicted for-crimes involving violence?
3. Will the, evidence:in the case largely consist of testimony relating to.documents

(which. by: their-nature are. noteasily altered)?
4. Is. there a realistic possibility that supplying the witnesses’ names prior to trial will
increase the likelihood. that. the prosecution's witnesses, will not appear at: trial, or

will be unwilling to ‘testify at'trial?

5. Does the indictment: allege offenses occurring over an extended period oftime,,
making preparation of the defendants’ defense complex and difficult?

6. Do the defendants. have limited'funds with which 'to investigate and prépare their
defense?

Id, at, 881.

Here, the application ofthe, 7irkish ‘factors favors éarly disclosure of the identitiés of the
criminal. history; and the: government has conceded. that she is not.a. danger to. the community.
The age of the charged offenses and the complications imposed bya. global. pandemic, makes
investigation and'preparation, of this case complex and difficult. Disclosure of the government’s
‘witness list is:material to, the preparation of the defense and reasonable.in light of the

circumstances surrounding this case.
