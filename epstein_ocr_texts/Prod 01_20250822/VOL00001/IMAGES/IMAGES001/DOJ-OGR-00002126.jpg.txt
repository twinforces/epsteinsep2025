Ghislaine Maxwell
Opinion on French Extradition Law
OVERVIEW

e This report was written pursuant to a request from Olivier Laude, a partner at the French
firm Laude Esquier Champey acting on behalf of Cohen & Gresser LLP as counsel for
Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, in the context of ongoing bail proceedings involving the latter
in the United States of America (hereafter “USA”), where Ms Ghislaine Maxwell is
being detained pre-trial on charges relating to her alleged role in sexual activities
between Jeffrey Epstein and certain minor girls, from 1994 to 1997.

e Olivier Laude has instructed me to draft an opinion regarding the French extradition
procedure and the possibility for Ms Ghislaine Maxwell to be extradited from France to
the USA if she were to flee to France after being released on bail in the USA.

e As requested, I have attached a resume. (See Exhibit A).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

e The principle against the extradition of French nationals does not constitute a binding
rule of international law and is not considered a constitutional principle under French
law.

e The extradition of French nationals can be prohibited under the terms of an international
treaty. However, the existing Extradition Treaty between France and the USA of 23
April 1996 does not contain such prohibition. As a result, the extradition of a French
national to the USA is legally permissible under French law.

e Jn order to assure the US authorities that she will not attempt to contest her extradition
as a French citizen or otherwise, we are informed that Ms Maxwell is about to execute
an irrevocable waiver of her right to seek the protection of the French Courts to fight
