spent the last two decades without facing consequences for her criminal actions. For years before
her arrest in this case, the defendant likely believed she had gotten away with her crimes. That
illusion has now been shattered, and she has a host of new reasons to use her considerable resources
to flee.

Moreover, the defendant’s willingness to brazenly lie under oath about her conduct,
including some of the conduct charged in the Indictment, strongly suggests her true motive has
been and remains to avoid being held accountable for her crimes, rather than to avoid the media.
As alleged in the Indictment, in 2016, when the defendant was given the opportunity to address
her conduct with minors in the context ofa civil suit, she lied repeatedly. Those lies are, of course,
the subject of two counts of perjury, and they evidence her willingness to flout the law in order to
protect herself. The defendant’s lies under oath should give the Court serious pause about trusting
this defendant to comply with conditions of bail.

IV. The Defendant’s Bail Proposal Offers No Security For Her Appearance

In its opening memorandum, the Government highlighted the defendant’s extensive means
to flee and her opaque finances. In her response, the defendant’s brief provides zero information
about her assets in the United States or abroad. The Court should be troubled by this. First, so
far as the Government is aware, the defendant has not filled out a financial affidavit, under penalty
of perjury, in connection with her application for bail, meaning that the Court has no reliable
insight into the magnitude or scope of the defendant’s resources. However, what the Court does
have are strong indicia that the defendant has access to enormous resources, including the large
property she was found on, the private security guard being retained to live with her on that
* The Government understands from Pretrial Services that the defendant has indicated that she has
less than a million dollars in bank accounts. The report has not yet been released. As discussed
below, the Court should have serious pause before accepting this unverified information.
