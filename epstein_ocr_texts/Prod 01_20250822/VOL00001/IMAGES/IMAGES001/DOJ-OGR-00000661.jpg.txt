1 told that the medical examiner had seen nine minutes of one

2 video which was on a stairwell between floors at the MCC. She
3 was told that the principal video that would have showed the

4 whole hall was corrupted. It was in DC with the FBI to see if
5 they can reconstruct it.

6 And I asked the same questions that my co-counsel did,
7 you know, was the dysfunction of the critical pivotal video, in
8 the most secure prison east of Florence, out in Colorado known
9 to the MCC before August 10, or was this corruption occurring
10 on August 10, which would again cause us to be skeptical of the
11 servitude of the medical examiner's conclusions that this was
12 suicide rather than some other cause.

14 question of trust or not trust. They ask you to detain people
15 and you trust the Bureau of Prisons. And it is within your

18 We are angry about the conditions he was held in. And
19 we're also angry, quite frankly, your Honor, that the only
20 source of information that we get as to what happened to him is
al through the media rather than through the United States
22 Attorney's office. We've made requests informal. We have
23 made Touhy requests. We've been told there is a pending
24 investigation.
25 But we trust your Honor and the judiciary, and with
