As the Government has. repeatedly emphasized, the strong possibility that ‘the defendant
could. successfully resist extradition only heightens the defendant’s incentive to flec. (Dkt. No.
100 at 19-20). Indecd, ‘in rejecting’ the defendant’s offer in the Second Bail, Motion to execute
anticipatory extradition waivers, the Court. noted, among other things, “the likelihood. that any
extradition Would be a difficult and lengthy process.” (Dee. Op. at.13). The Court ‘further noted
that the “likelihood that:the Defendant: would be: able: to frustrate any extradition requests—even.
ifshe were correct that she would’be unable to stop extradition entirely —weighs'strongly:in favor
of detention.” (/d.).. That statement. remains true even. if the face: of the defendant’s newest: offer

Op. at.10-11). The defendant’s alleged. willingness to renounce her foreign citizenship should not.
fundamentally alter'the Court’s conclusions.

account that “will be: monitored. by'a retired federal District Court judge'and former United States
Attorney who will function as assct monitor and will have:co-signing authority. over the account.”
(Mot. at 2). ‘This proposed condition—the details. of which are, vague—is insufficient. to ensure

depend. entirely: on the monitor having a completcly.accurate picture of the defendant’s finances
and access to all of her accounts and sources of wealth. Given. the: Court’s concerns about. the

In/any event, cven. if the Court were to acccpt the defendant’s representations about. her
assets at face value, the defendant’s ‘proposal would leave the defendant with significant. assets
