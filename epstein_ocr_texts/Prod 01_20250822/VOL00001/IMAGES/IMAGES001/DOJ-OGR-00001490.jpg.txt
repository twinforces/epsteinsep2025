the defendant would encourage victims to accept Epstein’s offers of financial assistance, including
offers to pay for travel or educational expenses. The victims were as young as 14 years old when
they were groomed and abused by Maxwell and Epstein, both of whom knew that their victims
were minors.

The Indictment further alleges that the defendant lied under oath to conceal her crimes. In
2016, the defendant gave deposition testimony in connection with a civil lawsuit in the Southern
District of New York. During the deposition, the defendant was asked questions about her role in
facilitating the abuse of minors. The defendant repeatedly lied under oath when questioned about
her conduct with minor girls.

ARGUMENT
I. Applicable Law

Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal courts are empowered to
order a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a
danger to the community or a risk of flight. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e). A finding of risk of flight must
be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Patriarca, 948 F.2d
789, 793 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987); United States v.
Chimurenga, 760 F.2d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 1985). A finding of dangerousness must be supported by
clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540, 542 (2d Cir.
1995); Patriarca, 948 F.2d at 792; Chimurenga, 760 F.2d at 405.

The Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (1) the
nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;
(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]
financial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See
