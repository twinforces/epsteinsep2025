Thank you, your Honor.

And then just one last one, and this, is ‘much shorter.

Statement of Jane Doe, also my client.
I was a 'modél in another country when I came 'to the
United States. I. was. told by a booker that I needed to meet
with a man named Jeffrey Epstein, who was, ‘the owner of
Victoria's Seeret. The booker told. me that Mr. Epstein could
help mé gét into Victoria Secret's world.

It was my childhood dream to be a Victoria's. Secret
modél. So I wént one day ih the afternoon and I met
Mr. Epstein in his office in his mansion in New York. A woman,
introduced herself and suggested to mé that I should be

extremely nice to Mr. Epstein, because if he liked me, he would,

probably have photographers shooting photdés of me right away.

Fhe told me to go upstairs and, dinected ime to Jeffrey
Epstein's office. Mr. Epstein had a white robe on and we
chatted very briefly. I had my portfolio of ‘photos, but he
didn't, evén look at it. Suddenly, he took his robe off and gét
close to me. iL got up to leave, but. the door was Locked.

I didn't. khow what was gé6ang oh. It. was my first
official meeting to be cast in, the Unated States. I was a
young girl and confused. He got véry close t6 mie, and I Had a
Skirt on. He started to touch my genitals. I refused Him.
Then he went to the massage table and showed me the vibrator.
