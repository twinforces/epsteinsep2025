4 Statement of Jane Doe, also my client.

5 I was a model in another country when I came to the

6 United States. I was told by a booker that I needed to meet

7 with a man named Jeffrey Epstein, who was the owner of

8 Victoria's Secret. The booker told me that Mr. Epstein could

9 help me get into Victoria Secret's world.

10 It was my childhood dream to be a Victoria's Secret

11 model. So I went one day in the afternoon and I met

12 Mr. Epstein in his office in his mansion in New York. A woman
13 introduced herself and suggested to me that I should be

14 extremely nice to Mr. Epstein, because if he liked me, he would
15 probably have photographers shooting photos of me right away.
16 The told me to go upstairs and directed me to Jeffrey
17 Epstein's office. Mr. Epstein had a white robe on and we

18 chatted very briefly. I had my portfolio of photos, but he

19 didn't even look at it. Suddenly, he took his robe off and got
20 close to me. I got up to leave, but the door was locked.
21 I didn't know what was going on. It was my first
22 official meeting to be cast in the United States. I was a
23 young girl and confused. He got very close to me, and I had a
24 skirt on. He started to touch my genitals. I refused him.
25 Then he went to the massage table and showed me the vibrator.
