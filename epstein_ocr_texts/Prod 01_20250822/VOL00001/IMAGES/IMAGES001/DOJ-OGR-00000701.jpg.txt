The fact ‘that he felt entitled to take away my
innocence, the fact that he felt that he could do whatever he

me years to tell anyone what Epstein did to me because I was so

ashamed and embarrassed at what people would Say or think of me

until I found out there were other victims, girls just Jike me.
T knew I coulda ho longer keep my Silence no matter how ruthless
and. powerful Epstein was, and still is even after his death,

The fact I will never have a Ghance to face my
predator in court eats away at my soul. Even in death, Epstein
is trying to hurt. me. I Had Hopéd to at last get an apolday,,

anymore.

I am a survivor. The many that stand before me here

today that have shared the horrific experiences with this
