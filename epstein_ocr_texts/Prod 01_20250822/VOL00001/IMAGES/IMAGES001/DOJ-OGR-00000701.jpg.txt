1 The fact that he felt entitled to take away my

2 innocence, the fact that he felt that he could do whatever he

3 wanted, regardless of the laws, hurts me so very much. It took

10 predator in court eats away at my soul. Even in death, Epstein
11 is trying to hurt me. I had hoped to at last get an apology,
12 but this evil man had no remorse or caring for what he did to
13 anyone. I felt let down by the people who were supposed to

14 watch him in prison. They let this man kill himself and kill
15 the chance of justice for so many others in the process, taking
16 away our ability to speak.

23 anymore.
24 I am a survivor. The many that stand before me here
25 today that have shared the horrific experiences with this
