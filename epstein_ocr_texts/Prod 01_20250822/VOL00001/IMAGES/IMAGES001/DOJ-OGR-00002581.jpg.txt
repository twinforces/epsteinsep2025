not expired, would be punishable by up to three months in prison — /ess time than Ms.
Maxwell has already spent in pretrial detention. Yet, here, that misdemeanor has
been set up as the basis for federal charges for which the government seeks to impose
years of imprisonment, if not the equivalent of a life term. Not only is this troubling
in approach, but even the pieced-together Mann Act charges are time-barred under
the applicable statute of limitations.

The hue and cry against Ms. Maxwell is unprecedented in both scale and severity. Under
our system of justice, the need for the Court’s careful scrutiny of the government’s conduct, and
for the protection of the constitutional rights of a defendant facing the equivalent of a life
