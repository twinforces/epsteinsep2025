a.country that, docs not extradite its citizens, has access to untold.financial resourecs, and-has every
‘motivation to escape accountability for her appalling crimes. See United States %. Boustani, 356 F.
Supp. 3d:246, 255 (E.D.N.¥.. 2019) (“[T]he combination of Defendant’s alleged.deceptive actions,
access to ‘substantial, financial resourees, frequent ‘international; travel, complete: lack: of tics to the

3681423, .at-*8 (S.D.N.Y. June 16,.20.6)). The defendant’s:proposed bail ‘package is essentially’
nothing more than an unenforceable promise to:return to Court.. Given-the gravity ofthe charged

V. The COVID-19 Pandemic Does Not Warrant The Defendant’s Release

Finally, the current pandemie is not a reason to release this defendant. Indeed, courts in.
this. district have regularly rejected applications for release bascd on assertions about. the
generalized risks of COVID-19. See, e:g., United States v. Paulino, No. 19 Cr..54 (PGG), 2020
WE 1847914, at.*6 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 13, 2020) (Gardephe, J.) (denying bail application by defendant:
with hypertension, stating that “[a]s scrious as it is, the outbreak of COVID-19 simply: does not
override the-statutory detention provisions [of the Bail Reform Act]” (internal quotation omitted));

(“[B]ecause’there is.a pandemie.docs not .mean,that. ‘the jailhouse doors ought to be thrown,

open”)). Significantly, the defendant has not claimed that she is at.a higher risk: from. COVID-1.9
