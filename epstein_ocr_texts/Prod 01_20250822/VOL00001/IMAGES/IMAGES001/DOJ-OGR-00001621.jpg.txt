property, and the multi-million dollar property in the United Kingdom being offered as collateral.
Indeed, it is revealing that the defendant’s memorandum declines to discuss her assets or the assets
to which she plainly has access. Without knowing the full scope of the defendant’s financial
resources, it would be impossible for the Court to even begin to evaluate whether conditions of
bail would mitigate her risk of flight. More importantly, the defendant cannot claim that she has
met her significant burden to rebut the presumption of detention in this case when she has failed
to provide comprehensive, verified financial information under penalty of perjury.

Although the Government submits that no conditions of bail could reasonably assure the
defendant’s continued appearance, the defendant’s proposed bail package offers almost no security
whatsoever. The defendant appears to have significant assets, she has extensive foreign ties and
is a citizen of a country that does not extradite its citizens to the United States, and she is charged
with serious crimes involving the sexual exploitation of minors — and yet, she asks the Court to
grant her bail secured only by a foreign property, which provides effectively no security at all.

Indeed, it is curious that a defendant who appears to have access to millions of dollars has
not offered to post a single dime as collateral for the bond she proposes. Instead, as noted, she
offers as security a foreign property, which is effectively meaningless. As a practical matter, the
Government has no direct way to proceed against foreign property or sureties through bail
forfeiture, because the Government cannot seize a foreign citizen’s assets abroad or sell property
in another nation based on a United States bail forfeiture judgment. The Government would be
required to attempt to litigate a property dispute in another country, with a lengthy process and an
uncertain outcome.

Additionally, the defendant proffers no information about her proposed co-signers other
than that they are friends and relatives — in particular, she provides no information about the assets
