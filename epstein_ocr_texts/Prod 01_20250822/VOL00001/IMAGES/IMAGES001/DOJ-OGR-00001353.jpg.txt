Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) SO ORDERED.
Ghislaine Maxwell, Reg. No. 2879-509
Dear Judge Nathan:
This letter is written in response to Order granted on January 15, 2021, concerning Ghislaine
Maxwell, Reg. 02879-509., an inmate currently confined at the Metropolitan Detention Center (’MDC”’) in
Brooklyn, New York. The MDC Brooklyn respectfully requests that Your Honor vacate the Order given
MDC Brooklyn was not given the opportunity to object to defense counsel’s claims, although the objection
had been reiterated to the U.S. Attorney’s Office numerous times.
Defense counsel expressed various concerns regarding Ms. Maxwell’s confinement limiting her
access to discovery. However, Ms. Maxwell has received a significant amount of time to review her
discovery. On November 18, 2020, the Government provided the MDC Brooklyn with a laptop for Ms.
Maxwell to use to review discovery. Ms. Maxwell has been and will continue to be permitted to use that
laptop to review her discovery for thirteen (13) hours per day, five (5) days per week. In addition to the
Government laptop, she has access to the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers. Although defense counsel
has indicated that the MDC Brooklyn discovery computers are not equipped to read all of her electronic
discovery, the computers are capable of reviewing most of the electronic discovery. Despite defense
counsel’s claim that Ms. Maxwell’s lacks sufficient time to fully review her discovery, her consistent use of
Government laptop and MDC Brooklyn’s discovery computers undercuts this claim.
Moreover, Ms. Maxwell continues to have contact with her legal counsel five (5) days per week, three
(3) hours per day via video-teleconference and via telephone; this 1s far more time than any other MDC
inmate is allotted to communicate with their attorneys.
