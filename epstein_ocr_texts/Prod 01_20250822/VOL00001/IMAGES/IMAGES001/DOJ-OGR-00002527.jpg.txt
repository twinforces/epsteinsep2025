interest to stop what would. have been a.one-way discovery process in favor of Ms. Maxwell, the
that:

e “should discovery in civil action,go forward, multiple-witnesses or potential
witnesses at the criminal trial ;would'be subject to. deposition”

° “any concern regarding the potential. delay of this civil. suit is outweighed. by the:
concern that Maxwell: would seek:to assert her Fifth Amendment-rights rather
than submit,to a deposition in the civil action, and that depositions of other
witnesses could ‘potentially interfere‘with the criminal, prosecution”

o “permitting any’ discovery‘to proceed in-this lawsuit would enable Maxwell. to
seck a’preview of trial testimony: in, the criminal case, and. would. afford. her witha
broader array of discovery. than. she is entitled to in.the criminal case”

° ‘a complaint concerning sexual abuse of minors ’by‘Epstein, and Maxwell will
inevitably. implicate documents, witnesses, and. other evidence that overlaps with
the criminal matter, whether or not the plaintiff'in ‘this action—or'the conduct she
alleges—has any direct.connection:to the charges. in the Indictment”

Case No. 20-cv-484, Dkt. 80.

These admissions make clear that, the government ‘was aware ofthe substantial overlap
between. the allegations :it:investigated more:than a‘decade before:this Indictment. The sharp
contrast; between the government’s actions ‘in this Jane.Doe civil matter, and the Annie Farmer
civil matter, the Giuffre matter, and the.Ransome matter also establish a strong infcrenec that as
long as the government stood to gain a-tactical advantage by delaying the indictment (the: sought-
aftcr deposition in the /:armer civil litigation), it:;would not move’ to intervene. However, ‘where
the government’s tactical advantage was lost or threatened (Jane Doc) it;would. shut the case
down.

Ms. Maxwell. requests that the Court dismiss the Indictment because of the prejudicial

and tactical delay by the government in prosecuting this. case.
