108a
point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta
and Villafafia that in his absence Lourie had agreed
“to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the following
work week at his new post at the Department in
Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO
colleagues by phone and email.

In a Sunday, September 16, 2007 email, Villafania
informed Lefkowitz that she had drafted a factual
proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea
proposal. In that email, Villafafia also noted that she
was considering filing charges in the federal district
court in Miami, “which will hopefully cut the press
coverage significantly.” This email received considerable
attention 12 years later when it was made public
during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence
of the USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the
victims. Villafafia, however, explained to OPR that she
was concerned that news media coverage would
violate the victims’ privacy. She told OPR, “(If [the
victims] wanted to attend [the plea hearing], I wanted
them to be able to go into the courthouse without their
faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that
such publicity was less likely to happen in Miami,
where the press “in general does not care about what
happens in Palm Beach.”

Lefkowitz responded to Villafafia with a revised
version of her latest proposed “hybrid” plea agreement,
in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly,
this defense proposal introduced two new provisions.
The first related to four female assistants who had
weekend|[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal
reasons], ... and this occurred during a time when out of office
access to email was very limited.” Records show her supervisors
were aware that at times she used her personal email account in
communicating with defense counsel in this case.
