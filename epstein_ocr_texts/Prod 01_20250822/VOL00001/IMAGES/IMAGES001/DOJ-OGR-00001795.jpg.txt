Re: United States v., Ghislaine Maxwell, 20.Cr. 330 (ASN).

‘Dear Judge Nathan:

‘We write.on. behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, in. opposition. to, the government’s
October 6, 2020 letter-requésting the Court’s:pérmission to delay the disclosure of photographs
and documents relating to certain alleged:victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein (the
“Materials”, pursuant: to Rule 16(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal ‘Procedure. (Dkt, 60).
The g government’ 's request should be denied for two reasons.

First, itis clear from'the government’s letter that the Materials pertain to individuals who
claim:to have been “sexually abused by [Jeffrey] Epstein” (id. at 2), but who have:not accused Ms.
Maxwell of participating in or facilitating that: conduct in.any way. Accordingly, the Materials.
identifying these witnesses and-their’ prior: statements.are exculpatory evidence, which must:be
disclosed pursuant to the government’s obligations under, Brady v. Marvland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)
and its progeny.

; Second, the ‘Court should order. the government'to disclose the Materials under Rule 16
because the Materials are “material to preparing the defense” and the government /has:not shown
good cause’to delay production ofthe Materials under Rule 16(d)(1).

We note that yesterday we sent*the government:a Ictter making specific Brady-requests, including “any statements
or written communications'made by: any witness: who. has alleged ‘that:she was sexually: abused-or-assaulted by“Mr.
Epstein, but‘has*not alleged that Ms. Maxwell participated in, was involved in, or facilitated ‘the alleged sexual abuse.”
