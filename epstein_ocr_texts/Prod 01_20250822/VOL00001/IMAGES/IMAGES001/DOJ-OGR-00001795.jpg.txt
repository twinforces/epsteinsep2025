Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

We write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, in opposition to the government’s
October 6, 2020 letter requesting the Court’s permission to delay the disclosure of photographs
and documents relating to certain alleged victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein (the
“Materials”), pursuant to Rule 16(d)(1) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. (Dkt. 60).
The government’s request should be denied for two reasons.

First, it is clear from the government’s letter that the Materials pertain to individuals who
claim to have been “sexually abused by [Jeffrey] Epstein” (id. at 2), but who have not accused Ms.
Maxwell of participating in or facilitating that conduct in any way. Accordingly, the Materials
identifying these witnesses and their prior statements are exculpatory evidence, which must be
disclosed pursuant to the government’s obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963)
and its progeny.’

Second, the Court should order the government to disclose the Materials under Rule 16
because the Materials are “material to preparing the defense” and the government has not shown
good cause to delay production of the Materials under Rule 16(d)(1).

' We note that yesterday we sent the government a letter making specific Brady requests, including “[a|ny statements

or written communications made by any witness who has alleged that she was sexually abused or assaulted by Mr.

Epstein, but has not alleged that Ms. Maxwell participated in, was involved in, or facilitated the alleged sexual abuse.”
