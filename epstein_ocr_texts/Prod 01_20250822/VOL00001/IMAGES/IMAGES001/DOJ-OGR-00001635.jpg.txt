Re: Whited States. v.Ghislaine Maxwell, Case No. 20 Cr..330(AJN), Local. Criminal, Rule 23.1
Dear Judge Nathan,

On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we write fo request that the Court enter an
ordcr prohibiting the:Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making’ extrajudicial
Statements concerning this casc. Although Ms. Maxwell is. presumed, innocent, the Government,
its.agents, witnesses and their lawyers have made, and continue:to make, statements:prejudicial
toa fair trial. The: Sixth ‘Amendment to the United States Constitution g guarantecs an accused the
toa fair trial, which: requires ‘that ; a "defendant must be judged by a a jury of. her peers based on,
evidence presented. at:trial, not in. the media. The Court, to safeguard the duc process rights of the
accuséd, has “an affirmative constitutional duty to minimize the cffeets ofprejudicial. pretrial
publicity.” Gannett Co. -v. DePasquale, 443. U.S. 368, 378 (1.979).. This District.has‘g given effect.
to:this Sixth Amendment right through Local. Criminal Rule 23.1. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell.
requests that the Court exercise its. express power under Local Criminal! Rule 23.1(h) and enter
an Order requiring compliance ‘with that rule to prevent further unwarranted and prejudicial
‘pretrial. publicity by the Government, its agents, and lawyers for alleged wittiesses.

Legal Standard

More than fifty -ycars ago, warning’ of the danger of pretrial ‘publicity: to fair trials, the:
Supreme Court directed trial judges to take “such steps by rule and regulation that-will. protect
their processes. from. prejudicial. outside:interferences. Neither prosecutors, counsel for defense,
the accused, witnesses, court staff nor'enforcement officers coming under the jurisdiction of the
court-should be permitted. to frustrate its finetion.” Sheppard. v. Maxwell, 384 US..333, 363
(1966) (emphasis added).
