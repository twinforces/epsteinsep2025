‘Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36 Filed 07/24/19 Page330f74 33

don't find any case where that says 14 years, and it's over or

it evaporates, etc.

The argument tChotigh is that 14 years ought, to be
enough of a4 period of time. Right?

MR. WEINBERG: I think the premise is that. when the

man was not. under conditions of release, if your Honor was. to

exercise your power to release him, he didn't re-engage in this

activity’ that constitutes the heart. off both the Florida and the

current. New York. prosecutions.

And at. a certain point, when you're dealing with the

government's burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence

going forward in thé future, the idéa that He would abandon his
14 years of self-discipline when he's under conditions of bail

that can result. in his rearrest. and re-detention -- I don't

think the government can carry that. weight or carry that

biirden.

THE COURT: SO I'm very interésted in this quéstion.

It's a very interesting question. As you may or probably know,

there ane studies of recidivism, studies of recidivism directly

rélated to séx offendérs.

T'll sharé with you what I've looked dt bécause I

don't want you to think. I'm researching on my own anything ‘that

you. are not. aware of. These are, I think, government-supported

studiés that meastire recidivism béyond 10 or 14 or 15 years and

that purport, if I read thése Studies, to Show that. the nature.
