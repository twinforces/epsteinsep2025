Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106 Filed 12/30/20 Page 21 of 22

Finally, as the Court expressed at the initial bail hearing, it has deep concerns about the
spread of COVID-19 at BOP facilities, including at the MDC. Indeed, in recent weeks, the
incidence of COVID-19 among the inmate population where the Defendant is housed is truly
alarming. See COVID-19: Coronavirus, Fed. Bureau of Prisons, https://www.bop.gov/
coronavirus/ (last visited Dec. 28, 2020) (noting that the MDC currently has 99 inmates and 11
staff members who have tested positive for COVID-19). It could be argued that in the face of
this, only those defendants who pose a danger to the community ought to be detained pending
trial. If that were the law and in light of the increasing positivity rate, the Court would not
hesitate to reopen the detention hearing and release the Defendant on bail since the Government
rests none of its arguments on dangerousness. But that is not the law. Moreover, as the Court
found at the initial bail hearing, the Defendant has no underlying health conditions that put her at
heightened risk of health impacts were she to contract COVID. The pandemic, including
increasing positivity numbers in the MDC, is not a basis for release in this case where the Court
finds that the Defendant poses a substantial and actual risk of flight and that no combination of
conditions could reasonably assure her appearance.

E. A hearing is unnecessary

Having carefully reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Court determines that a hearing is
unnecessary and that it can resolve the motion on the papers. The briefing from both sides
comprehensively lays out the parties’ respective arguments For the reasons stated above, none
of the new information has a material bearing on the Court’s determination that the Defendant
poses a flight risk. Indeed, many of the reasons that the Court provided at the July 14, 2020
hearing continue to apply with equal, if not greater, force. The Court need not hold another
