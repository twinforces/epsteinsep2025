also named as a potential co-conspirator—and for whom Epstein also obtained protection in—the
NPA. This individual is also one of the employees identified in the Indictment, which alleges that
she and two other identified employees facilitated the defendant’s trafficking of minors by, among
other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the defendant at his
residences in Manhattan and Palm Beach, Florida. This individual was also named and featured
prominently in the Herald series.
II. Police Report

During the Detention Hearing, the parties referenced a redacted copy of a Palm Beach
police report, which was annexed to the Government’s July 12, 2019 detention memorandum. At
the Court’s request, the Government has provided a supplemental copy of the police report
previously filed, with information referred to in open court unredacted. The updated copy of the
police report is attached as Exhibit A.

Ill. Foreign Passport

During the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it had recently
learned that law enforcement agents had seized what appears to be an expired foreign passport (the
“Foreign Passport”) from a safe in the defendant’s Manhattan residence during the execution of a
search warrant on or about July 6, 2019. The Foreign Passport has a photograph that appears to
depict the defendant, but lists a different name. Photographs of that passport are annexed hereto
as Exhibit B. In the same safe, agents discovered what appears to be an expired United States
passport issued to the defendant, in his true name, within three years of the date on the Foreign
Passport. A photograph of that United States passport is annexed hereto as Exhibit C, so that the
Court may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant. Because Exhibits
B and C contain personally identifiable information and sensitive information relevant to the
ongoing investigation, the Government respectfully requests that Exhibits B and C be filed under
seal.

The Government is attempting to obtain additional information about the Foreign Passport,
including how it was obtained and whether the passport is genuine or fabricated. But the
defendant’s possession of what purports to be a foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to
the inference the defendant knows how to obtain false travel documents and/or assume other,
foreign identities. This adds to the serious risk of flight posed by the defendant.”
> The Government has asked defense counsel to advise whether the defendant is currently, or has
been in the past, a citizen or legal permanent resident of a country other than the United States. To
date, defense counsel has declined to respond. Certainly if the defendant is, or has been, a citizen
or permanent resident of another country, that would add significantly to the overwhelming
evidence of risk of flight.
