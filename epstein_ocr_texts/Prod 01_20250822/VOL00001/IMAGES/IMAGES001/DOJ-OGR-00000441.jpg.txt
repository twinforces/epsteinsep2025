also named as a potential, co-conspirator—and.for whom.Epstcin. also obtained. protection in—the
NPA. This individual is also one of the employees identified in the Indictment, which alleges'that:
she aiid two other identified employees facilitated the defendant’s'trafficking;of minors by, among,
‘other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the: defendant at his
residences in, Manhattan and Palm. Beach, Florida. This individual, was also named and ‘featured.

II. Police Report

During the Detention Hearing, the parties referenced a redacted copy of a Palm Beach
police report, which was annexed,to the Government’s July 12,2019 detention:memorandum. At.
the Court’s ‘réquést, the Government has -provided a supplemental copy of the police: report.
previously ‘filed, with information referréd-to in. open, court unredacted. The. updated copy of the
police report.is attached. as Exhibit.A. ;

III. Foreign Passport

During the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that it.had recently
learned that. law enforcement agents had.scized what appears to be:an expired foreign passport. (the
“Foreign Passport”) from.a, safe ‘in, the defendant’s Manhattan residence during the execution ofa.
‘search. warrant on. or about July 6, 20.1.9. The Foreign. Passport has: a. photograph. that appears, to
depict the défendant, but lists a different name. Photographs of’that passport are: annexed hercto
as Exhibit.B. In. the same safc, agents discovered what' appears, to be an, expired United States
passport: issucd ‘to the: defendant, in. his true: name, within. three years of the date on. the Forcign.
Passport. A photograph, of that United States passport is annexed ‘hereto. as Exhibit C, so that the
Court may compare the passports, both of which appear to depict the defendant. Because Exhibits
B and. © contain personally: identifiable information and. sensitive information relevant. to the
ongoing investigation, the Government respectfully requests that Exhibits B and C be filed. under
seal.

The Government is attempting to obtain.additional information about the Foreign Passport,
including how it. was obtained. and. whether the passport is genuine or' fabricated. ‘But the
dcfendant?s possession of what purports to be a foreign passport issued under an alias gives rise to
the inference the defendant knows how to obtain false ‘travel documents and/or assume. other,
foreign identitics. This adds to the scrious risk of flight posed. by the defendant.’

* The Government has ‘asked defense counsel to advise whcther'the defendant is currently, or has
beenin'the- past, a citizen or legal permanent:resident ofa country other than.the United States. To
date, defense:counscl has declined:to respond. Certainly :if'the defendant is, or has been, a citizen.
or permanent ‘resident. of another country, that would. add, significantly to the: overwhelming
evidence of risk of flight.
