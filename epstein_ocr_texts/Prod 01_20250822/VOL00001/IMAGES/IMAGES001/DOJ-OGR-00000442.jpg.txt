IV. Cash and Diamonds
At the Detention Hearing, the Government informed the Court that diamonds and cash
were seized from a safe in the defendant’s Manhattan residence. The Court inquired as to the value
of these items. After conferring with law enforcement agents who have reviewed the materials
from the safe, the Government has learned that the safe contained more than $70,000 in cash. In
addition, the safe contained 48 loose diamond stones, ranging in size from approximately 1 carat
to 2.38 carats, as well as a large diamond ring. The Government is currently unaware of whether
the defendant maintains similar stashes of cash and/or jewels at his multiple properties, or in other
locations. Such ready cash and loose diamonds are consistent with the capability to leave the
jurisdiction at a moment’s notice.
V. Conclusion
For the reasons set forth herein, in the Government’s July 8, 2019 and July 12, 2019
detention memoranda, and on the record at the Detention Hearing, the Court should order that the
defendant be detained pending trial. The defendant cannot meet his burden of overcoming the
presumption that there is no combination of conditions that would reasonably assure his continued
appearance in this case or protect the safety of the community were he to be released.
Respectfully submitted,
