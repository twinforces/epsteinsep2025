In Palmieri v. State of New York, the federal magistrate issued two sealing orders
protecting the confidentiality of settlement discussions of a private antitrust case. 779 F.2d 861,
863-64 (2d Cir. 1985). Because the subject matter of the antitrust case overlapped with an
ongoing state criminal antitrust case, the state Attorney General moved to intervene in the private
antitrust case, to modify the seal orders, to access the settlement material, and to present the
material and testimony to a state grand jury. /d. at 862. The district court granted the Attorney
General’s request, but the Second Circuit, applying Martindell, reversed. Id. The Second Circuit
recognized that the state Attorney General, like the federal government, “enjoys a similarly
privileged position with respect to its investigatory powers.” /d. at 866. Those powers, in turn,
“raise[d] a rebuttable presumption against modification of the orders.” /d. Indeed, given the
parties’ reliance on the sealing orders, the Attorney General’s “burden [was] heavier than it
might otherwise be.” /d. at 865.
