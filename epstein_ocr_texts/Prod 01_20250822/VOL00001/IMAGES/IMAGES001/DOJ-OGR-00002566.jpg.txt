In. Palmieri. Staté of New York, the federal magistrate issued two, scaling orders
protecting the confidentiality of scttlement discussions of a-private antitrust.case. 779 F.2d 861,
863-64 (2d Cir. 1985). Because the subject matter of the: antitrust: case overlapped with an
ongoing staté criminal. antitrust case, ‘the state. Attorney General moved to. intervene. in the private
antitrust case, to:modify the scal, orders, to: aecess the scttlement material, and to present the
material and. testimony to_a state’ grand jury../d. at 862. The district court granted the Attorney’
General’s request, but the Second Circuit, applying.Murtindell, reversed. Jd. The Second Circuit
recognized that the state Attorney General, like the fedcral, government, “enjoys.a similarly
priviléged position with.-respect'to its, investigatory powers.” /d..at 866. Those:powers, in turn,
“taise[d] a rebuttable presumption against: modification of the orders.” Jd. Indeed, given.the
parties’ reliance’ on; the sealing orders, the Attorney: General’s “burden [was] heavier than it

might.otherwise be.” /d. -at.865.
