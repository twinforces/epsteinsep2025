Concerns raised by the government can be addressed, they have
not carried their burden, and this is really a case that should
be stibjzect. to Strict bail conditions to be set by ‘the court,
among other things, to give us any reasonable chance of
fighting this -- preparing and fighting this cdsé to trial.

Thank you, your Honor.

THE COURT: All right. Thank. you, counsel.

Iam prepared to make my “ruling,

Several provisions of federal law govern the court's
determination whether to detain the defendant or release her on
bail pending trial. A Court Must. apply that law equally to all
defendants no matter how high profile the case or well off the
defendant. It. is therefore important. to begin hére with a
clear articulation, of ‘the governing Law.

It is also important to bear in mind that Ms. Maxwell,
like all defendants, is entitled to a full presumption, of
innoecéncé, thdt is, she is presumed innocent and the only
grounds for detention at this stage are, under the law, risk of
flight. Or danger to the Community.

I may consider the weight of the evidence proffered by
the government, at this stage in making this determination, but
unless this matter is mesolved by a plea, it will nemain

entirely for a jury to decide the question. of Ms. Maxwell's

guilt as to the charges contained in the indictment.

Turning to the government's standard under Title 18 of
