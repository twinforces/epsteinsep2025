Draft Agreements?

Hi Jay = I ‘was, hoping there would be. things for:me to read this moming, but ] wall try to remain patient.

I believe there. are only two types of agreements that would apply to this case: (1) a plea agreement to a federal
charge or charges; and (2) a non-prosecution agreement (which is really a, deferred prosecution agreement
because’ the.defendant agrees that if-he violates the agreement, the U.S. can prosecute him).

A plea agreement is part of the court file. It is not accessible on-line via PACER, but someone can yo to the
Clerk’s Office to obtain, a copy.

A non-prosécution agréemeént woulé not bé-made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part of our
case file. It probably would be subject toa FOIA request, but it is no: something that we would distribute
without compulsory process.

On the obstriiction charges, many of the ‘facts | included in that first proffer were hypothesized. based upon aur
discussions and the agents’ observations of [——_] We will need to interview her to confirm the accuracy of
‘those facts. On'a second count, we could rely on the incident where Mr, Epstein’s private investigators

followed [Jfather, forcing him off the:road. Or, if thereis something. more recent related fo any C_]

ive could consider that.

ope that helps.
