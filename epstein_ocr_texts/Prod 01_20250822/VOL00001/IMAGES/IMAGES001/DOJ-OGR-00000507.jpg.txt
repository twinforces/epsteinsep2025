ubject: Draft Agreements?
Hi Jay - I was hoping there would be things for me to read this moming, but I will try to remain patient.
I believe there are only two types of agreements that would apply to this case: (1) a plea agreement to a federal
charge or charges; and (2) a non-prosecution agreement (which is really a deferred prosecution agreement
because the defendant agrees that if he violates the agreement, the U.S. can prosecute him).
A plea agreement is part of the court file. It is not accessible on-line via PACER, but someone can go to the
Clerk’s Office to obtain a copy.
A non-prosecution agreement would not be made public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part of our
case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA request, but it is not something that we would distribute
without compulsory process.
On the obstruction charges, many of the facts I included in that first proffer were hypothesized based upon our |
discussions and the agents’ observations of EE: = We will need to interview her to confirm the accuracy of |
those facts. On a second count, we could rely on the incident where Mr, Epstein’s private investigators
followed MMM father, forcing him off the road. Or, if there is something more recent related to any J
a could consider that.
@. that helps.
