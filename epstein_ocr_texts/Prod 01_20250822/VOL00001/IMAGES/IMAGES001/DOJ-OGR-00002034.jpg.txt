In 2017 | lived with Ghislaine and her familv for a few weeks. helping move them into their house. Ke

It is very obvious that they love her
deeply. They are an incredibly strong and close family unit.
Ghislaine has lived in the United States since the beginning of the 1990s and has had to deal with
fluctuating amounts of press interest in her life. This was notwithstanding her huge and understandable
mistrust of the media which started with the fall-out from the sudden death of her Father and has
continued to this day. Despite the tremendous ramping of press interest in her following the death of
Jeffrey Epstein in August 2019 Ghislaine remained living in the States. This was primarily so that she could
be with her family but also to ensure she was available to deal with any civil or even criminal allegations
arising from her past connection to Epstein should these arise. When the press intrusion became too
intense, she removed herself from the family home to protect her Spouse i Any reports to
the effect Ghislaine took that decision to evade law enforcement are as far from the truth as they are
offensive.
My husband and | experienced first-hand what it felt like to be on the receiving end of such relentless press
intrusion in our own lives in the UK. We had to leave our home for a week because the press presence was
SO aggressive and so constant: we had phone calls, emails, letters, visits - and everyone in our village was
spoken to. Even my parents and children were harassed. JG hislaine’s house in
London and today still there are journalists knocking on the door and filming the house. Ghislaine was
terrified of being found by the press, or by deranged individuals and conspiracy theorists who threatened
to harm her. A UK newspaper (The Sun) put up a bounty for information leading to her discovery. She had
to isolate herself to protect her family and friends as much as herself. | spent a couple of days and nights
with her in October 2019 — we went for a walk and | directly experienced for myself the pressure and fear
she was living under. Any car or person that went by the house, or any unusual sounds she heard when we
were in the house, she thought the press or bounty hunters might have found her. She was genuinely
terrified for her safety and this ended up making me feel terrified too.
Ghislaine has always met problems head on and has never been afraid of the truth. | have personally
witnessed this at many points in her life when she has had to pick herself up and rise to the challenge in
front of her. Ghislaine has been a constant and very important part of my life a an: | have no
doubt — particularly if she is permitted properly to prepare her defence in a non-custodial environment
conducive to that end (the primary rationale for her renewed bail application) - that she will attend her
trial to fight these heinous charges and to clear her name.
Respectfully
