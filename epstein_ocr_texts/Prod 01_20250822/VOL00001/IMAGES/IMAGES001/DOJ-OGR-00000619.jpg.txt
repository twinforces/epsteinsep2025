a public interest in schéedultiing a fixéd trial daté in ‘this
case. Of course we understand if issues arise in the interim,
we will address that as it occurs, but we do think, it makes
sense at this juncture to set a firm trial date. We don't
think that. any délay in this casé is in the ptblia..,

MR. WEINBERG: We ‘think that ‘the delay in, bringing
this charge, your Honor, the natural corollary of that is to

make it more difficult, nét easier, f6r us to defend

Mr. Epstein, (For instance, there are certain sealed files ‘for
potential witnésses that we would have to go to other courts to
seek to unseal. There as an NPA to litigate. This case is not
your Ordinary 1591 case. A case 6f four to Six weeks. is not

the ordinary amount of time the government takes to prosecute,

whethér it. is old or new Gases, We need 13 months. I'm trying
to make a principled argument, Judge, that that would be a

ability to work with Mr. Epstein under the current conditions.

Thank you, Sir.

FHE COURT: Okay.

So, we are goang to mohitor the Gase from now until
then anyway, so LL think everybody will be in a, better posit:ion,
to. know what is realistic with respect to a trial date. I will
exclude time from today through, let*s say, June 8, but that,
of course, is without prejudice to hearing from the defense and
