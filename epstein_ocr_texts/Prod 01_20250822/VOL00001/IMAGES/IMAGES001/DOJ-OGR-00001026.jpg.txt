1 THE COURT: Mr. Cohen, any objection?

2 MR. COHEN: No, your Honor.

3 THE COURT: Okay. I will exclude time from today's

4 date until July 12, 2021, which I have said is a firm trial

5 date. I do find that the ends of justice served by excluding

7 defendant in a speedy trial. The time is necessary for the

8 production of discovery and view of that by defense, time for
9 the defense to consider and prepare any available motions and,
10 in the absence of resolution of the case, time for the parties
11 to prepare for trial.

12 To Ms. Moe and Mr. Cohen, although I have not set an
13 interim status conference in the case, we do have our motion
14 schedule, but for both sides, if at any point you wish to be
15 before the court for any reason, simoly put ina letter and we
16 will get something on the calendar as soon as we conceivably
17 can.

18 With that, Mr. Cohen, let me ask counsel if there is
19 any reason that we should not turn now to the argument for
20 bail?
al MR. COHEN: No, your Honor.
22 THE COURT: Ms. Moe?
23 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you.
24 THE COURT: All right. I will hear on that question.
25 It is the government's motion for detention, so I propose
