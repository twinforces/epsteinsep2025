defendant to be tried in a geographic location any more specific than the District where the 2
offense was allegedly committed,” United States v. Plaza-Andrades, 507 F. App’x 22, 26 (2d

Second, the prevalence of this practice as well as the compelling justification for it in this |
case add further support for its propriety. As the Government points out, “it is common for cases |
to be indicted by grand juries sitting in the White Plains courthouse and tried in the Manhattan
courthouse.” (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 4 (collecting cases).) And here, that practice was especially 2
justified in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which had all but brought grand juries and other in-
person proceedings to a grinding halt during the summer of 2020. See supra 2-3. Thus, in |
considering this compelling justification, the Court is unpersuaded by Schulte’s allegations that }
