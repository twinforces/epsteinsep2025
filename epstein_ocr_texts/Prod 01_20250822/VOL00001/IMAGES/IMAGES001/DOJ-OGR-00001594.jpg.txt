The government bears a dual burden in'seeking pre-trial. detention. First, the government
must show “by a:preponderance. of the. evidence that;the defendant . . . ‘presents an actual risk of
flight”? Sabhnani, 493 F.3d.at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this
burden, it must then “demonstrate by a. preponderance of the evidence that no condition, or
combination of conditions could be imposed on the defendant that would reasonably assure his
presence. in court.” Jd.

In determining whether there: are conditions of release that. will. reasonably assure: the
appearaiice of the defendaiit, the court must Ccofisider (1) the nature and circumstances of the
offense charged; (2) the weight of the-evidence against the person; (3) the history and
characteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and seriousness of the danger to any. person or.
the.community that would be posed by the person’s release. 18 U:S:C..§ 3142(g).

In this case, unlike in:the ‘Epstein, case, the government does not contend that Ms.
Maxwell poses any danger to the community, and therefore the fourth factor does not apply.

The Bail Reform Act:contains.a trebuttable:presumption, applicable based on certain.of
the crimes charged here, that no conditions will reasonably assure against flight: See.18 U.S.C. 8
3142(€)(3)(E). In cases where this présumption applies, the “defendant bears a limited, burden of
evidence’ that [she] does not:pose. . . a.risk of flight.” See Wnited. States, v., English, 629 F.3d
311, 3.19 (2d-Cir. 201.1) (quotation omitted). This:rebuttable presuinption can be-readily
satisfied, United States v: Conway, No, 4-1.1-70756 MAG (DMR), 2011 WL 3421321, at *2
(N-D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2011), and “[a]ny evidence ‘favorable’to a defendant'that: comes within, a
category listed in § 3:142(g) can affect the operation” of:the presumption. United States v.

Dominguez, 783 F.2d.702, 707 (7th Cir. 1986); see also United,States 'v. Maitis, No.20-1713,
