Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
20 Cr. 330 (AJIN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

I am writing this letter on behalf of Ghislaine Maxwell, a woman who I grew up knowing
aa we continue to be in touch today.

I do not write this to discuss the charges against Ghislaine Maxwell, to plead that she is
innocent or argue that she is guilty. I am simply hoping to offer a more well-rounded picture of
Ms. Maxwell as a person outside of the opinions of the media. As a kid, I saw Ghislaime as an
example of a strong, caring woman.

In addition, her passion for saving the oceans was
inspiring. At a very impressionable age, Ghislaine taught me a lot about generosity,
determination, and resilience.

Thank you for the opportunity to write this letter. I hope you will consider granting bail
to Ghislaine Maxwell. Given the seriousness of the situation, I would not have considered taking
action if I did not feel it necessary. Whatever the outcome, I felt it was important for me to share
my unique perspective and stand up for what I believe in.

Sincerely,
DOJ-OGR-00002156
