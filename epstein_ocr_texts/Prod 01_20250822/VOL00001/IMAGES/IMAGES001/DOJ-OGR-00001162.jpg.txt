to other countries. outside of the European, Union, including the United, States. As sct forth.in
Exhibit B, according to the MOJ, the French. Code of Criminal Procedure “absolutely prohibits the
extradition of-a. person who had French nationality: at the time of the commission of the: acts for
which extradition, is requested.” (Ex.'B at 3). That the defendant is a citizen of multiple countries
is ofino moment. (See id.). In applying the Bilateral Extradition. Treaty between ‘the, United States
and ‘France and the “gencral ‘principle of non-extradition of nationals ‘under French law, France
systematically refuses to grant the: cxtradition of French nationals to the Amcrican. judicial
authorities.” (id. at 4). Thus, contrary ‘to the suggestion of the defense submission, any:
anticipatory waiver of extradition would,not be effective under French, law, and would not be
recognizable by French. courts in. any. extradition process, or otherwise enforceable.

The defendant’s expert. writes that. “[i]n the: recent. past,” he'is “not aware that the French.
authoritics would have had. to address the situation. in which ‘the United, States sought extradition,
of a French citizen who was also a United States citizen. Thus,'there is no précedent'to draw from,
in that regard.” (Def. Ex.V, at 2). That.is not.so. France‘has previously:rejected such a request.
For'example, in'2006, Hans Peterson, ‘an.American citizen and French national, turned himself in
to French authorities :in Guadeloupe and. confessed to committing: a:murder.:in the United States.
Despite turning himself in.to French authorities, Peterson, remained. beyond the reach of U.S. law
enforcement despite the repeated requests of OIA. and. U.S. officials. See Durbin, Schakowsky,
