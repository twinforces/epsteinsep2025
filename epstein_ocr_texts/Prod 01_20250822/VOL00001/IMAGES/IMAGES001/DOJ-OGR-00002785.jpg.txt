Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document171 Filed 03/23/21 Page 5of18

The language of the extradition treaty: between the United States and France and the
applicable.French.statues are clear that anyone secking to contest extradition.on the basis of
French citizenship must’be a French national af the time of the extradition request. Ud. 9 11).
The:provisions on which the government:reliés were ‘not intended to apply in cases where the
person.whose extradition. is sought had lost. French citizenship. To the contrary, it was
designed to apply to'individuals who had.aeqguired’French citizenship subsequent to the.
‘commission of the alleged crime “in. order to. avoid :fraudulent:nationality applications. of
offenders sccking to escape extradition.” (Jd. 49 15-16). Ifthe person, is no longer a, French
national at the time of the request, the provision. docs not apply: The government cites no, case
where the relevant statute was applicd to protect.a formerly French national from. extradition,
and we’ have found none ourselves. (Ji. 4419-21). By contrast, there are numerous examples
of French courts deporting individuals who have lost French nationality following the:
commission of an.offense. :(/d. 421). Accordingly, Mr. Julié concludes: “[I]t cannot-have been
‘the intention of French lawmakers: that: Article 696-4 be construcd as meaning that'a person
‘who has lost French nationality would. still be entitled to be protceted from. extradition.” (/d.

{ 26).

Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to ‘give up both British and French citizenship and waive
any and.all right to contest extradition, is a formidable challenge to the assertion that Ms.
Maxwell would likely flee if released from.custody and gocs above: and beyond the
“reasonable asstirances” that the: Bail Reform, Act requires to grant’bail. While we
maintain that Ms. Maxwell’s written waivers of the right to challenge extradition should,
suffice, her' willingness to: forfeit citizenship: birthrights, exceeds what; is necessary and.
profoundly demonstrates her commitment to abide’ by conditions of release and appear at

trial.
