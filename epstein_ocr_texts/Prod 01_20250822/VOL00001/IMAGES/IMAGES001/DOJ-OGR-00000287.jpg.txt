the alleged conduct.at.issue here do not apply retroactively to Mr. Epstein’s case (including a,
maximum sentence of life imprisonment and a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years). Mr:
Epstein would, moreover, be subject to prosecution if he fled, which. he now knows carries a:
maximum penalty of'up-to 10 additional ycars of imprisonment, 18 U.S.C. § 3. 146(b)(I)(A)(),
and/or the real risk of.an enhanecd sentence by the Court in.this matter if not. acquitted.

It:must further’be emphasized that the allegations outlined within,the indictment are just
that — allegations — and the defendant anticipates substantial factual and Icgal challenges to, the
government case. For.one thing, Epstcin has potent a defenses to prosceution u under 18,

along with various: other arguments, i in in full- blown dismissal motions.

Seetion 1591.'was:passed as:part ofthe. Trafficking Victims Protection.Act of 2000
(“TVPA”), Pub: L. No. 106-386, 114 Stat. 1464 (October.28, 2000). ‘In cnacting,the TVRA,
Congress recognized that human. trafficking, particularly: of women and children, in the sex
industry, “is.a,; modern ‘form of slavery, and. it:is the largest manifestation of slavery today.” 22
USC. §'7101(b)C1); see-also id. at § 7101(b)(2), (4). “The TVPA. criminalizes:and attempts to
prevent slavery, involuntary servitude, and human trafficking for commercial gain.” United
States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176, 1.1.79 (11th Cir. 2007). Importantly, “the entire language and
design of the statute asa whole indicates that: it is meant to:punish those:who are the providers or
pimps of children, not the purchasers or the johns.” Fierro y. Laylor, No. 11-CV8573, 2012 WL
13042630, at. *3 (S. DN.Y. July 2, 20.12) (quoting United: States v: , Bonestro0; No. 11-CR=4001.6,
2012 WL 13704, at *4 (D-S.D. Jan. 4, 2012)) (emphasis added). In Fierro, the district court
found § 1591 inapplicable to consumers or purchasers of'sex.acts. Here, the principal :conduct
undcrlying the indictment is Mr. Epstcin’s payment of:money for massages that purportedly
escalated-to alleged. scx.acts. Mr. Epstcin’s conduct, however, is akin to consumer or purchaser
behavior and ‘shouldbe outside the ambitof 18 U-S.C. § 1591, SeeFierro, 2012 WL 13042630,
at *4 (“[T]he TVPA is inapplicable to individual purchasers. of sex ‘from trafficking
vietims...”).'°

!°'While-/iero represents the law in this district, Mr. Epstein-notes that there is a division of
authority on the scope of § 1591. See United States v. Jungers, 702. F.3d. 1066, 1068 (8th Cir.
2013)., The defense respectfully submits that.the /iero court’s approach to this issue is more’
persuasive and. more consistent: with the Congressional purpose to'targcet.commercial. scx
trafficking.
