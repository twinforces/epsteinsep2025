principle is more decply imbedded in the common Jaw than, that, in an, action, to sct aside a lease
or. a contract, all. partics who may be affected. by the determination ‘of the action are:

remains a legally*viable possibility.°

The present proceedings under the CVRA must accordingly’be dismissed. for lack: of

(holding that, there was no standing where it was speculative that remedy that, Plaintiff sought.

Significantly, itis Epsfein's contractual rights ‘under the non-prosccution agreement ‘that.
Petitioners seck to‘void through these: proceedings.
