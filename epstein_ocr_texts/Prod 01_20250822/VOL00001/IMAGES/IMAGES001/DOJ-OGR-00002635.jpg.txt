appropriate; OPR. did not, however; alter its findings and. conclusions.

Finally, OPR. réviewed relevant case law, Statutes, regulations, Department policy, and
attorney. professional responsibility rules as:necessary to. resolve the issues presented in this case’
and to determine whether the subjects committed professional misconduct.

As part of its investigation, OPR.examined the interactions between state officials and the:
federal investigators and. prosecutors, but because OPR. does not have jurisdiction. over state
officials,, OPR did not investigate, OF. teach. conclusions about, their conduct regarding the state’
investigation.’ Because OPR’s, mission: is ‘to’ ensure that Department attorneys adhere to the
‘standards of professional conduct, :OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the -subject’
attorneys. rather than. on. determining the full scope of Epstein’s and his, assistants? criminal
behavior. Accordingly, OPR. considered the-evidence and information regarding Epstein’s and his:
assistafits’ conduct as. it was known to the subjects .at the time they performed their duties as.
Department attorneys. Additional evidence and information that came to light after June 30, 2008,
when Epstein entered his. guilty plea under'the NPA,-did not affect the:subjects’ actions prior to
that date, and OPR. did not. evaluate: the subjects’ conduct on the. basis of that’ subsequent
information.

OFR S investigation occurred apprevunately 12 years after most of the: Significant events
many cf the subjects and witnesses. were “unable fo recall the details of events, or: “their own or
others’ actions: ocourring in 2006-2008; such as ‘conversations, meetings, or documents they.
reviewed at the time,* However, OPR’s evaluation.of the subjects’ conduct was aided significantly
by extensive, ‘contemporaneous emiails among the prosecutors and communications between the
government; and defense ‘counsel. ‘These records. often referred to the interactions among the:
participants and described important, decisions-and, in some instances,. the bases for them.
