Dear Judge Berman, in making your decision to allow the Unites States of America’s
current sitting attorneys for the DOJ’s request to release these files, I ask you to have our
attorneys review the “suggested” redactions as they are the ones who also know the victims, their
names, their truths and their stories unlike the Unites States Government who did not and does
not even care to know our truth. They would rather ask a convicted imprisoned sex trafficker/
abuser for information.

In conclusion, I beg the court to make sure it is the upmost priority that in any sort of
release ALL and EVERY detail that could possibly reveal our identities be redacted. I also
request that you take your time in making your decision and consider allowing for the victims
attorney’s to review these files before a release is permitted.

Side Note: If other victims do not mind having their personal information redacted, my voice is not for them.
Sincerely and thank you for your time,
Xxx-victim/survivor
