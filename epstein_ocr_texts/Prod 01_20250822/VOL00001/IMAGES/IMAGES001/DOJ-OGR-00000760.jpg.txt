Dear Judge Beran, in making 'your' decision to allow’ the Unites. States of America’s
current. sitting attorneys for the DOJ’s request to ‘release these files, I ask ‘you to have our
attorneys'review the “suggested” redactions as they are’ the ones who also know the victims, their
names, their truths and their stories unlike the Unites States Government who did not.and does
not.even care to know our truth. They would rather.ask a. convicted. imprisoned sex trafficker/
abuser. for information.

In. conclusion, | beg thé-court to make sure itis the upmost priority: that:in any-Sort of
reléasé ALL and EVERY détail that could possibly reveal. our identities be redactéd. | also
request. that; you take‘your time ‘in making your, decision,and consider allowing ‘forthe victims
attorney’s to review these files before:a release is'permitted.

Side. Note: If other victims do not mind having their personal informationsredacted, my:voice. is not-for them.

Sincerely and thank, you ‘for your time,

Xxx-victim/survivor
