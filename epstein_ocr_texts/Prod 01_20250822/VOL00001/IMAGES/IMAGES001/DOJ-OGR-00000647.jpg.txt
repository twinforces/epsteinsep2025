1 This latter application of the rule of abatement

2 regarding forfeiture has not been universally accepted among

3 federal courts, but it certainly is the law in this circuit.

4 Some of you may be interested to know that some United States

iy courts, state courts, have criticized the rule of abatement,

6 particularly in the face of growing recognition of victims'

7 rights in the criminal justice system, including the Crime

8 Victims' Rights Act.

9 It has been written and contended in the Brooklyn Law
10 Review -- I can give you the cite later -- that when courts

11 abate criminal convictions, they reimpose a burden on victims
12 that legislatures intended to alleviate through these victim

13 rights statutes. The state Supreme Court has even concluded

14 that the expansion and codification of victims' rights provides
15 the changed conditions needed for overruling the rule of

16 abatement. It has also been stated that Alaska's statute and
17 its constitution now require the criminal justice system to

18 accommodate the rights of crime victims. Further, that the

19 abatement of criminal convictions has important implications
20 for these rights.
21 But coming back to our case, which is what you are
22 concerned about and I am as well, it is appropriate to conclude

24 as in the Wright case, it should also apply a fortiori in the
25 Epstein case, which was still in the pretrial phase when
