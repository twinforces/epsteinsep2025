Ex. K.at.88-89.

Ms. Maxwell was asked if she “was aware of the’presence” of “sex toys” or “devices”
many reasons: it was compound.and vague, contained numerous undefined. terms, and lacked
foundation. It.is entirely unclear how someone: may “be ‘aware: of the: presence” of* these,
apparently, spectral. objects. What exactly is a “device” used in. “sexual, activities?” Would bath.
Holding hands? The combination of toys, devices, and activitics may be endless. The examiner
did not limit-the question:to anytime period and apparently charged. Ms. Maxwell:with
discerning, her level of “awareness” to the past, present and, future. The true and predictable.

response:to Such a question was “No, not.that.I recall.”
