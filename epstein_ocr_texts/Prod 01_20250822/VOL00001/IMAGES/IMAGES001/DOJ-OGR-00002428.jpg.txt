Ex. K at 88-89.

Ms. Maxwell was asked if she “was aware of the presence” of “sex toys” or “devices”
used “in sexual activities” in Epstein’s Palm Beach house. The question was objected to for
many reasons: it was compound and vague, contained numerous undefined terms, and lacked
foundation. It is entirely unclear how someone may “be aware of the presence” of these,
apparently, spectral objects. What exactly is a “device” used in “sexual activities?” Would bath
oil, a tub, or a table qualify? What did the examiner mean by “sexual activities”? Kissing?
Holding hands? The combination of toys, devices, and activities may be endless. The examiner
did not limit the question to any time period and apparently charged Ms. Maxwell with
discerning her level of “awareness” to the past, present and future. The true and predictable
response to such a question was “No, not that I recall.”
