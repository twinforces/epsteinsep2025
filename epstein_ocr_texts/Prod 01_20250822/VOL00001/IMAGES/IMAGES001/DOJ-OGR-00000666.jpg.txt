MR. WEINBERG: Yés, your Honor.

I think, like when appeals are taken, bail issues
remain before the district cotirt. Uurisdicttion 1S not
completely divested, Your Honor issued a pretrial detention
order and yott® Honor has the power, the tinherént authority,
they are not going to refuse to allow you to go leok at the
ninth floor. They aré going to count on you to make decisions
in. the: future.

I juist trust ‘that the executive branch iS not going to
prevent the judicial branch from looking into the death of
Jeffrey Epstein or the conditions ih the SHU unit. at the MCC,

AG.

”

THE COURT: Gredt. Thank you.

MS. COMEY: May I, your Honor?

Just. very briefly, your Honor. I would note that upon
the dismissal of the indictment, which I believe the parties

agree, is appropriate in this Gasé, there would be no casé.

There would, be mo jurisdiction, for the count to conduct any
sort. 6f inguiry, even if the Gourt had such authority.
THE COURT: Right.

OK. I think we've heard enough.

It is at ‘this point. an the hearing that. IT would like
to ¢all upoh vittims' counsel, plural, for any remarks they may
have and they may wish to make. Also, to introduce their
clients, those of them who wish to be heard.
