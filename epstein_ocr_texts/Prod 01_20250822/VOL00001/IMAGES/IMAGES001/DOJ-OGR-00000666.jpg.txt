1 MR. WEINBERG: Yes, your Honor.
2 I think, like when appeals are taken, bail issues
3 remain before the district court. Jurisdiction is not
4 completely divested. Your Honor issued a pretrial detention
S order and your Honor has the power, the inherent authority,
6 they are not going to refuse to allow you to go look at the
7 ninth floor. They are going to count on you to make decisions
8 in the future.
9 I just trust that the executive branch is not going to
10 prevent the judicial branch from looking into the death of
11 Jeffrey Epstein or the conditions in the SHU unit at the MCC,
12 sir.
13 THE COURT: Great. Thank you.
14 MS. COMEY: May I, your Honor?
15 Just very briefly, your Honor. I would note that upon
16 the dismissal of the indictment, which I believe the parties
17 agree is appropriate in this case, there would be no case.
18 There would be no jurisdiction for the court to conduct any
19 sort of inguiry, even if the court had such authority.
20 THE COURT: Right.
21 OK. I think we've heard enough.
22 It is at this point in the hearing that I would like
23 to call upon victims' counsel, plural, for any remarks they may
24 have and they may wish to make. Also, to introduce their
25 clients, those of them who wish to be heard.
