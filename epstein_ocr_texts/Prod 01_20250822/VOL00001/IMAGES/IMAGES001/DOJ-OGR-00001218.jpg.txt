18 U.S.C. § 3142(g).

At the July 14, 2020 bail hearing, the Court considered these factors before concluding
that no conditions of release could reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required.
And the first and fourth factors remain unchanged. As already noted, the Defendant is charged
with offenses involving minor victims, and it is undisputed that the nature and circumstances of
the offenses charged in the Superseding Indictment weighs in favor of continued detention. On
the other hand, the Government has not advanced any evidence that the Defendant poses a
danger to any person or to the community, a factor that weighs against detention. The
Defendant’s arguments therefore focus on the second and third factors.

As explained below, neither the arguments put forth in the Defendant’s renewed motion
for bail nor the evidence she submitted in conjunction with her motion rebut the Court’s
conclusions, and the Court continues to find, after again applying these factors, that no
conditions of release will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance at future proceedings.

1. The Weight of the Evidence

The Court will address the strength of the Government’s case first. The Defendant
argues that the Government lacks any meaningful documentary corroboration of the witness
testimony and that the discovery produced to date has included only a “small number of
documents from the time period of the conspiracy.” Def. Mot. at 5. And she claims, as a result,
that the Government overstated the strength of its case in advance of the July 14, 2020 bail
hearing. See id. at30 33. So she argues that the second § 3142(g) factor supports release.

The Court disagrees. Arguing that the case against her “is based almost exclusively on
the recollections of the three accusers, who remain unidentified,” the Defendant contends that the
