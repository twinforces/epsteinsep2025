involved defendants with first-hand knowledge of
negotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an
oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly increases the
potential for disputes such as ...a failure to agree on
the existence, let alone the terms, of the deal.” United
States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 90 (2d Cir. 2002). Thus,
an evidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine
the terms of an agreement never committed to writing.
This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond
the NPA itself, an extensive OPR report details its
negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that
prosecutors promised Epstein anything beyond what
was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the
Government that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests
on mere conjecture.

For the same reason, the Court will not order the
discovery on the NPA. In any case, it appears that
the Government has already produced two of the
documents Maxwell seeks in her motion—the OPR
report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of
course, the Government’s disclosure obligations would
require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evi-
dence or evidence material to preparing the defense,
including any evidence supporting a defense under the
NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within
one week whether it views any evidence supporting
Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is
required to disclose, and, if so, whether it has disclosed
any and all such evidence in its possession.
