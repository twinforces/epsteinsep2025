before. being provided to, the inmate. récipient.. Due. to the large. number of MDC inmates and the
volume of ‘mail received. at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted..above,
however, the defendant jis able to send and reecive emails with. defense counsel everyday: and:has
regular communication with, counsel via. VTC.

MDC staff conduct two. :pat-down.scarches of the defendant per day: ‘once,'when. she is
moved from-her isolation cell.to the day room cach morning, and onee when returns from the day:
roomrto her isolation ccll cach night. AS part ofthose searches, the defendant is required.to remove
her mask,and open, her ‘mouth, bricfly so that MDC staff, who:remain:masked during the searches,
can confirm she has not;hidden contraband inher mouth. ‘These pat-down and:mouth searches are
consistent with MDC"s policy that all inmates be searched, whenever they move to a different
location within the jail facility. Previously, the defendant attended VTC conferences in:a.scparate
part.of the MDC, requiring, that. she be ‘searched. when. taken. to and from her VTC calls with.
counsel. Recently, however, the MDC changed the location of the defendant’s VTC calls ’so that.
the defendant.does not.need to leave her unit:in order to.attend VTC calls with her counsel, thereby
reducing the number of.scarches. During’the suspension of visitation, the defendant. has riot been
Strip, searched. When, Visitation. resumes, the defendant, like all other inmates, ‘will be strip
searched. after any in-person visit.

In.addition, MDC-staff search the defendant’s cell for contraband once, per day. MDC staff
also conduct: a ‘body scan. on the defendant. once per: week: to check for. any: secreted contraband.
At night, MDG staff are required ‘to, confirm that the defendant. is not, in distress. every fiftecn
minutes. To do:so,, staff point.a ‘flashlight to the cciling of the defendant’s cell to illuminate the:
cell. sufficiently to confirm that the defendant :is breathing every fifteen. minutes. The: MDC
continues. to assess that. these searches are all necessary for the safety of the institution and the
defendant..

Should the Court have. any questions or require any additional. details regarding this topic,
the Government will:promptly provide: additional information.

Respectfully submitted,

United States Attorney
