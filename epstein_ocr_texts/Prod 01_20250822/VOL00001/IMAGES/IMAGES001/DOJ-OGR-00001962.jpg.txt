1 significant argument by the defense and it is a relevant

2 consideration, but the court does not give it controlling

3 weight here.

4 To begin, in spite of the Epstein prosecution,

5 Ms. Maxwell herself may have expected to avoid prosecution.

6 After all, she was not named in the original indictment. The

7 case was therefore distinguishable from United States v.

8 Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1988), a case where release was
9 ordered in part because the defendant took no steps to flee

10 after a search warrant was executed against the defendant and
11 he had been arrested on state charges several weeks earlier.

12 Likewise, the mere fact that she stayed in contact

13 with the government means little if that was an effort to stave
14 off indictment and she did not provide the government with her
15 whereabouts. Circumstances of her arrest, as discussed, may

16 cast some doubt on the claim that she was not hiding from the
17 government, a claim that she makes throughout the papers and

18 here today, but even if true, the reality that Ms. Maxwell may
19 face such serious charges herself may not have set in until
20 after she was actually indicted.
21 Moreover, Ms. Maxwell's argument rests on a
22 speculative premise that prior to indictment Ms. Maxwell had as
23 clear an understanding as she does now of the serious nature of
24 the charges, the potential sentence she may face, and the
25 strength of the government's case. Whatever calculation and
