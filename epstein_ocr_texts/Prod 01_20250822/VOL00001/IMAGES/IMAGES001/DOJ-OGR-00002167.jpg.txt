Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 100 Filed 12/18/20 Page 6 of 36

On July 2, 2020, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) arrested the defendant.
Following extensive briefing, on July 14, 2020, the Court held a lengthy bail hearing. In its written
and oral submissions, the defense urged the Court to release the defendant on bail.

Among other things, the defense emphasized the defendant’s family ties and residence in
the United States (Dkt. 18 at 2, 3, 12), offered to hire a private security company to monitor the
defendant (/d. at 20), noted that the defendant remained in the country and was in touch with the
Government through counsel following Epstein’s arrest (Dkt. 18 at 12-13; Tr. 49, 52-55), argued
that the defendant went into hiding to avoid a media frenzy (Dkt. 18 at 14-16; Tr. 55-56), and
argued that detention would hamper the ability to prepare a defense (Tr. 42, 67-69). Responding
to the Government’s concerns about the lack of transparency about the defendant’s finances and
six proposed co-signers, the defense specifically asked the Court to keep the proceedings open if
the Court believed additional information or a more fulsome bond would be useful to the bail
determination. (Tr. 52 (“And if the court determines that the conditions that we have proffered are
insufficient or need further verification, as long as we can have some assurance of safety and
confidentiality, we would recommend that the court keep the proceeding open, and we should be
able to get whatever the court needs to satisfy it.”); Tr. 59 (“Even if the court were to assume for
purposes of today’s proceeding that she has the means that the government claims she does, it does
not affect the analysis. That is to be addressed in conditions, to be addressed if the court requires
it, through verifications and further proceedings before the court.”); Tr. 66 (“If the court desires to
leave the proceeding open for a week and allow us to come back, if the court has concerns about
the number of suretors, for example, verification information, information about financial issues,
we think that, now that we have some ability to breathe a little bit, that we should be able to pull
this together for the court’s consideration.”); Tr. 70 (“And if the court needs more information
