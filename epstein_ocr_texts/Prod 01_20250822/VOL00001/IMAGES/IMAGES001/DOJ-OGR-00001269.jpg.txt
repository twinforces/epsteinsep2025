WILLIAM JULIE
AVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW
Criminal Procedure use the present tense (“a person who is a national of the Requested
State’”/’the person claimed Aas French nationality”), which can only mean that the
extradition of a person is denied when that person is in fact a French national. If the
person is no longer a French national at the time of the request, the provision does not
apply.

12. Had these provisions been intended to apply in cases where the person has lost French
nationality subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime, the texts would have
expressly stated so or would at least have used both the present and the past tense to
qualify the national affiliation of the requested person.

13. Furthermore, it is a well-known principle of legal interpretation across all jurisdictions
that exceptions to rules must be construed strictly. The nationality ban being an
exception to extradition, it must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and its application
to a person who is no longer a French national must be rejected.

14. Second, the Ministry’s interpretation goes against the spirit of the law

15. The literal reading of Article 3 of the Treaty and Article 696-4 of the French Code of
Criminal Procedure is further supported by the fact that these provisions were in fact
not intended to apply in cases where the person sought has lost French citizenship, but
only in cases where that person has acquired French citizenship subsequent to the
commission of the alleged crime.

16. In other words, the rule that “nationality shall be assessed at the time of the offence for
which extradition is requested” seeks to deny the extension of the benefit of French
nationality to persons who have acquired French nationality after committing an
offence, in order to avoid fraudulent nationality applications of offenders seeking to
escape extradition.
