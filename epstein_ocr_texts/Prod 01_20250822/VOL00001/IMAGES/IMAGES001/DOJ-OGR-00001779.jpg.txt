Re: United States-v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully: submits this letter to request that the Court ‘grant the
Government permission, to.dclay disclosure to the defense of certain photographs of and documents
regarding victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. These materials, relate to abuse that ‘post-
dated the time:period charged in.the Indictment, and the Government:does ‘not intend to, offer them.
at trial. Although the Government intends to produce these materials tothe. defendant in. advance
of trial, premature: disclosure: of these: materials could jeopardize the: Government’s ongoing:
investigation and‘would reveal sensitive victim, information months in advance of trial. For these
reasons and as sct, forth below, the Government respectfully:submits, pursuant to Federal Rule of
Criminal, Procedure 16(d)(1); that good cause cxists to delay. disclosure of these, items to defense
counsel until cight weeks prior ‘to ‘trial.' The Government has conferred with. deferise counsel,
who.have indicated that they object.to this:request and intend to submit a Ictter in opposition.

As the Court is aware, the superseding ‘indictment, in this case (the “Indictment”) charges

the defendant in six counts.. Count One of the Indictment charges Maxwell, with, conspiring with,
Epstcin.and others'to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U-S.C.

! Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 provides for the production. of discovery to.a.defendant,

upon request, of certain materials, such as documents that arc material, to the ‘preparation, of the:
defense and;documents the Government intends:to use in its. case-in-chicf.at-trial. However, Rule
16(d)() also provides that:

At any time the court may, for good :causc, deny, ‘restrict, or defer.
discovery’ or inspection, or grant other appropriate: relicf. The: court
may permit a, party. to’show: good cause by:a. written statement that
the, court ‘will, inspect ex ‘parte.

A finding of good cause. ““*must be based on a particular factual. demonstration of potential harm,

not on-conclusory statements.” United States v. Gangi, No. 97 Cr. 1215 (DC), 1998’ WL: 226196,
at *2 (S.D.N.Y.. May 4, 1998) (quoting Anderson. v. Grvovae, Ing, 805'F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1986)).
