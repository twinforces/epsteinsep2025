1. In accordance with our engagement of 10 August 2020, we have prepared a summary
of the financial condition of Ghislaine Maxwell based on the following information
(i) Copies of her US tax returns filed in the years 2015 to 2020'

(ii) | Documentation provided by Ghislaine Maxwell’s office and her spouse
including bank statements and financial correspondence relating to bank
accounts, pension fund, and investments”

(111) Documentation provided by the United States Attorney’s Office for the
Southern District of New York under disclosure in the criminal proceedings*

2. We have assisted in the preparation of this statement of financial condition in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)* on behalf of
your client Ghislaine Maxwell.

3. The information supplied by Ghislaine Maxwell’s office and by her spouse is
incomplete due to the limited ability to access historic banking information from
some banks that have terminated their relationship either with Ghislaine Maxwell
and/or her spouse. However, we are satisfied from the review we have carried out
that the absence of some contemporaneous documentary evidence does not invalidate
or cast doubt on the conclusions we have reached nor on the overall reliability of the
financial information as presented in the summary of the financial condition of
Ghislaine Maxwell.

4. We are not able to perform a full audit of the statement of financial condition, nor
have we performed any audit type procedures, due to the current circumstances
relating both to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and the conditions of the
detention of Ghislaine Maxwell.

5. Accordingly, our opinion is reliant on the information provided to us, which is
outlined in paragraph 1(i)-1(i11) above.
