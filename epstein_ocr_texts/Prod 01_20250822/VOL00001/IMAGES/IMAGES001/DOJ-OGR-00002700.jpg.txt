Indictment does not-sufficiently.inform her of the-nature of the charges against her. Courts One
through Four of the indictment make vague and unspecified allegations that Ms. Maxwell.
purportedly enticed. and catsed unidentified individuals to travel, to engage in illegal sex acts
over a four-year period. But they-provide no specifics about when these events supposedly took
place or what-constituted:the alleged illegal sex acts. Indeed, it is now almost seven months
since Ms. Maxwell was. arrésted andthe government.sti// has not even disclosed the identities, of
the three accusers that :form the core of the government’s case against her in Counts One through
Four. Nor has the government: alleged why:Ms. Maxwell’s supposedly'perjurious responses to
the:deposition questions set forth:in Counts Five aiid.Six were material to the defamation
proceeding in which they arose. Ms. Maxwell. cannot hope to investigate these allegations and.
adequately prepare for trial'‘with such limited information. A. bill of‘particulars:is therefore
warranted.

Rule'7(f) permits a, defendant to seek a. bill of particulars “in order, fo identify with
sufficient particularity*the nature, ofthe, charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant.
