The Protective Order in this case
The Protective Order in this case prohibits the use of the discovery materials or confidential-
designated materials “for any civil proceeding or any purpose other than the defense of this
action” absent mutual agreement in writing between the government and defense counsel or if
“modified by further order of the Court.” Doc. # 36 at J 1(a), 10(a), 18. Ms. Maxwell agreed to
that limitation after assurances by the government, consistent with their representation to this
Court, that “the Government rarely provides any third party, including a witness, with any

should not be limited in their use of materials gained from the government in any related civil
litigation. Memorandum Op’n & Order at 3 (July 30, 2020). Yet as described above, the

that the government may raise concerning their on-going grand jury investigation will be
obviated by submission of these materials under seal in the other matters.
