Re: United States v.: Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN).

Dear Judge Nathan:

We write:on behalf of our client, Ghislaine: Maxwell, to'respectfully request that the ‘Court
order thé Bureau, of Prisons'to give Ms. Maxwell accéss, to the laptop computer-provided by the
government so that: she can review discovery on weekends and. holidays.

At the request of defense counsel, the government provided:Ms. Maxwell with a.laptop:
computer to. review the’voluminous, discovery, which was produced on_a series of external hard
drives. Currently, Ms. Maxwell is given access. to the laptop only.on weekdays. ‘On'weckends.
and holidays, Ms. Maxwell must use the. prison computer on her floor 16 review discovery.
However, the prison. computer isnot equipped with thesofiware:necessary to read large portions
‘of the discovery recently produced. by the government. As a result, Ms. Maxwell. loses several.
days of review‘time every'weekend and every holiday: because she does not: have access to the
laptop:. IfMs. Maxwell is to have any: hope. of reviewing the millions of documents produced in
discovery: so that she can properly prepare her defense by the July 12, 2021 trial.date, she must
have access to the laptop. every day, including: weckends. and holidays.

Defense counsel ‘has:raised this issuc’with the government and. it‘has ‘no objection to’Ms.
Maxwell having’ access to ‘the laptop seven. days.a week. At the request.of defense, counsel, the
government'has contacted officials at the MDC. on several occasions in.the:past few weeks to
request that they lift this restriction, but-without success.

There is no principled. justification for this ‘restriction. Ms. Maxwell was given access to
the laptop every day (including weekends and the: Thanksgiving holiday) ‘for the entire, 14-day
period that: she was. quarantined in her isolation ccll in November-December 2020 because she. had.
come into Close Contact: with a:member ofthe MDC staff who had tested positive for COVID. In.
addition, the laptop is kept in.a locker ‘in:the same room where the prison computer is located, so it
