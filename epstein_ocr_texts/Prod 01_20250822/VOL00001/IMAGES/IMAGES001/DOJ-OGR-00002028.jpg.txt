I have known Ghislaine a all her life.
Ghislaine and I have always enjoyed
sharing the personal experience of our lives with each other. she was
full of 'vim and vigor' and always just lovely to be with. she and I have seen our
relationship strengthen through shared common interests. In particular, Ghislaine's passion
for making a positive difference in the world, notably through her creation of the non-profit
TerraMar Project focusing on the protection of the worldâ€™s oceans, gave n
NIE 8110020 alvaysin uch wonneuhed
and met up much more consistently over the past seven years
It is ajoy to
be one of her best friends.
