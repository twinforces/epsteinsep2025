Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
On December 16, 2020, the Government filed its opposition to Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell’s renewed application for bail. In accordance with this Court’s December 7, 2020
Order, see Dkt. No. 89, the Government filed its materials under seal and proposed narrowly

materials; and (111) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at

enforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Jd.
at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo IT’), 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995)).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Government’s
submissions are “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial
process,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the
