ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

On December 16, 2020, the: Government.filed.its opposition to Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell’s ‘renewed application, for bail. .In accordance with; this Court’s December 7, 2020
Order, See-Dkt. No. 89, the Government filed its, materials under seal and proposed narrowly
tailored redactions on those materials. The‘Defendant did not file any opposition:to the
Government’s ‘proposed redactions.

The Court will adopt the Government’s proposed redactions after applying the:three-part
test-articulated. by the Second Circuit in. Lugosch v. Pyramid Co..of Onondaga, 435 F.3d.1.10 (24.
Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (1) determine’ whether the documents ‘in question are:
“judicial documents;”:(ii) assess the:weight of the common. law presumption of access to the
materials; .and (i11) balance: competing considcrations ‘against-the'presumption, of ‘access. /d.'at
119-20. “Such. countervailing factors include. but are not limited to ‘the danger of impairing law
enforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the:privacy interests ‘of those resisting disclosure.’” Jd.
at 120. (quoting United States v.. Amodéo (“Amodeéo. IP’), 71 F.3d 1044, 1050.(2d Cir. 1995)).

The proposed. redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Government’s
submissions are “relevant. to the performance of the judicial function.and useful in the judicial

‘process,” thereby qualifying as.a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the
