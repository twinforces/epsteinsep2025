Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 142 Filed 02/04/21 Page 20 of 38

A. Ms. Maxwell Has. Standing to Enforce the NPA.

The Second Circuit has long recognized that: plea agreements may include. promises: of,
leniency for third parties. See, e:g., United States v. Clements, 992. F.2d.417, 419 (2d Cir. 1993)
(“it is now clearly established inthe Second, Circuit that:the government may impose conditions
which relate'to the coriduct.or tréatinient-of others”); United States v. Margiiez, 909. F.2d,738, 742
(2d Cir, 1990) (“Since:a defendant’s plea is not rendered ‘involuntary because he enters it to save
himself'many years, in prison, it is, difficult'to see why the: law should not permit the defendant to
negotiate a plea that confers. a similar benefit on. others.”), cert. denied, 498 U.S. ‘1084 (1991).
Yet the government.has taken;the position that such promises are effectively unenforceable by
any third party who is not specifically identified by name.

Fundamental principles of contract law:contradict the government’s position, regardless
of whether the Court applics the law of New York or that of Florida, where the NPA was
negotiated and performed. Both states’ laws permit enforcement of a contract by'a third-party
beneficiary where the parties to the contract.intended-to confer a benefit on. the third party,
Subaru.Distribs. Corp: v. Subaru of Ams, Ine., 425 F.3d.119, 124 (2d Cir. 2005) (applying New
York: law); Bochese v. Town.of Ponce Inlet, 405 F.3d.964, 982 (11th Cir. 2005) (applying Florida
law). Morcover,.“[a]n intention to benefit a third-party: may. be gleaned. from.the. contract as a
whole dad. the party need not be:‘nameéd speécifically.as'a beneficiary.” Chen.St. v. Street Beat
Sportswear, Inc.,226 FE. Supp. 24.355, 362 (E.D:N.¥.. 2002) (emphasis added) (holding that
garment workers had-standing as third-party beneficiarics to enforce wage compliance agreement
between Department of Labor and. clothing-manufacturér‘that contracted with. their employer);
Florida Power & Light Co, y. Mid-Valley, Inc., 763 F.2d 1316, 1321 (Ath Cir, 1985) (“Florida

courts have long recognized that a 'third’party beneficiary: need not: be named.in the contract’).
