conspirators.” Lourie did not recall why the USAO
agreed to it, but he speculated that he left that
provision in the NPA because he believed at the time
that it benefited the government in some way. In
particular, Lourie conjectured that the promise not to
prosecute “any potential co-conspirators” protected
victims who had recruited others and thus potentially
were co-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Lourie also
told OPR, “I bet the answer was that we weren’t going
to charge” Epstein’s accomplices, because Acosta
“didn’t really want to charge Epstein” in federal court.
Sloman similarly said that he had the impression that
the non-prosecution provision was meant to protect
named co-conspirators who were also victims, “in a
sense,” of Epstein’s conduct. Although later press
coverage of the Epstein case focused on Epstein’s
connection to prominent figures and suggested that
the non-prosecution provision protected these individuals,
Sloman told OPR that it never occurred to him that
the reference to potential co-conspirators was directed
toward any of the high-profile individuals who were at
the time or subsequently linked with Epstein.!%
Acosta did not recall the provision or any discussions
about it. He speculated that if he read the non-
prosecution provision, he likely assumed that Villafatia
and Lourie had “thought this through” and “addressed
it for a reason.” The West Palm Beach manager, who
had only limited involvement at this stage, told OPR
that the provision was “highly unusual,” and he had
“no clue” why the USAO agreed to it.

Villafafia told OPR that, apart from the women
named in the NPA, the investigation had not developed

5 Sloman also pointed out that the NPA was not a “global
resolution” and other co-conspirators could have been prosecuted
“by any other [U.S. Attorney’s] office in the country.”
