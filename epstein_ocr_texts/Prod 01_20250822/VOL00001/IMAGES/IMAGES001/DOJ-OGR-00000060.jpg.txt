OPR report, precludes application of Annabi in this
case because the intent to bind the United States as a
whole, and not just the Southern District of Florida, is
clear.

Third, the Second Circuit misplaced its reliance on
a selective reading of the Judiciary Act of 1789 and the
United States Attorneys’ Manual to conclude that
United States Attorneys are “cabined to their specific
district unless otherwise directed.” 118 F.4th at 265.
Yet the Second Circuit ignored the Manual’s admoni-
tion that United States Attorneys who do not wish to
bind other districts should explicitly limit the scope of
a non-prosecution agreement to their districts. U.S.
Dept. of Justice, Justice Manual (updated Feb. 2018),

ral-prosecution. The existence of this provision reveals
that AUSAs can bind other districts and that it is the
obligation of the government to make explicit any
limitation in the scope of immunity, and not the other
way around.

Fourth, the recitals of the NPA reveal that the
intent was for a broad, complete resolution of the
matters addressed by the agreement. The NPA states
that “Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and
federal criminal liability.” (App.25). It also states that
“the interests of the United States, the State of Florida,
and the Defendant will be served” by the agreement.
(App.25-26, emphasis added). The recitals do not refer
to the specific interests of the Southern District of
Florida at all.
