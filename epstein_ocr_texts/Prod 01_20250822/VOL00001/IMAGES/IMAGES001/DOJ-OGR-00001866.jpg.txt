Re: United States ¥. Ghislatie Maxwell
20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

As counsel for Ghislaine: Maxwell, ‘we write in. response to the letter ‘from Sophia
Papapetru and John Wallace, MDC staff attorneys. (See Dkt. 88.) The letter ‘fails: to address.a.
number. of concerns raised in. our October 29" letter to Warden Heriberto Tellez and raised. with.
the Court. The MDC’s letter also contains inaccuracies and. omissions and raises more questions
‘than. it attempts to ‘answer: Rather than ‘paraphrase our letter, we are: providing it for the,’Court’s.
consideration. (See Exhibit A.) We rénew’ our request that, Warden. Telléez respond. directly to
the Court and, counsel and. explain. why Ms. Maxwell must be detained ‘under such harsh and
restrictive conditions.

Using the term “[i]n her current assignment,” ‘the letter attempts to presenta, picture of,
complianee with, total, disregard of the deficiencies of Ms..Maxwell’s, treatment up to this point.
While her meals may currently be in. accordance with. BOP ‘policy, until September they were
not. While her weight may; currently’ be fairly consistent, she had. lost over 1:5 ‘pounds,, and. she. is:
‘sustaining ‘hair loss. It. took, approximately six ‘weeks following arrival to. the MDC ‘for ‘Ms.
Maxwell to be permitted personal calls on par’with other inmates; previously she ‘was. given. two:
calls per ‘month unless authorized. by' the warden. While generally’ permitted. to, be out of her
tsolation cell and confined:to the day room from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm ‘with one hour of recreation
time, general population inmates:are permitted to be: out-of their:cells until 9:30 pm.and given
more: extensive recreation time. While: flashlight checks may be performed during regular
rounds, Ms. Maxwell is subject to'such checks every, 15 minutes., Further, because Ms. Maxwell
‘1S kept i in isolation, she:in, not: permitted. to participate in activities accorded, inmates in general,
population, such. as programming (educational, Icisure and wellneéss),'movics, réligious services,
job assignment:

Touting that Ms. Maxwell.is not in contact with “a number of inmates who have tested
positive for COVID-19,” the MDC’s letter totally ignores that she was in contact with a. member
of her revolving security team ‘who, tested positive, ‘necessitating that Ms. Maxwell be.
quarantined ‘for 14 days. This ‘further diminished her ability to. prépate her defense and resulted :in.
cancelled legal visits. While the letter accurately states that one video teleconference (VTC) was:
