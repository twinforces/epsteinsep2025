1 have the discovery, the subfacial discovery, if you will, so

2 that we could make a comprehensive briefing along the lines of
3 the schedule for motions.

4 THE COURT: That's what I was going to suggest, if

a there is a time period when you could put it all together, as

6 it were, and there is a lot of flexibility. So I will leave

7 these dates, you know, for now.

8 With respect to the trial date, I could accommodate

9 either June or September of 2020. The issue is not so much as,
10 from my point of view, when you are all ready, but what part of
11 the calendar I block out. So is it realistic to block out time
12 in June?

13 MR. WEINBERG: I think it is -- I don't want to have
14 the court block out a six-week time and then come to the court
15 in March and say we need a continuance and risk a September

16 date.

17 THE COURT: Got it. Okay. So a September date, you
18 are saying, sounds like it certainly is realistic.

19 MR. WEINBERG: Thirteen months sounds like the amount
20 of time that we would ordinarily need to prepare a case of this
al magnitude and scope.
22 THE COURT: All right. That is fine for me.
23 Just while we are taking care of details, a speedy
24 trial issue or application? Why don't we extend it to
25 September of 2020?
