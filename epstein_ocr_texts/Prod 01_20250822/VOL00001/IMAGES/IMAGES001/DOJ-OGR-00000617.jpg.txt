have the discovery, the stibfacial discovery, if you will, so

that we could make a comprehensive briefing along the lines of

the schedule for mottions.

THE COURT: That's what I was going to suggest, if
there iS a tlimé period whén you could put it all together, as.
it were, and there is. a lot of flexibility. So L will .leave
these dates, you know, for now.

With respect to the trial date, I could accommodate
either Juné or September of 2020. The issue is n6t sé much as,
from my point of view, when you are all ready, but what pant of
the calendar I bl6ck Gut. So is it realistic to block out tame
in, June?

MR. WEINBERG: TI think it is == I don't want to Have.
the court ‘block out a six-week, time and, then come ‘to the court
in March and Say we nééed a Continuance and risk a September
date.

THE GOURT: Got it. Okay. So a September date, you
ane saying, sounds like it certainly is realistic.

MR. WEINBERG: Thirteen months sounds like tHe amount
ef time that, we would ordinarily need 'to ‘prepare a case of this
magnitude, and scope.

THE COURT: All right. That is fine for me.

Just while we are taking care of details, a speedy
trial issue or application? Why don't we extend it to
September of 202°0:?
