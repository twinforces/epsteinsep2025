United States v. King, 849 F.2d 485, 488 (11th Cir. 1988) (quoting United States v. Portes, 786 |
F.2d 765 (7th Cir. 1985)). The Court finds that the Government has shown by a preponderance
of the evidence that Mr. Epstein is a flight risk. |

afforded to each factor under section 3142(g) is within the ‘special province’ of the district |
court.” Paulino, 335 F. Supp. at 610. |

4, [Mr. Epstein’s] Unexplained assets !
