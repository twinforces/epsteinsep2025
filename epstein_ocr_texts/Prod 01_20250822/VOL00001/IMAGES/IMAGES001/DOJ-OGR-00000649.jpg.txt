It also does, nothing 'to prevent the government from
centinuing to explore the possibility of seeking civil
forfeiture of any asséts that were used to facilitate the
crimes charged in this indictment. Indeed, as has been stated
publicly, investigations imto thosé matters have been ongoing,
remain ongoing, and will continue following dismissal of the
Andiétment. here.

I would also Like to mote that, as the government has
previously mentioned, ‘this dismissal in no way lessens ‘the
government's resolve to stand up for the victims in this case,
béth those who have come forward and those whdé have yet toé do
so. We agree with your Honer's sentiment that those victims
should be, respected, and we appreciate your Ho6énor's recognitidn
of that.

One Housekeeping matter that I did want to reference

for your Honor. The jpretective order in this case requires

destructi6n or return of any and all discdévery material upon

conclusion, of ‘the case. We have been in communication with
defense céunsel,; who Have, confirmed that they have réturned all
physical copies that, they have of discovery that, the government
has produced to date, and they are in the process. of deléting

any copies that they may have made. So the panties are in,

compliance with the protective order.
Finally, I just wanted to say a word about the victims
in, this case; and particularly those who are here in court
