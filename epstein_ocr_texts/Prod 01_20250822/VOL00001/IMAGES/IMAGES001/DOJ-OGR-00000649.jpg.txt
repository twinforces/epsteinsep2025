1 It also does nothing to prevent the government from

2 continuing to explore the possibility of seeking civil

3 forfeiture of any assets that were used to facilitate the

4 crimes charged in this indictment. Indeed, as has been stated
a publicly, investigations into those matters have been ongoing,
6 remain ongoing, and will continue following dismissal of the

7 indictment here.

8 I would also like to note that, as the government has
9 previously mentioned, this dismissal in no way lessens the

10 government's resolve to stand up for the victims in this case,
11 both those who have come forward and those who have yet to do
12 so. We agree with your Honor's sentiment that those victims

13 should be respected, and we appreciate your Honor's recognition
14 of that.

15 One housekeeping matter that I did want to reference
16 for your Honor. The protective order in this case requires

17 destruction or return of any and all discovery material upon

18 conclusion of the case. We have been in communication with

19 defense counsel, who have confirmed that they have returned all
20 physical copies that they have of discovery that the government
21 has produced to date, and they are in the process of deleting
22 any copies that they may have made. So the parties are in
23 compliance with the protective order.
24 Finally, I just wanted to say a word about the victims
25 in this case, and particularly those who are here in court
