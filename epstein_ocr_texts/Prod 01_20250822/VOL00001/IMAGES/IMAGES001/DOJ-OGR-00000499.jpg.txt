incorporated here by reference. See Minnici, 128 F. App’x at 829-30 (“the alleged activities |
[we|re of an addictive sexual nature that cannot be suppressed simply by a restrictive set of bail |
conditions”); see also Millan, 4 F.3d at 1049 (“[T]he protection of the community can be assured :
only by continued detention.”).

The Court has carefully considered the issue of Defendant’s ability and motivation for |
fleeing U.S. jurisdiction. The Court finds that the Government has proven by a preponderance of |
the evidence that, among other things, the Defendant’s limited family ties to the United States, |
his residence in Paris, his extensive overseas travel, his significant wealth and his substantial |
resources (including private planes), and the potential 45 year term of imprisonment that may be |
imposed should there be a conviction in this case, provide incentive, motive and wherewithal to |
flee. Indeed, these factors render him a “classic” flight risk. See, e.g., United States v. Abdullahu, :
488 F.Supp.2d 433, 445 (D.N.J. 2007) (‘After reviewing the totality of the evidence, the Court !
has reached the inescapable conclusion that the government has proved by a preponderance of :
the evidence that no condition or combination of conditions exist that will reasonably assure the |
defendant’s appearance at trial. The defendant faces serious criminal charges... The defendant
faces a potential ten year prison sentence and involuntary deportation. The defendant does not :
have permanent and longstanding ties to this area, he has the means and incentive to flee and he
has family ties and a place to live in an overseas country that will not extradite him to the United
States.”). |

H. Defendant’s Proposed Bail Package

Having determined that Mr. Epstein is a flight risk (and also a danger to the community),
the Court next examines the Defendant’s proposed bail package. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(b)-(f)(2). .
