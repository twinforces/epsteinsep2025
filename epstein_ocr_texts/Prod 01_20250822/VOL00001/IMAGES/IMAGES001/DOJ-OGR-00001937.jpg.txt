you can't, off the top of ‘your héad, explain your financial
condition to them? You must be lying. That assertion. .is
absurd.
We have been. working since our client was detained,

with our client, trying to accéss, family members to put, as

best we could, a financial picture before the court to the
extent it is Frelevant ‘to this. application dnd only this
application, This bail proceeding should mot. turn. into some
mini investigation of our client's finances. The government
has had, ten years to investigate my client.

Let me address séme of the specific allégatidns in the
government's brief. They point to a sale of ‘property in 2016.
According to the government, the property was sold for $15
million. There is no secret. about that. Those records are out
there. THe government claims our client cleared $14 million
from that in 2016 and apparently has it all today, which would
probably take it the first New York real estate transaction to
that, effect. There has been liabilities. There has been.
expenses, Our Client has been through extensive, substantial
litigation, all oven this countny denying these claims. We
think the number is far 1léss than what the government. asserts:
But even taking that, number, it's a number ‘far lower than that
in, Khashoggi» far lower. than that in Dreier, far lower than in
many cases, and the impact of that, in the court's discretion,

should be addressed. by bail conditions.
