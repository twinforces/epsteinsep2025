IV. The Defendant Raises Legal Argiiments Not Relevant Here

Finally, the defendant raises certain legal arguments..he contends: hewill litigate. at the:
appropriate stage and which he further suggests mitigate in favor of bail. ‘None is meritorious, and.
certainly none:should. give the Court any:comfort, whatsoever that;the defendant would, if granted.
bail, refrain. from flecing'so he could attempt: to vindicate: himself'via. dubious legal strategies.
Nevertheless, the Government’will address the :defendant’s arguments bricfly in turn.

A. The‘Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Preclude: Prosecution

As an initial, matter; as the Court. itself ‘noted at the partics’ initial appearance’ carlier this
week, and.as the defendant appears to coneécde, the instant Indietment'charges conduct well beyond.
the Scope ofthe NPA - thattt 1S, alleged conduct that occurred here in New: York: and involving 2 New:
to 5 put this i issue ‘to ‘rest, ‘because even assuming "the defendant were ‘to mount a meritorious
challenge to the NPA, he would still have. to stand. trial on.\Count Two, of the Indictment and.
additional charges brought. based on New York conduct.

of New York or “anywhere clsc outside the ‘SDEL—are manifold. The language of the: NPA
overwhelmingly refers to the SDFL,.and. the core terms'and text of the agreement: are limited to
the SDFL. The prefatory’ language states: “THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander
Acosta, United States Attorney for the: Southern.District of Florida, prosccution in this. District for
these offenses shall be: deferred in. favor ‘of prosecution by the State of Florida.”’ The final.
paragraph, of the prefatory language also states, among other things, that.after fulfilling the terms
of the ‘agreement, “no prosecution, for the [sex abuse] offenses ‘sct out on pages | ‘and 2 of this
Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subjéct of the: joint, investigation by the
Federal. Bureau ‘of Investigation and the United States Attorneys Office, nor any offerises ‘that’
arose from:the Federal ‘Grand Jury investigation-will. be instituted in. this District.”

In. its terms. section, the NPA further states that Epstein’s signature “is not'to be: construed,
as an.admission of civil or criminal liability ora waiver of any jurisdictional or other défense” as
to any victim ‘whose. identity: Was not disclosed by SDEL to Epstein, as, provided. for in the NPA,
and. additionally ‘states. that neither Epstcin’s signature nor any :resulting waivers or civil.
settlements “are’to be construed as:admissions or evidence of civil -or criminal liability or a waiver
of any’ jurisdictional or other defense as. to any person.” These provisions, show’ the partics
contemplated. possible criminal prosecutions in other jurisdictions and/or based on. victims not:
initially :identified in.'the. Florida. investigations (whether in Florida or élsewherc). The final
substantive paragraph. of the NPA. states that “Epstein hereby. requests: that the. United States:
Attorney for the: Southern District of 1 Florida defer [. . .] ‘prosecution.”

Its well settled in.the Second Circuit-that “a plea agreement; in one U.S. Attorney’s office

does not, unless otherwise. stated, birid another.” Waited States ¥. Prisco, 391, F. App’x.920, 921
