retroactivity provision in the 2003 Amendment; it actually considered and rejected such a
provision, signaling its clear intent that the amendment not be retroactive. Accordingly, the
Landgraf analysis should end at step one, with a determination that the 2003 Amendment is not
retroactive and that Counts One through Four are therefore time-barred. However, even if the
analysis advances to step two, application of the 2003 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged
conduct would create impermissible retroactive effects in violation of Landgraf by expanding a
criminal statute of limitations.

A. Step One: Congress did not expressly prescribe retroactivity and rejected a

proposal to do so.

The first step of Landgraf asks whether Congress “expressly prescribed” the temporal
reach of the 2003 Amendment. Here, Congress “expressly prescribed” that the 2003
Amendment was to apply prospectively only. Not only does the text of the 2003 Amendment
omit any mention of retroactivity, but the legislative history makes it absolutely clear that
Congress considered and rejected a retroactivity provision. Because such unambiguous
congressional intent is sufficient to constitute an “express prescription” under the first step of
Landgraf that the amendment not be retroactive, there is no need to proceed to the second
Landgraf step.

“(Where the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 264
(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 837 (1990)). Here, the
legislative history leaves no doubt as to congressional intent. The House version of the bill,
which would have eliminated the statute of limitations entirely, included an express retroactivity
provision. Child Abduction Prevention Act, H.R. 1104, 108th Cong. § 202 (2003) (“The
amendments made by this section shall apply to the prosecution of any offense committed
before, on, or after the date of the enactment of this section.”). The Senate version contained no
