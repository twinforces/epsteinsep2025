retroactivity: provision.in the 2003 Amendment; it actually considered and rejected such a.
‘provision, signaling its clear intent that the amendment or be retroactive. Accordingly, the
Landgraf analysis should end.at step onc, with a determination that the 2003. Amendment is not
retroactive and that Counts One through Four are therefore time-barred. However, even ifthe
analysis advances to step two, application of the 2003 Amendment to Ms. Maxwell’s alleged
conduct:would.create impermissible retroactive effects in violation of Landgraf by-expanding a
criminal, statute of limitations.

A. Step One: Congress.did not expressly prescribe retroactivity and rejected.a

proposal.-to do so.

The ‘first step of Landgraf'asks whether, Congress “expressly prescribed” the temporal
teach of the 2003 Amendment. Here, Congress “expressly prescribed” that the 2003
Amendment was to apply prospectively only. Not only does the text of the: 2003 Amendment
omit any mention of retroactivity, but the legislative history. makes. it absolutely clear that
Congress considered. and rejected.a retroactivity:provision. Because such unambiguous
congressional intent is sufficient to constitute an, “express prescription” under the first-step of
Landgraf that the amendment nor be retroactive, there is:no need. to proceed. to the second
Landgraf step.

“[W]here the congressional intent is clear, it governs.” Landgraf, 5.11 °U:S. at:264
(quoting Kaiser Aluminum & Chem. Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 USS, 827, 837 (1990)). Here, the
legislative history: leaves ‘no doubt as to congressional intent. The House version of the bill,
which would have: eliminated the statute of limitations. cntirely,. included. an express retroactivity
provision. Child Abduction Prevention.Act, H.R. 1104, 108th.Cong, § 202.(2003) (“The
amendments made by this section shall apply to the:prosecution of any offense committed

before, on, or'after the date of the enactment of this section.”). The Senate version.contained no
