counsel, and when. visiting ‘is available depending on pandemic-related conditions, the defendant.
has access to legal visits. Duc to, the recently implemented. lockdown. at the MDG, visitation is not:
currently available, but MDC legal counsel is arranging for the defendant to reccive a VTE call
with, legal, counsel three hours per day every weekday, starting this Friday. Defense :counsel will,
also. be able to schedule, legal. calls, on. weekends as. néeded. Given. ‘those ‘facts, ‘the. déferise
argument essentially suggests that no:defendant:could prepare for trial'while housed atthe MDC—
a'patently. incorrect claim.

The defendant, :is able to review her discovery using hard drives provided by ‘the
Government, dises that defense counsel can scnd.-containing any copics of discovery’ ‘material
défense counsel chooses. within the confines of the protective: order, or hard copy documents
provided by defense counsel. The Government has taken multiple: steps. to address technical.
difficulties, the defendant;has encountered, when revicwing her‘hard drives. These steps:included,
modifying and reproducing productions, in. new formats, asking MDC IT staff to assist the
defendant.in viewing ‘her hard drives on the MDC computer, and.then purchasing and providing a.
laptop for the defendant’s exclusive 'use.!” Even when the defendant was temporarily ‘unable to
revicw some files from.some. hard drives, she was: always able to. review: other. portions of her

discovery.

'° The Government understands. from MDC legal counsel. that. the defendant. has access to the
laptop thirteen hours per day during weekdays and. has access to the MDG desktop computer
thirteen, hours per day.seven days perweck., The use of the laptop is limited:to weekdays because
the MDC. restricts the numberof employees who carry the key to ‘the secure location. where ‘the:
laptop is kept, and the employcées with that kcy do not work ‘regularly on. weekends. The MDC
previously accommodated an..cxecption to this rule while. the defendant. was in. quarantine and
arranged. for her'to use the laptop in-her isolation cell.on weekends because ‘otherwise she would.
not have had access to.a computer during weekends ‘while in quarantine. Now that: she is: out: of
quarantine, the defendant will have access ‘to the MDC: desktop computer on’ weekends.
