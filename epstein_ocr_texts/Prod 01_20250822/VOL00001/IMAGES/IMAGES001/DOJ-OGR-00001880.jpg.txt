1 THE COURT: Ms. Maxwell, are you able to hear me and

2 see me okay?

3 THE DEFENDANT: Yes, thank you.

4 THE COURT: And are you able to hear Mr. Cohen and

5 counsel for the United States as well?

6 THE DEFENDANT: Yes. Thank you.

7 THE COURT: All right. If at any point you have

8 difficulty with any of the technology, you can let someone

9 there know right away, let me know, and we will pause the

10 proceedings before going any further. Okay?

11 THE DEFENDANT: Thank you, Judge.

12 THE COURT: All right.

13 Just a minute while we check on the call-in line.

14 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

15 (Pause)

16 MS. MOE: Your Honor, apologies. We have also heard
17 from colleagues in the office that the line is full. We have,
18 however, been able to dial in the executive staff to a phone

19 number here and my understanding is that they can hear and
20 participate that way, if that's acceptable to the court. But
21 of course we defer to the court's preference.
22 THE COURT: We are concerned about feedback from being
23 on a speakerphone in that room. The phone number for
24 nonspeaking co-counsel that was provided, that line is not
25 full, and I would assume the executive leadership of the office
