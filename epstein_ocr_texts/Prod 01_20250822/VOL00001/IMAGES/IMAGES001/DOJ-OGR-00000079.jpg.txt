While courts can “vacate any judgment and grant a
new trial if the interest of justice so requires,” Fed. R.
Crim. P. 33(a), they should do so “sparingly” and only
in “the most extraordinary circumstances.””* A district
court “has broad discretion to decide Rule 33 motions
based upon its evaluation of the proof produced” and is

A Rule 33 motion based on a juror’s alleged
erroneous response during voir dire is governed by
McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood.*!
Under McDonough, a party seeking a new trial “must
first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer
honestly a material question on voir dire, and then
further show that a correct response would have
provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.”

The District Court applied the McDonough stand-
ard, found Juror 50’s testimony credible, and deter-
mined that Juror 50’s erroneous responses during voir
dire were “not deliberately incorrect” and that “he
would not have been struck for cause if he had pro-
vided accurate responses to the questionnaire.”** In

“[tlo invalidate the result of a [ ] trial because of a juror’s
mistaken, though honest response to a question, is to insist on
something closer to perfection than our judicial system can be
expected to give.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 555.
