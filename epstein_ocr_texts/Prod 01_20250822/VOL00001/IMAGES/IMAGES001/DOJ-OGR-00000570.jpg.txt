1 presumed innocent people in jail, whether it's Rikers Island or

2 the MCC.

5 I again passionately urge your Honor to consider

4 Mr. Epstein's release. Thank you so much for the time, Judge.

5 THE COURT: Thank you.

6 Anybody else? Did you want to comment?

7 MR. ROSSMILLER: If we could just briefly respond,

8 your Honor.

9 THE COURT: Also I know if there are going to be any
10 more submissions in response to today, can you do them by noon
11 tomorrow? Is that reasonable?

12 MR. WEINBERG: 5:00 would be easier, given my travel
13 obligations, Judge. And I do want to meet the government's
14 reference today to a 1982 passport when he was 28 years old
15 that expired over 30 years ago. I'd rather address that when I
16 have some more time.
17 THE COURT: 5:00.
18 What about you, Mr. Rossmiller? Are you going to
19 respond?
20 I don't know if there are open issues, but there are
21 some instances where you're entitled to rest on the record,
22 but the search of the East 71st mansion, there might be some
23 evidence from that.
24 MR. ROSSMILLER: Your Honor, I can tell you certainly
25 we'd be prepared to file anything additional by tomorrow at
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
