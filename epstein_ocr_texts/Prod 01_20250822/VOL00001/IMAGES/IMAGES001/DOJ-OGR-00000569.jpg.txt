1 MR. WEINBERG: I do understand, but it's the

2 complexity and the magnitude of the pretrial preparation, not

5 just the sentencing consequences that requires us to put that

4 issue before the Court.

5 Second, I'm not here to say there should be those kind
6 of monetary conditions. I know, at least in my state, the

7 Commonwealth of Massachusetts, there's a movement that I read

8 regularly about in the Boston Globe -- maybe it's similar

9 here -- to stop that state practice.

10 THE COURT: It is.

11 MR. WEINBERG: Third, the Bail Reform Act, the federal
12 Bail Reform Act of 1984, has a provision saying that a

13 defendant should not be denied release based on their inability

15 Congress disapproves of locking someone up because there's a

16 $500 bail that they can't make.

20 reaction to the excess, the overcriminalization, the
al overimprisonment that characterized the 1980's and the war on
22 crime and the war on drugs.
23 So I at least stand here, as someone with over 45
24 years of observation, and believe and hope that one of the
25 areas that we begin to reverse the excess is in keeping so many
