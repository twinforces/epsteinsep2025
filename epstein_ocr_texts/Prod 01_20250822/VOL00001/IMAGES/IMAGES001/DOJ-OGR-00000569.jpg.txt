‘Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page59o0f74 59
MR. WEINBERG: I do understand, but it's the
complexity and the magnitude of the pretrial preparation, not

just the sentencing consequences that requires ‘us fo put that

issue before the Court.

Second, I'm not here to say there should be those kind

Commonwealth, of Massachusetts, there's a movement that, I read
regularly about in the ‘Boston Globe -- maybe it's similar
here -- to stop that state practice.

THE COURT: It. is.

MR. WEINBERG: Third, the Bail. Reform Act, the federal.

Bail Reform Act. of 1984, has a provision saying that a

defendant should not be denied release based on their inability

to satisfy a monetary condition. So I think to some extent

Congress disappreves of locking someone up because there's a
$500 bail that they can't make.

I'm 73 yedars old. I gréw up in the Warren Court
where life was different, and the criminal justice system got
politicized to some extent. J. think there is almost the
reaction to the excess, the, Overcriminalization, the
Ovérimprisonment that chardcterized thé 1980's and the war on
crime and the war on drugs.

years of observation, and believe and hope that, one of ‘the

aréas that, we bégin to révérse the éxeéss is in keéping so many
