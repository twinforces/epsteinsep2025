The BOP, for their part, has only exacerbated these problems. For example, on a legal
visit today to review images on a laptop computer provided by the Government, we were told
that we could not sit on the same side of the table as Ms. Maxwell to review the images
simultaneously. Instead, we were directed by MDC prison guards to sit across from Ms.
Maxwell, such that we could not see what she was reviewing or meaningfully discuss the
materials.

To compound the problem, we were told by the team leader that defense counsel would
not be permitted to pass Ms. Maxwell papers for her to review or sign. This required a break in
the meeting so that defense counsel could call the prosecutors to intervene. The prosecutors
agreed to call the MDC to ensure that defense counsel could pass legal papers to Ms. Maxwell.
But that message was clearly not received by the MDC. After returning to the MDC, we were
told that we could pass Ms. Maxwell only documents that required her signature, but not
documents that needed her review. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to participate in her defense
and adequately prepare for trial if she cannot review documents prepared by her attorneys.
Accordingly, we ask the Court to order the BOP to allow defense counsel to pass legal papers to
Ms. Maxwell for her review during prison visits.

The Government cannot discharge its discovery obligations by partially completing them.
The Government must fully complete them and do so on the deadlines they agreed to with the
Court. And it goes without saying that the Government cannot discharge its discovery
obligations by producing the discovery to defense counsel. Ms. Maxwell has a right to review all
the discovery to participate in her own defense. As such, she must have a complete set of
readable discovery in the MDC, which she does not have. The Government has created these
problems by insisting on detention prior to trial. It is their burden to fix them.

The Government has not requested any relief in its letter of October 7, 2020. Ms.
Maxwell anticipates that once the Government responds to her discovery requests and after
further conferrals the parties will be in a better position to seek relief from the Court. It may be
appropriate for the Court to schedule a status conference after November 9 to consider these
issues.
