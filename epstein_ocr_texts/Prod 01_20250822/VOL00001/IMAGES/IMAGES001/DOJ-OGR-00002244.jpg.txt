‘suecessfully to resist-cxtradition to the United States in relation, to the charges in'the superseding
indictment. dated. 7 July 2020.”); Def. Mot., Ex. V 4 76 (‘Itwould ... become a:matter. for the
French government'to decide on;whether, or not’to issue an, extradition deerce against Ms
Ghislaine Maxwell.”); id. 4 77 (“[I]tas highly“unlikely that:the French, government would refuse
to issue.and execute an extradition decree against Ms Maxwell... .”).. Nor has:the Defendant
presented any. cases where courts addressed the question, of whether an. anticipatory waiver of
extradition is enforceable; while she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition,
the reasoning in:those cases turned. on. other factors and the courts did not dwell. on. the
enforceability of'such waivers. See; eig., United, States'v: Girillo, No. 99-1514,.1999 WL
1456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July 13, 1999); United States ¥. Salivigno, 314 F.Supp. 2d 115, 1.1.9

such ‘waivers :as one: among several conditions of release, but they did. not make any express
determination. that-such waivers are enforceable. On the other hand, some courts have expressly
opined that such. waivers are wnenforccable. Sée, é.g., United States ¥. Epstein, 425 FE. Supp. 3d
306, 325 (S.D.N.¥...2019) (describing the:“‘Defense proposal to give advance consent to
extradition, and, waiver of extradition.rights” as “an empty gesture”); Unifed States v. Morrison,
No. 16-MR-118, 2016 WL 7421924, at *4 (W.D.N-Y. Dee. 23,2016) (“Although the defendants
have signed.a. waiver, of extradition, such a'waiver,may‘not become valid until an, extradition
request is ‘pending in, Canada and:may: be subjecctto, withdrawal.”); United States v. Stroh, No.
396-CR-139 (AHN), 2000 WL 1832956, at *5: (D. Conn..Nov. 3, 2000) (“[I]t appears: that there.
is a substantial legal question as to whether any: country to'which.he fled would enforce any
waiver of extradition signed under the circumstances presented, in this case. At any event,
