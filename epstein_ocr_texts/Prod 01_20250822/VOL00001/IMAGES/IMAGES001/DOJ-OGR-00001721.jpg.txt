Government had already confirmed to the defendant. the identities of three of the four relevant,
victims,.and that.a fourth victim, whose identity was at:issuc, was the subject. of a charge that failed
to idéntify the date of her alleged rape or any prior encounters between the victim and the
defendant. 2009 WL 4271/11, .at.*2. None of those facts are present here—by: contrast, here, the
Indictment, particularly: describes relevant time periods and events, including. referring ‘to the
defendant’s conversations:with victims, interactions with-victims, and-specific relevant locations.*

To the extent, the defendant 1s arguing ‘that she cannot. identify the nature of the chargés
against.her, the:proper vehicle for such.an argument is:a motion for a bill of particulars.. Any: such.
motion. can be made: in. December with. all other motions and following the completion of
discovery. ‘While the Government anticipates opposing such, a ‘motion as. bascless. on, the facts of
this case, ‘the Government respectfully submits.'that: iv any cyvent: such, a motion could ‘not be
meaningfully evaluated at ‘this stage, prior to the completion of discovery. See Wirited States v.
Mahabub, 13. Cr. 908 (AJN), 2014 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. '26,.2014) (denying a
motion-for a bill of particulars: that:sought, among, other things, the “alleged:victim and noting, that.

“{a] bill of particulars is not required unless the charges of the indictment are so general that they:
do not;advise the defendant ofthe specific: acts of which he ‘is ‘accused. The government:can also
discharge ils obligation. to disclose'this information by other:means, svch.as by. presenting evidenée:
in discovery... . A bill-of particulars. is not’ meant to provide.'the, details ofthe. government’s
evidence, or to “be used. as: an. investigative tool.”) (emphasis added, quotations and citations
omitted); see also United States. v. Thompson, 13 Cr. 378 (AJN), 2013 WL 6246489, at. *7
(S.D.N.Y. Dee. 3, 2013) (denying a ‘motion. for a bill of particulars and noting that such motions
are not’ “a. geniral investigative tool, a discovery device or a‘mceans to compel. the government. to
disclose evidence oF Witnessés ‘to be, offered pridr to trial’) (smphasis added) (quotations and,
citation. omitted); cf United’ States. -v. Sindone,, 01 Cr. 517 (MBM), 2002 WL 48604, at *2
(S-D-N-Y. Jan. 14, 2002) (denying a motion. for a bill of particulars to identify: “the unnamed.
alleged, victim(s)” but. instructing the g government to disclose the name of any: victim it did not
intend;to call.as'a, witness at trial/by 14 days prior to the start of-trial)..

Alternatively; to the extent.defense:counsel is unable to assess-or. comprchend the discovery:
produced by the Government, the:Government.is more than. willing to discuss with. the defense

*Defense counscl’s invocation of:the protective. order i in.support of its argument, Def. Ltr. at 1,'3,

should. be of little comfort. The:Government is ‘deeply concerned by the recent actions of the
defendant’s counsel, who represent her in both this criminal. matter ‘as well as in certain, civil.
‘matters, and who in.a recént:public. filing in a civil case réferred to their reecipt of sealed materials
in, discovery in. this case. In-partieular, the defendant’s counsel publicly claimed in.a civil filing,
that they: purportedly had reccived “critical. new information” from: ‘the criminal case’ that it could
publicly < a, “desire to 'seck modification, of the protective ‘order it in this c case tO" usc “such: materials i in,
‘the civil case,'which the protective order expressly precludes. See Ginffre v. Ghislaine.Maxwell,

No. 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP) (Dkt. 1100). Morcower, even assuming ‘the. defendant. intends to
scrupulously adhere to the terms ofthe protective: order, that would:not change the relevant legal.
standards, which weigh heavily against granting the requested relief.
