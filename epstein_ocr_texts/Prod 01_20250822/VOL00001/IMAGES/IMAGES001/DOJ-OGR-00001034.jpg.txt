1 her as Scott and Janet Marshall, who both have British accents.
2 Scott Marshall told her that the -- that he was retired from

3 the British military and he was currently working on writing a
4 book. Janet Marshall described herself as a journalist who

5 wants privacy. they told the agent they wanted to purchase the
6 property quickly through a wire and that they were setting up

7 an LLC. Those conversations took place in November 2019. Your
8 Honor, following the defendant's arrest, the real estate agent
9 saw a photograph of the defendant in the media and realized

10 that the person who had introduced herself as Janet Marshall,
11 who had toured the house and participated in these

12 conversations about the purchase, was the defendant, Ghislaine
13 Maxwell.

14 That series of facts, which I just learned about this
15 morning, your Honor, are concerning for two reasons. First,

16 additionally, it appears that the defendant has attempted to

17 conceal an asset from the court, and at the very least she has
18 not been forthcoming in the course of her Pretrial Services

19 interview; and, second, it appears that the defendant has used
20 an alias and that she was willing to lie to hide herself and
21 hide her identity and we discussed the additional indicia in
22 our briefing your Honor. So that raises real concerns.
23 Moreover, the defendant's claims about her finances to
24 Pretrial Services should be concerning to the court for
25 additional reasons.
