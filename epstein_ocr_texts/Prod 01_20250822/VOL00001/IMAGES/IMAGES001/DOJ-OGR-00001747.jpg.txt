ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

On August 17, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed a scaled Ictter motion seeking

nd. Circuit i in i

documents it in: question:a are - judic al. documents: Gi) a assess thew weight of the common law: pr esumpt on ofiaiceess to
the materials; and (iii) ‘balance competing considerations against: the presumption ofaccess. Jd at 19-20. “Such
countervailing: factors include but are not!limited:to ‘the danger of:i impairing law enforcement orjudicial. efficiency’
and “the: privacy’ ‘interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Jd. at 120 (quoting United States v.. Amodeo,, 71. F.3d 1.044,
LO48 (2¢.Cir. 1995). (“Amodeo If’)). The:Government’s’ ‘proposed redactions satisfy’ thistest. First, the Court finds
thatithe defendant’ $ letter:motion is “relevant to the per formance: of the judicial function-and useful in:the judicial
process,” thereby qualifying: as a “judicial document” for purposes ‘of the first Clement of the Ligosch test. Wniited

presumption of-access attaches, thereby. satisfying’ the second clement. Butiin balancing ‘competing, considerations
againstithe presumption.of access, the! Court finds that:the arguments the Government has put-forth including,
most*notably, the’ threat’ that public disclosure!of the redacted sections would interfere w ith an ongoing: grand jury’
investigation: ‘favor the Government’s proposed narrowly tailored redactions.

In light of-this ruling, the partics arc her¢by- ORDERED to:meet and confer with respect to:proposed redactions to
