UNITED STATES’ SEALED MOTION TO DISMISS
FOR LACK OF SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION
The United States hereby requests that this Court enter an order dismissing these
proceedings and the Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s Rights Act, 18 U.S.C. Section
3771 (DE 1, the “Petition”), through which Petitioners Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 have
advanced claims pursuant to the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), for lack of subject
matter jurisdiction.| This Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Petition because
' See, e.g., Grupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S. 567, 571 (2004)
(“Challenges to subject-matter jurisdiction can of course be raised at any time prior to final
judgment.”); United States v. Giraldo-Prado, 150 F.3d 1328, 1329 (11th Cir. 1998) (recognizing
that “‘a party may raise jurisdiction at any time during the pendency of the proceedings”); Harrell
& Sumner Contracting Co. v. Peabody Petersen Co., 546 F.2d 1227, 1229 (Sth Cir. 1977)
(“[UJ}nder Rule 12(h)(3), Fed.R.Civ.P., the defense of lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be
raised at any time by motion of a party or otherwise.”); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). In the
present motion, the United States seeks dismissal of Petitioners’ claims based on both a legal and
factual challenge to the Court’s subject matter jurisdiction. This Court may properly consider
and weigh evidence beyond Petitioners’ allegations when evaluating such a challenge to the
Court’s subject matter jurisdiction:
Factual attacks [on a Court’s subject matter jurisdiction] ... “challenge subject
matter jurisdiction in fact, irrespective of the pleadings.” In resolving a factual
attack, the district court “may consider extrinsic evidence such as testimony and
affidavits.” Since such a motion implicates the fundamental question of a trial
