It-is impossible to overstate the: deleterious. cffeet of the conditions under which.Ms.
‘Maxwell is detained. Upon arrival at the MDC, seven months ago, she was placed on suicide
‘watch though. io Competent medical professional. deemed. her. in. any manner suicidal, nor has. any’
psychologist. or'medical staffer ever found her to be suicidal at anytime during her detention.
For-wecks shewas' deprived of, Icgal material, the: ability to'use a telephone to make personal
calls, and.the opportunity. to exercise and. shower. Clearly; this was an. cffort fo avoid a
recurrence of the BOP’s ‘negligence regarding’ Jeffrey Epstein’s death. Contrary. to the way she is
hyper-monitored, Ms. Maxwell is classified with the standard CC1-Mh. designation: inmate with
no significant mental. health. care.

The overall conditions of detention have had.a, detrimental impact on Ms. Maxwell’s
health and, overall well-being; and 'she is withering to a shell of her former'sclf— losing weight,
losing hair; and. losing her ability to, concentrate. In addition to'the many difficulties impacting:
her review'of clectronic ‘discovery materials, the over-management and stress are impacting her
‘stamina and effectiveness in-preparing her defense and. conferring with counsel.

Having becn.inearcerated, in de ‘facto solitary confinement; for 225 days.and monitored by
two to:six guards, 24 hours a day with.a handheld.camcra dedicated to capturing her every. move,
except when it would.rceord improper Conduct on:the part of the guards, it is. not surprising 3 that
Ms. Maxwell feels she is ‘detained under the control of the Bureau. of “Pretrial Punishment.’

Very truly yours,

‘ec: All counsel
