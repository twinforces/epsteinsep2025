decision in Martindell v..Iniernational ‘1 elephone & ‘1 eleg ‘aph Corp. and, violated Maxwell’s
Tights.

In.Martindell, the government tried to obtain deposition.transcripts of twelve individuals
deposed in.a private shareholders’ derivative lawsuit. 594 F.2d, at 292-93. All twelve depositions
were taken “pursuant to a court-approved stipulation to the cffect:that'the. depositions should be
at 292. Without secking to intervene, and without. serving a subpoena orwarrant, the government.
called.and then-wrote to the district court to request access to the deposition transcripts. /d. at
293. The government claimed. that,the deposition, transcripts were relevant.to its investigation of,
‘perjury, subordination of perjury, and conspiracy related to the: 1970:presidential clection. in
Chile. /d. The government, “moreover, feared.that-unless it:could obtain the deposition
transcripts, it. would. be, unable to secure ‘statements from the witnesses’ because, they would:claim,
theit Fifth Amendment rights in. any investigative interviews.”./d. The district court denied the
government’s request, “holding: thatthe deposition, testimony, had been. given in-reliance upon the
protective order; thus rendering*unnccessary’ invocation. by the’witnesses of their Fifth,
Amendment rights, that the requested turnover would raise constitutional. issues, and that
principles of fairness mandated enforcement of'the protective order.” Jd. The government.
appealed, and the Second Circuit affirmed.

The government:may not . . . simply by picking up the telephone or writing a.letter
to the: court (as was the case here), ‘insinuate itself into a private civil lawsuit:
between others. The proper procedure, as the government. should know, was cither
to subpoena ‘the deposition transcripts for use in a pending proceeding such. as.a.
grand jury investigation or trial, in‘which, the issue could. be raised. by motion, to
quash or modify the: subpoena, see Rule 1,7(c),.or to seek: permissive: intervention,
in the private; action pursuant to Rule.24(b), forthe purpose of obtaining vacation
or modification of the protective. order.
