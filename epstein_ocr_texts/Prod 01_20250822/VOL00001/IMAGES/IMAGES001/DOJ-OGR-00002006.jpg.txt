Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 34 of 45
appeared in the High Court, House of Lords and Supreme Court in leading extradition cases; and
has acted as an expert consultant to the Commonwealth Secretariat on international cooperation.
(/d.). In 2011 and 2012, Mr. Perry was part of a select team appointed by the U.K. government
to conduct a review of the United Kingdom’s extradition arrangements, a review that formed the
basis of changes to the 2003 Extradition Act. (/d. Annex B § 3.1).

In Mr. Perry’s opinion, it is “highly unlikely that Ghislaine Maxwell would be able
successfully to resist extradition to the United States” in connection with this case. (Perry Rep.
4 2(e)). After concluding that none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition or human
rights objections would prevent Ms. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr. Perry explains that Ms.
Maxwell’s waiver of her extradition rights “would be admissible in any extradition proceedings
and, in cases, such as this one, where the requested person consents to their extradition, the
extradition process is likely to take between one and three months to complete.” (/d. JJ] 24-39).
Mr. Perry’s report also undercuts the government’s representation at the initial hearing regarding
likelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining that “a person who absconded from [a] US criminal
proceeding in breach of bail . . . is extremely unlikely to be granted bail” in a subsequent U.K.
extradition proceeding. (Perry Rep. § 23).

France. The accompanying report of William Julié (“Julié Rep.”) reviews the French
extradition process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julié is an expert on
French extradition law who has handled extradition cases both within and outside the European
Union and regularly appears as an extradition expert in French courts. (Julié Rep.) (attached as
Exhibit V). Mr. Julié explains that, contrary to the government’s representation, “the extradition
of a French national to the USA is legally permissible under French law.” (/d. at 1).
