Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document97 Filed 12/14/20: Page 34 of 45

has acted as an expert consultant'to, the Commonwealth, Secretariat on international, cooperation.
(/d.). In.201:1. and 2012, Mr. Perry was part of a.select team appointed by the U.K. government
to conduct a review ofthe United. Kingdom’s extradition. arrangements, a. review that formed the
basis of changes. to the 2003 Extradition Act. (/d. Annex B 3.1).

In. Mr, Perry’s opinion, it.is “highly-unlikely that-Ghislaine Maxwell. would be able
successfully to'resist-extradition tothe United States” in connection with'this case. (Perry Rep.
¢ 2(e)). After concluding that.none of the potentially applicable bars to extradition. or human

tights objections would.prevent Ms.. Maxwell’s extradition, Mr, Perry explains that:Ms.
Maxwell’s ‘waiver, of her'extradition rights “would: be admissible in any’ extradition proceedings
and, in.cases, Such as this ofie,-where the-tequested person consents to, their extradition, the
extradition process js likely to take between,one and three months to complete.” (/d. {¥ 24-39).
Mr. Perry’s ‘report also indercuts the government’s representation. at‘the initial hearing regarding
likelihood of bail (see Tr. 27), opining:that “a-person who absconded from [a] US criminal
proceeding in, breach of bail. ...... is extremely unlikely'to be granted ’bail” in, a subsequent: U:K.
extradition proceeding. (Perry Rep.'§ 23).

France. The accompanying report of William Julié (“Juli¢-Rep.”) reviews the French.
extradition, process as it would likely be applied to Ms. Maxwell. Mr. Julié is an expert on
French extradition. law who has. handled extradition.cases both within.and outside the European
Union and regularly appears. as an extradition expert in French courts. (Juli¢ Rep.) (attached as
Exhibit V)., Mr. Julié.explains that, contrary to the government’s representation, “the extradition.

of a French national to the USA. is legally permissible under French law:” (Jd at‘1).
