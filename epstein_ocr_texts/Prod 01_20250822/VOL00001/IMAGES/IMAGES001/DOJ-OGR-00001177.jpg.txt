other ‘inmates in protective custody. Additionally, psychology and. medical staff check: on the
defendant, daily, MDC. legal staff-are highly attuned, to any. complaints the defendant has raised,
and. following initial complaints about the defendant’s dict:carly in-her incarceration, the MDC has
ensured that; the defendant reccives three full ;mcals. per day and, has access. to commissary from.
which she can supplement'her dict.

The MDC has taken numerous steps to strike the balance between the security of the:
institution and providing the defendant with adequate time, and resources to prepare her defense.
In that vein, many ‘of the scarches the defendant complains of—such.as scarches after every visit,
searches of her cell, pat downs when she ‘is moved, and. directing’her to open her mouth for visual,
inspection (while the scarching:staff member is‘ wearing a mask)—are the same searches to. which
every other. inmate: is:subjected. forthe: security of the institution. MDC Iegal.counscl has assured.
the Government that MDC staff does not:record or listen to the substance: of the defendant’s calls
and'visits with legal counsel. To the extent MDC. staff conducts additional searches. or monitoring
security of the institution.and the defendant.

With respect to the defense. concerns regarding COVID-19, the Government recognizes, as
it-did in. its initial bail briefing, that-the virus presents a, challenge at any jail, facility., Atleast for
this defendant, the MDC’s precautionary measures appear to have worked. When the. defendant:
was potentially exposed. to the virus; :she was placed in-quarantine, remained.asymptomatic, tested.
negative, and then was released from quarantine., As the Court found at the initial bail hearing, the
defendant has rio underlying health:conditions that'would.placée herat greater risk’of Complications
from COVID-19. (Tr.89). For that same reason, the:Court should again reject-the:suggestion that.

the pandemic warrants the: defendant’s release.
