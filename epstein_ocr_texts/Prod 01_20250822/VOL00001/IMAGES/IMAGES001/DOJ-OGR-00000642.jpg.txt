relatively straightforward. Im my view, a public hearing

clearly is nevertheless the preferred vehicle for its

résolution.
Incidentally, while I'm on this subject, IL got some

help today from the New York Law Journal from ‘two professors

who write that. a hearing is -— let me tell you exactly what
they said. They Say, in ‘part, that this is an, odd moment for
transparency in a criminal case, I think that is an odd
sentience to hear about, trdnspdrency in a criminal Case.

They go on to say that normally, if a prosecutor seeks
to dismiss an indictment for suth ah obvidusly worthy reason,
the court would samply grant, the request. As to that
statement, I respectfully say it is incorrect as a matter of
Law’.

They go 6n té say the judge would not schedule a
hearing 'and he definitely would, not allow ‘the victims to speak,
If he did hold a Hearing, whatever informational interests the
victims may have would be served by affording them a chance to.
attend thé hedring, n6t by giving them a speaking role.

Io read it. It was incredulous. I'm still
incredulous; I doén't. quite understand at. all. There is a
suggestion in the artacle that the reason they are making these
suggestions has té do with Minimization of drama in this Gaseé.
In the Jeffrey Epstein. case, there has not been much a.
minimization of drama, and what ‘little drama might happen
