Your Honor,
This letter is provided by way of support for the release on bail of
Ghislaine Maxwell,
Ghislaine and | have always remained in close touch. During the last 30 years or so
this has been primarily by phone and email as Ghislaine has lived for the greater part
of that time in the US whilst | live in London. On my last two trips to the US in
February 2013 and in December 2018 | stayed with her for about a week on both
occasions and she always made a point of seeing me whenever she came through
Londo, rr areas where we would both
consider | have some knowledge | would certainly think of myself as a trusted
advisor of hers.
a Ghislaine eventually excelled academically and ended up
graduating with honours from Oxford University and has gone on to achieve many
and varied professional goals. Determination is a notable characteristic of hers, as is
her naturalness and honesty â€” which | have_never doubted - whether in her dealings
with me personally or to my knowledge with i onc friends, or in
her business interests or charitable activities. Until the laying of these charges
against her, | am not aware there have ever been any allegations of criminal conduct
against Ghislaine whether in the US or in any other country for that matter.
Ghislaine has always been an exemplary EES Urrogate mother and
friend. My son travelled with me on both my trips to the US mentioned above when
he was aged staying with Ghislaine at her then homes
in New York an ogether with me, my son TU
stands four-square behind
her as she seeks to defend and clear her name. She has spent many hours with my
son and he and | have never witnessed any inappropriate behaviour on her part. |
