1 opportunity to respond to some of those points, to the extent

2 that the defense is arguing that Mr. Epstein should be granted
3 bail as a general matter and the court is going to consider

4 those arguments.

a) THE COURT: Well, the court always considers the

6 parties' arguments.

7 But let me just come back to Mr. Weingarten for a

8 minute. Mr. Weingarten, under the Bail Reform Act you are

9 entitled to a continuance of three days, which I guess would

10 take us to Thursday.

11 MR. WEINGARTEN: Right.

12 THE COURT: The other alternative, I guess, if you

13 want to de facto extend that three days is consent to detention
14 without prejudice.

15 MR. WEINGARTEN: We estimated that by Thursday we

16 could get you something in writing and then appear back before
17 you at your convenience.

18 THE COURT: Okay. Do you want to schedule it -- well,
19 I think Thursday's proceedings right now would be in front of
20 Judge Berman unless he wants to send it back to me for bail,
21 but do you want to put this down for detention hearing on
22 Thursday?
23 MR. WEINGARTEN: Can I make one point that I don't
24 want to forget that I think is extremely important?
25 THE COURT: Go ahead.
