2. The Department of Justice knows how to draft plea
agreements to bind only part of the Department in
future prosecutions.

As the trial court correctly noted, “[s]ingle district
plea agreements are the norm.” (App. 56a) A survey of
plea agreements from districts across the county reveals
that the Department of Justice routinely drafts plea
agreements with this limited single-district scope.

Here are examples from districts across the country:

Middle District of Alabama: “The defendant
understands that this agreement binds only the Office
of the United States Attorney for the Middle District of
Alabama and that the agreement does not bind any other
component of the United States Department of Justice,
nor does it bind any state or local prosecuting authority.”
United States v. McIntyre, No. 1:24-er-00211, ECF No.
33 (Dec. 19, 2024), at 14.

Northern District of Alabama: “The Defendant
understands and agrees that this Agreement does not bind
any other United States Attorney in any other district,
or any other state or local authority.” United States v.
Giaquinto, No. 2:22-cr-00035-MHH-GMB, ECF No. 326
(Nov. 18, 2024), at 13.

Eastern District of California: “This plea agreement
is limited to the United States Attorney’s Office for
the Eastern District of California and cannot bind any
other federal, state, or local prosecuting, administrative,
or regulatory authorities.” United States v. Amani
Investments, No. 2:23-cr-00014-JAM, ECF No. 8 (E.D.
Cal. Feb. 7, 2023), at 1.
