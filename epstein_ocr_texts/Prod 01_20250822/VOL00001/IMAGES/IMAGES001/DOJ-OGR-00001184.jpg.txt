Article.3 of the Bilateral Extradition Treaty signed. on April 23, 1996 between, the United
States of America and France stipulates that “The. requested State is not bound to grant the extradition.
of'any of its:nationals, but the Executive Power of the United. States has.the right to do'so atits
discretion if. it'deems it appropriate.”

In application of this Treaty‘and of the general principle of non-extradition of nationals under
French law, France systematically-refuses to grant the extradition of French:nationals'to the. American
‘judicial ‘authorities, while: the American authoritics.regularly agree: to extradite their nationals to
‘France.

It should 'be-noted that the principle of non-extradition of nationals applics: not only to the.
United States but also to all.other States. except the Member States .of'the European Union under the
terms of the Law of March, 9,'2004 transposing the framework decision, of June 13,'2002.0n the
‘European arrest warrant, which provides that the surrender of the requested person:may’not'be refused
on the Sole ground of his French nationality.

This'principle-of non, extradition. of nationals fits into the context; tof the construction of the
the Member States of the European t Union. This high. level of political: integr ation. existing between: ‘the
Member States. of the European, Union. goes hand i in hand-with a certain homogeneity within, these:
States’ in-terms of the'scale of penalties: aswell as in terms of adjustment of penalty: methods; the
member states being bound by the Sane international obligations (in particular the obligations arising
from the European Convention forthe: Protection. of Human Rights: and.Fundamental. Freedoms and.
from the; case law of the European Court of Human Rights).

In any. event, the: principle: ofnon-extradition.of nationals is a principle of extradition law from
which France has never'deviated outside the framework of the, European Union.
