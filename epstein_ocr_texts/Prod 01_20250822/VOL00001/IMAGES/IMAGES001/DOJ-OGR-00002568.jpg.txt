case and use her own words against her. 594 F.2d at 294. The Fifth Amendment would mean
nothing if an individual were told by a district court that she need not invoke its protections
because the government could not use her testimony against her—or at least could not do so
without notice and an opportunity to be heard—only to find out that the testimony she offered
with the district court’s blessing was the primary evidence against her in a criminal case and the
basis of perjury charges.

That is the lesson of United States v. Oshatz, in which this Court quashed a government
subpoena issued to a court reporter for a transcript of a deposition offered by the defendant in a
civil proceeding. 700 F. Supp. 696, 697 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). Oshatz (who had been indicted at the
time of his deposition) was deposed and did not invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination on “the understanding that a protective order would preserve his Fifth
Amendment rights.” /d. at 699. Applying Martindell, this Court quashed the government’s
subpoena and refused to release the deposition transcript because the “government [had] not
argued that the protective order was improvidently granted or that there [were] some
extraordinary circumstances or compelling need.” /d. at 701.

Here, as in Oshatz, Maxwell was deposed on “the understanding that a protective order
would preserve” the confidentiality of her testimony. And even though Maxwell had not been
indicted at the time of her depositions, the threat of an investigation was obvious, and that threat
was the very reason the Protective Order deliberately excluded a law-enforcement exception.
(Moreover, Maxwell moved the court to require Giuffre to disclose any law enforcement
investigation of which she was aware.) As in Oshatz, the Protective Order was designed to
preserve Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment rights. Where this Court in Oshatz granted a motion to
quash, here it should grant a motion to suppress.
