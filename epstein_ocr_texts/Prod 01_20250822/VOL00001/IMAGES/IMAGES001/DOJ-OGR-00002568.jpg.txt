case and use her own, words against her. 594: F.2d, at. 294. ‘The Fifth Amendment would mean
nothing if an. individual were told, by'a district, court that she ncéd ‘not invoke its protections
because the government could-not use her testimony against her—or at lcast could. not do so
without notice and ‘an. opportunity to be hcard—only to find out that the testimony she offered.
with the district Court?s' blessing was thé primary evidence against het .in.a criminal case. and the:
basis ‘of perjury charges.

That isthe lesson of United States v. Oshatz;, in. which, this ‘Court quashed a government
subpoena ‘issued to a court reporter for a transcript of a.deposition offered by the defendant in.a
civil, procceding. 700 F. Supp: 696, 697 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). Oshatz (who had been indicted at the
tinie of his deposition) was deposed. and did-rot invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege against’
sclf-incrimination.on “the understanding that a-protective order would preserve his Fifth
Amendment'rights.”’ /d., at 699. Applying Martindell, this ‘Court quashed the government’s
subpocna and refused to release thé deposition transcript because the “government [had] not
argued thatthe protective order was improvidently granted or'that there [were] some
extraordinary circumstances or compelling need.” /d; at 701.

Here, as in Oshatz,, Maxwell. was deposed on “the understanding that a protective: order
would.preserve” the confidentiality of her'testimony..And.even, though Maxwell had not’been
indicted at the time of hér depositions, the threat, of an investigation was obvious, and, that threat
was the: very reason the Protective Order deliberately excluded'a.law-cnforeement.exception.
(Moreover, Maxwell moved,the court to require Giuffre‘to disclose any Jaw enforeement
preserve Maxwells Fifth Amendment rights. Where this Court.in. Oshutz granted a motion,to

quash, here it should grant. a ‘motion. to suppress.
