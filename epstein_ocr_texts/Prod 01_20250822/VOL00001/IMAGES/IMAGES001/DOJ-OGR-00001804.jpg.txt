photographs of victims who were abused during periods of time that post-date the Indictment and
who the Government does not anticipate calling to testify at trial—and as such, do not constitute
Brady material, Rule 16 evidence, or impeachment material for any trial witnesses—the defendant
is not entitled to their immediate production. This is particularly so when weighed against the
risks of early production to the Government’s ongoing investigation.

By contrast, the Government has met its burden under Rule 16(d)(1) by explaining why
the requested delay is necessary and how the Government would be prejudiced by the immediate
production of the Materials. In particular, the proposed delay will allow the Government to
continue its investigation into conduct outside the period charged in the Indictment without
revealing to the defendant the identities of the witnesses in that investigation. The premature
revelation of this information would give the defendant the opportunity to interfere with the
Government’s investigation before it is complete. Such information could allow her to contact
and intimidate witnesses, destroy evidence relevant to the investigation, or alert other targets of
the investigation. Moreover, the requirement that any evidence of any victim’s abuse by Jeffrey
Epstein at any point in time must be immediately disclosed to the defense in this case, even when
it has no bearing on the charges in the Indictment, risks deterring additional victims from coming
forward to assist in the Government’s investigation. Allowing the delayed production of these
materials would permit the Government to complete its investigation without interference while
still giving the defense everything it is asking for well in advance of trial.

Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court approve the
Government’s request to delay disclosure of these Materials.

Respectfully submitted,
