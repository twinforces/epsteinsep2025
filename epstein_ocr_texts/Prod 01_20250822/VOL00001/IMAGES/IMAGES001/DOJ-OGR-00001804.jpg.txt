Brady. material, Rule 16 evidence, ‘or impeachment material, for any: trial witnesses—the defendant
isnot entitled to their immediate ‘production. ‘This is particularly so when, weighed against the
risks of :carly*‘production to the Government’s ongoing investigation.

By contrast, the Government has met ts: burden : under Rule 16(d)(1) by explaining why
production of the Materials, ‘Tn n particular, the proposed delay will ‘allow the Government to
continuc its ‘investigation into conduct. outside ‘the period. charged in the Indictment: without.
revealing to the defendant the identitics of the witnesses in. that investigation. The premature
revelation. of. this information.'would. give the: defendant the opportunity: to interfere -with the:
Government’s investigation before it:is complete: Such information. could. allow her to contact
and ‘intimidate ‘witnesses, destroy evidence relevant to the investigation, or alert other targcts of
the investigation. Moreover, the: requirement that.any evidence of.any victim’s abuse by Jeffrey
Epstein at. any ‘point. in time must be immediately disclosed to the defense in. this case, even’ when
it has no bearing on the charges in. the. Indictment; risks, deterring additional victims from coming;
forward. to assist in the Government’s.:investigation. Allowing, the delayed production of these
materials would ‘permit. the Government to complete its: investigation without interference while
still giving the defense everything it is asking for well, in advance of trial.

Accordingly, ‘the ‘Government respéctfully requests that the Court approve the
Government’s:request to delay disclosure of these. Materials.
