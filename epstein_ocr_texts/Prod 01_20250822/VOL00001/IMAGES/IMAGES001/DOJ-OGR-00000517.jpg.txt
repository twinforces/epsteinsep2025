1 So the question is the following: Mr. Epstein has

2 been required to register as a sex offender in several states

5 going back I believe to 2008 when he pled guilty to an offense
4 in Florida.

5 Those states include New York, Florida, and the Virgin
6 Islands. So one question I have for each side is what about

10 from what's called a level 3, which is the highest level which
11 I think carries with it a high risk of recidivism, according to
12 these levels and to sex offender regulation.

13 And he sought to have that lowered to level 1. His

14 application was denied, as I understand the proceedings, by the
15 Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders New York state and then in
16 state court by the courts and, particularly, a decision of the
17 Honorable Justice Ruth Pickholz on our about January 18, 2011.

19 Appellate Division and was unanimously upheld.

23 side. First of all, they're free to comment on my description
24 of the proceeding before Judge Pickholz.
25 But the question is whether there were or are other
