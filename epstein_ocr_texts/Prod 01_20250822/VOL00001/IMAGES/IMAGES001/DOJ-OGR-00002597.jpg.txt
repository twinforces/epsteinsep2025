Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 142 Filed 02/04/21 Page 25. of 38

moved to dismiss a subsequent indictment.in this District as barred by what they claimed was an
earlier “plea agreement” in the Eastern District; and the court denied the motion. Jd. The.
Second Circuit, in affirming the denial, stated simply-that “[a] plea agreement binds only the
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” /d. at 672.

Thus, not only is.Annabi readily distinguishable from this case, but it explicitly.
recognizes that’'plea agreements canbe binding in other jurisdictions, and that a ‘plea agreement
that has the “affirmative appearance” of broad applicability—as the NPA doés here—will be:
enforced. according to its terms. The Second.Circuit’s subsequent application. of Annabi has been
entirely consistent with this'principle, and; with Ms. Maxwell’s position here. To the extent that
Annabi would preclude Ms. Maxwell from enforcing the NPA. outside the SDEL, it is.in conflict:
with the likely resolution of the issue under Eleventh Circuit law, which should apply here.

a. There is. an. “affirmative appearance” that thé 6o-éonspirator
immunity provision was intended to apply outside the SDEL.

The “affirmative appearance” contemplated by Annabi “need:not be an express
statement.” United Statés v. Russo, 80.1 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cit. 1986). Here, the “affirmative:
appearance” that:a broader restriction-was intended is. evident:within the four corners of the
NPA, when the NPA is reviewed as a-whole.. As noted above, the absence of any limiting
language in the co-conspirator immunity provision. stands in sharp contrast to, the NPA’Ss
provision regarding the non-prosecution of Epstein, which. is expressly: limited to prosecution “in
this, District.” NPA at 2. It.ts difficult: to envision a clearer “affirmative appearance” ‘than, the
express inclusion clsewhere in the agreement of a limitation. that is conspicuously absent here.

Basic principles of contract interpretation require an inference that the parties considered

the inclusion of the phrase “in this District” necessary to limit the scope of the non-prosecution
