Epstein’s equal—if not his superior—and baselessly caricatured asa villain of near-mythical.
proportions. Only at this time did the government, according to ‘its own account, decide to
launch.an investigation of Ms, Maxwell and prosecute her on allegations that-it-had previously,
repeatedly (and’properly, since any charges would.have been bascless) determined did. not merit
charges. In short, the government’s response to the media ‘frenzy was not to adhere to its earlier

and 1997, and in.an unspecified manner, she somchow- transported and Causéd.a
single individual to travel. across state lines for purposes of” engaging in unlawful.
sexual activity. with Epstein. Those charges, in turn, require the government to allege

relied upon an. alleged class B misdemeanor that, if the state statute, of limitations: had.
