State the formal extradition request as well as supporting documents required by the
Treaty’, the requested person is discharged from custody. If the government has received
the relevant documents, the normal extradition procedure may begin.

procedure followed by French institutions upon receipt of an extradition request made
by the USA.

13. Under Article 696-9 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, the procedure followed
in France is as follows:
