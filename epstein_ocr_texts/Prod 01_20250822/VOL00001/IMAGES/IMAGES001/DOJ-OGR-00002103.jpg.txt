(c) The appropriate judge is required to send the case to the Secretary of State™*:
(d) The speciality bar to extradition no longer applies”.

18. In all extradition cases, a requested person who consents to extradition loses the right to appeal against
either the decision to send the case to the Secretary of State or the order for extradition®®.,

19. The main effect of a decision by a requested person to consent to extradition is that the overall extradition
procedure is substantially shortened. In the context of US extradition cases, this means that removal can
take place within months, sometimes weeks, as compared to the longer timescales considered above.

C. Bail in extradition cases

20. Where extradition is sought for the purpose of prosecuting the requested person for an offence, the person
has the same right to bail as a defendant in domestic criminal proceedings, namely there is a presumption
that bail will be granted unless one of the exceptions in Schedule | to the Bail Act 1976 applies”’. The
three exceptions in Schedule 1 that most commonly apply in extradition proceedings are where there are
substantial grounds to believe that the requested person, if released on bail, would: (a) fail to surrender to
custody; (b) commit an offence while on bail; or (c) interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the
course of justice®®.

21. In considering whether to grant bail in an extradition case, the appropriate judge must have regard to as
many of the statutory considerations as appear to be relevant*’. Those considerations are: (a) the nature
and seriousness of the offence and the likely sentence; (b) the character, antecedents, associations and
community ties of the requested person; (c) the requested person’s record as respects the fulfilment of
their obligations under previous grants of bail in criminal proceedings; (d) the strength of the evidence
against the requested person; and (e) any risk that the requested person may cause physical to mental
injury to another person.

22. The approach taken by the High Court in a number of recent US bail appeals gives an indication as to the
way in which the statutory considerations are approached in practice. In all five cases bail was refused”.
