(c) The ‘appropriaic judge is required to send the case to ihe Sceretary of Siaie™;
(d) The speciality bar to extradition'no longer applies”.

18. In, all extradition casés, ‘a ‘requested ‘person, who consents ‘to extradition, loses the,'right to appeal against

cither the decision to send ‘the case to the Secretary of Siate or the order for extradition”.
19. The main. effect of a decision by a:tequésted person to consent to extiadition.is that the overall extradition

take place within months, sometimes wecks, as, compared to the longer timescales. considered above.
C. Bail in-extradition cases’

20. ‘Where extradition.is' sought for thé purpose of prosecuting thé réquésted person. for an offence, thé person
has thé same ;tight to, bail as a defendant in domestic criminal proccédings, namely. there-is a presumption
that bail will be granted unless. one of the exceptions in Schedule ‘| to the Bail Act.1976 applies”’. The
three exceptions in Schedule ||, ‘that; most’ commonly: apply. in, extradition proceedings. are where ‘there are
substantial grounds to believe that the:requested person, if: released ‘on. bail, would: (a) fail to surrender’to
custody; (b) commit: an offence while on bail; or (c) interfere: with witnesses or otherwise’ obstruct the
course. of justice’®,

211. In. considering whether to grant: bail in an extradition case, the appropriate judge must ‘have regard to. as
many’ of the statutory considerations as appear to be relevant™.. ‘Those ‘considerations are: (a) the nature
and seriousness of the offence and ‘the likely sentence; (b) ‘the character, antecedents, associations: and
Confimunhity ‘ties of the requested person: (C)'the tequésted person’s record as respects the fulfilivient. of
their obligations undér previous grants of bail in criminal proceedings; (d) the strength of the evidence
against the requested person; and (¢) any risk that the requested person may cause physical ‘to mental

injury to ‘another person..

22. The approach taken by the High Court in a number of*recent US bail appeals gives, an indication as. to. the

way. in:which the statutory: considerations. are approached. in, practice. In, all five cases bail. was refused™.
