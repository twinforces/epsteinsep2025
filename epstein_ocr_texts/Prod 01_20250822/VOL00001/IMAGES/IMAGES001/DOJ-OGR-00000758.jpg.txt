Thank you so much for your time.
I have attached the portion of the DOJ’s memo and link to their statement.
[Consistent with prior disclosures, this review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one
thousand victims. Each suffered unique trauma. Sensitive information relating to these
victims is intertwined throughout the materials. This includes specific details such as victim
names and likenesses, physical descriptions, places of birth, associates, and employment
history.
One of our highest priorities is combatting child exploitation and bringing justice to victims.
Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.
To that end, while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information regarding
Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government’s possession, it is the
determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no
further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.]
