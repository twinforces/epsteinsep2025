capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co—counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial-in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID—19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20-MC-—174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
and accorded, the rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to
reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the
crime or of any release... of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any
public proceeding in the district court involving release." Id. § 3771(a)(2), (4). The
Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that
appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the
Court by email within 24 hours in advance of the proceeding if any alleged victim
wishes to be heard on the question of detention pending trial. Finally, the time between
the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to
the delay involved in transferring the Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from
today through July 14, 2020. Due to the logistical issues involved in conducting a
remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the ends of justice served by [this exclusion]
outweigh the best interest of the public and the defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C.
§ 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported by the need for the parties to discuss
a potential protective order, which will facilitate the timely production of discovery in
a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED.
