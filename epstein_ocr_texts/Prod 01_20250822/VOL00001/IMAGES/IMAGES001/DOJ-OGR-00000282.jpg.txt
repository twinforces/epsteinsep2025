Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document6 Filed 07/11/19 Page:9 of 16

Finally. the government: fails to consider the doctrine of pre-indictment delay; inasmuch,
as the statute of limitations docs not. fully define a defendant’s rights with respect to delays that
oceurred:prior to the indictment. See generally United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307 (1971).
Here, the:delays of 14 years from the. last alleged act and..12 years since: Mr..Epstein signed: the
NPA are extraordinary. If the government is correct. that the NPA, does not, and. never did,
preclude ‘a‘prosecution ‘in, this distriet, then the government will have ‘to explain, Why it
purposefully delayed a prosecution. of someoric like Mr. Epstein, who, registered as a sex
offender ‘10 years ago and’was certainly no stranger to law enforéement. There is. rio legitimate
explanation for the delay.

il. The government fails to meet its burden of proving that no combination. of
conditions will:assure Mr. Epstein’s appearance and public safety.

An analysis ofthe: relevant statutory factors and case. law supports pretrial release. Even
presents: a. “tisk of flight, the > foregoing combination, of conditions virtually guarantees. his.
appearance’ as required. Crucially,'while it 1s, always-possible to, hypothesize ‘risks, the statutory
standard requires only.a reasonable assurance that the defendant, if released, will appear. The
conditions: proposed above, including electronic: GPS. monitoring, surrender of Mr. Epstein’s
passport, deregistration and/or grounding of. Mr. Epstcin’s private plane, and.a. substantial
personal, bond (including posting of personal residence(s) and/or private jet.as security to
guarantee appearance) would extinguish, any plausible risks. Mr. Epstein’s current notoricty
minimizes any. conceivable risk of flight ¢ven further. The location where he could be detained,—
his residence on East.71™ Street in. New York has cntrarices (one on the street, one in: ‘the. back)
that can. n.be castly monitored by video. With all of his financial. resources. in the United States
forfeiture allegation, ‘Mr. Epstein would be cacrificing virtually everything he has worked for — =
including any‘ collateral the Court requires he post to secure’ his, appearance = if he were to, flee
and to disentitle, himself to the defense of his property whether it ‘would be at risk to forfeiture or
for.a bail violation. a

To the extent.there is any doubt, regarding the proposed, conditions, there is tremendous
moral suasion:provided by. the ‘posting of real and:personal ‘property. of Mr. Epstcin’s brother, and
his close personal friend. of decades, who have. offered to co-sign a surcty bond to ensure Mr.
Epstein’s appearance. in Court as:required. Indeed, Mr. Epstcin’s brother.has agrced:to pledge
his family home, that he‘shares‘half'the year with his..14-ycar-old.daughter and. 1.7-ycar-old son,
‘in order to secure the bond. Its particularly telling that, Mr. Epstcin’s brother, his only living
immediate family member, as well, as his close personal friend, are both. willing to’ guarantee his:
appearance, notwithstanding x the widespread:nicgative publicity of Mr. Epstein that’ has
dominated the news. cycle sitice his. arrest.
