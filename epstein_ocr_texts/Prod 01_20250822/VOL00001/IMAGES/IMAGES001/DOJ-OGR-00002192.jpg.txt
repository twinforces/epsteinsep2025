(Tr. 87). Following the analysis the Court has already conducted, several of the cases cited by the
defendant are readily distinguishable. See, e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048,
1050-52 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (in ordering defendant released pending trial, noting, among other
things, that the defendant not only waived his right to appeal extradition in Switzerland, but that
he traveled immediately to the United States for arraignment, and that his country’s Government
committed to ensuring his appearance at trial); United States v. Bodmer, No. 03 Cr. 947 (SAS),
2004 WL 169790, at *1, *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 28, 2004) (setting conditions of bail where defendant
arrested abroad had already consented to extradition to the United States and finding that the
Government—whose argument was “based, in large part, on speculation” as to the defendant’s
financial resources—had “failed to meet its burden”). And there is support in the case law for

Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d 246, 252-55 (E.D.N.Y.), aff'd, No. 19-344, 2019 WL 2070656 (2d Cir.
Mar. 7, 2019) (ordering defendant detained pending trial and finding that defendant posed a risk
of flight based on several factors, including seriousness of the charged offenses, lengthy possible
sentence, strength of Government’s evidence, access to substantial financial resources, frequent
international travel, “minimal” ties to the United States, and “extensive ties to foreign countries
without extradition”); United States v. Patrick Ho, 17 Cr. 779 (KBF), Dkt. 49 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 4,
2018) (ordering defendant detained based on defendant’s risk of flight and citing the strength of
the Government’s evidence, lack of meaningful community ties, and “potential ties in foreign
jurisdictions”); United States v. Epstein, 155 F. Supp. 2d 323, 324-326 (E.D. Pa. 2001) (finding
that defendant’s dual citizenship in Germany and Brazil, lucrative employment and property
interests, and lack of an extradition treaty with Brazil weighed in favor of detention despite the
fact that defendant and his wife owned “substantial” property and other significant assets in the
