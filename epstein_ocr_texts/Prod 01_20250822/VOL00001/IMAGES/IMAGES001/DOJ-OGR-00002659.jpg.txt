the law.” Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, 208 (1988). This presumption
against retroactivity carries particular force with respect to statutes of limitations in the criminal
context. “[C]riminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of repose.’”
Toussie v. United States, 397 U.S. 112, 115 (1970) (quoting United States v. Scharton, 285 U.S.
518, 522 (1932)). This principle transcends any particular statute or any particular defendant:
“The purpose of a statute of limitations is to limit exposure to criminal prosecution to a certain
fixed period of time following the occurrence of those acts the legislature has decided to punish
by criminal sanctions.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at 114. “Such a limitation is designed to protect
individuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic facts may have
become obscured by the passage of time and to minimize the danger of official punishment
because of acts in the far-distant past.” /d. at 114-15.

In Landgraf, the Supreme Court articulated a two-step framework to evaluate the
proposed retroactive application of a statute to a particular case:

[T]he court's first task is to determine whether Congress has expressly prescribed

the statute’s proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there is no need to

resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such

express command, the court must determine whether the new statute would have

retroactive effect, i.e., whether it would impair rights a party possessed when he

acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with

respect to transactions already completed. Ifthe statute would operate

retroactively, our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent

clear congressional intent favoring such a result.
Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280. Thus, if Congress has “expressly prescribed” that a statute will or
will not apply retroactively, the inquiry ends; if not, the court proceeds to the second step to
determine whether the application of the statute would have impermissible “retroactive effect.”

As shown below, retroactive application of the 2003 Amendment fails both steps of the
Landgraf analysis. Regarding step one, not only did Congress fail to include an express
