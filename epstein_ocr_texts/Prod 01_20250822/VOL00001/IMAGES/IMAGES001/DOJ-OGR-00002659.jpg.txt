the law.” Bowen v. Georgetown Univ: [osp., 488 U.S, 204, 208 (1988). This presumption
agaifist retroactivity carries. particular force with.respect to statutes of limitations in the criminal
context. “[C]riminal limitations statutes are ‘to be liberally interpreted in favor of:repose.””
Toussie v. United States, 397 WS. 112, 115 (1970). (quoting United States -v. Scharton, 285 U.S.
518, 522 (1932)). This-principle transcends any particular statute or any particular defendant:
“The purpose of a statute: of limitations is to. limit exposure to.criminal prosecution. to a.certain
‘fixed period of time following the occurrence: of those acts the legislature has decided to ‘punish
by criminal sanctions.” Toussie, 397 U'S. at 114. “Such a limitation is designed to protect
individuals from having to defend themselves against charges when the basic: facts may: have
become obscured by the passage of time and to: minimize the danger of official punishment
because of acts:in the -far-distant:past.” /d. at 114-15.

[T]he court's first task is to. determine whether Congress ‘has expressly prescribed.

the statute’s proper reach. If Congress has done so, of course, there: is no need to

resort to judicial default rules. When, however, the statute contains no such

express command, the court must determine whether’ the new statute’'would: have

retroactive effect, ie., whether it would impair. rights a party-possess¢d when he

acted, increase a party's: liability for past conduct, or impose ‘new duties with,

respect to transactions already completed. If the: statute would. operate:

retroactively, our‘traditional presumption, teaches that :it'does:not govern absent:

clear congressional, intent ‘favoring such a.result:
Landgraf, 51.1U.S. at.280. Thus, if Congress has “expressly prescribed” that a statute-will or
will ‘not apply retroactively, the inquiry ends; if not, the court proceeds 'to the second step to
determine whether'the. application of the statute would have impermissible “retroactive cffect.”

As ‘shown below, retroactive application of the 2003 Amendment fails both steps of: the

Landgraf analysis. Regarding step one, not only did Congress fail.to include an.express
