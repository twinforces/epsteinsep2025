The defendant’s demand-that'she and her counsel be permitted to: name any individuals who have
ever: publicly identified, themselves asa victim of cither Epstein or the defendant. in any “public
fora,” and at-any time, without limitation, is extraordinarily broad, unnecessary, and inappropriate,
and should be denied.

AS an initial matter, there can, be no serious question that there are significant: privacy and.
victim interests at. issue here, which the Government;Proposed Order seeks to protect. Particularly’
in. the context.of victim withesses, there are compelling reasons to limit:public disclosure of victim,
identitics and other sensitive information. Indeed, the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, 18 U-S.C. §
3771.,, requires. district courts to implement procedures to ensure that crime victims are: accorded,
among, other rights, “[t]he right‘to be reasonably protected. from the accused,” in addition to “t]he:
right. to be treated ‘with fairness. and ‘with respect for the victim’s dignity and. privacy.” Id. §§
(a)(1), (a)(8) (emphasis added). Moreover, “the public generally has.a, strong interest:in, protecting
the identiti¢s of. . . victims so’that other victims will not. be deterred from:reporting. such crimes?”
United Statés %. Paris, 2007 WL 1484974, at *2 (D. Conn. .May'18, 2007).

Moreover, and consistent. with those interests, courts in this. Circuit. have ‘routinely
acknowledged. the need. to ‘protect: victim-witness identitics. See, e.g.,. United States v. Corley,
13. Cr. 48 (AJN), 2016 WL 9022508, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2016) (“Because Corley’s minor
victims have significant privacy and safety interests at stake, while Corley’s interests, are, minimal,
the Court finds. good. ‘cause: to modify the protective ‘order. in this ‘case: to ‘prevent Corley from.
Icarning the surnames of the minor’ victims. 5, United States y. Kelly , O7 Cr. 374. (SJ), 2008 WL
5068820, at *2.(E.D.N.¥. July 10, 2008) (“Given the potentially explicit:nature of the g government.
witnesses’ expected testimony; the g government argues that: it:is necessary to conceal their identity’
to‘protect ‘them. from public humiliation. and cmbarrassment. This Court agrecs. Thus, the partics
[. . .] are hereby: prohibited. from: releasing to anyone, including members. of'the. press, the identity.
‘or any identifying information, of the government’s witnesses. ”). It is ‘similarly routine in this
District. for’partics in a.criminal case’ to ‘refer to witnesses by pscudonyms (such as “Victim-1” or
“Witness-1"’) to protect the privacy interests of third parties unless and until they testify:publicly..

The Government’s proposed order ‘endeavors to protect those interests by gencrally
requiring the partics to abstain ‘from identifying any’ yictim. by:, name in, any: public statement or
filing while also ensuring that. the defendant. and. her counsel are fully, able to prepare for trial.
Indeed, to facilitate the defendant’s investigation, and preparation. for trial, the Government’s
‘proposal makes clear that defense: Counsel and défense staff; including défense investigators,
should. :not ‘be prohibited from referencing ‘identitics of individuals ‘in. conversations: with.
prospective: witnesses, so.long as'those witnesses and their. counscl. abstain. from further disclosing
or disseminating any. such identities. See Government Proposed. Order 4/5. The terms of the
Government’s proposed. order also would, permit defense counsel. to refer to’ any individual by.
name in any filing under seal, merely requiring redaction of identifying information, or the use of
a. pscudonym, in public filings. The Government’ further ‘proposes that defense counsel not be
prohibited. from. publicly referencing individuals who have spoken—or who at. some: future time

‘or deletes language in. furtherance of its desire’to publicly reference: victim. identities in. defense:
paragraphs 7, 9, and 17 (which are Government Proposed Order paragraphs 6, 7, and 16).
