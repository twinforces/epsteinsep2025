As part of its investigation, OPR examined the
interactions between state officials and the federal
investigators and prosecutors, but because OPR does
not have jurisdiction over state officials, OPR did not
investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct
regarding the state investigation.’ Because OPR’s
mission is to ensure that Department attorneys adhere
to the standards of professional conduct, OPR’s inves-
tigation focused on the actions of the subject attorneys
rather than on determining the full scope of Epstein’s
and his assistants’ criminal behavior. Accordingly,
OPR considered the evidence and information regard-
ing Epstein’s and his assistants’ conduct as it was
known to the subjects at the time they performed their
duties as Department attorneys. Additional evidence
and information that came to light after June 30, 2008,
when Epstein entered his guilty plea under the NPA,
did not affect the subjects’ actions prior to that date,
and OPR did not evaluate the subjects’ conduct on the
basis of that subsequent information.

OPR’s investigation occurred approximately 12
years after most of the significant events relating to
the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and
Epstein’s guilty plea. As a result, many of the subjects
and witnesses were unable to recall the details of
events or their own or others’ actions occurring in
2006-2008, such as conversations, meetings, or documents

“In August 2019, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced
that he had directed the Florida Department of Law Enforcement
to open an investigation into the conduct of state authorities
relating to Epstein. As reported, the investigation focuses on
Epstein’s state plea agreement and the Palm Beach County work
release program.
