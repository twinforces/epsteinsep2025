12/14/2020 95 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After
due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The
Court's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three—part test articulated
by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.
2006). Under this test, the Court must: (1) determine whether the documents in
question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law
presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations
against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing factors include
but are not limited to the danger of impairing law enforcement or judicial efficiency’
and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure." Id. at 120 (quoting United
States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1048 (2d Cir.1995) ("Amodeo II")). The proposed
redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant's letter motions are
"relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,'
thereby qualifying as a "judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the
Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995).
And the Court also finds that the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146; see also Nixon v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the redactions are narrowly tailored to properly guard the
privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the Defendant's submission and in the
corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
