12/14/2020 | ORDER as'to Ghislaine. Maxwell: On December 8,'2020, Defendant Ghislaine
‘Maxwell filed her. renewed application for. bail under-seal:with.proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Couit!s December 7;,.2020 Order, See Dkti. No: 89: The.
Government did-not file any opposition to the: Defendant’ $ proposed redactions. After
due ‘consideration, the:Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The:
Court's decision to adopt those redactions ‘is. guided. by the three—part:test, articulated
by" the Second: C ireuit in, Lugosch Vv. Pyramiat C Oz Of Onondaga, ‘435 F.3d.1 10; (24:Cir:

question i ‘are "judicial documents;" (ii) ‘assess the weight. of the common. law
‘presumption. of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations
against the’presumption of access. Id. at, 11920.,"Such countervailing factorsinclude
‘but are‘not.limited to the-danger of i impairing: ‘law enforcement or judicial efficiency’
and ‘the:privacy-interests of ‘those: ‘resisting:disclosure.” Id. at 120 (quoting United
States*v. Amtiodeo, 7.1 F.3d ‘1044, 1048 (2d Cit/1995) ("Amodeo II")). The proposed
‘redactions satisfy this: test. The Court finds that Defendant's letter motions are

"relevant tothe performance: ofthe judicial. function and uscful-in.the. judicial process,’
thereby. qualifying as a "judicial document for purposes of the first element:of:the
‘Lugosch’tést. United States'v. Amodeo (“Amodco, I"), 44. F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir: 1995).
And the Court also ‘finds that.the common law presumption of access attaches. Id. at
146: see also’ ‘Nixon. v. Warner Commce'ns, Inc:, 435'U.S. '589, 602 (1978).
Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations againstthe presumption of
access, the:Court finds that the redactions ate: narrowly’ tailored to-properly guard the
‘privacy interests of the individuals referenced inthe Defendant's submission and. in. the
corresponding exhibits The. Defendant is hereby ORDERED'to: docket:the. redacted
documents and corresponding exhibits. (Signéd by Judge Alison. J. Nathan on
