the other was the more expansive global federal part
of the NPA.

Third, as every circuit recognizes (including the
Second and Seventh), it is a well- settled proposition
that ambiguities in a plea agreement are to be resolved
against the government. See, e.g., In re Altro, 180 F.3d
372, 375 (2d Cir. 1999); United States v. Carmichael,
216 F.3d 224 (2d Cir. 2000) (“[Wle ‘construe plea
agreements strictly against the Government.”) (inter-
nal citation omitted); United States v. O'Doherty, 64
F.3d 209, 217 (7th Cir. 2011); United States v.
Transfiguracion, 442 F.3d 1222, 1229 (9th Cir. 2006).
Annabi, Thompson, and the opinion below flip this
guidepost on its head, holding that a promise of
immunity from prosecution by “the United States” is
to be construed against the defendant. 771 F.2d at 672;
431 Fed. Appx. 492 (App.8).

If it is not in fact clear on its face that the United
States means the United States as a whole, at most
the intent in using this term is ambiguous. Because
such ambiguity is to be resolved in favor of the
defendant and against the government, 180 F.3d at
375, the majority interpretation that the United
States refers to the country as a whole is correct and
the opinion below must be reversed.

C. The available evidence suggests that the
NPA was meant to bind the Southern
District of New York.

Despite the Second Circuit’s conclusion below that
the text and the negotiating history of this NPA
suggest an intent to bind only the Southern District of
Florida, (App.10), the opposite is true.

First, the contractual interpretation principle known
as expressio unius est exclusio alterius compels the
