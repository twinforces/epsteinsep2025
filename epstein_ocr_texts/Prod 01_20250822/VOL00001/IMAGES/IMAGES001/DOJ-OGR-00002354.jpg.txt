Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 134 Filed 02/04/21 Page 7 of 23

To paraphrase Mary McCarthy’s philippic about Lillian Hellman, every word of the
government’s representation was untrue, “including ‘and’ and ‘the.’”! The government knew
what was in the bad provided that information well before the
investigation began. The government did indeed have previous contact with J. And
BE was instrumental in fomenting the Maxwell prosecution.

The record is surpassingly clear: But for the 3 I 7 77
Ds Ver would have permitted the circumvention of the civil Protective
Order, on which Maxwell relied in agreeing to sit for her depositions. This Court therefore has
both the authority and the duty to suppress the fruits of that misrepresentation, including the
Ee 20 the two perjury counts based on those transcripts. If the Court is
disinclined to exercise that inherent authority on the present record, Maxwell should be granted a
hearing to examine the circumstances that resulted in the 7 7
es.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

A. The Protective Order in Giuffre v. Maxwell

Counts Five and Six of the superseding indictment allege that Maxwell committed
perjury during two civil depositions taken in Giuffre v. Maxwell, a civil defamation case Virginia
Giuffre filed in 2015. Giuffre claimed that Maxwell defamed her when Maxwell’s attorney-hired
press agent denied as “untrue” and “obvious lies” Giuffre’s numerous allegations, over the span
of four years, that Maxwell had participated in a scheme to cause Giuffre to be “sexually abused
and trafficked” by Jeffrey Epstein.
