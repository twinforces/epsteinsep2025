APPLICABLE LAW

A. Joinder of Offenses

Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides, in relevant part,
(a) Joinder of Offenses. The indictment or information may charge a
defendant in separate counts with 2 or more offenses if the offenses
charged--whether felonies or misdemeanors or both--are of the same or
similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are
connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.

Rule 8(a) sets forth three different circumstances in which separate offenses may be
properly joined in the same indictment; namely, when the offenses: (1) “are of the same or
similar character,” (2) “are based on the same act or transaction,” or (3) “are connected with or
constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). Although charging
separate offenses in the same indictment and allowing them to be tried together “inevitably
involves some danger of prejudice” to the defendant, Rule 8 permits joinder of offenses in
circumstances where “gains in trial efficiency outweigh the recognized prejudice that accrues to
the accused.” United States v. Turoff, 853 F.2d 1037, 1042-43 (2d Cir.1988); see also United
States v. Werner, 620 F.2d 922, 928 (2d Cir. 1980) (purpose of Rule 8 is to promote “trial
convenience and economy of judicial and prosecutorial resources”); United States v. Halper, 590
F.2d 422, 430 (2d Cir. 1978) (“efficiency and economy” are the “customary justifications for
joinder”).

In conducting a Rule 8(a) analysis, “no one characteristic is always sufficient to establish
‘similarity’ of offenses ... and each case depends largely on its own facts.” United States v.
