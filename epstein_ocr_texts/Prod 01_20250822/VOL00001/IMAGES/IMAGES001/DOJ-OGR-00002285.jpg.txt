A. Joinder of Offenses

Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal.Procedure ‘provides, in:relevant part,

(a) Joinder of Offenses. The indictment or information may. charge a.
defendant in ‘scparate counts with 2 or-more offenses ifthe offenses
charged--whether felonics or'misdemeanors or both--are of the same’ or
similar character, or are based on the same act: or'transaction, or arc’
connected with or constitute parts ofa common scheme or plan.

Rule 8(a).séts forth three different: circumstances in which scparate offenses may be
properly: joined in.the same indictment; namely, when. the offenses: (1) “are of:the same or
‘similar character,” (2) “are based,on the same’ act; or transaction,” or (3) “are :connected, with or
constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). Although charging
involves some danger of prejudice” to, the defendant, Rule 8 permits joinder of offenses, in
circumstances where “gains in trial. efficiency outweigh the recognized prejudice that accrues to
the accused.” United States v. Luroff, 853 F.2d 1037, 1042-43 (2d Cir.1988); see also United
States v. Werner, 620 F.2d 922, 928 (2d, Cir. 1980) (purpose of Rule 8 is. to promote, “trial
convenience and.cconomy of. judicial and prosecutorial resources”); United States v. Halper, 590
F.2d 422,430 (2d ‘Cir. 1978). (“efficiency and economy” are the “customary justifications for,
joinder”).

In. conducting a Rule 8(a).analysis, “no ‘one characteristic is always sufficient.to establish

‘similarity’ of offenses ... and each case depends largely on its own facts.” United States 'v.
