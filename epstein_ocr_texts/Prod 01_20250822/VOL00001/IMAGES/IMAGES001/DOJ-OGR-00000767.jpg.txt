It is obviously impossible for two people to conduct a decades-long sex-trafficking enterprise
involving thousands of victims without other individuals who participated in and facilitated these
unspeakable atrocities.

The recent controversy surrounding the Government’s decision to withhold information
conceming Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective. Ms.
Farmer is thankful for the Court’s invitations to state the victims’ positions, and supports the
unsealing of the grand jury transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with
redactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.
Transparency is critical to justice, and the public has a legitimate interest in understanding the full
scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused lasting harm to
others. While it was not the victims’ decision to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts alone
(as opposed to the much larger volume of information available in the “more than 300 gigabytes
of data and physical evidence” in the Government’s possession that should be disclosed as well),
the instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s and
Maxwell’s crimes.

In this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the
conscience of the public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns about the
failures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.
Unsealing the grand jury transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,
provide additional insight into those who enabled his abuse, and bring light to how these crimes
were investigated and prosecuted. While grand jury secrecy serves important purposes, it is not
absolute and under these circumstances the balance tilts in favor of disclosure.

1. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, the

Unsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.

The Second Circuit has recognized that there are special circumstances when the release
of grand jury records is appropriate based on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries
they empanel and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in evaluating whether disclosure is
appropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 102, 104 (2d Cir. 1997). In Craig, the Second
Circuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court may consider when deciding
whether “special circumstances warrant the release of grand jury transcripts. /d. at 106. We join
the Government’s arguments for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein Dkt No. 66, at 3-7.
Two factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position in favor of unsealing.
or commutation of her sentence. The victims of her crimes unequivocally object to any potential
leniency that the Government may be considering offering Maxwell, a convicted sex trafficker.
