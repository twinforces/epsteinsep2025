It:is obviously impossible for two people to conduct, a decades-long sex-trafficking enterprise
involving thousands of victims without other individuals, who participated in. and facilitated these
unspeakable atrocities.

The recent; controversy surrounding the Government’s decision, to withhold information,
conceming Epstcin’s arid, Maxwell’s crimes has largely ignored the victims’ perspective. Ms.
Farmer is thankful. for the Court’s: invitations to state the victims’ ‘positions, ‘and. supports the:
unscaling of the ‘grand jury transcripts, aswell as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with
redactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenesses, and identifying information.
‘Transparency is critical to justice, and.the:public has a legitimate interest in ‘undérstanding the ‘full
scope of Epstcin’s and Maxwell’s: crimes, particularly where-those actions: caused lasting harm to
others. Whileit.was noéthe victims’ decision to seck disclosure of the grand jury transcripts.alone
(as opposed to the much larger volume of information. available in the “more than. 300 gigabytes
of data and, physical cvidenee” in:the Government’s possession. that should be disclosed as well),
the instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude: and abhorrence: of Epstein’s and.
Maxwell’s crimes.

In. this case that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme ‘that shocked. the
conscience of the public, caused. lasting harm to survivors, and raised credible concerns. about the
failures of institutional accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.
Unsealing the grand. jury ‘transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstéin’s and Maxwell’s abuse,
provide additional. insight into those who enabled his abuse, and. bring light to how these crimes
were investigated and prosceuted. ‘While grand.jury secrecy:serves important purposes, it is not
absolute and under these ‘circumstances ‘the: balance tilts in, favor of disclosure.

1. Given the Magnitude and Abhorrence of. Epstein’s: and Maxwell’s. Crimes, the
Unsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.

The Second, Circuit has ‘recognized that there are: special circumstanees ‘when. the release:
of grand jury records ‘is appropriate: based on the:courts’ supervisory authority Over the grand juriés
they: cmpanel. and. that the trial :court has “wide discretion .... in evaluating whether. disclosure is
appropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, 13.1 F.3d 99, 102,104 (2d.Cir. 1997). In, Craig, the Second.
Circuit outlined ‘a,‘non-exclusive list..of factors, that: a trial, court may consider when deciding’
whether “spceial. circumstances; warrant the release. of grand jury transcripts. /d. at'.06. We join.
the Government’s arguments for unsealing ‘under the Craig factors, :pstein. Dkt No. 66, at. 3-7.
Two factors warrant.additional, discussion in light of the victims” position, in favor of unscaling.

‘or. commutation, of her:sentence. The victims of her crimes unequivocally object to any potential,
leniency that the Government may be considering offering Maxwell, .a, convicted sex trafficker.
