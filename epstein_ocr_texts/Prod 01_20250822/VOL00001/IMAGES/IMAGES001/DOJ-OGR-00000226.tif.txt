4-12. In 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl com-
plained to the Palm Beach police after learning that Ep-
stein had paid their daughter for a massage. Pet. App.
94a. The following year, a state grand jury indicted Ep-
stein for soliciting prostitution. Jbzd. But because the
local police “were dissatisfied with the State Attorney’s
handling of the case and believed that the state grand
jury’s charge did not address the totality of Epstein’s
conduct, they referred the matter to the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation (FBI) in West Palm Beach.” Jbzd.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District
of Florida (Florida USAO) worked with the FBI “to de-
velop a federal case against Epstein.” Pet. App. 94a. “[I]n
the course of the investigation, they discovered additional
victims.” Jbid. An Assistant U.S. Attorney drafted a 60-
count indictment against Epstein and a “lengthy memo-
randum summarizing the evidence” against him. /d. at
94a-95a. In 2007, however, the Florida USAO entered
into a written nonprosecution agreement (NPA) with
Epstein. Jd. at 5a, 24a-38a.

The NPA began by describing the state and federal
investigations into Epstein’s conduct and the potential
federal charges that the investigation by the Florida
USAO and FBI supported. Pet. App. 24a-25a. The agree-
ment noted that Epstein sought “to resolve globally his
state and federal criminal liability.” Jd. at 25a. It then
provided:

[OJ]n the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United

States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida,

prosecution in this District for [the federal] offenses

shall be deferred in favor of prosecution by the State

of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the fol-

lowing conditions and the requirements of this Agree-

ment set forth below.
