I have the honor to inform you that Article 696-2 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure
provides that France can extradite "any person not having French nationality,” it being specified that
nationality is assessed on the day of the commission of the acts for which extradition is requested
(Article 696-4 1°).

The French Code of Criminal Procedure therefore absolutely prohibits the extradition of a
person who had French nationality at the time of the commission of the acts for which extradition is
requested.

The penal law being of strict interpretation, there is no reason to discriminate between
nationals and binationals. From the moment they were French at the time of the facts, the person
claimed is inextradible, regardless of whether they hold one or more nationalities.

When the refusal to extradite is based on the nationality of the requested person, France
applies the principle "aut tradere, aut judicar" according to which the State which refuses the
surrender must judge the person. Thus, Article 113-6 of the Penal Code gives competence to the
French courts to judge acts committed abroad by a person of French nationality.

Some countries, generally under Anglo-Saxon law, agree to extradite their nationals and, at the
same time, have no jurisdiction to judge acts committed by their nationals on foreign territory. This is
particularly the case of the United States of America.
