See Warmé, 2009 WL 427111, at *2 (ordering government to ‘disclosé identity’ of sex. crime
victim where “the government. has not: demonstrated ‘that disclosing; the identity to the defendant
would. subject the victim to a significant risk, or to increase the likelihood that victim will. refuse
to appear or'testify”).

With each day that passes without. knowing the identities of Victims 1-3, thé défense is
losing crucial.time to conduct a meaningful. investigation and prepare: its defense :so that. Ms.
Maxwell can. receive a fair trial on. the schedule set by the Court; For these reasons, ‘we:
respectfully request the Court to. order the government-to disclose the identities of Victims 1-3 to
defense counsel, consistent:with the provisions of the protective order.

2. Ms. Maxwell’s Conditions of Confinement and. Access to Discovery:

We also seek-the Court’s ‘assistance to improve Ms. Maxwell’s conditions, of confinement.
at the Metropolitan. Detention Center (“MDC”), and her access to the discovery in. this case, so
that shé can méaningfullyparticipate in her défense. As discussed. bélow, Ms. Maxwell has been
treated less favorably than.a typical. pretrial detainee, and this has impacted her ability to assist in.
her defense..

It has become apparent that the BOP’s treatment. of Ms. Maxwell ‘is a reaction to the.
circumstancés surrounding the prétrial détention and death :of Mr. Epstein. Oni July'6, 2019, Mr.
Epstein. was -arrested. and. detained. at the Metropolitan Correctional ‘Center (MCC ”Y on sex
trafficking charges, and was subsequently assigned to the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”)
due to risk factors ‘for suicide and safety concerns. After an, apparent suicide attempt on July 23,
2019, Mr. Epstein was ‘transferred to suicide watch. and then. psychological observation. On,
August 10, 2019, Mr. Epstein’s body was discovered in his, cell. Theréafter, the government’
indicted the two correctional. officers. who were assigned to. the SHU at the time of Mr. Epstein’s
death..

As a result of'what occurred ‘with ‘Mr. ‘Epstein, Ms. Maxwell is being treated worse: than.
Other sitilarly’ situatéd pretrial. detainees, which significantly impacts. hér ability'to prépare a
defense. aiid be ready for trial on the schedule set by the Court. Siiice. arriving at the MDC over 4.
month ago, on July:6, 2020, Ms. Maxwell has been held under‘uniquely onerous conditions. Ms.
Maxwell has ‘been confined alone in an.area outside of the general population for the entire 36-
day: period (40 days if we! include; her confinement ‘in. New. Hampshire), which, is over three
‘weeks longer than the 14-day quarantine period required for all. new arrivals to the MDC under:
current. GOVID-19 protocols, aiid there is no indication. that this will change. She. continues. to
be surveilled.24 hours.a. day by security cameras and. by multiple: prison guards, many of whom.
do not appear to be regular, MDC personnel. These prison guards ‘constantly observe ‘Ms.
Maxwell and take notes on, her every activity, including her phone conversations with defense.
counsel. Until recently, Ms.. Maxwell was subjected to suicide watch, protocols, including being’
woken.up évery few hours during ‘the night and being ‘forced to wear special clothing, déspite the
