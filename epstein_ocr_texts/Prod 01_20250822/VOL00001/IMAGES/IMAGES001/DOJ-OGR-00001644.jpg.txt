referenced in the discovery and, guard against prejudicial prétrial publicity, while still ensuring:

‘Legal Standard

Where the government Seeks ‘to, curtail. thé use of. pretrial. discovery, Rule :16(d)() of the
Federal ‘Rules of Criminal Procedure requires wat it: “show good cause for the issuance of a.
protective order.” Wnited States: v, Annabi, No. 10 Cr. 7 (CM), 2010 WL. 1253221, at *1.
(S-D.N-Y. Mar. 24, 20.10). ‘To establish that good cause ‘exists ‘for proposed, restrictions, in ‘a,
protective order, the government.'must show that. disclosure will cause “a clearly defined and.
serious injury.” United States ¥. Wecht, 484 F.3d 194, 2.11. (3d Cir. 2007). A finding of harm.

“must: ‘be based .on a particular. factual demonstration of potential ‘harm, not on conclusory
statements.” United States v. Gangi, 1998 WL, 226196, at *2 (S.DIN.Y. May 4, 1998) (citations
and. internal quotations omitted). “Broad. allegations of harm, unsubstantiated by specific.
examples or articulated reasoning, do not support a good. case.showing.” Wecht, 484 F.3d at.
211.

Courts must be careful not to:impose a protective order that is “broader than is necessary”
to accomplish its goals. Wnited States v. Lindh, 198 F. Supp. 2d 739, 742 (E.D. Va. 2002)
(citation, and ‘internal quotation ‘marks omitted). Thus, courts are ‘instructed, to “weigh. the.
impact” of requested protections and their extent against’ a defendant’s. “due ‘process, right to
prepare and present a full defense at trial.” Jd.

Discussion.

1. Restrictions on Use of Discovery Materials.

The government, and the. defense agree that the ‘protective order should include a
restriction prohibiting Ms. Maxwell and defense counsel from (1) ‘using discovery: materials “for
any civil proceeding or any purpose” other than. defending’ or preparing for this. criminal. action:
or (ii) posting ;discovery:materials on the. Internet, See Ex. A Ff ‘L(a), 5. The defense’s proposed
protective order would. make ‘those same restrictions applicable to’ potential. government
witnesses. and their counsel so that they are on equal footing with the defense. See Ex.,A.ff 3, 5.
The government. has indicated ‘that; it cannot agree’ to:such.a restriction, despite acknowledging
that it. will very likely share discovery ‘materials with those individuals during the course of trial
préparation.

many’ of: the government’ s ‘potential witnesses. “Moreover, numerous potential ‘witnesses and.
their counsel have already made public statements about. this case ‘to the media ‘since Ms.
Maxwell’s arrest. Theré is a substantial concern. that thése individuals. will séek to’use discovery
materials to’ support: their civil.cases and future public statements. It: is therefore: vital ‘that: the
government’s potential witnesses and. their counsel be subject: to the same restrictions as Ms.
