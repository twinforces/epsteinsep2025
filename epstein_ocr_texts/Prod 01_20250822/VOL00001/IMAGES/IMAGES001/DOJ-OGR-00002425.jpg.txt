2. The Second. Question: “List all of the people under the age of 18 that
you interacted with atany of Jeffrey’s properties?”

The second “question” was equally improper. First, this is not.a question. Rather, itis a
demand to do something, make a list. Fed. R.. Civ: P. 30(a)(1) limits a deposition to, “oral.
questions.” The:question was grossly ambiguous: who was “Jeffrey”; what were: “Jeffrey’s
properties;” to-what time frame ‘did'the question apply; what; was the basis for Ms. Maxwell to
déterminé, who may or may'not have been. “urider 'the age, of 18”; and'what did. “interact*with”
mean?

Again, the Government'selectively omits objections, context, and relevant; colloquy. This

series of questions begins at page 382 of the April 2016 deposition:
