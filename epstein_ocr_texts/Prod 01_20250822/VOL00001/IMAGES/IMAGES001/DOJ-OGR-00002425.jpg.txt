2. The Second Question: “List all of the people under the age of 18 that
you interacted with at any of Jeffrey’s properties?”

The second “question” was equally improper. First, this is not a question. Rather, it is a
demand to do something, make a list. Fed. R. Civ. P. 30(a)(1) limits a deposition to “oral
questions.” The question was grossly ambiguous: who was “Jeffrey”; what were “Jeffrey’s
properties;” to what time frame did the question apply; what was the basis for Ms. Maxwell to
determine who may or may not have been “under the age of 18”; and what did “interact with”
mean?

Again, the Government selectively omits objections, context, and relevant colloquy. This
series of questions begins at page 382 of the April 2016 deposition:
