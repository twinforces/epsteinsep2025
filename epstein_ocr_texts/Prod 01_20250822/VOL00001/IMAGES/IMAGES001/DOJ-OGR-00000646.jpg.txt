the court's responsibility, and manifestly within its, purview,

to ensure that. the victims in this case are treated fairly and

with dignity.

The fundamental substantive principle which applies in

considering the government's motion iS térmed ‘the rule of
abatement. This principle originated in the English commen
law. It was ddopted by most U.S. federal, courts, but more
recently, it has faced some appropriate criticism, The rule of
abdtément iS best explained ‘in the Second Circuit case of

U.S. v. Wright...

In that Wright case, two defendants Had pled guilty to
embezzlement and tax evasion. Both defendants appealed, but
one of thé defendants diéd while His appeal was pending in the

Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals mule that under the mule

of abateniént, the judgment of Convittioh against the deceased
defendant was required to be vacated and the indictment was to
be dismissed. The Wright court held that when a Gohvicted
defendant dies while his direct appeal as of right ds pending,
his déath abates not 6nly the appeal, but also précesdings had
during the course of, the prosecution.

The Sécond Circuit in¢identally Has also held that
when a criminal conviction, abates upon, the death of a

défeéendant, any restitution ordered as a result of that

conviction must also abate, and it is al'so ruled the same with

respect to associated forfeiture orders.
