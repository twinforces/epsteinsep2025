In the face of the Epstein’s, death on the BOP’s watch, the MDC would not risk a'repeat
of the debacle that occurred in the MCC. There can be ‘no doubt that the MDE was following
directives from Attorney General William Barr and the Director of'the BOP in determining that
Ms. Maxwell should:not be placed :in general. population, not Ms. Maxwell. Regardless, the
MDC would'never risk security to Ms. Maxwell or the institution by placing her in gencral
population, knowing‘ the difficultics it;would face in protecting Ms. Maxwell from, assault and.
extortion, by ‘other inmates given that they:do not protect her from physical abuse by: guards. ‘But
that decision. docs not justify the degree to which.the: MDC .overmanages Ms. Maxwell's
‘detention and its detrimental cffeet on. her health, well-being, and ability‘ to prepare for trial.

We have repeatedly expressed. our:concern, for Ms. Maxwell’s health andthe impact her
conditions of confinement are having on her health and well-being, her ability to prepare for
trial, and the overall impact the severe conditions will have on, her stamina to withstand.trial,
which we moved to the fall. With cach. passing day, it becomes: increasingly more obvious that.
Ms. Maxwell’s extreme conditions of detention will not, be improved.and health deteriorate

commensurate with the unprecedented conditions of confincment-unparalleled in the MDC.

Very truly yours,
