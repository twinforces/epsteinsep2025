‘investigations. There is ‘the investigation of our client and
there is the investigation ‘of Mr. Epstein, And they are, in
the government's words, ‘in our words together, voluminous,
materials. We haven't seen any of at yet, but voluminous,

including ‘voluminous electronic materials. The notion, that we

would be able to in any meaningful way review these with our

client to prepare ‘the case for motion and for ‘trial under 'the

current pandemic situation is just not realistic, It is not
meaningful. It is het fair. Ahd I should say, aS your Hdénor
noted, in the Stephens case, we ane not faultang the Bureau of

Prisons; We dré not faulting the Marshal Service. We

understand they are doing the best they can under ‘the
circumstances. But this is just not realistic. We have

conduct that's alleged to be 25 years old. You have extensive

discovery that's going to take the government, if they hit the

deadlines your Honor set. -- and, we all know that. sometimes jit
doesn't happen == four and a Half months to provide, and the
government. wants our client to remain in custody that whole
time, without. being able to meet with us in person, with
limited access in some form of administrative seg., apparent.ly

bécause they dré afraid of what happened with Mr. Epstein, I

don't know, and it Js just mot a realastic way to prepare a

case, particularly, your Honor, when; as we submit, the

eonditions and combination of conditions to secure her release

can be satisfied here under your Honor's guidance.
