1. Ms. Maxwell’s Personal History and Characteristics
Demonstrate That She Is Not a Flight Risk
a. Ms. Maxwell Has No Prior Criminal Record, and Has
Significant Ties to the United States and the New York Region
Ms. Maxwell’s history and characteristics do not “strongly support detention,” as the
government contends (Gov. Mem. at 6), but instead demonstrate that she is firmly rooted in
this country and that her appearance can be reasonably assured with appropriate bail
conditions. Ms. Maxwell has no criminal record, which includes the approximately twenty-
five-year period from the time the conduct alleged in the indictment took place to the
present. Ms. Maxwell also has significant ties to the United States. She has lived in this
country for almost 30 years and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2002. Ms. Maxwell
also has strong family ties to this country. Two of her sisters, who have agreed to co-sign
her bond, live in the United States, and they have several children who are U.S.-bom
citizens. Ms. Maxwell is very close with her sisters and maintains regular contact with
them, as well as with her nieces and nephews. Ms. Maxwell also has numerous close
friends and professional colleagues who reside in this country. In sum, the United States has
been Ms. Maxwell’s home for decades.
b. Ms. Maxwell Has Actively Litigated Civil Cases in this District
and Has Not Left the United States Since Epstein’s 2019 Arrest
Ms. Maxwell has never once attempted to “hide” from the government or her
accusers, and has never shown any intent to leave the country. To the contrary, Ms.
Maxwell has always vehemently denied that she was involved in illegal or improper conduct
related to Epstein, and her conduct has been entirely consistent with someone who fully
intends to remain in this country and fight any allegations brought against her. For example,
since 2015, and continuing through today, Ms. Maxwell has actively litigated several civil
