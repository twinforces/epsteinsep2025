that the defendant-has had difficulty opening on the MDC computer system.* Because those ¢fforts
are already underway and remain ongoing, there:is no need. for.an order directing them.

Second, the Defense Letter complains about: issucs, within the MDC that are not. in, the
Government’s control, but;that:the Government has nevertheless spent significant'time addressing’
at the defense’s behest. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). MDC legal counsel has informed the Government ‘that.
MDC staff has been instructed ‘to allow defense :counsel ‘to pass. papers to their client for her to
revicw during visits. Accordingly; there is no.need for an, order to. address this issue. MDC legal.
counsel. also noted that the table in the attorney visiting room is equipped. with a. Plexiglas barrier
down the middle to preventthe spread of COVID-19. Attorneys and clicnts ‘are required to sition
opposite sides of that barricr forthcir health and safety, but they can-position any laptop they may
be reviewing in such a way’ that both the client and attorneys. can view. it while remaining on.
‘opposite sides. of the table. Finally, the Government understands.from MDG. legal counscl. that the
defendant.has access to’ her discovery for approximately 13 hours per day and therefore receives
more’time to review her discovery‘than any. other inmate in the MDC.

The Government is working expeditiously to mect its obligations and discovery deadlines,
which it takes ‘very seriously. The Government’s primary objective, of course, is to finalize the
produetion, of discovery as quickly .as ‘possible, while also ensuring that its productions. are:
complete. At any ‘point, should the defense have questions, or concerns about; the discovery; the
Government has been and rémains available to discuss any such issues directly with counsel.

Respectfully submitted,

° It is not clear to the Government what documents the defendant is unable to view at:this ‘point,
but to be clear, the technical isstics have, at' their worst; impacted the defendant’s ability to view
only a subset of the: hundreds of thousands of pages produced to:her.. The defense: has: previously.
provided the Government with lists of documents that:the defendant could.not open. In.response,

the Government has sent the defendant replacement productions with:reformatted versions of cach
identified document. after consulting with MDC staff to cnsure that the files would be viewable on
the MDC. computér system. Yesterday, defense counsel informed the Government that the:
‘defendant. still :cannot view ‘certain files, but the defense has. not ‘identified all. of the: specific:
unrevicwable documents. In any event, the Government: will continuc: to ‘work with the: defense
and the MDC to’ensure that the defendant-can review all discovery.
