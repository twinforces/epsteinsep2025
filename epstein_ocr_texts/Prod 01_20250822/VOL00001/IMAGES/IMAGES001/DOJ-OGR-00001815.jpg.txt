that the defendant has had difficulty opening on the MDC computer system.° Because those efforts
are already underway and remain ongoing, there is no need for an order directing them.

Second, the Defense Letter complains about issues within the MDC that are not in the
Government’s control, but that the Government has nevertheless spent significant time addressing
at the defense’s behest. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). MDC legal counsel has informed the Government that
MDC staff has been instructed to allow defense counsel to pass papers to their client for her to
review during visits. Accordingly, there is no need for an order to address this issue. MDC legal
counsel also noted that the table in the attorney visiting room is equipped with a Plexiglas barrier
down the middle to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Attorneys and clients are required to sit on
opposite sides of that barrier for their health and safety, but they can position any laptop they may
be reviewing in such a way that both the client and attorneys can view it while remaining on
opposite sides of the table. Finally, the Government understands from MDC legal counsel that the
defendant has access to her discovery for approximately 13 hours per day and therefore receives
more time to review her discovery than any other inmate in the MDC.

The Government is working expeditiously to meet its obligations and discovery deadlines,
which it takes very seriously. The Government’s primary objective, of course, is to finalize the
production of discovery as quickly as possible, while also ensuring that its productions are
complete. At any point, should the defense have questions or concerns about the discovery, the
Government has been and remains available to discuss any such issues directly with counsel.

Respectfully submitted,

> It is not clear to the Government what documents the defendant is unable to view at this point,
but to be clear, the technical issues have, at their worst, impacted the defendant’s ability to view
only a subset of the hundreds of thousands of pages produced to her. The defense has previously
provided the Government with lists of documents that the defendant could not open. In response,
the Government has sent the defendant replacement productions with reformatted versions of each
identified document after consulting with MDC staff to ensure that the files would be viewable on
the MDC computer system. Yesterday, defense counsel informed the Government that the
defendant still cannot view certain files, but the defense has not identified all of the specific
unreviewable documents. In any event, the Government will continue to work with the defense
and the MDC to ensure that the defendant can review all discovery.
