The history of the Office of the United States
Attorney is instructive as to the scope of their actions
and duties. The Judiciary Act of 1789 created the
Office of the United States Attorney, along with the
office of the Attorney General. More specifically, the
Judiciary Act provided for the appointment, in each
district, of a “person learned in the law to act as
attorney for the United States in such district, who
shall be sworn or affirmed to the faithful execution of
his office, whose duty it shall be to prosecute in such
district all delinquents for crimes and _ offences,
cognizable under the authority of the United States,
and all civil actions in which the United States shall
be concerned.”!® The Judiciary Act thus emphasized
that U.S. Attorneys would enforce the law of the
United States but did not determine that the actions
of one U.S. Attorney could bind other districts, let alone
the entire nation. In fact, the phrase “in such district,”
repeated twice, implies that the scope of the actions
and the duties of the U.S. Attorneys would be limited
to their own districts, absent any express exceptions.

Since 1789, while the number of federal districts has
grown significantly, the duties of a U.S. Attorney and
their scope remain largely unchanged. By statute, U.S.
Attorneys, “within [their] district, shall (1) prosecute
for all offenses against the United States; (2) prosecute
or defend, for the Government, all civil actions, suits or
proceedings in which the United States is concerned.””
Again, the scope of the duties of a U.S. Attorney is
