‘Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 36o0f74 36

And, two, again, without getting into in any way of
appreciating the gravity of these charges, the government.
writes on page 2 of its stlbmission, this was not a case —-

agdin, putting the age of thesé witnessés dnd putting the

offenders that are the subyjéct of the fFesearch that. yotir Honor
is accessing.

MR. WEINBERG: I know that because --

THE COURT: You may ‘say, he's my elient, and I know
he's a good fellow and all that..

MR. WEINBERG: I acttially do think that if he was

the state authorities were conducting an investigation.

Lt. was an intensive investigation. Jt led in 2006 to

the, U.S. Attorney's investigation that itself was intensive.

Thére were grand jury Subpoénas. Theré was an enormous amount.
