contract arising out of commercial negotiations among private parties, we believe the court did
not correctly apply the standards that govern the interpretation of plea agreements with the

participated in the negotiation of the NPA, and there is evidence that the USAO-SDFL consulted
with the USAO for this District in its investigation. SDFL Privilege Log at 4, 5, 7. This
information could be confirmed through discovery.

Media reports regarding the November 2020 OPR report further support Ms. Maxwell’s
position. Only the executive summary of the OPR report was released to the public, and the
