additional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth
posted by the security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were
granted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At the initial hearing, the

the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the
benefit of the Defendant for the period stemming from 2015 to 2020. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.

report.

But even assuming that the financial report provides an accurate analysis of the
Defendant’s finances, the Court is unpersuaded by her argument that the bail package reasonably
assures her appearance. As the Government argues, the bail package would leave unrestrained
