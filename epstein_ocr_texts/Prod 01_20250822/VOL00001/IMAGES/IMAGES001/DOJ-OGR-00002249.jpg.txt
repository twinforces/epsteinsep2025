and secured, by ‘approximately $8 million ‘in. property and $500,000 in, cash, along with, six,
additional bonds—five co-signed by the Defendant’s ‘fricnds and. family:members andthe sixth.
posted by the security:company: that would provide security serviccs to the Defendant ifshe were
granted bail and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. At-the initial, hearing, the
‘Court noted that:the: opaqueness of the Defendant’s finances rendered it difficultto set. financial
bail conditions that,could reasonably assure her appearance in court. The financial information,
that the Defendant presented to the Court at the initial bail hearing was undisputedly incomplete,
and.as the Court:noted, the Court: lacked.“a.clear picture of Ms. Maxwell’s finances and the
resources available to her.” ‘Tr. .at-86—-87.

The Defendant has now presented’to the Court what is perhaps .a more thorough report on,
her finances prepared-by ‘Macalvins, an, accounting firm in the United Kingdom. Macalvins
analyzed the Defendant’s assets and finances for the past five years, basing its analysis on,
among other things, bank. statements, tax returns, and FBAR. filings, providing a summary of
the assets held by the Defendant and her spouse as well as the assets held in trust for the
bénefit of the; Défendant for the period stemming from 2015 to.2020. See Def. Mot., Ex. O.
In addition, the Defendant retained a Certified Fraud. Examiner and a former IRS. Special
Agent, who reviewed.the Macalvins report,and the underlying documents and determined that
‘report. accurately represents the assets held, by. the Defendant and. her spouse. See Def. Mot., Ex.
P. The: Defendant’s new bail:proposal. is based on the numbers derived. from.the:Macalvins
‘report:

But'cven assuming that the financial. report provides an. accurate analysis. of the.
Defendant’s finanecs, the Court is unpersuaded by: her argument'that’the bail, package reasonably

assures, her:appearance. As the Government: argues, the bail package would.leave unrestrained.
