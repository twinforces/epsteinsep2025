Mr. Epstein diéd, when, there had béen no convictiion.

So that's just some background. L wanted to share with
yous At this point ‘in ‘tame, I would liké 'to turn ‘to the
gevernment. prosecutors to hear from them in support of their
RUlLeé 48 application to dismiss ‘the Epstein indictment.

MS. COMEY: Thank. you, your Honor.

Would ‘you, like me to dddréss ‘the Gourt from the
podium?
THE COURT: If you wouldn't mind.

MS. COMEY: Thank. you, your Honor.

I believe your H6nor has. accurately summarized the
eléar Second Circuit law, that upén the déath of a defendant
before a final, entry of a judgment of conviction, all.
proceedings must be abated.

In light of that. clean law, the government is legally
obligated to seek dismissal of the pending indictment against.
Jeffrey Epstein, and we respectfully submit, likewise, that the
entry of the propdésed ordér is similarly required by law.

A few notes to make about that, though, your Honor.
TO be very cléar, dismissal of this indictment as to Jeffrey.
Epstein in no way prohibits or inhibits the government's

ongoing investigation inht6 other potential coégonhspirdators, nor

does it prevent the bringing of a new case in the future or the

prosecution of new defendants.
