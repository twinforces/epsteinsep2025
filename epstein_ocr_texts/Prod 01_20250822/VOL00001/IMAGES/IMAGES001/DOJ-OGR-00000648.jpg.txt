1 Mr. Epstein died, when there had been no conviction.

2 So that's just some background I wanted to share with
3 you. At this point in time, I would like to turn to the

4 government prosecutors to hear from them in support of their

5 Rule 48 application to dismiss the Epstein indictment.

6 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.

7 Would you like me to address the court from the

8 podium?

9 THE COURT: If you wouldn't mind.

10 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.

11 I believe your Honor has accurately summarized the

12 state of the law, as set forth in our papers, in light of the
13 clear Second Circuit law, that upon the death of a defendant

14 before a final entry of a judgment of conviction, all

15 proceedings must be abated.

16 In light of that clear law, the government is legally
17 obligated to seek dismissal of the pending indictment against
18 Jeffrey Epstein, and we respectfully submit, likewise, that the
19 entry of the proposed order is similarly required by law.
20 A few notes to make about that, though, your Honor.
21 To be very clear, dismissal of this indictment as to Jeffrey
22 Epstein in no way prohibits or inhibits the government's
23 ongoing investigation into other potential coconspirators, nor
24 does it prevent the bringing of a new case in the future or the
25 prosecution of new defendants.
