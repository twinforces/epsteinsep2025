alleged exclusion, here (c.g. people‘moving) is an external force.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658.
Accordingly, this argument must be-rejected under Rioux.'° See id.

In sum, Schulte cannot establish the second. and third elements under Duren.
Accordingly, his fair cross-section challenge under the Sixth Amendment anid JSSA must be
rejected.

II. Eqiial Protection Challenge

Schulte:next contends that the underrepresentation of African American and Hispanic
American. jurors violates the Equal Protection clause ‘urider the Fifth Amendment. (Schulte Br, at’ .
from grand ‘and petit juries. Castaneda, 430.U.S. at'492. But to.establish a prima facie violation
of equal protection, Schulte: must furnish “proof of discriminatory intent.” United States v.
Biaggi, 909 F.2d 662, 677 (2d Cir. 1990). Because.Schulte cannot make such a.showing, his

‘underrepresenitation of African Americans ‘and Hispanic Americans “cannot be. the result-of

9 Under New. York law, voters are designated “inactive” when,a “County Board received
information indicating’ that.a voter may no longer be living at her address of registration.”
Common Cause/New York. Brehm, 432, F. Supp.3d.285, 290 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (examining New
York voting law).

10 The Céiuit is uripersuaded by ‘Schulte’s remaining allegations of systematic exclusion, which
are that (1) jurors drawn from the overlapping counties were:inequitably prorated between the
two courthouses, and.(2) a technical glitch in the White Plains master wheel excluded jurors who
had. provided an alternative address when régistering to vote. As to the former claim, Schulte has
not showir that this alleged error'caused the undcrrepresentation at issue. See Allen, 2021 WL

43 1458, at.* 14, (finding same error to have had “minima!” effect on-venires). And.as ‘to the latter
claim, the parties concede that this glitch actually augmented, not.diminished, African American
and Hispanic American representation in the White Plains master wheel. (Gov’t Opp. Br. at 17.)
Accorditigly; these allegations do not satisfy the third:prong-under Duren.
