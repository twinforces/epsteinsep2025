determination that the NPA precludes Maxwell’s
prosecution in New York. As the Second Circuit itself
noted, although the co-conspirator clause at issue
here is “silent” as to whether it intended to preclude
co-conspirator prosecution outside the Southern
District of Florida, it is not silent as to whether
Epstein’s future prosecution is limited to the Southern
District of Florida. Instead, “the NPA makes clear that
if Epstein fulfilled his obligations, he would no longer
face charges in that district.” (App.9, emphasis in
original). The use of narrowing terms as to Epstein’s
protections, not but not as to co-conspirator protec-
tions, demonstrates that the difference was inten-
tional. See Scalia & Garner, Reading Law: The
Interpretation of Legal Texts at 167 (“The whole of a
contract is to be taken together, so as to give effect
to every part, if reasonably practicable, each clause
helping to interpret the other.”); Id. at 170 ((“[A]
material variation in terms suggests a variation in
meaning.”). This intent should have been recognized.

Second, the NPA was entered into after extensive
negotiation. The language was hotly contested and
subject to much revision back and forth, including
specifically on the relevant language of the coconspira-
tor clause. (App.95, 108-126). In one of the earlier
drafts, the government proposed language that the
co-conspirator protection would be limited to the
Southern District of Florida. (App.117). Yet the final
draft eliminated the limitation to the Southern
District of Florida and referred only to the United
States. (App.122-24). The OPR report found that gov-
ernment witnesses (who were the only witnesses OPR
spoke to) believed the co-conspirator clause was in-
tended to provide transactional immunity. (App.128-
129). This understanding, supported by the NPA itself
and the negotiation history contained in the one-sided
