involving the sexual or physical abuse of a child under the age of 18 years” could be brought
until the victim reached age 25. 18 U.S.C. § 3283 (1994). While Congress amended the statute
in 2003 to extend the time in which a prosecution could be brought to within the life of the
victim, 18 U.S.C. § 3283 (2003), Accuser-3 reached the age of 25 in a. and thus the
statute of limitations as to her had expired before the time of the amendment. While Ms.
Maxwell contends that § 3283 cannot be applied retroactively at all, and is inapplicable in any
event,’ it is black-letter law that retroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations to
revive a time-barred claim would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Stogner v. California, 539
U.S. 607, 618 (2003). Thus, there can be no prosecution for any conduct alleged as to Accuser-
3.

B. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant to the Alleged

Conspiracies.

According to the indictment, the object of the alleged conspiracies was to entice or cause
one or more individuals to travel in interstate or foreign commerce in order to engage in unlawful
sexual activity. Because, as shown above, the allegations in the indictment are insufficient to
allege such a conspiracy as to Accuser-3, the only individuals as to whom the indictment even
arguably alleges such a conspiracy are Accuser-1 and Accuser-2. The allegations regarding
Accuser-3, however, have nothing to do with any conspiracy as to Accuser-1 or Accuser-2.

While the government couches the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 as “overt acts”
in furtherance of the conspiracies alleged in Counts One and Three, they are not. The “scope of
the conspiratorial agreement” is the key to determining whether “an overt act may properly be
regarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy.” United States v. Benussi, 216 F. Supp. 2d 299,
311 (S.D.N.Y. 2002), aff'd sub nom. United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 608 (2d Cir. 2003)
> See Motion to Dismiss Counts One Through Four of the Indictment as Time-Barred.
