involving the sexual or physical, abuse of a child:under the age of 18 years” could be brought.
until the victim reached age 25. 18.U.S.C. § 3283.(1994).. While ‘Congress amended the statute
in. 2003 to extend:the:time in:which.a prosecution. could be brought-to within:the life:of the
victim, 18 U.S.C. §°3283 (2003), Accuser-3 reached the age of 25 in[ _——_|, and thus the
statuté of limitations as to her had.éxpired, before the time of the ariendment. While Ms.
Maxwell contends that § 3283 cannot’be applied retroactively at all,.and is inapplicable in.any
event,” itis black-letter, law’that‘retroactive: application of a criminal, statute of limitations, to
revive a-time-barréd claim would violate:the iv Post./acto Clause. Stognerv. California, 539

Conspiracies.

According to the indictment, the. object.of the alleged conspiracies was’to entice. or cause
one or:more individuals to’ travel in interstate.or foreign commerce in orderto engage in-unlawful
sexual activity. Because, as shown, above, the allegations. in the indictment; are’ insufficient to
allege such a conspiracy as to Accuser-3, the on/y individuals, as 'to whom thé indictment.éven
arguably alleges such.a conspiracy are Accuser-1 and.Accuser-2. The allegations regarding
Accuser-3, however, have nothing’to do with, any conspiracy: as to Accuser-], or Accuser-2.

While. the governinent couches the allegations regarding Minor Victin-3 as “overt acts”
in, furtherance of the conspiracies alleged in Counts One and Three, they are not. The “scope of
the conspiratorial agreement” is the.key to determining whether “an overt act:may properly be
regarded as.in furtherance ofthe conspiracy:” United States-v. Benussi, 216 F. Supp. 2d 299,

311 (S.D.N.Y..2002), aff'd sub nom. United States’ v. Salmonese, 352 F:3d 608 (2d Cir. 2003)
