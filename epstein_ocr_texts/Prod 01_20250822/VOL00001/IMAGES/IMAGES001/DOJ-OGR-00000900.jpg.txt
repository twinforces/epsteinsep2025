03/23/2021 | 171 | REPLY MEMORANDUM OF LAW in Support as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 160
THIRD MOTION for Bond . . (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 03/23/2021)

03/24/2021 | 172 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard
for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the
ground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3)
provides that "[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of
personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only
by court order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can
move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).
Consistent with the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court
required defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or
confidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also
gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the
subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3). On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter
from the law firm indicating that it can provide notice to alleged victims whose
personal or confidential information may be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm
shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents. In that letter, the law firm
also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm and the alleged victims
it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a motion to quash,
even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive adversarial
briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm shall
enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v.
Ray, No. 20-CR-110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020)
("[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential
information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given notice to the
victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court
will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on grounds
that Nixon was not satisfied."). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the
law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be
narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer
with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the
objections. The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or
before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing
of objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm
may reply within three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation | on this Order).
Counsel shall confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/24/2021)(bw) (Entered:
