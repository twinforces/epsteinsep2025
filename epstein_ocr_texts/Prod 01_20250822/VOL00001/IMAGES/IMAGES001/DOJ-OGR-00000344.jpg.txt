Manhattan, New York’ (the “New' York: Residence”) and. his estate in Palm Beach, Florida.(the
“Palm Beach Residence’ ’). In both. Néw York and.Florida, the: defendant perpetuated this.abuse ‘in
similar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide * “massages” to. the defendant,,;which.
would, be: performed nude or partially nude, would become: increasingly sexual in.nature, and.
would.typically include-one or:more sex acts, including groping and direct-or indirect:contact with
victims” genitals. The defendant paid his victims. hundreds. of dollars ‘in cash for cach scparate
encounter:

worked_with others, including employcés and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors

defendant, both. in NewYork and.in Florida.
