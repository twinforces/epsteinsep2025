BACKGROUND

A. Overview

On July 2, 2019, a federal grand jury in the Southern District of New York returned a sealed
indictment (the “Indictment”) charging the defendant with one count of sex trafficking of minors,
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, and one count of conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of minors,
in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371.

As charged by the grand jury, the facts underlying the charges in the Indictment arise from
a years-long scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. In particular, beginning in at least 2002, the
defendant enticed and recruited dozens of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he
paid the victims hundreds of dollars in cash.

He undertook this activity in at least two different locations, including his mansion in
Manhattan, New York (the “New York Residence’) and his estate in Palm Beach, Florida (the
“Palm Beach Residence”). In both New York and Florida, the defendant perpetuated this abuse in
similar ways. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the defendant, which
would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual in nature, and
would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect contact with
victims’ genitals. The defendant paid his victims hundreds of dollars in cash for each separate
encounter.

Moreover, the defendant actively encouraged certain of his victims to recruit additional
girls to be similarly sexually abused. He incentivized his victims to become recruiters by paying
these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him. In this
fashion, the defendant created a vast network of underage victims for him to exploit, in locations
including New York and Palm Beach.

The defendant’s victims were as young as 14 years old when he abused them. Many of his
victims were, for various reasons, often particularly vulnerable to exploitation. The defendant
intentionally sought out—and knew that he was abusing—minors. Indeed, in some instances, his
victims expressly told him they were underage before or during the period in which he abused
them.

In creating and maintaining a network of minor victims whom he abused, the defendant
worked with others, including employees and associates who facilitated his exploitation of minors
by, among other things, contacting victims and scheduling their sexual encounters with the
defendant, both in New York and in Florida.

B. The Defendant

Jeffrey Epstein designed, financed, and perpetrated this scheme, both as its main participant
and through his direction of others, including certain of his employees, to further facilitate his
rampant abuse of underage girls.
