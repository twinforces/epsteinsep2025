hopes that Mr. Robertson can see them that way.

This is no way to prepare for a trial. The defense team needs to be able to meet with Mr.
Robertson in person, unobstructed by metal bars or a plexiglass barrier, to do the critical and time-
consuming work of reviewing discovery, evidence, and exhibits; discussing trial strategy; and
making the countless decisions which individually and collectively can make the difference
between a verdict of guilty and not guilty. Mr. Robertson’s attorneys also need unobstructed
access to him to build the trust and confidence they need to effectively defend him at trial. They
need to meet with him for as long as they need to, as frequently as they need to, every day if
necessary. They cannot be at the mercy of the jail and its fluctuating visitation policies due to
COVID-19. As the past twelve months have taught us, our prisons and jails are at constant risk of
severe outbreaks, which at times have required multi-week lockdowns to ensure the safety of the
staff and inmates. The defense also cannot be at the mercy of the Court or the United States
Marshals Service because our policies have been in constant flux as well. None of this will provide
Mr. Robertson the opportunity at a fair trial that he deserves and to which he is constitutionally
entitled. Nor can he be made to sit in jail indefinitely, awaiting trial as a legally innocent man,
until it is safe and practically possible for his attorneys to meet with him there. The status quo is
no longer acceptable, and Mr. Robertson’s release is necessary for the preparation of his defense.

IV. The Government Has Not Demonstrated Its Entitlement to Reconsideration or a
Stay.

Finally, the Court is not persuaded by the government’s request for reconsideration or a
stay pending appeal. See Doc. 298. In asking the Court to reconsider its order granting Mr.
Robertson pretrial release, the government represents that it has obtained two new pieces of
information following the pretrial conference at which the Court informed the parties of its release
