APPLICABLE LAW

I. Sixth Amendment

A “representative juty atfay remains the-expression of thé cofmunity’s role in securing”
an impartial trial. Alston v. Manson, 791. F.2d 255, 256 (2d Cir. 1986)., In recognition of that
‘promise, the Sixth. Amendment guarantees a-defendant’ the:right tora jury*venire drawn from.a
fair cross-section of the community.” Taylor'v. Louisiana, 419. U.S. 522, 530 (1975). To
establish a prima facie violation. of the fair:cross-section:requirement, a defendant:must prove
each of the following elements:

(1) That the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community;

(2) That.the-representation of this group in vénires from ‘which, juries are selected.is not
fair and feasoriable.in relation to the numberof such, persons in the community; and

(3) That this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in. the jury-
selection, process.

Duren v. Missouri, 439 U.S. 357; 364 (1979).

Demonstrating a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section réquirement, however, is
not énough to prevail under the Sixth Amétidment. Jd. at367. Under Supreme Court teachings,
“States.remain.fréé to prescribe‘relevant qualifications.for their jurors and to. provide reasonable
exemptions so long as it:may be fairly said that the jury lists or panels aré:representative of the

community.” Jd. (quoting Taylor, 419 U.S. at 538). Accordingly, the Government may rebut the

2-The fair cross-section guarafitée has’ been understood,to apply. in. the context of both grand and.
petit juries. See United States v. Osorio, 801 F. Supp. 966, 973 (D. Conn..1992).
