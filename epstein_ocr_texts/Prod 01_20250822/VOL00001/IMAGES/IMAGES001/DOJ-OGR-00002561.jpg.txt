remains true. ‘even ifthe information is, revealed.on the assumption. that it’will, be used only for a
limited purpose.” Carpenter, 138 S. Ct, at 2216 (quoting United States v. Miller, 425 U.S. 435,

tclephoné—was nota search. By placing calls from his landline, the Court reasoned, Smith
“voluntarily conveyed” the dialed numbers to. the telephone company by “expos[ing] that

the bank statements contained information “exposed to [bank] employees in the ordinary course:
of business,” Miller had only’a. limited expectation, of privacy. 425 U.S. at 442. The Court

information [would]'be conyeyed:by that person,to the Government.” Jd, at 443.
