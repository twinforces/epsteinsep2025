this Honorable: Court:for léave to filé uindeér seal his Supplemental ‘financial disclosure. AS noted in :
Mr: Epstein’s. bail submission, on advicé of coutisel, he has not’yet provided a complete financial :
disclosure. Counsel’s advice-on this point was motivated. by:a desire to. ensure the accuracy and ‘

completeness of the information provided'to the Court, Mr, Epstein seeks leaverto file‘his

forthcoming, supplemental disclosure:under seal. As grounds and reasons therefor, Mr. Epstein-relies:

on the exceptional amount of publicity that has been,gencrated by this cas¢e, much of which relates
specitically'to his finances. Under the Bail Reform,Act, financial information provided by a
defendant to a.pretrial services officer “shall be used only for the purposes ofa bail determination
and shall otherwise be confidential,” 18 U.S.C, §3153(c)(1). Here,.in.the eyent.Mr; Epstein.is
required to-publicly file his financial statement, ‘the information contaiiéd therein will inevitably: be
widely disseminated in the ncws media, contravening the’ statutory requirement.of confidentiality.
