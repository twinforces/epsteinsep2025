1 speaking this morning is Annie Farmer.

2 MS. FARMER: Good morning, your Honor.

3 THE COURT: Good morning.

4 MS. FARMER: Annie, A-n-n-i-e, Farmer, F-a-r-m-e-r.

a I had the opportunity to speak at Jeffrey Epstein's

6 bail hearing, and I really appreciate that you heard me and

7 listened to me that day. I am so sorry that others will not

8 have the opportunity to stand before him the way that I did.

9 But I'm here today to speak on behalf of my sister, Maria

10 Farmer, who could not be here.

11 Jeffrey Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell not only assaulted
12 her, but as we're hearing from so many of these brave women

13 here today, they stole her dreams and her livelihood. She

14 risked her safety in 1996, so many years ago, to report them,
15 to no avail, and it is heartbreaking to her and to me that all
16 this destruction has been wrought since that time.

17 We were deeply disappointed and disturbed by Epstein's
18 death and the fact that that was allowed to happen while he was
19 in the government's custody, and I'm encouraged to hear that
20 there will be a full investigation as to how that was allowed
21 to happen.
22 But it is extremely important, as others are saying,
23 that he did not act alone and that the other people that were a
24 part of what he did are held accountable and that that
25 investigation continues.
