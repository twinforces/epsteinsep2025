‘Prosecution Agrecment] barred prosecution of ‘the federal sexual offenses that Epstein had.
cominitted against Jane Doe tl and.Jane Doe di2 ...”).'° That.is simply not so.

Contrary to Petitioners’ contentions, there has been:no disposition. by the government of
any fedcral. criminal charges ‘against; Epstcin. No federal, charges involving Petitioners. have ever
bech. brought against Epstein, and fio such ‘federal charges have been resolved. ‘The Non-
Prosecution Agreement about which Petitioners complain disposes of no federal criminal,
charges against Epstein, and that agreement docs ‘not bar the United States from. bringing federal
criminal.:charges against Epstein. Instead, when. addressing’ potential federal. criminal charges:
against'Epstein, the USAO-SDFL merely. agreed. in the Non-Prosecution Agreement that:

on the authority’: of R. Alexander Acosta, , United States Attorney’ for the Southern
‘in.favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that. Epstein abides by th the
following: conditions and the requirements of this Agreement set forth below.

and. that;

After timely fulfilling ‘all the terms and. conditions of the Agreement, no
prosecution. for the: offenses sct out on. pages | and.2.of this Agreement, nor any
other offenses that. have been, the subject of the joint investigation by the Federal
Burcau, of Investigation and, the United States Attorney’s Office, nor any offenses
that arose from. the Federal. Grand Jury investigation will be instituted. ti this
District, and the charges. against Epstein if any, will be dismissed.

Thus, the Non-Prosccution Agreement simply: obligated the government ‘not to: prosecute

This Court has also previously described the Non-Prosccution Agreement as “an
agreement.under which ....the U.S. Attorney’s Office would agree ‘not to: prosecute Epstein for:
federal offenses.” DE 99 at.2-3. That description of the Non-Prosecution. Agreement, however,
‘was not based. on. the Court’s. interpretation ofthe terms of the .Non-Prosecution. Agreement, but
was instcad. based on. “allegations” by Petitioners that the: Court concluded were: “not: yet:
supported. by’ evidence” but ‘upon which, the Court. nonetheless relied. “solely. to provide the

context for the threshold issues addressed, in” its September 26, 2011 Order. Jd. at 2:n-.2.
