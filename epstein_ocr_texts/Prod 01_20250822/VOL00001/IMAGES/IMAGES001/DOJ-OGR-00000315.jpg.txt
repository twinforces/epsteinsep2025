Prosecution Agreement] barred prosecution of the federal sexual offenses that Epstein had
committed against Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2....”).'° That is simply not so.

Contrary to Petitioners’ contentions, there has been no disposition by the government of
any federal criminal charges against Epstein. No federal charges involving Petitioners have ever
been brought against Epstein, and no such federal charges have been resolved. The Non-
Prosecution Agreement about which Petitioners complain disposes of no federal criminal
charges against Epstein, and that agreement does not bar the United States from bringing federal
criminal charges against Epstein. Instead, when addressing potential federal criminal charges
against Epstein, the USAO-SDFL merely agreed in the Non-Prosecution Agreement that:

on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern

District of Florida, prosecution in this District for these offenses shall be deferred

in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein abides by the

following conditions and the requirements of this Agreement set forth below.
and that

After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the Agreement, no

prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2 of this Agreement, nor any

other offenses that have been the subject of the joint investigation by the Federal

Bureau of Investigation and the United States Attorney’s Office, nor any offenses

that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this

District, and the charges against Epstein if any, will be dismissed.

Non-Prosecution Agreement at 2 (emphasis added).

Thus, the Non-Prosecution Agreement simply obligated the government not to prosecute

Epstein in the Southern District of Florida for the offenses set forth in the Non-Prosecution

'© This Court has also previously described the Non-Prosecution Agreement as “an
agreement under which .. . the U.S. Attorney’s Office would agree not to prosecute Epstein for
federal offenses.” DE 99 at 2-3. That description of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, however,
was not based on the Court’s interpretation of the terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, but
was instead based on “allegations” by Petitioners that the Court concluded were “not yet
supported by evidence” but upon which the Court nonetheless relied “solely to provide the
context for the threshold issues addressed in” its September 26, 2011 Order. /d. at 2 n.2.
