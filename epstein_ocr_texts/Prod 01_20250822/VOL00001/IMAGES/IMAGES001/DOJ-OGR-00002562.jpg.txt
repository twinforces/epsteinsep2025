Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 140 Filed 02/04/21 Page 14 of 22

Neither Miller nor Smith supports a conclusion that Maxwell had anything but a
legitimate and reasonable expectation of privacy in her I. First, Maxwell did
not “voluntarily convey” x sucd her, not the other way around.
Moreover, Maxwell declined to answer 3

Ren. None of this was voluntary.

Second, Maxwell’s expectation of privacy in her i is not limited in
the way Miller’s expectation of privacy was limited in his bank records. To the contrary, both
Maxwell’s J were confidential under the Protective Order. And while the Protective
Order did not apply to evidence produced at trial, the case settled before trial, thereby confirming
Maxwell’s legitimate expectation that the I would not be shared outside the
attorneys working in the case and, if necessary, the district court.

Third, Maxwell reasonably understood that the yy would not
be shared with the government. Giuffre proposed a law enforcement exception to the Protective
Order’s confidentiality requirement, but Maxwell rejected the exception and the district court
never adopted it. Unlike in Smith and Miller, Maxwell did not “assume the risk” that her
Re ould be divulged to the government.

Had the government obtained the MY from Maxwell’s attorneys, there
would be no question that the government’s conduct would constitute a Fourth Amendment
search. “[C]lients of an attorney maintain a legitimate expectation of privacy in their client files.”
