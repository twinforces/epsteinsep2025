The government’s position would, unfairly: limit; the defense, and goes further. than, is
required to ‘protect, valid privacy interests. More to the point, it does not’ meet. the government's
burden ‘under the law. As. ‘this Court. recently recognized in. Hernandez ¥. Kirby Forensié
Psychiatric Hosp., ‘No. 14- CV- 5910 (AIJN), 2019 WL 4640054 (S. D.N-Y. Sept. 24, 2019), an.
individual’s privacy interest: in. sensitive information is relinquished by: knowing and. intentional
public disclosure. In that case, the’ plaintiff alleged. that hospital, staff violated, his. privacy rights
by disclosing his HIV’ status, fo patients and. other staff. Nevertheless, because the! plaintiff had,
himself, disclosed. his HIV status to the entiré, hospital ‘ward, He “forfeited any’ reasonable
expectation, that this information. would remain. confidential[.]” Jd. at *5; see also In re Avaya,
Inc., ‘No. V7- 10089 (SMB), 2019 WL 1750908, at ie (Bankr, S. D.N.Y. Mar. 28, 201.9) CTA
Smith, Vs “NBC Universal, 524, E Supp. 2d B15, “328- 29 (S. DNY. 2007), (holding that facts
disclosed in'video broadcast on-national television with plaintiffs express. permission “cannot be
considered private”); id. at 1..84 (“There is tio liability when the defendant merely gives further:
publicity to information. about the plaintiff that is already public.”) (quoting Restatement
(Second) of. Torts § 652D cmt. b (1977). The cases that. the government, cites in, its letter are
inapposite, as none addressed ‘the privacy tights of victims and witnesses who had voluntarily:
disclosed their identities to, the public., (Gov: Resp.. at 2.).°

Moreover, the language proposed by the defense will. permit it to conduct a full and
meaningful investigation, upon receiving the discovery, which is required for the effective
assistance’ of counsel. Our client, of course, is. presumed. innocent, and intends. to fight the
charges, against: her. ‘The defense. believes that there are individuals ‘who have’ exculpatory
evidence. concerning I Ms. Maxwell, and information bearing © on . the cea of the, alleged.

z The. government indicates that there may: be: alleged victims. and; witnesses who ‘have-chosen, to. remain: anonymous.
(Goy't! "Resp. at 4). As:reflected:in our proposed order, the :defense’has agreed: not:to, mention ‘publicly the identities
of any’ such, individuals. Instead, to satisfy: its burden,, the government posits. a‘ series, of * “hypothetical, examples”

relating: to. individuals. and, the: type of interactions, they may“have’had,with various public, fora. (Id. ). Hypothetical
cxamples are not a showing of “good cause.” Moreover, ‘the defense cannot address these scenarios without
knowing if they relate to actual:persons, and if so,-the nature: of such interactions.
