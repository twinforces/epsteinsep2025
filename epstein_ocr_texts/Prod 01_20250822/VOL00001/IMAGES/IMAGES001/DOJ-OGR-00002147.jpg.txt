a United States citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from in that
regard. However, it is our view that under the specific and unique facts of this case, it is
highly unlikely that the French government would refuse to issue and execute an
extradition decree against Ms Maxwell because of several critical factors.

78. First, under the applicable Extradition Treaty between the USA and France, a State party
may refuse extradition on the basis of nationality, however if it does so, it is obliged to
prosecute the requested person itself, on the basis of the conduct and the allegations
contained in the request. In the case of Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, it is highly unlikely that the
French government would be inclined to conducting such prosecution, considering that all
the relevant facts were committed in the USA, a long time ago, and that witnesses are also
located in the USA.

79. Secondly, France is mindful to preserve its good extradition relations with the United
States, as evidenced by a number of recent cases we reviewed or conducted in which
French competent authorities proved highly cooperative with US authorities. If Ms
Ghislaine Maxwell were to flee to France, and the USA decided to issue an extradition
request, it would be difficult for French authorities — from a diplomatic point of view — to
deny such an extradition request, considering that no legal bar applies.?”

80. Thirdly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell also holds American nationality, and has
substantial ties to the USA, would, in all likelihood, be taken into account by the French
government as one more element weighing in favor of extradition.

81. Similarly, and fourthly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell signed a legally binding
Waiver under US law, and would have subsequently fled to France in violation of her bail
conditions, could equally be taken into account by the French government as an incentive
not to grant Ms Ghislaine Maxwell the benefit of her French nationality as a ban to
extradition.

37 Of the 36 reported Supreme Court decisions involving extradition requests from the United States in the last 20
years, the French authorities granted extradition in 34 of these cases. Lower court decisions granting extradition
were quashed only twice for procedural deficiencies not at issue in this case.
