a United States. ‘citizen. Thus, there is no precedent to draw from in that
regard. However, it is our view thatunder-the specific-and unique, facts of this case, it is
highly. ‘unlikely ‘that the French government would. refuse: to, issue and execute an

extradition, decrec.against:Ms.Maxwell because of:several ‘critical factors..

78. First, undér the. applicable: Extradition Treaty between ‘the USA and France, a State, party
may. ‘refuse extradition on, the basis of nationality, however if it docs so, ‘it is obliged to
prosecute the requested person itself, on ‘the basis of ‘the conduct; and. the allegations
contained.in the:request: Inthe case of Ms Ghislaine-Maxwell, it is highly unlikely that the
French government would be:inclined to conducting such:prosecution, considering that.all
the relevant facts were committed in the USA; a long’time ago, ard that witnesses are also
located inthe USA.

79. Secondly, France is mindful. to preserve its. good. extradition. relations. with the United
States, as evidenced by a number of récent' casés we reviewed, of conductéd in ‘which
French competent authoritics proved, highly cooperative with US authorities. If Ms
Ghislaine Maxwell were to flee to France, and ‘the USA. decided. to issuc an, extradition
request, it would’be difficult:for French authorities — from a diplomatic point of view — to

deny:such.an extradition:request, considcring that no:Icgal bar. applies.*”

80. Thirdly, 'the faet ‘that Ms Ghislaine Maxwell, also holds. American nationality, and. has
substantial, tics to‘the USA, would, in,all, likclihood, be taken, into account by the: French,

government as one more element: weighing: in-favor of extradition.

81. Similarly, and fourthly, the fact that Ms Ghislaine. Maxwell signed a Icgally birding
conditions, could equally be taken into :account’by. the Frenchy government as an incentive
not to: grant Ms, Ghislaine Maxwell the: benefit of her. French.nationality: as, a ban. 'to

extradition.

Of the 36:reported Supreme Court-decisions involving extradition requests fronvthe United States in the-last.20
years, the: French authorities granted extradition‘in:34-of these cases. Lower court decisions granting extradition
were.quashed'only twice, for procedural deficiencies notat issue.in :this:case.
