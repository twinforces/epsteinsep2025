1. Applicable law

Echoing and reinforcing the presumption of innocence, our justice system’s bedrock,
there is a “strong presumption against [pretrial] detention.” United States v. Hanson, 613 F.
Supp. 2d 85, 87 (D.D.C. 2009). A person facing trial generally must be released so long as some
“condition, or combination of conditions . . . [can] reasonably assure the appearance of the
person as required and the safety of any other person and the community.” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c).
“Only in rare circumstances should release be denied.” United States v. Motamedi, 767 F.2d
1403, 1405 (9th Cir. 1985). Any doubts as to the propriety of release are resolved in the
defendant’s favor. See United States v. Chen, 820 F. Supp. 1205, 1207 (N.D. Cal. 1992).
4 Mr. Epstein’s lone foreign residence is in Paris; France has an extradition treaty with the United
States.
° Mr. Epstein owns one private jet. He sold the other jet in June 2019.
