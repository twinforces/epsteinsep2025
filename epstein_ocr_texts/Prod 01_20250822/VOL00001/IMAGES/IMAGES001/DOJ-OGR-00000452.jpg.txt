1980s, when hijackings were prevalent, in connection to Middle East
travel. The passport was for personal protection in the event of travel to
dangerous areas, only to be presented to potential kidnapers, hijackers

Ninth, the Court is undoubtedly aware of the highly charged
context surrounding this prosecution. In November 2018, media reports
suggested that Epstein received a plea deal that amounted to a “slap on
the wrist.” Putting aside the robust negotiations leading to the non-
prosecution agreement and the prison sentence Epstein completed,
there’s no denying that although certain witnesses through their
attorney representatives,!! the media — e.g., The Miami Herald — and the
public were all clamoring for his re-prosecution, Epstein traveled
extensively over these eight months and invariably returned to the
United States. That inescapable reality emphatically proves he won’t flee
and entitles him to release — on any and all conditions the Court deems
appropriate.
