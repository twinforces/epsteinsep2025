1 know if there are more -—- 12 cases, all of which involve a

2 minor victim -—- kidnapping, sex trafficking of children,

3 aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, offenses resulting in

4 death, sexual exploitation of children, selling and buying of

5 children, the production of sexually explicit depictions of a

6 minor for importation into the United States, crimes involving
7 the transportation of minor victims, coercion and enticement,

8 transport of minors, and use of interstate facilities to

9 transmit information about a minor.

10 All of those --— there may be others, but those are the
11 ones we found -- also carried this presumption of remand

12 instead of bail.

13 MR. WEINBERG: Yes, your Honor.

14 THE COURT: Presumption.

15 MR. WEINBERG: Yes, your Honor. If we're looking at
16 1591 -- and I'm not here today to in any way diminish the

17 gravity of the allegations against Mr. Epstein, but it's far

18 away from the heartland of 1591 commercial sex trafficking that
19 deals with servitude and deals with enslavement and deals with
20 pimps, if I can use that word, selling women for commercial
21 profit.
22 We've provided the Court with some of the division in
28 the law, including decisions by this Court, by Judge Jones
24 relying on a South Dakota opinion, by the chief justice that
25 finds the statute inapplicable.
