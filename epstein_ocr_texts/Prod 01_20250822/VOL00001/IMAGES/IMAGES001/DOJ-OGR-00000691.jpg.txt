1 applicable law in this circuit, the Court has no alternative

2 but to grant that motion.

3 I think the current law is outdated, as the Court

4 suggested in some of its remarks. I think there will come a

5 time when either an Appellate court or the Congress will make

6 clear that, just as it's possible to continue civil cases

7 against someone after they have deceased, it is possible, at

8 least for purposes of things like restitution, to continue

9 criminal cases, but we are not there now. And, fortunately, in
10 this case, there are other ways and perhaps even more efficient
11 ways to vindicate the interests of the victims here.

12 We greatly appreciate the remarks of the

13 representative of the Department of Justice today, and we, too,
14 on behalf of the victims, are not going to stop when we walk

15 out of this courtroom. We are going to continue to seek

16 vindication against Mr. Epstein's estate and, in some senses,
17 perhaps even more important, against the people who worked with
18 him and enabled him.

19 As you have already heard, and will hear more,
20 Mr. Epstein did not act alone. He could not have done what he
21 did, on the scope and the scale of what he did, for as many
22 years as he did it without the activities and support and the
23 co-conspirator activity of a number of other key individuals,
24 and those individuals also need to bear their share of
25 responsibility, and those people need to have a reckoning as
