consider the reasons for the delay as well as the prejudice to the accused.” United States v.
Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783, 790 (1977); United States v. Lindstrom, 698 F.2d 1154, 1158 (11th Cir.
1983). A defendant's showing of prejudice triggers a “sensitive balancing of the government’s
need for an investigative delay ... against the prejudice asserted by the defendant.” United States
v. Brand, 556 F.2d 1312, 1317 (Sth Cir. 1977). For example, a delay caused by a good-faith
ongoing investigation will generally not be considered a due process violation. Lovasco, 431
U.S. at 791. Governmental delay caused by “sinister” reasons that prejudice a defendant require
dismissal of an indictment. “Sinister” motives include using the delay to gain tactical advantage

also occurs with prosecutorial delay incurred in reckless disregard of circumstances, known to
the prosecution, suggesting that there existed an appreciable risk that delay would impair the
ability to mount an effective defense. Lovasco, 431 U.S. at 795 n.17. The Supreme Court, in
United States v. Eight Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifty Dollars ($8,850) in U.S. Currency,
461 U.S. 555, 563 (1983), interpreted Lovasco as holding that claims of prejudicial pre-
indictment delay can succeed “upon a showing that the government delayed seeking an
indictment in a deliberate attempt to gain an unfair tactical advantage over the defendant or in
reckless disregard of its probable prejudicial impact upon the defendant's ability to defend
against the charges.” “‘Reckless’ conduct means acting in a way that is ‘indifferent to
