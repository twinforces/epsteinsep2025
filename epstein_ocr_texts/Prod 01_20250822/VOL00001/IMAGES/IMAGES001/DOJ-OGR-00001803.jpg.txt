Third, the defense’s.claim that the Materials are “matcrial to preparing [her] defense” under
Rule 16; and. thus subject to immediate disclosure, is premised 0 on.a reimagining of the charges
16 only insofar as as “it could be, used to counter the g government’ S$ Case or: bolster a “defense.” ” United
States v. Stevens, 985 F.2d 1175, 1180 (2d Cir. 1993). Thus, materials that are. wholly: irrelevant.
to the Govérnment’s, case or the charges if the Iidictment do not fall tinder Rule 16. That:is the
ease here. ‘Contrary: to the defense’s claim, the Government .has ‘not charged.Maxwell with being:
Jeffrey Epstcin’s “madam” and “principal facilitator of his abuse.” (Def, Ltr. 3). ‘Instead, the
defendant..is charged with, helping Epstein identify, groom, and. sexually abuse multiple minor
victims between 1994 and 1997. The Indictment: docs ‘not allege that. the defendant. engaged ‘in,
such conduct after 1997. As such, the Materials are. simply. not relevant to the charges ‘in the
Indictment, much Icss.cxculpatory to the defendant.

Maxwell’s argument:is equally flawed. with, respect, to the perjury counts. (Def. Ltr. 3).
The Indictment alleges that:the Government’s evidence on:Counts. One through Four based on her:
conduct from 1994 to,1997:is also evidence of the falsity of the.answers provided.in the:deposition.
‘Specifically, the portions of her deposition thatthe. Government.alleges in.the Indictment are ‘false
are all contradicted by the allegations contained in paragraphs one through seven of theIndictment,
which focus exclusively: on the period 1994 through. 1997. Indced, ‘paragraph cight of the
Indictment notes that the defendant’s statements during ‘her deposition, contradicted, “some of the
specific. events and. acts of abuse detailed” in paragraphs one through st seven | of the Indictment,
10). Consistent with that position, Counts Rive and Six both incorporate by reference paragraphs
one: through cight. ofthe: Indictment. (See id. at..15-16). Accordingly, evidence that the defendant
did or did not. participate in Epstein’s abuse of minor victims at. different times or on. different.
oceasions not-charged. in the Indictment. would-not undercut the Government’s theory or exculpate
the defendant on. those counts.

Finally, and perhaps more: importantly, the Government is not. suggesting that these
Materials should. be kept from the defense: indefinitely. Rather, the Government :requests
authorization. to provide ‘these Materials, cight; wecks prior to trial, along with its production of
statements of other non-testifying' witnesses. Even assuming argnéendo that. the Matcrials
constitute Brady of Rule. 16 :evidenée—which'they do not for all of the reasons discussed above—
the defendant cites:no case law for the proposition ‘that she is entitled to their production now,
rather than ‘eight weeks in, advance-of trial. The Second Circuit. has held that: “as a general rule,
Brady and its progeny. do not. require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and, impeachment.
matcrial upon request by'a.defendant.” United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 146 (2d.Cir. 2001).
Instead, “the Government, ‘suppressés’ evidenee within the meaning of Brady only if it. fails to
disclose.Brady and Giglio material in: time for its effective use at trial or-atia. plea proceeding.” /d.
‘What constitutes sufficient time for “cffective use at trial” depends.on the ‘ ‘materiality of that
evidence” and “the particular circumstances of the case.” Id.

Here, the defendant has made no showing as'to why. cight/wecks in advance of trial would,
not be cnough time to:make “effective use” of the Materials at-trial or how she ‘would otherwise
be:prejudiced by the:Government’s proposed disclosure timeline. Coppa, 267 F.3d.at 146. Indeed,
given. that the ‘Materials constitute approximatcly' 40 pages of records: and. approximately’ 40
