nonprosecution agreement does not bind the Southern District of

New York.

THE COURT: I was going to dsk you about that toe.

MR. ROSSMILLER: Yes; your Honor. I do expect that we

can brief this, but. the short version is that this prosecution

is not precluded by the nonprosecution agreement entered into

by the defendant in the Southern District of Florida. That

agreemént éxpréssly referréd to that féederdl district. It

didn't purport to bind any other office or district.

Lt. is ‘well-settled in the Second Circuit that a plea

agreement in one U.S. Attorney's office does not bind another

the agreement refers generally to "the government." Again,

additionally, as set forth in the indictment returned by the

grand jury, the stibstantive count alleges acts occurring in New

York and allegés Néw York=baséd victims.
