1 There is no evidence to support that. The investigation was

2 begun and conducted entirely separate from any other district.
5 It began in the Southern District of New York.

4 Certainly there is evidence that was gathered that is
5 consistent with and even overlapping with the prior

6 investigation. But as the Court noted, in particular an entire
7 count of this indictment is with respect to New York victims.

8 And that is before we even get to the fact that the

9 nonprosecution agreement does not bind the Southern District of
10 New York.

11 THE COURT: I was going to ask you about that too.

12 Now that you have mentioned the topic, explain that, would you.
13 MR. ROSSMILLER: Yes, your Honor. I do expect that we
14 can brief this, but the short version is that this prosecution
15 is not precluded by the nonprosecution agreement entered into
16 by the defendant in the Southern District of Florida. That

17 agreement expressly referred to that federal district. It

18 didn't purport to bind any other office or district.

19 It is well-settled in the Second Circuit that a plea
20 agreement in one U.S. Attorney's office does not bind another
21 unless otherwise stated. That is even if, based on case law,
22 the agreement refers generally to "the government." Again,
23 additionally, as set forth in the indictment returned by the
24 grand jury, the substantive count alleges acts occurring in New
25 York and alleges New York-based victims.
