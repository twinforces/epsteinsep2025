that the Defendant poses.a, significant risk: of flight. Thus, the Court ‘again concludes that there
are no conditions of release that/will reasonably. assure her appearance in future:procéedings.

B. Pretrial detention continues to be warranted

The thrust of the Defendant’s argument in her third motion for bail, is that the two'new’
proposed conditions vitiate the: Court’s concerns regarding the risk of flight. The. Defendant first

retired federal judge, who would. function as an asset monitor and. will have co-signing authority:
over the account. /d. ‘Those conditions are offered in. addition to the bail package she proposed.

unclear validity, and the relevance and practical impact ofthe rénunciations is, at: best, ‘unclear.
See Gov't: Opp’n at 5, With respect to: her offer to renounce her French citizenship, the Court:is
again confronted with, ducling opinions on the correct interpretation of French law. The
Government relics on the position ofthe head of the International. Criminal Assistance Burcau of
the French Ministry of Justice, who argues that.“the fact that the wanted individual is.a French

national constitutes an. insuperable. obstacle to his/her removal,” and that ‘‘[a]s lorig as said.
