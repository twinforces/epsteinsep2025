THE COURT: So, today's conference was schedtiled at
the end of the July 18 court conference hearing on that date,
I thought that. w6é would devote at least the -- well, probably

most of today's proceeding to talking about the schedule in

this case, and I askéd thé lawyers to get together and see if

they could come up. with a mutually agreeable schedule, which

would include trial date, motion ‘practice, discovery, €étc.
Does anybody want to let me know how you made ‘out?
MS; MOE: Yes, your Honor.

We have conferred with defense counsel and, talked

about. a proposed schedule for this case. So we dare prepared to
propose to the count today a schedule for discovery, for
discovery=related motions, for pretrial mdétions,; and we are
also prepared to talk about setting a possible trial date.

THE COURT: Okay: What Have you got ih mind?

MS, MOE: So, with respect to discovery, we would

propose a discovery déadline 6f October 31 to complete

discovery, with, one exception. There are materials from

dévicés séized from the defendant's residents ih New York, and
the F.B... is beginning the process of reviewing that data,

In discussing that with deferise Counsel, we Have begun

to discuss a process for a privilege-review protocol. It's
possible that process may take longer than. October 31. But
aside from that universe of documents, we would propose setting
a schedule of October 31 as a deadline for discovery.
