1 THE COURT: So, today's conference was scheduled at

2 the end of the July 18 court conference hearing on that date.

3 I thought that we would devote at least the â€”- well, probably

4 most of today's proceeding to talking about the schedule in

5 this case, and I asked the lawyers to get together and see if

6 they could come up with a mutually agreeable schedule, which

7 would include trial date, motion practice, discovery, etc.

8 Does anybody want to let me know how you made out?

9 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

10 We have conferred with defense counsel and talked

11 about a proposed schedule for this case. So we are prepared to
12 propose to the court today a schedule for discovery, for

13 discovery-related motions, for pretrial motions, and we are

14 also prepared to talk about setting a possible trial date.

15 THE COURT: Okay. What have you got in mind?

16 MS. MOE: So, with respect to discovery, we would

17 propose a discovery deadline of October 31 to complete

18 discovery, with one exception. There are materials from

19 devices seized from the defendant's residence in New York, and
20 the F.B.I. is beginning the process of reviewing that data.
21 In discussing that with defense counsel, we have begun
22 to discuss a process for a privilege-review protocol. It's
23 possible that process may take longer than October 31. But
24 aside from that universe of documents, we would propose setting
25 a schedule of October 31 as a deadline for discovery.
