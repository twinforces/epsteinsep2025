‘provided the Prosecution Team with an electronic copy ofits entire case file regarding the Florida
Investigation, which consists of 4,421 pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The
Government is reviewing that file for any. material that is non-duplicative of other :material.
previously obtained and that warrants disclosure’ in this case.

case. The Government: has reviewed those: files for discoverable materials. The: physical, files
from the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have. all been
transferred to the FBI New’ York Office and are. in the possession of the Prosceution Team. Those
files have been scanned and, put into an clectronic review platform. The Government has

and_as noted, above, some items from. the FBI Florida, Office file have already been ‘produced, as
part-of prior discovery: productions in this case.

between, approximately 2006 and.2010. ‘Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received.
any documents from. the USAO-SDFL and did not. have: the USAO-SDFL’s: investigative file.

Epstein. investigation. in. 2011.8, the. Prosecution Team had ‘no substantive. communications. with.the
USAO:SDEL about:the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution. until after indicting this
casc, ‘However, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the
USAO-SDEL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team witha copy of
its entire investigative: file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the: files for material that.
warrants disclosure in this case. The USAO-SDEL agreed to ‘provide its entire file, which 1s
contained in approximately: 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government.
hired. a. vendor.'to copy the entire; USAO-SDFL file: and.‘load. that filce:into an.clectronic review
platform. ‘The Government reecived the electronic copy of the USAO-SDEL file from the vendor
today and intends to review that file for‘matcrials that warrant disclosure in this case.

Fifth, internal. Department of Justice emails relating to the prior.Florida Investigation have
been. gathered by the Department of Justice’s Office of: Professional Responsibility (“OPR”), as
part. of its unrelated. investigation, into the resolution of the prior Florida. Investigation. In.
particular, during the: course: of its investigation, OPR, gathered a significant volume of emails, to
the extent they had been preserved and. remained accessible, fron’ a‘number of USAO-SDEL
attorneys, including a number of supervisors.:in ‘that. office and, the primary line Assistant U-S.
