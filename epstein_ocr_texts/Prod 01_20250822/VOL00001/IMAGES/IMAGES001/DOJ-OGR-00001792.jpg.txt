Although the PBSA is not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government has nevertheless
communicated with the PBSA and requested that the PBSA provide the Prosecution Team with its
entire investigative file, to the extent it still exists. In response, on September 14, 2020, the PBSA
provided the Prosecution Team with an electronic copy of its entire case file regarding the Florida
Investigation, which consists of 4,421 pages of documents, 43 audio files, and 6 video files. The
Government is reviewing that file for any material that is non-duplicative of other material
previously obtained and that warrants disclosure in this case.

Third, the FBI Florida Office conducted a prior federal investigation into Jeffrey Epstein
between approximately 2006 and 2010. As noted above, the electronic files from the FBI Florida
Office are accessible by the FBI New York Office, which has provided the Government with a
complete set of FBI electronic files from both its Florida Office and its New York Office for this
case. The Government has reviewed those files for discoverable materials. The physical files
from the FBI Florida Office, which are contained in approximately 24 boxes, have all been
transferred to the FBI New York Office and are in the possession of the Prosecution Team. Those
files have been scanned and put into an electronic review platform. The Government has
previously reviewed those files and is continuing to do so for discoverable materials. In addition,
and as noted above, some items from the FBI Florida Office file have already been produced as
part of prior discovery productions in this case.

Fourth, the USAO-SDFL participated in the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein
between approximately 2006 and 2010. Before today, the Prosecution Team had never received
any documents from the USAO-SDFL and did not have the USAO-SDFL’s investigative file.
Indeed, aside from notifying the SDFL at an executive level that the SDNY was opening its own
Epstein investigation in 2018, the Prosecution Team had no substantive communications with the
USAO-SDFL about the Prosecution Team’s investigation or prosecution until after indicting this
case. However, after the initiation of this prosecution, the Government communicated with the
USAO-SDFL and requested that the USAO-SDFL provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of
its entire investigative file, so that the Prosecution Team could review the files for material that
warrants disclosure in this case. The USAO-SDFL agreed to provide its entire file, which is
contained in approximately 28 boxes, to the Prosecution Team. Accordingly, the Government
hired a vendor to copy the entire USAO-SDFL file and load that file into an electronic review
platform. The Government received the electronic copy of the USAO-SDFL file from the vendor
today and intends to review that file for materials that warrant disclosure in this case.

Fifth, internal Department of Justice emails relating to the prior Florida Investigation have
been gathered by the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR”), as
part of its unrelated investigation into the resolution of the prior Florida Investigation.* In
particular, during the course of its investigation, OPR gathered a significant volume of emails, to
the extent they had been preserved and remained accessible, from a number of USAO-SDFL
attorneys, including a number of supervisors in that office and the primary line Assistant U.S.
Attorney who worked on the Florida Investigation (“Attorney-1’).
> This OPR investigation has been publicly acknowledged by the Department of Justice.
