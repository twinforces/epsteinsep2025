‘Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 168 Filed 03/18/21 Page 3 of 5.

Defendant’s objections relate to her contention, that some of the information contained.in, the
‘redactions has been. made: public by other means. Notwithstanding this, the redactions'‘to which
the Defendant objects relate:to the privacy interests of third parties, which:the Second. Circuit has
‘admonished “should weigh heavily’ in a.court’s balancing equation.” United States 'v.. Amodeo

(“Antodeo, IP’), 71 F.3d 1.044, 1050 (2d.Cir. 1995). At least some of the redactions:to which the

Defendant objects relate to private “family affairs” of a, third party, a. factor that “wcigh[s] more
heavily. against access than conduct. affecting a, substantial portion, of the:public.” Jd. at 10511.
And though.the. Defendant contends that some of the information contained in the redactions:is
public, she furnishes no evidence to that effect. As.a result, the Court concludes that the
significant privacy‘intcrests at stake justify the limited and narrowly tailored. redactions
contained in-Exhibit 5.

In. addition, the Court adopts the Defendant’s proposed additional:redactions to pages
129-134 of the Government’s bricf. Those portions of the transcript, Which were ;redacted in, the,
‘civil matter, concern privacy’ interests and their disclosure would. merely: serve to.cater'to: a
“craving for that which is sensational and impure.” Amodeo:.H, 71 F.3d at:1051 (citation
omitted). The Court thus concludcs:that such. redactions are justificd.

On the other hand, the Court agrees ‘with the Defendant’s objections to the ‘redactions
contained in-pages 1-128 of the Government’s bricf. To-provide some context, the redacted,
portions of the brief:relate to:scaled: proceedings that took place before different judges relating
to'the issuance: of grand jury subpoenas in connection with,the'present case; See Dkt. No: 51.
Because'the, Government's briéfiis a judicial, document aiid because. the presumption of access
attaches, the: Government’s redaction, requests: must’be “necessary’to preserve higher, values: and.

only ifthe scaling order‘is narrowly tailored to achieve that aim.” Lugosch v. Pyramid Co: of
