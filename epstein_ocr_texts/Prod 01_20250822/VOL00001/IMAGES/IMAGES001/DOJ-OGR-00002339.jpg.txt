Re. United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell

Dear Judge Nathan:

By letter to the Court, dated January'25, 2021 (Dkt.1.17 at 2-3), the: MDC raised objection
to the Court’s order, unopposed by the government, directing the MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell to
usc on a laptop computer on:weckends. and holidays. (Dkt. 116 at.2). The MDC has failed to
state.a valid, or: compelling reason for opposing the: Court’s directive.

The MDC does not identify any valid reason ‘why Ms. Maxwell cannot have aécess-:to the
laptop computer on.weckends and holidays. The MDC does not argue, for example, that access
to.the laptop cannot be provided’because of issucs related to safety or security, staffing, or (to
quote the government) the need to “manag[c] ‘its inmate population.” Instead, in opposition to
the Court’s order; the MDC repeats ‘its stock’ response: Ms. Maxwell. has received significant
amount of time to:review her discovery and has moré contact with counsel than any other MDC
‘inmate is.allotted. The MDC’s fixation on the relative time Ms. Maxwell has been given:to
review discovery is totally misguided. The g government, ‘has produced millions ‘of pages of
discovery. Ms. Maxwell has the right,to review all of them/in order to prepare her defense for
trial. To do that, she! nceds access to the laptop for as'much time as ‘possible, including the
‘weckends and holidays because the prison Computers are incapable of réading the millions of
discovery. documents. Ms. Maxwell loses ‘10.or:more hours per weck duc to delay in receiving
the laptop, problems caused. bythe: MDE computer, and. inability to access the computer during
‘morning and. afternoon counts on, the weckends. Comparing: Ms. Maxwell to other inmates does
not justify restricting her use ofthe laptop to review discovery.

The MDC’s:proposed solution—that.Ms. Maxwell can, simply use the prison.computer on,
the weekends and ‘holidays to .review discovery—is: utterly inadequate. As.Ms. Maxwell has
pointed out on many occasions, the prison:computer:is incapable of reading a significant portion.
of the discovery,. including but.not limited to native files, Excel files, some video ‘and audio'files,
and anything requiring Cellebrite software. The MDC concedes this fact in their letter—=Ms.
Maxwell carinot review all. ofiher discovery on the prison computer. And’using it catises.a
‘colossal waste of'time.. For cxample,, if Ms. Maxwell locates a document on.the:prison computer
