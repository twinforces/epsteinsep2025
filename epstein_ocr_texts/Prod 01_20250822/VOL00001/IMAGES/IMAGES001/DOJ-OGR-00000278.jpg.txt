Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document6 Filed 07/11/19 Page:5 of 16

Though the Bail Reform, Act contains a rebuttable’ presumption:in, favor of detention
based on the crimes charged, the presumption shifts only the burden of production, not
persuasion. See United States Vv. Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 11 44 (2d.Cir. 1986). Accordingly, the
statutory demand on defendants “is fairly casily met.” United States-v. Conway, No. 4-11- 70756,
201.1 WL 3421321, at: *2(N-D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2011). To rebut. the presumption, a. defendant necd
only “show that the specific:nature of the crimes charged, or that.somcthing about their
individual circumstances, suggests that ‘what is truc in, gencral is not true, in.the‘particular
ease ...°” United States ¥.. Domingticz, 783 F.2d.702, 707 (7th. Cir. 1986) (quoting United States
Ve Jessup, 757 F.2d.378, 384 (1st Cir.1,985)). “The quantum of evidence required to rebut'the.
presumption: is. not high.” United States: Thompson, No. 16-CR-00019, 2018 WL 4473311, at *2
(M.D. Pa. Jan. .1,7,'2018) (citation omitted). “Any evidence favorable to a defendant that comes
within a category listed in. § 3.142(g): can affect the operation of [the presumption], including’
evidence of their marital, family’ and employment status, tics to and:role in the community; clean
criminal, record and other. types of evidence encompassed in. § 3142(8)(3).” Domingues, 783 F.2d
at 707 (clean record plus: socioeconomic stability sufficed to rebut presumption).

In short, evidence that the defendant.is unlikely to flee or commit crimes rebuts the
presumption, forcing the government.to persuade the court‘that. detention ‘is warranted. See:
Conway, 2011 WL'3421321, at *5 (§ 1591 defendant released pending trial). While not.
disappearing entirely, the presumption thus recedes to one factor. among, many ‘in determining
whether there are sufficient conditions to “ “reasonably assure” both presence and safety. ; See:
Martir, 782 F.2d at ‘1144; .see also United States v-Or ta, 760 F.2d 887, 89] (8th Cir. 1985)
([R]easonably assure” doesn’t mean: in. “guarantee. ”). Even ins a. a presumption. ¢ case, , then, “the:
wicfendant presents a danger ‘to, the community,” and by a‘ “proponderinee” ‘that his p poses a flight
“tisk? United States v. English, 629 F.3d 3.11, 3:19 (2d Cir. 201 1) (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted).

I. Mr. Epstein’s 14-year record of law-abiding behavior rebuts any presumption ‘in
favor of pretrial detention

In this ‘case, any danger presumption attending the § 1'591 charges evaporates against Mr:
Epstein’s meticulous obedience, from 2005 to date, to’both the law’s commands and his rigorous
registration ‘and reporting obligations. as.a. convicted, sex offender. The indictment does not allege
that Mr: Epstcin committed. any crime in the 14-year interval. between the énd of the alleged,
conduct and the ‘initiation. of this case. ‘The dangerousness: prong ofthe Bail. Reform Act is:
predictive, asking whether it’s likely that Mr. Epstein will seoffend if released. A spotless. 1.4-
ycar‘record of walking the straight and narrow, , complemented by an exemplary 10-ycar history’
of diligent sex, offender registration ‘and reporting, is compelling proof he was able, once the
‘prior investigation Commenced, to conform his conduct,to the law’s dictates. The'time lag:
between.the offenses charged and today is particularly compelling in terms of'a prediction of
