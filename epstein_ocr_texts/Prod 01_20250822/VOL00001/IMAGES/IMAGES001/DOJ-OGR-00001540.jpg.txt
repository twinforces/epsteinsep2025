ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in this matter is hereby scheduled to
occur as a remote video/teleconference using an internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In
advance of the conference, Chambers will email counsel with further information on how to
access the video conference.
To optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others may access
the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited capacity of the internet
platform system, only one attorney per party may participate by video. Co-counsel, members of
the press, and the public may access the audio feed of the proceeding by calling a dial-in number,
which the Court will provide in advance of the proceeding by subsequent order.
Given the high degree of public interest in this case, a video feed of the remote
proceeding will be available for viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel
Patrick Moynihan Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing
requirements, seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons
will be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who appears
at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to
