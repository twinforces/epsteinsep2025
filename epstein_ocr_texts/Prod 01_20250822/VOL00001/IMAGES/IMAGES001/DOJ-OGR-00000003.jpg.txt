Case 22-1426, Document 109-1, 09/17/2024, 3634097, Page2 of 26

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell appeals her June 29, 2022,
judgment of conviction in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (Alison J. Nathan, Judge). Maxwell was
convicted of conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in
criminal sexual activity in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; transportation
of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity in violation
of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and sex trafficking of a minor in violation of 18
U.S.C. §1591(a) and (b)(2). She was principally sentenced to
concurrent terms of imprisonment of 60 months, 120 months, and 240
months, respectively, to be followed by concurrent terms of
supervised release.

On appeal, the questions presented are whether (1) Jeffrey
Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement with the United States
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida barred Maxwell’s
prosecution by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern
District of New York; (2) a second superseding indictment of March
29, 2021, complied with the statute of limitations; (3) the District Court
abused its discretion in denying Maxwell’s Rule 33 motion for a new
trial based on the claimed violation of her Sixth Amendment right to a
fair and impartial jury; (4) the District Court’s response to a jury note
resulted in a constructive amendment of, or prejudicial variance from,
the allegations in the second superseding indictment; and (5)
Maxwell’s sentence was procedurally reasonable.

Identifying no errors in the District Court’s conduct of this
complex case, we AFFIRM the District Court’s June 29, 2022, judgment
of conviction.
