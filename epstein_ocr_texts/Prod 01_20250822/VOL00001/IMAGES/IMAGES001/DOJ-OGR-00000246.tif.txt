This circuit split presents an exceptionally important
question. Plea and non-prosecution agreements resolve
nearly every federal case. They routinely include
promises that extend to others—co-conspirators, family
members, potential witnesses. If those promises mean
different things in different parts of the country, then
trust in our system collapses. The Court should grant
certiorari and restore consistency, and credibility, to
the government’s word.

I. The government concedes that the circuits
are split as to whether a promise on behalf
of the “United States” by a United States
Attorney’s office in one district is binding
upon other districts.

The government (like the Second Circuit in the
opinion below) agrees that there is a clear circuit split
on the precise question posed by this Petition. Opp.13;'
United States v. Maxwell, 118 F.4th 256, 263 n.11
(2d. Cir. 2024) (“recogniz[ing] that circuits have been
split on this issue for decades.”). As the Second Circuit
noted, this conflict is well-documented and longstanding.
Indeed, the government points out that litigants have
sought the Court's clarification of this issue at least
as far back as 2011, when this Court denied certiorari
in Prisco v. United States, 562 U.S. 1290 (2011), No.
10-7895.

' The United States argues that the split is 3-2 in favor of
Petitioner, not 4-2, claiming that that the “Ninth Circuit has not
expressly addressed the matter at issue here.” Opp.13. While not
express, the Ninth Circuit is pretty clear that it agrees with
Petitioner’s position, holding that a U.S. Attorney can bind other
districts and agencies, Thomas v. INS, 35 F.3d 1332 (9th Cir.
1994), and when in doubt, “the government must bear respon-
sibility for any lack of clarity in those terms,” United States v.
Johnston, 199 F.3d 1015, 1020 (9th Cir. 1999).
