1 377(1), and we understand that the court is following the

2 statute. The statute gives alleged victims the right to speak
3 through counsel, through the government, or directly, and be

4 heard, and we understand that, your Honor.

5 The question today before the court, we submit, is

6 whether or not our client could be released or should be

7 released on a condition or combination of conditions to assure
8 her appearance. And as to that question, the presentations

9 today do not speak, they do not speak to risk of flight, and
10 the courts have -- in this circuit have thought about and

11 researched what weight should be given to that. There is an
12 opinion by Judge Orenstein in the Eastern District, United

13 States v. Turner, from April 2005, not cited by the government,
14 in which the court, after carefully surveying the legislative
15 history and background of the CVRA and its interplay with the
16 bail reform statute, concluded, "In considering how to ensure
17 that the rights are afforded, I am cognizant that the new law
18 gives crime victims a voice but not a veto. Of particular

19 relevance to this case, a court's obligation to protect the
20 victim's rights and to carefully consider any objections that
21 victim may have never requires it to deny a defendant release
22 on conditions that will adequately secure the defendant's
23 appearance," going on to cite the Senate legislative history
24 that's being cited with approval of United States v. Rubin,
25 also an Eastern District case.
