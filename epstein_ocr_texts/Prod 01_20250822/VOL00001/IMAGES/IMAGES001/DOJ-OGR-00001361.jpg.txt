in-person attomey visits are now available seven days per week. The MDC has placed HEPA air
filters in its attorney visiting rooms to improve air quality during visits. Additionally, the
defendant has received the COVID-19 vaccine and is now fully vaccinated. The Government
understands that defense counsel have thus far declined to meet with the defendant in person and
instead rely on VTC calls, email, and supplemental phone calls to communicate with their client.
The option of in-person visits remains available seven days per week should defense counsel wish
to meet with the defendant in person.

The defendant’s legal mail is processed in the same manner as mail for all other inmates at
the MDC. All inmate mail is sent to the MDC’s mail room, where every piece of mail is processed
before being provided to the inmate recipient. Due to the large number of MDC inmates and the
volume of mail received at the MDC, this process can take multiple days. As noted above,
however, the defendant is able to send and receive emails with defense counsel every day and has
regular communication with counsel via VTC, which can be supplemented by phone calls.

Like any other inmate, the defendant is patted down by MDC staff whenever she is moved
to a different part of the facility. Typically, these searches include at least two pat-down searches
of the defendant per day: once when she is moved from her isolation cell to the day room each
morning, and once when returns from the day room to her isolation cell each night. In addition,
when the defendant elects to attend outdoor recreation, she is searched two additional times: once
when she is moved to the recreation area, and once when she returns to the day room from the
recreation area. MDC staff also conduct a body scan, which is a non-invasive machine scan, on
the defendant once per week to check for any secreted contraband. Because those scans take place
in a different part of the facility than the day room, the defendant is patted down two additional
times when these weekly scans occur: once when she is moved to the scan area, and once when
