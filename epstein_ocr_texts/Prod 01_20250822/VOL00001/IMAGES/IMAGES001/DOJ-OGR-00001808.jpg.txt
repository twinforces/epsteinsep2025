investigation. The substance of this information is critical to the defense because it negates the
entire theory of prosecution.

The Government has not provided any information about the genesis of the Non-
Prosecution Agreement (“NPA”) that the Government entered into with Jeffrey Epstein in 2007.
This is information will form the basis of substantial defense motions and argument.

According to recent press reports, lawyers for the accusers met with the Government in
2016 during the pendency of ongoing civil litigation against Ms. Maxwell in an effort to
convince the Government to open an investigation of Ms. Maxwell — an effort which did not
ultimately succeed. Neither the fact of these meetings nor the content has been disclosed. This is
significant exculpatory information that is needed to investigate, prepare motions, and defend at
trial.®

We assume that many of the potential Government trial witnesses either participated or
benefited from Epstein’s NPA because the plea agreement provided for a mechanism where the
claimants were paid money by Epstein, who could not challenge liability, only the amount. The
Government presumably has this information which is unquestionably favorable evidence which
“includes not only evidence that tends to exculpate the accused, but also evidence that is useful
to impeach the credibility of a government witness....” United States v. Teman, No. 19-CR-696
(PAE), 2020 WL 3034034, at *43 (S.D.N.Y. June 5, 2020) (citations omitted), see also, Bagley
v. Lumpkin, 798 F.2d 1297, 1301 (9th Cir. 1986); United States v. Librach, 520 F.2d 550, 554
(8th Cir. 1975).

The Government is the Team

In an attempt to minimize what it promised, the Government redefines who it believes is
on the Team. The Government claims no responsibility for investigations into these allegations
by either the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Office of the United States Attorney unless
part of the Southern District of New York. This stands in stark contrast to the on-the-record
assurances that it gave the Court on July 14, 2020:

“’,.the materials with respect to the core of the case also include prior investigative files

from another investigation in the Southern District of Florida....” Tr. p. 12:10-13

“The physical files [from the Florida investigation] were shipped to New York and are at

the New York F.B.I. office. They have been imaged and scanned and photographed to

make sure that a comprehensive review can be conducted, and they are physically in New

York so that we can have access to those files.” Jd., 14:10-14

Now, the Government seeks to distance itself from its own files, which are in New York,
not Florida, by arguing that they are excused from reviewing or producing information because it
6 Pursuant to this Court’s practice standards regarding discovery, Ms. Maxwell, on October 13, 2020, sent a detailed
letter requesting the production of discovery materials under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure,
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) and Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972). The Government has yet
to respond.
