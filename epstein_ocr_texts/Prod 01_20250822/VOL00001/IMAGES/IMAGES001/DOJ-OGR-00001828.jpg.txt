Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter to request an extension of the deadline for
the production of a subset of the electronic discovery in the above-referenced case from November
9, 2020 to November 23, 2020. This extension is necessary solely to allow adequate time for an
outside vendor to finalize the preparation of documents extracted from electronic devices seized
from Jeffrey Epstein for production. Over the past two days, the Government has conferred with
defense counsel, who indicated this morning that they would only consent to the extension on four
conditions, detailed below. Although the Government agrees to meet two of the defense
conditions, it will not agree to the other two, which have no connection to the delay in discovery
and no basis in law. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court grant the
extension to produce electronic discovery to November 23, 2020.

To date, the Government has produced more than 350,000 pages of discovery to the
defense over the course of five productions, and the Government expects to make a sixth
production by the existing November 9, 2020 deadline, as detailed below. However, the
Government’s outside vendor has advised the Government that it requires additional time to
prepare a seventh and final production of electronic discovery. By way of background, that final
production comes from electronic devices that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) seized
from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences in New York and the U.S. Virgin Islands in 2019. Specifically,
in July of 2019, the FBI conducted multiple searches of Epstein’s residence in New York, and in
August of 2019, the FBI searched Epstein’s residence in the Virgin Islands. During both searches,
the FBI seized dozens of electronic devices. Pursuant to court-authorized warrants, the FBI then
initiated the months-long process of gaining access to and extracting data from those devices.

In or about January of 2020, the FBI provided some, but not all, of the data from those
devices to the Government. At the request of Epstein’s estate, a filter team conducted a review of
that subset of data for potentially privileged materials. In or about February of 2020, the privilege
team completed its review of a subset of data that the FBI had provided. In or about late February
of 2020, the Government initiated a responsiveness review of that subset of data.

On June 26, 2020, the Government obtained a new warrant expanding the scope of the

DOJ-OGR-00001828
