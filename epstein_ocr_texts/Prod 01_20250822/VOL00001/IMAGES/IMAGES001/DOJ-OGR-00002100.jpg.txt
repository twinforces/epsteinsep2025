who must consider, amongst other things, whether to remand the person in custody or on bail'*. In
cases where the person appears before the court pursuant to a full extradition request, the judge must
set a date for the extradition hearing to begin’’. In provisional arrest cases, this date is set after the full
request is served which, in US extradition cases, must be within 65 days of arrest’®.

7. At the extradition hearing, the appropriate judge must decide: (a) whether the extradition request
meets certain technical requirements’’; (b) whether the person appearing before the judge is the
person whose extradition is requested'®; (c) whether the offence(s) specified in the extradition request
are extradition offence(s)'’; (d) whether there are any bars to extradition’’; (e) whether extradition
would be compatible with the person’s rights under the European Convention on Human Rights
(‘ECHR’) within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998”; and, where applicable, (f) whether
extradition would be oppressive by reason of the person’s mental or physical condition”.

8. If the appropriate judge decides all the statutory questions in favour of the requesting government,
then they must send the case to the Secretary of State’ who must decide whether any of the bars to
extradition that she must consider” apply. These bars are different to those considered by the
appropriate judge. The Secretary of State has no power to consider any human rights objections to
extradition”. If she decides that no bars apply, she must order the person’s extradition,” subject to
very limited exceptions which are not applicable here’.
