Re: United States-v. Ghislaine.Maxwell, 20 Cr, 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The ‘parties, jointly submit this, letter im response to ‘the, Court’s November 24,2020 order
directing the partics to mect and confer regarding the defendant’ S: request that the warden of the
defendant’ S conditions of detention. “(Dkt. No. 16). “Over the past week, ‘the Government ‘has
spoken:with MDC legal counsel regarding the defendants conditions of confinement; and has, tried
to gather additional information regarding the concerns raised by the defendant, which the
Government has shared with defense counsel. The Government has-also conferred. with. defense
‘counsel. three times regarding, the same, as well as the defense’s request relating to MDC Warden.
Heriberto ‘Tellez. The partics have been unable to reach agreement. Our respective positions
follow.

The Government respectfully submits ‘that. the Court should allow MDC. legal, counsel, to
respond. directly in writing, to the Court. and ‘defense counscl. regarding the: concerns defense
‘counsel .has raised relating to the: defendant’s conditions of ‘confinement. The Government:
‘understands. that MDC legal, counsel is prepared to submit.a letter by’ this Friday, ‘Deecmber 4,
2020. Such a letter is the appropriate. next step at. this'time, as it will allow the Court.to hear
directly from MDC. legal counsel.who,.can addiess:the defendant’s conditions:of confiriement. The
letter will allow: the Court‘to ascertain:whether further: inquiry, including:a:personal appearance by
the Warden, or other MDC: personnel, is necessary. Morcover, the Government docs not:
understand the concerns raised by. the defense to: implicate the defendant’s access to legal materials
or her ability’ to communicate ‘with her counsel. As, noted in the ‘Government’s Ictter dated.
November 23, 2020, the défendant continues to, have more time'to review her'discovery. than any
other inmate at the MDC. The defendant also.has as much, if not more, time as any other MDG
inmate: to communicate with her attorneys. (Dkt. "No. 74).

The defense disagrees. As communicated to the Government, the defense’s position, Is. as
follows: Warden Heriberto Telléz should. appear before the Court to directly address concerns
regarding Ms. Maxwell’s conditions of confinement, ‘which specifically target her. On October
29, 2020, the defense emailed..a. Ictter to Warden Tellez detailing the: onerous and restrictive
conditions, including ‘but not limited to concerns regarding the supplemental, camera; excessive
