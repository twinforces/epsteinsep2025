1 submissions. Those are the written submissions: principally

2 the indictment, the legal principles governing release versus

3 remand, the presumption of remand in 18 U.S.C. section 1591

4 cases, danger to others and the community. This topic has

5 seven subsections and fills over ten pages of the decision and
6 order. I think it is fair to say that it is the heart of this
7 decision, that is to say, dealing with danger to others and to
8 the community.

9 Then I deal with risk of flight. That has four

10 subsections or factors, which are substantially the same

11 factors that are used to analyze dangerousness.

12 Then, finally, the bail package proposed by the

13 defense. Specifically, I find in the decision and order that
14 the government has established dangerousness to others and to
15 the community by clear and convincing evidence and also that

16 the government has established risk of flight by a

17 preponderance of the evidence. I also reject the proposed bail
18 package as irretrievably inadequate and go on in some detail

19 concerning what I consider to be its deficiencies.
20 Incidentally, I am not suggesting that a different
21 bail package would be appropriate because I doubt that any bail
22 package can overcome danger to the community.
23 I focus then on dangerousness to others, most
24 certainly including the minor victims in this case and
25 prospective victims as well. I cite and quote, for example,
