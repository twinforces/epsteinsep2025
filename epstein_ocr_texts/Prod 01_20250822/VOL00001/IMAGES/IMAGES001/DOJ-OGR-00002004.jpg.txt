country. (Dkt. 18 at 12-14, Tr. 52-53). It is even more unfounded in light of the daily avalanche
of media coverage of Ms. Maxwell. She is now one of the most recognizable and infamous
people in the world. She is being pursued relentlessly by the press, which would no doubt be
camped out by her front door every day if she were granted bail. The notion that Ms. Maxwell
could somehow flee to a foreign country during a worldwide pandemic (presumably, by plane),
while being supervised and monitored 24 hours a day and with the eyes of the global press corps
on her every minute, without being caught, is absurd.

To the extent the Court is concerned that her calculus may have changed since her arrest
because the threat of prosecution has now crystallized into concrete charges (Tr. 85-86), Ms.
Maxwell has addressed that concern head-on—she will execute irrevocable waivers of her right
to contest extradition in both the United Kingdom and France. (Ex. T). These waivers
demonstrate Ms. Maxwell’s firm commitment to remain in this country to face the charges
against her. Moreover, as discussed more fully in the attached expert reports, because of these
waivers and other factors, it is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to successfully
resist an extradition request from the United States to either country, in the extremely unlikely
event she were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. U-V). Moreover, any extradition
proceedings in either country would be resolved promptly. (d.).

Courts have addressed concerns about a defendant’s ties to a foreign state that enforces
extradition waivers by requiring the defendant to execute such a waiver as a condition of
release—including in cases where the defendants, unlike Ms. Maxwell, were not U.S. citizens.
See, e.g., United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-1514, 1999 WL 1456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July 13, 1999)
