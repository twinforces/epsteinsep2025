1 Our process going forward, as we noted in that letter
2 to victims, is that we will use an opt-in process so we will

3 not notify individuals who do not wish to receive additional

4 notifications but will continue to provide ongoing information
5 about upcoming conferences and relevant details on the

6 government's victim services website.

7 With respect to this specific hearing, the government
8 has been advised by counsel to three victims of their interest
9 in being heard in connection with today's bail proceeding. One
10 victim's views are expressed in the government's reply

11 memorandum; one victim has submitted a statement to the

12 government and asked that the government read it during today's
13 proceedings; and one victim has asked to be heard directly, and
14 the government anticipates that she will make a statement at

15 any time during this proceeding as necessitated by the court.
16 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

17 Then, with that, returning to the schedule that you

18 have laid out, and I thank counsel for conferring in advance,
19 as to a proposed schedule, Mr. Cohen, let me just finalize if
20 you agree to the proposed schedule that has been laid out by
21 Ms. Moe and supplemented by you?
22 MR. COHEN: Yes, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.
24 And, Ms. Moe, you continue to support the proposed
25 schedule?
