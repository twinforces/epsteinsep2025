1 it is clear that defendant has not met her burden to rebut the
2 presumption of detention in this case. The government urges

3 the court to detain this defendant, consistent with the

4 recommendation of Pretrial Services and the request of the

5 victims. It is important, your Honor, that there be a trial in
6 this case, and the government has serious concerns that the

7 defendant will flee if afforded the opportunity.

8 Thank you, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: Briefly, Ms. Moe, just a couple of legal
10 questions.

11 Mr. Cohen argued that you failed to address directly
12 the standards, the burdens under the statutory provision, and
13 that you have avoided the fact of the government continuing to
14 carry the burden by a preponderance of the evidence with

15 respect to risk of flight and whether there are measures that
16 could assure appearance. Do you dispute anything legally

17 suggested by Mr. Cohen in terms of the standard that applies?
18 MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government submits that the
19 standard is clear. It is the defendant's burden of production
20 to rebut the presumption that there are no set of conditions
al that could reasonably assure her continued appearance in this
22 case. The government has the ultimate burden of persuasion,
23 but it is the defendant's burden of production. She has failed
24 to meet that burden for the reasons we set forth in our
25 briefing and arguments today.
