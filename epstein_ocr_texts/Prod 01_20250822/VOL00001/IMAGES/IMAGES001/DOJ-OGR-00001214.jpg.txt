hearing and that has a material bearing on the issue whether there are conditions of release that
will reasonably assure the appearance of such person as required and the safety of any other
person and the community.” A court may also revisit its own decision pursuant to its inherent
authority, even where the circumstances do not match § 3142(f)’s statutory text. See, e.g.,
United States v. Rowe, No. 02-CR-756 (LMM), 2003 WL 21196846, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 21,
2003) (noting that “‘a release order may be reconsidered even where the evidence proffered on
reconsideration was known to the movant at the time of the original hearing.”’); United States v.
Petrov, No. 15-CR-66 (LTS), 2015 WL 11022886, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2015) (noting the
“Court’s inherent authority for reconsideration of the Court’s previous bail decision”).

In line with this, the Defendant’s new motion aims to address the reasons that the Court
provided when it originally determined that no conditions could reasonably assure her
appearance and that pretrial detention was warranted. First, the Defendant proposes a more
expansive set of bail conditions that she claims addresses any concerns regarding risk of flight.
The newly proposed conditions include a $28.5 million bail package, which consists of a $22.5
million personal recognizance bond co-signed by the Defendant and her spouse and secured by
approximately $8 million in property and $500,000 in cash, along with six additional bonds—
five co-signed by the Defendant’s friends and family members and the sixth posted by the
security company that would provide security services to the Defendant if she were granted bail
and transferred to home confinement. See Def. Mot. at 2. The proposed conditions also provide
that the Defendant would be released to the custody of a family member, who would serve as her
third-party custodian under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1)(B)(i); that she would be placed in home
confinement with GPS monitoring and that her travel would be restricted to the Southern and
Eastern Districts of New York and would be limited to appearances in Court, meetings with
