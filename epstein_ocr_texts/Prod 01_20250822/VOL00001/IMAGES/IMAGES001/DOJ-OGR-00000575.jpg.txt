Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 65 of 74 65

1 would have been charged is particularly rich in this case.

2 There are plumes of smoke as to those particular issues, and

3 the Court can reasonably infer that there is fire.

4 The idea that Mr. Epstein was feeling particularly

5 generous to his old friends and associates days after the Miami
6 Herald published a series of articles about his misconduct and
7 the circumstances leading to his non-prosecution agreement is

8 not credible, and the Court shouldn't find it to be credible.

9 Finally and most importantly, this idea that the

10 defendant has disciplined himself, the defendant is asking the
11 Court to risk the safety of the community on the

12 self-discipline of a man they appear to concede has a

13 preference for underaged girls.

14 This idea that he has disciplined himself is a

15 concession that the defendant has a problem, that he has an

16 appetite for children. Your Honor, the defendant keeps telling
17 on himself here.

18 They concede that the government will be able to show
19 the elements of the crime. They concede that he has to
20 discipline himself to avoid committing the types of crimes he
al has before.
22 They say that he didn't flee because he thought that
23 there was the potential he would be -- I'm sorry. They say he
24 didn't flee despite the fact that he thought there was a
25 potential to be charged.
