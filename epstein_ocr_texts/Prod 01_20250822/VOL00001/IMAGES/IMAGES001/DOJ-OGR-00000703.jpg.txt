1 Statement of Jane Doe 7. To the Honorable Richard M.
2 Berman. I used to be relatively carefree, inquisitive, hopeful
3 and excited about life, but my Life changed because of Jeffrey
4 Epstein. My perspective on life became very dark when I was

a unknowingly recruited by one of his agents. Jeffrey Epstein

6 ruined me. His recruiter ruined me. The far-reaching

7 consequences of that day ruined my family's lives.

9 family from unwanted media attention.

24 disgusting, shameful person who does not deserve to ever be
25 happy. These are the thoughts I've lived with on a daily
