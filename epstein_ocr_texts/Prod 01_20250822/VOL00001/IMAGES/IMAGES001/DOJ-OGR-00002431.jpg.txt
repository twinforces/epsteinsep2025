According to Wiktionary, we are still in the 2000s: “2000s (Noun) The millennium that began
on January 1, 2000 and ends on December 31, 2999.” Also as defined in: Dictionary:
2000s may refer to:

e 2000s (decade), the period from 2000 to 2009

e The period from 2000 to 2099, almost synonymous with the 21st
century (2001-2100)

e The period from 2000 to 2999, almost synonymous with the 3rd
millennium (2001-3000)

(Accessed December 18, 2020). The question posed, with the ambiguous date range was
inclusive, meaning the answer would cover the entire period, not a part of that period. The
answer, that Ms. Maxwell was unaware of “sexual activities” spanning more than a millennium
was accurate and truthful.

These questions and answers were completely immaterial to the defamation action, were
inadmissible in the action, and could not have influenced any fact finder. They were also
ambiguous. Prior to the quoted testimony there were discussions about sexual and professional
massages. Here, the questioner fails to clarify what type of “massage” he is referring to.
