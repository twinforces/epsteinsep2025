Case 21-770, Document 20-1, 04/01/2021, 3068530, Page4 of 31

These conditions would support a complaint for cruel and unusual
punishment for a convicted felon. Ms. Maxwell is not one. She is
innocent unless and until she is proven guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt — an event which is highly unlikely given the lack of evidence
against her.

Despite the district court’s exhortations regarding the strength of
the evidence against Ms. Maxwell, the truth is that the government’s
so-called “evidence,” though voluminous, is palpably weak. It consists
of anonymous, untested hearsay accusations about events that are
alleged to have occurred decades ago, accusations which only surfaced
when the government faced public outrage over the inexplicable death
of Jeffrey Epstein, while in their custody.

The “Epstein Effect” clouded the judgment of the prosecutors into
charging Ms. Maxwell because it needed a scapegoat, the Bureau of
Prisons into putting Ms. Maxwell on suicide watch because Epstein died
on their watch, the media into an absolute frenzy, and many other fair-
minded people into viewing Ms. Maxwell as guilty even though no
evidence has been presented against her.
