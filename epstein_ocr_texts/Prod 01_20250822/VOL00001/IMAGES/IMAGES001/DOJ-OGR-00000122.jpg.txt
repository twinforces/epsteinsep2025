59a
B. The non-prosecution agreement does not
cover the charged offenses

The NPA would provide Maxwell no defense to the
charges in the $1 superseding indictment even against
an office bound to follow it. The NPA bars prosecution,
following Epstein’s fulfillment of its conditions, only
for three specific categories of offenses:

(1) “the offenses set out on pages 1 and 2” of
the NPA; namely, “any offenses that may
have been committed by Epstein against
the United States from in or around 2001
through in or around September 2007”
including five enumerated offenses;

(2) “any other offenses that have been the
subject of the joint investigation by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the
United States Attorney’s Office”; and

(3) “any offenses that arose from the Federal
Grand Jury investigation.” 6

Dkt. No. 142-1 at 2. The NPA makes clear that the
covered charges are those relating to and deriving
from a specific investigation of conduct that occurred
between 2001 and 2007.

Maxwell contends that the NPA’s co-conspirator
provision lacks any limitation on the offenses covered.
The Court disagrees with this improbable interpretation.
The phrase “potential co-conspirator” means nothing
without answering the question “co-conspirator in
what?” The most natural reading of the co-conspirator
provision is that it covers those who conspired with
Epstein in the offenses covered by the NPA for their
involvement in those offenses. Thus, it would cover any
involvement of Maxwell in offenses committed by
