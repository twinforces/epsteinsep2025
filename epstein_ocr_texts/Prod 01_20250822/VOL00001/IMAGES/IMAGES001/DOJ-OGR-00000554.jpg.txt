‘Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36 Filed 07/24/19 Page44of74 44

probation or community control part. .of the Florida state

sentence, he tasked lawyers to go to these different

registration beards in the states where he had residence.

Tt. was complicated beécausé Of the multiplé residences.

And the ultimate decision in New Mexico -- and I can't tell you

whether there was a period where he did register, but I can
tell you that at @ point in time very close to the beginning,
New Mexico Said, ‘you don't need to register.

I know he made an effort to register because the

concern was that the federal registration statute requires that
you contact the states where you reside.

It. Was complicated because of the multiple residences,

and the last thing ‘he wanted to, do was to create a new offense

through an omission of the obligations under the federal SORNA,.
So he went to New Mexice. And I will particularize

the famés of thé pedple and the namés of the lawyers, but he is

not, reguiréd to registér: New Mexicd knows he's there because
g g

the Virgin Islands tells the different places where he travels
that he's coming. He's under close supervision.

THE COURT? JT got it.

TI think I sort. Of aSsSumed sométhing like that, that
counsel. in different jurisdictions would have had a meeting or
filed an application or a letter or something or rather causing
the, administrative agency to respond.

This i8 réally now strétching my recollection. TT
