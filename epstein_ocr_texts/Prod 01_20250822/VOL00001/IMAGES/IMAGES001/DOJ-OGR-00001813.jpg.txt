its outside vendor to image, stamp, and download that electronic discovery, which the Government
finished preparing for production last week, from an electronic database. The volume of that
production is large and takes significant time for the vendor to prepare. It is therefore possible that
the vendor may need a limited amount of additional time to complete that process. That said, the
Government has repeatedly informed the vendor of the November 9, 2020 deadline, and the vendor
is making every effort to meet it. The Government expects an update from the vendor early next
week and will promptly alert the Court and the defense if it appears the vendor will need additional
time beyond November 9 to finalize this production. But contrary to the defense’s suggestion, the
Government has made numerous productions consistent with the discovery schedule in this case
and is working diligently to continue to meet the discovery deadlines in this case.

With respect to the defense’s other claims and accusations, the Government is prepared to
respond in detail at the appropriate stage. But in short, many of the defense’s accusations about
the Government’s allegedly deficient productions are not only factually or legally incorrect, but
also include complaints that the Court has already directed the defense to renew only if unable to
reach agreement with the Government “[f]ollowing the close of discovery,” which has not yet
occurred. (Order dated Aug. 25, 2020, Dkt. 49, at 2). Others turn on the defense’s baseless
attempts to redefine classic Giglio or Jencks Act material as Rule 16 discovery, or on a faulty
definition of exculpatory material that has no basis in law. (See Gov. Ltr. dated Aug. 13, 2020,
Dtk. No. 41, at 2-3 (noting law supporting delay of production of witness list until shortly before
trial); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 7, 2020, Dkt. No. 63, at 2 (noting that Rule 16 does not require
production of witness statements or Giglio); Gov. Ltr. dated Oct. 20, 2020, Dkt. No. 65, at 1-2
(noting well-established law in this Circuit precluding defense from offering evidence that a
defendant did not participate in criminal conduct on a different occasion than that charged by the
Government)).”

With respect to the Government’s October 7 letter regarding other agency files, the
defense’s claims that the Government has “minimize[d]” what it promised and “redefine[d] who
it believes is part of the Prosecution Team” are deeply misleading.’ (Def. Ltr. 4). To be clear, the
Government has always viewed FBI files from both the prior Florida investigation and the more
Government may identify additional discoverable materials after the deadline. Should that happen,
the Government will promptly produce such materials to the defense.

? Tn addition to repeating previously made arguments, the defense now contends that evidence
about the “genesis” of the non-prosecution agreement between the United States Attorney’s Office
for the Southern District of Florida and Jeffrey Epstein, is exculpatory. (Def. Ltr. 4). The defense
makes this assertion despite the fact that neither this Office nor the defendant were party to that
agreement, the agreement covered conduct spanning a different period of time than that charged
in this case, and the agreement does not mention the defendant by name. To the extent the defense
nevertheless believes it is entitled to those materials, the appropriate forum to raise those
arguments is on the pretrial motion schedule established by the Court.

> Tt bears mention that at no point did the defense seek to confer with the Government regarding
any concerns about the Government’s October 7 letter or the Government’s planned productions
prior to filing the Defense Letter with the Court.
