For example, Count Five alleges that. Ms. Maxwell lied in the following exchange:

Q: Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit:underage girls for sexual
massages? Ifyou.know.

A: don’t know what you're: talking about.

Similarly, Count.Six alleges that Ms. Maxwell lied in‘the following exchange:
Q: ‘Other thanyourself. .. with'whom did Mr. Epstein have, sexual activities?

A: J_wasn*t.aware’that‘he was having, sexual activities ‘with anyone when I ‘was
with him-other than myself.

anyone other than. yourself.

A: That is my‘testimony, that is correct.

The government has. spoken to nuiierous, individuals who claim to have béen assaulted by Epstein
after 1997, but do not implicate:Ms. Maxwell in the assault. or:claim that she:knew about it in any
way. That bolsters Ms. Maxwell’s defense that she was not aware of either Epstein’s scheme to
recruit and, sexually abuse underage girls, or that Epstein was engaging in sexual activities with
others, and therefore did. not.perjure herself in;response to those questions.

Accordingly, the Materials and the prior statements of the withesses:to whoim they pertain.
are exculpatory: evidence inconsistent'with the. government’s theory of the charges in the
Indictment and-must be disclosed. pursuant.to the government’s Brady obligations.

2. The Government Has Not Shown Good:Cause that Disclosure of the Materials Will
Interfere. with.an Ongoing Investigation,

to’ preparing ‘the defense” and therefore. should’ ‘be disclosed under Rule 16(a)¢ 1 \(E). The
government agrees that the Materials should be produced, but asserts that there is good calse to
délay thé production of thé Matérials until eight ‘weeks before trial, pursuant'to Rule 16(d). (Dkt.
60 at 2-3). The government’s justification forthe delay, however, is entirely inadequate to
establish. good cause.

The government. asserts that. disclosing the Materials will prematurely reveal, to the defense
the identities of certain victims of Epstein who are not referenced in’the Indictment, as well ‘as
