Cased 20-€FOd3G0uAUNt Dibeutre/ntl £70 2il ed 42SBM/ 26a cedge b§ 205
has agreed to co-sign Ms. Maxwell’s $22.5 million bond and to post all three properties he
owns—all located in the United States and worth a total of approximately $8 million
combined as security for the bond. As the financial report discussed later in this
submission makes clear, $22.5 million represents all of the current assets of Ms. Maxwell
and her spouse. One of the properties is the family home where Ms. Maxwell, her spouse,
a have lived to gether If Ms. Maxwell were to violate her bail
conditions, which she has no intention of doing, she would be leaving her spouse fj
|| with virtually nothing. It is unfathomable that Ms. Maxwell would abandon her
family, which she has fought so hard to protect, under these circumstances.

z. A Number of Ms. Maxwell’s Family and Friends, and the Security
Company Protecting Her, Are Prepared to Sign Significant Bonds

In addition to her spouse, a number of Ms. Maxwell’s family members and friends,
many of whom are US. citizens and residents, have volunteered to step forward as co-
signers. These sureties, as well as the others who have written letters on Ms. Maxwell’s
behalf, know that Ms. Maxwell has never run from a difficult situation and will not do so
now. To show the depth of their support and their confidence that Ms. Maxwell will abide
by her bail conditions and remain in this country, the sureties have agreed to sign separate
bonds for Ms. Maxwell in amounts that are significant and meaningful to them, and each
would cause severe financial hardship if she were to violate her bail conditions.

For example, one surety, who is a U.S. citizen and resident, will post the only
property she owns. This property is worth approximately $1.5 million and is her “only nest-
egg for retirement.” (Ex. C). She writes:

I do not have any other savings and it would be completely devastating

financially and in every way to my own family were the house to be taken

over by the Government due to a breach a bail conditions.
