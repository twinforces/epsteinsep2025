Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in:Opposition. to the
government’s July 2, 2020 Memorandum:in Support of Detention (Gov. Mem.”).

It is difficult to recall.a recent case that has garnered.more public attention than, the
government’s prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”). In July 2019, Epstein. was indicted, for
offenses relating to.sexual misconduct, amid ‘overwhelming media. attention focused on the
nature of the charges and Epstein’s wealth, and lifestyle. On August 10, 2019, Epstein died. in:
her for'Epstein—even though she’d had:no contact with Epstein. for more than,a decade, had
never been charged ‘with a crime or been found liable in any civil litigation, and has always
denied.any allegations of claimed misconduct. Many.of these:stories and online posts. were
threatening and. harassing'to our client-and those’ close to her.

But'sometimeés thé simplest:point 1s:the most’ critical ore: Ghislainé, Maxwell is not
Jeffrey Epstein., She was: not named in the government's indictment.of Epstein.in 2019, despite
the fact that the government. has, been investigating this case for years.. Instead, the current
indictment is based on allegations of conduct that. allegedly: occurred roughly-twenty-five. years
ago. Ms. Maxwell vigorously denies the charges, intends to fight them, and is entitled, to the
presumption of innocence. Far from “hiding,” she has lived in the United States since 199.1, has
litigated civil cases arising from her:supposed ties ‘to Epstein, and.has not left the country even
‘once since Epstein’s arrest ‘a.year ago, even though she was aware of the pending, ‘and highly
publicized, criminal. investigation. She, should be ‘treated like anyother defendant who comes
beforethis Court, including. as to bail. Under the Bail Reform Act, case law in-this Circuit and
other circuits, as well ‘as decisions, of this Gourt, Ms. Maxwell, should. be released on bail, subject:

tothe. strict Conditions ptoposed below.
