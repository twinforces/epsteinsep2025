the district court. /d. “In deciding whether a bill of particulars is needed, the court must
determine whether the information sought has been provided elsewhere, such as in other items
provided by discovery, responses made to requests for particulars, prior proceedings, and the
indictment itself.” United States v. Strawberry, 892 F. Supp. 519, 526 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).

Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare her case has already been significantly impaired by not
knowing the most basic information about the government’s proof — she still does not know who
has accused her of these alleged crimes. Without knowing this fundamental information, Ms.
Maxwell has been forced to make assumptions about their identities and attempt to investigate
these allegations blindly. If one of the purposes of a bill of particulars is to “prevent surprise,”
Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d at 574, there could be no greater “surprise” than for Ms. Maxwell to find
out that a few weeks before trial that the people she assumed to be the three accusers were not, in
fact, the right people. If that occurs, the defense will have wasted months of investigation work
and will not be able to adequately prepare for trial.

As we have previously argued (see Dkt. 38), the Court has the inherent authority to
compel pretrial disclosure of the identities of government witnesses, and should do so here. See
United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975);° United States v. Warme, No.
O9CR19A, 2009 WL 427111, at *2 (W.D.N.Y. Feb. 20, 2009) (ordering government to disclose
identity of sex crime victim where “defendant’s ability to adequately prepare a defense against
this charge is significantly compromised without being advised of the identity of the alleged
victim’). On August 25, 2020, the Court denied as premature our request that the government be
ordered to provide the identities of the three accusers. (Dkt. 49). We have conferred with the
>In Cannone, the Second Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court’s order to compel disclosure of
witness identities under the circumstances of that case. 528 F.2d at 300-02. Nevertheless, Cannone recognized the
district courts’ ability to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses in appropriate cases. /d at 301.
Here, the unique circumstances of this case warrant the disclosure of the accusers’ identities.
