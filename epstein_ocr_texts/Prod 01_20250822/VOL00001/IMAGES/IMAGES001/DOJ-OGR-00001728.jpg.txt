under constant observation by multiple prison guards.’ She is also still being awakened several
times in the middle of the night. Even on more routine matters, Ms. Maxwell’s treatment has
been worse than other pretrial detainees. For example, Ms. Maxwell has no access to email and
has been given 30 minutes per month for personal phone calls, far fewer than the 500 minutes
granted to other pretrial detainees since the COVID-19 crisis. Unlike defendants in the general
population, she does not have a desk or a writing surface where she can take notes when
reviewing the discovery. And until recently, Ms. Maxwell was denied access to the prison
commissary for no apparent reason.

We respect that the BOP needs to ensure the orderly operation of the MDC. But Ms.
Maxwell’s conditions of confinement are unique to her and seem punitive rather than anything
necessary to ensure that the MDC as a whole is running smoothly. Accordingly, we respectfully
request that, going forward, Ms. Maxwell be monitored in the same manner as other pretrial
detainees and that the Court order the BOP to grant Ms. Maxwell the same privileges given to
other detainees.*

For the reasons set forth above, we respectfully submit that the Court should grant Ms.

Maxwell’s motion.

Respectfully submitted,

* The defense recently learned that some of these prison guards were, in fact, BOP psychologists who were
observing Ms. Maxwell and evaluating her for hours each day without her knowledge. We are aware of no other
pretrial detainee receiving such treatment.
“In our original letter, the defense asked the Court to order the BOP to release Ms. Maxwell into the general
population because we had been informed that Ms. Maxwell would not receive certain privileges, like access to a
desk and the prison commissary, unless she were housed there. As long as Ms. Maxwell is monitored in the same
manner, and receives the same privileges as other pretrial detainees, it is not necessary to move her to the general
population.
