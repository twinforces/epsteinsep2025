26. In these circumstances, it cannot have been the intention of French lawmakers that
Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure be construed as meaning that
a person who has lost French nationality would still be entitled to be protected from
extradition since the French government has on several occasions deported to third
countries individuals who had been deprived of their French nationality following the
commission of criminal offences.
