extradition, from,Isracl, (or any other country) would. be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process
and, at'worst, impossible.”).

Having carefully reviewed the experts” reports and ‘the cases cited by: the Defendant,’ the
‘Court’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of
flight remains. fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in:part by the substantial legal
questions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likclihood, that
any extradition would, be a difficult and. lengthy process (including; for instance, the likelihood.
that the Defendant would contest the:validity of those waivers. and the duration it would take to
resolve those: legal disputes). ‘The likelihood, thatthe Defendant would be able to frusfrate any
extradition requests—even if she were. cortéct that she’would be tinable'to stop extradition.
‘entirely—weighs strongly in favor of detention.

In addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary: financial ‘resources also, continuc to:provide
her the means to flee the country and todo so‘undetected. To be:sure,, this factor alone docs. not
by itself justify continued, detention. But.as the Court noted.at,the initial, bail hearing, the
Défendant?s financial résourcés, in combiriation’ with her substantial ‘international tiés and
foreign connections and her.experience avoiding detection (whether from the:government, the
press, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the ‘flight:risk,analysis. See’ Tr. at; 88:6-88:23

(citing United,States v: Khashoggi,717 F. Supp. 1048, 1052 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)). The Court places
little weight on;this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a-defendant; could strategically
offer to ‘waive the right.to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that
might:result. The Court is unpersuaded.
