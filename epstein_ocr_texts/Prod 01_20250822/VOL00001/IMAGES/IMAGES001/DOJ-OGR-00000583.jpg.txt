Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 73 of 74 73

1 question? Are you saying that Mr. Epstein engaged in sexually
2 inappropriate conduct with you?

3 MS. FARMER: He was inappropriate with me. He was

4 inappropriate with me. I would prefer not to go into the

5 details of that at this time. Yes.

6 THE COURT: Thank you very much.

7 MS. FARMER: You're welcome.

8 MR. EDWARDS: Your Honor, may I also be heard?

9 THE COURT: Absolutely.

10 MR. EDWARDS: Brad Edwards. I represent Courtney Wild
11 who wishes to make a statement today to the Court. Let me just
12 give you a brief context.

13 THE COURT: Could you just for a minute spell her

14 name.

15 MR. EDWARDS: Sure. Courtney, C-o-u-r-t-n-e-y, Wild,
16 W-i-l-d.

17 Just for context, I have represented her since 2008 in
18 a civil action as lead counsel that we filed against the

19 United States Attorney's Office under the Crime Victims' Rights
20 Act where we have alleged and now proven that the previous
21 non-prosecution agreement was structured in violation of the
22 rights of many of the victims.
28 Courtney Wild was the Jane Doe in that lawsuit. And
24 for that reason, she has a particular interest in this case.
25 We want to first say we appreciate your Honor's acknowledgment
