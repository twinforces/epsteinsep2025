1 (Case called)

2 THE COURT: Good morning, everybody. Please be

3 seated.

4 So just some housekeeping. We have a podium here for

S both attorneys and others who may be speaking, and so we would

6 like you, attorneys and others who are speaking, to come up to

7 the podium. This room is a little cavernous. We thought the

8 podium over there would be more comfortable.

9 For starters, and for this you don't have to go up to
10 the podium, if you could just indicate your names. This table
11 in front to my left, your right, are defense counsel, and that
12 table to my right, your left, are government attorneys.

13 If we could just ask the attorneys to introduce
14 themselves.
15 MS. COMEY: Good morning, your Honor. Maureen Comey
16 and Alison Moe for the government. Joining us at counsel table
17 are Special Agent Amanda Young of the FBI and Detective Paul
18 Byrne of the NYPD.
19 MR. WEINGARTEN: Good morning, your Honor.
20 Reid Weingarten.
21 MR. WEINBERG: Martin Weinberg.
22 Good morning, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: Good morning.
24 MR. MILLER: Good morning, your Honor.
