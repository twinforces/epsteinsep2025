Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document172 Filed 03/24/21 Page2of3
by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or
request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule 17(c)(3).

On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter from the law firm indicating that it can
provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be elicited by
the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims it represents.

In that letter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of the law firm
and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the equivalent of a
motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the Court can receive
adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion to quash, the law firm
shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public docket. See United States v. Ray,
No. 20-CR-110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020) (“[I]f the Court
determines that the subpoena calls for personal or confidential information about a victim, it
requires the requesting party have given notice to the victim before it permits the service of the
subpoena. If the victim objects, the Court will then determine whether to modify or quash the
subpoena, including on grounds that Nixon was not satisfied.”).

In advance of noticing an appearance and filing, the law firm shall meet and confer with
defense counsel to see if any issues can be narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to
filing, the law firm shall confer with defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored
redactions to the objections. The law firm’s objections with any proposed redactions shall be
filed on or before March 26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing of
objections, defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply
