1 the compelling testimony of Annie Farmer and Courtney Wild, who
2 testified that they fear for their safety and the safety of

5 others if Mr. Epstein were to be released.

7 such as sex trafficking involving minor victims, as in this

8 case some allegedly as young as age 14.

10 and compensation paid to potential witnesses and the facts

11 surrounding whether or not Mr. Epstein has been compliant with
12 his legal obligations as a registered sex offender.

15 community, when discussing that aspect, risk of flight, the

16 decision speaks to the seriousness of the charged crimes, to

18 include private planes and frequent international travel and
19 also a foreign residence in Paris.
20 I mention the items very recently seized from Mr.

22 warrants, which include sexually explicit photos and discs,
23 some $70,000 in cash, diamonds, and an expired Austrian
24 passport with Mr. Epstein's photo but with a name that is
25 different from Jeffrey Epstein, and also contains a reference
