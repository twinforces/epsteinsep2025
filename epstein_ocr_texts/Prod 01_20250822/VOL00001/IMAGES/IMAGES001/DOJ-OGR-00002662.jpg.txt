typically give it great weight in interpreting federal statutes. See, e.g., Food & Drug Admin. v.
Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 144 (2000) (noting that “Congress
considered and rejected” federal bills that would have granted the FDA jurisdiction to regulate
tobacco products); Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 464
USS. 89, 104 (1983) (noting that Congress had “expressly considered and ultimately rejected”
proposed interpretation of Civil Service Reform Act); Hudson Valley Black Press v. LR.S., 409
F.3d 106, 112 (2d Cir. 2005) (noting that legislative history, including conference report,

subsequent charges); United States v. Lawson, 683 F.2d 688, 693 (2d Cir. 1982) (characterizing
conference committee’s rejection of Senate proposal to permit use of plea bargaining statements
for impeachment purposes under Fed. R. Evid. 410 as “demonstrating Congress’ explicit
intention to preclude use” of such statements). It cannot reasonably be disputed that Congress
intended that the 2003 Amendment would not apply retroactively.

Nothing in Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2017), the only Second
Circuit case that analyzes the retroactivity of the 2003 Amendment, is inconsistent with this
analysis. In Weingarten, the court’s analysis was in the context of an ineffective assistance of
counsel claim. Thus, Weingarten offers little more than a distraction from the analysis required
here: The court was not required to and did not decide the merits of the issue, noting that “[t]he
underlying merits question remains for another day, another case.” Jd. at 58. Moreover, the
defendant in Weingarten did not raise, and the court did not consider, the argument that Congress
