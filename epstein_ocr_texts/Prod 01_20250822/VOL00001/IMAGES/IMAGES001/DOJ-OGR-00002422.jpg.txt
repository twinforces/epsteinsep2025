ARGUMENT.

I. Poorly Worded Questions and Literally Truthful. Responses Cannot Support
a Perjury Prosecution

A. Legal Authority

In'the Second. Circuit; “a perjury conviction which, might have been’based.on questions
that were. ambiguous or on.responsés that were literally truthful may not be sustained.” United
States v. Lighte, 782.F.2d,367, 369 (2d Gir. 1986). The Lighte panel reversed a perjury
conviction, holding that some of the questions giving rise to the, allegedly perjurious testimony.
77. “When.a, line of questioning jis so vague as to be ‘fundamentally ambiguous,” the answers
associated with the questions ‘posed may be ‘insufficient.as a!matter of law‘to support the perjury:
conviction.” Jd. .at.375.(quoting United. States v.. Wolfson, 437 F.2d.862, 878 (2d Cir..1970)).

Where ambiguity exists on the questioner’s part, the test is whether the question, as the
declarant, objectively understood it, 1s falsely answered. Perjury does not exist by implication.

A jury should not.be:permitted to engage in conjecture of whether any-unresponsive

answer, true and complete on its face, was intended to ‘mislead or divert the

examiner; the state of mind,.of the witness is relevant only tothe extent that it bears
Bronston,.%. United States, 409 U.S. 352, 358-60 (1973); seé also United. States. Sainz,.772- F.2d,
559, 564 (9th Cir. 1985) (declarant's testimony cannot be perjurious when.declarant made to
gucss. at question's meaning); United States v. Corbin, 734 F.2d, 643, 654 (11th, Cir. 1984)

(questioning cannot be'vague or ill-defined); Waited States. Tonelli, 577 F.2d 194, 199-200 (3d
