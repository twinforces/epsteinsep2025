Toussie, 397 U.S, at 11.5 (quoting Scharton, 285 U.S, at 522), As one court recognized in
declining to extend a criminal statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct, if Landgraf and
Toussie. “are read in. conjunction,” courts “mustinterpret the statute of limitations in.a manner.
favoring repose for Defendant.” United States v: Gentile, 235 °F. Supp. 3d 649, 655 (D:N.J.
