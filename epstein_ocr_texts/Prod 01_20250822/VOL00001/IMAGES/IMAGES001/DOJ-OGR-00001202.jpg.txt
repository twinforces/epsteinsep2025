WILLIAM JULIE
AVOCAT A LA COUR
December 18, 2020, Paris.
Response to the government’s memorandum in opposition to the defendant’s renewed
motion for release.
I was asked to review the United States government’s memorandum and notably pages 15 to
17 alongside the French Minister of Justice’s letter dated 11 December 2020 produced as
Exhibit B to this memorandum.
1 The French Minister of Justice’s letter (Exhibit B)
The letter of the French Minister of Justice, on which the US government relies to argue that
the French government does not extradite its citizens outside the European Union and thus to
the United States, quotes Article 696-2 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure, which
provides that France can extradite "any person not having French nationality”.
It remains unclear whether the author of such letter had actually access to my opinion which is
not even quoted, and more generally it seems the letter responds to a question which
unexpectedly was not disclosed.
The letter fails to mention, however, that Article 696 of the same Code provides that provisions
of the French Code of Criminal Procedure on the conditions of extradition apply in the absence
of an international agreement providing otherwise (Article 696 of the French Code of
Criminal Procedure: “Jn the absence of an international agreement stipulating otherwise, the
conditions, procedure and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this
chapter'. These provisions shall also apply to matters which would not have been regulated by
international conventions”). The provisions of Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal
Procedure are a reminder that under Article 55 of the French Constitution, international
agreements prevail over national legislation (Article 55 of the French Constitution: “Treaties
or agreements that have been duly ratified or approved have, upon their publication, an
authority superior to that of laws, subject, for each agreement or treaty, to its application by
the other party’). It follows from these provisions that the key question is whether France may
extradite a French national under the Extradition Treaty between the USA and France and/or
under the Extradition Treaty between the European Union and the USA, not whether France
extradites its citizens under French legislation.
In accordance with this French constitutional rule, the administrative circular of 11 March 2004,
published by the French Ministry of Justice, which aims at specifying how the then recently
amended legal provisions regarding extradition should apply and be understood, states the
following: “Article 696 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reaffirms this principle of
' The relevant chapter includes Articles 696-1 to Article 696-47-1 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure,
and thus includes Article 696-2.
