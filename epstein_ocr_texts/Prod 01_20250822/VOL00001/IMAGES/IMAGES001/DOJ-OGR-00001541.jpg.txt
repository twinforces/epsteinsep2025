time will save time and effort upon entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements
established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be
allowed to enter the courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at

As discussed in the Court’s previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the proceeding.
See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form (either personally or, in
accordance with Standing Order 20-MC-174 of March 27, 2020, by defense counsel), defense
counsel shall file the executed form at least 24 hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the
Defendant consents, but counsel is unable to obtain or affix the Defendant’s signature on the
form, the Court will conduct an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is
appropriate for the Court to add the Defendant’s signature to the form.

Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1), the Government must “make their best efforts to see
that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the rights” provided to them in that section.

This includes “[t]he right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court

proceeding . . . involving the crime or of any release . . . of the accused” and “[t]he right to be

reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release.” Jd. §

3771(a)(2), (4). The Court will inquire with the Government as to the extent of those efforts. So

that appropriate logistical arrangements can be made, the Government shall inform the Court by
