than impeachment, many. of them, are’procurable from the Government and are thus improper
‘subjects: ofa Rule 17(¢) subpoena, as explained, below..

Requests .2 through.5 also: seck communications from 201.5 through the present between.
BSF, its co-counsel, and:the U.S. Attorney about Jean Lue Brunel, who is presently incarccrated.
in Franee on charges of sex: crimes and is one of Jeffrey Epstein and the Defendant’s
co-conspirators. But Bruncl does not appear, to be relevant-to any of the Government’s charges in,
the indictment in this case, and, again, Communications ‘from 2015 are not:relevant to conduct'that:
occurred, between 1994 and 1997. ‘The, Defendant thus. secks these. communications, too, so ‘that.
she can fish for impeachment materials.

Requests 6.and 7'seck contingency fee agreements.or engagement letters between. BSF and,
Annie Farmer and. her sister, Maria Farmer. Such documents are irrelevant. The: fact that. the
Farmers are ‘represented, and the terms, of their :rcprescntation, is not.:televant to ‘whether the
Defendant.committed ‘the crimes of which. she is accused. Even. the impeachment: value of such
documents is speculative. Maria-Farmer:is not onc of'the-minor victims described.in:the:indictment,
and thus may not be called to testify in this:case. And in sccking to determine whether BSF ‘has
contingency. fee arrangements with the Farmers, the Defendant appears to seck to establish, some
motive of BSF to:drum up contingency fees by convincing women'to falscly accuse the Defendant.
of criminal conduct. But BS/'s motive. for representing the Farmers:would.not.be relevant to the
Farmers’ motives for testifying for the prosecution, (if they testify).

Request:9 sccks the original, complete copy of Annie Farmer’s journal from’when-she was
a'tecnager for inspection and copying. But all potentially relevant pages. were produced from this
journal to the. Defendant in civil discovery: i in.another matter, as demonstrated by: the Defendant’s
ability to attach those ‘pages as’ Exhibit:.A, to the: Subpoena. The: remainder, of the Journal. has
nothing to do with the Defendant or Jeffrey Epstein. And the Defendant cannot, inspect it for the
purpose of fishing for somcthing' that could be! potentially relevant=it is, her burden to identify’
‘relévant and admissible evidence under Nixon. The Defendant also clearly sccks to‘use the journal
for. impeachment purposes, as she: highlighted in a. prior filing i ina. recently: dismissed. civil action.
Ms. Farmer filed. against the Defendant. See‘Letter from.L. Menninger to-Hon. Debra GC. Freeman.

uncomfortable. This same. diary contained exactly zéo réeferenées to Ghislaine Maxwell, contrary

Request | 2 for“ever Material” isn not relevant-to'the Defendant's defense: BS. Pisubmitted,
several Epstein s survivors who have :not anade separate: élaims apainst Maxwell, ‘The Defendant
must demonstrate the relevance of. all the evidence she secks by means of a‘Rule:17(c) subpoena,
not merely that she could turn up something that is relevant and admissible. See Pena, 2016 WL
