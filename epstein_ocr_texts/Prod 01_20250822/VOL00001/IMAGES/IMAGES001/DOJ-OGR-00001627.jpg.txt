Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 22 Filed 07/13/20 Page 17 of 19
applications in view of the applicable factors under the Bail Reform Act. This Court should reach
the same conclusion based on the extraordinary risk of flight described in detail above.

The defendant’s argument that bail is required for her to prepare her defense is equally
unpersuasive. Judges in this district have repeatedly held that the current restrictions on inmate
access to counsel do not warrant releasing defendants who should otherwise be detained under the
Bail Reform Act. See United States v. Tolentino, 20 Cr. 007 (DLC), 2020 WL 1862670, at *2
(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2020); United States v. Adamu, 18 Cr. 601 (PGG), 2020 WL 1821717, at *6
(Apr. 10, 2020); United States v. Brito, 20 Cr. 63 (PGG), 2020 WL 2521458, at *5-6 (S.D.N.Y.
May 17, 2020); United States v. Ellison, 18 Cr. 834 (PAE), 2020 WL 1989301, at *1-2 (S.D.N.Y.
Apr. 27), United States v. Melamed, No. 19 Cr. 443 (LAK), 2020 WL 1644205, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.
Apr. 2, 2020); United States v. Pena, No. 18 Cr. 640 (RA), 2020 WL 1674007, at *1 (S.D.N.Y.
Apr. 6, 2020). Just last week, a district judge in the Eastern District of New York denied bail to a
defendant who argued that restricted access to his counsel at the MDC required his release, while
noting the volume of decisions reaching the same conclusion. United States v. Shipp, No. 19 Cr.
299 (NGG), 2020 WL 3642856, *3-4 (E.D.N.Y. July 6, 2020) (collecting cases).

This Court’s decision in Stephens does not compel a different result here. In that case, this
Court concluded that bail was necessary in order to permit the defendant to prepare for a significant
hearing, which was scheduled for six days later. United States v. Stephens, No. 15 Cr. 95 (AJN),
2020 WL 1295155, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 19, 2020) (finding that the limitations on the defendant’s
access to counsel “impacts the Defendant’s ability to prepare his defenses to the alleged violation
of supervised release in advance of the merits hearing scheduled for March 25, 2020.”). By
contrast, no evidentiary hearings have been requested, much less scheduled, in this case, and a trial
date has not yet been set. See United States v. Gonzalez, No. 19 Cr. 906 (JMF), 2020 WL 1911209,
