1 to those that are offered.

2 So let me be as clear as I can.

S THE COURT: You might as well know what I'm thinking.
4 So respectfully, I don't think that the financial summary tells
5 me anything really. For one thing, it's some unverified list

6 of assets, not audited, not certified, and not very detailed

7 either.

8 Mr. Epstein may be unusual, but there are no

9 obligations, for example, no debts, no expenses. That,

10 depending on if that's true -- maybe he's debt free and

11 obligation free. But that would impact whatever the list of

12 assets were if that were known too.

13 It seems to me you have to know a -â€”- there needs to be
14 a fuller financial picture to know what would be appropriate.
15 MR. WEINBERG: Let me be blunt. It was our first

16 effort, and I am authorized to say to the Court that whatever
17 bond you want Mr. Epstein to sign, whether it's $100 million or
18 an amount close to the amount of the assets that we have

19 provided, Mr. Epstein is prepared to sign it.
20 He intends to appear. Once he appears, the prejudice
21 of a large bond is extinguished. He's met its conditions. The
22 same with collateral. Whatever collateral your Honor believes
23 would disincentivize him -- again, it's a temporary lien on
24 property that would be extinguished upon his appearance in
25 court, and he fully intends to appear.
