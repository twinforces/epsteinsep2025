It. seems to me you. have to know a -- there needs to be

a fuller financial picture to know what, would be appropriate,

MR. WEINBERG: Let. me be blunt. It was our first

effort, and I am authorized to say to the Court. that whdtever

bond you want Mr. Epstéin to Sign, whether it's $100 million or

of a large bond is extinguished. He's mét, its conditidns. The

same with collateral. Whatever collateral your Honor believes

would disincentivize him -- again, it's a temporary lien on

property that would be extinguished upon his appearance in

court, and he fully intends to appéar.
