by statutes whose retroactive application, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post.facto,

nevertheless would run afoul of “familiar considerations of. fair notice, reasonable:reliance, and

settled expectations.””) Thus, in the criminal.context, the second step of'Landgraf should be read
‘as providing protections broader than simply violations of the Ex Post Facto Clause, and as
prohibiting-rctroactive application of a criminal statute of limitations—and the resulting
expansion of an individual’s exposure to criminal liability for completed conduct—even-where
the charge is not time-barred at: the time-of the amendment.

Statutes of limitations “applicable to criminal prosecutions are designed principally: to
protect individuals from having to defend themselves against charges supported by facts that arc
remote in' time.” United States v. Riverd-Ventura, 72 F.3d 277, 281 (2d Cir. 1995). That.
concern.is heightened here, where the government seeks. to rely-on the retroactive extension of'a
criminal, statute of limitations to prosecute a. case based on conduct more than, two decades old,
with little, if any, evidence other than witness. testimony. Sée Torssié, 397 U.S. at 115
(observing that-statute of limitations “may also haye ‘the salutary effect: of encouraging law
enforcement officials promptly to investigate suspected criminal activity”). Since:the time of the
alleged conduct, memories have become faded or corrupted, documents have been lost. or
destroyed, and witnesses have died, all to the extreme prejudice of Ms. Maxwell.” Retroactively:
applying the 2003 Amendment here not only would fly in the face of congressional. intent; it

would violate all notions of fundamental -fairness.°

° In Weingarten, the:court:stated that ifthe defendant’s counsel had successfully persuaded the:trial court;that:the
2003 Amendment could not retroactively-extend the statute of limitations. for live charges, the trial court’s:holding
would-have’been in.direct:conflict:with the’Ninth Circuit’s:opinion in ‘Cnited, States v. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F73d 920
(9th Cir. 2006). But in. Leo Sure Chief, the alleged victim had not, yet-reached age 25 as:of the timcrof the
indictment, and thus the-charges would not have been.time-barred under cither-version of § 3283. ‘Thus, the-court:in
