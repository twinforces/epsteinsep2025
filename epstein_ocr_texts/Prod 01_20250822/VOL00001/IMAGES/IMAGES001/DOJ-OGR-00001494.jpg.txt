Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 8 of 10

In addition, the defendant appears to have access to significant financial resources that
would enable her flight from prosecution. Based on the Government’s investigation to date, the
Government has identified more than 15 different bank accounts held by or associated with the
defendant from 2016 to the present, and during that same period, the total balances of those
accounts have ranged from a total of hundreds of thousands of dollars to more than $20
million. During the same period, the defendant engaged in transfers between her accounts of
hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time, including at least several such significant transfers as
recently as 2019. For example, the defendant transferred $500,000 from one of her accounts to
another in March 2019, and transferred more than $300,000 from one of her accounts to another
in July 2019. She has also reported, including as recently as 2019, that she holds one or more
foreign bank accounts containing more than a million dollars.

The defendant also appears to have reaped substantial income from a 2016 property sale.
In particular, in 2016, the defendant appears to have sold a New York City residence for $15
million through a limited liability company. On or about the date of the sale, amounts totaling
more than $14 million were then deposited into an account for which the defendant was listed as
the owner. Several days later, more than $14 million was transferred from that account into
another account opened in the name of the defendant.” In short, the defendant’s financial resources
appear to be substantial, and her numerous accounts and substantial money movements render her
total financial picture opaque and indeterminate, even upon a review of bank records available to
the Government.
> The Government additionally notes that, somewhat further back in time, in transactions occurring
between 2007 and 2011, approximately more than $20 million was transferred from accounts
associated with Jeffrey Epstein to accounts associated with the defendant, including amounts in
the millions of dollars that were then subsequently transferred back to accounts associated with
Epstein.
