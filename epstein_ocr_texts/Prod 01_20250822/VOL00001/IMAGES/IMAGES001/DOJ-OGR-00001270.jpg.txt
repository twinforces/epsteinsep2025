AVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW

17. This concern over opportunistic nationality applications is precisely the justification of
the rule mentioned in academic literature (see for example Répertoire de droit pénal et
de procédure pénale Extradition Pén. — Conditions de fond de l'extradition —
Delphine Brach-Thiel-October 2018, §59).

18. Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents
and case law

19. The French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case
can be found where Article 696-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure was applied
to protect a formerly French national from extradition.

of the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2006, n°05-86.258).

21. Although we have found no precedent where French authorities were faced with the

French authorities were faced with the deportation of a person who had lost French
nationality. Both extradition and deportation allow for the removal of a person from
French territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third State, with
the consent and cooperation of the authorities of that State.

22. The European Court of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”’) treats extradition and deportation
analogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars
apply to all types of removal of a person from the territory of a State party (“the Court
considers that the question whether there is a real risk of treatment contrary to Article
3 in another State cannot depend on the legal basis for removal to that State. The
Court’s own case-law has shown that, in practice, there may be little difference between
