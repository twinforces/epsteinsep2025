‘always had friends and seemed.to be genuinely arounded i in 1 her love of life and: learning, We
were all, quite: proud when she graduated ‘from, Oxtford;with her Bachelor's degree. She,
learned carly on the value of hard work

Around 1990, Ghislaine came to live in New. Y ork: to continue

in 199.1, Ghislaine had to rely.on her-personal
‘compass, inner. resilience and sheer. determination to build a fresh. life for herself? Her prior
‘big. picture" experience, top-level. entertaining skills and talent for organizing, coupled with
her multi-cultural, and multi-lingual sophistication, opened doors into’New: York'society.
Although itis true that ‘for many years ‘Ghislaine, was ‘frequentlyinvolved in high society ‘and
attended. fashionable social gatherings; what:irks me greatly is the press’s one dimensional

‘socialite’ focus on.Ghislaine, that: completely: denies and refuses to acknowledge the very:

Notwithstanding the seriousness, of the offerises with’which. she has been charged, as a US
