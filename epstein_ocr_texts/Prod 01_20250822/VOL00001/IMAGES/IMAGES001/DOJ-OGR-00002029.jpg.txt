always had friends and seemed to be genuinely grounded in her love of life and learning. We
were all quite proud when she graduated from Oxford with her Bachelor's degree. She,
learned early on the value of hard work
Around 1990, Ghislaine came to live in New York to continue
Maxwell Corporate Gifts, a successful company she had founded in the UK which was
ee in 1991, Ghislaine had to rely on her personal
compass, inner resilience and sheer determination to build a fresh life for herself. Her prior
‘big picture’ experience, top-level entertaining skills and talent for organizing, coupled with
her multi-cultural and multi-lingual sophistication, opened doors into New York society.
Although it is true that for many years Ghislaine was frequently involved in high society and
attended fashionable social gatherings; what irks me greatly is the press’s one dimensional
‘socialite’ focus on Ghislaine, that completely denies and refuses to acknowledge the very
serious, highly intellectual and passionate caring sides of Ghislaine. For example, since 2003,
Ghislaine devoted all her energy, her own financial resources and intellectual skills to helping
save the Oceans, through her establishment of the not-for-profit company, The Terramar
Project. Ghislaine's deep knowledge and appreciation of the significant role the oceans play
in our world’s fragile ecosystem enabled her to work with key partners to influence the
United Nations in 2014 in enunciating its Sustainable Development Goal 15 "To conserve
and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development."
Indeed, it seemed so clear to me that this mission encompassed her life's passion and offered
a way for her proactively to give something back of real value to society.
Ghislaine showed a huge amount of courage and forbearance in the face of great adversity
and in the years that followed. I have seen this strength more than ever
during the times
Despite the tremendous daily pressures she has been under, notably from the world’s media,
universally hostile to her, she has shown simultaneously a deal of humility and fortitude. She
has the profoundly deep conviction (through every fibre of her being) of her innocence in the
face of all the unsupported accusations and criminal charges latterly filed against her.
To the best of my knowledge and belief, [| Ghislaine has never been brought in for
questioning, arrested, or charged with any criminal offense by law enforcement until now.
Notwithstanding the seriousness of the offenses with which she has been charged, as a US
Citizen, she has the constitutional right to the presumption of innocence and a fair trial. For
the purpose of increasing their profits by boosting TV ratings and / or newspaper readership,
the world’s media has aired or printed the most heinous accusations against her, in some
cases for years now, that have never been cross-examined in a criminal court in front of an
