Clerk

Supreme Court of the United States

Washington, D.C. 20543

Re: Ghislaine Maxwell v. United States, No. 24-1073
Dear Mr. Harris:

The petition for a writ of certiorari in the above-captioned case was filed on April 10,
2025, and placed on the docket on April 14, 2025. The government’s response is now due, after
one extension, on June 13, 2025. We respectfully request, under Rule 30.4 of the Rules of this
Court, a further extension of time to and including July 14, 2025, within which to file the
government’s response.

This extension is necessary because the attorneys with principal responsibility for
preparation of the government’s response have been heavily engaged with the press of
previously assigned matters with proximate due dates.

Counsel for petitioner does not oppose this further extension.

Sincerely,
D. John Sauer
Solicitor General
