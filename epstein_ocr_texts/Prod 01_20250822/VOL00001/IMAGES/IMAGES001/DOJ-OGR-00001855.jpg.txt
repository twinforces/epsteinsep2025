Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20. Cr. 330 (ASN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this letter in response
‘to: the Court’s order, dated November 25, 2020, directing’ Ms. Maxwell to justify why her letter:
ofthe same date réquésting an 7”, camera conference. to discuss. confidentiality concerns related.
to"her Renewed Motion for Release on. Bail.(the “Motion”’) should. be sealed or redacted.

We continue'to believe that sealing the November 25, 2020 letter (the “November 25""
Letter”) in its entirety’ is warranted, and, appropriate’ ‘under, the governing:case law. However, in,
response to the Court’s. order, We ask the Courtto file a rédacted version. of ‘the November 25
Letter, attached hereto. as Exhibit A, which redacts only the information necessary to protect
third parties from. threats and harassment, In, addition, because this fetter must t make reference to
proposed redactions, w we e further ask the Court to > filea redacted v version n of this, letter, attached. < as
Exhibit B. lf the. Court is not inclined to allow any of these redactions, ° we e request, leave to

Every submission, related to the Motion, including this letter, ‘presents the defense with a.
Catch-22. To. support Ms. Maxwell’s position regarding sealing and confidentiality, we are
asked to provide 'the Court with. specific: information about the people supporting Ms. Maxwell’s
bail application. and.the need for sealing. But until ‘we know what confidentiality protections 'the
Court is willing to put in place, we: are: obligated to protect. these: people: from the potentially
devastating consequences of” being publicly identified. by divulging as little information about
them.as possible. We therefore continue to. believe'that; an in.cumeru, conference, attended. by all
counsel, ‘is the best way to,address all of the confidentiality issues related to the Motion.
