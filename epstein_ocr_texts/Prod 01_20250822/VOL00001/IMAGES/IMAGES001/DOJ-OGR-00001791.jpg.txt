B. The Government’s Plan for Obtaining and Reviewing Certain Files from the
Florida Investigation

As an initial matter, beginning during the course of its investigation, the Government has
obtained the entirety of the FBI Florida Office’s case file from the Florida Investigation. The
Government has already made productions from that file, is continuing to review that file, and
intends to produce at the appropriate point any additional material in that file warranting disclosure
in this case. That file includes, among other things, any FBI-302 of any relevant witness interview;
any relevant materials obtained pursuant to federal grand jury subpoena as part of that
investigation; and any relevant material seized during a search of Epstein’s Palm Beach residence
conducted as part of that investigation. The Government believes the FBI file contains
substantially all of the prior witness statements made during the Florida Investigation, including,
if applicable, any prior statements made by witnesses the Government intends to call at trial in this
case,

In total, the Government has identified six potential sources of material related to the
Florida Investigation, and has been requesting and reviewing materials from those sources as
follows:

First, the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) opened its investigation into Jeffrey
Epstein in or about 2005. During the course of that investigation, the PBPD, among other things,
conducted numerous witness interviews, issued multiple subpoenas for documents,* and executed
a search warrant at Epstein’s Palm Beach Residence. In or about 2006, the PBPD referred its
investigation to the FBI Florida Office. It is the Government’s understanding that the PBPD
provided its entire investigative file to the FBI Florida Office. As discussed above, the Prosecution
Team already has a copy of the full FBI Florida Office file and, as such, has been reviewing and
will continue to review the PBPD file for any material that warrants disclosure in this case.
Additionally, the Government has contacted the Records Specialist at the PBPD, who informed
the Government that the PBPD has no additional investigative files beyond what it already
provided to the FBI Florida Office. Out of an abundance of caution, however, the Government
asked the Records Specialist to provide the Prosecution Team with a copy of the files still in
PBPD’s possession related to the Florida Investigation. In response, the PBPD Records Specialist
provided the Government with 60 pages of documents, which the Prosecution Team reviewed for
any material that is non-duplicative and warrants disclosure in this case. The Prosecution Team
has identified five of those pages as non-duplicative and intends to produce those five pages as
part of its next discovery production to the defense.

Second, the Palm Beach State’s Attorney’s Office (the “PBSA”), working with the PBPD,
among other agencies, handled the Florida state investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein
between approximately 2005 and 2010 (when Epstein completed his sentence). As a result of that
investigation and prosecution, Epstein pled guilty to procuring an underage girl for prostitution
and soliciting a prostitute. Prior to September 14, 2020, the Prosecution Team had never received
any documents directly from the PBSA and did not have the PBSA’s full investigative file.
* As detailed below, these subpoenas were issued by the Palm Beach State’s Attorney’s Office.
