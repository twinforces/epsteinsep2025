B. The Government’s Plan for Obtaining _and_Revicwing Certain Files from the,
Florida. Investigation

AS an initial matter, beginning during the course of its investigation, the Government. has
obtained the entirety of the FBI. Florida Office’s. case file from the: Florida Investigation. ‘The:
Government has already made: productions from that file, is continuing to review that filc, and.
intends to produce at the appropriate*point any. additional material in that file warranting disclosure
in,this, case. ‘That-file includes, among other things, any FBI-302, of any relevant witness intervicw;
any relevant. materials obtained. pursuant to fedéral grand. jury subpocna as part of that.
investigation; and any rclevant:material, scized during,a scarch of Epstcin’s Palm Beach residence
conducted. as part. of that investigation. ‘The: Government: ‘believes ‘the FBI file contains
substantially’ all of the prior witness statements made during’ the Florida. Investigation, including,
if-'applicable, any’prior statements made’by witnesses the Government.intends to call,at-trial in this
case.

In.total,. the Government. has identified six potential ‘sources. of material ‘rclated to the
Florida, Investigation, and has’ been requesting and reviewing materials from those sourecs' as
follows:

First, the Palm. Beach Police. Department (“PBPD”) opened. its investigation, into Jeffrey
Epstein.in or about 2005. -During, the course ofthat. investigation, the PBPD, among other things,
conducted:numerous witness interviews, issued multiple: subpoenas for documents" and executed.
‘a, search warrant at Epstcin’s Palm Beach Residence. In or about: 2006, the PBPD referred, its
investigation to the FBI Florida Office. It. is the 'Government’s, understanding’ that. the PBPD
provided its ciitire:investigative. file to the FBI Florida Office. As discussed above, the.Prosccution.
‘Team already has-a. copy. of the full FBI Florida. Office file and, as:such, has been reviewing and
will, continue to reyiew the PBPD file for any material that warrants disclosure jin this case.
Additionally, the Government. has contacted the: Records Specialist at the PBPD, who informed.
the Government: that. the PBPD. has ‘no additional ‘investigative files beyond. what it already’
‘provided to the FBI Florida Office. Out of an abundance of caution, however, the Government.
asked the Records Specialist to provide the Prosecution Team with a copy: of the files still in.
PBPD’s possession related tothe Florida Investigation. In response, 'the PBPD Records Specialist
provided the Government with 60 pages of documents, which the Prosecution ‘Team reviewed for
any material ‘that is non-duplicative and warrants disclosure, in, this ease. The Prosceution, Team,
has identified five of those pages as non-duplicative and intends to, produce ‘those five pages as

Second, the Palm Beach State’s Attorney’s Office (the “PBSA”), working with the PBPD,
among other agencies, handled the Florida state investigation, and, prosecution. of Jeffrey Epstein,
between approximately 2005 and.2010 (when Epstein completed his sentence). As a:result of that
investigation and ‘prosecution, Epstcin pled. guilty to procuring, an. underage girl for prostitution.
and soliciting a prostitute. Prior to September 14, 2020, the Prosecution Team had.never received.
any documents directly from the: PBSA. and. did not have: the PBSA’s' full investigative filc.

* As detailed below, these subpoenas were issued by the Palm.Beach State’s Attorney’s Office.
