A. Extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the United States
The extradition arrangements

3. Extradition relations between the United Kingdom and the United States of America are governed by
an extradition treaty signed on 31 March 2003°, which is given effect in the domestic law of the
United Kingdom‘ by the 2003 Act”.

Overview of the extradition process

4. The United States of America has been designated as a ‘Part 2 territory’ (also referred to as a
‘Category 2 territory’) for the purposes of the 2003 Act®. The effect of this designation is that
extradition requests from the United States fall to be considered under Part 2 of the 2003 Act’, and the
United States is exempted from the requirement to provide evidence sufficient to make a case to
answer against the requested person (‘the prima facie case requirement’).

5. Once a valid’ request for extradition is made by a Part 2 territory, the Secretary of State must, subject
to very limited exceptions’ not applicable here, issue a certificate under section 70. Once a certificate
is issued, the Secretary of State must send the request and certificate to the appropriate judge. In
practice, it is extremely rare for the Secretary of State to refuse to issue a certificate under section 70.

6. Under Part 2 of the 2003 Act, a requested person may be arrested pursuant to either a full extradition
request'’, or a provisional request pending the service of a full extradition request'”. In both cases,
there is an ‘initial hearing’ at which the requested person is produced before ‘the appropriate judge’!
