seeking millions of dollars from a fund that's béing Sét up.
Semething for the court to consider,

She has also, as, we mentioned, rémaiined in the United

States, even though she has known of the investigation. How
could shé not? Tt's been wnbeliéevably public for ‘the past
year, And we have been in. regular contact with her -- with the
government. Your Honor asked ‘that question, very careful

question from the court, and we got a shimmy from the

government in response, We have been ih Gohtact with them,
conservatavely -- as we checked, Last. night, because we thought
you might. ask == Gohservatively eight to teh tities in the past
year, all. for the same purpose, to urge them not, to bring this
case, which shouldn't. have béén brought.

The notion that. experienced counsel, and counsel. at.
Haddon Morgan i8 also experienced, is ih regular Gontact with
the government, would surrender their client, and they turn
around and deny that to the cdéurt. ahd deny that vdéluntary
surrender would and, could have and should have been possible
here is; we submit, another factor for the court to consider.

SQ let me turn to the reply brief.

THE GOURT: Sorry, If I tay, Mr. Cohen, I just want.
to make sune I understand ‘that ,Jast point. Are you saying that

defense counsel indicated to the government that; should there

be an indictment returned, ‘you were seeking to arrange a

voluntary surrender? Is that the contention?
