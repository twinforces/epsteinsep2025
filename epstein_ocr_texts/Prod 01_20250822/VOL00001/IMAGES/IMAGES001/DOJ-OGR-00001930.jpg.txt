1 seeking millions of dollars from a fund that's being set up.

2 Something for the court to consider.

3 She has also, as we mentioned, remained in the United
4 States, even though she has known of the investigation. How

a could she not? It's been unbelievably public for the past

6 year. And we have been in regular contact with her -- with the
7 government. Your Honor asked that question, very careful

8 question from the court, and we got a shimmy from the

9 government in response. We have been in contact with them,

10 conservatively -- as we checked last night, because we thought
11 you might ask -- conservatively eight to ten times in the past
12 year, all for the same purpose, to urge them not to bring this
13 case, which shouldn't have been brought.

14 The notion that experienced counsel, and counsel at

15 Haddon Morgan is also experienced, is in regular contact with
16 the government, would surrender their client, and they turn

17 around and deny that to the court and deny that voluntary

18 surrender would and could have and should have been possible

19 here is, we submit, another factor for the court to consider.
20 So let me turn to the reply brief.
21 THE COURT: Sorry. If I may, Mr. Cohen, I just want
22 to make sure I understand that last point. Are you saying that
23 defense counsel indicated to the government that, should there
24 be an indictment returned, you were seeking to arrange a
25 voluntary surrender? Is that the contention?
