see in. a moment, that explains a lot of the spin the government
iS putting on facts inh, this casé:

Your Honor, people have received physical threats. My

Client has received them. Most 6f those Glosé to Her Have

received them. They have received death threats. They have
beén injured in their jobs, in, théir work opportunities, in
their reputations, simply for knowing my client, It's real.
It's 6ut theré. The facts of all the steps the court, had to go
through just to make the ‘public access avaitdable to this
proceeding is als6 a reality:

There is a real thing out thene having a very
significant impact on our ¢liént. There are folks who would
normally come forward as part of a, baal package who your Honor
1S aware of from the Pretrial Services réport. whe can't now; at
least. at, this point, because of the safety and confidentiality

céncerns. Since last. week our firm alone and my Golléagués at

Haddon, Morgan have been besieged with e-mails and posts, some
of them threatening. This is. all very real. The government
attempt:s tq poo-pog it, to give it the back of the hand. It is
very real, and we submit it is a fatto6r for the court. to
consider in its discret.ion,.

Before I. go further; your Honor; I would like to go
through the 3142(g) analysis. But before I do that, I would

‘like to make one comment about the CVR --. CVRA proceeding under
