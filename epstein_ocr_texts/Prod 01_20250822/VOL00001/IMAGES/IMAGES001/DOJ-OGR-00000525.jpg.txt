Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 15 of 74 13

1 It does not include a list of accounts. It does not

2 include a list of financial institutions. It does not identify
3 what types of currencies the defendant holds. It does nothing
4 to identify the location of his holdings. It does nothing to

5 identify high-value property such as diamonds or art, both of

6 which were observed in abundance in just the government's

7 search of his Manhattan mansion.

8 The other thing, your Honor, is we're just relying on
9 the defendant's word for all of this. This is not sworn. It's
10 not under penalty of perjury. There are no account statements.
11 There are no bank records. There is nothing to validate this.
12 That's not to say that if this were validated, that

13 this would somehow rise to the level of being granted bail, but
14 it's notable with respect to the presumption in particular and
15 also with respect to how the Court evaluates the defendant's

16 assets that we are relying on him.

17 The defendant's financial disclosure form should alarm
18 the Court, your Honor, not give it comfort that there are

19 conditions that would keep the defendant from fleeing and
20 prevent him from being a danger.
21 With respect to the proposed package, the defendant
22 proposes the Court accept his Manhattan mansion as security for
23 a bond. Now, the government has already designated that
24 property for seizure making it worthless to the defendant. He
25 proposes cosigners who couldn't possibly secure a package
