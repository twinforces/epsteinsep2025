The National Association of Criminal Defense
Lawyers (NACDL) is a nonprofit voluntary professional
bar association that works on behalf of criminal defendants
to ensure justice and due process for those accused of
erime or misconduct. Founded in 1958, NACDL has a
nationwide membership of thousands of direct members
and up to 40,000 affiliates. NACDLâ€™s members include
private criminal defense lawyers, public defenders,
military defense counsel, law professors, and judges.
NACDLi is the only nationwide professional bar association
for public defenders and criminal defense lawyers.

NACDL is dedicated to advancing the proper, efficient,
and fair administration of justice. NACDL files numerous
amicus briefs each year in this Court and other federal and
state courts, seeking to provide assistance in cases that
present issues of broad importance to criminal defendants,
criminal defense lawyers, and the criminal justice system
as a whole. Given their prevalence, the interpretation
of plea agreements is a question of great importance to
NACDL and the clients its members represent. NACDL
is well positioned to provide additional insight into the
implications of this issue for criminal defendants across
the country.
