law of the Statute, by its structtire, favors rélease. The
Supreme Court has. and the Second Circuit has advised us that a
very limited number of people shotild be détatinéd ‘prior to ‘trial
because of the statute's structure, and the government nowhere

mentiions that. Tt basically acts. as if all it has to do is

invoke the presumption. ‘on the client and then we are done, and
that's jist not the legal standing, your Honor.

They al'iso say nothing about the burden, which is
discussed on a case written f6r the Second Circuit by Judge
Raggi, and also the U.S. v. English case. Without going into a
1l6t of detail, as the court is aware, the burden 6f persuasion
is the government's. It, never shifts. The presumption can be
rebutted, and we submit it is here, and theh it is the burden
flight and that there are no Gonditions or combination of

conditions to secure the release, which we submit they haven't

done here.
Sq Let me turn, your Honor, if IL may, to ‘the factors
under 3142(g)., and before I dé that; I also want to déddress

some of the government's comments about the bail package. We
decided that wé should come before your Hé6nor with a package

that, was set out subject, of course, to the ruling provided, by
the court, subject of course to verification as to suretors by

Pretrial Services and the court. We didn't want to just walk

in, and say, Judge, we should be entitled to bail; please set
