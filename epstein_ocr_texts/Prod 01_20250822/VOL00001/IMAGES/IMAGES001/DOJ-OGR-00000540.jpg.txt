Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36-_ Filed 07/24/19 Page 30 of 74 au

1 THE COURT: Is that the Fiaro (phonetic) case?

2 MR. WEINBERG: Yes, your Honor. Again, today is not
5 the day to be arguing Rule 29 issues or even the construction

4 and scope of the statute. But I think lots of the detentions

5 are for your guintessential traffickers.

6 And I understand we don't have consent and, therefore,
7 the government substitutes that language. But this is not

8 quintessential commercial sex trafficking to third parties for
9 profit.

10 But more important or as important, if I can say that,
11 the presumption is rebuttable. Even in those cases that

12 your Honor listed, the statute contemplates that some 1591

13 defendants will be released under conditions, and I believe

14 that the rebuttal to the presumption -- one is the danger

15 prong; one is the flight prong. If I can address them

16 separately.

17 THE COURT: Sure.

18 MR. WEINBERG: I apologize if I'm using the time.

19 THE COURT: No. You have the right.
20 MR. WEINBERG: Thank you, Judge.
21 THE COURT: I think that is interesting. So those
22 prongs have different burdens of proof for one thing, clear and
23 convincing in one instance and preponderance in the other.
24 It's either/or or both one could find. But if one
25 found one of those, either a danger to the community or flight
