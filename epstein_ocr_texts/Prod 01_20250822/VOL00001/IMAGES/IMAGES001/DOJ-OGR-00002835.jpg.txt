*8 (“The absolute disparity. method, on.the other hafid, appears to be the preferred method for
:
analyzing jury underrépresentation under the Sixth Amendment inthe Second. Circuit.”). The

Court will therefore analyze the underrepresentation inquiry using the absolute disparity method.

The absolute disparity method measures the-.difference between the groups’

representation in the.relevant community and their representation, in the jury'venire. See Rioux,

07 F.3d at 655-56. For example, if Africari.Americans compose 10% of the community but only

5% of the jury venire, the absolute disparity is 5%. See id. Under Second Circuit precedents,
absolute, disparities nearly as high.as 5% have not been found.to satisfy the undetrepresentation

clement under.Duren., See Uniied States vy. Biaggi, 909 F.2d 662, 677-78 (2d Cir. 1990) (holding:

absolute disparities of 3.6% and 4.7% were insufficient to. satisfy Duren’s second element); see

also Rioux, 97 F3d at 658 (1.58% and.2.14% were insufficient); Allen, 2021 WL 431458, *8
(3.69% and 3.64% were insufficient); Barnes, 520 F. Supp. 2d at 515 (2.8% and 2.3% were
insufficient).

The Court holds that the absolute disparities here fall comfortably within the outer limits
provided by these:past decisions. The partics do not dispute that African Americans make up
11:20% and Hispanic Americans make up 12.97% of the White Plains master wheel. (Gov't
Opp. Br. at 20.) In the relevant community, African Americans make up 12.45% and Hispanic
Americans 14,12% of the jury eligible population. (Schulte Reply at'67; Gov’t Opp. Br. at 18.)
Accordingly, the.absolute disparities aré 1.25% for African Americans (12.45% - 11.20%) and
1.15% for Hispanic Americans (14.12% - 12.97%). Because those figures fall comfortably

within the tolerated disparities ii pastprecedents, the Court.concludes that Schulte has not:met
