*8 (“The absolute disparity method, on the other hand, appears to be the preferred method for :
analyzing jury underrepresentation under the Sixth Amendment in the Second Circuit.”). The
Court will therefore analyze the underrepresentation inquiry using the absolute disparity method. |
The absolute disparity method measures the difference between the groups’ !
representation in the relevant community and their representation in the jury venire. See Rioux, :
97 F.3d at 655—56. For example, if African Americans compose 10% of the community but only
5% of the jury venire, the absolute disparity is 5%. See id. Under Second Circuit precedents, |
absolute disparities nearly as high as 5% have not been found to satisfy the underrepresentation
element under Duren. See United States v. Biaggi, 909 F.2d 662, 677-78 (2d Cir. 1990) (holding |
absolute disparities of 3.6% and 4.7% were insufficient to satisfy Duren’s second element); see :
also Rioux, 97 F.3d at 658 (1.58% and 2.14% were insufficient); Allen, 2021 WL 431458, *8 |
(3.69% and 3.64% were insufficient); Barnes, 520 F. Supp. 2d at 515 (2.8% and 2.3% were
insufficient).
The Court holds that the absolute disparities here fall comfortably within the outer limits :
provided by these past decisions. The partics do not dispute that African Americans make up )
11.20% and Hispanic Americans make up 12.97% of the White Plains master wheel. (Gov’t
Opp. Br. at 20.) In the relevant community, African Americans make up 12.45% and Hispanic
Americans 14.12% of the jury eligible population. (Schulte Reply at 6-7, Gov’t Opp. Br. at 18.)
Accordingly, the absolute disparities are 1.25% for African Americans (12.45% - 11.20%) and
1.15% for Hispanic Americans (14.12% - 12.97%). Because those figures fall comfortably
within the tolerated disparities in past precedents, the Court concludes that Schulte has not met
