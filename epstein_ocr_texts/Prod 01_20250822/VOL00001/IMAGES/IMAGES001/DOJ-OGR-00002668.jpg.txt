Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 144 Filed 02/04/21 Page 20 of 25

Jd. Similarly, an “offense involving the sexual. or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child-under
the age of 18 years’ is an offense in which such sexual abuse; physical abuse, or. kidnapping 1s an.
element.of the offense.

The Eighth Circuit concluded as:‘much.in United States v. Coutentos, 651 F.3d.809 (8th
Cir. 201.1). There, the court held that § 3283 didnot apply to a charge of possession. of child
pornography. ./d..at ‘817-18. The court clearly looked.to the elements of the statute, as the facts
of the case did involve the sexual abuse of'a child, including the production and possession.of
child pornography. /d. at.813-14. ‘Yet the court held that, on.the same set. of-facts, the offense of
possession of child pornography did not involve sexual abuse-and thus was:subject to the general
statute of limitations, but the offense of production of child pornography’ did involve sexual.
abuse and-was subject to § 3283: “That-a producer of child pornography will possess it at the
time of the dbuse.is insufficient to. change our view thatthe offense of possessing child
pornography itself does. not involve. an act against a.child, i.e,, the sexual abuse ofa child.” Jd. at
817.

Coutentos demonstrates that the “offense involving” language of § 3283, as ‘with other.
Statutes, requires: the court to. look.to. the elements ofthe offense, rather than the facts ofa.
particular case, to determine: whether a-particular offense “involves” the sexual or physical abuse
or kidnapping of a child. /d. at 817. This approach:makes practical sense: Ifthe applicability of
§ 3283.depended on the facts of'a particular:case, rather-than the elements ofthe offense, the
government: would effectively be:required to prove conduct’beyond.the clements of the
offense—i.e., that sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping occtirred—in order to ‘prove that its

charges are nottime-barred,
