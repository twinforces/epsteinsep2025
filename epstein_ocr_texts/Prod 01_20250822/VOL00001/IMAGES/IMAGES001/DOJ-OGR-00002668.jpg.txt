Id. Similarly, an “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under
the age of 18 years” is an offense in which such sexual abuse, physical abuse, or kidnapping is an
element of the offense.

The Eighth Circuit concluded as much in United States v. Coutentos, 651 F.3d 809 (8th
Cir. 2011). There, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a charge of possession of child
pornography. /d. at 817-18. The court clearly looked to the elements of the statute, as the facts
of the case did involve the sexual abuse of a child, including the production and possession of
child pornography. /d. at 813-14. Yet the court held that, on the same set of facts, the offense of
possession of child pornography did not involve sexual abuse and thus was subject to the general
statute of limitations, but the offense of production of child pornography did involve sexual
abuse and was subject to § 3283: “That a producer of child pornography will possess it at the
time of the abuse is insufficient to change our view that the offense of possessing child
pornography itself does not involve an act against a child, i.e., the sexual abuse of a child.” Jd. at
817.

Coutentos demonstrates that the “offense involving” language of § 3283, as with other
statutes, requires the court to look to the elements of the offense, rather than the facts of a
particular case, to determine whether a particular offense “involves” the sexual or physical abuse
or kidnapping of a child. /d. at 817. This approach makes practical sense: If the applicability of
§ 3283 depended on the facts of a particular case, rather than the elements of the offense, the
government would effectively be required to prove conduct beyond the elements of the
offense—i.e., that sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping occurred—in order to prove that its
charges are not time-barred.
