13 defense at this time.

14 THE COURT: Thank you.

15 Ms. Moe?

16 MS. MOE: Nothing further from the government

17 regarding scheduling, your Honor. Thank you.

21 and the interests of producing discovery and permitting time
22 for the defense to review discovery, contemplate any motions
23 and pursue those motions, the government would seek to exclude
24 time from today's date until our trial date as court set forth
25 today.
