would not require any change in Ms. Maxwell’s movements to give her the requested access.
Furthermore, on at least three occasions since she was released from quarantine, Ms. Maxwell’s
security team gave her the laptop to review discovery on the weekend.
There is clearly no actual impediment preventing the MDC staff from providing Ms.
Maxwell access to the laptop on weekends and holidays. Given the millions of documents that
Ms. Maxwell must review before trial in order to prepare her defense, it is critical that she be
given as much time as possible with the laptop to review the discovery. We therefore respectfully
request that the Court order the BOP to give Ms. Maxwell access to the laptop on weekends and
holidays during the hours that she is permitted to review discovery.
Sincerely,
