“The reality is that plea bargains have become so
central to the administration of the criminal justice
system that defense counsel have responsibilities in the
plea bargain process, responsibilities that must be met to
render the adequate assistance of counsel that the Sixth
Amendment requires in the criminal process at critical
stages.” Missouri v. Frye, 566 U.S. 134, 143 (2012). That
responsibility, borne by NACDL’s members, requires
defense counsel to explain the benefits and drawbacks of
a plea agreement to their clients.

As a practical matter, every criminal defendant

agreements expose the client to prosecution in other
districts. It creates an impossible situation if defense
counsel must now explain to their clients that the court
may later excuse the Department from its promises.

is obligated to uphold its side of the bargain.” Puckett v.
United States, 556 U.S. 129, 137-38 (2009). A “guilty plea
is a grave and solemn act to be accepted only with care and
discernment.” Brady v. United States, 397 U.S. 742, 748
(1970). A plea “is more than an admission of past conduct;
it is the defendant’s consent that judgment of conviction
may be entered without a trial—a waiver of his right to
trial before a jury or a judge. Waivers of constitutional
