Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant’s third
motion for release on bail, dated February 23, 2021 (the “Third Bail Motion” or the “Motion’”).
(Dkt. No. 160). On July 14, 2020, after extensive briefing and a lengthy hearing, this Court
concluded that the defendant posed a serious flight risk and that no condition or combination of
conditions could ensure her appearance in court. On December 28, 2020, after the defendant
renewed her motion for release on bail (the “Second Bail Motion”) by essentially restating her
prior arguments and presenting a more significant and specific bail package, this Court issued a
thorough opinion and again concluded that the defendant “plainly poses a risk of flight” and denied
the motion for “substantially the same reasons that the Court denied” her first motion for release.
(Dkt. No. 106 at 1-2 (“Dec. Op.”)). The defendant appealed this Court’s December 2020 decision
to the Second Circuit, and that appeal remains pending. Now, the defendant asks the Court yet
again to reconsider its decision, and proposes two additional bail conditions to supplement the bail
package the Court previously considered and rejected. For the reasons set forth below, the Motion
should be denied. First, the Court does not have jurisdiction to grant the Third Bail Motion—in
which she asks this Court to reconsider its December opinion—because the defendant has appealed
that December opinion to the Second Circuit. Second, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction
to grant this latest bail application, the Court should adhere to its prior rulings because the
defendant continues to pose an extreme risk of flight, and the additional bail conditions proposed
by the defendant do not justify reversal of the Court’s prior findings that no combination of
conditions could ensure her appearance. The defendant’s Third Bail Motion should be denied.

I. Background

The Government’s December 16, 2020 opposition to the defendant’s Second Bail Motion
details the background of the initial bail proceedings in this case and is incorporated by reference
herein. (See Dkt. No. 100 at 2-6). After this Court denied the defendant’s initial application for
