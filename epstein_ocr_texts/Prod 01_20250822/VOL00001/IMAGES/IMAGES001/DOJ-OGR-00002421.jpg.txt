III. Post-Indictment Proceedings in the Civil Case

As the Court is already well-aware based on prior litigation, Judge Preska currently is

overseeing both the remand unsealing proceedings in the Giuffre v. Maxwell case as well as the
Giuffre v. Dershowitz matter. Last week, Judge Preska issued a ruling in connection with the
request from Ms. Giuffre and the Miami Herald to unseal the second Maxwell deposition from
July 2016. As is pertinent here, Judge Preska ruled:

“During this deposition, Ms. Maxwell was asked repeatedly about her own sexual

activity with consenting adults. Unlike in her prior deposition, at her July 2016

deposition, she provided testimony in response to those questions. . . . This

testimony is, in any case, far afield from the sex trafficking and sexual abuse

allegations that were central to the dispute in Giuffre v. Maxwell.”
