plead guilty to a single-count Florida state indictment.' Epstein did so in 2008 and went to
prison for 13 months. At that time, the government did not charge Ms. Maxwell.

In 2016, attorneys representing plaintiffs in civil litigation against Ms. Maxwell met with
a section chief in the United States Attorney’s Office (““USAO”) for the Southern District of New

Then, in 2018, more than a decade after the NPA was executed, an explosive front-page
article in the Miami Herald reported detailed allegations, including from attorneys representing
plaintiffs in civil litigation, about Epstein’s conduct, Acosta’s handling of the 2006 investigation,
the process by which the NPA had been negotiated, and its substantive terms. In the wake of the
article, the government indicted Epstein in this District for conduct allegedly committed between
2002 and 2005. Again, the government did not charge Ms. Maxwell.

Thus, at three separate junctures over more than a decade, the government had occasion
to consider whether to charge Ms. Maxwell for the now 25-year-old conduct alleged in the
current indictment. Every time, the government—appropriately—did not do so. Indeed, such
charges would have been baseless.

the then-Attorney General as the result of “‘a perfect storm of screw-ups.”

Worse still, almost to the day after Epstein died, the barrage of media attention shifted
from Epstein to Ms. Maxwell, including in mainstream publications. She was portrayed as
