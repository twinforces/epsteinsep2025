Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document4 Filed 07/02/20 Page 9 of 10

The defendant’s international connections and significant financial means would present a
clear risk of flight under normal circumstances, but in this case, the risk of flight is exacerbated by
the transient nature of defendant’s current lifestyle. In particular, the defendant has effectively
been in hiding for approximately a year, since an indictment against Epstein was unsealed in July
2019. Thereafter, the defendant — who had previously made many public appearances — stopped
appearing in public entirely, instead hiding out in locations in New England. Moreover, it appears
that she made intentional efforts to avoid detection, including moving locations at least twice,
switching her primary phone number (which she registered under the name ““G Max”) and email
address, and ordering packages for delivery with a different person listed on the shipping label.
Most recently, the defendant appears to have been hiding on a 156-acre property acquired in an
all-cash purchase in December 2019 (through a carefully anonymized LLC) in Bradford, New
Hampshire, an area to which she has no other known connections.

The defendant appears to have no ties that would motivate her to remain in the United
States. She has no children, does not reside with any immediate family members, and does not
appear to have any employment that would require her to remain in the United States. Nor does
she appear to have any permanent ties to any particular location in the United States. As such, the
Government respectfully submits that the defendant will not be able to meet her burden of
overcoming the presumption of detention, because there are no bail conditions that could
reasonably assure the defendant’s continued appearance in this case.

In particular, home confinement with electronic monitoring would be inadequate to
mitigate the high risk that the defendant would flee, as she could easily remove a monitoring
device. At best, home confinement with electronic monitoring would merely reduce her head start
should she decide to flee. See United States v. Zarger, No. 00 Cr. 773, 2000 WL 1134364, at *1
