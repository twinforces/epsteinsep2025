1 The Court will now announce its findings with respect
2 to the sealed documents that are the subject of this motion to
5 unseal. These findings are a result of the Court's

4 particularized review of each of the 156 documents it has

5 considered for unsealing today.

6 As before, the Court will proceed in the order of the
7 documents listed on the chart that the parties have provided,

8 listing their respective positions for each document. This

9 chart is Exhibit F to Ms. Menninger's declaration, filed with
10 Ms. Maxwell's reply brief in support of her objections to

11 unsealing. The docket number is 1167-2.

12 As before, the Court is grateful to the parties for

13 their assistance in organizing the enormous number of documents
14 for review. It has been a great service to the Court, and I do
15 thank the parties for that.

16 As I go through, references to page numbers are going
17 to be those typed on the document, not those numbers assigned
18 by the ECF system.

19 Finally, as I go through, I will ask my law clerk,
20 Patrick Malone, to interrupt if I am misreading any of this.
21 As you can see, the parties' chart is enormous and has
22 multiple, multiple iterations of findings listed on it. If I
23 am misreading, I will ask Pat to interrupt so we don't have to
24 go back at the end and confuse ourselves even more.
25 Here we go.
