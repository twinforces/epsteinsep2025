Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97-21 Filed 12/14/20 Page 10 of 29
Abuse of process/political motivation

27. Extradition requests are rarely discharged on the basis that the case in the requesting state is politically
motivated or abusive. It is well established that there is a presumption of good faith in relation to a
requesting state, such as the US, which has a long history of respect for democracy, human rights and
the rule of law, and which has longstanding extradition arrangements with the United Kingdom”.

28. It is highly unlikely that Ms. Maxwell would be able to establish that the US prosecutor had acted in
bad faith, for example by seeking her extradition for a collateral motive in circumstances where they
knew there was no real case against her®’.

29. It is also highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell would be able to establish that her extradition was sought
for the purpose of prosecuting or punishing her on account of her political opinions, or that she might
be prejudiced at her trial or punished, detained or restricted in her personal liberty by reason of those
opinions”.

Passage of time

30. Notwithstanding the date of the allegations in the superseding indictment, a judge is unlikely to
conclude that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite Ms Maxwell by reason of the passage of
time since the alleged commission of the offences®. The courts have upheld orders for extradition in
cases with similar timescales to those in Ms Maxwell’s case, including two cases involving historic
allegations of sexual offending where the relevant time period was 20 and 33 years. In both cases, the
courts placed emphasis on the public interest in ensuring that extradition arrangements were honoured
and in ensuring that serious allegations were tried”.

31. As to oppression, the graver the offence the higher the threshold for oppression™. Given the
seriousness of the offences in Ms Maxwell’s case, it is unlikely that she would be able to establish that
any personal or family hardship that might be caused by the extradition” should outweigh the public
