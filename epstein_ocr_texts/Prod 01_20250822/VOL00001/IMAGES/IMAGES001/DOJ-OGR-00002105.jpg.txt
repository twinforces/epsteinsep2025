Abuse of process/political.motivation

27. Extradition requests are rarely discharged:on the basis that the case inthe requesting ‘state is’politically’
‘motivated or abusive. It is, well established ‘that there ‘is ‘a presumption of good faith in relation, to ‘a
Tequesting: state, such. as, the US; which.has.a long, history of respect ‘for democracy, human rights and

the rule‘of. law, and which has longstanding extradition arrangements with the’United:'Kingdom™.

28. It.is highly unlikely that:Ms. Maxwell would be ‘able ‘to establish ‘that; the US prosecutor‘had acted in

bad faith, for example’ by secking her extradition for a collateral motive im circumstances where they.
‘knew there was‘no real. case against her".

29..Iis also highly unlikely that Ms Maxwell. would be able to establish. that her extradition. was !sought
for the purpose ‘of prosecuting or punishing-her on account of-her political opinions, or. that she might
‘be prejudiced. at ther trial or punished, detained or restricted in her personal ‘liberty: by reason of those

Passage of time

30. Notwithstanding the daie of the allegations in ihe ‘superseding indictment, a judge is unlikely. to
conclude. that it, would. be unjust or oppressive to extradite Ms Maxwell. by reason of the passage: of
time since the alleged commission of the offences®”. The courts have upheld orders for extradition in
easés with similar timescales to those in Ms Maxweéll’s' case, including two cases involving historic
allegations of sexual, offending ‘where the.televant time period was 20 and 33 years. In both, cases, the
courts placed emphasis on, the public interest.in,cnsuring that extradition arrangements ‘were honored

and in ensuring that-serious allegations were tried”.

31..As to oppression; the graver' the offence the higher the threshold ‘for oppression™. Given the
seriousness of the offences in.Ms Maxwell’s case, it is unlikely. that she would be able to establish that

any. personal or, family’ hardship thai. mighi:be caused by the exiradition” should. outweigh, the public
