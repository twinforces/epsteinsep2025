deadlines to which. it already agreed. and reneging on.(or:redefining) its assurances to the Court
that it would.engage in “thoughtful and critical pushing and. pressing of questions and issues with
respect'to actively retrieving any appropriate files." In fact, the promised “substantial”
production of discovery’is “substantial” in.sizé, not substarice. Approximately: one fourth of the
production rclatcs:to materials gathered. in civil. litigation to ‘which Ms. Maxwell was a:party. The
remainder. of the discovery contains documents from:the 2000s that relate: largely: to Jeffrey
Epstein, and therefore have: nothing to.do'with the time period. of the: conspiracy charged.in the
