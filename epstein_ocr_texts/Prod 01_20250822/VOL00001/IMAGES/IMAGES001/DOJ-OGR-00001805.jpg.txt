Re: — Response to the Government’s October 7, 2020 letter,
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,
At the initial conference in this case, the Government promised Ms. Maxwell and the
Court that it would review and produce “prior investigative files from another investigation in
the Southern District of Florida,”! which it characterized as part of “the core of the case” against
Ms. Maxwell,” after a “careful and exhaustive and through review of all of the materials,” with
the “bulk” of the discovery produced by “the end of this summer [2020].”? Summer is gone,
Winter is coming, and the Government has failed to make good on its promises.
Although it casts the October 7, 2020 letter to the Court as a “response to the Court’s
prior inquiry regarding” its plan to produce discovery, the Government is, in fact, abandoning the
deadlines to which it already agreed and reneging on (or redefining) its assurances to the Court
that it would engage in “thoughtful and critical pushing and pressing of questions and issues with
respect to actively retrieving any appropriate files.” In fact, the promised “substantial”
production of discovery is “substantial” in size, not substance. Approximately one fourth of the
production relates to materials gathered in civil litigation to which Ms. Maxwell was a party. The
remainder of the discovery contains documents from the 2000s that relate largely to Jeffrey
Epstein and therefore have nothing to do with the time period of the conspiracy charged in the
