Material,” which is clearly sought for impeachment purposes, is not a’proper subject of a Rule
17(¢). subpoena:

Third, certain of the:documents:that'the Defendant:secks tovobtain:from: BSF are “otherwise
procurable” from:the. Government. Nixon, 418 U.S. at-699 (documents. requested pursuant to Rule
I7(c), must. not be “otherwise procurable” from, another source). Requests. 1 and, 2 both seck,
communications between BSF and the U.S. Attorney, which the Defendant can procure from the
Government. Similarly, Request 8 secks.a Grand Jury Subpocna that’was served on BSF by the
Government itself, aid that the Defendant can therefore: procure from. the Government. Thus, a
Rule:17(c) subpocna'to BSF for. those documents is improper. See, e.g., United States v. Bergstein,
No. 16 Cr. 746 (PKC), 201.7 WL, 6887596, at *5 (S.D.N.¥. Dec. 28,:2017) (“When ‘many’ of the
subpoenaed materials are obtainable through ‘the discovery process, a subpoena, contravenes
Nixon’s requirement. that subpoenaed, materials must: not be otherwise ‘procurable: in advance of
trial. by the exercise. of duc diligence.”), United States v. Boyle, No. 08 Cr. .523 (CM), 2009 WL
484436, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2009) (quashing a.17(c) subpoena: where it was “likely that many
of the: documents that, defendant. seeks im his subpoena are obtainable from another source—the:
United, States Attorney’s Offiee—with little or no diligence required”).

Finally, Requests 10 and 11 seck.items that can be produced at trial if they are shown to be
relevant and admissible. Request 10 secks a pair of cowboy boots that the Defendant and Jeffrey:
Epstein purchased for Annie Farmer for inspection and copying. Request. 11 secks the original
copics of various photographs of Annic: Farmer when she was a teenager, of Maria, Farmer on.
Leslic. Wexner’s property, of Virginia. Giuffre on various of Jeffrey. Epstcin and the Defcndant’s
‘properties, and of Virginia Giuffre, Prince. Andrew, and the Defendant in the Defendant’s. London
townhome. Although the relevance of these items is minimal—the photographs, for example, do
not appear to depict:any conduct orevent described.in:the indictment—the-Defendant cannot show
that she “cannot properly prepare for trial, without. such, production, and inspection in advanee of
trial and that the failure to obtain ‘such inspection may tend“unreasonably to delay the trial,” which.
is an independent requirement under Nixon. 418 U.S. at699. There is simply no reason, why, if
the Farmers and Ms. Giuffre. ultimatcly testify and. if these items prove to be relevant. and.
admissible, these items cannot be produced for inspection at trial.

For all of the foregoing reasons, the .Defendant’s. motion ‘to authorize service of the
Subpocna:on BSF should be denied

Respectfully submitted,
