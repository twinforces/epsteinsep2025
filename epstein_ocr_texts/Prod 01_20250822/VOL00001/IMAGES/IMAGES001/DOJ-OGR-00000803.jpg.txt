was unanimously affirmed, on November 17, 2011, by a panel of five judges of the Appellate |
Division of the New York State Supreme Court. People v. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d 570, 933 N.Y.S.2d |
239 (N.Y. App. Div. 2011). |

Notwithstanding Judge Pickholz’s order, according to a July 10, 2019 investigative report |
by the New York Post, as noted, Mr. Epstein has never reported as a sex offender to New York |
law enforcement. See July 10, 2019 NY Post Article. “The NYPD cop assigned to monitor |
Epstein has repeatedly complained to [the New York County District Attorney’s] Sex Crimes |
Unit that Epstein wasn’t in compliance, according to a source familiar with the matter.” Id. Mr. |
Epstein’s alleged failure to comply with his New York sex offender obligations would appear to |
undermine defense counsel’s premise that Mr. Epstein’s “perfect compliance” and “meticulous |
obedience,” Dkt. 6 at 1, 5, to his sex offender registration obligations should lead to his release. |
See LaFontaine, 210 F.3d at 135 n.6 (where the Court ordered detention noting that the |
defendant “had previously disregarded court orders”). !

The Court has also read the story in the July 17, 2019, New York Post in which attorney |
Brad Edwards contends that while Epstein was serving his Florida state sentence (after pleading |
guilty to procuring a minor under 18 for prostitution and solicitation of prostitution), Epstein was |
allowed to leave the jail on work release. While on work release “[h]e was having . . . female !
visitors ... and continuing to engage in... [sexual] conduct. . . while he was in ‘jail’.” Mr. |
Edwards is counsel to one of Mr. Epstein’s victims. See Reuven Fenton and Kate Sheehy, Jeffrey :
Epstein had sex den while serving time: lawyer, New York Post, July 16, 2019. The Court is also |
aware of an article published by Palm Beach CBS local news which reports that the Palm Beach
County Sherriffs Office “disputes [the] claim that Jeffrey Epstein had sex on work release.” A
spokeswoman for the sheriff's office is quoted as saying “If he violated any conditions of his :
