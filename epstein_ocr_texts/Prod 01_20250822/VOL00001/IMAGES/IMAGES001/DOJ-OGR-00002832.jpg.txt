jury wheel (e.g. the jury venire) and the Uniondale counties (e.g. the community), the court |
rejected the defendant’s fair cross-section challenge. Id. |

Just as Bahna rejected the proposition that the relevant community was the entire Eastern |
District, this Court also rejects Schulte’s contention that the relevant community is the
Manhattan counties or the entire District. See id. Because Schulte’s grand jury venire was
drawn from White Plains, Bahna instructs the Court to “look to that division” as the relevant |
community in assessing his fair cross-section challenge. See id. The Court must therefore |
conclude that the White Plains counties represent the relevant community.

There is one caveat. The precursor to applying Bahna, of course, is that it must have |
been proper for the Government to have sought the Indictment from White Plains. 68 F.3d at 24 . :
(“Where a jury venire is drawn from a properly designated division, we look to that division to |
see whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.”) (emphasis
added). And on this issue, Schulte contends that the Government’s decision to seek the |
Indictment from White Plains “deviated from the established, court-tested, and constitutional
practice of indicting defendants in the division in which the offenses allegedly occurred and in
which the case will be tried.” (Schulte Br. at 2.) This argument must be rejected for two
reasons.

First, the Court finds no persuasive or binding authority that supports the premise that the
Government must indict defendants in the same courthouse as where the trial is scheduled to
