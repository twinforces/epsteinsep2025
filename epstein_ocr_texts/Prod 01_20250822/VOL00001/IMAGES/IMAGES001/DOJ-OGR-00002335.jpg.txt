Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s order dated
January 26, 2021 providing the Government with an opportunity to respond to the defendant’s
proposed redactions to its pre-trial motions filed on January 25, 2021. The Government notes at
the outset that the defendant has not proposed any redactions to certain motions filed on the docket.
(Motions 5, 8, 9, & 12; Dkts. 119-126). The Government agrees that no redactions are necessary
as to those particular motions. The Government agrees with the defendant’s proposed redactions
to the remaining pre-trial motions for the following reasons:

e The proposed redactions to the defendant’s motion to dismiss for breach of the non-
prosecution agreement (Motion 1) and the motion to dismiss for pre-indictment
delay (Motion 7) refer to documents designated by the Government as
“Confidential” within the meaning of the Protective Order in this case (see
Protective Order 4 15 (Dkt. 36)), and the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored
to protect the integrity of the Government’s ongoing investigation. See, e.g.,
Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol Stops Northwest, 441 U.S. 211, 218 n.9 (1979) (“Since
the 17th century, grand jury proceedings have been closed to the public; and records
of such proceedings have been kept from the public eye. The rule of grand jury
secrecy... is an integral part of our criminal justice system.’’).

e The proposed redactions to the defendant’s motion to dismiss Counts One through
Four of the Superseding Indictment as time-barred (Motion 2) and her motion to
strike surplusage from the Superseding Indictment (Motion 6) protect the privacy
interests of victim-witnesses.

e The proposed redactions to the motion to dismiss Counts Five and Six (Motion 4)
refer to documents designated by the Government as “Confidential” within the
