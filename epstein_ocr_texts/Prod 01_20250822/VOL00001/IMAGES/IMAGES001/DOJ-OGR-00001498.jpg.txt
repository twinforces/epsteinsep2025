also intends to use the time until any initial appearance before Your Honor to discuss the terms of
a protective order with defense counsel. Such a protective order will be necessary to facilitate the
production of discovery while also protecting, among other things, the privacy and identity of third
parties, including victims of the conduct charged in the Indictment. Accordingly, the Government
respectfully requests that the Court exclude time both for the transportation of the defendant from
another district, see 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(F), and to allow the parties to engage in discussions
regarding a protective order, which will serve the interests of justice by facilitating the timely
production of discovery in a manner protective of the rights of third parties, including potential
victims. See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7). The Government has consulted with defense counsel, who
consents to this request.
Respectfully submitted,
