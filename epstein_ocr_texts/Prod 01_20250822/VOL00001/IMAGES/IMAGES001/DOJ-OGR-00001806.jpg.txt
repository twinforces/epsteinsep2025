Indictment. Although. the Government:represented, to this Court during the detention hearing that.
“the strength of the Government’s evidence’provided.a strong incentive ‘for Ms. Maxwell to
flee, it has failed to produce any of the corroborating documentation that they claimed to have at’
the ‘initial-hearing in this casc. And, to the contrary, the dearth.of evidence reinforces'why Ms.
Maxwell has never intended to flee. She steadfastly maintains her i innocence and vehemently
denies the charges against. her, as. she-has in prior civil lawsuits since the allegations. against her
first surfaced.

Furthermore, the Government’s production.of discovery to Ms..Maxwell in the MDC: has
been.deficient and.inadequate. For example, Ms. Maxwell. only: received the Goyernment’s
October 2, 2020 production, yesterday. afternoon, almost three’ wecks after the production. date,
and. she still, cannot read all, of the documents in the g government's prior productions. Defense
counsel have discussed these issucs at length x with the Government, and, despite the
beicorrected, the problems persist. The defense has done: what it can.to alert: the Government: to
these: issues so that they:can ‘be remedied, including three letters, three conference calls,
numerous emails, and,countless hours of time and effort that should have'been Spent on,
preparing the: defense. It shouldnot. be Ms. Maxwell’s responsibility. to: intercede with the
Government andthe. BOP 'to cnsure. thatthe discovery is produced on time. and.in a readable
format. The Government created these: problems by y insisting: that Ms. Maxwell be detained

they have not-done.

The Govérmimnent’s failuré to. produce :relevant discovery in.a timely. manner, and ina.
format: that Ms. Maxwell can. eect ely review, 1s prejudicing her ability to investigate. prepare:
old and were c investigated, oven: many years by: the ‘Government prior to indictment, it should not
have been difficult: for'the Government-to produce the relevant-discovery. by. the appropriate
deadlines. Its October’7, 2020 letter is simply the harbinger of future delay, obfuscation, and
impairment. of Ms. .Maxwell’s. ability to defend herself:

Background. Regarding the Lack:of Substantive Disclosure by the Government Regarding
Counts One Through Four*

The “speaking” indictment in this case is remarkable: because it fails to identify an
accuscr, a'specific date that Ms. ‘Maxwell is alleged to have committed.a crime, ‘or when
anything i in furtherance of any. alleged conspiracy’ occurred. The only’ dates contained i in the
indictment: are the! years 1994-1997. Fed.R.Crim.P: 7 provides that “‘[t]he indictment, ... shall be a
‘plain, concise and. definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense:
charged.” Fed.R.Crim.P. 7(c)(1). A eriminal defendant is:entitled. to an. indictment that alleges
the essential clements of the charge against him. See.Jones v. United States, 526 U.S. 227, 232

*:Similar. discovery problems exist regarding. Counts Five and Six..Evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s‘non-involvenient
awwith other. Epstein accusers after 1997 would, in-fact:, undercut the Government’s perjury theory because’the
materiality of any: statements must'be:evaluated in the context:of the allegations:made in'the civil proceeding, Fe.,,
