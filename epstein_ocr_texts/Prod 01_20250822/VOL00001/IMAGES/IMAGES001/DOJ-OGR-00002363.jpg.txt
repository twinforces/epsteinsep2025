Six, Which Are The Fruits Of That Evidence
1. The-role of protective orders in civil litigation.
Protective orders serve a “vital function” in civil litigation. Martindell v. Int'l Tel..& Tel.
Corp,, 594 F.2d.2911, 295' (2d. Cir. 1979). They: promote “the ‘secure the, just, speedy, and
inexpensive determination’ of civil disputes, by encouraging full disclosure of all evidence.” Jd.
(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 1). “Ifprotective orders Were. éasily modified ... . parties would be less
forthcoming in giving testimony and. less willing to settle their disputes.” S-Z.C. v.
TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d,222, 230 (2d Cir. 200.1). In particular, .as here, “witnesses might. be
made available to the Government for criminal investigatory purposes in,disrcgard ‘of those
orders.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at:295=96. Parties thus rely. on protective orders, and. courts strictly’
enforce them. See, eg., Stewart v. Hudson.Hall ELC, 20 Civ. 885 (SEC), 2020 WL: 7239676, at
*2 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 9, 2020) (“In the Second Circuit, there is a. strict standard for:modification of
a protective order entered. by a district court.” (citation and, quotation. marks omittéd)).
