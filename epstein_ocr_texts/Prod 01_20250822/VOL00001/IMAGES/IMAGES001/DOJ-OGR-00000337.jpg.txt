defendant, being in the environment. of a federal. facility—also gréatly:magnifies the danger of the
defendant’s flight tothe public. See United:States v. Boustani, 356 F.Supp. 3d:246,,257 (E.D.N.Y.
2019). “This is why, as the Government correctly notes, federal prisoners should be detained in.
facilitics run by'trained personnel, from federal correctional facilities.” Jd. at.258 (citing Sabhnani,
493 F.3d.at;74 n.13 (“To the extent [armed private,guards] implies an,cxpectation.that.deadly force
mayneed to be used to assure defendant['s] ‘presence at trial ... [s]uch a.conclusion would, in fact,
demand.a defendant's, detention”).

The Second Circuit.has held it‘is ‘not legal error “for a district court to decline to accept,”

‘as “a'substitute for detention,” a.defendant hiring ‘private security guards to monitor him. United
States v:, Baki, 369 Fed. App’ ‘x. 152, 153-54 (2d Cir. 2010). Inthe same decision, the Second.
Circuit noted ‘that. it was.“troubled” by the possibility of “allow[ing] wealthy defendants to buy’
their way out: ‘by constructing ¢ a. private jail. ” (internal quotation marks, omitted). Id.3 accor d, C8.
(“iti is contrary. to underlying: principles of deterifiont and. release 0 on n bail that: individuals otherwise
ineligible for release should, be able to buy their'way'out by: constructing a:private jail, policed by’
Security guards not’ trained of ‘ultimately accountable to the Government, cven if carefully’
selected” (quoting Borodin V. ecru 136 F.. Supp. 2d 125, 134 (E. D. N. Y. 2001))); Valerio, 9
sugecst that a . defendant. (ore even, 1. hypothetically, a 1 group of defendants with private funding) has
a statutory right to replicate’ or construct ‘a:private ‘jail ina home or some other location.”).

_ The defendant’ Ss: “payment of his g guards: also: raiscs: ‘the conflict of interest inherent in 1 having
him, leaving the. company’ s incentives ‘entirely ‘aligned with the defendant. See, Ce a , "Boustani,
356 F. Supp. 3d. at: 257 (in, finding that; private armed guards would not reasonably assure: the
appearance of a defendant, noting a “clear conflict of interest—private ‘prison. guards ‘paid, by an
inmate?” and noting, that in a recent.S.D.N.Y. case involving private security’ guards the defendant

“was outside of his apartment virtually all day, every weckday; was visited ‘by a:masscuse: for a
total of 160 hours: in, a 30-day period; and. went. on, an unauthorized. visit to: a. restaurant in,
Chinatown with his private guards in tow”); see’ also United States v. Lajideen, 17 Cr. 046, 2018
WL 1342475, at *5-6 (D.D.C. Mar. 15,.2018)-(finding Zarrab “particularly:instructive” and further
noting: “While the Court has no reason to beli¢ve that the individuals. selected. forthe. defendant's
securitydetail. would.intentionally violate federal law and.assist the defendant in flecing,the:Court's
jurisdiction, it nonctheless is mindful of the power of money: and its ‘potential to. corrupt: or
undermine laudable objectives. And,although these realitics cannot control the Court's ruling, they:
also cannot be absolutely: discounted.or ignored.”).

Finally, 3 in Zarrab this:Court found that “the Defendant’s privately funded. armed guard.
proposal is unreasonable because it helps to foster inequity and unequal, treatment in favor of. a.
very small cohort of criminal defendants who are extremely wealthy, such as Mr. Zarrab.” 201.6
WL 3681423, at *13; see also. Boustani, 356 F. Supp. 3d_at.258 (“although this Defendant has vast:
finanéial, resourées to construct his own, ‘private prison,’ the Court is not convineed, ‘disparate
treatment based. on. wealth is permissible: under the Bail'Reform Act”) (quoting: United. States v.
