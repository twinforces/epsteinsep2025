The Gourt finds that the. Deféndant’s proposed bail package is,inadequate. Among its
deficiencies are these:

(1) The bail package is not accompanied. or supported by audited or certified financial
statements, including details of inconie arid expenses and debt obligations. There. is no affidavit
from Mr. Epstein. As. noted, Defense counsel submitted'a cursory one page “Asset Summary -
Jurié 30,2019" on, Mr. Epstein’s behalf:in which, he disclosés several categories of asséts totaling
$559,120,954. The: Defensé states that it “Would bé impossible for Epstein — given, among other.
impediments, |his detention, inability to quickly: access pertinent:records. and. inability to quickly
make a.precise valuation of particular assets to provide'a, sufficient financial statement’ by: the
Court's 5 pm. deadline.” Dkt. 23 at 4.

The absence of accurate and comprehensive ‘financials, sworn to by. the: Defendant, does
not allow the Court meaningfully: to assess Defendants’ own proposed bail, package ‘nor would it.
énable the Court to fashion.a bail package onats own. The Court would,riot be ablé to determine
what level. of bail — in relation to Epstein’s finances — would reasonably assure the Defendant's
appearance. ‘Defense counsel proposed.at:the bail hearing on.July 15,2019 that it would fake a
‘few days to prepare accurate financials for Mr. Epstein. He also suggested that he would do so
(only) ifthe: Court. were agreeable:to granting bail. This “offer” appears disingenuous for.a,
person.as wealthy:and experienced, in financial matters'as Mr. Epstein. See Tr, 7/15/19 at 50
(Court: “There needs to be a fuller financial picture to know what would be appropriate.”

Defense Counsel? “Let me be blunt. It was our firsteffort:. . ..°). That Mr. Epstein does not have

‘a. financial statement, including liabilities and. expenses, readily available is difficult to

understand.
