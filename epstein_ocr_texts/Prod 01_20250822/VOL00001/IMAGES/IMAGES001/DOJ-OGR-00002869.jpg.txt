The Government has already produced to the defense all material that constitutes Rule 16
discovery related to the new allegations and charges contained in the S2 Indictment. In particular,
the Government has from the outset approached its Rule 16 productions in this case as though the
allegations covered a broader time period through at least 2005, rather than limiting those
productions to the time period alleged in the S1 Indictment (1994 to 1997). As a result, the
Government has already produced to the defense all Rule 16 material relevant to the S2 Indictment
of which it is aware in the Prosecution Team’s possession. These Rule 16 materials included
productions from the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) Palm Beach Resident
Agency (the “FBI Florida Office”), the FBI New York Office, and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for
the Southern District of New York.

Indictment, today the Government provided the defense with Minor Victim-4’s month and year of
birth. Additionally, in order to aid the defense in its trial preparation and review of the discovery,
