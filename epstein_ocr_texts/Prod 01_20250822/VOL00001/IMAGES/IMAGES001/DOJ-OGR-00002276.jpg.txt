Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 118 Filed 01/25/21 Page 2 of 2
The Honorable Alison J. Nathan
January 25, 2021
Page 2
Several of the motions reference or discuss Confidential Information produced in
discovery and are therefore redacted pursuant to paragraph 15 of the Protective Order (Dkt. 36).
In an abundance of caution, and to give the government the chance to review the proposed
redactions, we will not file on the public docket any motions containing redactions until we are
instructed to do so by the Court. Instead, we will submit by email to the Court and the
government two versions of those motions—an unredacted original to be kept under seal and a
version for public filing with proposed redactions—pursuant to Rule 2(B) of the Court’s
individual rules of criminal practice. We will file on the public docket any motions that do not
contain redactions.
Please contact us with any questions. Your consideration is greatly appreciated.
Respectfully submitted,
/s/ Mark S. Cohen
