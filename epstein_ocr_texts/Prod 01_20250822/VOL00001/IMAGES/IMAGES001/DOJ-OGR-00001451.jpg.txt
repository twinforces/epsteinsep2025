not permit Maxwell to have an eye mask because such an item is not available in
commissary and is not issued to inmates. (/d.). MDC staff do, however, permit
Maxwell to cover her eyes at night using other items that are available in commissary
or that are issued to inmates. (/d.).

20. In response, on May 7, 2021, Maxwell filed a reply letter
disputing the MDC’s explanation for the implementation of an enhanced security
schedule for Maxwell and raising additional concerns regarding conditions at the
MDC beyond Maxwell’s sleeping conditions but without seeking particular relief as
to those conditions. (Mot. Ex. E). At no point did Maxwell file an affidavit in
support of her claims regarding the conditions of her confinement.

21. On May 14, 2021, Judge Nathan issued a written decision
denying Maxwell’s request for an order directing the MDC to modify its nighttime
monitoring schedule. (Mot. Ex. B). In reaching this decision, Judge Nathan
noted that Maxwell’s claim that MDC staff was shining a flashlight directly into her

to nighttime flashlight checks and found that “there are a number of neutral reasons”
