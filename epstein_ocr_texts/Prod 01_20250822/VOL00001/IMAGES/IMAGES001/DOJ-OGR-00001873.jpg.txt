prison.menu. For cxample, she often reccives meals ‘with no protein and has been ‘given, only
bread and butter for'several, meals with.no ‘additional food. It was not;until, Ms: Maxwell, was
given access to the menu for the first time on. September 1°", after she complained, that-she had
been given a:non-vegetarian.meal, that she realized that she had not been receiving full meals
with all ofthe nutritional ‘components since: arriving at MDC.

misconduct or:refusal on her part and deprive-her of her only chance to remedy the BOP’s failure
to: provide adequate nutrition. Hunger and poor nutrition inhibit her ability to focus and
concentrate’ and negatively impact-her overall, health and wellbeing.
