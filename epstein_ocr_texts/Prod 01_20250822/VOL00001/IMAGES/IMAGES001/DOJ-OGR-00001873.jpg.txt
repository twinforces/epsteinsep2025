especially when she is already under constant surveillance and the scans have all come up
negative.

In addition, Ms. Maxwell is required to remove her PPE mask during physical searches,
subjecting her to higher risk of exposure to COVID. The impact of such unwarranted and
disparate treatment is dehumanizing and demoralizing. On October 24", she was subjected to a
wanded, full pat down search yielding negative results. Within 10 minutes, she was subjected to
a strip search. The guard performing these searches remarked that never in 28 years of
employment as a correctional officer has she heard or witnessed such a thing. During these
searches, guards are within inches of Ms. Maxwell. Prevented from wearing a protective mask,
she is forced to open her mouth, stick out and move her tongue left and right. She is continuously
and unnecessarily exposed to contracting COVID, causing increased stress and vulnerability.

Deprivation of Food: Ms. Maxwell’s meals have been a persistent problem. She has
requested a vegetarian diet, been given non-vegetarian meals, and has been denied food on the
prison menu. For example, she often receives meals with no protein and has been given only
bread and butter for several meals with no additional food. It was not until Ms. Maxwell was
given access to the menu for the first time on September 1*, after she complained that she had
been given a non-vegetarian meal, that she realized that she had not been receiving full meals
with all of the nutritional components since arriving at MDC.

Moreover, she has often been given spoiled food and has not been fed at all for long
stretches of time. For example, a recent weekend she was not fed anything for a period of more
than 20 hours from Saturday late afternoon until Sunday at midday. As a result of this inadequate
nutrition, she has lost upwards of 15 to 20 pounds since arriving at MDC. For the same reason,
she is losing hair as well. Her prison medical records reflect that she is suffering from telogen
effluvium (hair loss due to stress and poor diet). The lack of food also severely affects her ability
to concentrate and review discovery to prepare her defense. Further, she has been denied use of a
toothbrush, heightening her risk for tooth decay and gun disease.

In addition, at various times and for various reasons, Ms. Maxwell has been denied
access to commissary, the only opportunity to purchase food to supplement her diet. Although
the MDC nominally approved Ms. Maxwell’s request for permission to purchase from the full
prison commissary list in August 2020, in fact, her access to the commissary was extremely
limited and requested items were denied to her. None of these restrictions are a result of any
misconduct or refusal on her part and deprive her of her only chance to remedy the BOP’s failure
to provide adequate nutrition. Hunger and poor nutrition inhibit her ability to focus and
concentrate and negatively impact her overall health and wellbeing.

Deprivation of Sleep: Ms. Maxwell is held in a housing unit in which she is the sole
inmate. On various evenings during sleep periods, she is awakened every 15 minutes by
flashlights shined into her eyes. The unit is excessively noisy. The noise and constant flashlight
checks deprive her of uninterrupted, restful sleep. Repeated disruption of restorative sleep
negatively impacts her concentration and ability to focus on document review and defense
preparation.
