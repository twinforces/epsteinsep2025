or Accuser-2, or that there is any causal relationship between the alleged incidents involving
Accuser-3 in England and those involving Accuser-1 and Accuser-2 in the United States.

To the extent there is any doubt about the scope of the alleged conspiratorial agreement,
or how the allegations relating to Accuser-3 are within the scope of that agreement, the Court can
resolve the issue by ordering a bill of particulars on these points, as the court did in Hsia.
However, if the government cannot articulate how alleged sexual conduct with a person who
never traveled falls within the scope of a conspiracy to cause another individual to travel, then
allegations concerning Accuser-3 should be stricken.

C. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms.

Maxwell.

There can be no legitimate dispute that the allegations regarding Accuser-3 are
inflammatory and unduly prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. The indictment alleges that Epstein
“sexually abused” Accuser-3 and that Ms. Maxwell encouraged Accuser-3 to massage Epstein,
“knowing that Epstein intended to sexually abuse” Accuser-3. Indictment {ff 7c, 11d, 17d. The
phrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even though the alleged conduct may well have
been lawful: Accuser-3 was at or above the legal age of consent in England at all relevant times,
and the indictment contains no suggestion that the alleged sexual activity involving Accuser-3
was nonconsensual. Regardless of whether the conduct was lawful or unlawful in England,
however, few allegations could be more prejudicial to a defendant than allegations that she
participated in the “sexual abuse” of a teenager. The allegations as to Accuser-3, though
irrelevant to the government’s conspiracy counts, thus create precisely the prejudicial appearance
the government seeks.

Because the allegations as to Accuser-3 are both irrelevant to the charges against Ms.
Maxwell and unduly prejudicial, they should be stricken as surplusage.
