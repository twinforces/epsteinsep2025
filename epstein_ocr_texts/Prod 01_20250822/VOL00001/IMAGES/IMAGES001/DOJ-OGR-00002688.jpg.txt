‘or, Accuser-2, or that-there is any causal. relationship between, the alleged incidents involving
Accuser-3.:in England and those.involving Accuser-]..and Accuser-2 in/the United States.

To the:extent:there is any doubt about the scope of the alleged. conspiratorial. agreement,
or how the allegations relating to.Accuser-3 are within the scope of that agreement, the Court can
resolve, the issue by ordering a bill oftparticulars of ‘these, points, as the court did in. Asia.
However, ifthe government cannot articulate how alleged sexual. conduct with.a person who
never traveled ‘falls'within the scope of a conspiracy to cause. another, individual, to travel, then
allegations concerning AccuSer-3 should be stricken.

c. The Allegations Regarding: Accuser-3. Are Unduly. Prejudicial to. Ms.

Maxwell.

There can be iio legitimate dispute that the allegations:tegarding Accuset-3 are
inflammatory and unduly. prejudicial, to Ms. Maxwell. The indictment alleges that:Epstein
“sexually'abused” Accuser-3 and that Ms. Maxwell, encouraged Accuser-3 to: massage Epstein,
“knowing that Epstein. intended'to sexually abuse” Accuser-3. Indictment $¥ 7c, 11d,‘17d. The
phrase “sexual abuse” connotes. criminal activity, even though the alleged conduct may’well. have
been lawful: Accuiser:3 was at of above the legal age .of consent in England at all relevant times,
and the indictment contains no suggestion. thatthe alleged.sexual activity:involving Accuser-3
was nonconsensual. Regardless of: whether the conduct was lawful. or‘unlawful in England,
however, few allegations could be more prejudicial, to.a defendant than allegations that she.
participated iin the “sexual abuse” of a teenager. The allegations as to Accuser-3, though,
qrrelevant’to the government’s conspiracy counts, thus create precisely the prejudicial appearance
the government seeks.

Because the allegations as to Accuser-3 are’ both. irrelevant to the charges against;MS.

Maxwell and ‘unduly:prejudicial, they should be stricken as surplusage.
