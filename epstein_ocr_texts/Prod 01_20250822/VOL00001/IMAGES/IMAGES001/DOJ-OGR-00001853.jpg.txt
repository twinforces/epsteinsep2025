Here, that lower presumption is far outweighed by the significant privacy interests
implicated by the materials at issue. See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir.
1995) (“[t]he privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should weigh heavily in a court’s
balancing equation”). If Ms. Maxwell’s sureties are publicly identified, they will be harassed
simply for their association with and support of her. Indeed, some of Ms. Maxwell’s closest
friends and - have - suffered _ —_ For _ -

The sureties are legitimately scared that they and their children will suffer the same
consequences, and may not be able to come forward at all, if the Court does not allow their
letters and their identities to be sealed. See id. at 1051 (“[C]ourts have the power to insure that
their records are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]”). These
individuals are entitled to the same privacy as Ms. Maxwell’s accusers, no longer minors, who
have been permitted to remain anonymous even though many have revealed their identities.

The presumption of public access is also outweighed by Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interest
in details regarding her financial condition, as well as the privacy interests of third parties that
would be implicated if Ms. Maxwell’s assets were publicly disclosed. See id. (personal financial
records traditionally considered private, not public).

Similar privacy interests led the court to permit the redaction of bail submission materials
in United States v. Nejad (“Sadr”), Case 1:18-cr-00224-AJN (S.D.N.Y.). Like this case, Sadr
involved a defendant with meaningful assets and a bail package with numerous co-signers. At
the initial bail hearing, Judge Carter ordered both defense counsel and the government to redact
attachments to their submissions because they contained “sensitive private information with
respect to a whole series of individuals.” (Ud., Dkt. 21 at 25.) The privacy interests at stake here
are significantly higher, given the documented threats against Ms. Maxwell and harassment of
her family and friends.

For the reasons set forth above, we believe that portions of the Motion, and certain
materials submitted in support thereof and in opposition thereto, should be filed under seal. We
respectfully request an in camera conference to address these issues and other confidentiality
concerns related to the Motion. We have consulted with the government, which consents to the
redaction and sealed filing of (1) the names and identifying information of any proposed
cosigners, (2) any discovery materials designated confidential under the Protective Order in this
case, and (3) any information derived from confidential discovery materials in this case. The
government does not consent to the in camera conference.
