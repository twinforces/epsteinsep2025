Here, that lower presumption is far outweighed by the: significant privacy: interests
implicated bythe materials. at issue. See, United, States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir.
1995) (“[t]he privacy interests ‘of innocent third ‘parties. .... should weigh heavily in a court’s
balancing equation”). If Ms. Maxwell’s sureties are publicly identified, they will be harassed.
simply for their association, with and support of her. Indeed, some of Ms. Maxwells closest:
friends and family have already i For example

consequences, and may not "be able to. come: forward at all, ifthe Court does not allow: their
letters.and their identities to be sealed. See’id. at 1051 « ‘[CJourts have the power to insure that.
their records are not. ‘used to .gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]”). These
‘individuals are entitled to ‘the same ‘privacy as Ms. Maxwell's accusers, no longer minors, ‘who
have been permitted to. remain anonymous éven.though.many have revealed their. identities.

The ‘presumption, of. public access is also outweighed, by Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interest.
in. details regarding her, financial condition, aswell as the privacy ‘interests of third parties that.
would. be implicated if Ms. Maxwell’s assets were publicly disclosed., See id. (personal, financial
records traditionally considered private, not public).

Similar, privacy. interests led the court, to permit the redaction of bail submission materials
in. United States v. Nejad (“Sadr”), Case 1:1.8-cr-00224-AJN (S.D'N-Y.).. Like this case, Sadr
‘involved a defendant with meaningful assets and a bail package ‘with ‘numerous co-signers. At
the initial. bail hearing, Judge Carter ordered both defense counsel and the. government to redact.
attachments to their submissions because ‘they contained * “sensitive: private information. with.
Tespect.to a whole series of individuals.” (/d., Dkt. 2 at,25.) The privacy interests at.stake here
are significantly higher, given the documented. threats against Ms.. Maxwell and. harassment of
her family and friends.

For. ‘the: reasons set forth above, we: believe: that portions of the Motion, and certain
materials. submitted ‘in. support. thereof and. in, opposition thereto, should be filed under'seal.
respectfully request an in camera conference to. address these issues. and other vonfidentiality
concerms related to the Motion. We have consulted ‘with the government,.:which consents 'to the.
redaction and séaléd filing of (1) the namés and identifying information. of any proposed.
cosigners, (2) any discovery materials designated confidential under the Protective Order in. this
case, and, (3) any: information derived from confidential discovery materials in this case. The
government; does:not consent to the in cumera conference.
