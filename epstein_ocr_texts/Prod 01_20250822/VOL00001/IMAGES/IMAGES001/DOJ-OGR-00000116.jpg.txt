53a
a sex trafficking count and another related conspiracy
count.

This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell’s currently
pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to
suppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due
course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively
with the $1 superseding indictment and do not resolve
any issues related to the newly added sex trafficking
charges. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies
Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the S1 superseding
indictment in whole or in part. It grants her motion to
sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies
her motion to further expedite discovery.

The Court provides a brief summary of its con-
clusions here and its reasoning on the pages that
follow:

e Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a
non-prosecution agreement between Jeffrey
Epstein and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern
District of Florida. The Court concludes that the
agreement does not apply in this District or to
the charged offenses.

e Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as un-
timely. The Court concludes that the Govern-
ment brought the charges within the statute
of limitations and did not unfairly delay in
bringing them.

e Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts
because they are too vague, or in the alternative
to require the Government to describe the
charges in greater detail. The Court concludes
that the charges are specific enough.
