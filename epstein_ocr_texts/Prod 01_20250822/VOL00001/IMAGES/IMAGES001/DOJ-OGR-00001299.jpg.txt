been influenced by the suggestion of others, including his girlfriend at the time and the police who
came to question him in the hospital.

With regard to Mr. Robertson’s history and characteristics, his history of violating past
conditions of release is a source of concern, as the Court noted when denying him release last
September. See supra at 4. More specifically, Mr. Robertson’s Form 13 PSR notes several
instances in which his probation was revoked for failure to comply with conditions of release.
Doc. 188 at 8-10. Mr. Robertson also has several prior convictions. /d. However, as the defense
has pointed out, none of Mr. Robertson’s probation revocations appear to have involved him
absconding; although he has convictions for illegal firearm possession, he does not have any
convictions for violent offenses; and he turned himself after being charged in the instant case. /d.;
see also Doc. 274 at 4-5.

Finally, with regard to the nature and seriousness of the danger that would be posed to any
person or the community by Mr. Robertson’s release, the Court understands the government’s
concerns given the frightening allegations in this case. Mr. Robertson is presumed innocent on all
charges until proven guilty, however. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142() (“Nothing in this section shall be
construed as modifying or limiting the presumption of innocence.”). Presuming Mr. Robertson’s
innocence in this case, while he is someone who has been convicted of gun and drug offenses and
has failed to comply with conditions of release in the past, he is not someone with a proven history
of violent behavior.” Nor is the Court persuaded by the government’s vague suggestions that Mr.
Robertson might have tried to contact or intimidate witnesses in this case because it has provided
no concrete or specific evidence to substantiate any such claims. For example, the government’s
cryptic report that witness N.F. was allegedly contacted by an unnamed individual about this case
* While Mr. Robertson does have prior arrests for violent offenses, these charges were all dismissed and are
therefore unproven allegations. See Doc. 188 at 11-15.
