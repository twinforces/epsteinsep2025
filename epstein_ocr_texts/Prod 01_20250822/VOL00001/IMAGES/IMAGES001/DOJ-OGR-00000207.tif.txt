United States v. Osorto, 445 F. Supp. 3d 103, 109 (N.D.
Cal. 2020).

To permit the United States to escape the plain
language of its agreement in this case would work a
detriment on the entire plea system. This is of particular
concern given that the criminal justice system “is for
the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials.”
Missouri v. Frye, 566 U.S. at 143-44. For the plea system
to work in practice, defense counsel and defendants must
be able to rely on the written promises made by the
government and trust that courts will honor and enforce
those promises down the road, even when it means that
the Department must forego a meritorious prosecution.

Consider a situation where a defendant agrees to
plead guilty to a violent felony that will bring substantial
prison time. He agrees to plead only because the
“United States” promises in writing that it will not
charge any co-conspirators in the offense, including the
defendant’s brother, and because the plea agreement
contains no geographic or other limitation on that
promise. The defendant should be able to rely on the
government’s bargained-for promise that he alone will
suffer incarceration. And a prosecutor in a different
district must not be permitted to charge his brother with
conspiracy to commit the same offense.
