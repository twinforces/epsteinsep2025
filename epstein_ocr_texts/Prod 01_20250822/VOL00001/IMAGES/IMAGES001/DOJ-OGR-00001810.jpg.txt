MDC.

Setting aside’what the Government has not produced, the discovery that it has produced
to Ms. Maxwell in the MDC thus far has been incomplete and portions are still unreadable. On
August 27, '2020, after the Government had. completed its first three discovery: productions, the
defense alerted the Government that there were a substantial number of documents in all three
productions that Ms. Maxwell was unable to access on the hard drives that had becn sent:to the
MDC, and éeven-proposed possible technological solutions that‘we thought might alleviate the
problem. Later thatsame day, the defense sent-the:Government.a follow-up letter listing: the
unreadable documents and: requesting that the Government immediately reproduce to Ms.
Maxwell,a new:set of all of the discovery materials produccd.to date ina. format that she could
‘access on. her computer at the MDC, and,shipped,a new harddrive to load the replacement
‘production.

The new hard. drive was:not made available to Ms. Maxwell. at the MDCruntil. the late:
afternoon of September 9, 2020, almost two wecks later. While some of the previously
‘unreadable documents were fixed,'Ms. Maxwell still:could not-access a substantialportion of the
discovery matérials. The defense: sent another Ictter to the Goverriment on September 21, 2020,
listing the'unreadable documents and demanding that the problems be addressed. On conference
calls:on September 22, 2020 and September 29, 2020, the Government.advised that it was
working on,resolving the issues; but that the defense could, in the meantime; ‘ercate its own,
laptop computer: with ‘a, copy of the production, that it could bring to the MDC to review'the:
discovery with Ms. Maxwell. The defense responded that, while it would create the laptop, it
was ‘the Government’s responsibility‘to ensuite that Ms. Maxwell. had a. complete sct' of readable
discovery which she could access. at the MDC herself, without defense counsel present.

It was:not until October 2, 2020 that the Government ercated.a replacement set, of the’
‘unreadable discovery, which it.said it would ‘include on the same hard drive as the next
‘production of discovery’materials. That production. was only made. available to Ms. Maxwell 'in
the MDC yesterday aftcrnoon,, almost three weeks sincethe production.date. The Government
also advised. that.ithad asked. MDG: Icgal counscl to:send.an IT staff member. to examine the
computer and load any necessary, software to view the files on the existing hard-drives., But the
IT staff:member did not.look at the computer until, October 7, and did not ‘fix, the, problem.
Instead, ‘the IT staff member collected Ms. Maxwell’s coimputer'and hard drives and kept.them
for two days. When, Ms. Maxwell inquired about them, the IT. staff member said he had beeii too,
busy’to look at them. And when they'were.finally returned.to Ms. Maxwell in.the:afternoon on
October 9, several files'were still unreadable. As of the date ofthis letter, Ms. Maxwell still does
not have a-complete, readable 'sct of the discovery produced to date, which ‘severely impairs, her
ability: to prepare her defense. Accordingly; we ask’ the Court to: order the Government to
address ‘this problem:immediatély.
