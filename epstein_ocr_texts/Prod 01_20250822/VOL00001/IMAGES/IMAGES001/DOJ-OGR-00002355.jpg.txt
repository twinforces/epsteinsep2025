Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 134 Filed 02/04/21 Page 8 of 23

Giuffre, a public figure required to prove actual malice, had an uphill battle—even she
was constrained to acknowledge that many of her public statements were false. Using a time-
honored if unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boies Schiller therefore sought to turn the
lawsuit into a proxy prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, discovery in the case was bitter,
hard-fought, and wide-ranging. It spanned more than a year and included large document
productions, many responses to interrogatories, and thirty-some depositions, including
depositions of Giuffre and Maxwell as well as several third parties. See Brown v. Maxwell, 929
F.3d 41, 46, 51 (2d Cir. 2019) (explaining that discovery was “hard-fought” and “extensive” and
noting that the court file, which includes only some of the documents created during discovery,
totals in the “thousands of pages”).

Giuffre sought and obtained a wide variety of private and confidential information about
Maxwell and others, including information about financial and sexual matters. Brown, 929 F.3d
at 48 n.22. Given the intimate and highly confidential nature of the discovery exchanged between
the parties, the district court entered a stipulated Protective Order. See Ex. A. The Protective
Order included a mechanism for one party to challenge another party’s confidentiality
designation (such a challenge never occurred) and provided that it did not apply to any
information or material disclosed at trial. (Because the case settled before trial, that sole
exception to the Protective Order was never triggered.)

Notably, Boies Schiller sought to add a “law enforcement” exception to the Protective
Order, doubtless because the firm was eager to enlist the government in its campaign against
Maxwell. In particular, Boies Schiller proposed to include a provision stating that
“CONFIDENTIAL information shall not be disclosed or used for any purpose except the
preparation and trial of this case and any related matter, including but not limited to,
investigations by law enforcement.” Ex. B J 1(a)(4) (emphasis supplied). Maxwell flatly rejected
