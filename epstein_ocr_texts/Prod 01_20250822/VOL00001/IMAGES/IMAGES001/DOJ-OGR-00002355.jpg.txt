Case  1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 134 Filed 02/04/21 Page.8 of 23

Giuffre, a. public figure required, to prove actual malice, had an-uphillbattle—even she
was constrained to acknowledge that. many of her‘public statements were false. Using a time-
honored if:unfortunate litigation tactic, her lawyers at Boics Schiller therefore sought:to turn-the
lawsuit into a-proxy‘prosecution of Epstein. Not surprisingly, discovery’ in the case was bitter,
hard-fought, and'wide-ranging. It spanned more:than a'year and ineluded large document’
depositions of Giuffre and.Maxwell as well as several third parties. See Brown vi Maxwell, 929
F.3d 41, 46, 51. (2d.Cir. 2019) (explaining that discovery-was: “hard-fought” and “extensive” and
noting that,the court file, which, includes only some of the documents created. during discovery,.
totals in the “thousands of pages’).

Giuffre sought and. obtained.a wide varicty of private and confidential :information.about
Maxwell and others, including information ‘about financial and, sexual matters. Brown, 929 F.3d
at-48 n.22. Given the intimate and highly confidential natuire ofthe. discovery exchanged between.
the partics, the district court entered.a stipulated Protective Order. See. Ex. A. The Protective:
Order included.a mechanism for one party to challenge another party’ s, confidentiality:
designation. (such a challenge never occurred) and provided that it did not apply to any
‘information or matcrial disclosed at trial. (Because the case settled before trial,. that, sole
exception to the Protective Order was never’ triggered.)

Notably, Boics Schiller soughtto.adda.“law enforcement” exception to.the Protective
Order, doubtless because the: firm was eager to enlist the government-in, its:campaign against.
Maxwell. In particular, Boies Schiller proposed:to inélude a. provision, stating, that
“CONFIDENTIAL ‘information:shall not be disclosed. or used for.any purpose except the
preparation and. trial of this, case and any relaiéd matter, including but not limited to,

investigations by law enforcement.” Ex. B ¥ 1(a)(4) (emphasis :supplicd). Maxwell. flatly rejected.
