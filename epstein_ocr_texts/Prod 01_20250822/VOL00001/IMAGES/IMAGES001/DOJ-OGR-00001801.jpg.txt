Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in further support of its request to delay
disclosure to the defense of certain photographs of and documents (the “Materials”) regarding
victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, the Materials are
not exculpatory as to the charges contained in the Indictment. But in any event, the Government
is not suggesting that the defense should never receive these Materials. The Government fully
intends to provide the defense with these Materials, along with the statements of every witness it
has interviewed as part of its broader investigation, eight weeks in advance of trial. Because that
investigation remains ongoing, however, and because the Materials are unrelated to the charges
contained in the Indictment, production at this stage would be premature and would reveal the
scope and focus of the Government’s ongoing investigation. Accordingly, the Government
respectfully requests that it be permitted to produce the Materials eight weeks prior to trial.

First, Maxwell’s opposition misconstrues the Government’s description of the Materials
and conflates them with witness statements about the Materials. To be clear, the Materials at issue
here include documents regarding and photographs of victims of Jeffrey Epstein who were abused
during time periods that post-date the Indictment. These Materials do not include witness
statements from those victims, which, as the Government noted in its opening papers, the
Government will produce eight weeks in advance of trial. The Materials in and of themselves thus
do not, as the defendant incorrectly suggests, make clear one way or the other whether the
defendant ever had any involvement in those victims’ abuse. Regardless, as detailed below,
whether or not the defendant participated in any criminal activity that she is not charged with that
postdates the time period in the Indictment is simply not relevant, much less exculpatory.

Second, even accepting the defendant’s mischaracterization, the Materials are not
exculpatory as to Maxwell. At base, the defense opposition stretches the concept of exculpatory
material beyond recognition in a way that is wholly unsupported by the law of this Circuit. Under
the defense’s view, if Jeffrey Epstein ever sexually abused any victim after 1997 without the
defendant’s involvement, that somehow exculpates her with respect to an Indictment charging her
with participating in Epstein’s abuse of minors between 1994 and 1997. (Def. Ltr. 3-4). The
