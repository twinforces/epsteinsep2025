Re: United States-v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter i in. further Support of its request ‘to delay
victims of sexual abuse by Jeffrey Epstein. ‘Contrary to the defense’: S. assertions, ‘the: Materials’ are
not exculpatory as to the charges contained in the Indictment. But in. any’ event, the Government.
is not suggesting that the defense should iever receive these Materials. The Government fully’
intends to- provide the defense with these Materials, along with the statements of every witness it
has interviewed as part of its broader investigation, eight ‘weeks in advance of trial. ‘Because that:
investigation ‘remains ongoing, however, and because the Materials are’ unrelated to the charges
contained in the Indictment, ‘production at: this stage ‘would be ‘premature and. would reveal, the
scope and focus of the Government? s ongoing: investigation, only. the Government

‘and. sonflaies them. with witness ‘statements about the Materials, To be clear, the Materials atissue
here include documents, regarding and ‘photographs of'victims of Jeffrey Epstcin who were abused.
during ‘time periods. that post-date ‘the. Indictment. Thesé Materials dé nor include, witness
statements from. those. victims, which, as the Government noted in. its opening: papers,, the
Government will produce: cight weeks i in.advanee of trial, The Materials in. and of themselves'thus
do not, as the defendant incorrectly suggests, make clear one ‘way or. the other whether the
defendant..cver had any involvement in. those victims’ abuse. Regardless, as, detailed below,
whether or not the defendant:participated in any criminal activity that she is not. charged with that:
postdates the time period:in the Indictment is simply not:rclevant,, much less exculpatory.

Second, even accepting the defendant’s mischaracterization, the Materials are not
exculpatory as 'to Maxwell. At base, the defense opposition stretches the: concept of exculpatory.
‘material beyond recognition ina way that is wholly unsupported by the law of this Circuit. Under
the defense’s ‘view, if Jeffrey Epstein ever sexually abused any victim after 1997 without. the
defendant’s involvement, that somchow: exculpates her with respect.to an Indictment charging her
with ‘participating. in Epstein’s abuse of minors: between 1.994 and 1997, (Def. Ltr. 3-4). The
