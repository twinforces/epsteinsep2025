1. Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement

In September 2007, following state and federal
investigations into allegations of Epstein’s unlawful
sexual activity, Epstein entered into an NPA with
USAO-SDFL. In the NPA, Epstein agreed to plead
guilty to one count of solicitation of prostitution, in
violation of Florida Statutes § 796.07,? and to one
count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitu-
tion, in violation of Florida Statutes § 796.03.? He
agreed to receive a sentence of eighteen months’
imprisonment on the two charges. In consideration of
Epstein’s agreement, the NPA states that “the United
States also agrees that it will not institute any
criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators
of Epstein, including but not limited to Sarah Kellen,
Adriana Ross, Lesley Groff, or Nadia Marcinkova.”
