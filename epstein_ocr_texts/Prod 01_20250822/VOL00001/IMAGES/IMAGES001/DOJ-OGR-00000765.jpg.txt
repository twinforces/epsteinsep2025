Re: United States of America v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 19-cr-490 (RMB)
Dear Judge Berman:
On behalf of the Co-Executors of the Estate of Jeffrey Epstein, we write at the Court’s
invitation by Order in this action dated July 22, 2025 (ECF No. 63) to set out the Epstein Estate’s
position regarding the Government’s recent motion to unseal all grand jury transcripts in this
action, “subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying
information” (ECF No. 61 at 1-2).
In view of the Government’s commitment to protect the identities of those claiming to
have been victimized by Mr. Epstein, the Epstein Estate takes no position regarding the
Government’s motion to unseal.
Respectfully submitted,
Daniel H. Weiner and Daniel Ruzumna
Counsel for the Co-Executors of the Epstein Estate
