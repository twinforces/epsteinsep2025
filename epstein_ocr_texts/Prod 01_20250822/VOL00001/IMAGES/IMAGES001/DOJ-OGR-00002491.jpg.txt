1 protective order. Unseal.

2 381. Ms. Menninger's declaration. The parties agree
3 to unseal.

4 We are now coming upon a group of Palm Beach County

5 Sheriff's Office records and later Fremont County police

6 reports.

7 And the answer to all of this is going to be unseal.
8 This applies to 381-1, 381-2, 381-3, 381-4, 381-5,

9 381-6, 381-7, all of which were Palm Beach County police

10 records and 381-8, which is a Fremont County police record.

11 Unseal all of that. As I said at the outset, as produced. So
12 to the extent that the producing agency redacted material, it
13 should remain redacted.

15 and identifying information of nonparties.
