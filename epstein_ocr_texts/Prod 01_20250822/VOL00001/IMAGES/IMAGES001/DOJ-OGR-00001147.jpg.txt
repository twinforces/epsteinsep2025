demonstrated ability to live in hiding for the long term. In short, the defendant poses an extreme
flight risk, no condition or combination of conditions can reasonably ensure her appearance in this
District, and the Court should not alter its prior finding to that effect.

BACKGROUND

As detailed in the Indictment, the defendant is charged with facilitating the sexual abuse of
multiple minor victims by Jeffrey Epstein between approximately 1994 and 1997. The defendant
played a critical role in the scheme by helping to identify, entice, and groom minor girls to engage
in sex acts with Epstein. The defendant’s presence as an adult woman normalized Epstein’s
abusive behavior, and she even took part in at least some acts of sexual abuse. Together, the
defendant and Epstein conspired to entice and cause minor victims to travel to Epstein’s residences
in different states, which the defendant knew and intended would result in their grooming for and
subjection to sexual abuse. Then, in an effort to cover up her crimes, the defendant lied under oath
during a civil deposition, including when asked about her interactions with minor girls.

Based on that conduct, the Indictment charges the defendant in six counts. Count One
charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to entice minors to travel to engage
in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Two charges the defendant with enticing
a minor to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 and 2. Count
Three charges the defendant with conspiring with Epstein and others to transport minors to
participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Count Four charges the defendant
with transporting minors to participate in illegal sex acts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2423 and 2.
Counts Five and Six charge the defendant with perjury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623.
