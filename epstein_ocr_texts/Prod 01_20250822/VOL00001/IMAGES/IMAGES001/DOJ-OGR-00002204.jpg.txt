Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
On December 18, 2020, the Defendant filed her reply to the Government’s opposition to
her renewed application for bail. In accordance with this Court’s December 7, 2020 Order, see
Dkt. No. 89, she filed these materials under seal and proposed narrowly tailored redactions on

materials; and (ii1) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at

enforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Jd.
at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo IT”), 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995)).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that the Defendant’s
submissions are “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial
process,” thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first element of the
