alleges—without evidence—that her accusers fabricated
their stories based on media allegations. The Court
will not dismiss the indictment on Maxwell’s bare
assertion that numerous witnesses are engaged in a
perjurious conspiracy against her. And the Court will
take all appropriate steps to ensure that the pretrial
publicity in this case does not compromise Maxwell’s
right to a fair and impartial jury.

The Court thus concludes that Maxwell has failed to
establish actual prejudice from the Government’s
delay in bringing charges. She may renew her motion
if the factual record at trial shows otherwise. On the
present record, neither the applicable statute of
limitations nor due process bars the charges here.

III. The indictment describes the charged offenses

with specificity

Maxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for
lack of specificity or in the alternative to compel the
Government to submit a bill of particulars providing
greater detail of the charges. The Court concludes that
the charges in the S1 superseding indictment are clear
enough.

Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7, an
indictment must contain “a plain, concise, and definite
written statement of the essential facts constituting
the offense charged.” The indictment must be specific
enough to inform the defendant of the charges and
allow the defendant to plead double jeopardy in a later
prosecution based on the same events. United States v.
Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. 1992). “Under
this test, an indictment need do little more than to
track the language of the statute charged and state the
time and place (in approximate terms) of the alleged
crime.” United States. v. Tramunti, 513 F.2d 1087, 1113
