nature of the instant request, it is also (like the Court) faced with a broad public interest in the
underlying proceedings.

2. Whether the Defendant to the Grand Jury Proceeding or the
Government Opposes the Disclosure

The second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public disclosure
of grand jury materials. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106; see also Lawyers’ Committee for 9/11
Inquiry Inc. v. Garland, 43 F.4th 276, 285-86 (2d Cir. 2022) (affirming denial of motion to disclose
grand jury materials where the Government opposed release). A defendant’s opposition to public
disclosure is not dispositive. See In re Grand Jury Proceedings GJ-76-4 & GJ-75-3, 800 F.2d 1293,
1305 (4th Cir. 1986) (affirming district court’s decision to disclose grand jury transcript and
exhibits over defendant corporation’s objection).

Defendant Epstein has passed and therefore cannot assert a position. Defendant Maxwell
has indicated that she expects “to craft a response and set out [her] position to the Court.” (Maxwell
Dkt. 793).

3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case

The third factor considers “why disclosure is being sought in the particular case.” Jn re
Craig, 131 F.3d at 106. The Second Circuit in Jn re Craig held: “Tt is . . . entirely conceivable that
in some situations historical or public interest alone could justify the release of grand jury
information.” /d. As described above and in the underlying motions, there is undoubtedly a clearly
expressed interest from the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes. Beyond
that, there is abundant public interest in the investigative work conducted by the Department of
Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into those crimes. See Jn re Am. Hist. Assn, 49 F.
3 As noted below, the Government has not received any outreach from Epstein’s surviving family
concerning the instant motion.
