1 Before 1984, before the Bail Reform Act, there was an
2 Eighth Amendment that the United States Supreme Court

3 guaranteed bail to anyone who wasn't charged with a capital

4 offense, and the justices wrote continuously that was because

5 detention impairs a defendant's ability to prepare a defense.

8 and one of the most important reasons for Mr. Epstein's release
9 is to permit him the right to fully prepare a defense.

10 The second reason that before 1984 there was an

11 entitlement to bail was because of the presumption of innocence
12 and because of the basic premise of the American criminal

14 second; that non-convicted citizens don't get detained which is
15 essentially a label for punishment.

16 There is no way to replace the freedom if Mr. Epstein
17 is to prevail on these charges. If the government's over a

18 decade of delay is found prejudicial by the Court which

19 thereafter dismisses the charges, if the Court determines that

22 witnesses' lawyers to go to the Southern District and catalyze
23 and create a case. That's unique.

25 Florida and the Southern District of New York. It is more than
