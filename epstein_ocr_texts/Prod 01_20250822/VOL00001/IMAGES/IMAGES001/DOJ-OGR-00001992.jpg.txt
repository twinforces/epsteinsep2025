(id.). Nevertheless, she has “no hesitation” posting her home because she knows “in, every.
fibre of [her] being” that Ms. Maxwell “will never'try to flee.” ((7d.).
Similarly, another surety'who has. agreed to sign.a $3.5 million bond writes:

This amount represents the value of effectively all of my assets, including my
home If I lost: these assets,
because Ghislaine violated the conditions oft herrelease, T would. be,
financially‘ruined. I make this pledge without reservation because I know that:
Ghislaine'will. remain in the United States to:face the charges against:her,

(Ex. F). Two other sureties, one of whom ts a. U-S. citizen and resident, will post cash bonds
in. thé amount of $25,000, aiid another will post $2,000 in cash, which. are significant
pledges for, these individuals.

In addition to these bonds, the security company that ‘will provide security services. to
Ms. Maxwell. upon-her transfer :into home confinement has agreed to post:a $1 million. bond.
in, support of her bail application. In our:collective experience as.defense counsel, we are
not aware of a previous example where a. security company has posted a bond ‘for a
defendant. The. head. of the security company’has confirmed. that they have never done this
fora defendant in the: past but are: willing to:do so here because of his company’s.“long-
Stariding relationship:with Ms. Maxwell” atid because he. is “confident that she will. not try
to flee. (Ex. S).

In sum, these bonds-reflect the depth of support ‘that Ms. Maxwell.has from her
family and friends, who are risking their livelihoods, their safety, and their ability to live
without: constant media harassment to support her. (Se¢’Ex. B) (“Absolutely anyone who
darés to put their head above the parapet so to speak, to ... support.Ghislaitie personally, gets. it
slaughtering.”). Ms. Maxwell. would never, destroy those closest to her by fleeing, after they

have risked So much.to Support her.
