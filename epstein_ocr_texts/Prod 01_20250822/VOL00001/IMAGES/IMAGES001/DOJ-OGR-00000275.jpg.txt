Nonetheless, it is fundamental that pretrial detention is reserved for “a small but
identifiable group of particularly dangerous defendants as to whom neither the imposition of
stri[ct] release conditions nor the prospect of revocation of release can reasonably assure the
safety of the community or other persons.” S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 6-7 (1984), reprinted in 1984
U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3189. And that’s true no matter how much rhetoric and hyperbole the
government and media pile on a presumptively innocent citizen. Popular condemnation aside,
compelling legal issues stand between Mr. Epstein and any possible conviction on the allegations
of conduct from 14 to 17 years ago pressed in the indictment. Importantly, the Bail Reform Act,
18 U.S.C. § 3141 et seq., authorizes release for even wealthy defendants facing serious charges
who travel and own property abroad.

The government’s indictment labels this a “Sex Trafficking” case. Yes, the government
may have witnesses who will testify to participating in sexual massages — most over 18; some
under; some who told the police they lied about their age to gain admission to Mr. Epstein’s
residence; some who will testify that Mr. Epstein knew they were not yet 18.! But their
anticipated testimony only punctuates the alleged offenses’ purely local nature. (All occurred
within a single New York residence or, if the Florida conduct is ultimately ruled admissible
despite the NPA, then within two residences.) There are no allegations in the indictment that Mr.
Epstein trafficked anybody for commercial profit; that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved
anybody; or that he engaged in any of the other paradigmatic sex trafficking activity that 18
U.S.C. § 1591 aims to eradicate. No one seeks to minimize the gravity of the alleged conduct,
but it is clear that the conduct falls within the heartland of classic state or local sex offenses —
and at or outside the margins of federal criminal law.

Mr. Epstein, 66, is a U.S. citizen who’s lived his entire life in this country. Born and bred
in Coney Island, he worked his way up from humble origins — his father was a New York City
municipal employee in the Parks Department — and earned every penny he’s made with nothing
more than a high school diploma. He speaks only English and knows no other languages. He
owns no foreign businesses and holds no foreign bank accounts. Five of the six residences he
maintains are located here in America. His brother, niece, and nephew all live here too.

Until his arrest in this case, Mr. Epstein’s only notable brush with the law resulted in the
2007 NPA (Exhibit 1) and a 2008 state-court guilty plea required by the NPA for conduct
substantially overlapping the conduct charged in the pending indictment. As a result of the state
guilty plea, Mr. Epstein received a 30-month sentence, 18 months of incarceration, and 12
months’ probation under conditions including home confinement. Mr. Epstein served 13 months
in custody, 12 months on probation and, as a condition of the NPA and his state sentence, was
required to register as a sex offender in the locations of his residences. He is currently registered
' New York’s age of consent was 17 at the time of the alleged conduct and remains so today.
