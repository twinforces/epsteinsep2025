The discovery also does not contain any police reports in which the people we
believe to be the complainants reported the alleged crimes to law enforcement. To the

In sum, the discovery contains not a single contemporaneous email, text message,
phone record, diary entry, police report, or recording that implicates Ms. Maxwell in the
1994-1997 conduct underlying the conspiracy charged in the indictment. The few
documents in the discovery that pertain to the people we believe to be the three
complainants referenced in the indictment do little, if anything, to support the governmentâ€™s
case against Ms. Maxwell:
