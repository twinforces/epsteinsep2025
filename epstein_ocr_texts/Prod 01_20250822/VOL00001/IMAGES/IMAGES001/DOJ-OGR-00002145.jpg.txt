69. Afticles:3.and.4.ofthé EAW ED Sct outa number of'grounds for refusing thé cnhforécment
of a EAW, that are.respectively mandatory and.optional. Article-4(6) on optional grounds
provides that a Member State may: refuse! the ‘exceution of a EAW «issued: for the
purposes of execution of a custodial sentence.or detention order, where the:xequested
person. is staying-in, oris a.nationalor a residentof the executing. Member State.and that
State, undertakes to execute the sentence of detention order in accordance with its
domestié lay»: "This article 1s: the only provision in the EAW FD that allows. Member
States to consider. nationality in the execution of a‘EAW. As such, nationality can only
act as,a bar to the exccution ofa. EA'W issucd -for the: purpose. of. executing .a. custodial

sentence, not. condiicting a criminal. prosccttion.
70, It follows‘that European, Union_law docs:not prohibit the extradition, of-nationals.
(iii), ~~ French constitutional.law.

71. As regards the status of the protection of nationals from extradition under French, law,
the fact that France did :not have ‘to: change: its ‘Constitution ‘or domestic laws regarding
the extradition. of nationals to incorporate the ‘EA'W' FD effectively means that. the
prohibition .against.'the sufrénder of a Fretich citizch to ‘forcign authoritics does not

constitute an absolute prohibition’per se under French, law":

72. The Conseil Constitutionnel (French constitutional.Court) has long considered. that France:
could not ratify an. international amcndment-which went against-the Constitution, thereby
necessitating a modification. of the text of the Constitution prior to the ratification of the
purported. international treaty*®. For:example,’‘the Constitution had to be amended prior'to
the ratification of the.Rome Statute, to ‘create. an.cxeeption to the.rule that the President of
the Republic cannot be: found criminally liable in. respect of acts committed, during: his
mandate. By contrast,'the provisions of the:Rome:Statute: which:require Contracting:Parties
to surrender their nationals when. the jurisdiction of the International. Criminal Court, is
established did, not trigger an amendment to the French Constitution. Like the EAW FD,
the example of:the Rome Statute must be:taken.as evidence that there is no constitutional

principle against.the extradition of nationals-in-France:

4 By-contrast,. several'Member ‘States ofthe EU'such as Germany: Poland-or Cyprus. had to amend iheir national
constitutions prior to incorporating, the EAW. FD, following’constiiutional courts* rulings.
