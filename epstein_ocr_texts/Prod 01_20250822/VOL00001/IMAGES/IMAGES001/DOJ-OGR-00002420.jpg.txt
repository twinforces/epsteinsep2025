Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 136 Filed 02/04/21 Page 11 of 27

In mid-2016 after this second deposition, according to media reports, Giuffre’s lawyers
urged the Government to charge Ms. Maxwell with perjury based on her testimony.” It is
unclear how the attorneys could have done so without violating the protective order, which
forbade them from sharing the contents of these “confidential” depositions with law
enforcement.

II. The Indictment

Count Five of the Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell made two false statements during
the first deposition in April 2016. Count 5 alleges that the following italicized testimony by Ms.
Maxwell was both material and false:

Q. Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual

massages? If you know.

A. I don’t know what you’re talking about.

Q. List all the people under the age of 18 that you interacted with at any of Jeffrey’s

properties?

A. I’m not aware of anybody that I interacted with, other than obviously [the

plaintiff] who was 17 at this point.
Indictment 21.

Count Six alleges that Ms. Maxwell gave false testimony during a subsequent deposition
in the same action in July 2016. Count Six alleges that the following italicized testimony from
that deposition was both material and false:

Q. Were you aware of the presence of sex toys or devices used in sexual activities

in Mr. Epstein’s Palm Beach house?

A. No, not that Irecall....

Q. Do you know whether Mr. Epstein possessed sex toys or devices used in sexual

activities?
