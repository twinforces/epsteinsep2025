Re: United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB)
Dear Judge Berman:
As the Court is aware, on the morning of August 10, 2019, Jeffrey Epstein died while in
custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center. On August 16, 2019, and after conducting an
autopsy, the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of the City of New York issued a statement
identifying the cause of death as hanging, and the manner of death as suicide. In light of the death
of the defendant prior to a conviction becoming final, the Government must request the Court
approve the attached proposed order of nolle prosequi.
Consistent with our practice throughout this case and our obligations under the Crime
Victims’ Rights Act, the Government has made efforts to contact all identified victims since
learning of the death of the defendant and will similarly notify all known victims of the attached
order, once entered. As this Office has previously stated publicly, it remains committed to doing
its utmost to stand up for the victims who have already come forward, as well as for the many
others who have yet to do so.
Respectfully submitted,
GEOFFREY S. BERMAN
