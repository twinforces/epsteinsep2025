autopsy, the Office of the ‘Chief Medical Exaininer of the City of New York issued a statement
identifying the cause of death. as hanging, and the manner of death as.suicide. ‘In light of the death

learning of the death of the defendant and will similarly notify all known victims of the attached
order; once entered. As this Office has previously stated publicly, it:remains committed 'to doing

other's who have yet to do so.
