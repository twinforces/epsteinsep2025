Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 8 of 74 8

1 legal or administrative proceedings in Florida, the Virgin

2 Islands, New Mexico, and any other jurisdiction comparable to

3 the one before Judge Pickholz in which she ruled on 1-18-2011.
4 So I'm not suggesting that there are, although I think
5 I did read someplace that there may be some proceeding pending
6 in New Mexico. I'm not quite sure. That's what I hoped you

7 could help me out on.

8 It doesn't have to be precisely the same proceeding

9 that Judge Pickholz had. I'm looking for any transcripts in

10 particular and administrative or legal proceedings in other

11 states relating in any way to Mr. Epstein's sex offender

12 status.

13 The third question on my mind is this: The defense

14 has submitted a brief financial summary to the Court of

15 Mr. Epstein's assets. And I, as you know, permitted that it be
16 submitted under seal for, among other reasons that were on my
17 mind, not to slow the proceedings down.

18 The summary is cursory I would say, short, less than a
19 page and does not fully assist me in rendering the bail/remand
20 decision, that is to say, in its detail or absence of detail.
21 And moreover, the information provided in that summary seems to
22 be known already to the government in other ways. They seem to
23 have gotten that information from other sources.
24 So I am inclined to place the summary on the docket,
25 but I want to hear from both sides whether I should or should
