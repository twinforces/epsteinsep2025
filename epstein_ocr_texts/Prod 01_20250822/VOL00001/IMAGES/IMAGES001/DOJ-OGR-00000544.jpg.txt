Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document36- Filed 07/24/19 Page 34 of 74 are

1 of recidivism is not always that, oh, I'm not going to do this
2 conduct anymore. It's more of a psychological aspect I would
3 say.

4 But they measure recidivism rates -- for example, one
5 study that I saw -- and I'll put this up on the docket so

6 you'll know what I was looking at -- measures recidivism at

7 five years, at ten years, and at fifteen years.

8 And the response, the percentage of recidivism

9 actually goes up at 15 years. I'm not going to quote the

10 percent. I know it, but I don't know how accurate it is, but
11 it is substantially higher than the recidivism rate at five

12 years, for example.

13 So all I'm saying is I don't think it's so clear that
14 with the passage of time, the presumption, so to speak,

15 evaporates or disappears.

16 There is other discussion in some of these studies

17 that sex crimes are the most difficult to evaluate in relation
18 to recidivism and a lot of other concepts because in sex

19 crimes, victims very often don't come forward.
20 This is not a phenomenon when we hear in this case or
21 even in another case on the news that where was the victim
22 then, didn't come forward. That's not an uncommon phenomenon
23 having to do with a whole complex number of factors. Soa lot
24 of these cases are never reported.
25 I don't know that you can just draw the conclusion
