2024). Thus,.Ms. Farmer’s.and other victims” privacy interests as victims of Epstein.and, Maxwell
weigh heavily in favor of the redactions of the victims’ ‘names and identifying information.

B. ‘Redactions of Names and Information Relating to Epstein. and Maxwell’s Co-
Conspirators Are Improper.

The Government’s original ‘motion, refers, to a July’ 6, 2025 Memorandum. that concluded.
that no evidence could. predicate an investigation.:into‘uncharged third. partics: associated. with.
Epstein’s and‘Maxwell’s: criminal scheme. ./:pstein Dkt. No. 61 at 1-2. The Government purports
to seek; the unscaling of the grand jury transcripts to provide: transparency for the public into the
conclusions reached by. the Memorandum. Jd. To be-clear, we do not.agrec that theres insufficient
evidence to support investigations into third partics who enabled.Epstein’s ‘and Maxwell’s crimes
and ‘participated. in them. ‘Numerous individuals haye:yet'to be investigated and several civil cases
have: been filed addressing other individuals’ central, involvement with. Epstein’s, and, Maxwells
sex trafficking.

As the Court acknowledged, there arc “over one thousand ‘victims” of Epstcin’s and.
Maxwell’s crimes. /psiéin, Dkt. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth of these victims have been,
‘Victims Compensation. Fund or. otherwise. To rectify this, there have been numerous civil.cases
filed that, address third parties” central involvement..with, Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking
crimes. See Doe 1 v. JPMorgan Chase. Bank, N:A:, Case No. 22-cv-10019 (S:D.N.Y.),. Doe I v.
Deutsche Bank. Aktiengesellschaft, Casé No. 22-cv-1,0018. (S.D.N.Y .); Doé, 3%. Indyke, Case No.
24-cv-01204 (S.D:N.¥.). To the extent any of Epstcin’s and Maxwell’s enablers and co-
conspirators who have, thus far evaded accountability are implicated. bythe grand. jury transcripts,
their identitiés should.not be shiclded.from the public. Though “[t]h¢-privacy interests of innocent
third parties” like the victims should be redacted, see. Gardner v. Newsday, Inc.,,895' F.2d 74, 79
(2d Cir. 1990), there should be no similar protection,for those:third:partics accused of wrongdoing.

Ms.. Farmer strongly: supports the release of Epstein’s:and Maxwell’s grand.jury transcripts,
subject:to,appropriate redactions of the;victims, ‘names and:identifying information. Unscaling'the
grand jury transcripts serves the interests of transparency, accountability, and restorative justice.
