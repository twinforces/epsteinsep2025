advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in
this case—decades-old allegations spanning multiple
locations—present considerable challenges for the
preparation of the defense. However, the Government’s
proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford Maxwell
at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness
statements—allows Maxwell significantly more time
to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most
cases in this District. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb,
No. 00-CR-91 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at *9 (S.D.N.Y.
Feb. 5, 2001) (thirty days before trial); United States v.
Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d 565, 580 (S.D.N.Y. 2000)
(fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April 18,
2021, the Government produced over 20,000 pages of
interview notes, reports and other materials related to
non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circum-
stances, including the complexity of the issues in this
case and what the defense has already received and
likely learned in the course of discovery, the Court
concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally
reasonable.
D. Rule 404(b) material

Maxwell’s final discovery request is for early
disclosure of evidence the Government seeks to offer
under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). Under Rule
404(b), if the prosecutor in a criminal case intends to
use “evidence of a crime, wrong, or other act” against a
defendant, the prosecutor must “provide reasonable
notice of the general nature of any such evidence that
the prosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must “do
so in writing before trial—or in any form during trial
if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial
notice.” The Government represents that it will notify
the defense of its intent to use 404(b) evidence at least
45 days in advance of trial to allow Maxwell to file any
