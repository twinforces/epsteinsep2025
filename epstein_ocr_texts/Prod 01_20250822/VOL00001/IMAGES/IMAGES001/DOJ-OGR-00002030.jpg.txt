independent judge and jury. Ghislaine is not a malicious or jealous person. In all the
I have known her, I have never seen her be violent or act inappropriately against anyone, let
alone young adults or children as has been alleged.
| ee believe in her innocence. I know
she would never do anything to put my life or my family’s life in jeopardy in any way, which
is why I have no hesitation in placing the one property that I own — which is my only nest-
egg for my retirement—up as part of her bail application. The value is $1.5 Million dollars. I
do not have any other savings and it would be completely devastating financially and in every
way to my own family were the house to be taken over by the Government due to a breach of
a bail conditions. I know in every fibre of my being that Ghislaine will
never try to flee and will absolutely turn up to her trial, to have the opportunity to fight the
charges against her. Based on my deep knowledge and experience with Ghislaine SS
| I totally trust and believe that I do not have to worry in any way about my home being
put up as a part of her bail application.
Until her arrest, I spoke often with Ghislaine over the phone and in the early summer of this
ear, two to four times a week.

I witnessed how hard she worked every day and well into the nights going through the
ever-growing tsunami of press clippings, videos, audio files, etc, that so gravely traduced her
and continue to do so. Ghislaine is completely horrified and flabbergasted by these
unfounded and completely horrendous accusations, as indeed am I.

I feel totally safe around Ghislaine, in fact, I feel safer with her. I have never had any
hesitation in my children visiting her or being with her — as they have been — both as young
children and now they are older. Neither they nor I have ever seen any signs or signals of the
alleged criminal conduct. I personally witnessed her be a warm, lovely, understanding and
caring When visiting Ghislaine more recently as well as in
the past I was
impressed by her interaction with them and by their evident trust in and great affection for her
which was entirely natural and unforced. Every exchange was totally normal and just lovely
to watch how each of these P| clearly liked P| and she them. Although
Ghislaine was certainly part of the New York social scene in the past, for many years, it had
become clear to me that she was happy in a long-term loving relationship with her previous
partner of over 7 years far away from the New York scene and with iii
leading a happy family life with people she loved and trusted and who were similarly equally
loving and trusting of her. I saw the same pattern of strong domesticity and family happiness
with her spouse a I have personally witnessed how much they love
being with and being loved by Ghislaine.
In terms of character, Ghislaine is compassionate, capable, and proactive. Ghislaine is very
kind and caring, She brovch i 1. siay with
her in New York for extended periods so that they could spend quality time together. She
took them all around the US to see the sights and to visit with family and friends. Even under
the terrible weight of her present circumstances, she has consistently demonstrated her
consideration for others. Whenever we spoke, she asked bout
The fact that she could care enough and not just be thinking only of herself at this impossible
time remains deeply moving to me.
