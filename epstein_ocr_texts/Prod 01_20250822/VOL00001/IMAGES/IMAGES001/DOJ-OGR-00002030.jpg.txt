independent judge and jury. Ghislaine is. not a malicious or jealous ‘person. Inall the
Thave known her, Ihave never seen her be violent or act’ inappropriately against’ anyone, Ict.
alone young:adults or children as-has been alleged.

I believe in her innocence. | know
she would never do anything to put my'life or my: family’s life in jeopardy in any way, which
is why. T have no hesitation in‘placing the one property that | own ='which is my only. nest=
egg for my retirement—up as part of her bail application. The value is $1.5 Million dollars. 1
do notshave any: other sayings and it would be completely devastating financially and in every’
way tomy own family. were the house to be taken over, by:the Government due to'a breach of
a bail, conditions. I know in, every fibre of my: being that[ | ‘Ghislaine, will
never'try.to flee. and will absolutely turn up, to her trial, to have the opportunity to fight the.
charges against her. Based on my: deep knowledge: and experience with. Ghislaine]

J totally trust and believe that-I do not-have.to worry in any-way about my home being:

put up as a'part of her bail application.

Until her arrest; I spoke, often with Ghislaine over the phone and in the carly summer.of this_
year, two to 'four'timeés a week’

I ‘witnessed’ how hard she ‘worked every day and,well. into the nights going through the
ever-growing tsunami, of press clippings, videos, audio files, ete, that so gravely traduced.her
and continue to do so. Ghislaine is completely ‘horrified and: flabbergasted by: these.
unfounded.and completely. horrendous accusations, as. indeed am I.

I feel. totally safe around. Ghislaine, in fact, I:feel safer with her. I have never had any
hesitation in.my: children visiting her or being | with her—as they have been. — both as young
children and now they:are. older. Neither they nor Ihave ever scen any signs or signals of the
alleged criminal conduct. personally “witnessed her bea warm, lovely; tinderstanding and.
caring When visiting Ghislaine more recently as Well as ‘in
the past Twas
impressed by her interaction with:them.and by their evident trust.in and. great affection ‘for her
which was entirely natural. and.unforced. Every exchange was totally normal and just lovely
to‘watch how :each of these [ clearly’ liked] and,she them. Although
Ghislaine’was certainly part of the New York social. sccne in the-past,, for many years, it-had
become clear to me ‘that she was happy:in a long-term loving relationship with her previous
partner of over 7'ycars far away from the New York scene:and with

leading a ‘happy. family. life with people she loved and trusted and who were similarly: equally:
loving and trusting of: her. 1 saw the same pattern of strong domesticity and, family happiness
with her Spouse] _j! have personally witnessed how:much, they. love

In terms of character, Ghislaine is compassionate, capable, and proactive, Ghislaine is very.
kind and.caring. She brought to stay‘with
her in New’ York. for extended. periods so, that they. could spend. quality time together: She
took’ them all around the US to sce the sights. arid to visit with family and friends. Even under
the terrible weight of her present:cireumstances, she has. consistently demonstrated.her
consideration :for others. Whenever we: spoke, ‘she asked about

The fact that she could, care. enough and not,just be thinking only of hersclf at this impossible.
lime remains deeply ‘moving to‘me.
