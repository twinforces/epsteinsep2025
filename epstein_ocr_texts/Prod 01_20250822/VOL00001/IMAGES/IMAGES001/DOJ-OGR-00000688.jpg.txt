1 this particular issue, even though it's more than a decade old
2 and, yet, we can see today that these problems recur in many

i) other cases. Your remarks today, I think, should be published
4 so that they can serve as a guide for other judges around the

5 country.

6 I would encourage you to add into your remarks a

7 reference to the Crime Victims Rights Act. The Crime Victims

8 Right Act promises victims the right to be treated with

9 fairness, dignity and respect, and the process that we see

10 unfolding this morning is a clear example of how victims can be
11 treated with fairness, dignity and respect.

12 So I know that your Honor is wondering what is the

13 appropriate action here. Unfortunately, it seems like there

14 are no other legal options, but there was a legal option for

15 you to decide to exercise, which was to allow these victims to
16 come forward. And if there's been one positive thing that has
17 come out of the tragedies, the abuse, the other events of this
18 case, it's been your decision to allow these victims to be

19 heard this morning, and I encourage you to publish your
20 decision and to encourage other judges to follow what is
21 clearly a model for crime victims rights and is clearly an
22 example that should be followed in other cases down the road.
23 THE COURT: Thank you very much. I appreciate your
24 being here. I had no idea that you would be here when I wrote
25 the remarks, but it was clear from the literature that you are
