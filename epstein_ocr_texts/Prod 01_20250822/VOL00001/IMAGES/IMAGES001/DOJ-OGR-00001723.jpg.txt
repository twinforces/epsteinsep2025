continue to evaluate where the defendant should be housed within the facility and that the
defendant will be placed into the general population if and when BOP is assured that such
placement would not pose a threat to the orderly operation of the institution. The defendant
identifies no basis for the Court to disturb that determination by the BOP, particularly given that,
as detailed below, her housing assignment will not negatively affect her ability to review discovery
in this case.

Regarding the defendant’s request in connection with access to discovery, the Government
understands from BOP that the defendant had not even yet received her copy of the Government’s
first discovery production at the time the Defense Letter was filed—she received the materials on
Tuesday, August 11. While it is correct that BOP’s initial plan was to provide three hours per day
of access to the discovery—the same access that is granted to every other pretrial inmate, including
those with trial dates scheduled for far earlier than July 2021—as of earlier this week, and given
the volume of expected discovery, BOP informed the defendant that she will have the opportunity
to access to her discovery from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. every day of the week. Although this
arrangement will be subject to continued evaluation on an ongoing and individualized basis, and
is subject to ordinary considerations of prison operations, BOP intends to provide that access on
an ongoing basis to the extent it remains reasonably practicable to do so. Accordingly, this
application should be denied as moot.

C. Conclusion

For the reasons set forth above, the defendants’ requests, as set forth in the Defense Letter,
should be denied.
