2. Ms. Maxwell’s Counsel Was in Regular Contact with the Government
Prior to: Her Arrest

At no time, however, did Ms. Maxwell intend to flee-or hide from the government,.as the
government argued at the last bail hearing. In fact, her intent was exactly the opposite. As her
spouse’s letter makes clear, after spending.a few months away [, Ms. Maxwell
driving distance of the prosecutors in New York in case they wished to speak to her. (Ex. AJ
12) (“|Ghislaine| ‘was adamant to not only stay in the United States to fight the smears against
her, but to be within driving distance of New York.”). Contrary to the impression given by the
government, Ms. Maxwell was not “changing locations on multiple occasions” as if she were a
fugitive from justice. (Tr. 87). After Ms. Maxwell moved into the house in New Hampshire in
December 2019, she remained there continuously for approximately seven months until her
airest. (See Ex. B) (“|S |he was finally able to:locate a place where she could not be moving
around constantly and collect herself to fight for her life and to clear her name.”):

Ms. Maxwell, through her'counsel, was also in regular contact with the government
from the moment of Epstein’s arrest up the time of her own arrest, as would be ctistomary in
such situations. Defense counsel corresponded by email, spoke on the phone, or had in-
person meetings with government in July, August, September, and October 2019, and also
in January and March 2020. The timeline attached to this submission illustrates the extent
of these:contacts. (Ex. R). Defense counsel also requested an opportunity to be heard in the
event that the government was considering any charging decisions against Ms. Maxwell.
We were never given that opportunity, which is uncharacteristic for the Southem District of

New York, nor were we given any notice of her impending arrest.
