83a
Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. 1992). The Court
will follow the well-worn path of others in this District
and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her
motion then.

VII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous

charges is premature

Maxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third
count of the $1 superseding indictment as multiplicitous
is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government
has alleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment.
“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges a
single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate
counts, when, in law and fact, only one crime has been
committed.” United States v. Chacko, 169 F.3d 140, 145
(2d Cir. 1999). “The multiplicity doctrine is based upon
the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,
which assures that the court does not exceed its
legislative authorization by imposing multiple punish-
ments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian,
820 F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. 1987) (cleaned up).

“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquittal,
the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against
simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so
long as no more than one punishment is eventually
imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350,
355 (2d Cir. 2006). “Since Josephberg, courts in this
Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to
dismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.”
United States v. Medina, No. 13-cr-272 (PGG), 2014
WL 3057917, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. July 7, 2014) (collecting
cases). The Court therefore denies Maxwell’s motion to
dismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice.
