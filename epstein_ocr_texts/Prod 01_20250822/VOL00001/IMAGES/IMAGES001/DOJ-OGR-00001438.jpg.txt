Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S220, Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear, Judge Nathan:

Once again, the government reports second- and 'third-hand information from the MDC,
the rcliability:of which becomes increasingly questionable. In.its May 5" letter:regarding the
MDC’s flashlight security checks of'Ms. Maxwell (Dkt. 270), the government contradicts a.
previous report that. Ms. Maxwell. “has.an eye mask.” This allegation, immediately:refuted. by-her
‘counsel, wa’ a focus of the Second Circuit’s, questioning during oral. argument of Ms. Maxwell’s
bail appeal. Now; the government: reports that-the MDC cannot:provide an cye mask to Ms.
Maxwell and that,an eye mask is considered.contraband. This. alone is.a, basis. for the Court,to
question the veracity of representations made by the MDC.

To justify the 15-minute flashlight surveillance that.is causing Ms. Maxwell’s disruptive.
Slecp atid sleep deprivation, the MDC claims that Ms. Maxwell is. on “an enhanced sccurity
schedule.” ‘The reasons. given to support the need:for “heightened safety and sccurity concerns”
with respect to Ms. Maxwell are'spurious. They single out Ms. Maxwell, to the detriment of:
other pretrial detainees who face even more scrious charges and potential stress (i-¢., defendants
release and. the death penalty) and who.are incarccrated ‘in cells by’themsclves. The MDC.
attempts to shift the ‘focus of its conduct by claiming that itis responsive to Ms. Maxwell’s
“expressed ‘concern, for her safety: if she were‘housed in general population.”

The MDC should.fact check. its records before making bold.assertions. The .Intake:
Screcning Form completed, by Ms. Maxwell upon cntry to the MDG on July 6,:2020 ‘posed. the
following question: “Do‘you.know of any ‘rcason why-you. should. not be placed in general
population?” Ms.,Maxwell responded, “No.” It is the’ MDG, not the inmate, who makes the

determination. regarding general population or degree of segregation. The Intake Screening
