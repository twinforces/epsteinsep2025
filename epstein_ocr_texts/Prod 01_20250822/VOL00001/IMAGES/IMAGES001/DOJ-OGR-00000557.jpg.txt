Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 47 of 74 at

1 constitute the predicate of detention and the predicate —--

2 THE COURT: The $250,000 and the $100,000?

3 MR. WEINBERG: Yes, your Honor.

4 The government says -- and I think they're being

5 candid in their language in the last sentence on page 11 --

6 that "Given the timing, it suggests" -- and I underline that

7 word -—- "the defendant was attempting to further influence

8 coconspirators who might provide information."

9 So the government -- and I think they've been candid
10 today -- has not confirmed the witness testimony through

11 corroboration, through any other corroborative mechanism

12 whether this was an act of generosity or an act that somehow

13 was connected to what the government suggests might have been a
14 motive.

15 But this occurring when there was no pending judicial
16 proceeding and no knowledge of a pending investigation doesn't
17 rise to the level of a federal obstruction which requires the
18 pendency or the foreseeability of a federal investigation under
19 the Supreme Court's decision in Aguilar, A-g-u-i-l-a-r, a judge
20 in California.
2l We just contend that even when you look backwards to
22 whether this constitutes an obstruction, the payment of an
23 employee or the payment of a friend is simply not witness
24 tampering because the Miami Herald ran an article.
25 It simply doesn't rise to the level of a past crime
