obligations undertaken therein to be set aside.’ See, e.g., Sanfobello vy. New: York, 404 U.S. 257,
262 (1971) (“[W]hen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreenient of the
prosecutor, so that it can be: said to be: part. of the inducement or consideration, such promise
must be fulfilled.) United, States 'v.. Harvey, 869 F.2d. 1439, 1443. (Lith Cir. 1989) (“Due
agreement it makes.”). ‘Indeed, even if this Court were somchow to 'sct aside the Non-
Prosecution Agreement on. the authority of the CVRA, and even if after consultation with,
Petitioners the United States: determined. that it would be proper and desirable to ‘institute a
criminal, prosecution, in the Southern District. of Florida against. Epstein ‘on the criminal charges
contemplated. in the Non-Prosccution Agrecment, the United, States would still be

subsequent 18-month state incarccration).

* To the extent. that the Petitioners’ requested invalidation of the ‘Non#Prosccution,

Agreement would implicitly reject and nullify the correctiiess of both the state: court’s acceptance:
of. Epstein? s guilty plea and the: resulting judgment of conviction -which'were induced in part’ by’
the Non-Prosccution. Agreement — such judicial action might raise additional questions. about this
Court’s jurisdiction ‘under, the Rooker/eldman doctrine. See, e¢. g-5 Casale v, Tillman, 558 F.3d.
