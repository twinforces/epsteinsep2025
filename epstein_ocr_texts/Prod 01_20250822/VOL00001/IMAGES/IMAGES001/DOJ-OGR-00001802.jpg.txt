without the defendant i is somehow exculpatory. The defense cites no: authority f for such. a broad.
interpretation.of. Brady, nor is the ‘Government aware of any. ‘To'the contrary, the well-established,
law of this Circuit,g gencrally. precludes,a defendant from.offering evidence that-a defendant: did nor
participate in criminal conduct on.a particular oceasion—or of her law-abiding. conduct during,
uncharged periods or. uncharged. events—to rebut the: Government’s ‘evidence with respect*to the
charged. crimes or events. See; e: Zo United States: v. Scarpa, 897 F.2d 63, 70 (2d Cir, 1990) (“A,
defendant:may not seck to establish‘h[er] innocence . . through proof of the absence of criminal,
acts on specific occasions.”): United States v: Chambers, 800 F.. App’x’ 43, 46 (2d Cir. 2020) (“A
singlé occurrence of lawful.conduct is ‘simply irrelevant’ to other occurrences of lawful conduct.”

(quoting United States v. Walker, 191 F.3d 326, 336 (2d Cir. '1999)); United States vy. Williams,

205 F.3d‘23,,.34 (2d. Cir. 2000) We reject Williams’s assertion. that ‘the evidence of: innocent.
travel was necessary to rebut the government's allegation that. Williams had.been involved in other
cocaine importations from, Jamaica.Although, the government did ‘argue that ‘Williams. had. been,
involved in other:importations, it did not allege’that Williams had, engaged in drug activity during
these particular trips.”); United States ¥. Fiumano, No. 14 Cr. 5:18 (JFK), 2016 WL. 1629356, at’
*7 (S.D.NLY. Apr. 25, 2016) (“The principle .is rather ‘elementary. A ‘defendant charged. with.
robbing a. bank’ in Manhattan. on. April. 22 cannot offer as evidence to disprove the charged. crime
that he did not rob the bank’s branches, in Brooklyn or the Bronx on,April 22 or'that:he did not rob
‘the Manhattan. branch on.April 20, 21,23, and:24, because this evidence 1s, irrelevant to the charge
that he robbed the Manhattan bank on April 22.”); Waited States ¥. Gambino, 838 F. Supp. 744,

748 (S. D.N-Y. 1.993) (“Defendants also :claim ‘that the. Southern. District was ‘in. possession. of
exculpatory materials which jit did. not disclose, namely that :Gravano had.:discussed. drug deals
with,a numberof ‘captains’ in the Gambino crime family, but-had no ‘such conversations with John.
Gambino. Even if the Southern District had knowledge that Gravano had conversations with other:
captains about specific instaticcs of drug crimes, the fact that. Gravano did, ‘not’ have such
conversations with. Gambino docs, not :make: such evidence. exculpatory. .. . Sinée a. defendant’
cannot. introduce ‘evidence of innocent: behavior on. other occasions ‘to prove ‘his innocence, such.
testimony would:not be:cxculpatory within the requirements of Brad\’)."

'The implications of the defenses proposed. expansion of Brady would be sweeping. There
are any‘number of cases in-which.a:defendant.is charged. with participating in a criminal conspiracy
for a discrete period of time outside of which co- conspirators may have committed:similar crimes
without that defendant. Such.a-sct of facts is:;common., in, for example, ‘racketecring conspiracics
and narcotics conspiracics, in which defendants may conspire with ¢ach. other for a certain period,
of time. before and after’ which.they commit similar crimes on ‘their own or with others. The fact’
thata a‘co- “conspirator may: continue t to commit similar crimes after a defendant ccascs participation,
participating in ‘those: crimes. See, ¢. e. United States ve laharty, .. 295 F.3d 182, “192: 93 (2d: Cir,
2002) (co-conspirators in narcotics case continued to commit: crimes ‘without defendant during’
defendant’s incarceration); Wnited States v. Didz, 176 F.3d 52, 99 (2d Gir. 1999) (co-conspirators
in. racketeering case continued to commit crimes without defendant. after defendant’s
incarceration)..
