first two conditions are reasonably related 'to the delayed ‘production. The. threc-weck extension
of the defense’s deadline: to file:motions will:cnsure the defense. has adequate time. to review:
discovery before, finalizing | its motions and. is therefore rationally related to the two-week delay in.
this production. Similarly, the requested, laptop will expedite and. streamline the defendant’s
revicw' of discovery ‘by. avoiding technological, delays, on, the MDC. computer system, that may
otherwisé slow the défendant’s discovery review.

By. contrast, a two- weck delay in. the: completion of discovery, caused by technical
witness list or. ‘witness statements. “This” Court has already ruled that:such.a a: ‘request is premature
‘when the “partics have not: yet. engaged in. discussions regarding an appropriate schedule for
pretrial. disclosures, including Witness lists and. § 3500 material.” (Dkt. 49 at 1). The Court
accordingly ordered that the partics“ ‘mect:and confer on an appropriate schedule” “[flollowing >the:
close: of discovery:” (Id. at 2). Consistent with, that order, the Government.is prepared-to engage
in good, faith discussions with the defense ‘about, an appropriate schedule for disclosure of Jencks
Act and Giglio material. ‘The standard ‘practice in this District ‘is to: produce such‘material shortly’
in. advarice of'trial, a practice that has been widely held to be sufficient. to satisfy the requirement
that Giglio be produced. “in sufficient.time that the defendant will have a reasonable: opportunity
to act upon the information efficaciously.” United States-v. Rodri, iguez, 496 F.3d.221, 226 (24.Cir.
2007). Immediate’ disclosure of such ‘material ‘is not, warranted simply because the defendant.
prefers it. See, e.g. United States v. Wey, 15 Cr. 611 (AIN), 2017 WE 23765 1, .at.*23 (S.D-N.Y.
Jan. 18, 2017) (denying defendant’s motion for immediate disclosure of :Giglié material as
defendant “fails to articulate: any persuasive. reason why immediate. disclosure is required. in, this
case, and:the Court otherwise: secs no basis to deviate:so substantially from. the typical: practice”);
United States v. Thompson, 13 Cr. 378 (AIN), 2013 WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3, '2013)
(denying request for carly production. of. Jencks, Act material); United States v, Davis, No. 06 Cr.
9:11.(LBS), 2009 WL. 6371.64, at-*14 (S.D.N.Y. March 11, 2009) (“The Second, Circuit: has, held
that a tequest for immediate oF carly disclosure [of Giglic material] has no basis in. the law.”).
Because: the Government’s two-weck delay in completing discovery: does not entitle the defense:
to:such materials more:thanjseven months in advance of trial, the Government respectfully:requests
that the Court extend the deadline for this production to November 23, 2020 solely'on the first two
conditions, set out. bythe defense.

Other than these responsive documents from.Epstcin’s electronic devices, the Government.
‘expects to complete its: ‘production ‘of Rule:16 discovery’to the defense by the November 9, 2020
deadline. In that-vein, the Government is currently preparing‘its sixth discovery‘production fo the
defense, which, will. include, among other things, thousands of images. and. videos from. Epstein’s
cléctronic devices identified as responsive to ‘the expanded warrant, portions of 1Pads and an
iPhone seized from Epstein identified. as responsive to. the expanded. ‘warrant, 'the. four emails
quoted. in the: Government’s application. for an.cxpanded warrant, and documents from the FBI”s
Florida, files. The Government expects to: make that: sixth production to the defense on’ November
9, 2020.

Moreover, while the Government appreciates that the volunic of materials it proposes. to

produce after the deadline is large, the Government has ‘no reason to’ believe these materials will
be central, to any motion, the defendant may iseck: to.make. In, particular, as noted above, all of
