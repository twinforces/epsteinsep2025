made on behalf of the United States binds the entire
United States unless it says so affirmatively (as, in
fact, the agreement at issue here did for Epstein
himself, but not for his co-conspirators). As set forth
above, this is consistent with Santobello and Giglio,
and with ordinary principles of contract interpreta-
tion. And it is the only principled way to interpret the
plain language of this agreement, as well as the
available information on the parties’ intent.

A. Both Annabi and the opinion below were
wrongly decided under Santobello and
Giglio.

It is impossible to square the Second and Seventh
Circuit’s policies on plea agreement interpretation
with this Court’s holdings in Santobello. As this Court
correctly determined in that case, “when a plea rests
in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of
the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be part of the
inducement or consideration, such promise must be
fulfilled.” 404 U.S. at 262.

There is perhaps no promise the government makes
within a plea agreement that is more fundamental
than the promise that by pleading guilty, the defend-
ant is resolving his or her legal culpability for the
conduct at issue, and that after accepting and serving
the penalty contemplated in the agreement, he or she
can move forward without fear of additional prosecu-
tion for that conduct. A defendant should be able to
rely on a promise that the United States will not
prosecute again, without being subject to a gotcha in
some other jurisdiction that chooses to interpret that
plain language promise in some other way. Only in
this way can the pronouncement of Giglio be upheld,
for “the prosecutor’s office is an entity and as such it is
the spokesman for the Government. A promise made
