to persons ‘who are a‘part of the ‘prosccution team’ . ... who'perform investigative dutics or:make:
strategic decisions.aboutthe prosecution of the case,” including “police-officers and.federal agents
‘who submit to the direction of the ‘prosecutor and participate ‘in the investigation.” United States
i, Baréélo, 628 FE. App’x 36, 38 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting W/nited, States: v. Stewart, 433, F.3d. 273,
298 (2d Cir. 2006)).

In considering whether Rule 16 and Brady apply to:records in the possession of another
government. agency, a ‘prosecutor’s duty extends to reviewing such cvidenee only where the
Government conducts a “joint investigation” with that agency or branch of g government. See
United.States v: Middendorf, No. 18 Cr. 36 (JPO),.2018 WL.3956494, at *4-5 (S.D. N.Y. Aug. 17,
2018) (no joint investigation ‘between Government, Public Company Accounting, Oversight. Board.
(“PCAOB”) and Sccuritics and, Exchange Commission (“SEC”) where PCAOB was:not involved.
In, witness interviews or developing prosecutorial strategy, and, SEC was.not involv.ed.in'the grand.
jury ‘presentation, reviewing the fruits of ‘the Government’s investigation, or developing
prosecutorial strategy); United. States v. Collins, 409°F. Supp. 34228, 241-43 (S.D.N. Y. 201.9) (rio
joint investigation. between U.S. Attorney’s Office and SEC: where the: two entities conducted.a
small numberof joint interviews and.engaged in limited sharing of information with cach other);
United. States ‘v. Finnerty, 411 F. Supp. 2d, 428, 433 (S-D.N:Y. 2006) (no joint; investigation,
between. Government and. New’ York. Stock’ Exchange (“NYSE”) where documents sought were

“the product of aii ifivestigation that ‘was. undertaken by the NYSE of its. own practices, and ‘there
[wa]s-no suggestion that the Government participated in that investigation”). —

Morcover,.the involvement of agents from one component of an agency in.an, investigation,
does not:render the entirety: of that.agency:part of the:prosccution team. Seé, e.g, United States v:
Stein, 424. F. Supp. 2d 720, 723 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (“While. the prosecution’s disclosure obligation,
in. some circumstances ‘may extend to materials beyond the knowledge of the individual
prosccutors assigned to a.case, it'docs not extend to the collective knowledge of the entire United.
States government, or even to the entire government agency concerned.”); see also Locascio, 6
F.3d at 949 (refusing’to, impute’ to AUSAs knowledge of reports prepared by. FBI agents'who were
“uninvolved. if the: investigation or trial of the defendants”); cf United States. Ghailani. 687 F.
Supp. 2d.365, 372. (S.D.N.Y. 201.0) (holding that,.in the context of a-speedy trial motion, other
members of. the Department of Justice who were involved. in making, decisions about. timing, and.
progress of the case were part of the “government” for Rule 16 purposes).

As the foregoing precedents. récognize, the factors rélevant.in determining ‘whether an
agency: or a component’ of an agency-are part of'the prosecution team, and therefore their records
are in ‘the “possession” of the Government include whether the agency ‘or component: “(1)
participated 1 in the! prosecution’s witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting the case to the
grand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered ‘by or'shared documents with, the prosecution, (4)
‘playcd.a role :in the development of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanicd the prosecution to
court' proceedings.” Middéndorf, 2018 WL 3956494, at *4.
