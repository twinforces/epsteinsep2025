1 in terms of the registrant's obligations to appear or submit

2 reports or whatever?

3 MR. WEINBERG: I don't think I can reliably respond

4 except to say that there was some discussion about whether or
5 not he was required to physically appear in New York.

6 And my understanding from the lawyers with personal

7 knowledge is he was told that unless he was here nine or more
8 days a month, he was not required to conform to the physical

9 90-day appearance, despite being a tier 3.

10 THE COURT: He wouldn't have to come.

11 MR. WEINBERG: Right. Nobody has ever given him or
12 noticed a violation in almost ten years of daily monitoring.
13 He's not someone that just stays at one location.

14 I've got a stack from one of his lawyers that I won't
15 burden the Court with about putting on record with the Virgin
16 Islands, which is the principal monitor of his travels every
17 day, what is the transportation, where is he going to be. I
18 see letters saying, we're delayed one day. We'll be coming

19 into Palm Beach on a certain day.
20 The point being, I think, two: One, there's been no
21 violation in nine years; that he's being carefully monitored.
22 He himself is extraordinarily careful not to trigger a federal
23 SORA or a state SORNA violation, and he hasn't.
24 Two, I think that speaks to his ability to be
25 disciplined, his ability to regulate his conduct consistent
