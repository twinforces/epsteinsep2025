Re: United States-v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in. response 'to ‘the defense requests for
scaling and for an ‘i camera. hearing in. connection. with the defendant’s anticipated renewed.
application, for’bail., The Government has reviewed the proposed redactions to:the defense: letters
dated November 25, 2020 and November 30, 2020. Because those proposed, redactions ‘are
narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests, of third ‘parties, the :'Government has no objection
to the defense’s. proposed. redactions. The Government objects, however, to the defense request
for a scaled in camera hearing’ to discuss further scaling’ ‘requests from the defense. As
demonstrated by the defense’s recent Ictters, any request, for scaling of third party:information ‘can,
be made ‘in, writing with narrowly tailored ‘redactions. ‘Based on, defense counsel’s proffers
regarding the potential harms that. may. come from publicly: identifying proposed. cosigners, the
Governnient has no objection. to the redaction and scaled filing. of any identifying: information. for
those individuals. Given-the availability-of redacted filings, the: Government sces no'reason-for an.
entire hearing to be conducted-without the opportunity for the public or the:victims in this casc to
observe. Indeed, given that crime victims have a statutory right to be present and ‘heard at. any’
proceeding’ regarding the defendant’s “release,” 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4), the Government would.
object to any proceeding addressing aspects of a renewed bail. application. that. was conducted
entirely i camera.

Respectfully submitted,

AUDREY STRAUSS
Acting United States. Attorney
