fact that she, unlike Mr. Epstein, has never been suicidal and was never diagnosed as exhibiting
risk factors for suicide. Her cell is searched multiple times a day and she has been forced to
undergo numerous body scans. In addition, Ms. Maxwell’s access to the standard prison
resources available to other pretrial detainees in the general population has been extensively
curtailed or eliminated altogether.

This treatment threatens Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to participate in her
defense. This case will require time-consuming review of voluminous discovery materials. Ms.
Maxwell must therefore have adequate time to review the materials, to confidentially take notes
on them, and to discuss them with her attorneys. But there currently is no such structure in
place. Indeed, although the government agreed that Ms. Maxwell would have access to a hard
drive containing the discovery in the MDC, it is our understanding that the hard drive containing
the first production has not yet been made available to Ms. Maxwell.

Defense counsel understands that the BOP has proposed (but not yet implemented) a
procedure that would permit Ms. Maxwell to use a computer on her floor to review discovery
materials during the three-hour period each day that she is not confined to her cell. But there are
two significant flaws in this proposal:

e The three-hour period is specifically designated to be used by Ms.
Maxwell for recreation, exercise, and personal hygiene, including
showers. The BOP should not be permitted to force Ms. Maxwell to
choose between maintenance of her physical and mental health and
participating in her own defense.

e Even if Ms. Maxwell were to forgo personal maintenance altogether, three
hours a day is on its face an insufficient amount of time for reviewing
documents in a complex case with voluminous document discovery, such
as this one. As an illustration, the government’s first set of production
materials consists of nearly 13,000 pages of documents. Assuming it
takes Ms. Maxwell an average of one minute to review each page of those
materials, based on the BOP’s proposed cap of three hours per day of
review, Ms. Maxwell would conceivably finish reviewing this first set of
documents at the earliest by mid-November 2020. This is entirely
unworkable under the schedule set by the Court.

Ms. Maxwell does not seek special treatment at the MDC; but she does ask that she not
be specially disfavored in her treatment in detention, especially when it comes to preparing her
defense to conduct that allegedly took place over 25 years ago. In light of the voluminous
discovery that we expect to receive, Ms. Maxwell would normally be spending 40 hours a week
or more reviewing the discovery. Ms. Maxwell should be granted a comparable amount of time
