THE COURT: Thank, you, MS. Moe.

Mr. Cohen, you may proceed.

MR, COHEN: Thank, you, your Honor. Thank, ‘you, very
much for the opportunity to be heard and also for accommodating
tis with, regard to ‘the briefing schedule. We appréciate that,
your Honor.

Your Honor, this, is a very important proceeding for imy
client. It is critical and we submit, as. we laid out in our
papers, that undér the Bail Reform Act and related case law;

none of which, by the way, was discussed in the government's

presentation, she is == she ought. to be released 6n a bail
package with strict conditions, your Honor.

And, frankly, in order t6 defend a case like this
during the COVED crisis, with the extent of discovery which was
discussed éarlieér ih the proceeding, that's going to take the
government. until November to preduce to us, the notion, of
preparing a défense with our Glient while she is an custody
under these conditions is just mot realistic.

I would also liké to take a moment, your Honér, to
address a few things. As we noted in our papers, our client, is
not Jéffréy Epstein, and she Has been the target 6f essentially

endless media spin, that apparently the government. has picked up

in. its reply brief and in its presentation. today, trying to

portray her before the court as a ruthless, aimless, sinister

person.
