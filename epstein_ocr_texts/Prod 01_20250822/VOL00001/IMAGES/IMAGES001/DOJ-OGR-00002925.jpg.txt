Re: United States. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20. Gr.:330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:
The: defense ‘has been, steadfastly and.diligently preparing ‘for'a, July 12"trial based on the
‘original indictment, a.date sct on the condition that there would be no superseding indictment.
adding substantive:charges. The recently ‘filed superseding indictment directly contravenes that
agreement and.adds two ‘new'charges which vastly'cxpand the relevant time-period from a four-
year period in:the 1990s to: an cleven-ycar period.stretching from 1994 to 2004. These additions
significantly alter the scope of the government’s case and. necessarily shift:the focus of the
‘defense’s trial préparation. Instead of being focused on mounting a defense to the allegations of
the three: accusers from the 1990s, as we have been. doing, the defense will now-have to spend
considerable time and, resources, investigating allegations of new conduct. in a completely.
‘different:time period. involving numerous additional witnesses, and ‘with all of the difficultics:that'
COVID restrictions still place on,a, meaningful defense: investigation.

We do not:want-to postpone the trial but have no choice but to ask for’a,continuance. The
government bears:responsibility for this:nced, having filed a late-breaking superseding

‘indictment; based-on‘a-witness who has been/known fo the government since the Florida
