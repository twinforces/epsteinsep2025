(Ud.). Nevertheless, she has “no hesitation” posting her home because she knows “in every
fibre of | her] being” that Ms. Maxwell “will never try to flee.” (/d.).

Similarly, another surety who has agreed to sign a $3.5 million bond writes:

This amount represents the value of effectively all of my assets, including my

home es If I lost these assets

because Ghislaine violated the conditions of her release, I would be

financially ruined. I make this pledge without reservation because I know that

Ghislaine will remain in the United States to face the charges against her.

(Ex. F). Two other sureties, one of whom is a U.S. citizen and resident, will post cash bonds
in the amount of $25,000, and another will post $2,000 in cash, which are significant
pledges for these individuals.

In addition to these bonds, the security company that will provide security services to
Ms. Maxwell upon her transfer into home confinement has agreed to post a $1 million bond
in support of her bail application. In our collective experience as defense counsel, we are
not aware of a previous example where a security company has posted a bond for a
defendant. The head of the security company has confirmed that they have never done this
for a defendant in the past but are willing to do so here because of his company’s “long-
standing relationship with Ms. Maxwell” and because he is “confident that she will not try
to flee.” (Ex. S).

In sum, these bonds reflect the depth of support that Ms. Maxwell has from her
family and friends, who are risking their livelihoods, their safety, and their ability to live
without constant media harassment to support her. (See Ex. B) (“Absolutely anyone who
dares to put their head above the parapet so to speak, to ... support Ghislaine personally, gets it
shot off immediately amid a hail of social vilification and malignancy and reputational
slaughtering.””). Ms. Maxwell would never destroy those closest to her by fleeing, after they
have risked so much to support her.
