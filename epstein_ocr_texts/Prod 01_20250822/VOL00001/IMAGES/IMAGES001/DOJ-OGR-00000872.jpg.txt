nationality is assessed at the time the offense was committed, any loss of nationality subsequent
to said offense has no bearing upon the removal proceedings and shall not supersede said
assessment of nationality.”! Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. The Defendant, meanwhile, relies on the
opinion of a French legal expert who argues that nationality is assessed at the time of the
extradition request. See Reply, Ex. A411. The Defendant’s expert concedes that there is no
case law addressing this precise issue. /d. § 21.

Exacerbating the uncertainty is the fact that the relevant legal materials also lend
themselves to multiple interpretations. For instance, Article 3(1) the Extradition Treaty between
the United States and France of April 23, 1996 provides that “[t]here is no obligation upon the
Requested State to grant the extradition of a person who is a national of the Requested State, but
the executive authority of the United States shall have the power to surrender a national of the
United States if, in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person
sought shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was committed.” See Reply,
Ex. A J 9 (emphasis added)). Article 694-4 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure similarly
provides that “Extradition shall not be granted . . . [w]hen the person claimed has French
nationality, the latter being assessed at the time of the offense for which extradition is
requested.”” Jd. § 10; see also Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2. Thus, there is considerable uncertainty
as to the relevance of the Defendant’s offer of renunciation of her French citizenship to her
ability to frustrate, if not entirely bar, extradition. The Court’s assessment of the risks largely
' The Court cites the translated version of the letter, though the original letter is in French.

* Here, there are minor discrepancies between the two sides’ respective translations. The
translated letter from the Ministry of Justice cites Article 694-4 as reading, “When the individual
claimed to have French citizenship, said citizenship having been assessed at the time of the
offense on the basis of which removal is being requested.” Gov’t Opp’n, Ex. A at 2.
