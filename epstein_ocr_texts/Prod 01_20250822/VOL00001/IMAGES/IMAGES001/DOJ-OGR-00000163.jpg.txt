On February 21, 2019, the district court granted the
CVRA case petitioners’ Motion for Partial Summary
Judgment, ruling that the government violated the
CVRA in failing to advise the victims about its
intention to enter into the NPA.* The court also found
that letters the government sent to victims after
the NPA was signed, describing the investigation as
ongoing, “mislead [sic] the victims to believe that
federal prosecution was still a possibility.” The court
also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure to
communicate with the victims while at the same time
engaging in “lengthy negotiations” with Epstein’s
counsel and assuring the defense that the NPA would
not be “made public or filed with the court.” The court
ordered the parties to submit additional briefs
regarding the appropriate remedies. After the court’s
order, the Department recused the USAO from the
CVRA litigation and assigned the U.S. Attorney’s
Office for the Northern District of Georgia to handle
the case for the government. Among the remedies
sought by the petitioners, and opposed by the govern-
ment, was rescission of the NPA and federal prosecution
of Epstein.
