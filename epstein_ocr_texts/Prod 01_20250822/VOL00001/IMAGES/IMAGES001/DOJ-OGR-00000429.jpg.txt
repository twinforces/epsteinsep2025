1 THE COURT: Go ahead.

2 MR. WEINGARTEN: On the statutory rape thing, I had a
3 senior moment. There is no statutory rape because there is no
4 penetration, and that is the answer to that question.

S THE COURT: All right.

6 We will set this down for a detention hearing on

7 Thursday, July 11, for the continuation of the detention

8 hearing. Thursday, July 11, at 2 p.m.

9 The defendant is detained at least until the

10 continuation of the detention hearing pursuant to 18 United

11 States Code 3142(f).

12 I have been advised by Judge Berman that he wants to
13 see counsel right after these proceedings. Judge Berman's

14 courtroom is 17B. So counsel and Mr. Epstein should go to 17B.
15 All right. Anything else from the government?

16 MR. ROSSMILLER: Your Honor, ordinarily we would ask
17 to exclude speedy trial time, but I think because we are going
18 directly to Judge Berman, we have no such application.

19 THE COURT: Mr. Weingarten, anything else?
20 MR. WEINGARTEN: No, thank you, your Honor.
21 THE COURT: Mr. Weingarten, anything else?
22 MR. WEINGARTEN: No, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: All right. Thank you all.
