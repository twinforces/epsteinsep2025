Honorable Richard M. Berman
United, States District. Judge:
July 12, 2019

The defendant, through counsel, continues to evidence! a complete lack’ of appreciation for
the gravity of the offenses with which he-is chargéd.' As.an initial matter, there can be no plausible:
suggestion:that the:allegations against the defendant involve isolated or. abcrrational conduct; they.
involve :repeated, regular. acts of sexual. abuse committed. over a. period of many years. And.
following the: defendant’s prior conviction, ‘as described previously. by the Government, the
defendant-continucd,to‘maintain at Icast;hundreds and possibly thousands of nude’photos of young
subjects. The defendant’s victinis in. this case, often ‘particularly vulnerable girls, were as ‘young:
as 14 years.old when. he. abused them. The defendant knew he was abusing, minors,.:ineluding,
because: victims told. him directly they were underage. And he preyed.on his victims habitually
and repeatedly—day after day, month after month, year after ycar.

The defense calls these disturbing, alleged, acts “simple-prostitution.”? Mag. Tr. 12:12? see:
also. D. Tr. at 6:15-19 (“This is basically the Feds today’. . . redoing the same. conduct. that was
investigated 10 years ago and. calling, it, instead .of: prostitution, calling it: sex. trafficking”). That.
characterization, isnot only offensive ‘but also ‘utterly: irrelevant: given, that federal law does not
recognize ‘the concept ofa child prostitute—there are only trafficking victims—because a child.
cannot: legally consent, to being exploited. Defense counsel’s repeated assertion that the
Government’s ‘case. is infitni, because.;no threats or coercion are alleged—e.g:, Mag. Tr. at 12
(There: was ‘no coercion. There-were no threats. There was no violence. ”,, ‘7 (“there was no
coercion. There was no intimidation. There is ‘no deception. ”); Release Motion at 2 (“There are:
no allegations .. . that he forced, coerced, defrauded, or enslaved anybody .. . .”)—is equally:
irrelevant: because the offense with which the defendant-has been charged requires no such proof:
See; 6.g., United. States v. Afvare, 632 EF. App’x 272, 278.(6th Cir. 201.6) (“We hold that § 1591(a)
criminalizes the sex.trafficking of:children.(less than ‘18 years old) with or without-any force, fraud,
or. coercion, and it also criminalizes the ‘sex trafficking of adults (18 or older), but only if doneby:
force, fraud, or coercion.”).

Far more important, the defense has alréady effectively conceded thatthe Government. will
be able to present evidence of the actual. primary clements of the charged offensc—i-c., that the
defendant engaged i in.sex acts. for money with girls he knew-were: underage. Sce:-Release Motion.
at 2.. On this record, the Government. agrees ‘with Pretrial Services that the defendant should. be
detained pending’ trial. He poses a tremendous risk of flight'and a danger, to the community, and.
he cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of detention in. this case.

' Such arguments are unsurprising from a defendant who previously: compared himsclf to a “person
who stéals.a. bagel” or a'tragic mythical figure. See, e.g., Amber Southerland, Billionaire Jeffrey:
Epstein: I'm. a-sex offender, not a pr edator, N.Y. Post (2011) (“I’m not a sexual-predator, I’m an.
“offender,” the: financier told The Post. yesterday: ‘It’s the difference between. a:murderer and.a
person. who stcals a-bagel.””); Philip Weiss, /he /antasist, NY Magazine (2007) (“It’s the Icarus
story, somcone who flics too close'to'the: sun,’ | said. “Did Icarus like massages?’ Epstcin asked.”).
