Cassel 217 /ct00 Paataivient BOa)rAdit BA62 FikWbESOB/ Phgehoe of 666

hearing, a judicial officer finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably
assure the defendant’s appearance as required. and the safety of any other person. and. the
community. 18°U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1). The government bears the burden ‘of proving flight risk: by
a-prepondcranec of the evidenee and dangerousness to any other person or'the: community by clear:
and convincing evidence. Witited States %. Cisneros, 328.F.3d 610, 616 (10th.Cir. 2003). A district.
‘court’s review: of a Magistrate Judge’s order of detention is'de:noyo. See Cisneros, 328 F.3d at:
616:

Section 3:142(c)(2) creates a rebuttable presumption.that no condition or combinations of
conditions exist to reasonably. assure a defendant’s appearance or the safety of the community
wheré thére is probable cause to bélicve the defendant violated ‘18 U.S.C. § 924(c). See 18 U-S.C.
§ 3142(c)(3)(B). .As the Tenth. Circuit has held:

Onec'the presumption. is invoked, the burden, of’production shifts to the defendant.

However; the burden of persuasion regarding risk-of-flight and danger to ‘the

production. is not heavy, but some evidence ‘must be produced. Even if a

defendant’s burden. of production is met, the presumption. remains a. factor for

consideration by the district court.in determining whether to release’ or detain.
United States v:, Stricklin, 932 F.2d 1353,,1354-55 (10th Cir. 19911).

Here, although Mr. Robertson is: subject to a presumption of detention. duc to his § 924(c)
charge, se Doc. 86 at 1=2, the Court. finds that he has successfully. rebutted the presumption. He
has ‘produced evidence, for ‘example, that he is nota danger to the community:‘nor a flight risk:
because he voluntarily turned himself in on the ‘instant. offense, despite consistently maintaining
his innocence and.knowing the extremely long prison sentence he faced if convicted. Doc. 274 at:
5. He:has also produced.evidence that he will not flee:the:jurisdiction.duc to his family’s presence
here. Jd. And he has, produced evidence: that his. placement. at La‘Pasada. Halfway House is. a.

condition of release that could.reasonably assure his appearance and the safety of the community.
