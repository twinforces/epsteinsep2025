1 individual. However, he was also a thief. He stole Jennifer's
2 childhood dreams, her innocence and her self-confidence. She

3 was 14 years old. What he could not buy, he forcibly took.

4 Why? Because he surrounded himself with a network of powerful
5 people who not only looked the other way, but also actively

6 facilitated and participated in his sexual abuse of children.

7 Jeffrey Epstein thought he was above the law, and

8 essentially he was until now. The system let Jennifer and the
9 other victims down, but it does not have to end here. We ask
10 the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI to bring all of

11 Epstein's enablers and co-conspirators to justice.

12 It has taken Jennifer 18 years to find her voice, and
13 again, Jeffrey Epstein has tried to silence her. While she

14 will never have her chance to face him in court, he no longer
15 has any power over her. Today, this brave survivor will be

16 heard.

17 MS. AROZ: Thank you for allowing me to be able to

18 have my chance in court today, to be able to tell you what this
19 horrific man did to my life. You can't even imagine how much
20 it affected my childhood, all the way through my adult life.
21 He robbed me of my dreams. He robbed me of my chance to pursue
22 a career I always adored. He stole my chance at really feeling
23 love because I was so scared to trust anyone for so many years
24 that I had such severe anxiety. I didn't want to leave my
25 house let alone my bed.
