the NPA’s language and structure, as well as the manner in which it was negotiated, were highly
atypical. The result was a one-off agreement that deviated in several material respects from, and
bore little resemblance to, a standard agreement.

The Department of Justice’s OPR, after investigating Acosta’s handling of the Epstein
case, characterized the NPA as a “unique resolution.” Exh. B (Dep’t of Justice, Office of
Professional Responsibility, Executive Summary of Report, Investigation into the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida’s Resolution of its 2006-2008 Federal
Criminal Investigation of Jeffrey Epstein and Its Interactions with Victims during the
Investigation, November 2020) at x. In particular, the OPR concluded that Acosta “agreed to
several unusual and problematic terms in the NPA without the consideration required under the
circumstances.” Jd. While the co-conspirator immunity provision appears to be one of the terms
to which the OPR was referring, the government is bound by it.

A. The Structure of the NPA

The NPA is a seven-page document consisting of several factual recitals (NPA at 1-2), a
paragraph providing for the non-prosecution of Epstein if he complies with the NPA (id. at 2), a
list of enumerated “terms” (id. at 5), and, finally, five separate paragraphs containing various
provisions, including the co-conspirator immunity provision at issue here (id. at 5). Although it
contains no defined terms other than “State Attorney’s Office” and “Epstein,” the NPA clearly
separates “the United States” as a whole from the USAO-SDFL, repeatedly referring explicitly to
the USAO where such a limitation is intended. See, e.g., id. at 3 (“Epstein shall provide to the
U.S. Attorney’s Office copies of all proposed agreements... .””); id. at 5 (“the United States
Attorney has no authority” to bind state prosecutors); id. at 6 (“Epstein hereby requests that the
United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such prosecution”). Thus, the
