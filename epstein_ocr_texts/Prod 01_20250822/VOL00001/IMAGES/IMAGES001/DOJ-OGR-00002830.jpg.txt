Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, and Westchester. See id. Yet, what the statutory'law leaves

‘For example, if Schulte had-alleged that the juror questionnaire form.displayed systematic.
exclusion, see supra 4n. 1, then the qualified wheel would be the appropriate jury venire for
comparison. Bécause he does, not do that, the:master wheel must be the relevant venire..
