Second, the Government does not expect the S2 Indictment to have a significant effect on
the overall length of the trial, because the Government remains committed to a streamlined
presentation of evidence that primarily focuses on the experiences of the specific minor victims
referenced in the indictment. While the Government expects to call a number of additional
witnesses as a result of the new allegations contained in the S2 Indictment, including, of course,
Minor Victim-4, the Government’s overall estimation of the trial length has not significantly
changed. In particular, at the July 14, 2020 conference, the Government estimated that “its case
in chief would take no more than two weeks,” but “propose[d] blocking three weeks for trial” in
total. (July 14, 2020 Tr. at 20). Given the need to call additional witnesses, the Government now
estimates that its case-in-chief will now take up to three weeks.” Accordingly, the Government
would propose reserving four weeks for trial in this matter.

The Government further proposes that if the length of the trial is of concern, the Court may
wish to conduct jury selection during the week of July 6, 2021 and/or make use of a jury
questionnaire, so that a jury can be seated and the trial can proceed immediately on July 12, 2021.
Such practices have been adopted in this District for other high-profile cases where jury selection
is expected to take longer than usual. See, e.g., United States v. Skelos, 15 Cr. 317 (KMW) (making
use of jury questionnaire provided to venire approximately one week in advance of trial to
streamline jury selection); United States v. Percoco, 16 Cr. 776 (VEC) (same).

Third, the Government has taken and will continue to take multiple steps to ensure that the
> These estimates assume the defendant will agree to standard stipulations obviating the need for
custodians of records and similar witnesses. Should she not, the length of the trial may be
somewhat longer, although that of course would have been true even absent the obtaining of a
superseding indictment. In addition, while the Government has tried to account for anticipated
cross-examinations in its estimates, the length and scope of cross-examination is obviously not
within the Government’s control.
