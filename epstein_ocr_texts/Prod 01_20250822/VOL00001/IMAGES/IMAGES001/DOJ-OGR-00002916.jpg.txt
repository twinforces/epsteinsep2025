Second, the Government does:not expect the $2 Indictment to have a significant effect on.
the overall. length of the trial, because the Government remains. committed to a. streamlined.
‘presentation of évidence: that primarily focuses on the experiences of the specific minor victims
referenced in. the indictment. While: the Government expects to call. a number of additional
witnesses as a result of the new allegations. contained, in'the S2 ‘Indictment, including, of course,
Minor Victim-4, the Government’s. overall, estimation .of the trial length has not significantly’
changed. In particular, at the July 14,2020 conference, the Government estimated that. “its ‘case:
in chicf'would take no more than. two wecks,” but “propose[d] blocking’ threc: weeks for trial” in
total. (July 14, 2020 Tr. .at:20).. Given the need to call. additional witnesses, the Government now:
estimates that. its case-in-chicf will now take up to three weeks.” Accordingly, the Government.
would, propose reserving: four'weeks for'trial in’this ‘matter.

The Government further proposes'that.if the length of the trial. is ‘of concern, the Court.may
wish, to conduct jury ‘selection during ‘the weck of July 6, 202 and/or make use of a. jury
questionnaire, so that a jury can be séated. and the trial can proccéd immicdiately on July 12, 202.1.
Such practices have been adopted in this District for other high-profile cases where, jury selection.
is expected to take longer than usual. See, ¢.g:, Wnited States’y, Skelos, 15 Cr. 317 (KMW) (making
usc ‘of jury questionnaire provided. to ‘venire. approximately one. Weck: in, advance. of: trial. to
streamline jury selection); United States v, Pereoco, 16: Cr. 776 (VEC) (same).

Third, the Government. has taken.and will continue to take multiple steps to ensure that-the

* These estimates assume the defendant will agrec to standard stipulations obviating the, need. for
custodians of ‘records and similar witnesses. ‘Should she ‘not, the length of the trial may: be
Somewhat longér,..although that of. course Would have. been triie,.cven. absent the obtaining of' a,
superseding indictment. .In addition, while the Government. has tried to account ‘for anticipated
cross-cxaminations in its estimates, the length, and. scope of cross-cxamination is obviously: not:
within, the Government’s control.
