48 at 6 J 8; see also DE 99 at 3, and government attorneys have on multiple occasions offered to
confer with Petitioners, see, e.g., July 11, 2008 Hr’g Tr. at 13 (“TI will always confer, sit down
with Jane Doe | and 2, with the two agents and Ms. Villafana. We’ll be happy to sit down with
them.”). Indeed, on December 10, 2010, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of
Florida, accompanied by supervisory and line prosecutors from the USAO-SDFL, personally
conferred with Petitioners’ counsel and with Petitioner Jane Doe #1 and entertained discussion
about Petitioners’ desires to see Epstein criminally prosecuted on federal charges.’ The United
States Attorney and prosecutors in the USAO-SDFL have also corresponded with Petitioners’
counsel on multiple occasions about Petitioners’ desires to have Epstein criminally prosecuted on
federal charges.*

Acetone,
a: number of districts outside the Southern District of Florida (e.g., the Southern
District of New York and the District of New Jersey) share jurisdiction and venue with the
Southern District of Florida over potential federal criminal charges based on the alleged sexual
acts committed by Epstein against the Petitioners. Epstein is thus subject to potential
prosecution for such acts in those districts. Furthermore, because of the nature of the allegations
against Epstein, the filing of such potential charges against Epstein still remains temporally
viable; charges for such sexual activities involving minors are not barred by the applicable

’ The United States Attorney also offered to confer with Jane Doe #2, but Jane Doe #2
declined the invitation and did not attend the meeting that was scheduled with the United States
Attorney.

* Since that time, the USAO-SDFL has been recused by the Department of Justice from
prospective responsibility for any criminal investigation or potential prosecution relating to
Epstein’s alleged sexual activities with minor females. The Department of Justice has reassigned
responsibility for the investigation and potential prosecution of such criminal matters in the
Southern District of Florida to the United States Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of
Florida for consideration of any prosecutorial action that may be authorized and appropriate.
