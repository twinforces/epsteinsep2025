RE: Crime Victims’ Rights Act Implications Regarding Unsealing of Grand Jury
Materials in Epstein Proceedings
Case: United States of America v. Jeffrey Epstein
Case No.: 19 CR 490 (RMB)
Dear Judge Berman:
We represent numerous survivors of Jeffrey Epstein, including several individuals whose names and
identifying information appear in the subject materials. In that vein, we write to address the
Department of Justice’s request to unseal grand jury materials and to respectfully urge the Court to
administer any disclosure in a manner that fully honors the victims’ rights under the Crime Victims’
Rights Act (““CVRA”), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, the enduring interests protected by Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit precedent.
I. Victims’ CVRA Rights Are Directly Implicated and Must Be Considered in Context—
Not in a Vacuum
The CVRA guarantees victims:
