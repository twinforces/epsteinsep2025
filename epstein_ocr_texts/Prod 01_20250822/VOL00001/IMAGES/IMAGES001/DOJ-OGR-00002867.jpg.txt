Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government writes to notify the Court that today, a Grand Jury sitting in Manhattan
returned a superseding indictment in the above-captioned case (the “S2 Indictment”).! The
Government respectfully submits this letter (1) to identify the differences between the charges
contained in the S2 Indictment and the charges contained in the prior indictment, S1 20 Cr. 330
(AJIN) (the “S1 Indictment’); (2) to address the impact, if any, of the S2 Indictment on the status
of discovery and other disclosures; and (3) to address the impact of the S2 Indictment on the
currently pending motions.

' The Government noted in its February 26, 2021 Omnibus Memorandum of Law in Opposition
to the Defendant’s Pretrial Motions that its investigation remained ongoing and that the
Government would seek a superseding indictment no later than three months prior to trial. At this
juncture, while the Government’s investigation is still ongoing, if trial remains set for July 12,
2021 as scheduled, then the Government does not intend to seek any further indictments in this
case. To the extent the Government uncovers additional evidence that it may seek to introduce at
trial, it will promptly disclose such evidence to the defense as either Rule 16 or Jencks Act material.
Additionally, the Government remains cognizant that its Brady obligations remain ongoing and
will promptly disclose any exculpatory evidence of which it becomes aware.
