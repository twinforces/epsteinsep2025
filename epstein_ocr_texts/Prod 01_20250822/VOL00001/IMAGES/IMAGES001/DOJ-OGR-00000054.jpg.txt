District of Florida, and not in the Southern District of

New York. United States v. Maxwell, 118 F.4th 256,

261 (2d Cir. 2024). The Maxwell court found that

it must “affirmatively appear[] that the agreement

contemplates a broader restriction” in order for the

“United States” to mean the country as a whole, even

if entered into in a district in which the term “United

States” does, in fact, mean the country as a whole.

Id. at 263.

Seventh Circuit. Although the Seventh Circuit
has not considered the question presented in the
specific context of the enforceability of a promise
made in a plea agreement against a different U.S.
Attorney’s office, it has held in a related context that
“[a] prosecutor’s agreement will not bind more than
the office of the United States Attorney unless the
promise explicitly contemplates ‘a broader restriction.”
Thompson v. United States, 431 F. App’x 491, 493
(7th Cir. 2011) (finding that a promise on behalf of the
government by a prosecutor would not bind the INS).
See also United States v. McDowell, No. 94-CR-787-1,
2006 WL 1896074 (N.D. Ill. 2006) (finding in the
context of Rule 35(b) motions that “a United States
Attorney has sole authority to bind his own office” only
and lacks authority to compel a U.S. Attorney in
another district to file a Rule 35(b) motion).

II. The Second Circuit’s decision below is wrong
and violates the principles set forth in this
Court’s prior opinions.

The opinion below, which is based on the Second
Circuit’s prior holding in Annabi, is wrongly decided
and should not stand. Rather than the Second
Circuit’s default rule that a promise made on behalf of
the United States does not bind the United States as
a whole, the default rule should be that a promise
