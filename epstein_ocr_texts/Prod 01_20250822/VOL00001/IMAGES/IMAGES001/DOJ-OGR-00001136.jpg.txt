F. The Proposed Bail Package Is Expansive and.Far Exceeds What Is
Necessary to Reasonably Assure Ms. Maxwell’s Presence in Court

In light of the additional information that Ms. Maxwell has provided .in connection
with this submission, which responds to each of the concerns raised by the government at
the initial bail hearing, the government cannot meet its burden to establish that no set of bail
conditions would reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s appearance in:court. The proposed bail
package is exceptional in its scope, addresses all of the factors that the Court considered in
evaluating risk of flight, and is more than sufficient to: warrant her release from BOP
custody and transfer to restricted home detention.

Courts in this Circuit have ordered release of high-profile defendants with financial
means and foreign citizenship:on bonds in lower amounts with less or no security with similar or

less restrictive conditions:
