Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 148 Filed 02/04/21 Page 21 of 23
VII. Motion for Accelerated Disclosure of 404(b) Evidence
The defense requests that the Court direct the government to disclose any and all acts
and any evidence it intends to introduce under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence
or as background of the conspiracy charged in the Indictment.
Ms. Maxwell should be put on notice as soon as possible of the exact nature of any
404(b) evidence, the witnesses pertaining thereto, the documents in support thereof and the
theory upon which the government asserts admissibility rests. By providing prompt notification,
the defense can investigate the allegations and file appropriate motions to permit the Court to
make pretrial determinations regarding the admissibility of any potential Rule 404(b) evidence
proffered by the government. We have conferred with the government and requested that all
Rule 404(b) evidence be provided by March 12, 2021, but the government has denied this
request. We therefore request that the Court order the government to produce all Rule
404(b) evidence by that date.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, we respectfully request that the Court grant the motions
presented in their entirety.
