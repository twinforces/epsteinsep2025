There are no reasonable conditions to assure that:as,a. pretrial detainee Ms. Maxwell will
be. as prepared for trial as.4.defendant on. bail. Permitting Ms. Maxwell to use the laptop on,
weekends and holidays is:a reasonable and. minimum accommodation for the difficulties entailed
in, reviewing ‘enormous amounts of electronic discovery, and one that imposes no’burden. on the:
BOP nor any sceurity issues. The Court’s order directing the MDC to permit Ms.’Maxwell
access tothe computer on'weckends and holidays should remain in, cffcct.

Very. truly yours,

BOBBI C. STERNHEIM.
