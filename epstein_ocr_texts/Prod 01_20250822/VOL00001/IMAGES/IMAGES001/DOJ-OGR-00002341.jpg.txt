There are no reasonable conditions to assure that as a pretrial detainee Ms. Maxwell will

be as prepared for trial as a defendant on bail. Permitting Ms. Maxwell to use the laptop on
weekends and holidays is a reasonable and minimum accommodation for the difficulties entailed
in reviewing enormous amounts of electronic discovery, and one that imposes no burden on the
BOP nor any security issues. The Courtâ€™s order directing the MDC to permit Ms. Maxwell
access to the computer on weekends and holidays should remain in effect.

Very truly yours,

BOBBI C. STERNHEIM
