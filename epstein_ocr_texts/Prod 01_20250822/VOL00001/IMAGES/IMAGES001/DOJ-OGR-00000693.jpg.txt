Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document53_ Filed 09/03/19 Page 55 of 86 55
J8RPEPS2

1 experience for the last 17 years has been a dark corner in my

2 story, in my life, in my life story and that has been

3 definitely made worse by my own self-shame and that -- and

4 anger for normalizing all of the red flags. I feel like we are
5 conditioned to do that, and that's something that needs to

6 change.

7 So I'm here today, you know, I'm coming forward

8 because it is time to bring light to that darkness, and it's

9 time to replace that darkness with light. And I am a survivor
10 of this, and I do aim to progress further from being a

11 Survivor, you know. I feel I've worked hard, quite hard, to

12 get to where I'm at now, and I'm definitely at a place in my

13 life where I will no longer cover up. I'll no longer cover up
14 what needs to be brought to light.

15 Jeffrey is no longer here, and the women that helped
16 him are, Ghislaine Maxwell. My experience is with Ghislaine

17 Maxwell and Sarah Kellen, and they definitely need to be held
18 accountable for helping him, helping themselves, helping one

19 another carry on this huge, almost like a system. So they need
20 to be held accountable, all of them, and I would like to see
21 that, certainly on behalf of myself and for everyone here.
22 Thank you.
23 THE COURT: Thanks so much.
24 MS. McCAWLEY: Our next client, who is going to speak
25 this morning, is Virginia Roberts Giuffre.
