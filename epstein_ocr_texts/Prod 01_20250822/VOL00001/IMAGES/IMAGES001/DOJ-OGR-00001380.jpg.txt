inmate, few of which are preparing for trial. Over 97% of criminal
defendants plead guilty and, therefore, need far less time with their
lawyers. Of the remaining 3% who do proceed to trial, the vast majority
are out on bond. For those few in custody, how many involve anonymous
accusations that are decades old and 2.7 million pages?” And how often is
such a defendant forced to prepare her case during a pandemic where
in-person lawyer visits are unsafe and impractical? It is no wonder that
courts around the country are ordering temporary release under § 3142()
for the few defendants who are trying to prepare for trial during the
pandemic.

The Government’s weak response is that Ms. Maxwell only
mentioned temporary release at the first bail hearing. The Government
suggests waiver, without saying it. Nonsense. Ms. Maxwell has repeatedly
pressed her inability to effectively prepare her defense, which 1s properly

“To illustrate, for Ms. Maxwell to review the 2.7 million pages, she
would have to do it, page by page, on a computer screen. If she spent only
1 minute per page, it would take 45,000 hours or 3,750 days (at 12 hours
a day), without taking any notes, without discussing a single page with
her lawyers, and not including the discovery that is on the way. Although
the Government labels this new discovery “non-testifying witness
discovery,” it really is Brady material which severely undermines the
already weak case.
