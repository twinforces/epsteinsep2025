Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document126 Filed 01/25/21 Page 11 of 13

Thus, regardless of whether the White Plains qualified jury wheel is compared to the
eligible juror population of the Manhattan Division or that of the entire District, Black and
Hispanic jurors are systematically underrepresented. Ms. Maxwell has therefore made a prima
facie showing of a violation of the fair cross-section requirement.

Accordingly, the government has the burden of showing that attainment of a fair cross-
section would have been incompatible with a significant state interest. The government cannot
do so. To the extent that the government asserts a significant state interest in containing
COVID-19, it cannot show that attainment of a fair cross-section would have been incompatible
with that interest. As noted above, a Manhattan grand jury convened as early as June 25, 2020;
there appears to have been no reason, other than a publicity-driven desire to arrest Ms. Maxwell
on the anniversary of the Epstein indictment, why the government could not have waited until
that time. The indictment therefore violates Ms. Maxwellâ€™s Sixth Amendment right and should
be dismissed.
