resolved the allegations against himself and any potential co-conspirator. Faced with significant
public pressure, the government broke that agreement and brought an indictment against Epstein,
and only Epstein, in 2016. The charges were ultimately dismissed because Epstein died while in
federal custody. Left with no fish to attempt to fry, the government, belatedly, turned to Ms.
Maxwell.

It is inexcusable that decades have passed while the government investigated Epstein,
resolved the allegations against him by plea and non-prosecution agreements, and then changed

discussing these matters for fear of media vilification or, as with Ms. Maxwell, tactical
indictment by default. Meanwhile, the Epstein story continues to occupy the public’s attention
with various iterations and conflations including multiple books, podcasts, and television series
available to alleged witnesses, posers, attention-seekers, copy-cats, and opportunists for study
and exploitation.

The primary guarantees against excessive preindictment delay and the prosecution of
overly stale criminal charges are statutes of limitation for criminal offenses. United States v.

is found or the information is instituted within five years next after such offense shall have been
committed.” The government will argue that a much longer statute of limitation applies to the
