Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the defense letter dated
October 23, 2020 in the above-referenced case (the “Defense Letter”). For all of its innuendo and
accusations, the Defense Letter is at base an effort to preview again motions that the Court has
already found to be premature, and to cast the Government’s efforts to be transparent with the
Court and the defense in a nefarious and deeply misleading light. The Government writes to
correct the inaccuracies in the Defense Letter, to update the Court regarding the status of the
Government’s ongoing discovery productions, and to address the defense complaints regarding
the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”).

1. The Government Has and Will Continue to Satisfy Its Discovery Obligations

The Defense Letter raises numerous accusations, including that the Government has
“abandon[ed]” the discovery deadlines in this case. (Def. Ltr. 1). The Government strongly
disagrees, and notes that it has produced considerable Rule 16 discovery to the defense, which, to
date, consists of more than 350,000 pages. Contrary to the defense’s assertions, that discovery
does include both “[c]Jorroborating [i]nformation” regarding the conduct charged in this case as
well as potentially “[e]xculpatory [e]vidence,” (Def. Ltr. 3), and the Government remains available
to discuss that material with defense counsel. Moreover, in anticipation of the November 9, 2020
discovery deadline, the Government is preparing to make additional productions, including a
production of electronic discovery, which will consist of over 1.2 million documents from devices
seized from Jeffrey Epstein’s residences.’ In that regard, the Government is currently waiting on
' Despite the defense’s insinuations to the contrary, this is entirely consistent with the schedule
ordered by the Court. Specifically, the Court ordered the Government to produce “[i]nitial non-
electronic discovery, generally to include search warrant applications and subpoena returns” by
August 21, 2020, and the Government made three productions containing those materials, and
more, by August 21, 2020. (Order dated July 15, 2020, Dkt. No. 25). It is the Government’s
expectation that its upcoming productions will substantially complete its production of Rule 16
discovery. As is not uncommon in a case of this magnitude, however, it is possible that the
