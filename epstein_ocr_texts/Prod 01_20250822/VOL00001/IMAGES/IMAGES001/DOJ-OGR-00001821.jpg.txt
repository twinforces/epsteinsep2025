these materials come from devices seized from Epstein’s residences, and none of the devices is
believed to have belonged to the defendant. Further, of the approximately 1.2 million documents
to be produced, only a handful were specifically relied upon by the Government in the investigation
that led to the charges in the current Indictment, ' and the Government intends to produce those
documents on November 9 with the rest of the sixth production. Additionally, as a result of the
work being completed by the vendor, these materials will be produced to the defense in a manner
that is readily sortable and searchable which should facilitate and expedite its review.

The Government therefore respectfully requests that the Court extend the deadline for
production of documents being prepared by an outside vendor to November 23, 2020, and that the
Court similarly extend the motions schedule in this case by three weeks as requested by the
defense.

Respectfully submitted,

‘Tn particular, the application in support of the July 2020 warrant included quotations from four

documents to the defense by November 9, 2020.
