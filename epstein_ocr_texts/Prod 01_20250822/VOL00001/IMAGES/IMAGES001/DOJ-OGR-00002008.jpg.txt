E. The Discovery: Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of
the Government's Allegations Against:Ms. Maxwell

At the initial. bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence
in this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged.victims were “backed up [by]
contemporaneous documents. . . [including] flight:records, diary entries, business records,
and other evidence.” (Dkt. 4.at 5.) The Court credited those representations and. accepted
the government’s proffer'that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant
contemporaiieous documentary evideiice.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The défersé, of
course, could not rebut the government’s representations at the-/hearing because the
government had not yet produced discovery.

Since then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of
thousands of pages of discovery, including the entire initial tranche of discovery that the
government represented was. the core of its case against.Ms. Maxwell.” The discovery.
contains no meaningful documentary corroboration. of the allegations whatsoever, much less
“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed. The vast: majority of
