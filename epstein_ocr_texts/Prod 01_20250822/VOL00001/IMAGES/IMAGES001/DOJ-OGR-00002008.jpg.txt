E. The Discovery Contains No Meaningful Documentary Corroboration of

the Government's Allegations Against Ms. Maxwell

At the initial bail hearing, the government represented to the Court that “the evidence
in this case is strong” and that the allegations of the alleged victims were “backed up [by]
contemporaneous documents . . . [including] flight records, diary entries, business records,
and other evidence.” (Dkt. 4 at 5.) The Court credited those representations and accepted
the government’s proffer that the witness testimony would be “corroborated by significant
contemporaneous documentary evidence.” (Tr. 82) (emphasis added). The defense, of
course, could not rebut the government’s representations at the hearing because the
government had not yet produced discovery.

Since then, the government has produced, and the defense has reviewed, hundreds of
thousands of pages of discovery, including the entire initial tranche of discovery that the
government represented was the core of its case against Ms. Maxwell.” The discovery
contains no meaningful documentary corroboration of the allegations whatsoever, much less
“significant” corroboration that the Court was led to believe existed. The vast majority of
the discovery that the defense has reviewed relates to the time period in the 2000s and the
2010s, well after the conspiracy charged in the indictment (1994-1997). These documents

include Ghislaine Maxwell to see if British socialite was involved in his offending,” (Oct. 25, 2020),

” The defense has not yet completed its review of the over 1.2 million documents produced on November 9, 2020
and November 18, 2020. This production includes documents and images seized from electronic devices found at
Epstein’s residences in searches of his residences in 2019. Our initial review, however, shows that the documents
are from the 2000s and 2010s, well after the charged conspiracy.
