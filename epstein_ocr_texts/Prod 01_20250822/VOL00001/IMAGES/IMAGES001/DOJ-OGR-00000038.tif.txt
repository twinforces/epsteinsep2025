Circuits have faithfully applied
Santobello’s instruction that promises
in plea agreements must be binding

obligations entered into on behalf of
the “United States” or the
“Government” apply to the federal

expressly reiterates that the term
“United States” does in fact mean the
entire country as a whole................066 11
