Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 76 Filed 11/24/20 Page 2 of 2
LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA
The government highlights what Ms. Maxwell is permitted but not what she is denied:
equal treatment accorded other inmates in general population. Ms. Maxwell has spent the
entirely of her pretrial detention in de facto solitary confinement under the most restrictive
conditions where she is excessively and invasively searched and is monitored 24 hours per day.
In addition to camera surveillance in her cell, a supplemental camera follows her movement
when she is permitted to leave her isolation cell and is focused on Ms. Maxwell and counsel
during in-person legal visits. And despite non-stop in-cell camera surveillance, Ms. Maxwell’s
sleep is disrupted every 15-minutes when she is awakened by a flashlight to ascertain whether
she is breathing.
Ms. Maxwell is a non-violent, exemplary pretrial detainee with no criminal history, no
history of violence, no history of mental health issues or suicidal ideation. She is overmanaged
under conditions more restrictive than inmates housed in 10South, the most restrictive unit in the
MCC; or individuals convicted of terrorism and capital murder and incarcerated at FCI Florence
ADMAX, the most restrictive facility operated by the BOP. The MDC concedes that it is unable
to place her in general population for her safety and the security of the institution but fails to
explain why she is deprived of all other opportunities provided to general population inmates.
Stating that Ms. Maxwell “continues to have more time to review her discovery than any
other inmate at the MDC, even while in quarantine” gives the unfair impression that she is being
given a perquisite. However, given the voluminous discovery in this case, the most recent
production alone being 1.2 million documents, the time accorded Ms. Maxwell remains
inadequate for her to review and prepare the defense of her life.
Due to the failure of MDC’s Warden and Legal Department to respond to recurring
problems and complaints, counsel have reached out to the government. While we appreciate any
assistance provided by government counsel, it has done little to redress the many concerns
regarding the disparate treatment of Ms. Maxwell.
Rather than receive second-hand information from counsel, the defense requests that the
Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to report directly to the Court and counsel on Ms.
Maxwell’s conditions of detention.
Your consideration is greatly appreciated.
Very truly yours,
BOBBI C. STERNHEIM
