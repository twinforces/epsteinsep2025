CONCLUSION
As this Court previously found, the defendant “poses a substantial actual risk of flight.”
(Tr. 86). Nothing in the defense submission justifies altering the Court’s prior conclusion that
there are no conditions of bail that would assure the defendant’s presence in court proceedings in
this case. Accordingly, the Renewed Bail Motion should be denied.
