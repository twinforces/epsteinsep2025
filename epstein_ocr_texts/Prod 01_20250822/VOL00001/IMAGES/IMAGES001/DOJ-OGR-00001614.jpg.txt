Finally, the Government recognizes that the COVID-19 pandemic is — and should be — a
relevant factor for the Court and the parties in this case. However, the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”’)
is taking very significant steps to address that concern, and the defendant has offered no reason
why she should be treated any differently from the many defendants who are currently detained at
the Metropolitan Detention Center (“MDC”) pending trial, including defendants who have medical
conditions that place them at heightened risk. Inmates at the MDC are able to assist in their own

she has demonstrated her ability to evade detection, and the victims of the defendant’s crimes seek
her detention. Because there is no set of conditions short of incarceration that can reasonably
assure the defendant’s appearance, the Government urges the Court to detain her.

of the offense, the strength of the evidence, and the history and characteristics of the defendant —
weigh strongly in favor of detention, and the defendant’s proposed package would do absolutely
nothing to mitigate those risks.

including proceedings involving release. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(4). Consistent with that
requirement, the Government has been in contact with victims and their counsel in connection with
its application for detention. Counsel for one victim has already conveyed to the Government that
