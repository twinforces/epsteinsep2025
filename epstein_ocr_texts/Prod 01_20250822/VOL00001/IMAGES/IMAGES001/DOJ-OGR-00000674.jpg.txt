1 life, as a victim. I don't like that word, but I still feel

2 like I am learning the ways that he's impacted me as a complex
3 Situation, but he was also a major part of my life. As

4 destructive as that relationship was and as much of a villain

5) as we have created him to be —— based on facts we've created

6 him to be a villain -- he's a complex villain and actually all
7 of that is irrelevant. Anybody deserves -- an investigation is
8 the right thing to do. Like, we do need to know how he died.

9 It felt like a whole new trauma all over again, and I
10 don't know why, you know, because I -—- I'm trying to defend

11 myself against him at this point in my life, but it still does
12 not feel good. It didn't feel good to wake up that morning and
13 find out that he had allegedly committed suicide. Okay. But I
14 also wanted to say to the press, I'm reading -- I read my story
15 in the paper. I read so many other girls' stories that are so
16 similar to my own, and everything that's been focused on is not
17 the most important part of it.

18 There was -- the problem with focusing on these, the
19 facts of the situation, that were out of the ordinary and like
20 because he was such a grand person, and it was just a unique
21 situation. I know that that's the more interesting side of the
22 story, but I don't want to be used as entertainment. And the
23 problem, the fundamental problem of the whole situation is the
24 element of exploitation and coercion, and these are things that
25 so many girls can relate to.
