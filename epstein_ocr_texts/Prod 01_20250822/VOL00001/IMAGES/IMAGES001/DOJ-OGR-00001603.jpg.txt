Moreover, the. government: overstates the potential. for Ms. Maxwell to spend
“decades in prison” if she is convicted. (Gov. Mem. at 5.) In fact, her likely total exposure.
even if She were: convicted on. all couiits is 10 years, assuming the Court were to follow the
traditional. practice in this District.and impose concurrent sentences. Although a 10-year
sentence would be significant, it is a far cry from ‘the government’s. forecast, further
demonstrating that the government has not met its burden of showing Ms. Maxwell. is.an
actual risk of flight.

Lhe Goveriment’s Case ls Subject. to Significant Challenges. ‘In.evaluating the
strength of the government’s case, we note that: Ms. Maxwell :intends to mount several ‘legal.
challenges to the: indictment, including that: (4) this prosecution is barred by Epstein’s
September 24, 2007 sion-prosecution. agreement: with the Department: of Justice, which
‘covers “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”; (ii) the conspiracy, enticement of minors,
and transporting of minors charges are time-barred and otherwise legally flawed: and (111):
the. two perjury charges are subject.to dismissal.on several.legal grounds. Tn addition, as
we understand from the face of the indictment, the government’s case is based primarily’ on.
the testimony of three individuals about events that allegedly occurred roughly 25 years ago
between, 1994 and 1997. It is inherently more difficult to prosecute cases relating to:
decades-old conduct. These ‘issues further'call, into question the strength ofthe government’s

casé, and provide an. independent basis justifying:release on bail.
