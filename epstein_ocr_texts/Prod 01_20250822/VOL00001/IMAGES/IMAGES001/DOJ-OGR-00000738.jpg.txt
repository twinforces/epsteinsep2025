Inre Craig, 131 F.3d at 102; see also id. at 104 (“The discretion of a trial court in deciding whether
to make public the ordinarily secret proceedings of a grand jury investigation is one of the broadest |
and most sensitive exercises of careful judgment that a trial judge can make.”). The Second Circuit
has identified the following factors for district courts to weigh where considering applications for
disclosure:
® the identity of the party seeking disclosure;
° whether the defendant to the grand jury proceeding or the Government opposes the
disclosure;
° why disclosure is being sought in the particular case;
° what specific information is being sought for disclosure;
° how long ago the grand jury proceedings took place;
° the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and that of their
families;
° the extent to which the desired material has been previously made public;
° whether witnesses to the grand jury proceedings who might be affected by
disclosure are still alive; and
® [whether there is an] additional need for maintaining secrecy in the particular case
in question.

Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d 1226, 1241 (11th Cir. 2020) (en banc); United States v. McDougal,
559 F.3d 837, 841 (8th Cir. 2009); Jn re Grand Jury 89-4-72, 932 F.2d 481, 488 (6th Cir. 1991).
