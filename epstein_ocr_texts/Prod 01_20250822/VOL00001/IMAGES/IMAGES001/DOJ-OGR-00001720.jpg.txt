protective order was docketed on Friday, July 31, 2020'—the timing of which was principally the
result of the defendant’s own refusal to agree to the terms of the proposed protective order. The
Government then promptly produced an initial discovery production totaling more than 12,000
pages the following Wednesday, August 5, 2020. Additionally, the Government continues to
produce discovery and earlier today made a second production, as the Government advised defense
counsel last week it intended to do, totaling more than 150,000 pages, principally consisting of
financial records.” Although the Government expects to continue to produce a large amount of
electronic discovery, the two productions already made constitute the vast majority of initial
discovery, including search warrant applications and subpoena returns, which the Government has
now produced more than a week in advance of its deadline of August 21, 2020, and
approximately 11 months prior to trial.

In sum, the Government has acted expeditiously in meeting its initial discovery obligations,
providing more than 165,000 pages of discovery materials in less than two weeks following the
entry of the protective order—all of which was accompanied by detailed indices describing the
general topics and sources of the materials.

Against this backdrop, the Defense Letter claims that over the course of just five days,
defense counsel determined, having “expeditiously reviewed [the discovery] for high level
content,” Def. Ltr. at 2, that they cannot possibly investigate the charges against their client based
on the materials provided thus far, and asking the Court to order the Government to provide the
defendant with a partial witness list. That request should be denied.

Tellingly, the defendant cites no authority that requires the relief requested at this stage in
the litigation—i.e., prior to the completion of discovery and approximately 11 months before
trial—nor is the Government aware of any. For example, in the lead case cited by defense counsel,
United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 301 (2d Cir. 1975), although the opinion acknowledged
the ability of district courts to compel disclosure of the identity of government witnesses, the
Second Circuit reversed for abuse of discretion the district court’s decision to do so in that case
because the defendant there, as here, had made “only an abstract, conclusory claim that such
disclosure was necessary to its proper preparation for trial.” /d. at 301-02. In United States v.
Rueb, 00 Cr. 091 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2001), while the Court ordered
the Government to provide the defendant with its witness list, it did so one month before trial,
following the completion of discovery production and in the context of pretrial motions. Those
circumstances plainly are not present here. Finally, in United States v. Warme, a Western District
of New York opinion from 2009 that has never been cited by another court, although the Court
' The Defense Letter states that the protective order was “entered” by the Court on July 30, 2020.
While that is the date the protective order was signed by the Court, it was posted to the docket on
July 31, 2020.
> The Government’s most recent discovery transmittal letter also included the months and years of
birth of the three victims identified in the Indictment, to enable the defendant to evaluate whether
she will make any motions or legal arguments—more than four months in advance of the deadline
for any such motion—relating to the ages of the victims.
