A. Materiality’

Scetion 1:623(a) of Title 18 of the U.S; Code states, in relewant part, that-“[w]hoev.er
under oath ... in.any proceeding before or ancillary to any court'or grand jury ofthe. United
(emphasis added). Thus, to violate § 1623(a), a perjurious statement:must be. “material to the
proceeding in which itis given.” United States v. Zagari, 1.1.-F.3d 307, 329 (2d Cir. 1997)
(emphasis omitted).

To be “material,” a statement must have “a natural tendency to influence, of [be] capable
of influencing, the decision of the decision.making body to which it is addressed.” United States
vi, Gaudin, 515 U.S. 506, 509 (1995) (quotation:marks omitted). When, made during’ a civil,
deposition, Statements are material only if “a truthful answer might.rcasonably be calculated to,
lead to the discovery’ of evidence admissible at the trial of the underlying suit.” Wnited States v.
Kross; 14 F.3d.75.1,'754 (2d Cir: 1994). Tn proving materiality, it “is necessary . ... that the
government. show that the statement, if ‘believed, could. have influenced the decision’ of the
decision-making body.. United States v. Stern, No. 03 Cr.,81,: 2003 WL 22743897, at. *2
(S.D.N.Y. Nov: 20, 2003).

Although issues of materiality are generally mixed questions.of law and fact normally left
to ajury, see Gaudin, 515 U:S. at 522-23, under certain:cireumstances, like those’presented in,
this casc, a court-can, decide ‘this issuc under Fed. .R. Crim. P. 12(b). See: United States. ¥. Forde,
740 F. Supp. 24.406, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). Here, the deposition transcripts: and Judge ‘Preska’s
ruling provide the Court with the relevant. undisputed facts to decide this motion. Thus a.trial will
not assist in.determining whether the Government can prove:to a-reasonable juror'that.Ms.

Maxwells conduct violated. 18 U.S.C. § 1623(a). United States 'v: Nitsehke, 843 F. Supp. 2d.4,9
