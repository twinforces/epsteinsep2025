Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell submitted to the Court an application
for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure. The proposed subpoena was directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of
the Defendant. As is standard for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and
under seal on the ground that it reveals defense strategy. See e.g., United States v. Skelos, No.
15-CR-317 (KMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d
Cir. 2021); United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237, 243 (S.D.N.Y. 2017); United States v.
Earls, No. 03-CR-0364 (NRB), 2004 WL 350725, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2004); United States
v. Reyes, 162 F.R.D. 468, 470 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).

Rule 17(c)(3) provides that “[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the
production of personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party
only by court order,” but “before entering the order and unless there are exceptional
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to
quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3). Consistent with
the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel to
provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be disclosed
