OPINION & ORDER
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

In June 2020, a grand jury returned a six-count
indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating
the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of
minor victims from around 1994 to 1997. The Govern-
ment filed a first (S1) superseding indictment shortly
thereafter, which contained only small, ministerial
corrections. The $1 superseding indictment included
two counts of enticement or transportation of minors
to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of the Mann
Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those
offenses. It also included two counts of perjury in
connection with Maxwell’s testimony in a civil deposi-
tion. Trial is set to begin on July 12, 2021.

Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to
dismiss portions of the S1 superseding indictment,
suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the
parties fully briefed those motions, a grand jury
returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding
