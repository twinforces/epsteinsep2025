because “the subpoena. was not crafted. to call for admissible evidence. ‘Rather, it,called. for the
production, ofthe entire: investigative file and. is accurately described as a fishing expedition.”).

Similarly, Request 12 asks: for “EVCP Material,” which. is defined as “any submission to
the Epstein. Victim’s Compensation Program made by You, including aay. claims.on behalf of
persons who have’ accused Jeffrey Epstein, or Ghislaine Maxwell of any misconduct, any releases
‘signed by You or Your Clients, and any compensation received by You, or Your Clients: This
Reéquést does not satisfy the Nixon standard—the Defendant is ‘nota. party or otherwise: privy to
what information BSF has, submitted to the confidential Epstein Victim’s. Compensation Program.
‘or.on behalf of which.clicnts:BSF has submitted such information. The: Defendant cannot mercly:
request ‘every’ picce of confidential, information that BSF submitted to the Program, in the hopes
that something'relevant and admissible turns up. ‘This Request:thus cannot pass muster under Rule
17(e).

Second, although. BSF ‘docs not know what arguments the Defendant:made:in her ex. parte
motion, the documents and. items requested in, the Subpoena bear no. apparent. relevance: to: the:
Defendant’s guilt or innocence of the charges in this. matter. And to the extent they would, be
relevant solely ‘for impeachment purposes, or relevant; but inadmissible, the Defendant. cannot.
obtain theni.in advance ofttrial pursuant:to. Rule 17(¢). Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 699-700, 701.

from 2015 5 through the present, and Requests. 3 through 5 seck communications between BSF and,
BSF’s co-counsel from.2015 through the'present regarding:any mectings with the U.S. Attorncy’s
office about the Defendant. But such communications are not relevant to the Govérnment’s
allegations that the Defendant enticed minors to travel, and. transported. minors, to ‘engage. in sex.
acts between. 1994 to 1997, nearly’ 20 years: ‘prior to: any: such communications. ‘Nor do ‘such,
communications bear any apparent. relevance to whether the Defendant.perjured herself ina. civil
deposition. If:such communications are relevant, they are only relevant to the Defendant’s, false
narrative that BSF somehow colluded. with the Government—an allegation that could. serve no
other purpose than impeachment of the Government’s potential witnesses.. Request 8—secking
any grand jury subpocna [—___] for ‘documents. ‘related ‘to litigation. concerning the
Defendant—is similarly, aimed at developing some ill-informed narrative! of collusion, between,
BSF and the Government, as the Defendant has on. numerous occasions accused BSF of improperly
‘providing the: Goverriment: with confidential documents governed, by a protective ordér in a.
Separate civil matter. See, é.g., ECE No. 134 (Defendant's motion, to suppress evidence obtained
by subpoena 'to what-appears ——): Even if these documents were:relevant to anything other

Requests 3 through 5. also scck protected work product. Those Requests seck.
communications between BSF and its co-counscl in'several:matters relating to Jeffrey Epstein and.
Ghislaine Maxwell. Such communications were prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial.
Where a.criminal defendant. sceks to subpoena work product, the defendant can only overcome the
privilege by demonstrating a “substantial need” ‘for the requested .items and that he “cafinot,
without: undue hardship. obtain their substantial cquivalent by other 1 means.” | Mnited’ States V.
the marginal potential evidentiary ‘value of the communications, ‘the Defendant will be unable to
demonstrate a substantial need for protected communications between BSF and. its co=counscl.
