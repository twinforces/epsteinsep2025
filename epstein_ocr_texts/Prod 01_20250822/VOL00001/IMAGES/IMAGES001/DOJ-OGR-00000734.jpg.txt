4. “Tt is a tradition of law that proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain
secret.” In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489 (2d Cir. 1973). “[T]he tradition of secrecy,” however, “is not
absolute.” Jn re Petition of Nat. Sec. Archive, 104 F. Supp. 3d 625, 628 (S.D.N-Y. 2015). Although
Rule 6(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure generally lists the exceptions to grand
jury secrecy, the Second Circuit has recognized that “there are certain ‘special circumstances’ in
which release of grand jury records is appropriate even outside the boundaries of the rule.” Jn re
Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 102 (2d Cir. 1997); see also Carlson v. United States, 837 F.3d 753, 767 (7th
Cir. 2016) (“Rule 6(e)(3)(E) does not displace that inherent power. It merely identifies a permissive
list of situations where that power can be used.”). One such “special circumstance” is historical
interest by the public. Jn re Craig, 131 F.3d at 105. Under Jn re Craig, this Court retains discretion
to determine “whether such an interest outweighs the countervailing interests in privacy and
secrecy|.]” Id.

5. Public officials, lawmakers, pundits, and ordinary citizens remain deeply interested
and concerned about the Epstein matter. Indeed, other jurists have released grand jury transcripts
after concluding that Epstein’s case qualifies as a matter of public concern. See Order Granting
Plaintiff’s Motion for Reconsideration of the Trial Court’s February 29, 2024 Order, CA Florida
Holdings, LLC v. Dave Aronberg and Joseph Abruzzo, 50-2019 CA-014681 (15th Cir. July 1,
2024). After all, Jeffrey Epstein is “the most infamous pedophile in American history.” Jd. The
facts surrounding Epstein’s case “tell a tale of national disgrace.” Jn re Wild, 994 F.3d 1244, 1247
(11th Cir. 2021) (discussing the plea agreement secured by Epstein in Florida). The grand jury
records are thus “critical pieces of an important moment in our nation’s history.” Jn re Petition of
Nat. Sec. Archive, 104 F. Supp. 3d at 629. “The time for the public to guess what they contain
