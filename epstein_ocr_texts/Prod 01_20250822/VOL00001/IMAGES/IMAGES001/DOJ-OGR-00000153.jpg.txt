90a
indictment and so does resolve any such issues here.
However, Maxwell’s motion seeking to dismiss the $1
superseding indictment because it was returned by a
grand jury sitting at the White Plains courthouse
appears moot. Maxwell argued that the use of a grand
jury drawn from the White Plains Division in this
District did not represent a fair cross-section of the
community, because her trial would proceed in the
Manhattan Division. A grand jury sitting in Manhattan
returned the S2 superseding indictment. By April 21,
2021, Maxwell shall show cause why her grand jury
motion should not be dismissed on that basis.
Conclusion

The Court DENIES Maxwell’s motions to dismiss
the indictment as barred by Epstein’s non-prosecution
agreement (Dkt. No. 141), to dismiss the Mann Act
counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No.
143), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment
delay (Dkt. No. 187), to dismiss the Mann Act counts
for lack of specificity (Dkt. No. 123), to dismiss the
perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. 135), to
strike surplusage (Dkt. No. 145), to dismiss count one
or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No. 121), and to
expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. 147). The Court
GRANTS Maxwell’s motion to sever the perjury counts
for a separate trial (Dkt. No. 119).

The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm
within one week whether it considers any evidence
related to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement
to constitute Brady or Rule 16 material and, if so, to
confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence.

'The parties shall negotiate and propose a schedule for any
available additional or supplement rulings in light of the filing of
the S2 indictment.
