Portability and Accountability Act Health Information Policy (HIPAA). She is weighed while

the camera was not recording at that time. The government disputes Ms. Maxwell’s claim by
citing a video. We request that the Court direct the government to provide defense counsel with
that video. In response to any misconduct of guards, the standard reply is that “the matter will be
