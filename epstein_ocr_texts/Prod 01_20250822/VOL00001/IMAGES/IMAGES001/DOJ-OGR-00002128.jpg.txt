person has first appeared before the Public Prosecutor!. If the legal conditions of
extradition are satisfied, the Investigating Chamber must issue a positive opinion to
extradition, which is not subject to appeal. Following the Investigating Chamber’s
ruling, there is no specified time frame within which the government must issue an
extradition decree. However, if the requesting State emphasizes the urgent nature of the
request, the extradition decree is generally issued in only a few weeks. Therefore, the
overall procedure is likely to be disposed of expediently under these circumstances.
' The 14 days period is divided as follows: the requested person must appear before the Public Prosecutor within
2 days of arrest, he or she must be heard by the Investigating Chamber no later than 5 working days after appearing
before the Public Prosecutor, and the Investigating Chamber must then deliver its final opinion on the legality of
the extradition request within 7 days. This procedure will be explained in more details in Part I of this opinion.
