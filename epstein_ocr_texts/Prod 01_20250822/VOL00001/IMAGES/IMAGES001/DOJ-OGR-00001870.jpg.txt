Re: Ghislaine Maxwell

‘Dear. Warden Tellez:

related: to conditions of her detention: at the’ MDC. 7 Our immediate e goal i is'to rectify these
‘problems'and improve the extraordinarily restrictive conditions under which Ms. Maxwell. is
presently confined within your facility.

On July 14, 2020, the, ‘Honorable Alison, J. Nathan centered an‘order of detention,
remanding Ghislaine Maxwell. to the custody of the ‘Bureau of Prisons. She has been detained
since her arrest: on.July 2, 2020 and_has been. incarecrated. at. MDC:under:conditions that rival
those at USP Florence: ADMAX. An éxémplary inmate who poses no’threat.to her'personal
safcty or danger. to anyonc, she:has spent the entirety of her detention ‘in de facto solitary.
confinement, tantamount to imprisonment asa ‘defendant.convicted of capital murder and.
‘incarcerated.on death row: The conditions of her detention are utterly. inappropriate, especially.so
‘for a:non-violent defendant with no‘prior criminal, history facing non-violent charges a quarter-
century’ old.

Without a. doubt, the BOP has imposed extraordinarily onerous conditions of constraint
on Ms. Maxwell to avoid the catastrophic consequences of negligence occurring at the
‘Metropolitan, Correctional ‘Center (MCC- Manhattan) which.resulted. in the death. of Jeffrey
Epstcin. The AttorneyGeneral. of the United States has said'as much. The BOP has admitted.
that the sanctions are ‘not in-response toa specific'threat.that. Ms. Maxwell has shown; rather they
are in response to the high-profile nature of the case and.the acknowledged :failure by the BOP to
keep: Epstein — an actual:threat to himself — alive. Ms. Maxwell.is bearing’the brunt.of
incompetence on. MCC’s watch. As ABC News reported:

' Previous letters. were Sent to"'you on August 28,2020 and September 9,. 2020.
