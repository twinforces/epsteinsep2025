Re: Ghislaine Maxwell

Dear Warden Tellez:

As counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell, we again seek your urgent attention concerning issues
related to conditions of her detention at the MDC.! Our immediate goal is to rectify these
problems and improve the extraordinarily restrictive conditions under which Ms. Maxwell is
presently confined within your facility.

On July 14, 2020, the Honorable Alison J. Nathan entered an order of detention
remanding Ghislaine Maxwell to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. She has been detained
since her arrest on July 2, 2020 and has been incarcerated at MDC under conditions that rival
those at USP Florence ADMAX. An exemplary inmate who poses no threat to her personal
safety or danger to anyone, she has spent the entirety of her detention in de facto solitary
confinement, tantamount to imprisonment as a defendant convicted of capital murder and
incarcerated on death row. The conditions of her detention are utterly inappropriate, especially so
for a non-violent defendant with no prior criminal history facing non-violent charges a quarter-
century old.

Without a doubt, the BOP has imposed extraordinarily onerous conditions of constraint
on Ms. Maxwell to avoid the catastrophic consequences of negligence occurring at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC- Manhattan) which resulted in the death of Jeffrey
Epstein. The Attorney General of the United States has said as much. The BOP has admitted
that the sanctions are not in response to a specific threat that Ms. Maxwell has shown; rather they
are in response to the high-profile nature of the case and the acknowledged failure by the BOP to
keep Epstein — an actual threat to himself — alive. Ms. Maxwell is bearing the brunt of
incompetence on MCC’s watch. As ABC News reported:
