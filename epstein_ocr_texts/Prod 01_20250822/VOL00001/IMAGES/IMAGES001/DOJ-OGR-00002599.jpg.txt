Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 142 Filed 02/04/21 Page 27 of 38

Here, we understand that senior levels of Main Justice were directly involved in the
negotiation and approval of the NPA, and the NPA itself reflects the involvement of the FBI.
NPA at 1. Moreover, the USAO-SDFL’s involvement of the USAO for this District in its
investigation of Epstein, as well its contact with witnesses in New York, reflect a coordinated
effort that transcended the USAO-SDFL. SDFL Privilege Log at 4, 5, 7. From these facts, it

Eastern District of Virginia”); Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x at 270 (“Paragraph 13 explicitly states that
the agreement binds only the United States Attorney's Office for the District of New Mexico”);
United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 119 (2d Cir. 1998) (“[t]his agreement is limited to the
United States Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and cannot bind other
federal, state or local prosecuting authorities”); United States v. Persico, 620 F. Supp. 836, 846
