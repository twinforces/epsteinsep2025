‘confidential, information. See Dkt.'No. 162. On, March,9, 2021, the Defendant objected to
certain of the redactions that the Government. had ‘proposed, and she proposed. additional
redactions. Having considered the partics’ respective positions, the Court will.grant the
Government’s:requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendants additional
‘redaction requests, ‘with the exceptions discussed below.

To begin with, the Court’s reasoning is ‘guided bythe three-part:test. articulated. bythe
Second Cireuit in.Lugoseh'v. Pyramid Go. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d,11.0 (2d Cir. 2006). ‘Under
this test, the. Court must? (i) determine whether'the documents, in question are “judicial
documents;” (ii) assess the'weight of the common, law presumption of access to:the materials;
and. (111) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Jd. at 119=20.
“Such countervailing factors include but are not.limited to ‘the danger of impairing law
enforeement or judicial efficiency” and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.”” /d. at
