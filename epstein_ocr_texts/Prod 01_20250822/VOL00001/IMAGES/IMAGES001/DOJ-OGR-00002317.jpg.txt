Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 124 Filed 01/25/21 Page 7 of 8
non-criminal acts of so-called “grooming” (talking to or being nice to someone, or taking them to
a movie), it is impossible to know what act or acts she needs to defend against at trial.

CONCLUSION
Neither the Indictment nor the discovery provide Ms. Maxwell with enough information
so that she can prepare her defense as to Counts One through Four, and these Counts should be
dismissed for a lack of specificity in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United
States Constitution. Alternatively, the Court should direct the government to provide Ms.
Maxwell with a Bill of Particulars and discovery as requested in her contemporaneously filed
Memorandum in Support of Motion for Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures.
