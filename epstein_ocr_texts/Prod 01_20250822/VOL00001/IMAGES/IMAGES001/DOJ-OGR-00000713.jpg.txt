Cannot. €at, at the 'thotight of Jéffrey Epstein not Serving the
time he needed to realize the pain and suffering he caused so
tiany vulnerable young girls. Hé thought he was untouchable,
and. henestly, so did I. I theught he was. the most powerful
person, I would ever meet.

But the end is here and here I stand becoming more
powerful than he will ever be. Thank ‘you.

THE COURT: Thank. you.,

JANE DOE: dJarie Doe.

Um, in 2004, when. I was 15 years. old, I flew on
Jeffréy Epstein's plane t6 Zorro Ranch, where I was sexual

molested by him fon many hours. What I remember most. vividly

was him explaining to me How beneficial the experience was for
me and how much, he was helping me ‘to grow. Yikes.

I remember feeling so small and powerless, especially

after he ‘positioned, me by lLayang ime on, his floor so that, I was
confronted by all the framed photographs 6n his dresser of him

smitding with wealthy celebrities and politicians.

After hé finishéd with mé, hé told mé to deséribe in

detail how good my ‘first sexual experience felt. That was the
first of many lies I was forced t6 carry for Kim, the weight of
which proliferated my ‘trauma. I felt. powerless not merely
because one mMdn wanted to strip mé of my inhocencée, but because
I was the victim of a system that, just enfranchises human
beings, making them vulnerable to pedophilic exploitation.
