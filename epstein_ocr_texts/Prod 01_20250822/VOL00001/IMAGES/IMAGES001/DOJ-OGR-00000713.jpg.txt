1 cannot eat at the thought of Jeffrey Epstein not serving the

2 time he needed to realize the pain and suffering he caused so

3 many vulnerable young girls. He thought he was untouchable,

4 and honestly, so did I. I thought he was the most powerful

5 person I would ever meet.

6 But the end is here and here I stand becoming more

7 powerful than he will ever be. Thank you.

8 THE COURT: Thank you.

9 JANE DOE: Jane Doe.

10 Um, in 2004, when I was 15 years old, I flew on

11 Jeffrey Epstein's plane to Zorro Ranch, where I was sexual

12 molested by him for many hours. What I remember most vividly
13 was him explaining to me how beneficial the experience was for
14 me and how much he was helping me to grow. Yikes.

15 I remember feeling so small and powerless, especially
16 after he positioned me by laying me on his floor so that I was
17 confronted by all the framed photographs on his dresser of him
18 smiling with wealthy celebrities and politicians.

19 After he finished with me, he told me to describe in
20 detail how good my first sexual experience felt. That was the
21 first of many lies I was forced to carry for him, the weight of
22 which proliferated my trauma. I felt powerless not merely
23 because one man wanted to strip me of my innocence, but because
24 I was the victim of a system that just enfranchises human
25 beings, making them vulnerable to pedophilic exploitation.
