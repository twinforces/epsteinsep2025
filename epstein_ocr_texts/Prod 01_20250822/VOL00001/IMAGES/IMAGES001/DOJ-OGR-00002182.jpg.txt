Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 100: Filed 12/18/20 Page 21.0f 36.

Justice on, August.22, 2007 which provides that:the “Ministry of Justice considers the American:
borni, U.S. citizen Peterson to also be a French national. arid ‘that: the. extradition request. has been
denied”). Indeed, the Government is:‘unaware of any instance:in which-France has ever. extradited,
‘a, French citizen to the United States. (See Ex. Bat-4 (“[T]he principle of non-extradition of
nationals is a prificiple of extradition law from.'which, Franée has never deviated, outside the
framework of the European, Union.”)). Simply put, the Court was correct. when. it determined at:
‘the ‘initial bail hearing that: France docs not. appear to extradite its own citizens. (Tr. 83).

The defendant’s supposed waiver of her extradition. rights ‘with :respect to the. United
Kingdom;should similarly be afforded no:weight. Although an anticipatory’ waiver of extradition
may be:admissible:in.extradition-procéedings in the United. Kingdom, Such.a waiver is by:nio means
binding, authoritative,.or.enforceable. See: United States'v: Stanton, .No.'91.Cr. 889 (CHS), 1992
WE 27130, at-*2 & n.l.(S:D.N.Y. Feb. 4, 1992) (denying ‘modification of defendant’s bail;where
defendant indicated willingness'to Waive extradition procecding by‘providing ‘extradition Waivers,
as British, authorities’ advised that extradition, waivers: were: possible only in cases where the:
fugitive actually:appeared before a British magistrate after the filing of an extradition request, and.
concluding that such a waiver was not an “cnforceable undertaking”). ‘Under the United
Kingdom’s Extradition.Act of 2003,.consent to extradition. is permitted, “if (and-only if) [a person]
has ‘the assistance of counsel or a. Solicitor ‘to, represént him in. the proceedings before the
appropriate judge.” Extradition Act 2003, § 127(9), https://www:legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/-
2003/41.. As such, a judge in the United Kingdom must independently evaluate: any waiver of
extradition in real time, thereby necessarily rendering afiy‘anticipatory waiver cxccuted before the

defendant.is found:in the United Kingdom meaningless. Jd. at §127. In other words, consent given.
