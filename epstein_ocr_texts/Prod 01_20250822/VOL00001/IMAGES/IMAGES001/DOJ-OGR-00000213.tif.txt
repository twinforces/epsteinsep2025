terms that will not bind other federal prosecutors or
agencies without their consent” and “the attorney for the
government should explicitly limit the scope of his/her
agreement to non-prosecution within his/her district.”
Justice Manual § 9-27.630.? Given this instruction, when
Department attorneys choose to draft a broad agreement,
the court should enforce it as written. The NPA’s broad
language served the government’s strategy at the time
of the agreement. The Court should not permit the
government to escape that language, even if that strategy
may seem unwise or unintelligible with the benefit of
hindsight.
CONCLUSION

The Court should grant review in this case to resolve
the conflict among the circuits identified by petitioner and
hold the Department of Justice to its word.
