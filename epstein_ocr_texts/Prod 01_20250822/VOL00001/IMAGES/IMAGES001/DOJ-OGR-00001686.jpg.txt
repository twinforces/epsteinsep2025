of course, has not had access to the discovery materials) to anticipate and réspond.to government.
hypotheticals regarding what the discovery might contain, and how language: might address such.
hypotheticals. But that:is not the standard.

The defense submits that) when the relevant’ privacy interests are appropriately
considered, it should not be restricted ‘from publiclyréferencing individuals who have, chosen to
publicly identify themselves. Accordingly, the defense has proposed. that the protective order
include the following language: “Nor does this Order prohibit: Defense Counsel from. publicly
referencing individuals who have spoken. on the public: record tothe media or in public fora, or in
litigation :— criminal or otherwise — relating to Jeffrey’ Epsteim or Ghislaine Maxwell.” (Dkt. 29,
Ex. A 6).

In.the present context, many of the alleged victims have chosen. to identify themselves by
name in numerous public fora, including: selfzidentifying and speaking on ‘the record in criminal.
proceedings in the Jeffrey’ Epstein, case.and ‘this case; as named plaintiffs in, civil. suits ‘against.
Ms. Maxwell and others, in on- -the- record interviews with media and, tabloid publications and.

articles, i in, which. alleped victims not only. ideniify themselves, but make specific allegations
against. Ms. Maxwell. As a matter of common sense, and under the. law, such persons do not.
have any: privacy: interest that neéds' to be. addressed by the proposed order. See Cox Broad.
@ OF. V. Cohn, 420 US. 469, 494-95) (1975): (noting, in a.case where the: identity ofa minor. rape
victim ‘was. disclosed in publicly filed. indictments, that “the interests in’ privacy fade ‘when, the
information involved already appears on the public record.”),

Yet, the government asserts that such persons nevertheless have: ° ‘significant privacy
interests” (Gov"t Resp. at‘1), and proposes. the much more limited formulation: “This Order does
not. prohibit. ‘Defense Counsel from publicly referencing, individuals. who have spoken by name
on the ‘public record. in, this case” —.i¢., in, United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20. Er. 330
(AIN). (Dkt. 33, Ex. A. 5 (emphasis added)). As a practical. matter, the government’s proposed
language would permit the defense 'to publicly reference a total of Ge pérson — the individual
who spoke under her. own name at. Ms. Maxwell’s bail hearing. (See Tr. at 40). It would not.
include the 1.1. alleged victims who spoke or submitted letters under their own names at the
August 27,2019 hearing in, United States v. Jeffrey Tpsiein, 19-CR-00490-RMB,, even.'though.
five of those individuals, made allegations against Ms. Maxwell. (See ‘Dkt. 53 at: 43-44, 55, 56,
57, 58). It Would not include the four individuals ‘who have civilly: sued. Ms. Maxwell’ under'their
own. names alleging conduct similar to ‘that alleged in. the indictment. Nor would it include
numerous other individuals, described above, ‘who -have spoken. out publicly to. the Press Or on.
social media and made accusations against Ms. Maxwell. ‘Indeed, the governments proposed.
language is even more restrictive than what. they*previously agreed to inthe; Epstein case, ‘which,
allowed Epstein’s counsel to: publicly reference. individuals who had identified themselves in,
