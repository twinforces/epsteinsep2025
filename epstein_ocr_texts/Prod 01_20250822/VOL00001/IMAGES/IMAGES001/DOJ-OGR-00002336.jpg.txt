meaning of the Protective Order in this case, and relate to third-party privacy
interests or materials that remain sealed in the civil proceeding.

e The proposed redactions to the defendant’s motion for a bill of particulars and
pretrial disclosures (Motion 10) protect the privacy interests of victim-witnesses
and protect the integrity of the Government’s ongoing investigation.

e The proposed redactions to the defendant’s motion to suppress under the Fourth
and Fifth Amendments (Motion 11) are narrowly tailored to protect the integrity of
the Government’s ongoing investigation.

In addition, the Government has no objection to the defendant’s proposed redactions to her
motion to suppress under the Due Process Clause (Motion 3) as the proposed redactions are
narrowly tailored to protect the Government’s ongoing investigation. The Government
respectfully submits that a limited number of additional redactions would be appropriate with
respect to Motion 3 in order to be consistent with the other redactions proposed by the defendant
in that particular motion. The Government will submit those additional proposed redactions under
seal by email.

Respectfully submitted,
AUDREY STRAUSS
United States Attorney
