Epstein victims would “continu[e] to be victimized” and that Mr. Epstein’s wealth and privilege
and notoriety would make it difficult for “[other] victims to come forward.” Id, at 72.

Ms. Courtney Wild was introduced by her counsel, Brad Edwards, and said she was ;
“sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein starting at the age of 14.” Id. at 73-74. She asked the Court |
to “keep [Mr. Epstein] in detention [] for the safety of any other girls out there that are going
through what [she’s] going through.” Id. at 74. Ms. Wild said that Mr. Epstein is a “scary person

At the remand/release hearing on Monday, July 15, 2019, as noted, the Court heard
poignant testimony from two of Mr. Epstein’s alleged victims about their fears and anxiety over
his potential release, even if under strict conditions of home confinement. The Court is also |
concerned for new victims.

Mr. Epstein’s alleged excessive attraction to sexual conduct with or in the presence of
minor girls — which is said to include his soliciting and receiving massages from young girls and
young women perhaps as many as four times a day — appears likely to be uncontrollable. See

of bail conditions”). Accordingly, Mr. Epstein’s past sexual conduct is not likely to have abated
or been successfully suppressed by fierce determination, as his Defense Counsel suggests.

Defense Counsel contends that: “[H]e wasn’t a predator that couldn’t contro! his conduct. He
disciplined himself.” 7/15/19 Tr. at 31-32. Defense Counsel also argues that “appreciating the
gravity of these charges . . . putting aside the age of these witnesses and putting the consent issue
