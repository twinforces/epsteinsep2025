1 THE COURT: Good afternoon, everyone. This is
2 Judge Nathan presiding.
3 This is United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr.
4 330.
5 I will take appearances from counsel, beginning with
6 counsel for the defendant.
7 MS. MOE: Good afternoon, your Honor. Mark Cohen,
8 Cohen & Gresser, for Ms. Maxwell. Also appearing with me today
9 is my partner Chris Everdell of Cohen & Gresser and Jeff
10 Pagliuca and Laura Menninger of the Haddon Morgan firm. Good
11 afternoon, your Honor.
12 THE COURT: Good afternoon, Mr. Cohen.
13 And for the government.
14 MS. MOE: Good afternoon, your Honor. Alison Moe for
15 the government. I'm joined by my colleagues Maurene Comey and
16 Alex Rossmiller. And also, with the court's permission, we
17 learned that the executive staff for the U.S. Attorney's office
18 were unfortunately not able to Connecticut at the overflow
19 dial-in so, with the court's permission, we would like to dial
20 them in from a phone here if that's acceptable to the court.
21 THE COURT: The last word, the overflow dial-in was
22 not full. Just a moment and we will make sure that they can
23 connect in.
24 And let me say good afternoon, Ms. Maxwell, as well.
25 THE DEFENDANT: Good afternoon, Judge.
