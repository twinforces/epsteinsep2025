1 MS. WILD: My name is Courtney Wild, and I'm a victim
2 of Jeffrey Epstein. Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me for

3 years, robbing me of my innocence and mental health. Jeffrey

4 Epstein has done nothing but manipulate our justice system,

5 where he has never been held accountable for his actions, even
6 to this day.

7 Jeffrey Epstein robbed myself and all the other

8 victims of our day in court to confront him one by one, and for
9 that he is a coward.

10 I want to thank the U.S. Attorney's for seeking

11 justice that has been long over due, and most importantly,

12 given us, the victims, our day in court to speak our peace and
13 find some sort of closure. I feel very angry and sad that

14 justice has never been served in this case. Thank you.

15 THE COURT: Thanks very much.

16 MR. EDWARDS: I believe my next client who is going to
17 speak is probably going to speak as Jane Doe.

18 JANE DOE NO. 1: Yes, Jane Doe.

19 THE COURT: We'll say Jane Doe No. 1, just for the
20 record.
21 JANE DOE NO. 1: Okay. Thank you for allowing us to
22 speak today. I've shifted what I want to say in hearing
23 what's already been said, and just about the question of
24 Jeffrey's death. I don't know what the relevance is to this
25 hearing, but I do know that it is profoundly relevant to my
