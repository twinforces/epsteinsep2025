Re: Unopposed Request for One-Week Continuance of Arraignment
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:
Counsel for Ms. Maxwell writes to request that the arraignment of the S2 Indictment
(Dkt. 193), tentatively scheduled for April 16, 2021, be calendared for April 23, 2021. The
government does not oppose this request.
At present, counsel for Ms. Maxwell has a conflict on April 16, 2021 in Colorado due
to a currently-scheduled hearing that day. Additionally, other members of Ms. Maxwell’s
defense team have previously scheduled a review of the physical evidence the weeks of April
12 and 19" in the courthouse and would prefer to complete that review prior to the
arraignment.
Counsel appreciates that an in-person arraignment requires some logistical
arrangements which may be accommodated by the requested date. Further, the extra time will
permit Ms. Maxwell’s family members to adjust their schedules and make travel arrangements
to attend the court proceedings.
Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests that the Court hold the arraignment on the S2
Indictment on April 23, 2021, or such other date convenient to the Court during the week of
