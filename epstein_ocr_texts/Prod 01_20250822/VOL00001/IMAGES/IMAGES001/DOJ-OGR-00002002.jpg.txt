Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document97 Filed 12/14/20: Page 30 of 45

According ‘to [, the security guard on duty. that day had seen, helicopters’ flying
over the house, which he asstimed to be the press. (/d.). When the guard saw the FBI
agents ‘walking up the driveway to the house, he again. assumed that they-were members of:
the press. (/d.). Accordingly, he radioed Ms. Maxwell to alert:her that the press was.on, the
grounds and approaching the house. (/d.). In accordance with the procedure that Ms.
Maxwell’s security personnel had-put in place for such. an.event, Ms. Maxwell. moved away:
from. the windows and into a safe room, inside the: house. (/d.). Ms. Maxwell was not trying
to.avoid arfest; she ‘was simply following the established security protocols to: protect herself
from. what had been informed was an.ambush, by the press.

Regarding the cellphone wrapped in. tin foil, we explained to the Court at:the initial
bail hearing that Ms. Maxwell took this step: to prevent the press from accessing: her phone
after the Second Circuit inadvertently unsealed certain court records with the phone number
unredacted. (Tr. 55-56). Having now reviewed the discovery produced by the government,
it is clear that-Ms. Maxwell was not at all the “master spy” the government:makes her out to
be and ‘was not wrapping the phone in order to evade detection by’ law’ enforcement.

First, the cellphone in, question:was subscribed in. the iiame of “Terramar Project,
Inc.,” which is easily identifiable through a simple Google search. as Ms. Maxwell’s charity.
Second, Ms. Maxwell used the phone to make. calls as late as May 2020, just before her
arrest. She would never have used the phone if she had been.concerned that. the authorities.
were using it to track her. Third, ‘M's. Maxwell had another phone subscribed in, the name of
“G.Max” that she. was. Using as her primary phone, which ‘was. not covered. It would ‘make

no sense for-her to try. to wrap one. phone in tin foil to avoid detection and :not the other.
