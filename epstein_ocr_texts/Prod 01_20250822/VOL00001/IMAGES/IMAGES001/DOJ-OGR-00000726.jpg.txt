DATE FILED: q f uf Ae!B0, 2019
Hon. Richard M. Berman E (G al W E
US. District Court
for the Southern District of New York SEP 0-4 2019
Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse
500 Pearl Street CHAMBERS OF
New York, NY 10007-1312 Rend NAN
re: United States v. Epstein, 1:19-cr-00490-RMB
Dear Judge Berman:
Yesterday, I was provided a partial transcript of the August 27, 2019 hearing in the above-
captioned case, and I am writing to clarify the record.
As you know, I co-authored a New York Law Journal article before the hearing. The transcript
quotes the court, in pertinent part, as follows with reference to me and the article: “On a somewhat more
serious note, don’t quote me on this, but it is my understanding that one of the authors of that article is :
himself counsel in one of the Epstein-related cases. I was surprised to learn that very recently. I’m
certain it is true. I was also surprised that that aspect was not disclosed in the Law Journal.” Later in the :
hearing, attorney David Boies made comments consistent with those of the court.
Just to clear up the evident misunderstanding: I have never been counsel to Epstein or his estate
or to anyone in an Epstein-related case. I did serve as an expert witness, by way of expert declaration, in
support of Professor Dershowitz’s motion to disqualify Mr. Boies and his law firm in Giuffre v. :
Dershowitz, 1:19-cv-03377 (SDNY), a pending defamation case that might be described as “Epstein- /
related.” My work as an expert witness, which concluded in June, did not involve my representation of, :
or advocacy on behalf of, Professor Dershowitz. I did not serve as counsel or as an advocate on
anyone’s behalf in co-authoring the law journal article.
Very truly yours,
Bruce A. Green
