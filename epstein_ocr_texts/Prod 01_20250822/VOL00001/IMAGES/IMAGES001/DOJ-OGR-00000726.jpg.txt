re: United States-v. Epstein, 1:19-cr-00490-RMB:

Dear Judge Berman:

Yesterday, I, was provided.a partial transcript of the August 27, 2019 hearing in the above-
captioned case, and I am writing’ to clarify the record.

As you know, I-co-authored a New York Law Journal article before‘the hearing. ‘The transcript
quotes the court, in pertinent part, as ‘follows with reference to me and the article: “On a.somewhat more
scrious note, don’t quoté me on this, but:it:is my understanding that one of the authors of that article:is
himself counsel! in one of the:Epstein-related:cases. ‘was surprised to learn that very recently. P’'m
certain.it is true. I was also surprised, that; that:aspect:was.not disclosed. in the Law Joural.” Later in the
hearing, attorney David Boies made comments consistent with, those of the court.

Just’ to clear up:the evident misunderstanding: I have never been. counsel to Epstein. or his estate
orto’ anyone in,an Epstein-related case. I did serye.as an expert witness, by way of-expert: declaration, in.
support of Professor Dershowitz’s motion, to disqualify Mr. Boics and-his law firm in, Giuffr ey.
Dershowitz, 1.:1.9-cv-03377 (SDNY), a:pending defamation case that might be described as “Epstcin-
related.” My work as an expert witness, which. conéladed.in June, did not involve.my representation of,
or advocacy on behalf of, Professor Dershowitz. [did not serve as counsel or. as.an advocate‘on
anyone’s behalf'in co- -authoring x the law‘journal article.
