Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 140 Filed 02/04/21 Page 6 of 22
F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979), which required the government to give Maxwell notice and an
opportunity to be heard on its request. And in bypassing Martindell and eviscerating the
guarantee of confidentiality provided by the Protective Order, the government trampled on
Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, which she declined to invoke
in reliance on the protections afforded her by Martindell and the Protective Order.

This Court should (1) suppress all evidence the government obtained from [A
and any other evidence derived therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2016 depositions
and all evidence derived therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six.

ARGUMENT
I. The government’s violation of the Fourth Amendment requires suppression.

The Fourth Amendment provides: “The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and
no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and
particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.” U.S.
Const. amend. IV. The “Fourth Amendment provides protection against a grand jury subpoena
duces tecum too sweeping in its terms ‘to be regarded as reasonable.’” United States v. Dionisio,
410 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1973) (quoting Hale v. Henkel, 201 U.S. 43, 76 (1906), abrogated in part on
other grounds by Murphy v. Waterfront Comm’n of New York Harbor, 378 U.S. 52, 68 (1964)).

The government engages in a “search” for Fourth Amendment purposes when its conduct
encroaches on an individual’s legitimate expectation of privacy. See Katz v. United States, 389
US. 347, 351 (1967) (‘[T]he Fourth Amendment protects people, not places.”). Absent an
exception to the warrant requirement, a governmental search is unconstitutional unless the
government conducts it under a warrant issued based on probable cause to believe a crime has
been committed and that evidence of the crime is likely to be found in the place searched.
