government, stibmits that the sta@téments of 'thée victims, certainly
shed light. on the gravity of the offense conduct, the harm it
has caused, and how sériotis that condtict is. The court can and
should take that into accoqunt. My point was a precedural one;
that it is net the case that the government is submitting this
as evidence in support of its motion, but it 1s certainly the
casé that the victims, experiences, the harms, 'that they have
been caused can be considered by the court with respect to the
nature and circumstances 6f the offense conduct, which we
submit is gravely serious.

THE GOURT: All right. Thank you.

Mr. Cohen, veny briefly, any final points?

MR. GOHEN: Yes, your Horior, very briefly. I won't
get into it, but I don't think she just answered your quest.ion,

about. what, théy are déing with respect to the CVRA victims, but

I, will leave that ‘to the court.

Just. very quickly, two p6éints, your Honor.

The government says in its response now that the case
to be relied upon and distinguished is U.S. v. Epstein: They
didn't raise it in, their opening memorandum or their reply or
in their oral presentation before your Hornior.s To thé extent
your Honor considers it, and we have certainly looked at it and
the transcript. of the proceeding before Judge Berman, most of
that case is about dangerousness, your Honor, which is

something the government is expressly not proceeding under here
