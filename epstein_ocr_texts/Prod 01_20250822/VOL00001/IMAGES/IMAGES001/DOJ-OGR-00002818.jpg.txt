Material,” which is clearly sought for impeachment purposes, is not a'proper subject of a Rule
1'7(c) subpoena:

Lhird, certain of:the:documents:that'the Defendant:secks toobtain:from:BSF are “otherwise
procurable” fromthe Government. Nixon, 418 U.S. at’699. (documents requested pursuant to Rule
1'7(c). must.not be “otherwise procurable” from. another sourec). Requests. 1 and 2 both seck,
communications between, BSF and the: U.S..Attorney, which the Defendant can:procure ‘from the
Government. Similarly; Request 8.secks a Grand Jury Subpoena that(7~_———S—S—_—'FJ bby thee
Government itself, and that ‘the, Defendant can ‘therefore procure from. the Government. Thus, a
Rule: 17(c) subpocna’ to BSF for those documents is improper. See, e.g., United States v. Bergstein,
No. 16° Cr. 746 (PKC), 2017 WL, 6887596, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Dee. 28,!201,7) (“When ‘many’ of the
subpoenaed materials are obtainable through ‘the discovery proccss, a subpoena, contravenes
Nixon's requirement: that:subpocnaed, materials must: not, be otherwise ‘procurable.in advance of
trial by the exercise. of due. diligence.”); United Statés ¥. Boyle, No. 08 Cr. 523 (CM), 2009 WL
484436, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 24, 2009) (quashing a V7(c) subpocna’ where it was “likely that many:
‘of the: documents that defendant seeks in his subpoena are obtainable from, another source—the
United, States Attorney’s Office—with little or no diligence required”).

Finally, Requests 10 and 11 seck.items that ean be:produecd at trial. if they ate shown to be
relevant and admissible. Request ‘10. secks:a pair of cowboy’ boots that the Defendant and Jeffrey:
Epstein, purchased ; for Annie Farmer for inspection, and.copying. Request. 1] isecks the original
copics. of, various photographs of Annic Farmer when she was a teenager, of Maria. Farmer on
Leslie Wexner’s ‘property, of Virginia, Giuffre on, various of Jeffrey. Epstcin and the Defendant’s
‘properties, and of Virginia Giuffre, Prifice. Andrew, and the Defendant in.the Deferidant’s London
townhome. Although. the relevance of these items is: minimal—the photographs, ‘for example, do
not appear to depict:any conduct orevent described:in the indictment—the: Defendant cannot show.
that she “cannot, properly prepare for trial without. such, production. and inspection in‘advanec of
trial and that the failure to obtain'such inspection may. tend,unreasonably to delay the, trial,” which,
is.an independent requirement under Nixon. 418 U.S. at 699. There is simply no reason why, if
the Farmers. and Ms. Giuffre ultimately testify and. if these :items prove. to be relevant. aiid
admissible, these items cannot be produced for inspection at trial.

For all of the ‘foregoing reasons, the ‘Defendant’s. motion ‘to authorize service of the
Subpocna.on BSF should be dénied
