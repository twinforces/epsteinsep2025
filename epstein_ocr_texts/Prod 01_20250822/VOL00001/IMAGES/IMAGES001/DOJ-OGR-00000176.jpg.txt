Lefkowitz, who advised that Epstein was leaning
towards a plea to state charges under a non-prosecu-
tion agreement, and she would be forwarding to
Lefkowitz “our last version of the Non-Prosecution
Agreement.” Acosta asked that Villafafia “make
sure they know it[’]s only a draft” and reminded her
that “[t]he form and language may need polishing.”
Villafana responded, “Absolutely. There were a lot of
problems with their last attempt. They tried to re-open
all the loopholes that I had sewn shut.” Villafafia sent
to Lefkowitz the draft NPA that she had provided to
Lefcourt on September 11, 2007, noting that it was the
“last version” and would “avoid [him] having to
reinvent the wheel.” She also updated the FBI case
agents on the status of negotiations, noting that she
had told her “chain of command... that we are still on
for the [September] 25th [to bring charges] ... , no
matter what.”

After receiving the draft NPA, Lefkowitz asked
Villafafia to provide for his review a factual proffer for
a federal obstruction of justice charge, and, with
respect to the NPA option, asked, “[I]f we go that route,
would you intend to make the deferred [sic] prosecu-
tion agreement public?” Villafafia replied that while a
federal plea agreement would be part of the court file
and publicly accessible, the NPA “would not be made
public or filed with the Court, but it would remain part
of our case file. It probably would be subject to a FOIA
[Freedom of Information Act] request, but it is not
something that we would distribute without compulsory
process.” Villafania told OPR that she believed
Epstein did not want the NPA to be made public

Né FOIA requires disclosure of government records upon
request unless an exemption applies permitting the government
to withhold the requested records. See 5 U.S.C. § 552.
