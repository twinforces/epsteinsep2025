Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97-2 Filed 12/14/20 Page5of5

Further she has been at ALL times inside the United States, contrary to the many wild and
unsubstantiated rumors in the media. She has never left the country wants only to fight the case and
remain in the country to do that. The United States has been her home since 1991 — and she has
*always* returned here. | have witnessed her great humility, | have witnessed her personal warmth and
bravery, and her humanity and great resilience in the face of the tidal waves of negative adverse
publicity in the social media and by the Press, all over the world.
| attest that Ghislaine was only laying low for her own protection against vigilantes and the ‘mob’ who
have been baying for her blood to this day. She has never hid from the authorities and is frustrated that
she never had the opportunity to talk to them personally to counteract all the lies pouring out in the
media.
In regard to bail, | know in every fiber of my being that will NOT skip bail and am co-signing

a bond in the value of $1,500,000 which is secured by i. I myself

do not own any property or | would have put it up without hesitation.
There is another critical reason | know she will not skip bail if released on remand — This is because | am
willing,
to stay with Ghislaine 24 x 7 if she is released into my personal custody — in a residence in New
York that we have located - for as long as necessary. | am prepared to stay with her 24/7 indefinitely and
utterly not seek to flee her bail and | completely assure the court that if she is released into my custody
that she will remain with me 24x7x365 and will not leave the premises unless required to do so by the
court and in direct coordination with them.
Yours respectfully,
