So to cooperate in the way that that kind of rumors out there would mean that

she’s cooperating downwards. She’d be cooperating with people who are much

less culpable than her. Will she name names to try to shave years off of what
would be a lengthy prison sentence maybe, I think you should probably expect
that if she’s going to share information that’s going to actually help her, it’s
probably gonna be about unrelated crimes that she may be aware about because
with respect to this particular operation, in terms of living people, she’s as high as

it gets. ... I think like most of my clients would really hope that she does

cooperate, at least shares the information that she has. I mean I know that it

would only be to help herself but the public deserves to know who was involved
besides her and Jeffrey Epstein, and only she knows that.

The violations of Rule 23.1 did not stop after Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and detention.
Following the detention hearing on July 14, 2020, Mr. Boies, counsel for one of the accusers
who spoke at the hearing, commented on the content of the hearing. As reported by Bloomberg,
Mr. Boies offered his gratuitous critique of defense counsel, commented on the credibility of Ms.
Maxwell and his client, and commented on what Mr. Boies considers “evidence” in this case, all
in violation of subsections (1), (4), (6), and (7) of the Rule:

That’s a dangerous tactic that might backfire at trial, said David Boies, who

represents Farmer and several other women who say they were sexually abused

by Epstein and Maxwell. ... It’s “a tone-deaf argument” that cost Maxwell her
credibility, said Boies, who listened to the hearing remotely.

‘To mount a ‘blame the victim’ defense, particularly in today’s world and trying

to blame these girls for what happened is so contrary to the evidence, is so

contrary to people’s normal sense of morality,’ Boies said. ‘I think that’s just

going to enrage a jury if she goes to trial -- which I would not do if I were
representing her.’

Boies said he was confident Farmer would stand up to cross-examination if

there’s a trial. Farmer, who addressed the court by telephone, urged the judge not

to grant Maxwell bail, calling her a ‘sexual predator who groomed and abused

me.’ Maxwell ‘lied under oath and tormented her survivors,’ Farmer said. Boies

said that Farmer was a 16-year-old who ‘wanted to go to college’ when she met

Maxwell. ‘Maxwell and Epstein tell Annie and her mother ‘we’re having a group

of high school students to this ranch to help them get into college,’ Boies said.

‘But when Annie gets there, there are no high school students, all these claims are

fraudulent and she’s in this isolated place in New Mexico.”®
