So to cooperate in the way that that. kind of rumors out there would mean, that.
she’s cooperating downwards. She’d be cooperating with people who are. much,
less culpable than her. ‘Will she name namés to try to shave years off of what
would be a lengthy prison. sentence maybe, I think you should Probably expect
probably gonna be about unrelated ¢ crimes ‘that she may ‘be: aware about because
with, respect to 'this particular operation, in terms of living people, she’s,as high. as.

would only be to help herself but the public deserves to know who was involved

The violations of Rule:23.1 did not stop after Ms. Maxwell’s arrest and, detention.
Following ‘the detention.hearing on, July'14, 2020, Mr. Boies, counsel ‘for.one. ofthe. accusers
who spoke:at the hearing, commented.on the:content:of the: hearing. As reported by Bloomberg,
Mr. Boies offered his gratuitous critique of defense counsel, commented on,the credibility of Ms.
Maxwell and his client, and commented, on, what Mr. Boies considers “evidence” in this case, all
in‘violation.of subsections (1); (4),:(6), and (7) of the Rule:

That’s a dangerous tactic that might. backfire at trial, ‘said David Boies, who.
represents Farmer and several other women.'who say’ they were sexually abused
by Epstein and Maxwell. ... It’s “a tone-deaf? argument’ that cost: Maxwell her
eredibility, said Boics, who listened to the hearing remotcly..

‘To mount.a ‘blame. the victim’ defense, particularly in. today’s world and trying
to blame these girls for what happened. is so: ‘contrary to the evidence, jis so:
contrary. to. people’s normal ‘sense of morality,’ Boies said. “I. think, that’s just:
going to cnrage a jury if she goes to trial -+ ‘which I would not do if I were.
representing her.”

Boics ‘said he ‘was’ confident ‘Farmer ‘would stand up to. cross-examination. if
there’s a trial. Farmer, who addressed, the court by telephone, urged. the judge not
to grant; Maxwell bail, calling her.a. “sexual predator'who groomed.and. abused.
mc.’ Maxwell ‘lied under oath and ‘tormentéd her survivors,’ Farmer said. Boies
said that Farmer. was.a 16-ycar-old who ‘wanted to go to. college’ when:she met
Maxwell. “Maxwell and ‘Epstein fell, Annie and. her:mother “we're having, a group
of ‘high school students to this ranch to help them get into college,” Boies said.
“But: when Annie gets there, there are no high school students, ‘all these claims are
fraudulent and, she’s in‘this isolated place. in New Mexico. ’¢
