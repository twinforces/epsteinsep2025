Re: United States v. Epstein, Case No. 19-Cr-490 |
|
Dear Judge Berman: |
On behalf of MSW Media, Inc. (“MSW Media”), I respectfully submit this letter motion :
to intervene in the above-captioned case for the purposes of partially supporting and partially |
opposing the Government’s motion to unseal the transcripts of grand jury testimony in this case, 2
filed as Docket No. 61. ,
MSW Media (https://mswmedia.com/) operates numerous podcasts and blogs about |
federal government operations, including Mueller She Wrote, SpyTalk, Daily Beans, and Jack. It
clearly qualifies as a representative of the news media.
MSW Media has standing to intervene in this case for the following reason. On 17 July
2025, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the
Court’s permission to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of
Information Act (“FOIA”) request with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of ail
grand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Maxwell, No, 20-330 (S.D.N.Y.). We
are concerned with the modifier “pertinent” in President Trump’s instruction, and that concern
seemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to “make
appropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying information
prior to releasing the transcripts.” (Dkt. #61 at 2 (emphasis added).)
To be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not
pertain to that information. However, we do have concerns that the Government seems to be
implicitly seeking this Court’s permission to withhold other personaily identifiable information,
such as information about the former defendant’s partners in crime or clients. Accordingly, while
we join the Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make
this narrow independent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of
withholding personally identifiable information unrelated to victims. We intend to litigate this
FOIA request if necessary, and the question of whether such information may be properly
