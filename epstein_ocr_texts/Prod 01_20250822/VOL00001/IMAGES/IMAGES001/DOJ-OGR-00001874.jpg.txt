LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI CG: STERNHEIA

Deprivation of'Communication with Family and Friends: ‘The impact of Ms.
‘Maxwell’s solitary confinement: is aggravated. by the deprivation. of communication. with-friends
and family. She was. limited in the number of familial arid social. calls:to a-degree far less than,
any other detainee of which we are aware; and far less:than even those who have been convicted

Compromised Communication with Legal Counsel: As a consequence of COVID=19,
restrictions have been.placéd on exercise of attorney-client relationship, for all inmates but
seemingly more so for Ms. Maxwell. Scheduled calls have been mishandled by the institution,
resulting in missed legal. calls. Despite numerous requests, only one video conferenee:has been
scheduled, for Ms. Maxwell during the entircty. of her detention. Recently, legal calls have been,
repeatedly denied ‘even, when. confirmed. by‘the Federal Defenders..

All.of Ms. Maxwell’s. CorrLinks emails — all legal corresporiderice between Ms. Maxwell
and counscl,- have:been deleted, well before the [80-day period. in which they may be purged.
‘During in-person legal conferences, Ms.’Maxwell has not been permitted to physically handle:
and review legal documents, provided’ by:counscl. Rather, counsel, must hold. cachpage against
the ‘plastic ‘partition requiring: Ms. Maxwell to read these documents, at times from a distance of
approximatcly four fect through a cloudy plastic. shicld. This mcthod of discovery rewiew ina.
Case: involving hundreds: of thousands of documents :consumes:the majority of a:time-limited
legal conference. It is:painstakingly: slow and, often, impossible.

Additionally, Ms. Maxwell. is denied'water or food. and. the'use of toilet; facilities during
legal visits. She has been told that if she uses the'toilet, the conference will be suspended while
she is scarched, returned toher unit, and. then brought back:to the visiting room. ‘This process is
time-consuming and limits the duration. of the legal conference.

In, advanec of cach. meeting, officers. review her legal materials, slowly and deliberately,
and appear to be reading content and breaching confidentiality of privileged information rather
than. conducting a routine security check. In addition to expericneing difficulty reviewing
electronic discovery because: files do not. open, the officer delivering a hard drive last-weck.
appearcd.to intentionally Ict it fall to the ground, damaging to the device.

While mecting' with counsel, guards, set ‘up a tripod. with.a camera, focused.on Ms.
Maxwell during the entirety ofthe legal.conferenee. When, counsel inquired’why the conferénée
‘was being recorded, the officer claimed the camera:was not: recording. ‘When. counsel ‘inquired
why the camera:was being | focused on the legal conference, the: officer responded that Ms.
Maxwell must. be watched at all times.

‘Conclitsion

These:arbitrary and ‘oncrous restrictions imposed.on.Ms. Maxwell .are:contrary to prison.
rules and: protocols, are not imposed.on other inmates, and, are utterly disproportionate to her
detention. At:no time has Ms. Maxwell. been deemed a-threat to herself or others or’ ‘posed any
disciplinary'issues. Ironically, she has achieved.two of the highest certifications offered at the
MDC: suicide counselor andtedcher/instructor.
