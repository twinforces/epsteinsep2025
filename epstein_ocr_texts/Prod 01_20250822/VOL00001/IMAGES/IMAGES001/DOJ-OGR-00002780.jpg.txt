that is contained in the publicly-filed Indictment in this case. In particular, the additional redactions
proposed by the defense to pages 129 to 134 on March 9, 2021 relate to language that is contained in
Count Six of the publicly filed Indictment in this case. Although the Government respectfully submits
that there is no basis under the applicable standard to redact language that is already publicly available
on the docket in this case, the Government is prepared to file the brief with redactions consistent with
the Order subject to any further direction from the Court. In addition, the defense also requested
earlier today an additional redaction to the bottom of page 134, which is reflected in a red box in the
enclosed memorandum. The language covered by this additional redaction is also related to
information that is in the publicly filed Indictment. Although, as noted above, the Government is
aware of no basis to redact language that is available in the publicly-docketed Indictment, the
Government is prepared to file the brief with this additional redaction, subject to any further direction
from the Court.

The Government respectfully submits under seal the enclosed version of its memorandum of
law with proposed redactions consistent with the Court’s Order, the redactions originally proposed
by the Government and contained on pages 118 to 119, and the additional redaction proposed by the
defendant on page 134. The Government will publicly file its memorandum of law with the enclosed
proposed redactions, unless modified by the Court, at the Court’s direction.

Respectfully submitted,
AUDREY STRAUSS
