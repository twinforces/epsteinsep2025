THE GOVERNMENT’S MEMORANDUM.
IN SUPPORT OF DETENTION

For the reasons set forth herein, the Government respectfully submits that Ghislaine
Maxwell, the. defendant, poses an extreme tisk of flight; that she will not be. able to rebut the.
statutory presumption that no condition or combination. of conditions will reasonably assure the
appearance of the defendant as required; 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E); and that the Court should
therefore order her detained..

The charges in this. case are unquestionably serious: the Indictment alleges that Ghislaine
Maxwell, in partnership with Jeffrey Epstein, a serial:sexual predator, exploited and abused young
girls for years.. As a result of her disturbing and callous conduct, Maxwell now faces the very real
prospect of serving many years in prison. The strength of the Government’s evidence and the
substantial prison term the defendant would facé upon conviction all create a strong incentive. for
the defendant to flee. That risk is only amplified by the defendant’s extensive international ties,
her citizenship in two foreign countries, her wealth; and her lack of meaningful ties to the United
States. In short, Maxwell has three passports,. large sums of money, extensive international
connections, and absolutely no reason to stay in the United States. and face the possibility of'a

lengthy prison sentence.
