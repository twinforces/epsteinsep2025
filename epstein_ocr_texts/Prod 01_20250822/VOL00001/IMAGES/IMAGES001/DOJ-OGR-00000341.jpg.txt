Honorable Richard M. Berman
United, States District. Judge:
July 12, 2019

(2d Cir: 2010) (“Ac:plea agreement binds only. the office of the United States Attorney: for: the
district in which the plea is entered unléss it affirmatively appears thatthe agreement contemplates
a. broader restriction. *) (citing United States. v. Annabi, ‘771. F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per
curiam)). Morcover, any references in.an NPA to the “Government* or the “United States” do not:
abrogate these principles. Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672 (“[A] plea agreement, whereby a. federal
prosecutor agrees that ‘the Government’ will dismiss counts ofan, indictment ... . might’be, thought.
to bar the United States froni reprosecuting the dismissed,charges in any judicial. district.unless the
agreement expressly limits the scope of the agreement’... . However, the law has cvolved. to the
contrary. *) “The mere use > OF the term “government” in the plea agreement does not create an.
district. entering into the agreement.” » United Slates Vv. Salameh, 152 F: 3d 88, 120 (2d Cir: 1998)
(citatrons and internal quotation ‘marks omitted); see. also United States. v. Browns No. 99-1230,
2002 WL. 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2002) (in, analyzing an, SDFL plea agreement,
reiterating the: holding of Annabi and noting’ that. it applics:* ‘even if the plea ‘agreement purports to
bind ‘the Government’” or the “United States”) (summary: order); United States v. Bruno, 159 F.
‘Supp. 3d.311, 321, (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (“The Court disagrees with Defendant’s argument that, the
phrase ‘United States’ shows an intent to bind all United States Attorney’s ‘Offices. Rather; the
‘plea agreement covers only Defendant?s liability:in the SDEL.”).*

In, sum, this issue:is a distraction that has little:relevance to the bail determination and does
nothing to address the defendant’s risk of flight, or: mitigate the danger he poses to the community.

B. ‘The Defendant Wrongly Argucs:the Statute. Docs Not Apply to His Sex Trafficking

Next, the defendant wrongly argues that the “principal. conduct” giving:rise to the charges
Is, his payment of underage girls for sex: acts, and, that: such conduct. could not possibly fall, under:
the charged. statutes. As the defendant. implicitly’ coneedes, Release Motion. at. 14, this is: an.issuc
for. a:motion:to dismiss. Nevertheless, the defendant’s argument is. incorrect’ for two reasons.

‘was also: instrumental on'the supply side g given’ ‘his: role it in recruiting and causing others to recruit
additional victims. He organized, funded, and. perpetuated a scx trafficking scheme. in, two states,
ineluditig ‘with co-conspirators. The fact that he did so for his. own eventual and ‘frequent sexual,
gratification docs not vitiate his role in.enticing and recruiting'victims, ;consistent'with the elements
of ‘the offense with which he. is s charged. The defendant was the leader of a sex-trafficking

* This analysis, similarly cxtends to,.a, non-prosceution agreement. See Wnited States Vv. Laskow,
688 F. Supp: 85.1, 854 (E. D.N.Y. 1988) (“Defendant’ ‘Ss argument, in effect, is. that. unless there i 1s
of the United States Attorney ‘that | are © not ‘parties. to ‘the agreement, This position i is-at odds. with
the law’ in this Circuit, which presumes.a. narrow reading of the boundarics of a‘plea agreement.
unless a defendant ‘can. affirmatively cstablish ‘that. a more cxpansive interpretation was
contemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 771 F.2d at672).
