‘for which she needs to revicw'the native image, many of which are embedded. in other files, she
must write down the Bates number for that document and. then wait-until Monday: to find the
same, document using the laptop computer so that she Can review ‘the full doéument. Moreover,
the. MDC:computer shuts down every two hours, requiring. Ms. Maxwell to:reboot the computer
and find-her place i in the documents to.resume her review. This process can, take: 20-30 minutes,
all of which is lost time: In. addition, the power of central, processing unit.of the MDC computer
‘is very slow. Uploading'videos can take up to a half hour; time’ that.cannot be ‘used. to review’
other documents. When the: computer automatically. shuts down, vidéos néed to be re-opened,
requiring Ms. Maxwell-to locate:the portion-of the video she was viewing when the computer
shut ‘down. In.sum, using the: ‘prison.computer is a problem, not.a. solution.

Ms. Maxwell’s:review of discovery is challenging enough on the laptop computer'that.
‘was-provided. Even with'the laptop, Ms. Maxwell is unable to search, unable to-print, and
Unable'to tag or highlight documents for later review. She must review millions of pages of
unwieldy documents produced in various formats (native, image, text) one page at.a time—with
hand c on. nthe limited amount of’ paper she i is s provided. ‘And she i is s not permitted to s have any’
supplies to organize the voluminous Icgal papers. Hard drives provided by: the government. have.
been mishandled by MDE staff (dropped on the floor and slammed on.a éart) causing them. to
become degraded and unstable and to randomly shut down. While the: laptop docs:not solve all. of
these issues, it performs far better than, the MDC.computers. The time, resources and funds
expended, on'problems caused by the electronic discovery and. the computers is unnecessary,
wasteful, and ‘frustrating. The MDC is in. no‘position = and ‘is neither qualified nor experienced =
to challenge Ms. Maxwell’s and her counscl’s claim that she needs access to, the laptop on the
weckends and holidays to even hope to finish. reviewing the millions of pages of documents
produced in. discovery: . .

The MDC’s assertion, that.Ms. Maxwell’s access to her'attorncys is a reason. to deny her
access to the laptop computer on’ weekend.and holidays is ‘tion-sénsical. ‘One has absolutely
nothing to-do with the other. .And it ignores the fact that, aside from. time to. review discovery or.
communicate: with counscl,.Ms..Maxwell is far more restricted than all other. MDC inmates.
Other inmates have ‘unlimited time to communicate with other-inmates.. ‘With, exception, of
‘inmates detained in,the SHU for disciplinary reasons, all other MDC. inmates. have unlimited,
time to ‘interact: with other inmates. ‘Other than calls’with family or communication with counscl,
Ms. Maxwell has no human contact cxeept with guards who wicld:power over her, overmanage,
her, and have psychologically and physically abused her. And:complaints regarding:
mistreatment’by guards have led to reprisals against'Ms. Maxwell.

Rather than, state a valid reason for opposing the :Court’s, directive, the MDC’s opposition
shines a klicg light on. the deficiencies of its electronics and the limitations imposed on all
‘inmates, most especially those detained pretrial. The restrictions placed 'on pretrial detainees, goes
beyond deprivation ‘of liberty. Their ability to prepare for trial :is compromised, theiracecss to
counscl. is restricted, and their right to effective assistance of counscl, is jcopardized. The
pandemic has made the situation,even more dire. Requiring pretrial. detainees, including Ms.
Maxwell,'to review terabytes of electronic discovery on-inadequaté computers further tips an
already unlevel playing field:to the detriment of criminal defendants.
