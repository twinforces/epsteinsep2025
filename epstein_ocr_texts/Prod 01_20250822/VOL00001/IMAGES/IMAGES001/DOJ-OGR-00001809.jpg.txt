came from another state, agents, or lawyers. In addition, the Government has disclosed the
existence, forcexample, of additional filcs and. investigations including 28 boxes of matcrial from
the United States Attorney’s. Florida office, the Department of Justice, and the United, States
Attorney’s Georgia office.

It is unclear precisely what. the Government will do with this material. On the one hand.
the:Government suggests it “intends” to review the. files for “materials that warrant: disclosure in
this casé.”'On-the other hand, the, Government’s létter includes a lengthy disclaimer about: why
the Government believes ‘it has ‘no obligation to locate, obtain, or produce:the discovery. The
authority cited by the Government in support of its disclaimers easily distinguishable: This case
docs not involve material gathered independently by the SEC, the Public. Company. Accounting
Oversight.Board, or'the’New York, Stock Exchange. See United Staies‘v. € -ollins, 409°F. Supp.
3d 228, 241-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (“SEG”); United States v.. Middendorf,, No. 18 Cr. 36 (JPO),
2018 WL 3956494, at’ *4-5 (S. D.N.Y.. Aug. 17, 2018) (“PCAOB”): United States *. Finnerty,
411.F, Supp. 2d 428, 433. (S.D.N-Y.. 2006) (“NYSE”).

The Government does notask;the Courtto rule ¢ on 1 its view of itself and, clearly this
the information ‘tO, Ms. Maxwell. the Government @ 0s to: erat ‘offort to preview why It may iiot.
Ms. Maxwell submits that all this.material is ‘discoverable. for the reasons already discussed.

The Method and Timing of the Government’s Revised Discovery: Plan is Inadequate and.
Prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.

Ms. Maxwell. agreed, in advance of her detention hearing, to.a trial more than one year,
from her-detention.. She agreed to this plan on the representation that she would. be provided. with
full discovery no later than November, 9, 2020. See ECF #25, “Completion, of Discovery to
include electronic materials is dué by Monday, November 9, 2020.” This representation now’
scems incorréct. The Government, in:its letter tothe Court, is simply’ fronting the reasons;why
the completion of discovery will likely not.occur by November 9, 2020.

Ms. Maxwell, when, agrecing'to a trial, in July 2021, outside’the time: limits established by
18. US.C. § 3161, thought.that she would be provided’ with meaningful discovery with sufficient
time. to prepare. This assumption also seems incorrect. In its letter to-the. Court-the Government’
proposes that witness statements be:provided.a.mere four weeks prior to trial, for the important
witnesses; and cight weeks for the unimportant witnesses. This is.a. case with 26-year-old
claims, allegedly occurring in multiple states and, countries. It is.a ‘certainty that-matcrial
witnesses, live in other countries, and that these witnesses cannot be compelled to appear in New’
York. Sccuring out-of-country testimony is difficult cven where. a defendant.has becn. provided
with the names: of her accuscrs.and details about.the allegations. The Partics. shave not yet: met.and
conferred about the timing of disclosure of:witness statements, so. it is ‘premature to: discuss these
‘issues with the Court. "We note, however, that under the Government’s proposed timetable, it.
will. be impossible for Ms. Maxwell to adequately: ‘prepare for'trial.

The 'Government’s suggested timeline also:impairs. Ms. Maxwell’s ability to effectively
address significant‘legal issucs including: motions to suppress evidence, motions to dismiss the
