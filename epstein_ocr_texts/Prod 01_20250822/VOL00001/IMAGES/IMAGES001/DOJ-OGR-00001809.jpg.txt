came from another state, agents, or lawyers. In addition, the Government has disclosed the
existence, for example, of additional files and investigations including 28 boxes of material from
the United States Attorney’s Florida office, the Department of Justice, and the United States
Attomey’s Georgia office.

It is unclear precisely what the Government will do with this material. On the one hand
the Government suggests it “intends’ to review the files for “materials that warrant disclosure in
this case.” On the other hand, the Government’s letter includes a lengthy disclaimer about why
the Government believes it has no obligation to locate, obtain, or produce the discovery. The
authority cited by the Government in support of its disclaimer is easily distinguishable. This case
does not involve material gathered independently by the SEC, the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board, or the New York Stock Exchange. See United States v. Collins, 409 F. Supp.
3d 228, 241-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (“SEC”); United States v. Middendorf, No. 18 Cr. 36 (JPO),
2018 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2018) (“PCAOB”); United States v. Finnerty,
411 F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (“NYSE”).

The Government does not ask the Court to rule on its view of itself and clearly this
argument will be held on another day. It is troubling, however, that instead of simply providing
the information to Ms. Maxwell the Government goes to great effort to preview why it may not.
Ms. Maxwell submits that all this material is discoverable for the reasons already discussed.

The Method and Timing of the Government’s Revised Discovery Plan is Inadequate and
Prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.

Ms. Maxwell agreed, in advance of her detention hearing, to a trial more than one year
from her detention. She agreed to this plan on the representation that she would be provided with
full discovery no later than November 9, 2020. See ECF #25, “Completion of Discovery to
include electronic materials is due by Monday, November 9, 2020.” This representation now
seems incorrect. The Government, in its letter to the Court, is simply fronting the reasons why
the completion of discovery will likely not occur by November 9, 2020.

Ms. Maxwell, when agreeing to a trial in July 2021, outside the time limits established by
18 U.S.C. § 3161, thought that she would be provided with meaningful discovery with sufficient
time to prepare. This assumption also seems incorrect. In its letter to the Court the Government
proposes that witness statements be provided a mere four weeks prior to trial, for the important
witnesses, and eight weeks for the unimportant witnesses. This is a case with 26-year-old
claims, allegedly occurring in multiple states and countries. It is a certainty that material
witnesses live in other countries, and that these witnesses cannot be compelled to appear in New
York. Securing out-of-country testimony is difficult even where a defendant has been provided
with the names of her accusers and details about the allegations. The parties have not yet met and
conferred about the timing of disclosure of witness statements, so it is premature to discuss these
issues with the Court. We note, however, that under the Government’s proposed timetable, it
will be impossible for Ms. Maxwell to adequately prepare for trial.

The Government’s suggested timeline also impairs Ms. Maxwell’s ability to effectively
address significant legal issues including motions to suppress evidence, motions to dismiss the
