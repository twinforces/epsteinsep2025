Those: obligations, and not Rule 17 subpoenas, provide the: avenue through. which,
defendants, in criminal. cases obtain. discovery.. As the Supreme: Court has explained, “[i]t: was not:
intended by. Rule ‘16 to give a limited right of' discovery, and then by: Rule 17 to give a right of
discovery in.the’broadest.terms.” Bowmun Dairy Co. v. ‘United States,.341 U.S. 214, 220 (1951);
see also United States v. Pririns 486, F.2d.1363, 1368 (2d Cir. 1973) (“A Subpocna. duces tecum in
a.criminal ‘case: is not intended.as a means of discovery.”). Unlike the rules. of: civil. proecdure—
permitting theissuance of subpoenas to'scck’production of documents or materials which, although,
themselves not admissible, may lead to admissible. evidence—the criminal rules do, not authorize
the issuance of such broad pretrial, subpoenas under Rule: 17., See Wnited States v: Cherry, 876 F.
Supp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. 1995); United Siaies v. Gross, 24 F.R.D. 138, 141 (S.D.N.Y. 1959)
(Rule..1.7(c) cannot be used “to obtain leads.as to the existence of'additional documentary evidence
orto seck information relating to the defendant’s case, This type of discovery, permissible under
the Fedéral Rules of Civil Procedure, has not been authorized :for.criminal 'trials.”).

The purpose.of Rule 17(c) is to “expedite the trial by providing a'time and place before
trial.:for the inspection, of” specific. materials. that the partics. intend, to offer into ‘evidence. See’
United States ¥. Lagliaferro, No. 1.9 Cr. 472 (PAC), 2021, WL-980004, at *2.(S.D.N-Y. Mar. 16,
20211) (citing Bowman Dairy Co., 341, U.S, at 220 (19511)); seealso United States. Ulbricht, 858
F.3d 71, ‘109 (2d Cir. 2017) (explaining that the rule “allows ‘partics to subpocna. documents and.
objects to be introduced at criminal trials”), abrogated on other groundsas recognized by United
States v. Chambers, 75\ F. App’x 44, 46 & n.1 (2d Cir. 2018) (summary order). Accordingly,
the Supreme Court. has explained that, to ‘require production. of materials ‘pursuant: to Rule 17(c),
the party secking production must show'that:

(1) that the documents: are cvidentiary:and relevant; (2) that'they are
not otherwise ‘procurable. reasonably’ in advance of trial by: exercise
