“familial and personal connections abroad,” and “substantial financial resources,” (Tr. 83-84), with
a demonstrated sophistication in hiding herself and her assets, who, for the myriad reasons
discussed herein and identified at the original hearing—including the seriousness of the offense,
the strength of the Government’s evidence, and the potential length of sentence—presents a

defendant currently has thirteen hours per day, seven days per week to review electronic discovery.
Also during that time, the defendant has access to email with defense counsel, calls with defense
