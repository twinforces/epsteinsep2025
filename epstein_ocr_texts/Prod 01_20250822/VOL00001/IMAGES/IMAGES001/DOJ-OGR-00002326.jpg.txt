Southern District of New York (“Jury Plan”), available at
https://nysd.uscourts. gov/sites/default/files/pdf/juryplan_ feb _2009.pdf. The Jury Plan uses voter
registration lists as the exclusive source of names of prospective jurors. Jury Plan, Art. IIT.A.
From these names, two master jury wheels are constructed: one for the Manhattan courthouse
and one for the White Plains courthouse.

The Jury Plan provides that to fill the master wheels, jurors are to be drawn from each
county's voter registration list. For each county, the proportion of jurors drawn should be the
same as the proportion of that county's number of registered voters to the total number of

the two master wheels so as to “reasonably reflect the relative number of registered voters in
each county” within the respective wheels. /d., Art. IV.B. According to the Jury Plan, the
“Master Jury Wheels shall be emptied and refilled by not later than September 1 following the
date of each Presidential Election.” /d., Art. III.B; see also United States v. Reyes, 934 F. Supp.

The Jury Plan further provides that at least once a year, names are to be drawn randomly
from the master jury wheels in an amount sufficient to meet the anticipated demand for jurors for

to determine their qualifications to sit as jurors, which they are instructed to return within ten
days. Jd. Art. HI.E. The qualified jury wheels comprise those individuals who complete and
