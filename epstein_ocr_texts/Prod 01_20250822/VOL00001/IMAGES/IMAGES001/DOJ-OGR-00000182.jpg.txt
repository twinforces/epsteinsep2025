message, “That is fine. [The West Palm Beach manager]
and I will nail everything down, we just want to get a
final blessing.”

Negotiations continued throughout the day on
Wednesday, September 19, 2007, with Villafana and
Lefkowitz exchanging emails regarding the factual
proffer for a plea and the scheduling of a meeting to
finalize the plea agreement’s terms. During that
exchange, Villafafiia made clear to Lefkowitz that the
time for negotiating was reaching an end:

I hate to have to be firm about this, but we
need to wrap this up by Monday. I will not
miss my [September 25 charging] date when
this has dragged on for several weeks already
and then, if things fall apart, be left in a less
advantageous position than before the nego-
tiations. I have had an 82-page pros memo
and 53-page indictment sitting on the shelf
since May to engage in these negotiations.
There has to be an ending date, and that date
is Monday.

Early that afternoon, Lourie—who was participating
in the week’s negotiations from his new post at the
Department in Washington, D.C.—asked Villafafia to
furnish him with the last draft of the plea agreement
she had sent to defense counsel, and she provided him
with the “18/12 split” draft she had sent to Lefkowitz
the prior afternoon. After reviewing that draft, Lourie
told Villafafia it was a “[glood job” but he questioned
certain provisions, including whether the USAO’s
agreement to suspend the investigation and hold
all legal process in abeyance should be in the plea
issues that hindered the prosecution team. See Chapter Two, Part
Three, Section V.E.
