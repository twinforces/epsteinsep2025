appalling sexual abuse, and utterly fails to meet its burden of rebutting the presumption that no
condition. or :combination of conditions will rcasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as
required and the safety of the community. Rather than even attempting: to address the: g grave risks
of releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resourecs and a, history of abusing minors,
the defendant instead proposes a’ bail package that.amounts. to little more, than,.a, barely- secured
bond masquerading as a 14-point plan. The Court should, reject. the defendant?s application and,
order him detained pending*trial.

Among other things, the proposed bail package:contemplates the defendant pledging as the
principal security a property ‘that: has already been identified, by the Government.as subjcet to
forfeiture upon. the déefendant?s conviction, and’which'thercfore is of no value as collateral. His
proposed global Waiver of extradition is, unenforceable, and even ifenforceable would be little
comfort to victims forced ‘to wait additional years while ‘the defendant i is located and retumed to

circumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that. the defendant. should be: housed. where he

BACKGROUND.

As previously set forth, a federal. grand jury. in this ‘District. returned ‘an. indictment: (the
“Indietment”) charging the defendant with violating Title. 18, United. States Code, Section. 1519,
and conspiracy’to commit'the same.

As charged by’ the ‘grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a ycars-long
scheme: to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the: defendant enticed, and recruited dozens

defendant, which would'be performed nude or partially nude, would ‘become increasingly’ sexual
