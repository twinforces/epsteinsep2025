law, seeks to diminish and demean the harm caused to the many victims of the defendant’s
appalling sexual abuse, and utterly fails to meet its burden of rebutting the presumption that no
condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant as
required and the safety of the community. Rather than even attempting to address the grave risks
of releasing a defendant with extraordinary financial resources and a history of abusing minors,
the defendant instead proposes a bail package that amounts to little more than a barely-secured
bond masquerading as a 14-point plan. The Court should reject the defendant’s application and
order him detained pending trial.

Among other things, the proposed bail package contemplates the defendant pledging as the
principal security a property that has already been identified by the Government as subject to
forfeiture upon the defendant’s conviction, and which therefore is of no value as collateral. His
proposed global waiver of extradition is unenforceable, and even if enforceable would be little
comfort to victims forced to wait additional years while the defendant is located and returned to
this country. The promise to “deregister or otherwise ground” his private jet is meaningless given
his wealth and ability to easily secure other means of travel. The two co-signers he proposes only
further highlight his minimal community ties, including his lack of any family in or near the
District. Electronic monitoring would merely give the defendant less of a head start in fleeing—
and does not guard against the risk of him endangering victims in the very home where he has
continued to hoard nude images of young women and girls. And the private security force he
proposes to guard his gilded cage, a proposal already rejected by this Court in similar
circumstances, simply reinforces the obvious fact that the defendant should be housed where he
can be secured at all times: a federal correctional center.

The defendant faces a presumption of detention, Pretrial Services has recommended
detention, and victims of the defendant seek his detention. Because there are no set of conditions
short of incarceration that can reasonably assure the appearance of the defendant or reasonably
protect the community from the dangers he poses if released, the Court should order him detained.

BACKGROUND

As previously set forth, a federal grand jury in this District returned an indictment (the
“Indictment’”) charging the defendant with violating Title 18, United States Code Section 1519,
and conspiracy to commit the same.

As charged by the grand jury, the facts giving rise to those counts involve a years-long
scheme to sexually abuse underage girls. Specifically, the defendant enticed and recruited dozens
of minor girls to engage in sex acts with him, for which he paid the victims hundreds of dollars in
cash, in at least two different states. Victims were initially recruited to provide “massages” to the
defendant, which would be performed nude or partially nude, would become increasingly sexual
in nature, and would typically include one or more sex acts, including groping and direct or indirect
contact with victims’ genitals. To perpetuate this exploitation of underage girls, the defendant
actively encouraged certain victims to recruit additional girls to be similarly sexually abused. He
paid these victim-recruiters hundreds of dollars for each additional girl they brought to him,
creating a network of underage victims for him to exploit in New York and Palm Beach.
