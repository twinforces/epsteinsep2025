INTRODUCTION AND
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT

Defendants in criminal cases rely on the promises
made by the Department of Justice when deciding whether
to plead guilty and face the life-altering consequences
of doing so. The government’s promises, made in return
for demanding the defendant’s waiver of constitutional
rights, should be rigorously enforced. Yet the lower court
permitted the government to escape its promises and
incorrectly limited the scope of the non-prosecution and
plea agreement (NPA) well beyond its plain language.

The intentionally broad scope of this NPA may be
surprising in retrospect but that does not change the
words on the page. Indeed, a survey of plea agreements
from across the country shows that the Department of
Justice knows how to limit a plea agreement’s reach to
a single prosecutorial district rather than making it a
nationwide restriction against future prosecution. Where,
as here, the “United States ... agrees that it will not
institute any criminal charges against any potential co-
conspirators” (App. 31a), without imposing any geographic
limitation, no part of the Department of Justice may
institute criminal charges against any co-conspirator in
any district.

The Department of Justice directs prosecutors to be
careful when exercising their authority to bind the entire
Department but there is no question that prosecutors
have the authority to do so. That they rarely exercise
this authority is not a ground for invalidating it, quite
the opposite.
