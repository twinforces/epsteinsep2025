Clerk
Supreme Court of the United States
Washington, D.C. 20543
Re: Ghislaine Maxwell v. United States of America,
S.Ct. No. 24-1073
Dear Mr. Harris:
The petition for a writ of certiorari in the above-captioned case was filed on April 10, 2025, and
placed on the docket on April 14, 2025. The government’s response is due on May 14, 2025.
We respectfully request, under Rule 30.4 of the rules of this Court, an extension of time to and
including June 13, 2025, within which to file the government’s response.
This extension is requested to complete preparation of the government’s response, which was
delayed because of the heavy press of earlier assigned cases to the attorneys handling this matter.
Sincerely,
D John Sauer
Solicitor General
