“trafficked” to third party dignitaries, politicians and.academics.* Suffice it fo say, had.the
defamation matter proceeded,to trial, Ms. Maxwell would have-had ‘no difficulty demonstrating
that Ms. Giuffre had publicly made allegations that-were “untrue” and “obvious lies,” defeating
any civil liability.

Because 'Giuffre could not prove the truth of her own statements, she. and her lawyers
attemptcd.to: convert what should have been.a relatively straightforward factual question—the:
truth of Ms. Maxwell’s denial. of :Giuffre’s fantastical allegations—into a claim, that. Giuffre was
“sexually trafficked” by Epstein 'to other men. ‘This attempt, however, involved inadmissible and
improper evidence, which, was the subject.of approximately 50 motions that‘remained undecided.
at the time that the defamation action. was dismissed.

circus. Case'No. 15-cv-7433, Doc. #.38. ‘Plaintiff opposed, Ms. Maxwells proposed protective
order, instead urging*the Court, to permit disclosure of “confidential” information in relation to
“investigations by law enforcement.” Jd., Doc. #.40.at.3-4.. Ms..Maxwell opposed this
provision, and, ultimately; the Protective Order was entered without Giuffre’s proposed law

enforcement exception. Ex. G.
