New Information for the Court’s Consideration
The defense has devoted substantial time and effort to compile information that was not
available to Ms. Maxwell at the time of the initial bail hearing that squarely addresses each of the
factors the Court considered at that hearing. Because of these efforts, Ms. Maxwell can now
present the following additional information in support of her renewed bail application:

¢ Letter from Ms. Maxwell’s spouse. This letter demonstrates that Ms. Maxwell has
powerful family ties to the United States that she will not abandon. It describes the
committed relationship between Ms. Maxwell and her spouse, who is a U.S citizen,
and how they lived a quiet family life — in the
United States for over four years immediately prior to her arrest. The letter further
explains that Ms. Maxwell was forced to leave her family and drop out of the public
eye, not because she was trying to evade law enforcement, but because the intense
media frenzy and threats following the arrest and death of Jeffrey Epstein threatened

time of the initial hearing. (Ex. A).

¢ Letters from numerous other friends and family members. These letters from
Ms. Maxwell’s other sureties and several family members and friends attest to Ms.
Maxwell’s strong, forthright character and their confidence that she will not flee. The
sureties also describe the significant financial distress they would suffer if Ms.
Maxwell were to violate her bail conditions. (Exs. B-N, W-X).

¢ Financial report. The financial report, prepared by the accounting firm Macalvins
Limited, provides an accounting of Ms. Maxwell’s financial condition from 2015-
2020, and discloses (1) all of her own assets, (ii) all assets held in trust, and (ii1) all of
the assets held by her spouse over that same time period. The report reflects that the
total value of assets in all three categories is approximately $22.5 million, which is
the amount of the proposed bond. (Ex. O).

* Report from former IRS agent. a a former IRS agent with over 40
years of experience in criminal tax and financial fraud investigations, reviewed the
Macalvins report and confirmed that it presents a complete and accurate picture of
Ms. Maxwell and her spouse’s assets from 2015-2020. (Ex. P).

time of her arrest. (Ex. S).

extradition, Ms. Maxwell will present irrevocable written waivers of her right to
