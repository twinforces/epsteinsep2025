THE GOVERNMENT’S REPLY MEMORANDUM
IN FURTHER SUPPORT OF DETENTION

The Government respectfully submits this reply memorandum in further support of its
motion for detention, dated July 2, 2020 (the “Detention Memorandum”) (Dkt. 4), and in response
to the defendant’s memorandum in opposition (the “Opposition Memorandum’) (Dkt. 18).

The charges against Ghislaine Maxwell arise from her essential role in sexual exploitation
that caused deep and lasting harm to vulnerable victims. At the heart of this case are brave women
who are victims of serious crimes that demand justice. The defendant’s motion wholly fails to
appreciate the driving force behind this case: the defendant’s victims were sexually abused as
minors as a direct result of Ghislaine Maxwell’s actions, and they have carried the trauma from
these events for their entire adult lives. They deserve to see her brought to justice at a trial.

There will be no trial for the victims if the defendant is afforded the opportunity to flee the
jurisdiction, and there is every reason to think that is exactly what she will do if she is released.
For the reasons detailed in the Detention Memorandum, and as further discussed below, the
defendant poses a clear risk of flight, and no conditions of bail could reasonably assure her
continued appearance in this case. Among other concerns: (1) she is a citizen of a country that
does not extradite its own citizens; (2) she appears to have access to considerable wealth
