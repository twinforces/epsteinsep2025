Re: Unsealing of Grand Jury Transcripts in U.S. v. Epstein, 19-cr-490 (RMB) and U.S. v.
Maxwell, 20-cr-330 (PAE)
Dear Judges Berman and Engelmayer,

We write on behalf of Annie Farmer in response to the belated notice that we received from
the Department of Justice on July 25, 2025, advising that the Court is seeking letters on behalf of
victims setting out their positions on the proposed disclosures of Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine
Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts.!

By the Government’s admission, “over one thousand victims” suffered from Epstein’s and
Maxwell’s actions. To date, however, the combined forces of our country’s law enforcement
agencies have only ever arrested these two individuals in connection with crimes committed
against countless young women and girls, and the Government’s recent suggestion that no further
criminal investigations are forthcoming is a cowardly abdication of its duties to protect and serve.”

‘Ms. Farmer is a survivor of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes and testified at Maxwell’s trial.
While the undersigned counsel has, at various times, represented hundreds of victims of Epstein
and Maxwell aside from Ms. Farmer, the Department of Justice’s notice did not identify the
specific victims whose names, likenesses, or information may be subject to disclosure.

? Of those two, Epstein escaped justice through his apparent suicide, and Maxwell is now, to the
victims’ horror, herself attempting to escape justice by negotiating for herself a potential pardon
