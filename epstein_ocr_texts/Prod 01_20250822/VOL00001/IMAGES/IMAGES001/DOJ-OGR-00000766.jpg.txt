Re: Unsealing of Grand Jury Transcripts in U.S. v. Epstein, 19-cr-490 (RMB) and. U.S. v.
Maxwell, 20-cr-330 (PAE)

Dear Judges ‘Berman, and Engelmayer,.

We write on behalf of Annic.Parmer in response to the belated notice that we:received from.
the ‘Department of Justice on July 25,2025, advising that the Court is secking letters on, behalf of
victims setting out'thcir positions on the proposed disclosures of Jeffrey Epstein’s ‘and, Ghislaine:
Maxwell’s grand jury transcripts.!

By the Government’s admission, “over one thousand victims” suffered from,Epstein’s and.
Maxwell’s ‘actions. To date, however, the combined, forees of our country’s law enforcement.
against. countless young women and girls, and the Government’s recent suggestion that no further
criminal investigations are forthcoming is'a.cowardly:abdication, of its duties to protect and serve.”

':Ms. Farmer is a ‘survivor of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes and testified at: Maxwell’s frial.
While the undersigned counsel. has, at various timés, represented. hundreds of. victims of Epstcin
and. Maxwell. aside from. Ms.. Farmer, the Department ‘of Justice’s notice did. not identify the:
specific victims whose:names, likenesses, or. information may’be subject to disclosure.

° Of those two, Epstein escaped, justice through his apparent. suicide, and Maxwell is:now, to the
victims’ horror, herself-attempting to escape justice by negotiating for herself a potential pardon
