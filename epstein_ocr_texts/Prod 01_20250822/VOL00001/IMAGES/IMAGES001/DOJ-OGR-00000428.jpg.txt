1 that those victims weren't treated as badly as the parade of

2 horribles he has in mind. But for now the question is whether
3 the defendant's attendance can be assured.

4 And with respect to the nonprosecution agreement --

S THE COURT: I'm not sure I would refer to something as
6 only statutory rape. The use of the word "only" before

7 "statutory rape" I'm not sure sits well. But go ahead.

8 MR. ROSSMILLER: And I agree, your Honor.

9 With respect to the actual substance, the Southern

10 District of Florida has represented in public filings that the
11 nonprosecution agreement was limited to the Southern District
12 of Florida, and we can litigate that in a motion to dismiss,

13 but it is simply not relevant here.

14 With respect to the statute of limitations,

15 Mr. Weingarten says that the conduct is old. He did not say

16 that that it is beyond the statute of limitations because it is
17 not.

18 And, finally, it is not the same conduct. Some of the
19 conduct overlaps. Some of the conduct does not. And in
20 particular, one of the two counts of the indictment is
al predicated exclusively on New York victims.
22 So for all of those reasons, we just ask the court to
23 consider those responses as it awaits the defendant's filings
24 later this week.
25 MR. WEINGARTEN: Can I just make one point to clarify?
