only statutory rape. The use of the word "only" befione
“statutory rape" I'm not Sure sits well. But go ahead.

MR, ROSSMLLLER: And I agree, your Honor.

With respect. to the actual substance, the Southern
District of Florida has represented, in, public filings ‘that the
nonprosecution agreement was limited to the Sd6utherh District.
of Florida, and we can, Jutigate that, in a motion to dismiss,
but it. is simply not relevant here.

With respect to the statute of limitations,

Mr, Wéingdrten Says that the Gohduct is old. He did fot say
that that it 1s beyond the statute of Limitations because it is
not.

And, finally, it is not the same conduct. Some of the
cénduct overlaps. Some of the conduct doés nét. And in
pargticular, one of the two counts of the indictment is
predicated exclusively on New York victims.

So for all of those reasons, we just. ask ‘the court to
consider those responses as it awaits the defendant's filings
later this week.

MR. WEINGARTEN: ‘Can I just make one point to clarify?
