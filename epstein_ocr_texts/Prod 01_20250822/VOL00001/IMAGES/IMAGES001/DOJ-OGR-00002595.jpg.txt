parties to the NPA clearly intended to confer immunity on potential co-conspirators of Epstein,
such as Ms. Maxwell.

B. The NPA’s Prohibition on Prosecution of Potential Co-Conspirators Is Not

Limited to the SDFL.

The NPA stands in contrast to the standard non-prosecution agreement used in this
District and other jurisdictions, which typically is explicitly limited to prohibit only prosecutions
by the USAO for the district in which the plea is entered. The standard agreement in this District
contains the following language: “It is further understood that this Agreement does not bind any
federal, state, or local prosecuting authority other than this Office.” See, e.g., Perez v. United
States, Nos. 14 Civ. 846, 04 Cr. 937-1, 2015 WL 3413596 , at *8 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). No such
language is included in the NPA. Moreover, unlike the standard agreement, the NPA refers
separately to “the United States” in some places and to the USAO-SDFL in others, in ways that
make clear that any reference to “the United States” was intended to refer to the government as a
whole, not merely the USAO-SDFL.

1. The NPA is binding on the USAO in this District.

The government’s contention that the NPA does not bind the USAO in this District
cannot be squared with the clear language of the co-conspirator immunity provision. On its face,
that provision does not limit the preclusive effect of the NPA as to potential co-conspirators to
prosecutions in the SDFL. Indeed, consistent with Epstein’s desire to obtain the broadest
immunity possible, the NPA expressly provides that, in exchange for Epstein’s compliance with
the terms and conditions therein, “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any
criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” with no express geographic
limitation. NPA at 5 (emphasis added). In contrast, the clauses regarding the non-prosecution of
Epstein expressly defer “prosecution in this District’ and provide that no prosecution for the
