The charges in the Indictment arose out-of a, broader ‘investigation into Epstcin’s sexual.
abuse of minors, which.covered. time periods, beyond. that. included in’the Indictment. During the
coursé of that. broadér investigation, the Government.has interviewed dozens of victims who were
sexually abused. by Epstcin. Ass part of that broader investigation, the Government has obtained a
limited. number of sensitive ‘documents and photographs regarding certain victims who were
sexually abused by Epstcin.after 1997 (the “Materials”). These ‘Materials. include, for example,
school photographs of certain victims and. records, ‘such as bank and travel, records, for certain,
victims. The Government does ‘fot anticipate offering these Materials as evidence at trial in this
case, and the ‘Materials do. not relate to individuals Whom the Government currently anticipates.
calling. as witnesses at trial. Morcover, ‘the Matcrials post-date the time period. charged. in. the
Indictment.

The Government has reviewed the’ Materials for any potentially exculpatory material, and
has found, none. Nevertheless, bécause the Government, is taking an, ¢xpansivé approach to
disclosures:in this case, the Government intends to-produce these:Materialsto the defendant along
with 3500 material for non-testifying witnesses ‘sufficiently’ i in-advance of trial:in order to cnable:
the defendant.to ‘review and, if appropriate, make usc of the Materials in her defensc.. In particular,
the Government intends to produce to the defendant, pursuant to.a protective order, statements of
all ‘witnesses the Government, has interviewed. ‘during its broadcér investigation, even. if the
Government does, not intend to call those, witnesses at. trial. Should'the, Court grant ‘the, instant’
application, the Government would produce the Materials, along with any witness statements
pertaining to the victims identificd in the Materials, at the same time as all other statements by:
non-testifying witnesses. ‘The: Government is prepared, to ‘make: that production. as early as cight:
wecks in advance of trial. Because the volume of the Materials is limited to, approximately. 40
photographs, and approximately: 40 pages of documents, defense counsel’s review of the Materials,
‘1S unlikely to be: unduly: time consuming, thus minimizing:any. potential prejudice to the defendant
from the delayed production.

_ Delayed disclosure of ‘the Matcrials is, warranted. because they include identifying
information as part tof the Government’ S: ongoing: investigation, ‘the: immediate: disclosure of which
would. risk interfering with ‘the Government’s. ongoing investigation. See United States: v.
Mannino, 480 F. Supp..1.182, 1188(S.D:N.¥. 1979) (permitting delayed, production of documents
whose immediate:disclosure to the: defense would interfere with ongoing investigation); cf. United
States v. Smith, 985. F. Supp. 506, 531-32 (2d Cir. 2013). (risk of ‘interference: with ongoing
investigation sufficient’ good cause for entry of Rule 16 protective order). Immediate disclosure
of these materials would have the effect. of ania revealing to the defendant the: identitics of
