Re: Additional opinion on the extradition of nationals by the French government

1. This memorandum was written pursuant to a request from Olivier Laude, a partner at
the French firm Laude Esquier Champey acting on behalf of Cohen & Gresser LLP as
counsel for Ms Ghislaine Maxwell. The request was made in the context of ongoing bail
proceedings involving Ms Maxwell in the United States of America (hereafter “USA”),
where Ms Maxwell is being detained pre-trial on charges relating to her alleged role in
sexual activities involving Jeffrey Epstein from 1994 to 1997.

2. Ina previous opinion, I have outlined why French authorities could decide to execute
an extradition request against a French citizen under the Extradition Treaty between the
USA and France, without violating any superior norm of French and international law.

3. AsIunderstand the defendant’s French nationality continues to be regarded by the Court
as a bar to her release pending trial, I am informed that the defendant is prepared to
renounce French nationality under Article 23-4 of the French Civil Code, if the Court
so requires.

4. Ina letter to the Department of Justice dated 9 March 2021, the Head of the International
Criminal Assistance Bureau of the French Ministry of Justice, Mr Philippe Jaeglé,
asserts that the loss of French nationality after the criminal act which the person is
alleged to have committed does not affect the rule against the extradition of nationals,
as nationality must be assessed at the time of commission of the offence and not at the
time of the extradition request.

5. This report was written to provide a counter opinion on this issue, in support of the
proposition that the French government would be legally entitled to execute an
extradition request against an individual who is no longer a French national.

6. The Ministry of Justice’s assertion must be regarded as incorrect for three reasons:

(1) It is not supported by the letter of the law;
