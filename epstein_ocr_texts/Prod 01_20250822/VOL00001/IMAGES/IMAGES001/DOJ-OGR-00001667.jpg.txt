protective order: should she be able i to ‘identify, ‘a. ‘particularized t need t to publicly n name > victims: who
have'not yet identified themselves on. the record in, this casc—=as, opposed to redacting their names
from court filings, or referring to’them.in an anonymized fashion. As noted; to date, defense
counsel has declined. to identify. to the: Court orto. the Government any example of why doing:so
would. be:nccessary.or helpful to the defense, or.even-under what circumstances the defense might
want to do so.

The defendant’s proposal iis also extraordinarily broad, and without any temporal orsubject

that any’ individual who has ever'self-identified.as a victim.of Jeffrey: Epstein.or Ghislaine Maxwell.

in, conncetion. with-this case. This would include, as hypothetical examples, someone who spoke
to a journalist ‘for a local story in.1997, or posted on a MySpace page followed by a handful of
friends in.2005, or made.a statement’ on a,small:podcast in.2009, or posted. on Twitter to a handful,
‘of followers in 2013. ‘But none of: these.cxamples of ventures into the “public fora” can possibly’
be construed as efforts by: hypothetical victims: to consent: or choose “to self-identify,” Def. Ltr,
at 3, in a. future criminal case against Ghislaine Maxwell, subject to extraordinary public attention,
and. scrutiny:

Additionally, while some: :individuals. have identified. themselves as victims without.
providing any details or additional information, about their abuse, the defense contemplates no
limitation of;publicly associating those individuals with the details of their abuse in public defense:
statements or filings. In essence, the defendant’s ‘proposal ‘sccks authorization. to drag ‘into: the
publie glare any victim who. has ever made any typeof public Statement of ‘victimization—no
matter how long ago or how bricf—without that.-victim’s: knowing consent ‘and without any.
substantive justification. That is particularly troubling, given. thatthe Government expects to.make
productions of discovery and. 3500 materials well. surpassing ‘its obligations. Those productions
will necessarily include the identities of individuals whom the Government: docs ‘not expect'to, call
as ‘witnesses, and whose accounts—much léss identitics—will have no bearing on this case. But
the defendant’s: proposal would allow her and her. counsel to publicly name them ‘in any’ public:
statement or filing at their sole discretion. This is plainly unnecessary for any investigative steps
or trial preparation, would be grossly inappropriate and-unfair, and would be inconsistent with the
Crime Victims’ Rights Act.

Conversely, the Government’s: submission proposes that the defendant and her counsel not
be: precluded from discussing publicly individuals who identify themselves on the record. in. this
criminal, prosecution, because any’ such. individuals ‘will, have made a.conscious. and informed.
choice to be associated publicly with this case. See Government Proposed Order 44 5,6, 8: The
identity of ‘any other individuals should be protected from public broadcast by the defendant and,
her counsel.

The defendant argues that her proposed language is “nearly identical, ‘in, all ‘material

respects,” to the ‘protective, order entered. in United States'v. Epsiein, 19'Cr. 490:(RMB) (Dkt. 38).
