Setting aside whether the defendant’s spouse has additional assets beyond those included in the:
financial report; the vast majority:of the assets contained in the report itself apparently originated!
with the.defendant. (See’Def. Ex. O at 10). ‘Based on. the report, it seems clear that the defendant
slowly funneled the majority-of her wealth to trusts and into her husband’s name over the last five
years. As.a result, if the Court were to grant the defendant’s proposed bail package and the
defendant were to flee, her spouse would primarily lose the money that the defendant gave him
rather than his own' independent assets.. In other: words, were the defendant to flee, she would!
largely be sacrificing her own money and assets, thereby limiting the moral suasion ofther spouse
co-signing the bond. In sum, the defendant’s: submission does not change the Government’s

this is not one: of the rare cases. which a private security company could conceivably be
considered as.a bail condition. See United States v.. Boustani, 932 F.3d 79, 82 (2d. Cir. 2019). The

are released to self-funded private jails,” and that “a defendant may be released on sacha condition

The.
‘Court need not resolve this question, however, becatse regardless of whether the defendant’s
husband may have additiosial, undisclosed assets, as discussed herein, the key: takeaway from the
financial report is that the vast majority of the spouse’s reported assets, upon which the proposed!
bond is based, originated with the defendant, meaning he would not be losing ‘his own money if
the.defendant fled:
