Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 26 of 74 26

1 head of the first assistant, Mr. Sloman.

2 THE COURT: In New York.

3 MR. WEINBERG: Right. In the Southern district, there
4 were six or seven prosecutors, including New York City

5 prosecutors, in what was either the largest or second largest

6 U.S. Attorney's Office. I don't know how the manpower compares
7 to the Southern District of New York.

8 This was well thought through. Again, it was with

9 consultation of the Department of Justice before September 24
10 and then again after where the government continued to

11 investigate.

12 THE COURT: Is Mr. Filip the highest level official in
13 the Department of Justice?

14 MR. WEINBERG: Yes. He was just one step below the

15 Attorney General.

16 THE COURT: He was Deputy Attorney General?

17 MR. WEINBERG: Deputy Attorney General.

18 In May or June of 2008, he approved the discretion to
19 enter the NPA and to essentially endorse the decision and

21 this case because we were contesting whether or not this was a
22 case that warranted the weight of the federal government which
23 required Mr. Epstein to go to the state which had returned an
24 indictment for solicitation and actually urged the state of
25 Florida to bring a second charge that would subject Mr. Epstein
