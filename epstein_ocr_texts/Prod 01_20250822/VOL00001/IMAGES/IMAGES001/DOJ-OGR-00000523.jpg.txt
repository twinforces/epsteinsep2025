associated with the defendant confirming that the defendant

represented his ‘net. worth as more than $500 million.

account. at. that financial institution totaling more than $110

million.

There can be no dispute whatsoever that this defendant.

has vast assets and every incentive in the ‘world to usé those

assets to flee from justice.

Your Honor, the government. seeking detention in this

case is net. unusual. Defendants are routinely detained in this

dist®ict when facing’ such charges, and this defendant’ should bé

resources to flee prosecution enly makes the case for his
detention stronger.

and getting Strongér every single day.

Many individuals identifying themselves as victims and

witnesses have contacted the government, and we are in ‘the

process of receiving and corroborating this ddditional
evidence:
