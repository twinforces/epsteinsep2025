Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document97 Filed 12/14/20: Page 35 of 45

Mr. Julié opines that the French entity with, jurisdiction, over the legality of extradition
requests would:not oppose Ms. Maxwell’s extradition on the ground that;she is a.French citizen,
and that it is “highly unlikely that the French government would.refuse to issue: and execute an
extradition decree” against her. (/d. at 2). Mr. Julié bases his opinion largely on (i) Ms.
Maxwell’s U.S. citizenship; (ii): her irrevocable waiver of her extradition.rights with respect to
the United States; (iii) the:fact that the issue would arise only if Ms. Maxwell. had fled to France
in:violation. of strict bail conditions in the United States; (iv), the fact that a failure to extradite
would-obligaté French authorities to 'try Ms. Maxwell. in Frérich courts for the same 25-year-old
conduct:alleged in-the indictment, which. did not:take place in. France; and (v).France’s
diplomatic. interest: in’ accommodating an, extradition request fromthe United, States. (/d.). Mr.
Julié adds:that the. extradition. process: would likely be “disposed of expediently”; where the
requesting state emphasizes the urgent nature of the extradition, request, “the extradition, decree is
generally issued in, only a few'weeks.” (/d. at'2=3). And in any event, while the extradition,
proceedings are pending, “the French judicial. authorities would most.certainly decide:that [Ms.
Maxwell] has to remain in. custody given her flight fromthe USA. and the violation.of her bail.
ters, and conditions in this requesting State.” (/d. at 12).

Ms. Maxwell has no intention.of fleeing the country: and-has relinquished her-rights to
contest.extradition. She has always maintained her innocence and ‘will. continue to fight- the.
allegations against her here in:the United States, as she has. in the past. Even. if she. were to flee.
after being: granted bail, (which she will not), itis likely that. Ms. Maxwell:would be extradited
expeditiously from France or‘the United Kingdom. Accordingly, the Court should give'no

weight in the bail analysis to the fact:that-Ms. Maxwell is a.dual citizen of these countries.”

*Ms. Maxwell. would also have:very little incentive to flee to France. According*to recent press reports, French
authoritics-recently‘broadened ‘their‘existing criminal investigation into Jeffrey’Epstein.tocinclude Ms. Maxwell. See
