Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document6 Filed 07/11/19 Page:8 of 16

The NPA required Mr. Epstcin to plead guilty to a state felony charge (Fla. Stat.
§ 796.07), then:perding in. the State of Florida and to.an additional state felony charge (not’
previously: charged or: required bythe State) of'violating Fla. Stat. § 796.03 (Case.No. 2008-CF-
9381 AXX), a charge requiring registration. as a. scx. offender. Mr. Epstein. complied with all. of
his obligations under the NPA.

Contrary to the governmient*s argument, the NPA was not limited to a “list of several
dozen:victims, identified in-the prior ifivestigation ... 2’ ‘Gov't Bail Letter at 6-7. Indcéd, the
NPA contains no “list of several.dozen victims” and regardless, the NPA immunized. Mr. ‘Epstein
from prosecution, “for the offenses set out'on pages |, and 2. ofthis Agreement,” allegedly .
committed, between, 200.1-07, as well as.“any offenses that.arose from, the Federal ‘Grand.Jury
investigation, ” NPA at 2 (cmphasis ane) Moreover, the g government’ S interpretation. that. the
Office or. District”: ‘will be the subject ofa major dispute | in this case. “This i 1s s especially. so
because’Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct at his Palm, Beach residence features prominently inthe
conspiracy count (Count 1, 4414-19, 4 22.a, d, f) and is incorporated by reference in the
substantive charge (Count 2, 4 23).

Beyond that,.Mr. Epstein. intends to raise and litigate significant.duc process issues about
the Department of Justice’ S conduct i in this casc. Namely, there i 1s. irrefutable, evidence from the
complied with his Obligations under the NPA, the’ USAO- SDFL affirmatively ‘encouraged
alleged victims to pursue prosccution of Mr. Epstein in. other districts, in violation of the DOJ’s
commitment to.a “global” resolution. S¢é Exhibit 2, at 8-12. The United States Attorncy ‘for the
Southern District of Florida, along with supervisory: and line prosccutors from the USAO-SDEL,
corresponded:on multiple: occasions ‘with, and personally: conferred:with, alleged victims and
their lawyers to entertain discussions about: the alleged victims’ desire’ to have Mr. Epstein,
prosecuted. on federal charges. S¢e id. at.9. Further; the Southern District: of New York's likely’
relying upon-physical evidence scized in.connéction with the prior investigation, séc Gov’t Bail
Letter at 6 (discussing “corroborating evidence,” including “contemporancous notes, messages:. .

, and call.records”). In:short, there will be evidence:that the current New York. case is not truly
independent of the prior immunized. conduct. The evidence will show that Mr. Epstein’s |
reasonable expectation that the NPA would “resolve globally [Mr. Epstcin’s] state and ‘federal
criminal. liability” :in €xchange for Mr. Epstein’s compliance with. the duties and. obligations in
the NPA.— which he fully performed — has been unconstitutionally undermined by the
governments efforts to:minimize the potential consequences of a CVRA conferral violation (one:
that neither the government, nor defense believes occurred. but that was found.to have occurred. in
the CVRA litigation, which ‘is pending a decision.on remedies) by returning an inextricably’
intertwined second federal prosecution just.as the District. Court:in Florida. is ‘receiving.
submissions:on remedy.
