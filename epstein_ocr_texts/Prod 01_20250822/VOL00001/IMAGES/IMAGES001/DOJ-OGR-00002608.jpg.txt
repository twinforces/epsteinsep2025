executive summary does not discuss the co-conspirator immunity provision. It has been reported
in the media, however, that the full OPR report states that the Assistant United States Attorney
who negotiated the deal recalled Epstein’s counsel telling her that Epstein’s intent was “to make
sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened.” Hill, J. “Key Takeaways
from the Justice Department review of Jeffrey Epstein sweetheart deal.” ABC News. Nov. 16,
2020 (https://abcnews.go.com/US/key-takeaways-justice-department-review-jeffrey-epstein-
sweetheart/story?id=74222922). If the reporting is accurate, the OPR report suggests that the
government understood Epstein’s desire to protect his potential co-conspirators to the maximum
extent possible, and that the government articulated no objection—i.e., that there was no intent to
limit the scope of the co-conspirator immunity provision. The accuracy of this account, as well
as other information about the plea negotiations and the parties’ intent, can be confirmed through
discovery.
