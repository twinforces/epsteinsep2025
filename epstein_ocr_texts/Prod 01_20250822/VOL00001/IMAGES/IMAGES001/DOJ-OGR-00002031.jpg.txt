| | has called the United States her home for almost 30 years. She has deep affective
family ties here in this country Most of all, her
own husband are here. During the past 18 months in particular Ghislaine has
gone out of her way to continue to stay in the United States expressly so that she could put
her case forward in a court of law should it ever come to that. I therefore feel great
consternation and deep shock and sadness when I hear about the conditions of her present
incarceration, which include over 150 days of solitary confinement and other extreme
deprivations and restrictions. The great toll that this physical, mental, and emotional stress is
taking on ii makes it even more impossible for her to adequately prepare her defence
from inside jail.
If she is granted bail, I will be in continuous touch with her during the weeks and months
leading up to her trial, providing whatever support I can while she has the chance to fairly
prepare for her upcoming trial and fight for her innocence.
I am grateful for the opportunity to provide this statement.
Sincerely,
