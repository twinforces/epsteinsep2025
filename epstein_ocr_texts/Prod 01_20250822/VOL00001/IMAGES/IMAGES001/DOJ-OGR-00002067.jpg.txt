Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97-15 Filed 12/14/20 Page 7 of 10

20. We have reviewed available accounts and filings of Terramar Project Inc, a 501C
charitable corporation in the United States, and the available accounts and filings of
Terramar UK, a charity registered in the United Kingdom. Both charities were
established by Ghislaine Maxwell who sat on the respective boards of each. The
objects of the charity are to promote for the public benefit: a) the conservation,
protection and improvement of the environment, and in particular the environment of
the oceans, seas, coastlines and tidal areas b) the conservation and protection of
endangered marine flora and fauna c) the education of the public in the fields of
marine conservation, marine ecology and related areas.

21. Terramar Project Inc was founded in 2012 and Terramar UK was formed in 2014.
Both organizations ceased operations in 2019 and were dissolved as corporations and
charities in 2019/2020. During this period of time, Ghislaine Maxwell contributed
US$560,650 to the running costs of Terramar Project and approximately $10,000 to
Terramar UK.

22. We have identified one donation outside of the time period of this report from
Epstein Interests Foundation of US$57,000 which was recorded as a donation to
Terramar Project Inc in the financial year ending 1/21/2013.° All funds received by
Terramar Project Inc were disbursed for the charitable purposes of Terramar Project
Inc. No personal, financial benefit was obtained by Ghislaine Maxwell.
