63. The wording: of these: international agreements, which. do not contain a. prohibition, on
the-extradition of-nationals, raises Some important questions. In particular, could France

violating applicable international law, European Jaw, or, French, constitutional law?

64. In order to deterinine: whéther the Frerich government may; grant .an. extradition request
relating to a French. citizen’under'the Extradition. Treaty between Erance and,the USA, it
is thus:necessary: to evaluate the strength and ‘status of the:prohibition of, the ‘extradition
of nationals under (i) applicable international law, (ii) European. law, and (ili) ‘French

constitutional law.
(i) = dInternational law

65. As outlined, international treaties. pertaining to. extradition generally: leave: Contracting
Statés a right fot to extradite their nationals, and. State: practice largely’ varies in this
regard. Some States are'strongly committed to'the rule against the extradition of nationals
and, have conferred the: ‘principle constitutional ‘status (Germany, Poland, Greece,
Portugal, Estonia, Austria). Others have.codified the-principle:in their national 'Iegislation
(Franee, Lebanon, Chili, Qatar, Slovenia). By contrast, many: States - in. particular,
Common law jurisdictions, including ‘the United. Kingdom, Australia, and the USA,

extradite their own, citizens.

66. Thus, there is no: uniform rule regarding the: extradition of nationals under. international

law.
(ii) European law

67. European law-does.not prohibit-the extradition.of:nationals cither. As mentioned, Article
6.of'the Européan. Convention on Extradition 1957 provides States. with a discretionary

right on’whether or‘not to extradite their own citizens.

68. More interestingly, the European Arrest Warrant:Framework Decision.of 13 June 2002
(hereafter, “EAW FD”), which. governs extradition. matters between Member States of
the European Union, does not allow Member States the-possibility to refuse the surrender
of their nationals when, the EA'W ‘is issued. for the purpose of conducting ‘a. criminal
prosecution. In fact, the:surrender of anational, who is the subject of criminal;procecdings

in another Member State.of the European Union-is atthe cornerstone of the EAW FD.
