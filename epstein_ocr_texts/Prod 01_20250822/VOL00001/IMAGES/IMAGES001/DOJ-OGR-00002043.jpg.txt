Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97-7 Filed 12/14/20 Page 3 of 3
have personally seen in many settings over the years, sometimes with
young children nd Ghislaine has always
behaved totally appropriately. In my eyes she Is a totally trustworthy individual and |
would have no hesitation at any time leaving children or young adults in her care.
Regarding the extremely serious charges she is now facing, Ghislaine has
repeatedly denied any knowledge of, or involvement in, any such improper and
criminal conduct. Based on my knowing her very ae the
nature of her character | believe in her innocence an ave no doubt that she will
deal with all the allegations head on and will attend trial for the opportunity it provides
her finally to put her side of the story without it being intermediated by an
overwhelmingly hostile media.

I
have no doubt will not shirk the responsibility she has to
attend her trial in this matter and will fight the case through to the finish to clear her
cc
her as | do, for Ghislaine too there is simply no other option
Respectfully,
