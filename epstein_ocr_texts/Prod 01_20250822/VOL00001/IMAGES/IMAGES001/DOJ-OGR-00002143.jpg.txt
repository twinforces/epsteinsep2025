57. If extradition. is refused solely-on-the basis of the:nationality of the-person sought, Article
3(2) requires. the requested, State to submit thé case to its authorities: for-prosecution, if

so ‘requested by the ‘requesting State.

58. Consequently; the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA does not
contain any prohibition. on the extradition of nationals. Instead, it:increly states that
there, is no obligation;upon' the requested State to: grant the extradition of a person; who

is one of its nationals.

‘59. The Extradition Treaty between. Franec.and the; USA, must therefore be.:distinguished
from. several :international. agreerents on extradition :ratificd by Fraricc, which, by.

contrast, contain a clear rule. against;the extradition of. French citizens?”

60. For cxample,,‘France has :made the following declaration pursuant. to Article 6 of the
European. Convention. on Extradition 1957, which gives Gontracting States “the rightto

refiise extradition, of nationals”:

“Extradition shall be refused when the person.sought.had French nationality-at the time

353
of the. alleged: offence” -

61. Therefore, France does not surrender French citizens under the European Convention on

Extradition”.

62. The Extradition Treaty between France and, the USA. ‘is; similar. to other ‘international
agreements signed by France which also do not contain a prohibition against ‘the
extradition of ‘nationals. These are generally treatics signed. with, Common law

jurisdictions,which, do not oppose the. extradition, of their nationals**

*"-See, ‘for example, the Extradition treaty: befween.France and Morocco, or'the:Exiradilion treaty, between Erance
*l See France’s. instrument of:ratification,of the-European, Convention on_Extradition; deposited on 10 February,
‘| 1986.

Paris 0 on. ) December 3h ‘1957, and. came into force ' on. April ‘ish 1960. ‘The Furopean Conveniion on n Extradition
is open ‘to s gnature by: ‘non-Couneil of Europe States. as: such, it was ratified ' by’ South Africa. Israel, and, the
Republic of: ‘Korea. It wag-ratified by France on February 1.0", 1986.

For example, the. Extradition. Treaty bewween France and Cc ‘anada, Signed in Ottawa On. T7 November 1988,
contains a/similar-provision. to. the United States Treaty: “The' requested State shall not! be’ bound:to’ extradite ‘its
