57. If extradition is refused solely on the basis of the nationality of the person sought, Article
3(2) requires the requested State to submit the case to its authorities for prosecution, if
so requested by the requesting State.

58. Consequently, the Extradition Treaty between France and the USA does not
contain any prohibition on the extradition of nationals. Instead, it merely states that
there is no obligation upon the requested State to grant the extradition of a person who
is one of its nationals.

59. The Extradition Treaty between France and the USA must therefore be distinguished
from several international agreements on extradition ratified by France, which, by
contrast, contain a clear rule against the extradition of French citizens*?.

60. For example, France has made the following declaration pursuant to Article 6 of the
European Convention on Extradition 1957, which gives Contracting States “the right to
refuse extradition of nationals”:

“Extradition shall be refused when the person sought had French nationality at the time
of the alleged offence’.

61. Therefore, France does not surrender French citizens under the European Convention on
Extradition”.

62. The Extradition Treaty between France and the USA is similar to other international
agreements signed by France which also do not contain a prohibition against the
extradition of nationals. These are generally treaties signed with Common law
jurisdictions, which do not oppose the extradition of their nationals*’.

3° See, for example, the Extradition treaty between France and Morocco, or the Extradition treaty between France
and China.
3! See France’s instrument of ratification of the European Convention on Extradition, deposited on 10 February
1986.
32 The European Convention on Extradition 1957 is an instrument of the Council of Europe which was signed in
Paris on December 13, 1957 and came into force on April 18", 1960. The European Convention on Extradition
is open to signature by non-Council of Europe States, as such it was ratified by South Africa, Israel, and the
Republic of Korea. It was ratified by France on February 10", 1986.
33 For example, the Extradition Treaty between France and Canada, signed in Ottawa on 17 November 1988,
contains a similar provision to the United States Treaty: “The requested State shall not be bound to extradite its
own nationals. Nationality shall be determined as of the date of the offence for which extradition is requested”
(Article 3).
