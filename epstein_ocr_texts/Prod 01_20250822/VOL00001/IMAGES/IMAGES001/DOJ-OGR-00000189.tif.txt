K. The USAO Rejects Defense Efforts to
Eliminate the Sexual Offender Registration
Requirement

On the afternoon of Friday, September 21, 2007,
State Attorney Krischer informed Villafafia that
Epstein’s counsel had contacted him and Epstein was
ready to agree “to all the terms” of the NPA—except
for sexual offender registration. According to Krischer,
defense counsel had proposed that registration be
deferred, and that Epstein register only if state or
federal law enforcement felt, at any point during his
service of the sentence, that he needed to do so.
Krischer noted that he had “reached out” to Acosta
about this proposal but had not heard back from him.
Villafafia responded, “I think Alex is calling you now.”
Villafana told OPR that, to her knowledge, Acosta
called Krischer to tell him that registration was not a
negotiable term.!”°

Later that afternoon, Villafafia emailed Krischer for
information about the amount of “gain time” Epstein
would earn in state prison. Villafafia explained in her
email that she wanted to include a provision in the
NPA specifying that Epstein “will actually be in jail at
least a certain number of days to make sure he doesn’t
try to ‘convince’ someone with the Florida prison

"6 Krischer told OPR that he did not recall meeting or having
interactions with Acosta regarding the Epstein case or any other
matter.
