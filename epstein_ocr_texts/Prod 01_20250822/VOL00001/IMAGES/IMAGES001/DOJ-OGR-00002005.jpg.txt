of release); United States v. Salvagno, 314 F. Supp. 2d 115, 119 (N.D.N.Y. 2004) (ordering each
of two defendants to “execute and file with the Clerk of the Court a waiver of extradition
applicable to any nation or foreign territory in which he may be found as a condition of his
continued release”); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129, 132-33 (D.D.C. 2004)
(requiring Israeli citizen who lived in South Africa and had “no ties to the United States” to sign
waiver of rights not to be extradited under Israeli and South African extradition treaties with
United States); United States v. Chen, 820 F. Supp. 1205, 1212 (N.D. Cal. 1992) (ordering as a
condition of release that defendants “execute waivers of challenges to extradition from any
nation where they may be found”). Moreover, a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an
extradition order has been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee. See,
e.g., United States v. Khashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 1052 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (Judge Keenan found
defendant’s extradition appeal waiver “manifests an intention to remain here and face the
charges against him”).

In response to the government’s assertions, Ms. Maxwell has obtained the accompanying
reports of experts in United Kingdom and French extradition law, who have analyzed the
likelihood that Ms. Maxwell, in the event she were to flee to the United Kingdom or France,
would be able to resist extradition to the United States after having executed a waiver of her right
to do so. Both have concluded that it is highly unlikely that she would be able to resist
extradition successfully.
