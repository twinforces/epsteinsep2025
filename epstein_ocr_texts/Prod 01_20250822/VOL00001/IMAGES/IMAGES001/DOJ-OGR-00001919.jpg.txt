THE COURT: Thank, you, MS. Moé.

Mr. Cohen, you may proceed.

MR. COHEN: Thank. ‘you, your Honor. Thank, you, very
much for the opportunity to be heard and also for accommodating
Us with, regard to the briefing schedule. We appreciate that,
your Honor’.

Your Honor, this, is a very important procéeding for ‘my
elient. It is critical and. we submit, as. we laid out in our
papers, that under the Bail Reform Act and related case law;

none of which, by the way, was discussed in the government's

presentation, she is == she ought to be released 6n a bail
package with strict conditions, your Honor.

And, frankly, in order to defend a case like this
during the COVED crisis, with the extent of discovery which was
discussed éarlieér ih the proceeding, that's going to take the
government. until November ‘to ‘produce to us, the notion, of
preparing a défense with dour Client while she is ain custody
under these conditions its just mot realistic.

I would also liké to take a moment, your Honér, to
address a few things. As we noted in our papers, our client, is
not Jéeffréy Epstein, and she Has been the target 6f éssentially

endless media spin, that apparently the government. has picked up

in, its reply brief and in its presentation, today; trying to

portray her before the court as a ruthless, aimless, sinister

person.
