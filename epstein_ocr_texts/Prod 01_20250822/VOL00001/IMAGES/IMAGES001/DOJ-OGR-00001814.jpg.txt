recent New York investigation as part of the Prosecution Team’s files, and stated as much at the
initial pretrial conference and in its October 7, 2020 letter. Because the Palm Beach Police
Department files were incorporated into the Florida FBI files and were so at the time of charging,
they are also part of the Prosecution Team’s files. Thus, far from trying to “distance itself from
its own files” (Def. Ltr. 5), the Government has thoroughly reviewed those files for Rule 16
material and potential Brady material, has made discovery productions from those files beginning
in August through this month, and is continuing to make productions from those files.

By contrast, and as explained more fully in the Government’s October 7 letter, this
Prosecution Team—which played no role in the Florida Investigation—had not, prior to August
2020, received the materials identified in that letter from other prosecutor’s offices. The
Government has now obtained those materials not because they constitute Rule 16 discovery, but
rather because the Government is prepared to go above and beyond its obligations in an effort to
identify any arguable 3500 or Giglio material for Government witnesses in this case, or any Brady
material held in the files of those other offices. The Government is in the process of reviewing
those materials, as set forth in its October 7 letter, and to the extent the Government identifies
material within those files that constitutes Giglio or Jencks Act material, it will produce any such
material in advance of trial consistent with any agreed upon or ordered schedule for pretrial
disclosures. If the Government identifies potential Brady material within those files, the
Government will promptly produce it to the defense.

In sum, through its October 7 letter, the Government sought to be transparent about the
files it has been collecting and reviewing from other offices for disclosures in this case. The
Government fully intends to discharge its obligations carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly, and
will continue to make itself available to confer with defense counsel regarding discovery.

2. The Government Has Made Considerable Efforts to Address Concerns and

Complaints Raised by Defense Counsel Regarding the MDC

The Defense Letter raises two complaints that the Government has gone to significant
lengths to address over the past several weeks. First, the defense complains about technical issues
the defendant has experienced in reviewing discovery at the MDC. (Def. Ltr. 6-7). The
Government has worked expeditiously and continuously to provide the defendant with discovery
that is reviewable at MDC. In that vein, the Government has repeatedly spoken with MDC legal
counsel regarding these issues, and is continuing to work with MDC legal counsel and its own IT
staff to ensure that the defendant is able to review all of her discovery, including the subset of files

4 The suggestion to the contrary in the first sentence of the Defense Letter is similarly
misleading. (Def. Ltr. 1). At the initial conference, the Government explained that discovery in
this case would come, in part, from “prior investigative files from another investigation in the
Southern District of Florida,” (July 14, 2020 Tr. at 12), and Government counsel clarified, “the
files in particular that I am referring to are the files in the possession of the F.B.I. in Florida in
connection with the previous investigation of Jeffrey Epstein.” (/d. at 14). Consistent with that
representation, the Government’s October 7, 2020 letter noted that the Prosecution Team has
reviewed and made discovery productions from those same Florida FBI files. (Dkt. 63 at 5, 6).
