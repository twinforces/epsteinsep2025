THE COURT: THanks very ‘much.

MS, GIBBS: One more. Statement of Jane Doe 8.

In the past few weeks, TI have had to reflect on my
interaction with Jeffrey Epstein and realized that, though IL
have yet! to put it all behind me, I dam still a victim. TI say
this because I have to come to terms with it in an effort to
truly get past. the abuse I suffered at thé hands of Epstein.

Pursuing criminal penalties against him and having an
opportunity to address the egrégious crimes he committed
against me and other young woman would have helped my recovery
process; This all came to an abrupt Halt. when he took his own

life. This point of disclosure is Jost.

I cannot. say that I am pleased he committed suicide,
but I, am at peace knowing he will mot be able to hurt. anyone
else. However, a sad truth remains. I, along with other
people, will never fave an, answer as to why. I will never have
an apélogy for the wrdéngdéing. And mést importantly, Epstein
will not be justly sentenced for his crimes. Now I sat in, my

home questioning the well=being of thdse girls like myself. In

choesang death, Epstein denied everyone justice.

Any efforts made to protect Epstein's tame and legacy,
send a message to the victims that he wins and that he is
untouchable. I understand his case may be dismissed or closed,
but this makes me feel as though I, and anyone else who fell
pry to his hands; simply do not matter.
