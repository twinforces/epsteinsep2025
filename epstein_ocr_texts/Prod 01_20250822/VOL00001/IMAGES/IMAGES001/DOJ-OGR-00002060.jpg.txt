Ghislaine Maxwell

Your Honor,

_ has been a friend of mine for over 25 —
Ghislaine, without judgment or prejudice, offered me a roof over my head Po
HE free of charge or bill payments until I could get back on my feet so to speak. I had
nothing to give her and she had nothing to gain from me living there. Given those
circumstances I think it says a great deal about Ghislaine’s moral character: in particular her
loyalty and kindness towards someone who could offer her nothing in return. When another
friend subsequently offered to pay rent for me this was still at a substantially lower than
market rate.
I want to conclude by saying that never in my wildest dreams do I think Ghislaine could be
guilty of the terrible charges against. Like anyone charged with any crime, she is innocent
unless proven guilty and has a right to due process and humane treatment and should be
treated accordingly.
Yours respectfully,

DOJ-OGR-00002060
