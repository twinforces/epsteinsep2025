B. Systematic Exclusion

Apart from the second Duren element, Schulte’s fair cross-section challenge must also
fail because he cannot meet the third elemefit? systematic.cxclusion, which requires a. showing
that the “undérrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection.
process.” Duren,.439 U.S. at 364.

In Rioux,. the Second Circuit explained.that:there is “systematic exclusion when the
underrepresentation is due tothe: system. of jury selection itself, rather than. external forces.” 97
F.3d at 658. Under the external forces:principle, outside causes of underrepresentation (such as
“demographic changes.) do not constitute systematic exclusion. Id.; see; é.g., Schanbarger v.
Macy, 77 F.3d 1424 (2d Cir. 1996) (per curiam) Gury selection: process “drawn from voter
fepistration lists” did not constitute systematic exclusion); United States v. Little Bear, 583 F.2d
211, 414-15 (8th Cir, 1978) (“inclement weather” in-North Dakota that allegedly led'to the
‘underrepresentation. of rural jurors was not systematic.exclusion);, United States v. Jones, 2006
"WL 278248, at *3 (E.D. La: Feb. 3, 2006) (Hurricane: Katrina’s alleged disparate impact on,
potential African-American jurors was notisystematic exclusion). The lion’s share of Schulte’s
systematic exclusion allegations is foreclosed by this principle.

First, Schulte.contends that the Government systematically excluded African American:
and Hispanic American jurors by seeking the Indictment in White Plains it lieu of the more

racially diverse Manhattan community.. (Schulte Br. at 2.) But the reason, the Government:

venire, the-absolute disparities would be: 3.69% and 3.64%, (See Gov't Opp. Br. at’ 20.) Those
statistics do not reflect‘ Constitutional ‘infirmities under: Second:Circuit:teachings.
