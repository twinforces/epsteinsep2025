offenses at issue: will be “instituted in this District.” "NPA. at 2 (emphases added). In addition,
the use of the term “the United States” in the co-conspirator'immunity provision.contrasts with
the use elsewhere in the agreement of various terms that refer-more specifically‘to the USAO-
SDFL. When the government wanted.a provision of the NPA to refer only to the USAO-SDFL,
it knew how to do so; where it: chosé not to do.so, a different intent is demonstrated.

Indeed, the omission -of express language: limiting the co-conspirator immunity: provision.
to the SDFL-was contrary. to Justice Department policy.. The Justice Manual (formerly. the U.S.
Attorneys’ Manual) expressly provides, and -provided.at.the time the NPA ‘was executed, that “if
practicable, the attorney for the government should. explicitly limit the scope of his/her [non-
prosecution] agreement to. non-prosecution within, his/her district.” Justice Manual, Comment to
§ 9-27.630. The government’s deviation from.a policy of which it was obviously:aware—for
offenses that, by: their nature, involve interstate travel and are susceptible to prosecution. in
multiple: districts—cannot be regarded as an oversight; ‘particularly where: the, policy was
followed elsewhere in the NPA with respect to the immunity provision as to Epstein.

2. United States v. Annabi does not alter the analysis.

In. support of its position, the government has cited United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d.670
(2d Cir. 1985). ‘Reply Mem. at 5. But.Annabi docs not support the government’s position. In
fact, to, the extent it is relevant.here, it: supports dismissal.

In Annabi, the government, following a guilty:plea to one:count of'a three-count
indictment. in the Eastern ‘District: of New York, agreed to move to dismiss the two open. counts.
Unlike here, there’was no written agrécment;: rather, the prosecutor stated on the record at the
time of the plea that:“‘the only. agreement that exists between the defendants and.the: Government
ds that at the time of the imposition of sentence on, Count: Two, the Government would,move to

dismiss the two open remaining counts as to cach defendant.” '771..F.2d at 671. The defendants
