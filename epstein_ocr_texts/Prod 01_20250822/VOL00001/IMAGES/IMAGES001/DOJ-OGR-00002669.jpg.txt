Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 144 Filed 02/04/21 Page 21.0f 25

Such a “necessarily entails” or “elements of the offense” approach is particularly
appropriate for three additional. reasons here.. First, like the Wartime Suspension. Act in. Bridges,
§ 3283 creates an “exception” to the general five-year limitations period of § 3282, and such
exceptions should’be “narrowly construed.” Bridges, 346 U.S. at 215-16 (citing United States v-
MceéElvain,.272 U.S. 633, 639 (1926)); seé also Comm’? v. Clark, 489. U.S. 726, 739. (1989) (we.
usually read the exception narrowly-in. order‘to preserve: the primary operation.of the provision,”
particularly'‘when the exception is “somewhat ambrguous”). Second, § 3282 itselfrequires that
any exception to the five-year rule be “expressly-provided bylaw.” 18°U.S.C. § 3282 (cmphasis
added). Nowhere does § 3283 “expressly” purport to ‘cover offenses that could (but need not) be
‘proved by facts involving sexual or physical abuse of a:minor: And third, under, the rule of
lenity, ambiguitywith respect to criminal statutes should be construed in :favor of the defendant.
508, 523 (2d.Cir. 2015) (where, as: here, the Government and ‘the defense both posit:plausible:
interpretations ofa criminal statute, the rule of lenity requires us to adopt-the defendant's
construction”). To do otherwise: would violate the “longstanding congressional ‘policy of
repose? that is fundamental.to our socicty and our criminal law.” See.Bridges, 346 U-S. at 215-
16; see also Toussie, 397 U.S. at 115 (“criminal limitations statutes are tobe liberally interpreted
in, favor-of repose” (internal. quotation omitted)). s

B. The offenses charged.:in Counts One.through Four do not necessarily entail

the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a child.

Under the “necessarily’entails” approach, § 3283 docs not.apply: None of the charged

counts “necessarily” entails “the sexual or physical. abuse, or kidnaping, of a child.” See. 18:

* Nor‘has the: Second Circuit held otherwise. In Weingarten, because’the issue arose inthe context of an ineffective:
assistance of counscl claim, the court concluded only-that:it' was “not:obvious™ that: $3283 required an clements-
based-approach. Weingarten, 865 °1:.3d at:53;, 58-59.
