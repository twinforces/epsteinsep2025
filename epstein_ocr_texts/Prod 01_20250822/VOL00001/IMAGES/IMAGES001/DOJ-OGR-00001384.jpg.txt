Case 21-770, Document 57, 04/19/2021, 3080288, Page12 of 30
Gov tEx. (April 6, 2021 letter, n.2). But as Ms. Maxwell explained, the
Government’s narrative is total fiction — the unsanitary conditions are
caused by other inmates and guards, not Ms. Maxwell.

9. The Government also makes much of Ms. Maxwell’s
vaccination. Again this demonstrates a gross double standard. Imagine
if the defense had publicly filed medical information about the accusers.
There would be hell to pay. The Government insists on secrecy and
redactions when discussing their witnesses, and will not even reveal their
names. Yet it freely discloses private information in violation of HIPAA
about Ms. Maxwell in public filings.

In any event, whether Ms. Maxwell is vaccinated or not does not
help her search documents on an ancient computer or give her access to
a printer or allow her to meet with her lawyers (who would still need to
come into the jail and interact with numerous other prisoners and guards
who have not been vaccinated). Ms. Maxwell’s bail motion is not based on
her risk of contracting COVID. Her vaccination status is irrelevant.
