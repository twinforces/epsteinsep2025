phrase “offense involving” particular conduct refers to an offense whose elements necessarily

Counts One through Four of the indictment allege that Ms. Maxwell violated and

criminal offense” in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Indictment §] 15-16. Count Four charges
Ms. Maxwell with a substantive § 2423(a) violation, claiming she “arranged for Minor Victim-1

' Prior to February 8, 1996, the provision at issue constituted the entirety of § 2422; it became § 2422(a) as a result
of the enactment of additional subsections as of that date. Telecommunications Act of 1996, PL 104-104, Feb. 8,
1996, Title V, § 508, 110 Stat. 56. Thus, the provision is referred to herein as § 2422(a).
