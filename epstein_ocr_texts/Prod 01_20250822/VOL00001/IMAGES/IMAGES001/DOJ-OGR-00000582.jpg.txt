Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36 Filed 07/24/19 Page 72 of 74 72

1 MS. FARMER: Hello, your Honor.

2 THE COURT: Could you help us out and spell your first
3 and last name.

4 MS. FARMER: Yes. Annie Farmer, A-n-n-i-e

5 F-a-r-m-e-r.

6 I was 16 years old when I had the misfortune of

7 meeting Jeffrey Epstein here in New York. He later flew me to
8 New Mexico to spend time with him there.

9 I wanted to voice my support for the government's

10 request that his bail not be set and also just my reaction to
11 the fact that the defense was claiming that it would be perhaps
12 easier for victims or more likely for victims to come forward
13 given the publicity and some of the other issues surrounding

14 this case.

15 Well, I would say that it would be quite the opposite;
16 that his wealth and privilege and the notoriety of the case

17 would actually make it I think often more difficult.

18 Also that they now were arguing that the discipline of
19 this time, but yet we know that they have found photos of young
20 women in his home and that if he's continuing to engage with
al pornography of young women, I would say that would be quite the
22 opposite of disciplining.
28 Also those victims in the photographs are continuing
24 to be victimized.
25 THE COURT: Are you in a position to answer this
