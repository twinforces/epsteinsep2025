Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 106. Filed 12/30/20 Page 19 of 22

None of these conditions; would reasonably assure the Defendant;s appearanec. Here,
too, the Court’s original determination applics with equal forec. As the Court noted. atthe.
‘original hearing, the Defendant has demonstrated an,cxtraordinary capacity to evade: detection,
“(e]ven. in the face of what:the Defense has acknowledged to be extreme and’unusual cfforts to
locate. her.” Tr. at 87:4-87:19. Indced,:regardless of whether the Defendant sought to evade the:
press, rather than law enforcement, in the months leading up to her arrest, her sophistication in
evading: detection reveals the futility of relying on any conditions, including GPS. monitoring,
restrictive home confinement, and private security guards, to secure her appearance. See: Tr. at
87:4-88:2. As other courts have observed, “home detention with. clectronic monitoring docs not
prevent flight; at. best, it limits.a fleeing defendant’s head start.” United States. ¥. Zarger, No. 00-
CR-773-S-], (JG),.2000 WL, 1134364, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000). Furthermore, while the
Defendant. now represents that she would be released to the custody. of a family member, who.
would.serve as the Defendant’s third-party:custodian under 18 U.S.C. § 3:142(c)(1)(B)(i),, and
that she secured.a residence in the Eastern District:of New’ York, see Def. Mot. at 3, that: docs not
outweigh the other significant factors weighing in ‘favor of detention. And finally, ‘the
Defendant’s argument that private security guards could ensure her appearance at future
proceedings runs‘afoul, of the: Bail, Reform Act, which the Sccond:Circuit has held “does ‘not
permit a.two-tiered bail, system, in Which defendants of lesser nicans are, detained pending trial.
while:wealthy: defendants are released to sclf=funded private jails.” United States vy, Boustani,
932. F.3d 79, 82 (2d Cir. 2019). As in Boustani, the Defendant:in the present. case would be.
detained regardless of her wealth, and.“if a similarly situated defendant of lesser:means would be
detained, a wealthy defendant-cannot.avoid detention, by relying on. his’personal funds to pay for

‘private detention.” Jd.
