contained inthe Indictment. All this An. less than a week, and. all in addition toa an Indictment that

B. The.Proposed.Bond.is Inadequate to.Overcome the Presumption of Detention.

The defendant’s,“slate of highly. restrictive” measures which‘purportedly “amply: suffice to
secure. his, release” are neither highly restrictive:nor-amply sufficient. Rather, they are cffcétively
standard conditions ofhome confinement, monitoring, and bond ‘unsecured by: the defendant’s
asscts—broken out into: 14'pieces. The Government will address the most concerning and. salient
clements of the defendant’s proposal below:

1. Lack of Meaningful. Bond Sceurity

The defendant proposes that the Court accept his Manhattan, mansion, as the primary:
‘security ‘for a personal.recognizance bond of'an. indeterminate amount, to be co-signed by. the
defendant’s brother: and a.fricnd. Relcase Motion at 4. This is plainly insufficient.

Asan. initial.:matter, and as noted. above, the: defendant’s Manhattan mansion.-has been.
identified in the Indictment:as subject to ‘forfeiture: because it is alleged to have been, used to
commit or facilitate the commission, ofthe sex trafficking offenses. charged there. See 18 U.S.C.
§1594(c)(T). Because the defendant. would thus be likely’ to lose ‘that: ‘property. following a,
conviction, it provides no value ‘whatsoever as collateral. See 18, U-S.C. § 3142(2)(4) (“In
considering the conditions of release described... . the judicial. officer... . shall decline to accept
the designation, or the use-as collateral, of property that, because of its source, will. not reasonably
his: private jcta as s additional collateral, there i is “absolutely 1 no, reason to, assume that the defendant
would, not readily tradé his private plane for his freedom. Indeed, the defendant, ‘who, has a-net
worth of more than. $500. million, by: his own admission. recently: sold. a. second ‘plane and thus
presumably has cash.on hand to replace the posted aircraft without-difficulty if need be.

Nor does ‘the proposed security of propertics, owned by. two identified co-signers
meaningfully change ‘the calculus. As further described. below, the defendant provides no
information about the. value. or equity’ of the ‘property of his brother, Mark (the “Palm. Beach,
Property”), or the significance: of that. ‘property in. the context of his brother’s own net worth.®
Similarly, the defendant provides no details regarding the “investment interests” of his friend. Mr.
Mitchell, ‘nor any reason, to believe the loss of those “interests” would be meaningful to Mr.
Mitchell, Ict,alone the defendant. More gencrally, given the defendant’s ‘proffered net worth, the
deféndant:could casily make his co-signers whole — and even réward:them.— ‘were he'to flee.

The proposed security, in sum, should give’ the Court. little comfort, the defendant would.
appear’in, Court: if released on, bail.

° In. fact, the. defendant’s own submission. makes. clear that the Palm Beach, Propeity isnot his
brother’s ‘exclusive residence and that his brother lives elsewhere for half. of the-year.
