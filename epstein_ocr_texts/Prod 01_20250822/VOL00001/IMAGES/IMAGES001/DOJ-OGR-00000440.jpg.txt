Re: United States v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB)

Dear Judge Berman:

The Government respectfully submits this letter to provide the Court with additional
information in response to the Court’s questions at the detention hearing held on July 15, 2019

In a July 12, 2019 letter, the Government informed the Court that the Government had
recently obtained records from a financial institution (“Institution-1”) that appeared to show the
defendant had made suspicious payments shortly after the Miami Herald began publishing, on
approximately November 28, 2018, a series of articles relating to the defendant, his alleged sexual
misconduct, and the circumstances under which he entered into a non-prosecution agreement
(“NPA”) with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida in 2007. The same
series highlighted the involvement of several of Epstein’s former employees and associates in the
alleged sexual abuse. At the Detention Hearing, the Court asked the Government to provide
additional information about the individuals to whom these payments appear to have been made.

after the series in the Miami Herald began, the defendant wired $100,000 from a trust account he
a potential co-conspirator—and for whom Epstein obtained protection in—the NPA. This
individual was also named and featured prominently in the Herald series.

the defendant wired $250,000 from the same trust account to ee. who was
' For the reasons set forth at the Detention Hearing, and with the consent of the Court, the
Government is redacting the identities of these individuals in the publicly filed version of this
letter.
