1 is a model for how victims should be treated in a criminal

2 process, and we really do appreciate it. Thank you.

3 THE COURT: Thank you.

4 MR. CASSELL: I'll be very brief because I know there
5 are others that want to speak here. I'm Paul Cassell,

6 C-a-s-s-e-l-l, previously served as a federal judge at the

7 District of Utah, currently a law professor, where I teach

8 crime victims rights at the University of Utah, College of Law.
9 I just wanted to take one minute to address some

10 suggestion that there would be no need for a hearing this

11 morning. I think, having heard already from these powerful

12 victims and recognizing how important giving those statements
13 will be in the trajectory of their lives, makes clear that your
14 Honor has followed exactly the right path. Legally, there is
15 one precedent, which is U.S. v. Heaton, a case that you cited
16 that I wrote about a decade ago, and as explained in that

17 opinion, victims have important interests in the criminal

18 justice system that can only be recognized if they're given

19 their day in court.
20 With all due respect to other law professors that have
21 recently written an article, I think transparency is one of the
22 overriding objectives in our criminal justice system, and the
23 one substantive action that I would urge your Honor to take
24 today is to publish your remarks as a published opinion. The
25 Heaton case is, to my knowledge, the only reported decision on
