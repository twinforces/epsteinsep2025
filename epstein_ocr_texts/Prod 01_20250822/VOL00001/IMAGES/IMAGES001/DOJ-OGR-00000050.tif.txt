factor is that, when a plea rests in any significant
degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so
that it can be said to be part of the inducement or
consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.” Jd. And
in Giglio v. United States, this Court found that “the
prosecutor’s office is an entity and as such it is the
spokesman for the Government. A promise made by
one attorney must be attributed, for these purposes, to
the Government.” Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S.
150, 154 (1972).

Yet despite this binding precedent, the Second
Circuit refuses to hold its United States prosecutors to
the promises that other United States prosecutors
have made on behalf of the United States, instead
clinging to the position that a plea agreement binds
only the district in which it was entered unless it
expressly states otherwise, even if the promise is made
on behalf of the “United States.” (App.8-12). The
Seventh Circuit similarly applies a narrow interpreta-
tion of who is bound by a pledge on behalf of the
“United States” or the “Government.” This policy jeop-
ardizes the integrity of the plea negotiation process
nationwide, which is “an essential component of the
administration of justice” that “presupposel[s] fairness
in securing agreement between an accused and a
prosecutor.” Santobello, 404 U.S. at 261.

The Second and Seventh Circuit’s policy is squarely
in conflict with that of the Third, Fourth, Eighth and
Ninth Circuits, creating a circuit split with nationwide
ramifications pursuant to which the same plea agree-
ment can receive a different interpretation throughout
the country on one of its most fundamental aspects
(a defendant’s potential future criminal liability). This
case provides an ideal opportunity to resolve this
