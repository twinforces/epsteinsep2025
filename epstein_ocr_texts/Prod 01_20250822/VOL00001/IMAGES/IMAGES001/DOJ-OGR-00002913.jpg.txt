Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the defense letter dated
March 31, 2021 (Dkt. No. 192), and pursuant to the Court’s Order dated April 2, 2021 (Dkt. No.
193). As set forth below, the timing of superseding indictment S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) (the “S2
Indictment”) was dictated by developments in the Government’s ongoing investigation, not the
nefarious motivations suggested by the defense. Although trial may be modestly longer as a result,
the S2 Indictment by no means opens the floodgate of witnesses the defense imagines; to the
contrary, the Government expects to present a streamlined case focusing primarily on the four
minor victims referenced in the S2 Indictment. Moreover, the Government has already taken, and
will continue to take, steps to ensure that the defense will be fully prepared for trial as scheduled
in July. Accordingly, the Government would oppose any request for an adjournment of trial.
Finally, the addition of new charges, supported by even more evidence, in no way warrants
reconsideration of this Court’s three prior orders denying the defendant bail.

First, the Government obtained the S2 Indictment based on new evidence that was not
available to it at the time the defendant was indicted in 2020 or at the time Jeffrey Epstein was
indicted in 2019. Specifically, although Minor Victim-4 had previously been interviewed once in
