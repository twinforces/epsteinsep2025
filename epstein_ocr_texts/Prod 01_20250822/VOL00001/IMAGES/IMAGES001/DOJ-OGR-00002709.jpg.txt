immediately’ disclose all:potentially favorable evidence having a:reasonable probability: to
affect. the outcome of. the proceedings. It is. further requested that the Court: direct the’
government to disclose such information immediately upon its discovery.

It is well settled that pursuant to,#rad): and. its progeny; the government must
disclose, evidence, information, and facts that could be used to impeach its witnesses.. Sve
United:States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 221,225 (2d Cir. 2007). Such evidence includes any
and all evidence of a witness” prior crimes or acts of moral turpitude, prior inconsistent
statements, and statements.demonstrating a lack of knowledge or a‘denial of thé facts of the
case or the alleged guilt of the defendant, and specific instances of conduct :from. which iit
can, be. inferred the witness is untruthful.

But disclosure of Brady material is not thé erid 6f thé line. Quité the contrary, it is.a
launching: point. for an. investigation that, may bear critical information. ‘In order, to mount an
effective defense, Ms. Maxwell, must receive this material, in, sufficient time to, investigate
and develop it for effective use before:and during trial. We'therefore request.the immediate:
disclosure of all. Brady and ‘Giglio material.

The government'takes the customary position that. it'will tum. over any Gig/io material at
the time it provides prior statements: of witnesses pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3500, In.doing so, the
government:erroneously assumes that Gig/io‘material,is something other, than..Brady material.
The Supreme Court has made clearthat impeachment evidence “falls within. the Brady rule.”
Bagley, 473 U.S. at 676 (citing Giglio, 405 US. at 154). Favorable evidence, generally referred
to as Brady material, exculpates. the accused or inpéaches prosecution ’withesses. Jd. at 674,

Cir. 20011).
