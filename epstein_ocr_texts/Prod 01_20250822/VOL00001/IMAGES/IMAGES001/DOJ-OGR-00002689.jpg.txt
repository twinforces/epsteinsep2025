I. In the Alternative, the Government Should Be Required to Demonstrate the

Admissibility of Evidence Regarding Accuser-3 Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).

At a minimum, the government should not be permitted to use the allegations regarding
Accuser-3 to perform an end-run around Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). Rather, the government should be
required to demonstrate the admissibility under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) of any evidence regarding
Accuser-3.

Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) “governs the admissibility of evidence of prior or subsequent ‘bad
acts’—evidence of ‘crimes, wrongs, or acts’ other than those charged in the indictment.” United
States v. Curley, 639 F.3d 50, 56 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)). “The rule
prohibits the admission of such evidence if it ‘prove[s] the character of a person’ to show his
propensity to commit the charged act, but permits its admission for other purposes.” /d. (quoting
Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)). Permissible purposes include “proving motive, opportunity, intent,
preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.” Fed. R. Evid.
404(b)(2). In a criminal case, the rule obligates a prosecutor to (i) “provide reasonable notice of
any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial, so that the defendant has a fair
opportunity to meet it”; (i1) “articulate in the notice the permitted purpose for which the
prosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose”; and (111)
“do so in writing before trial” unless excused by the court. Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(3).

As shown above, evidence regarding Accuser-3 is irrelevant to the conspiracy counts.
Thus, to the extent that the government intends to introduce evidence regarding Accuser-3, such
evidence is “other acts” evidence, and its admissibility should be litigated under Fed. R. Evid.
A04(b).
