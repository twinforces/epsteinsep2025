In the Alternative, the Government.Should Be Required to Demonstrate the
Admissibility of Evidence Regarding Accuser-3 Pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).

Ata minimum, the government should not be permitted to usé the allegations regarding
Accuser-3 to’ perform, an end-run around Fed. 'R. Evid. 404(b). Rather, the government:should’be
required to, demonstrate the admissibility under Fed. R.. Evid. 404(b) of any'evidence regarding
Accuser-3.

Fed. R. Evid. 404(b), “governs the ‘admissibility of evidence. of prior or subsequent ‘bad
acts’—eviderice of ‘crimés, wrongs, or acts’ other than those charged in the indictment.” United
States v. Curley, 639 F.3d 50, 56 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)). “The rule

prohibits the ‘admission of such, evidence if it ‘prove[s] the; character, of a person’ to show his

preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.” Fed..R. Evid.
404(b)(2). In.a criminal case; the rule obligates. a prosecutor to (i) “provide reasonable notice of
Opportunity to meet it”; (ii). “articulate in the notice the permitted:purpose for which-the
prosecutor intends to offer the evidence and.the-reasoning that:supports the purpose”; and (iii)
“do so in writing before trial” unless excused by'the court. ‘Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(3).

AS showii-above, evidence regarding. Accuser-3 is: irrelévarit to the. conspiracy-counts..
Thus, to the extent that the government, intends to introduce evidence regarding Accuser-3, such
evidence is “other acts” evidence, and its admissibility should be litigated under Fed. ‘R. Evid.

404(b).
