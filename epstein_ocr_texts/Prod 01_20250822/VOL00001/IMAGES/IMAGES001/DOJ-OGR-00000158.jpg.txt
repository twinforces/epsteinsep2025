charges against Epstein. She also provided a lengthy
memorandum summarizing the evidence she had
assembled in support of the charges and addressing
the legal issues related to the proposed charges.

For several weeks following submission of the
prosecution memorandum and proposed indictment,
the AUSA’s supervisors reviewed the case to determine
how to proceed. At a July 31, 2007 meeting with
Epstein’s attorneys, the USAO offered to end its
investigation if Epstein pled guilty to state charges,
agreed to serve a minimum of two years’ incarceration,
registered as a sexual offender, and agreed to a mecha-
nism through which victims could obtain monetary
damages. The USAO subsequently engaged in additional
meetings and communications with Epstein’s team of
attorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-
based resolution of the federal investigation, which
culminated in the signing of the NPA on September 24,
2007. The NPA required Epstein to plead guilty in
state court to the then-pending state indictment
against him and to an additional criminal information
charging him with a state offense that would require
him to register as a sexual offender—specifically,
procurement of minors to engage in prostitution, in
violation of Florida Statute § 796.03. The NPA
required Epstein to make a binding recommendation
that the state court sentence him to serve 18 months
in the county jail followed by 12 months of community
control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA
also included provisions designed to facilitate the
victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein.
In exchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation
of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in the
Southern District of Florida of him, four named
co-conspirators, and “any potential co-conspirators.”
