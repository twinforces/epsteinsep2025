As has been widely reported, the defendant is extraordinarily wealthy, and he owns and
maintains luxury properties and residences around the world, including in Manhattan, New York;
Palm Beach, Florida; Stanley, New Mexico; and Paris, France. Additionally, Epstein owns a
private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands which, as noted above, is believed to be his primary
residence in the United States. His mansion in Manhattan alone—a multi-story townhouse
reported to be one of the largest single residences in all of Manhattan, which previously housed a
school and which he owns through an LLC—has been valued at approximately $77 million.
Entities controlled by the defendant also own at least two private jets in active service, at least one
of which is capable of intercontinental travel.

As described further below, the defendant possesses three active United States passports,
and his international connections and travels are extensive. For example, in addition to
maintaining a residence in Paris, France, as described above, in the past 18 months alone, the
defendant has traveled abroad, via private jet, either into or out of the country on approximately
more than 20 occasions.

C. The Prior Florida Investigation

In or about 2005, the defendant was investigated by local police in Palm Beach, Florida, in
connection with allegations that he had committed similar sex offenses against minor girls. The
investigation ultimately also involved federal authorities, namely the U.S. Attorney’s Office for
the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”) and the FBI’s Miami Office, and included interviews
with victims based in the Palm Beach area, including some of the alleged victims relevant to Count
One of the instant Indictment."

In fall 2007, the defendant entered into a non-prosecution agreement with the SDFL in
connection with the conduct at issue in that investigation, which the non-prosecution agreement
identified as including investigations into the defendant’s abuse of minor girls in the Palm Beach
area. The Southern District of New York was not a signatory to that agreement, and the defendant
was never charged federally.” In June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count
of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and one count of solicitation
of prostitution, a felony. As a result, the defendant was designated as a sex offender with
registration requirements under the national Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act.

' The non-prosecution agreement, further discussed below, was entered into at the conclusion of
the SDFL investigation and did not purport to cover any victims outside of the State of Florida.
As noted above, the instant Indictment expressly alleges the existence of dozens of victims who
were abused in this District in addition to dozens of victims who were abused in Florida.

> While beyond the scope of a bail hearing, as discussed further below, it is well-established in the
Second Circuit that absent an express provision to the contrary in the agreement, one District is
not bound by the terms of an agreement entered into between a defendant and a U.S. Attorney’s
Office in another district. See page 6, infra.
