ANALYSIS

I. Fair Cross-Section Challenge

Because Schulte’s fair cross-section Claifi-arises under both the Sixth Amendment and.
the JSSA, he must:meet the three-part test.set forth under Duren. See LaChance, ‘788 F.2d at
870.

The parties do not dispute that the first element under Duren has been, satisfied. That
element asks whether “the group alleged,to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community.”
Duren,.439 U.S. at.364.. Here, Schulte allegés that. African American and Hispanic American
jurors were unlawfully excluded from the jury venire. (Schulte Br. at’7.) These groups have
been recognized as “distinctive” by the Second Circuit. Rioux, 97 F.3d at.654 (“Rioux has
satisfied the first prong of the Duren'tést: Blacks and Hispanics are unquestionably “distinctive”
groups for the purposes. of a fair-cross-section analysis.”); United States v. Barnes, 520 F.
Supp:2d.510; 514 (S.D.N.Y..2007). Schulte has therefore satisfied the first clementunder
Duren. The Court holds, however, that Schulte.cannot establish the second and third élements of

the Duren test. Accordingly, his fair cross-section challenge must be'rejected.
