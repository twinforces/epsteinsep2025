In addition to fair cross-section claims, a defendant may also assert other violations of the
ISSA if those violations constitute a “substantial failure to comply with its provisions.” Jd. at :

ANALYSIS
1. Fair Cross-Section Challenge |
Because Schulte’s fair cross-section claim arises under both the Sixth Amendment and
the ISSA, he must meet the three-part test set forth under Duren. See LaChance, 788 F.2d at |
The parties do not dispute that the first element under Duren has been satisfied. That |
element asks whether “the group alleged to be excluded is a distinctive group in the community.”
Duren, 439 U.S. at 364. Here, Schulte alleges that African American and Hispanic American |
jurors were unlawfully excluded from the jury venire. (Schulte Br. at 7.) These groups have
been recognized as “distinctive” by the Second Circuit. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (“Rioux has
satisfied the first prong of the Duren test: Blacks and Hispanics are unquestionably “distinctive”
groups for the purposes of a fair-cross-section analysis.”); United States v. Barnes, 520 F.
Supp.2d 510, 514 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). Schulte has therefore satisfied the first element under
Duren. The Court holds, however, that Schulte cannot establish the second and third elements of
the Duren test. Accordingly, his fair cross-section challenge must be rejected.
