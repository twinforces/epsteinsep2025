1 materials; (2) identify and evaluate the weight of any

2 countervailing interests; and (3) determine whether the

5 countervailing interests rebut the presumption.

4 The presumption of public access attaches to judicial
5 documents; that is, those documents filed in accordance with a
6 decided motion or papers that are relevant to the Court's

7 exercise of its inherent supervisory powers. The documents at
8 issue here were submitted in connection with discovery motions
9 decided by Judge Sweet. The Court concludes that they are

10 judicial documents to which the presumption of public access
11 attaches.

12 As with the documents that the Court ordered unsealed
13 in July, however, the motions at issue today are, as noted,

14 discovery motions. Accordingly, the presumption of public

15 access is somewhat less weighty than for a dispositive motion.
16 It is, nevertheless, important to the public's interest in

17 monitoring federal courts' exercise of their Article III powers
18 that the public review the documents.

19 With this presumption of public access in mind, the
20 Court turns to the countervailing interests at stake. The
21 Court has considered the arguments advanced by the parties in
22 their briefing. It has also considered the submission from
28 intervenors Julie Brown and the Miami Herald Media Company.
24 The Court has also received submissions from various Does, in
25 addition to Does 1 and 2, who are under consideration now.
