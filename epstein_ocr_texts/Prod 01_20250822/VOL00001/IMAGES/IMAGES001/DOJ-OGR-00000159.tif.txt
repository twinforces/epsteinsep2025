Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a
potential state resolution or the NPA prior to its signing.

The signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to
Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration, however. For

the USAO and senior Department officials, defense
counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the
NPA’s terms. They also sought and obtained review by
the Department’s Criminal Division and then the
Office of the Deputy Attorney General, primarily on
the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense
insisted was “a quintessentially state matter.” After
reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO,
on June 23, 2008, the Office of the Deputy Attorney
General informed defense counsel that the Deputy
Attorney General would not intervene in the matter.

charge, followed by 12 months of community control.
Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a
