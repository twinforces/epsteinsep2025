Given the surge in positive cases at select sites and in response to the Attorney General Barr's directives, the BOP began
immediately reviewing all inmates who have COVID-19 risk factors, as described by the CDC, to determine which inmates are
suitable for home confinement. Since the release of the Attorney General's original memo to the Bureau of Prisons on March 26,
2020 instructing us to prioritize home confinement as an appropriate response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the BOP has
significantly increased its placement of offenders on home confinement. Currently, the BOP has --- inmates on home
confinement. The total number of inmates placed in home confinement from March 26, 2020 to the present (including inmates
who have completed service of their sentence) is ---.
