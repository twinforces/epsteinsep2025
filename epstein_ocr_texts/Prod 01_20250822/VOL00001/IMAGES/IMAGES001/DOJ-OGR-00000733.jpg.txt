transcripts in United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and other
personal identifying information.” The Department will work with the United States Attorney’s
Office for Southern District of New York to make appropriate redactions of victim-related
information and other personal identifying information prior to releasing the transcripts.
Transparency in this process will not be at the expense of our obligation under the law to protect
victims.

1. On July 2, 2019, a grand jury sitting in the Southern District of New York returned
an indictment charging Epstein with sex trafficking offenses. See Dkt. No. 2. On August 10, 2019,
while awaiting trial, Epstein committed suicide in his cell in the Metropolitan Correctional Center
in New York City. Soon after, the Court dismissed the indictment. Dkt. No. 52.

2. On June 29, 2020, a grand jury sitting in the Southern District of New York charged
Epstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, with numerous offenses related to the trafficking
and coercion of minors. See United States v. Maxwell, 1:20-cr-330, Dkt. No. 1 (S.D.N.Y. June 29,
2020). In December 2021, a jury found Maxwell guilty on several counts. Maxwell was sentenced
to 240 months’ imprisonment, and the Second Circuit later affirmed her convictions and sentence.
See United States v. Maxwell, 118 F.4th 256 (2d Cir. 2024).

De On July 6, 2025, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation
announced the conclusion of their review of the particulars of Epstein’s crimes and death. Since
then, the public’s interest in the Epstein matter has remained. Given this longstanding and
legitimate interest, the government now moves to unseal grand jury transcripts associated with
Epstein.
> The Department of Justice is filing similar motions in United States v. Maxwell, 1:20-cr-330 (S.D.N.Y.), and in the
Southern District of Florida.
