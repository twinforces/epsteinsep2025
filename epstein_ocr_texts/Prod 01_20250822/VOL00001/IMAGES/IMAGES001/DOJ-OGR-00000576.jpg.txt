Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document 36- Filed 07/24/19 Page 66 of 74 66
1 That's not consistent with the explanation that he had
2 no idea that there was a federal case that would be brought
5 when he made the payments to his old associates.
4 The fact is, your Honor, the defendant thought he'd
5 gotten away with it. And the government really put its money
6 where its mouth is on this issue of notice and of the covert
7 nature of the investigation.
8 This investigation was going on for months, and the
9 government took extraordinary efforts not to have the defendant
10 find out about it, and he didn't. And neither did anyone else
11 until the case was unsealed.
12 Any number of people in this court who would have
13 loved to have reported the fact of this investigation, and it
14 didn't get out because the government was concerned that the
15 defendant would flee as we continue to be now.
16 Your Honor, this is the Southern District. The
17 defendant is indicted. He is in a grave position, and he has
18 every motive and every means to flee if he's released.
19 THE COURT: I have one question of you.
20 In your submission -- I think it was in your most
21 recent submission -- you mentioned that you had been contacted
22 by victims or their counsel probably or perhaps and that they
28 were of the view that there should not be any bail, any
24 release.
25 Are you aware if any of them wish to be heard?
