A few minutes later, the incoming West Palm Beach
manager emailed Lourie, suggesting that Lourie “talk
to Epstein and close the deal.”"'®

Within moments, Lourie replied to the manager,
with a copy to Villafafia, reporting that he had just
spoken with Lefkowitz and agreed “to two fed[eral]
obstruction[] charges (24 month cap) with nonbinding
recommendation for 18 months. When [Epstein] gets
out, he has to plead to state offenses, including against
minor, registrable, and then take one year house
arrest/community confinement.” By reply email,
Villafana asked Lourie to call her, but there is no
record of whether they spoke.

F. Defense Counsel Offers New Proposals
Substantially Changing the Terms of the
Federal Plea Agreement, which the USAO
Rejects

Approximately an hour after Lourie’s email reporting
the deal he had reached with Lefkowitz, Lefkowitz
sent Villafafia a revised draft plea agreement. Despite
the agreement Lourie believed he and Lefkowitz had
reached that morning, Lefkowitz’s proposal would
have resulted in a 16-month federal sentence followed
by 8 months of supervised release served in the form
of home detention. Lefkowitz also inserted a statement
in his proposal explicitly prohibiting the USAO from
requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration
authorities to institute immigration proceedings against
two of Epstein’s female assistants.

48 The manager told OPR that he probably meant this as a joke
because in his view the continued back-and-forth communications
with defense counsel “was ridiculous,” and the only way to “get
this deal done” might be to have a direct conversation with Epstein.
