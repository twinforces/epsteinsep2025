LARA POMERANTZ, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, hereby affirms under penalty of
perjury:

1. I am an Assistant United States Attorney in the Office of Audrey Strauss, United
States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, and I represent the Government in this
appeal. I submit this affirmation in support of the Government’s motion to file an unredacted copy
of Exhibit F, the Government’s Memorandum in Opposition to the Defendant’s Renewed Motion
for Release, under seal.

2. Counsel for the Defendant-Appellant filed publicly a redacted version of Exhibit F,
which was the version publicly filed on the docket in this case. (Dkt. No. 100). The redactions to
that document are narrowly tailored to cover (1) information implicating the privacy interests of
third parties previously articulated by the defense (Dkt. No. 86), and (2) Confidential Material
produced by the Government in discovery and governed by the protective order in this case (DKt.
No. 36). The Government believes that some of the redacted information is pertinent to this appeal
and therefore seeks leave to file an unredacted copy of Exhibit F under seal.
