Ex. E, 99 pp 2-3.

Those representations were false. At the time the government claims it began the
investigation (i). its knowledge of the civil case was not
based exclusively on public filings. It knew that J possessed relevant information
because J had come to the government asking it to open an investigation. In particular, on
February 29, 2016, AUSA Amanda Kramer met with attorneys from Boies Schiller, who “urged
Kramer to open an investigation of” Epstein and Maxwell.* Then, after Maxwell’s two
depositions, David Boies himself apparently approached the government in the summer of 2016,
asking “if the Southern District would consider charging Maxwell with perjury.” Brown, supra
n.2. Said Mr. Boies:

“We were saying to anyone who would listen: We’ve got clients who were abused.

Some of them were underage. We have the evidence. There’s a whole record that’s

been developed. We can establish beyond any reasonable doubt there was a massive

sex trafficking ring going on.”
