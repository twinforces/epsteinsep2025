Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 68 Filed 11/05/20 Page 2 of 2

In the event the Government believes that a disclosure under this Order would compromise
witness safety, victim rights, national security, a sensitive law-enforcement technique, or any other
substantial government interest, it may apply to the Court for a modification of its obligations,
which may include in camera review or withholding or subjecting to a protective order all or part of
the information otherwise subject to disclosure.

For purposes of this Order, the Government includes all current or former federal, state, and
local prosecutors, law-enforcement officers, and other officers who have participated in the
prosecution, or investigation that led to the prosecution, of the offense or offenses with which the
defendant is charged. The Government has an affirmative obligation to seek from such sources all
information subject to disclosure under this Order.

If the Government fails to comply with this Order, the Court, in addition to ordering
production of the information, may:

(1) specify the terms and conditions of such production;

(2) grant a continuance;

(3) impose evidentiary sanctions;

(4) impose sanctions on any responsible lawyer for the Government;

(5) dismiss charges before trial or vacate a conviction after trial or a guilty plea; or
(6) enter any other order that is just under the circumstances.
