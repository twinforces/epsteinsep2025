ee Similarly, the financial report does not include
a future income stream for Ms. Maxwell or her spouse because it presents only historical
and current assets. Even so, Ms. Maxwell has no certain future income stream. Her spouse
a and has had to liquidate his existing investments to help Ms. Maxwell. Finally, the
reference 0 iii is gratuitous. Ms. Maxwell had no knowledge of _

But the larger point is this: Ms. Maxwell has proposed a substantial bail package
with multiple co-signers and significant security. She and her spouse have pledged all of
their assets in support of the bond. Ms. Maxwell’s wealth is not a reason to deny her bail. It
is a reason to set appropriately strict conditions that will result in significant financial
consequences to Ms. Maxwell and her friends and family if she leaves the country. The
proposed bail package does exactly that.°

c. The Government’s Assertion that Ms. Maxwell Is “Adept” at Hiding and

Therefore a Flight Risk Is Specious

The government continues to assert the sinister narrative that Ms. Maxwell had “an

expertise at remaining hidden,” and that it would therefore be easy for her to become a fugitive.
° The government’s argument that her spouse’s moral suasion is diminished because Ms. Maxwell brought the

all of the assets of Ms. Maxwell and her spouse will be forfeited if she flees and her — | will be
left with nothing. Furthermore, the government’s assertion that they could not verify the spouse’s financial
information because Ms. Maxwell did not provide his current banking information is false. (/d. at 24 n.9). The
defense provided the spouse’s current banking records and only redacted the name of the bank.
