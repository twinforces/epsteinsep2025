Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 124 Filed 01/25/21 Page 4 of 8
INTRODUCTION
The Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) in this case is remarkable because it fails to
identify an accuser, a specific date that Ms. Maxwell is alleged to have committed a crime, or
when anything in furtherance of any alleged conspiracy occurred. The only dates contained in
the Indictment are the years 1994-1997, often combined with phrases such as “from at least in or
about” and “beginning in at least.” This mishmash of a pleading was carefully crafted to not
provide Ms. Maxwell with the necessary information to adequately investigate these false
allegations and prepare for trial. Ms. Maxwell is innocent and should not have to guess about
what evidence the Government claims warrants her continual incarceration but stubbornly
refuses to identify or disclose. The Court should dismiss Counts One through Four of the
Indictment or direct the Government to provide Ms. Maxwell with proper discovery and a Bill of
Particulars.
ARGUMENT
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(1) requires, among other things, that an
indictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts
constituting the offense charged ... .” There are two constitutional requirements for an
indictment to be sufficient: (1) it must contain “the elements of the offense charged and fairly
inform[ ] a defendant of the charge against which he must defend,” and (2) it must enable the
defendant “to plead an acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense.”
United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. 102, 108 (2007) (quoting Hamling v. United States,
418 U.S. 87, 117 (1974)). An indictment that fails to allege the essential elements of the crime
charged offends both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments. See Russell v. United States, 369 U.S.
749, 760-61 (1962).
