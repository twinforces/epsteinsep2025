Ghislaitie Maxwell,
ORDER.
Defendant.

ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed her renewed.application for
bail under seal with, proposed redactions, in, accordance with this Court’s, December. 7, 2020
Order, See-Dkt. No. 89. The Government did not file. any opposition to-the. Defendant’s proposed
redactions.

After duc consideration, the Court will adopt.the Defendant’s proposed'redactions. The
Court’s decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the three-part test articulated by the
‘Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d.110 (2d Cir. 2006). ‘Under
this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether'the documents in question are “judicial
documents;” (ii) assess the: weight of the common. law presumption of.access to'the materials;
and (111) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Jd: at 119-20.
“Such countervailing factors include but are not.limited to ‘the danger of impairing law
‘enforcement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” /d. at
120 (quoting United States v. Amodéo, 71. F.3d 1044, 1.048 (2d Cir.1995) (“Anrodéo IT”’)).

The proposed redactions satisfy this test. The Court finds that Defendant’s Ictter: motions
are “relevant.to the performance of the judicial function ‘and, uscful in the judicial process,”

thereby qualifying as a “judicial document” for purposes of the first clement: of the Liigosch test.
