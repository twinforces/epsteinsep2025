Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 7 of 45
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Memorandum in Support of her Renewed
Motion for Release on Bail.

As set forth more fully below, Ms. Maxwell is proposing an expansive set of bail
conditions that is more than adequate to address any concern regarding risk of flight and
reasonably assure Ms. Maxwell’s presence in court. Ms. Maxwell also provides compelling
additional information in this submission, not available at the time of the initial bail hearing
(which was held 12 days after her arrest), that squarely addresses each of the Court’s
concerns from the initial hearing and fully supports her release on the proposed bail
conditions. This information includes: (1) evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s significant family ties in
the United States; (2) a detailed financial report, which has also been reviewed by a former IRS
CID special agent, concerning her financial condition and assets, and those of her spouse, for the
last five years; (3) irrevocable waivers of her right to contest extradition from the United
Kingdom and France and expert opinions stating that it would be highly unlikely that Ms.
Maxwell would be able to resist extradition in the implausible event of her fleeing to either
country; (4) evidence rebutting the Government’s contention that Ms. Maxwell attempted to
evade detection by law enforcement prior to her arrest; and (5) a discussion of the weakness of
the government’s case against Ms. Maxwell, including the lack of corroborative,
contemporaneous documentary evidence in support of the three accusers.

Ms. Maxwell vehemently maintains her innocence and is committed to defending herself.
She wants nothing more than to remain in this country to fight the allegations against her, which
are based on the uncorroborated testimony of a handful of witnesses about events that took
place over 25 years ago. The Court should grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the restrictive
conditions proposed below to ensure her constitutional right to prepare her defense.
