Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97 Filed 12/14/20 Page 44 of 45

Ms. Maxwell’s quarantine period also resulted in cancellation of weekly in-person legal
visits. This is likely to continue in light of the spike in COVID infection within and outside the
MDC. Within a two-day period from December 1 to December 3, 55 inmates tested positive,
compared with 25 from March to December 1. As of the date of this filing, the BOP reports 80
MDC inmates and staff with COVID."* If legal visits are suspended, it will further limit our
ability to review the voluminous discovery (well in excess of one million documents) with Ms.
Maxwell and will further compromise her ability to prepare her defense. Moreover, as this Court
observed in United States v. Stephens, if an outbreak occurs “substantial medical and security
challenges would almost certainly arise.” Stephens, 447 F. Supp. 3d at 65. We urge the Court to
weigh the threat of COVID as a factor favoring release in this case, as it did in Stephens.

CONCLUSION

Ghislaine Maxwell is committed to defending herself and wants nothing more than to
remain in this country, with her family and friends by her side, so that she can fight the
allegations against her and clear her name. She is determined to ensure that her sureties and her
family do not suffer because of any breach of the terms of her bond. We have presented a
substantial bail package that satisfies the concerns of the Court and the government, which
contains more than ample security and safeguards to reasonably assure that Ms. Maxwell
remains in New York and appears in court. The Court has the obligation to ensure that a
defendant’s constitutional right to prepare a defense is safeguarded. The correct—and only
legitimate—decision is to grant Ms. Maxwell bail on the proposed strict conditions.
