extradition from Israel (or any other country) would be, at best, a difficult and lengthy process
and, at worst, impossible.”’).

Having carefully reviewed the experts’ reports and the cases cited by the Defendant,” the
Court’s analysis of the relationship between the Defendant’s French citizenship and the risk of
flight remains fundamentally unchanged. Its reasoning is guided in part by the substantial legal
questions regarding the legal weight of anticipatory extradition waivers and the likelihood that
any extradition would be a difficult and lengthy process (including, for instance, the likelihood
that the Defendant would contest the validity of those waivers and the duration it would take to
resolve those legal disputes). The likelihood that the Defendant would be able to frustrate any
extradition requests—even if she were correct that she would be unable to stop extradition
entirely weighs strongly in favor of detention.

In addition, the Defendant’s extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide
her the means to flee the country and to do so undetected. To be sure, this factor alone does not
by itself justify continued detention. But as the Court noted at the initial bail hearing, the
Detendant’s financial resources, in combination with her substantial international ties and
foreign connections and her experience avoiding detection (whether from the government, the
press, or otherwise), do bear significantly on the flight risk analysis. See Tr. at 88:6 88:23
(distinguishing this case from United States v. Esposito, 309 F. Supp. 3d 24 (S.D.N.Y. 2018),

* The Defendant also argues that “a defendant’s waiver of the right to appeal an extradition order
has been recognized as an indication of the defendant’s intent not to flee.” Def. Mot. at 27
(citing United States v. Khashoggi, 717 F. Supp. 1048, 1052 (S.D.N.Y. 1989)). The Court places
little weight on this argument. Under the Defendant’s theory, a defendant could strategically
offer to waive the right to extradition while intending to resist any subsequent extradition that
might result. The Court is unpersuaded.
