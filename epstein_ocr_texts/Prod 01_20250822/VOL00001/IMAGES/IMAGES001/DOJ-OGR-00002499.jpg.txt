1 First, there is a difference between people like

2 Professor Dershowitz, who say affirmatively, I don't care, let
5 it all out, and people from whom we just have not heard,

4 whether they received the documents or not.

5 Secondly, I understand that my direction from the

6 Court of Appeals is to make a particularized finding. I don't
7 think I can weigh the countervailing interests of any

8 particular Doe without considering that particular Doe by

9 himself or herself.

10 Accordingly, I don't think we can lump them together.
11 Should we receive indications from other Does that they

12 affirmatively have no objection to release of their material,
13 that makes it easy. But, otherwise, we have to go through

14 them, and I have to make a particularized finding. It will be
15 a long, tedious process, but even this time I think it went a
16 little more quickly.

17 Anything else, counsel?

18 Thank you, counsel, and thank you again for your

19 assistance in organizing the documents. Good morning.
