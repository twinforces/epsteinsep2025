First, there is a difference between people like

Professor Dershowitz, who say affirmatively, J dom"t cane, Let

it all out, and people from whom we just have not heard,

whéther théy receivéd the documénts Or not.

Secondly, I understand that my direction from the

Court of Appeals is to make a particularized finding. I don't

think I can weigh the countervailing interests of any

particular Doe without Considering that. particular Doe by

himself or ‘herself.

Accordingly, I don't think we can lump them together,
Should we receive indications frem other Does that they

affirmatively have no objection to release of their material,

that makes it easy. But, otherwise, we have to, go through
them, and I have to make a particularized finding, It. will be
a long, tedious process, but even this time I think it, went a
little more gitickly.

Anything 6156, counsél?

Thank you, counsel, and thank you again for your

assistance in organizing the documents. Good morming.
