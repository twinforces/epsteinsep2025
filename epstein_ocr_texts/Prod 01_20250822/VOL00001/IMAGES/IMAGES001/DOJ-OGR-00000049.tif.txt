REASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION

This case is the perfect vehicle for resolving an
acknowledged circuit split over the proper application
of this Court’s precedent regarding an important issue
of federal criminal law. Despite the fact that the term
“United States” has a widely accepted meaning in
perhaps every other context, when this term is used in
a plea agreement, it means something different in
New Jersey than it does across the river in New York

promise that he will not be prosecuted again by the
United States, pleads guilty to resolve all criminal
liability, is not in fact resolving all criminal liability
because the United States remains free to prosecute
him anew so long as it does so in the Second or Seventh
Circuits.

This Court should resolve this conflict, ensuring that
plea agreements are enforced consistently throughout
the United States so that when the United States
makes a promise in a plea agreement, it is held to that
promise.

on behalf of the “United States” or the
“Government” by a United States Attorney’s

agreement binds other prosecutors, even those who
might have been unaware of the promise. 404 U.S.
