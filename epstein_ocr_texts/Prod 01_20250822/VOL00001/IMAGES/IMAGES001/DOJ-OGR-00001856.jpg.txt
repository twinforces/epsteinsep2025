With regard to the November 25" Letter, Ms. Maxwell requests redaction of three
sentences. The first sentence must be redacted because it contains information that will identify
a proposed co-signer. The government, itself, concedes that such information should be
redacted. (See November 25" Letter at 3). The reference in this sentence to

Even assuming, arguendo, that
there is some minimal public interest in knowing the identity of a particular surety, it is vastly
outweighed by the significant privacy concerms in this case. See United States v. Amodeo, 71
F.3d 1044, 1050-51 (2d Cir. 1995) (“[t]he privacy interests of innocent third parties ... should
weigh heavily in a court’s balancing equation.... [C]ourts have the power to insure that their
records are not used to gratify private spite or promote public scandal[.]”).!

Similarly, redaction of the second and third sentences, like the first, is necessary to
protect the privacy and safety of people who have suffered, or legitimately fear they will suffer,
terrible personal and professional consequences for having been linked to Ms. Maxwell. People
close to Ms. Maxwell have been physically stalked by members of the tabloid press and have had

aparazzi jump out of bushes and in front of their cars to snap pictures of them.

And several have been the target of repeated physical threats. Many
of the people who want to support Ms. Maxwell’s renewed bail application are older and do not
have the financial means to hire a personal security detail to protect themselves. Nor should they
have to. They are all people of good character who are simply trying to support Ms. Maxwell’s
constitutional right to seek release on bail. They should be given appropriate protections so that
they can step forward without having their lives upended or, worse, destroyed.

The November 25” Letter, as submitted, intentionally avoided naming these individuals
for this very reason. But removing or redacting their names, as the government proposes, is not
enough. This case has generated so much media attention and public opprobrium that public
ie.

* Given the sensitive subject matter of this case, the sureties have legitimate fears for their safety if they are publicly
identified. Numerous social media posts have advocated killing Ms. Maxwell as a perverse form of “justice” for her
alleged role in Epstein’s sex trafficking crimes. As we have all been recently reminded with the tragic case of the
death of Judge Esther Salas’s son, there are people who are capable of committing horrible acts of violence—even
against innocent third parties—by convincing themselves that their actions are justified.
