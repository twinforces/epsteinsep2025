Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 142 Filed 02/04/21 Page 29 of 38

drafted.and executed by the government’s agents in the SDFL, and because Epstein performed
‘under the contract by entering’ a plea in.a Florida court; any conflict.of laws between the Second
Circuit and the Eleventh Circuit should. be resolved in. favor of the application of Eleventh
Circuit law to the NPA.

The Eleventh Circuit has not directly addressed whether a plea agreement or non-
prosecution agreement signed by one USAO iis binding: on.a USAO in. another district. But it
may be presumed, as it frequently is when predicting how a state’s highest court. would.rule in a.

Second Circuit casés on'which it:relicd); United States v. Van, Thornoitit, 100. F.3d 590,594 (8th:
Cir. 1996):(“Absent:an express limitation, any promises made by an. Assistant United States
Attorney in one district will bind an Assistant United, States Attorney in another district.”);
United States v: Harvey, 791 F.2d:294, 303 (4th. Cir. 1986) (“It is. the Government at large—not
agreements negotiated by agents of Government.”). In Gebbie, the Third Circuit analyzed,

Annabi and.its predecessor Second. Circuit cases in detail, concluding that the statement
