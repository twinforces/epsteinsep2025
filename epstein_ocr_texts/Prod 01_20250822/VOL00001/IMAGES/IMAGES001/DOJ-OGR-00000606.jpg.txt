1 (Case called)

2 THE COURT: I had hoped to have a written decision and
3 order by now, which I don't, one that is regarding the

4 release/remand of Mr. Epstein, which has been the subject of

5 multiple written submissions and, as you all know, an in-court
6 hearing on Monday, July 15, 2019. It is not quite physically

7 produced yet and it needs to be cite checked, but I should have
8 it on the docket in the next hour, two hours at most. What I

9 will do, however, is state the conclusions in the decision and
10 order, which I had said I would do, and summarize very briefly
11 the contents of the ruling for you.

12 Starting with my conclusions, the government's

13 application for continued remand is hereby granted and the

14 defense application for pretrial release is respectfully hereby
15 denied. Written opinion to follow.

16 In that opinion I will deal with all, I'll try to, all
17 the principal issues which have been briefed. Even though it
18 is not entirely necessary or legally required to consider both
19 dangerousness to others and to the community as well as risk of
20 flight, I have done so. I also deal with the defense's
21 proposed bail package. There is obviously significant public
22 interest in all of these legal issues, so I tried to cover them
23 all as best I could.
24 There are the following headings in the decision and
25 order. First is a background section, followed by counsel's
