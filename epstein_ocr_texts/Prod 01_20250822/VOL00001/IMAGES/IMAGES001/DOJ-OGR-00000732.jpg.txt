UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
United States of America

v.

1:19-cr-490 (RMB)
Jeffrey Epstein,
Defendant.

UNITED STATES’ MOTION TO UNSEAL GRAND JURY TRANSCRIPTS

At the direction of the Attorney General, the Department of Justice hereby moves the Court
to release grand jury transcripts associated with the above-referenced indictment.

On July 6, 2025, the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation issued a
memorandum describing an exhaustive review undertaken of investigative holdings relating to
Jeffrey Epstein (the “Memorandum”).! The Memorandum detailed the steps taken by the
Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation to determine whether evidence existed
that could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties. As the Memorandum concluded,
no such evidence was uncovered during the review.

Since July 6, 2025, there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the
Memorandum’s conclusions. While the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation
continue to adhere to the conclusions reached in the Memorandum, transparency to the American
public is of the utmost importance to this Administration. Given the public interest in the
investigative work conducted by the Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation
into Epstein, the Department of Justice moves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury
