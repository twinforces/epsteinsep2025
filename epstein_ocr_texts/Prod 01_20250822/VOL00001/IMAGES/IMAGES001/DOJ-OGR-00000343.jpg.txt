Re: = United States’v. Jeffrey Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB)
Dear Judge Pitman?

The Government respectfully submits this: letter in advance of the bail hearing scheduled
for July 8,:2019, in, the above-captioned case. For the reasons. sect. forth, herein, the Court ‘should.
order that the defendant be detained pending trial; he cannot meet. his burden of overcoming the
presumption that'there is no, combination.of conditions that would reasonably assure. his continued,
appearance in this case or protect the safety of the community: were he. to be released.

As ‘set forth below, ‘the charges in this case’ are’ exceptionally serious: the defendant is
alleged, to be, a scrial sexual predator*who preyed on.dozens of minor girls over,a. period of years,
and he now ‘faces.a potentially massive;prison sentence prédicated.on substantial and multifaceted.
evidence of his guilt. In light of the strength of the Government’s evidence and the. substantial.
incarceratory term, the defendant would face upon, conviction, there is an, extraordinary: risk of
flight, particularly given.the defendant’s exorbitant wealth, his ownership of and. access to private
planes, capable of international travel, and. his significant international, tics. Indeed, the arrest: of
the defendant,occurred'when.he arrived in the United States on his:privateyct after having returned.
from a multi-weck stay abroad.

Finally, ‘and. as. detailed ‘herein, the’ Government. has real concerns—grounded ‘in. past.
expericnee, with this defendant=that if allowed to remain out;on bail, ‘the, defendant could attempt.
to pressure: and intimidate witnesses and. potential witnesses in, this casc, including ‘victims and
their familic¢s, and otherwise, attempt to obstruct justice. As.a result, he poses both an.acute danger
to the: community, including :some of its most. vulnerable members, and a:significant risk of. flight.
The defendant:'thus cannot overcome the statutory ‘presumption that dctention.is appropriate in this
case, andthe Court should order‘that; he be detained pending trial.
