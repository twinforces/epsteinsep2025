of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.

On July 7, 2008, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,”
filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida
an emergency petition alleging that the government
violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18
U.S.C. § 3771, when it resolved the federal investiga-
tion of Epstein without consulting with victims, and
seeking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding
to the petition, the government, represented by the
USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did not
produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it
to be turned over subject to a protective order; the NPA
itself remained under seal in the federal district court.
After the initial filings and hearings, the CVRA case
was dormant for almost two years while the
petitioners pursued civil cases against Epstein.

Soon after he was incarcerated, Epstein applied for
the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s work release
program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In
October 2008, Epstein began spending 12 hours a day
purportedly working at the “Florida Science Foundation,”
an entity Epstein had recently incorporated that was
co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one of
Epstein’s attorneys. Although the NPA specified a
term of incarceration of 18 months, Epstein received
“gain time,” that is, time off for good behavior, and he
actually served less than 13 months of incarceration.
On July 22, 2009, Epstein was released from custody
to a one-year term of home detention as a condition of

Another victim subsequently joined the litigation as “Jane Doe 2.”
