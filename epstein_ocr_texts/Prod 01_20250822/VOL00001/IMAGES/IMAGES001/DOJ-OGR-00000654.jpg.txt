1 client at or around the time of his death, and obviously the

2 attorney-client privilege survives death and we are not going

3 to forfeit the privilege, but we will report to the court, with
4 as much specificity as the court may want, that at or around

5 the time of his death, we did not see a despairing, despondent
6 Suicidal person. Details to follow, if the court wishes.

7 The 800-pound gorilla, for us, of course, are the

8 video surveillance tapes. Obviously we assume there is a tape
9 that leads directly to the door where Jeffrey Epstein was

10 housed. If that tape reports for 12 hours before his death

11 that no one went in and out of that room, then the suggestion
12 that there was something other than a suicide seems

13 preposterous.

14 But there is no such evidence that has surfaced to

15 date. Just the opposite. We have heard, and we actually read
16 in the press, that the tapes were either corrupted or not

17 functioning. Talk about a yikes. If, in fact, the system was
18 broken for six months before Jeffrey Epstein was housed, I

19 mean, that would be stunning incompetence. If it was allowed
20 to continue to be inoperative when Jeffrey Epstein was housed,
21 it would be incompetence times ten. But what if the tapes only
22 broke down or were inoperative or were corrupted on the day he
23 was killed or the day he died? Then we're in a completely
24 different situation.
25 So where does this lead? I think where it leads,
