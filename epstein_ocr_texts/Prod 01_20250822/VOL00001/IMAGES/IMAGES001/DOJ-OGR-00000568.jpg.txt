1 more so than someone who is educated and privileged, and they

2 might need it more.

5 I think everybody has the same right, but it's very

4 hard. If the test is consult with counsel, well, then all this
5 other conversation we've been having is out the window because

7 come up with a new set of cases and a new set of tests.

8 By the way, don't think I don't appreciate that a

10 with counsel. But if that's the standard, then what are we

11 going to tell all those people who can't make a $500 or $1,000
12 bail who say, I want to talk to my lawyer because the

13 immigration authorities are going to come and take my wife

14 away, etc., etc., separate the kids.

15 MR. WEINBERG: I have three answers to that too.

16 THE COURT: I'd like them.

17 MR. WEINBERG: That's an important question. The

18 first is that the defendants in Rikers Island, or at least the
19 vast majority of them, are not facing a prosecution team as
20 well resourced and as talented as this one. They're not facing
21 a million pages of discovery. There may be exceptions.
22 THE COURT: They might be facing a lot more serious
28 consequences in terms of jail or incarceration for let's say
24 assault or murder or rape or whatever, and many of them do face
25 those consequences.
