Case 21-770, Document 1-2, 03/24/2021, 3065965, Page18 of 24
motion. In light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential
information that should not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the
parties 48 hours to propose any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to
justify those redactions by reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if
any, portions of the Opinion and Order should be redacted, the Court will file the
Opinion and Order on the public docket. As a result, the Court concludes that the
Government has met its burden of persuasion that the Defendant poses a flight risk and
that pretrial detention continues to be warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the
parties are ORDERED to submit a joint letter indicating whether they propose any
redactions and the justification for any such proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97.
