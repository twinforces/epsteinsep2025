I. Prejudice to Ms. Maxwell.

As a threshold observation, the government has failed to provide discovery adequate to
fully investigate the extent of the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell. We have not been provided with:

e The names of the Accusers;

e ยง=The dates of birth of the Accusers;

e = The specific location of any overt act;

e = The date of any overt act;

e Any witness statements; or

e Any supposed corroboration of any allegation in the Indictment.

Like the preindictment delay, the delay in timely providing discovery is tactical and
prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. Despite repeated requests, the government refuses to produce any
evidence. Without knowing the who, what, when, and why of these allegations, the task of
identifying dead and missing witnesses, percipient witness, travel records, phone records, or
temporally relevant documents is challenging and limited by the vagueness of the claims. For
example, the government produced part of its voluminous 2006 investigative case file
conceming these issues. The names of the alleged witnesses, the agents who conducted the
interviews and the agents who conducted the investigation are, however, redacted. Ms. Maxwell
has no ability to conclusively identify these individuals much less interview them and therefore
cannot represent to the Court whether they are alive, remember anything, or have useful
evidence. By withholding this information, the government is purposefully preventing Ms.
Maxwell from fully litigating this issue and presenting a defense.

What we know, so far, however, will be sufficient to establish prejudice. Potential
defense witnesses are dead, missing, otherwise unavailable, or unable to recall key events
clearly. In contrast, the government will profit from the dimmed memories of witnesses with:
