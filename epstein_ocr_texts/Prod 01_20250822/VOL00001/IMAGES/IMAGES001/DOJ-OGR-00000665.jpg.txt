hé was deeply trotibled by ‘the alleged Brady violations. I

represented the prosecutors in that case, so I'm very, very
familiar with it.

It is analogous. It is a situation where there was
trémendotis controversy over what happened in the case dnd

whether or not. the presecutors went off the reservation, Judge

Sullivan -- and there were thrée or four indépendent -- not
independent, DOJ inquiries into the very same’ matter. But
Judge Sullivan wanted His. own Opportunity ‘to make a Judgment
with his own independent investigation..

THE COURT: OK.

MR. WEINBERG: Jf I could just add, one precedent, your
Honor.

The Chief judge in the District, of Massachusetts or
the CHief Judge at the tame, Judge Wolf, in a case called

U.S. v. Fleming, when the conditions at Walpole, which ,is. a

state prison where federal prisoners were being héld == we

don't have a federal MCC in Boston, -- went to ‘the prison,

Stayed in the prisoh to determine whether or not the Gonplaints
about the conditions were authentic.

I think your Honor has the inherent authdérity to go to
the minth floor and, ‘see how the MCC houses pretrial detainees.

Thank you.

THE COURT: Are you saying that whether or not the
motion. is' granted that is pending before us?
