1 he was deeply troubled by the alleged Brady violations. I

2 represented the prosecutors in that case, so I'm very, very

3 familiar with it.

4 It is analogous. It is a situation where there was

5 tremendous controversy over what happened in the case and

6 whether or not the prosecutors went off the reservation. Judge
7 Sullivan -- and there were three or four independent -- not

8 independent, DOJ inquiries into the very same matter. But

9 Judge Sullivan wanted his own opportunity to make a judgment

10 with his own independent investigation.

11 THE COURT: OK.

12 MR. WEINBERG: If I could just add one precedent, your
13 Honor.

14 The Chief judge in the District of Massachusetts or

15 the Chief Judge at the time, Judge Wolf, in a case called

16 U.S. v. Fleming, when the conditions at Walpole, which is a

17 state prison where federal prisoners were being held -- we

18 don't have a federal MCC in Boston -- went to the prison,

19 stayed in the prison to determine whether or not the complaints
20 about the conditions were authentic.
21 I think your Honor has the inherent authority to go to
22 the ninth floor and see how the MCC houses pretrial detainees.
23 Thank you.
24 THE COURT: Are you saying that whether or not the
25 motion is granted that is pending before us?
