detention without bail is warranted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). The Court accordingly denies
Defendant’s request to reopen the original bail hearing.and denies. her renewed motion for bail.
A. The presumption in favor of detention applies

The Court is required to presume that no condition or combination of conditions of
pretrial rélease will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance. The Bail Reform Act
provides that if a defendant.is charged with committing an offense involving a minor victim
under 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 or 2423, “it shall be presumed that no condition or combination of
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of the
community if the judicial officer finds that there is probable:cause to believe that the person
committed.” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3)(E). The Defendant’s mdictment by a grand jury suffices to
establish that there is probable cause to believe that she committed the.offenses charged in the
indictment. See, ¢.g., United States v. Contreras, 776 F.2d 51, 53-54 (2d Cir. 1985) (noting that
that an indictment returmed by a properly constituted grand jury “conclusively determines the
existence of probable cause” and that “the return.of an indictment eliminates the need for a
preliminary examination at:which a probable cause finding is made by a judicial officer pursuant
to. Rule 5(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.” (citations omitted)). In light of the
crimes charged in the indictment; the Court begins with the presumption that. no condition or
combination of conditions of pretrial release ‘will reasonably assure the Defendant’s appearance.

When the presumption.applies, the Defendant bears a limited burden.of production
“tending to counter the § 3142(e) presumption of flight,” Contreras; 776 F.2d at 53 n.1. The
Defendant’s burden of production only requires that she “introduce a certain amount of evidence

contrary to the presumed fact.” United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 380 (1st Cir. 1985),
