ARGUMENT
I. Applicable Law

Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 et seq., federal courts are empowered to
order a defendant’s detention pending trial upon a determination that the defendant is either a
danger to the community or a risk of flight. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e) (“no condition or combination of
conditions would reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any
other person and the community”). A finding of risk of flight must be supported by a
preponderance of the evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987);
United States v. Chimurenga, 760 F.2d 400, 405 (2d Cir. 1985). A finding of dangerousness must
be supported by clear and convincing evidence. See, e.g., United States v. Ferranti, 66 F.3d 540,
542 (2d Cir. 1995); Chimurenga, 760 F.2d at 405. In addition, a court may also order detention if
there is “‘a serious risk that the [defendant] will . . . attempt to obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,
injure, or intimidate, a prospective witness or juror.” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(2)(B); see also United
States v. Friedman, 837 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1988).

The Bail Reform Act lists four factors to be considered in the detention analysis: (1) the
nature and circumstances of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against the person;
(3) the history and characteristics of the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]
financial resources”; and (4) the seriousness of the danger posed by the defendant’s release. See
18 U.S.C. § 3142(g). Evidentiary rules do not apply at detention hearings and the government is
entitled to present evidence by way of proffer, among other means. See 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(2);
see also United States v. LaFontaine, 210 F.3d 125, 130-31 (2d Cir. 2000) (government entitled
to proceed by proffer in detention hearings); Ferranti, 66 F.3d at 542 (same); United States v.
Martir, 782 F.2d 1141, 1145 (2d Cir. 1986) (same).

Where a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “no condition or combination of
conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any
other person and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before
trial.” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). Additionally, where, as here, a defendant is charged with
committing an offense involving a minor victim under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it shall be presumed,
subject to rebuttal, that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the
appearance of the defendant as required and the safety of the community. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3142(e)(3)(E).

II. Discussion

The defendant should be detained pending trial. For the reasons set forth below, it is
difficult to overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant is released,
and for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome the statutory presumption in favor of
detention in this case.
