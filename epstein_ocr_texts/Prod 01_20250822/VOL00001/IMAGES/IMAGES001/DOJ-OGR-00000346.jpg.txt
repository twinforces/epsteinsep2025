ARGUMENT

I. Applicable: Law:

Under the Bail Reform Act, 18 U.S.C. §§ 3141 ctiseq., federal courts are empowered. to
order a defendant’s detention pending’ trial upon a determination ‘that. the defendant. is cither:a,
danger'to the community or arisk of flight. 18:US.C. § 3142(c). (“no condition.or combination of
conditions would reasonably:assure:the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any.
other person. and the community”). A finding of risk of. flight: must be ‘supported. by a
preponderance of the evidence. See, ¢.g., United States v. Jackson, 823 F.2d 4, 5 (2d Cir. 1987);
United States v. Chimurenga, 760 F.2d. 400, 405 (2d Cir. 2985): A finding of dangerousness, must;
be: supported by clear and convincing: evidence. See, e.g, Unitéd States v. Ferranti,'66, F.3d 540,
542 (2d Cir. 1995); Chimurengd, 760.F.2d at 405. In. addition, d.court may also order detention if
there .:is “a. scrious risk that the [defendant] will . . .. attempt to.obstruct justice, or . . . to threaten,
injure, ¢ or intimidate, a a prospective witness or juror. ” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(f)(2)(B); see also United

The Bail. Reform. Act' lists, four ‘factors to be considcréd. i the detention analysis: (1) the
nature and. circumstances. of the crimes charged; (2) the weight of the evidence against:the: ‘person;
(3) the history and. characteristics of' the defendant, including the person’s “character . . . [and]
financial, resources”; and. (4): the seriousness. of, the danger posed, by the defendant’s release. See
18 U.S.C. § 31 42g). Evidentiary rules do not-apply at detention hearings and the government: is
entitled, to present evidence by’ way of proffer, among. other means. See 18 U:S.C. §'3142(f)(2);
see. also United. States v. Lak: ontaine, 210 F. 3d 125, 130- 31 oe Cir. res {government entitled

Mar Lir, 782 F, 2d | 141, | 145 (2d Cir. 1986) Game).

Where a judicial officer concludes after a hearing that “rio condition of combination of
conditions will reasonably: assure the appearance of the person. as required and the. safety. of any:
‘other person.and the community, such judicial officer shall order the detention of the person before
trial.” 18 U.S.C. § 3142(c)(1). Additionally,, where, ‘as here, a defendant. is charged. with
committing’ an, offense involving a ‘minor ‘victim ‘under 18 U.S:C. § 1591, it’shall. be presumed,
subject. to, rebuttal, that no, condition or combination. of conditions ‘will reasonably assure the
appearance of the defendant as :required ‘and the safety of the community. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3142(c)(3\(E).

Il. Discussion
The defendant should. ‘be detained. pending trial. For the:reasons. set forth below, it is
difficult to: overstate the risk of flight and danger to the community if the defendant. i is released,

and, for those reasons, the defendant cannot overcome’ the ‘statutory presumption, in favor of
detention in this case.
