Dear Professor Green, |

Thank you for your letter of August 30, 2019. I appreciate your taking the time to clarify

the record.

I learned that you had been “retained to provide opinions as an expert on legal ethics” in

Giuffre v. Dershowitz following the August 27, 2019 public hearing in US v. Epstein. I learned

of your role in the Giuffre case by reading your affidavit, dated June 7, 2019, which includes :

your legal ethics opinion that David Boies should be disqualified from representing Ms. Giuffre :

in that matter. As you are aware, both Mr. Boies and Ms. Giuffre were invited to testify at the :

August 27, 2019 hearing. 7

[ remain surprised that your advocacy of Mr. Boies’ disqualification from representing /

Ms. Guiffre Gn a case obviously related to US v. Epstein) was not disclosed simultaneously with /

your August 26, 2019 Law Journal opinion piece entitled “The Judge in Epstein’s Case Should

Not Turn the Dismissal Into a Drama for the Victims.” I am also surprised that you would find :

the August 27, 2019 public hearing to be an inappropriate occasion for transparency in light of i

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 57 and the Crime Victims’ Rights Act, 18 U.S.C, § 3771. :

You wrote: “This is an odd moment for transparency in a criminal case.”
