Dear Professor Gieen,

‘Thank you for your lettcr of August 30, 2019. I appreciate your taking the time to clarify
the record.

Giufire + Vi “Dershowitz followin th the August 27, 2019 "pull hearing in US vy. Epstein rd learned
of your'role in the Giuffre case. by reading’ your affidavit, dated June 7,,2019, which inclides
your Icgal ethics opinion that David Boies should be disqualified from réprésenting Ms. Giuffre
in.that matter. A’ you are aware, both Mr: Boies.and Ms. Giuffre were invited to testify at the
August 27,2019 hearing.

Tremain.surprised that your advocacy of Mr. Boies” disqualification from representing
Ms. Guiffre (in.a case obviously related to US_v. Epstein) was not discloscd simultaneously with
your August 26, 2019. Law Journal opinion piece entitled “Lhe Judge in.Epstcin’s Casé Should
“Not-Turn, the Dismissal Into a Drama. for the. Victims.” I.am also surprised. that you. would find
the. August 27, 2019 public hearing'to be. an inappropriate occasion for'transparency ini. light-of
Federal Rule: of Critnitial Procedure 57 and.the:Crime Victims’ Rights. ‘Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3771.
You wrote; “This is an odd moment:for transparency in.a criminal case.’
