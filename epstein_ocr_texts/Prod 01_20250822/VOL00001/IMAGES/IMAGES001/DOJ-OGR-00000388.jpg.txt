1 (Case called)

2 THE COURT: Good afternoon.

3 I think I'm pretty much up to speed as to where you

4 are in the sense that I am aware that you have been before

5 Magistrate Judge Pitman earlier this morning and up to some few
6 minutes ago for purposes of presentment, arraignment, and some
7 preliminary discussion of bail. Is that accurate?

8 MR. ROSSMILLER: That's correct, your Honor. I don't
9 want to speak for defense counsel, but my understanding is they
10 expect to put in some sort of written submission and return to
11 argue the rest of the bail hearing on Thursday before Judge

12 Pitman at 2:00. That is, if your Honor refers the bail hearing
13 to Judge Pitman on that basis as well.

14 THE COURT: I might just take that bail application

15 before me. We'll figure out a time when that would be

16 comfortable for all of you. How is that?

17 MR. WEINGARTEN: That's fine with the government, your
18 Honor.

19 THE COURT: I have a few items on my list. I want to
20 make mention, I'm sure Magistrate Judge Pitman did, of our
al presumption of innocence. Even though in some of these
22 discussions, and probably more so when we get to bail, it may
28 sound like we are talking about merits of the case, it's
24 important that we underscore that the presumption of innocence
25 pertains to Mr. Epstein, now and until such time, if it comes,
