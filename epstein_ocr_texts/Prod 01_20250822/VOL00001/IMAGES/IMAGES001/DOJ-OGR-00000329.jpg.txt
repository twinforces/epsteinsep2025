Dear Judge Berman?

The Government respectfully submits this letter in, response tothe defendant’s Motion, for
Pretrial Release (the “Release Motion”), dated.July 11,2019 (Dkt. 6), and in, further, support of its
Memorandum in Support of Detention (the “Detention Memo”), submitted to Magistrate, Judge
Pitman-on July 8,201.9, which is attached hereto and incorporated herein (Ex. A).

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

The défendant is a scrial sexual ‘predator who is charged with abusing underage girls for
years. A. grand. jury has. returned an. .indietment’ alleging that he sexually exploited dozens of
minors, including, girls as young, as 14 years ‘old, in New York:and. Florida. To this day; he is a
registered sex offender designated. by’New York; State in the highest. category’ of risk-to reoffend,
despite unsuccessfully’ attempting to have that classification lowered. And, any doubt that: the
defendant-is:unrepentant,and unreformed:was climinated when law enforcement agents discovered
hundreds, or thousands of tude and séniinude photégraphs of*young. females, in his Manhattan,
mansion on the night of: his: arrest,, more than a.decade after.he was first convicted ‘of:a.sex. crime
involving a juvenile.

The defendant also faces substantial evidence of his guilt, founded on. the corroborated.
testimony’ of nunicrous victims, and. this, case presents, the ‘very real ‘possibility ‘that. he will, go, to
prison-for the rest ofthis life. The defendant. has at his disposal a-vast fortune, the details of'which.
remain largely concealed ‘from the Court, He also has a. history of obstruction and. manipulation,
of witnesses, including, as detailed. herein, as recently as within the ‘past year, when, media. reports
about his conduct reemerged. And. he continues to: show’ a ‘shocking lack of understanding of the
gravity’ of the harm he has perpetrated, including through ‘the minimization of his conduct and
casual disparagement-of victims ‘in-his arguments.

Against this backdrop of significant—and rapidly-cxpanding—cvidence, serious charges,

and. the prospect. of.a lengthy: prison sentence, the defendant. proposcs to be released on conditions
that are wocfully inadequate. The Release Motion misconstrues and misunderstands the relevant:
