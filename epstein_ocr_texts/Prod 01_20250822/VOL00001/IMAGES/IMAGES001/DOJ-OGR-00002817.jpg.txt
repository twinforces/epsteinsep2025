they have not demonstrated the relevance of all of the evidence they seek.”). The Defendant simply
cannot demonstrate that a// of the information submitted on behalf of a// of BSF’s clients would
be relevant and admissible in this matter.*

Further, the Defendant has made it clear that she seeks to use the “EVCP Material” for
impeachment purposes. She has requested not only BSF’s submissions to the Program, but also
any releases signed by BSF’s clients and any compensation received by BSF’s clients. The
Defendant already attempted to obtain information about Annie Farmer’s compensation by the
Program in Ms. Farmer’s recently dismissed civil action against the Defendant. In the Defendant’s
submissions in that matter, she explicitly stated that she sought the information in order to impeach
Ms. Farmer if she were to testify at her criminal trial:

By contrast, there is substantial evidence that [Ms. Farmer] and [BSF] filed this

case with a serious ulterior motive to fabricate a story against Ms. Maxwell some

24 years after the fact. The motives include, but are not limited to, increasing the

cash consideration that she might receive from the Epstein Victims Compensation

Program (“EVCP”). . . . Just as [Ms. Farmer] has a public right to make her false

allegations in a lawsuit and in the news, so Ms. Maxwell should have the right to

make public the simple fact that plaintiff did not have a desire for “justice,” she had

a desire for money. . .

Second, as previously explained, Ms. Farmer has publicly self-identified as one of

the accusers mentioned in the indictment in the criminal case, 20-cr-330 (AJN). She

will no doubt be one of the prosecution’s key witnesses. The inability to obtain an

unredacted copy of the release, including the consideration received by Ms. Farmer,

creates legal prejudice to Ms. Maxwell’s ability to confront Ms. Farmer during her

criminal trial on general issues of bias and motive for fabrication, as is her right

under the Confrontation Clause of the United States Constitution.

(LGS-DCF) (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 30, 2020), ECF No. 108 (“Certainly, the amount of money that [Ms.
Farmer] has been offered by the [EVCP] in exchange for her un-tested story will be an issue in the
upcoming criminal trial when plaintiff takes the stand, for the first time, and faces
cross-examination. . . . The motive for fabrication could not be clearer.”).4 Thus, the “EVCP
3 Further, a Rule 17 subpoena may not be used to seek the prior statements of an anticipated
trial witness. Rule 17 expressly prohibits a party from serving a subpoena for this purpose. See
Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(h) (“No party may subpoena a statement of a witness or of a prospective
witness under this rule.”). The claims submitted as part of the “EVCP Material” include statements
made by potential witnesses.

4 Again, however, even the impeachment value of Annie Farmer’s EVCP compensation
determination is dubious. Ms. Farmer may have received compensation after submitting a claim
to the Program, but that does not show a potential motive for festifving for the prosecution in this
separate criminal action.
