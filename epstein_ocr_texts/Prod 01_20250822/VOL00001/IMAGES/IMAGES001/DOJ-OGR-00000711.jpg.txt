Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document53_ Filed 09/03/19 Page 73 of 86 73

1 forward to the very serious investigation by the United States
2 Attorney of who may have conspired in this case, and that is

3 very hopeful, and we're hoping that everyone who may have a

4 role to this criminal prosecution will submit that evidence.

5 This is about power. This is about many victims

6 having lived in fear -- fear of the rich, the powerful, the

7 famous, fear that the system will not afford them justice. So
8 fear of not coming forward. And fear, of course, is a weapon

9 that the rich, powerful, famous, and sexual predators used to
10 silence the victims. But that is gone for a lot of victims

11 because they refuse to suffer in silence.

12 Finally, it does take courage to speak truth to power.
13 We thank this honorable court for giving these victims a voice.
14 We thank them, even after the death of the defendant, for

15 showing respect for the victims, allowing them dignity,

16 allowing them a voice. We do want truth, we do want justice,
17 we do want accountability, and we do want those conspirators to
18 face the justice system.

19 Your Honor, right now we have two of our clients who
20 would like to address the court.
2l THE COURT: Sure.
22 MS. ALLRED: Then I have a couple of statements on
23 victims who do not wish to address the court.
24 As they come up, we'll give them the opportunity to
25 say either their name or Jane Doe.
