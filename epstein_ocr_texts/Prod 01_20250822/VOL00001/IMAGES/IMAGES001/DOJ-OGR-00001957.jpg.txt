the United States, Codé, Section 3142, the court may order
detention only if it finds that no conditions or combination of
Conditions will reasonably assure ‘the appearance of the person,
as required and the safety of any other person. .in the
community «

In making a bail determination the court must consider
the défendant's dangéerousnéss, if ‘that's raised, and the
defendant's risk ef flight. A finding ‘of dangerousness, if
that were ah issue, must be supported by clear and convinéing

evidence. A finding that. a defendant is a flight wnisk must be

supported by a preponderance of the sviderce:

In a case such as this one, where the defendant is

accused of cértain offenses involving a minor victim, federal
law requires that it shall be presumed that no condition or
combinatiadn of conditions will réasonably assure the appearance
of the person as requined. That"s citing 18 U.S.C. 3142(a) (3).
The Sécond Circuit has é6xplained that, in a
presumption case such as this, a defendant bears a, limited
burden of production, not. a burden of persuasion, to rebut the
presumption by coming forward with evidence that, she does inot
pose a dangér to the Gommunity or a risk 6f flight.
Eurnthermore, once a defendant has met. her burden of product:ion,
relating to these two factors, the presumpt.ion. favoring
detention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to

be considered among those weighed by the district court. But
