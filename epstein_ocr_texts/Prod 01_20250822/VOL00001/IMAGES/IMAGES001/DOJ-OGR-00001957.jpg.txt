1 the United States Code, Section 3142, the court may order

2 detention only if it finds that no conditions or combination of
3 conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person
4 as required and the safety of any other person in the

5 community.

6 In making a bail determination the court must consider
7 the defendant's dangerousness, if that's raised, and the

8 defendant's risk of flight. A finding of dangerousness, if

9 that were an issue, must be supported by clear and convincing
10 evidence. A finding that a defendant is a flight risk must be
11 supported by a preponderance of the evidence.

12 In a case such as this one, where the defendant is

13 accused of certain offenses involving a minor victim, federal
14 law requires that it shall be presumed that no condition or

15 combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance
16 of the person as required. That's citing 18 U.S.C. 3142(a) (3).
17 The Second Circuit has explained that, ina

18 presumption case such as this, a defendant bears a Limited

19 burden of production, not a burden of persuasion, to rebut the
20 presumption by coming forward with evidence that she does not
al pose a danger to the community or a risk of flight.
22 Furthermore, once a defendant has met her burden of production
23 relating to these two factors, the presumption favoring
24 detention does not disappear entirely, but remains a factor to
25 be considered among those weighed by the district court. But
