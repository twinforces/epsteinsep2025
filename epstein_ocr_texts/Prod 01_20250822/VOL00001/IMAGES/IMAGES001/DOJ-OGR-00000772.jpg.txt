Given, Out history fighting for the enforcement of the CVRA on behalf of Jetlrey Epsteni’s man
victims; Wwe Were: quite surprised to learn that the government souglit, the unsealing of grand jury
materials before this Court withoutfirst.conferring with the victims or their counsel, a step-required
bythe GVRA and. reinforced by Joe v. Eénited Staies; 08-80736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro
bono: by undersigned, courisel for amore than a. decade, arose precisely because the government
rights of many: of these very same. victims. It is especially troubling that,
again, proceeded, in, amanner that
have. net, taker

prev! tously violated the
despite the. outcome of that. litigation, ihe

government has oncee

sting that the hard-ledrned, lessons of the past’

‘éption that thé wetins are, at best, ari. alterthouwehe to the

hold. This omission reinitere 68 the ‘pe
current administration.

OF significant concern, the same ‘government that failed to provide notice to the victims: before
moving this Court.to unseal the grand Jurymatertals is now'the government: representing to'this Court
that it has. provided appropr late notice to: the vietims or their counsel and has conducted. a. proper

reviewand redaction, of the maternils it:seeks to release. Several clients have contagied us expressing

decp anxiety over whether the redacnons, were in ‘fact adequate. Consequently, we requested
yesterday that’ the goveriinient adentty which, of our clients were referenced. to the, grand jury. The
government responded. proniptly and provided. clarifications However; we have strong reason to.
believe. that: additional individualsavhom. we: also. represent—were likely :referenced in. those
materials butwere not.dentified tous by the government.

Ttesremains-unclear whether notice: was: instead provided to prior counsel, whether theiromission sas
agovernmentoversight, whether the government does :not.consider them ‘to be victims, or whether:
these individuals were, infact, vot mentioned ‘to: the grand jury. Regardless. of the explanation, this
ambiguity raises. a. serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.

Agni this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that. could expose
x help identify victims in any way—directly affects the. € 's fairness, privacy, conterral, ‘and

prot tion guarantees, ‘Vo ensure those rights are protee ted, itas-essential, thatsthe. protocol outlined
in ‘the rehet requested below is adopted by this Court.
