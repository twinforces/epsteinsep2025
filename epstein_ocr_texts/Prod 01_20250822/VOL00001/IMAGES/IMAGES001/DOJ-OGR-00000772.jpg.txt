See also Kenna v. U.S. Dist. Court, 435 F.3d 1011, 1016-17 (9th Cir. 2006) (fairness and dignity are
substantive, enforceable rights); Jn re Dean, 527 F.3d 391, 394-95 (5th Cir. 2008) (government must
confer with victims before making consequential case decisions); Jn re Wild, 994 F.3d 1244 (11th
Cir. 2021) (en banc) (confirming that CVRA protections are fully attached post-conviction).
Given our history fighting for the enforcement of the CVRA on behalf of Jeffrey Epstein’s many
victims, we were quite surprised to learn that the government sought the unsealing of grand jury
materials before this Court without first conferring with the victims or their counsel, a step required
by the CVRA and reinforced by Doe v. United States, 08-80736 (S.D. Fla.). That case, litigated pro
bono by undersigned counsel for more than a decade, arose precisely because the government
previously violated the rights of many of these very same victims. It is especially troubling that,
despite the outcome of that litigation, the government has once again proceeded in a manner that
disregards the victims’ rights—suggesting that the hard-learned lessons of the past have not taken
hold. This omission reinforces the perception that the victims are, at best, an afterthought to the
current administration.
Of significant concern, the same government that failed to provide notice to the victims before
moving this Court to unseal the grand jury materials is now the government representing to this Court
that it has provided appropriate notice to the victims or their counsel and has conducted a proper
review and redaction of the materials it seeks to release. Several clients have contacted us expressing
deep anxiety over whether the redactions were in fact adequate. Consequently, we requested
yesterday that the government identify which of our clients were referenced to the grand jury. The
government responded promptly and provided clarification. However, we have strong reason to
believe that additional individuals-—whom we also represent—were likely referenced in those
materials but were not identified to us by the government.
It remains unclear whether notice was instead provided to prior counsel, whether their omission was
a government oversight, whether the government does not consider them to be victims, or whether
these individuals were, in fact, not mentioned to the grand jury. Regardless of the explanation, this
ambiguity raises a serious issue that must be resolved before any materials are publicly released.
Against this backdrop, any disclosure of grand jury material—especially material that could expose
or help identify victims in any way—directly affects the CVRA’s fairness, privacy, conferral, and
protection guarantees. To ensure those rights are protected, it is essential that the protocol outlined
in the relief requested below is adopted by this Court.
