sensitive information about them. (Ud. ). The'g government further asserts that:such.disclosure will.
“jeopardize the g government’ S ongoing investigation’ because it, will reveal. to the defendant. the
scope of the government’s investigation and may deter other alleged. victims. from:coming forward
to:provide evidence. (/d. at.1, 3). Essentially, the government ts arguing that disclosure of the
Materials should be delayed because :it:would rather not let Ms. Maxwell know, at this, stage of the
proceedings, who. the government. spoke-to, and because :it.is concernéd that. other people might
not come forward to provide additional. evidence against Ms. Maxwell.

These,are’not the sorts, of concerns that courts have found:may jeopardize,an ongoing
investigation and establish good cause for'delaying disclosure. Courts. typically allow delayed.
disclosure on thesé grourids when inimediate disclosure miay-alert other potential targets of the
inyestigation that they are being investigated or. may identify individuals who are proactively
‘cooperating with the government to gather evidence against other’potential targets. The. cases
cited in the government’s own letter make this clear. See Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at: 531-32
(disclosure of cértain. discovery matérials might “alert the targéts of the investigation and could
lead to efforts by them to frustrate the ongoing: investigations”), United States v. Mennino, 480 F.
‘Supp: 1182,,1188 (S.D.N.Y. 1979) (government’s ongoing investigation into other potential,
defendants. could be disrupted,by disclosure of certain discovery materials). Similarly, courts
often. grant protective. orders in this context when the government.has made a sufficient showing
that disclosuré may'lead to witness intimidation or threats to'their safety. See Wirited States’y.
Urena, 989 F. Supp. 2.253, 262-63 (S.D.N.Y. 20.13) (collecting cases).

The government'has done neither here. The government has not made any‘showing that
disclosure would thwart. an ongoing investigation into other potential targets, or would jeopardize.
the safety of arly poteritial witnesses. Instéad,'the government asserts a. speculative and self-
serving concern-that disclosure of the Materials itimight make. it more difficult to recruit additional.
witnesses for i its existing case against Ms. Maxwell. That is:not the type of “clearly: defined,
specific and serious injury” that establishes good cause to'delay disclosure under Rule 16(d)¢ 1).

For the foregoing reasons, the Court should.deny the government’s requested relief under.
Rule 16(d)(1) anid instead order'the government to immediately produce thé Materials and the
prior statements. ofthese witnesses ‘to the defense:
