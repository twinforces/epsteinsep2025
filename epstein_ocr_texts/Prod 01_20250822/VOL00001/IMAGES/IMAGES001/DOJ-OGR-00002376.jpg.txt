appropriate motion requesting that the Court determine whether the disputed
information should be subject to the terms of this Protective Order. If such a
motion is timely filed, the disputed information shall be treated as
CONFIDENTIAL under the terms of this Protective Order until the Court rules
on the motion. If the designating party fails to file such a motion within the
prescribed time, the disputed information shall lose its designation as
CONFIDENTIAL and shall not thereafter be treated as CONFIDENTIAL in
accordance with this Protective Order. In connection with a motion filed under
this provision, the party designating the information as CONFIDENTIAL shall
bear the burden of establishing that good cause exists for the disputed
information to be treated as CONFIDENTIAL.

At the conclusion of this case, unless other arrangements are agreed upon, each
document and all copies thereof which have been designated as
CONFIDENTIAL shall be returned to the party that designated it
CONFIDENTIAL, or the parties may elect to destroy CONFIDENTIAL
documents. Where the parties agree to destroy CONFIDENTIAL documents,
the destroying party shall provide all parties with an affidavit confirming the
destruction.

This Protective Order shall have no force and effect on the use of any

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in this matter.
