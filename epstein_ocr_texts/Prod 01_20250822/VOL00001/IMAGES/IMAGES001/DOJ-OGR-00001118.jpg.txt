> At her Pretrial Services interview, Ms. Maxwell reported that she believed she had approximately $3.8 million in
assets, which included her London residence worth approximately $3 million, and approximately $800,000 in bank
accounts. Ms. Maxwell was detained at the time and had no access to her financial records and was trying to piece
together these numbers from memory. According to the Macalvins report, these figures are a close approximation of
the value of the assets that Ms. Maxwell held in her own name at the time of her arrest. (/d. at 9). For the reasons
already discussed, Ms. Maxwell was reluctant to discuss anything about her husband and expressed that to Pretrial
Services.
