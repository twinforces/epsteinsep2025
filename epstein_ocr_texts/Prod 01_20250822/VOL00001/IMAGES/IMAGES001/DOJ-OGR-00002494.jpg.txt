1 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, when will the Court be

2 providing us with that line itemed deposition? The reason I

5 ask is, we would just ask for a couple days after we receive

4 that to analyze -- I think an appeal looks unlikely. But once
5 we see the redactions, we would have to make that determination
6 and confer with Ms. Maxwell, who is in custody, as you know. I
7 would just ask for a little bit of leeway to be able to do

8 those two things.

9 THE COURT: Yes, ma'am. I expect you will receive it
10 in the next day or two. But if you don't and you need extra

11 time, let me know.

12 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor.

13 The last one, your Honor, is with regards, since we

14 are all together, to the issue of the third round of unsealing.
15 Because we already provided notice to Does 1 and 2, we are not
16 providing notice to them, I understand.

17 But there is a little bit of a gray area within the

18 protocol as to how to calculate days for objections because

19 they normally flow from the date on which a nonparty receives
20 notice.
21 And so if I could ask for a date certain, preferably,
22 given the other obligations, a week from this Friday, that
28 would allow us enough time to get those objections done as
24 well.
25 THE COURT: Ms. McCawley, is that OK with you?
