MS.. MENNINGER: Your Honor, when will the Court be

providing us with that line itemed deposition? The reason I

ask is, wé ‘wotild just ask for a couple days after we receive

that to andlyze == I think an appedl looks unlikely. But 6nce

we see the redactions, ‘we would have to make that determination

and confer with Ms. Maxwell, who is in custody, as you know. I
would just ask for a little bit of leeway to be able to do

those two things.

THE COURT: Yes, matam. I expect you will. receive it

in the next. day or two. But if you don't and you need extra

time, Let me know.

MS. MENNINGER: Thank yoti, your Honor.

The last one; your’ Honor; 18 with regards, since we

are all. together, to the issue of the third round of unsealing.

Because we already provided notice to Does 1 and 2, we are not,

providing notice to them, I understand.
But there is a4 little bit of a gray aréa within the

protocol as to how to calculate days for objections because

they normally flow from the date on which a nonparty receives

NoLucée .

And 86 if I could ask for a date certain, preferably,

given the other obligations, a week. from this Friday, that

would allow us enough time to get those objections done as

THE COURT: Ms. McCawléy, i5 that. OK with you?
