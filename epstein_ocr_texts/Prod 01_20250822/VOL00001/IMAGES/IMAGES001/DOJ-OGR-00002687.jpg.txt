(quoting Grunewald y. United States, 353. U.S. 391, 397 (1957)). Thus, whether Ms. Maxwell's
alleged conduct ‘with respect to Minor Victim-3 constituted an overt. actin furtherance of the

Tn United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d.14 (D.D.C. 1998), for example, the defendant
was charged with. conspiracy, and causing false statements to bé made to the Federal Election
Commission, in.connection with an.alleged scheme to. obtain illegal campaign contributions from

concealment of the alleged conspiracy. The courtexpressed concern that “the allegations

whether and how the acts of concéalment alleged. in the indictment were ‘within the scope ofthe.

alleged scope ofthe conspitatorial agreement, her motion.to. strike would be granted. Jd. at 26.

Maxwell’s interactions with Accuser-3 in. England furthered a conspiracy'to catise Accusér- 1,
