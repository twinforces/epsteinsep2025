matcrials, in the MDC. Although, defense counsel have not: yet been able to fully review’ the:
‘materials, which are voluminous, it ‘is: apparent that the witness ‘interviews contain exculpatory or
otherwise favorable information for Ms. Maxwell, which the’ defense has an obligation to
‘investigate. A number of‘these witnesses ‘may testify as part of the defense case. Even if defense:
