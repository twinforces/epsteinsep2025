The district court granted the motion. In requiring Maxwell to answer highly intrusive
questions “relating to [her] own sexual activity” and “her knowledge of the sexual activity of
others,” the court held that Maxwell’s “privacy concerns are alleviated by the protective order in
this case.”

Secure in the belief that the Protective Order would be honored, Maxwell appeared at a
second deposition, in July 2016, and answered hundreds of pages worth of questions about Jj

Count Six of the superseding indictment alleges that Maxwell provided false testimony
when she testified during her July 2016 deposition that: (1) she could not recall whether sex toys
or devices were used in sexual activities at Epstein’s Palm Beach house; (2) she did not know
whether Epstein possessed sex toys or devices used in sexual activities; (3) she wasn’t aware that
Epstein was having sexual activities with anyone other than herself when she was with him; and
(4) she never gave anyone, including Accuser-2?, a massage.

3 The indictment refers to the accusers as Minor Victim-1, Minor Victim-2, and Minor Victim-3.
We will refer to them as Accuser-1, Accuser-2, and Accuser-3.
