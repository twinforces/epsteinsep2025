declines to provide the Court with information about her financial resources; and. (4) she appears

things, the: proposed bail package contemplates the defendant. pledging as. the sole’ security a.
‘property that is beyond the territory and judicial reach of the United. States, and which therefore is
of'no value as collateral. She proposes six unidentified co-signers, an unknown number of whom.
even, reside in the United, States, and none of whose assets are identified. The Court and, the

co-signers are themscelv.es:so wealthy. that it would be ‘no financial burden, whatsoever to, do so.
The defendant does not identify what:residence. she. proposes:to live at:in the Southern District of
New York, ‘nor does she identify any meaningful tics to the area. And, most importantly, the
defendant?s memorandum ‘provides the: Court. with no, information whatsoever about her own
finances or her. aceess'to the wealth.of others, declining to provide:the: Court:the: very: information.
that would. inform. any decision, about. whether a bond is even meaningful to the defendant — and.
which the Govertiment submits. would reveal.‘the. defendant's finaneial.:means to flée and. live

comfortably abroad for the rest. of her life.
