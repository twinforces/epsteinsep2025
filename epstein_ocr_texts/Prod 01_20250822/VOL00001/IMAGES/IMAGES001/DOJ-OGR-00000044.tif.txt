indictment was denied, her trial proceeded, and she
is now serving a 20 year sentence. In light of
the disparity in how the circuit courts interpret the
enforceability of a promise made by the “United
States,” Maxwell’s motion to dismiss would have
been granted if she had been charged in at least four
other circuits (plus the Eleventh, where Epstein’s
agreement was entered into). This inconsistency in the
law by which the same promise by the United States
means different things in different places should be
addressed by this Court.
PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

A. Entry of the Non-Prosecution Agreement.

In September 2007, after an extended period of
negotiation with high-level representatives of the
United States that included Main Justice, Jeffrey
Epstein entered into a non-prosecution and plea
agreement (“NPA”) with the United States Attorney’s
Office for the Southern District of Florida. (App.24-
38). In return for pleading guilty to state charges in
Florida, receiving and serving an eighteen-month
sentence, and consenting to jurisdiction and liability
for civil suits under 18 U.S.C. § 2255, the United
States agreed not to prosecute Epstein in the Southern
District of Florida for the offenses from 2001-2007
then under investigation. In addition, after lengthy
negotiations, the United States agreed that “[iJn
consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty
and provide compensation in the manner described
above, if Epstein successfully fulfills all of the terms of
this agreement, the United States also agrees that it
will not institute any criminal charges against any
potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but not
limited to [four named individuals].” (App.30-31).
