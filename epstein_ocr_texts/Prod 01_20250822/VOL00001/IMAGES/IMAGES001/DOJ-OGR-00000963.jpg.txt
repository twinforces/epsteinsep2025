Ms. Maxwell’s Response. The Court should exercise its discretion to grant bail to Ms.
Maxwell, on the strict conditions proposed below (or as modified by the Court), for two
compelling reasons.

First, the COVID-19 crisis and its impact on detained defendants warrants release. As
this Court has noted, the COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented health risk to
incarcerated individuals, and COVID-19-related restrictions on attorney communications with
pretrial detainees significantly impair a defendant’s ability to prepare her defense. Simply put,
under these circumstances, if Ms. Maxwell continues to be detained, her health will be at serious
risk and she will not be able to receive a fair trial. (See infra Section I, pages 5 to 9).

Second, the Court should grant bail because the government has not met its burden under
the Bail Reform Act and controlling case law. The presumption relied on by the government
may be rebutted, and is so here. Ms. Maxwell has strong ties to the community: she is a U.S.
citizen and has lived in this country for almost 30 years; she ran a non-profit company based in
the United States until the recent media frenzy about this case forced her to wind it down to
protect her professional colleagues and their organizations; and she has very close ties with
family members and friends in New York and the rest of the country. Nor does her conduct
indicate that she is a flight risk: she has no prior criminal record; has spent years contesting civil

the time of Epstein’s arrest until the present, with her counsel in regular contact with the
government. She did not flee, but rather left the public eye, for the entirely understandable
