Re: — Request for Permission to Submit Letter Motion in Excess of Three Pages
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,
Pursuant to your Revised Individual Practices in Criminal Cases, specifically Practice 2.B, we
request permission to exceed the three-page limitation and submit contemporaneously to
chambers the letter motion (“motion,”) under seal, which is eight pages, exclusive of the
attachments. We felt that a substantial amount of background and factual information was
necessary to place the relief requested in the motion into context. Counsel for Ms. Maxwell spent
considerable time editing the motion to eliminate extraneous information and present the motion
as succinctly as possible.
Respectfully Submitted,
Jeffrey S. Pagliuca
CC: Counsel of Record (via ECF)
