The dangér Maxwell miist be taken seriously. She Has.
associates across the globe, some of great means,

She also has, démonstratéed contempt for otir legal
system by committing perjury, all of which indicate to me that
shé is a significant flight risk.

We may never know how many people were victimized by
Ghislaine Maxwell, but those of uS who survived implore this
court to detain her until she is forced to stand trial and
answer for her crimes.

Thank. you, your Honor.

THE COURT: Thank you, Ms, Farmer, All right.

And, Ms. Moe, is ‘the government, aware of any other
victims who aré entitled to == alleged victims who. are entitled
to and wish, to be heard at this proceeding?

MS; MOE: No, your H6nor. Thank you:

THE COURT: And, Ms. Moe, again, just to confirm,

because thére was allusion in the statements 6f the vieétims té

fear and danger, the government 1s not seeking the count to
make dny findings regarding danger to the community in coming
to its ultimate conclusion, regarding pretrial detention,
correct?

MS, MOE: That's correct, your Honor.

THE COURT: All right. Ms. Moe; anything further
before I hear from Mr. Cohen?
