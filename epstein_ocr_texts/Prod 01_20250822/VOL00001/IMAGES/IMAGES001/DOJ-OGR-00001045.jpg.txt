1 The danger Maxwell must be taken seriously. She has

2 associates across the globe, some of great means.

3 She also has demonstrated contempt for our legal

4 system by committing perjury, all of which indicate to me that
5 she is a significant flight risk.

6 We may never know how many people were victimized by

7 Ghislaine Maxwell, but those of us who survived implore this

8 court to detain her until she is forced to stand trial and

9 answer for her crimes.

10 Thank you, your Honor.

11 THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Farmer. All right.

12 And, Ms. Moe, is the government aware of any other

13 victims who are entitled to -- alleged victims who are entitled
14 to and wish to be heard at this proceeding?

15 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you.

16 THE COURT: And, Ms. Moe, again, just to confirm,

17 because there was allusion in the statements of the victims to
18 fear and danger, the government is not seeking the court to

19 make any findings regarding danger to the community in coming
20 to its ultimate conclusion regarding pretrial detention,
al correct?
22 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: All right. Ms. Moe, anything further
24 before I hear from Mr. Cohen?
25 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you very much.
