No..20-2413 (2d Cir. July 30, 2020), ECF No.. 10-1 (explaining the Defendant’s “concerns that.
[Ms. Giuffre] and [BSF] ‘were acting as cither express or de facto agents of the government” and.
falscly accusing BSF of leaking: a confidential deposition. transcript. to the: Government). The
Subpoena, which sccks, for example, communications between BSF and the Government and
BSF’s submissions on behalf’ of its. clients to an independent claims program administered, by
Jeffrey Epstcin’s Estate, is a transparent. attempt, to further this false narrative and. to fish, for

well beyond the scope of a permissible Rule: !'7(¢) subpoena. The Defendant’ s motion to, authorize
service of the Subpoena, on.BSF should be denied."

Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure Rule governs nonparty subpoenas
in.criminal proceedings. Rule.17(c) “was.not intended to provide a means of'discovery for'criminal
cases.” United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 698 (1974); see-also, eg., United States v. Barnes,
560'F. App’x 36, 39' (2d Cir. 2014) (“Rule 17 subpoenas are properly ‘used.to obtain admissible
evidence, not as .a. substitute, for discovery.”); United States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547,. 553
(S:D.N.Y. 1995) (explaining that although the civil rules permit subpoenas “to seck production of
documents. orother matérials Which, although-not themselves admissiblé, could Icad to admissible
evidence,” criminal “Rule 17(c) cannot be used to obtain. leads as to the existence of additional
documentary evidence or to seek information relating to the: defendant’s casc” (internal quotation,
marks omitted)). Accordingly, a party seeking a Rule 17(c) subpocna ‘must demonstrate:

(1) that the documents, are evidentiary and relevant, (2) that'they are not otherwise

procurable reasonably: in. advance of*trial by exercise of duc diligence; (3,) that.the.
A motion to quash the Subpoena i isnot yet:ripe: because, without having the benefit of the:
Defendant’s sealed. bricfing onher motion and. any other orders pertaining to it, it appears that the
Court ‘has not: granted, Defendant’s motion for an. order authorizing service of the Subpoena on.
BSF. The Court, however, should ¢xercisé its discretion and:deny the Defendant’s motion. See
United Statesv. Weissmiin, No. 01. Cr. ‘529 (BSJ), 2002. WL, 1467845, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July’ 8,
2002) (“Rule: 17(c) expressly commits the: decision whether to require pre- -trial production of
documents'to the sound.discretion, of the court.”). Should the Court: wish-to hear further:from BSF
prior to deciding the Motion, BSF is, prepared to appear before the Court and/or move 'to intervene
and. to quash the Subpoena.
