Agreement. The Non-Prosecution Agreement does not bar the United States from bringing

federal criminal charges against Epstein for the offenses set forth in the Non-Prosecution

Agreement in any other district in the nation.'! See, e.g., United States v. Cain, 587 F.2d 678,

680 (Sth Cir. 1979) (“Where ... the prosecutor is not found to have made promises relating to

nonprosecution of charges in another district and the [defendant] is not found to have relied on

such alleged promises, this Court will affirm the trial court’s denial of a motion to dismiss the

subsequent prosecutions.”). Neither does the Non-Prosecution Agreement bar prosecution in any

district for offenses not identified in the agreement.

Petitioners contend that the CVRA gives a victim the right to confer with the attorney for
the government before there is a disposition of contemplated, but-not-yet-filed federal criminal
charges arising from offenses against the victim. But, although the government disputes that the
CVRA creates such a right,'? the Petitioners have never been denied any such right. The
Petitioners have had and still have the ability confer to with the attorney for the government
about potential federal criminal charges against Epstein and about the potential disposition of
any such charges, should they be filed. In fact, Petitioners are free to approach the United States
Attorney’s Offices in districts such as the Southern District of New York and the District of New
Jersey — whose authority to institute criminal charges against Epstein in their districts has not

"| Significantly, under the governing provision of the United States Attorney’s Manual, the
USAO-SDFL did not have the authority to unilaterally bar Epstein’s prosecution in any other
district in the country:

No district or division shall make any agreement, including any agreement not to

prosecute, which purports to bind any other district(s) or division without the

express written approval of the United States Attorney(s) in each affected district

and/or the Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division.

USAM 9-27.641 (Multi-District (Global) Agreement Requests).

'? The government acknowledges that this Court has nonetheless ruled that “as a matter of
law the CVRA can apply before formal charges are filed,” DE 99 at 10; see also id. at 6-9, but
has not yet determined “whether the particular rights asserted here attached,” id. at 10.
