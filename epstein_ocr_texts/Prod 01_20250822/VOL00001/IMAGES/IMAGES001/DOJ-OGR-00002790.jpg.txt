Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document171 Filed 03/23/21 Page 10o0f18

Reform Act, Ms. Maxwell must bereleased-unless there are "no conditions” that would
reasonably assure her-presence. Here, the proposed bail package - uniquely streiigthened
‘by’Ms. Maxwell’s agreement to renunciate her foreign citizenship and have assets
monitored. by a retired federal district court judge - satisfies the actual governing standard.
To find there are absolutely no conditions to satisfy flight risk of.a 59-year-old
‘woman with. no criminal history, who: poses no danger to the community, who has ‘made
America-her. home for. thei past 30 years, and who has. established. strong roots and forged
‘important connections with family and friends who reside here, ‘is ineredulous. The
concems regarding foreign. citizenship and restraint of assets have been addressed. To say:
that, renunciation of forcign. citizenship and strict, monitoring of assets. by a‘retired federal
district court judge does not suffice when, combined with an cight-figure; bond. secured by
real property and cash, and the strictest terms of home confinement and. ¢lectronic
monitoring strains credulity. The government gains a strategic advantage cach day Ms.
Maxwell remains. in .custody— her case is tried daily inthe court of public opinion based.
on.allegations that are: inadmissible ina court of law; the likelihood of seating jurors who
are not implicitly biased.against her is being severely jeopardized; her-physical strength
and concentration are becoming increasingly impaired by, the conditions :of her
confinement; and she. is being denicd.a full.and fair opportunity to'prepare her case for.
