from the counties that overlap both courthouses; and (4) the clerical error by which voters who
had registered with an alternate mailing address were excluded from jury selection. (Schulte Br.
at 19 -- 22; Schulte Reply at 11-15.) For the following reasons, the Court concludes that these :
allegations do not offend the JSSA.

The Government’s Decision. The Government’s appropriate decision to seek the |
Indictment in White Plains was entirely proper and in accordance with the Constitution, JSSA, |
and customary practice. See supra 11-13. Accordingly, this prosecutorial decision cannot be |
said to contravene the JSSA. |

Exclusion of Inactive Voters. In United States v. Allen, 2021 WL 431458, at *10, Judge ,
Roman addressed the issue of whether the exclusion of inactive voters from certain counties used :
by White Plains violated the ISSA. See id. Judge Roman concluded that the exclusion did not, |
reasoning that it is “entirely logical for a jury selection process to exclude individuals who have
since moved,” see id., and even if it did, that the defect was merely a “technical violation” of the :
JSSA. Id. Because the Court agrees with this reasoning on all counts, it concludes that the
exclusion of inactive voters here does not violate the JSSA.

Erroneous Proration & Alternate Mailing Address. Lastiy, Schulte argues that |
prospective jurors from the overlapping counties of Westchester, Putnam, and Rockland were
incorrectly prorated between the two courthouses, and that a technical glitch inadvertently
excluded jurors who had registered to vote with alternate mailing addresses. (Schulte Br, at 21—
22; Schulte Reply at 13-14.) The Court is unpersuaded. As to the former contention, Schulte
does not explain how the alleged proration error constitutes a “substantial” violation of the JSSA, |
especially where its “effect” appears to be “minimal.” Allen, 2021 WL 431458, at *11 (rejecting
the same argument on the basis that it was merely a “technical violation of the ISSA”). As to the :
