WILLIAM JULIE
AVOCAT A LA COUR — ATTORNEY AT LAW

17. This concern .over. opportunistic: nationality applications is preciscly the justification. of
the:rule mentioned. in academic literature (sec ‘for example Répertoire de droit pénal et
de procédure penile Extradition,Pén. — Conditions défond del'extradition —

Delphine.Brach-Lhiel- October 2018, $59).

18. Third, the French Ministry of Justice’s interpretation is contradicted by precedents

and .éase law

19. The French‘Ministry, of Justice’s interpretation finds no support in case law, as no case
can, be:found.where Article 696-4 ofthe French Code of Criminal Procedure-was.applicd

is'the.natural Use. of this provision (for example,-aruling:issued, by the Criminal Chamber

of the French Cour de cassation on 4 January 2006, n°05=86.258).

21..Although. we have: found no, precedent: where French authoritics were faced with. the
extradition of a, person. who had, lost French nationality, we have found. cases where
French authorities were faced with the deportation. of a person who had. lost French
nationality. Both. extradition and deportation allow ‘for the removal. of a person from
French territory by the police and its surrender to the authorities of a third, State, with

the consent and, cooperation. of the authoritics. of that State.

22. The.European Court; of Human Rights (the “ECtHR”) treats extradition and,deportation
analogously. More specifically, the ECtHR considers that the same human rights bars

apply to all types of removal of'a person. from:the territory of a State party (“the Gourt
considers that the question whether there is.a@ real. risk of eatment contrary to.Article
3 in another State cannot depend on. the legal basis for removal to: that Staté. The

Court's own-case-law has shown that, in practice, there may belittle difference between
