11l5a
month federal charges with half of his jail
time being spent in home confinement
pursuant to the guidelines. I told him that I
had no objection to that approach but, in the
interest of full disclosure, I did not believe
that Mr. Epstein would be eligible because he
will not be in Zone A or B.!"" This morning Jay
Lefkowitz called and said that I was correct
but, if we could get Mr. Epstein down to 14
months, then he thought he would be eligible.
My response: have him plead to two separate
Informations. On the first one he gets 12
monthsâ€™ imprisonment and on the second he
gets twelve months, with six served in home
confinement, to run consecutively.
I just received an e-mail asking if Mr. Epstein
could just do 12 months imprisonment instead.
As you can see, Mr. Epstein is having second
thoughts about doing jail time. I would like to
send Jay Lefkowitz an e-mail stating that if
we do not have a signed agreement by
tomorrow at 5:00, negotiations will end. I
have selected tomorrow at 5:00 because it
gives them enough time to really negotiate an
agreement if they are serious about it, and if
not, it gives me one day before the Jewish
holiday to get [prepared] for Tuesday .. .
[September 25] , when I plan to [file charges],
and it gives the office sufficient time to review
the indictment package.
Do you concur?

"7 Sentences falling within Zones A or B of the U.S. Sentencing
Guidelines permit probation or confinement alternatives to
imprisonment.
