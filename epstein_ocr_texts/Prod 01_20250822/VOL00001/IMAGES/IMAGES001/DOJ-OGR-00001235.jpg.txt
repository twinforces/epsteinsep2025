citizens of those countries. The latter condition will restrain Ms. Maxwell’s assets so they
cannot be used for flight or harboring her outside of the jurisdiction of this Court. This should
satisfy the Court’s concern that the proposed bond was not fully secured and left assets
unrestrained that could be used for such purposes. (See id. at 17-18).

In addition, since the last bail application, Ms. Maxwell has submitted twelve pretrial
motions that raise substantial legal and factual issues that may result in the dismissal of some or
all of the charges against her. Ms. Maxwell referenced some of these motions in her initial bail
application (see Dkt. 18 at 19) but was not in a position to fully articulate them until she had the
chance to review the discovery and research the legal issues in advance of the motion deadline of
January 25. These motions significantly call into question the strength of the government’s case
against Ms. Maxwell and the underlying justification for continued detention.

Ms. Maxwell has already been denied a fair chance in the court of public opinion. She
has been maligned by the media, which has perpetuated a false narrative about her that has
poisoned any open-mindedness and impartiality of a potential jury. She has been relentlessly
attacked with vicious slurs, persistent lies, and blatant inaccuracies by spokespeople who have
neither met nor spoken to her. She has been depicted as a cartoon-character villain in an attempt
to turn her into a substitute replacement for Jeffrey Epstein. Yet, Ms. Maxwell is determined —
and welcomes the opportunity — to face her accusers at trial and clear her name. The additional
proposed bail conditions should quell any concerns that she would try to flee. The Court should
therefore grant bail under the proposed conditions so that Ms. Maxwell can adequately prepare
for trial.
