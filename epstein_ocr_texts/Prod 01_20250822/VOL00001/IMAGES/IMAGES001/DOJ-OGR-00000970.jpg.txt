The government bears a dual burden in.secking pre-trial. detention. First, the government
must show “by. a preponderance of the evidence that. the defendant . . .:presents an: ae/tal risk of,
flight.” Sabhnani, 493 F.3d at 75 (emphasis added). If the government is able to satisfy this
combination of conditions could be ‘imposed on the defendant that would ‘reasonably ‘assure his
presence. in court.” Jd.

In determining whether there are:conditions.of release that will reasonably assure the:
appearance of the defendant, the court must consider (1) the nature and circumstances of the:
offense charged; (2) the weight of the evidence agairist the person; (3) the history. and
characteristics of the person; and (4) the nature and. seriousness of the danger to any. person or
the community. that would be posed, by the‘person’s release. 18 ULSsC. § 31.42(g).

In this case, unlike in. the Epstein. case, the: government does ‘not contend. that Ms.
Maxwell poses any danger to. the community, and therefore the fourth factor docs not apply.

The Bail Reform Act: contains a rebuttable presumption, applicable baséd on certain of
the crimes charged here, that no conditions will-rcasonably assure against flight. See18 U.S.C. §
3.142(c)(3)(E). In cases ‘where this presumption, applies, the “defendant bears.a limited burden of
production—not a:burden-of persuasion—to rcbut that presumption by coming forward with
evidence that [she] does not:pose:. . ..a risk of flight.” See United States y. English, 629 F.3d
311,319 (2d Cir. 2011) (quotation omitted). This rebuttable presumption can be readily’
satisfied, Wnited States v. Conway, No. 4—1.1-70756 MAG (DMR), 201.1. WL 3421321, .at.*2
(N-D. Cal. Aug. 3, 2011), and “[a]ny evidence favorable to:a.defendant, that,comes within. a
category listed. in § 3142(g) can affeet the operation” of the presumption. Uiited States 7.

Domingues, 783 F.2d.702,'707 (7th Cir. 1986); see also Wnited States v. Mattis, No. 20-1713,
