54a

e Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts
because, in her view, her testimony responded to
ambiguous questioning and was not material.
The Court concludes that these issues are best
left for the jury.

e Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from
the Mann Act counts so that they can proceed
in a separate trial. The Court concludes that
severance is appropriate and will try the
perjury counts separately.

e Maxwell moves to strike language from the
indictment that she believes is superfluous and
to dismiss conspiracy counts she believes are
redundant. The Court concludes that these
motions are premature before trial.

e Maxwell moves to compel the Government to
immediately disclose certain categories of
evidence. The Court concludes that she is not
entitled to do so, but the Court will order
Maxwell and the Government to confer on a
discovery schedule.

e Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because
a grand jury in White Plains, rather than
Manhattan, returned the S1_ superseding
indictment. Because a jury in Manhattan
returned the S2 superseding indictment, the
motion appears moot.
