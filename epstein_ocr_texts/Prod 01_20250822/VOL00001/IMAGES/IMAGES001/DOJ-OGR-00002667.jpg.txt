Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 144 Filed 02/04/21 Page 19 of 25

Since Bridges, the Court has repeatedly emphasized. that.statutory references to an.
“offense involving” or “offenses involving” certain elements. call for such :an approach. See:
Shular, 140 S.Ct. at 785;-Kawashima v. [lolder, 565 U.S. 478, 484 (2012). (interpreting “offenses
that involve ‘fraud or deccit” to mean “offenses with, clements that necessarily entail fraudulent or
deceitful. conduct”) (internal punctuation omitted); Leocal v. Ashéroft; 543 U.S. 1,7 (2004):
(stating that “offense that . . . involves” language “requires‘us to look to the elements and. the
nature of the offense . . .rather than. to the particular facts” at issue); see also United States v-
Davis,,139.S. Ct..2319, 2328 (2019) (“In all. but the most unusual situations, a single use ofa
statutory’phrase must have a fixed. meaning.”). Thus, only ifthe offense “necessarily entails” the
identified conduct can it be said to be an. “offense involving” that’ conduct: Kawashima, 565 U.S;
at 484.

In United States v. Morgan, the D.C. Circuit-used this approach in interpreting 18'U:S.C.
§ 3237(a),.a venue statute that applics to “[a]ny.offense involving the tise of the mails,
transportation.in interstate or foreign commerce, or the importation of an. object or‘person into
the United States.” ‘The court concluded that “[t]he most natural, reading” of the statute is.“‘to
192, 198 (D.C, Cir, 2004) (emphasis in original), The court.then. gave an illustrative example of
a.case in which a, defendant travels in interstate: commerce, commits a federal offense, and then
returns home ‘via interstate commerce:

[T]he circumstances surrounding the crime include [the defendant’s] travel in
interstate commerce, but his crime isnot an,“offense involving” ‘transportation in
interstate commerce. In other words, a faithful reading of the precise words of the
statute in the order in-which.they are written suggests that an.“offense involv[¢es]”
transportation in. interstate commerce: only-when-such ‘transportation. is an clement
of the offense.
