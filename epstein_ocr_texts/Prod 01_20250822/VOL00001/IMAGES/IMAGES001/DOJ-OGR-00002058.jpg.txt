| have a reputation to hold fast. | treat ths petition serioutty. | don't have lots of cash,
but 1 am putting up $ 2,000 as bond towards her bail becauve | believe in Ghislaine’s
innocence and | beSeve that the only way Ms. Maxwell wil be able to defond herself
against the charges is out on bail Her conditions of confinement are extreme even for
the BOP.
