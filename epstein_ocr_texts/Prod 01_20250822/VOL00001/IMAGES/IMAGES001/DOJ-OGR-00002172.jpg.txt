same arguments it already rejected. The Renewed Bail Application largely reiterates the same
claims regarding the defendant’s ties to the United States and her behavior after Epstein’s arrest
that the Court already found unpersuasive. To the extent the Renewed Bail Application presents
new information, it consists primarily of financial data that was certainly known to the defendant
at the time of her initial bail application and that the Court already assumed could be made
