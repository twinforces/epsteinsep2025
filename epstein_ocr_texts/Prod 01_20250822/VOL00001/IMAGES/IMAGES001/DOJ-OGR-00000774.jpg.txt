5) Defer or Deny Without Prejudice if Safeguards Cannot Be Assured: If adequate safeguards
cannot be implemented consistent with Rule 6(e), Pitch, and the CVRA, deny disclosure
without prejudice.
IV. Conclusion

The survivors support transparency when it can be achieved without sacrificing their safety, privacy,
or dignity. But transparency cannot come at the expense of the very people whom the justice system
is sworn to protect—particularly amid contemporaneous events that magnify risk and trauma. Several
victims have already died by suicide, drug overdose, or under tragic circumstances tied directly to
the trauma caused by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. These survivors have already endured
profound violations of their rights and dignity, both during the years of Epstein’s abuse and in the
years following. To now compound their trauma by sidelining them from critical decisions—
especially in this climate of heightened concern—is inconsistent with both the letter and the spirit of
the CVRA.
The CVRA, Rule 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit authority all point toward narrow tailoring, maximal
privacy protections, and meaningful victim participation before any grand jury material sees daylight.
We respectfully ask the Court to adopt the safeguards outlined above.
Respectfully submitted,
Bradley Edwards
