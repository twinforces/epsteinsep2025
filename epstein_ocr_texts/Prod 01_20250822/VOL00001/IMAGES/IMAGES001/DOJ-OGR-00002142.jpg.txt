52. Chapter V of the French Code of Criminal Procedure (Articles 696 to 696-47-1) sets out
legislative provisions pertaining to extradition.

53. The rule against the extradition of nationals is set out under Article 696-4, which states
that extradition shall not be granted when the requested person is a French national, and
that nationality shall be assessed at the time of the facts in respect of which extradition
is sought (« Extradition is not granted: 1° When the person sought has the French
nationality, the latter being assessed at the time of the offence for which extradition is
requested. »»”’),

54. The rule under Article 696-4 only applies “in the absence of an international
convention stipulating otherwise”*®, Therefore, we must determine whether the rule
against the extradition of nationals contained in the French Code of Criminal
Procedure applies in respect of an extradition request made by the USA.

55. Extradition requests between the United States and France are governed by the
Extradition Treaty between the USA and France 1996”, which supersedes French law
as mentioned explicitly in Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure.

56. Article 3(1) of the Extradition Treaty between France and the United States provides:

“There is no obligation upon the Requested State to grant the extradition of a
person who is a national of the Requested State, but the executive authority of the
United States shall have the power to surrender a national of the United States if,
in its discretion, it deems it proper to do so. The nationality of the person sought
shall be the nationality of that person at the time the offense was committed”.
27 Tn French : « L'extradition n'est pas accordée : 1° Lorsque la personne réclamée a la nationalité francaise, cette
derniére étant appréciée a l'époque de l'infraction pour laquelle l'extradition est requise ».
28 Article 696 of the French Code of Criminal Procedure: “In the absence of an international convention stipulating
otherwise, the conditions, procedure and effects of extradition shall be determined by the provisions of this chapter.
These provisions shall also apply to matters which would not have been regulated by international conventions”. (In
French, « En l'absence de convention internationale en stipulant autrement, les conditions, la procédure et les
effets de l'extradition sont déterminés par les dispositions du présent chapitre. Ces dispositions s'appliquent
également aux points qui n'auraient pas été reglementés par les conventions internationales »).
° The Extradition treaty between the USA and France was signed in Paris on April 23, 1996 and entered into force
on February 1, 2002 (by Decree No. 2002-117 of 29 January 2002).
