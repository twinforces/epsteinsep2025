1 that is, post charge, we have been contacted by multiple

2 attorneys and several additional individuals who have

3 identified themselves as victims and are interested in speaking
4 with the government, none of whom the government has previously
5 spoken with.

6 Your Honor, the defendant is 66 years old. He is

7 charged with appalling crimes, and those charges are supported
8 by significant evidence, including victim and witness testimony
9 and damning record evidence. He faces the very real prospect
10 of spending the rest of his life in prison. He has every

11 motivation in the world to flee, and he has the means to do it.
12 And I will note for the court that this is a case

13 where the government has really put its money where its mouth
14 is on the risk of flight. This district took extraordinary

15 efforts to maintain the covert status of its investigation for
16 many months due to the risk of flight of the defendant -- not a
17 single media report, not a single public statement, no appeals
18 for victims to come forward because of precisely the flight

19 risks we are discussing now.
20 Turning to the characteristics of the defendant, your
21 Honor, some individuals who face significant charges lack the
22 means to flee. Not this defendant. As set forth in the
23 government's submission, in the defendant's most recent sex
24 offender registration, he lists six residences worth tens or
25 hundreds of millions of dollars, including a residence abroad.
