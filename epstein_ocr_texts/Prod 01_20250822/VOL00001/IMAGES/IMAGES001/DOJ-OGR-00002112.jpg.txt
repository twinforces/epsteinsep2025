Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97-21 Filed 12/14/20 Page 17 of 29
Annex A — Questions set out in the Peters and Peters instructions dated 12 August 2020
Counsel is instructed to prepare an expert opinion in respect of the following:

(a) Outline the extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and the United
States, including an overview of the general manner in which the arrangements work
and the general timeframe for UK extradition proceedings in relation to requests from
the US. Address any means by which UK extradition proceedings may be expedited.

(b) Describe the manner in which a requested person may consent to extradition (at all
stages of the extradition process), and the impact of any such consent on the process
by which the requested person may be subsequently removed.

(c) Outline the arrangements in respect of bail pending extradition, and whether a
requested person is likely to be remanded on bail pending the hearing of an extradition
request by the US, and any subsequent removal of that person from the UK. In a case
where a person, subject to prosecution in US criminal proceedings, flees to the UK in
breach of bail conditions imposed by a US court, outline the likelihood of that person
being remanded on bail in the UK pending the hearing of the extradition request, and
their subsequent removal from the UK.

(d) Outline the bars to extradition, and identify those which might, based on current
instructions, be conceivably open to Ms Maxwell were she to be arrested in the UK
and subject to UK extradition proceedings pursuant to a request from the US, such as
passage of time (section 82), forum (section 83A) and physical or mental condition
(section 91). Address, in general terms, the prospects of Ms Maxwell successfully
availing herself of any such bars, given the current approach in UK extradition case-
law and the general thresholds required.

(e) Outline the nature of the obligation for any extradition to be compatible with the
requested person’s human rights (section 87) and identify those arguments that might
conceivably be open to Ms Maxwell in any future extradition proceedings, such as
Article 3 and Article 6. Address, in general terms, the prospects of Ms Maxwell
successfully availing herself of any such bars, given the current approach in UK
extradition case-law and the general thresholds required.
