Finally, there ‘can. be little doubt that the: defendant is in.a position to abandon. millions of
dollars:in, cash and property securing any potential, bond and. still live comfortably for the rest: of.
his ‘life. —These resources, ‘and the case with which the defendant: could flee and, live, outside, the
reach of law cnforecment=particularly'considcring his vast’wealth and lack of meaningful tics to
this. Distriet—make the risk of flight ¢xceptionally high. in this.casc, particularly when considered.

B. The Defendant. Poses a Risk: of Danger to the Community and. of Engaging in
Obstruction of Justice

The :release of the defendant, under any conditions, would. pose a significant threat.to the:
community ‘and to the ongoing investigation.

As described above, where theré is probable cause to, belicve that an individual Has

2008 conviction, it nevertheless ‘underscores the risk he poses, to, the community if released.

Additionally, and in connection with the investigation of:the:defendant’s offense:in Florida,
there were eredible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or
other obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court. documents, there were
discussions between. ‘prosecutors and. the defendant’s then-counscl, about the possibility’ of the
defendant, pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with
reference to. 18 U.S.C. § ‘1512, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or
informant.” For.cxample, in.a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors
‘in SDFL, his counsel, sct forth.a,possible: factual. proffer that included statements’that the-defendant.
had “attempted: to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder'thcir receipt of a [redacted] to'attend an,
official. proceeding” and that the defendant.“in particular, changed travel.plans and flew with both
[redacted] ‘to. the United States ‘Virgin Islands rather ‘than to an, airport in New Jersey iin. order to
attempt-to ‘delay their receipt of'what Mr. Epstein:expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally:
