2000 WL 1134364, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 4, 2000) (Gleeson, J.) (rejecting defendant’s application
for bail in part because home detention with electronic monitoring “at best . . . limits a fleeing
defendant’s head start”); see also United States v. Casteneda, No. 18 Cr. 047, 2018 WL 888744,

Finally, there can be little doubt that the defendant is in a position to abandon millions of
dollars in cash and property securing any potential bond and still live comfortably for the rest of
his life. These resources, and the ease with which the defendant could flee and live outside the
reach of law enforcement—particularly considering his vast wealth and lack of meaningful ties to
this District—make the risk of flight exceptionally high in this case, particularly when considered
in conjunction with the strength of the government’s case and the lengthy sentence the defendant
could receive if convicted.

B. The Defendant Poses a Risk of Danger to the Community and of Engaging in
Obstruction of Justice

The release of the defendant, under any conditions, would pose a significant threat to the
community and to the ongoing investigation.

As described above, where there is probable cause to believe that an individual has
committed an offense under 18 U.S.C. § 1591, it is presumed that no condition or combination of
conditions can reasonably assure the safety of the community. 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3). Here, not
only is the defendant charged with very serious sex crimes against minors, he has already
previously admitted to—and been convicted of—engaging in related conduct. Specifically, in
June 2008, the defendant pled guilty in state court to one count of procuring a person under the
age of 18 for prostitution, a felony, and he currently is a registered sex offender, under
classification level three in New York—defined as presenting a “high” risk of committing another
sex crime and harm to the community. While the conduct presently alleged does not post-date the
2008 conviction, it nevertheless underscores the risk he poses to the community if released.

Additionally, and in connection with the investigation of the defendant’s offense in Florida,
there were credible allegations that the defendant engaged in witness tampering, harassment, or
other obstructive behaviors. In fact, according to publicly-filed court documents, there were
discussions between prosecutors and the defendant’s then-counsel about the possibility of the
defendant pleading guilty to counts relating to “obstruction,” as well as “harassment,” with
reference to 18 U.S.C. § 1512, which criminalizes “[t]ampering with a witness, victim, or
informant.” For example, in a communication from the defendant’s then-counsel to prosecutors
in SDFL, his counsel set forth a possible factual proffer that included statements that the defendant
had “attempted to harass both [redacted] delay and hinder their receipt of a [redacted] to attend an
official proceeding” and that the defendant “in particular, changed travel plans and flew with both
[redacted] to the United States Virgin Islands rather than to an airport in New Jersey in order to
attempt to delay their receipt of what Mr. Epstein expected to be a [redacted]” and “further verbally
