77a

At a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature.
Courts typically evaluate whether a question was
fundamentally ambiguous only after the development
of a full factual record at trial. See, e.g., United States
v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 808 (2d Cir. 1992). The
evidence at trial may shed further light on whether the
questions posed were objectively ambiguous in context
or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them.
In any event, the Court has closely considered each of
the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are
ambiguous. None of the alleged ambiguities Maxwell
identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the
charges. The context of the questions and answers, in
conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could
lead a reasonable juror to conclude that the statements
were perjurious. Truth and falsity are questions for the
jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court
declines to usurp the jury’s role on the limited pretrial

record.
B. A reasonable juror could conclude that

Maxwell’s statements were material
Maxwell also argues that the perjury counts should
be dismissed because none of the allegedly false
statements were material to the defamation action. In
a civil deposition, a statement is material if it has a
natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful
answer might reasonably lead to the discovery of
admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 515 U.S.
506, 509 (1995); United States v. Kross, 14 F.3d 751,
753-654 (2d Cir. 1994). Like knowing falsity, materiality is
an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be
“decided by the jury, not the court.” Johnson v. United
States, 520 US. 461, 465 (1997). Only the most
extraordinary circumstances justify departure from
this general rule. United States v. Forde, 740 F. Supp.
