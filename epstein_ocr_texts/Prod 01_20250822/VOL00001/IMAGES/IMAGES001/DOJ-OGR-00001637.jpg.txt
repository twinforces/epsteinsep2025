Recent Prejudicial Public Statements by the Government, its Agents and Counsel to

Prospective Witnesses

Recent public statements by the Government, its agents and counsel for prospective
witnesses have included presumptively prejudicial information.

On July 2, 2020 Ms. Maxwell was arrested without notice to her lawyers who had been in
active communication with the Government for one year. Because plain vanilla surrenders lack
the fanfare and attendant media coverage afforded to secret, armed, raids at dawn, the
Government chose to invade Ms. Maxwell’s New Hampshire residence, arrest her, and stage a
media presentation that included numerous statements that prejudice Ms. Maxwell’s right to a
fair trial.

Immediately following Ms. Maxwell’s arrest, Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss held
a press conference in which she commented on Ms. Maxwell’s credibility and her incorrect
opinions concerning “guilt or innocence or as to the merits of the case or the evidence in the
case” in violation of Local Rule 23.1(d)(1), (4) and (7):

Per the New York Law Journal:

‘Maxwell lied because the truth, as alleged, was almost unspeakable,’ Strauss said

at a press conference announcing the charges. ‘Maxwell enticed minor girls, got

them to trust her and then delivered them into the trap that that she and Epstein

had set for them. She pretended to be a woman they could trust, all the while she

was setting them up to be sexually abused by Epstein and, in some cases, by

Maxwell herself.’!

As reported in the Washington Post,

Strauss, the acting U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said the socialite told that lie and

others in deposition because the truth ‘was almost unspeakable.’

Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss called the sex abuse described in the

Maxwell case ‘the prequel’ to the charges they lodged against Epstein....

Maxwell played a critical role in helping Epstein to identify, befriend, and groom

minor victims for abuse’ ... ‘In some cases Maxwell participated in the abuse

itself.’
