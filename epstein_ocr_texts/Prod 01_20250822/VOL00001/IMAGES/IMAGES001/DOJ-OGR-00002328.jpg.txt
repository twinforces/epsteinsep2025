section protection does not apply to grand juries). Here, the use of a White Plains jury resulted
in the systematic underrepresentation of Black and Hispanic persons from the jury selection
process, in violation of Ms. Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right.

In Duren v. Missouri, the Supreme Court set forth the three elements that must be shown
to establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement: (i) that the group
alleged to be excluded is a “distinctive” group in the community; (ii) that the representation of
the group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the
number of such persons in the community; and (111) that the underrepresentation is due to
systematic exclusion of the group in the jury selection process. 439 U.S. 357, 364 (1979). Once
a prima facie showing has been made, the government bears the burden of showing attainment of
a fair cross-section to be incompatible with a significant state interest. /d. at 368.

With respect to the first element, there can be no serious dispute that Blacks and
Hispanics are “distinctive” groups in the community. A claim of underrepresentation of those
groups thus satisfies the first element of a fair cross-section claim. United States v. Jackman, 46
F.3d 1240, 1246 (2d Cir. 1995).

In considering the second element—whether the representation of the group is fair and
reasonable—the Court must determine “whether either or both of these two ‘distinctive’ groups
are ‘significant[ly] underrepresent[ed]’ in the jury selection process.” /d. As constituted, the
qualified jury wheels are a proper measure for evaluating the degree of underrepresentation as
compared to the relevant community. United States v. Rioux, 97 F.3d 648, 655-56 (2d Cir.
1996).

While Duren did not define which community is relevant for a fair cross-section analysis,
it is widely understood to mean “the district or division where the trial is to be held.” United
