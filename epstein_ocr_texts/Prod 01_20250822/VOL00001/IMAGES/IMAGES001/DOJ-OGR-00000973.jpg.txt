cases related to Epstein in the Southern District of New York and has sat for depositions in
those cases. Similarly, throughout the course of the criminal investigation of this case,
which has been publicly reported on for nearly a year, Ms. Maxwell has remained in the
United States. Indeed, on July 7, 2019, the day after Epstein’s arrest, Ms. Maxwell reached
out to the prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, through counsel, and
maintained regular contact with them right up to the point of her arrest.

The government’s broad assertion that Ms. Maxwell has engaged in “frequent
international travel” in the last three years (Gov. Mem. at 6) obscures the critical point: she
has not left the country even once since Epstein’s arrest. Ms. Maxwell’s decision to remain
in the United States after Epstein’s arrest and subsequent death in August 2019 is
particularly significant because any incentive she may have had to flee would have been
even more acute at that time. Within days of Epstein’s death, a steady stream of press
articles began turning the public’s attention to Ms. Maxwell—wrongly substituting her for
Epstein—and speculating that she had become the prime target of the government’s
investigation.” Adding even more fuel to this fire, several of the women claiming to be
victims of Epstein’s abuse began publicly calling for her immediate arrest and prosecution.
Despite the increasing risk of being criminally charged, and the media firestorm that was
redirected toward her after Epstein’s death, and despite having ample opportunity to leave
the country, Ms. Maxwell stayed in the United States for almost an entire year until she was
arrested. These actions weigh heavily in favor of release. See United States v. Friedman,
