2 defendant is in the same position as any newly indicted

11 Judge Brodie in the Eastern District of New York about the

12 adequacy of attorney-client access at the MDC. That is case

14 mediator in that case describe the availability of legal phone
15 calls and video calls, video conferences for the purposes of

16 reviewing discovery between detained defendants and their

24 case, and frankly all others before it, to work with the
25 defense to provide adequate communication between counsel and
