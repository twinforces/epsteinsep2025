reference the identities of the alléged victims in conversations with prospective witnesses (Gov't.
Resp. at 2), the defense will be: limited in our ability to /ocafe these witnesses without ‘the:
broader language proposed in. our protective order. It is therefore important. to the defense
investigation and Ms. Maxwell’s right to a, fair trial that the protective order not restrict the
defense’s ability to publicly reference the names of Ms. Maxwell’s ‘accusers ‘who. have already’
chosen to publicly identify themselves.*

Finally, the goyernment’s claim that the discovery will include the identities of
individuals “whom, the Government; does not expect ‘to’ call ‘as witnesses, and, whose accounts—
much, less identities—will. have no: bearing on.'this case” 1s beside the point. (Gov't Resp. .at.
4). Ifthe governiient were prépared ‘to répresent that it will base its, case solély on ‘the ‘three
individuals referenced in. the indictinent, the analysis might be :different. ‘But that is
unlikely. And it ‘goes ‘without ‘saying that since the defense ‘does not have: a ‘single page of
discovery yet, much, less the government’s witness list, we cannot know which of the individuals
referenced in the discovery the. government ‘plans to ‘use as, a witness at: trial, or whether ‘such,
witnesses ‘may be ‘relevant to a potential defense:’presentatron. Accordingly, the. defense needs
the ability: to conduct an. appropriate. investigation and the protective order should not curtail that
ability-;when there is: no countervailing privacy interest to protect.

Witnesses and Their Counsel

The defendant’ S Proposed Protective order: subjects: potential government witnesses and
materials—namely, if. these individuals ¢ are given access Sto ‘discovery materials during ‘trial
preparation in this case, they may not.use those materials for any purpose other than. preparing’
for. trial in, the criminal, case and may fot post. those materials on the Internet. (See Dkt. 29 at 2;

The government construes the defense’s proposal as one that “‘impose[s] restrictions upon
the Government” itself. (Gov. Resp. at. 5 (emphasis added)). It then.:provides a list of other
statutés and regulations. that might iimposé réstrictions. on. the government that may’ be in conflict.
with the protective onder, arguing that: this. possibility for conflict :warrants. rejection. of the
