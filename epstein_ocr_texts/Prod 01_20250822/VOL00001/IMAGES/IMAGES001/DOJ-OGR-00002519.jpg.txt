III. Lost and Missing Witnesses.

The government alleges a three-year time frame for the allegations in the Indictment for
acts purportedly occurring on Epstein properties in three states and another country. Had these
charges been timely brought, Ms. Maxwell would have interviewed, and subpoenaed as
witnesses, the many Epstein employees that were present at the different locations during that
three-year period. None of the employees would have corroborated any of the allegations made
in the Indictment.
