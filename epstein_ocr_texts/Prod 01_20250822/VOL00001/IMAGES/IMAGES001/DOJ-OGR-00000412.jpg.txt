1 The government notes as an initial matter that this is
2 a presumption case because sex trafficking is charged; and,

3 moreover, each of the four factors to be considered in the

4 detention analysis strongly militates towards pretrial

5 detention.

6 So starting with the nature and seriousness of the

7 offense, as previously discussed, the nature and circumstances
8 of the crime are the most serious crime that this court sees.

9 The defendant is alleged to have spent years sexually abusing
10 minors in multiple locations and with dozens of victims.

11 The seriousness of the charge is also reflected in the
12 potential penalties, which include up to 45 combined years of
13 incarceration on Counts One and Two, and the likelihood of a

14 substantial period of incarceration is supported by the fact

15 that the government's evidence is strong. There are multiple
16 individual identified victims in the indictment, numerous

17 specified overt acts, and dozens of overall victims alleged.

18 In order to protect the privacy of the victims, your
19 Honor, I'm not going to go into detail about particular
20 victims, but we can say that information provided by victims
21 has been detailed, it has been credible, and it has been
22 corroborated by other witnesses and contemporaneous documents
23 and records, including from a recent search of the defendant's
24 Manhattan mansion, as I will discuss further in a moment.
25 Separately, your Honor, in just the last 36 hours,
