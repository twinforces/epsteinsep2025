This co-conspirator clause, containing no geographic
limitation on where in the United States it could be
enforced, was actively negotiated at the same time as
the terms of Epstein’s protection for his own criminal
prosecution, which was expressly limited to a bar on
prosecutions in the Southern District of Florida only
(App.26). A previous version of the co-conspirator
language limited it to the Southern District of Florida
before it was amended to refer more broadly to the
“United States,” and the co-conspirator clause was
relocated in the document. (App.95, 108-126). The
NPA also contained an express recitation that it was
not binding on the State Attorney’s office in Florida
(App.30), but it contained no such recitation setting
forth that it was not binding on other United States
Attorney’s offices.

Relying on the NPA, Epstein pleaded guilty in
Florida state court on June 30, 2008, and fulfilled all
his obligations under the NPA.

B. Criminal Proceedings in the District Court.

In July 2019, Epstein was indicted in the Southern
District of New York on charges of sex trafficking and
conspiracy related to conduct in Florida and New York
between 2003 and 2005. The NPA did not pose an
impediment to this indictment because Epstein’s
protection therein had been limited to charges brought
in the Southern District of Florida. Epstein died while
incarcerated on August 10, 2019.

One year later, after Epstein died in jail, Ghislaine
Maxwell was indicted in the Southern District of
New York for her alleged actions as a co-conspirator
of Epstein, on charges that were the same as had
been brought against Epstein. Initially, Maxwell was
charged with crimes in the 1994 to 1997 timeframe,
