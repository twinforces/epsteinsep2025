carefully ‘considered the comments and made ‘changes, or noted comments, as OPR deemed.
appropriate; OPR.did not, however, alter its findings and conclusions.

Finally, OPR, reviewed. relevant case law, statutes, regulations, Department policy, atid
attorncy professional. responsibility:rules as necessary to resolve the :issues presented. in this case
and to determine whether the subjects committed:professional, misconduct.

AS part. of its investigation, OPR cxamined the interactions between state officials and the
federal investigators. and. prosecutors, but. because OPR docs not have jurisdiction. over state
‘officials, OPR did not investigate, or reach conclusions about, their conduct regarding ‘the ‘state
investigation. ’ Because OPR’s mission, is to ensure. that Department attorneys adhere to the
standards of professional, conduct, OPR’s investigation focused on the actions of the ‘subject:
attorneys rather than. on determining the full scope of Epstcin’s and his assistants?” criminal
behavior. Accordingly, ORR considered the, cvidence and:information.regarding Epstcin’s and his
assistants” :conduct as it was known. to the subjects at.the time they performed. their duties as
Department attorneys... Additional:evidence and information that came to’ light: after June 30, 2008,
when Epstein entered ‘his guilty plea under the NPA, did. not. affect. the subjects’ actions prior to
that date, and OPR. did not: evaluate the subjects’ conduct on. the basis of that; subsequent.
information.

OPR’s investigation occurred approximatcly: 12. years after most of the: significant events
relating to the: USAO’s investigation of Epstein, the NPA, and. Epstcin’s guilty plea. As a-result,
many of the subjects ‘and ‘witnesses ‘were unable to recall the details of events, or their own or
others’ actions occurring in 2006-2008, such as coriversations, meetings, or documents they’
reviewed at the time." However, OPR’s evaluation-of the subjects" conduct was aided significantly
by .cxtensive, contemporancous emails among the prosccutors. and. communications between the
government. and defense’ counsel. ‘These records often referred. to the interactions among the
participants and. described important decisions and, in'some instances, the bases for them.

OPR’s primary ‘mission. is to’ ensure: that. Department attorneys perform. ‘their dutics in.
accordance with.the highest professional standards, as would be expected of the nation’s principal
law enforecment agency. Accordingly, OPR ‘investigates allegations of professional, misconduct.
