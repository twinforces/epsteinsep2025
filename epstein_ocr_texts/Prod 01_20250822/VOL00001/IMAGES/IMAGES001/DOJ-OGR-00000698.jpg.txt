the Upper East. Side. She then began to talk a little bit about
him On, our way to His, Housé. I was at his hotise. I was
sexually assaulted by both Rena and Jeffrey Epstein in. his
mansion. It left me feeling both disgusted and betrayed.

As we walked home to the subway afterwards, she
continued to téll mé about thé mah who had just abused mé with
her participation. She seemed exhilarated from the horrific
experieneé. I was shdéckéd and in a daze.» This is a few things
that she had told me. She told, me he went to Cooper Union. He
was a mathematical genius: That He had favorite girls that he
would take to Chanel for 15-minute, all-you-can-buy shopping
trips. She told me his right=hand person had connection to the
arts and the fashion world, and she could help me.

forward to be a voice to the victims who may not be able to
tell their story, or at least not yet. IL feel like L am a,
Survivor.

Thank. you, Judge Berman, for inyiting victims to speak

today before yous We hope the government is listening very

closely to the words we are saying.

THE COURT: Thank you. very much.
