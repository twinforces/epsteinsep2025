1 our age and liked to do the same things we did at that age; so
2 I agreed.

3 On a sunny, crisp day, we took the train together to

4 the Upper East Side. She then began to talk a little bit about
5 him on our way to his house. I was at his house. I was

6 sexually assaulted by both Rena and Jeffrey Epstein in his

7 mansion. It left me feeling both disgusted and betrayed.

8 As we walked home to the subway afterwards, she

9 continued to tell me about the man who had just abused me with
10 her participation. She seemed exhilarated from the horrific

11 experience. I was shocked and in a daze. This is a few things
12 that she had told me. She told me he went to Cooper Union. He
13 was a mathematical genius. That he had favorite girls that he
14 would take to Chanel for 15-minute, all-you-can-buy shopping

15 trips. She told me his right-hand person had connection to the
16 arts and the fashion world, and she could help me.

17 This is not my comolete story. I'll stop here. I'm
18 in a good, stable place in my life, and I had decided to come
19 forward to be a voice to the victims who may not be able to
20 tell their story, or at least not yet. I feel like I ama
al survivor.
22 Thank you, Judge Berman, for inviting victims to speak
23 today before you. We hope the government is listening very
24 closely to the words we are saying.
25 THE COURT: Thank you very much.
