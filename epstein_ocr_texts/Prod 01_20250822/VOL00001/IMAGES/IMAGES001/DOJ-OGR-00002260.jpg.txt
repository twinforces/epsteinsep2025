A brief extension of the time to appeal would also promote judicial efficiency because a
third bail application may moot the need to appeal from the December 28 Order (or, in the event
the third application is denied, permit a consolidated appeal). Conversely, denying the extension
will require Ms. Maxwell to file a notice of appeal on January 11, 2021, which may lead to
unnecessary parallel proceedings in this Court and in the Court of Appeals.

We have conferred with the government and it objects to the requested extension.

For these reasons, we respectfully request that the Court grant a 30-day extension of time
under Rule 4(b)(4) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to file our notice of appeal of the
Court’s order denying Ms. Maxwell’s renewed motion for bail. (Dkt. 104, 106).*

Sincerely,

' In the event this motion is denied (or not granted by the close of business on January 11, 2021),
Ms. Maxwell will file a notice of appeal to preserve her right to appeal the December 28, 2020
Order denying the renewed motion for bail (Dkt. 104, 106).
