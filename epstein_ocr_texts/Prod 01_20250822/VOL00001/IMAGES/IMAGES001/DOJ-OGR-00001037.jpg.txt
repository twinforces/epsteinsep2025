1 information. So we were first notified about the circumstances
2 the morning of the defendant's arrest, but I wanted to

3 personally confer with the agent who was involved in breaching
4 the door and verify that before including that information ina
5 brief before the court. That's the reason for the delay, your
6 Honor.

7 THE COURT: Okay. But the government has done that

8 confirmation process and is confident of the information

9 provided and the basic contention there is -- the basic

10 contention there is that she resisted opening the door in the
11 face of being informed that authorities were seeking entry and
12 there is a suggestion of an effort to conceal location

13 monitoring of some type by placing a cell phone in foil of some
14 kind.

15 Could you explain what the government's understanding
16 factually is and what you think I should derive from that?

17 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

18 And, with apologies, we were very careful to make sure
19 that the specific language in our briefing was accurate in
20 consultation with the agents, so I don't want to add additional
21 facts or speak extemporaneously about that; but, in short, that
22 is correct that the defendant did not respond to law
23 enforcement announcing their presence and directing her to open
24 the door; that, instead, she left and went into a separate
25 room.
