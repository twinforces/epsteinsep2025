Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 97-21 Filed 12/14/20 Page 9 of 29

In three of the five cases the applicant was either a British citizen or had significant community and

family ties to the UK”! but these were outweighed by the risk of flight, and in the other case, the lack of

substantial community ties was cited as a factor in refusing bail”.

23. As to the question in Peters and Peters’ instructions, namely whether a person who absconded from US
criminal proceeding in breach of bail would be likely to be granted bail in any subsequent UK extradition
proceedings, such a person is extremely unlikely to be granted bail. While every bail application falls to
be considered by reference to all the circumstances that are relevant at the time that the application is
made, in practice evidence of both a clear desire to evade prosecution for the offences in the extradition
request, and a previous history of failure to comply with bail conditions, would militate strongly against
the grant of bail in almost all factual circumstances.

D. The bars to extradition that may conceivably be open to Ms Maxwell should she face extradition to

the US in relation to the charges on the superseding indictment dated 7 August 2020
24. The offences in the superseding indictment are extradition offences within the meaning of section 137

of the Extradition Act 2003”.

25. On the basis of the information available, there does not appear to be any arguable basis upon which
the bars of double jeopardy”; hostage-taking considerations”; death penalty”®; speciality’’; or earlier
extradition or transfer could be engaged”*.

26. On the information available, the remaining bars - abuse of process/political motivation; passage of
time; forum; and mental and physical condition - would almost certainly fail in this case.
