Case 1:19-cr-00490-RMB Document6 Filed 07/11/19 Page 10. 0f 16

To'reiterate, the Bail Reform Act:requires pretrial release on the “/east restrietive”
conditions that will assure both appearance and public safety. ‘18 U.S.C. § 3142(c¢)(1)(B)
(emphasis added). Home: confinement:monitored. by:24-hour private security: guards — a-lesser
restriction than. pretrial detention — has proven. effective in mecting, those: g goals in many
prominent.cascs prosccuted in our Circuit, including cases against. defendants as infamous as
Bernie Madoff, Mare Dreier'and David Brooks.

To be clear, defense. counsel. are fully confident Mr. Epstein will appear as: required
without resort'to this. measure.,And we understand. and, appreciate: ‘Your. Honor’s opposition to it.
See United States v, Zarrab, No. 'S-CR-867, 2016 WL 3681423.(S.D.N.Y. June 16,2016). Still,
Mr: Epstein ‘stands ready and. willing to pay for 24-hour armed guards :should.the Court deem it

necessary or appropriate.

More precisely, we realize that Your Honor objects to the measure as: more akin. to
custody than.release, finding it inequitable for wealthier defendants to. “buy thcir‘way:out” ‘of jail
pending trial. /d. at. *2, *9-10, *13 (citation omitted). ‘Nonetheless, a, band-of- other courts in our
area have endorsed the: procedure,’ and the Second Circuit has affirmed its uses

For reasons explained:clsewhere, ‘round-the-clock, privately : funded security guards will
virtually guarantee —not,just reasonably assure — Mr. Epstein’ s. presence inthe circumstances. of
this case. Accordingly, and given the division of. authority. surrounding the practice, we
respectfully propose: it here as a fallback, asking the ‘Court to revisit its propricty despite, the
‘reservations expressed ‘in Zarrah. Those reservations, though admirably motivated, and sincerely
held, raise substantial. cqual protection concerns. They impair the statutory right to reléase.on the
least restr ictive conditions’ in the circumstances presented an inherent | individualized
