successfully to resist extradition to the United States in relation to:the charges in the superseding
indictment dated 7 July 2020.”); Def. Mot., Ex. V 76 (‘It would . . . become a matter for the
French government to decide on whether or not to issue an extradition decree against Ms.
Ghislaine Maxwell”); id 777 (“[I|t is highly unlikely that the French government would refuse
to. issue and execute an extradition decree against Ms Maxwell... .”). Nor-has the Defendant
presented any cases where courts addressed the question of whether an anticipatory waiver of
extradition is énforceable; while.she cites cases where defendants offered to waive extradition,
the reasoning in those cases turned on other factors and the courts did not dwell on the
enforceability of such waivers. See, e.g:; United States v. Cirillo, No. 99-1514, 1999 WL
1456536, at *2 (3d Cir. July 13, 1999); United States v. Salvagno, 314 F. Supp. 2d 115, 119
(N.D.N-Y. 2004); United States v. Karni, 298 F. Supp. 2d 129, 132 33 (D.D.C. 2004); United
States v. Chen, 820. F. Supp. 1205, 1212 (N.D. Cal. 1992). In those:cases, the courts included
such waivers as one among several conditions of release, but they did not make any express
determination that:such waivers are enforceable. ‘On the other hand,-some courts have expressly
opined that such waivers are unenforceable. See, e.g., United States v. Epstein, 425 F. Supp. 3d
306, 325 (S.D.N-Y. 2019) (describing the “Defense proposal to give advance consent to
extradition and waiver of extradition rights” as “an empty gesture.”); United States v. Morrison,
No. 16-MR-118, 2016 WL 7421924, at *4 (W.D.N-Y. Dec. 23, 2016) (“Although the defendants
have'signed a waiver.of extradition, such.a waiver may not become valid until an extradition
request is pending in Canada and may be subject to withdrawal.”); United States v. Stroh, No.
396-CR-139 (AHN), 2000 WL 1832956, at *5 (D. Conn. Nov. 3, 2000) (“|I|t appears that there
is a substantial legal question as to whether any country to which.he fled would enforce any
waiver of extradition signed under the circumstances presented in this case. At any event,
