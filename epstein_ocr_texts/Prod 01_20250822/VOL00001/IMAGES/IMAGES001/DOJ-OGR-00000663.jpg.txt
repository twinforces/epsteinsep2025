1 THE COURT: Well, it may be. Well, I don't know. You
2 say irrelevant.

3 It is a public hearing, and I think it is fair game

4 for defense counsel to raise its concerns.

5 MS. COMEY: Certainly, your Honor. But it is

6 irrelevant to whether or not the motion should be granted.

7 THE COURT: Right. I get that.

8 MS. COMEY: I would also note that the question of

9 Mr. Epstein's death is the subject of an ongoing and active

10 investigation, as has been publicly noted, by a separate team
11 of Assistant United States Attorneys from the Southern District
12 of New York, separate from the team who is handling this

13 prosecution, as well as a separate team of FBI agents.

14 There is an ongoing and active grand jury

15 investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mr. Epstein's
16 death. It is the function of a grand jury and of the Federal
17 Bureau of Investigation to investigate crimes in the federal

18 court system. It is not the purview, respectfully, of the

19 court to conduct an investigation into uncharged matters.
20 So respectfully, we disagree with defense counsel's
al suggestion that the court has some authority to conduct an
22 independent investigation. To the extent any other defendants
23 who are detained in the MCC have concerns about the conditions
24 or believe that the conditions are relevant to a future or
25 current bail determination, it is for those defendants and
