THE COURT: ‘Well, it may be. Well, I don't know. You
say irrelevant.

Tt 45 a public hearing, and I think it 48 fair gate
for defense counsel to raise its concerns,

MS. COMEY: Cértainly, your Honor. But vt is
irrelevant to whether or not the motion should be granted.

THE COURT: Right. I gét ‘that.

MS, COMEY: I would also mote that the question of
Mr. Epsteéin's death 15 the subject of dn ongoing and active
investigation, as has. heen. publicly noted, by a separate team
of Assistant United States Attorneys from the Southern District
of New York, separate from the team who is handling this
prosecutidn, dS well as a separate team of FBI agents:

There is an ongoing and active grand jury
investigation inté the circumstances surréunding Mr. Epstein's
death. Zt. is the function, of a grand jury and of the Federal.
Bureau Of Invéstigatid6n té investigate crimes ih the federal
court system. It is not. the ‘purview, mespectfully, of the
court. to Conduct an investigation inht6 uncharged matters.

So respectfully, we disagree with defense counsel's
suggestion that the court. has. some authority to cénduét an
independent investigation. To the extent. any other defendants
who aré détainéd in the MGC have Goncerns. about the cénditions
er believe that the conditions are relevant to a future or
current bail determination, it is for those defendants and
