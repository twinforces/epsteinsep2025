But this argument misses the point. The defense does not seek to impose any restrictions
on the government’s ability to share discovery materials with prospective witnesses and their
counsel in whatever manner it deems necessary and appropriate. Instead, the defense is seeking
a restriction, not on the government, but on what the prospective witnesses and their counsel can
do with those materials in the interest of fairness to the defendant.

The government argues that the defense’s proposal should be rejected because there does
not appear to be a similar precedent. (/d. at 6). But the defense’s proposal is necessary given the
uncommon circumstances of this case. Here, there are numerous women who may be witnesses
in the government’s case who have simultaneously sued Ms. Maxwell, alleging the same conduct
as that alleged in the indictment. Indeed, the criminal case and the civil cases are already
intertwined because significant portions of the indictment appear to be based on a 2019 civil
complaint filed against Ms. Maxwell by one of her accusers. Many of the accusers have also
repeatedly made public allegations against Ms. Maxwell in the press and on social media. The
defense has a legitimate concern that these individuals and their counsel will impermissibly use
any discovery materials that are shared with them in this case to bolster their civil cases or to run
to the press. As such, it is appropriate for the Court to require that the government’s witnesses
and their counsel, like the defendant and defense counsel, must use the discovery materials only
for the purpose of preparing the criminal case.

For the reasons set forth above, and in our opening letter, we respectfully submit that the

Court should enter the defendant’s proposed protective order.
Respectfully submitted,
