But'this argument’ misses the point. The defense does riot seek to impose any réstrictions.
on the governments ability to share discovery materials with Prospective witnesses and their

in nthe g government's s,case ‘who have simultaneously sued’ Ms. Maxwell, ‘alleging the same conduct.
as that alleged in the. indictment. Indeed, the criminal case and the civil. cases ate already’
intertwitied because significant portions of the indictment.-appear to. be based on. a 2019. civil.
complaint filed against: Ms. Maxwell. by one of her accusers. Many of the accusers have also
repeatedly made public allegations against Ms. Maxwell.in. the press and on.social media. The
defense has a legitimate concern, that these individuals and their counsel will. impermissibly use
any discovery materials that are shared ‘with them. in this. case to bolster their civil cases or to run,
to the press. As such, it is appropriate for the Court. to require that. the government’s witnesses
and. their. counsel, like: the defendant and. defense counsel, must use the: discovery materials only
for. the purpose of preparing the criminal case.

For the reasons set forth above, ‘and in, our opening letter, we respectfully submit that the
Court should enter the defendant’s proposed ‘protective order.

Respectfully submitted,
