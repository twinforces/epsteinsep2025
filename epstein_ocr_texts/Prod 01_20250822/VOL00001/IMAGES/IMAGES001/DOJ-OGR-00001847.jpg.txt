On November. 25, 2020, counscl. for.Defendant ‘Ghislaine: Maxwell filed.a. letter: request.
‘secking an vn. camera, conference, for the presentation of a renewed motion for release, on, bail, and
a.tequest to seal the November 25, 2020 letter in its entirety. The Court required justification for
the'scaling request. On’November 30, 2020, the defense counscl filed a'sccond Ictter no longer
fully:pressing the unsupported request to file the letter entirely under seal and. instcad proposing
redactions to both.the November 25th:and November 30th Ictters.. The Government has
indicated that it,docs not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No: '80.

After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant’s proposed:redactions, which
are consented to by the: Government. The:Court’s decision is guided. by:the:three=part test
articulated by the Second Circuit in.Lugosch'v. Pyramid Go. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.
2006). Under'this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question aré
“judicial documents;” (ii) assess the weight of the common, law presumption of access to'the
materials; and (iii) balance competing considcrations against:the:presumption.of access. Jd.‘at
119-20. “Such. countervailing factors include: but are not limited to ‘the danger-of:impairing law
enforeement or judicial efficiency’ and ‘the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Jé.
