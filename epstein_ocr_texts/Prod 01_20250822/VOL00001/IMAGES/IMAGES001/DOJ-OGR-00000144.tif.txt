States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d 1064, 1070-71 (2d Cir.
1982).

The Court is of course cognizant of the burden
separate trials may impose on all trial participants.
But much of the proof relevant to the perjury counts
and the Mann Act counts does not overlap. In
particular, materiality for statements made in a civil
deposition is broad, and evidence on that question is
unlikely to bear on the other charges here. See Kross,
14 F.3d at 753-54; Gaudin, 515 US. at 509. Although
some allegations of sexual abuse are relevant to both
sets of charges, many are not. At a minimum, this will
expand the scope of the trial far beyond the narrower
issues presented. And while the Court agrees with the
Government that at least some of Maxwell’s concerns
are overstated, there is little question that the jury’s
consideration of the nature of the defamation action
will require a significant investment of time and
resources to provide the requisite context.

The balance of these considerations favors severance.
“Motions to sever are committed to the sound discretion of
the trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d
1141, 1149 (2d Cir. 1989). In its discretion, the Court
concludes that trying the perjury counts separately
will best ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all
charges in this case.

VI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is

premature

Maxwell moves to strike allegations related to
one of the alleged victims from the S1 superseding
indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so
at this juncture.

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allows a
court to strike surplusage from an indictment on a
