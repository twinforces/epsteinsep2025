Attorney's office over the weekend of Mr. Epstein's residence

on East. 7lst Street for the terms and conditions of his sex

offender status, if any? Are there dny' consequences or
relationship between what waS uncovered and whdt hé is. obliged

to do?

MR. ROSSMILLER: May I have one moment, your Honor’?

THE COURT: Yes.

MR. ROSSMILLER: Your Honor, in response to that
question, at the outset. I should say that we don't ‘have

particular interaction with state authorities with respect to

those types of notifications. We are, I would say, in the
early stages of reviewing those materials. With respect to the

defendant's obligations or potential consequences in the New

York State system, we certainly will notify whichever
authorities are appropriate. I don't think that we have a role

other that that.

Twill Say thdt they d4ré éxtrémely concerning with

respect. to bail. here, with respect. to the conduct here, and I
expect we will get into that more in our submissions and, bail

argument.

THE COURT: By thé way, if deféensé counsel wants to
jump int any point, feel free to do that?

MR. WEINGARTEN: On that, we have not seen, the
pictures.

THE COURT: T havén't, either.
