1 Attorney's office over the weekend of Mr. Epstein's residence

2 on Bast 7ist Street for the terms and conditions of his sex

3 offender status, if any? Are there any consequences or

4 relationship between what was uncovered and what he is obliged
5 to do?

6 MR. ROSSMILLER: May I have one moment, your Honor?

7 THE COURT: Yes.

8 MR. ROSSMILLER: Your Honor, in response to that

9 question, at the outset I should say that we don't have

10 particular interaction with state authorities with respect to
11 those types of notifications. We are, I would say, in the

12 early stages of reviewing those materials. With respect to the
13 defendant's obligations or potential consequences in the New

14 York State system, we certainly will notify whichever

15 authorities are appropriate. I don't think that we have a role
16 other than that.

17 I will say that they are extremely concerning with

18 respect to bail here, with respect to the conduct here, and I
19 expect we will get into that more in our submissions and bail
20 argument.
21 THE COURT: By the way, if defense counsel wants to
22 jump in at any point, feel free to do that?
23 MR. WEINGARTEN: On that, we have not seen the
24 pictures.
25 THE COURT: I haven't either.
