told OPR that her reference to “all of the other crimes
and all of the other persons that we could charge”
related to her concern that if the plea agreement
contained information about uncharged conduct, the
court might ask for more information about that
conduct and inquire why it had not been charged, and
if the government provided such information, Epstein’s
attorneys might claim the agreement was breached.”

With regard to immigration, Villafafia told OPR that
the USAO generally did not take any position in plea
agreements on immigration issues, and that in this
case, there was no evidence that either of the two
assistants who were foreign nationals had committed
fraud in connection with their immigration paperwork,
“and I think that they were both in status. So there
wasn’t any reason for them to be deported.”!* As to
whether the foreign nationals would be removable by
virtue of having committed crimes, Villafaiia told OPR
she did not consider her role as seeking removal apart
from actual prosecution.

Villafafia concluded her email to Lefkowitz by
expressing disappointment that they were not “closer
to resolving this than it appears that we are,” and

48 OPR understood Villafaria’s concern to be that if the govern-
ment were required to respond to a court’s inquiry into additional
facts, Epstein would object that the government was trying to cast
him in a negative light in order to influence the court to impose a
sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.

4 According to the case agents, the West Palm Beach FBI office
had an ICE agent working with them at the beginning of the
federal investigation, and the ICE agent normally would have
looked into the immigration status of any foreign national, but
neither case agent recalled any immigration issue regarding any
of the Epstein employees.
