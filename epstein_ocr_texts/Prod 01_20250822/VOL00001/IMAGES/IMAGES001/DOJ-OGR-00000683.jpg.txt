1 to continue because I had been taken advantage of my entire

2 life and had been conditioned to just accept it.

3 It took me a long time to come forward, too long

4 maybe, and all it took to bring -- and all that it took to

5 bring this man to justice has been robbed by his death. Every
6 day, every week I've spent in the hospital since, I've suffered
7 and he has won. Every job offer that's been offered to me and
8 then retracted because of my connection to this case, I have

9 suffered and he has won. Every public humiliation I have

10 endured, I have suffered and he has won. Every relationship

11 that I've had to end because of the abuse that I have endured
12 by the hands of this man, I have suffered and he has won.

13 Every woman sitting in this room today, and all of the
14 women who have yet come forward and who have not yet to come

15 forward and whose lives have been affected by Jeffrey Epstein's
16 sick abuse of young girls, we have all suffered, and he is

17 still winning in death.

18 I refuse to let this man win in death. I couldn't

19 fight back when Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused me because I
20 hadn't yet found my voice. Well, I have found my voice now,
al and while Jeffrey may no longer be here to hear it, I will not
22 stop fighting, and I will not be silenced anymore. I needed
23 him to hear the pain he's caused, what I've gone through
24 because of him. I wrote a 350-page book of all the pain that I
25 have endured at the hands of this man that I really needed him
