press intrusion into her personal space. My consultants conduct meticulous planning and

preparation to avoid such instances.

5. After the announcement of Epsteinâ€™s death on the 10" August 2019, my risk assessment showed
that Ghislaine Maxwell was at substantial risk. It was therefore paramount for her safety that we
implement certain security protocols, which we did.

6. On the morning of July 2, 2020, my operative/consultant i was providing
security and administrative support for Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell at a residence in Bradford, New
Hampshire. He had been assigned to Ms. Maxwell since approximately May 2020. I had
informed | | that Ms. Maxwell needed security because she was being harassed by the press
and had been the target of physical threats by unknown third parties.

7. [| was on duty alone on the morning of July 2, 2020. He called me twice after being
disturbed at approximately 6:30am. He had heard and noticed a helicopter flying above the
general area of the property. He assumed it was members of the press. He telephoned me and
informed me of the situation. At this stage, we believed the press had discovered the property. I
instructed that Ms. Maxwell be informed and she should be prepared to move into a safe room if
any perimeters were breached.

8. At approximately 8:30am, | | noticed and subsequently reported to me that vehicles were
coming up the driveway and that he had approached the vehicles to check what was happening.

9. | | again assumed it was members of the press. He reported to me that he called Ms.
Maxwell on the radio to alert her that the press was on the grounds and approaching the house.

10. There was an established security protocol in place that Ms. Maxwell was to follow in the event
that her security was threatened while she was inside the house. This protocol was
communicated to P| when he was assigned to Ms. Maxwell, and he had reviewed it
with Ms. Maxwell when he started.
