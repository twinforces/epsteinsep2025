Water Management Dist., 647 F.3d 1296, 1302 (11th Cir. 2011) (“If at any point in the litigation
the plaintiff ceases to meet all three requirements for constitutional standing, the case no longer
presents a live case or controversy, and the federal court must dismiss the case for lack of subject
matter jurisdiction.”); Phoenix of Broward, Inc. v. McDonald’s Corp., 489 F.3d 1156, 1161 (11th
Cir. 2007) (“[T]he issue of constitutional standing is jurisdictional ....”); National Parks
Conservation Ass’n v. Norton, 324 F.3d 1229, 1242 (11th Cir. 2003) (“[B]ecause the
constitutional standing doctrine stems directly from Article III’s ‘case or controversy’
requirement, this issue implicates our subject matter jurisdiction, and accordingly must be
addressed as a threshold matter regardless of whether it is raised by the parties.”) (citation
omitted).

In these proceedings, the only identified legal relief that Petitioners have sought pursuant
to the CVRA is the setting aside of the Non-Prosecution Agreement that was entered into
between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida
(“USAO-SDFL”). See, e.g., DE 99 at 6 (recognizing that the relief Petitioners seek “is to
invalidate the non-prosecution agreement”). But even assuming arguendo that Petitioners’ rights
under the CVRA were violated when Epstein and the USAO-SDFL entered into the Non-
Prosecution Agreement, constitutional due process guarantees do not allow either the Non-
Prosecution Agreement — which by its terms induced Epstein to, inter alia, plead guilty to state
criminal charges and serve an 18-month sentence of state incarceration’ — or the governmental
this Court need not reach or address those issues because an analysis of the third prong of the
standing test incontrovertibly establishes the Petitioners’ lack of standing. Nonetheless, the
circumstances which demonstrate Petitioners’ lack of a concrete injury traceable to government
conduct are explored infra in Section II of this memorandum, which addresses how Petitioners’
claims and these proceedings lack constitutional ripeness.
