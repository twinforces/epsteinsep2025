died in 2013). In recent years she has not been in the UK at all, I believe, for any length
oftime, She is a person who my children always regarded as sparkling and engaging,
and dedicated to her oceans conservation work and other business projects.

I would describe her as a woman of principle; very disciplined with an extraordinary
work ethic, instilled by both her parents. She is the youngest of seven surviving siblings,
all of whom are close and all of whom have the same work ethic and integrity.
[have at no point given any credence to the ridiculous and defamatory statements in the
press about her being in hiding fom law enforcement; this has never been the case, She
would just like an opportunity to prepare her defence in an appropriate manner.
lam totally confident that Ghislaine will appear in court as required, and I am prepared
to sign a bond in the amount of $3.5 million in suppost of her bail a pplication, This
amount represents the value of effectively all of m tsi j
If I lost

sc assets because Ghislaine violated the conditions of her release, I would be
financially ruined. I make this pledge without reservation because I know that Ghislaine
will remain in the United States to face the charges against her, which she vehemently
denies.
Yours sincerely
