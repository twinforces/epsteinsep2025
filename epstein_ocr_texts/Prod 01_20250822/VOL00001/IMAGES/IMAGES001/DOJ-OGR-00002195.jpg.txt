Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 100: Filed 12/18/20 Page 34 of 36.

As tothe defense’s most recent complaints, the malfunctioning of the sixth production that.
the defense complains of resulted from. the defendant herself dropping the hard drive orto the
ground, and that. drive has been replaced. ‘When the: defense: informed. the Government that the
drive: containing the ‘seventh production may be malfunctioning, the Government offered: to have:
IT. staff. revicw' the drive. In. response, the: defense, indicated. the drive ‘was. in fact still viewable
and declined to: have IT staff review it. Accordingly; it is the Goyernment’s understanding ‘that:
the defendant. currently has a full, readable set-of discovery: at/the MDC. At.the defense’s request,
the Government is preparing:yct another copy containing all productions to date'on:a.single drive
so that:the defendant will have a backup copy of discovery materials at the MDC." ‘Throughout.
the defendant’s pretrial detention, the Government. has been responsive 'to the defensé’s concerns
regarding, access to discovery and, counsel. The Government. will continue to work with MDC
legal counsel to ensure that the defendant is able'to review her.discovery and.to communicate, with,
defense. counsel, over the seven months still remaining, before'trial.

As to the defense complaints regarding’ the defendant’s conditions of confinement, the
defense: notably. does not suggest that the defendant should be housed in. general population.
Indced, the defense appears to agree that the best way: to ensure the defendant’s safety while
detained is to be away from general population. Unlike other inmates in, protective custody,
however, the defendant is :released. from.her isolation cell for thirteen hours -per day, has her own
shower, has ‘exclusive use.of two different computers; -has her own phone to-use, and. has her own.

television. ‘Those conditions set her far apart from general, population, inmates, not to ‘mention,

' Oni this séoré, thé Government. riotes the tension between, the defense claim. that the diséovery
produccd to date: contains littlc:of valuc.or relevant to the: charges sct forth in the: Indictment, and.
the simultancous claim that the defendant ‘has’been prejudiced by technical. difficultics that have:
temporarily delayed her ability to review ‘portions. of ‘those ‘productions, ‘productions which,
according to the defense; counsel have already. been. able to, conclude ‘are essentially unimportant.
