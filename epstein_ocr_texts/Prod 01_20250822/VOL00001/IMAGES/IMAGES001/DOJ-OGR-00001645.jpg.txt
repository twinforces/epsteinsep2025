Maxwell with respect to using thé criminal. discovery material. solely ‘for the purpose of this
criminal. case.

2. Victim/Witness Identities

Ms. Maxwell’s proposed protective order. prohibits’ Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, aiid
others on the defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity: of any. alleged s victim. or
from publicly referencing individuals * ‘who have spoken on ‘the public record to ‘the media, or in,
public fora, .or ‘in. litigation=criminal or otherwise=relating to: Jeffrey Epstein. or Ghislaine
Maxwell.” Jd. 96. This language, which is neatly: identical. in all :material tespects to. the
language in ‘the: protective: order approved in the government’s criminal. prosecution of Mr.
Epstein, see. United States: -v. _ Epstein, 19-CR-00490-RMB (S.D:NLY. July: 25, , 2019), ensures
appropriate privacy: protections for alleged victims‘and should be approved here.

In. contrast. to the more permissive. language it agréed to. with respect to Mr. Epsteiii, the
government has taken’the position that.Ms. Maxwell’ 5 defense counsel should only be allowed to
public ‘record * ‘in, this « case.’ "The government’ 'S proposal, however, ‘advances. no > compelling
privacy protections, and ‘instead prevents the defense from making reference to, individuals who
have already: voluntarily publicly disclosed their identities. by, among other:things, pursuing civil
suits : in their own name against. Ms. Maxwell and/or Mr. Epstein, Speaking by: name in the public
posting comments under their own names. on "social media, The government’ Ss ” proposed.
restriction is therefore “broader than necessary” to protect: the privacy’ interests of these
individuals.’who have already’ chosen ‘to self-identify, and will hinder the defense’s ability to
conduct further factual. investigation, prepare witnhessés. for trial, and advocate. 6n Ms. .Maxwell’s
behalf.
