came to me Rot. asking to filé a lawsuit against Jeffrey
Epstein, but simply asking for the government to talk to her,
Shé was cooperating ih an FBI invéstigdattion and wanted the
gevernment. to speak with her, and I thought that was going to
be an éasy tasks

It was only a few months later that we learned that
this investigation, that was represented to my client in written
form, that it would be a long investigation, and to be patient.
Basically, to hang tight. It was, resolved by way of a sécret
deal that never allowed any of the more than 30 victims who had
beeh 1dentifiéd of Mr. Epstein's abusé in Florida to ever
panticipate in a single hearing. There was a Nearing. They
were never notified.

I then went. on to represent imany of them in civil
cases and also in extensive pro béno work. And IT can tell your
Honor ‘that while Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of them hurt them and
harmed them for many years, the feelings they had was
aggravated exponentially by the facts that they had no rights
in the criminal justice system, by the fact that they were
treated as iff they didn't matter. They were not allowed their
rights undér the Grime Vicétims' Rights Act to meaningfully
confer with, prosecutors, to be treated with fairness, to be
treated with dignity. That is what this is supposed to bé
about, and to have notice of hearings.

So I do want to thank. your. Honor, and especially the
