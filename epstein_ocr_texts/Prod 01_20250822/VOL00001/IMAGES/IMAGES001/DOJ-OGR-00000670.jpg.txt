1 came to me not asking to file a lawsuit against Jeffrey

2 Epstein, but simply asking for the government to talk to her.

3 She was cooperating in an FBI investigation and wanted the

4 government to speak with her, and I thought that was going to

5 be an easy task.

6 It was only a few months later that we learned that

7 this investigation that was represented to my client in written
8 form, that it would be a long investigation, and to be patient.
9 Basically, to hang tight. It was resolved by way of a secret
10 deal that never allowed any of the more than 30 victims who had
11 been identified of Mr. Epstein's abuse in Florida to ever

12 participate in a single hearing. There was a hearing. They

13 were never notified.

14 I then went on to represent many of them in civil

15 cases and also in extensive pro bono work. And I can tell your
16 Honor that while Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of them hurt them and
17 harmed them for many years, the feelings they had was

18 aggravated exponentially by the facts that they had no rights
19 in the criminal justice system, by the fact that they were
20 treated as if they didn't matter. They were not allowed their
21 rights under the Crime Victims' Rights Act to meaningfully
22 confer with prosecutors, to be treated with fairness, to be
23 treated with dignity. That is what this is supposed to be
24 about, and to have notice of hearings.
25 So I do want to thank your Honor, and especially the
