Il. Rule 6(e) and Eleventh Circuit Authority Require Heightened Caution and Narrow

Tailoring.

Grand jury secrecy is a “long-established policy” safeguarded by Rule 6(e). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol
Stops Nw., 441 U.S. 211, 219-23 (1979). Even where disclosure may be considered, the movant
must establish a particularized need that outweighs the countervailing interests in secrecy, and any
disclosure should be no broader than necessary. Jd. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further
held that district courts lack inherent authority to order grand jury disclosure outside the exceptions
in Rule 6(e). Pitch v. United States, 953 F.3d 1226, 1237-88 (11th Cir. 2020) (en banc); see also
McKeever v. Barr, 920 F.3d 842, 845-46 (D.C. Cir. 2019).
Here, even if the Court were to find a Rule 6(e) path to limited disclosure, victims’ CVRA rights and
the traditional interests protected by grand jury secrecy converge in favor of extraordinary care:
rigorous judicial screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-identification, and
meaningful victim participation before anything is made public. Related privacy provisions reinforce
this approach. See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 3509(d)(2) (authorizing protective orders to shield child-victims’
identities and “other information concerning a child”); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49.1 (privacy redactions).
Many Epstein victims were minors at the time of the abuse; even for those now adults, § 3771 (a)(8)
and the Court’s protective authority warrant safeguards that functionally align with § 3509(d)
principles.

WI. Requested Relief

In light of the foregoing, the victims respectfully request that the Court:

1) Require Conferral and Notice (CVRA 8§ 3771 (a)(5), (c)(1)): Direct the Government to
confer with victims’ counsel and provide reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard
before any ruling on unsealing or public release of grand jury materials.

2) Judicial In Camera Review: Conduct a comprehensive in camera review of the grand jury
materials to determine whether the proponent has shown a Rule 6(e)-compliant basis for any
disclosure and, if so, the narrowest scope of disclosure consistent with Douglas Oil

3) Victims’ Counsel Pre-Release Review (Under Protective Order): Permit designated victims’
counsel to review the government’s proposed redactions and any index of materials under a
strict protective order, to allow victims’ counsel to identify and prevent: (a) direct identifiers,
(b) combinations of data points that could reasonably lead to re-identification or harassment
of victims, and (c) to propose all additional redactions necessary.

4) Dispute Resolution before Unsealing or Release: If the government does not agree with
additional proposed redactions from victims’ counsel, provide victims’ counsel the
opportunity to be heard on any dispute before ruling on unsealing or public release.
