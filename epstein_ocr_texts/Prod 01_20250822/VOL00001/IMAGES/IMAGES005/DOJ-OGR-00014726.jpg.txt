1 AFTERNOON SESSION

2 4:46 p.m.

3 THE COURT: I received a note. Our deliberations are
4 moving along and we are making progress. We are at a good

a point and would like to end today at 5:00 p.m. and continue

6 tomorrow morning at 9:00 a.m.

7 I don't know if anybody wants to say anything. I have
8 a view.

9 MR. PAGLIUCA: I think since they requested to leave,
10 they should be allowed to leave, your Honor. Thank you.

11 MS. MOE: Your Honor, the government defers to the

12 Court for the schedule today.

13 THE COURT: I take it to mean they won't be done in an
14 hour and so they're going to break for the night anyway. I

15 will bring them out and send them home at 5:00 as they

16 requested.

17 I intend to do the following, though, I'll hear from
18 you, but as I noted this morning, in light of where we now find
19 ourselves, given the omicron variant, I must require
20 deliberations every day going forward until they reach a
al verdict. I will instruct them that we will continue
22 deliberations each day on the same schedule until they reach a
23 verdict, so they should make themselves available for the
24 remainder of the week and, if necessary, for the weekend. I'll
25 tell them as I did yesterday regarding extending deliberations
