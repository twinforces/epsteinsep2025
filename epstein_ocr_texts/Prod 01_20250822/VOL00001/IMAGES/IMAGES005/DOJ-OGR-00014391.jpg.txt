1 MR. EVERDELL: Carolyn only, and it would say "sex

2 trafficking of."

3 THE COURT: "An individual."

4 MR. EVERDELL: "Under the age of 18."

5) MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine, your Honor.

6 THE COURT: Taking out "a minor," adding "an

7 individual under the age of 18," and then adding "only" after
8 "Carolyn."

9 MR. EVERDELL: Correct, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: OK.

11 MR. EVERDELL: Moving back to Count Five, it's a

12 Little cumbersome, I understand, the way the language is. But
13 it would say "sex trafficking conspiracy of individuals under
14 the age of 18."

15 THE COURT: OK. Mr. Rohrbach.

16 MR. ROHRBACH: We think it's a little unclear to say
17 "conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of individuals under the
18 age of 18"?

19 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine.
20 THE COURT: So we'll change Count Five to "conspiracy
21 to commit sex" -- how do you want to say it?
22 MR. EVERDELL: "conspiracy to commit sex trafficking
23 of individuals under the age of 18."
24 THE COURT: 17.
25 MR. ROHRBACH: 18 for this.
