trafficking of."
THE COURT: “An individual."
MR, EVERDELL: “Under the age of 18."
MR. ROHRBACH: That's ine, your Honor.

THE COURT: Taking out "a minor,” adding "an

individual, under the age of 18," and then adding "only" after
"Carolyn,"

MR. EVERDELL: Correct, your Honor.

THE COURT:  OK,.

MR. EVERDELL: Modving back to Count Five, it's a4
lattle cumbersome, I understand, the way the language is. But
it would say "Sex trafficking conspiracy 6f individuals under
the age of 18."

THE COURT: OK. Mr. Rohrbach.

MR. ROHRBACH: We thank 2t's a little unclear to say
"“Gonspiracy to commit. sex trafficking of individuals under the
age of 18"?

MR. EVERDELL: That's fine.

THE COURT: So we'll change Count Five to "conspinacy
t6 commit. sex" == how do you want to say it?

MR. EVERDELL: “conspiracy to. commit. sex trafficking
of individuals under the age of 18."

THE COURT: 17.

MR. ROHRBACH: 18 for this.
