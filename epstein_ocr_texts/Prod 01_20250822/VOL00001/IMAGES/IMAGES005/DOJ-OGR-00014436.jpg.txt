1 by herself to New Mexico to stay with Maxwell and Epstein. She
2 thought it had to do with a potential scholarship, and so did

3 her mother, who took the witness stand and told you that she

4 remembered Annie going on this trip with Maxwell and Epstein,

5 and that she thought it was a trip for multiple scholarship

6 students who would be chaperoned by Ghislaine Maxwell. But

7 when Annie got to New Mexico, she was alone. She was alone

8 with Epstein and Maxwell. She was alone with them, with no

9 chaperone, no other students. She was alone with two sexual

10 predators.

11 Over the course of the weekend, Maxwell engaged in

12 textbook grooming behavior with Annie. First, Maxwell starting
13 chatting her up, asking her about her life. She was charming
14 her. Then Maxwell took Annie on a shopping trip. They bought
15 her boots and Maxwell picked out a hair product for Annie.

16 What came next? Maxwell and Epstein took Annie to a
17 movie theater where Epstein began holding Annie's hand and

18 rubbing her foot and her arm. He was doing the same thing he
19 had done in New York, but now he was doing it openly. He was
20 doing it openly because this time he was doing it with Maxwell,
al and he didn't have to hide it from Maxwell because she was in
22 on the whole thing.
23 So what did Annie tell you about next? Well, Maxwell
24 started rationing things up to the next level. Here's her
25 testimony about that.
