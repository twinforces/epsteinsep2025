2 A. I would just estimate hundreds of experiments involving

3 maybe 50,000 participants or more, but it's just a -- it's just

iy Q. Well, let's just focus on a few of those, if we might.

6 What stands out in your mind with regard to

7 experiments that you have done that have impacted the science

8 of memory?

9 A. I would say that one of the major contributions is the work
10 that I and my collaborators have done on the misinformation

11 effect on showing that after people see, say, a simulated crime
12 or a simulated accident, and they are exposed to some

13 misinformation about the accident or the crime that they saw,
14 that many people will incorporate that misinformation into

15 their memory and it causes an impairment in memory. False

16 swayed of the misinformation. It becomes their memory and

17 their memory becomes inaccurate.

18 One -- I guess you could call it a classic study,

19 because it's in many of the textbooks in psychology today is
20 one in which we show people a simulated accident, maybe a car
21 goes through a stop sign that's controlling the intersection.
22 And later on we expose our witnesses to misinformation that it
23 was a yield sign. Many people will now claim that they saw a
24 yield sign instead of a stop sign. So they have succumbed to
25 the misinformation in that new information that was presented
