LC6Cmax3 Kate â€”- cross

2 MS. POMERANTZ: The government is concerned about this
3 line of questioning. She's asking a series of questions about
4 her romantic history. It seems unduly invasive.

5 THE COURT: Just a moment. We had an earlier sidebar.
6 I permitted her to ask questions based on the declaration

7 regarding someone who said she planted drugs on the person that
8 she's now asking a question about. So, how is the objection

9 consistent with that ruling?

10 MS. POMERANTZ: I understand that ruling, your

11 Honor -- my understanding is I frankly didn't know that's where
12 it was going, but it's also my concern is that it's been a

13 series of questions that have just been basically a litany of
14 questions --

15 THE COURT: Counsel, when you have an objection, I

16 rule on it. A series of questions objections doesn't fly.

17 Please bear in mind my rulings, that that is why we do it at

18 the sidebar, that's why the jury had a 45-minute break. I

19 don't need a sidebar every time a question that I've approved
20 is asked.
