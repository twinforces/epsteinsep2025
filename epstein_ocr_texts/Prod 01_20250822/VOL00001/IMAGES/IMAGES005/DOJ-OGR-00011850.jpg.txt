1 MR. EVERDELL: Thank you. You can take that down.

2 Q. So in the 2000s, that's the number you would speak to Sarah
3 Kellen on about arranging flights?

4 A. Correct.

5 Q. Now, regardless of who you spoke to about scheduling

6 flights, when you were told that Epstein needed to fly

7 somewhere, you would need to be given certain information about
8 the flight; correct?

) A. Sure.

10 Q. Like, for example, you would need to be given the date of
11 when Epstein wanted to fly?

12 A. Correct.

13 Q. You would need to be given roughly the time of departure?
14 A. Yes.

15 Q. And you would need to be given the destination where you're
16 going to fly; right?

17 A. Yes. That would be helpful, yes.

18 Q. You might want to follow a flight plan or something like

19 that?
20 A. YSS.
21 Q. But you wouldn't necessarily be told who was going to be
22 going on the flight; right?
23 A. Not at all.
24 Q. If you had someone who was particularly important that was
25 going to be on the flight, you might be told ahead of time?
