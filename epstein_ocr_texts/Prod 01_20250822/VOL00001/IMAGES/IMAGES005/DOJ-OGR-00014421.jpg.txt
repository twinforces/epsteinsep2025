1 in 1994 is backed up by documents. So let's talk about it.

2 Here's Jane's application to Interlochen for the

3 summer of 1994. She weighed 90 pounds and she just finished

4 the seventh grade. There can't be any question that Jane was

22 Interlochen that summer because Maxwell got a letter from
