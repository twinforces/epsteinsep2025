LCHVMAX2 Young â€” direct

1 A. Yes.

2 Q. Anything about what he said that you disagree with?

3 A. No. We try to take notes as accurately as possible and

4 then put them into a 302 document.

5 Q. Okay. And that's what you did in connection with this case
6 as well, correct?

7 A. Yes.

8 Q. So in some cases, at least as I understand it, you

9 physically took the notes and then typed up the 302 later; is
10 that right?
11 A. Yes. Sometimes I took the notes, sometimes my partner took
12 the notes.
13 Q. And your partner is Detective Byrnes?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. And when one or the other of you takes the notes, do you
16 check the other's work?
17 A. We will both review the 302 before it's finalized and sign
18 off on it.
19 Q. And so in this case, I think you just heard Ms. Comey's
20 question to Special Agent Young, these are not meant to be
21 transcripts of the interviews, right?
22 A. No, they are not.
23 Q. It's a summary of what the witness said?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. An accurate summary of what the witness said?
