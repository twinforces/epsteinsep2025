1 deliberate later than that, you're most welcome to do so.

2 Please let me know by note when you wish to stop, but the

3 default going forward will be 6 p.m., unless anyone indicates

a) MS. MENNINGER: That would be our concern, your Honor,

7 THE COURT: As I did last time, I'm going to tell them
8 the default will be 6; but if it's a hardship, they should let
9 Ms. Williams know, in which case -- so, again, the language

10 will be, If deliberations are not complete starting tomorrow,
11 T'd like you to make yourselves available to deliberate until
12 at least 6 p.m. Of course, if you all agree to deliberate

13 later than that, you're most welcome to do so. Please just let
14 me know by note when you wish to stop. But the default going
15 forward will be 6 p.m., unless anyone indicates to Ms. Williams
16 on their way out that that is a hardship. Okay?

17 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.

19 the "If deliberations are not complete." TI think that any kind
20 of suggestion that the deliberations should be resolving by a
21 certain time or not resolving could potentially --
22 THE COURT: That is the precise language I used last
23 week in asking if they wanted to sit on Thursday. It didn't
24 cause them to think that they had to complete their
25 deliberations.
