11 Q. So you didn't specify whether this particular computer was
12 password protected; right?

13 A. That's correct.

14 Q. You don't have any information that this computer was

15 password protected; right?

16 A. In the registry, it said that it was.

17 Q. You were able to get into the computer no problem; right?
18 A. We don't actually get into the computer. We don't go

21 name and all that only protects the computer when you're
22 accessing it through its operating system.
23 Q. And you were accessing it through a hard drive copied
24 cloned image?
25 A. All through our forensic software.
