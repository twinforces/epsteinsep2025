LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 They talked to you about sex toys that were found on a
2 shelf in a guest room closet. What does that prove to you?

3 Then there's Virginia Roberts. The government wants

4 to try to claim that Virginia Roberts was also a victim.

5 Where is Virginia Roberts? Why didn't Virginia

6 Roberts come and get on the stand and tell you that she was a

7 victim? Use your common sense. If she could corroborate

8 Carolyn, you think they might have had her come in and do that?
9 What the government just told you is that Ghislaine

10 Maxwell basically picked her up off the side of the road.

11 That's not what you heard. Juan Alessi told you he --

12 Ghislaine Maxwell went to get a treatment at the spa at

13 Mar-a-Lago, and Virginia Roberts came out wearing a white

14 uniform, as though she worked there. And Juan Alessi also told
15 you and said in a deposition in 2009, she was a masseuse. He
16 understood her to be a masseuse. This isn't picking up a girl
17 off the side of the road.

18 And look at the records, okay. We put in Virginia

19 Roberts' school records. She was going to Survivor Charter
20 School from 2001 to 2002. She was 18 years old. That's where
al Shawn says he met her. And in 2002 is when Virginia introduced
22 Carolyn to Epstein, when she was 18 years old. So Virginia is
23 the one who's taking underage girls to meet Epstein, not
24 Ghislaine Maxwell.
25 Virginia's presence on a flight log when she was 17,
