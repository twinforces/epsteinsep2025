LCGCmax2 Espinosa —- direct

1 THE COURT: All right. You may inquire. Why don't

2 you start with the latter part of the question.

3 Q. Did you assist Ms. Maxwell in any way with the project.

4 Island?

5 A. Yes.

6 Q. And what sort of things did you assist with?

7 A. There was new construction being done on the island, there
8 were, I think, new swimming pools. But the majority of what I
9 did was furnish the house, furnish the resort style. There

10 was, you know, every house good that you could think of —

11 silverware, glasses, towels, beach towels, linens. We had to
12 ship all of that over, all of the furniture, all of the

13 artwork. We even shipped in sand and palm trees and all kinds
14 of things to get the island to what he wanted it to be.

15 Q. To be clear, you shipped in sand to a tropical island, why
16 was that?

17 A. He wanted more sand on the beach.

18 QO. Palm trees, too?

19 A. Uh-huh.
20 Q. When you started when the island was acquired, was there
21 anything, to your knowledge, on the island or was there nothing
22 on the island?
23 A. I think there may have been one building or something. It
24 was a lot of construction going on. We even had a fire
25 department on the island, a firehouse with a proper firetruck
