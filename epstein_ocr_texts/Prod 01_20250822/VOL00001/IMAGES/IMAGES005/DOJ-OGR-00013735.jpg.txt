LCACmax5 A. Farmer — cross

2 THE COURT: I think what I'm looking at is an email

i) from August of 2019, in which she recounts to the New York

4 Times reporter that she thinks when they came — meaning the FBI
5 agents — it was in spring-summer of 2007. Grounds.

6 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, this is a collateral

7 matter. She's been testifying about the interview itself, but
8 there is no grounds to bring in extrinsic evidence on this

9 matter with the date of the interview itself.

10 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, my point is simply that

11 she refreshed her memory about when the meeting was by talking
12 to her husband and thinking about other points, like it was hot
13 and sunny. She did testify that it was --

14 THE COURT: But what's in issue is her memory of when
15 she met with the FBI agents? What does that matter?

16 MS. MENNINGER: It's her memories now of things that
17 she -- yes, about things that happened a decade ago, which, by
18 inference, goes to the strength of her memory about things that
19 happened in '96.
20 THE COURT: So the theory is anything testing her
21 memory from years ago is relevant.
22 MS. MENNINGER: I wouldn't go that far, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: This is two steps removed and I'll
24 sustain.
