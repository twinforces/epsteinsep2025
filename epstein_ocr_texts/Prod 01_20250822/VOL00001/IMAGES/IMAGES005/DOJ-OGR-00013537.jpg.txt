1 Does the government have a preference?

2 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. The government defers to

3 the Court on the timing.

4 THE COURT: I think from my perspective, I would like
a to use the jury's time on Friday, if we could. But if we

6 can't, then I suspect they won't mind the extra time off.

7 T'll let you know tomorrow if I can get you the charge
8 in time to do a charging conference on Friday. But I hear you
9 that, all things being equal, more time with the charge when

10 you're not trying the case is helpful, I presume, for both

11 sides.

12 MR. EVERDELL: Yes.

13 THE COURT: I do sometimes push for speed, you may

14 have heard. But given where we are in the schedule, I think

15 taking time to be careful and getting your full input,

16 considered input, is appropriate. Okay.

17 MR. EVERDELL: Thank you, your Honor.

18 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.

19 THE COURT: Am I going to get briefing on 52? Because
20 if so, I want to schedule for it.
21 MR. ROHRBACH: The parties haven't conferred, your
22 Honor; but I suspect there will be briefing tonight. The
23 government will file its brief by 8 p.m. or we can confer
24 immediately after this, right now, your Honor, and get a
25 timeline.
