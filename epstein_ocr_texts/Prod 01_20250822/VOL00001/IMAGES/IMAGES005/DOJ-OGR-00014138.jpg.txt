6f the cCasé. Thére is no phone records. There is no -- there
igs lots of things that you might expect to be part of the case
that! are not’ hére. The main réason for thdt is that the age of

the case, especially the allegations in the 1990's. are quite old

and, these records, don"t exist anymore. So I think, it's fair to

raise to the agent the absence ‘of evidence, that evidence
throtigh, the agent. That's one topic.
THE COURT: So, for example, give me your example

question on emails.

MR, EVERDELL: It's in here somewhere, your Honor, As
part of yéur investigating the case, you triéed to gather as
much documentary evidence as you can to corroborate what, the

witnesses are telling you, isn't that right. I amagine the

answer 1s going to be yes to that. And, given the age of the

case, there wére no emails from the 1990s, there are

allegations in this case from the 1990s, correct, ‘yeah. There
dre no emails that you have for any of the accusing witnesses
whe testified against. Ms. Maxwell from the 1990s, is that
right, yes. Because, in fact, in the 1990s, nobody used email,

Lt wasn't very popular, it was just starting, yes. So because

the allegations are over 25 years old, there are no smails in
this case from that period, isn't that right, ‘yes, thene is no
emails, Same thing about. phone ==

THE COURT: I'm sorry. I cut ‘you off, Mr. Everdell.
Same thing about phone records?
