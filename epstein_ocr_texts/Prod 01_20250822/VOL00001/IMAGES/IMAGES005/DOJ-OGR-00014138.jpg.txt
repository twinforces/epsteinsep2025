1 of the case. There is no phone records. There is no -- there
2 is lots of things that you might expect to be part of the case
3 that are not here. The main reason for that is that the age of
4 the case, especially the allegations in the 1990s are quite old
a and these records don't exist anymore. So I think it's fair to
6 raise to the agent the absence of evidence, that evidence

7 through the agent. That's one topic.

8 THE COURT: So, for example, give me your example

9 question on emails.

10 MR. EVERDELL: It's in here somewhere, your Honor. As
11 part of your investigating the case, you tried to gather as

12 much documentary evidence as you can to corroborate what the

13 witnesses are telling you, isn't that right. I imagine the

14 answer is going to be yes to that. And given the age of the

15 case, there were no emails from the 1990s, there are

16 allegations in this case from the 1990s, correct, yeah. There
17 are no emails that you have for any of the accusing witnesses
18 who testified against Ms. Maxwell from the 1990s, is that

19 right, yes. Because, in fact, in the 1990s, nobody used email,
20 it wasn't very popular, it was just starting, yes. So because
21 the allegations are over 25 years old, there are no emails in
22 this case from that period, isn't that right, yes, there is no
23 emails. Same thing about phone --
24 THE COURT: I'm sorry. I cut you off, Mr. Everdell.
25 Same thing about phone records?
