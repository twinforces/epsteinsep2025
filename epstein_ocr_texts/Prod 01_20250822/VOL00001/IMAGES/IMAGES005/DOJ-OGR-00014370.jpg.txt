were lots of women, there and, ‘you know, there are many -- no

one -- mo one observed women that they thought were under age’.

But it's not -- I don't believe there is, going to be

an. argument, Ms. Maxwell is not guilty because she couldn't

have known that these four people were whatever age they are.

I. think the argument is going to be, they weren't. that age.
That's what IT think the défensé's position, is, here, your Honor,
net, you know, gee, Mr. Epstein slipped. in. a couple of
teenagers on me heres

MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, unless the defense Js
stipulating that Ms. Maxwéll knew the agés of these victims,
and, it's an open issue. The defiense has elicited from Lanny
Visoski, Kimbérly Espinosa, the appearance of the victims.
They elicited from Carolyn, that she was told not. to tell -- or
téld to téll péedple at thé house that. she was 17 6F 18, when
she was younger than that. So. the evidence thats been
elicited cértdinly puts the défendant's knowledge of the
victims’ age at issue.

THE COURT: Yes, There aré two 1S8uées. There's. the,

rh

“inst. question, what. age were they. And you contest that. But

then there's the second guestioh 6f, let's assume the jury

concludes that. they were under the age of 17, then, there is the
question of Ms. Maxwell's knowledge, and that seems to me to
have been put in issue through argument and -- through openings
and. questions: asked. on. cross.
