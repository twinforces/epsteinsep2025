Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 757 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 7 of 49 1980
LCOVMAXT

1 As we explained to the defense this morning, we

2 anticipate calling Special Agent Michael Buscemi as a summary

i) witness, as is common in this district. His testimony will be
4 limited to his analysis of exhibits; he won't be analyzing

5 testimony of other witnesses.

6 There are a number of exhibits in this case which have
7 not yet been published or reviewed during the course of this

8 case; and so we anticipate fairly brief testimony from Special
9 Agent Buscemi about his review of several exhibits.

10 In short, the testimony will concern, among other

11 things, the message pads, the majority of which have not been
12 published or viewed by the jury at this point. And the purpose
13 of the testimony is to connect up several exhibits and review
14 them in a way to make those exhibits clear to the jury and

15 publish them to show, for example, the continuity of certain

16 phone numbers and names, where they change over time, where

17 they are in the message books in order to make that clear for
18 the jury.

19 I anticipate that the testimony from Special Agent
20 Buscemi would be likely something like 15 to 20 minutes, maybe
21 slightly more, again, just talking about exhibits and the
22 Similarity of phone numbers and names between a variety of
23 different exhibits. That's the scope of his testimony.
24 Our view is that's consistent with the way summary
25 witnesses are called in many trials in this district and
