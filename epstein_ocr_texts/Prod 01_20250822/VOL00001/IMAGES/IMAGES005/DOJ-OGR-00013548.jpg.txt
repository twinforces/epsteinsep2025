anticipate calling Special Agent Michael Buscemi as a summary
witness, aS iS Common in tHis, district. His testimony’ will be

testamony of other witnesses.

There are a number of exhibits in this case which have
not yet been published or reviewed during the course of this
case; and so we anticipate fairly brief testimony from Special
Agent Buscemi, abotit his review of several exhibits.

In short, the testimony will concern, among other
things, the message pads, the majority of which have not. been
published or viewed, by the jury at this point. And, the purpose
of thé testimény is to6 connect up sevéral exhibits and réview
them in a way to make those exhibits clear to the jury ‘and
publish them to sHow, for example, the continuity of certain
phone mumbers and inames, where they change over tame, where

Buscemi would be likely something Like 15 to 20 minutes, maybe
slightly more, again, just talking abdut exhibits and thé
similarity of phone numbers and, names. between a vanlety of
different exhibits. That's the scope of His testamony::
