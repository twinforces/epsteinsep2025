1 faded quickly, but I have a feeling it is different this time.
2 New York is such an amazing city. I felt really comfortable

3 there, like I know that I belong there and would live there at
4 some point, hopefully soon. I miss Maria so much already. It
5 seems unfair that I can't see her more often. I feel like I'm
6 missing so much.

7 There is so much to tell about the trip, but I don't

8 know where to begin. The best night was when Maria and I saw

9 Phantom of the Opera. We went to Jeff Epstein's house and had
10 champagne with him. I found him down-to-earth and easy to talk
11 to. I thanked him so much for the trip, etc.

12 We then took his car. His driver actually took us to
13 Phantom. I didn't know any play could be so moving. I had

14 seen it before, but still couldn't believe it. I bawled. It
15 was fantastic. After the play, we walked around the plaza and
16 went home. It was so much fun.

17 MS. POMERANTZ: Ms. Drescher, would you please pull up
18 for just the witness, the parties, and the Court what has been
19 marked for identification as Government Exhibit 604. You can
20 scroll to the second page. Thank you. And we can go back up
21 to the top. Thank you, Ms. Drescher.
22 Q. Annie, do you recognize this?
23 A. Yes. It's another entry from the same journal.
24 Q. Is this a fair and accurate depiction of an entry from your
25 journal?
