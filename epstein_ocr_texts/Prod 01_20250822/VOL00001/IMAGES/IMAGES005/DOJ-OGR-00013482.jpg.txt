1 bullet point list on that page, there is a paragraph -- where I
2 want you to focus is the last few sentences, but you can read

3 the full paragraph. Let me know when you've read it.

4 A. Yes, that's correct, I did say that. But at that time, I

5 hadn't done a lot of research in my logbook.

6 Q. Exactly. So, at that time, you were responding from your

7 memory?

8 A. Correct.

9 Q. As best you could about when you recalled first meeting
10 Jane; correct?
11 A. Correct.
12 Q. And you told the government that you best recalled first
13 meeting Jane around the year 2000, give or take a year or two;
14 right?
15 A. Yes. I was a couple of years off.
16 Q. Well, that was before you were shown the flight logs;
17 right? You gave that response before you were shown the flight
18 logs; right?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And as we saw, the flight logs for the flights in '96, '97,
21 and '98 where there is an indication where someone with Jane's
22 first name appears in the passenger list, those flight logs
23 just show just that, someone with Jane's first name flying on
24 those flights; right?
25 A. Correct.
