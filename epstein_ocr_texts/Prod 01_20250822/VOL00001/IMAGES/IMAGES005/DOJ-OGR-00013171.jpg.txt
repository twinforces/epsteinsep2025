Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 753 Filed 08/10/22 Page 158 of 264 1584
LC 7VMAX5 Carolyn - cross

1 we have the factual record. There's no additional record that
2 would lead to exclusion, and so we'll do what we need to do. A
3 hearing, an order, only to prepare further for what's going to
4 happen is likely not necessarily. I don't see any law that

S supports that. But we'll get the full factual record and

6 you'll brief it.

7 So I would like -- if this witness is going to testify
8 tomorrow, I think the government needs to provide the defense

9 the results of a full factual investigation by 6 p.m. And

10 then, Ms. Menninger, when would you like to brief the issue?

11 MS. MENNINGER: By 9 p.m., your Honor.

12 THE COURT: Okay. By 9 p.m.

13 And then let's say --â€” Mr. Rohrbach?

14 MR. ROHRBACH: I apologize. By 9 p.m. By midnight.
15 I know that's late for the Court. That would be three hours

16 for each side to write a brief.

17 THE COURT: Okay.

18 MR. ROHRBACH: Thank you, your Honor.

19 Just one other point on this witness, your Honor.
20 We understand that this witness is also a subject of a
21 defense subpoena. And so the government would just like to
22 know whether, in light of the defense's motion to preclude his
23 testimony for this reason, he's still under defense subpoena.
24 THE COURT: I suppose they might want to know the
25 result of that motion first.
