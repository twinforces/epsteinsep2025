1 MS. MENNINGER: For that reason, having her explain

2 what sexualized means when I wasn't allowed to elicit to the

3 agents that it wasn't sexualized is what gives me concern.

4 THE COURT: The record stands and you inquired. I

5 didn't prohibit you from asking her, I didn't let her explain

6 what sexualized means either. I've made my record and the

7 record stands as it is. You can't go back in time.

8 MS. MENNINGER: That's right.

9 THE COURT: What is the issue? Should I send the jury
10 for a break or?

11 MS. STERNHEIM: If this would probably be a good time
12 for a break before they call him, but I can make it very

13 quickly.

14 THE COURT: Go ahead.

15 MS. STERNHEIM: It's my understanding that Dave

16 Mulligan is being called as a witness for prior inconsistent

17 statements.

18 THE COURT: Right.

19 MS. STERNHEIM: The 3500 material that has been
20 provided far exceeds the testimony of this witness, and I just
21 want to make sure that it is not going to exceed as far as
22 prior consistent what she's testified to.
23 MS. POMERANTZ: I'm happy to consult with
24 Ms. Sternheim on a break. My plan is to ask specific questions
25 that would be consistent with what she's testified about.
