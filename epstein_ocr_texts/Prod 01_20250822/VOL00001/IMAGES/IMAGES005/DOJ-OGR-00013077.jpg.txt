1 and 422 saved?

2 A. They were on Government Exhibit 54.

3 Q. Were they saved under any user account?

4 A. Just give me one second. Yes, they were saved under -- in
a) the documents folder for a user, Ghislaine.

6 Q. When you say they were saved under a user account, what

7 does that mean?

8 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, your Honor. The user

9 account was outside the scope.

10 THE COURT: Overruled.

11 A. So when you have a computer, a Windows computer, when you
12 have a sign-in, a log-in ID username and password, it creates a
13 folder structure under that name to organize the different data
14 on it in case there is other users that are also on the

15 machine. So, these particular documents were saved under the
16 documents folder under the user Ghislaine.

17 QO. What kind of files are Government Exhibits 418, 420, 421,
18 and 422?

19 A. They're Microsoft Word documents.
20 Q. Where are properties stored in a Word document?
21 A. So Word documents are actually not just one file, there are
22 several files that are kind of cobbled together and one of
23 those files maintains the properties of the document.
24 Q. Just put simply, how can someone determine the properties
25 in a Word document?
