1 closing.

2 MS. MOE: Your Honor, we often call summary witnesses
3 who are not involved in the investigation who are just talking
4 about their analysis of records. The purpose here isn't to

a have the summary witness talk through the investigation or

6 investigative steps, but to talk about a review of exhibits.

7 And I have called agents to do just that.

8 THE COURT: But for the purposes of doing what 1006

9 permits, that's not what this is. I've seen it in two

10 contexts: One, 1006 you've got a complicated, extensive set of
11 records that are being summarized via a witness. And then

12 you've got investigative summary witnesses who talk through

13 factually what they did in a sense. And you're not doing

14 either of those; you're providing essentially a closing

15 argument or mini closing argument via a witness who has no

16 personal involvement in the investigation and doing so, sounds
17 like, with materials that don't reguire the type of 1006

18 summary.

19 So you've created, I think, a little bit of a hybrid
20 of certainly what I've seen those two exemplars, for them to be
21 used. And so it just does sound like argument, summation, and
22 the kind of thing that -- I mean, it's certainly true you could
23 have done it with the witnesses. At some point I might have
24 said, Save it for summation, counsel. But I can't say I've
25 ever seen a version like this.
