LC1VMAX3 Jane -â€” cross

1 demanding $25 million in civil litigation while this criminal

2 case was pending?

3 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.

4 THE COURT: Okay.

a) MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

6 As long as it's framed in terms of her knowledge; we

7 have no objection to what she knows about or was involved in.

8 What we want to avoid is a scenario where following a
9 question like that, a legal document exchanged between

10 attorneys was then shown to the witness to refresh her

11 recollection, and this witness was asked to read into the

12 record comments her attorney made, which would not be

13 admissible under Rule 408 if she doesn't know about them

14 because they can't speak to her bias if she is not aware of

15 those communications.

16 THE COURT: So just to spin out the question, Were you
17 demanding $25 million during -- in a civil lawsuit while this
18 criminal investigation was pending?

19 I suppose one response would be I don't know, one
20 response is yes, and one response is no.
21 So if the response is yes, you move on?
22 MS. MENNINGER: Yes.
23 THE COURT: If the response is I don't know, what do
24 you do?
25 MS. MENNINGER: Refresh her recollection with her own
