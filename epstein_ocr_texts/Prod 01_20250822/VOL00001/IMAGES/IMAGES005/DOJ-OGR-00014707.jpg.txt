THE COURT: I Gan"t answer this ambiguous quéstion no.
I. don't know that the answer is no, even with the ambiguity;
because TI’ don"t know if what they Have in mind is, an aiding and

abetting question, which we haven't discussed yet.

THE COURT: That's true. I won't assume that's the
question for purposes, of the answér, but I also don't. assume
the meaning that you've put on. it for purposes of the answer.
So ‘the only solution here is to say, I direct 'you ‘to Gonsider

MS. MENNINGER: Our requést would be to emphasize the
portion of that that talks about the purpose of the travel.
Because they have highlighted the purpose of the travel in
their question. And the way I read, it as certainly that that's
their question. If they doh't have evidence that. thé intent. on

the return, flight. was for purposes of sexual activity, then I

d6. think the answer, as Mr. Everdéll said is, no, théy can't,
convict.

MS. STERNHEIM: May I have a moment?
