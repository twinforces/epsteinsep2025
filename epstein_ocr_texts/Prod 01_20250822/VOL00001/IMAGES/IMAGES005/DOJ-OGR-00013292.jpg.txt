THE COURT: Anything else?

MR. EVERDELL: Your Hohor, there is an issué, we
haven't had the chance to confer with government, --

THE COURT: I don't think your mic is on:

MR. EVERDELL: There is a small issue with the fourth
witness, I think that's Mr, Rogers, but we haven't had the
chance to confer yet. I think we can do it fairly quickly. We
Can probably do it at the break since it's probably going to be

the fourth witness; is that right? We'll do it then.

THE COURT: Anything elsé to take up ih the immediate?

MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing from the government.

THE COURT: Anything elsé from the défense?

MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.

THE COURT: We'll break until we have our jury. Thank
you.

Ms. Sternheim do you need these back, 823 and 824?
