LBUVMAX6 Jane, - direct
have a financial stake --

THE COURT: That's what you argue to the jury.

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, one other thing. If she
did, in fact, give a statement to law enforcement in May of
2019, it hasn't beén discloséd ‘to us.

MS, MOE: Yes, your Honor, My understanding, I was at
that very first meeting. I can double-check my notes, which we
produced to the defense, it is September 2019.

THE COURT: Do you wan't to réfresh hér recollection on

the date or you don"t have any notes from May 2099?
MS. MOE: I do nét.
THE COURT: You're cerntaanly welcome ‘to inquine.

MS. MENNINGER: Gertainly, your Honor. On her dates.

MS. MOE: I'm sonny. My colleague is again, I
dén't. remembér this off the td6p of my hedd, but ==
MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I believe what 1s possibly

happening ih the witness's answer about May 2019 is that I

believe before the September 2019 interview, FBI agents
approached this witness and asked her if she was willing to bé
interviewed. She declined. And I believe that may have
happened around May of 2019. So she tay be confusing that as
the first ‘time she ever spoke with the FBI. But, she was not
substantively interviewed ahd did not give substantive
Statements until September of 2019.

THE COURT: All right. Not sealed.
