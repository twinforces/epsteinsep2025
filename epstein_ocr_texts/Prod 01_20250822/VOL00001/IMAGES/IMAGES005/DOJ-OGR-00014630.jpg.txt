Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 230 of 257 3064
LCKCmax9 Charge

1 Southern District of New York encompasses the following

2 counties New York County, i.e., Manhattan, Bronx, Westchester,
i) Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange, and Sullivan Counties.

4 Anything that occurs in any of those places occurs in the

5 Southern District of New York.

6 Venue must be examined separately for each count in

7 the indictment. Venue on one count does not establish venue on
8 another. If applicable, you may rely on the same evidence to

9 establish evidence on multiple counts.

10 The government need not prove venue beyond a

11 reasonable doubt, but only by a mere preponderance of the

12 evidence. A preponderance of the evidence means more likely

13 than not. Thus, the government, which does bear the burden of
14 proving venue, has satisfied that if you conclude that it is

15 more likely than not that some furtherance of each charged

16 offense occurred in the Southern District of New York. If, on
17 the other hand, you find that the government has failed to

18 prove the venue requirement as to a particular offense, then

19 you must acquit Ms. Maxwell of that offense even if all the
20 other elements of the offense are proven.
21 Instruction No. 41: Time of Offense.
22 The indictment alleges that certain conduct occurred
23 on or about various dates or during various time periods. It's
24 not necessary, however, for the government to prove that any
25 conduct alleged occurred exactly on such dates or throughout
