3 THE COURT: Okay. We have a few things to take up.

4 Ms. Comey.

10 There is one issue that I believe the defense still

11 wanted to raise that we were not able to reach agreement on. I
12 would propose that we have that argument now and then,

13 depending on the result of that, I think we can proceed to wrap

15 THE COURT: Okay. All right.

16 How long will the reading of stips take?

17 MS. COMEY: Ten to 15 minutes, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: Oh, okay. So I didn't know if we were

19 talking an hour, in which case my suggestion was going to be

21 but okay. I'll hear the issue.
22 Ms. Menninger.
23 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor.
