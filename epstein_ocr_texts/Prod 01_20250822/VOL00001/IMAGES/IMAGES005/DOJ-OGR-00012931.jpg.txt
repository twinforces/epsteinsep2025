1 Q. And then you saw on June 18th, there was the same amount of
2 money going out from this account under the name of Ghislaine

3 Maxwell to the account of 4324?

4 A. That's right.

iy Q. And if you look at Government Exhibit 501, that is the 4324
6 account, right, where the money ended up?

7 A. Yes.

8 Q. And that is a account held by Air Ghislaine?

9 A. Yes.

10 Q. And if you look at page 2 of that document, you see on June
11 18th, $7.4 million coming into the account; right?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. And on June 18th, same day, almost equivalent number,

14 slightly less going out to Sikorsky Aircraft Corporation;

15 right?

16 A. YSS.

17 Q. So fair to say it looks like money goes into the account

18 held by Ghislaine Maxwell or in the name of Ghislaine Maxwell
19 from Jeffrey Epstein, money goes out from that account to the
20 Air Ghislaine account and then goes from that account to
21 Sikorsky.
22 Is that a fair summary of what we just looked at?
23 A. Yes.
24 QO. So I want to take a look back at that account that's in the
25 name of Ghislaine Maxwell, that's Government Exhibit 502.
