4 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. These three exhibits
S are spiral bound message books. As their appearance makes
6 clear, no one could tear an object out or put it in there, and

8 Your Honor, this witness has authenticated these
9 message books in the same manner that a previous witness has
10 also authenticated other message books, and they were admitted
11 exactly the same way earlier ina trial.
12 With respect to rule 901 --
13 THE COURT: I didn't hear an authentication objection.
14 It was hearsay.
15 MS. MOE: With respect to hearsay, these are
16 admissible for the same reasons the other message pads are
17 admissible and received. They are phone messages that record
18 the date and time of a person calling.
19 With respect to particular victims that are in those
20 messages, that would be a prior consistent statement to the
al extent the witness testified.
22 Your Honor, there are already message pads that are
23 already in evidence that were not objected to on hearsay
24 grounds. So they are in the record. These are of a similar
25 nature. We are simply offering an additional set in the same
