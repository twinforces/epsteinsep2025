1 what I allowed in overruling your motion to preclude is

2 timeframed. So you want the timeframe narrowed to the window

3 in which the witness testified that there was sexualized

8 other people, the question is whether she has relevant

9 knowledge about misconduct with the people who are at issue in
10 this case. The absence of misconduct with other people who are
11 not at issue in this case is not relevant.

12 THE COURT: I think you should narrow the timeframe in
13 which the witness testifies.

14 MR. PAGLIUCA: I can do that, your Honor.

15 Just so the record is clear, I don't believe this was
16 litigated at all pretrial. This witness was not questioned

17 about Ms. Maxwell or not being there, which were litigated

18 pretrial. This really is foundational to the next question,

19 which is going to be after she stopped dating him, which is
20 then into the relevant timeframe, did she see any of this
21 activity, any of which she considered to be inappropriate
22 activity. So that's actually the next question. So I'm moving
23 out of this into that. But it seems to me to be logically
24 relevant, your Honor, frankly because if she had seen any of
25 that activity, I doubt she would have been dating him or would
