1 (Trial resumed; jury not present)

2 THE COURT: All right. We have a number of issues to
3 take up. I've gotten letter briefing on several issues over

4 the past few days, including some new issues that came in last
a night. I did address the issue of defense witness anonymity by
6 order last night, which will be docketed this morning when

7 docketing puts it up, denying the defense request for anonymity
8 for the reasons indicated.

9 As to the remaining issues, so there's the prior

10 inconsistent statements issue. I received the letter with the
11 government objections close to 11 p.m. last night. I haven't
12 had the ability to yet go through all of them, and I haven't

13 heard any responses from the defense.

14 What's the timing of anticipated witnesses here?

15 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, for the witness order?

16 THE COURT: Well, when might we get to a witness who
17 implicates the prior inconsistent statements? And I gather

18 there's been some effort to work through stipulation and

19 narrowing.
20 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.
21 There have been some efforts, and I think there's
22 going to be continued efforts there. I don't think we have a
23 witness until after lunch that is going to implicate the prior
24 inconsistent statements.
25 THE COURT: Okay. That may be what we're doing during
