nothing happened on the Néw Mexico trips, dnd ‘then I think it
came out in the testimony -- unless the government wants to

correct mé iff 'we're wrong dbotit that, but I think that our

status of our knowledge was that we weren't expecting to hear
about testimony about sextal contact in New Mexico. But they
can correct me if I'm wrong about that.

MR. ROHRBACH: JT beliévé ‘that Jane only testified as.
to ‘one sexual incident ‘of sexual abuse in New Mexico and that
that was reflected in ‘the 3500 material. I think Ms. Pomerantz
is looking for it, but it should not have heen. a surprise to
the défense:

THE COURT: Yeah. I, mean, the problem -- the
instructio6ns dré accurate. It's Clear it's a violatidn of Néw
York law. This was the government's argument. for net giving
the limiting inStructions that I gave with respect to Ahnie and

Kate, but. £ did give those instructions. It sounds lake maybe

there was an insStance ih which the defense might Have requested
one following a particular piece of testimony. To add that
now; Having not == well; let me put it this way. Having not
asked for a limiting instruction then I don't ‘think provides a,

basis. for inclusid6n of limiting instructidns, repetition 6f

IF?

imitang instructions in the charge, and even without it, which
was the gévernment's 6riginal argument, it's Glear that the
violation of law is as charged in New York. So I'm not
persuaded to include it. I'm mot persuaded. to include it.
