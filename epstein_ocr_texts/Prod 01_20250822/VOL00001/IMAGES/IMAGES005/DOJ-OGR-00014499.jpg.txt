LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 application for the summer of '95. Again, she doesn't mention

2 that Epstein is providing her any support or paying for her to

3 go. By this point, in her budding career, she has been in

4 commercials, she has been in a Broadway production of Joseph

S and the Technicolor Dreamcoat on the touring group that came to

6 Palm Beach. She's got more prestigious letters of

7 recommendation, still no application for financial aid, still

8 no mention of Epstein.

9 And after her second year at Interlochen, we see her
10 customs and border protection records which show how many times
11 when she was a teen that she was traveling internationally.

12 This person who said she didn't have lunch money, she's going
13 to Italy for an international trip she told you about, a vocal
14 competition with her school. And she's going on an
15 international trip to Europe with her family to see other
16 family back there.
17 And in 1996, she applies for Interlochen again. And
18 on that one, they actually go so far as to ask her, in this
19 yellow highlighted area, not only are you applying for
20 financial aid, which she says no, but does the student expect
21 to be the recipient of any funds from any individual
22 specifically for attendance at Interlochen Arts Camp, and she
23 says no, while she came in here and told you that Epstein was
24 paying for her.
25 The government touted, touted the trips in August to
