1 (In open court)
2 THE COURT: Bring in the jury.
3 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor?
4 MS. MENNINGER: Our client is not here.
a THE COURT: I'm going to step off.
6 (Recess)
7 THE COURT: We'll bring in the jury.
8 (Jury present)
9 THE COURT: Thank you, members of the jury.
10 I've been informed there's an attorney in the case
11 who's ill, and that attorney needs to get care. We have no
12 reason to believe it's COVID-related, but we do need that
13 attorney for what was anticipated to happen today. So we need
14 to break.
15 My assumption is we'll resume tomorrow morning at our
16 normal time. And I'll give you any additional information, if
17 I have that information. But we want to make sure the attorney
18 is taken care of. And rather than pause and delay, we're going
19 to break for the day.
20 So all of my instructions apply.
al Thank you for your time and attention.
22 We'll see you tomorrow morning. Thank you.
23 (Jury not present)
24 THE COURT: Counsel, is there anything we can take up
25 now or wait until we get further word?
