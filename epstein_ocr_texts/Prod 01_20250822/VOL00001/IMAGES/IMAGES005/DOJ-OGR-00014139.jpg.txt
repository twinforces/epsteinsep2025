1 MR. EVERDELL: Phone records, geo location

2 information, things like that.

3 MR. ROHRBACH: This implicates at least two of the

4 Court's rulings on the subject. One is that the defense can't
a elicit direct testimony about investigative steps that the

6 government did or did not take. And the other is defense can't
7 elicit direct testimony about the thoroughness of the

8 government's investigation. As your Honor ruled, they can say
9 in their closing there is no email evidence before you that

10 goes to defendant's guilt or innocence, but they can't elicit
11 testimony from the special agent, the government's case agent
12 about the steps the government did or did not take or why the
13 government did or did not take them and what that says about

14 the thoroughness of the government's investigation.

15 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I believe I am allowed to
16 comment on the absence of evidence. I'm allowed to put that in
17 through a witness if I choose and this is the witness to do it.
18 THE COURT: Not inconsistent with my ruling.

19 MR. EVERDELL: IT understand that, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: I'll pull it up and look again, but with
21 respect to the ability to cross examine witnesses put on to
22 show the thoroughness of the investigation, you can cross on
23 the failure to do that. The absence of evidence is arguments
24 that you can make comments on, of course, and seek the jury to
25 conclude from it what it likes in the course of its
