1 you're in a position at this point to make those disclosures as
2 if it is that person, so I did expect a full disclosure.

3 What is the defense's anticipation as to length of

4 case?

5 MR. PAGLIUCA: I would say -- I'm going to guess no

6 more than four days, more likely two to three, your Honor.

7 THE COURT: Okay. All right.

8 So I think then -- and then we should talk about the

9 timing of the charge conference. Have you discussed that

10 further? You kept promising to discuss it.

11 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

12 We haven't conferred with the defense about that. We
13 continue to just defer to the Court's preference on timing.

14 I think if the defense case is two to three days, then
15 a charge conference at the conclusion of that would fit with

16 the Court's timing. We're also happy to do that earlier. We
17 don't have a preference as to the sequencing there.

18 THE COURT: Let me just look at the calendar.

19 Go ahead, Ms. Sternheim.
20 MS. STERNHEIM: I was just going to suggest that we
21 utilize the Saturday that the Court said would be available.
22 Even if we had more of a case, I think we could accomplish
23 that, if the Court is still amenable.
24 THE COURT: Okay. That's fine with me.
25 MS. MOE: No objection to that, your Honor.
