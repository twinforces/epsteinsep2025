We haven't conferred with the defense about that. We

continue to just defer to the Court's preference 6n timing.

I think if the defense case is two to three days, then
a chargé conféréncée at the conclusion of that. would fit with
the Court's timing. We're alsq happy ‘to do that, earlier. We

utilizé the Saturday that. the Court said would be available.
Even if we had more of a case, I think, we could, accomp ish.
that, if thé Court is still amenable.

THE COURT: Okay. Thdt!'s fine with me.

MS. MOE: No objection to that, your Honor.
