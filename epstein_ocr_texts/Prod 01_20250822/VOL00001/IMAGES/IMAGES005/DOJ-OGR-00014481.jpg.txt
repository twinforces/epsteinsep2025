LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 MS. MENNINGER: Good afternoon. Ghislaine Maxwell is
2 an innocent woman wrongfully accused of crimes she did not

3 commit. The government has failed to prove any charges beyond
4 a reasonable doubt, and the just and only correct verdict in

a this case is not guilty on each and every count.

6 The evidence presented at trial has established

7 exactly what we told you it would during openings, that the

8 stories relied on by the government are the product of

9 erroneous memories, manipulation, and money. But, in this

10 case, the order is reversed. The money brought the accusers to
11 the FBI with their personal injury lawyers sitting right there
12 next to them. The lawyers manipulated their stories and the

13 government accepted those stories at face value without ever

14 testing them or corroborating them or checking with other

15 witnesses to see if they were accurate. And suddenly, the

16 women recovered memories years later, they recovered memories
17 that Ghislaine was involved, that Ghislaine was there, that

18 Ghislaine is the culprit.

19 Just as we predicted in our opening statement, the
20 government spent a lot of time focusing you on Epstein, on his
21 character, on his lifestyle, on his flaws, and they certainly
22 proved to you that Epstein had abused his money and his power.
23 They proved to you that he was a master manipulator. That has
24 nothing to do with Ghislaine and everything to do with Jeffrey
25 Epstein.
