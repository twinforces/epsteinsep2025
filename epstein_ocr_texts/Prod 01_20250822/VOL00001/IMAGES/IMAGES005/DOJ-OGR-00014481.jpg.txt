LCKCmax5 Summation. - Ms. Menninger

MS. MENNINGER: Good afternoon. Ghislaine Maxwell is
an. innocent woman wrongfully accused of crimes she did not
commit. The government has failéd to prove any chdargés beyond
a reasonable doubt, and the just and only correct verdict in

this casé is not’ Guilty on each and, every count.

The evidence presented at trial has established
exactly what’ we told you it would during openings, that the
stories relied on by the government are the product of

erroneous, memories, manipulation, dnd money. But, in ‘this

case, the order is reversed, The money brought the accusers to
the FBI with théir personal injury lawyers sitting right there
next to them. The ,lawyers manipulated their stories and the
government accepted those stories at face valué without éver
testing them, or corroborating them or checking with other
witnesses to sée if they were accurate. And suddenly, the

women, GBecovered memories years later, ‘they recovered jmemories

that. Ghislainé was involved, that. Ghislaine was there, that
Ghislaine is the culprit.

Just. as we predicted in 6ur 6péning statement, the
government spent a lot of time focusing you on, Epstein, on, his
character, on his lifestyle, 6n his flaws, and they cértainly
proved to you that Epstein, had abused his money and, his power.
They proved to you that he was a master manipulator. That has
nothing to do with Ghislaine and everything to do with Jeffrey
Epstein.
