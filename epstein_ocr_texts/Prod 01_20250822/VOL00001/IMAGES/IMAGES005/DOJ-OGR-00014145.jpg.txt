Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document.763. Filed 08/10/22 Page 39 of 197 2580

LEHVMAX 2:

THE COURT: How about this: I*11 lét ‘you. ask, the
agent. -- I suppose I'll hear from the government .

What is the timé period of the allégations that shé
investigated?

MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think that ‘the investigation
that this agent was the case agent for was much broader than
the chargés here. And so it could léad to avenues that’ are not

appropriate for this trial and that are irrelevant to this
trial. And T ‘think that your Honor's, pretrial ruling was
ernystal clear here that this 18 not appropriate direct
testimony by the defense.

Defense counsel, im almost every ‘trial, stands up Ain
front of a jury and says, You didn't see this kind of evidence,
you didn't see DNA, you didn't see phone records. And they
don't. need to put. ah agent on the stand to6 prove that. negative.

They ane able to make that argument without having to put. on

that Gase through affirmative agent testimony, and the samé is
true here.

THE GOURT: You Gah Gértainhly argue to the jury from
the indictment and what they ane being instructed ‘to determine
what the age 6f the allegations are.

MR. EVERDELL: Okay. I understand, your Honor.

As we're doing this, I think maybe we shd6uld raise a
few other points, since IL don't want to violate the judge's
ruling.
