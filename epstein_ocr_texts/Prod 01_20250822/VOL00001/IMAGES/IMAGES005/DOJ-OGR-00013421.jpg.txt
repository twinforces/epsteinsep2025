1 Q. Why have the numbers restarted at 1?

2 A. This is our first trip in the Boeing 727.

3 Q. How do you know you're flying the Boeing?

4 A. Because under the aircraft make and model, it says B727-31.
5 Q. So why did you restart the numbers?

6 A. Because we wanted to keep the numbering going for the Gulf
7 Stream, and so we began all over with the Boeing starting at

8 number 1.

9 Q. Did you continue flying the Gulf Stream, though?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. How did you handle the numbering for the Gulf Stream?
12 A. In sequential order. It continued on.
13 Q. Let's turn to page 87, then, to take a look. Here we have
14 a flight 24, and then what's the very next flight after flight
15 24?
16 A. After 24 is 1538.
17 Q. Why the big jump?
18 A. Because we were in the Boeing on flight 24, and on 1538,
19 we're in the Gulf Stream.
20 Q. How can you tell that?
21 A. Because under the aircraft make and model, it has G1159B.
22 Q. I'd like to go now, please, to page 78. We'tll look at
23 flight 1433. What is the date of this flight?
24 A. 1433 is December the 11th, 2000.
25 Q. How can you tell it's December 11, 2000?
