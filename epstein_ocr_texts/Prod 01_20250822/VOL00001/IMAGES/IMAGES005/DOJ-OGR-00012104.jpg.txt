LC1VMAX3 Jane -â€” cross

1 if we need to cross it, so let's see if there's a memory -- if
2 there's an awareness or not. And if she doesn't know and the

3 answer is no, I think we'll move on until I hear from you as to
4 how it might come in.

S MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

6 And we'll look into the Rule 408 issue. If we have

7 that wrong, we'll certainly withdraw that objection. And I

8 appreciate the Court flagging that.

9 THE COURT: I assume that's why you hadn't raised 408
10 in your motion to quash. In any event, one of the parties

11 raised 408, so we looked at it and that was as far as we got.
12 Anything else?

13 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

14 There was just that brief anonymity.

15 THE COURT: Oh, yes. Let's do that at sidebar.

16 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.
