MR. PAGLIUCA: Ti 'think T) disagree with that, ‘your
Honor. And let's take Carolyn. as the example, Carolyn, the
government, affirmatively Elici'ted ‘that shé was told by Virginia

to say that she was, you know, whatever age she was told to

say. That's, I think, ‘the government's testimony.

MR, ROHRBACH: I. believe that came out on. cross, your
Honor. Tt's on page 1569.

MR. PAGLIUCA: If it came out on cross, it was her
volunteering that. inf6rmation, I think.

But, anyway, that. doesn't. have anything to do with

Ms, Maxwell; I méanh, that's simply "Virginia told me whatever

my mame -- whatever the age L'm supposed to say." It's not
Ms, Maxwell saying to Virginia, “Say this age."

So L just disagree as a factual matter that. this has
anything to d6 with céns¢ious avoidance.

MR. ROHRBACH: The defense also elicited testimony
that the defendant was from == through Mr. Alessi == that, the
defendant. was going to legitimate hotels to identify massage
therapists. I assume that that's ih service 6f an argumént
that, she didn't know the ages of people coming to ‘the house as

massage therdpists, dnd sé shé could Have confused some of them

who wene under the age of consent with ones who were older than

the age of consent. I'm not sure what other evidence that
would be in Service of.
MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, that's in service of Ms. Roberts
