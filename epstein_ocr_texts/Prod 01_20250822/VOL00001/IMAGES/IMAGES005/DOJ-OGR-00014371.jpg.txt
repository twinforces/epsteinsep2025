1 MR. PAGLIUCA: I think I disagree with that, your

2 Honor. And let's take Carolyn as the example. Carolyn, the

3 government affirmatively elicited that she was told by Virginia
4 to say that she was, you know, whatever age she was told to

5 say. That's, I think, the government's testimony.

6 MR. ROHRBACH: I believe that came out on cross, your
7 Honor. It's on page 1569.

8 MR. PAGLIUCA: If it came out on cross, it was her

9 volunteering that information, I think.

10 But anyway, that doesn't have anything to do with

11 Ms. Maxwell. I mean, that's simply "Virginia told me whatever
12 my name —- whatever the age I'm supposed to say." It's not

13 Ms. Maxwell saying to Virginia, "Say this age."

14 So I just disagree as a factual matter that this has
15 anything to do with conscious avoidance.

16 MR. ROHRBACH: The defense also elicited testimony

17 that the defendant was from -- through Mr. Alessi -—- that the
18 defendant was going to legitimate hotels to identify massage

19 therapists. I assume that that's in service of an argument
20 that she didn't know the ages of people coming to the house as
21 massage therapists, and so she could have confused some of them
22 who were under the age of consent with ones who were older than
23 the age of consent. I'm not sure what other evidence that
24 would be in service of.
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, that's in service of Ms. Roberts
