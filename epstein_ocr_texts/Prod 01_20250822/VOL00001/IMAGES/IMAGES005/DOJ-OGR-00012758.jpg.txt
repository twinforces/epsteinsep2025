1 even if taken months or years after the time period in question
2 if there is reason to believe the photo is probative of how the
3 scene appeared at the earlier time. See, for example, United

4 States v. Causey, 748 F.3d 310, which is a Seventh Circuit

5 decision from 2014.

6 Typically, this inquiry turns on whether the photo

7 depicts, quote, relatively enduring or fixed structures whose

8 locations and arrangement in location to one another would not
9 likely have changed, end quote, in the intervening time period.
10 I'm quoting here from United States v. Smith, 2020WL5663433,

11 which is a District of New Mexico 2020 decision.

12 For example, the Seventh Circuit in the Causey case

13 affirmed the admission of photographs of houses taken three and
14 six years after the conspiracy ended, stating that, despite the
15 significant passage of time, the photos were relevant because
16 they presented the jury with the layout, size, location, and

17 composition of the houses. 748 F.3d at 316.

18 Similarly, a Court in this circuit admitted crime

19 scene photos of the interior of a restaurant taken nine months
20 later where there was no argument that the photographs at issue
21 did not fairly and accurately depict the interior of the
22 restaurant. Walker v. Conway, 2007WL9225072, Western District
23 of New York, June 25, 2007.
24 The defense argues that admission of the photos is not
25 merely a matter of relevance and prejudice under 401 and 403,
