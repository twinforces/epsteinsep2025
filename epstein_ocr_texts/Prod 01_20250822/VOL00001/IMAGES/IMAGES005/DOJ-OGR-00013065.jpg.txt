LC7Cmax2 Flatley - direct

1 A. Sure. There is a possibility of three different tools that

2 we can use. One is a physical piece of equipment called a TX1

3 dise duplicator --

4 Q. Mr. Flatley, sorry to interrupt. In this case, what did

5 you use here?

6 A. I used the TX1 disc duplicator.

7 Q. Why not just examine the drive itself in this case,

8 Government Exhibit 54?

9 A. Hard drives are a little fragile, especially this one, it's
10 pretty old. The fact that we spin it up, that may be the last
11 time it ever spins. So we always make a copy and we work off
12 the copy so that we have our data. We can make arguably
13 infinite copies of that data and prove that it's the same data.
14 So that's what we do.

15 Q. What, if anything, do you do to determine that the image
16 you made from Government Exhibit 54 matched the data on
17 Government Exhibit 54?
18 A. We run a hash algorithm, which is basically a math problem
19 against the data that we copied and the data from the original,
20 and if the hashes match, then the data is identical, and the
21 data was in this case.
22 Q. After you made an image of Government Exhibit 54, what do
23 you do next?
24 A. After the 54 was imaged, I then placed it through our
25 software, AccessData's lab to categorize and organize the data.
