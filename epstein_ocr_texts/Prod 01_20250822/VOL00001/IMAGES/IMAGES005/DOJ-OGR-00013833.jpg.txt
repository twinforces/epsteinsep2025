Ghislaine to have GhisSlatine arrange thé travel. But she dida't

even offer it. herself, lt seems like the best we have on this

record is that. she performed a ministérial functtion of
arranging, the travel. But that is not doing something, a
cause, that producés an effect; that is simply doing paperwork.
That is not what the statute was designed to criminalize,
There has to bé some effort to entice or perstidde or induce
somebody to travel, which we do net have en this record.

And one casé I would diréct your Honor to is, United
States v. Joseph, 942 F.3d 13 (2d Cir, 2008). In that case,

the Sééond Ciréuit reversed the cénviétion for enticement under

this same statute, 2422, because the jury was instructed that
they could convict if they found the defendant made the
possibility of a sex act "more appealing," as iff that was.
enough to entice, if they made it more appealing.

The court held, that. that. was net enough to establish

persuasion, inducement, sniticement under the statute. And hére

we don't even have that. We just have her performing what a
travel agent would do, which is arranging travel plans. And

that, 1s net enough, under the wording of the statute, to prove

enticement. And theré is nothing also from any member of the
arrange or induce the travel.
So I would argue, ‘your Honor, that on. the record we

have before us, there is insufficient evidence to establish
