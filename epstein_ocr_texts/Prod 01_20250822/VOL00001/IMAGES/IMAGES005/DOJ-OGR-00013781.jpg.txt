1 MS. POMERANTZ: If we can bring up 3514-001 on page 3.
2 Blow up the top paragraph.

3 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I'm not sure what the

4 witness is being shown the document for.

5 THE COURT: I'll allow it. I will see, but I presume
6 prior consistent statements following impeachment of prior

7 inconsistent statements.

8 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. But either the

9 witness recalls it from memory or needs to be refreshed, and

10 that's the part that's not a matter of record in this

11 procedure.

12 THE COURT: Fair enough. You'll ask the specific

13 question and then we can take it from there.

14 You can take it down.

15 BY MS. POMERANTZ:

16 Q. Annie, do you recall what you told the FBI in 2006 about

17 the massage that Maxwell had given you?

18 A. I recall the parts that I've described.

19 Q. Can you explain?
20 A. Yes. Again, that she had me lay on the table, that she was
21 eager for me to experience the massage and asked me to, you
22 know, lay on the table, to undress, to lay under the sheets,
23 and then she began rubbing my body. Eventually, she pulled
24 back the sheet —-—
25 MS. MENNINGER: Objection. Narrative, your Honor.
