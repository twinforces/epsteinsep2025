LCKCmax7 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey

1 York. Epstein wanted to get her back in his clutches as

2 quickly as he could, and he wanted his right-hand woman there

3 to help groom her. That's how you know it happened in '96.

4 And this thing about flight records, also a

5 distraction. If you want to take a look for yourself, go to

6 Government Exhibit 662 at page 40, look at the flight on March
7 29th, 1996. You'll see Jeffrey Epstein flying to Santa Fe, New
8 Mexico. The next flight is more than a week later, April 8th,
9 1996. Maxwell is on that next flight with Epstein. That span
10 of time of more than a week covers a weekend. Take a look at
11 that, ladies and gentlemen.
12 And third, Ms. Menninger talked a lot about Jane's
13 testimony on cross examination. And to give you an example of
14 some supposedly "aha" moment, she showed you a question that
15 she asked Jane that was written like a riddle. Remember that
16 question, it was, you don't recall Maxwell and Epstein being in
17 the room, correct, and Jane answered no. What that means is,
18 no, that's not correct. Ms. Menninger was trying to mislead
19 you about what the answer to that riddle-like question meant
20 just like she was trying to mislead you about what nothing has
al ever been difficult for me meant on that Interlochen
22 application. Don't be distracted by that nonsense.
23 I want to walk through the main arguments at the core
24 of what the defense has said to you today about these
25 witnesses.
