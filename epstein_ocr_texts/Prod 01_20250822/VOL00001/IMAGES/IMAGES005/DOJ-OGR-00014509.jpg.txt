LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 They know each other. This isn't some Eva that the

2 government's now gone back and scrambled and found a name in an
3 address book.

4 The next group of people she talks about is Emmy. She
a remembers Emmy was British and she was in the group sexualized
6 massages, and there was a woman named Michelle. And now the

7 government wants to suggest that Michelle is some random

8 Michelle and we don't know who Michelle is, and Michelle could
9 be any old Michelle, and look at this address book with

10 Michelle's name. There is Michelles everywhere.

11 But Jane told you from the stand it wasn't just any

12 old Michelle, it's the Michelle that she hung out with her and
13 Emmy. So it's Emmy's friend, Michelle, and she said it was

14 Emmy's friend, Michelle, that she hung out with. And you heard
15 Michelle on the stand say that's the Michelle, I'm the Michelle
16 that hung out with Emmy. I don't know any other Michelles that
17 Emmy hung out with. And no, we weren't involved in any group
18 sexualized massages. I'm a housewife.

19 What you see here is a pattern, you see a pattern of
20 Jane picking names out of people she knew she met in Epstein's
21 world at some point in time. The receptionist, the first
22 person you see when you come into his office, and she came in
23 there with her mom. That's the one now she remembers she was
24 in a group sexualized massage with or a person she saw in the
25 flight log with another person ina flight log.
