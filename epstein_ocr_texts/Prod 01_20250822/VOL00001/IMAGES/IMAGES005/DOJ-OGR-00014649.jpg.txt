LCKCmax9 Charge

1 conscientious belief as to how the issues should be decided.

2 Thus, the verdict must represent the considered

3 judgment of each juror. In order to return a verdict, it is

4 necessary that each juror agree to it. Your verdict must be

5 unanimous.

6 If at any time you are divided, do not report how the

7 vote stands, and if you have reached a verdict, do not report

8 what it is until you are asked in open court.

9 A verdict form has been prepared for your convenience.
10 After you've reached your decision, your foreperson will fill
11 in the form. At that point, the foreperson should advise the
12 marshal outside your door that you are ready to return to the
13 courtroom.

14 Finally, I say this not because I think it necessary,
15 but because it is the custom in this courthouse to say this:
16 You should treat each other with courtesy and respect during
17 your deliberations.
18 In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that if
19 you listen to the views of your fellow jurors and if you apply
20 your own common sense, you will deliberate fairly.
21 Members of the jury, I ask your patience for a few
22 minutes longer. It's necessary for me to spend a few moments
23 with counsel and the reporter at sidebar. I'll ask you to
24 remain patiently in the jury box without speaking to each other
25 and we will return in just a moment to submit the case to you.
