L€HCmax3 Dubin, - direct

THE COURT: Can we have the witnéss wait outside for a
moment. I apologize. Thank you, Go ahead.

MS. MOE! To flag in advance, I think. Mr. Pagliuca
intends tq offer a redacted. version of a government exhibit
that we've agreed upon, but is, not ‘yet in evidence, and so I
anticipate that he'll offer a redacted version of the
government exhibit, which we prepared dnd we won't object. And
that will be the exhibit that is published.
