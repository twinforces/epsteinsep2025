LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 and her brothers to stay in those apartments. Nothing about

2 Jane staying in Epstein's house.

3 And the same is true with the Santa Fe property. She
4 told you she stayed in this big grand house, a big, big

5 structure, big house. Annie told you she was there at roughly
6 the same time and there was no big ranch. It was a small

7 residence. Larry Visoski told you that big ranch wasn't built
8 until the late '90s, and guess what, there is a flight log

9 entry showing that Jane went there when she was 21 when the big
10 house was there. That's when Jane went to Santa Fe. She

11 didn't remember her other trips, her trips abroad.

12 We know her memory was contaminated post-event because
13 she was talking to her family members, her exboyfriend, Matt.
14 She was reading the news, she hired a lawyer to cancel all the
15 news about her, not to report this claim. She was reading the
16 news and now she's incorporating all of those facts into her

17 head and trying to make some kind of sense out of it.

18 She has deliberately, however, attempted to move the
19 timeline back to make herself younger when she was with
20 Epstein.
21 She did that, first, by telling the government that
22 she was in the same house for three years when she met Epstein
23 until the time she moved to New York. She was in the same
24 house. She lived in the same house. It was in a gated
25 community in Bear Lake Estates, the same house, a three-bedroom
