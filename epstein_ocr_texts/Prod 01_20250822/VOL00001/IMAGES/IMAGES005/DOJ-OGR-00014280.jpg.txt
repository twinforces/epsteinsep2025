1 the letter, I think, is a sort of separate matter than the

2 summary judgment opinion and the answers. Those are ones where

3 all we have is a summary judgment opinion. We don't know what

4 the basis was for it. And we have some answers to cross-â€”claims

5 in which Mr. Epstein asserts some facts to which we don't know

6 what the question was.

7 And I suppose this brings me to the broader point

8 which applies to the letter and Epstein deposition as well,

9 which is that this was not a material fact in that litigation;
10 and so there was no reason for the government to litigate when
11 Mr. Epstein, in fact, lived in and was occupying the particular
12 residences.

13 What mattered in that litigation is that at some point
14 in early 1996, Mr. Epstein made an attempt to do an illegal
15 sublet of the property; and so the government was suing for
16 ejectment and back rent from Mr. Epstein. But it did not
17 matter to the government whether Mr. Epstein abandoned the
18 property in January 1996, December 1995, November 1995. There
19 was no reason for that to be litigated in the course of that
20 litigation. It just mattered that he abandoned the property
21 before he tried to do the illegal sublet. That's why it's in
22 the background section of Judge Chin's opinion; that's why it's
23 not a significant portion of any of the other documents. There
24 is absolutely no reason to take judicial notice of it. And
25 actually for the same reason, it's not subject to the 804
