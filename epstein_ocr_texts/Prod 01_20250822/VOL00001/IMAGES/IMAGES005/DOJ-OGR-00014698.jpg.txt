1 across state lines has to be that Jane engaged in illicit

2 sexual activity. There is no significant or motivating purpose
3 of a return trip where Mr. Epstein wasn't present; it's just a
4 return trip from New Mexico. That would not be a significant

a or motivating purpose. She is just presumably going home, but
6 is not for the purpose of engaging in illicit sexual activity.
7 The testimony, if we are to believe it, is that she

8 went to New Mexico for some purpose to engage in sexual

9 activity, that's if you believe Jane's testimony. But

10 returning from there is not that purpose. Returning is

11 returning, or it's going somewhere else; it's going somewhere
12 away from where -- at least in the record, the evidence in the
13 record, if there is any -- Epstein was presumably in New

14 Mexico. This is her leaving New Mexico. So I don't think that
15 qualifies as a significant or motivating purpose. That travel
16 across state lines is for some other purpose.

17 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I don't believe this note is

18 that clear about what flight we're talking about. The note

19 begins by talking about an unspecified return flight, and then
20 it turns to talking about a flight to New Mexico. Then there's
al a modifying clause about intent. It is unclear which of the
22 two flights we are now modifying.
23 I think the safest course here is to refer the jury to
24 the elements of the crime. I think guessing at what flight
25 they may be talking about is sort of beyond the reach of this
