LC 7VMAX7 Carolyn - cross

1 THE COURT: Okay. Should I look at 33?

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, 33. The first inconsistency with
3 the direct testimony is the date, July of 2002.

4 THE COURT: I don't know -- so again, return to --

6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, the indictment says 2001. In her
7 direct testimony she said 2001, and on the cross-examination,

9 THE COURT: So you have to use a full sentence so I

10 can track you. She said the first incident was in 2001.

11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.

12 THE COURT: She then talked about 100 additional

13 incidents —--

14 MR. PAGLIUCA: Right.

15 THE COURT:  —-- over the course of at least a couple of
16 years. So what's inconsistent in July of 2002, she again

20 spot, and goes through 2003. So the entirety of the allegation
2l is that these events occurred between 2002 and 2003, not 2001
22 and 2004. And so this is impeachment on the time frame that is
23 alleged in the indictment and testified to by the witness on
24 direct examination.
25 THE COURT: Is there a paragraph that talks about the
