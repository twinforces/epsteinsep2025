LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 back in the '90s, can we talk about that. No. No, they didn't
2 do that.

3 Jane told about a woman named Sophie. She gave a

4 description. She was blond and pretty. She said Sophie

5 married a racecar driver and Sophie joined in these sexual

6 massages.

7 And then she told the government about a woman named

8 Eva, correct, she did not use a last name, but Eva. And this

9 wasn't just some disconnected Eva that showed up in an address
10 book from some unknown time in the future, jane said that Eva
11 joined in with Sophie. She joined in with Sophie. Those were
12 your words, yes, Eva joined in with Sophie.

13 So where would Jane have gotten these names, Sophie

14 and Eva, if the massage didn't really happen and she was trying
15 to come up with some names? Well, let's look. Sure enough, on
16 her very first flight log entry that has her name on it from

17 November of 1996, she's on a flight with Sophie and Eva. What
18 are the odds that the very first flight she takes is with two
19 women who she claims are on a group sexualized massage?
20 Let's look at Eva. Eva is flying with her child and
21 her nanny. She told you on the stand that she just had a baby.
22 Do you think that Dr. Eva Dubin that you just saw on the stand
23 with a child and a nanny who's on a flight with Sophie, she
24 joined in with Sophie was in a group sexualized massage. Eva
25 told you she knows Sophie. Sophie was a professional masseuse.
