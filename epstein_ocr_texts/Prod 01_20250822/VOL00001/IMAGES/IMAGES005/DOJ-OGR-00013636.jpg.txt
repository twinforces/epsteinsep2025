1 her.

2 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, just to the extent it's

i) why she went, it's, I understand after the conversation with

4 the mother, I went to New Mexico. But if it's the content from
5 the mother to her, that's where it gets into the hearsay piece.
6 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, just to clarify, the jury just
7 heard this witness say she felt uncomfortable around Jeffrey

8 Epstein; and that she knew something was wrong. The point of

9 this is not to give the truth of what the mother said, but to
10 explain why she was willing to go back to see Jeffrey Epstein
11 again. That is all we're trying to elicit.
12 THE COURT: Youtre trying to elicit that her mother
13 told her that Maxwell would be there, which is for the truth
14 and hearsay. In any event, because it is central to the
15 question coming in as hearsay, there's a 403 issue. I think
16 you can get this -- you can get who was there, etc., but not
17 what her mother told her for the truth, which is, I think,
18 plainly what you're trying to do.
19 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I can be more precise.
20 I think the questions would be, Did you feel
21 comfortable going to New Mexico? Why did you feel comfortable
22 going to New Mexico? And then we wouldn't object to a limiting
23 instruction. It's not offered for the truth, it's to explain
24 the progress of events and why she would feel comfortable doing
25 something like that.
