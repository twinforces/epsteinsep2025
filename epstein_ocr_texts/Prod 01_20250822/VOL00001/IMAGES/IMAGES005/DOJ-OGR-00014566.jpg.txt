LCKCmax7 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey

1 contact book, the message pads, the FedEx records, you have

2 evidence on top of the witnesses.

3 The defense spent most of their time attacking Jane,

4 Kate, Carolyn, and Annie, and now it's obvious why they did

5 that. Those four witnesses gave you the most damning testimony

6 in this trial. If you believe those women, then that's it, the

7 defendant is guilty. So of course the defendant is spewing out

8 anything they can think of to attack these women.

9 I'm not going to respond to every single sideshow that
10 Ms. Menninger tried to lead you down about each of these women,
11 but let me just address a few of the most obviously false ones.
12 First, there is literally no evidence in this record
13 of an age limit at the Epstein Victim Compensation Fund.

14 That's something Ms. Menninger just made up. There is nothing
15 in the record to say you have to be a particular age to put in
16 a claim to that fund.
17 Second, the suggestion that Annie was 17, not 16 when
18 she went to Santa Fe. Three different witnesses, Annie, her
19 mother, and her high school boyfriend all remember that Annie
20 took that Thailand trip the summer between her junior and her
21 senior year. David Mulligan remembered she had just gotten
22 back when they started dating and that she went after they met
23 at junior prom. They didn't just make that up.
24 And remember, this trip to Santa Fe with Annie took
25 place close in time to the trip around Christmas time to New
