New York. Btit. there is no hard, evidence that ‘there was
enticement. to travel, convineing her to travel for that

The only other point. I would make, your Hohor, is that
I, want to be clear on the mecornd that. we ane making this
applicéatién as to all Counts, although tiy comments are reserved
for the first two counts.

material today.

THE COURT: Counsel?

MR. PAGLIUCA: We should have those materials today,

your Hohor. There's a little bit of fluidity ih terms of thé

witnesses, and perhaps even if there are Rule 26 materials,

frankly, which I don't suspect that there are.
