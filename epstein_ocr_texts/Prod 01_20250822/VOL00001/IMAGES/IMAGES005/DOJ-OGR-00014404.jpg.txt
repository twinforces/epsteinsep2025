1 MS. MENNINGER: Yes.

2 THE COURT: It won't be more than two and a half?

3 MS. MENNINGER: It will what?

4 THE COURT: Not be more than two and a half?

5 MS. MENNINGER: Correct, your Honor.

6 THE COURT: All right. So here's what we're going to
7 do: The government will go straight through, we'll then break
8 and I will have the jurors' lunch -- an early lunch at that

9 point. It will be short, 20 to 30 minutes. We come back, the
10 defense goes all the way through. We take a short comfort

11 break, ten minutes, and then government rebuttal and my charge
12 and begin deliberations if we have time.

13 I had told the jury to prepare to stay until 6:00 in
14 case we needed that to get through what we need to do, that

15 remains true. As is my practice, what I'll tell them is they
16 can let us know when they would like to leave for the evening,
17 if they're in agreement to continue their deliberations until
18 they indicate to us that they're ready to call it a night.

19 MS. MENNINGER: And then does your Honor have the
20 practice of counsel being within a certain --
21 THE COURT: Oh, yes.
22 MS. MENNINGER: -- in the building or what's your
23 Honor's preference?
24 THE COURT: Look, we need to be able to --
25 MS. MENNINGER: Yes.
