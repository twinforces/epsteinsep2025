accurately about'?

MS, STERNHEIM: Well, at. first she wasn't sure, And

then when she Saw it, she didn't deny it. But I think that it

igs a recording of her own email, There is no issue ag to
alithenticity.

THE COURT: It's. mot an authenticity objection;, it"s a
hedrsay objection.

Again, IL think her testimony would be described as she

recalled it well enough to testify fully and accurdtely because
it doesn't conflict with what's in here, So it's not. the same
analysis as prior incdénsistent Statement, but I think thé
initial question is what did she not testify to fully and
accurately.

MS. STERNHEIM: I just think it as conrobkorative of,
her testimohy and more reliable thah just coming from thé stand
when it 1s her own, written, statement to the co-conspirator in.
this Gase.

MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honon, that's not responsive to.
the questions And also, as the Court has noted, it just.
doesn't meet the standard that's articulated under 9A in terms
of thé quéstidn is whether it's on a matter that the witness

once knew about, but. now cannot recall well enough to testify

fully and accurately. And that's just hot the case here, your
Honor...
THE COURT: Okay.
