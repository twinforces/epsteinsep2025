LCKCmax7 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey

1 What year was it that I ruined that pie and it was salty? Just
2 because you can't remember exactly how old you were, which

3 Thanksgiving it was, does that mean it didn't happen? Of

4 course not.

5 The same is true of Jane and Carolyn. The abuse

6 stands out in their mind because it was formative, but it

7 happened so often that the details run together. They remember
8 certain things like when someone else was in the room or going
9 to get to see The Lion King during one of the trips, but those
10 can be hard to place in time because of how frequent and

11 Similar their experiences were.

12 Now, by contrast, Annie had a much smaller window of
13 interactions with Maxwell and Epstein. So for her, many more
14 details stand out very vividly. It's less like Thanksgiving

15 for her and more like a sweet 16 party, something unique that
16 only happens once, so it stands out much more clearly in every
17 detail.

18 For Jane and Carolyn, even though some of those

19 peripheral details got jumbled, they have solid memories of the
20 core events. And you know from the defense's own expert that
21 when an event you're remembering is traumatic, not just some
22 holiday, the memory is going to be even stronger.
23 Like Jane, she remembers Maxwell being in the room.
24 The presence of a woman that she had looked up to like an older
25 sister during this horrifying sexual abuse is a traumatic core
