LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 culture of silence? I didn't see them.

2 They told you you'd hear from law enforcement

3 witnesses and they promised photographs of the search of the

4 Palm Beach house, and that search in 2019 of the New York

5 mansion that would show that Epstein lived in mansions filled

6 with photographs of naked women with a massage room in each one
7 of those houses. You didn't see a single massage room with

8 naked women in it. I didn't. You saw a closet with photos of
9 friends and family in Palm Beach where the massage table was

10 stored, but there were no nude photos in the New York

11 residence, there were no massage rooms in New Mexico. Kate

12 said she saw a massage room in Ghislaine Maxwell's house in

13 London, but Cim Espinosa said she was there and there was no

14 massage room there. So law enforcement witnesses failed to

15 deliver on that promise. And you might have also noticed the
16 government didn't even call to the stand the two case agents in
17 charge of this investigation. Why would that be?

18 The government promised you evidence from these

19 searches, a massage table, a schoolgirl outfit, and nude
20 photographs. You saw the 20-year-old massage table sitting up
21 here in the courtroom. What did that tell you? You didn't see
22 a schoolgirl outfit, you didn't see all these nude photographs.
23 You saw some artistic drawings around a rich man's house.
24 You saw FedEx records that showed Ghislaine Maxwell
25 didn't send any underage girl anything. The same FedEx records
