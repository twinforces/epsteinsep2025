1 A. I would say maybe around 100.

2 Q. And I think you touched on this, but just to be clear, who
3 hires you for forensic work?

4 A. The vast majority of the time I'm hired by an attorney. At
5 other times I might be hired by the state. For example, at one
6 point in my career the state of Rhode Island hired me to

7 perform forensic evaluations on children and adolescents who

8 had become involved with the juvenile justice department. But
9 at this point the vast majority of individuals who hire me are
10 attorneys.
11 Q. And are those attorneys on just the plaintiff's side or can
12 you explain that for the jury.
13 A. Sure. So when I'm working in a criminal arena, I might be
14 hired by the prosecution or I might be hired by the defense.
15 And if I'm working in a civil case, again, I might be hired by
16 the person who's working on behalf of the plaintiff or the
17 person who's working on behalf of the defense.
18 As a forensic psychologist, I'm coming in and
19 providing an independent evaluation. So I'll work for all
20 sides of -- all parties of a case.
21 Q. Dr. Rocchio, what licenses do you hold?
22 A. I hold a psychology license in the states of Rhode Island,
23 Massachusetts, and New York.
24 Q. In your career, for approximately how many years have you
25 treated and assessed patients?
