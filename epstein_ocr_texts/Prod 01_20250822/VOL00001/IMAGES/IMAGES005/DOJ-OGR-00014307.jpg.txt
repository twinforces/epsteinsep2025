1 MR. EVERDELL: I can pull this up a little bit?

2 THE COURT: -- if I'm going to hear from you a lot.

3 But yes, pull up the mic and -- yes. First page, Mr. Everdell.
4 MR. EVERDELL: Defense's first page is page 15.

5 THE COURT: Okay. Line?

6 MR. EVERDELL: Well, we'll start with line 8 and 9.

7 THE COURT: Okay.

8 MR. EVERDELL: So this was the summary of the

9 indictment charge, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: Yes.

11 MR. EVERDELL: And on 8 and 9, there's a reference to
12 travel to both interstate and foreign commerce. I think

13 throughout the charge there's a bit of an inconsistency.

14 Sometimes wetre talking about just interstate, sometimes we're
15 talking about interstate and foreign. I actually don't think
16 that there's any evidence, especially with respect to Count One
17 or the Mann Act charges or any of them, we're talking about

18 "and foreign commerce." I think it's interstate commerce, so I
19 don't think the "and foreign" is necessary.
20 THE COURT: I think we have -â€”- Mr. Rohrbach?
21 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, this actually relates to
22 the government's later request, but the government's view is
23 that there are flight records that show Virginia Roberts
24 traveling with the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein overseas while
25 she is 17, I believe, and so that would be sufficient, at least
