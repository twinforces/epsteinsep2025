LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 boyfriends, and Annie didn't say any sexual topics were

2 involved? Where's the normalizing going on there? And by the
3 way, this story about normalizing and making it seem casual,

4 Jane told you when she was first abused she was taken alone

S into a pool room -- pool house where Epstein masturbated on

6 her. Ghislaine wasn't even there and she's trying to make it

7 seem like she thought that was normal because she got one joke
8 about boyfriends? Use your common sense.

9 Then again, there's that promise that you would learn
10 that sometimes Ghislaine was in the room when it happened,

11 except Jane can't actually remember any one of those times or
12 what happened during those times.

13 Finally, the government promised you a motive, and the
14 motive that they came up with was that Ghislaine, a happy,

15 educated, beautiful woman in her 30s would just start and end
16 her career as a facilitator of sexual abuse for one man,

17 Jeffrey Epstein, because they said he was a means to support

18 her lifestyle and she needed to stay in a lifestyle to which

19 she had become accustomed. That's why they claim she became a
20 facilitator of sexual abuse, and where was the evidence they
21 delivered to you about that?
22 First, it was clear Epstein was a manipulator of
23 everyone around him. He's having Juan Alessi take down photos
24 of Ghislaine when he brings other women to the house. He's
25 dating women behind her back.
