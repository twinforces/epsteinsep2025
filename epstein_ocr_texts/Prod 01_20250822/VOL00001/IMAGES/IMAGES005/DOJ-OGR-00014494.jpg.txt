boyfriends, and Annie didn't Say any Séxual topics were
involved? Where's the normalizing going en there? And. by the
way, this story about normalizing and making vt séem casual,
Jane told you when. she was first abused she was taken alone
into @ pool room -- pool house where Epstein masturbated on
her. Ghislaine wasn't even there’ and she's trying to make it
seem, like she thotight ‘that was normal, because she got one joke
about. boyfriends? Use your common. sense,

Then again, there's that promise ‘that you, would léarn,
that sometimes Ghislaine was in the reom when it happened,
except Jané cdn't actually remember any one of thdse times or
what, happened during those times.

Finally, the goverhment promised you a métive, and the
motive that they came up with was that Ghislaine, a happy,
educated, beautiful woman in Her 308 would just start. and end
her career as a facilitator of sexual abuse fon one man,
Jeffrey Epstein, because they said he was a means to support
her lifestyle and she meeded to stay in a Lifestyle to which

she had become accusto6med. That's why they claim shé became a

facilitator of sexual. abuse, and where was the evidence they
delivered to you about that?

First, it was clear Epstein was a manipulator of
everyéne around him. He's having Juan Aléssi take down photos
of Ghislaine when He brings other women to the House. He's
dating women behind. her back.
