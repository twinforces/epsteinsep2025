Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 247 of 257 3081
LCKCmax9 Charge

1 in writing or by having you return to the courtroom so I can

2 speak with you in person. In any communication, please do not
3 tell me or anyone else how the jury stands on the issue of the
4 jury's verdict until after a unanimous verdict is reached.

5 For those of you who took notes during the course of

6 the trial, you should not show your notes to or discuss your

7 notes with any other juror during your deliberations. Any

8 notes you have taken are to assist you and you alone. The fact
9 that a particular juror has taken notes entitles that juror's
10 views to no greater weight than those of any other juror.

11 Finally, your notes are not to substitute for your

12 recollection of the evidence in this case. If you have any

13 doubt as to any testimony, you may request that the official

14 transcript that has been made of these proceedings be read or
15 otherwise provided to you.

16 Concluding Remarks.

17 Members of the jury, that about concludes my

18 instructions to you. The most important part of this case,

19 members of the jury, is the part that you, as jurors, are now
20 about to play as you deliberate on the issues of fact. It's
21 for you and you alone to weigh the evidence in this case and
22 determine whether the government has proved beyond a reasonable
23 doubt each of the essential elements of the crime with which
24 Ms. Maxwell is charged. If the government has succeeded, your
25 verdict should be guilty as to that charge. If it has failed,
