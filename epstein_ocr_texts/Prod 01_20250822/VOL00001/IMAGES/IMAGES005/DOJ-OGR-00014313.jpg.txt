1 sexual activity as charged in the indictment, which is a

2 reference to the violation of New York law, because that is the
3 theory we're proceeding under.

4 With respect to Carolyn, there was no limiting

5 instruction, but it's evident we were talking about Florida

6 conduct. There is no violation of New York law there. So the
7 only evidence we have that goes to -- that actually establishes
8 a violation of New York law, which is the object of this

9 conspiracy, and the object of the transportation conspiracy, is
10 what Jane said.
11 Now the Court did instruct the jury that they can
12 consider the testimony of Kate and of Annie for whatever
13 relevant purpose they see fit, and I suppose that could be
14 evidence of a conspiracy, correct, but for them to actually
15 convict on this, they have to believe that somebody committed a
16 violation of New York law, and that relates solely to Jane, and
17 so we don't think -- there are no multiple alleged victims of
18 this conspiracy other than Jane that's been established by the
19 evidence at trial. So we believe while they may be able to
20 consider the testimony of Annie and Kate as evidence of some
21 sort of relevant evidence that speaks to this conspiracy, that
22 is not -- they are not victims of this conspiracy, there was no
23 violation of New York law that they testified to, and that is
24 Jane alone. So this count relates solely to Jane, as does the
25 substantive count, your Honor.
