1 A. No, I was not.

2 Q. I believe the co-case agents for that investigation were

5 A. Yes, Sir.

6 Q. They were in charge of the investigation?

7 A. Yes.

8 Q. And your job was to help out on the day that the search was
9 executed; right?

10 A. Yes, Sir.

11 Q. You were leading the Evidence Collection Team?

12 A. That's correct.

13 Q. So your job was to go through the various rooms in the

14 house, take photographs, and then search and seize any evidence
15 that you might find; right?

16 A. Yes, Sir.

17 Q. Now that you did more than one search warrant on those two
18 days, July 6th and 7th; isn't that right?

19 A. Yes, Sir.
20 Q. That's because when you first went into the residence and
21 you did a protective sweep of the area, you saw certain items
22 that weren't covered by the first warrant, so you went and got
23 a broader warrant; right?
24 A. Yes, sir.
25 Q. And I think you said there was yet even another warrant
