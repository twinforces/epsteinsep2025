1 THE COURT: Sustained.

2 Q. The testimony that you gave here today, would it have been
3 any different if you had been called to the stand by the

4 government?

5 A. I don't think -- I don't see how it would have been any

6 different. I think in the case where I did testify for the

7 prosecution, it was similar testimony.

8 Q. And if the prosecution had called you, you would have been
9 available to be a witness for them, wouldn't you?

10 A. I might have been.

11 MS. STERNHEIM: No further questions. Thank you.

12 THE COURT: Ms. Pomerantz?

13 MS. POMERANTZ: No, nothing further from the

14 government. Thank you, your Honor.

15 THE COURT: Thank you. All right.

16 Professor Loftus, you may step down. You are excused.
17 (Witness excused)

20 THE COURT: Sure.
21 Mr. Everdell?
22 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.
23 The defense calls Michael Aznaran.
24 THE COURT: Okay.
