1 doesn't exceed the scope of the ordinary practice.

2 THE COURT: Let's take the specific example that

3 you've given on message pads. So just give me an example of

4 the kind of testimony he would provide there.

a) MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

6 So, for examole, within the message pads, we published

7 yesterday, I think, just either two or three specific messages

8 that had a first and last name of someone and a phone number.

9 But elsewhere throughout the message pads, there appear entries
10 that only have a first name, and sometimes that entry is, for
11 example, Carolyn and sometimes it's Caroline. But when you
12 compare the phone numbers -- and there are a variety of
13 different phone numbers throughout the book -- it becomes clear
14 that Caroline is the same Carolyn, first and last name, as some
15 of the other messages, because there's continuity between the
16 phone numbers.

17 And there are a variety of different phone numbers
18 throughout the exhibits with different names like Carolyn,
19 Caroline, and Carolyn with a last name. And reviewing them and
20 analyzing them makes it clear throughout the books and across a
2l variety of different dates that we're talking about the same
22 person. And so that facilitates both publishing the exhibits
23 so that the jury can see them for the first time, and doing
24 that in a way that sort of connects up those different
25 exhibits. And so that's the purpose of that testimony.
