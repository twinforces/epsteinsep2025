mean the flight records that are in evidence?

MS, MOE: That"s mot correct, your Honor, The

entirety of the flight records in evidence aré not public.

That's the exact reason why portions of them are under seal and

redactéd. So we're not talking about ‘the same flight records.
MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, I disagree, but the point is, we

had, a live witness who réviewed what purportéd to be in the

media her travel with Mr, Epstein, That media exposure has

inflttenced other people and, TI believe, frankly, influenced

other people, relative to my client, putting my client ‘on
flights sdying my client did things. It is the exposure to
this information. This witness, I belleve, will testify, and
has §6 indicated to the gGévernment, that what. she viewed was
inaccurate information. That's the import of it.

THE COURT: So the theory is media defined broadly,
could be a blog, a tweet, contains any inaccurate information,
it is relévant. to ask this witness as to the accuracy of that?

MR. PAGLIUCA: It is imaccurate as to her personally.

THE COURT: I understand. But let's say you pull from
some blog post, something perhaps imaccurate; melevant to ask
this witnéss?

MR. PAGLIUCA: About her and flight records.

THE COURT: Whatever it is from whatever source, there
is flight, records that show she went to the moon, you should
ask her about it?
