1 bear those in mind.

2 I want to just briefly make a couple points about the
3 schedule to keep you updated. Next week will be just like this
4 week, Monday through Friday, same timing. Please arrive by

5 9:15 so we can start at 9:30 and we'll stop at 5:00. Your

6 arriving every day on time has really helped us keeping things
7 moving along at a good pace, so I'm grateful for that.

8 The week after next, we're not going to sit Monday,

9 Tuesday, or Wednesday. So we will not sit December 13th, 14th,
10 or 15th. So that week it will be just be December 16th and

11 17th. T'll remind you of this next week, too. Next week,

12 regular. Week after that, we won't sit. Week after that,

13 which is the week before Christmas, we will sit Monday,

14 Tuesday, Wednesday. So that's December 20th, 21th, and 22nd,
15 but we won't sit December 23rd or 24th. And the week after

16 that, which is the week before New Year's, we'll sit Monday,

17 Tuesday, Wednesday. So that's December 27th, 28th, and 29th.
18 Will not sit December 30th or 31st. So just wanted to keep you
19 up to date on the current schedule. I'm so grateful for your
20 attention and diligence. I wish you a very good weekend, and
21 have a good night.
