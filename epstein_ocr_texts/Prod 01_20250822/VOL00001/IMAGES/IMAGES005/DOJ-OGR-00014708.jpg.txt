1 which is the substantive transportation count, which, as we

2 know, has to deal with the violation of New York law. And they
3 are talking about flights to New Mexico; and can she be found

4 guilty on the second element of Count Four regarding these

5 flights to New Mexico.

7 score as well, which is the fact that they have to be

8 considering New York events for Count Four, rather than -- or

9 violations of New York law, which wouldn't occur in New Mexico
10 for there to be a conviction on Count Four.

11 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I think that's exactly why we

12 proposed directing the jurors to the entirety of the

13 instruction, which says just that. The second paragraph of

14 that same instruction reminds the jury, as the instruction does
15 throughout, that we're talking about New York Penal Law,

16 Section 130.55. And so I think our proposal remains the same
17 that they be referred to the entirety of the instruction, which
18 includes that language, among other aspects of this particular
19 element.
20 THE COURT: Yes.
21 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, may I be heard for a moment?
22 THE COURT: Sure.
23 MS. STERNHEIM: I think the fact that the jury has
24 mentioned New Mexico regarding a count that pertains to New
25 York is not just cleared up by referring them to the
