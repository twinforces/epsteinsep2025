1 use it, to show that she doesn't have an accurate recollection.

2 That is pure impeachment material.

3 THE COURT: Up to the point where you said it

4 contradicted what she said on the stand, you and I were in

5 vigorous agreement.

6 MR. EVERDELL: Okay.

7 THE COURT: Okay.

8 MR. EVERDELL: All right.

9 Well, what I would say is that we can't -- no, this is
10 not -- it's not as if we were going to introduce the photograph
11 of her house in our case-in-chief. We are doing this -- we had
12 it ready to be able to use it in case she said something that
13 we believe was contradictory and contradicted by the
14 photograph. So that's why we did not disclose it ahead of
15 time, because we believed it to be impeachment material.

16 By the way, Judge, I'll just note for the record that
17 when we sent our Rule 16 discovery several weeks ago to the
18 government, we included a cover letter, which I'm happy to
19 share with the Court --
20 THE COURT: I can imagine it reserved all your rights.
al And you can keep talking, but we remain in agreement.
22 MR. EVERDELL: Okay. And it cited all the cases that
23 we cited, and it said we do not consider impeachment material
24 or refreshing material case-in-chief material.
25 THE COURT: It is true. I think, Mr. Rohrbach agrees.
