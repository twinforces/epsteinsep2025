1 There are of course limitations on metadata and

2 whether it can tell whether a file was saved on a certain date
3 or whether a photograph was taken on a certain date or

4 otherwise. And to the extent the defense wants to put that at
5 issue, they're certainly welcome to do so.

6 In terms of its relevance, it shows that the nature of

8 victim was of a sexual nature. For example, when Mr. Alessi

9 testified about this victim, I believe the cross examination

10 about that was that she was a professional, that she was at

11 Mar-a-Lago, the defendant was only there for a treatment, and I
12 believe there was a lot of -- there were a lot of questions on
13 cross examination designed to suggest that she was a

14 professional masseuse. And if the defense intends to argue

15 that this person was a professional masseuse, it is certainly
16 relevant in response to that argument that, in fact, Epstein

17 had a topless photograph of her in a location that appears to
18 be a tropical island which would be consistent with flight

19 records along those lines. Again, it goes to the relationship
20 between the defendant, Epstein, and this victim, that it was of
21 a sexualized nature, which is consistent with witness
22 testimony.
23 With respect to the particular date of the photograph,
24 that is an issue that the defense is certainly free to explore
25 and put before the jury. I can't make a representation about
