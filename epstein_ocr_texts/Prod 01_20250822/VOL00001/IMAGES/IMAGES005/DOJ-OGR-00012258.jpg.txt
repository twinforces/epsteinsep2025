LC1VMAX7 Matt - direct

1 frustration about that. That is entirely consistent with her

2 testimony that she was, in fact, abused.

3 MS. STERNHEIM: But not with regard to her mother

4 having a confrontation.

5 THE COURT: Well, it's a prior consistent statement

6 that he heard related to the abuse which you've repeatedly

7 called into question in your opening and your direct and in

8 your cross-examination.

9 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I understand that. But we're
10 talking about prior consistent statements.

11 THE COURT: Right. The prior consistent statement is
12 that she was abused by Jeffrey Epstein.

13 MS. STERNHEIM: But they are bringing out a

14 conversation. If she wants to say, Did you know or learn that
15 she was abused? Yes. But a conversation that she had with her
16 mother is hearsay.

17 MS. MOE: Your Honor, it's not hearsay because it's a
18 prior consistent statement of Jane about her experiencing

19 sexual abuse.
20 THE COURT: Yes. Overruled.
