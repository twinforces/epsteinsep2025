1 MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't believe Ms. Dubin is here yet,
2 your Honor. I had her scheduled for 11 o'clock this morning -—-
3 THE COURT: Okay.

4 MR. PAGLIUCA: -- in anticipation of some other

5 testimony. I can reach out to her lawyer and see if she can be
6 here earlier.

7 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, if the defense doesn't have a
8 witness and would like to put on Agent Young, we can go ahead

9 and put on Agent Young. Again, we offered to stipulate.

10 THE COURT: Well, here we are.

11 We don't have another witness at the moment?

12 MR. EVERDELL: We have -—--— one moment, your Honor.

13 (Counsel conferred)

14 MS. MENNINGER: We haven't spoken to the people out in
15 the hall who have the witnesses. So if we can have a minute to
16 figure this out.

17 THE COURT: Okay. Why don't I give you a couple

18 minutes. We'll let the jury know we'll start in about 15

19 minutes, so they know we haven't forgotten about them. See
20 what you want to do, and then we'll come back and get started
al where we can.
22 Do I have a filing yet, Ms. Menninger?
23 MS. MENNINGER: No, your Honor. I wasn't able to
24 reach people in Colorado. They weren't at the office yet.
25 THE COURT: I'm sorry?
