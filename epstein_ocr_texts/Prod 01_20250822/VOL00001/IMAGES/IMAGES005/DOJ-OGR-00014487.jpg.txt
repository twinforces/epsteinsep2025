LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 questions weren't asked by the government, so they had to be

2 asked by us, and what you learn is that the truth was

3 manipulated and changed over time.

4 You also heard the manipulation of other storylines,

5 and I'll go through them, that Ghislaine is at the center of

6 all this, she's the right-hand woman, she's Cruella Devil and

7 the lady wears Prada all wrapped into one. This is a

8 manipulation of the truth as old as Hollywood, your Honor, and
9 ladies and gentlemen, and don't be fooled by it.

10 With the money on the line, the accusers' goal of

11 holding someone accountable for Jeffrey Epstein, who was dead
12 at the forefront, and the tape recorders turned off, the

13 accusers' memories started to shift.

14 BFarlier, Carolyn said it was Sarah Kellen, now she's
15 says it was Ghislaine Maxwell. Before Jane said she met only
16 Epstein on a park bench at Interlochen, now she saw Ghislaine
17 walk by and then, oh, by the time she got to trial, it was

18 Ghislaine who stopped and talked to her. Before it was, I have
19 no specific recollection of Ghislaine being in the room when it
20 happened. That became, I remember it being once or twice or
21 all the time. Before it was, I can't remember anything about a
22 sexualized foot massage. Now Annie hears Jeffrey moaning with
23 pleasure.
24 Professor Loftus explained to you that's not how
25 memory works. You don't acquire a memory, retain it, retrieve
