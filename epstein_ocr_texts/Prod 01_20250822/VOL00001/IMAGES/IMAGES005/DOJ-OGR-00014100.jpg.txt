LCGVMAX7 Hyppolite - direct

1 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think we can come to a

2 decision tonight by 8 o'clock. I'll be with Ms. Menninger

3 until 7:30. At 8 o'clock.

4 THE COURT: All right. So by 8 o'clock. So if there
5 is, and that requires briefing, when will I get your brief,

6 Mr. Pagliuca?

7 MR. PAGLIUCA: 8:05, your Honor.

8 THE COURT: It's in the can. Glad to hear it.

9 I don't know if you are joking, actually.

10 MR. PAGLIUCA: No, I'm not joking, your Honor. 8:05
11 is when you will get it.

12 THE COURT: Good deal. I like it.

13 Okay. A couple other odds and ends.

14 I got a letter yesterday from counsel for a potential
15 defense witness. As far as I could tell, there was no

16 application in the letter. I don't know if anyone has an

17 application.

18 MS. COMEY: I don't believe there's any application

19 from that witness or from the government with respect to that
20 witness, your Honor.
21 MS. MENNINGER: We don't have it, your Honor. I don't
22 know what you're talking about.
23 THE COURT: One of you was cc'd on it.
24 MS. COMEY: I believe Ms. Menninger was cc'd on it.
25 May I confer?
