1 romantic would mean a more involved relationship. I wasn't

2 aware of anything more than a couple.

3 Q. You never saw them kiss you said; right?

4 A. No.

5) Q. You never saw them hold hands?

6 A. No.

7 Q. Now, it's fair to say, isn't it, that a lot of women were

8 flying on the plane with Epstein in the mid '90s; isn't that

9 right?

10 A. That's correct.

11 Q. It's fair to say that there were plenty of times that

12 Epstein was flying on the plane with these women without

13 Ghislaine?

14 A. There has been times, sure.

15 Q. It appeared to you that these women were adult women?

16 A. Oh, yes.

17 Q. So from your vantage point, whether Ghislaine or any one of
18 these other women was somebody romantically involved or

19 something else, is a little blurry; right?
20 A. YSS.
21 Q. In fact, I think the only person you really considered to
22 be a girlfriend of Epstein was Eva Dubin; is that right?
23 A. That's the way she was introduced, as one of Mr. Epstein's
24 original first girlfriends, correct.
25 Q. By the time you started, she was an ex-girlfriend; right?
