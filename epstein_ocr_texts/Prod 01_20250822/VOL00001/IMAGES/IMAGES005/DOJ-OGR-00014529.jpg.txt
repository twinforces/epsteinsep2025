LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 Twelve years ago she was asked under oath to answer

2 questions about who was involved in the trafficking of her or

3 the sexual abuse of her. And she had lawyers who helped her

4 answer those questions. And again, she didn't say anything

5 about Ghislaine Maxwell. And then she even updated her answers
6 again. So she's looking at her answers to make sure that they
7 are accurate. And once again, she does not mention anything

8 about Maxwell.

9 She had a third opportunity to talk about who was

10 involved in this operation at the Epstein home. She gave a

11 deposition. And the deposition went on for hours. And she was
12 asked in that deposition, Are all of the things in your civil
13 complaint accurate? Do they include everything? Are they

14 complete? Are they true?

15 And she said, Yes, they are.

16 Not one mention of Ghislaine Maxwell in hours of

17 deposition testimony back in 2009. She may have mentioned that
18 Maxwell answered the phone once. But guess what? The

19 government grabbed all of those message pads which they talked
20 to you about, and there are message pads and there are message
21 pads, and you will get all these message pads back in the jury
22 deliberation room. And you will see there's not one single
23 message for Ghislaine Maxwell having to do with Carolyn. She's
24 calling for Epstein.
25 And look at the name on GX-2T in the upper right-hand
