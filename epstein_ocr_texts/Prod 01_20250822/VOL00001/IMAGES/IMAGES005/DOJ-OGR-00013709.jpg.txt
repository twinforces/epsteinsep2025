1 A. That's correct.

2 Q. And so after looking up Primal Fear and talking to your

6 Q. So you took some memory fragments that you had, Primal Fear
7 and prom, right?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. And you looked up things on the internet, right?

10 A. Yeah, I wanted to be accurate. I had just said the spring,

12 Q. And so you compared it to the release date of Primal Fear,
13 right?

14 A. Right.

15 Q. You compared it to your friends' memories of when prom was,
16 right?

17 A. Right.

18 Q. And that led you to be pretty confident that the trip

19 occurred in April of '96, right?
20 A. Right.
21 Q. And that's how you reconstructed your memory that it was
22 April of 1996?
