1 what should be on the CDs. But, no, I did not view any other

2 CDs on the day of the search.

3 Q. So you didn't compare the thumbnails with what was actually

5 A. No. I did view several CDs the next day, though.

6 Q. I'm just talking about on the day of the search.

7 A. Correct. Yes, sir.

8 Q. So any images of photos that were on those CDs were taken

9 off later; right?
10 A. Yes, Sir.
11 Q. Now you mentioned about how -- getting back to the safe,
12 there were certain items that you found on the day of the
13 search, but when you went back, they weren't there, but they
14 were returned later; is that right?
15 A. That's correct.
16 Q. So it was Mr. Khan, the attorney who brought suitcases that
17 had the items that were missing from before; right?
18 A. That's correct.
19 Q. And fair to say that you didn't see anything missing in
20 that inventory that was returned that day on the 11th?
21 A. No, sir, I did not.
22 Q. So you got back everything you thought should be there
23 based on what you had seen on the day of the search; right?
24 A. Yes, sir.
25 Q. Nothing missing?
