1 isn't impeaching her -- wouldn't be impeaching her testimony in
2 any way. We just don't understand the relevance of these

3 exhibits.

4 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, it's evidence that she

a maintained a relationship with the people in her abuser's --

6 alleged abuser's office. I mean, if she claims that she left

7 New York and she fled this life with Epstein and didn't want

8 anything more to do with it, this is evidence that she was

9 keeping contact with people in his orbit. Ms. Espinosa worked
10 in his office and was there with him in the office every day.
11 So it goes to show that there was a continuing

12 relationship. She voluntarily sent these photographs to her

13 showing that she maintained that relationship voluntarily,

14 which I think is the opposite of what you would do if what you
15 wanted to do was put all this behind you and not be a part of
16 this world anymore.

17 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, my recollection of Jane's
18 testimony was that she herself acknowledged that she had

19 maintained a relationship with some of the individuals and
20 their orbit on direct examination and in the course of her
21 testimony. So, again, I don't understand the relevance of
22 these photographs.
23 THE COURT: So just to be clear, you're saying that
24 evidence came in already that she maintained a relationship;
25 correct?
