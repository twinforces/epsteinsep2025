isn't impeaching hér -- wouldn't be impeaching her testimony in

any way, We just don't understand the relevance of these
exhibits.

MR. EVERDELL:; Your Honor, it's evidence that she
fiaintained a rélationship with ‘the people in her abiisér's --
alleged. abuser's office. I mean, if she claims that. she left
New York and she fled this life with Epstein and didn't want
anything more’ to do with it, this is evidence that she was
keeping contact with people in his orbit. Ms. Espinosa worked
in. his office and was. there with him in the office every day.

So it goés té shéw that there was a Continuing
relationship. She voluntarily sent these photographs ‘to her
showing that shé maintained that relationship voluntarily,
which I think is the opposite of what ‘you would, do if what you,
wanted to dd was put all this behind you and not be a part of
this world anymore.

MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honér, my recollection 6f Jane's
testimony was that she herself acknowledged, that, she had
maintained a relationship with some of the individuals and
their orbit on, direct examination and in the course of her

testimony. S6, again, I don't understand the relevance of

these photographs.

THE GOURT: So just to be clear, you're saying that

evidence came, in already that, she maintained a relationship;

conrect?
