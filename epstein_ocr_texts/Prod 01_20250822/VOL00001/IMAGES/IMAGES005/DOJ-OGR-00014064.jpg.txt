1 (Jury not present)

2 THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Everdell.

3 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, the exhibit is marked for

4 identification as MAl1, and I'll hand up a paper copy to the

S Court, and I believe the government has a copy, but I have

6 another one for them, as well.

7 THE COURT: Okay. I'll hear the objection.

8 MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor. Just briefly,
9 the question posed to the defense is what is the relevance of
10 these records, and in particular, we're talking about victim

11 travel records that go over 15 years of victim travel records
12 that extend well beyond the period charged in the indictment.
13 And so, we would ask for a proffer of relevance for the

14 admissibility of such extensive travel information, private

15 information of the victims.

16 THE COURT: So no objection within the charged

17 timeframe?

18 MS. POMERANTZ: No objection.

19 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, for example, these records
20 go up to 2010, which was the cutoff point for the request when
21 we issued the subpoena, we, in fact, negotiated with the
22 government over how broad the subpoena would be and we agreed
23 that it would go to 2010.
24 Now, as to the relevance -- and that's why the records
25 go that far.
