1 (Jury not present)

2 THE COURT: We have some matters to take up?

3 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. With respect to the Rule
4 16 issue, defendants Exhibit J36, what's never produced to the
5 government in Rule 16, the Court set a Rule 16 production

6 deadline of November 8th of this year. It appears that this

7 may have been taken November 17th of this year, but just

8 because it came into existence after that deadline does not

9 excuse the defense from producing anything that they plan to

10 offer in evidence in this trial. So this is a violation of

11 Rule 16.

12 THE COURT: Okay. Ms. Menninger.

13 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, that rule applies to any
14 documents that we're offering in our case in chief, not as

15 impeachment. In the government's presentation of evidence with
16 this witness, they talked about a particular home and the

17 characteristics of that home. I am impeaching the witness with
18 an exhibit that presents a contrary home. The rule does not

19 apply to impeachment material, it applies to things we intend
20 to offer in our case in chief as per the rule.
21 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, then this is extrinsic
22 evidence that is inadmissible under the rules of evidence to
23 impeach.
24 THE COURT: So it's one page of J36; correct?
25 MS. MENNINGER: Correct, your Honor. I offered page
