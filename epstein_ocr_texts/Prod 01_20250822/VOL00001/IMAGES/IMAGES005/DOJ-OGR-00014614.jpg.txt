LCKVMAX8 Charge

1 that is, spoken or unspoken -- came to a mutual understanding

2 to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan.

3 Express language or specific words are not required to

4 indicate assent or attachment to a conspiracy. If you find

5 beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an

6 understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to

7 accomplish an unlawful plan, then the government will have

8 sustained its burden of proof as to this element.

9 To show that a conspiracy existed, the government is
10 not required to show that two or more people sat around a table
11 and entered into a solemn pact orally or in writing stating
12 that they had formed a conspiracy to violate the law, spelling
13 out all of the details. Common sense tells you that when
14 people, in fact, agree to enter into a criminal conspiracy,

15 much is left to the unexpressed understanding. It is rare that
16 a conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an explicit
17 agreement. Conspirators do not usually reduce their agreements
18 to writing or acknowledge them before a notary public, nor do
19 they publicly broadcast their plans.
20 In determining whether an agreement existed, you may
21 consider direct as well as circumstantial evidence. The old
22 adage "actions speak louder than words" applies here. Often
23 the only evidence that is available with respect to the
24 existence of a conspiracy is that of disconnected acts and
25 conduct on the part of the alleged individual co-conspirators.
