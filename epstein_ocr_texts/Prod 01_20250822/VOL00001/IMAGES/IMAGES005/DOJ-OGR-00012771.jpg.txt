1 (In open court)

2 THE COURT: Anything else to take up?

3 MR. EVERDELL: Nothing from the defense, your Honor.
4 MS. MOE: Your Honor, one last issue with respect to
5 three exhibits. We had a chance to review the transcript from
6 last week from the cross examination of Jane, we noticed that
7 there were three defense exhibits that were offered which were
8 not offered under seal but which contained identifying

9 information for Jane, so we wanted to address that. We

10 conferred with defense about that.

11 Taking those exhibits in order, the first is

12 Defendant's Exhibit J15. So this exhibit contains some

13 redactions, but there is additional identifying information as
14 to Jane. I flagged that for defense counsel. What we would
15 propose is that we work together to mark a further redacted

16 version which would become J15R, and that J15 itself would

17 remain as it is and under seal as it is offered during her

18 testimony. So we'll work with the defense to propose

19 additional redactions, mark that, and make sure that that's in
20 the record, but I just wanted to flag that because, as it
21 stands, the underlying exhibit is not yet received under seal
22 and because that contains identifying information, we'd ask
23 that that exhibit be sealed at this juncture.
24 MS. MENNINGER: I don't believe that J15 does have
25 other additional identifying information, but I'm happy to
