COURT: Do you have Sheéts of the ones in
question?

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: I guess what I need to do is consider
Mr. PagliuGa'ts point that ‘they're out of order and the like.
L'll take the whole book back and we'll look at the law.

MS. MOE: Yées, your Honor. Very briefly on that very
last point, I would nete that for I think essentially every
exhibit -- I*1ll doublecheéck at the break, but I think for every

exhibit we've offered, there may not be a date ‘on every single

message, but there are four messages per page ahd there are
dates on -- at least. somewhere on the page.

THE COURT: Okay:

MS. MOE: Thank you, ‘your Honor.

THE COURT: Thank you. See you in a few.

(Recess)

THE COURT: Anything further to 6ffer on this?

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank, you.

We wanted to point out with respect to Government
Exhibit 606, which is the household, manual, turning to page 7,
there are instructions to employées about taking phone
messages. Those instructions are: “Complete a phone message
slip with the following informaticon: Name, spelt. correctly;
date and time of call; telephone number, including the area
code."
