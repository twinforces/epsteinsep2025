LC6Cmax5 McHugh â€”- cross

1 THE COURT: Sustained.

2 Q. Well, let's talk about that transaction that we were just

3 looking at, because I think you've reviewed those statements

4 and you did talk about those in your direct testimony.

a) Now, let's go to Government Exhibit 506, which I think
6 is in evidence. We saw that page in 506; right? You testified
7 about that in your direct?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. I think you said that was a signature card; right?

10 A. It is a signature card.

11 Q. Yes. And that is a signature card for the account ending
12 in 4324; correct?

13 A. Yes.

14 Q. And that's the account that's associated with Air Ghislaine
15 Inc.; right?

16 A. I didn't memorize the numbers.

17 Q. Understood. That's fine. Let's look at the third page of
18 this document, which we didn't see before. Let's go back to

19 the page before, the second page so we can see the complete
20 document.
21 Are we at 506? Is this Government Exhibit 506? Okay.
22 I'm sorry, let's go to page 5. My fault. Go to page 5.
23 MS. MOE: This is a three-page document, your Honor.
24 MR. EVERDELL: Must have the wrong one. May I have a
25 moment, your Honor?
