1 The response is, "No, thank you." Asterisk, "Jurors

2 have made plans for tomorrow."

3 So, we will get them what they've asked for as quickly
4 as possible. And then, everyone, please be ready to go at

a 4:25. We'll bring them out for dismissal.

6 I had one quick additional point I wanted to make

7 about the request yesterday for the question regarding Annie's
8 testimony and the request from the defense was to also put in

9 the Limiting instruction. I wanted to note that the limiting
10 instruction went in on the transcript of Annie's testimony, as
11 well. So they did have that.

12 All right. Anything to address, Ms. Comey?

13 MS. COMEY: No, your Honor.

14 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim?

15 MS. STERNHEIM: No, thank you.

16 THE COURT: We'll see everyone at 4:25 unless we hear
17 anything further. As soon as you have the materials, give them
18 to Ms. Williams, please. Thank you.

19 (Recess)
20 THE COURT: Any matters to take up before we bring
al them to dismiss them?
22 MS. COMEY: No, your Honor.
23 MS. STERNHEIM: No, thank you.
24 THE COURT: Okay. Bring in the jury, please.
