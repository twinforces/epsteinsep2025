7 BY MS. POMERANTZ:

8 Q. Based on your observations that weekend, what was your

9 understanding at the time of the relationship between Epstein
10 and Maxwell?
11 A. I believed that they were romantic partners. They were
12 very intimate with each other in terms of touching each other
13 and the way that they spoke with each other and interacted; it
14 was what I had seen from couples.
15 Q. What happened after you got to the ranch?
16 A. When I first arrived, I remember we did a little bit of a
17 tour, where I saw this portion I mentioned where there was this
18 western movie set and, I believe, some horses. And, you know,
19 I was, I guess, oriented a little bit to the property.
20 Q. Where did you stay at the ranch?
21 A. Ina small residence.
22 Q. Who else stayed in that residence?
23 A. Epstein and Maxwell.
24 Q. Was anyone else staying in that area of the ranch?
25 A. No.
