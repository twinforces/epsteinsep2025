1 I do intend to go through with this witness whether

2 they followed up on certain things that they heard in the

3 interviews, like, for example -- I'll give an example.

4 We heard from Jane testimony -- she confirmed on the

5 stand that she told the government that she was involved in

6 sexualized massages with multiple people, and she named the

7 first names of several of those people. I believe we know from
8 what she was saying to the government who those people are,

9 it's the subject of some of these submissions we made to the

10 Court about other witnesses that we want to call.

11 My understanding is from looking at the records that
12 were provided to us, they didn't follow up and talk to some of
13 these witnesses, right. So, for example, one of the names

14 mentioned was Michelle. We think we know who that Michelle is.
15 That Michelle was evident to the government because there was a
16 Michelle -- at least one Michelle. One Michelle was

17 communicated to the government by another witness that worked
18 in the office. They never spoke to that Michelle. Same thing
19 with some of the other people that were mentioned; never spoke
20 to them.
21 And I think that under your Honor's ruling, even
22 though that, I guess, is an investigative step, and I'm looking
23 at your Honor's ruling now, you were talking about the Watson
24 case, and you said that some arguments about the thoroughness
25 of the investigation are probative of guilt in some
