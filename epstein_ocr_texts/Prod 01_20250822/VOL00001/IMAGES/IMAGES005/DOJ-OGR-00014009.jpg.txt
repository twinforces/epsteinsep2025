Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 761 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 150 of 246 2445
LCGCmax4 Loftus â€” direct

1 surrounded by the speculative mental impressions of the

2 witness, which are not admissible evidence. And the statement
3 on its own says almost nothing is an out of context statement

4 from which, on its face, doesn't say anything about Kate's

a motives or financial interests in anything.

6 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, can the government really, with
7 a straight face, say that a victim would say, "It fell into my
8 lap." I think it goes to the weight that the jury wants to

9 give to it and I think that it is appropriate affirmative

10 testimony to be put on in a defense case. They can make

11 whatever arguments they want, they can cross examine

12 Mr. Hamilton, but to exclude it on that basis I think is just
13 wrong.

14 THE COURT: I mean, I think we've settled on the

15 analytical framework, which is we agree, following Harvey, if
16 it is extrinsic evidence, to show bias in favor of or against a
17 party, it's permissible; right?

18 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, we agree.

19 THE COURT: So it's really a 401 question. Is there
20 an available inference to the jury, if they believe
21 Mr. Hamilton, that the witness said that Kate said, "It fell
22 into my lap," if that goes to bias. I think there is an
23 available inference to the jury. I won't let Mr. Hamilton go
24 beyond and speculate as to meaning.
25 MS. STERNHEIM: Understood.
