The only question in any Specific instance 15, is Tt impeaching,
and. is it a prior incensistent statement. We have to deal with
the rules, around a prior inconsistent statement. It wasn't

like you had deposition testimony. You had an FBI agent's
write-up of notes, which the witness was confronted with and

said it was a mistake. Again, that wasn't moved in, -but we can
deal with ‘that as, it comes.

There could be -- not here, but there could be 608
issues if ‘you're trying to Use extrinsic evidence. If what we
have is impeaching by contradiction, impeachment of what the
withess testified to 6n the stahd, then it's not going to be a
608 issue.

MR. EVERDELL: Tf we're impeaching the witness, yes,
that's right. And I just want to address the issue of
impeaching with extrinsic evidence, which I know the govérnmént

THE GOURT: I knoéw yo6u cited Rule 613. I hadn't.
understood their argument ‘to be about 613.
MR. EVERDELL: They raised in their papers the nétion

that. you can't ,impeach -- or you can't use extrinsic evidence

to impeach. But the rule there afd the cases they'vé cited

stand for the unremarkable proposition, that you can't.

impeach == or you can't use extrinsic evidence on a collateral
THE COURT: Correct.
