LCGCmax4 Loftus â€” direct

1 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, we believe that's collateral,
2 and extrinsic evidence isn't appropriate on a collateral

3 matter.

4 THE COURT: And also, the quote was read in court,

5 wasn't it?

6 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

7 THE COURT: I'll sustain the objection to that one.

8 MR. PAGLIUCA: The next is 1567, lines 7 through 19.

9 THE COURT: Okay. Just give me one moment.

10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Sure.

11 THE COURT: Okay.

12 MR. PAGLIUCA: And the prior inconsistent statement is
13 at 3505, 005, page 1, second paragraph. Virginia explained

14 Carolyn could make $300 by providing a man in Palm Beach with a
15 massage.

16 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, our view is that the relevant
17 portion was read into the record and then, at lines 23 of 1567
18 through 2 of 1568, she was asked specifically whether she made
19 that statement to the FBI and she responded, yes, she told me
20 that. So I don't see how extrinsic evidence would be
al appropriate.
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: I think it's inconsistent, your Honor.
23 There is a denial and then there is a yes, she told me that,
24 and I think with that inconsistency, we should be allowed to
25 impeach it.
