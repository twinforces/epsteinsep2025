LC2VMAX2 Rocchio â€” Direct

1 Q. And can you briefly describe the work you do in connection
2 with your private practice.

3 A. So I provide treatment to patients, the vast majority of

4 whom have experienced some form of traumatic stress. A large

5 number have experienced sexual abuse during childhood.

6 I also work with a number of individuals who have been
7 in abusive relationships in adulthood or who've experienced

8 rape and sexual assaults either in childhood or adulthood. And
9 I work with other types of traumatic stress as well; traumatic
10 grief, for example, parents who've lost a child, or people

11 who've been involved in motor vehicle accidents. I've done

12 work with first responders.

13 So primarily traumatic stress, but also individuals

14 coping with problems in living, someone's going through a

15 divorce, someone is going through a life transition, anxiety,
16 depression, that sort of thing.

17 Q. Do you have a forensic practice?

18 A. I do.

19 Q. In your forensic practice, what sort of work do you do?
20 A. So I work in both civil cases and criminal cases. And I
21 provide expert witness testimony around issues in my area of
22 expertise, as I'm doing today. Sometimes I also conduct
23 psychological evaluations to answer a particular question
24 that's relevant to the legal issue at hand.
