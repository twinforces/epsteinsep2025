LC8Cmax3 Hesse â€” direct

1 So I think, with respect to the objection, we start

2 with the record was made at or near the time that the call came
3 in. So I think she's testified what she was instructed to do.
4 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

a THE COURT: Which included indicating a date and time

8 that prong of the business records exception.

9 On that score, I would note, your Honor, this is now
10 the second employee to testify that the instructions at the

11 household were to take contemporaneous messages as they came

12 in, in a message pad exactly like this. So there is now a

13 foundation in the record to show that this was the practice of
14 the household, these were the instructions the employees were
15 given.

16 Again, it's a spiral bound book, so we have a series

18 memorializing messages made. And the testimony has now been

19 twice that that was the practice of the household and
20 particular restrictions given by the defendant.

22 if you look at these messages, it belies the statement just
23 made, because Ms. Hesse's messages, for example, are pretty
24 well maintained, but when you go through these messages, there
25 are many multiples that are unsigned, undated, and don't fall
