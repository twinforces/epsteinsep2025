LC1VMAX3 Jane -— cross

1 (In open court)

2 THE COURT: Five minutes.

3 (Recess)

4 THE COURT: Matters to take up?

5) MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor.

6 MS. MENNINGER: No. Thank you, your Honor.

7 THE COURT: We can bring the witness.

8 And Ms. Williams can bring in the jury.

9 Mr. Everdell, did you get the binders squared away for
10 the jurors?

11 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I did look, and the one

12 juror referenced the letter of recommendation. And those, I

13 think, would have been with the Interlochen applications. And
14 I looked at all of those in both binders, and they look to be
15 complete. I just think that he or she may have missed the

16 page.

17 THE COURT: Okay. All right.

18 So maybe we'll take -- really make sure we're taking
19 time to direct them -—-
20 (Jury present)
21 THE COURT: All right. We will resume, Ms. Menninger,
22 with your cross-examination of witness Jane.
23 And Jane, I remind you, you are under oath.
24 Go ahead, Ms. Menninger.
25 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor.
