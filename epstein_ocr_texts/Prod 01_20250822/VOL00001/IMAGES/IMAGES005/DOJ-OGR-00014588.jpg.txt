LCKVMAX8 Charge

1 lawyers, follow your recollection.

2 You should draw no inference or conclusion for or

3 against any party by reason of lawyers making objections or my
4 rulings on such objections. Counsel have not only the right,

5 but the duty to make legal objections that they think are

6 appropriate. You should not be swayed against the government

8 chosen to make an objection. Similarly, statements made by

9 counsel when arguing the admissibility of evidence are not to
10 be considered as evidence.

11 If I comment on the evidence during my instructions,
12 do not accept my statements in place of your recollection.

13 Again, it is your recollection that governs. Do not concern

14 yourself with what was said at sidebar conferences or during my
15 discussions with counsel. Those discussions related to rulings
16 of law, which are my duty, and not to matters of fact, which

17 are your duty to determine.

18 At times I may have admonished a witness or directed a
19 witness to be responsive to questions or to keep his or her
20 voice up or to repeat an answer. My instructions were intended
21 only to clarify the presentation of evidence. You should draw
22 no inference or conclusion of any kind, favorable or
23 unfavorable, with respect to any witness or party in the case
24 by reason of any comment, question, or instruction of mine.
25 Nor should you infer that I have any views as to the
