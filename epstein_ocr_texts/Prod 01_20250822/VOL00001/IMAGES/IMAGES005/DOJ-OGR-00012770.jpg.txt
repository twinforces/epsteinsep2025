one that? the government chose 'to flag at this. time.

MR, ROHRBACH:; Your Honor, all of those -- those may
or may not be lines of Cross dépending on exactly How ‘the
question is phrased, but the government is not ‘objecting to
thém in advance now. The government's objection is to the
specific identification of the particular counsel, which we
don't ‘think is 'rélevant.

And I'd note that I think. this counsel's. name was used
ih, Cross 6Xamination of other witnesses already, 86 the
government is trying to, im part, prevent a suggestion that
this lawyer is involved in some kind 6f broader conspiracy for
which there is no evidence. Sq that's a level of prejudice.

THE GOURT: You Gah ask if she's represented, you can

ask what her counsel's name is, I, don't see a melevance, you

can ask if your attorney is in thé courtr6éom, a spectaclé of
pointang him out.

MS. STERNHEIM: I don't need to do that, Judge. I'm
not trying to make a spectacle of this. I'm just. trying to
have the record covered.

THE CQURT: I'll allow that. Counsel, any reason, for
sealing this?

MS. STERNHEIM: I don't think so.

MR. ROHRBACH: I don't think that's necessary; We
didn'*t use any names.

THE COURT: Okay. Not sealed.
