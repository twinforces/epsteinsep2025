LCKVMAX8 Charge

1 On these legal matters, you must take the law as I

2 give it to you. Regardless of any opinion that you may have as
3 to what the law may be or ought to be, it would violate your

4 sworn duty to base a verdict upon any view of the law than that
5 which I give you. If an attorney or anyone else at trial has

6 stated a legal principle different from any that I state to you
7 my instructions, it's my instructions that you must follow.

8 You should not single out any instruction alone

9 stating the law, but you should consider my instructions as a
10 whole when you retire to deliberate in the jury room. You may
11 take a copy of these instructions with you into the jury room.
12 Instruction No. 2. Role of the jury.

13 Your role is to pass upon and decide the fact issues
14 that are in the case. You, the members of the jury, are the

15 sole and exclusive judges of the facts. You pass upon the

16 weight of the evidence or lack of evidence, you determine the
17 credibility of the witnesses, you resolve such conflicts as

18 there may be in the testimony, and you draw whatever reasonable
19 inferences you decide to draw solely based on the evidence and
20 from the facts as you've determined them. You must determine
21 the facts based solely on the evidence received in this trial.
22 In determining the facts, you must rely upon your own
23 recollections of the evidence. What the lawyers have said, for
24 instance, in opening statements, in closing arguments, in
25 objections, or in questions is not evidence. You should bear
