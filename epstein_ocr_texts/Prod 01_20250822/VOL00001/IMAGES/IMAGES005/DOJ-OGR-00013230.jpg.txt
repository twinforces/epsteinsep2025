Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 753 Filed 08/10/22 Page 217 of 264 1658
LC 7VMAX7 Carolyn - cross

1 that they saw her naked. There was no other color on it.

2 There was no suggestion that they were engaged in sex acts or

3 that they were naked. I have the same objection.

4 THE COURT: I'm going to overrule on that one, 20.

5 There's the inference available of inconsistency, so I'll allow

6 20.

7 Next.

8 MR. PAGLIUCA: 21 is a description --

9 THE COURT: Just to spell that out, on the theory that
10 other males present in the room during conduct described could
11 be deemed lewd and lascivious conduct.

12 MS. COMEY: I just want to be clear, your Honor, that
13 the description was that they saw her naked in the massage
14 room, not that they saw her during any of the conduct. I think
15 there was testimony that she would be naked for a period before
16 Jeffrey Epstein would come in; and so it would just be them
17 seeing her nude in the room is what the testimony was, not lewd
18 and lascivious conduct.
19 THE COURT: Well, I'm going to overrule on 20.
20 Go ahead.
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: 21 is simply asking a description of
22 the lewd and lascivious exhibition, the date, and whether you
23 received money or other consideration. Answer, none.
24 THE COURT: Okay. Exhibition we did not get testimony
25 on, so I'll sustain. There's no inconsistency on 21. No
