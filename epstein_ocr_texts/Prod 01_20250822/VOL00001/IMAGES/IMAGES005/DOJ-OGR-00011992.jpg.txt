1 Q. Did there come a time when you stopped being in touch with
2 Jeffrey Epstein?

3 A. Yes.

4 Q. Approximately when was that?

5) A. The end of 2002.

6 Q. And why did you stop seeing him at the end of 2002?

7 A. Because I fell madly in love with someone, and we got very
8 quickly engaged. And Jeffrey would call me. And my new fianc√©
9 would ask, Who is this person who calls you and that you sort
10 of have to drop everything for to take that call?

11 And I said, Oh, it's -- that's my godfather.

12 And he just kind of said, Well, what do you mean your
13 godfather? You just tell him you'll call him back.

14 I said, No, it doesn't work that way.

15 And he had a pretty abrasive personality himself, this
16 guy. And he said, Well, don't call him back.

17 And that was sort of -- well, that wasn't the end of
18 it. I didn't call him back. And then he tried contacting me
19 again and leaving me voicemails that became increasingly
20 agitated in saying that I need to call him back, he was coming
21 into town to visit, and he wanted to see me, and that I need to
22 be grateful and remember what he's done for me. Because my
23 mother had still been living in an apartment in New York after
24 I moved away that he was paying for. And then I didn't return
25 his call.
