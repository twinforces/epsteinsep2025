1 Q. Do you recall being asked questions about your daughters on
2 cross-examination, Mr. Visoski?

3 A. Yes, I do.

4 Q. When your daughters were 14 years old, did you let them

5 give Mr. Epstein a massage?

6 A. No, I didn't.

7 Q. Do you recall being asked about Jane and another person who
8 has the same first name as Jane?

9 A. Yes.

10 Q. Who did you meet first, Jane or the person who is

11 identified in Defense Exhibits LV3A and LV3B?

12 A. The only way to kind of refresh my memory, Ms. Comey, to

13 narrow down that, I could only -- like when I -- when I

14 explained that I first met Jane, it was in between the two

15 pilot seats. So I know that was one of Mr. Epstein's smaller
16 aircraft; it wasn't the Boeing.

17 So visually, I can picture the second Jane. You have
18 to help me out which one it was. Not the one -- not the first
19 Jane, but the other Jane I could visualize in the Boeing which
20 would have been sometime 2000 and later.
21 Q. So to the best of your recollection, did you meet the
22 person we're calling Jane in the 1990s?
23 A. I would go with that one, yes, only because with that
24 document of the airplane with, you know, that time frame, I
25 remember the other Jane was in the Boeing, the bigger plane.
