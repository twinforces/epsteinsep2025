photograph with, your iPhone, your phone might save it as IMG
and. then give it a number. That's the kind. of
machiné-generated data that would pertdin 'to a photo on your
iPhone. In this case, this is information. that was affixed. by
a human being.

MS, COMEY: Your Honor, I think I can save us time. I

think I told Ms. Menninger thé other day we're not planning to
offer 332B, at. least with respect to that issue, we don't need
to resolve that.

THE COURT: So let"™s. take them one at a time. 304,
which is the one that's been 6ffered. What's the objéectidn?

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, with mespect ‘to this.
photograph, there is no withess that will testify when this was
taken, if it was prior to ‘the time of the conspiracy, some
other timé, under what circumstanéés, and that it hasn't been
altered in some way since then. So it js simply a document
without a witness to say what. it is.

MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. I believe the

testimony heré is that CDS were séizéed from Jeffrey Epstein's

residence, that they were meviewed by the FBL. So with respect

t6 authentication, in terms of offering that these aré what we

say they ane, they are photographs seized from Jeffrey

Epstein's residence on CDs.

Their relevance is selfapparent, given the contents of

the photographs. The relationship between. Maxwell and Epstein
