1 conspiracy to commit a crime in Counts One and Three?

2 The answer is yes, they can.

3 Do you have a proposal for how to say that other than
4 just yes? I'm happy to hear it.

5 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, my proposal is to give them
6 the limiting instructions that we got before.

7 THE COURT: The limiting instruction is nonresponsive
8 to their question.

9 MR. EVERDELL: One moment, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: They are not asking what it may not be

11 used for. They have a specific question, I think, probably in
12 light of the limiting instruction as to whether they may

13 consider it for this. And the substantive answer to that is

14 yes.

15 MR. EVERDELL: One moment, your Honor.

16 (Counsel conferred)

17 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think, as you're saying,
18 to say yes, while technically accurate, allows the jury to then
19 use her testimony more broadly if they aren't given the
20 instruction of how they can use the testimony. So if the
2l simple answer is yes, then the concern is that they would use
22 it and apply the testimony more broadly. And so I think what
23 was given before with the limits in the limiting instruction is
24 how they can use it appropriately in testimony and should be
25 given again.
