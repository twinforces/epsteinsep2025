1 A. Yes, I am.

2 Q. Are you familiar with the school's practices regarding

3 students' permanent files?

4 A. Yes, I am.

S Q. What are student permanent files?

6 A. So, students when they apply, we begin a file for them.

7 When they apply to the school the admissions department will

8 keep their application, and then if they apply for financial

9 aid, that will go into that file.

10 From there, their transcripts, their grades will go

11 into the file, and eventually their application to college and
12 any recommendations from the school.

13 Q. And those records you just mentioned, are they put into the
14 file at the time they're created?

15 A. Yes, they are.

16 Q. Does the Professional Children's School regularly maintain
17 those student files?

18 A. Yes, we do.

19 Q. How are those records maintained?
20 A. They are maintained electronically now so that they're in
21 an archive of which I oversee, and they are filed according to
22 the student's name and the year of graduation or the year that
23 they retired or left the school.
24 Q. How did the maintenance of those records work in the 1990s?
25 A. So they were kept in a hard file until about ten years ago,
