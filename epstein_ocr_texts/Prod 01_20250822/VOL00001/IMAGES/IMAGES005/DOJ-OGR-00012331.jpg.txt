1 predictor.

2 Q. Can you tell retrospectively whether someone who was abused
3 was also groomed?

4 A. Sure. Yeah. On the individual level, for example, when

5 I'm providing treatment and I'm talking with someone who's been
6 abused, we'll be talking about how that abuse came to be. And
7 often they'll be talking about the development of the

8 relationship and how they felt about this person and how it

9 unfolded over time.

10 And then we've also done scientific research that's

11 been done to also identify retrospectively the grooming

12 process.

13 Q. Can you explain what you mean by the scientific research.
14 A. Sure. So there's a lot of research that's been done, for
15 example, with victims, talking with them about what their

16 experiences have been in terms of the childhood sexual abuse

17 that they've experienced. And that's with both people who are
18 talking about the abuse as children or people who are talking
19 about it when they are adults. So there's what -- that would
20 be called kind of the victim literature.
21 But then there are also a number of professionals who
22 do research and work with the offenders. And they do research
23 talking with offenders about what sorts of behaviors they
24 engage in in order to lure and recruit and entrap children in
25 these sexually abusive circumstances.
