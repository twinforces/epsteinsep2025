was also groomed?

A. Sure, Yeah. ‘On the individual level, for example, when
Tim, providing treatment and I'm talking with Someone who's been

abused, we'll be talking about how that abuse came to be. And

often they'll be talking about the development of ‘the
relationship and how they felt about this person and how it
unfoldéd over time.

And then we've also done scientific research that's
been dohe to also identify retrospectively the grooming
Process.

QO. Can you explain what you mean by the scientific research.

example, with victims, talking with them about what their

experiences have been in terms of ‘the childhood, sexual abuse

that they've é6éxpéerienced. And that's with both people who. are

talking about the abuse as children or people who are ‘talking

about. it when they aré adults. S6 there's what == that wdéuld

But then there are also a number of professionals who

do. research and, work with the offenders. And they do research
talking with offenders abdut what. sorts of beHavidrs they
engage in in order to lure and recruit and entrap children. in
these sexually abusive circumstances.
