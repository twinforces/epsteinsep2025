2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, the objection is that this
3 is far afield from her expert testimony. We're picking one

4 study out of hundreds and then going into it.

8 objection saying, you know, we're not going to go into all of

9 the studies that she may or may not have relied on in support
10 of her testimony.

11 This is similar to that. Dr. Loftus is testifying

12 about a broad range of studies; and to single one out is, you
13 know, overly prejudicial, not very helpful to the jury, doesn't

15 THE COURT: I'm sorry, can you remind me of the

16 parallel objection.

18 to the prosecution by Dr. Rocchio on hindsight bias and --

19 basically hindsight bias and what went into hindsight bias.
20 THE COURT: You were trying to introduce affirmative
21 evidence through that study and not using it to impeach her

24 her and using some of the words from that study to impeach her
25 on what her opinions were during trial. That was the purpose
