LC 7VMAX7 Carolyn - cross

1 Honor, if that's easier.

2 THE COURT: Okay.

3 So what exact lines do you propose reading?

4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, I think we need to start at 14

S and continue through that page, the next page, the next page,

6 and the next page.

7 THE COURT: Ms. Comey.

8 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think the only potentially

9 admissible portion of this might be on pages 105 through 106.
10 THE COURT: Thank you. Let's go there.

11 That seems to get what you're getting at.

12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Sure. I was just trying to give the

13 context, your Honor. So that's fine. I'll go there.

14 BY MR. PAGLIUCA:

15 Q. Looking at line 7 on page 105, does it refresh your memory
16 that you answered the question: Yes, but I have done cocaine
17 at Mr. Epstein's house also?

18 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think we need the question
19 and then its answer, and then it needs to continue through to
20 page 106.
21 THE WITNESS: I need to know what line -â€”-
22 THE COURT: So at this point you may read on that page
23 those indicated lines. Go ahead.
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Fine, your Honor.
25 Starting at line 4, is that fine, Ms. Comey?
