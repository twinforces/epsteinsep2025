4 Q. In 2005, what was your title at the Palm Beach Police

5 Department?

6 A. I was the crime scene manager and a sworn police officer.

7 Q. Could you briefly explain what it is to be a crime scene

8 manager?

9 A. The job that I had, the responsibilities, was to oversee

10 the operation of the fingerprint bureau, with a fingerprint

11 expert. It was also to oversee the photography and video work
12 that was done, both in-car, in camera, and the still photos

13 that were taken on various crime scenes, not necessarily ones I
14 worked but ones that either patrol processed or people under me
15 processed. And also I was in charge of the evidence unit, the
16 evidence department. And we had regular inspections. We were
17 an accredited agency and under CALEA. And we did follow the

18 rules on that, and we were checked quite frequently on those

19 rules.
20 Q. Thank you, Mr. Parkinson.
21 I'd like to direct your attention to October 20, 2005.
22 What, if any, search did you participate in that day?
23 A. I participated in a search of a residence at 358 El Brillo
24 which is a street in the town of Palm Beach.
