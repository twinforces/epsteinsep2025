11 the charges. That's transcript at page 20. And I also said I
12 would permit the defense to cross-examine law enforcement

13 officers about the investigative steps that were taken if the
14 government puts the thoroughness of the investigation into

21 trying to be contrary. I just went back to the premise of your
22 ruling when I was looking at the transcript cites and the cases
23 that you cited as premise for your ruling. And because this
24 issue became a live issue when we had Jane's testimony, I
25 thought it appropriate to see if we could revisit this to see
