1 THE COURT: Preliminary matters to take up, counsel?

2 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor.

3 MS. MENNINGER: Not from the defense, your Honor.

4 THE COURT: Let me just confirm that we have to be

5 docketed or had been docketed all admitted exhibits with the

6 tailored redactions proposed.

7 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, the pursuant to the Court's
8 order that they've been made public through the United States

9 Attorney's Office's press office, so the exhibits for both

10 parties are publicly available.

11 THE COURT: There was one that the letter indicated

12 the defense would propose a more tailored redaction that was --
13 MR. EVERDELL: Is that AF-1, your Honor?

14 THE COURT: AF-1.

15 MR. EVERDELL: There is AF-1R, which is the publicly
16 available version that's going to be made public.

17 THE COURT: Great. And we've sorted the availability
18 for the public of the visual portion of the closing to be in

19 redacted form shortly after the completions of closing.
20 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. I'm not sure whether
21 we will be able to take out the slides that have the sensitive
22 materials within two hours. I hope to be able to just redact
23 the part that's -- but I'm not sure we'll have enough time to
24 check it. With the Court's permission, we'll tender the one
25 that has none of the sensitive slides and then replace them
