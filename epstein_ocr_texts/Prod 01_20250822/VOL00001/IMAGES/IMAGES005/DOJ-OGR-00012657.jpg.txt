5 QO. At 9:52, what room are we walking into?

6 A. This is on the north side, you're standing to the south,

10 Q. Mr. Parkinson, have you reviewed diagrams of this property?
11 A. I have.

13 to as the staff room?

16 A. You are looking from east -- from west to east, and this is
17 an elevator.
18 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I won't pause it, but at this
19 point I think it would be useful for the jurors to turn one tab
20 over to what's already in evidence as Government Exhibit 297.
21 THE COURT: Mr. Everdell, without objection?
22 MR. EVERDELL: No objection.
23 THE COURT: The jurors may look at GX297.
24 Q. Mr. Parkinson, what floor of the house are we on now?
