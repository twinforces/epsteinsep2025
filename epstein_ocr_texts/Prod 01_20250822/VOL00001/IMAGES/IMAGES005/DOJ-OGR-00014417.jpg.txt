LEKVMAX2 Summations - Ms. Moe

family was Struggling finan@ially. She didn't have her own bed
te sleep in. Things were really tough at home, She had big
dréams of working in the arts oné day. She was talented.

When Annie was 16, she lived with her mother who was.
supporting her daughters by herself 6h a limited incdémée. Annie
was heping to go to a good college.

When ‘Kate was 17, she lived with Her mother who had
been sick. Things were difficult at home and Kate was alone a.
lot. And she 'was, dazzled by this, impressive woman, who made her
feel special,

When Cardélyn was 14, she, lived with Her mom, a single
mom wheq was ‘an alcoholic. She had previously been, sexually
abused by family members and she told Maxwell about that.

Make no mistake. Selectang these girls was predatory
behavior. Maxwell and Epstein picked vulnerable girls. They
found kids who meeded something. They were exploiting that
need.

SQ what. was the next stage of the playbook? It was
isolating the girls. Maxwell ahd Epstein got them aldne in
Epstein's enormous houses, alone on trips to Epstein's
sprawling ranch, His mansioh 6n the Upper East Side. They got
them alone in massage mooms. They were away fr
parents.

Remember how Jane told you that her mother was never

invited. when she would spend time with Maxwell and Epstein?
