LCKCmax9 Charge

1 your verdict should be not guilty as to that charge.

2 You must base your verdict solely on the evidence or

3 lack of evidence and these instructions as to the law, and

4 you're obliged under your oath as jurors to follow the law as

5 I've instructed you, whether you agree or disagree with the

6 particular law in question.

7 Under your oath as jurors, you're not to be swayed by
8 sympathy. You should be guided solely by the evidence

9 presented during the trial and the law as I gave it to you

10 without regard to the consequences of your decision. You have
11 been chosen to try the issues of fact and reach a verdict on

12 the basis of the evidence or lack of evidence. If you let

13 sympathy interfere with your clear thinking, there is a risk

14 that you'll not arrive at a just verdict.

15 As you deliberate, please listen to the opinions of

16 your fellow jurors and ask for an opportunity to express your
17 own views. Every juror should be heard, no one juror should

18 hold center stage in the jury room, and no one juror should

19 control or monopolize the deliberations. If, after listening
20 to your fellow jurors, and if, after stating your own view, you
21 become convinced that your view is wrong, do not hesitate
22 because of stubbornness or pride to change your view. On the
23 other hand, do not surrender your honest convictions and
24 beliefs solely because of the opinions of your fellow jurors or
25 because you are outnumbered. Your final vote must reflect your
