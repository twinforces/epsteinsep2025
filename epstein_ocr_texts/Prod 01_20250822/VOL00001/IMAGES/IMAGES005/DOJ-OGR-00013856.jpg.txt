1 raise with the Court when we return from the break, I think,
2 any issues that we need to flag about those mechanics so that
3 it goes smoothly, if that's all right, your Honor.

4 THE COURT: Yes, of course.

5 And to the extent the AV folks can be helpful if

6 there's something you want to propose, I'm sure that they'll
7 make themselves available for that.

8 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: Anything else?
10 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor.
11 THE COURT: Anything else?
12 MR. EVERDELL: Nothing from the defense, your Honor.
13 THE COURT: Okay.
14 So I will see everyone Thursday at 8:45 a.m.
15 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.
