1 MR. PAGLIUCA: Okay. Ms. Pomerantz.

2 MS. POMBERANTZ: That question seems fine, your Honor.
3 I think the government agrees with your Honor that the
4 other questions were beyond the scope.

a MR. PAGLIUCA: May I? As long as we're on this topic,
6 your Honor, I would like to preview another area from this

7 article that I think is within this, but I want to make sure

8 that the Court agrees with me before I go down this road.

9 THE COURT: Go ahead.

10 MR. PAGLIUCA: The article that we're talking about

11 which is at 3502-018, the government's disclosure, the study

12 that was done in this particular article, and which I believe
13 this is the basis for her testimony about this grooming the

14 environment, and so the study that she is referring to

15 factually, there were 395 undergraduate students at John Jay

16 College here who were given the five vignettes, I will call

17 them, of this grooming behavior and asked in a sixth vignette
18 which was non-grooming behavior, and they were asked to predict
19 prospectively whether or not that was grooming behavior, and
20 they couldn't. And the conclusion of the study was the five
21 factors that she was talking about cannot be used to
22 prospectively predict grooming behavior. And I would like to
23 bring out those facts on cross-examination.
24 THE COURT: Sure. I mean, that's consistent with her
25 testimony.
