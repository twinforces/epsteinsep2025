1 THE COURT: And then there was one more heading, that
2 had that errant "Two" in it. Oh, page 52, instruction 37, that
3 heading also has the word "Two" in it for some reason.

4 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your.

5 THE COURT: Verdict sheet.

6 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, the edits here are just to
7 track changes we've adopted elsewhere. So as to Count One,

8 "conspiracy to entice an individual under the age of 17 to

) travel."

10 MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine, your Honor.

11 THE COURT: OK. "An individual." Right. All right.
12 So Count One, we'll adopt that and add "under the age of 17."
13 MR. ROHRBACH: This is actually in Count One also,

14 should be "individuals," plural, I think, in light of the

15 changes we've made?

16 THE COURT: Right. It's a conspiracy count.

17 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: OK, Mr. Everdell.

19 MR. EVERDELL: Count Two, the same thing.
20 THE COURT: Sorry. I just wanted your adoption,
21 "conspiracy to entice individuals under the age."
22 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: So we'll cut "an" and make it plural.
24 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: Go ahead.
