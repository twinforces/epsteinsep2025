1 Members of the jury, let me say my sincere thanks on

2 behalf of the court and the parties and myself for your

i) attention, for your time, and for your service. You all served

10 THE COURT: Please be seated.

11 The completed verdict form will be marked as Court

12 Exhibit No. 21.

13 Counsel, tell me if you'd like to set a briefing

19 write a letter to the Court proposing a schedule.
20 THE COURT: Okay. Would you like me to order the
21 preparation of the presentence report or to wait?
22 MS. STERNHEIM: We would request that you wait, Judge.
23 I also have a request -- I apologize -- given the
24 COVID issue, I would request that the Court endorse an order so
25 that Ms. Maxwell gets a booster. She has not received that as
