LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 government asking you four times, Are you sure there was no

2 sexual abuse in New Mexico? Could that possibly be pressure to
3 give more information that sometimes leads to corrupt memories?
4 And she explained to you that memory is a constructive

14 also talked about confidence malleability; that the more

15 confident a person gets if they receive confirming information

21 telling you that she's only a defense witness is simply not

23 told them the same information, it's just information they
24 didn't want to hear.
25 You remember the government asking questions of Dr.
