1 Mexico rather than the place where they did put the comma, then

2 that would have told us, can't she be responsible for aiding in

3 the transportation of the return flight, comma, but not the

4 flight to New Mexico, comma. That would then put the where/if

5 the intent was â€”-

6 THE COURT: That would be an entirely different

7 meaning to the question.

8 MS. MENNINGER: I think so.

9 THE COURT: No, I agree. What I don't know is I don't
10 know what they meant and I don't know how much weight to put on
11 that comma placement; because, as you've noted, that precise
12 sentence without that comma has an entirely different meaning.
13 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

14 And I think at the point at which we're parsing jury
15 notes like statutes this finely, I think it illustrates the
16 point that this note is confusing; that we're not sure what the
17 jury is asking about either factually or legally.
18 The question is about the second element; and so we
19 think the proper course is to refer the jury to those
20 particular instructions. And the jury is free to senda
2l clarifying note, if they wish to do so. But I think when we
22 are parsing commas this finely in a note that is unclear, it's
23 unclear which clauses are modifying which clauses, or which
24 flights we're even talking about, I think it's far too
25 confusing to give simple answers here.
