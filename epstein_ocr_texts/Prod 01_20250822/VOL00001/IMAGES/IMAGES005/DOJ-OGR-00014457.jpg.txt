LCKCmax3 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 abuse.

2 You also know that Maxwell enticed Jane to New York

3 because Jane told you about the pattern of her relationship

4 with Maxwell and Epstein. She told you that Epstein gave her

5 money and gifts and paid for school. That money wasn't free,

6 and part of the cause was getting Jane on the plane with them

7 to go to New York where she was sexually abused. That is

8 inducement, that is enticement, that is coercion.

9 The second element is that Jane traveled in interstate
10 commerce. We've already discussed how you know that Jane

11 traveled from New York from out of state. You know that from
12 Jane's testimony, from Juan Alessi's testimony, and from the

13 flight records.

14 The third element is that the defendant intended that
15 Jane would engage in sexual activity for which any person can
16 be charged with a criminal offense under New York law, and

17 you're going to learn that it's a crime to engage in sexual

18 contact with a kid under 17 who is too young to consent. And
19 the evidence shows you that Maxwell absolutely intended that
20 Jane would be abused in New York. That was the whole point of
al bringing her there, so that Epstein could have access to Jane.
22 They weren't traveling for mentorship or scholarships, they
23 weren't traveling with an underage girl because they were
24 friends, they were getting her to travel so that she could be
25 molested and that's exactly what happened. The evidence shows
