1 anticipate that our case will run into the Monday. The

2 government has already noticed a rebuttal case. That means

3 that the closings would not be until Tuesday, and the charge

4 may very well not be until Wednesday. Then we go into two days
5 off. To put the jury in a posture where they have basically

6 four hours to deliberate before the holiday season begins is

7 very dangerous and that's why I'm asking the Court to consider
8 that.

9 THE COURT: I do understand the concern. And we'll

10 see where we are.

11 My admonishment is to -â€”- what I don't want to hear is
12 if the evidence closes on Monday, that you don't want to do

13 your closings until the 27th. That's definitely not going to
14 happen.

15 MS. STERNHEIM: I am not saying that, Judge. I think
16 we all understand what the concerns are. And we will be very
17 judicious in our attempt to complete this timely. But that

18 being said, there is still logistical things that, in our

19 estimation, will push this beyond Tuesday, and then we have the
20 situation of the holiday. But we've raised it with the Court.
21 I think the parties are mindful and we're not doing anything to
22 delay. We just are concerned about this jury having ample
23 time, without any external pressures, to deliberate.
24 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
25 Just to provide the Court with some additional
