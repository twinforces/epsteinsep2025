1 could, the cover letter. Do we know why it's dated 2010?

2 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think that's a separate

3 record. Because I think that record reflects that there was an
4 opportunity to purchase the leasehold outright in 2010. It's a
a little bit of a complicated title. It's actually a leasehold.
6 She does own the lease; it's effectively owning it, b.ut this

7 land, I think, has been in the possession of the Duke of

8 Westminster since, you know, 1500. It's a very complicated

9 chain of title in the UK.

10 But the way it works is you pass the leasehold from

11 one person to another. And that is effectively ownership under
12 the land registry records. And that leasehold passed in -- the
13 contracts were exchanged in '96, and the deal closed in '97, in
14 January '97; and it was registered in a land registry as a

15 transfer of that title in March of '97.

17 prove when Ms. Maxwell purchased the home, but the defense's

18 proffer from counsel is that it is to prove that she did not

19 live there before 1996?
20 MR. EVERDELL: That's right. We have a witness, Kate,
21 who says -- she didn't live there before 1997, because that's
22 when she actually took possession of the property, right.
23 We have a witness, Kate, who has testified to events
24 that allegedly took place in the Kinnerton Street property in
25 "94 and '95. And these records show that she didn't own that
