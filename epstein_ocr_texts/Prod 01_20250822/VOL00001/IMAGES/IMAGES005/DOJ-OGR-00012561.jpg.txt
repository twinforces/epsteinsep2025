1 A. No.
2 Q. With you one didn't you own?
3 A. I owned the house that I built in Royal Palm Beach and I
4 sold the apartments at Tower 1515. And in all my life, I work
5 very hard and save a lot of money, including the time that I
6 work for Mr. Epstein. I did a lot of savings, sir.
7 Q. The point is, Mr. Alessi, and you agree with me that you
8 weren't poor when you went into Mr. Epstein's house in 2003 and
9 stole the money; correct?
10 A. Iwas not poor, but it was -- the money was sequestered
11 because I was going through a divorce and I had no access to
12 the money.
13 Q. Okay.
14 A. Or to sell the properties.
15 Q. Now, Mr. Alessi, I'm going to turn to some testimony that
16 you gave yesterday about Jane.
17 Do you recall that?
18 A. Yes, Sir.
19 Q. Isn't it true -- well, yesterday you testified that you met
20 Jane in 1994,
21 Do you recall that testimony?
22 A. I recall the testimony, but I'm not sure if it was '94,
23 'O5, '93, '96. IT cannot recall exactly the same date.
24 Q. Isn't it true that you met Jane in 1998 or 2000?
25 A. Can you repeat the question.
