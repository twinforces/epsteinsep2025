1 MR. EVERDELL: Slightly different. That would be "an
2 individual under the age of 18," because that's the substantive
3 count.

4 THE COURT: Yes. Line 3, replacing "minors" with

a "an --" wait. Let me just read that sentence again.

6 MR. ROHRBACH: I think these are all references to the
7 conspiracy.

8 MR. EVERDELL: That's right. I'm sorry, your Honor.

9 This is still talking about the conspiracy. So that one on

10 line 3 would still be "sex trafficking of individuals under the
11 age of 18."

12 THE COURT: Yes. I agree with that.

13 Okay. So for all of Instruction 34, all of the

14 instances -- well, in the second paragraph -- no, I'm sorry. I
15 won't repeat it. We got it. Page 45, line 3, "individuals

16 under the age of 18."

17 Okey dokey. Next.

18 MR. EVERDELL: So, your Honor, now we have page 49, or
19 instruction No. 36. It's -â€”-
20 THE COURT: I'm sorry. What page? 49?
21 MR. EVERDELL: Page 49, Instruction 36.
22 THE COURT: Okay. Actually, before you start, I'll
23 just note, there's an extra word, "Two," T-W-O, in the title.
24 So line 1, it's just Counts One, Three, and Five, deleting the
25 word "Two."
