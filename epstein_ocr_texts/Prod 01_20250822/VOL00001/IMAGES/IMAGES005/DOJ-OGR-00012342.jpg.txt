1 the course of a child's lifetime, that single factor can place
2 a child at higher risk. So these are vulnerabilities that have
3 been found to be specific to child sexual abuse risk.

4 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, Dr.

5 Rocchio, are you familiar with the term "attachment"?

6 A. I am.

7 Q. What is attachment?

8 A. Attachment really refers to the relationship and connection
9 between two people. The research was initially done looking at
10 the caregiver attachment, so typically the relationship that it
11 develops between a mother and an infant. But it's since

12 expanded to look at relationships between other caregivers and
13 children, as well as adults.

14 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between

15 attachment and grooming.

16 A. So in the context of building a relationship of trust and
17 using coercion and deception and lies in order to manipulate

18 the child, one of the things that offenders are doing is trying
19 to create increased dependency, trust, and attachment. They
20 hold themselves out as somebody who is special to the child,
21 and the child feels often very special, and that there's
22 something unique and important and valuable about their
23 relationship with the perpetrator.
24 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and
25 training, are you familiar with the term "coercive control"?
