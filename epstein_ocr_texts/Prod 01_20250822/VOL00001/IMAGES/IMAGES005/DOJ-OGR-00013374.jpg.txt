LC8VMAX4 Hesse â€” cross
1 So the left message is a message that you took, the
2 top left quarter?
3 A. That's correct. That's my signature.
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: And perhaps, your Honor, if the jurors
5 could be referred to their binders and follow along.
6 THE COURT: Jurors may turn to GX-1B, please.
7 Is that the small binder or large binder?
8 MS. MOE: The small binder, your Honor.
9 THE COURT: Small binder. Thank you.
10 Just caution about saying the last name.
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Understood, your Honor.
12 THE COURT: 1B. Thank you. GX-1B.
13 BY MR. PAGLIUCA:
14 Q. And so, Ms. Hesse, just looking at the left quarter there,
15 that's a message that you took; correct?
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. And the top line is the "for" Line on all of these
18 messages?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And on this page, for example, the top two are for
21 Mr. Epstein; the one in the left quarter lower is JE, and then
22 the right is Sarah. Do you see that?
23 A. Oh, the JE is down below. Correct.
24 Q. Yes. And I'm assuming you did not take the three yellow
25 messages that are referenced here; correct?
