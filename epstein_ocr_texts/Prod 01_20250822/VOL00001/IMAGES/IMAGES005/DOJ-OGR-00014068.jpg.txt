LCGCmax6 Aznaran — direct

1 THE COURT: Okay. We can bring in the witness.

2 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, may I raise one issue?

3 Your Honor gave us a 5 o'clock extension of filing of a brief
4 today. Can I ask for one hour so that we could -—- until 6:00
5 p.m. for that filing so we can confer with our office?

6 THE COURT: Okay.

7 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you.

8 THE COURT: I don't even know what it is. I'll still
9 be here at 6:00. That will be fine.

10 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, just one thing to alert the
11 Court. I believe the parties have reached, in principle,

12 agreement on a stipulation regarding Mr. Glassman. So that

13 will obviate the need to deal with the service issue for his
14 live testimony.

15 THE COURT: Sounds like a good idea.

16 MR. PAGLIUCA: It could have been fun, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: If only someone had thought of that

18 sooner.

19 The witness is coming back and we can bring in the
20 jury. Thank you for working out agreement on the timeframe
21 issue.
22 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.
23 (Witness present)
24 THE COURT: You may take a seat and you can remove
25 your mask. Just waiting for the jury.
