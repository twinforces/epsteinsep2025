Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 149 of 257 2983
LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 not mere presence around someone else who is violating the law;
2 it's an agreement to help that person. It's different from an
3 actual violation yourself of the law. And Counts Two, Four,

4 and Six are the ones that charge her with actually being the

5 one to violate the law. So it's a little confusing, but these
6 come in pairs, as you see from the color coding.

7 One and Two are the conspiracy and the substantive

8 count for enticement or persuading someone under the age of 17
9 to travel to engage in a legal sexual activity. Count One is
10 the conspiracy, Count Two is the substantive count.
11 The same is true for Counts Three and Four; they are
12 the substantive and the conspiracy counts for transportation.
13 And Five and Six are the same for sex trafficking.
14 It's very important that you understand that certain
15 counts relate to certain accusers. So, for example, Counts Two
16 and Four are entirely based on Jane. If you don't believe
17 Jane, you just acquit Ms. Maxwell right away of Counts Two and
18 Four.
