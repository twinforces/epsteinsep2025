Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document.763. Filed 08/10/22 Page. 50 of 197 2591

LEHVMAX 2:

MR. EVERDELL: She didn't. But She reviewed, I

believe, every file that was extracted from the devices; so she

knows’ generally how many theré were and what types there were.

MS. COMEY: Your Honer, we put on the witness who
extracted all of the files from all of these devices. That's,
Stephen Flatley. He was @n the stand. And. we put on a witness
who reviewed all the photographs. That? was Kimberly Medeéer.

She was on the stand,

What the defense wants to do now is ifpeach the
investigation, that is what this is about.

THE COURT: Okay:

vou had the opportunity te ask witnesses put. on by the
government. Consistent with my ruling, t6 the extent they put
the thoroughness of the investigation -- I wouldn't say it was
thoroughnéss, but they put the relevant agent who you could
have crossed on this on the stand. And, maybe ‘there would have
been dn objection, to the extent you were calling ints6 guéstidén
the thoroughness of the investigation without it being raised.

I might not have permitted it there, but I certainly won't

permit it further memoved as direct evidence of the
tHoroughnéss of the gévernment's investigation and
investigative steps, which, is precluded, by my November Ist
ruling:

MR. EVERDELL: Understood, your Honor.

THE COURT: Thank. you.
