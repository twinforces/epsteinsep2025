LE6Cmax.7 Méder - direct

topless photograph of this victim. We anticipate ‘that ‘the
testimony at this trial would be that that person recruited
another victim in ‘this case, and I believe we, in ddvance of
trial, that our view that the person in this photegraph isa
victim of the Charged conspiracy.

In particular, other exhibits which we will offer at
trial will show flight logs thdt will show ‘that this person,
the same person with her first and last name, traveled ‘on
flights with Maxwell and Epstein when she was, 17 yéars old. As

the Court will recall, Mr. Alessi testified that he recalled

withessing thé defendant meet. the same person and asked her to
come to the house and give massages.

So the fact that Mr. Epstein had a photograph of this
consistent with the svidence at trial that this person, das a
minor, waS a victim of the changed conspiracy.

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, the fact that this lawyér
LS just now representang to this Court that this 1s minor is
contrary, one, to the metadata on the photo that shows ‘shé wads
not a miner when this photograph was taken, and, two, the
testimony of Mr. Alessi that He mét her in 2001 or 2002, also
when she was not a minor. So to ‘put an evidence a photo that
they know iS not Her 6f a mindr, when there is ho charged crime
with respect to photography in this case, your Honor, is
directly contrary to the evidence as the government knows it
