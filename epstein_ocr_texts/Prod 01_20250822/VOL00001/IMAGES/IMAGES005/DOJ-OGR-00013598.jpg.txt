MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

THE COURT: On the disclosure front, I suppose if they

could have anticipated needing but for the arguments put
forward by thé défense, you tell me if I'm wrong, but I'd
certainly let -- on the disclosure ‘front, I'd let the

just a picture and date of birth, which is information, the
defense has had or for a very long tame néow. It's a person
that the defendant Herself knows.

So I idon't think there is any Surprise or mystery
