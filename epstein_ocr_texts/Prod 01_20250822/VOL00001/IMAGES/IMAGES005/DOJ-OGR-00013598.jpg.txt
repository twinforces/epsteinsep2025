1 2000s wasn't even in the United States in the 1990s. In fact,
2 her date of birth and age makes clear that she could not be an
3 adult in the 1990s on that flight --

4 THE COURT: It's a rebuttal witness.

5 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

6 THE COURT: On the disclosure front, I suppose if they
7 want to make you wait and do it in rebuttal -- why you want to
8 do that, I'm not sure, but on the disclosure front, it's

9 clearly a rebuttal witness. I don't think someone that they

10 could have anticipated needing but for the arguments put

11 forward by the defense, you tell me if I'm wrong, but I'd

12 certainly let -- on the disclosure front, I'd let the

13 government call the person as a rebuttal witness. Whether we
14 do that now or in rebuttal, I suppose, is -â€”- I'll hear from

15 both sides on that question.

16 And then relevance, I think you've indicated the

17 rebuttal relevance of the evidence you're seeking to get in?

18 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. On the disclosure front, I
19 want to make clear we produced this exhibit the same day we
20 received it. We were on equal footing with the defense here.
21 In terms of the content of the testimony in the exhibit, it's
22 just a picture and date of birth, which is information the
23 defense has had or for a very long time now. It's a person
24 that the defendant herself knows.
25 So I don't think there is any surprise or mystery
