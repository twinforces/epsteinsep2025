1 proper foundation for these.

2 We assumed that there would be a witness who would do
3 this, and that Jane was the potential witness. There may be

4 others, I don't know, but Jane didn't testify about these

a photographs, and so that's when we raised it, when it looked

6 like it was a live issue, and it was only ripe when that

7 happened.

8 THE COURT: I have to agree with that. You're seeking
9 to move them now, and they're raising it now. I don't disagree
10 with what Mr. Everdell said.

11 MS. MOE: Your Honor, we'd just like an opportunity to
12 brief the issue. I think had we know it was defense counsel's
13 position that in the absence of a victim identifying these

14 photographs —-

15 THE COURT: It doesn't have to be a victim. It could
16 be anyone identifying -- again, you're asking to corroborate

17 what the witness testified she saw with photographs taken -- is
18 it 30 years? Help me with the math.

19 MR. EVERDELL: So the search is 2019, and Jane, I
20 think, claims she was there 1994 or 1995. So that is already
21 almost 20 years --
22 THE COURT: Twenty years.
23 MR. EVERDELL: Sorry, 25.
24 THE COURT: Twenty-five years.
