We assumed. that there would be a witness. who would. do
this, dnd ‘that. Jané was the potential witness. There may be

like it was a live issue, and it was only ripe when that
happened.

THE COURT: I have to agree with that. You're seeking
to move them now, dnd ‘they're raising it now. I don't disagree

photographs —-

THE COURT: It doesn't have to bé a victim. It could
be anyone identifying -- again, you're asking to corroborate
