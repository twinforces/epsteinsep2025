LCKVMAX8 Charge

1 this approach of aiding and abetting only if, in addition to

2 knowing of the criminal activity, she actually took actions

3 intended to help it succeed. An aider and abettor must know

4 that the crime is being committed and act in a way that is

5 intended to bring about the success of a criminal venture.

6 To determine whether Ms. Maxwell aided or abetted the
7 commission of the crime with which she is charged, ask yourself
8 these questions:

9 One. Did the defendant participate in the crime

10 charged as something she wished to bring about?

11 Two. Did the defendant knowingly and willfully

12 associate herself with the criminal venture?

13 Three. Did the defendant seek by her actions to make
14 the criminal venture succeed?

15 If she did, then Ms. Maxwell is an aider and abettor
16 and, therefore, guilty of the offense. If, on the other hand,
17 your answer to any of these questions is no, then Ms. Maxwell
18 is not an aider and abettor, and you must find her not guilty
19 under that theory.

22 COUNES .
23 Counts One, Three, and Five of the indictment each
24 charge Ms. Maxwell with participating in a "conspiracy." The
