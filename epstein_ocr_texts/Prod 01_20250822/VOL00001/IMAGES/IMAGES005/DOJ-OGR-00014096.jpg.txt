LCGVMAX7 Hyppolite - direct

1 THE COURT: Everyone may be seated.

2 All right. Matters to take up.

3 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would just note that we

4 previously offered to stipulate to this witness's testimony.

5 We're happy to stipulate to the remainder of it if he can be

6 released. I don't know whether the defense would like that.

7 They did us that courtesy with another witness from Florida who
8 had to stay overnight, so I wanted to offer it.

9 THE COURT: Thank you.

10 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor.

11 T'll speak with the government afterwards about a

12 potential stipulation.

13 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

14 Other matters?

15 MS. COMEY: Nothing from the government, your Honor.
16 MS. MENNINGER: No, your Honor. Just that we have

17 conferrals on the inconsistent statements we are planning to do
18 after we finish.

19 THE COURT: What I'd like is for you to identify what
20 remains in dispute. What time can I hear from you on that?
21 MS. MENNINGER: 7:30?
22 MS. COMEY: That sounds reasonable to us, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: Okay. If there are issues that remain in
24 dispute, I guess I could ask for anything, just like a joint
25 chart that â€”-
