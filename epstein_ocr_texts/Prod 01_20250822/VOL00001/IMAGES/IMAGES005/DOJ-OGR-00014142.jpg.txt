1 the agent and just elicit from the agent that there were no

2 phone records because phone records get deleted after a certain

3 amount of time, but I believe they tried to get phone records,

4 but none existed because of the age of the allegations. I

5 mean, geo location, I think anybody who could testify to the

6 fact that there aren't geo location -- the information,

7 especially an FBI agent because cellphones didn't exist back

8 then, there weren't records available back then. And emails,

9 too, that there were no emails to get because of the age of the
10 case. That's all I'm trying to do with that point, your Honor,
11 is elicit the absence of evidence so that we can then argue it
12 in front of the jury.

13 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, they don't have to elicit
14 the absence of evidence in order to argue to the jury that the
15 evidence is absent. So to the extent they are trying to elicit
16 the absence of evidence through Special Agent Young is just the
17 argument they want to make in closing made through leading
18 questions on direct examination of a federal law enforcement
19 agent.
20 THE COURT: I'm just going to reread the relevant
21 portion of the transcript. I will take them as they come, but
22 my instinct is the government is correct, you're either
23 violating my rule or you're being argumentative in a way that
24 you can argue from an absence in closing.
25 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor —-—
