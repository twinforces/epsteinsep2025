1 THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Rohrbach.

2 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, I have interviewed

3 Ms. Gill. I think she would likely say that the Mar-a-Lago

9 wouldn't matter if the employee filled it out themselves.

10 Verification is important there because they are just
11 taking the information of the outsider at their word. Here,

12 Mr. Roberts was an employee of Mar-a-Lago; so he had a business

16 been a violation of his duty, a fireable offense, presumably,

18 dependents and obtained for them insurance coverage.

19 THE COURT: I'm not persuaded that that distinguishes
20 a binding precedent. It's a point of distinction, but it

24 there's no -- I'm not aware of any obligation of employees to
25 fill it out truthfully other than the fact that they could get
