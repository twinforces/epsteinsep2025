1 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.

2 THE COURT: Actually, counsel are aware of the

3 identity of the jurors; so I'm comfortable with counsel seeing
4 the note. And then I'll redact for purposes of public exhibit.
a MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, the primary reason is so that

6 we can, as the parties, look at it and analyze it and, when you
7 come down, be prepared to make the arguments. It has nothing

8 to do with using it for any other purpose.

9 THE COURT: No, I understand.

10 Okay. So do you need these now or do you want â€”-

11 MS. STERNHEIM: We'd like to have copies.

12 THE COURT: Of course.

13 MS. STERNHEIM: But it's not as immediate.

14 THE COURT: Okay. I will figure out who knows how to
15 do a redaction.

16 MS. MENNINGER: We're pretty good at it.

17 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, it is true that the parties

18 know the names of the jurors; so if the Court wanted to send an
19 electronic copy of the note to the parties, the parties could
20 redact it and then send a redacted version back to the Court.
21 THE COURT: All right. We'll do that. Thank you.
22 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.
23 (Recess pending verdict)
24 THE COURT: I have a note.
25 We would like to end today at 5 p.m., deliberate from
