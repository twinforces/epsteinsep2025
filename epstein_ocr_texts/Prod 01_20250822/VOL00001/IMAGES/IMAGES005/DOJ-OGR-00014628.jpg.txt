Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 228 of 257 3062
LCKCmax9 Charge

1 established by a showing that the defendant was careless,

2 negligent, or foolish. However, one may not willfully and

3 intentionally remain ignorant of a material fact and important
4 to her conduct in order to escape the consequences of criminal
5 law. The law calls this conscious avoidance or willful

6 blindness.

7 An argument by the government of conscious avoidance

8 is not a substitute for proof, it is simply another factor that
9 you, the jury, may consider in deciding what the defendant

10 knew. Thus, if you find beyond a reasonable doubt that the

11 defendant was aware that there was a high probability a crime
12 was being committed but that the defendant deliberately and

13 consciously avoided confirming this fact such as by

14 purposefully closing her eyes to it or intentionally failing to
15 investigate it, then you may treat this deliberate avoidance of
16 positive knowledge as the equivalent of knowledge, unless you
17 find that defendant actually believed that she was not engaged
18 in such unlawful behavior. In other words, a defendant cannot
19 avoid criminal responsibility for her own conduct by
20 deliberately closing her eyes or remaining purposefully
al ignorant of facts which would confirm to her that she was
22 engaged in unlawful conduct.
23 With respect to the conspiracy counts, you must also
24 keep in mind that there is an important difference between
25 knowingly and intentionally participating in a conspiracy, on
