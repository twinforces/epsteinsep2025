1 notes.

2 Third, as I previously explained, testimony that a

3 witness does not recall making a statement may be but is not

4 necessarily a basis for inconsistency.

5 Finally, I'll apply 403, consistent with my prior

6 rulings of prior inconsistent statement has already been read

7 in full into the record. I'll sustain the government's

8 objection to admitting the statement as extrinsic evidence.

9 See, for example, United States v. King, 560 F.2d 122
10 (2d Cir. 1977). Stating where evidence is admissible under
11 613, it could be excluded under 403.
12 With that, we can turn to the list of the prior
13 statements and I'll do my best to apply that guidance I've just
14 given in light of the arguments raised by the parties and my
15 review of the transcript.
16 So beginning with Jane, transcript at 447, I will
17 overrule. Jane denied the statement in the handwritten notes,
18 which is an inconsistency, even if the later 302 corroborates
19 Jane's testimony. I will overrule that government objection.
20 Transcript at 455, I'll sustain the government's
21 objection for two reasons. The full statement was read into
22 the record and Jane responded it was, quote, correct, I guess,
23 admitting the statement.
24 Transcript at 470 to 71, overruled. Here the defense
25 has adequately identified the statement at issue.
