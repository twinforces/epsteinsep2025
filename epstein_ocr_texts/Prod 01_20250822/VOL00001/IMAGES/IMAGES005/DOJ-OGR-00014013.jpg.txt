12 are studies showing that people remember their grades were
13 better than they really were, that they voted in elections they
14 didn't vote in, that they gave more to cater than they really
15 gave, that their kids walked and talked at an earlier age than
16 they really did. These are prestige enhancing memory
17 distortions that people routinely make when they're not
18 deliberately lying, but maybe it makes them feel a little
19 better about themselves.
