Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 755 Filed 08/10/22 Page 77 of 262 1782
LC8Cmax3 Hesse â€” direct

1 to the business records exception. They're free to argue about
2 the timeframes and what could be construed from them, but the

i) question is whether this is a business record, and based on the
4 testimony from now two witnesses and the organization of the

5 book itself, which shows that this is a sequentially numbered

6 book that's bound, that was used as part of this employee's job
7 functions. That's all that the business records exception

8 requires.

9 Again, on the timing, the issue is whether these

10 records were made at or near. I'm not aware of any authority
11 that requires a foundation that a witness testify that they

12 personally made that record at the exact moment a phone call

13 came in. That's not what the business records exception

14 requires. It's whether it's at or near, whether it's part of
15 the general practice. If the requirement were that witnesses
16 come in and talk about the exact moment they recorded something
17 every time, business records would never be admitted in court.
18 That's not what the rule requires.

19 THE COURT: I'm going to poke around at the law. If
20 anybody has a case, you may have noticed, I like cases.
21 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
22 THE COURT: I'll take a look during the remainder of
23 the break.
24 Can I keep these to look at them?
25 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor, of course.
