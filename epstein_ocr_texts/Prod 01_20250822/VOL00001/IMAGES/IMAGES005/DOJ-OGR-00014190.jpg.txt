2 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I'm transitioning entirely

3 away from where we were at the prior sidebar. I was about to

4 Switch to eliciting some prior consistent statements of Jane's.
5 I do believe the door has been opened for that, but I

6 understand defense counsel would object as beyond the scope.

7 But for efficiency purposes, I was going to ask her now while

8 she's on the stand about these prior consistent statements.

9 MS. MENNINGER: I mean, your Honor, opening the door
10 to prior consistent statements in this manner will then, on

11 recross, I think open the door to any number of other prior

12 inconsistent statements that your Honor just ruled out, and we
13 had to go through an entire process to get in the very few

14 prior inconsistent statements we did. The government hasn't

15 even told us now which prior consistent statement that they're
16 offering.

17 THE COURT: Rebuttal if it's beyond the scope. So

18 sustained with the opportunity to confer if they want to recall
19 the witness for rebuttal.
