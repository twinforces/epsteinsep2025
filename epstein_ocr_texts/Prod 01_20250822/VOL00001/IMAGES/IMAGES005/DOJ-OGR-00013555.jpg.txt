1 Honor. This is classically what someone would do in a closing
2 argument. You can put this in a Power Point and put up a

3 screen that shows this, and then put up a screen that shows

4 that, and then make an argument about it.

5 And if they wanted to elicit this testimony, it should
6 have been done, I believe, with a witness that then could be

7 cross-examined substantively about what was being discussed.

8 This witness, Mr. -- if I'm saying it correctly,

9 Mr. Buscemi, can't be cross-examined substantively about

10 anything; all he's going to be able to say would be, I looked
11 at this, and I looked at that, and I looked at this, I looked
12 at that, and those are the exhibits.

13 So I guess I'ma little confused about the process,

14 where one would just look at a jury and say, Look at this and
15 then look at that. And I don't understand why that isn't, sort
16 of, impermissibly highlighting certain pieces of evidence. And
17 then, you know, am I allowed to get up and say, Why don't you
18 look at this and why don't you look at that? It just seems

19 rather awkward to me to be doing it in that fashion.
20 MS. MOE: Your Honor, that's why we propose doing this
21 with a witness, to avoid any, sort of, awkwardness. But I
22 don't understand the objection to publishing items that are in
23 evidence that the jury has not yet seen. Again, our hope was
24 for this to be very streamlined; but I understand the Court's
25 concerns.
