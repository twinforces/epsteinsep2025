6 includes at least one last name of someone who testified using
7 only a first name. The first one is Shawn. The second one is
8 Cimberly Espinosa. The third, I can't read the last name. I'm

10 And the fifth is Jason Richards. So you'll start working on

11 those.

13 schedule going forward. Are we required to continue

14 deliberations every day, including 12/31, and 1/1, until we

15 reach a verdict? We ask in order to plan our schedules

16 accordingly."

17 And I have a juror who did raise one like couple-hour
