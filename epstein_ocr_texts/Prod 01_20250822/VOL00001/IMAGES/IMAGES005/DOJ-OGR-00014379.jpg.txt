SO that''S thé proposal. And whén, would you like 'to
put ina letter?

MR. ROHRBACH: Dépéends On, what time we finish.

MR, EVERDELL: First thing, your Honor.

MRz ROHRBACH: Tf we finish by noon, by 2 or 3?

THE COURT: OK, Let's do 2 o'clock.

MRs ROHRBACH: OK.

THE COURT: Thank. you.,

Next.

MR. EVERDELL: Next, ‘your Honor, is ‘page 68,
instruction no. 50, the uncalled witnesses tharge. The request
here is that this not. be included, and I think, the reason being

that, in this case, it isn't really accurately summarizing the

state of play, because, you know, for example, there were
witnesses who took their Fifth Amendment rights and refused té

testify as defense witnesses because they invoked ‘thein Fifth

Amendment. rightS. The government does have the option of
giving those witnesses immunity to testify. And so they
actually control, more than wé do, whether or not. a witness can
appear ——

THE COURT: To be Clear, that didn't happen. They
didn't. call that witness.

MR. EVERDELL: We had a witness who invoked their
Fifth Amendment rights or had written the Court that they
planned. to. invoke, and that we called and was under. subpoena
