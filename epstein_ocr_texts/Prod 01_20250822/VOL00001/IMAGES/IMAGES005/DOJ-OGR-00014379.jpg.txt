1 So that's the proposal. And when would you like to

7 MR. ROHRBACH: OK.

8 THE COURT: Thank you.

10 MR. EVERDELL: Next, your Honor, is page 68,

11 instruction no. 50, the uncalled witnesses charge. The request
12 here is that this not be included, and I think the reason being
13 that, in this case, it isn't really accurately summarizing the

17 Amendment rights. The government does have the option of

18 giving those witnesses immunity to testify. And so they

19 actually control, more than we do, whether or not a witness can
20 appear â€”-

24 Fifth Amendment rights or had written the Court that they
25 planned to invoke, and that we called and was under subpoena
