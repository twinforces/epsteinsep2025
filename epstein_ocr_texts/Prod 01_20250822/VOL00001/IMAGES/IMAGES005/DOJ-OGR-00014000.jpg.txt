LCGCmax4 Loftus â€” direct

1 AFTERNOON SESSION

2 2:05 p.m.

3 THE COURT: Okay, where are we?

4 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, the government and I spoke
S over the break. We appreciate how lengthy two of the witness's
6 prior inconsistent statement contentions are. We were unable,
7 in this amount of time, to try to reach agreement on all of

8 them. The witnesses that pertain to those two would be

9 testifying tomorrow. The one that pertains to Carolyn is here
10 from out of state and would be testifying this afternoon. So
11 our joint proposal, I think, would be to address right now the
12 Carolyn prior inconsistent statement so that witness could

13 testify or be released this afternoon and then, at the close of
14 court this afternoon, for us to sit down with the testimony and
15 try to reach agreement on the two related to Jane and Annie.

16 MS. COMEY: That's correct, your Honor. I believe

17 there are only three statements at this point in dispute

18 regarding Carolyn, so I think we can resolve that pretty

19 quickly. Mr. Pagliuca, I believe, has the list of the three
20 that I believe are in dispute.
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor. The two that are
22 agreed to are at transcript 3610, 9 through 15 -- I'm sorry.
23 Not 36. I have 35 numbers in my head. 1610, Lines 9 through
24 15; 1611, lines 1 through 5. Those correspond to the following
25 statements in the 302.
