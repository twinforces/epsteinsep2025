AETERNOON SESSION
2:05 p.m,
THE COURT: Okay, where are we?
MS, MENNINGER: Your Honor, the government and. I spoke

over the break. ‘We dppreciate how lengthy two of ‘the witness's

prior inecensistent statement contentions are. We were unable,
in, ‘this amount of time, to try to reach agreément on all of
them, The witnesses that pertain to those two would -be
testifying tomorrow. The one 'that pertains to Carolyn is Here
from out of state and would. be testifying this afternoon. SO
our jéint proposal, I think, would be to address right now the
Carolyn prior inconsistent statement, so that witness could
testify or be released this afternoon ahd then, at the eldse of
court ‘this afternoon, for us to sit down with ‘the ‘testimony and,
try t6 réach agreement on the two related to Jahe and Annie.

MS. COMEY: That's conrect, your Honor. I believe
there are only three statements at this pdéint. in dispute
regarding Carolyn, so I think we can resolve that pretty
quickly. Mr. Pagliuca, I believe, has the list of the three
that, I believe are in dispute.

MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes; your Hon6ér. The two that are
agreed to are at transcript 3610, 9 through 15 -- I'm sorry.
Not 36. I havé 35 humbers in my Head. 1610, lines 9 through
15; 1611, lines lL through 5. Those correspond to the following
statements in the 302.
