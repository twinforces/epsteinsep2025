LCGCmax2 Espinosa â€”- direct

1 flights that were going to take place on the private planes?

2 A. Sure. On occasion I would have to tell them what time

3 wheels up was. Jeffrey might call in and I'd pick up the phone
4 and he'd say, tell Larry wheels up at 8 o'clock to wherever he
a was going.

6 Q. And who was Larry?

7 A. Larry, one of Jeffrey's pilots.

8 Q. Did Ghislaine ever make a similar call when you were in the
9 office to let Larry know when wheels up was?

10 A. It was directed by Jeffrey Epstein, what time wheels were
11 up. And on occasion, I'm sure Ghislaine also told Larry what
12 time that would be.

13 Q. Who in the office would most typically interact with the

14 pilots about wheels up times and make arrangements for flights?
15 A. It could be any of the assistants, me, Jeffrey's assistant,
16 or Ghislaine herself.

17 Q. And when you arranged the flights or when you had

18 conversations with the pilots, what information did you give

19 the pilots, typically?
20 A. That was it. The time -- they always, you know, the planes
21 were at Teterboro airport, so there was never a question of
22 where they needed to be. It was just what time was wheels up
23 and where were they going.
24 Q. Did you typically have information about the names of the
25 passengers that would be on the flights?
