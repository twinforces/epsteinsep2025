1 you all confer. Go ahead, Ms. Sternheim.

2 MS. STERNHEIM: I'm going to wait until you finish and

4 THE COURT: What I'd like to do, when we meet, before
S the jury comes in tomorrow -- not tomorrow -- Monday, as much

6 as I'd like to do it tomorrow. We'll meet at 8:30 on Monday,

8 to exactly what's going back to the jury, and Ms. Williams will
9 give you our -- actually, we'll try to get that to you today or
10 tomorrow -- list of what we have as admitted exhibits, and you
11 can agree or tell us if we've got anything wrong. And I'll get
12 your agreement on that list of admitted exhibits as well.

13 Go ahead.

14 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you, Judge. My recommendation
15 for efficiency purposes would be for the parties to agree on

16 what portions of the transcript should be redacted in case the
17 jury wants it, so that we don't have to do readback and then

18 make copies of the transcript could go in.

19 MS. COMEY: Agreed, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: That is understood. Absolutely. So
21 you'll have that ready by Monday.
22 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes.
23 THE COURT: Great. Thank you.
24 Yes. And it is my practice to get that agreement and
25 then send the paper back.
