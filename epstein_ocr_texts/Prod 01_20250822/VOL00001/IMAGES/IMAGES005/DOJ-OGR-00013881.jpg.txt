1 make the full record of the reasons for permitting the witness
2 to testify through WebEx.

3 THE COURT: Okay.

4 You don't disagree with that, do you?

a MS. STERNHEIM: No. But I would just note that in the
6 case that I've cited, United States v. Al-Fawwaz, there was

7 less of a showing in that case as to the unavailability of the
8 witness who was available to come to the site where he was

9 deposed by myself and government counsel.

10 Here, we do have a definitive positive test for COVID,
11 and I think that speaks for itself. He certainly would not

12 even be able to get on a plane, let alone enter the United

13 States.

14 THE COURT: I think the unavailability on the

15 defense's proffer is established. So why don't you work out

16 the -- if a further record is required and logistics. I don't
17 think I let a witness testify remotely. I let a juror

18 deliberate remotely.

19 MR. ROHRBACH: I think the Court is right. I think
20 the Court considered and applied the Rule 15 factors, but did
21 not allow the witness to testify remotely is my recollection,
22 your Honor.
23 THE COURT: I'll look at it. But I anticipate this
24 witness will be permitted to testify by WebEx. So you'll work
25 out what we need to do to effectuate that.
