THE COURT: Good morhing. I received a letter

briefing over the weekend regarding the government's request

for a limiting inStruction with réspect to the next anticipated

witness. The witness will testify under the pseudonym Kate.

As thé government has indicated, because Kate was over

the age of consent in all relevant jurisdictions at the time

that! she alleges sexual conduct with Epstein took place, she's

not a victim of the crimes charged in the’ indictment. On this

basis the defense moved pretrial to exclude hér testimony as
irrelevant and prejudicial. I denied that request. I
céncludeéd baséd on thé government.'s proffer that she Has

relevant testimony that 1s direct evidence of the Mann, Act

counts and evidence that is otherwise admissible undér 4.04 (b).

ro ‘avoid jury confusion and ‘prejudice, however, I
concluded that. her testimdény should be limited in the
description of details of the sexual conduct, that. does not form.
a basis of thé chargéd counts and that a limiting instruction

was required.

Over the weékend, the government. asked f6r mé to
include in the limiting instruction a statement that I
instructed thé parties hot to ask about détails of the sexual
conduct that the witness will ‘testify occurred with
Mr. Epstein; In part, the government justifies this request
based on the defense's opening statement that, calls into
question the credibility of witnesses based. on. their inability
