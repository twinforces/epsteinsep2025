1 THE COURT: Good morning. I received a letter

2 briefing over the weekend regarding the government's request

3 for a limiting instruction with respect to the next anticipated
4 witness. The witness will testify under the pseudonym Kate.

5 As the government has indicated, because Kate was over
6 the age of consent in all relevant jurisdictions at the time

7 that she alleges sexual conduct with Epstein took place, she's
8 not a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment. On this
9 basis the defense moved pretrial to exclude her testimony as

10 irrelevant and prejudicial. I denied that request. I

11 concluded based on the government's proffer that she has

12 relevant testimony that is direct evidence of the Mann Act

13 counts and evidence that is otherwise admissible under 404(b).
14 To avoid jury confusion and prejudice, however, I

15 concluded that her testimony should be limited in the

16 description of details of the sexual conduct that does not form
17 a basis of the charged counts and that a Limiting instruction
18 was required.

19 Over the weekend, the government asked for me to
20 include in the limiting instruction a statement that I
21 instructed the parties not to ask about details of the sexual
22 conduct that the witness will testify occurred with
23 Mr. Epstein. In part, the government justifies this request
24 based on the defense's opening statement that calls into
25 question the credibility of witnesses based on their inability
