1 through this witness, there is the massage table itself and the
2 costumes. I think we agreed or the government represented that
3 they do not intend to introduce the massage table itself, just
4 photographs of the massage room where the table was present; is
5 that right?

6 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. We'll be

7 offering photographs of the massage room, we're not offering

8 the physical massage table itself.

9 THE COURT: But the photograph contains an image of

10 the massage table?

11 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. There are a number of

12 photographs of the massage room, those photos depict the

13 massage table. We're not offering the table itself in

14 evidence.

15 MR. EVERDELL: I'll get to the photographs ina

16 second, your Honor.

17 The last physical item is the costumes themselves, I
18 believe it's a box of five costumes, cosplay costumes that were
19 found in the residence. Obviously, your Honor, this search
20 took place in 2019, that's 15 years after the last year of the
21 conspiracy charged in this case. We don't have any testimony
22 up to this point about anybody involved in costume play,
23 cosplay, dressing up. There may be some later, I don't know,
24 your Honor, but the fact that these costumes are found 15 years
25 later in the residence does not seem to be relevant or
