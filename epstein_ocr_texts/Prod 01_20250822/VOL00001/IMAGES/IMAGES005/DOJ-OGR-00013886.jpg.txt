1 brothers. And she will only refer to the soap opera, not the

2 particular name of the soap opera.

3 THE COURT: All right. What else?

4 MR. EVERDELL: I don't think anything from the defense
a) at the moment, your Honor.

6 MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing from the government, your

7 Honor.

8 THE COURT: We have one more juror we're waiting on.

9 Oh, while we have a moment, so I did work out

10 logistics for the charging conference. We can do Saturday at 9
11 a.m. in this courtroom. And as I said, the DE and other

12 courthouse staff will ensure significant public access. We'll
13 have room in the courtroom and in overflow courtrooms for the
14 charging conference.

15 Anything else?

16 MR. EVERDELL: Sorry, I did forget one thing.

17 With respect to those photos, your Honor, if they do
18 get admitted, there's only one copy of each. So my plan on

19 publishing them to the jury would be to just walk down the jury
20 row with the photos so they can see them, because we don't have
al physical -- we just got them this morning; we don't have copies
22 of the photos.
23 THE COURT: You can't run off some copies?
24 MR. EVERDELL: We can try in the meantime.
25 THE COURT: Okay.
