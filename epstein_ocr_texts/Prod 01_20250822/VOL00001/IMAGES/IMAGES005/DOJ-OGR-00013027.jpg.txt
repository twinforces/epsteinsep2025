1 we're down to, your Honor.

2 THE COURT: Okay.

3 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, as I think our Letter

4 indicated, we're quite surprised to receive the defendant's --
5 THE COURT: Mr. Rohrbach, let's just get to the issue.
6 It sounds like it's narrowed to two things. Every letter I

7 get, it starts with, We're so surprised or this has already

8 been litigated. Let's just get to the issue.

9 MR. ROHRBACH: So, your Honor, I think we're ina

10 pretty good place then. Mr. Flatley is not going to go into

11 very much -- we obviously don't know exactly what Mr. Flatley
12 will say on the stand, but the questions and what we expect to
13 elicit should track the government's November 26 letter. And
14 so it sounds like if defense counsel doesn't have a problem

15 with what's in this letter, then there is no issue here for the
16 Court.

17 I'm not exactly sure what Ms. Menninger is referencing
18 with regard to CDs, but I think that we expect Mr. Flatley to
19 give purely fact testimony regarding CDs, and there's no expert
20 opinion at all involved there. To the extent that it's a late
21 disclosure of anything, it's just a factual view of Mr. Flatley
22 that is in the 3500 material that he may testify to.
23 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, on the CDs, apparently
24 Mr. Flatley intends to testify that a created date is the same
25 thing as a modified date. And also about once a file is burned
