LC2Qmax3 Rocchio - Cross

1 Q. And it was done by folks who are at John Jay College here
2 in New York. Do you recall that?

3 A. I don't recall where the authors reside, no.

4 Q. Do you recall that part of the study involved using what

5 they call six vignettes and providing those to 393

6 undergraduate students?

7 A. Ido.

8 Q. And the six vignettes were -- a vignette is like a story,
9 right?

10 A. Yes.

11 Q. And so what the authors were doing were taking these six
12 vignettes, five of them involving what you discussed, the five
13 stages of grooming, and then a sixth vignette which was a

14 non-grooming vignette. Do you recall that?

15 A. I don't recall the exact number of vignettes as I sit here
16 today, but I do recall that they were using vignettes in that
17 study, yes.

18 Q. And they would need a controlled vignette for the purpose
19 of this study which was the sixth vignette. Do you recall
20 that?
21 A. Not specifically as we speak here, but I'm happy to review
22 it if you'd like.
23 Q. Sure. I think you have a binder there that has this at a
24 tab.
25 THE COURT: Dr. Rocchio, could you come little closer
