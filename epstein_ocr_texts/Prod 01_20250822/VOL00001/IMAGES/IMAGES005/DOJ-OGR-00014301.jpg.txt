1 THE COURT: Start with Ms. Williams. I guess it

2 depends what it is. We'll have some staff here tomorrow for

3 the charging conference, but Ms. Williams will be reachable no
4 matter what over the weekend and she can direct traffic.

S MS. MOE: Thank you very much, your Honor. Just

6 wanted to work that out in advance.

7 THE COURT: Thank you.

8 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, at this time, we would

9 reiterate and renew our motion pursuant to Rule 29.

10 THE COURT: With that reservation, we can proceed to
11 the charging conference.

12 Anything else to take up?

13 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank
14 you.

15 MR. EVERDELL: Not from the defense, your Honor.

16 THE COURT: I thank everyone. I'll see everyone at
17 9:00. You'll get the charge as soon as I can, but by 6:00.
