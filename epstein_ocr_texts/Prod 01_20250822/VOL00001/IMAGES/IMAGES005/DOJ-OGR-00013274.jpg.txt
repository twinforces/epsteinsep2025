1 I'm just completing out the record here, which is the question
2 does not call for a privilege communication. It's a yes-or-no
3 answer. Yes, I was shown materials. I don't believe that

4 that's privileged because there is no communication required,

5 number 1.

6 Number 2, in the event those materials are shown to

7 the government in a meeting, they lose any putative privilege

8 that they may have.

9 Number 3, to the extent that they're intended to be

10 communicated to a third party, they are not privileged to begin
11 with, even if they're not shown to the third party. I believe
12 that's the status of the law and that's my record. Thank you.
13 THE COURT: Again, you might have been able to get

14 there, but the question that you asked, I sustained on

15 privilege.

16 Next, anything?

17 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank
18 you.

19 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: Was there another issue you wanted to make
21 a record on, Mr. Pagliuca?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't think --
23 THE COURT: If it occurs to you, you can make it in
24 the morning.
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Thank you, your Honor.
