13 Q. Have you had a chance to look at the fourth paragraph?

14 A. I'm reading it right now, sir.

15 Q. Okay.

16 A. Okay.

17 Q. Does reading that paragraph refresh your recollection that
18 you told the FBI that you sat in the kitchen and the chef asked
19 if you were hungry?

25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Correct.
