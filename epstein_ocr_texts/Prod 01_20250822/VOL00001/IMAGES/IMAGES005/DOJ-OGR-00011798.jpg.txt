1 A. Little St. James.

2 Q. About how often did you visit Little St. James during your
3 employment for Mr. Epstein?

4 A. Every time we went to the St. Thomas U.S. Virgin Islands,

5 where the island was located.

6 Q. About how often did you fly Mr. Epstein to the U.S. Virgin
7 Islands?

8 A. Had been every week, every ten days, if we weren't

9 elsewhere in the world, but it was a regular destination.

10 Q. And why did you go to the island each time Mr. Epstein went
11 to the Virgin Islands?

12 A. I also flew the helicopter. So when Mr. Epstein would

13 arrive at St. Thomas main airport, I would go get the

14 helicopter and then pick him up and the passengers and fly them
15 to Little St. James Island, as well as, you know, taking

16 luggage and also picking up luggage at the island. And also a
17 very large home theater was installed at that residence as

18 well.

19 Q. Did you install large home theaters in all of Mr. Epstein's
20 residences?
21 A. Yes, I did.
22 Q. Other than helicopter, how else could you get to Little St.
23 James?
24 A. The other option would be boat.
25 MS. COMEY: Ms. Drescher, can we please pull up
