1 testimony of witnesses who were previously convicted of crimes
2 punishable by more than one year in jail. This prior

3 conviction was put into evidence for you to consider in

4 evaluating the witness's credibility. You may consider the

5 fact that the witness who testified was a convicted felon in

6 deciding how much of his testimony to accept and what weight if
7 any it should be given." Looks like I gave that in my -- in

8 the United States v. Berry.

9 MR. EVERDELL: I think we've been using that as a

10 model in this charge, your Honor, so we would request a similar
11 instruction here.

12 THE COURT: 1 would add it, as I did in that last

13 case, as a standalone instruction.

14 Mr. Rohrbach.

15 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, this is the first we've

16 hoard of this proposal. So if we could have a few hours after
17 the charge conference to give it some thought. We can file a
18 letter saying either, we agree, or, if we have objections to

19 it, articulating those.
20 THE COURT: I think that's fair, and I will look too
21 since it's a new suggestion. I think my proposal would be to
22 just do it as a standalone instruction at, maybe what would be
23 45-A?
24 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: Between 45 and '6.
