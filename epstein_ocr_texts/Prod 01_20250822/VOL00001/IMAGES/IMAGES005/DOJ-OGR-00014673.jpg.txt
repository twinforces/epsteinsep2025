1 MS. COMEY: That's not correct, your Honor.

2 The answer should be yes, full stop.

3 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, may I just be heard?

6 It's like saying you could drive, but you have to

11 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, if someone asked me if I

12 drive, the direct answer would be yes or no.

13 MS. STERNHEIM: But if you're in an area that has a

14 limit -- which we know is in the record, because the Court gave
15 an instruction -- that would be part of it as well.

17 this question is that they are following the Limiting

18 instruction and they want to know what it's relevant for.

24 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, the jury asked a very simple
25 yes-or-no question. They need a very simple answer. The
