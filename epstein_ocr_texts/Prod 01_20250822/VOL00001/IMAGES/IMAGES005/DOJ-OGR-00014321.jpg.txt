1 MR. EVERDELL: So why don't we say "under the age of

2 18," if we could, your Honor.

3 THE COURT: Is that okay, Mr. Rohrbach?

4 MR. ROHRBACH: Since it relates to multiple

5 individuals here, it would have to be "individuals under the

6 age of 18," but the government would be fine with that change

7 to avoid ambiguity.

8 THE COURT: Okay. So page 15, line 23, it will read

9 "to engage in sex trafficking of individuals under the age of
10 18." Just one moment.

11 Okay.

12 MR. EVERDELL: And your Honor, next page, it's a

13 similar request. On line 1, we would say, "Count Six of the

14 indictment charges the defendant with sex trafficking of

15 individuals under the age of 18."

16 THE COURT: Okay.

17 MR. ROHRBACH: Well, your Honor, for this one, since
18 it just relates to Carolyn, it could just be an individual, but
19 otherwise that's fine.
20 MR. EVERDELL: An individual under the age of 18.
21 THE COURT: That's right. All right. So we'll change
22 page 16, line 1 to read, "Count Six of the indictment charges
23 the defendant with sex trafficking of an individual under the
24 age of 18."
25 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.
