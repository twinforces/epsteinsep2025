LCGCmax4 Loftus â€” direct

1 something that could vaguely look like it might be eyeglasses

2 or whatever, very ambiguous. If it got labeled as eyeglasses,
3 people remembered it as more like eyeglasses. If it got

4 labeled as dumbbells, people later remembered it as looking

5 more like dumbbells. That's just an example of how you can

6 label something ambiguous and it will affect people's memory

7 for what they saw.

8 Q. So if two people, let's say, are having a conversation

9 concerning an event, and one of the individuals characterizes
10 it in some colorful fashion that the other one may not have

11 considered, would that be a situation where the memory might

12 become labeled?

13 A. Yes, absolutely. In one of our older studies, we found

14 that labeling something as an incident, which is really fairly
15 neutral, has a different affect than when you label the thing
16 that happened as a fight. People are more likely to construct
17 an image of a fight, probably because of that label.

18 Q. Are you familiar with the term memory traces?

19 A. Memory traces?
20 Q. Yes. Or memory fragments?
21 A. Well, I suppose that every now and then somebody might talk
22 about memory fragments. Just, you would have a bit or a piece
23 of information in your memory.
24 Q. And are you familiar with situations where someone might
25 take that bit of a memory and enhance it in some way?
