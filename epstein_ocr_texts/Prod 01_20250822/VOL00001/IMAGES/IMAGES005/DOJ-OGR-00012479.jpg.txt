LC2VMAX6 Alessi â€” Direct

1 be heard on this issue. I apologize.

2 MS. MOE: I'm sorry, your Honor.

i) Just to frame the issue, I recognize we've been

4 clarifying the record about time periods. Our view on

5 authentication for this exhibit is this witness is not

6 authenticating it as a document from a particular time period.
7 I recognize we've been asking questions about that.

8 The question before the Court is whether this witness
9 can authenticate this exhibit as a document belonging to

10 Maxwell and Epstein or a document that he recognizes based on
11 his observations of the book. So we just wanted to frame the
12 question in terms of our perspective.

13 THE COURT: That's fine. I didn't ask the question if
14 it was a later book. Ms. Comey did. There was an objection.
15 We thought we were on foundation. That's where we are.

16 I'm now ruling, sustaining that objection, telling the
17 jury to disregard that testimony. Then it's the defense's turn
18 to voir dire, you'll seek admission, I'll rule. I may admit

19 it, I may not admit it, I may reserve until we hear the
20 testimony of employee one.
21 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.
