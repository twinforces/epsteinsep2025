2 THE COURT: We discussed this yesterday, didn't we?

3 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, the witness is going to talk

4 about home life. It's not the subject matter of his testimony,
5 it's whether she revealed to him at a time earlier than meeting
6 with the government allegations concerning Ms. Maxwell.

7 THE COURT: Well, but Ms. Menninger crossed on the

8 veracity of her poverty and financial situation growing up and
9 the relationship with her mother, and I assume that's where

10 we're going.

11 MS. STERNHEIM: I think the government -- I don't

12 think that's the issue here. The issue is whether she stated
13 at sometime earlier that she was abused.

14 THE COURT: Well, that's true. But you've put in

15 issue her credibility about everything. Why did you cross her
16 on whether she grew up poor?

17 MS. STERNHEIM: Because they raised it. They raised
18 the fact that she lived in a pool house. The witness testified
19 under oath that she lost her home after her father died. I
20 don't think that's the issue --
21 THE COURT: So you've attacked her credibility on
22 that. You said her credibility on everything is an issue. You
23 specifically attacked her credibility on that. Why can't it
24 come in as a prior consistent -- you're saying this witness can
25 only testify about --
