1 THE COURT: On scheduling, needless to say, I didn't

2 send you a draft of the charge last night. I think my thinking
3 is if the government rests today or tomorrow, which sounds like
4 what we anticipate, I'll use the remainder of tomorrow, one, to
a) hear the defense motions; and two, for me to work on the charge
6 on my own, having already received your drafts.

7 And then I'll send it to you at some point in advance
8 of a charging conference, which we'll do next week. And again,
9 I'm open to you telling me whether you want to do it in the

10 evenings after testimony or on Saturday. I think really the

11 analysis there depends on what the defense now anticipates as
12 the length of its case.

13 So are you in a position to give any additional

14 estimate as to that?

15 MR. PAGLIUCA: We don't, your Honor.

16 I think we're hoping to take this evening and tomorrow
17 to put those pieces together, and then provide the Court and

18 the government with that analysis.

19 THE COURT: Okay. Ms. Sternheim.
20 MS. STERNHEIM: May I just say, I think it is our
21 thinking at the moment that if we are going to be using the
22 trial days, that our preference would be to Saturday for a
23 charge conference. It seems that it would just be a more
24 focused time.
25 THE COURT: I think really the only reason not to do
