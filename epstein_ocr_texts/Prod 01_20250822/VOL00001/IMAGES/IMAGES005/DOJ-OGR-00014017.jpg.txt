Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 761 Filed 08/10/22 Page 158 of 246 2453
LCGVMAX5 Loftus â€” direct

1 information if it comes from somebody they trust or if it comes
2 from somebody who seems knowledgeable rather than somebody who
3 seems like they're trying to bias you for nefarious reasons.

4 So the source of the post-event information does matter.

5 There's even one study with children that shows that

6 young children are more likely to accept suggestions from

7 adults than from other children.

8 Q. And in looking at memory, is there any way for you to tell,
9 based upon your training, experience, and research, whether a
10 memory is real or the product of post-event information?

11 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection.

12 THE COURT: Sustained.

13 Q. Just going back for a moment, you spoke about post-event

14 information and post-event suggestion. What is post-event

15 contamination?

16 A. Post-event contamination would be a situation where there
17 was suggestive information that maybe led to a contamination.
18 You could have post-event suggestion and have people resist the
19 suggestion. But I think if I were going to use the term
20 "post-event contamination," it would mean that somebody was
21 exposed to the suggestive information and it actually
22 contaminated them.
23 MS. STERNHEIM: May I have a moment, Judge?
24 THE COURT: You may.
