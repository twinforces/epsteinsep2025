information if it comes from Somebody ‘they trust or if it. comes
from somebody who seems knowledgeable rather than somebody whe
seems, like they're trying to bias, ‘you for nefariots reasons.

SQ the source of the post-event information does matter.

There's even one study with children that shows that

young children. are more likely to accept suggestions from
adults ‘than from othér children.
on And. in. logking at memory, is there any way for you to tell,
based upon, yolir trdining, experience, dnd research, whether a
memory is real or the product of post-event informat.Lon ?

MS. POMERANTZ: Objeétion.

THE COURT: Sustained.
QO. Just going baék for a Moment, you spoke dbout post=event,
information and post-event suggestion. What, is post-event
contamination?
A. Post-event. contamination would be a situation where there

was suggéstivé information that maybe led to a Coritamination.

You could have post-event suggestion and have people resist the
suggestion. But I think if I were going to use the term
“post-event contamination," it would mean that somebody was
exposed to thé Suggestive. infd6érmation and it actually
contaminated them.

MS. STERNHEIM: May I have a moment, Judge?

THE COURT: You may.
