aren't. making this wp is that multiple other witnesses backed
up: what they told you. Think. about all of the other witnesses
‘in, this case. vUuan Aléssi, David Mulligan, Janice Swain, and
the witnesses called Matt and Shawn, Think about all the ways
their testimony’ was backed up by doGuments, all of the other
evidence in the case.

Your Gommon Sénseé télls you the witnesses are not
lying and they just cannot be all misremembering the same
thing. That! just leaves one conclusion: That Maxwell is.
guilty and you shoquld convict her.

Let mé take a step back and say this: Ladies and

gentlemen, look at the evidence together, all. of the evidence,
and usé your comm6n sense. THe evidence points t6 only one
conclusion: Phat Ghislaine Maxwell sexually exploited young
girls. She trafficked underage girls for sex. When you
consider all of the evidence and use your common sense, you
will reach thé Only vérdiét consistent with the eviderice:
Maxwell is guidty.

THE COURT: All right. Thank you, Ms, M6ée.

Members of the juny, we ane going to take that break,
f6r lunch. Tt. will bé a@ short break, 20 to 30 minutes.
Ms. Williams is having jit. set up now. My law clerks ane going
té assist. you getting back.

I just want to pause one moment. I repeat this, even.
though we're at the later stages of the case. No discussions
