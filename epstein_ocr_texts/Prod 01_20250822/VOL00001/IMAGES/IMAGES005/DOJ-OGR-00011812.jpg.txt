1 describe what the inside of this plane looked like.

2 A. Sure. The best way to describe it, it was kind of like a

3 recreational vehicle inside; it wasn't like a typical airliner
4 would look.

5 You went in the front entrance door which is located

6 at the forward part of the aircraft. You walked upstairs. And
7 if you continued straight ahead, it went into the first

8 bathroom, which we considered the crew bathroom; so there was a
9 lavatory up in front. And then if you made a left turn,

10 brought you into the cockpit.

11 Now we're still at the entrance and now we're going to
12 walk to the back of the airplane. You went through -- as soon
13 as you got to the first compartment, there was like a large

14 living room that had one, two, three -- it had three couches or
15 divans. And then it had several captain chairs inside there.
16 Once you went from that first compartment, you're

17 continuing walking to the back of the aircraft, in the middle
18 there was a galley or kitchen like you would find in a home.

19 It was a full decked-out kitchen.
20 And then once you went further past the kitchen, there
2l was what we call the round room. There was a couch or a divan
22 in the middle of the aircraft that was actually round or
23 circular. And once you went past that, there was what we
24 called the red room, which had Mr. Epstein's office that also
25 had a red couch or divan and his office desk.
