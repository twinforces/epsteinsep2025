LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 calling on behalf of Epstein, right? And he claimed to

2 remember some of what he thought was a French accent.

i) And in that meeting, he identified Sarah and then

4 another European with an accent that wasn't British that you

5 couldn't identify; correct?

6 Correct.

7 He met with the government five times. And ina fifth
8 meeting, he said he couldn't identify the accent. The truth of
9 the matter is Shawn never talked to Ghislaine Maxwell and never
10 heard her voice.

11 I want to turn to the other witnesses that came and

12 testified here.

13 The government talked to you about Dr. Rocchio, the

14 ultimate victim apologist who tried to explain away why these
15 accusers continued to have contact, including traveling with

16 Epstein or offering to send photos to him in jail 30 years

17 later. And to Dr. Rocchio, that's just proof that they are

18 victims. She's not trained as a treating therapist to question
19 accusers' accounts. She's not a lawyer or a judge or a juror.
20 She's a treating therapist.
21 The government has spent a lot of time and money on
22 Dr. Rocchio talking to you about grooming. There was no
23 evidence that Ghislaine Maxwell groomed anyone. Carolyn was
24 recruited by someone else. Annie met Ghislaine Maxwell one
25 time in her life. Kate was a sophisticated adult above the age
