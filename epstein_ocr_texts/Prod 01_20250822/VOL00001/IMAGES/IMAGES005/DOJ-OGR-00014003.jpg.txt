LCGCmax4 Loftus â€” direct

1 THE COURT: Yes, she told me that, and that's what you
2 told the FBI, yes, I told you that. Sustained.

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: The next one that's on the chart, your
4 Honor, is not at issue.

S THE COURT: Okay.

6 MR. PAGLIUCA: So I think that resolves it with the

7 Court's rulings. We're down to the two that have been agreed

8 to.

9 THE COURT: Okay. So that gets us what we need for

10 now and you'll keep working with respect to the other two

11 witnesses; correct?

12 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

13 THE COURT: Great. What else?

14 MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't know if the Court -- well, the
15 Court does not need to address this, but I conferred briefly

16 with the government about the government's proposed rebuttal

17 expert. I'm prepared to file something related to that, but

18 they may not be calling the rebuttal expert, so we'll deal with
19 that later.
20 THE COURT: Let's do what we need to do in the
21 immediate and then it sounds like we could do that by written
22 submission if we need to.
23 So the Hamilton issue, I'm trying to get my head
24 around. So let me just ask, make sure I understand. I'm
25 looking at the affidavit of Mr. Hamilton. This is you,
