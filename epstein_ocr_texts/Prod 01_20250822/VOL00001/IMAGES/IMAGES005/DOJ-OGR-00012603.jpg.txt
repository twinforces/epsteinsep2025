LC3Cmax3 Alessi - cross
1 massage; correct?
2 A. Can you repeat the question, sir.
3 Q. Yes. You would call The Breakers or Mar-a-Lago or Boca
4 Raton resort and find someone to give Jeffrey Epstein a
S massage?
6 A. Never.
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: If we can go to page 47 of the
8 transcript, deposition page 187.
9 May I inquire, your Honor?
10 THE COURT: I don't see it yet.
11 MS. COMEY: Can we get clarification on which lines,
12 please.
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Starting 187, line 21 for context, and
14 going into the next page.
15 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I don't believe this is
16 inconsistent.
17 THE COURT: Let me read it.
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Through page 188, line 15, your Honor.
19 THE COURT: I have to admit, the difficulty is I don't
20 understand the grammar of the question you asked.
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: My question to Mr. Alessi is that he
22 would get phone numbers and call people for Mr. Epstein and he
23 said no.
24 THE COURT: That was the question?
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes. Well, that is the question.
