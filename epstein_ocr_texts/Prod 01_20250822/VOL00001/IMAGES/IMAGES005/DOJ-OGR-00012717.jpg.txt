2 Q. So if you look at where it says "staff," that room we just
3 looked at, if you go to the right, all the way to the right,

4 the room on the far right-hand side is called the lake room;

5 right?

6 A. I'm sorry. I'm still back in the staff room.

7 MR. EVERDELL: If we can take down the call-out,

8 please, to see the full floor plan.

9 Q. Are we looking at the full floor plan, Mr. Parkinson?
10 A. True.
11 Q. You see the room that's labeled "staff"?
12 A. I do.
13 Q. That's on the left side of the floor plan towards the
14 bottom; right?
15 A. That would pretty much be the northeast corner.
16 Q. Northeast corner?
17 A. Yes.
18 Q. And if you go to the right-hand side of the floor plan, the
19 northwest corner, that's the lake room; right?
20 A. True.
21 Q. And that is the room where we saw Mr. Epstein's desk in the
22 photos that we just talked about; right?
23 A. Well, there were multiple desks. Do you mean the one that
24 the money was taken from?
25 Q. The one that the money was taken from, yes.
