1 three points. And I will refer the Court to the record. I'm

2 looking at pages 316, line 2, to page 317, line 1; pages 324

3 line 14, to 324, line 20; and pages 323, line 23, to page 324,
4 line 11.

5 In those transcript paragraphs, this is Jane's

6 testimony, she says that three things occur with respect to

7 Ms. Maxwell and her travel:

8 First, she says that she, Jane, traveled with

9 Mr. Hostein and Ms. Maxwell to various locations, including New
10 York.

11 Second, she says that Ms. Maxwell sometimes assisted
12 in making the travel arrangements. There's really like a one
13 line mention of that.

14 And third, she recounts an anecdote that on one

15 occasion when she was already in New York, she called

16 someone -- it's unclear who -- and she was said, quote/unquote,
17 freaking out because she couldn't get on her plane going back
18 to Palm Beach because she was only 15 at the time and didn't

19 have any identification. And she says that at some point
20 "Ghislaine made it happen for me," meaning that she helped her
21 get on that flight.
22 That's the only testimony we have and only evidence we
23 have in the record that talks about Ms. Maxwell's involvement
24 in enticement or encouraging travel to New York. So with
25 respect to each three, your Honor, they are insufficient.
