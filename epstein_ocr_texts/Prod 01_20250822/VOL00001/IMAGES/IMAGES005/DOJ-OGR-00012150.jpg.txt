1 a million dollars?

2 A. No, that is incorrect.

8 Q. Why?

4 A. First of all, I don't have that much money to give away,

2 and it was $25,000. So maybe it's a typo?

6 Q. I'm going to have you look at 3509-023.

7 A. Yeah, I see it.

8 Q. In the last full paragraph in the middle of the paragraph.
9 A. Yes.

10 Q. Does that refresh your recollection that you told the

11 government you did not know you would need a $250,000 retainer?
12 A. That's not correct because I never said that. I would not
13 be able to afford to pay anybody that much money for anything.
14 Q. Well, you paid her some amount of money?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. $25,000?

17 A. 825,000.

18 Q. And you did that to help her stop the media about you?

19 A. Stop people from harassing me and bullying me into trying
20 to give some sort of interview or statement.
21 Q. Well, you were being approached by lawyers?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Lawyers for Virginia Roberts, for example?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. You spoke to them?
