LEKVMAX4 Summation, - Ms. Moe

something that. you, forget ever. You rémémber an adult woman
groping your breasts. You remember a middle-aged man, touching

your vagind. ‘You remember ‘feeling scared and frozen and

trapped and confused. Your common. sense tells you these women

know what Happened to them in ‘their own lives. They know it.

These are powerful memories of trauma, and they've carried

these hatnting memories with them for ‘years.

But when the defense talks about memory, they want te

talk about experiments, experiments that Professor Loftus

performed in a lab, experiments like the one where she tried to
convince people that they saw Bugs Buriny at Dasneylandy
experiments where she told people that a stop sign, was a yield
sign. Don't be distracted by that.

Loftus has made a career of being a witness for the
defense. And she said in her book by that name, she doesn't
even pretend to be an impartial expert. She admits she is an.
advocate for the defense. And over the years, as shé has
admitted, she has been, paid, by criminal defendants to testify
on their behalf. She's made a hame for herself as a witness
for the defense in, high-profile trials. And most importantly,

this Gase isn't about. Bugs Bunny, it ish't abdut stop Signs;

it's about sexual abuse, repeated sexual abuse of ‘teenage
girls. Loftus told you, never done a study about that.

So all of that testimony she gave about implanted
memories or corrupted memories, it was totally irrelevant to
