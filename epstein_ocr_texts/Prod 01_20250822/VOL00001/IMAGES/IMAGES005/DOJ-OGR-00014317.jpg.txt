MR. EVERDELL: Right.

THE COURT: So just rather than give the jury two
elements with two different agés, which TI ‘think makes, sense.
But ‘so then the suggestion is "to transport an individual under
the age of 17."

MR, EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor,
THE COURT: Mr. Rohrbach?

MR, ROHRBACH: The government agrees. that that's. an
element of the offensé. Theré is, no réason to incorporate all
of the elements into the summary.

THE COURT: Well, he's not asking all. He's just
asking this one. So --

MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine; your Honoér, although the
government would note that that creates an, asymmetry between
Céunhts One and Three, so we think it Should be in both or
neither.

THE GOURT: All right.

MR. EVERDELL: Well, it's mot an element of the

offense in ‘Count One. I add it there because it says "an
individual" and “an individual" seems sort of vague. I mean,
there's testimony about l6ts 6f individuals traveling, and
transporting here and there. We just wanted to make it clear
to the jury that we're talking abd6ut individuals under the age

of 1? rather than all these people on the flight logs that we

saw who we have no evidence of their ages.
