LCGCmax4 Loftus â€” direct

1 Q. Outside of the laboratory, is there any way of proving that
2 someone has an actual memory?

3 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection.

4 THE COURT: Sustained.

5 Q. Does an experience that may contain some trauma make a

6 memory more reliable than one that does not?

7 A. Traumatic experiences compared to maybe more neutral ones

8 might be associated with certainly remembering, you know, the

9 core of what happened. You know that what you saw was a plane
10 crash and not a warehouse fire and maybe some core details, but
11 even traumatic experiences can be subjected to post-event

12 suggestion that can exaggerate or distort or change the memory.
13 Q. In the course of your research and experience, have you

14 done any experiments that have studied the confidence of

15 memory?

16 A. Yes.

17 Q. Can you please explain that to the jury.

18 A. Oftentimes, at retrieval, when somebody is answering a

19 question or reporting on what they remember from an event, they
20 might be asked to express the level of confidence, you know,
21 I'm pretty sure it happened, I'm very sure or what have you.
22 And one of the things we know is if the conditions are very
23 pristine, not a lot of -- not a lot of suggestion, not a long
24 period of time, they're a fair test, people are more accurate
25 when they're confident than when they're not confident. But
