LC7Cmax6 Carolyn - cross
1 (Jury not present)
2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, should I sit or stand?
3 THE COURT: I don't mind. I just want to hear you.
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: C4 was the state complaint, your Honor.
a And I'm not sure what the objection was.
6 MS. COMEY: The objection was that it is not
7 inconsistent with the witness's testimony, your Honor. I
8 believe your Honor sustained that objection.
9 THE COURT: That's what I'm hearing you on now.
10 Mr. Pagliuca, you're seeking the admission of the
11 whole document?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: I am, your Honor. Alternatively, the
13 factual paragraphs. This does not have a lot of legalese in
14 it. It didn't seem to be too complicated to me.
15 THE COURT: Okay. So let's pick up the first factual
16 paragraph.
17 So just by way of background, you inquired about this
18 document and asked if Ms. Maxwell is mentioned anywhere in the
19 complaint; correct?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.
2l THE COURT: And the answer to that was no?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Correct.
23 THE COURT: So what I think we then need is to take
24 individual statements to determine if there is some
25 inconsistency with the testimony. So point me to the first
SOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.
