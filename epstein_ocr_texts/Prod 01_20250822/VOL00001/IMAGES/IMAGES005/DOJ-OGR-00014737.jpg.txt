l/l. FT think I should méntion 1/2 as, well, since that's the
Sunday, "until you. reach a verdict,"

Go ahead, Ms, Sternhéim.

MS, STERNHEIM: Thank. you, Judge.

I would just say, with regard to 'those holiday dates,,
that it should be their option. This jury knows that they were
committed ‘through January 15th. If for some réason they have
plans. that are going to distract them by virtue of having to
Cancel them, I think the option iS they can if they wish, but
it can. be continued on. Monday if that is their preference,

THE COURT: Well, I will say, again, if anyone has any
unmeyeable commitments er -- what. have I said? If that is a
hardship 6r anyone has any unmoveable commitments, they can let
Ms. Walliams know, but for the reasons I have indicated, on, the
record, I am going to set this schedule, regarding my conéern
that, given the high likelihood, that a necessany member of the
trial participants or ohe or more members of the jury would
need to quarantine for ten, days should they test. positive, that
that is a substantial delay and only increasing the risk d6ver
tame, and so I am, for the reasons I've indicated, greatly

céncerned, and therefore it's my view that we need to proceed

every day on our schedule unless and, they are not, shy to
indicate == unléss they indicate it's a hardship, okay?

MS. STERNHEIM: You know what our preference is, but,
of course we'll abide by your decision..
