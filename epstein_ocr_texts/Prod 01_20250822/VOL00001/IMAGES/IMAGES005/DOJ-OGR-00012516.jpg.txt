1 THE COURT: Matters to take up?

2 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, from the defense, I think

3 after Mr. Alessi, there is going to be a series of law

4 enforcement agents to talk about items that were recovered

iy during various searches, and I have some objections to the

6 exhibits that I want to raise now, which we've conferred with

7 the government, we've reached agreement on some things, but

8 there are others to raise.

9 THE COURT: Okay.

10 MR. EVERDELL: The first witness -- and this relates
11 to the Florida -- the search of the Palm Beach residence. I

12 believe Mr. Parkinson, who I believe is going to testify after
13 Mr. Alessi, is the agent who went through during the search, of
14 October 20th of 2005, of that residence. He did the video

15 walk-through of the residence. So there is video and he was

16 present. I believe he's going to say he was present when

17 photographs were taken of various rooms and things in the

18 house. Those are going to be offered through him.

19 So there are three things to talk about here with
20 Mr. Parkinson. There is the exhibits — the photographs — the
21 video, and the certain testimony.
22 We'll start with the exhibits, the photographs.
23 We already moved in limine to exclude one of the
24 photographs, that was Government Exhibit 288. That was a
25 photograph, if you recall, your Honor, of a younger girl sort
