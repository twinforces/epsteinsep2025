Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 761 Filed 08/10/22 Page 142 of 246 2437
LCGCmax4 Loftus â€” direct

1 THE COURT: I have them. And have you agreed on how

2 they come in?

3 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, we've offered to stipulate to
4 what the 302 says. My understanding is that the defense

5 prefers a live witness, but we have offered to stipulate to

6 exactly what the witness would testify to if they wish.

7 MR. PAGLIUCA: The witness is here, your Honor. It

8 will be quicker just to put on the testimony than to draft up a
9 stipulation and read it into the record. So I think that's

10 what makes sense to me.

11 THE COURT: I mean, I can't force a stip. I can

12 strongly encourage when it makes sense. All right.

13 And then what's next?

14 MR. PAGLIUCA: The ones that are in contention, your
15 Honor, are transcript trial testimony 1564, lines 4 through 7,
16 and page 1565, 18 through 23.

17 THE COURT: Let me just get my eyes on it. Okay. Go
18 ahead.

19 MR. PAGLIUCA: That corresponds to 3505, 005, page 1,
20 second paragraph, the inconsistent statement is, "Virginia
2l approached Carolyn at a party and asked her if she would like
22 to make $300."
23 THE COURT: So what's in dispute is whether it was at
24 a party or at the Virginia house?
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: Correct.
