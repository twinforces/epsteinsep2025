1 (Jury present)

2 THE COURT: Thank you, everyone. Hi, members of the

3 jury. Please be seated.

4 I did receive your note asking to finish today at 5,

a so I brought you in to dismiss you.

6 A few things.

7 Of course, bear all of my instructions in mind.

8 Please continue to take precautions in light of the increase in
9 the variant. I need all of you here and healthy, of course.

10 So take your masks, be cautious. I appreciate that.

11 You'll begin again tomorrow at 9 a.m. Same

12 instructions: Wait till everyone is there, then begin your

13 deliberations.

14 If deliberations are not complete starting tomorrow, I
15 would like you to make yourselves available to deliberate until
16 at least 6 p.m. Of course, if you all agree to deliberate

17 later than that, you're most welcome to do so. Please just let
18 me know by note when you wish to stop. But I'd like you to

19 plan to deliberate until at least 6 p.m.
20 As with the last time, if that is a hardship that you
21 can't do, let Ms. Williams know that on your way out and we'll
22 adjust. But otherwise, please plan for 6 p.m. Of course, by
23 this I don't mean to pressure you in any way. You should take
24 all the time that you need.
25 With that, I bid you a good night.
