AFTERNOON SESS TON
1:35 BLM,
THE COURT: Mdtters to take up, counsel?

MS, COMEY: Very briefly, your Honor.

Somé Of the courtroém sketch artists, have indicated
confusion about the order about who they are allowed to draw
and. fot. And so I think we would propose 'that before we call a
witness who cannot be sketched, that that be put en the record.
THE COURT: Okay. The only restriction is with
respect to the witnesses who I've permitted to testify
anohymously::

MS. COMEY: That's cornrect, your Honor. And any:
sealéd exhibits, if sdémeone were to somehow glitipse a sealed
exhibit, though, I think that's unlikely given ‘the precautions.
we're taking.

THE COURT: Okay. So. Jet's just. talk, through the
protocol, also what tHe withess will be calléd using the
pseudonym.

MS. COMEY: Yes, your Horor.s

THE COURT: And then I'll swear them in. I would
typically say, State your name for the record: I'll just. say,
I've guanted you ‘permission to testify under the ‘pseudonym,
fill an thé blank. And theh turn the witness over for
questioning.

MS. COMEBY: Thank, you, your Honor.
