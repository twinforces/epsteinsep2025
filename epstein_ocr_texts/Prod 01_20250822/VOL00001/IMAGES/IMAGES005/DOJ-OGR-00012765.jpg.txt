1 MR. ROHRBACH: Thank you, your Honor.

2 THE COURT: I note that, with my thanks to the

3 government, the redacted photos of the 200 series were part of
4 what the Court received in the supplemental production this

S morning, Ms. Comey.

6 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. I think we would propose
7 just to offer those formally at the beginning of the trial day
8 when the jury comes in and then it can be released to the

9 public.

10 THE COURT: Okay. Any objection to this that process,
11 Mr. Everdell?

12 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we got them pretty late, we
13 haven't a chance to review the redactions. I'm assuming

14 they're fine, we don't have objection to process, we would just
15 like a chance to look at them.

16 THE COURT: Of course. Let us know when you've had a
17 chance and they can be moved in front of the jury.

18 I will ask, so going forward, any items that had been
19 admitted in redaction form to the extent the witness or the
20 jury is looking at the unredacted version, the government
21 should show the public the redacted version.
22 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: And going forward, on new exhibits, I
24 think it should be, it's what I had imagined, but we're a
25 little behind, that as the witness and the jury are looking at
