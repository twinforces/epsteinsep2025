10 Honor. The government is not calling Brian as a witness at

11 this time, so there is no basis for us to inguire more about

12 Brian's statements. The other brother is not a government

13 witness and is also not -- there is no suggestion that that

14 brother has been in conversation with Jane about anything of

15 substance in any event. That's a defense witness. Jane has

16 already testified. So there is no basis for us to inquire

17 further about that.

24 have him under subpoena based on his interviews with the
25 government and the things he told the government during his FBI
