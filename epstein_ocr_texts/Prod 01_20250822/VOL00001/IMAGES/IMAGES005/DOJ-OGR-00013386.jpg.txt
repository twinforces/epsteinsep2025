2 THE COURT: I don't know what the question is

3 eliciting.

4 MR. EVERDELL: It seems evident to me that what the

5 government wants to get into is the fact of Ms. Maxwell's

6 father's death around that time. Because I think what they're
7 going to try to do is argue that his death was somehow a motive
8 for her because of their wealth or something connected to her

9 father, and she had to move to a smaller apartment.

10 Now, this is something that is outside of the scope of
11 the conspiracy and wasn't even -- our understanding, it wasn't
12 even her apartment on 59th; she shared a room with somebody.

13 This is really getting totally outside the scope. It is three
14 years before the conspiracy allegedly began and it is totally
15 out of bounds here because they are trying to link it up to

16 something that has no relevance to this case.

17 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think that what the witness
18 will say is that -- I think the witness will say that her

19 father died in between those two, that's all I plan to elicit.
20 And then she moved to a much smaller apartment. She then moved
21 to a series of larger apartments, ending in a large townhouse.
22 There's evidence that Jeffrey Epstein bought that townhouse for
23 her. This goes to Ms. Maxwell's motive to participate in these
24 crimes with Mr. Epstein in terms of the finances that she
25 received and the fact that she was not a particularly wealthy
