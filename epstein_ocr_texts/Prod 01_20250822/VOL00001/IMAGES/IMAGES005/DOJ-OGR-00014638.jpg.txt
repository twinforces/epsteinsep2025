LCKCmax9 Charge

1 In making this determination, you may consider whether
2 the witness purposefully made a false statement or whether it

i) was an innocent mistake, whether the inconsistency concerns an
4 important fact or whether it had to do with a small detail,

5 whether the witness had an explanation for the inconsistency

6 and whether the explanation appealed to your common sense.

7 It is exclusively your duty based on all the evidence
8 and your own good judgment to determine whether the prior

9 statement was inconsistent and, if so, how much, if any, weight
10 to be given to the inconsistent statement in determining

11 whether to believe all or part of the witness's testimony.

12 Instruction No. 46: Law Enforcement and Government

13 Employee Witnesses.

14 You have heard testimony from law enforcement

15 officials and employees of the government. The fact that a

16 witness may be employed by the federal government as a law

17 enforcement official or employee does not mean that his or her
18 testimony is necessarily deserving of more or less

19 consideration or greater or less weight than that of an
20 ordinary witness. In this context, defense counsel is allowed
21 to try to attack the credibility of such a witness on the
22 ground that his or her testimony may be colored by a personal
23 or professional interest in the outcome of the case. It is
24 your decision after reviewing all the evidence whether to
25 accept the testimony of the law enforcement or government
