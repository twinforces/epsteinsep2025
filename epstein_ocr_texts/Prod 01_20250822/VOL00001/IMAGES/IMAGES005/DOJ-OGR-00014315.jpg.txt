of the conspiracy is to violate Néw York law, ‘then, an

invitation to an island that's not New York doesn't count.

Arizona. So there's no cennect.ion to New York. law with respect
to Annie's testimony either.

And so whatever purpose they want to glean from those
two wittnesses' testimony, Katé and Annie, or even Carolyn, the
object of this conspiracy, for this te be a crime, it can only
be hung on thé testimény, at least in the evidence in the
record, the testimony of Jane. And, --

THE GOURT: You're dé6ihg precisely what Mr. Rohrbach
said, which is you're switching back and forth between the
conspiracy and the substantive count. So Annie, for example,
the evidence is the conduct occurred in New Mexico. That's why

I gave the limiting instructidn. But that could be considered

wath other evidence of the conspiracy with respect to New York,
the violation of New York law. Y6u ddén't. havé to have the
violation of New York law ‘to establish the elements of the
conspiracy count.

So the objection is overruled.

Next.
