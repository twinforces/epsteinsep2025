1 THE COURT: You say now it's been put in dispute. It

2 was certainly in dispute at the time you moved. So we'll see

3 what was moved and go from there.

4 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.

a THE COURT: I have the parties proposed Limiting

6 instruction, which looks just right to me. So thank you.

7 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. And aside from this

8 matter, there are no additional matters this morning.

9 MS. MENNINGER: I was going to propose that your Honor
10 handle the Limiting instruction for Ms. Farmer's testimony in
11 the same way that we handled it for Kate in that she would be
12 brought into the witness stand and the Court would read that
13 limiting instruction so the jury can identify the person about
14 who the limiting instruction is being given.

15 THE COURT: I think we indicated yesterday before the
16 break that we would do it the same way.
17 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: There is another issue, your Honor, to
19 a newly disclosed witness as of last night or yesterday
20 evening. The witness's name is William Brown, as I understand
21 it. He is a, I would say, record custodian for DMV related to
22 the identity of an individual that has the same name.
23 THE COURT: Same first name?
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Correct.
25 THE COURT: As Jane?
