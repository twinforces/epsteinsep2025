We did, check the ‘transcript, ‘your Honor. And on page

about what youre testiiyang about here that. says ‘that grooming
can only be do6ne for the benefit 6f the person doing the
groeming, ‘to which Dr. Rocchio responded, No, there's not. And,
then your Honér had asked a seriss of questions relating to the
presence of a third party, what the defense has been referring
to as grooming by proxy, which is a different subject. matter.
