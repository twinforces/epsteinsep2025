LG IAMAX2ps

(Jury net present)

THE COURT: All right. Mr, Everdell.

MR, EVERDELL: Thank ‘you, ‘your Honor. Thé next page

we have is page 94, instruction 39, the conscious. avoidance

‘instruction. ‘Your Honor, on that, the défense objects to ‘this
being included, this instruction being included in the charge.
I think, as the Court is, dwaré, to ‘include an
instruction on consciogus avoidance, you have to establish two

prongs. First, is that the defendant Has to assert some lack 6f

specific aspect of knowledge requimed for conviction. I don't
think we're disputing that. But the second prong is that there
must be an appropriate factual predicate for the charge. And
heré, your Honor, the government's theory of the Case and the
proof that's been elicited through the testimony is that, she
was an active participant in all aspects 6f thé Charges. There
has been testimony by all. of the witnesses that she was not
only participdting and facilitating the séxudal encounters but.
that she participated. So we have testimony fxr
was involvéd, that Ms. Maxwell was involved iff the group
sexualized massages. We had testamony from Annie that the
topless massage was déne by Ms, Maxwell; she rubbed the top
pant of her chest during the topless massage. We jad ‘testimony
from Carolyn that Ms. Maxwell. groped her breasts and commented
upon her hips. These are all active-participant medsures.

This is someone that"s not consciously avoiding.
