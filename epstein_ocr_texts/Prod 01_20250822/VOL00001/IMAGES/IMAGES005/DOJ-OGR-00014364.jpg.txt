1 (Jury not present)

2 THE COURT: All right. Mr. Everdell.

3 MR. EVERDELL: Thank you, your Honor. The next page

4 we have is page 54, instruction 39, the conscious avoidance

iy instruction. Your Honor, on that, the defense objects to this
6 being included, this instruction being included in the charge.
7 I think, as the Court is aware, to include an

8 instruction on conscious avoidance, you have to establish two

) prongs. First is that the defendant has to assert some lack of
10 specific aspect of knowledge required for conviction. I don't
11 think we're disputing that. But the second prong is that there
12 must be an appropriate factual predicate for the charge. And
13 here, your Honor, the government's theory of the case and the
14 proof that's been elicited through the testimony is that she
15 was an active participant in all aspects of the charges. There
16 has been testimony by all of the witnesses that she was not
17 only participating and facilitating the sexual encounters but
18 that she participated. So we have testimony from Jane that she
19 was involved, that Ms. Maxwell was involved in the group
20 sexualized massages. We had testimony from Annie that the
al topless massage was done by Ms. Maxwell; she rubbed the top
22 part of her chest during the topless massage. We had testimony
23 from Carolyn that Ms. Maxwell groped her breasts and commented
24 upon her hips. These are all active-participant measures.
25 This is someone that's not consciously avoiding.
