LCGCmax4 Loftus — direct

1 was that there had been some narrowing there, as well; right?

2 MR. ROHRBACH: That's the government's understanding

3 of the defense response, yes, is that it's narrowed to a few

4 paragraphs of the affidavit.

5 THE COURT: A few paragraphs of the affidavit. Okay.
6 So I will focus my attention on those few paragraphs of the

7 affidavit and try to come back with resolution after lunch if I
8 can. If not, end of the day -- is it fair to assume we're not
9 going to get to that today?

10 MS. STERNHEIM: That is correct, Judge. If we were to
11 get there, we would have to do all the logistics about the

12 Webex and I also would need to see if Mr. Hamilton is up to it,
13 physically.

14 THE COURT: Well, you should make that call —-

15 MS. STERNHEIM: I am doing that --

16 THE COURT: Because it will either be today or

17 tomorrow; right?

18 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes.

19 THE COURT: Okay. And then what else do I need to
20 consider? Anything else?
2l MS. POMERANTZ: Not from the government.
22 THE COURT: About how much longer on Professor Loftus?
23 MS. STERNHEIM: With the lunch break, much shorter. I
24 don't expect to be very long and I would like to trim it so
25 that we can move on.
