1 MS. STERNHEIM: I believe the government is putting

3 those into evidence?

4 THE COURT: 823 and 824.

5 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, I am.

6 MS. STERNHEIM: You can hold onto them if you would

24 information filled out by the employee on the insurance cards?
25 MR. ROHRBACH: First of all, for 823, your Honor,
