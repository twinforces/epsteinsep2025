1 until 6:00, but if this schedule presents a substantial

2 hardship for anyone, they'll let my deputy know.

3 As I said this morning, I conclude this is necessary

4 because we are seeing an astronomical spike in the number of

5 COVID-positive cases in New York City due to the highly

6 contagious omicron variant. We are, very simply, at a vastly

7 different place regarding the pandemic than we were only a week
8 ago. We now face a high and daily escalating risk that jurors
9 and/or necessary trial participants would need to quarantine,
10 thus disrupting trial and putting at risk our ability to

11 complete this trial. Put simply, I conclude that proceeding

12 this way is the best chance to both give the jury as much time
13 as they need and to avoid a mistrial as a result of the omicron
14 variant.

15 So that is what I intend to do, and I'll tell you

16 precisely what I intend to say. I'll hear from you.

17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, our only issue would be

18 telling them to deliberate through the weekend and New Year's.
19 I don't think it's unreasonable to have them deliberate through
20 the remainder of the week, but given the fact that the Court
21 told them initially that they would have those days off, I
22 don't think we should go back on that commitment entirely. I
23 do think that it is appropriate that they deliberate through
24 the workweek and then have the weekend off if they so choose.
25 That's my position, your Honor.
