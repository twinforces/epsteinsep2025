wonder iff it might be appropriate iff we could take a brief
break to déal with it. or I tan try to do it without the issues
of the choreography.

MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think a brief bredk would
help with the choreography. I apologize.

MS. GOMEY: I think that. might be necessary, your
Honer. There is an exhibit that. needs to be submitted under

moment and thén return to it later?

MR. EVERDELL# Your Honor, actually, we can do that.
If I'm permitted to fix the problem and, then display it later,
