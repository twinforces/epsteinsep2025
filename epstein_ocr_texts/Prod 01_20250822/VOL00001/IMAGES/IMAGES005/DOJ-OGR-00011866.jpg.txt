LBUCmax3 Visoski - cross
1 A. That is correct, yes.
2 Q. For example, Epstein had an assistant with that same first
3 name; isn't that right?
4 A. That is correct.
5 Q. And it was spelled the same way, wasn't it?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. And you met that person, didn't you?
8 A. Yes, I did.
9 MR. EVERDELL: One moment, your Honor.
10 Your Honor, I apologize for the delay. We have a
11 slight choreography issue that we're dealing with here. I
12 wonder if it might be appropriate if we could take a brief
13 break to deal with it or I can try to do it without the issues
14 of the choreography.
15 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think a brief break would
16 help with the choreography. I apologize.
17 THE COURT: You mean to send the jury back to the jury
18 room?
19 MS. COMEY: I think that might be necessary, your
20 Honor. There is an exhibit that needs to be submitted under
al seal instead of on the screens.
22 THE COURT: Okay. Is it possible to move past this
23 moment and then return to it later?
24 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, actually, we can do that.
25 If I'm permitted to fix the problem and then display it later,
