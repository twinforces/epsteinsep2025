1 BY MS. POMERANTZ:

2 Q. As a CBP officer, is it important to your job to understand
3 whether the CBP records you are reviewing are thorough and

4 accurate?

5) A. Yes.

6 Q. And in your day-to-day work as a CBP officer, do you rely

7 on CBP records from before 9/11 to be complete?

8 A. We'd like to rely on or hope that the records are complete,
9 but not necessarily all the time, no.

10 Q. And why is that the case that records before 9/11 are not
11 necessarily complete?

12 A. Prior to 9/11, there was a little bit of a difference

13 between how the records were submitted to CBP systems and the
14 reliability of the airlines was not as good as it is now or

15 after 9/11.

16 Q. And when did that start to change in terms of when did the
17 records start to be more complete and thorough?

18 A. After 9/11, there were several acts put into place by the
19 U.S. Government. The Department of Homeland Security was
20 created. And basically, the airline industry was at one point
21 mandated now to submit more complete records to CBP. I feel
22 comfortable saying -- as far as the status indicators, I feel
23 comfortable saying roughly 2009, 2010, based on the records
24 that I have ran in my experience, you would see more onboard or
25 not onboard status.
