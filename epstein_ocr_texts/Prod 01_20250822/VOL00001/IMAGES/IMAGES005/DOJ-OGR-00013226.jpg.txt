Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 753 Filed 08/10/22 Page 213 of 264 1654
LC 7VMAX7 Carolyn - cross

1 THE COURT: Sustained.

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: 177.

3 THE COURT: Sustained.

4 MR. PAGLIUCA: 183.

5 THE COURT: Sustained.

6 MR. PAGLIUCA: There's a slightly different argument

7 on 189.

8 THE COURT: Okay.

9 MR. PAGLIUCA: And 195.

10 These are the end dates of the allegations, which

11 brackets it before 2004, which is inconsistent with the

12 testimony. And so these are the last two dates alleged in this
13 complaint which does not go farther than August of 2003.

14 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think the paragraphs

15 themselves are still consistent. I think Mr. Pagliuca can make
16 the point by asking the question of the witness about whether
17 there were any allegations contained after August 2003 in the
18 complaint.

19 THE COURT: Is there a line that says it's the final
20 contact?
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, it just says August 2003,
22 incident one and incident two.
23 THE COURT: Right.
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: And there are no further allegations in
25 the complaint.
