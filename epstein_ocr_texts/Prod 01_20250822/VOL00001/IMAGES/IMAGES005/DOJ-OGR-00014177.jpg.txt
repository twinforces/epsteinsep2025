LCHVMAX2 Young â€” direct
1 A. No, it was actually drafted in October of 2019. The date
2 you're referring to is the date that it was serialized to the
3 case file.
4 Q. Okay. So it was drafted -- it was typed up on October 3rd,
5 a couple weeks after the interview?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. And then it was entered into the system in December?
8 A. Correct.
9 Q. And we don't have a notice of when anyone reviewed it for
10 accuracy on the document, right?
11 A. No, the date of entry is when our supervisor signs off on
12 the reports.
13 Q. Okay. So if I could have you turn on this document to page
14 2, and direct your attention to the fourth full paragraph. In
15 the middle of that paragraph is a sentence that begins with the
16 word "in." If I could have you read that sentence.
17 THE COURT: I caution you not to use the last name.
18 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. I apologize. Not to
19 use the witness's last name, but to substitute "Jane" for her
20 name.
21 MS. COMEY: Sorry, your Honor. I don't see where
22 we're being referred to.
23 MS. MENNINGER: On page 2 of 001 in the fourth full
24 paragraph, in the middle of the paragraph.
25 MS. COMEY: Got it. Thank you.
