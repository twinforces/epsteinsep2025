LCHVMAX4 Dubin - cross

1 sometimes I can't even remember things from last month. And my
2 family notices it and I notice it and it's been an issue.

3 Q. And is that because you've been treated for particular

4 medical conditions?

5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, I think this is beyond the
6 scope of what needs to be discussed at this point.

7 THE COURT: Is this the last question?

8 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: Nothing -- just the question is, is it

10 related to medical issues?

11 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

12 THE COURT: T'll allow it.

13 A. I believe it is.

14 MS. MOE: Just one moment, your Honor.

15 THE COURT: Okay.

16 (Counsel conferred)

17 MS. MOE: Nothing further, your Honor.

18 Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Dubin.

19 THE COURT: Mr. Pagliuca.
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: I have no redirect, your Honor.
21 THE COURT: Thank you.
22 Dr. Dubin, you may step down.
23 You are excused. Thank you.
24 THE WITNESS: Thank you so much.
