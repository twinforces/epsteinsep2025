1 9 to 4:30 tomorrow, and have lunch at 12 noon if possible. So
2 T'll bring them out at 5.

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: I apologize, your Honor.

4 It took a while to get back here.

5 THE COURT: I can't hear you, but that's fine.

6 MS. MENNINGER: He was in the lockup back there.

7 THE COURT: I see.

8 T'll give you the note, Mr. Pagliuca.

9 We would like to end today at 5 p.m., deliberate from
10 9 to 4:30 tomorrow, and have lunch at 12 noon if possible.

11 So I'll dismiss them -- I'll bring them out to dismiss
12 them at 5, bearing instructions in mind.

13 I think the only open question in my mind, I have

14 explored, given the timing, the efficiency with which trial

15 proceeded, it is possible for them to deliberate on Thursday.
16 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I was going to ask you --

17 apologize. I have been in situations where on holidays judges
18 have invited the jury, if they wish to come in. I think given
19 the circumstances here, just Thursday --
20 THE COURT: Yes. And actually, the Court is not
2l always closed before Christmas Eve. So when I thought we were
22 proceeding to trial, it made sense not to sit that day, but --
23 and that is the jurors' expectation, so they may not be able
24 to. But I think if they are not finished their deliberations
25 tomorrow, I should offer that.
