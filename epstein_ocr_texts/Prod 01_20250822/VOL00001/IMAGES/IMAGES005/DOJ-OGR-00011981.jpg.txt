1 in trouble if I said something.

2 Q. During those same years, did you tell your brothers or any
3 of your friends that you were being sexually abused by Maxwell
4 and Epstein?

5 A. No.

6 Q. And why not?

7 A. Because how do you tell or describe any of this to any one
8 of your peers or your siblings when all you feel is shame and

9 disgust and confusion and you don't even know how you ended up
10 there.
11 Q. Were there ever times when you were 14 or 15 and 16, while
12 all of this was happening, where you thought about hurting
13 yourself?
14 A. Yeah.
15 Q. Can you explain to the jury what that was like for you?
16 A. Well, it was a multitude of things, of my father dying and
17 losing our home and then having a manic depressed mother who
18 didn't know how to cope and know how to take care of us and,
19 you know, just kind of feeling like it was hopeless, I guess.
20 It didn't seem like there was a lot of joy to look forward to
21 and it was just -- it was all -- it was very painful. It was
22 all very difficult.
23 Q. Did there come a time when you were a kid when you spoke to
24 a school guidance counselor?
25 A. Yes.
