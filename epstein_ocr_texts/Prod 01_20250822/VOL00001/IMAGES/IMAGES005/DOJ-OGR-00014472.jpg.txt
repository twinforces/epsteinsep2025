LCKVMAX4 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 nothing has been difficult for me; correct?

2 I guess I did.

3 But then you saw the actual application, the whole

4 thing.

a What was that question really about? List two

6 difficult works performed in orchestra, band, or an ensemble

7 within the past year. And Jane answered: Nothing has been

8 difficult for me.

9 So what does that mean? The defense spent a long time
10 trying to discredit Jane with a line that was really about

11 orchestra music. Even Jane didn't realize she was being misled
12 this way until she was shown the question itself on redirect.
13 Here's another example: Remember how Jane was asked
14 about a legal document called an interrogatory? She told you
15 that she'd never seen this document before and she had no idea
16 what it was. And the defense suggested to you that this legal
17 document means that Jane said nobody else besides Epstein had
18 been involved in her abuse. There's this long question here.
19 But guess what: Here's the portion that the defendant
20 didn't show you and didn't read to you. It says, Maxwell
21 facilitated the sexual abuse of Jane and was frequently present
22 when the sexual abuse of Jane occurred. It's right there in
23 that same document. They didn't read that part to you;
24 instead, they plucked parts out of context to create a
25 misimpression.
