8 THE COURT: Are you talking about the agent?

9 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, the agent who conducted the

10 search.

11 THE COURT: Oh, I misunderstood.

12 No, you can't ask the agent unless —-— for the same

13 reason. Relevance has to be to the time period.

14 MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine, your Honor. We just

15 wanted to make sure we understood.

16 THE COURT: Thank you for clarifying, Mr. Everdell.
17 I thought you meant the current witness.

18 MR. ROHRBACH: No, not the current witness.

19 MR. EVERDELL: Thank you, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: Thank you.
21 Okay. What else? Anything?
22 MS. POMERANTZ: Nothing from the government.
23 Thank you.
24 THE COURT: All right. Bring in the witness, please.
25 And we'll bring in the jury.
