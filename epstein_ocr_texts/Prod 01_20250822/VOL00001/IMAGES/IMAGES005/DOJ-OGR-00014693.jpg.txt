1 THE COURT: Entry into the courthouse is required to

2 wear an N95 or KN95.,

3 MS. STERNHEIM: And I would ask that the Court direct
4 the marshals to permit her to wear it throughout the day.

S THE COURT: I will consult with the marshals through

6 the district executive's office. But my understanding of the

7 new rule as of today is that entry into the courthouse requires
8 wearing at all times, except briefly when eating or drinking, a
9 KN95 or N95. But I'll get confirmation of that.

10 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you very much.

11 THE COURT: Anything else?

12 MS. MOE: No your Honor. Thank you.

13 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor. Thank you.

14 THE COURT: Thank you.

15 (Recess pending verdict)

16 THE COURT: We have another note, which will be Court
17 Exhibit 13: May we also have Parkinson's transcript.

18 Ms. Moe, you'll provide that?

19 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. We'll take care of that
20 right away.
21 THE COURT: Okay.
22 And let me just note we have now sent back everything
23 requested in the prior note in terms of supplies, Matt's
24 transcript, as well as the response from me that I outlined
25 last time.
