1 THE COURT: Could you pull up the microphone.

2 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. I apologize.

3 THE COURT: Even though we're three days in, I still

4 can't hear you without the mic.

S MS. MOE: I'm sorry.

6 THE COURT: That's okay.

7 MS. MOE: I believe the witness would explain that

8 when all of this began when she was 14, she was living ina

9 pool house because of her family's financial circumstances.

10 But at some point during the years that followed, her family

11 moved to a second house.

12 THE COURT: And that's the address listed in the 302,
13 as you understand it?

14 MS. MOE: I don't recall offhand whether that's the

15 particular address. I'd want to review the 3500. But I

16 believe the witness was clarifying that she lived at a second
17 house.

18 THE COURT: Okay. All right.

19 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I'm sorry.
20 I believe -- and I'm checking this right now, but I
21 believe the address she put on her 1994 Interlochen application
22 was the address we were showing her the photograph of. And
23 she's saying she's in a pool house or homeless. So I think
24 this is impeaching. I think this goes directly --
25 THE COURT: Again, she said she lived -- they move in
