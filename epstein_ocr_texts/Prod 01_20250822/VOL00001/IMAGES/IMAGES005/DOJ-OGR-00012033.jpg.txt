THE COURT: Could ‘you pull up the microphone.

MS, MOE: Yes, your Honor. I apologize.

THE COURT: Even ‘though we're three days, in, I still

can't hear you without the mic.

MS. MOE: I'm sorry;

THE COURT: That's okay.

MS. MOE? I bélteve the witness would explain, that
when all of this began. when she was 14, she was living ina
pool house bécduse of Her fatlily's finhdncial circtimstances.
But at some point during the years that followed, her family
moved to a sécond house.

THE COURT: (And that's the address listed in the 302,
as you understand it?

MS. MOE: I don't recall offhand whether that's the
particular address. I'd waht to review the 3500. But TI
believe the witness was clarifying that she Javed at a second
house:

THE COURT: Okay. All raght.

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I'm sorry:

I belveve -- and I'm checking this right now, but I
believe the address she put on her 1994 Interlochen application

was the address we were showing her the photograph of. And

she's saying she's in a pool House or homeless, SO IT think

this is impeaching. I think this goes directly --

THE COURT: Again, she said she lived they move in
