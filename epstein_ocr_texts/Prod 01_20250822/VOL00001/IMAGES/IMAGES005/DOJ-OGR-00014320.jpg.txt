1 THE COURT: Yes.

2 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I'm sorry. Could we just
3 return to page 15.

4 THE COURT: Sure.

5 MR. EVERDELL: Line 23.

6 THE COURT: Okay.

7 MR. EVERDELL: There, it says -- and it's also on the
8 next page, but we'll get to that. It says, "Count Five of the
9 indictment charges the defendant with conspiring to engage in
10 sex trafficking of minors. And the word "minors" depends on
11 jurisdiction, and it creates a lot of ambiguity because we've
12 got allegations, especially because the time period of the

13 conspiracy, 2001 to 2004, you know, the word "minors" is going
14 to create an ambiguity, and it raises issues with the age of
15 consent, because you're not a minor unless, you know â€”--

16 THE COURT: You want to change it to an individual

17 under the age of 17?

18 MR. EVERDELL: Yeah, either under the age of 17 or

19 under the age of consent.
20 MR. ROHRBACH: Well, your Honor, first, for the sex
21 trafficking counts, the relevant age of consent is 18.
22 THE COURT: Right. Sorry. Thank you.
23 MR. EVERDELL: Yeah, actually, that's right. That's
24 in the language of the statute itself.
25 MR. ROHRBACH: Yeah.
