1 deliberations.

2 I made clear that they can let me know through my

3 deputy if this presents a hardship for anyone. No one has so

4 indicated. I also made clear that they can take all the time

S they need.

6 I extended the deliberations by an hour each day

7 because we are seeing an astronomical spike in the number

8 COVID-positive cases in New York City over the last one to two
9 weeks duce to the omicron variant. We are, very simply, at a
10 different place regarding the pandemic than we were only one

11 week ago, and we now face a high and escalating risk that

12 jurors and/or trial participants may need to quarantine, thus
13 disrupting trial and putting at risk our ability to complete

14 this trial. Accordingly, extending deliberations by an hour

15 gives the jury more time each day to continue to engage in its
16 thoughtful deliberations.

17 We will take up later in the day how I will approach
18 the remainder of the week and going forward. I think the same
19 reasoning likely will lead me to talk to the jury at the end of
20 the day about continuing deliberations until a verdict is
2l reached.
22 T'll hear you on that now or later, as you like.
23 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I don't need to be heard on
24 that issue now.
25 If I could, I understand the Court has overruled the
