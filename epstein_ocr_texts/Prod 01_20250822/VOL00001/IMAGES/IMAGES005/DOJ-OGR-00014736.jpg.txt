LCT 1MAXT

1 (In open court)

2 THE COURT: Aside from the private information we

3 discussed, I showed this note, Court Exhibit 18, to counsel,

4 and they too can't read the third name listed well enough to be
5 able to respond to it, so I am going to put a note to the jury
6 asking for clarification on that. And we're gathering the

8 issue that I'll come back and run by counsel. So I'll step

9 down to do that. Thank you.

10 THE DEPUTY CLERK: All rise.

13 THE COURT: All right. So we brought some of the

14 transcripts back. I sent my note back asking for clarification
15 on the third name. And then I want you to let me know

16 specifically how you'd like me to respond to the scheduling

17 question. So just to read it again:

18 "May we have clarification regarding our schedule

19 going forward. Are we required to continue deliberations every
20 day, including 12/31 and 1/1/2022, until we reach a verdict?
21 We ask in order to plan our schedules accordingly."
22 So my inclination is to say:
23 "You asked about the schedule going forward. Yes, you
24 will continue deliberations as needed every day going forward,
25 including," and I think -- I mean, they mentioned 12/31 and
