LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 rather than 18, tells you nothing about what she did or didn't
2 do. And if the government had proof to back up Virginia's

3 claims, they could have brought it to you and put her on the

4 stand.

5 As I said at the beginning, the government has really

9 They've also suggested at least three other reasons.

10 One is this culture of silence theory, which is

11 dependent entirely on Juan Alessi and the mysterious household
12 manual. Now, Juan Alessi told you he threw that manual away

13 and never used it, so we don't actually have a single employee
14 who came and testified that they used this household manual.

15 The pilots didn't use it. The office people told you they were
16 never given directions like that and didn't know about it. No
17 one was told not to look anybody in the eye.

18 Larry Visoski did tell you he signed a nondisclosure
19 agreement. He told you that was common for people of wealth;
20 that he had signed it for other people of wealth because they
21 don't want them -- their pilots writing about the famous people
22 who are flying on their planes, like Bill Clinton or Donald
23 Trump or Senator John Glenn or any of the other famous people
24 who you will see on the flight logs. Nondisclosures aren't to
25 hide illicit sexual activity; and not one witness told you that
