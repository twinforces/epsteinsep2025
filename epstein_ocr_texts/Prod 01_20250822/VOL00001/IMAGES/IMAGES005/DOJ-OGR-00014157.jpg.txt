1 MS. COMEY: So then to be clear, your Honor, is it the
2 case that Agent Young is only being called for prior

3 inconsistent statements?

4 MR. EVERDELL: Maybe we need to confer a little bit

Â© before this.

6 THE COURT: Okay. Who's the first witness?

7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Jason Richards, your Honor, Special

8 Agent Richards, which is a short witness.

9 MS. COMEY: That's another witness we offered to

10 stipulate to, your Honor. Prior inconsistent statements, I

11 think there are two that he's going to be called to testify --
12 THE COURT: That he's just doing those, Mr. Pagliuca,
13 or anything else?

14 MR. PAGLIUCA: Excuse me, your Honor?

15 THE COURT: I'm sorry.

16 Is he just doing those two --

17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, that's it.

18 THE COURT: Okay. And then who's after that?

19 MR. EVERDELL: Well, it would have been Young, Agent
20 Young.
21 THE COURT: Okay.
22 MR. EVERDELL: And then it's -- we have Eva Dubin.
23 THE COURT: Okay.
24 Why don't we do Richards and then Dubin, and see if
25 you can stipulate on Young. Does that make sense?
