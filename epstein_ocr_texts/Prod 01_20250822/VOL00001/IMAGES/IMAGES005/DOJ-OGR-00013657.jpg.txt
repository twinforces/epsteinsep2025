1 MS. POMERANTZ: My understanding, your Honor, of what
2 she's going to say is that she didn't want to talk about it;

22 the word and knowing how inflammatory it is and the
23 restrictions put on it to now allow them to even suggest, that
24 is extremely loaded and extraordinarily prejudicial.
25 This has nothing to do with the opening with regard to
