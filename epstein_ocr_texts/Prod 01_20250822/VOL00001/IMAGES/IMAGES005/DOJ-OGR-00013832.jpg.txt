1 First, we can dispense with the incident where

2 allegedly Ms. Maxwell got on the phone and somehow arranged for
3 Jane to get back to Palm Beach, because that is a flight going
4 back to Palm Beach; that is not enticing someone to fly to New
5 York for the purposes of breaking New York law and engaging in
6 illegal sex acts. There's no enticement as would be illegal

7 under the statute there because this is a return trip.

8 As to the first, simply traveling with someone is not
9 enticing; that's just being present on the plane, that's not

10 causing an effect, that's being present. That does not

11 qualify. So simply being on the plane traveling does not

12 establish persuasion, inducement, or enticement.

13 And as to the last, occasionally arranging travel, if
14 that is to be believed, is not enticement either. Jane's

15 testimony, if you look at those transcript cites, your Honor,
16 is that her travel arrangements were typically made by Jeffrey
17 Epstein's office, and that Ghislaine Maxwell occasionally

18 helped out.

19 There is no testimony whatsoever that Ghislaine
20 Maxwell encouraged her to travel. There is no testimony that
21 she tried to convince her to travel anywhere, much less New
22 York, or advised her to travel. We don't even have testimony
23 that Ghislaine Maxwell offered to arrange the travel.
24 All it says is that she occasionally arranged. And
25 maybe it's the office that called -- or that arranged with
