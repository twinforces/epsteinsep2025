1 Sorry, your Honor.

2 BY MS. MENNINGER:

3 Q. Is this page that you see here in front of you from 604 the
4 last page of your journal that you gave to the government in

5 connection with this case?

6 A. I don't recall, but if it's entered that way, then yes, I'm
7 assuming it is.

8 Q. Okay.

9 MS. MENNINGER: We could pull up AF-1, page 7, just

10 for counsel and the witness.

11 THE COURT: That's fine.

12 MS. MENNINGER: I believe it's noncontroversial. And
13 the government has a copy of it now.

14 MS. POMERANTZ: Yes, your Honor, we have a copy.

15 Q. So this is the back of the journal, right?

16 A. Correct.

17 Q. And you gave a copy of this picture of the back of this

18 journal to the government?

19 A. Right.
20 Q. And so that's what we have.
21 A. Oh, yeah. Okay.
22 Q. We've covered everything that you gave to the government in
23 relationship to this journal?
24 A. Okay. Yes.
25 Q. Correct?
