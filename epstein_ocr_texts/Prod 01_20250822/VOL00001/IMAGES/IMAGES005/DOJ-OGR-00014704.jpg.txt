MR. EVERDELL: Right?

The travel back to a place where she is presumably not

engaging in illicit séxual activity, that is not a Significant
or motivating purpose’ for that travel.
THE COURT: You didn't answer my question.

MR, EVERDELL: Maybe I'm confused by the question,
your Honor.

THE COURT: To be found guilty on. this count, must the
Sury conclude 'that she aided in the trdnsportation, of Jane's
flight to New Mexico?

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honér, tay I interject. myself

into this conversat-ton,?

THE COURT: If ydéu answer the questidn,; I would value

MS. MENNINGER: JI will.

It has to be a place for which the travel was ‘a
significant or motivating purpose for illegal sexual activity.

In this hypothetical that they've given in this
question, they have a comma in two places. The first. place

they have a comma is after the return flight, comma, ‘but not

the flight to New Mexico, where the intent was for Jane to

engage in sexual activity, comma. So they have excluded out

where. they're hypothetically Glaiming that the flight. to New
Mexico was the place for which the intent, was for Jane to
engage in sexual activity.
