1 introduced, it's in violation of Rule 16. I think to the

2 extent there are other exhibits that the defense intends to

3 offer that have not already been produced to us, we would ask
4 that the Court order that they make those productions

5 forthwith.

6 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, we have a very different
7 view of Rule 16. If it is an impeachment document, it is not
8 covered by the rule. We will brief this tonight if your Honor
9 would like. I have a very different view, apparently, than

10 Ms. Comey.

11 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, we do not believe that any

12 prior inconsistent statements that would be admissible --

13 THE COURT: It's not a prior inconsistent statement.
14 MS. COMEY: Exactly, your Honor. Nothing else is

15 admissible as impeachment by my reading of the rules of

16 evidence.

17 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, anything that goes to the
18 witness's memory, bias, motive, all of those are impeachment
19 materials. Impeachment is not limited to prior inconsistent
20 statements. That's just not the state of the law.
21 THE COURT: You can brief it. So if the witness
22 testifies I live in a blue house and you go out tonight and
23 take a photograph of the house and it's a red house --
24 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: -- and you want to introduce a photograph
