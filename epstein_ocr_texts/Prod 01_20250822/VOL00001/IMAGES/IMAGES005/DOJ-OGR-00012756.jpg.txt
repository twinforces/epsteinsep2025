1 MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine, your Honor. Thank you.

2 THE COURT: Mr. Everdell.

3 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine.

4 THE COURT: Timing as to when to give the instruction?

5 MR. ROHRBACH: The government's proffer is to give the

6 instruction before the witness testifies.

7 THE COURT: So straightaway, she's sworn and I give

8 the instruction?

9 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, the government's preference
10 is it would occur before she takes the stand. It can be after
11 the government calls for her testimony, but that way the
12 witness herself is not present while the instruction is given.
13 THE COURT: Mr. Everdell.

14 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, defense prefers that the
15 witness is on the stand when the instruction is given to the
16 jury. We agree that it should be given before she testifies,
17 but she should be on the stand so that the jurors can see who
18 wetre talking about and understands who it pertains to.
19 MR. ROHRBACH: The witness will enter the room as soon
20 as the instruction is complete, your Honor. I think the jury
al will fully understand that it is in reference to that witness.
22 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, the government is trying to
23 divorce this instruction as much as they can from this witness.
24 It's very evident that that's the purpose of doing it while
25 she's not on the stand.
