LC6Cmax7 Maguire - cross

1 A. Not to my knowledge, no.

2 Q. Special Agent Maguire, you went through I think every room
3 in the house during the search; is that correct?

4 A. Yes.

5 Q. So you were on every floor of the house at some point

6 during the search?

7 A. Yes, Sir.

8 Q. And I think you said that there were eight total floors in
9 the house; right?

10 A. That's correct. Six aboveground and two sublevels.

11 Q. So six aboveground and two cellar levels, call it; right?
12 A. Yes.

13 Q. There were no bedrooms in the cellar levels of the house;
14 right?

15 A. Not that I recall, no, sir.

16 Q. So of the six floors that were aboveground, there were some
17 bedrooms in those floors; right?

18 A. Yes, Sir.

19 Q. But needless to say, if there were six floors aboveground,
20 there was no seventh floor aboveground; right?
21 A. No, sir.
22 Q. And there was no eighth floor above the ground with any
23 bedrooms; right?
24 A. No, sir.
25 MR. EVERDELL: One moment. I have nothing further,
