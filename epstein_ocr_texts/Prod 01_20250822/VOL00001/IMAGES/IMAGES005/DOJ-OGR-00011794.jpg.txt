LBUVMAX2 Visoski - direct

1 back up the stairs. We're on the main level. And then there

2 was another staircase that brought you upstairs that housed the
3 master bedroom, as well as approximately three -- three or four
4 guest bedrooms upstairs.

iy Q. When you first visited this ranch, was the main house you

6 just described completed?

7 A. No, it was not.

8 Q. About when was construction on this main house completed?

9 A. It was under construction for a while, that's why he had
10 the triple-wide trailer to stay during the construction. But I
11 would estimate probably late '90s, maybe 2000 is when the house
12 got finished.
13 Q. And so in the mid to late '90s, when you visited the ranch,
14 where did Mr. Epstein stay?
15 A. He would stay up at the lodge or the triple-wide mobile
16 home I described.
17 Q. Could you describe what the interior of that triple-wide
18 lodge looked like.
19 A. Sure. As I mentioned, it was a triple-wide trailer that
20 had a wood western facade built around it to make it a little
21 more attractive than just a mobile home. Once you went in the
22 front door, there was a large wooden deck in the front of the
23 house like you would see in a western movie. And you went in
24 the front door, you walked into the living room which had a
25 fireplace to the left.
