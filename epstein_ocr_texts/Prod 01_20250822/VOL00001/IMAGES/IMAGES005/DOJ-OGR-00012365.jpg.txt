1 THE COURT: What's the question?

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: The question will be: Isn't it true

3 that hindsight bias phenomena could lead to blame of the

4 victim's family or community from not preventing the abuse,

5 which is a direct quote out of article that she is basing her

6 testimony on.

7 THE COURT: I'm sorry. I don't have LiveNote. Can

8 you give that to me again?

9 MR. PAGLIUCA: The quote?

10 THE COURT: No, your question.

11 MR. PAGLIUCA: The question is: Isn't it true that

12 the hindsight bias phenomena can lead to blame to the victim's
13 family or community for not preventing the abuse?

14 THE COURT: That sounds beyond the scope to me.

15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Beyond the scope of an article --

16 THE COURT: I just started with the proposition is it
17 your theory that everything in an article disclosed suddenly is
18 within the scope of the direct, and you said no, rightly. So
19 that's why I asked for the question.
20 The question you asked is beyond the scope of the
21 direct, unless you want to point me to testimony suggesting
22 otherwise, other than the fact that it's in an article
23 disclosed.
24 If I would make everybody answer my first question,
25 it's the first question that gets me where I need to go.
