1 Q. How so?

2 A. We know that younger -- the younger someone is, the more

3 likely they are to delay disclosure; in other words, the less
4 likely they are to tell someone right away about what's

a happening to them.

6 Q. And when you say "the younger," how does that compare in

7 terms of children?

8 A. So when we're talking about children, they are much less

9 likely to disclose. And most children, in fact, we know don't
10 tell anyone about the abuse that they've experienced until

11 adulthood.

12 Q. Is it common for children to disclose sexual abuse at or
13 near the time of the abuse?

14 A. Not at all, no.

15 Q. Why is it not common?

16 A. There are a number of factors.

17 Delayed disclosure is such a common -- commonly

18 recognized phenomenon within the literature that now we are

19 doing research to try to identify what are the barriers to
20 disclosure because, of course, we would like children to be
21 able to tell their experiences sooner so that they can get
22 access to help and so that the abuse can be stopped. So there
23 have been identified both internal barriers and external
24 barriers to disclosure.
25 Q. When you say "external barriers," what are you referring
