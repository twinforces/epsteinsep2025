LCKVMAX2 Summations â€”- Ms. Moe

1 opportunity to explain how all of that evidence fits together,
2 because the proof is in. It's clear, it's consistent, and it

3 points to only one conclusion: Maxwell is guilty.

4 So today, I want to talk to you about eight different
5) reasons that you know Maxwell is guilty. After that, I'll

6 discuss the charges in this case, and then I'll address some of
7 the arguments the defense has made to you throughout this

8 trial.

9 So let's start with the eight reasons that you know

10 Maxwell is guilty.

11 The first reason that you know Maxwell knew exactly

12 what she was doing when she recruited and groomed young girls
13 for abuse is that Maxwell and Epstein were partners. They were
14 partners in crime who sexually exploited young girls together.
15 So let's talk about the relationship between Maxwell and

16 Epstein and how it shows you that Maxwell committed these

17 crimes together with Jeffrey Epstein.

18 The evidence at this trial showed you that Maxwell was
19 Jeffrey Epstein's right hand. For many years they were in a
20 romantic relationship; they were partners. In 2002, Maxwell
21 wrote this essay; it's Government Exhibit 422. Now, you know
22 that Maxwell wrote this essay because you saw the metadata that
23 showed that the author of this document was G. Max, the
24 defendant. And the document was on a computer that was
25 registered to Maxwell. Here's that metadata.
