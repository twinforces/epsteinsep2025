1 to tell the jury to be here at 9, rather than 9:30. We'll take
2 as much advantage of the day as we can.

3 MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, the government and I had

4 spoken about this. And if it's amenable to the Court -- they

S haven't spoken yet, but we can talk about this after.

6 THE COURT: Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.

7 All right. We'll bring in the jury.

8 MS. COMEY: Yes. Thank you, your Honor.

9 MS. STERNHEIM: We were going to suggest also

10 beginning at 9. And whether the Court would inquire of the

11 jury if they would be willing to stay a little later so that we
12 can complete everything on Monday.

13 THE COURT: Okay. You don't mean extended time for

14 deliberations, you mean the closings.

15 MS. STERNHEIM: No, I mean to do the closing

16 arguments.

17 THE COURT: You pushed it off. Yes.

18 MS. STERNHEIM: Closing arguments, rebuttal, charge.
19 THE COURT: And what's your best estimate?
20 We'll do a shortened lunch too, because we presumably
21 won't have issues to work through.
22 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, we estimate that the summation
23 argument for Ms. Moe will be between two and three hours. My
24 rebuttal, it's hard to estimate. I doubt it would be more than
25 45 minutes at most.
