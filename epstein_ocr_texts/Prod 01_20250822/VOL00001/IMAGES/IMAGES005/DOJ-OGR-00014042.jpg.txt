1 A. Correct.

2 Q. In other words, if something contradicts the true events so

3 blatantly, the memory is not as susceptible to suggestion,

4 right?

S A. In that particular study, yes, that was -- that was a

6 wallet-snatching crime. And we were not able to mislead people

7 about the color of the wallet, which was a very obvious,

8 obvious, strong detail.

9 Q. You're familiar with a study conducted by Kathy Pezdek in
10 which Pezdek presented 20 subjects with one true memory and two
11 false memories, right?

12 A. Well, I know about that study, yes.
13 Q. And one of the false memories was being lost in the mall,
14 right?
15 A. Yes.
16 Q. And the other false memory was receiving something called a
17 rectal enema, right?
18 A. GCOLMect.
19 Q. And I'm not going to ask you to describe a rectal enema,
20 but it's fair to say that that's an intrusive bodily procedure,
21 right?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Three of the 20 subjects remembered having been lost in the
24 mall, right?
25 A. Something like that in her study, yes.
