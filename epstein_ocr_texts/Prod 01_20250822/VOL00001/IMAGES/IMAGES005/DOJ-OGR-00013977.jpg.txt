LCGVMAX3 Loftus â€” direct

1 testified more often for the prosecution?

2 A. The prosecution is frequently the one that has -- is

3 putting on memory testimony and maybe wants to bolster that

4 testimony. And the testimony about memory distortion or the

5 potential for false memories is not something that typically

6 fits in their agenda.

7 Q. With regard to the many hundreds of times that you've

8 testified, have you been declared as an expert in the science

9 of memory?

10 A. The vast majority of those 300 cases are testimony about

11 memory. Every now and then I have testified as an expert

12 witness on a slightly different issue, usually having to do

13 with human comprehension, but not necessarily memory, like how
14 people would understand warning labels, for example.

15 Q. And is part of your expertise related to the impact of

16 memory on the brain?

17 A. I talk about memory and the processes of memory. It's the
18 neuroscientist who might be the ones who want to tell you about
19 the hippocampus and the amygdala and how it connects to the
20 parts of the brain. I know a little bit about that and I've
21 included material in some of my introductory psychology
22 textbooks about that; but I would defer to a different expert,
23 if you're talking about matters of neuroscience.
24 Q. Well, with regard to memory though, have you testified
25 about these stages of memory as known in your field?
