LCKVMAX4 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 carried with them for years. That is what the evidence at this
2 trial showed you.

3 Next, the defense has tried to argue to you that

4 Maxwell, that maybe she was just too busy to commit these

5 crimes. So let's talk about that.

6 The employees you heard from at this trial told you

7 that Maxwell had all kinds of people who worked for her. She

8 had personal assistants who she interviewed in the back of a

9 limo, a woman to walk her dog. But despite all of this, the

10 defense tried to argue that maybe Maxwell was so busy managing
11 all of the details of Epstein's life, that maybe she wasn't

12 involved in these crimes; that maybe she was so busy ordering
13 sand to be delivered to Epstein's private island, that she just
14 didn't know what was going on right in front of her. That's

15 the argument.

16 The argument that Maxwell did not know what was going
17 on is flatly contradicted by the evidence in this case.

18 Maxwell participated in the abuse; of course she knew what was
19 happening. And in the moments where she wasn't in the room,
20 she absolutely knew what was going on. The argument that
21 Maxwell didn't know what was happening in the houses that she
22 managed and lived in with the man she was sleeping with, what
23 was going on with young girls she met in person and interacted
24 with frequently, that argument is absolutely absurd and you
25 should reject it completely.
