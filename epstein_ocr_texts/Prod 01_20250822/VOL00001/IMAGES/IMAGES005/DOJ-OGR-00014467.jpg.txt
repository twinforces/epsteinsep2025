LEKVMAX4 Summation, - Ms. Moe

Carried with them for'years. That is what the evidence at this
trial showed you.

Next, the defense has tried to argue 'to you that
Maxwell, that maybe she was just too busy to commit these
crimes. So let's, ‘talk, about that.

The employees you. heard from at this trial teld you

that! Maxwell had all kinds of people who worked for hér. Shé

had. personal assistants who she interviewed in. the back of a
litio, a woman to walk Her dog. Btit despite all of this, the

defense tried to argue that maybe Maxwell was. so busy managing

all of thé détails of Epstéin's life, that maybe she wasn't
involved in these crimes; that maybe she was sq busy ordering
sand to bé delivered to Epstein's private island, that she just
didn't. know what was going on might in, front, of her. That's
the argumént:.

The argument ‘that Maxwell did not know what. was going
on is. flatly contradicted by the evidence ih this. case.
Maxwell participated in the abuse; of course she knew what was
happening: And in the moments where she wasn't in the rodm,
she absolutely knew what was going on. The argument, that
Maxwell didn't. knéw what was Happening in the houses that. she
managed, and lived in with the man she was sleeping with, what
was g6ing on with young girls she met in persdén and interacted
with frequently, that, argument jis absolutely absurd and you
should reject it completely.
