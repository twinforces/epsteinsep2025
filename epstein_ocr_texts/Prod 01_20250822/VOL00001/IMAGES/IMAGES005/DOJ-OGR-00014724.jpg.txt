activity that oOcctirreéd in New Mexico, ‘that wotldn''t be a
sufficient. basis to convict on. Count Four or Count Two because

it requires an intent 'to violate New York law, and you, can't
violate this section of New York law in New Mexico.

So if that's, all ‘they're considéréd on a basis to
convict on ‘Count Four and Count Two, then that would be
insufficient dard improper, and that's, why I think a
supplemental instruction that. clarifies that point 1s. warranted
tin, this case, but I understand the Cotirt has rejected ‘that.

And. that's all.

THE COURT: I think the anstructionh is Gérreét that I

referred them to. The reading of the note that you've
suggested, I have, no idea if that's what the jury is asking or
many other plausible readings, and what you've proposed, as you
just indicated, would be incorrect. So, I think that's why

precisely we sent ‘them back to the change.

Anything else?

MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.

THE COURT: As I said, we'll see where we are at the
end of the day, but in, light, of the variant, my concern about.
interruption 6f trial, giveh the increasing daily risk of
quarantine, it is timé to think to have the jurors make plans
&£o continue deliberdting until a@ verdict is reached.

I will wait until we hear from the jury, otherwise
