Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 218 of 257 3052
LCKCmax9 Charge

1 doubt that Ms. Maxwell knowingly and willfully entered into the
2 conspiracy charged in the particular count with a criminal

3 intent, that is with a purpose to violate the law, and that she
4 agreed to take part in the conspiracy to further promote and

5 cooperate in its unlawful objective.

6 Willfully and Knowingly.

7 An act it is done knowingly and willfully if it's done
8 deliberately and purposefully. That is, Ms. Maxwell's actions
9 must have been her conscious objective rather than a product of
10 a mistake or accident, mere negligence or some other innocent
11 reason.

12 To satisfy its burden of proof that Ms. Maxwell

13 willfully and knowingly became a member of a conspiracy to

14 accomplish an unlawful purpose, the government must prove

15 beyond a reasonable doubt Ms. Maxwell knew that she was a

16 member of an operation or conspiracy to accomplish that

17 unlawful purpose and that her action of joining such an

18 operation or conspiracy was not due to carelessness,

19 negligence, or mistake.
20 Now, as I've said, knowledge is a matter of inference
al from the proven facts. Science has not yet devised a manner of
22 looking into a person's mind and knowing what that person is
23 thinking. However, you do have before you the evidence of
24 certain acts of conversations alleged to have taken place
25 involving Ms. Maxwell or in her presence. You may consider
