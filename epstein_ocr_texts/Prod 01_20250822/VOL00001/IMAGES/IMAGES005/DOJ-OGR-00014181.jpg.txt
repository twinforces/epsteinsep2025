1 Q. If I could have you turn to page 5, and the last full

2 paragraph on that page, I'm going to read this, the first

3 couple sentences here and just let me know if I read anything

4 wrong. I'll substitute the name Jane again. Okay?

5 A. Okay.

6 Q. When Jane was asked if there were times where it was only

7 Epstein, Maxwell, and her in the room, Jane was not sure. As

8 Epstein progressed incidents sexually with Jane, it would go

9 back and forth between just being solely with Jane and going

10 back to the group setting.

11 Did I read that right?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. And now I want to turn to page 7 of that same document.

14 Are you there?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. And the last full paragraph, I'm going to just read one

17 sentence that begins on the fourth line of that paragraph.

18 This relates to the New Mexico trip. She, Jane, did not recall
19 specific abuse that may have occurred.
20 Do you see that?
al A. Yes.
22 Q. And then just a few lines later, there is a separate
23 notation and it carries onto the next page. I'm going to read
24 that. Jane was asked if she recalled any specific abuse that
25 occurred in New Mexico and she stated that she was not sure.
