1 grooming. As she was not endorsed, obviously, under 702, I

2 expect that she will not use that word or give anything that

3 sounds like an opinion along those lines. She's here as a fact
4 witness, your Honor. And the government has agreed they don't
a intend to offer any opinion testimony from her.

6 THE COURT: Great. Thank you.

7 MS. POMERANTZ: That all sounds accurate, your Honor.
8 THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Pomerantz.

9 What else to take up?

10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, if I might, I don't know if
11 the Court wants to take this up now, but I'll just give this as
12 a preview for later.

13 The government has endorsed Mr. Buscemi as a, as I

14 understand it, summary witness. This is a 1006 issue. As I

15 understand it, I don't believe that this is an appropriate

16 summary witness under 1006. As I understand it, the purpose is
17 to talk about testimony or pieces of evidence that have been

18 admitted, specifically not to analyze any complex records or

19 other business transactions or phone records or things like
20 that. So I just wanted to give the Court a heads-up on that.
21 I'm not exactly sure precisely what he's being offered to
22 testify about, but I expect that there will be an objection to
23 that testimony before it happens.
24 THE COURT: Who will I hear from?
25 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
