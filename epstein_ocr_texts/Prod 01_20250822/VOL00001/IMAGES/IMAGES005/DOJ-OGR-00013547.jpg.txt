grooming. As, shé was, not endorsed, obviously, under 702, I
expect that she will not use that word or give anything that
sounds like ah, opinion along those lings. She's hére as a ‘fact
witness, your Hongr, And the government has agreed. they don't
intend to offer any opiniion testimony from her.

THE COURT: Great. Thank. you.,

MS. POMERANTZ: That all sounds accurate, yotir Honor.

THE COURT: Thank. you, Ms. Pomerantz.

What e6lse to ‘take up?

MR, PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, if I might, I don't know if
the Céurt. wants t6 take this up noéw;, but I'll just give this as
a preview for laten.

The government has éndorsed Mr. Buscemi as a, as I
understand it, summary witness. This is a 1006 issue. As L
understand it, I doh't bélieve that this is an appropriate
summary witness under 1006. As LL understand it, the purpose is
to talk about testimony or pieces of evidente that have béen
admitted, specifically not to analyze any complex mecords or
other business transaétions or phone records 6f things like
that. So I just wanted to give the Court. a heads-up on that.
I''m nét exactly sure precisely what he's being offeréd to
testify about, but LI expect that, there will be an objection to
tHat testimony before it Happens.

THE COURT: Who will I hear from?

MS. MOE: Yes, your Horor..
