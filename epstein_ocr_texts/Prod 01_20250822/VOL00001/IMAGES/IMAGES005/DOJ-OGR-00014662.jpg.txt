1 referred to. I think a more limited answer is something along
2 the lines of: You have the admitted evidence relating to

3 3505-5. Something like that.

4 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think it's important to

a clarify for the jury that the particular document they

6 requested is not in evidence; but that they may consider what

7 they already have in the transcript and what they already have
8 in the exhibits.

9 THE COURT: That sounds pretty similar.

10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Which is what I just said without

11 saying the document is not in evidence. Because the testimony
12 about the document is in evidence. I don't think I'm splitting
13 hairs here. I think the evidence is what it is.

14 THE COURT: How about then: You have all admitted

15 exhibits, period. Because it's directly responsive to the

16 question without assuming further questions.

17 MR. PAGLIUCA: I think what we're struggling with is
18 the difference between the testimony and the specific document.
19 I think it diminishes the testimony by inferring that somehow
20 it's not evidence before the jury.
21 THE COURT: They are asking for the document, I
22 presume in part because they have the testimony in front of
23 them.
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Right. Which I'm happy to give them
25 the 35 -â€”-
