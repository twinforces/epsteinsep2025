LC3Cmax3 Alessi - cross

1 Q. You would pay the masseuses when they were done; correct?

2 A. Some of them, yes, sir.

3 Q. And the process that you went through for paying the

4 masseuses was, generally, you would pay them by check; is that
5 right?

6 A. Most of the times I would pay them by check. If they

7 request cash, I will go to my petty cash box and find if I had
8 enough. If I had $100 or $200, I will pay in cash, otherwise

9 it was a process of making them sign a piece of paper and make
10 a receipt, make the check, send a copy of the check back to the
11 office in New York, and that's how they kept the records.
12 Q. Okay. So the process would be someone would give a massage
13 and sometimes they would come down and say to you, okay, I was
14 there for an hour and you would pay them a check for $100;
15 right?
16 A. Yes. The massage, when I was working with Mr. Epstein, it
17 was $100 flat. I didn't have to tip or no tips. It was $100.
18 And it was on repeat girls that came to the house and they will
19 have -- they didn't want to get paid that night and they -- I
20 just kept -- they kept a record on it for the amount of times
21 they were there. So if it was five massage, it was $500 check,
22 $600 check, $200 checks.
23 Q. Let's just break it down so we're clear. You would either
24 pay them when they were leaving or they could run a tab; right?
25 A. Yes, Sir.
