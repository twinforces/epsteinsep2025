2 THE COURT: Well, then it should have been raised

6 MR. EVERDELL: Okay. We can also back up the

7 schedule, your Honor. We can have it done by -- we'll do it

9 a difference for the defense, your Honor, if we have our papers
10 Sunday.

11 THE COURT: Okay. Sunday to Tuesday?

12 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

13 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.

14 THE COURT: To be clear, I don't imagine you'll get

15 resolution from me until --

16 MR. EVERDELL: I understand.

17 THE COURT: --â€” Wednesday.

18 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, I understand, your Honor.

19 THE COURT: And I can't guarantee what time that will

al MR. EVERDELL: Yes. I understand.
22 THE COURT: And again, if this is a significant issue,
23 it should have been raised earlier if you wanted earlier
24 resolution. You're looking at Wednesday evening, at the
25 earliest, resolution.
