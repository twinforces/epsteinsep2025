1 MS. MENNINGER: Ms. -- which witness what?

2 THE COURT: I thought you just said the government put
3 on evidence of the search.

4 MS. MENNINGER: I think it was not Ms. Meder â€”-

a Maguire, Kelly Maguire.

6 MR. EVERDELL: She was the agent who did the search.

7 THE COURT: Did you cross on devices found?

8 MR. EVERDELL: I don't believe I did, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: Why not? I mean, I'm not trying to probe
10 strategy but, like, isn't that precisely --

11 MS. MENNINGER: I think Maguire only did certain parts
12 of the search, in the same way that the Palm Beach -- there

13 were only agents that did certain parts of the search. Agent
14 Young was in charge of the search more broadly.

15 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, that's not accurate.

16 Special Agent Maguire testified that she was the

17 search team leader who oversaw the entire search of that New

18 York residence. And this was absolutely an avenue of cross

19 that defense could have taken. We may have objected, depending
20 on how it was phrased, but we put on the search team leader
2l from that search.
22 MR. EVERDELL: But, your Honor, I don't think Agent
23 Maguire extracted the files from the devices.
24 THE COURT: Did Agent Young extract the files from the
25 devices?
