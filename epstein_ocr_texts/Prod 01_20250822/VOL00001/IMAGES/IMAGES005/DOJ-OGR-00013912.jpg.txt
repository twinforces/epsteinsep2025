1 A. No.

2 Q. Do you know if Mr. Epstein ever traveled with guests on his
3 plane?

4 A. Sure. Yes.

a Q. Did you typically know the names of the guests that were

6 flying?

7 A. No, not really. Sometimes some of his friends would call

8 and ask for a lift to Florida, something like that, but I don't
9 recall the names or I wouldn't really know what guests were

10 flying at any given time.

11 Q. Did Epstein ever travel on commercial flights?

12 A. Not to my knowledge.

13 Q. Would Ghislaine ever travel on commercial flights?

14 A. Yes.

15 Q. And when would she do that?

16 A. There were times where she would either fly to see family
17 in London or she would fly to Miami a couple times. Couple

18 times she came out to California. Just different -- just when
19 she wasn't with Jeffrey, she would be somewhere else.
20 Q. Did you help arrange those commercial flights?
2l A. Yes.
22 Q. Did you arrange commercial flights for anyone else in the
23 office?
24 A. No, not really that I can recall. Maybe, maybe I did, but
25 I don't remember exactly.
