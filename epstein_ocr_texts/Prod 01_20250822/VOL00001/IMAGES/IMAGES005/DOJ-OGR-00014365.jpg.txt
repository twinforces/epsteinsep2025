1 The theory they are proceeding on is that she is an

2 active participant. They can't have it both ways. The proof

3 at trial that they have elicited is that she was actively

4 involved. This seems to be here as some sort of backup option.
5 And that's not permissible, your Honor.

6 And I would add that, in a case like this in

7 particular, there is a real concern that the jurors are going

8 to look at this evidence and, given the subject matter of the

9 case, they're going to think, well, she must have known and

10 that's enough for me because this is conduct that really I

11 can't countenance because it involves children. And then the
12 conscious avoidance instruction will give them license to

13 convict the defendant on an improper basis simply because of

14 the nature of the subject matter.

15 So that's an overlay, your Honor. But at the basis,
16 it's that the proof and the theory of the charging in this case
17 and the proof that's gone with it is that she's an active

18 participant o, so we do not think that there is an appropriate
19 factual predicate for this charge.
20 MR. ROHRBACH: A few responses to that, your Honor.
21 First of all, the witnesses testified that she was an active
22 participant. The jury may reject their testimony that she
23 actively participated and can still convict based on her
24 facilitation of the various offenses, including through a
25 conscious avoidance theory.
