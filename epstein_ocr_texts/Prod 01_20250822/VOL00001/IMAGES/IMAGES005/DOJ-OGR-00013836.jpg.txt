1 inferences in the government's favor, the jury could

2 conclude -â€”- they could find a conviction on Counts One and Two.
3 That bar is surmounted very easily by just the testimony of

4 Jane alone, and I have not even discussed other corroborating

a testimony that would support that conclusion.

6 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

7 Any final points, Mr. Everdell?

8 MR. EVERDELL: Just two, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: Microphone, please.

10 MR. EVERDELL: I can do it from here.

11 THE COURT: That's fine.

12 MR. EVERDELL: The point about Mr. Epstein's actions I
13 won't leave alone; but, of course, only applies to the

14 conspiracy count. Obviously Count Two is the substantive

15 count.

16 THE COURT: You'll address aiding and abetting?

17 MR. EVERDELL: Well, yes, aiding and abetting. So I
18 don't see any testimony of Ghislaine Maxwell aiding and

19 abetting Jeffrey Epstein, enticing her to travel to New York.
20 There's remarkably little testimony about that action, and that
21 is what the subject of the substantive count is, right. You
22 have to show that Ms. Maxwell enticed Jane to travel to New
23 York with the intent knowing that when she got there, that
24 statute, that New York statute that's cited in the indictment,
25 would be violated.
