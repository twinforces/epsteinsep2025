LC1Qmax6 Jane â€”- Redirect

1 be recall that would prohibit the government from conferring

2 with a witness who's completed their testimony?

3 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. We just wanted to navigate
4 that, otherwise I think we would make arrangements for Jane to
a travel home to her family today. And so if we wanted to make

6 those arrangements, we will need to be in touch with her to

7 make those arrangements, otherwise not planning to have

8 substantive communications, but I wanted to be very transparent
9 and candid about those contacts and just the state-of-play on
10 this issue.

11 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, my recollection is that

12 there was a second witness who was going to be offering prior
13 consistent statements for Jane.

14 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. I think our

15 preference would be for Jane to be permitted to leave the

16 district, but if we can be in touch with her about the

17 possibility of a need for recall after today, if there are

18 additional prior consistent statements, we can navigate it that
19 way. Otherwise, Jane would have to remain in the district for
20 I think potentially a long time.
21 MS. MENNINGER: I have no objection to that, your
22 Honor. I do have one clarifying question, which is, while not
23 observing the trial in the courtroom, there is certainly
24 substantial coverage of the trial including relaying witnesses'
25 testimony. So I don't know whether that has been clarified
