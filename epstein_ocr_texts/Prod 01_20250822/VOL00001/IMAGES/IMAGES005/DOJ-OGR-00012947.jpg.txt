1 mean, it's a Low bar for relevance, but for the reasons I

2 indicated in my earlier opinion, substantially far distance in
3 time, highly movable objects that don't appear to be specific

7 prejudice.

8 You have the testimony from the witness as to her

9 experience with the uniforms. It's difficult to see on the

10 current record. But, as I said, I'll look at the testimony and
11 T'll let you know.

12 MR. EVERDELL: And, your Honor, just to be clear, this
13 objection would also apply to the physical outfits themselves.
14 THE COURT: Right. Same point. Yes. Okay.

15 MR. EVERDELL: Thank you.

16 THE COURT: Anything else?

17 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.

18 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor.

19 (Recess)
20 THE COURT: All right. I'm sustaining the objection
21 on 919 and 920 on 401/403 grounds, as well as the actual items.
22 Are there matters to take up?
23 MR. EVERDELL: Not from the defense, your Honor.
24 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.
