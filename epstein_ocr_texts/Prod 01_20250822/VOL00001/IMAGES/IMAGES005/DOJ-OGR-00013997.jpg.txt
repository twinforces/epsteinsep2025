LCGCmax4 Loftus â€” direct

1 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, yes. This does create a

2 bit of a timing problem because it's possible we would get to

3 the witnesses where these issues would come up, so --

4 THE COURT: All the more reason to work it out.

a) MR. EVERDELL: Very true. And if -- well, I guess

6 we'll address if we can't work it out with the Court when we

7 come back.

8 THE COURT: Okay. Were you going to offer something

9 there, Ms. Pomerantz?

10 MS. POMERANTZ: No, your Honor. I saw something pop
11 up on the screen.

12 THE COURT: All right. We'll come back. We're going
13 to need to come back early I think to get to some resolution if
14 we need to.

15 And Mr. Hamilton, you're going to confer on that so

16 that we can have that testimony ready when it's time?

17 MR. ROHRBACH: We'll confer on the details about how
18 to make that testimony happen. My understanding is the Court
19 hasn't resolved the pending motion to preclude the testimony in
20 full.
2l THE COURT: Right. I wanted to know what timing we
22 were talking about for that so that I can look at the papers.
23 MR. ROHRBACH: We'll confer with defense counsel about
24 that.
25 THE COURT: My quick skim of the papers this morning
