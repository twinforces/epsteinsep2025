LG IAMAX2ps

MS. STERNHEIM: ‘Wé"1ll work On, that. I know that ‘the

court reporters have often been very helpful in helping us do

that as wéll.
THE COURT: <All right. Anything else?

MR. ROHRBACH: On, that point, yotir Honor, ‘thé parties

are conferring ‘on the redacted exhibits, and I anticipate we'll

get’ a letter probably later today if not hopefully later today

about exactly what the proposed redacted exhibits are, 'so
that's farnished in advance of the closing.

MR. EVERDELL: We're working on that.

THE GOURT: OK. And havé you worked out. Logistics on
closings for the sealed material?

MS. GCOMEY: Yes, your Honor. I believe the plan is to
do what we did with the video exhibits, which is to have the
presentation from the parties up 6n the jurors' séreéns but not
displayed on the public screens or in ‘the overflow room, And
we've, also been working t6 gét podium turned so that. it's
facing the jurors.

And then I think there will be paper copies of the
presentations of the parties, for counsel. who have screens that
are facing the gallery.

THE COURT: Right. So there will be no -- orally,
you're not going to refer to any real. names of witnesses who
testified by pseudonym, etc. That will at times be shown to
the jury during the presentation, but that won't be publicly
