1 Dr. Loftus's opinions on suggestive activities are generally

2 admissible. The government argues that the above two opinions,

13 examples the government seeks to exclude. So long as her

14 testimony does not state that those activities occurred in this
15 case or go into any specifics of the case, that would be beyond
16 the bounds of a blind expert.

17 Second, I think there is -- the defense has provided

25 King didn't come out until 1997, which the defense also
