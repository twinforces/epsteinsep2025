1 It seems to me, again, I've indicated how I think this
2 proceeds, but I need counsel to tell me what they're

3 requesting. All I have is a letter from the lawyers saying

4 that they have a defense subpoena and their witness would

5 invoke. If the request is that you want the witness to come

6 and invoke formally outside the presence of the jury, we can do
7 that. If the request is some substitution for that, confer

8 with the government and make a proposal to the Court.

9 Okay. What else?

10 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I've conferred with the

11 government a couple times on redactions. I tried that

12 yesterday, I tried it again this morning. I don't have an

13 answer back yet from them, but I hope we can have one soon on
14 some of the exhibits that are outstanding. That's something

15 else that's outstanding.

16 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor, we've been trading

17 views on redactions. We'll finalize them and submit them to

18 the Court shortly.

19 THE COURT: Yes, Ms. Sternheim?
20 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I wanted to inform the Court,
al as the government is aware --
22 THE COURT: I'm not sure your mic is on.
23 MS. STERNHEIM: Now it is. There were technical
24 issues with regard to providing testimony from Mr. Hamilton in
25 England, and we viewed it to be just far too complicated.
