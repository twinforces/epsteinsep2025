LC3KMAX2 Alessi - Cross
1 THE COURT: I need to see earlier portions of the
2 transcript.
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, are you talking about
4 yesterday's testimony?
a THE COURT: Well, I think it's two things. It's

10 836, 837, which was where this was referenced. And for

13 If you go to the page before, 182, you start at line
14 15, that will give you the complete context.
15 If we can blow up for the Court and the witness 182,
16 beginning at line 15.
17 THE COURT: Just a minute.

19 THE COURT: Transcript 835, line 19?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: 19 through 20; 836, lines 1 and 2; and

22 THE COURT: Can you go back to the line in the
23 deposition, please? Now I have 182.
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor.
25 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I just want to make sure that
