LC8Cmax3 Hesse â€” direct

1 Circuit made clear, quote, the term custodian or other

2 qualified witness in Rule 803.6 is generally given a very broad
3 interpretation. A witness need not be a custodian or have

4 personal knowledge of the actual creation of the document to be
5 qualified within the meaning of Rule 803.6. And that's exactly
6 the foundation here under the business rules exception and for

22 Then the second question is sort of a Lieberman-related issue,
23 and that is the content of what's in these messages, the actual
24 words themselves, all the Western Union money transfer records
25 for the truth of the content of what was written in the money
