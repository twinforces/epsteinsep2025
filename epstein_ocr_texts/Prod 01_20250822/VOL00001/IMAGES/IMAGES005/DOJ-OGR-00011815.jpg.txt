13 you complete one for each flight you piloted for Mr. Epstein?
14 A. Yes, I did.
15 Q. What is contained in a flight log?
16 A. A flight log is a document that is pretty much married to
17 the aircraft; it's the history of how many hours the aircraft
18 has on it, how many times the aircraft has landed, each engine
19 has its own total time that's recorded, as well as how many
20 times it was cycled, meaning turned on or off.
21 Q. Will that flight log have any information about the
22 passengers onboard for a particular flight?
23 A. No, it will not.
24 Q. How about the passenger manifest, what information goes
25 into a passenger manifest?
