1 whole thing.

2 Let me just ask. If there were, for example, a

3 paragraph that said these are some of the facts of what

4 occurred, but not all of them, would your omission theory work
5) to get everything in?

6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.

7 THE COURT: If there is a few discrepancies?

8 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.

9 THE COURT: Do you have a case for that proposition?
10 I mean, it's really a factual question whether there is a

11 reasonable inference available from which the jury could

12 conclude that there is an inconsistency by testifying to one

13 thing to inclusion of facts now that were not included

14 previously.

15 MR. PAGLIUCA: I think that's true and it's under the
16 circumstances -- I mean the case law, I can -- I need to pull
17 up my computer to give you the cite here, your Honor, but I'll
18 do that now.

19 THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead, Ms. Comey.
20 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor. I think the theory
21 of omission only works where one would expect that the specific
22 facts that are omitted would be included in the particular
23 statement. This is a lawsuit brought against two defendants
24 and it is containing the core allegations against those two
25 defendants. One would not expect that to include allegations
