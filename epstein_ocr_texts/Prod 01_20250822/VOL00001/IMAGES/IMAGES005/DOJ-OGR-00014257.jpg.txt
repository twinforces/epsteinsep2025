1 THE COURT: Okay. I will look at it and see what the
2 request is.

3 The issue that you noted last night, Ms. Menninger,

4 that you said needed to be done on Monday, what is that? There
5) was something last night when we talked about the defense would
6 likely finish today, you caveated that there was one small

7 short matter that would be done on Monday, and I don't think I
8 know what that is.

9 MS. MENNINGER: I think it's the witness from London,
10 your Honor, that you discussed with Mr. Everdell earlier.

11 MR. EVERDELL: I believe that's what we were referring
12 Eon,

13 THE COURT: I didn't realize that.

14 MR. EVERDELL: I thought I actually said, your Honor,
15 another witness, a short witness that we might need to put on
16 on Monday.

17 THE COURT: That's the same as what you caveated?

18 MS. MENNINGER: Yes.

19 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes, Judge. That's when I said that
20 we would make sure that we were finished so that we could go
al right into the closings.
22 MS. MOE: Your Honor, on that score, I did not realize
23 that that was the same witness we were talking about this
24 morning. If they were aware of this witness yesterday, that
25 name was not on the witness list provided to the government,
