THE COURT: Just. to be clear, I Considered that as to
whether to allow you to introduce ownership documents. I'm
allowing you to introduce ownership ddécuméents. Arguably, théy
were not relevant or marginally relevant, but a 403 issue
because of the complicatidéns 6f ownership. Tf you ¢dn put in
the ownership documents on, stapulation, as to the timing of

almost ‘excluded, it, but didn't, that's mot a basis to call a
new witness.

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, the stipulation would allow
us to put ih the 6whership documents and the Court itself
raised that there is an issue with residency or occupancy.

THE GOURT: I raised that in questioning whether thé
ownership documents were relevant. L'm allowing the ownership
documents in. That's not a basis to call. a new witness.
