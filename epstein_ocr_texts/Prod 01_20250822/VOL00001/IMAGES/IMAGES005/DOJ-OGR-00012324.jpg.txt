LC2VMAX2 Rocchio â€” Direct

1 the child into continued sexual abuse and to reduce the

2 likelihood of disclosure.

3 Q. Dr. Rocchio, I'd like to walk through those stages of

4 grooming in a little more detail.

5 Can you please explain the first stage for the jury.

6 A. So we know from the literature -- literature both with

7 victims and with offenders -- that offenders typically seek to
8 target someone who they believe they're likely to be able to

9 successfully abuse. They target vulnerable children,

10 vulnerable populations. We also know this because there are

11 certain vulnerable populations that are at much higher risk for
12 being sexually abused.

13 Q. Dr. Rocchio, can you explain the second stage of grooming
14 for the jury.

15 A. So the second stage involves perpetrators putting

16 themselves in situations where they are likely to have access
17 to children, but also where they're being around children is

18 not likely to be questioned. We often find perpetrators of

19 childhood sexual abuse in positions where there's lots of kids
20 around. It may be as a coach or a teacher, working at a gym,
21 certainly boy scout leader, they put themselves in situations
22 where their involvement and relationship and access to children
23 are not going to be questioned. And then they will begin to
24 isolate that child, the one that they've selected for
25 victimization, in order to have time alone with the child.
