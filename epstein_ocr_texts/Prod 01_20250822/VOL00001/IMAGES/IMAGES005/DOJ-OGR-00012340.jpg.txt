6 BY MS. POMERANTZ:

7 Q. Dr. Rocchio, based on your experience, research, and

8 training, what factors, if any, place a child at increased risk
9 of being sexually abused?

10 A. The research in particular has looked at what types of

11 vulnerability factors place children at higher risk. And they
12 generally fall into factors pertaining to either the child's

13 characteristics, personal characteristics, issues pertaining to
14 the parents and the parental characteristics, and issues

15 pertaining to the family.

16 Q. Can you explain the personal factors.

17 A. So we know that children who have experienced victimization
18 of any kind, whether it's prior child sexual abuse or physical
19 and emotional abuse or neglect are at much higher risk, for
20 example, of being revictimized later. We know that children
21 who have certain kinds of psychological or chronic health
22 difficulties can be certainly at much higher risk for child
23 sexual abuse. We know that children who come from
24 disadvantaged circumstances can be at higher risk, children
25 with cognitive and intellectual disabilities, for example;
