LCGCmax6 Aznaran â€” direct

1 Q. What sort of information is contained in the manifest from

2 the airlines?

3 A. Generally, the name of the passenger, their date of birth,

4 the document that they're using, whether it's a passport or a

iy green card, the flight information, the carrier code, the

6 flight number, where they're traveling from and where they're

7 traveling to.

8 Q. Is there any information in the TECS system about a border
9 crossing that gets supplied by those immigration officials we
10 talked about at the primary immigration line as opposed to the

11 airlines?
12 A. No.
13 Q. So the people who check you in through the kiosks, is there
14 any information that gets input from there?
15 A. Not by the officers themselves. Once a passenger is
16 processed, there are certain fields that will be automatically
17 updated.
18 Q. But those fields get updated once they go through the
19 immigration line; right?
20 A. Y@S.
21 Q. That doesn't come from the airlines?
22 A. No.
23 Q. For the information that comes from the airlines, the
24 information you mentioned, how soon after the flight takes off
25 does that information get input into the TECS system?
