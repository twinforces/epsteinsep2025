1 of years.

2 And then when I interviewed with agents about this in,
3 I think, late 2006/early 2007, they asked me if I still had

4 those, and I didn't know. So at some point I found them next

5) time I visited my mom. And I held onto them for some time,

6 hoping maybe, you know, they would want them. And then when

7 that didn't seem to come to pass, I just thought, I live in

8 Texas, now I have these boots, and I'm going to kind of reclaim
9 them and use these boots.

10 Q. Did you start wearing those boots?

11 A. I did wear those boots.

12 Q. I want to change topics.

13 Where, if anywhere, did you go during the summer of

14 1996?

15 A. I went on a trip to Thailand and Vietnam.

16 Q. How long were you in Thailand and Vietnam?

17 A. For six weeks.

18 Q. What were you doing in Thailand and Vietnam?

19 A. It was like a cultural emerging trip/service trip. So we
20 built like a community building, and we did some teaching in
21 schools, and then just did some hiking and kind of fun things.

24 marked for identification as Government Exhibit 103.
