1 narrowed the scope of any disagreement.

2 There are two remaining topics. And I think we've

3 agreed that before those topics are raised at a break or before
4 the jury comes out, we're going to confer with the witness's

a counsel just to confirm what issues might be identifying as to
6 those two particular issues. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to
7 resolve any disagreement there, but we want to just work that

8 out before that comes out before the jury. And I think there

9 are one or two issues that we've agreed that won't be raised

10 without a sidebar in advance to discuss them.

11 THE COURT: Okay. Is there no way to do that now

12 while we're waiting for our jurors or --

13 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I think defense counsel's

14 preference was to do that at a sidebar.

15 THE COURT: It's here.

16 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: I just meant I'm happy to do it at the

18 sidebar, to the extent we're referencing the specific

19 identifying information. I just meant as a time saver can we
20 do it now.
2l MS. MENNINGER: I think there are two of the three
22 that we can do now; but the third one depends on what the
23 witness says, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: Okay.
25 Let me just get a check on our juror numbers.
