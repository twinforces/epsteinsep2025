question.
Overruled. You may finish,
A. No, it's not an assumption, because a lot Of the research

that I'm talking about and much of my experience in both

clinical dard forensic settings has been conducted when, the
abuse is actually known or have been found .in a court of law to
have oGctirred or the event offendér has admitted to the
behavior.

Q. You offered some opinions, abotit grooming, Dr. Rocéhio. I
think you referred to grooming as. a series of tactics and
strategies that dre cdmriorily experienced by victims ard
utilized by offenders in the course of deceiving the child
building a4 relatidnship of trust and then eventually sexually
abusing the child. Is that correct?

A; Yéah, that.'S a summary of what I said. Sure, ‘yes.

Q. And these behaviors that you're referring to as grooming
behaviors can als6 be non=groedéming behaviors as well, correct?
A. Some of them, can, ‘yes.

QO. And so théreé ate many things that we do that in hindsight.
one might say is grooming, but prospectively you can"t tell
whethér or not. it's grooming, right?

A. Lt would be 2mportant. though te -- greoming is not a
specific behavior. It's a series and a pattern of beHavidr
thdt!s taking into a@ccount the entire pattern. So it, wouldn't
be just a specific individual behavior.
