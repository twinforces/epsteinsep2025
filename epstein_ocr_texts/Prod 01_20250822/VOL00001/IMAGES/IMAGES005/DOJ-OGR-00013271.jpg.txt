1 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, we do have witnesses, so

2 we're going to have to sort through some logistics ourselves.

3 THE COURT: I understand that.

4 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think maybe if we have

a the opportunity to confer with the government, we can report

6 tomorrow on the options.

7 THE COURT: That's fine. I wanted to make that

8 available so that we're not -- so we have time for it that

9 isn't intruding into the time of the jury next week. So I

10 think in light of what you're indicating, my thinking would be
11 either the evening of the 16th or 17th, or Saturday the 18th.
12 Again, I have inquired and there is no issue,

13 Ms. Maxwell can be here and we can have public access both in
14 the courtroom and overflow room. So you'll confer and let me
15 know your thinking as to timing.

16 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: Other matters to take up?

18 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, on that point, I would

19 like to point out that we do have a younger sibling of Jane
20 under our subpoena and I would ask, because we don't have
21 communications with that witness, that when there are
22 communications with Jane and her attorney, that she be directed
23 not to communicate about her testimony with that witness in
24 light of issues that I think are apparent that I can certainly
25 make a record if need be.
