2 THE COURT: State your ground.

3 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I don't understand the

4 relevance of this question. It seems just like a wholly

5 improper question, what she was asking, whether she asked the

6 FBI to prosecute Jeffrey Epstein at this time. I just don't

7 even understand the question.

8 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, Agent Kuyrkendall signed a
9 declaration in 2017 and she said that she spoke to a number of
10 victims between '06 and '08, and none of them expressed an

11 opinion that they wanted Epstein prosecuted. Now, she clearly,
12 in 2019, did want Epstein prosecuted.

13 THE COURT: She's the witness.

14 MS. MENNINGER: What's that?

15 THE COURT: She's the witness subpoenaed to testify.
16 Her motivation -—-

17 MS. MENNINGER: I'm asking what she said to --

18 THE COURT: Right, but —--

19 MS. MENNINGER: Okay. You want me to ask the
20 motivation? I see.
21 THE COURT: Well, I don't understand -—- well, I'll
22 sustain the objection to the question asked —--
23 MS. MENNINGER: Okay.
24 THE COURT: -—-- about what she told an agent --
25 MS. MENNINGER: Okay.
