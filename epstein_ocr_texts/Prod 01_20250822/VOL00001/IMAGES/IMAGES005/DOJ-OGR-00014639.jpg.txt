1 employee witness and to give to that testimony the weight you

3 Instruction No. 47: Expert Testimony.

4 You have heard what is called expert testimony. An

S expert is allowed to express his or her opinion -- his or her
6 opinion on those matters about which he or she has special

7 knowledge and training. Expert testimony is presented to you
8 on the theory that someone who is experienced in the field can
9 assist you in understanding the evidence or in reaching an

10 independent decision on the facts.

11 In weighing an expert's testimony, you may consider
12 the expert's qualifications, opinions, reasons for testifying,
13 as well as all of the other considerations that ordinarily

14 apply when you are deciding whether or not to believe a

15 witness's testimony. You may give the expert testimony

16 whatever weight, if any, you find it deserves in light of all
17 of the evidence in this case.

18 You should not, however, accept a witness's testimony
19 merely because he or she is an expert. Nor should you
20 substitute it for your own reason, judgment, and common sense.
21 The determination of the facts in this case rests solely with
22 you.
