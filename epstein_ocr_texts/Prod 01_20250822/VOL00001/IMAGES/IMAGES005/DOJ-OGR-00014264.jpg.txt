1 Ms. Maxwell lived at the Kinnerton residence at a particular

2 time.

3 MR. EVERDELL: That's right. She testified that the

4 events that she testified to in the U.K., the events of sexual
5 conduct -- contact with Jeffrey Epstein took place in the

6 Kinnerton Street address. She even identified the photo of the
7 house with the red door across from the Nags Head Pub, which is
8 the 44 Kinnerton Street â€”--

9 THE COURT: It was an interesting moment during the

10 cross that focused on the pub across the street. I remember

11 thinking, huh, I wonder if they have a witness from the pub

12 across the street. I actually did. You know what, you were

13 thinking the same thing, too.

14 MR. EVERDELL: Well, no, your Honor. What we were

15 thinking is we wanted to make sure, because that witness had

16 said on different occasions to the government that the events
17 took place in the apartment across from the Nags Head Pub, that
18 was one time, but she also said it happened at a Kensington

19 address, which, by the way, is not Belgravia, it's somewhere
20 else in London. It's nearby, but it's next door, it's several
21 subway tube stops away. So we weren't sure she was going to
22 say it was the Kensington address or it was the Belgravia
23 address at Kinnerton Street. She committed to the Belgravia.
24 THE COURT: What date was that?
25 MR. EVERDELL: What date was what?
