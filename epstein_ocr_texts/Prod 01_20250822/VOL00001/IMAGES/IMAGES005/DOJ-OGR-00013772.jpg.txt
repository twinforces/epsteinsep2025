LCAVMAX6 A. Farmer â€” cross

1 A. The question is whether it gives me more credibility to be
2 a victim?

3 Q. It gives you more credibility with future clients if you

4 mention your experience during your media appearances; correct?
5 A. My personal experience or my professional experience?

6 Q. Your personal experiences.

7 A. I guess I would say that that is probably not -- people

8 have different opinions about that, about whether that would

9 give you credibility or not.

10 Q. You certainly have not shied away from telling in your

11 public appearances the fact that you are, yourself, trained as
12 a psychologist, right?

13 A. I have shared that.

14 Q. We've talked previously about the fact that you spoke with
15 the FBI in 2006, right?

16 A. Yes.

17 Q. That was with Agent Nesbitt Kuyrkendall, right?

18 A. Right.

19 Q. You did not tell Agent Kuyrkendall in 2006 that you wanted
20 Mr. Epstein prosecuted; correct?
21 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection, your Honor.
22 THE COURT: Sustained.
23 T'll hear from you, if you'd like.
24 MS. MENNINGER: Yes. Please. I'm not clear.
25 THE COURT: Sure.
