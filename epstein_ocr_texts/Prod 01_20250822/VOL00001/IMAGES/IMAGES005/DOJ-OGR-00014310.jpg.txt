1 THE COURT: There is a —-

2 MR. ROHRBACH: --— there was a statutory change that

3 added "foreign commerce."

4 MR. EVERDELL: Yeah.

a THE COURT: It depends on what the operative time

6 period for the inclusion of it is.

7 MR. ROHRBACH: In light of that, your Honor, I think

8 the government would withdraw its request as to Counts Five and
9 Six.

10 THE COURT: Okay.

11 MR. ROHRBACH: To avoid any ambiguity about that

12 point.

13 THE COURT: Okay. All right. So you'll help me,

14 Mr. Everdell, find each instance in which we need to remove

15 "and foreign"?

16 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: The first one you've identified --

18 MR. EVERDELL: If you like, on this charge, I can go
19 through the ones I see on this page.
20 THE COURT: Let me just note the first one we've
21 discussed, because my clerk is going to wait for me to say the
22 change in order to make it. So let me just note on page 15,
23 lines 8 and 9 -- on line 8, deleting the word "and," on line 9,
24 deleting the word "foreign."
25 Next one, Mr. Everdell?
