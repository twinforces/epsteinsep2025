redacting issue is just tq remove her age’ from this clause, L
think that. would be fine and the jury Gan make its own
cenclusions about, you know, Annie's age and how it relates to
the offense:

THE COURT: I understand the broader suggestion, but
in light of my eGarlier conclusion, this third overt act woéuld
read, "In or about 1996, Maxwell previded Annie with an
unsolicited massage in New Mexico.”

MR. ROHRBACH: That."’s my understanding of
Mr, Everdell's suggestion, and the government. would be fine
with that.

MR. EVERDELL: And I guess to clarify, Judge, I'm
understanding the Court's logic to be that the testimony of
Annie, about the topless massage can bé corisidered by the jury
as evidence of the conspiracy to violate New York Law.

THE COURT: That.'s right.

MR. EVERDELL: Okay. And understanding that's the
Céurt’s logie and ruling, then we would == but then we would
like the redaction. We preserve our objection from before,
but -- yes.
