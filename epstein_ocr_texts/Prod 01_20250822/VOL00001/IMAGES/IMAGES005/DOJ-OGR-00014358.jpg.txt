1 not the violation of New York law. So that is our objection to
2 that.

3 MR. ROHRBACH: Well, I think, understanding that

4 Mr. Everdell is I think preserving the earlier objection about
5 Annie's testimony, as far as the suggestion to resolve the

6 redacting issue is just to remove her age from this clause, I

7 think that would be fine and the jury can make its own

8 conclusions about, you know, Annie's age and how it relates to
9 the offense.
10 THE COURT: I understand the broader suggestion, but
11 in light of my earlier conclusion, this third overt act would
12 read, "In or about 1996, Maxwell provided Annie with an
13 unsolicited massage in New Mexico."
14 MR. ROHRBACH: That's my understanding of
15 Mr. Everdell's suggestion, and the government would be fine
16 with that.
17 MR. EVERDELL: And I guess to clarify, Judge, I'm
18 understanding the Court's logic to be that the testimony of
19 Annie about the topless massage can be considered by the jury
20 as evidence of the conspiracy to violate New York law.
21 THE COURT: That's right.
22 MR. EVERDELL: Okay. And understanding that's the
23 Court's logic and ruling, then we would -- but then we would
24 like the redaction. We preserve our objection from before,
25 but -- yes.
