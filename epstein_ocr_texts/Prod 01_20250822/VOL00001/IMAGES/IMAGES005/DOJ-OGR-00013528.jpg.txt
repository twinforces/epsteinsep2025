1 A. Yes.

2 Q. And your daughter was how old in 1994, let's say?

3 A. 1994, she would have been 7.

4 QO. And in 2004, she would have been what, 17?

5 A. 17.

6 Q. Or thereabout. So you were comfortable having your teenage
7 daughter spend time with Ghislaine and around Ghislaine; right?
8 A. Yes.

9 Q. You never saw Ghislaine do anything or say anything that

10 would lead you to believe she was helping Mr. Epstein or anyone
11 else sexually abuse underage girls, did you?

12 A. No.

13 Q. Because if you had seen something like that, as the father
14 of a daughter, you would have done something, wouldn't you?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. And nothing you saw or heard in the roughly 30 years you

17 worked for Epstein ever gave you even the slightest hint that
18 anything like that was going on; isn't that right?

19 A. That's correct.
