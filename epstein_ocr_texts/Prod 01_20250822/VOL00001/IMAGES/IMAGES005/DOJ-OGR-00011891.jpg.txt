1 A. Yes.

2 Q. Did you ever mention this to Ghislaine that Epstein was

3 paying for your daughters' tuitions?

4 A. Yes.

5 Q. So she was aware of this fact, too?

6 A. Absolutely.

7 Q. Did you ask Epstein to pay for your daughters' tuitions?

8 A. He offered it when I first got hired. He said that he

9 would take care of all employees' children's education. So we
10 knew it was pretty much a given.

11 Q. So he offered to do this for all of the employees that

12 you're aware of?

13 A. Yes, correct.

14 Q. You didn't have to ask him for it?

15 A. No.

16 Q. So fair to say that Epstein took an interest in seeing your
17 young daughter succeed; isn't that right?

18 A. That's correct. He believed in higher education.

19 Q. And this was when they were high school aged and college
20 aged; isn't that right?
21 A. Yes, and even younger, grade school.
22 Q. You didn't think there was anything inappropriate about
23 that; right?
24 A. No.
25 Q. It was just a generous act on his part, wasn't it?
