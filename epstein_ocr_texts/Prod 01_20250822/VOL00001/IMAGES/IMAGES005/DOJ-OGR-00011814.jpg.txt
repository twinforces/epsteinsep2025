LBUVMAX2 Visoski - direct

1 Q. While Ms. Drescher puts that up, will you please describe

2 once again what we see in this photograph, Mr. Visoski.

3 A. That's the middle of the aircraft or where actually the

4 emergency exits are located. When you say describe it --

S Q. What we're seeing in the foreground and the background, the
6 jurors weren't able to see the photograph when you were

7 describing it.

8 A. Oh, I'm sorry. Gotcha. I thought I just explained it.

9 I'm going to repeat myself.

10 So this is the round couch, round divan that was in

11 the middle of the aircraft. And then as you see in the photo,
12 the red couch or divan, which was Mr. Epstein's office and

13 which -- to the right side of that, which is not in the photo,
14 there was a large desk. And then in the foreground, way in the
15 back are the two captain's chairs that are actually across from
16 the master bed in the back of the aircraft.

17 MS. COMEY: We can take that down.

18 Thank you, Ms. Drescher.

19 Q. What, if any, barrier was there between the pilots and the
20 passengers on the Boeing 727?
21 A. On the Boeing, each compartment had its own doors, so you
22 can seclude each compartment or even the cockpit from the
23 passengers.
24 Q. During flight in the Boeing 727, was the cockpit door
25 opened or closed?
