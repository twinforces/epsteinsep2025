1 presence in the U.S. -- is that part of it or just the age?

2 MS. MOE: Just the age. What we're offering is not a
3 travel record. I think the photograph that was offered by

4 defense counsel is of an adult. The testimony with that person
S was a person -- so her date of birth makes clear that she

6 couldn't have been a personal assistant as an underage girl

7 given her date of birth and given the timing. This would have
8 been in the 2000s.

9 THE COURT: Rebuttal relevance, I think, is apparent.
10 So I will allow it and we can do it now.

11 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

12 THE COURT: What else can I take up?

13 MS. MOE: Nothing from the government, your Honor.

14 THE COURT: Okay. Ms. Williams will check on the

15 juror members.

16 While we're gathering that, I would like to speak to
17 the parties at sidebar just as to how to address the jury about
18 the followup from the break yesterday.
