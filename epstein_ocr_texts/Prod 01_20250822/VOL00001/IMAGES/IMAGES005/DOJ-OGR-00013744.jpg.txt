1 body being exposed. And I don't remember 100 percent if my

2 underwear was on; that my best recollection is that I was

3 undressed.

4 Q. And today you've testified that you had nothing on during

5 the massage.

6 A. That's correct.

7 Q. So between 2019 and today, you now have a memory that you

8 did not have your underwear on; correct?

12 that the other part was not as clear because that part of my
13 body was not exposed.
14 Q. And you were clear you didn't have a bra on, that was clear
15 in your memory?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. That's what you told him?
18 A. That is what I told him.
19 Q. You've told this jury you didn't have your underwear on,

22 THE COURT: Sustained.
23 Q. You testified on direct that Ghislaine massaged your chest
24 and upper breast; correct?
