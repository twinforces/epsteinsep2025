LCGCmax2 Espinosa â€”- direct

1 and was asked to interview with Ghislaine Maxwell.

2 Q. And can you describe that interview.

3 A. Yeah. It was rather unique. She had been running around

4 doing errands and wasn't able to make it up to the office where
5 I had been interviewed with Jeff and Darren, and so she had

6 asked if -- the receptionist asked me if it would be okay if I
7 can come down and have the interview in the back of the sedan

8 that was driven by a chauffeur. So our interview took place

9 driving around Manhattan in the back of a Limousine.

10 Q. And how did that interview go?

11 A. It went well. It was a different interview than I had

12 experienced before, so I liked it, it was fun and I liked

13 meeting Ghislaine.

14 Q. Did you meet with anybody else or interview with anybody

15 else after your interview with Ghislaine?

16 A. Yes. After I passed that test, I was allowed to meet with
17 Jeffrey Epstein, who would make the final decision on whether I
18 would be hired or not.

19 Q. And how did that interview go?
20 A. And I interviewed back at the office with Jeffrey Epstein
21 after waiting for a few hours for him. And when he came, we
22 had a normal interview, if will you, and I left. And I found
23 out the next day that I was given a job offer.
24 Q. Now you mentioned that you were -- did you take the job?
25 Okay.
