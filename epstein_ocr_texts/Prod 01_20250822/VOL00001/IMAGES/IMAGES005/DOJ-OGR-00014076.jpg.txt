1 Q. Okay. It looks like outbound flights, O's in that column

2 don't have any site information typically. Why is that?

3 A. Because CBP, we don't have a 100 percent outbound mandate,
4 if you will.

5 Q. So you need to track incoming flights, people coming into

6 the United States, but not necessarily people leaving the

7 United States?

8 A. I wouldn't say track. I would say when you come into the

9 United States, you are required to be processed or admitted

10 into the country. When you depart the country, there is no --
11 for example, at JFK, there is no FIS, or federal inspection

12 site with actual CBP officers that are processing you when you
13 go to get on board your outbound flight.

14 Q. Understood. So I just want to take a look at the years

15 that's reflected in this report. If you look at the first

16 page, which are the records of Jane's travel; right?

17 A. Yes.

18 Q. You see the earliest one there is January 6th, 1996; right?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And the latest one there is July 25th, 2004; right?
2l A. Correct. Yes.
22 Q. Now, when you originally did this search, I think you said
23 you searched all the way up to 2010; correct?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. And were there records going that late, do you recall?
