1 MS. MENNINGER: But the rest of the Language, your

2 Honor, last Thursday was "if you want to." And this one seems
3 a little bit more like we're suggesting that you do it unless

4 you have a hardship.

a THE COURT: I clearly have discretion to set the

6 schedule, there's no doubt about that. And I can do it over

7 your objection. So I'm happy to give -- I think we should set
8 it as a default, unless there's a hardship.

9 MS. MENNINGER: I understand that, your Honor. I just
10 would request -- and it's our request that your Honor not

11 include the language "unless deliberations are complete."

12 THE COURT: I will use the same language that I used
13 last week. It's precisely the same language I used on multiple
14 occasions without objection. And I don't want them to assume
15 that I think it should take longer than that. That's the

16 concern. So I don't want them to assume what I'm saying, that
17 I'm suggesting it should take longer. I don't want them to

18 assume it should take shorter. I'm happy to add, if you want,
19 Of course, I don't mean this in any way to pressure you; you
20 should take all the time you need.
21 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, very much would appreciate that,
22 your Honor.
23 THE COURT: Ms. Moe.
24 MS. MOE: No objection, your Honor. Thank you.
25 THE COURT: All right. Bring in the jury.
