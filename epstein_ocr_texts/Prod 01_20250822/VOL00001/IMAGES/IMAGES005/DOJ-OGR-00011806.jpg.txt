LBUVMAX2 Visoski - direct

1 level, the second and third floors, I believe were the guest

2 bedrooms and the master bedroom. And then once you got to the

3 top, which, if memory serves me correctly, might have been the

4 fifth floor where we installed a home theater for her.

5 Q. Switching gears. Between 1991 and 2004, what planes did

6 you fly for Mr. Epstein?

7 A. From '91 to 2004?

8 Q. Yes.

9 A. The first aircraft was a Hawker Siddeley, what's called an
10 HS125. Mr. Epstein purchased that. He had that aircraft from
11 "91 till 1994. And then in 1994, he sold that aircraft and he
12 purchased a Gulfstream, which is called the G2B. And he had
13 the Gulfstream from 1994 up until 2000, when he added another
14 aircraft, is when he bought the Boeing 727. And he continued
15 to keep both of those aircraft. So we flew both aircraft, the
16 Boeing and the Gulfstream, up until 2004, to the date you
17 mentioned.

18 MS. COMEY: Ms. Drescher, would you please pull up
19 Government Exhibits 311 and 312 for the witness, the Court, and
20 the parties.
21 Q. Mr. Visoski, do you recognize these?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. What are they?
24 A. That is the first aircraft Mr. Epstein purchased, which is
25 the Hawker Siddeley 125.
