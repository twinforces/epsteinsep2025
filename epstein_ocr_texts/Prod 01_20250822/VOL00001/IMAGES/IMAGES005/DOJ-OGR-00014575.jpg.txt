LCKCmax7 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey

1 story about the defendant? And it makes no sense for the other
2 lawyers to push this supposedly made up story about the

3 defendant when they've already gotten paid. Remember, the

4 payments have all been made, the lawyers got their money long

5 before this trial started.

6 And you know these lawyers didn't just implant the

7 defendant into these victims' minds. Jane, Carolyn, and Annie
8 all talked about Maxwell, remembered her as part of their

9 experiences a long, long time ago. They all included her in

10 their accounts before there was some supposed incentive for a
11 payday. Annie mentioned it to Dave Mulligan, her high school
12 boyfriend, and the FBI in 2006. She told both of them how

13 Maxwell touched her breasts during a massage. Jane told Matt,
14 her boyfriend from a decade ago, about the woman who would make
15 her feel comfortable in the room. Carolyn mentioned meeting

16 the woman with short black hair and an accent to the FBI in

17 2007. She mentioned Maxwell twice in her deposition, and she
18 told Sean that she saw Maxwell at the house at that time, way
19 before there was a compensation fund or any incentive to add in
20 Maxwell if it wasn't true.
21 And that timing is crucial here because it completely
22 guts the whole defense theory. The defense suggests that some
23 lawyers made everything up about Maxwell to get money, but even
24 if adding Maxwell in to get money could get you money, which is
25 not true, there is no universe in which that was the case when
