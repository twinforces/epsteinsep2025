1 As to the relevance, I mean, for example, we see

2 Jane's travel records going all the way up to 2010. Jane

3 testified in this case already that she continued to travel

4 after she had left New York and continued to travel, and I

a) think this is, if it's already in the record, that she

6 continued to travel. I don't think this is in any way

7 prejudicial --

8 THE COURT: I just would like to know what the

9 relevance is.

10 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, she also testified — Jane,
11 I'm referring to — that she came from a family that did not

12 have much means when she first -- when she was younger. She

13 testified extensively about the fact that she didn't have much
14 money, and these records show extensive foreign travel, going
15 on well into the 2010s. So it tends to counter that.

16 Same thing with Annie Farmer. She said she came from
17 a family with a single mother, didn't have much money, and

18 these travel records show travel to Mexico and places like

19 that.
20 For Kate, there was a discussion about she traveled
21 after the incidents that she talked about in the United Kingdom
22 and she was open-ended about how often she traveled and how
23 long she traveled. And there was also testimony that she was
24 still in contact with Jeffrey Epstein well into the 2000s. I
25 think some of the emails are in the 2010s, 2015. So these
