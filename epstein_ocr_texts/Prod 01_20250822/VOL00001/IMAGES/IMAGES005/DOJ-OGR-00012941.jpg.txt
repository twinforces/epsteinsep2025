(Jury not present)

THE COURT: Counsel, matters to take up before the
break?

MS, MOE: Not frem the government, your Honor, Thank.
you.

MR. EVERDELL:; Your Honor, defense has one matter.
The néxt witness I believe is, Kelly Magttire, who is going 'to go
and. introduce the exhibits, the 900 series exhibits among other
things ‘that we've already discusséd. There aré two photographs

in. there, and we did discuss these, sq I wasn't -- did not get

a chance to preview this for the goveéernnient yet, but there are

two photographs, I believe it's 919 and, 920, that show the

outfits, the schodlgirl outfits.

Now, ‘the Court ruled before that ‘those wouldn't be put
before the jury unless witness 3, or Kate, was able to link
them up. She did talk, about. wearing a schoolgirl outfit.
However, She was not Shown thdése photégraphs in her direct. So

I, think we have a similar problem ‘to what we had with Kate --

soértry:; With Jahe where she déstribed a schoolgirl outfit, but
she didn't look at the actual photos that they want to
introduce and say those 160k like the schéolgirl 6utfits I was
wearing on, the day I described.

So, at this point, because TF don't think there is a
proper foundation for the same reasons as we had with Jane, LI.
would object to those photos being admitted.
