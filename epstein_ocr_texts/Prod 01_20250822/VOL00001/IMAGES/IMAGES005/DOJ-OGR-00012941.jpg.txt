1 (Jury not present)

2 THE COURT: Counsel, matters to take up before the

3 break?

4 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank
S you.

6 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, defense has one matter.

7 The next witness I believe is Kelly Maguire, who is going to go
8 and introduce the exhibits, the 900 series exhibits among other
9 things that we've already discussed. There are two photographs
10 in there, and we did discuss these, so I wasn't -- did not get
11 a chance to preview this for the government yet, but there are
12 two photographs, I believe it's 919 and 920, that show the

13 outfits, the schoolgirl outfits.

14 Now, the Court ruled before that those wouldn't be put
15 before the jury unless witness 3, or Kate, was able to link

16 them up. She did talk about wearing a schoolgirl outfit.

17 However, she was not shown those photographs in her direct. So
18 I think we have a similar problem to what we had with Kate -â€”-
19 sorry. With Jane where she described a schoolgirl outfit, but
20 she didn't look at the actual photos that they want to
al introduce and say those look like the schoolgirl outfits I was
22 wearing on the day I described.
23 So, at this point, because I don't think there is a
24 proper foundation for the same reasons as we had with Jane, I
25 would object to those photos being admitted.
