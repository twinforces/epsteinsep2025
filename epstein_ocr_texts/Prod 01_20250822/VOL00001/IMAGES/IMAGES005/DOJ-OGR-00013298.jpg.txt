THE COURT: I ‘think we'ré on ‘the sanmé page in terms of

the law and in terms of what is the factual record with respect
to the employer's, practice at ‘the ‘time of ‘their filing any
information provided by employees.

MS. STERNHEIM: Thank, ‘you..

MS, MENNINGER: Your Honer, may I briefly address
something?

THE COURT: sure.

MS. 'MENNINGER? Government Exhibit 761 was offeréd, vt
was a Professional Children's Schgol application for Jane. I.
elicited testimony from the offer award that He did not verify
the information pertaining, for example, to the financial,
guarantor, and I 6bjected to the admission of that for the sanie
reasons your Honor 1s artaculating for Lieberman.

THE GOURT: So IT ovérruléd that 6bjection because,

what, seemed, to. me, the relevance was that ‘the witness or her

family was indicating that Mr. Epstein was providing findricial

assistance at ‘the time, whether or not he was providing
financial assistance at the time.

MR. ROHRBACH: I, would, also note, your Honor, that in
addition to the verification line of business recérds cases,
there is another line of cases of adoptive business records
which say that if a cémpany receives a record created by an
outsider and integrates it into their files and relies on it,
lt becomes a record of that business. I haven't so far
