1 THE COURT: I think we're on the same page in terms of

2 the law and in terms of what is the factual record with respect

3 to the employer's practice at the time of their filing any

4 information provided by employees.

S MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.

6 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, may I briefly address

7 something?

8 THE COURT: Sure.

9 MS. MENNINGER: Government Exhibit 761 was offered, it
10 was a Professional Children's School application for Jane. I
11 elicited testimony from the offer award that he did not verify
12 the information pertaining, for example, to the financial
13 guarantor, and I objected to the admission of that for the same
14 reasons your Honor is articulating for Lieberman.

15 THE COURT: So I overruled that objection because,
16 what seemed to me, the relevance was that the witness or her
17 family was indicating that Mr. Epstein was providing financial
18 assistance at the time, whether or not he was providing
19 financial assistance at the time.
20 MR. ROHRBACH: I would also note, your Honor, that in
al addition to the verification line of business records cases,
22 there is another line of cases of adoptive business records
23 which say that if a company receives a record created by an
24 outsider and integrates it into their files and relies on it,
25 it becomes a record of that business. I haven't so far
