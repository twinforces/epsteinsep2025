Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 751 Filed 08/10/22 Page 259 of 261 1420
LC6Cmax7 Meder - direct

1 marked in evidence for eight weeks now. This is not a surprise
2 in any way. It's not our practice, frankly, your Honor, to

3 humiliate women with naked photographs of themselves when

4 they're in a courtroom, and there is no need for it either,

5 given its obvious relevance.

6 THE COURT: I'll consider 309. Anything else?

7 MS. MENNINGER: Not on these photos, your Honor.

8 THE COURT: Any other matters to take up?

9 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank
10 you.

11 THE COURT: Thank you. I will see you at 8:45.
