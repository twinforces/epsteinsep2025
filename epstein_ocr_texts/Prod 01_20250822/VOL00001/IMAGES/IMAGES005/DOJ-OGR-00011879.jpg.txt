LBUCmax3 Visoski - cross

1 A. Correct. Yes.

2 Q. Mr. Visoski, I think you were asked as part of your

3 employment to sign a nondisclosure agreement?

4 A. That is correct.

5 Q. Now, when you were asked to sign a nondisclosure agreement,
6 you didn't think it was unusual, did you?

7 A. Not at all.

8 Q. And you certainly didn't take it to mean that you needed to
9 sign it so you wouldn't disclose some kind of illegal activity
10 that was happening on the plane, did you?
11 A. No, of course not.
12 Q. You never saw anything that came close to that; right?
13 A. Correct.
14 Q. You just took it to mean you couldn't write a book about
15 the stuff and the people you were interacting with; right?
16 A. That's correct. Several of my colleagues have signed the
17 same or similar documents in my profession. It's a fairly
18 normal request.
19 Q. So for people who fly private jets, this is a fairly common
20 occurrence?
21 A. That is correct, sure.
22 Q. You have a lot of people, high profile people we just
23 mentioned, who don't want necessarily all their business
24 written about in a book; right?
25 A. Exactly.
