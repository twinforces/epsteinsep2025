LC.7VMAX5 Carolyn - cross
government has framed ‘this allows, for inquiry abotit that. And
had the government not asked those questions, it was not my
intent to get into any of the child issues.

But I think the jury is left with the impression that
because of what Epstein did to hér, she's now schizophrenic and

has all these schizophrenic concerns about her children, when,

for thé last 19 years, these children Have been repeatedly put
in. different places as a result of her problems.

MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think if Mr. Paglitica is
gaging to go into detail, we should be having this at side bear
under seal, if we're going to be discussing the details of hér
family.

THE COURT: Yess

MR. PAGLIUCA: Okay.

THE COURT: The Gourt reporter requested, so she can

sit, that we do it in ‘the mobing room.
(Rages 1590 to 1601 SEALED).
