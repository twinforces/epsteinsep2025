impeachment aS to when she lived there. ‘What is the relevance

to when she owned it?

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, the records show that. 'the
O'Neills qwned that property until 1997, some’ family of the
O'Néeills, not Ms. Maxwell.

THE COURT: They don't rent places in. London?

MR. EVERDELL: That's Séméthing that ‘the govérnmént,
I'm sure, could argue to the jury. But this is extremely
relevant. We're Eqtally ablé to argué to ‘the jury that’ this

shows. that she ‘owned it, and what Kate is testifying to

couldn't Have happened because ==
THE COURT: Well, again, it, shows ownership. I get

that. The relevant questioh is residence. The gévernment has

testizmony from Ms. Maxwell that she Javed there beginning in
1992. What evidence do ydéu have as t6 whether or not, shé lived
there prior to ownership?

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, if I may Have a moment.

THE COURT: You may.

(Counsel conferred with defendant)

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, J, ‘think the solution to
this problem == and this would hot be a mini trial == is for us
to. be able to admit the records showing the ownership ‘records.
And if thé government. wants to admit the testimony to be ablé
to argue Ehe opposite point, then okay. But that's hardly a
mini trial. And then each side gets to argue their point.
