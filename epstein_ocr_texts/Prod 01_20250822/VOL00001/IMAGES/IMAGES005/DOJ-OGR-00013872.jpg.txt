1 impeachment as to when she lived there. What is the relevance
2 to when she owned it?

3 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, the records show that the

4 O'Neills owned that property until 1997, some family of the

5 O'Neills, not Ms. Maxwell.

6 THE COURT: They don't rent places in London?

7 MR. EVERDELL: That's something that the government,

8 I'm sure, could argue to the jury. But this is extremely

9 relevant. We're equally able to argue to the jury that this

10 shows that she owned it, and what Kate is testifying to

11 couldn't have happened because --

12 THE COURT: Well, again, it shows ownership. I get

13 that. The relevant question is residence. The government has
14 testimony from Ms. Maxwell that she lived there beginning in

15 1992. What evidence do you have as to whether or not she lived
16 there prior to ownership?

17 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, if I may have a moment.

18 THE COURT: You may.

19 (Counsel conferred with defendant)
20 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think the solution to
al this problem â€”-- and this would not be a mini trial -- is for us
22 to be able to admit the records showing the ownership records.
23 And if the government wants to admit the testimony to be able
24 to argue the opposite point, then okay. But that's hardly a
25 mini trial. And then each side gets to argue their point.
