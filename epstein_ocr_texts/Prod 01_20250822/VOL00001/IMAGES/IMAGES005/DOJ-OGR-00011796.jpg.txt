LBUVMAX2 Visoski - direct

1 working for Mr. Epstein?

2 A. Not as much as the other properties. On occasion I would

3 go to pick up luggage and drop off luggage at that place. But
4 I would almost say every trip, but we didn't go to Paris that

5 often, so I'll even go as far as saying most every trip.

6 Q. Other than to pick up luggage, did you go to that apartment
7 for any other reason?

8 A. Yeah. I also did some audio work on the home theater that
9 he had in the Paris apartment as well.

10 MS. COMEY: Ms. Drescher, could we please pull up

11 Government Exhibit 705 for the witness, the Court, and the

12 parties.

13 Q. Mr. Visoski, do you recognize this?

14 A. Yes.

15 Q. What is it?

16 A. That is the exterior of the Paris apartment.

17 Q. Is this a fair and accurate depiction of the exterior of

18 the building in which Mr. Epstein's apartment was located?

19 A. That is correct, yes, it is.
20 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, the government offers this in
21 evidence.
22 MR. EVERDELL: No objection.
23 THE COURT: GX-705 is admitted and you may publish.
24 (Government's Exhibit 705 received in evidence)
25 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.
