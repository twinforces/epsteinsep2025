THE COURT: Or thére would, be fotindation issties,
which, if probed into, essentially would be violative of my
order to the extent that you "re maki ng arguments -- to the

extent that foundational inferences are essentially asking the

agent ‘what. she did or didn't do, which is précisely a Violation
of my order.

And the whole point of the -- I mean, the whole ‘point
of not allowing the defense to put ‘on a case about what the
government did or didn't do and the motivations and the like is

because that's the question for the jury. The question for the

jury is, does the evidence that the government put on, that

they deemed credible, prove beyond a reasonable doubt or not,

the charges; That is the core basis 6f my in limine Holding.
MR. EVERDELL: L'm not trying to violate ‘this, which

1s why we're discussing this, your Hornior. I just thought. there

was some room to be able to elicit evidence about the absence

of evidence rather than just argument to the jury, and that's
what, I was intending to do with this witness. If the Court
thinks what I'vé just proposed, that's génerally the tenor of
the questions on that point are, violative of the order, I
might. have to think it out and hot be ablé to go anto it
because of what you're saying, but I hear what you're saying.
THE COURT: Yeah, I mean, take it == imiaginhe it's a
modern case, right, and you ask why didn*t you get geo location
evidence; it's asking what the government ‘did or didn't do.
