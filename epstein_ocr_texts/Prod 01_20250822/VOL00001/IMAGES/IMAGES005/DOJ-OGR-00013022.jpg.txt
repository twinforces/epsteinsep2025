LC 7VMAX1

1 I got up and when I came to court this morning. I have checked
2 the Westlaw headnotes and there certainly are cases where

3 witnesses are excluded for far more minor infractions than

4 this.

5 THE COURT: But infractions of what?

6 MS. MENNINGER: A sequestration order like walked into
7 a courtroom briefly, you know, or an agent was in the room and
8 heard some of the confidential informant's testimony. That's

9 what I've briefly learned from looking at headnotes, your

10 Honor.

11 Part of my concern is that what you've just heard from
12 the government is those are the two things that Brian

13 volunteered to them. They said they don't know exactly what

14 happened in this conversation. And for all we know, there's

15 more to the conversation than what Brian volunteered, because
16 they may have said, Oh, whoa, don't tell us anymore about that.
17 So that's one of the reasons why my request is to find
18 out exactly what was communicated to him by Jane before he gets
19 on the stand; and that, I would submit, is something that the
20 Court could ask him about under oath outside the presence of
al the jury to determine exactly the scope of the violation here.
22 Because we only know of one document that she told him she had
23 been shown on the stand. I don't know if she told â€”-
24 THE COURT: Do we know what document?
25 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.
