LG.7VMAX1

T got up and when I came to court ‘this morning. I have checked

the Westlaw headnotes. and there certainly are’ cases where:

witnesses, dre excluded for far more minor infractions than,

this,

THE COURT: But infractions of what?

MS, MENNINGER: A sequestration order like walked into
a Courtroom briefly, you know, or an agent waS in the room and
heard some of the confidential informant's testimony. That's
what I've briefly learned from looking at Headnotes, your
Honor.

Part. of my concern is that what you've just Heard from
the government js those are the two things that Brian
volunteered té6 them. They said they don't kn6w é6xactly what.

happened in this conversation. And, for all we know, there's

more to the conversation than what Briah volunteered, becausé

they may have said, Oh, whoa, don't tell us anymore about that.

So that's one of the reasons why my request is to find

out exactly what. was communicated to him by Jane before he gets

on the stand; and that, I would submit, is something that. thé

Court. could, ask him about under oath outside the presence of
the jury to determine exactly the scope of the vidlation here.
Because we only know of one document, that she ‘told him she had
beeh shown on the stand. I doén't khow if she told ==

THE COURT: Do we know what document.?

MS. MENNINGER: Yes; your Honor.
