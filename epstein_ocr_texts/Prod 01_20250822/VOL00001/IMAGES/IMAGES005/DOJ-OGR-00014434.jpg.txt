LCKCmax3 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 her yourself. You met Jane. It was powerful testimony and it
2 was difficult to hear, but you know from your direct

3 observations that she was telling you the truth.

4 You also know it was true because her testimony was

5 extensively corroborated by Alessi, by Matt, and by documents

6 like the flight records, school records, and camp records. And
7 you know it because you recognize the same playbook they ran

8 with Jane when you compare it with what Epstein and Maxwell did
9 with the other witnesses at this trial, and the lengths the
10 defense went to, to try to discredit Jane, just tells you how
11 devastating her testimony was. It proves Maxwell is guilty.
12 Jane was a kid in middle school. She was sexually
13 exploited by Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein. If you
14 believe Jane's testimony, the defendant is guilty on counts One
15 through Four of the indictment.
16 I want to talk to you now about Annie.
17 The fourth reason that you know that Maxwell is guilty
18 is Annie Farmer. Here's Annie. Annie told you about meeting
19 Jeffrey Epstein in New York in December 1995. She was 16 years
20 old. Epstein said that he was taking an interest in her as a
21 student and he talked to Annie about college. Then Epstein
22 took her to the movies with her sister, Maria. During that
23 movie, he held Annie's hand and rubbed her arm. He hid it from
24 Maria, but he was rubbing Annie's arm during the movie. He was
25 trying to desensitize Annie to his touch.
