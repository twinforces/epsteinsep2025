LCGCmax4 Loftus â€” direct

1 A. Yes.

2 Q. Is there the possibility of retrieval from an internal

3 source, meaning within the individual who is trying to recreate
4 the memory?

5 A. Well, in the example that I gave earlier with the stop sign
6 and the yield sign, we do suggest the misinformation

7 externally, we supply them with the misinformation. But

8 sometimes what happens with individuals is they draw inferences
9 about what might have happened or what could have happened or
10 what possibly happened and they can suggest things to

11 themselves. That's called autosuggestion where there is not

12 somebody deliberately suggesting something to you, not

13 deliberately trying to tell you, you know, I saw the thief and
14 he was wearing a brown jacket instead of a green jacket, but

15 you, the witness, are drawing inferences that then start to

16 feel as if they're memories.

17 Q. Going back to the acquisition stage, what would affect the
18 quality of one's acquisition of an event?

19 A. At the time of acquisition, the event itself, well, some
20 obvious thing, how good is the lighting, how far away are you,
21 how distracted are you, are you preoccupied thinking about
22 something else. Sometimes, if you're under the influence of
23 certain drugs. Marijuana is one that has been studied a lot,
24 for example, and we've studied it in a recent paper. That
25 could affect the formation of the memory in the first place.
