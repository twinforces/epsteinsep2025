LC7Cmaxs

1 THE COURT: I do just want to, in an admonishment,

2 because this has gotten a little out of hand. Objection,

3 one-word grounds. Cite a rule of evidence if a rule of

4 evidence is available. If it's not, then you probably don't

5 have a basis for your objection. But if a rule number can't be
6 used, one-word basis for grounds. No more communicating to the
7 witnesses or the jury via objections. Understood?

8 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: Thank you. Have a goodnight, everyone.

11 T'll see you -- sorry. Sorry.

12 So we don't need any of the briefing related to the

13 witness. So I think I'm not expecting anything tonight; is

14 that true? It's like saying, oh, look, no traffic, but --

15 MS. MOE: Nothing anticipated from the government,

16 your Honor.

17 THE COURT: Okay.

18 MS. MENNINGER: Nor from us.

19 THE COURT: I thank everyone. Goodnight.
