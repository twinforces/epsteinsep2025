1 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor. The government has a
2 few proposed redactions to its letter; so we will propose those
3 redactions and docket a version that implements those

4 redactions subject to the Court's ruling on them.

a THE COURT: Okay. Remember, my basic view is get it

6 on the docket and then propose your redactions so that I'm

7 not -- put it on the docket with your proposed redactions and

8 T'll let you know if it should be redacted less.

9 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor. And we will do that
10 today.

11 THE COURT: Okay. And same for -- I think you were

12 just waiting to see if the government had proposed redactions,
13 is that --

14 MR. PAGLIUCA: That's correct, your Honor.

15 I think we can mirror the government's redactions. I
16 have to just think about whether the Exhibit A, I think it was,
17 that was attached and then responded to, I think we need to

18 think about how that gets redacted. And I think Likely my view
19 would be the entirety of it gets redacted.
20 THE COURT: Okay. I will consider that.
21 Anything else?
22 MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing from the government.
23 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: All right. We're missing a couple jurors,
25 but I suspect they'll be here soon.
