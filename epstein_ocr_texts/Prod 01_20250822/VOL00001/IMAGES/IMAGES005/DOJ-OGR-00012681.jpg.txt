1 public.

2 THE COURT: Okay.

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, on this point, I have a

4 related request, and that is, I think, from the defense

a perspective, if Ms. Comey or the prosecutors simply want to

6 say, we move for this under seal, without then the rest of the
7 explanation over and over and over again, that's fine with us.
8 I just think, again, to Ms. Sternheim's point, it highlights

9 sort of why are we doing this. It's fine for the record, I

10 think, and if then we need to make a further record down the
11 road, I don't think we need to expand the reasons for all of
12 this.

13 So I think we're fine with under seal.

14 MS. COMEY: That's fine, your Honor. I'm just trying
15 to set forth the basis, but whatever your Honor would like me
16 to do, I'm happy to just offer it under seal.

17 THE COURT: I need to know what the basis is, that

18 it's being offered under seal for, and I need to find that

19 that's appropriate. So sometimes that's obvious, but it's not
20 always obvious, so I want to take your suggestion,
21 Mr. Pagliuca, but I guess I'm concerned --
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: Believe me, we've been through the
23 sealing issues up and down 35 times here --
24 THE COURT: My job is to make sure that we're not
25 oversealing anything.
