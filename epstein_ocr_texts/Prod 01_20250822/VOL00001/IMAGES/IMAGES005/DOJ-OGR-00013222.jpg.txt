LC 7VMAX7 Carolyn - cross

1 inconsistency. I'm not sure where the disconnect is here on

2 the factual inconsistency where there is specific claim of

3 fondling breasts and buttocks. At the conclusion of the

4 massage, Jeffrey Epstein masturbated himself in C presence,

a paid C in excess of $200 for this encounter, which is also

6 inconsistent with the testimony, which she's claiming 300, up

9 and I think Ms. Comey's points are fully available for cross --
10 sorry, for redirect on this one.

11 The time frame pace is a little difficult to match up
12 exactly given that there is some -- a little bit of a shift --
13 well, it's hard to know what time frame this is referring to,

23 doesn't mention it in 50 different allegations on 50 different
24 dates.
25 THE COURT: Was that the testimony, that there was
