Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 209 of 257 3043
LCKVMAX8 Charge

1 it's a theory of liability that permits a defendant to be

2 convicted of a specified crime if the defendant, while not

3 herself committing the crime, assisted another person or

4 persons in committing the crime. As to Counts Two, Four, and

iy Six, therefore, the defendant can be convicted either if she

6 committed the crime herself or if another person committed the
7 crime and the defendant aided and abetted that person to commit
8 that crime.

9 Under the federal aiding and abetting statute, whoever
10 "aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures" the

11 commission of an offense is punishable as a principle. You

12 should give those words their ordinary meaning. A person aids
13 or abets a crime if she knowingly does some act for the purpose
14 of aiding or encouraging the commission of that crime with the
15 intention of causing the crime charged to be committed.

16 "To counsel" means to give advice or recommend. "To
17 induce" means to lead or move by persuasion or influence as to
18 some action or state of mind. "To procure" means to bring

19 about by unscrupulous or indirect means. "To cause" means to
20 bring something about to effect something. In other words,
al it's not necessary for the government to show that Ms. Maxwell
22 herself physically committed the crime charged in order for you
23 to find her guilty. This is because a person who aids, abets,
24 counsels, commands, induces, or procures the commission of a
25 crime is just as guilty of that offense as if she committed it
