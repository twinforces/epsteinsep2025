1 talking about.

2 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, if I can make a suggestion,
3 I think it makes the most sense to do this after we have

S THE COURT: Right. So do that. And then confer and

6 then you tell me, Mr. Everdell, when would you like to put

7 in --

8 MR. EVERDELL: One moment, your Honor.

9 I think if we can do it by Monday, that would be fine
10 for the defense, if that works for the government.

11 THE COURT: So Monday. If you're in agreement, you'll
12 put in a submission. If you're in disagreement, the defense

13 will move on Monday and I'll hear from the government on â€”-

14 MS. MOE: Wednesday, your Honor?

15 THE COURT: So I suppose we might be looking at this
16 application with respect to witnesses on Thursday.

17 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

18 If I could just have one moment to confer on timing.
19 THE COURT: Yes.
20 MS. MOE: Your Honor, would Wednesday at noon be
al acceptable? If the Court would like additional time --
22 THE COURT: That's fine.
23 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I'm sorry to do this, but I
24 think the concern is high enough among some of these witnesses
25 that -- you know, that they need an answer on this issue sooner
