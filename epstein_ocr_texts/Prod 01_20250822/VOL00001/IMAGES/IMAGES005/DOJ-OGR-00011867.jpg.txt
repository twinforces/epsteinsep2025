1 we just have to return to this topic when we can figure this

2 out. As long as I'm able to return to this topic and display
3 things to the jury, that's fine.

4 MS. COMEY: That's fine with me, your Honor.

5) THE COURT: I don't usually tell lawyers what

6 topics -- you're not going to get an asked and answered

7 objection, if that's --

8 MR. EVERDELL: Yes. Understood, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: So we'll keep going for now. I presume
10 we'll hit the lunch break time and then you can do the

11 choreography.

12 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine, your Honor. We'll do

13 that. We'tre breaking for lunch when?

14 THE COURT: We have jury lunches at 12:30. If you're
15 otherwise done by then, we'll break early and do that.

16 MR. EVERDELL: Let me see if I can also fix it in the
17 meantime.

18 THE COURT: Mr. Everdell, my deputy reminds me, we

19 have a close room with bathrooms, we can just do a short break
20 for the jury.
21 MR. EVERDELL: Thank you, your Honor.
22 THE COURT: So we'll do a five-minute break, members
23 of the jury. Ms. Williams will take you just to that first
24 room where the restrooms are. Thank you.
