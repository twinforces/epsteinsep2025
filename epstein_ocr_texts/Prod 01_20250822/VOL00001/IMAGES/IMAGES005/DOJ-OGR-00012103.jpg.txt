1 we're talking about is impeachment. And so a statement or an

2 issue of bias that's being offered for impeachment, whether

3 we're talking about a Rule 408 issue or otherwise, is only

4 relevant and permissible if this witness knows about it.

5 THE COURT: I agree there are personal knowledge

6 questions in issue. I did ask you specifically if it was a 408
7 issue, and you said yes. You're on your feet, of course, now,
8 and have to respond to me quoting a Second Circuit decision at
9 you. And, of course, district courts are required to follow

10 Second Circuit precedent even if its intention was subsequent
11 changes in the law, unless and until the case is reconsidered
12 by the Second Circuit sitting en banc or its equivalent or is
13 rejected by a later Supreme Court decision.

14 So I do think there may be a question of the change in
15 the rule and what the scope of that was and whether it

16 overturns the Second Circuit decision such that I'm not bound
17 by it. I doubt it. Separate and apart from that is the

18 question of whether she has personal knowledge of what her

19 attorneys did, right.
20 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
21 THE COURT: It's not a 408 issue, it's a foundation
22 question, personal knowledge question.
23 Ms. Menninger made an argument that in the civil
24 litigation context, she could be assumed to have adopted the
25 position of her attorneys. I think we do get to that bridge,
