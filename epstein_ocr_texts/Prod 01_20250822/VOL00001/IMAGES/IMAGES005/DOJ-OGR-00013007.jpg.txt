Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 751 Filed 08/10/22 Page 256 of 261 1417
LC6Cmax7 Meder - direct

1 was above the age of maturity, which is not a crime, not

2 something my client is charged with, and is not a part of the

3 conspiracy in this case. And I think putting on a photograph

4 like that without any supporting testimony about when it was

5) taken, the circumstances under which it was taken is highly,

6 unduly prejudicial.

7 MS. MOE: Your Honor, defense counsel is grasping at

8 straws here. This exhibit is plainly relevant. It's

9 consistent with other trial exhibits and I do take issue with
10 the suggestion that I made any misrepresentation with the

11 Court. I certainly have not done that and would not do that,
12 your Honor.

13 THE COURT: 332, the objection is overruled.

14 309.

15 MS. MOE: Sorry. With respect to 309, that person is
16 the person who testified this morning as Kate. I unfortunately
17 haven't reviewed the final information recently, so I don't

18 want to make a representation to the Court and it becomes an

19 issue. We're happy to examine it and report to the Court this
20 evening. My memory is the file name for this is her first
2l name.
22 MS. MENNINGER: And the date was 2002 when she was 25.
23 And she didn't get on the stand and talk about photographs
24 being taken of her. I mean, she didn't mention it. So now
25 we're going to put in a photograph after she's left the stand.
