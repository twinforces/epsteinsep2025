1 and what the date of the interview was, and nobody liked that.
2 So today I tried --

3 THE COURT: I don't think I sustained an objection to
4 that.

6 there was an objection at the time. But in Rule 613(a), it

7 says: When showing or disposing the statement during

8 examination. When examining a witness about the witness' prior
9 statement, a party need not show it or disclose its contents to
10 the witness. But the party must on request show it or disclose
11 its contents to an adversary party's attorney.

12 And so because I don't believe I have to show it to

13 her. If I want to prove it later with extrinsic evidence, she
14 has to be given an opportunity to explain or deny the statement
15 and the adversary party is given an opportunity to examine the
16 witness about it. That's the way I read that rule.

17 THE COURT: So the extrinsic evidence of a witness'

18 prior inconsistent statement. My point is if she says she

19 doesn't remember, it's not an inconsistent statement. You have
20 to get to a point of inconsistency.
21 MS. MENNINGER: Here is the inconsistency.
22 THE COURT: When you're doing it based on what she
23 testified to yesterday, if there's a difference, yes.
24 MS. MENNINGER: That's what I've been trying to do.
25 THE COURT: Here you're saying on this date you said
