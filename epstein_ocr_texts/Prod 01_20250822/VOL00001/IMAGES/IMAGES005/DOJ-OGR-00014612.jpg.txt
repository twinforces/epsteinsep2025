Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 212 of 257 3046
LCKVMAX8 Charge

1 States Code, Section 371, which provides that: "If two or more
2 people conspire to commit any offense against the United

3 States, and one or more of such persons do any act to effect

4 the object of the conspiracy, each person is guilty of a

5 federal crime."

6 As I'll explain, a conspiracy is a kind of criminal

7 partnership, an agreement of two or more people, to join

8 together to accomplish some unlawful purpose. The crime of

9 conspiracy to violate federal laws is an independent offense;
10 it is separate and distinct from the actual violation of any

11 specific federal laws which the law refers to as "substantive
12 crimes."

13 Indeed, you may find Ms. Maxwell guilty of conspiring
14 to violate federal laws, even if you find that the crime which
15 was the object of the conspiracy was never actually committed.
16 As I'll explain, the three different conspiracy counts are

17 separate offenses, and each conspiracy alleges a different

18 purpose, which I'll describe to you shortly.

19 Instruction No. 32. Counts One, Three, and Five.
20 Conspiracy to violate federal law. The elements.
21 To prove the defendant guilty of the crime of
22 conspiracy, the government must prove each of the following
23 four elements beyond a reasonable doubt:
24 First, that two or more persons entered the unlawful
25 agreement charged in the particular count of the indictment.
