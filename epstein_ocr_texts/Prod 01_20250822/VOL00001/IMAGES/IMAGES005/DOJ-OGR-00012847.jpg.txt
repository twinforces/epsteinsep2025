2 THE COURT: Where are we going, Ms. Sternheim?

3 MS. STERNHEIM: We're going to the fact that this

4 woman was married at the time, she left her husband to travel

5 to spend time with Ghislaine and Jeffrey Epstein, and then, at
6 some point, something happened to her on her way home.

7 THE COURT: What is the relevance?

8 MS. STERNHEIM: It all goes to what her state of mind
9 was when she is testifying about what happened during this

10 period of time.

11 THE COURT: State of mind?

12 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes.

13 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, the defense is asking

14 questions that are very suggestive of something --

15 MS. STERNHEIM: I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

16 MS. POMERANTZ: The defense is asking questions that
17 are very suggestive of something, but I have not yet heard a

18 proffer about that and it seems like where they're going with
19 this is an issue that should have been raised as a 412 issue.
20 THE COURT: Are you suggesting she had an affair?
21 MS. STERNHEIM: No, she said she was associative as if
22 she was using drugs. I'll move on.
23 THE COURT: Okay. Move on.
