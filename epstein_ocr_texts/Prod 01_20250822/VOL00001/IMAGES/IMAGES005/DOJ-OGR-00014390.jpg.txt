LG IAMAX2ps

MR. EVERDELL: Count Two, “enticement of an individual
under the age of 17," And then we would propose “(Jane only),"
to add the word "only," your Honor.

THE COURT: SO adding, after "an individual," "under

the agé of 17," adding in ‘the parentheses, after the word
"Jane," “only.”

MR. EVERDELL: Corréct.

THE COURT: OK.

MR. EVERDELL: Coéuht. Three; to transport and then take
cut the word "a miner," this would be, I guess, “individuals
under the age of 17."

MR. ROHRBACH: Agreed, your Honor.

THE GOURT: OK. I will make that change to
“individuals under the age of 17," taking out "a minor,"

MR. EVERDELL: And then Gount Four, “transportation of
an, individual," adding "under the age of 17" and adding the
word “only™ after "Jane."

THE COURT:  OK,.

MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine, your Hon6dr.

THE COURT: All right. Make that change, adding
“under the age of 17" ahd then adding “only" after the word
“Jane.”

MR. EVERDELL: Let's just skip over Count Five for a
second. Count Six.

THE COURT: "Only."
