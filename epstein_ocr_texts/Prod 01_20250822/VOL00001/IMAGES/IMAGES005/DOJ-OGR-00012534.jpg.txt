1 Maguire is an FBI agent who assisted with the search of

2 Mr. Epstein's Manhattan townhouse in July of 2019. So that's

3 after his arrest, they executed several search warrants at his
4 Manhattan townhouse, collected a number of items of evidence,

5 and took photographs of the exterior and the interior of the

6 townhouse.

7 My understanding is that the government plans to

8 introduce a number of the photographs of the exterior and

9 interior through Ms. Maguire, who was present during the

10 search, and also certain physical items like they're not --

11 well, there were hard drives that were found and CDs that were
12 found. Those I don't believe are going to be admitted, but

13 she's going to discuss them, and there is also some physical

14 items like costumes and a massage table there.

15 I think we should start with the physical items,

16 because I did with confer with the government and we reached

17 some agreement or understanding about the hard drives and the
18 disc because they purportedly contain information that relates
19 back to the time period of the conspiracy, we don't have an
20 issue with, and my understanding is they're not going to
21 introduce the hard drives or the discs themselves, or even
22 photographs of the hard drives or the disc. So that I don't
23 think is an issue if I'm correct, Ms. Moe?
24 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: So other physical items that might come in
