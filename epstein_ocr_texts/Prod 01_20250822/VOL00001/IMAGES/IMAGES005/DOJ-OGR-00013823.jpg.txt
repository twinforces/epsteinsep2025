LCAVMAX8 Swain - cross

1 THE COURT: Just a moment. I need to hear you. I'm

2 not tracking.

3 MS. MENNINGER: Okay.

4 (At sidebar)

a THE COURT: Where are we going?

6 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, once the government

7 elicits co-conspirator statements under 801(d) (2) (E), under

8 806, I'm allowed to impeach the declarant as though they were

9 testifying. So I'm asking questions about Jeffrey Epstein

10 through this witness, who is the one from whom they elicited

11 the 801(d) (2) (E) statements. That's what I believe 806

12 provides.

13 THE COURT: You have a series of questions about

14 things that Epstein didn't tell her?

15 MS. MENNINGER: Correct.

16 MS. MOE: Your Honor, this is all a line of argument,
17 they are not questions. This witness doesn't know anything

18 about it. I'm not sure what the basis is for trying to impeach
19 Jeffrey Epstein's credibility through this particular witness.
20 It's all argument.
21 THE COURT: We're not going to do ten --
22 MS. MENNINGER: No.
23 THE COURT: We're going to do --
24 MS. MENNINGER: A handful; three.
25 THE COURT: Three questions and then move on.
