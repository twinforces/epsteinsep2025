THE COURT: Okay.

MS. MENNINGER: I think so, your Honor,

THE COURT: All right. I'm just looking at the

calendar. The defense case begins ‘on the loth, We have the

léth, the 17th. ‘We'll do ‘the charging conference on the 18th,

if the defense case continues. into the next week.
But let! me just Encotirage -- Given this break, that
we're going on and -—— here's just the one thing LI want to say.

T'll héar from you, but Ti want -- if the défense were 'to rest

on. the 17th, for example, then. I will expect closings, absent a
rebuttal case, On the 20th. Everybody agree with that?

MS, STERNHEIM: Yes, Judge.

But I think it's highly unlikely that we will complete
it on Friday, and I would ask the Court to take that into
consideration.

THE COURT: Okay. So Jet's say you rest on the 20th,
Ms, Sternheim.

MS. STERNHEIM: That. is our anticipation.

THE GOURT: Okay: S6 thén wé would anticipate
closings on the 2lst; correct?

MS. STERNHEIM: Judgé, wé would like to at léast.
discuss our concerns about a jury deliberating one day prior to
a Christmas holiday. I think that giveh that, as was

Thanksgiving, Christmas this year is particularly celebratory

since people were inot able to do that last year.
