LC 7VMAX1

1 had called him after her testimony and relayed that her

2 experience wasn't pleasant.

3 THE COURT: It sounds like maybe more than that it

4 wasn't pleasant; sounds like part of what was relayed -- that's
S not the part that concerns me. Needless to say, the point

6 that's concerning is whether she coached him on her responses

7 so that his testimony regarding prior consistent statements

8 would show consistency. That's, I think, the only --

9 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: I'm not sure there's any relevance -â€”-

11 although it's concerning, I'm not sure there's any relevance to
12 a description of the process is unpleasant or that they did or
13 didn't like the lawyers and how they were treated.

14 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

15 On the subject of the prior consistent statement, I

16 would note -- and the 3500 material reflects this -- that Brian
17 had relayed the substance of his testimony to the government

18 and it's memorialized in 3500 long before this conversation

19 happened. He has been on our witness list for some time; he's
20 met with the government long before this trial began.
21 And so to the extent there is any suggestion that his
22 testimony is prompted by a recent conversation with Jane during
23 the trial, that's belied by the record here, which is that he
24 has relayed to us those prior consistent statements
25 substantially in advance of the trial.
