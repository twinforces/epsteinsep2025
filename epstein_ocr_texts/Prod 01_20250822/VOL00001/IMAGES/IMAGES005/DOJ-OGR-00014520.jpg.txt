LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 doesn't work. She tried her best to reconstruct the time.

2 She's wrong. That's just the way it is. So if we had her

i) journals, we might know, but we don't.

4 So then if you look a year later, in April of 1997,

5 there is a trip where Jeffrey and Ghislaine go about that time
6 of year together to New Mexico in March or April of 1997.

7 Annie Farmer is 17, almost 18 years old. And there is a flight
8 log that shows them going at that time. So maybe she just got
9 it wrong by a year, meaning she's 17 when she went there.

10 She also says that trip to New Mexico happened right
11 before she went to Thailand. So naturally, one would look at
12 her border patrol records and figure out when did she go to

13 Thailand, because that would help us figure out when she

14 actually went. So when you look at those records, it shows her
15 very first trip out of the country and coming back into the

16 country was in July of '97, not in '96, when she was 18.

17 And you see she's coming back through a city called

18 Dusseldorf in Germany, which is not Thailand, I understand

19 that. But then you remember I asked her mom, Weren't you in
20 Germany when she was in Thailand? And she said, Yes, I was.
21 So Annie flies back from Thailand to Germany, where her mother
22 is, and then they fly back together when she's a senior, not a
23 junior, in 1997, and not 1996. That's what the documents show.
24 And don't let the government tell you these records â€”-
25 I mean, the government is going to tell you that their own
