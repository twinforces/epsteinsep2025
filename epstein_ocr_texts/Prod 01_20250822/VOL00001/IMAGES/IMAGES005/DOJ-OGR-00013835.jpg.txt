13 that statute was met, the defendant is also charged under an

14 aiding and abetting theory. And there can be no serious

15 argument that Jeffrey Epstein didn't entice, persuade, induce,
16 and coerce Jane to travel to New York. And given that fact,

17 it's quite obvious that the defendant was aware of that plan,
18 given that she was on the plane and in the room in New York

19 when the abuse was happening. And she took steps over multiple
20 years to knowingly associate herself with it and to facilitate
21 it. So that, again, is a separate theory by which the statute

24 I'm sure your Honor is already aware, the standard here is
25 remarkably low. All that is required is that taking all
