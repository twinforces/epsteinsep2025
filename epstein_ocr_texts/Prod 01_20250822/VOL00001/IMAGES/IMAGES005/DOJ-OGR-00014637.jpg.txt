LCKCmax9 Charge

1 outcome of this case and any bias or prejudice of any such

2 witness, and this is true regardless of who called or

3 questioned the witness.

4 Finally, as you know, I have permitted certain

5 witnesses to be referred to in open court either by their first
6 name or a pseudonym. As I explained to you in my preliminary

7 instructions before opening statements, this process is to

8 protect the privacy of witnesses as this case has received

9 significant attention in the media. I instruct you again that
10 this process should not bear in any way on your evaluation of
11 the evidence or credibility of any witness in this case.

12 Instruction No. 45: Credibility of Witnesses â€”

13 Impeachment by Prior Inconsistent Statement.

14 You have heard evidence that a witness made a

15 statement on an earlier occasion which counsel argues is

16 inconsistent with the witness's trial testimony. Evidence of a
17 prior inconsistent statement is not to be considered by you as
18 affirmative evidence bearing on Ms. Maxwell's guilt. Evidence
19 of the prior inconsistent statement was placed before you for
20 the more limited purpose of helping you decide whether to
21 believe the trial testimony of the witness who contradicted him
22 or herself. If you find that the witness made an earlier
23 statement that conflicts with his or her trial testimony, you
24 may consider that fact in deciding how much of the trial
25 testimony, if any, to believe.
