LCKCmax3 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 for abuse after she had already visited Epstein in New York,

2 how the defendant asked Carolyn to travel, too. This went on

3 for years.

4 Count Five is the sex trafficking conspiracy count

5 which spans from 2000 to 2004, and this count relates to

8 steps to traffic girls for sex, recruiting Virginia Roberts at
9 Mar-a-Lago, transporting Virginia to other states with Epstein,
10 sending Carolyn up to the Palm Beach massage room on her first
11 visit, calling Carolyn for massage appointments in Florida so
12 that she could engage in commercial sex acts. The defendant

13 took so many steps in furtherance of the conspiracies charged
14 in the indictment, the evidence about that was overwhelming, it
15 went on for years.

16 But let me say this, because it's very important. For
17 each of the conspiracy counts, to find the defendant guilty,

18 you only have to find that she did it once, that there existed
19 one moment in time in all of those years where she agreed to do
20 this, and that Maxwell or Epstein took some step to carry out
21 the agreement. That's it. If you find that one moment
22 happened, the defendant is guilty.
23 Let me say one last thing about the law. For each of
24 the counts, I expect Judge Nathan will instruct you about
25 something called venue. We're required to prove that it's more
