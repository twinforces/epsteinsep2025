LC3Cmax7 Parkinson - cross

1 the house looked like in 1995, '96, or '97; correct?

2 A. I have no way of knowing that.

3 Q. I understand. Exactly right. It seems like an obvious

4 question. I'm just simply saying that the video shows a

5 certain date, October 20th, 2005. It wouldn't show what the

6 house looked like 10, 15 years, 20 years beforehand; correct?

7 A. I'd only have to guess on that. That was the only time I

8 was in the house up to that date in 2003 or 2005. The second

9 time I was in it. Other than that, it's hard to compare
10 because you're only in three rooms, one of which is a kitchen.
11 On the first working the case, that was in 2003 as opposed to
12 2005, which was totally new to me, except for the kitchen, the
13 office, and the garden room.
14 Q. Correct. I think we understand each other perfect.
15 Now, we saw in the video and in the photographs that
16 there were a number of framed photos around the house; is that
17 right?
18 A. True.
19 Q. But the video and the photographs of those photos don't
20 show how long any of those particular photos were in those
21 locations in the house; right?
22 A. I don't know how we'd determine that.
23 Q. Well, I think you'd agree with me that the video shows that
24 they were there on October 20th, 2005; right?
25 A. I will agree with that.
