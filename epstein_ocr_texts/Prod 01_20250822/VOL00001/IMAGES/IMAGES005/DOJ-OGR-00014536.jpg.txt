LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 document because it's got her name in the metadata. Please.

2 They've got a list of massage oils. Ghislaine Maxwell
3 wasn't in town when that list of massage oils was created.

4 They've got a household manual that wasn't on Ghislaine

S Maxwell's computer, by the way. No one's explained where that
6 thing came from, but it's dated in 2005. There's an email

7 between Ghislaine Maxwell and another woman talking about the

8 household manual and also about what a terrible job Juan Alessi
9 was doing. That's the one email off of those hundreds of hard
10 drives you saw and the pictures, one email the government

11 brought you for a ten-year conspiracy, complaining about Juan
12 Alessi's job performance. What a smoking gun.

13 The Palm Beach detectives came and they told you about
14 their walk-through at the Palm Beach house, the one that showed
15 the massage room, which was really the master bedroom â€”-

16 bathroom, excuse me. There is no creepy animals that she

17 talked about or orgy paintings on the wall. They brought you
18 the massage table which proved nothing to you.

19 They showed you that photo up close of the girl with
20 her pants being pulled down that was on the wall. Go back and
21 compare that with the other photos. That's the same girl that
22 Eva Dubin identified as her daughter in the other photos in the
23 house, okay. This isn't child pornography. This is a photo
24 that was given to Jeffrey Epstein by Eva Dubin of his
25 goddaughter. Photo doesn't prove anything.
