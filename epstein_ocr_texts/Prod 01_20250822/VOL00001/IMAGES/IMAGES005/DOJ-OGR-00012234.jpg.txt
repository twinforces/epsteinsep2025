1 MS. MOE: If I ask him about that, I do expect he

2 would say, yes, other girls. And so I think unless it's a

3 leading question, I just want to front that in order to avoid

4 creating an issue there.

a) THE COURT: Yes. Well, lead, and that way I don't

7 statement.

8 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. If the Court authorizes us
9 to lead, I think we can navigate through this area.

10 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim, okay if she leads through
11 this portion?

12 MS. STERNHEIM: I have no problem with that, Judge,

13 but if the witness on his own sua sponte says girls, I will be
14 objecting to that. I cannot rely on what they are going to do
15 or not do in closing.

16 THE COURT: I agree with that. That's why I said -—-

18 THE COURT: -- I will let Ms. Moe lead so I don't have
19 to strike that testimony. I think we are in agreement that if
20 he were to testify that she told her that there were girls, the
21 implication would be underage; that imolication wouldn't be a
22 prior consistent statement, and so I wouldn't allow that
23 implication to stay with the jury.
24 MS. STERNHEIM: IT understand, and I thank you for
25 that. But the other part would be there was no testimony on
