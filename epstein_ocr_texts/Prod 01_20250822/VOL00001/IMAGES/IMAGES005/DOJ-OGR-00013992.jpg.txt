LEGCmax 4: Loftus - direct

A. Th, some Of the experiments, yes. So, for @xdmple, in the
study that I've testified about already, we show people a
simulated accident, so we know exactly what the event was, we
know what they saw and that way we can. see how the post-event
information changes what they remember.

Q. And in contrasting that, which you. just said you could see,
that would be different than sSomébody who just reports a memory
with no visual preof er decumentation of it; correct?

A. Yes, then ‘you don't have a record of what actually
happened.,,

QO. And somebody who might réport. a memory tay give very vivid
detail; conrect?

A; Yes.

Q. And, does the fact ‘that someone reports a imemory with vivid
detail mtiean that the memory is accurate?

A. No, because of false memories. Once they're constructed in
somebody's mind, either by external suggéstion or by
autesuggestion, could be very vivid, detailed. People can, be
confident. about then, people Gah be ésmotidnal about them, even
though they're false.

QO. S6 if somebody believes that they had ah experience dnd

describes. that experience, there 1s no way of proving that that

actually 6écurred?
