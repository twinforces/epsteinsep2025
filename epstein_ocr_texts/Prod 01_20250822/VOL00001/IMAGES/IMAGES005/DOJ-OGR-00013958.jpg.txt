1 Travel?

2 A. Yes, Sir.

3 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, at this time the defense

4 offers what's been marked as RS-1 for identification.

5 MS. MOE: Your Honor, no objection, provided it's

6 received under seal.

7 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, I should say that there are

8 personally identifying information of third parties, so we ask
9 for it to be received temporarily under seal so we can apply

10 appropriate redactions.

11 THE COURT: All right. RS-1 is admitted temporarily
12 under seal. And you can propose narrowed redactions as

13 necessary.

20 With the Court's permission, I'll publish this to the
21 jury.

23 MS. MOE: No objection, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: Okay. The jury may open the folder and
