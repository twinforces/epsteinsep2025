3 Ms. Moe.

4 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.

5) THE COURT: Mr. Everdell.

6 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine, your Honor. Thank you.

7 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

8 I will write that note and send it back. We'll

9 mark -- I'm sorry, I forget what court exhibit we're on, but

10 we'll mark this note as the next court exhibit once

11 Ms. Williams reminds me where we are.

12 All right. Thank you.

13 Yes Â«

14 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I just have a quick statement,
15 and I'm asking the Court's assistance.

16 You mentioned on Friday that -- I guess it was

17 Wednesday that we're supposed to wear N95 masks in the

18 courtroom -- or in the courthouse, I should say.

19 THE COURT: Yes.
20 MS. STERNHEIM: And it's my understanding that one has
21 been provided for Ms. Maxwell, but she can only wear it in the
22 courtroom. And I think that that is not a correct health
23 standard.
24 THE COURT: The rule actually is in the courthouse.
25 MS. STERNHEIM: In the courthouse.
