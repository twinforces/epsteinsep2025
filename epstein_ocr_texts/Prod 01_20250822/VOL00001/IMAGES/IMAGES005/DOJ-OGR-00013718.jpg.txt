LCACmax5 A. Farmer â€” cross

1 Again, I'm happy to take it up as it comes, but I just
2 wanted to flag that for the Court.

3 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I most definitely did not
4 ask her about hindsight bias. I asked her about her

a impressions of situations factually in hindsight. Even when we
6 litigated expert issues around hindsight bias, there was a

7 clear distinction made between what is obvious to a lay juror

8 as seeing things in hindsight versus currently. I did not use
9 any of the expert language associated with hindsight bias. So
10 I disagree with any characterization that that was somehow

11 related to an opinion under 702.

12 THE COURT: All right. Are there further questions in
13 that regard?

14 MS. MENNINGER: There are not.

15 THE COURT: Okay. Ms. Pomerantz.

16 MS. POMERANTZ: That's fine. Thank you, your Honor.
17 THE COURT: Anything else to take up?

18 MS. POMERANTZ: Not from the government. Thank you.
19 MS. MENNINGER: Not from the defense. Thank you.
20 THE COURT: We can bring the witness back, please.
21 (Witness present)
22 You may take your seat and you're welcome to remove
23 your mask, please. Thank you.
24 We can bring the jury back in.
