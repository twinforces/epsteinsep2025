LC7Cmax4 Carolyn - cross

1 (Jury not present)

2 THE COURT: The witness may step down and break for

3 lunch.

4 (Witness excused)

S Everyone may be seated. Okay, matters to take up

6 before the break?

7 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. During the morning break,
8 we had an opportunity to speak with the witness identified as

9 Brian. I've provided a copy of the notes from that

10 conversation to defense counsel when we came back from the

11 break along with a text message that Brian provided us a copy
12 with. I'm happy to -- we haven't had a chance to stamp them

13 yet with 3500 numbers, but I'm happy to provide a copy to the
14 Court.

15 THE COURT: Okay.

16 MS. MOE: Besides that, is there a particular time

17 when the Court would like to take up that particular issue and
18 the other issue that we addressed at sidebar?

19 THE COURT: Let's discuss this now since that goes to
20 the defense's at least prior request was the exclusion of his
21 testimony. So I'll hear from you on that, if you're prepared
22 to be heard from that now or we break and then I hear from you.
23 MS. MOE: Your Honor, we'd be happy to take this up
24 after the break, perhaps in order to provide defense counsel an
25 opportunity to review those further and to confer on this
