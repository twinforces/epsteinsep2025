1 Your Honor, with respect to any testimony that was in
2 the November 26 disclosure, which I believe is not what was

3 disclosed earlier in September, but most of it is what I would
4 agree is factual testimony. If a document has metadata, any

a old person can right-click on it, look at the properties, and

6 read what those properties are.

9 the second page of the November 26 disclosure where Mr. Flatley
10 will testify that he verified the accuracy of metadata by

11 running a particular program. He will explain what metadata

12 is, such as the file name and when the file was created, and

13 where it can be stored in a computer system.

14 Your Honor, if those are the only things that

15 Mr. Flatley intends to testify about, then I think we're fine.
16 It's the things that came in the disclosures on November â€”--

17 there were more on November 26 that were not in this letter and
18 there were things on December 3rd that were disclosed. If he
19 is limited to those things that were put in the September 26
20 disclosure, I'm fine with that, your Honor.
21 He also was not ever disclosed as a fact or expert
22 witness with regard to CDs. The original notice and the
23 supplemental notice all refer to his review of devices. So I
24 believe that the government does not intend to put on evidence
25 about CDs through him, but those are the two areas that I think
