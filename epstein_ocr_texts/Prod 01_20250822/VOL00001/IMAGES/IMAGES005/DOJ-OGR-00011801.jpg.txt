LBUVMAX2 Visoski - direct

1 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, the government offers this in
2 evidence.

3 MR. EVERDELL: No objection.

4 THE COURT: GX-326 is admitted. You may publish.

5 (Government's Exhibit 326 received in evidence)

6 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.

7 Q. And while Ms. Drescher puts this up for the jury,

8 Mr. Visoski, would you please tell us what we see in this

9 photograph.

10 A. As far as describing the home or the property?

11 Q. Yes. Could you tell us what we see in the top right-hand
12 corner first and then tell us what we're seeing on the

13 property.

14 A. Oh, gotcha.

15 The top right-hand corner was the boat dock, iff you

16 were to arrive by boat. So that was the entrance for guests to
17 arrive by boat. And then if you continued down the highway

18 there, you can't see the helipad, the helipad is still south of
19 that structure. Once you were there, you could take -- you
20 would walk up to the main house up on the top of the hill.
21 Q. Thank you.
22 MS. COMEY: We can take that down.
23 And now, Ms. Drescher, can you please pull up
24 Government Exhibit 703 for the witness, the Court, and the
25 parties.
