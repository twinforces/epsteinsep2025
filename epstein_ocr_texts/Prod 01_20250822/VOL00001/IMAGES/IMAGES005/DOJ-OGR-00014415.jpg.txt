LCKVMAX2 Summations â€”- Ms. Moe

1 else does the household manual tell you? You remember the

2 disturbing warning in that manual. Here it is: Remember that
3 you see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a
4 question directed at you. Respect their privacy.

5 You learned that this powerful warning to employees

6 was effective. Here's Mr. Alessi's testimony about that. He

7 explained that this rule was a kind of warning that he was

8 supposed to be blind, deaf, and dumb, to say nothing of their

9 lives.

10 Ladies and gentlemen, now that you've sat through this
11 entire trial, you know exactly why Maxwell told workers in the
12 house to see nothing, hear nothing, and say nothing. It's

13 because she was Epstein's partner in crime. And in that house,
14 behind closed doors, Maxwell and Epstein were committing

15 horrifying crimes.

16 That brings us to the second reason. The second

17 reason that you know that Maxwell is guilty is that she ran the
18 same playbook over and over and over again as she exploited

19 young girls. The similarities between what happened to Jane
20 and Annie and Carolyn and Kate are incredibly powerful evidence
21 of the defendant's guilt. So I want to talk to you about the
22 playbook that Maxwell ran again and again and again.
23 Before we talk about this, remember that you heard
24 from Dr. Rocchio, an expert psychologist who specializes in
25 treating victims of sexual abuse for the trauma they suffered
