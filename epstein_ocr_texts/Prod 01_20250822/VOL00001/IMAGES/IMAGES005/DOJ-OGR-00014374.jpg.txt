1 defendant traveling with some of the minor victims. I assume

2 the defendant is going to say that she didn't know the purposes
3 of the trips. To the extent the purpose was sexual abuse, the
4 government would argue that at a minimum this she did know, if
5 she didn't she consciously avoided knowing, why Jeffrey Epstein
6 was traveling repeatedly with these minors.

7 THE COURT: The other point is, from the openings, I

8 don't know if it will be a theme of the closing, but the

) distancing of Ms. Maxwell from Mr. Epstein and what he did was
10 clearly a theme of the opening, and so that implicates

11 knowledge throughout the counts.

12 So my strong inclination is that it's appropriate

13 here. That's my conclusion. That's my conclusion. I'm going
14 to look back through relevant portions of testimony on the age
15 issue, but I think even the age issue -- well, not the age

16 issue. Knowledge of age. Specific arguments as to knowledge
17 of age aside, knowledge of age is intertwined with arguments

18 regarding age. And in any event, there are, as a result of the
19 opening, questions about Ms. Maxwell's knowledge of what
20 Mr. Epstein is alleged to have been doing that I think it's
21 sort of a standard instance of the applicability of a conscious
22 avoidance instruction.
23 So my conclusion is to include it.
24 Next.
25 MR. EVERDELL: Next, your Honor —-— let me make sure.
