LC9VMAXT.

THE COURT: Right. Tt's a stredmlinéd vérstion of the

closing argument. And again, I'm mot aware -— I'm not aware --
cértainly seén, summary with ‘investigative officers. That's not

this. And I've seen officers who are analyzing complicated

data undér 1006 provide that to the jury. That's not. this.

And. L've seen, when the evidence comes in, the government. spend
a fatir amount of time -- as you've done with some exhibits --
going threugh piece by piece in order to highlight and draw
cértain connections.

I'm not going to let you. do it through a witness. who
has no personal experience, I think you do it in closing.
That."s what this is, it's closing argument.

MS. MOE: Understood, your Hénor.

THE COURT: Okay. What else?

MR. PAGLIUCA: TI think the only 6pen issue that I'm
aware of, ‘your Honor, is the Exhibit 52 issue.

THE GOURT: Yes. I got the briefing at 9:45, so 15
minutes early finished, I, appreciate it. And I am still
d6tting my i's and crossing my t's. I think we d6én't. neéd it,
tall the government is prepared, to rest; 1s that, right?

MS. GCOMEY: That.'s cérreéét,; your Hon6ér.

THE COURT: You agree with that?

MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Hon6ér.

THE COURT: Anything else to take up now?

MR.. PAGLIUCA: Not from the defense; your Honor.
