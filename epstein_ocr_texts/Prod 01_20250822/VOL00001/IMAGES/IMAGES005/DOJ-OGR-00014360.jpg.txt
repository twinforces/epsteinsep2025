LCI1MAX1

1 conspiracy to violate the offense with the age of consent of

2 17, even though elsewhere Carolyn is charged with an age of

3 consent of 18.

4 THE COURT: I presume you have no objection?

5 MR. EVERDELL: No objection, your Honor.

6 THE COURT: Yes. Let me just think about that.

7 I see. Okay. All right. So Instruction 36, line 21,
8 changing "Carolyn was under the age of 18" to "the age of 17."
9 Yeah, that's right.

10 Okay. Next.

11 MR. EVERDELL: Next one, lines, on that page, 23 to
12 24, and on the following page, lines 1 through 10, it tracks

13 the same changes for the transportation charge.

14 MR. ROHRBACH: That makes sense, I think, your Honor.
15 THE COURT: Okay. Let me see if I can do these.

16 Line 24, changing "age of 18" to "age of 17," and then line 2,
17 changing "age of 18" to 17. Line 4, cutting the clause "when
18 Annie was under the age of 18," and then cutting overt act

19 regarding Kate at No. 4. So that's lines 6 through 8. And
20 then line 19, changing 18 to 17.
21 MR. EVERDELL: Correct, your Honor.
22 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, you would also want to change
23 the bracketed No. 5 to No. 4.
24 THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Sternheim. Changing the
25 fifth listed overt act to the fourth listed overt act. Just
