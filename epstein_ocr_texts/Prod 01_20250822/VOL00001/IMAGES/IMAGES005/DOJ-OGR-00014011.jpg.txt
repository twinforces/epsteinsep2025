LEGCmax4 Loftus - direct

MR. ROHRBACH: Tt's the Same 401. question, although

this one is even more attenuated from any motion of bias or
motive since it says nothing about her incentives, or why she is
testifying. She could be testifying for literally or
cooperating with the government for litterally any reason ard
make the same’ statement. It sheds no Light on. her motives or
biases.

MS, STERNHEIM: It sheds. light on her knowledge that.
she knows, what thé othér accusers, dré doing.

MR, ROHRBACH: That is not a motive or bias objection.

THE COURT: I think that's raght. I'm inclined to
sustain on, that one on, the 401 ground. Okay.

So IT think we're limited to the first quéstidn. So
you'll work out --

MR. ROHRBACH: We've been conferring and will work out
a way for Mr. Hamilton, to testify on that point.

THE GOURT: All right. We can bring ih the jury?

MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing else from ‘the government,.

THE COURT: Ms. Sterrheim.

MS. STERNHEIM: Ready to proceed.

THE GOURT: We'll get the witness and Ms. Williams
will get the jury.

You may take off your mask. Thank you.
