LC8VMAX6 Rodgers â€”- cross
1 Q. All right.
2 And there were also times too when the plane and the
3 passengers had to clear customs, and the pilots and the
4 passengers had to exit the plane, right?
5) A. That's correct.
6 Q. That would happen on international flights, for example?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. It would also happen when you're leaving St. Thomas too,
9 right?
10 A. Yes, when we -- it would depend. If we were pre-clearing
11 customs at St. Thomas, yes, we would taxi over to the customs
12 area, have to take everything off the airplane and clear
13 customs there.
14 Q. Because even though that's the U.S. Virgin Islands, it's
15 part of the United States, there is a customs clearance you
16 have to do when departing St. Thomas, right?
17 A. That's correct. You could pre-clear. And then if you
18 pre-clear there, we don't have to see customs wherever we're
19 going. However, if we don't pre-clear there, then we have to
20 see customs when we land in the United States.
21 Q. Fair enough.
22 But I guess my point is at any time when you're
23 clearing customs and you've exited the plane with the
24 passengers, you have the chance to see them there too?
25 A. Oh, sure.
