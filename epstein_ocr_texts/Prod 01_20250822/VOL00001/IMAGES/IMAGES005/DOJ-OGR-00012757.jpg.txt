1 THE COURT: I think what makes sense is she comes in,
2 she's sworn before any questions on direct, I give the

3 instruction, and then the direct testimony begins.

4 Next issue is the 900 series. The government seeks to
a admit photographs of the interior of Jeffrey Epstein's New York
6 apartment taken in 2019. The government claims that the photos
7 are probative of how Epstein's apartment apoeared when Jane,

8 who previously testified, saw it as early as 1994 and therefore
9 corroborates her testimony. Trial transcript at 1075 to 76.

10 The defense objected to the photos' admission. I sustained the
11 objection based on the current record. Trial transcript at

12 1077.

13 I noted that while, quote, older photographs of

14 immoveable objects and structures may be relevant, end quote,
15 photos of, quote, very moveable objects, end quote, are not

16 relevant unless, quote, there is a witness, end quote, that

17 confirms the photos are similar to how the objects appeared

18 years earlier. Trial transcript at 1076 to 77.

19 With the leave of Court, the government filed a letter
20 on December 4th, 2021, requesting admission of at least a
21 subset of the photographs. The defense filed a response on
22 December 5th.
23 I must determine the probative value of the photos and
24 then determine if that relevance is substantially outweighed by
25 unfair prejudice. A photograph of the scene may be relevant
