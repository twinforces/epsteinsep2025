1 THE COURT: Sorry. 18, Count Five.

2 All right. So we'll make that change.

3 MR. ROHRBACH: The government has just one edit, if

4 Mr. Everdell is finished on the other.

S MR. EVERDELL: Which one?

6 MR. ROHRBACH: Which is on the top of the verdict

7 sheet. After "please indicate your verdict with a checkmark,"
8 it's a "T" in parentheses.

9 THE COURT: That's so odd. Yes. We'll convert that
10 to a checkmark.

11 OK. That's it from the verdict sheet?

12 MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing from the government.

13 MR. EVERDELL: Nothing from the defense, your Honor.
14 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I have something unrelated to
15 the charge in the verdict sheet.

16 THE COURT: All right. Give me one moment just to go
17 through my to do list. So I have two open issues that I'll

18 hear from the government by letter by 2. Once I have that,

19 T'll make my conclusions with respect to those. We'll send the
20 parties a redline version of the changes made and a clean
21 version, which will be the final version, unless -- I'll set a
22 time when I send it to you, by a certain time. You indicate
23 any errors that were implemented in the implementation of the
24 changes. Otherwise that will be final. Same for the verdict
25 sheet.
