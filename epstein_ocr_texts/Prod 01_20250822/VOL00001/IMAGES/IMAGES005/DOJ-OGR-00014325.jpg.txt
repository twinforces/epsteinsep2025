1 the conspiracy counts come later, I think there is an attempt

2 here to generalize the wording of the elements because it's

5 says first that the defendant knowingly persuaded or induced or
6 enticed or coerced an individual to travel in interstate

23 be included in the recitation of the elements. I think the
24 defense is getting that because it's in the "to wit" clause of
25 the indictment, and the law is quite clear -- and I have
