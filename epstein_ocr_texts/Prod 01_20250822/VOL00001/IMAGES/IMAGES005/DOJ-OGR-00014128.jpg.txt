1 explain or deny it.

2 Next at issue is the first step of whether the

3 witness's testimony and the prior statement are inconsistent.

4 I provide the following guidance before we turn to the

5 specifics.

6 First, if the statement was presented to the witness

7 and the witness admitted to making the statement, then

8 extrinsic evidence is inappropriate, and the parties apparently
9 agree on this point in their last two letters as do circuit

10 courts who have decided the issue. That's true for the Fifth
11 Circuit, Sixth Circuit, and Tenth Circuit.

12 Second, the prior inconsistent statement must actually
13 be the witness's statement to show an inconsistency. United

14 States v. Almonte, 956 F.2d 27, (2d Cir. 1992).

15 Where the defense relies on a third party's

16 characterization of the witness's words rather than a verbatim
17 transcript, then the witness must have subscribed to that

18 characterization. On that basis, notes taken in law

19 enforcement interviews will generally not prove an
20 inconsistency for purposes of rule 613(b). See, for example,
21 United States v. Leonardi, 623 F.2d 746, the Gulani case and
22 others.
23 Of course, that infirmity is solved by calling the
24 interviewing officer as a witness or to avoid calling another
25 witness, the government stipulates to the accuracy of the
