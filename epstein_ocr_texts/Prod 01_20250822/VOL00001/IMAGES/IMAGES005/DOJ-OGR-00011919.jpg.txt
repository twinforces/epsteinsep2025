LBUVMAX4 Visoski - cross

1 Q. Now, Epstein bought his first helicopter, your recollection
2 was, sometime around 1990, 2000; is that right?

3 A. Yeah, '99 to 2000; correct. Yes.

4 Q. So sometime, I believe, in the early 2000s, Ghislaine went
5 to school to become a trained helicopter pilot; is that right?
6 A. Yes, she did.

7 Q. That school was in Pompano Beach, Florida?

8 A. That's correct.

9 Q. Pompano Beach is about an hour or so drive south of Palm
10 Beach, right?
11 A. Yeah, give or take traffic. It could be longer some days;
12 but, yes, it's approximately an hour from Palm Beach to
13 Pompano.
14 Q. And the training sessions that she was taking were about
15 one to three times per week, right?
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. Each training session lasted about three to four hours,
18 isn't that right?
19 A. Yes, if not longer. Because there's a lot of preparation
20 before you fly, and you're flying for an hour and a half, and
21 then you're still talking about it afterwards, you know, with
22 your instructor, and then your drive home. So it could be a
23 long duration.
24 Q. Right. So each training session was basically a full-day
25 event, wasn't it?
