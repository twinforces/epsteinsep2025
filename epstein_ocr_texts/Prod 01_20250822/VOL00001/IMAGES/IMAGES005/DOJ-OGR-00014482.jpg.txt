LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 We are not here to defend Jeffrey Epstein, he is not

2 my client. The government played you a montage of Epstein's

i) houses, his bank accounts, his artwork, his cars, his planes,

4 his helicopters, his bank accounts, his message pads, just like
5 a sensationalist tabloid would. His private island, his

12 Ghislaine was there, she must have known. They said, let me

13 show you a bunch of photos of them together, undated photos

14 from unknown times with unknown hairstyles. You've seen them

16 jury, you heard that the government seized somewhere near

17 38,000 photographs, and they brought you a handful of Jeffrey
18 Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell together. Where are the other

19 37,960 photographs? Who were in those photographs? Was it
20 other girlfriends? Was it other women? Who was it? You don't
21 know. They didn't bring you those photos.
22 You saw in the drawers, where these photos were kept,
23 the binders. You saw the discs where they were kept. And they
24 brought you the most innocuous photos of a couple that once was
25 together, and they didn't even tell you when. This is proof of
