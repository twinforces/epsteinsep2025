1 A. I would say -- I really don't recall, but I do recall being

4 Q. Okay. So your recollection is that there was a move to a

12 Q. Do you recall how long Mr. Epstein was living in the rental
13 address while the renovations were going on at El Brillo Way?
14 A. I don't remember, but it was certainly months. I don't

15 know if it was years, but I think it was certainly months.

16 Q. Could it have been as much as a year?

17 A. It's possible, it could have been a year.

18 QO. So if it's '94, that could have been 1994 into 1995 that he
19 was in this rental residence?
20 A. That's possible.
al Q. Now, just to move to the residence in New Mexico, your
22 recollection was that he bought that rental residence -- I'm
23 sorry. That residence in New Mexico in I think the mid 1990s;
24 is that right?
25 A. Yes. I want to say the closing, if I remember correctly,
