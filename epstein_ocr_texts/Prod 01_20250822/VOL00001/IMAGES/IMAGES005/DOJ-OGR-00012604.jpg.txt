9 Q. Mr. Alessi, you got numbers for massage therapists to call
10 for Mr. Epstein; isn't that correct?

11 A. Yes, I had a list of massage therapists, repeat massage

12 therapists, and I never call anybody with that -- they told me
13 who to call. I never made a call suggesting to get a massage
14 therapist to come to the house, never.

15 MR. PAGLIUCA: May I, your Honor, from line 24 --

20 THE COURT: T'll allow it.
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Thank you.
