LC2Qmax3 Rocchio - Cross

1 A. Could you clarify? I'm not really sure what you're asking.
2 Q. Sure. For example if somebody has a traumatic brain

3 injury, it may be difficult for someone as a matter of

4 physiology to retrieve a memory?

5 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection, your Honor.

6 THE COURT: Sustained.

7 Q. There are other factors that relate to the ability of

8 someone to accurately disclose a piece of information about any
9 alleged abuse, correct?
10 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection, your Honor.
11 THE COURT: Sustained.
12 Q. Would you agree with me, Dr. Rocchio, that, for example,
13 alcohol consumption can impact the disclosure of an event?
14 A. I guess it would depend on the context. That question is
15 so broad, I'm not really sure how to answer it.
16 Q. If someone is consuming alcohol or controlled substances,
17 they may not have a very good recall of a particular event,
18 COLLEGE ?
19 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: Sustained.
al Q. Are you familiar with the concept of confabulation,
22 Dr. Rocchio?
23 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection.
24 THE COURT: Overruled.
25 A. I am.
