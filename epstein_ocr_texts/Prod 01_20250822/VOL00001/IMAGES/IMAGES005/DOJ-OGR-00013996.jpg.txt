LCGCmax4 Loftus â€” direct

1 (Jury not present)

2 THE COURT: The witness may step down and out for the
3 break. Thank you.

4 Everyone may be seated. Are there matters to take up
S before the break or just after the break?

6 MS. POMERANTZ: Not from the government.

7 MS. STERNHEIM: Not at this time, Judge.

8 THE COURT: Okay. You could step out, thank you.

9 THE WITNESS: Okay.

10 (Witness excused)

11 THE COURT: I just want to make sure we have clarity
12 on what needs to be resolved following the break.

13 On the prior inconsistent statements, I'm going to

14 spend my lunch looking through them, but I'm hoping there will
15 be consultation and stipulation in narrowing so that we can

16 really get down to where there is genuine disagreement after

17 you've had some discussion.

18 Is that everybody's understanding?

19 MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine with the government, your
20 Honor.
ZA MR. EVERDELL: We will try to confer, see if we can
22 narrow the issues.
23 THE COURT: Okay. I don't know when you need
24 resolution of the un-narrowed issue, but my understanding is we
25 might hit that point today.
