1 That's why these exhibits are relevant, your Honor.

2 THE COURT: The photos are from 2019.

3 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor.

4 THE COURT: I'll look at the testimony during break,
5 but I'm not sure why, again, given the Court's earlier ruling,
6 they wouldn't have been linked up with the witness, but I'll

7 look at the testimony.

8 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I would just add that the
9 testimony I believe from Kate was that the schoolgirl outfit
10 was in Palm Beach. These were found in New York 15 years

11 later. So there is an issue there, as well.

12 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. I think regardless of

13 location, the issue is whether Jeffrey Epstein had a sexual

14 preference for schoolgirls, and this exhibit speaks --

15 THE COURT: Not in 2019.

16 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: That's the not question; right?

18 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor, but we would respectfully
19 submit if the defense wants to argue that he developed his
20 interest for schoolgirls after the timeframe of the charged
21 conspiracy --
22 THE COURT: They don't have to argue anything until
23 you establish relevance. So that's the primary question.
24 These are photos of the uniforms found in Palm Beach in 2019
25 and I just don't know, as I sit here, if these photos link up
