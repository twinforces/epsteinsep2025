1 I'm allowing to testify under pseudonyms and third parties

2 whose privacy interests are an issue could be redacted.

3 T'll let you tell me a timing for that, but we've got
4 to be narrowly tailored, so --

5) MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. For the photographs, we
6 could do that more quickly. The video will require assistance
7 from our IT staff who have left for the weekend.

8 THE COURT: Lucky them.

9 MS. COMEY: Indeed.

10 So I would ask for by the end of the day on Tuesday
11 for the videos so that they have time.

12 And then for the photographs, we should be able to do
13 that by the end of the weekend, so on Sunday.

14 THE COURT: Okay.

15 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.

16 THE COURT: I appreciate that.

17 And you'll confer also; I know some came in that may
18 not need to be redacted. You'll just confer and --

19 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: -- get as much to the public as you can.
21 MR. EVERDELL: We will, your Honor.
22 THE COURT: Thank you.
23 Other matters to take up? Let me just check if I'm
24 forgetting anything.
25 I don't think so. Anything?
