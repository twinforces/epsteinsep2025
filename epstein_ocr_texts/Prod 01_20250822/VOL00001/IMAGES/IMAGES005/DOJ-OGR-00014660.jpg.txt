1 (Trial resumed; jury not present)

2 THE COURT: We have a note.

3 This will be marked as Court Exhibit 6.

4 We would like the transcripts testimony of Jane,

5 Annie, and Carolyn.

6 Do you have those prepared, counsel?

7 MS. COMEY: I believe both sides had proposed

8 redactions. We just need to compare them and then they'll be
9 ready to send back; so it should be pretty quick, your Honor.
10 THE COURT: Okay. So my proposal is you come to

11 agreement on that, give Ms. Williams what you agree to. She
12 will give it to the CSO to bring them back without bringing

13 them to the court.

14 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, are you going to inform them
15 that we just need a few minutes? I don't want them to think
16 that it's coming right now. We need like five or ten minutes.
17 THE COURT: I can send a note saying we're preparing
18 the transcripts; they'll be in shortly.

19 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.
20 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.
21 (Recess pending verdict)
22 THE COURT: I have a note which I'll mark as Court
23 Exhibit 7.
24 We would like the FBI deposition, 3505-005, referred
25 to by the defense during the cross-examination of Carolyn.
