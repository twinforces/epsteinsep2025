LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 Customs and Border Patrol records are not accurate.

2 Okay. Well, that's kind of silly.

3 But if you look at Jane's records that come in the

4 same exhibit number, you'll see that they go back to January of
a "96. So the records go back that far. There just isn't a

6 record of Annie going to Thailand in 1996. And so the

7 government didn't bring you the Customs and Border Patrol

8 records.

9 And finally, I want to consider one other piece about
10 Annie's story. She's saying that she wore -- she was bought

11 these boots by the people who sexually abused her; Epstein

12 bought her these boots. And she said that she kept them in the
13 closet, and then the government didn't ask for them in 2006,

14 excuse me. And you'll have the boots with you back in the jury
15 room, and you can see for yourselves how worn those boots are.
16 And so when the government finally got those boots in
17 June of 2021, even though they'd met with her repeatedly, and
18 she never told them anything about wearing these boots, she

19 just said they bought her these boots, and then when they
20 finally got them and looked at them and saw that she's been
21 wearing boots from the people that she says sexually abused
22 her, she came up with a new story, and that story was that she
23 resided to reclaim the boots. And that's the story she told
24 for the first time right before trial and what she told you on
25 the stand.
