2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, this Amanda person was not
3 noticed under 404(b). We had two that were noticed. As I

4 recall, that's the Melissa and Virginia, and that's it.

S MS. MENNINGER: Not just 404(b).

6 Your Honor ordered that the government produce to us

7 the names of any victims that they intended to discuss at

8 trial. They gave the names of six individuals; the four that

9 we normally have been talking about, Ms. Roberts, and this last
10 one. But Amanda was not one of the names that they gave. So
11 if they intended to refer to her as a victim in this trial, the
12 deadline to do that was, I think, in September.

13 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, yesterday during her

14 testimony, Carolyn said that Amanda Lazlo was someone who she
15 brought with her. I asked how old Amanda was, and she said how
16 old she was. There was no objection.

17 MS. MENNINGER: She said 18.

18 MS. COMEY: This is corroborative -- I don't believe
19 she said 18. This is corroborative testimony. And I would
20 note —-
21 THE COURT: Well, the age distinction is an important
22 question. It's entirely not corroborative in identifying a new
23 victim if the testimony yesterday was 18.
24 MS. COMEY: And, your Honor, I would want to check the
25 transcript for this.
