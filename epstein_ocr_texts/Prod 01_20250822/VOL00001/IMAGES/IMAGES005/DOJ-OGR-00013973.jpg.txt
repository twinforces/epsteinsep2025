LEGVMAX3 Loftus - direct
to ‘them and, adopted it as, ‘their own mémory. And that. study was
published in 1978.
Q. Have you conducted any sttidies that have to do with
language and how language’ might affect memory?
A. Yes. An example of that would be -- again, this is also a
fairly widely cited study.

We showéd péople a simulated aécident. Afterwards, we
asked people about the speed of the vehicles involved in the

accident. But different Witnesses are questioned in different

ways. SO some witnesses are asked a question like, How fast

were the Gars going wheh they stiashed into each other? And
others are asked, How fast were the cans going when they hit

each other?

And we found that people estamated, the speed as
greater if you uséd the wo6rd “smiashed" than if you uséd the
word "hit." Also we had found that if we use ‘the smash word,

this leading kind of biased w6érd, it affected what other things

that, people remembered. Our witnesses were mone likely to
remember, for example, broken glass that didn't exist. if we had
used that word smashed in questioning them.

So that's an example of what. you're asking about, the

connection, between, language and, memory.

Q. In the course of your research and experience, are you
aware, of any experiments that, have actually measured emotion
and. its impact on memory?
