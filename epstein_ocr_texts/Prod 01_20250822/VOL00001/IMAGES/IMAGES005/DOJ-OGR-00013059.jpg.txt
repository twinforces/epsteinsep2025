1 REDIRECT EXAMINATION

2 BY MS. COMEY:

3 Q. Ms. Meder, you were mentioning some initials that you saw

4 on the black binders. Could you tell us what you saw?

5 MS. MENNINGER: Objection. It's hearsay, your Honor.
6 The labels on the binders are hearsay.

7 MS. COMEY: I'm just asking her about the initials

8 that were elicited during cross examination.

9 MS. MENNINGER: I did not elicit the hearsay, your

10 Honor. I elicited that there were initials and not what they
11 were, because she just testified she does not know whether

12 those initials are accurate.

13 THE COURT: Sustained.

14 BY MS. COMEY:

15 Q. You also mentioned that you saw dates on CDs. Could you

16 tell us what dates you remember seeing on the CDs you reviewed?
17 MS. MENNINGER: Same objection, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: Sustained.

19 MS. COMEY: No further questions.
20 THE COURT: Thank you. Nothing further, correct,
21 Ms. Menninger?
22 MS. MENNINGER: Not for this witness. Thank you.
23 THE COURT: Ms. Meder, you may step down. You are
24 excused.
25 (Witness excused)
