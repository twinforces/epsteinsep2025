1 THE COURT: All right. We have our jury.

2 Anything to raise before we bring them in?

3 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor.

4 MS. STERNHEIM: No, your Honor. Thank you.

5 THE COURT: Thank you.

6 Ms. Moe, you can take your place at the podium.

7 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

9 (Jury present)

10 THE COURT: Good morning, members of the jury. Thank
11 you so much for your timeliness. It's good to see everyone.

12 As I indicated, we are at the summation or closing

13 argument phase of the trial. Here's how we'll do the schedule:
14 The government, Ms. Moe, will present the closing

15 argument for the government. She's going to go through and

16 finish her argument. We'll then break early for lunch. It

17 will be a short lunch, and then we'll come back -- 20 to 30

18 minutes for the lunch break. We'll come back.

19 Ms. Menninger will present the closing argument on
20 behalf of the defense. We'll take a short break at that point.
21 We'll come back. Rebuttal closings by the government, and
22 instructions from me. So that's the schedule for the day, just
23 to give you a sense of where we are.
24 With that, I ask you to please give your full
25 attention to Ms. Moe on behalf of the government.
