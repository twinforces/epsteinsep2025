LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 Again, the government promised you relatives who were
2 going to come corroborate these stories. Where was Annie

3 Farmer's sister? Where were the people at the ranch? Where

4 was the chef? Where's the rest of her diaries?

S What you got was a photograph of the front and back of
6 a diary, and you got photographs of several of the pages from

7 the diary. What you didn't get was the rest of the diary. You
8 don't even get to take the diary back into the room with you.

9 And she told you that she had diaries from Thailand. Why

10 didn't she share those diaries? Why didn't she give this diary
11 to the government?

12 Also, Ms. Farmer is the one who explained a lot of the
13 intersection of these lawyers and the witnesses. She told you
14 she first met with the Boies Schiller firm when they were

15 representing Virginia Roberts, and she was going to be a

16 witness. And then she hired them. And she told you that Jane,
17 who told you she had talked to Kate's lawyers, Brad Edwards â€”-
18 and Brad Edwards was here in the courtroom when Kate was

19 testifying, Jane talked to him as well. And then Jack Scarola,
20 who represents Carolyn, and brought her to the government, he
21 also talked to the same other witnesses, and they all talked to
22 their family members and saw the media. That's the
23 contamination of memory that we were talking about.
24 Finally, with respect to Annie's story and the money
25 piece, she told the FBI that all of this was not sexualized
