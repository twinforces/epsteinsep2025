LC 7VMAX7 Carolyn - cross

1 first couple of incidents, which I think would be, as you're

2 suggesting, time frame inconsistent.

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: I think you admitted those already,

4 your Honor.

5 THE COURT: See? I'm consistent.

6 MR. PAGLIUCA: You are. Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
7 The Court admitted paragraph 21, I think, as the -- 21
8 and 27.

9 THE COURT: Okay.

10 MR. PAGLIUCA: And where we started getting --

11 THE COURT: 21 and 27. 27 is called incident two.

12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Right.

13 THE COURT: And then 33, I'm not saying an

14 inconsistency. I'll sustain there.

19 testified to; it's not specific as to which incident this is.
20 To the extent there's 401 relevance, it's cumulative of the
al point that you've already gotten in, which is that this -- that
22 the first incident described in this complaint took place in
23 2002, and her testimony is that it took place in 2001.
24 Next.
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: But also to that point, your Honor,
