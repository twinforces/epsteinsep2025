(At the sidebar)
THE COURT: Where is. this going?
MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I believe Agent Young will

testify about her experience conducting interviews and her

experience and training both before being dt the FBI and as an

FBI agent in practices of conducting non-suggestive interviews.

This is relevant’ both because 'the defense dskéd a number of

questions about hew they conduct interviews, so it's within the

scope of the diréct. And also, the defense elicited expert
testimony from Dr, Loftus about how suggestive questioning and
leading quéstioning can léad to implanted memories. And the
premise, the basis for admitting that. opinion in a, letter ‘that
was Submitted to your Honér just this week was that there was
going to be a suggestion by the defense that the agents who

cénductéd intérviews Here conducted them in a leading fashion:

So this 1s responsive directly to the premise of that expent.
testimony:
MS. MENNINGER: We were just precluded, from asking any

questions about ifvestigative techniques.

THE COURT: I mean, you want to open the door on how

interviews were cénducted of thesé witnesses, that opens the
deor. I think it's beyond the scope.
MS. MENNINGER: It is béyond the scope; your Honér.
MS. COMEY: I apologize, your Honor. I don*t
understand what your Honor means by open the door.
