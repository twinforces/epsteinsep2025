LCHCmax3 Young â€” cross

1 (At the sidebar)

2 THE COURT: Where is this going?

3 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I believe Agent Young will

4 testify about her experience conducting interviews and her

a experience and training both before being at the FBI and as an
6 FBI agent in practices of conducting non-suggestive interviews.
7 This is relevant both because the defense asked a number of

8 questions about how they conduct interviews, so it's within the
9 scope of the direct. And also, the defense elicited expert

10 testimony from Dr. Loftus about how suggestive questioning and
11 leading questioning can lead to implanted memories. And the

12 premise, the basis for admitting that opinion in a letter that
13 was submitted to your Honor just this week was that there was
14 going to be a suggestion by the defense that the agents who

15 conducted interviews here conducted them in a leading fashion.
16 So this is responsive directly to the premise of that expert

17 testimony.

18 MS. MENNINGER: We were just precluded from asking any
19 questions about investigative techniques.
20 THE COURT: I mean, you want to open the door on how
21 interviews were conducted of these witnesses, that opens the
22 door. I think it's beyond the scope.
23 MS. MENNINGER: It is beyond the scope, your Honor.
24 MS. COMEY: I apologize, your Honor. I don't
25 understand what your Honor means by open the door.
