government has shaved a considerable amount of its case off in
the last day. And wé Have witness issues. People are

traveling. We had been budgeting that we would start our case

the following week, after the three-day break, simply becatse we

thought, given the number of witnesses that were left, that we

would bé maybe even going into the following week before the

defense case started,

So given ‘that they have now trimmed their case
significantly in the last day, we are’ trying to hustle
withesses; It's not that easy. So our strong preference, your

would fill up Friday with the charge conference, if the Court

isn't == if wé want té6 do it at a later time, we Gan also do

request, which is given the expedition, of ‘the government." s

case, your request is to start the defense case, whatever it
Looks. Like, on Thursday when we return,.
