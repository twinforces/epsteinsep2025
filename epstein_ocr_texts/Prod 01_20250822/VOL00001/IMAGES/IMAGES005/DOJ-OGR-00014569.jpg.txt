LCKCmax7 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey

1 experiences differently over time. They mixed up details,

2 couldn't remember exactly when certain things took place. But
3 if you think about your own lives and your own memories, you

4 will see that difficulty remembering certain things doesn't

5 mean that they didn't happen, doesn't mean that you don't

6 remember the core. Jane and Carolyn were both abused many,

7 many times over a period of years. The abuse became routine,

8 the same sickening process each time, these were recurring

) events.

10 Now imagine you were asked to recall a recurring event
11 from years ago in your own lives. Say something like a

12 holiday, like Thanksgiving. There is a routine you follow each
13 year, the same food, the same people attend. That event stands
14 out in your mind because it's significant, it's a holiday, but
15 you won't necessarily remember the specific dinner conversation
16 you had each year. You're sure you had turkey because that

17 happened every time, but some details are just not going to

18 stand out to you because essentially the same thing happens

19 every year.
20 Now what might stand out is when a routine gets
21 broken. Say one year a neighbor came over to join who was
22 unexpected or you switched up salt and sugar anda pie got
23 totally ruined. You'll remember that different thing, but you
24 might not be able to remember which Thanksgiving that thing
25 happened. Did the neighbor come when I was 14, or 15, or 16?
