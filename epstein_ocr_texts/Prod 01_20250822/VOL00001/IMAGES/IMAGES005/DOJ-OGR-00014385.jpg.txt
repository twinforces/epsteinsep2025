1 of which were asked of the relevant investigative agents or

2 arguments that could be made based on the absence of evidence

3 in the record and the like. And my ruling was what it was,

4 which didn't foreclose entirely the opportunity with respect to

5 cross-examination and the like. I suspect this will be part of

6 the defense's arguments in closing, so it's appropriate to

7 include the charge.

8 MR. EVERDELL: Understood.

9 Just as long as we're allowed to argue, are permitted
10 to argue in closing about absence of evidence consistent with
11 the Court's ruling.

12 THE COURT: Absolutely, so long as the inference is
13 available in the record.
14 And I'll just pause, because I made a note to say
15 this. I have a decent memory, and my afternoon and tomorrow
16 will be spent reviewing much of the trial testimony. I don't
17 want objections during closings, but that requires -- I gather
18 it's Ms. Menninger that's doing the closing and Ms. Moe, who
19 are absent today. So for both sides, any inference argued had
20 better be from the transcript or the documents, and any
21 objections should be rare and not based on your interpretation
22 of the available evidence but the fact of the available
23 evidence. We should get through closings without objections.
24 MR. EVERDELL: Understood, your Honor.
25 MR. ROHRBACH: Understood on our part, your Honor.
