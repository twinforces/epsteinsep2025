1 Q. Do you remember roughly where on the Upper East Side she

2 was living when you started the job?

3 A. I want to say it was 84th Street. I lived on 88th Street,
4 so I remember kind of feeling like we were in the same

5 neighborhood.

6 Q. And do you remember roughly when she moved to 65th Street?
7 A. I would say that would be during the middle of my time

8 there, maybe 2000, late '90s, early 2000.

9 QO. And the 8lst Street residence, what kind of residence was
10 that?

11 A. What kind of residence?

12 Q. Was it a townhouse or an apartment?

13 A. It was a townhouse with many levels.

14 Q. Was that the 84th Street one or the 65th Street one?

15 A. No, I'm sorry. I was thinking that we were talking about
16 Jeffrey Epstein's on 7Jlst Street. So now we went back to

17 Ghislaine?

18 Q. Yes. Let me be clear. I'm asking you about Ghislaine's

19 different residences, you mentioned two, one on 84th Street,
20 one on 64th Street?
al A. Correct.
22 Q. So let me first ask you about the 84th Street residence.
23 What kind of a residence was that?
24 A. That was a townhouse-type thing. Maybe it was an
25 apartment. It was so long ago, I can't really recall that, but
