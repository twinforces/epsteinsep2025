LCKVMAX8 Charge

1 When taken all together and considered as whole, however, these
2 acts and conduct may warrant the inference that a conspiracy

3 existed as conclusively as would direct proof, such as evidence
4 of an express agreement.

5 In short, as far as the first element of the

19 charged in Count One of the indictment is to entice individuals
20 under the age of 17 to travel to engage in sexual activity for

25 that those elements be done, then the enticement of individuals
