1 THE COURT: Well, fair enough. Fair enough. I don't
2 know if they're asking for another copy.

3 MS. STERNHEIM: Or with holes in it, at least.

4 THE COURT: I'll show it to you there. Next to Jane,
5 it says -- oh, I think maybe, Ms. Sternheim, you've intuited.

6 In parentheses, it says, "Being returned," crossed out, and

7 then it says, "No."

8 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, of the three testimonies they

9 got, Jane was the last and it was Juan in a binder. The other
10 two were in binders.

11 THE COURT: I see. I see. TI didn't know that.

12 MS. STERNHEIM: It was in the rush of trying to get it
13 to them quickly.

14 THE COURT: Well, we could dispute that, but -- so I
15 guess, because they didn't return it, I guess they are asking
16 for another copy, three-hole punched and in a binder, in

17 addition, Juan and Kate. My clerk will show you the note if

18 you'd like to see it.

19 MS. COMEY: That's fine, your Honor. I believe
20 Ms. Drescher is going to print out those transcripts right now
2l with the agreed-upon redactions and we'll hole punch them and
22 put them in binders.
23 THE COURT: Okay. I think the response is coming out,
24 so we'll just sit tight for a minute.
