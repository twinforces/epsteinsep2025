LEKVMAX4 Summation, - Ms. Moe

the facts of this, Gasé. And that's because those experiments,
are nothing like what. happened hene, And Loftus was basically
forced to ddmit that on cross-exdmination.

Remember that study she described about telling people
that they were lost tin a mall? Rémenber that she only was able
to trick 25 percent of the participants about that?

But, moré importantly, another researcher then did a

follow-up study, and that researcher tried to implant two false
memories. She tried to implant the lost-in-the-mall Story, and

also a story about an unpleasant bodily intrusion, a rectal

enema: Now, Some people were tricked about getting 16st in the
malt, but. no one had a, false memory about getting a rectal
enema. Why iS that? Your common sense télls you that kind of
experience is the sort of thing you can't. trick someone into
belisevinhg. You Canhet suggest that. You can't make it up. A
rectal enema is the kind of thing ‘you'd, only remember Lf it
really happeéenéd, kind of like sexual abuse.

And again, Loftus basically had to admit this on

cross=examination. She said the Gore meméry 6f trauma is
stronger than other types of memory. She admitted that.

People might forget some 6f tHe peripheral details, but the

cone of the traumatic event, those memories are much stronger.
You dén't. need a paid expert to tell you that, ladies and
gentlemen. It's just, common sense. You remember something
‘like this.
