LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 lodge at Interlochen. He paid for his employees' kids to go to
2 college. He gave Larry Visoski 40 acres of land on a ranch

3 free of charge so he could build a house there. He didn't ask
4 anything in return for this generosity. Education was

5 important to him, and he did it for a number of employees.

6 Everyone knew that Epstein was doing this. The

7 employees knew about the tuition payments. Everyone knew he

8 was building a lodge at Interlochen that was handicap

9 accessible. So to everyone, including Ghislaine, it looked

10 like Epstein wanted to use his money to further the ambitions
11 and education of those around him.

12 As far as these bank records, where they showed you

13 these big numbers, and Ms. Moe just argued that's essentially
14 buying off a sex abuse case, you saw that for all those

15 records, the person who signed for the accounts was Harry

16 Beller, who Cim Espinosa told you was Epstein's accountant. He
17 was signing all the checks. Beller had control over the

18 account, and he's the one signing for the accounts.

19 Who knows what that money was for. Did anyone from
20 the bank tell you what that money was for? Certainly no one
21 from JPMorgan did. What about all these other people around
22 Epstein who made the wire transfers or paid for it? Did they
23 come and testify?
24 The government wants you to speculate over and over,
25 and they want to put up big dollar signs and make you believe
