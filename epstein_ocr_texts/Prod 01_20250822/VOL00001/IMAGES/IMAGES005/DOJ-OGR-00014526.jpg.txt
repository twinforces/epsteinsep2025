LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 she met Ghislaine in 1994, when she was younger than 17. And

2 so Kate was firm that that's the address she went to, the house
3 with the red door. It's actually Government Exhibit 702. So

4 when you see that house, you'll know that's the one that Kate

5 was talking about. It's across from something called The Nags

al in another property dispute from 2019 that Ghislaine Maxwell
22 gave under oath when it was talking about a totally different
23 property. And they asked her in 2019, When did you start
24 living at Kinnerton Street? And she said, 92, '93. She didn't
25 have any documents in front of her. And she's talking about a
