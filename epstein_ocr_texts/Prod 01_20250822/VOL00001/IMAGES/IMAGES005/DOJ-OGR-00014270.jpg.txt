MR. EVERDELL: 7 can't remember when ‘the government

produced the depo to us.

MS. MOE: Yotir Honor, on Friday evening, ‘the defense
produced the Kinnerton. Street records to the government, The
next day, ‘we produced 'the deposition in which Ms. Maxwell made
that statement. Of course, it's Ms, Maxwell's ‘own. deposition
and, it's also a ptiblia record.

THE COURT: Right. I mean, it comes. in. I don't see
any basis, it doesn't come in. The question is --

MS, MOE: Your Henor, with respect te the deposition,
just so the record is clear, it's only being offered to rebut.
this Last minute registry issue. There is mo -- to the extent
defense céunsel is arguing they néed to call this witness to
rebut. an inference from the government, LL want to be clear it's

Only because the defense is putting this at issue. We would be

happy to just mest here and, not make this an issue at. all. fhe

reason that there is a purported need for this is, again,

because the defense is inviting this issue at ‘this late hour.
MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, if the government is
willing to stap to just putting in, the property records showing
the title ownership without the deposition transcript, wé're
willing to do that, we won't, need the extra witness. If

they're géing to put in the deposition transcript and make that

an, issue, we feel like we need the other witness to be able to

counter that.
