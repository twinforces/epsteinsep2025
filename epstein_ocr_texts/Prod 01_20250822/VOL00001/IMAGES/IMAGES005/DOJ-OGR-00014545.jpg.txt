LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 significant body of research and work because she wrote one

2 book called Witness for the Defense. But you will have her CV
3 and you can look at her eminent qualifications and all of her

4 research on how people can develop memories of things that

5 didn't happen or remember things differently from the way they
6 actually were and how people can develop false memories.

7 And what she told you is that memory is malleable.

8 Memory weakens over time. And memory can be impacted and

9 corrupted by post-event contamination. She talked about times
10 when false memories can be planted in a person's mind, and that
11 the person could then become just as emotional about these

12 created memories as other individuals who truly had the

13 experiences. And contrary to what most people think, memory

14 doesn't work like a recording device; you can't just push play
15 and it all comes back later.

16 Memories can be impacted by post-event information

17 that comes from all different sources. Interviews that use

18 words that are suggestive. You'll recall that she talked about
19 the study where they used the word "smashed." How fast was the
20 car going when it smashed into the other car; and that people
al gave much higher rates of speed when they heard that word,
22 because it was suggested to them that it was fast.
23 And then think back about how none of the interviews
24 of these accusers were recorded and we don't have transcripts
25 and we don't know the words that were used in those interviews.
