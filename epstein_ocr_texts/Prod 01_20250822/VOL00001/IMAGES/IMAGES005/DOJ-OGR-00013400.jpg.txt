1 the passengers were. So sometimes we might get introduced to

3 Q. Did you always know the name of every passenger onboard?

6 A. Nobody told us who they were.

7 Q. If there was a passenger onboard and you didn't know that

9 in your Logbook?

10 A. With the industry standard of "PAX," which is abbreviation
11 for passenger. And then later on we further change it from

12 that to either -- the gender, either male or female.

13 Q. I want to go now actually backing up.

25 Q. I want to look at flight number 573, please. Can you
