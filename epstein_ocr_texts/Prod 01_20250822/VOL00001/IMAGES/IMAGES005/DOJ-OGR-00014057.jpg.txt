1 BY MR. EVERDELL:

2 Q. And just to be clear, when I refer to border crossing, what
3 does that mean to you?

4 A. That, it could mean either any international traveler

a coming into the United States at any international airport,

6 seaport, or land border along the Mexican or northern border of
7 Canada.

8 Q. And the information you just listed is stored in the TECS

9 system for those passengers that are entering through ports of
10 entry; is that right?

11 A. Yes.

12 Q. How far back do the border crossing records go in the TECS
13 system?

14 A. It's hard to say. In my experience, I have not seen any

15 border crossings any earlier than roughly the early '90s, mid
16 "90s.

17 Q. And how does the border crossing information that is stored
18 in the TECS system get input into that database?

19 A. So, there is another system, it's called APIS, Advanced
20 Passenger Information System, and essentially what happens is
al international airlines or any airline that has international
22 flights coming into or departing the United States, they're
23 required to submit their manifest to us. The manifest gets
24 loaded into APIS, which is then linked to text, and that's how
25 we're able to see that information.
