1 issue and it's close, I'll admit, based on where I am now. I

2 think it's close.

3 But what I'm wondering is if what the defense

4 essentially needs to make the arguments it wants to make is

5) testimony from Mr. Glassman that he told the government that he
6 told Jane that some form of cooperation or testimony would help
7 her case. That question might have some evidentiary issues,

8 but it's not an attorney-client privilege issue.

9 I think the answer to that question basically gets the
10 defense what it's looking for without infringing on

11 attorney-client privilege. And so I'd like you to consider a
12 proposal in which the testimony that you're seeking is limited
13 to that and, depending on the parties' views and Mr. Glassman's
14 views, if that is the limit of the testimony, whether it could
15 be through stipulation.

16 So you'll consider that.

17 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

18 MR. PAGLIUCA: We will, your Honor.

19 THE COURT: Okay. All right.
20 Anything else I can take up?
21 We're checking on our jurors.
22 MR. EVERDELL: Nothing from the defense, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: I'm sorry.
24 So you put in the letters to me last night on 52.
25 You'll docket those today?
