1 a bag containing the costumes themselves and would anticipate

2 otherwise asking Special Agent Maguire to publish them to the

3 jury so that they can see both what they look like and also how
4 small they are.

5 So I'm just thinking about the mechanics of this.

6 One option would be to offer the photographs and the

7 bag without eliciting out loud what they are and just

8 confirming without describing them that these are items that

9 were recovered from the residence and where they were recovered
10 without publishing the photographs or opening the bag.

11 Would that be the Court's preference? I'd be happy to
12 do it another way.

13 THE COURT: Mr. Everdell.

14 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I do have an issue with

15 these being displayed or shown in any way, shape, or form until
16 witness 3 testifies. I actually have some concerns and I hope
17 they're not unfounded. They pushed her testimony off, she was
18 originally supposed to testify today, I don't know if it maybe
19 had to do with a travel issue or not, but I don't know is she
20 going to testify or not, when is she going to testify, if she
21 doesn't testify for whatever reason, then these items and the
22 photographs of those items should not be seen by the jury at
23 all. And so that is my concern. I don't want this to be in
24 their heads, in their minds at all unless we have a witness on
25 the stand who can connect their relevance to this case, and
