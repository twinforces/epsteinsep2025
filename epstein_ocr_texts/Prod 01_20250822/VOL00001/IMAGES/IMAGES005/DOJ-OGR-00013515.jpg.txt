1 A. All right.
2 Q. He had two different residences in New York from 1991 to
i) 2005, let's call it; right?
4 A. Three that I remember.
5 Q. Did you visit all three of these?
6 A. Two I visited.
7 Q. Well, the first one you visited was on 69th Street; is that
8 right?
9 A. That's correct.
10 Q. So that's where he was living when you first had the job
11 when you first got hired in 1991; right?
12 A. I think day 1, I thought that he lived in an apartment, but
13 I could be mistaken, but it was very soon after that that he
14 was at 69th Street.
15 Q. So almost -- very shortly after you were hired by him, he
16 moved into 69th Street; right?
17 A. I think so.
18 Q. He may have lived somewhere else before that?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. But at some point in the mid '90s, he moved to a townhouse
21 on Vist Street; right?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. That was in 1996 that he did that; isn't that right?
24 A. That's correct.
25 Q. And that was 9 East Vist Street?
