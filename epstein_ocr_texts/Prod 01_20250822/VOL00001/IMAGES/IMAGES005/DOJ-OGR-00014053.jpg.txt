1 specifically, I was assigned to what's called RCLG, regional

2 carrier liaison group.

3 Q. Can you explain for the jury what the passenger analysis

4 unit is and what the RCLG is?

5 A. Sure. PAU used to be mainly an intel center made up of

6 several different functions such as narcotics, terrorism, and

7 RCLG. RCLG, we were more or less liaisons that would

8 communicate with airline and airport employees in foreign

9 countries. And we would make recommendations to those airline
10 employees if we basically found or noticed a particular

11 passenger that would be on one of their flights coming into the
12 United States that might have some kind of an issue being

13 admitted into the United States.

14 We would then, if we did find a passenger such as

15 this, we would recommend to that airline to do what we call an
16 offload. So it's just a recommendation to that airline saying,
17 If this passenger does travel on your airline into the United
18 States, there is either a high probability or a certainty that
19 they will not be admitted, be able to be admitted into the
20 United States. We recommend they go to the closest embassy and
al get their issue figured out there.
22 Q. How Long did you do that work for at CBP?
23 A. Roughly four and a half years.
24 Q. And did you have a position after that?
25 A. I did. In 2015, I was promoted to first line supervisor,
