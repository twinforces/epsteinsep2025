LC2VMAX4 Alessi â€” Direct

1 after that date; correct?

2 MS. COMEY: Objection. Compound.

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't think that's a compound

4 question.

5 THE COURT: Overruled.

6 Q. You wouldn't have had 606 because assuming the date on 606
7 is even accurate, it's after you left; correct?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. Okay. And so you, Mr. Alessi, don't have any personal
10 knowledge about, first of all, how 606, this exhibit, came into
11 existence; correct? Because this is not whatever it was that
12 you had?
13 A. No, I did not have it.
14 Q. Right. Okay.
15 And you, Mr. Alessi, didn't have this Exhibit 606 with
16 you after you left. You threw whatever was given to you away,
17 as I understand it; correct?
18 A. Yes, I did.
19 Q. Because you didn't agree with whatever was given to you?
20 MS. COMEY: Objection, your Honor. This is voir dire.
al THE COURT: Just a moment.
22 T'll sustain with respect to the last question.
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: Okay.
24 Q. But so we're clear, whatever you were given, you threw it
25 away and didn't keep it after you left in 2002?
