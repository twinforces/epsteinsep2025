4 BY MR. EVERDELL:

5 Q. Ms. Espinosa, are you familiar with the address 301 East

6 66th Street?

7 A. Yes.

8 Q. And what is at that address?

9 A. That is an apartment building.

10 Q. Did you have any job responsibilities with respect to that
11 apartment building?

12 A. Yes.

13 Q. Can you describe what those were?

14 A. Sure. First it was managing the scheduling of the

15 apartments, like a calendar, if you will. There was

16 approximately a dozen apartments that Jeffrey Epstein owned,

17 and there were employees that stayed there, family, friends,

18 guests.

19 Q. And when you say you managed the calendar, what do you mean
20 by that?
21 A. Well, that we had a notebook that told us who was staying
22 in what apartment on any day, that way we would know what
23 apartment was available to give to someone else.
24 Q. And was your responsibility to manage that calendar?
25 A. Yes.
