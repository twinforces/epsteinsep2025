LCSCMAXT

1 THE COURT: T am â€”- yes, go ahead, Ms. Moe.

2 MS. MOE: We're just going to add that the government
3 agrees that the Court has the discretion to set a schedule for
4 deliberations. Absent a hardship, I think the schedule the

S Court has proposed is entirely reasonable under the

6 circumstances.

7 THE COURT: Here's what I'll do. I'll do what I just
8 indicated today for through the week, and if we don't have a

9 verdict tomorrow, I'll say through the weekend.

10 MR. PAGLIUCA: That makes sense to me, your Honor.

11 THE COURT: In each case, I am couching it with, they
12 have the option to indicate if it's a hardship due to

13 unmoveable commitments.

14 MR. PAGLIUCA: That's a good suggestion, your Honor.
15 That's fine with us.

16 THE COURT: Ms. Moe.

17 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.

18 THE COURT: Let me tell you exactly what I plan to say
19 so you can tell me if you wish anything different.
20 First, I'll just go over the schedule and COVID
al protocols, which the district executive has asked me to remind,
22 in light of the variant. And I'll continue to urge caution as
23 I have been. And then I'll say, as to schedule going forward,
24 we are going to continue with the same daily schedule as today,
25 that is to say 9:00 a.m. to at least 6:00 p.m. Please let me
