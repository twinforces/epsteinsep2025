8 THE COURT: Carolyn. Carolyn. You have to wait for
9 the question to finish and then you may give your answer. Go
10 ahead.

11 Q. That's different from your lawsuits filed against Epstein
12 and Kellen in 2008 and 2009; correct? Correct?

13 A. I already answered. Yes.

14 Q. The other difference between your 2008 and 2009 lawsuits

23 bottom of the page, the number there.
24 Q. Does that refresh your recollection —--
25 A. That does not say $3.9 million. It's $2,804,000.
