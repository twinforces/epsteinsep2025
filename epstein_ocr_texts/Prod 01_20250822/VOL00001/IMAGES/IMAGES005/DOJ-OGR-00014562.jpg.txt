LCKCmax7 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey

1 (Jury present)

2 THE COURT: Everyone may be seated. Thank you,

3 members of the jury. We'll now hear a short rebuttal argument
4 by the government.

5 Ms. Comey, you may proceed.

6 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.

7 I want to start off by making one thing very clear,

8 this case is about that woman, it's about the children that she
9 targeted, the steps that she took to serve those children up to
10 be abused. It's about her own participation in that abuse when
11 she touched Jane's breasts and Carolyn's breasts and Annie's

12 breasts. This case is about Ghislaine Maxwell, the crimes she
13 committed.

14 The defense just spent a whole lot of energy trying to
15 get you to think about anyone other than the defendant, trying
16 to get you to look away from the massive amount of evidence

17 that Ms. Moe walked you through this morning.

18 Now, to be clear, the defense doesn't have to do

19 anything at all at this trial. As Judge Nathan has instructed
20 you, the government bears the burden of proof and we embrace
21 that burden, but when the defense makes arguments like they
22 just did, it is perfectly appropriate for you to think about
23 whether those arguments make any sense at all and it is
24 perfectly appropriate for the government to respond to those
25 arguments. Here, the defense's theories just do not hold up.
