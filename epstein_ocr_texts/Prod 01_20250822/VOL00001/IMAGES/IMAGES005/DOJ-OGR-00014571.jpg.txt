1 event. And you know Jane was 14 when she met Maxwell and

2 Epstein. She vividly remembers being 14 years old when that

3 abuse began. It was within a year of her father dying. That's
4 an anchoring way for her to hold onto that memory and know she
5 was 14. It's also what she told Matt a decade ago long before
6 this trial. And there are documents to confirm she's right.

7 You saw the Interlochen records putting her and the defendant

8 and Epstein all at Interlochen the same summer of 1994. You

9 saw the flight records putting Maxwell and Epstein there that
10 summer. It is so clear that Jane was 14 when she met these

11 predators.

12 Now the defense tries to wiggle out of that by

13 suggesting that Jane's estimation that she was approximately 15
14 on Mike Wallace's birthday somehow means that she got that date
15 wrong. Ladies and gentlemen, which would stand out more in

16 your mind, how old you were on Mike Wallace's birthday or how
17 old you were the first time a middle-aged man molested you? It
18 is obvious that Jane remembers these core events clearly, and
19 that is what matters.
20 And hypothetically, let's just say the defense was
21 right. Let's just say that she got the timing of her first
22 meeting wrong, that it was actually that last summer when she
23 turned 16 in 1996, and you know that she knew them by the time
24 she was 16 because you saw the flight records putting her on
25 those planes with defendant and Epstein going to New York when
