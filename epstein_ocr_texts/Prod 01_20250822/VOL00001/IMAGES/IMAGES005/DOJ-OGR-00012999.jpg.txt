emails or took thé photographs or were in the photographs, could
testify and identify themselves, no such evidence would ever be
offered in court. But of Gourse that's not what happens. All

we do is we offer law enforcement agents who seized these’ items

and, Can authenticate them, and if defense wants to make

arguments to their relevance or otherwise, that goes to their
weight. and net. their admissibility, and those drgtiments aré for
the jury.

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, in many criminal Gasés,
there are lots of context. over what photographs are admissible

and for what purpose.» For example, if it was a photograph that

was taken inside of a store when there was a robbeny that
purported to take place in the store, there would be a witness
to say that this photograph was taken in or near the events and
that wé have réasén té believe that néthing inside the sto6re
has changed. Just showing photographs that are undated, they
may bé from 1975 for all I know, and showed the two of them

tegether and there is mo one to say that it hasn't been altered,

in thé médntimé, even the low bar of Showing that. the
phetograph is a photograph and without a witness to say it Js
what it purported to be, I don't think that tHat is true with
respect to what is admissible for a photograph. It's a Low
bar, but theré is not even a single person that can say that
this phetograph or the ones behind it, dre what they purport to
be..
