1 addition to the name Carolyn, we add "and the testimony of

2 Special Agent Jason Richards," assuming that's appropriately

3 responsive to the question.

4 THE COURT: I don't think it is, remembering fondly

a when I said "period."

6 MR. PAGLIUCA: IT understand, your Honor.

7 THE COURT: "We would like the FBI deposition 3505-005
8 referred to by the defense during the cross-examination of

9 Carolyn."

10 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I don't see how Agent

11 Richards' testimony is in any way responsive to that note. I
12 think the response that the Court already gave is fully

13 responsive.

14 THE COURT: It is.

15 MR. PAGLIUCA: My request stands, your Honor, we add
16 Special Agent Jason Richards to that.

17 THE COURT: Understood.

18 Overruled. Because it's not what they've asked for.
19 But we can be prepared, should they follow up with that
20 request.
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: We have the transcript here, your
22 Honor.
23 THE COURT: I am reading the notes verbatim, but I
24 will work on redacting the foreperson's name so they can be
25 made public.
