2 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I anticipate the witness is
3 going to say that Jane's mother referred to Jane as Epstein's

4 goddaughter and that that actually caused a reaction, that

5 people in the office treated her a certain way because that's

6 how she represented Jane to be. I'm not offering it for the

7 truth, it's simply the effect on this listener and how she

8 responded to Jane's mother when she was in the office.

9 MS. POMERANTZ: No objection.

10 THE COURT: Do you want a Limiting?

11 MS. POMERANTZ: It's fine, your Honor.

12 THE COURT: Do you want a limiting?

13 MR. EVERDELL: I don't think so your Honor.
