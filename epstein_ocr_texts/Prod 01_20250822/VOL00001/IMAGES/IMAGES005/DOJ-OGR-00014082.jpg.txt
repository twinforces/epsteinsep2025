9 reviewing flight records from after 9/11?

10 A. Yes.

11 Q. Based on your review of CBP records in your experience as a

13 from before 9/11 and after 9/11?

14 A. Yes.

15 Q. What difference have you noticed?

16 A. Well, so if you -- if you look at the records, not

17 necessarily these, but just in general, from my experience,
