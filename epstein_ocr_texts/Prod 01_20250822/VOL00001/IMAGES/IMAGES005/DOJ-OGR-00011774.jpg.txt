1 (Jury not present)

2 THE COURT: Looks like we have everybody. Matters to
3 take up, counsel.

4 MS. COMEY: Nothing from the government, your Honor.

5) MR. EVERDELL: Nothing, your Honor, but note we have

6 put the folders under the chairs as we agreed yesterday.

7 THE COURT: And the government has seen -- well, I

8 guess you didn't see them, but you are aware of them?

9 MS. COMEY: We have seen the outside of the folders,
10 your Honor.

11 THE COURT: Mr. Everdell, there are two folders.

12 MR. EVERDELL: There is one folder with two documents.
13 THE COURT: One folder with two documents. And then,
14 as we discussed, he'll direct us as necessary to make sure

15 everybody can follow along.

16 I think the only thing I wanted to raise is that,

17 assuming the timing works out, I would like to speak with the
18 juror who had the trip planned, with the court reporter

19 present, of course, to see if there is additional information
20 about the ability to change that plan to make sure it's not
al weighing on my mind. Without objection to that?
22 MS. COMEY: No objection, your Honor.
23 MR. EVERDELL: No objection, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: So if they're here a little on the early
25 side, I'll do that before, otherwise I'll do it at the break.
