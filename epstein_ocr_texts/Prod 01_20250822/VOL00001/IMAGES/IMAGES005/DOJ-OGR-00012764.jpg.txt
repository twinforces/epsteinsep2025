the applicable timeframe by testifying that they're similar to

the outfits shé was allegedly instructed to wear.

Last, the government references photoes taken in

‘|

Epstein's apartment that depict photos of celebrities. T 'think

the government. here represents that it doesn't intend to admit
these photos but! will elicit the testimony of law enforcement

officers that they saw celebrity pictures. Government's brief

at 12. Defense notes, it would oppose ddmission of the photos.

L'll reserve judgment until L have a better sense of what. the
government. is séékihg to do with those photos.

MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, can L ask a clarification.
questioh 6n the last point. I expect the government will ask
that, witness about the decor of Epstein''s jhouse and, that, the

witness will say something like there were many photos of

celebrities ‘and nude ‘photos of women, but the government. would
not offer any exhibits that demonstrate that fact. So the
government just wants ‘to make sure that that, question would, be
a proper question. T understand the Court is reserving until
it hears the answer.

THE GOURT: I'm reserving on the admissidn of the
exhibits, ‘which it sounds. Like you're mot moving?

MR. ROHRBACH: We're not. planning.

THE COURT: I don't see anything wrong with that,
question.
