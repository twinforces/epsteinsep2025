LC2VMAX2 Rocchio â€” Direct

1 A. Grooming the environment refers to -- it's most relevant to
2 the stages two and three in terms of gaining access and then

3 building trust. It means that the perpetrator is known to

4 often not only develop a relationship of trust with the

iy intended victim, but also with individuals in the victim's

6 lives.

7 So they may, for example, hold themselves out to

8 parents, say, as somebody who's going to be there as a support
9 to the parent, to fill some need that maybe the parent would

10 like to provide for the child, but for some reason is unable

11 to. But, again, it's a series of lies and deceptive

12 manipulations that the perpetrator engages in so that when they
13 spend a lot of time alone with a child, it doesn't raise any

14 sort of suspicion and it increases access. It also increases
15 the child's trust in the perpetrator because now you have other
16 adults perhaps that the child trusts who are kind of conveying
17 that this is -- this is a trustworthy and an okay person to be
18 spending time with.

19 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, do the
20 techniques used by perpetrators to build a relationship with a
21 child vary depending on the age of the child?
22 A. Yes. Perpetrators are really quite skillful. And when
23 they are interviewed, they'll tell you that they can really --
24 they work hard to pinpoint exactly what it is they need to do
25 in order to win over the trust of a particular individual.
