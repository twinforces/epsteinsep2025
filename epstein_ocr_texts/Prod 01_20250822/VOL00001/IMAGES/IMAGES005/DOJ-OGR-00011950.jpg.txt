LBUVMAX4 Jane - direct

1 A. The conversation just sort of ended abruptly. It was in

2 his office. And he just took my hand and he said, Follow me.

3 Q. Where did he take you?

4 A. He took me outside in the backyard past the pool to the

5 pool house.

6 Q. Could you please describe for the jury what happened when

7 he took you inside the pool house.

8 A. He took me in the pool house. And on the right-hand side

9 was this couch, futon-looking thing. And he just proceeded to
10 pull me over. And he sat in the corner and he didn't say a
11 word. And he just pulled his pants down. He was wearing
12 sweatpants. And he pulled me on top of himself and he
13 proceeded to masturbate on me. And then he just -- he got up
14 and he went into the bathroom and, like, cleaned himself up,
15 and then acted like nothing happened.
16 Q. What was your reaction when he did that to you?
17 A. Well, I was frozen in fear. I'd never seen a penis before,
18 let alone not seen anything like this.
19 Q. Did you tell anyone that day about what happened to you?
20 A. No.
al Q. Why not?
22 A. Because I was terrified and felt gross and I felt ashamed.
23 Q. After the incident that you just described, did you
24 continue spending time with Maxwell and Epstein in Palm Beach?
25 A. Yes.
