12 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, it goes to bias, her

13 motive to testify in this case, and her bias against my client.
14 THE COURT: Let's start with a more basic issue which
15 no one has briefed, but Manko v. United States, are you

17 MS. MOE: I'm not, your Honor.

21 encouragement of civil settlements sufficient to bar their
22 admission in civil actions is insufficient, in our view, to
23 outweigh the need for accurate determinations in criminal cases
24 where the stakes are higher."
25 Is that good law?
