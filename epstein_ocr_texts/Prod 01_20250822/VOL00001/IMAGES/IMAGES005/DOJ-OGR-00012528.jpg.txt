Honor already madé, that this, is overly prejudicial and the
jury will draw the wrong conelusion from it, so we need te
excliide it. I don't sée the difference.

excluded, the phetograph was on the floor, It was unclear

where it hdd béen posi'tionéd originally. It was tncledr where

it had been positioned when the search was conducted.

Here, this 18 a photograph Ti expect the witness will
testify te, ‘showing the exact placement, and the reason we need
that Closeup is because the photograph of the zoomed=sut
bookshelf, you cannot. actually see the image. You, can, see the
frame. and yOu can tell that it's the same Circular frame, but.
you cannot see the image without, a closeup, so we will show the

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, that’s the point. If ‘you.
z6om Sut, you will séé this photograph in the context. of S6ther
photographs that. ane nomsexual. This I don't ‘think 1s sexual,
but that are not with underage girls, that are with other
photos, including people with adults. It's shown in context, in

a series 6f photos aldéng a bookshelf where pedple tend to keep

photos, lots of different. photos, and it will. show a panoply of
