1 Honor already made, that this is overly prejudicial and the

2 jury will draw the wrong conclusion from it, so we need to

3 exclude it. I don't see the difference.

4 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think the difference here is

5 that, in Mr. Everdell's -- in the photograph that your Honor

6 excluded, the photograph was on the floor. It was unclear

7 where it had been positioned originally. It was unclear where

8 it had been positioned when the search was conducted.

9 Here, this is a photograph I expect the witness will
10 testify to, showing the exact placement, and the reason we need
11 that closeup is because the photograph of the zoomed-out
12 bookshelf, you cannot actually see the image. You can see the
13 frame and you can tell that it's the same circular frame, but
14 you cannot see the image without a closeup, so we will show the
15 two in succession.

16 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, that's the point. If you
17 zoom out, you will see this photograph in the context of other
18 photographs that are nonsexual. This I don't think is sexual,
19 but that are not with underage girls, that are with other

20 photos, including people with adults. It's shown in context in
21 a series of photos along a bookshelf where people tend to keep
22 photos, lots of different photos, and it will show a panoply of
23 photos that is not one photo of a clearly minor child with him
24 looking like he's about to bite her backside. At least there
25 you have a full context of other photos and it is not a zoom-in
