counsel has beén unduly rushed here.

record is. ‘what. it is. There was a five-day, three-business-—day

break between the close of the government's case. The record

will reflect when you learned when the government. will likely
rest, ‘the mecord will meflect. what you, said, regarding when, you,
learned of a nonréesponsive witness, and the record will reflect
that, I will take an application within, a half an hour with an.
opportunity for the government to respond all ih the interest.
of conforming to my standard practice, which is everybody jhas
their next witness or be prepared to rest or bring in a
different. witness.

Now, we'll take it as it comes. What I'm learning,

what, is new information to me today, which is different than

yesterday, whén we knew wheh I was informed that the defense
would mest today with ‘the exception of some small. issue or
document that. M8. Menninger put aside. There is no argument
about, a ‘subpoenaed witness who i's nonresponsive. There was no
suggestion, of a need for a witness to fly in from England. So
