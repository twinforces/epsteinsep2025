7 That's the exact question --

8 THE COURT: What was the response?

9 MS. MENNINGER: You asked me that question three

10 times. I believe it is around then, but I don't know exactly
11 when.

12 And the position of Jane was that he was living there
13 in 1994. So I think under 401, it is a question of whether

14 that's relevant. It is certainly different than the

15 testimony â€”--

16 THE COURT: The fact that it was asked three times is

19 MS. MENNINGER: There was motive to develop it, your
20 Honor. That was the whole point of this litigation. I mean, I
21 can offer the complaint as well, but it's in the summary
22 judgment ruling.
23 THE COURT: Okay.
24 For the same reason, it's sustained.
25 What else?
