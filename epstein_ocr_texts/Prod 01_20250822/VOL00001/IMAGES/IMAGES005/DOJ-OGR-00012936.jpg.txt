1 other proper authority that gave you the authority to sign

2 checks?

3 A. I don't know the account documents referencing this, but

4 you would need to be authorized or the -—- I'm not a check

a cashing expert.

6 Q. Fair enough. I just want to point out one other things.

7 We can take down 506 at this point. If we could just go back

8 to the sixth page of 502 and look at those checks again, page

9 6. If we could just quickly look at check numbers 1061 and

10 1062, I think those are the middle -- those two, the second and
11 third checks.

12 So just to look at a particular check, if you're

13 looking at 1061, that looks like it's a payment for $7 going to
14 someone with the title at the end, DDS; right?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. That's a dentist. Okay. And looking at the next check,

17 it's about $400, that's check 1062, looks like it's going to

18 somebody with an M.D. after their name; right?

19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And that's apparently another doctor; right?
2l A. Yes.
22 Q. Okay. And those are both signed apparently by Harry Beller
23 from this account?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. And let's look at the last two checks on that page, 1063
