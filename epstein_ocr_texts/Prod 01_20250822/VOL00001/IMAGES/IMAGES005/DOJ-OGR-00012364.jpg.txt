LC2VMAX2 Rocchio â€” Direct

1 MR. PAGLIUCA: No, your Honor.

2 THE COURT: Okay. So let's go back to that question.
3 So you started by saying grooming the environment.

4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Right.

5 THE COURT: What does this have to do with it?

6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, because what that -- what the

7 testimony from Dr. Rocchio was and is, is that the perpetrator
8 is deceiving people around the perpetrator. She talked about

9 the boy scout business and all of that. And that is part of
10 this hindsight -- bias hindsight effect which is referred to in
11 the literature. And I think it's appropriate to bring that out
12 as part of this testimony.
