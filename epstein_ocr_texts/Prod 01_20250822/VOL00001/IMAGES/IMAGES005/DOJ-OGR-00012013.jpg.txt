1 godfather-like figure when she was growing up who helped the

2 family. I anticipate that Matt will testify that Jane told him
3 during these conversations that the money was not for free,

4 that she had to do things that she didn't want to do, that that
a included massages. I also anticipate that Matt would testify

6 that there was a woman in the room and he recalls Jane

7 describing that a woman was present while this happened who

8 would make her and other girls who were in the room feel

9 comfortable while it happened.

10 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim.

11 MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, I think it's somewhat

12 premature since the cross examination has not been concluded

13 yet. I am mindful of the purpose why they're calling this

14 witness, but I think we have to wait to see what happens in

15 cross examination. I don't understand what they're asking for
16 right now.

17 MS. MOE: Your Honor, defense counsel put this issue
18 in their opening statement by challenging Jane's credibility

19 and her memory in particular. So the foundation is in the
20 record for a prior consistent statement to be admitted under
2l both prongs of the rule.
22 With respect to the first prong of 801(d)(1)(B), it is
23 offered to rebut an express or implied charge the declarant
24 recently fabricated it or acted from a recent improper
25 influence or motive in so testifying.
