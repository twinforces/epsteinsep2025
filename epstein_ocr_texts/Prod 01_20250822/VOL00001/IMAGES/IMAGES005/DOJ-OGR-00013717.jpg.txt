LCACmax5 A. Farmer â€” cross

1 AFTERNOON SESSION

2 1:30 p.m.

3 THE COURT: All right. Matters to take up, counsel?

4 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, just briefly from the

5 government, my not amazing math skills, but I note that I think
6 that the witness who's been on cross examination now for about
7 the same amount of time that she was on direct examination, it
8 would be helpful for scheduling purposes to know when we can

9 expect to have the next witness ready.

10 MS. MENNINGER: I don't know, your Honor. An hour.

11 MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor.

12 And the other question, I just -- rather not a

13 question, just one thing I wanted to flag. I believe that, on
14 cross examination, the witness was asked some questions about
15 hindsight bias, which I expect to be a subject of expert

16 testimony, and this witness, as she testified earlier on direct
17 examination, is a psychologist. I'm not saying that there is
18 anything to take up at this moment, but before she had taken

19 the stand and the parties had conferred, we were asked that she
20 wasn't going to be -- we were asked by Ms. Menninger to make
21 sure that she wasn't going to be testifying about things in
22 that area.
23 So I just wanted to flag that she is testifying as a
24 lay witness and that she shouldn't be asked questions on cross
25 examination that would be the subject of expert testimony.
