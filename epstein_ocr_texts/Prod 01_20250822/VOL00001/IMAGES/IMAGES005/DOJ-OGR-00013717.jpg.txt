LCGACmax5, A. Earmer - cross
AETERNOON SESSION
1:30 p.m,

THE COURT: All right. Matters to take tip, counsel?

MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, just briefly from the
government, my not amazing math skills, but T note that T ‘think
that the witness who's been on. cross examination now for about
the Same amotint of time that she was on direct examination, it
would be helpful for scheduling purposes to know when. we can
expect to have the néxt witness reddy.

MS. MENNINGER:: I don't know, your Honor, An. hour,

MS; POMERANTZ:: Thank you, your Honor.

And the other questiion, I just -- rather not a

quédstion, just, oné thing I wanted to flag. I believe that, on
cross examination, the witness was asked some questions about
hindsight. bias, which I expect to be a subject of expert
testimony, and this witmess, as she testified earlier on direct

examination, is a psychol6gist,. I'm not saying that there is

anything to take up at this moment, but before she had taken

the stand and the parties had conferred, we were askéd that she

wasn't. going to be we were asked, by Ms. Menninger to make
Suré that. shé wasn't going to be testifying about. things in
that area.

So I just wanted to flag that she is testifying as a4

lay witness and that she shouldn*t be asked questions on cross

examination that would be the subject of expert testimony.
