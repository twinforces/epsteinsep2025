Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 749 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 177 of 236 1081
LC3KMAX6 Parkinson —- Direct

1 Special Agent Maguire was going to offer that I don't believe

2 is being objected to.

3 Never mind, your Honor, I'm being told -- never mind.
4 THE COURT: All right.

a With respect to the items, either the physical items

6 or the photographs of the school costumes, as I indicated — and
7 I think the ruling I'm making now is fully consistent with that
8 — it has to be tied through a witness as to similarity of items
9 seen at the time. And that was what I ruled before about

10 those, which is why you can lay the foundation through Maguire,
11 and if it's temporally tied back, I imagine I would admit it,
12 depending on that testimony; same theory here.

13 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.

14 MS. COMEY: Understood, your Honor. Thank you.

15 THE COURT: All right.

16 Are these for me or for the witness?

17 MR. EVERDELL: Those are for you, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

19 MR. EVERDELL: It should be three, for the next three
20 witnesses. Sorry I couldn't get one for your Honor's deputy.
al THE COURT: All right. So we can bring the witness
22 back and we can get the jury.
23 THE WITNESS: Good afternoon, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: Good afternoon, Mr. Parkinson. You may
25 take your seat. Thank you.
