6 BY MS. COMEY:

7 Q. While Ms. Drescher puts these up on the screen for the

8 jury, Mr. Visoski, could you tell us, for Government Exhibit

9 310, the photo on the right, could you tell us what we see in
10 that photo?

11 A. In that photo, that's the one with the aircraft in it?

12 Q. Yes.

13 A. That appears to be a photo of -- it was probably the late
14 "90s, mid to late '90s, Mr. Epstein purchased that twin engine
15 Cessna 421, and he had a runway at the ranch. So that photo

16 appears to be taken at the ranch at one of the ends of the

17 runway, judging by the square, you know, the asphalt bottom

18 with the square on top there, because it was a dirt runway and
19 at the end of the runway, there was an asphalt base to turn the
20 aircraft around.
21 But in the photo, obviously, it's a picture of me with
22 the luggage and Mr. Epstein and Ms. Kellen.
23 MS. COMEY: Thank you. We can take that down,
24 Ms. Drescher.
25 I would like to now pull up for the witness, the
