1 THE COURT: Yes, that's on my to-do list today, this

2 morning, which is to give you my view of the limiting

i) instruction, which I can do now.

4 So we last talked about this at the November 23rd

5 conference, and I think the defense agreed with the Limiting

6 instruction. The government had suggested changes, which I

7 rejected, but I understood the government's position that it

8 wasn't fully accurate as stated, and that's because of

9 complications around New Mexico law, potentially.

10 If we need to go into further issues that implicate

11 412, we can do sidebar, but I think for purposes of the

12 Limiting instruction, here's my thinking, and I may not need

13 you to react immediately to it unless you want to, but you can
14 consider it and think about it.

15 I think an appropriate Limiting instruction would be:
16 "T anticipate that you'll hear testimony from the next witness
17 about sexual conduct that she said she had with Mr. Epstein in
18 New Mexico. I instruct you that the sexual conduct she says

19 occurred with Mr. Epstein in New Mexico was not, quote, illegal
20 sexual activity, end quote, as the government has charged in
21 the indictment.
22 "T'll give you more instructions on the legal term,
23 illegal sexual activity, at the end of the case. However, to
24 the extent you conclude that her testimony is relevant to the
25 issues before you, you may consider it, but you may not
