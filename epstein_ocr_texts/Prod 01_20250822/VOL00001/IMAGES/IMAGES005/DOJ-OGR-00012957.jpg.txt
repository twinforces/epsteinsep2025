LC6VMAX6 Maguire - direct

1 A. This would be the grand staircase of the residence and the

2 main foyer. If you look to the left-hand side of the

3 photograph, that would be the entryway through the double set

4 of doors in Exhibit 933 that you would have passed through.

5 Q. I believe a moment ago you described this as the grand

6 staircase. Were there other staircases within the residence?

7 A. Yes, ma'am.

8 Q. Could you please describe those for the jury.

9 A. There was an additional staircase that was on the second
10 floor that went up to the third or fourth floor. It was blue
11 in color and spiral. There was also a utility stairwell that
12 mimicked a fire escape that went throughout the height of the
13 residence.

14 Q. Aside from the staircases that you just described, were
15 there any other ways to get from floor to floor within the
16 residence?
17 A. There was also an elevator present in the residence.
18 MS. MOE: Your Honor, if we could please publish
19 what's now in evidence as Government Exhibit 911-R.
20 THE COURT: You may.
21 Q. Special Agent Maguire, what are we looking at here?
22 A. This is just another angle of this main foyer area now in
23 this photograph, the entryway, where the large set of double
24 doors would be visible here, these staircases to the left-hand
25 side of the photograph.
