1 MS. MENNINGER: They were not at the office yet in

2 Colorado when I reached out to the office.

3 THE COURT: Okay. I'll step down.

4 (Recess)

5) THE COURT: Where are we?

6 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I believe the defense is not

7 going to stipulate, but I'll let them speak for themselves.

8 MS. MENNINGER: That's right.

9 THE COURT: Okay. Then we should definitely get

10 going.

11 MR. PAGLIUCA: I'll get the next witness, if that's

12 all right.

13 THE COURT: We'll bring in the jury and then get the
14 witness ready to come in.

15 Ms. Menninger, the Rule 17 subpoena return date when
16 for the witness who isn't here?

17 MS. MENNINGER: The subpoena return date was for the
18 first day of trial. And for each one of them we communicated
19 to place them on call because we didn't know when we would need
20 them, and we didn't want them to have to wait here, so --
21 THE COURT: Okay. First day of trial.
22 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: Okay.
24 So the witness should just wait to be called.
25 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, if I may complete that
