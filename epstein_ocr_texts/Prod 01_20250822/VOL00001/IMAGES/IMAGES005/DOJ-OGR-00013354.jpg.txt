4 MS. MOE: Your Honor, on that subject, because the

5 messages are ordered sequentially, the rule only requires that
6 the record is made at or near the time of the offense recorded,

10 shows that these are sequentially kept messages that are kept
11 at or near the time of those events. They are in chronological
12 order and that's all that the rule requires.

24 were instructed to take messages from phone calls as they came
25 in. Mr. Pagliuca's point is to weight and not authenticity or
