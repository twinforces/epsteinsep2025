LC6VMAX4

1 MR. ROHRBACH: One matter to take up, your Honor,

2 before the jury comes in.

3 After conferring with the defense we just wanted to

4 make sure we fully understood the Court's ruling this morning

a about one piece of the testimony related to the New York

6 search.

7 The government's understanding of the Court's ruling

8 is that the government is not going to offer exhibits that

9 depict either images of celebrities or images of nude or

10 semi-nude people inside the house; but it is going to elicit

11 testimony from the witness that she observed those two

12 categories of images. We just want to make sure that both of
13 those were consistent with -- both of those pieces of testimony
14 would be consistent with the Court's ruling.

15 THE COURT: You can ask the witness testimony about

16 what she saw at the relevant time period.

17 On the celebrity piece, I understood you to say you

18 weren't moving in that exhibit; that is a desk with photos of
19 Epstein with celebrities. Was that a misunderstanding?
20 MR. ROHRBACH: No, that is correct, your Honor.
21 THE COURT: I didn't rule on that, but your question
22 is may you ask the witness about photos she saw?
23 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes. So my understanding is we're
24 going to just ask at a relatively high level of generality, but
25 both photos she saw and the nude artwork she observed.
