The government's, understanding of the Cotirt's ruling
igs that the ggvernment is. not going tq offer exhibits that

dépict either images of celebrities or images, of nude or

semi-nude people inside the house; but it 1s going to elicit
testimony from the witness that she observed those two
categories of images. We just want to make sune that both of
those were Consistent with == both of those pieces of testiniony
would be consistent with the Court's ruling.

weren't moving in that exhibit; that. is a desk with photos of
Epstein with celebrities. Was that a misunderstanding?
