1 THE COURT: It wasn't tested?

2 MS. COMEY: It was not tested.

3 THE COURT: Or preserved in any way?

4 MS. COMEY: It was not, your Honor. It was

a corroborative of the testimony already received and testimony I
6 expect will come later in this trial.

7 THE COURT: What about the timeframe issue?

8 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think it's still

9 corroborative that these massages were sexual. The fact that
10 Jeffrey Epstein's massages were sexual, even if it was just a
11 year after the end of the conspiracy, is still probative of

12 whether or not these massages were just massages, as I expect
13 the defense will argue the defendant believed, or were, in

14 fact, sexual. We think it is highly probative.

15 THE COURT: I would permit lab tests that indicated it
16 was semen, but in light of the essentially lay description in
17 combination with the timeframe issue, I'll sustain this

18 objection.

19 MS. COMEY: Understood, your Honor.
20 MR. EVERDELL: Thank you, your Honor. I think that's
2l everything we have for Parkinson.
22 MS. COMEY: There was one logistical issue, which is
23 we will be offering this video under seal because it contains
24 images of witnesses who your Honor has permitted to testify
25 under pseudonym and nude images of third parties. We will need
