1 asked for before, last sentence, "Count Four relates solely to
2 Jane and the time period --"

3 THE COURT: Okay. I'll accept that.

4 Page 15, line 20, the sentence that begins, "Count

5 Four," adding "solely" after "relates," so the sentence would

6 read, "Count Four relates solely to Jane."

7 Okay. Next?

8 MR. EVERDELL: Page 16, line 2, similar request:

9 "Count Six relates solely to Carolyn."

10 THE COURT: Okay. I'll accept that.

11 Page 16, last line, adding "solely" after "relates"

12 and before "to Carolyn."

13 Okay. Next page.

14 MR. EVERDELL: Page 17, this is a small one, your

15 Honor.

16 THE COURT: Okay.

17 MR. EVERDELL: Lines 2 to 3, "Bach count charges the
18 defendant," since we're using "Ms. Maxwell" in the other parts
19 of this charge, we'll just say, "Each count charges Ms. Maxwell
20 with a different crime."
21 THE COURT: All right. That's fine.
22 So instruction 11, page 17, line 3, changing
23 "defendant" to "Ms. Maxwell." So the sentence reads, "Each
24 count charges Ms. Maxwell with a different crime."
25 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, can I just have one moment.
