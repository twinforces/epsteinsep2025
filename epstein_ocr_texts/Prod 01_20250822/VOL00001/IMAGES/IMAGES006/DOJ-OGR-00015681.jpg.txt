Thanks for the quick response. I do want you to make sure that Jerome is working for us after his normal working hours
then. I give him an additional sum of money specifically to work for us which includes going to JE's mothers hse every
Saturday. I would like you to talk to John about this after we have left. If Jerome is not giving us extra hours I need to
review what we do w/him or talk to him and give him an opportunity to do the extra time - probably you should take to him
first.
Thanks

PS
The universal remote control for the big TV next to my desk has no batteries and the other romotes do not appear to be
working. Worse the TV still is not mended, everything appears in double. I thought that this had been mended? and if not
why not and when???

I'm ALSO at a loss...!!!

John and I specifically talked last week about how important these details

are. About two weeks ago I faxed your check off lists to John in preparation

for the manual. These are the lists you made and I'd say they are at least

3/4 complete. (This is the third time I've reviewed these lists with him

since I've started.) He stated the lists are complete although I definitely

want to add to them and edit them as your needs change.

He also assured me that he checks the lists prior to each visit. He showed

me a white notebook (maybe 6 weeks ago?) on the shelves in the kitchen where

he keeps the lists that he checks off, signs and dates before each visit.

FIVE of the six items you mentioned are on the list! I'm not sure about #5

(are you referring the changing the ink cartridge?) John CLEARLY

understands he is to check Mr. E's computer prior to each arrival. I'm

quite sure of this because we've discussed it several times and as recently

as my visit last week.

As for as your second email, the Band-Aids are on the list titled "Supplies

needed in the house at all times" which is part of his check off list.

Our Household Manual draft does indicate where to purchase "cleaning

supplies‚Äù (Publix and Sam's Club-PB Gardens) and states "use only Tide with

bleach, downy softener(switch fragrance every 2-3 month), bounce dryer

sheets" We did edit and review this information last week however we have

not completed an inventory list/check off list of supplies yet. | GOVERNMENT

I believe we have a GOOD start on the manual but it's certainly not up to ana

our standards and needs further work and detail. I'd really like to add isn Gea ant

more detail prior to making a change in Management. If we had uninterrupted
