LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 Did the government show Jane photos of any of these

2 women that they got in their address book now and say, hey, is
3 this the one you were in a group sexualized massage with, they
4 haven't done it, they haven't done it since they got those

5 names two years ago.

6 And just because I point out a few big problems with

7 the big parts of the story, don't be confused, Jane's story is
8 wrong, wrong, wrong on many, many points. She gave you a

9 description of the Palm Beach house. She said this massage

10 room that she went to hundreds of times, hundreds of times was
11 in the massage room that was off the master bathroom, and that
12 the house itself had creepy looking animals. We all sat

13 through the floor plan discussion that went on and on, and you
14 know what, there's not a massage room off the master bathroom.
15 The master bathroom was the massage room. So if she had been
16 there hundreds of times, do you think she would have gotten

17 that wrong?

18 She said it had a light beachy feel. It was light

19 because it was off the master bathroom and it had like a beachy
20 feel. What was in the room, I don't think I saw anything past
al the massage table. You recall a massage room that was attached
22 to the bathroom, correct, that's my memory, yes. We saw the
23 room attached to the bathroom, it's a closet. We saw the floor
24 plan. There is no massage room off the master bathroom. And
25 we saw the bathroom, which is hardly a light beachy feel with
