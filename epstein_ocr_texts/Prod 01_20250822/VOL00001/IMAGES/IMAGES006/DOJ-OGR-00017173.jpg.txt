LeEKCmax7 Summation — Ms. Menninger

charges against her. And Ms. Maxwell doés not have to prove

her innocence to you. You already know it to be true as you

sit there. Tt. is 'thé government's burden 'to prove each elémént

of each. of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. Those of
you that! have worked in regulatory jobs or banking or finance
will be familiar with regulations and how there are knit—picky
rtiles. The Judgé is going to give yoti the law. That's the law
that you'll follow. You'll get those instructions and you need
to follow those riiles, each one of ‘them, very carefully,
because if the government has. failed to prove any element of.
any count. beyond a reasonable doubt, no matter how silly 6r
small it might. seem to. you, the Judge will instruct you, you
havé to acquit. You 6nly convitt if you find the burden of
proof has been met as to each element. of. each count.

Reasonable do6ubt. is something I've talked a little bit
about and the Judge, I expect, will give you the instruction
that you seé here. S6 I'm just trying to point out a couple of
pieces of it, but obviously you'll need, to read, the entire

instruction and listen to all of the Judgé's instructions

because they're all i2mportant. But when you're weighing the
credibility of the witnesses that you've Heard from and you're

evaluating whether the government jhas. met its. burden of proof

as to each elément of each Count, you are to weigh whether or
not the government Has satisfied their proof beyond a
reasonable doubt.
