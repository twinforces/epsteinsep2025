LCKCmax7 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 charges against her. And Ms. Maxwell does not have to prove

2 her innocence to you. You already know it to be true as you

3 sit there. It is the government's burden to prove each element
4 of each of these crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. Those of

5 you that have worked in regulatory jobs or banking or finance

6 will be familiar with regulations and how there are knit-â€”-picky
7 rules. The Judge is going to give you the law. That's the law
8 that you'll follow. You'll get those instructions and you need
9 to follow those rules, each one of them, very carefully,
10 because if the government has failed to prove any element of
11 any count beyond a reasonable doubt, no matter how silly or
12 small it might seem to you, the Judge will instruct you, you
13 have to acguit. You only convict if you find the burden of
14 proof has been met as to each element of each count.
15 Reasonable doubt is something I've talked a little bit
16 about and the Judge, I expect, will give you the instruction
17 that you see here. So I'm just trying to point out a couple of
18 pieces of it, but obviously you'll need to read the entire
19 instruction and listen to all of the Judge's instructions
20 because they're all important. But when you're weighing the
21 credibility of the witnesses that you've heard from and you're
22 evaluating whether the government has met its burden of proof
23 as to each element of each count, you are to weigh whether or
24 not the government has satisfied their proof beyond a
25 reasonable doubt.
