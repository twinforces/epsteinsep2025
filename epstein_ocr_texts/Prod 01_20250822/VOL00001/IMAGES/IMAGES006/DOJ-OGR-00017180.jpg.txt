1 preclude any arguments to the jury that the defendant was a

2 substitute for Jeffrey Epstein. That's the exact argument that
3 Ms. Menninger advanced to the jury in closing, which the Court
4 precluded.

a THE COURT: Not with respect to motivation for the

6 witness's testimony. There is a reason I gave -- for both

7 sides, you've both now done this, which is basically to reargue
8 sort of precisely the line that I crafted and ruled on in my

9 pretrial rulings. I have maintained those lines throughout

10 trial with a couple of exceptions where there was a little bit
11 of door opening and the like, but I don't have in mind, yes,

12 they made the argument that Epstein's death is a factor in the
13 motivation for the changing the stories, which is what I said
14 was â€”-- to the extent that arguments go to the credibility of

15 witnesses, that's where I drew the line.

16 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. I was referring to the

17 argument early in Ms. Menninger's summation about I took to

18 mean an argument that the government was substituting

19 Ms. Maxwell for Mr. Epstein. Again, we want to review the
20 transcript, but that's how we heard it.
21 There were also arguments throughout summation about
22 the victims doing that, which I understand the Court has ruled
23 on that there is a difference between those two, but we think
24 where that crosses the line is an argument where the government
25 is doing that.
