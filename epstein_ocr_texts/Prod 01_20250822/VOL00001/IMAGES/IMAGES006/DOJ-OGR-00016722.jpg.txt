LCGVMAX7 Hyppolite - direct

1 THE COURT: All right.

2 So I'll get the defense's response to the motion to

3 preclude on that this evening.

4 And so what is tomorrow looking like?

S MS. MENNINGER: I think we will be done, your Honor.

6 I am looking at my co-counsel. We've had to -- we have to make
7 a couple of inquiries because your Honor ruled this morning on
8 anonymity, and there may be some other issues that we have to

9 figure out whether that will carry forward to Monday or not.

10 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, sorry to interrupt.

11 There may be one witness that does carry over to

12 Monday. We have to figure that out. But our goal, I think, is
13 to try to wrap up, with the exception of this one potential

14 witness, by tomorrow.

15 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, may I have a moment?

16 THE COURT: Yes.

17 (Counsel conferred)

18 MR. EVERDELL: I think if we went over in the morning,
19 even if we had this one witness, it would be very brief, so we
20 could have almost a full day on Monday.
21 THE COURT: Okay.
22 So finishing tomorrow or a very short witness on
23 Monday means closings on Monday and then charge and to the
24 jury. Okay. I'll permit that so long as it does not interfere
25 with that schedule.
