1 repeatedly relied on rule 613(a), which uses different language
2 and is about impeachment by prior inconsistent statement on

i) cross examination, not introduction of a prior statement as

4 extrinsic evidence as it seeks to do here.

5 So the opportunity to explain the statement should

6 consist of something more than just the opportunity to admit or
7 deny making the statement. That's right in Miller, 28 Federal
8 Practice and Procedure Evidence, Section 6205, Note 1, Second

9 Edition 2021. Citing a Seventh Circuit case and an Eleventh

10 Circuit case.

11 Now I'm going to quote from Gulani again. A trial

12 court has discretion to require satisfaction of the latter

13 requirement before the extrinsic evidence is offered or

14 alternatively to permit it to be satisfied by recalling the

15 witness after the extrinsic evidence is received.

16 In a case called Surdow, S-u-r-d-o-w, the Second

17 Circuit stated that the district court has broad discretion to
18 exclude extrinsic impeachment evidence that was not revealed

19 while the witness was on the stand or at least before the
20 witness was permitted to leave the court. That's United States
21 v. Surdow, 121 F.Appx. 898 (2d Cir. 2005), collecting
22 authorities.
23 Therefore, the Court will sustain the government's
24 objection as to all proposed prior inconsistent statements to
25 which the witness was not presented with the statement to
