1 sometimes they're witnesses, and they're not the victim

2 themselves, but -—-

3 Q. Now, after the acquisition stage, is anything that happens
4 after the event, whichever constitutes the event occurs,

a considered retention stage?

6 A. Typically, yes. It's after the event is over, so we say,
7 well, that's the retention stage. I don't mean to complicate
8 things too much, but I think you can appreciate that actually
9 there can be many acts of retrieval. So there can be a long
10 retention interval peppered with different acts of retrieval.
11 But I used a simple diagram here to illustrate the three major
12 stages.

13 Q. Can you simply identify what separate acts of retrieval

14 would be.

15 A. So after some event, say, you know, a robbery, sometimes
16 people might have a conversation with each other about what

17 they saw and then sometimes the police might come to the scene
18 and start asking questions about what did you see or what did
19 you hear, and then the person might go to a police station and
20 maybe try to make an identification of somebody who might have
21 been seen at the event, and then somebody may be interviewed
22 many more times, may then testify at trial. That would be a
23 standard situation in a legally relevant event.
24 Q. Now, in each of those retrieval examples you just gave,
25 that is coming from an external source; correct?
