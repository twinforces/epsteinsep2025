2 THE COURT: Before I start, I want to make a record

3 because I said, door open.

4 The defense expressly attempted to suggest impeachment
5 of the witness, that she had indicated the handholding on the

6 victim's compensation form as sexual abuse. So I allowed that
7 question. In light of that door opening, I don't think she'd

8 tread it into expert testimony in any way, but it was directly
9 responsive to a series of questions that the defense put at

10 issue by her description of the earlier conduct as handholding.
11 So that's the record I'm making.

12 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, may I make a very brief --
13 THE COURT: You're welcome to make a record. I wanted
14 to explain why I said, door opened.

15 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor. I had asked

16 the witness a number of questions about her statements to law
17 enforcement where she said she does not remember it being

18 sexualized and I was not allowed to ask those questions about
19 those not being sexualized touches.
20 THE COURT: The record is what it is. That's not the
21 Court's memory.
22 MS. MENNINGER: It's my memory, and I understand —-
23 THE COURT: -- asked repeatedly, that's true, and I
24 didn't allow it to be asked if it was not a prior inconsistent
25 statement, but I didn't preclude that area from being explored.
