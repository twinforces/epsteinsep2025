1 (Jury not present)

2 THE COURT: You may be seated. Matters to take up?

3 MS. COMEY: No, your Honor.

4 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim?

S MS. STERNHEIM: No.

6 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, just on choreography again,
7 we are going to put the binder up when cross begins as a backup
8 option. When the time comes to hand the jury the folders --

9 THE COURT: Are we going to get to cross? How long is
10 the direct?

11 MS. COMEY: It's at least an hour.

12 Your Honor, that does remind we, we have binders of

13 sealed exhibits for the jurors. I do anticipate looking at one
14 sealed exhibit during the direct testimony. May we pass those
15 binders out while the jurors are on a break or would you prefer
16 that we wait until that point in the testimony?

17 THE COURT: So, it's a binder that has multiple

18 exhibits, but one that you anticipate and the defense has it?
19 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor, the defense has seen this
20 binder.
2l THE COURT: Any objection, Mr. Everdell?
22 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: So you want to put the binders under the
24 chairs?
25 MS. COMEY: Yes, please, your Honor.
