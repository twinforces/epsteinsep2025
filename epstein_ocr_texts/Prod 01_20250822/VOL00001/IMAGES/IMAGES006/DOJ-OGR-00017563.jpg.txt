LBUCmax5 Jane - direct

1 MS. MENNINGER: Objection. Hearsay, your Honor. That

2 was a different question.

3 THE COURT: I'll sustain. If you reframe the question

4 to elicit the information you indicated as opposed to asking

S what her mother said, you may proceed.

6 MS. MOE: Your Honor, if I could just have one moment?

7 THE COURT: You may.

8 MS. MOE: Your Honor, could we briefly approach?

9 THE COURT: Why don't we take our midafternoon break,
10 because the jurors' snacks are here and it's time for that. So
11 we'll take an approximately 10-minute break, members of the
12 jury. Thank you. See you in about 10 minutes.
