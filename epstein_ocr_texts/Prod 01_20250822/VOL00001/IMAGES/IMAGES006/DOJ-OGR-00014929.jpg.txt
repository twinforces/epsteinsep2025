1 A. Sure. I think that certain things -- some psychologists

2 use clinical judgment on whether or not a perpetrator's

3 behaviors are considered grooming. But that certainly doesn't
4 at all reference the scientific literature to determine what is
5 and is not considered grooming. In addition, we also have data
6 that's been provided by offenders themselves.

7 In terms of reliability and validity of these

8 judoments, the validity in psychological science refers to the
9 degree to which you are measuring this particular thing, what
10 you think you're measuring. So for example, the degree to

11 which there is significant overlap between what victims say

12 they experience and what offenders say that they have done

13 provides us with a measure of validity.

14 The degree to which different groups of individuals,
15 whether that's groups of professionals or groups of victims

16 agree in studies what it is that -- the process, what kinds of
17 behaviors, what's been done to the victim, what kinds of

18 behaviors are associated with the grooming process, to the

19 extent those professionals agree, that's a measure of
20 reliability. Because you're getting different studies,
21 different groups, different samples where there's significant
ae overlap in what this dynamic and what this concept is.

25 the first two sentences, so "Currently."
