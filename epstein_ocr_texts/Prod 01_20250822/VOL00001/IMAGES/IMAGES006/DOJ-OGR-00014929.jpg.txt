A. Sure. I think that certain things -- some psychologists
use clinical judgment on whether or not a perpetrator's
behaviors are considered grooming. But that certainly doesn't
at all ‘reference the scientific literature ‘to determine what is
and is not considered grooming. In addition, we also have data
that's been provided by offenders themselves.

In terms of reliability and validity of these
judgments, the validity in psychological science refers to the
degree to which you are measuring this particular thing, what
you think, you're measuring. So for example, the degree to
which there is significant overlap between what, victims say
they experience and what offenders say that they have done
provides us with a measure of validity.

The degree to which different groups of individuals,
whether that's groups of professionals or groups of victims
agree in studies what it is that =- the process; what kinds of
behaviors, what's been done to the victim, what, kinds of
behaviors are associated with the grooming process; to the
extent those professionals agree, that's a measure of
reliability. Because you're getting different studies,
different groups, different samples where there's significant
overlap in what this dynamic and what this concept is.
