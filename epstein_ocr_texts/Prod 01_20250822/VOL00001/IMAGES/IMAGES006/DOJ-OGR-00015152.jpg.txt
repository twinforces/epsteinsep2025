None of these cases involved the secondhand, summary-witness testimony of law enforcement
agents. None involved testimony that, by the time of the motion, had already come to light as a
result of trial testimony by percipient witnesses on the indictment returned by the grand jury.

The Government has not cited any case finding such materials to present a “special
circumstance” that justifies the exceptional step of unsealing grand jury materials. There is none.

The one colorable argument under that doctrine for unsealing in this case, in fact, is that
doing so would expose as disingenuous the Government’s public explanations for moving to
unseal. A member of the public, appreciating that the Maxwell grand jury materials do not
contribute anything to public knowledge, might conclude that the Government’s motion for their
unsealing was aimed not at “transparency” but at diversion—aimed not at full disclosure but at
the illusion of such. And there is precedent—/n re Biaggi, the fountainhead of the Second
Circuit’s “special circumstances” doctrine—permitting a court to order the release of grand jury
testimony to correct a movant’s misleading public characterization of it.

In re Biaggi arose from a motion by a mayoral candidate, Mario Biaggi, to reveal his
earlier grand jury testimony, ostensibly to rebut a news report that he had invoked the Fifth
Amendment. 478 F.2d at 490-91. Denying he had done so, Biaggi asked, on television and later
in a motion, that the court examine his testimony and publicly confirm that he had claimed no
constitutional privileges. /d. at 491. The Government moved for disclosure of Biaggi’s
testimony, redacted to protect others’ names, and the district court granted that motion; Biaggi
appealed, seeking disclosure of his testimony without redactions. /d. The Second Circuit, per
Chief Judge Friendly, authorized disclosure of the testimony, emphasizing that Biaggi and the
Government had waived objections to disclosure, and that others’ interests could be protected by
