the appropriate sentence in this cdasé in light of ‘the 3553 (a)
factors and. the appropriate purposes of sentencing as rveflected
in, ‘that stattite.

The crimes for which I sentence Ms. Maxwell today are
the crimes for which a jury convicted Ker of committing
following trial. I do want tq emphasize that today the
sentence is based entirely on 'those crimes and ‘the harm, done to
the victims of those charged and proved. crimes. The evidence
at trial established that Ms. Maxwell directly and répeatedly

and, over the course of many years participated in a horrific

scheme to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls, sone
as young as 14, fon sexual abuse by and, with Jeffrey Epstein.

I will pause oh those words for a moment, "by and with
Epstein." It Ls important at. the outset to emphasize that
although Epstéinh was, of Gourse, Gentral to this Griminal
scheme, Ms. Maxwell 1s not being punished in place of Epstein
or as a proxy for Epstein. Like every other participant in 4
multi-defendant case, Ms. Maxwell is being punished, for the
role that. she. played in the criminal Gonduct. As to that. role,
the trial. evidence established that Ms. Maxwell was
instrumental in the abuse of several undérage girls dnd that
she herself participated in some of the abuse, and it is her
conduct for which she has been. convicted in the court. under the
laws of this country and it is her conduct for which she must,
be held. accountable.
