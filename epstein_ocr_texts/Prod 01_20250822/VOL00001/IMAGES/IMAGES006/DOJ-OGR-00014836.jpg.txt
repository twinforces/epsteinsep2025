1 the appropriate sentence in this case in light of the 3553(a)

2 factors and the appropriate purposes of sentencing as reflected
3 in that statute.

4 The crimes for which I sentence Ms. Maxwell today are
a the crimes for which a jury convicted her of committing

6 following trial. I do want to emphasize that today the

7 sentence is based entirely on those crimes and the harm done to
8 the victims of those charged and proved crimes. The evidence

9 at trial established that Ms. Maxwell directly and repeatedly
10 and over the course of many years participated in a horrific

11 scheme to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls, some
12 as young as 14, for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein.
13 I will pause on those words for a moment, "by and with
14 Epstein." It is important at the outset to emphasize that

15 although Epstein was, of course, central to this criminal

16 scheme, Ms. Maxwell is not being punished in place of Epstein
17 or aS a proxy for Epstein. Like every other participant in a
18 multi-defendant case, Ms. Maxwell is being punished for the

19 role that she played in the criminal conduct. As to that role,
20 the trial evidence established that Ms. Maxwell was
21 instrumental in the abuse of several underage girls and that
22 she herself participated in some of the abuse, and it is her
23 conduct for which she has been convicted in the court under the
24 laws of this country and it is her conduct for which she must
25 be held accountable.
