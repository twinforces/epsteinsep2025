. Re: Unsealing of Grand Jury Transcripts in U.S. v. Epstein, 19-cr-490 (RMB)
and U.S. vy. Maxwell, 20-cr-330 (PAE)
Dear SDNY Victim and Witness Coordinator:

represented a victim identified as Jane Doe in U.S. v. Maxwell, 20-cr-330. Please be
advised I am hereby joining in the letter submitted to you previously on August 5, 2025 on
behalf of victim Annie Farmer by her attorney Sigrid McCawley.

With that said, | am strongly opposed to any portions of the grand jury transcripts being
released that would in any way identify the victims. If any materials are released, the victims’ “
names and other identifying information should be redacted.

Very truly yours, :
Robert S. Glassman
