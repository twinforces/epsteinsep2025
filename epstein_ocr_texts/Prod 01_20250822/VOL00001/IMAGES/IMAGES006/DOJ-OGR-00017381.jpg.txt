1 BY MS. COMEY:

2 Q. In total approximately how many acres was Mr. Epstein's

3 ranch?

4 A. It was approximately 10,000 acres. I know there was some

5 state land included in it, but everybody said it was around

6 10,000 acres.

7 Q. And all of the structures you just described, were they all
8 located on that property owned by Mr. Epstein?

9 A. Yes.
10 Q. Have you been inside the main house on the ranch property?
11 A. Yes, I have.
12 Q. For what purpose?
13 A. Several purposes. A lot of the times -- it was on occasion
14 I would meet with Mr. Epstein and discuss future aircraft
15 maintenance or purchases for the aircraft. And then other
16 times would be to pick up and drop off luggage. And that was
17 another residence that I installed a lot of the home theater
18 and audio equipment. He was an audiophile, so he liked very
19 high-quality music; so I installed a home theater, like I had
20 done at the other properties as well.
al MS. COMEY: Ms. Drescher, can we please pull up
22 Government Exhibits 323 and 706 for the witness, the Court, and
23 the parties.
24 Q. Mr. Visoski, do you recognize these?
25 A. Yes.
