1 record that relates to that topic. So I think that --

2 THE COURT: So the defense has questioned multiple

3 witnesses on their perceptions of individual ages, of relevant
4 individuals' ages, so that puts into question the knowledge

5 element with respect to ages, and it's true there's testimony

6 from each of the alleged victims as to what they told

7 Ms. Maxwell, but of course I don't know whether the jury will

8 accept that testimony or not, or any of those individual pieces
9 of testimony. So it seems like having -- the question here is
10 whether there are specific elements, knowledge elements that

11 are in issue, either because it's what some of the evidence

12 goes to or because the defense has made cross-points or will

13 make arguments regarding that. I mean, I don't suppose it's

14 the case that the defense won't -- will it not argue during

15 closing anything with respect to whether Ms. Maxwell knew of

16 the relevant ages?

17 MS. STERNHEIM: May we have a moment, Judge?

18 THE COURT: Sure.

19 MR. PAGLIUCA: Here's the -- I'm going to try to
20 address -- there's a larger concern. I need to break this into
21 two pieces.
22 THE COURT: OK.
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: One that I view as an evidentiary issue
24 with the indictment and the evidence in the case is that there
25 was testimony about multiple females being at the Palm Beach
