1 restrictions placed upon the type of experiments that a

2 psychologist is allowed to perform?

3 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection.

4 THE COURT: Overruled.

5 A. Yes, you did.

6 Q. And please explain to the jury why that is.

7 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection.

8 Asked and answered, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: T'll allow it.

10 A. The human subjects review committees at universities and

11 colleges are in place to try to protect human beings from being
12 involved in experiments that might be harmful to them. And so
13 that is why these committees will review your proposal for a

14 piece of research and either allow you to go forward with your
15 proposal or not allow you to go forward or suggest

16 modifications that would allow you to go forward.

17 But their interest is in making sure -- or trying to
18 ensure that you're not doing something to harm the research --
19 that might harm the research participants. That's why we
20 would, as I thought I indicated earlier in my testimony, would
21 not be probably, you know, allowed to deliberately plant
22 memories of sexual abuse.
23 Q. On cross-examination, the government had suggested that you
24 are a profiteer when you testify for the defense. Do you
25 remember that?
