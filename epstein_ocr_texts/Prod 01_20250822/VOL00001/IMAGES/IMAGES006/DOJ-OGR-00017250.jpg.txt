LCKCmax9 Charge

the oné hand — and which I just explained 'to you — and knowing
the specific objective of the conspiracy on the other, You may

consider conscious avoidance in deciding whether the defendant

knew the objective of a conspiracy, that is whether she

reasonably believed that theré was a high probability ‘that a
geal of the conspiracy was to commit the crime charged. as
objects of the conspiracy and ‘took, délibeérate and Gonsciotis
action to avoid confirming that fact,. but participated in the
conspiracy anyway. BUt Conscious, avoidance carinot be used as. a
substitute for finding that the defendant knowingly and
intentiondlly joined the conspiracy in the first place. It is
logically impossible for a, defendant to intend to agree to join

a conSpirdcy if she d6es not actually know it exists.

In sum, if you find the defendant believed, there was a
high probability that. a fact was so and that the defendant todk
deliberate and conscious action to avoid learning the ‘truth of
the fact, you may find that the defendant acted knowingly with

respect to that fact. However, if you find that the defendant

actually béliéved the fact was hot so, then you may nét find
that she has acted knowingly with mespect ‘to that fact.
