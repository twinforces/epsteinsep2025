1 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, at this point, because it
2 has only been three days, we believe that any suggestion that

3 they should stay later is beginning to sound like urging them

4 to hurry up, when clearly they know that they can deliberate as
S long as they want and they should be able to deliberate as long
6 as they want. They haven't expressed any hesitation. They've
7 been asking for transcripts, they've been asking for materials.
8 While we would not mind the Court giving an

9 instruction much like it did last week, telling the jurors that
10 should they choose to stay later on any given day, the Court

11 can make arrangements for them to do so, we would object to

12 trying to urge them to stay later if they are not asking to do
13 so and aren't expressing any difficulty in proceeding with the
14 deliberations that they are currently undertaking.

15 MS. MOE: Your Honor, the Court has previously

16 extended certain days or contracted certain days, depending on
17 our schedule; and, in fact, I think the first day of

18 deliberations we had an extended day on the consent of both

19 parties. We don't believe that sends any kind of signal, other
20 than that the Court is setting a schedule. And we think that's
al appropriate here given the circumstances.
22 THE COURT: I think what we should do, I'll tell them
23 that if deliberations are not complete starting tomorrow, I
24 would like you to make yourselves available to deliberate until
25 at least 6 p.m. each day. Of course, if you all agree to
