not entitled.to access to grand jury materials. See Fed. R. Critn. P, 6(€); see also, e.g.,, United
States v. Procter: & Gamble Co-.356 U.S.677, 682. (“Thfe} indispensable secrecy of grand jury.
proceedings must not be broken excépt-where'thére is a compelling necessity.” (citation

até presumptively. secret;-and.a defendant secking the disc losure-of grand ‘jury materials bears.a.
heavy burden.”). Post-trial motions by defendants seckinig ‘such aécess are almost itivariably

denied, for failure to. make'a showing of compelling necessity. i
