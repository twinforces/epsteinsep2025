AnGconsistent statements?

before this.

or anything else?

Is he just doing those two --

MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, that's it.

THE COURT: Okay. And, then who's after that?

Young.

THE GOURT: Okay:

MR. EVERDELL: And, then it's -- we have Eva Dubin.

THE GOURT: Okay:

Why don*t we do Richards and then Dubin, and see if
you can stipulate on Young. Does that make sense?
