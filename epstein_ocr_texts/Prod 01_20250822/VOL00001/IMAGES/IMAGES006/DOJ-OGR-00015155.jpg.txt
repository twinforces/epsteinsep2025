Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document809 Filed 08/11/25 Page 23 of 31

First, as the Second. Circuit has explained, the Government’s position is mainly’ relevant
becauseit reflects whether there is an. ongoing-need for grand jury secrecy. Sée/n re Craig, 131
F.3d at 106 (where “the government:supports a-motion. for disclosure, that should serve as.a
preliminary indication,that-the need for secrecy is not-especially strong”). But the central
infirmity of this motion:to Uunseal, docs. not concern, an ongoing néed ‘for scereéy in this case. The
infirmity: is that, as the Government has conceded, the Maxwell, grand:jury materials do not
reveal information outside the public domain.

Second, any: argument that the Government’s motion to unscal merits substantial
deference is weakened by a‘host-of irregularities with respect,to that motion. ‘That:motion was
not miade, nor has it been joined in, by any member of the Government’s trial team—the DOJ
lawyers presumably most familiar. with. the Maxwell. case and. the broader Epstcin-Maxwell
investigation. ‘The ‘motion. was filed by the DAG alonc, without.any signatory from: the U.S.
Attorncy’s Office in.this District. .And it was made under circumstances suggestive of haste
rather than, reflective deliberation. The: motion was three-and-a-half; pages in length; there were
no, supporting matcrials, filed, under seal or otherwise; the motion did. not-disclose (or reflect
awareness of) the summary-witness nature of the Maxwell grand jury’testimony; and the motion.
was ‘made without advance notice to'Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, a fact which, as reviewed
victims given. See Dkt. 789; Dkt. 796 at 9. ‘Finally, the:Government’s highlighting of the grand.
jury transcripts did not:suggest close familiarity with the Maxwell trial record, because a number
of details that it identified as non-public. in facet had been testified to during the trial. See note 16,
