LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 girlfriend/boyfriend looking photos of Ghislaine and Jeffrey.

2 Stephen Flatley. Let's take a minute on Stephen

3 Flatley. He's the computer forensic guy. And he's the one

4 that pulled the metadata that the government just showed you on
5 their closing. And they are trying to argue that these

6 documents, because they came from a computer that was loaded up
7 originally by Ghislaine Maxwell, that she wrote every document
8 on that computer. You know what's easy as can be, doesn't take
9 the FBI to do it? You just pull up the dates of that metadata
10 when those documents were created, and you look and see from

11 the flight logs where Ghislaine Maxwell was when those

12 documents were created. And she's in about four or five

13 different places. So whoever had that desktop computer Stephen
14 Flatley told you about wasn't carrying it with them on

15 airplanes.

16 And if other people could use that Ghislaine Maxwell
17 computer, what on earth makes the government think that

18 Ghislaine Maxwell was writing an essay about herself in the

19 third person with Jeffrey Epstein? You don't know about that
20 document. Not one single person told you what that document
21 is, where it came from. You got some metadata from a computer
22 that's clearly being used by a number of different people,
23 because Ghislaine Maxwell is not in the house when documents
24 are being created. But the FBI didn't put that together for
25 you. They want to just say, This is Ghislaine Maxwell's
