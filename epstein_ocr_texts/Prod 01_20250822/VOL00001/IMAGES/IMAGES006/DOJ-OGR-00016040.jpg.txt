Re: Scholarship Lodge Information
Date: 8/26/93
see RRP EARS
I have instructed Town and Country Log Homes to send you the
blueprints for the proposed scholarship lodges we anticipate
building on campus. Karen Sargent, a noted architect and
Interlochen Alumni from New Jersey, is in the process of modifying
the plans to incorporate wheel chair and handicap accessibility.
She will forward the plans to me upon completion.
The basic plan for one-half of the lodge is priced in the
neighborhood of $125,000 to $150,000, depending on the options
selected. Karen is also working on the cost for modifying the
, structure. I will send them on to you upon my return from Colorado
in mid-September.
I have spoken with Dean Boal and our Buildings and Grounds
Director. We believe the area next to Frohlich lodge is the
optimal spot for placement due to its location on the water and
accessibility for handicapped vehicles in the winter.
If you are interested in proceeding with the concept, I will be
happy to send a formal proposal upon my return.
All is well here, but a bit muggy.
Best wishes,
tja
