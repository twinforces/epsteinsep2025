1 instruction, instruction 55. The government can correct me if
2 I'm wrong. I don't think we had any testimony about preparing
3 witnesses, so I don't know if this instruction is necessary.

4 THE COURT: No. There was. For sure.

S MR. EVERDELL: OK. Maybe I'm mistaken about that.

6 THE COURT: "How many times did you meet with the

7 government?"

8 MR. EVERDELL: OK.

9 THE COURT: For example. Maybe every, every -â€”-

10 MR. EVERDELL: OK. I stand corrected.

11 THE COURT: Other than that, you've got it.

12 MR. EVERDELL: Other than that, OK.

13 All right. I think that's all we have, apart from the
14 verdict sheet.

15 THE COURT: OK. Anything else, Mr. Rohrbach?

16 MR. ROHRBACH: No. Thank you, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: OK. The verdict sheet.

18 MR. EVERDELL: The verdict sheet, your Honor, is just
19 tracking some of the changes.
20 THE COURT: Wait, wait. Sorry. Yes. Oh, I had two
21 more that we caught this morning. Page 78, line 13, it says
22 "solely be," but it should be "solely by."
23 MR. EVERDELL: Sorry, what line is that, your Honor?
24 THE COURT: 13s
25 MR. EVERDELL: OK.
