1 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor. Just to be able
2 to see the binder before it's passed out to jurors, because

3 they'll have a binder full of paper and be flipping through it
4 to turn to exhibits. We just want to have chance to lay eyes

5 on that binder in an abundance of caution. I've note that we

6 have done the same; we've provided defense counsel with a copy
7 of the binders that we plan to hand out.

8 THE COURT: Can you come closer to the mic please.

9 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

10 I would just note that we've done the same; we've

11 provided defense counsel with a copy of the binders that we

12 intend to pass out to the jurors so they can examine it.

13 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, what we would like to do is
14 follow the practice of this Court that it's been doing forever,
15 as far as I know, which is that before we show anything to the
16 witness, we will show it to the government and we will show it
17 to the Court and the Court's deputy so that they can see what
18 we are showing to the witness. But we do not want to give them
19 a whole binder of cross materials before the cross begins.
20 THE COURT: All right. That's fine. But in that
al case, we won't place the binder with the jury --
22 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine.
23 THE COURT: -- in advance.
24 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine.
25 THE COURT: Okay.
