1 1/1. I think I should mention 1/2 as well, since that's the

2 Sunday, "until you reach a verdict."

3 Go ahead, Ms. Sternheim.

4 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you, Judge.

a I would just say, with regard to those holiday dates,
6 that it should be their option. This jury knows that they were
7 committed through January 15th. If for some reason they have

8 plans that are going to distract them by virtue of having to

9 cancel them, I think the option is they can if they wish, but
10 it can be continued on Monday if that is their preference.

11 THE COURT: Well, I will say, again, if anyone has any
12 unmoveable commitments or -- what have I said? If that is a

13 hardship or anyone has any unmoveable commitments, they can let
14 Ms. Williams know, but for the reasons I have indicated on the
15 record, I am going to set this schedule, regarding my concern
16 that, given the high likelihood that a necessary member of the
17 trial participants or one or more members of the jury would

18 need to quarantine for ten days should they test positive, that
19 that is a substantial delay and only increasing the risk over
20 time, and so I am, for the reasons I've indicated, greatly
21 concerned, and therefore it's my view that we need to proceed
22 every day on our schedule unless â€”- and they are not shy to
23 indicate -- unless they indicate it's a hardship, okay?
24 MS. STERNHEIM: You know what our preference is, but
25 of course we'll abide by your decision.
