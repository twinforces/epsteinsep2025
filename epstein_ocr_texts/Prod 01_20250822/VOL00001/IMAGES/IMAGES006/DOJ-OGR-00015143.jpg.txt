Wil. Grand Jury Secrecy: Applicable Legal Principles

A, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)

The policy that “proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain secret” is “older
than our Nation itself.” Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d 489, 491 (2d Cir. 1973) (quoting Pittsburgh Plate
Glass Co. v. United States, 360 U.S. 395, 399 (1959)). The rule of secrecy “contribute[s] to the
success of grand juries and to the protection of those who appear before them.” Jn re Craig, 131
F.3d at 101-02. The purposes served by grand jury secrecy include:

(1) [t]o prevent the escape of those whose indictment may be contemplated;

(2) to insure the utmost freedom to the grand jury in its deliberations, and to prevent

persons subject to indictment or their friends from importuning the grand jurors;

(3) to prevent subornation of perjury or tampering with the witnesses who may

testify before [the] grand jury and later appear at the trial of those indicted by it;

(4) to encourage free and untrammeled disclosures by persons who have

information with respect to the commission of crimes; [and]

(5) to protect [the] innocent accused who is exonerated from disclosure of the fact

that he has been under investigation, and from the expense of standing trial when

there was no probability of guilt.

'! The Court hereinafter refers to the grand jury transcripts and exhibits together as the “grand
jury materials.”
