LBAAMAX 3ps Rocchio - Direct

talking about any event, there are general principles of

memory, and those would apply to memory, general well=accepted
principles of memory, that would apply to experiences of sexual
abuse as well.

So to the extent that we knew everybody pays attention
to and attaches significance to some aspects of an event more

so than others, what a sexual abuse survivor discloses and the

pieces of the story that they =- or their experiences; I'm

sorry -- that they remember are going to be those things that

were central details. They are going to have relatively good
memory mest of the time for the gist of the event and for the
details that they attended to and were most significant to
them. But, their memory for peripheral. details, we know, can
fade away and weaken Or changé with time.

Q. YOu just mentioned peripheral details. What do you mean by
that?

A. So im the memory literature, again, there is often a
distinction made betwéen what are considered. to bé central.

details and peripheral. details. So the central details are

subjectivély defined ds whatever it is ah individual is paying
attention to and. attaching significance to at the time of an

event. And those are the détdils that get encoded in memory

and are then later available for retrieval at the time of.

récall.

Q. Can you give an example.
