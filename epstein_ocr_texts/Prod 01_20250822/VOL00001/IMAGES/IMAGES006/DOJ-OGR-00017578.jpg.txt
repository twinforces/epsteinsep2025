1 (In open court)

2 THE COURT: You may proceed, Ms. Moe.

3 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

4 BY MS. MOE:

a Q. Let me back up and ask you a few questions. You testified

6 in the beginning Epstein and Maxwell made you feel special.

7 Can you explain to the jury what it is they did that made you

8 feel special when it first started?

9 A. Well, they made me feel special by spending time with me,
10 talking to me, asking me about my family, my interests, what I
11 was doing, what I was doing in school, what I wanted to do with
12 my life. They took me to the movies, they took me shopping,

13 and took me on field trips, I guess you could say.
14 Q. And to be clear, during this time, did Maxwell talk with
15 you about your school and your family and what was going on
16 with you and your life?
17 A. Yeah.
18 Q. You testified that you felt this way in the beginning. Did
19 there come a time when that changed?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. Can you tell the jury about that.
22 A. Well, it changed when the abuse started happening.
23 Q. Can you explain for the jury how has what Maxwell and
24 Epstein did to you affected your relationships as an adult?
25 A. That's a loaded question. Sure you could ask a lot of
