1 defense case. We noted early last week that we were going to

2 rest. We rested on Friday. They then had five full days,

3 including three business days, to prepare. So we would object
4 to holding the case over to Monday for a new witness.

5 MR. EVERDELL: This is a witness that is

6 extraordinarily relevant and sometimes things develop during

7 trial and we need to get witnesses to address issues that come
8 up at trial. We were able to find this person and he's willing
9 to come, even those he's 81, because he wants to come and

10 provide this testimony if it's required.

11 This is extraordinarily relevant, especially with the
12 issue that came up with the property records and the issue

13 raised to the Court. He can directly speak to that issue. His
14 testimony is relevant for a critical issue in this case, which
15 is whether or not this -- the events that Kate described could
16 have even taken place at the time they took place, which she

17 alleges they took place in, and he should be heard.

18 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I just note this is the

19 defense's third bite of this particular apple and it emphasizes
20 the prejudice to us of delayed disclosure. We will have no
21 opportunity to investigate further at this point.
22 THE COURT: I mean, what we talked about yesterday was
23 inclusion of documents that show ownership; right?
24 MR. EVERDELL: That's correct, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: And I think I said those could come in.
