Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 794 _ Filed 07/23/25 Page2of3

Maxwell has not made that showing. She has not shown, or attempted to show, that the
grand jury materials in her case are apt to reveal any deficiency in the proceedings leading to her |
indictment. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(e)(3)(E)(ii). And her convictions for conspiracy to transport
minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 18 U.S.C. § 371; transportation of a |
minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity, 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a); and sex trafficking
of a minor, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) & (b)(2), entered following a jury trial, and the 240-month
sentence imposed by Judge Nathan, have been affirmed on appeal by the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit. United States v. Maxwell, 118 F.4th 256, 261 (2d Cir. 2024),
petition for cert. filed (U.S. Apr. 10, 2025) (No. 24-1073).

Her argument is instead that, with the Government having recently moved to unseal the
grand jury transcripts, her review of them would assist her counsel in “craftfing] a response and
setting out our position to the Court.” Dkt. 793 at 1. There is no compelling necessity for that.
The Court has ordered the Government to produce these transcripts for the Court’s in camera |
review by Monday, July 28, 2025. The Court will review these transcripts expeditiously. In the :
event the Court determines it would benefit from Maxwell’s commentary as to a discrete aspect
of these transcripts, the Court stands ready to make that excerpt, or a synopsis thereof, available
to her counsel to facilitate counsel’s briefing, But there is no justification for Maxwell to obtain
the extraordinary relief of plenary access to the grand jury transcripts in her case. See, e.g., Inre :
for grand jury materials in connection with habeas petition where defendant failed to make .
“requisite showing of a particularized need”); Bruno v. Coveny, No. 18 Civ. 1522, 2020 WL
1812460, at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2020) (same); Henareh v. United States, No, 14 Civ. 7145,
2018 WL 3468715, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 8, 2018) (same), report and recommendation adopted,
No. 11 Cr. 93, 2018 WL 3462508 (S.D.N.Y. July 18, 2018); cf e.g., United States v. Blondet, No.
16 Cr. 387, 2019 WL 5690711, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 4, 2019) (denying defendant’s pre-trial
motion for in camera review of grand jury minutes where he did not demonstrate “compelling
necessity”); United States v. Lopez, No. 9 Cr. 525, 2010 WL 199652, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, :
2010) (similar).
