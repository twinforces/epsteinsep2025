19 today, it closes today. I'm not delaying trial on this issue
20 because I let in what you sought to have let in.
21 MR. EVERDELL: I think, your Honor, that on the issue
22 of whether we're going to rest today, we still have the issue
23 of whether the marshal is going to be able to produce one of
24 the witnesses that we want that we put on the valid subpoena.
25 So we're going to be going over to Monday probably anyway. If
