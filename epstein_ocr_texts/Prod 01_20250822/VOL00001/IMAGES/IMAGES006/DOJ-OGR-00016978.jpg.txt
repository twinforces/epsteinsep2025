2 So are you okay with "alleges" there, Mr. Everdell?

i) MR. EVERDELL: Well, let me see about that.

4 Are we talking just about the overt acts with respect
5 to Jane or are we talking about with Annie as well? Because

6 the overt act with respect to Annie is, she's saying she's

7 under the age of 18, but the age of consent there is 16, so --
8 and Kate -- there are a few issues here, so I'll just lay them
) out.

10 The instruction with Annie is, you know, there's the
11 age of consent issue with Annie. But skipping to Kate, which
12 is No. 4, on line 18, I don't think that should be in there at
13 all because that invites them to base an overt act and convict
14 the defendant based on Kate's testimony, which the Court has

15 already instructed that the jury can't. So, I mean, if they

16 found that this element was satisfied solely with Kate's

17 testimony, that would be an improper conviction. So that

18 shouldn't be included.

19 MR. ROHRBACH: Insofar as we'tre no longer following
20 the exact text of the indictment, the government would be fine
al with deleting the overt act relevant to Kate for the reason
22 Mr. Everdell stated.
23 THE COURT: Okay. All right.
24 MR. EVERDELL: All right. So then I think we could
25 probably say with respect to 1 and 2, which we're talking about
