LBAAMAX5ps Rocchio - Cross
Honor, part of my point.

THE COURT: If the point is that she doesn't know any
ef the facts of the specific case and the government concedes.
that's true, we can move on.

MR: PAGLIUCA: Yes.

I guess the other point, your Honor, which I can

develop, 1s, these studies that are included and impact the

statistics are really not relevant. here because they deal with
males or a combination of males and females, and there are only
a few of them that deal with females specifically.

THE COURT: OK:

MR. PAGLIUCA: So when we're conflating these things,
it, conflates the numbers.

May I proceéd, your Honor?

THE COURT: You may.

MR. PAGLIUCA: Thank you.

Q. So ‘that the first study, which is in 2016, im the last,

column, is all. maleS. Do you see that?
A. Could you -- the page is upside down on my screen. Can we
rotaté it so that I can look at what you're séeing, pleasé.

MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't know if Ms. Drescher can do
that or not.

THE WITNESS: Or I can look at a paper copy. But, I --
there's no way I can read that.

FHE COURT: J can't read it either,
