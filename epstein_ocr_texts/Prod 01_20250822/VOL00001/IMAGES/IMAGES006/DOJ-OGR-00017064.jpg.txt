LCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe

1 her underwear down, and when you see that, you'll understand

2 what Maxwell understood, that Maxwell understood what was

3 happening in that house.

4 The first visit for Carolyn to this house was the

5 beginning of years of sexual abuse. Carolyn told you about how
6 Maxwell would call her to set up appointment times for these

7 so-called massages, and sometimes Sarah Kellen would call, too.
8 Here's her testimony about that. She told you that

9 Maxwell would call and set up appointment times. She said for
10 the first year or two, Maxwell would call, and then Sarah would
11 call after that point. And you know that's true because

12 Carolyn said that twice when she gave deposition testimony

13 under oath in 2009.

14 Here's the first one.

15 This is Carolyn's deposition testimony from 2009.

16 "Q. In fact, Mr. Epstein himself did not contact you on each
17 occasion and request you to come, did he?

18 "A. No. He would have Sarah or Maxwell call me."

19 Here's the second one.
20 "QO. And on these occasions that you called to see if you could
21 go over there and give him a massage, did you talk to him or
22 did you talk to others at his house?
23 "A. I talked to Sarah or Maxwell. I've also talked to —-— I
24 don't know if it's a cook or someone else that was there that
25 took phone messages."
