THE COURT: -All right. We have a number of issues to
take tp. I've gotten letter briéfing on Séveral issues over
the past few days, including some new issues that came in last
night. I did addréss, 'the isstie of defense witness anonymity by

order last night,. which will be decketed this morning when

dockéting puts it up, denying ‘the defense requést for anonymity
for the reasons indicated.

As to thé rémdining issues, $6 there's the prior

inconsistent statements issue. I weceived the letter with. the
government objections close t6 11 p.m. last night. I havén't.
had, the ability to yet go through all of them, and J haven't
heard ahy responses from the defense:

What's the taming of anticipated witnesses here?

MR. EVERDELL: Y6éur Honor, f6r the witness order?

THE COURT: Well, when might. we get, to a witness who.
implicates the prior inconsistent. statements? And I gather
there's been some effort, to work through stipulation and
narrowing:

going ‘to be continued efforts there. I don't think we have a
withess until after lunch that is going to implicate the prior
