1 and there the change should be "under the age of 18" rather

2 than 17, but the conforming changes make sense.

3 THE COURT: Okay. Let me just articulate these.

4 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine.

5 THE COURT: So Instruction No. 34 on lines 4, 6, 15,

6 and 19, we're going to replace "minors" with "individuals under
7 the age of 17."

8 MR. EVERDELL: And there's one on line 10 as well,

9 your Honor.

10 MR. ROHRBACH: As well as line 13, your Honor.

11 THE COURT: Come on. The clerks are good, but, you

12 know, it's Saturday, after all.

13 We'll do a search and replace also, but I think it is
14 worth doing, since some of them are under 17 and some are under
15 18.

16 MR. EVERDELL: That's right, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: Okay. So let me just repeat.

18 So Instruction 34, lines 4, 6, 10, 13, 15, and 19, we
19 will replace "minors" with "individuals under the age of 17."
20 MR. EVERDELL: Correct, your Honor.
21 THE COURT: And then moving to replacing the word
22 "minor" with "an individual under the age of 18," Mr. Everdell,
23 that's line 24,
24 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: And what else?
