1 (Trial resumed; jury not present)

2 THE COURT: I did receive a note.

3 May we please have the following items: Different

4 colored Post-Its; white paperboard; highlighters, different

S colors; and then Matt's transcript; and then also may we have a
6 definition of "enticement."

7 So we're going to get started on the supplies. We'll
8 get them colored Post-Its, white paperboard. I'm not sure

9 exactly what they mean but we'll try and find a large pad, and
10 we'll also give them a whiteboard and dry erase markers and

11 then highlighters.

12 Ms. Moe, Matt's transcript you'll get printed

13 immediately?

14 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

15 THE COURT: Okay. And then I'll hear from the parties
16 as to how they would like to respond to the request for a

17 definition of "enticement."

18 MS. MOE: Your Honor, with respect to the jury's

19 question regarding enticement, our view is that the Court's
20 instruction, which is on page 21, instruction number 15: "The
21 terms persuaded, induced, enticed, and coerced have their
22 ordinary everyday meanings." That remain true now, and so we
23 would propose referring them to that portion of the Court's
24 instruction.
25 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor?
