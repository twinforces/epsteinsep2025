LEKVMAX6 Summation. —- Ms. Menninger

got the massage. But ‘then shé turned drotind a month latér and
told the victims' compensation. fund. that that was. groping her
breast. Ghislaine never touched hér nipplés or never touched
around her nipple area. But on her victims" compensation fund,
she told them that was groping her bredst, and that's, @xactly

the language that Ms. Moe adopted here today.

You héard about an inGident where she says that

Epstein entered her room and Ghislaine was not -in that room
when it happenéd. Epstein, waS not in ‘the room when she got the
massage. And she told the compensation fund that she was
sexually dbuséd in the movie theater. She told them Her
breasts were groped. She told them that, she had Mr. Epstein's
genitals pressed against Her; ahd she, for that story, got one
and, a half million, dollars.

But what, is the evidence about what Ghislaine Maxwell
knew about ‘this trip? Originally, Maria was supposed ‘to go on
the trips And 506 Ghislaine had no role in planning the trip,
We only know that. Epstein called Anhie's mom and talked to her
about Ghislaine being there.

Imagine for a Minute that you're Ghislaine Maxwell,
and you fly out to Santa Fe because you're going to meet with
some architects and plah the building of a new house. And all
of a sudden, some high school student, shows up, was supposed to
come with her sister for some kind of trip, and. then the sister.
