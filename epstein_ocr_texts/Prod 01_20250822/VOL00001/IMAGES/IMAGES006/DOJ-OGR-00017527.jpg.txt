LBUVMAX4 Jane - direct

1 this tall thin woman approach us. Well, she was walking with a

2 cute little Yorkie. And the Yorkie came by us and we asked if

3 we could pet the dog.

4 Q. What happened then?

5 A. We started chitchatting, petted the dog. And the rest of

6 my classmates had to go to class. And probably about a minute

7 later, another man came and joined her.

8 Q. Once the man joined her, what happened next?

9 A. We continued chitchat, sort of talked to us. And the rest
10 of my friends, my classmates, left, and I was there by myself.
11 And I sat on the bench still eating my ice cream, and the man
12 sat across from me.

13 Q. Did you have a conversation with that man and that woman?
14 A. Yes, I did. He seemed very interested to know what I
15 thought about the camp, what my favorite classes were, what my
16 least favorite classes, teachers, whatnot, what the experience
17 was like. And proceeded to say that they were big benefactors
18 of this camp; and that they went there every summer; and that
19 they gave different kids scholarships. And so they wanted to
20 really know what a student attending the camp, what their
21 perspective was on it.
22 Q. What, if anything, else did you discuss with them?
23 A. Well, they asked me where I was from. And I said I lived
24 in Palm Beach, Florida. And the man said, What a coincidence,
25 we live there too. What are your parents' names?
