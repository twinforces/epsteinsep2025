1 exhibits which can't be loaded to the flash drive, I think they
2 are going back to the jury.

3 MS. MENNINGER: Right. That's right.

4 THE COURT: So it will be a flash drive and the

5 physical exhibits and that's it. And you've gotten that, the

6 flash drive. Everybody's looked at it so you can confirm you

7 know what's going back?

8 MR. ROHRBACH: The parties agreed on what should be on
9 the flash drive and it's been created. I don't think the

10 defense has had an opportunity to look at it yet.

11 THE COURT: Whots handling this, Ms. Menninger?

12 MR. EVERDELL: I will be handling it, your Honor.

13 THE COURT: Let's be ready again at the lunch break to
14 just confirm on the record that that's ready to go.

15 Let me check if I have anything else. I don't think
16 so. The box is turned. Okay. All right. We'll wait for our
17 jurors and let my staff know if you need me for anything before
18 we get underway.
