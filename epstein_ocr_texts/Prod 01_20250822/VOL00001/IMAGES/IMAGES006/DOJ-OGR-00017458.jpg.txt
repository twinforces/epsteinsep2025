1 (Jury not present)

2 THE COURT: Are you set, Mr. Everdell?

3 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I have the copies. What I
4 need to do is insert them into the folders.

a MS. COMEY: No objection, your Honor.

6 THE COURT: Go ahead, Mr. Everdell.

7 (Pause)

8 Are you ready, Mr. Everdell?

9 MR. EVERDELL: Yes.

10 THE COURT: The procedure will be you will direct the
11 jury to open the folder under the chair and turn to a

12 particular page?

13 MR. EVERDELL: Yes. This one will be done on paper,
14 your Honor. We'tll have it on the screen for the Court, the

15 deputy, and the witness, but the jurors will just have it in

16 paper, as will the government, and it will not be displayed to
17 the public.

18 THE COURT: This is choreography to maintain the

19 anonymity of the witnesses who might be permitted to testify
20 under pseudonyms?
21 MS. COMEY: That's exactly right, your Honor. And for
22 that reason, we're going to ask that the two exhibits that the
23 defense is about to offer be offered under seal.
24 THE COURT: I am grateful to both counsel for working
25 that through. Thank you.
