ANSWERING THE TELEPHONE

immediately tells the caller the service standard. When you answer the phone, the quality of
your voice is of utmost importance. The person on the other end of the line cannot see your
expression or gestures, so any impression that person receives depends entirely on your
voice. Speak clearly and distinctly. Do not slam down the receiver at any time!
