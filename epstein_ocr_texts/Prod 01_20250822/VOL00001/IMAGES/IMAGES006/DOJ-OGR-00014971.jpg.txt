18 Q. Dr. Rocchio, I just want to start with some process here.
19 I show that you met with the government 14 times in the last
20 year or so. Is that correct?
21 A. If you're including telephone contacts, perhaps. I'm not
22 sure how many times we've spoken.
23 Q. OK. Does that sound about right, 14?
24 A. It could be. A number of those were around scheduling and
25 things, so sure.
