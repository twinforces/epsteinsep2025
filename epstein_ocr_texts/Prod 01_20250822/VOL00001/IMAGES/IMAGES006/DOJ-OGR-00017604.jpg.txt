1 Here defense counsel, in opening statements, suggested
2 to the jury that a recent motive to fabricate in this case was
3 civil litigation in a particular Jeffrey Epstein victim

4 compensation fund. So this statement is offered expressly to

5 rebut that because, in fact, Jane had told someone about this a
6 decade before that or more.

7 With respect to the second prong of the rule, the

8 statement is proper to rehabilitate the declarant's credibility
9 as a witness when attacked on another ground. The advisory

10 committee notes the rule expressly explained that one of the

11 grounds for rehabilitation is when that witness's memory has

12 been challenged, and here given this witness had made that

13 statement much earlier in time closer to the events, this

14 statement would be appropriate under the second prong of the

15 rule, as well.

16 MS. STERNHEIM: My response is still I think we need
17 to wait until her cross examination is over. I understand what
18 they are intending to do. It has to be evaluated whether the
19 statement that they allege she made to Matt is really a prior
20 consistent statement on her.
21 MS. MOE: Your Honor, in our view â€”-
22 THE COURT: Isn't the question whether it's a prior
23 consistent statement with what she testified on direct?
24 MS. STERNHEIM: It's not entirely clear because her
25 statement to him is extraordinarily vague and he did research
