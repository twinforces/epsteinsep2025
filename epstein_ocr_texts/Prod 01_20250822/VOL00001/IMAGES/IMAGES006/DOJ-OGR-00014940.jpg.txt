1 sexual abuse. So to the extent that more of my patients are

2 women than men, certainly that's a vulnerability.

7 have to address with patients because they inguire about it,

8 they don't understand. You know, why is it that this has

9 happened to me so many times. And, again, we know from the

10 revictimization literature that when someone is abused, they
11 are at higher risk of being abused at later points in time.

12 Also, you know, sometimes the clinical literature

13 individuals will talk about the specific issues in their family
14 that perhaps increase their vulnerability: They were always
15 alone. They, you know, their mom was sick and this person had
16 lots of opportunity to kind of befriend the family and, you

17 know, therefore had greater access as a result of that

18 vulnerability, or perhaps they were desperate for attention,
19 care, love, and concern from another person because those are
20 common childhood needs and maybe they weren't getting that at

23 up in, and have come up in, my over 30 years of treating
24 patients.
