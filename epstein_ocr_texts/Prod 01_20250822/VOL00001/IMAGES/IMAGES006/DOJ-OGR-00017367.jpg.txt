LBUCmax1

(In open court)

THE COURT: I speke to the juror with the travel plans
and, the information iS ‘that dates, can't be changed and they
can't cancel and it would be of some significant hardship, The
HUror 1S, i think, more concerned dbotit the spouse's reaction.
At ‘one point, they did say, “If L have to proceed, I can, I
understand." On the other hand, they mentioned some level of
distraction and concern.

So, I'll Hear your suggestion...

MR, PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, IL understood that. the Court

was going to == there were two options the Court was
considering. One was. seeing if the juror could, change plans,
and if that didn't work, the Court was considering breaking for
the juner's anticipated vacation. That's what I understood, the
Court to says

If the Jurner can't change the plans, our preference
would be, not. frankly that we want to delay tHe trial, but my
preference would be to keep the Juror and accommodate the
juror's travel plans, your Honor.

MS. COMEY: Your Honor, the government's preference
would be to keep the trial moving, keep the trial days as
scheduled, and excuse the juron if those days become necessary
for this Case.

THE COURT: Just, to be clear about whdt wetre talking
about. So given the holiday, we're not going to sit the 23rd
