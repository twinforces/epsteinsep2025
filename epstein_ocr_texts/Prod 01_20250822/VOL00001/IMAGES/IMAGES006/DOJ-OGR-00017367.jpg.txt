1 (In open court)

2 THE COURT: I spoke to the juror with the travel plans
3 and the information is that dates can't be changed and they

4 can't cancel and it would be of some significant hardship. The
a) juror is, I think, more concerned about the spouse's reaction.
6 At one point, they did say, "If I have to proceed, I can. I

7 understand." On the other hand, they mentioned some level of

8 distraction and concern.

9 So, I'll hear your suggestion.

10 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, I understood that the Court
11 was going to â€”- there were two options the Court was

12 considering. One was seeing if the juror could change plans,
13 and if that didn't work, the Court was considering breaking for
14 the juror's anticipated vacation. That's what I understood the
15 Court to say.

16 If the juror can't change the plans, our preference

17 would be, not frankly that we want to delay the trial, but my
18 preference would be to keep the juror and accommodate the

19 juror's travel plans, your Honor.
20 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, the government's preference
21 would be to keep the trial moving, keep the trial days as
22 scheduled, and excuse the juror if those days become necessary
23 for this case.
24 THE COURT: Just to be clear about what we're talking
25 about. So given the holiday, we're not going to sit the 23rd
