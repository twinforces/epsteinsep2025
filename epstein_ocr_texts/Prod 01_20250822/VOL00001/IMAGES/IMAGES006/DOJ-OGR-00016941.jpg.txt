asked for before, last sentence, "Count Four rélates solely to
Jane and the time period --"
THE COURT: Okay. T'1ll accept that.

Page 15, line 20, the sentence that begins, "Count
Four," adding "solely" after "relates," so the sentence would
read, "Count Four relates. solely to Jane,”

Okay. Next?

MR, EVERDELL: Page 16, line 2, similar request:
"Count, Six Yelates solely to Carolyn."

THE COURT: Okay. I'll accept that.

Page 16, last line, adding “solely" after "relates"
and, before "to Carolyn,"

Okay. Next page.

MR. EVERDELL: Page 17, this is a small one, ‘your
Heénor,.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. EVERDELL: Lines 2 t6 3, “Each Count. charges the.
defendant," since we're using "Ms. Maxwell" in, the other parts
of this chargé, we'll just say, “Each Count charges Ms. Maxwell

THE GOURT: All right. That's fine.

SQ instruction 11, page 17, line 3, changing

“defendant” to "MS. Maxwell." So the sentence réads, "Each

Count, charges Ms. Maxwell with a@ different crime."

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, can I. just have one moment.
