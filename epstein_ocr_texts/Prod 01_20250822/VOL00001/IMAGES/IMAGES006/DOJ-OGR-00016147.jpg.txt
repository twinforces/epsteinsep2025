1 Under this pyramid scheme of abuse, the defendant

2 could just call girls to schedule massage appointments and hand
3 them cash afterwards, overseeing the operation and normalizing
4 the abuse by showing these young girls that she, an older,

8 scheme. She knew exactly what she was doing. She was

9 dangerous. She was setting young girls up to be molested by a
10 predator.

12 defendant enticed and groomed multiple young girls to engage in
13 sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein, that the defendant and Epstein
14 enticed some of those girls to travel to Epstein's homes in

15 different states, which the defendant knew would result in

16 sexual abuse.

17 As a result of these actions, the defendant is charged
18 in six counts. Four of the counts charge her with working with
19 Epstein to transport girls under the age of 17 across state
20 lines to be sexually abused. Two of the counts charge her with
2l crimes for sex trafficking of minors. Sex trafficking of

23 recruiting or enticing a girl under the age of 18 for sex acts
24 in exchange for money.
25 Now, how will we prove to you that the defendant is
