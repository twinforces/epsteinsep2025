1 that you're going to see in this case, and I'm going to do that
2 in two parts. First, I will tell you what I expect the

3 evidence is going to show. Second, I'm going to talk about the
4 different types of evidence that will prove that Ghislaine

5 Maxwell is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

6 So what will the evidence show?

7 You're going to learn that the man and woman I just

8 mentioned were Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell
9 was Epstein's best friend and right hand. Epstein was a

10 multimillionaire connected to famous and powerful people. He
11 lived a life of extraordinary luxury. He owned many

12 properties, including a villa in Palm Beach, Florida, a mansion
13 in Manhattan, a ranch in New Mexico, and an apartment in Paris.
14 He even owned an entire private island in the United States

15 Virgin Islands. And he had staff who worked for him in his

16 various homes.

17 Epstein also owned private planes. He had pilots who
18 worked for him full-time, flying him to his properties and

19 other locations in the United States and internationally. The
20 defendant got to enjoy that luxury right along with Epstein.
21 Starting in the early 1990s, the defendant was ina
22 personal intimate relationship with Epstein, they were a couple
23 for many years, and when their relationship ended, they
24 remained, in the defendant's own words, the best of friends.
25 The defendant was Epstein's closest associate and
