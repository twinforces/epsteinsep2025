2024). On November 25, 2024, the Second Circuit denied Maxwell’s petition for rehearing.
United States v. Maxwell, No. 22-1426 (2d Cir. Nov. 25, 2024), Dkt. 120.

On April 10, 2025, Maxwell petitioned for a writ of certiorari before the Supreme Court.
Her petition argues that Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for
the Southern District of Florida barred her prosecution in this District. See United States v.
Maxwell, No. 24-1073 (S. Ct. Apr. 10, 2025). On July 14, 2025, the Government opposed the
petition. On July 28, 2025, Maxwell replied. As of this decision, the petition remains pending.

F. DOJ’s Recent Statements Regarding the Disclosure of Epstein Records

On February 27, 2025, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) issued a press release. It stated
that the Attorney General (“AG”) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI’’) had declassified
and were publicly releasing files relating to Epstein’s exploitation of more than 250 girls.
Quoting the AG and the FBI Director, the press release stated:

“This [DOJ] is following through on President Trump’s commitment to

transparency and lifting the veil on the disgusting actions of Jeffrey Epstein and his

co-conspirators,” said Attorney General Pamela Bondi. “The first phase of files

released today sheds light on Epstein’s extensive network and begins to provide the

public with long overdue accountability.”

“The FBI is entering a new era—one that will be defined by integrity,

accountability, and the unwavering pursuit of justice,” said FBI Director Kash

Patel. “There will be no cover-ups, no missing documents, and no stone left

unturned—and anyone from the prior or current Bureau who undermines this will

be swiftly pursued. If there are gaps, we will find them. If records have been

hidden, we will uncover them. And we will bring everything we find to the DOJ

to be fully assessed and transparently disseminated to the American people as it

should be.
