LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 You didn't hear from one. Jane said she went to Epstein's

2 house hundreds of times, once every week or two, for three

3 years. She lived with a mother and two brothers, and no one,

4 not one relative came and got on that stand and told you that

5 she spent time with Ghislaine and Epstein from the ages of 14

6 to 17. No relative of Kate's came to tell you that. No

7 relative of Carolyn's came to tell you that. Who are these

8 relatives that are going to come and tell you about the victims
9 spending time with the defendant and Epstein? Annie's mom

10 came. Annie's mom came and told you she only spoke to Epstein.
11 She never met or talked to Ghislaine Maxwell. She has no idea.
12 The government also said that these relatives would

13 come tell you about all the phone calls these females got. Did
14 you see those phone calls? Did you hear from those relatives?
15 Did you see a phone record? I didn't. These are broken

16 promises from the government in their opening. Lack of

17 evidence.

18 The government also told you that they were going to
19 tell you, you are going to hear from a bevy of employees who
20 would back up the accusers' stories, and again, the government
21 failed to deliver the goods. Instead, what you did you get?
22 You got some pilots. They told you the pilots would tell you
23 about flying some of the victims.
24 We did hear from pilots. We heard from Larry Visoski,
25 who said he never saw a woman on a plane who looked under 20
