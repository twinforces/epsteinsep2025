1 executive assistants that were there during your time in the

2 office?

3 A. Yes, Leslie Roth and Suann Pisap.

4 QO. Who came before who, Suann or Leslie?

5 A. Suann was before Leslie.

6 Q. Was Leslie there when you left?

7 A. Yes.

8 Q. Were there any other people in the office that you recall

9 working there in any of the offices there?

10 A. On a daily basis, I can't remember if there was anybody

11 else there working on a daily basis. We did have other

12 personal assistants come through and hang out, not necessarily
13 all day, but kind of like pit stops. That would be Emmy Taylor
14 and Sarah Kellen.

15 Q. So with respect to Emmy Taylor, I'm focusing your attention
16 on the 1996, '97, '98. Do you recall seeing Emmy Taylor during
17 that time period?

18 A. I don't recall when I first saw her. I don't know. I

19 would say it was the middle of my time there, in the middle of
20 that time.
21 Q. You also mentioned a Sarah Kellen. Do you remember when
22 you started seeing Sarah Kellen?
23 A. That was more towards the end.
24 Q. So in the time period, '96, '97, '98, do you recall seeing
25 Sarah Kellen?
