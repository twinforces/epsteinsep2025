Jeffrey and Ghislaine have been together, a couple, for the last 11 years.
They are, contrary to what many people think, rarely apart — 1 almost always
see them together
Ghislaine is highly intelligent, and great company with a ready smile and an
infectious laugh who always puts one at ones ease, and always makes one
feel welcome.
Jeffrey and Ghislaine share many mutual interests and they have a lot of fun
together. They both have keen searching and inquisitive minds. She grew
up amongst scientists and in an academic and business environment.
They share a love of travel and art. She speaks 5 languages. She enjoys
spending time visiting auction houses (she says that is the best way to learn
about art and antiques — your expected to look touch and ask questions)
Ghislaine also has her own interests and has her own business pursuits — she
is independent and strong willed - something which Jeffrey loves about her -
She is adventurous — she flies helicopters, she is athletic — she rides horses,
plays tennis, skis and scuba dives. She is a serious photographer (she always
has a camera in hand) who is collaborating with some of the leading people
involved at the cutting edge of digital photography.
Jeffrey and Ghislaine compliment each other really well and I cannot
imagine one without the other. On top of being great partners they are also
the best of friends.
