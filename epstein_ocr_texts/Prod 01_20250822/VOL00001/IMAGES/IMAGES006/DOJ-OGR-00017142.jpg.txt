Customs and Bordér Patrol records, aré not a@éctiraté.

Okay. Well, that's kind of silly.

But if you look at Jane's records that come in the
same exhibit number, you'll see that they go back to January of
"96. So the records go back that far. There just isn't a
record of Annie going to Thailand in 1996. And. so the

records.

Annie's story. She's saying that she wore —— she was. bought
these, boots by the pesple who sexually abused her; Epstein

excuse me. And you'll have the boots with you, back in, the jury
room, and you can see for yourselves How worn ‘those bdots are.

And so when the government finally got those boots in

fanally got them, and Looked, at them and, saw that, she's been
wearing boots from the pédcple that she Says sexudlly abused
hen, she came up with a new story, and that story was that she
resided té reclaim the boéts. And that's the story she told
for the first time right before trial dnd what she told you on.
