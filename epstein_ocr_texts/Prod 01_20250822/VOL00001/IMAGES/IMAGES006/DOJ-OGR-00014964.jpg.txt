kids around the time, so not as much delayed.

Q. Approximately what. percentage of the patients you treated

and assessed disclosed that they experrenced childnoed sexual
abuse at the time of the abuse?

A. A very, very small number. I, I can probably count en one
hand the number of patients, in my private practice, who said
that they told right away. With younger children in
particular, we also know that it's more likely with very young
ehildren not so much that they're just going to spontaneously
go to someone and tell them but that's it"s going to be
accidentally discovered or someone else finds out about it and
then inquires; and that's how that. information comes out. But,
again, we know ‘that most victims of childhood sexual abuse
don't énd up disclosing until somé Significant point in time
after the event, and that's consistent, with what I've
experiencéd in. my practicé.

Q. You just mentioned very young children. What are you
referring to?

A. We know that delayed disclosure Nappens over time. But we

also know that thé younger thé child, the moré likely it is
that the disclosure or ‘the discovery of the abuse happens
accidéntally.

Q. Are you aware of other psychologists treating and evaluate
patients who have delay disclosing childhood. sexudl abuse?

A. Yes.
