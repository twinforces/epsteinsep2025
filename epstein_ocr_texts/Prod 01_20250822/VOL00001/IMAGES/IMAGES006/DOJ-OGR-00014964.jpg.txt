1 kids around the time, so not as much delayed.

2 Q. Approximately what percentage of the patients you treated
3 and assessed disclosed that they experienced childhood sexual
4 abuse at the time of the abuse?

5 A. A very, very small number. I, I can probably count on one
6 hand the number of patients, in my private practice, who said
7 that they told right away. With younger children in

8 particular, we also know that it's more likely with very young
9 children not so much that they're just going to spontaneously
10 go to someone and tell them but that's it's going to be

11 accidentally discovered or someone else finds out about it and
12 then inquires, and that's how that information comes out. But,
13 again, we know that most victims of childhood sexual abuse

14 don't end up disclosing until some significant point in time
15 after the event, and that's consistent with what I've

16 experienced in my practice.

17 Q. You just mentioned very young children. What are you

18 referring to?

19 A. We know that delayed disclosure happens over time. But we
20 also know that the younger the child, the more likely it is
21 that the disclosure or the discovery of the abuse happens
22 accidentally.
23 Q. Are you aware of other psychologists treating and evaluate
24 patients who have delay disclosing childhood sexual abuse?
25 A. Yes.
