5 to make it seem okay, because of what I saw as, you know, him

6 being such a generous, nice person. And so, you know, I'm

7 trying to -- I'm trying to make sense of it and I'm having a

9 Q. I'll ask you to continue reading from where it says "Right
10 now."
11 A. Right now my big concern is what I am going to do this
12 summer. There are so many cools things to do and amazing
13 places to go. Right now I'm really thinking about doing
14 something in Africa. It would be incredible. So different, so
15 beautiful, all the different people. I would love it. I think
16 I will really be happy doing almost anything.
