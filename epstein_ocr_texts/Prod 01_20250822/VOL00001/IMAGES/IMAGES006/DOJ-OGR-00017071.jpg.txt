LCKCmax3 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 Virginia. JE, GM, AT, Virginia. It's from 2000. She was 17

2 years old. Here's another page. JE, GM, ET, Virginia Roberts.
3 Here's another, JE, GM, ET, Virginia Roberts. There is another

12 messages from the message pads, and here they are. It's

13 Government Exhibits 2-U, 2-P, and 2-0. And if you take a look
14 at the date on the two messages on the left, they're from 2003
15 when Carolyn was 16. There's the phone number. It's the same.

17 Carolyn's 16th birthday. There is more. There is an entry in

19 messages from 2003, too. Here they are. One says Carolyn, two
20 say Caroline, but you know it's the same person, you know it's
al Carolyn because the phone number is the same.
22 Who else is in this book? Remember how Sean told you

24 house with Carolyn? It's this girl in the photograph with
25 Carolyn. She's the one right next to Carolyn. That's
