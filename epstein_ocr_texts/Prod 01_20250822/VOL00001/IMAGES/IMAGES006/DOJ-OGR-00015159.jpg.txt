This factor, on balance, weighs against unsealing.
6. Current Status of the Principals of the Grand Jury and That of Their
Families
This factor is aimed primarily at protecting the reputations and interests of unindicted
individuals, about whom unsealed grand jury testimony would reveal damaging information not
previously disclosed. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 107. There is no such person or information
here. Insofar as Maxwell was the subject of the grand jury testimony, this factor suggests
considering here “the continued existence and vulnerability” of her and her family. Jd. Maxwell
is alive and so theoretically could be harmed by the disclosure of adverse testimony. But here,
the grand jury materials, being cumulative of the public trial evidence, do not add anything to the
formidable public record inculpating her. And no family member of hers has expressed a
position on the motion to unseal. Gov’t Mem. at 6. This factor is neutral.
Ve Extent to Which the Desired Material Has Previously Been Made
Public
“T]he extent to which the grand jury material in a particular case has been made public
is clearly relevant because even partial previous disclosure often undercuts many of the reasons
for secrecy.” See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 107. Here, as explained, substantially all the
information testified to by the summary witnesses in the grand juries has been revealed at
Maxwell’s trial. And the Government proposes to redact victim identities, consistent with the
approach that it took at trial. This factor is consistent with unsealing.
8. Whether Witnesses to the Grand Jury Proceedings Who Might be
Affected by Disclosure Are Still Alive
Both law enforcement agents who testified are still alive. Gov’t Mem. at 7. The
Government, however, proposes to redact their names. This factor is neutral.
