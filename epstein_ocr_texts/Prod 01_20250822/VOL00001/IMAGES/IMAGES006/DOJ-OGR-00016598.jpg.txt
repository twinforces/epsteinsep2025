1 A. Yes, there is -- well, one study that's coming to mind

2 is -- this is a study that we published somewhat later in the

3 2000s, maybe around 2008 or so, along with my former Ph.D.

4 student who is now professor of psychology, Dr. Laney. This

5 was a study where we -- we didn't just change memory for

6 turning a stop sign into a yield sign, but we planted entire

7 events into the minds of research witnesses, events that did

8 not happen. And then we measured people's emotional reactions
9 to these false memories.

10 So we planted false memories, for example, that you

11 witnessed your parents having a physically violent fight when
12 you were a kid or that you accidentally caught your parents,

13 you know, having sex when you were a kid. And once we

14 succeeded in planting these false memories and measured

15 people's emotional reactions, they were just as emotional about
16 these created memories as other individuals were who truly had
17 had those experiences. So the bottom line there was that

18 emotion is no guarantee that you're dealing with an authentic
19 memory.
20 Q. Professor Loftus, in devising a research project, do you
2l need to gain approval from any organization or from your
22 university to permit you to engage in that experiment?
23 A. Yes, we do. Colleges and universities have human subjects,
24 review committees. And when we want to propose to do a study
25 with humans, there are separate groups that review studies with
