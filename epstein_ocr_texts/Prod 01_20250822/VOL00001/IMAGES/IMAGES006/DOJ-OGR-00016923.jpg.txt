1 (Jury not present)

2 THE COURT: Matters to take up. Oh, the charge, I bet
3 you're curious. I want to give it just one more read. I

4 haven't had time to do that today given the issues that

5 occupied the lunch break. I would say by 6:00 p.m., you'll

6 have a copy of my draft charge and the draft verdict sheet and
7 we'll meet at 9:00 a.m. here for the charging conference

8 tomorrow.

9 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

10 Just on a separate housekeeping matter, your Honor, I
11 just wanted to flag, given the number of issues we're trying to
12 streamline and resolve today and yesterday, we haven't had a

13 chance yet to discuss logistics for closing, but we want to

14 make sure we iron that out so we make sure we're ready to go on
15 Monday morning. I wanted to flag that we'll confer this

16 evening to make sure we're on the same page on logistics and

17 screens and the like.

18 Would the Court prefer that we reach out about a

19 proposal about how that should be arranged? I want to make
20 sure we're not causing any delay on Monday morning.
21 THE COURT: I mean, I think confer with the court
22 staff to make sure you have what you need. Only if there is a
23 dispute do you need to raise it with me.
24 MS. MOE: Is there anyone in particular within the
25 courthouse staff we should reach out to about logistics?
