1 the question of knowledge as to age, what's your response? Why
2 isn't it applicable with respect to what the defense has put in
3 issue with regard to that?

4 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor. The witnesses

5 themselves -- sorry, your Honor. One moment.

6 THE COURT: Yes.

7 MR. PAGLIUCA: If you don't mind, your Honor, it's

8 easier for me â€”-

9 THE COURT: Since it's Saturday, I will break my

10 one-Lawyer-per-issue rule.

11 MR. PAGLIUCA: I appreciate it. My recollection is

12 the testimony from each of the four witnesses, I will call

13 them, is that they said that they told Ms. Maxwell their age.
14 Carolyn said that she told Ms. Maxwell her age. Jane said she
15 told Ms. Maxwell her age. Similarly, Kate said she told

16 Ms. Maxwell her age.

17 So there is no "I'm not trying to find out what her

18 age is" evidence in this case. The evidence that was

19 elicited -- I think this is, you know, largely through
20 Mr. Alessi. Mr. Alessi said that he only saw two people at the
21 house that he thought were under the age of 18, and that was
22 Ms. Roberts and Jane. I'm trying to remember everybody's
23 names.
24 So that's that testimony.
25 I don't think there's any other testimony in the
