innocent third parties and publication of their names in connection with these materials would
have the potential to contribute to additional needless and irreparable harm beyond what they
have already suffered as a result of this matter. Where, as here, the effect of unsealing grand jury
materials would have the potential to harm still-living third parties, the historical interest of the
public cannot outweigh the privacy interests in keeping the materials under seal. See Jn re
Application of Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79-80 (2d Cir. 1990) (emphasizing in the context of a

There is a long history of maintaming the secrecy of grand jury proceedings for a reason.

and “to protect [the] mnocent accused ....” Procter & Gamble, 356 U.S. at 681 n.6. Beyond
protecting innocent parties who are the subject of grand jury investigations, this secrecy also

proceedings from any unwarranted association with the crimes alleged therein. Because of the
policy and due process rationale behind grand jury secrecy, the permissible bases upon which
grand jury materials may be shared are limited to certain exceptions in Rule 6(e)(3). The Second
Circuit has recognized limited additional “special circumstances” in which release of grand jury
records is appropriate, including historical interest by the public. Craig, 131 F.3d at 102. But in

investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, which we understand concems the same or substantially similar facts. Due to a
Circuit split, the Southern District of Florida evaluated only the exceptions to grand jury secrecy enumerated in Rule
6(e). Order Den. Pet. to Unseal Grand Jury Trs., In re Grand Jury 5-02 & 07-103, 9:25-mce-80920 (S.D. Fla. July
