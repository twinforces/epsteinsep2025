addition to, or different from, those which they now know or believe to exist with respect
to the subject matter of this General Release, but that it is Releasor’s intent hereby to fully,
finally and forever settle and release all of the Claims, whether known or unknown,

respect to compensation awarded to any participating claimant under the EVCP. If either
entity asserts a lien or reimbursement claim, Epig is hereby authorized to act on behalf of
the EVCP to verify and resolve such lien or reimbursement claim. In the Claim Form,

regarding the nature of Releasor’s Claims, and authorizing the Administrator and Epiq

necessary, for purposes of verifying and resolving Medicare and/or Medicaid liens
and/or reimbursement claims and ensuring compliance with the Medicare Secondary
Payer Act, 42 U.S.C. § 1395(y)(b), and its accompanying regulations. In the event that
Epiq resolves the asserted claim or lien, the Epstein Estate will pay the negotiated amount
in addition to any Compensation Offer determined by the Administrator.
