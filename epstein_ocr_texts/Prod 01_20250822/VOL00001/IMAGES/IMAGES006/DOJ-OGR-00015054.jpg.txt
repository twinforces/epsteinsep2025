Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20-CR-330 (PAE)
Dear Judge Engelmayer:
We respectfully submit this letter in connection with our representation of Ghislaine
Maxwell in the above-referenced case.
Earlier today, the Court issued an Order directing the Government to file a
supplemental memorandum, no later than Tuesday, July 29, 2025, addressing specific
factors relevant to the Government’s application to unseal grand jury transcripts in this
case. (Dkt. 789). Additionally, the Court ordered the Government to provide the Court
with the grand jury transcripts that the Government seeks to unseal by July 29, 2025,
for the Court’s review. Id. at 3.
As counsel for Ms. Maxwell, we would similarly like to review the grand jury transcripts
at issue (we have not seen them and our understanding is that they have never been
provided to the defense in their entirety) in order to craft a response and set out our
position to the Court. We have discussed our request to review the grand jury
transcripts with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, and he has no objection to our
application.
Thank you for your consideration in this matter.
Respectfully submitted,
/s/ David Oscar Markus
