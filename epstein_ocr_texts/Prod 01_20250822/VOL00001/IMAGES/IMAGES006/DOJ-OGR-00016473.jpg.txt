1 suggested. I think in the press of business over the last 24

2 hours, that has not yet been discussed between the two sides.

3 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor.

4 We haven't had a chance to confer about that issue.

5 We have begun discussing that internally and are thinking

6 through that carefully. We're not in a position to make a

7 representation about our position at this juncture, but that's
8 very much top of mind and we'll be working diligently on that

9 issue over the break.

10 THE COURT: Okay.

11 MS. MENNINGER: And just as a preview, your Honor,

12 there may be some others like that. As your Honor is aware,

13 things came up during the course of testimony, and we will

14 confer with the government about that with respect to other

15 attorneys as well.

16 MS. MOE: I'm sorry, your Honor. I'm not sure I'm

17 following that.

18 MS. MENNINGER: There are other matters that may give
19 rise to the need for attorney testimony or probably more likely
20 a stipulation about similar issues. And we would like to
al confer with the government first before briefing them. But I
22 wouldn't -- our witness list may have other attorneys' names on
23 them that have an asterisk by it saying subject to briefing and
24 approval by the Court. I don't want anyone to believe we
25 haven't understood the Court's prior statements on this topic.
