CLEANING SCHEDULE
The most important aspect of household cleaning and maintenance is routine. Certain
tasks have to be completed every day to keep things at a high standard. A home that is
properly cleaned stays “in place” much longer than those that have been only surface
cleaned. Always remember to clean from the top down and from the inside out. Always
vacuum last. When leaving a room, turn to check it after you complete it.
