(Jury net present)

THE COURT: Good afternoon, everyone. We haven't

heard anything from the try, so I think it iS time to consider
putting in a note regarding temorrow since we don't have a
response on that’. So 'the note I have drafted, with your input,
let me know, “Hello, jury. If your deliberations are not
completed today, do you wish to déliberate tomorrow, Thursday,
December 23rd?" And then I have a. box for "yes" and a. box for

"no." "Pléase check yes or no. If yes, what ‘time would you

like to deliberate from? Blank a.m, to blank p.m. Judge
Nathan."

Any thoughts or requests?

MS. COMEY: Seems perfect.

MS. STERNHEIM: Fine. Thank ‘you.

THE COURT: What. I'll do is we'll send that in and T
think everybody just wait, my assumption is it will come right
back Gut and wé'll reconvene. I'll séé yéu in a mormient.

(Recess):

THE COURT: As that went ih, a note Garie out. S6 I
don't have a response yet, but I have a note.

"May we please have the folléwing testiménies in a

binder." The first one is Jane, Wong, Kate. There is
something élsé written hext toé Jane.

MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I'm not reading the note, but,
they got Jane. It wasn't in a binder.
