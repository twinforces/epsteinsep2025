1 (Jury not present)

2 THE COURT: Good afternoon, everyone. We haven't

3 heard anything from the jury, so I think it is time to consider
4 putting in a note regarding tomorrow since we don't have a

a response on that. So the note I have drafted, with your input,
6 let me know, "Hello, jury. If your deliberations are not

7 completed today, do you wish to deliberate tomorrow, Thursday,
8 December 23rd?" And then I have a box for "yes" and a box for
9 "no." "Please check yes or no. If yes, what time would you

10 like to deliberate from? Blank a.m. to blank p.m. Judge

11 Nathan."

12 Any thoughts or requests?

13 MS. COMEY: Seems perfect.

14 MS. STERNHEIM: Fine. Thank you.

15 THE COURT: What I'll do is we'll send that in and I
16 think everybody just wait, my assumption is it will come right
17 back out and we'll reconvene. I'll see you in a moment.

18 (Recess)

19 THE COURT: As that went in, a note came out. So I
20 don't have a response yet, but I have a note.
al "May we please have the following testimonies in a
22 binder." The first one is Jane, Wong, Kate. There is
23 something else written next to Jane.
24 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I'm not reading the note, but
25 they got Jane. It wasn't in a binder.
