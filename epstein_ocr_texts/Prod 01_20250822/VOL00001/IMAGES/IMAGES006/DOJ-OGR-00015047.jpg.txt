ORDER
GHISLAINE MAXWELL,
Defendant.

PAUL A. ENGELMA YER, District Judge:

The Court has received a four-page motion entitled “United States’? Motion to Unseal
Grand Jury Transcripts,” which was filed with the Clerk’s Office of this District on July 18,
2025. See Dkt. 785 (“Government Motion”). The motion asks that the Court “unseal the
underlying grand jury transcripts” in this matter, “subject to appropriate redactions of victim-
related and other personal identifying information.” Jd. at 1-2.! |

The Court intends to resolve this motion expeditiously. However, the Court cannot rule :
on the motion without additional submissions. Specifically: |

Memorandum of law: Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e) codified the practice,
‘older than our Nation itself,’ that proceedings before a grand jury shall generally remain
secret.” In re Petition of Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 102 (2d Cir. 1997) (quoting Jn re Biaggi, 478 F.2d
489, 491 (2d Cir. 1973) (Friendly, C.J.)); see also Douglas Oil Co. of Cal. v. Petrol Stops Nw.,
441 U.S. 211, 218 (1979). Rule 6(e)(3) lists exceptions to the rule of secrecy but these are not
invoked by the Government’s motion. In addition, the Second Circuit has recognized that there
! The Court understands that the Government has made a parallel motion in United States v.
Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (S.D.N.Y.), at Dkt. 61.
