THE COURT: Okay.
MR, EVERDELL: We would reiterate, just for the

will ask that thé word "solély" be ineluded on line 12, so,
“Count, Four also relates solely to Jane,”

MR. ROHRBACH: No objection:

THE COURT: Okay. We'll make that change. And my
Clerk tells mé we missed an “and foreign" oh page 25.

MR: EVERDELL: Yes, yes. So we do have te go back to

"knowingly transports any individual under the age of 18," but
this is the issue with New York ‘law being under the age of 17,
