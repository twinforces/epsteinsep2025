1 the defendant was an organizer or leader, and that the criminal
2 activity either involved five or more participants or was

3 otherwise extensive. The guidelines defines a participant as a
4 person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the
5 offense but need not have been convicted.

6 So I think my question for the government is, you're

7 asking the Court to look to as a criminally responsible -- a

8 person who is criminally responsible for the commission of the
9 offense over whom Ms. Maxwell exercised supervisory or

10 leadership role.

11 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. As we noted in our

12 briefing, our view is that the trial evidence establishes that
13 the defendant had a supervisory role over Sarah Kellen. Here,
14 we're not required to establish that there were five or more

15 participants; that is, people who were criminally responsible
16 for the charged conduct, but rather that it was extensive, and
17 that the defendant supervised at least one other person.

18 That's the text of the commentary, although as we noted, the

19 Second Circuit in applying this factor hasn't really engaged
20 with that from what we can tell, but on the factual question of
21 the trial record and whether it establishes the defendant
22 supervised another participant, it absolutely does.
23 THE COURT: And the government is pointing to Sarah
24 Kellen for that conclusion, which you agree, there has to be
25 one criminally responsible participant who we can point to.
