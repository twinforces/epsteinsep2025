1 MR. EVERDELL: Oh, yeah. Agreed, your Honor.

2 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes.

3 THE COURT: What do you have, Mr. Everdell?

4 MR. EVERDELL: So this is where it gets a little

5 complicated, your Honor. I mean, I know that in lines 11

6 through 22, we're listing -- and in the next page as well,

7 we're listing out the overt acts in the indictment. We're

8 listing them verbatim, but they're talking about ages, under

9 the age of 18, under the age of 18, and we've already talked

10 about how the ages are sort of different depending on the

11 statutes. That's one issue. Right. So we might want to

12 replace the -- instead of the ages -- and I know -- it's less
13 of an issue because I think we've agreed that the indictment is
14 not going back to the jurors, so they're not going to be

15 reading the language, but maybe instead of "under the age of

16 18," "when Jane was under the relevant age of consent in the

17 relevant jurisdiction," or something to that effect.

18 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, if I may. I understand the
19 concern the defense is raising. I think for Counts One and
20 Three, since the relevant age of consent I think everyone
al agrees is 17, the government would be fine with saying "under
22 the age of 17," and we'd have to say "the indictment alleges"
23 or something like that, because it would no longer be following
24 the text of the indictment.
25 THE COURT: Yes. I mean, we could do "alleges" or
