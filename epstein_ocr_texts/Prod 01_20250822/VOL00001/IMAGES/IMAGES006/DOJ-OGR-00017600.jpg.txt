1 at a high level of cross and what might be identified so we can
2 troubleshoot these issues in advance in order to work ona

3 solution that avoids wasting the jury's time and, most

4 importantly, jeopardizing the privacy of a crime victim. We

5 have previously reached out to defense to ask to confer about

6 some of these issues. We would like to do that this evening.

7 I am concerned that there may be topics that are identifying as
8 to this victim and we would be happy to talk it through with

9 defense counsel and work out a solution about anonymizing names
10 or other issues as we continued all along in this case.

11 So we ask the Court to direct the parties to meet and
12 confer on that issue given the steaks of that issue in this

13 case.

14 THE COURT: Ms. Menninger, the witness is on cross, so
15 they can't confer with the witness. Any reason not to do that?
16 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I see no reason not to

17 confer with the government about a way that we can accommodate
18 this.

19 THE COURT: You can do that. If you have different
20 views, you'll raise them with me by letter tonight if you come
21 to a point of disagreement. Okay?
22 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.
23 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you.
24 THE COURT: Anything else?
25 MS. MENNINGER: Not from us, your Honor. Thank you.
