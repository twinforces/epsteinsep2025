THE COURT: Okay.

MS, STERNHEIM: Thank. you.

THE COURT: Actually, I"m réminded, if we have jurors

for me to inquire of, we're going to have them sit in the first

séat of the jury box and tse a handheld mic.

There is one issue that the parties briefed over the

weekend, that you requested to be filed wnder Seal ‘to protect

the privacy of the witness who I've permitted to testify under

‘|

pseudonym. T'think I have a few questions just to see where

exactly we are on that, and I think we should do that. at
sidebar toé protect the privacy interests 6f the witnéss who I

have allowed to testify under pseudonym.

So we will dé that now.
