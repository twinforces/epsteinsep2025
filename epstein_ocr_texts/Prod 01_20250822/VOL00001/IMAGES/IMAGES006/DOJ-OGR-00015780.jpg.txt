LAUNDRY AND DRY CLEANING

« The first rule in laundry is read the label. Determine if you can wash an item, or
if you must take it to be dry-cleaned.

= Sort clothes — white in one pile, colored in another, delicate in yet another.

= Check pockets!

= Wash towels separately.

= Wash all new towels and linen before use.

* Rotate your towels and sheets so as not to wear them out.

= Wor towels should be transferred to staff quarters for staff use.

* Bed linens are taken to Snow White Laundry.

* Clothes that require dry cleaning are taken to Spartan Cleaners. If the garment is
stained, be sure to show the cleaner where it is soiled, mentioning what you think
the stain is. When you collect the clothes, check that the garment is properly
cleaned and the stains have been removed.

= Detergents — Tide with Bleach; Downy fabric softener; Bounce dryer sheets.

= Organize the linen closet. All sheets, pillow cases and towels identically folded.
The folded end should face outward. Separate stacks according to which
bedroom they belong in.
