LCKVMAX2 Summations â€”- Ms. Moe

1 family was struggling financially. She didn't have her own bed
2 to sleep in. Things were really tough at home. She had big

3 dreams of working in the arts one day. She was talented.

4 When Annie was 16, she lived with her mother who was

5 supporting her daughters by herself on a limited income. Annie
6 was hoping to go to a good college.

7 When Kate was 17, she lived with her mother who had

8 been sick. Things were difficult at home and Kate was alone a
9 lot. And she was dazzled by this impressive woman who made her
10 feel special.

11 When Carolyn was 14, she lived with her mom, a single
12 mom who was an alcoholic. She had previously been sexually

13 abused by family members and she told Maxwell about that.

14 Make no mistake. Selecting these girls was predatory
15 behavior. Maxwell and Epstein picked vulnerable girls. They
16 found kids who needed something. They were exploiting that

17 need.

18 So what was the next stage of the playbook? It was

19 isolating the girls. Maxwell and Epstein got them alone in
20 Epstein's enormous houses, alone on trips to Epstein's
21 sprawling ranch, his mansion on the Upper East Side. They got
22 them alone in massage rooms. They were away from their
23 parents.
24 Remember how Jane told you that her mother was never
25 invited when she would spend time with Maxwell and Epstein?
