LCACmax3 A. Farmer â€” cross

1 Thailand in the summer?

2 A. Yeah. That was only about that trip. Yes.

3 Q. And then you had other journals thereafter; right?

4 A. I don't recall if I journaled again in my senior year, but
5 I know I journaled again in college and other times.

6 Q. And this particular journal that we've been looking at and
7 the government had you read from, you actually read from it

8 during some of your media appearances; right?

9 A. I did.

10 Q. On a documentary or a 2020 special or something; right?

11 A. I did.

12 MS. MENNINGER: And if I could ask to turn to page 2
13 of 603, I believe it is. I'm sorry. It's not.

14 Let me back up. I would like to introduce Defendant's
15 Exhibit AF1l, which I think there was a page omitted from the

16 government's exhibit. If I could confer with counsel.

17 THE COURT: You want to indicate the identification

18 mark and then pull it up for me, please.

19 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. And I apologize,
20 your Honor, if I may approach, I do have a paper binder I could
21 give to the Court and the witness because it's multiple pages.
22 There is just a different page than the government's exhibit.
23 THE COURT: Okay. When you get back, the tab number
24 and then, again, just the mark for identification.
25 MS. MENNINGER: AF1, your Honor.
