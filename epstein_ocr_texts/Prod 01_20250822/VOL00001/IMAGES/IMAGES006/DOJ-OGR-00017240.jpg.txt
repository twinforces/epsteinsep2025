LCKCmax9 Charge

1 this evidence in determining whether the government has proven
2 beyond a reasonable doubt Ms. Maxwell's knowledge of the

3 unlawful purposes of the conspiracy.

4 It is for you to determine whether the government has
5 established beyond a reasonable doubt that such knowledge and

6 intent on the part of Ms. Maxwell existed. It is important for
7 you to know that Ms. Maxwell's participation in the conspiracy
8 must be established by independent evidence of her own acts or
9 statements, as well as those of the alleged coconspirators and
10 the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from that evidence.
11 It's not necessary for government to show that

12 Ms. Maxwell was fully informed of all the details of the

13 conspiracy in order for you to infer knowledge on her part. To
14 have guilty knowledge, Ms. Maxwell need not have known the full
15 extent of the conspiracy or all of the activities of all of its
16 participants. It's not even necessary for a defendant to know
17 every other member of the conspiracy.

18 In addition, the duration and extent of Ms. Maxwell's
19 participation has no bearing on the issue of her guilt. She
20 need not have joined the conspiracy at the outset. Ms. Maxwell
21 may have joined it for any purpose at any time in its progress
22 and she will be held responsible for all that was done before
23 she joined and all that was done during the conspiracy's
24 existence while she was a member. Each member of a conspiracy
25 may perform separate and distinct acts and may perform them at
