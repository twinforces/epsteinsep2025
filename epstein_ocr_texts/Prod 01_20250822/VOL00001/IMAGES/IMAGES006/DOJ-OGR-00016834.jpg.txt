LCHCmax3 Dubin â€”- direct

1 A. I don't really recall exactly what I saw. I saw my name

2 and flights.

3 Q. Do you recall when you saw these in the media?

4 A. I can't recall.

a Q. When you read what you believed to be flight records in the
6 media, did anything strike you as being inaccurate in what was
7 being published from your memory?

8 MS. MOE: Same objection, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: I'll permit response to this question. So
10 when you read what you believed to be flight records in the

11 media, did anything strike you as being inaccurate?

12 A. I saw that the media had copied the flight book

13 incorrectly.

14 Q. Okay. What did you believe was incorrect in what the media
15 had copied incorrectly?

16 MS. MOE: Your Honor, we'd object. There is evidence
17 in the record that he can ask the witness about. I'm not sure
18 what we're talking about even at this point.

19 MR. PAGLIUCA: I can discuss this at sidebar if you
20 want, your Honor. I think it's relevant.
2l THE COURT: We'll give the jury their morning break
22 and we'll discuss it.
23 Members of the jury, we'll take a 15-minute break.
