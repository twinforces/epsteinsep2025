1 THE COURT: So, Ms. Williams should be able to get you
2 back here within a few minutes.

3 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, on the logistics about

4 read-backs, we provided the government with a proposed set of

5 redacted transcripts which I think they still need to review,

6 it was late last night, but we'll get that approved. So in

7 case there are read-backs, we'll have a preset redacted

8 transcript.

9 THE COURT: Okay. And I know you're working with

10 Ms. Williams on finalizing the exhibit list. There were a few
11 items missing. She'll get you the new version with the

12 additions once we've checked them and then, presumably, at the
13 lunch break, I'll get verification from both sides that the

14 list is complete and accurate. Okay?

15 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor.

16 THE COURT: And then exhibits going back to the jury,
17 I had asked the parties to confer on how they'd like to handle
18 that. Where are we on that?

19 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor, with exception of the
20 physical exhibits, the parties are going to create a flash
21 drive with exhibits from both parties and indices for those
22 exhibits, which will be available for the jury.
23 THE COURT: So not paper, just the flash drives and
24 then physical exhibits are not going back?
25 MR. ROHRBACH: With the exception of the physical
