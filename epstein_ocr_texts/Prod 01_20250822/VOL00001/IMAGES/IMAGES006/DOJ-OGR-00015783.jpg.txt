RESETTING THE TELEPHONE
Assure that the telephones are always set to the proper date and time. The household
phones may be reset by performing the following:
= Without picking up the receiver, dial 692 on the kitchen phone.
* Follow by dialing 2 digits for the year, 2 digits for the day, 2 digits for the month
and finally, dial 4 digits for the military time.
* The phone should display the new date and time as well as make a noise to
indicate that it has been reset.
Â« Pick up the receiver and then hang-up. This will return the phone to its normal
mode.
