LCGVMAX5 Loftus â€” cross

1 A. Yes.

2 Q. That's a photo of you on the cover, right?

3 A. Very old photo, yes.

4 Q. Okay. And in your book, Witness for the Defense, isn't it
5 true that you wrote: Should psychologists in a court of law

6 act as an advocate for the defense or an impartial educator?

7 My answer to that question, if I am completely honest, is both.
8 A. Could you refer me to the page number?

9 Q. Sure. It's on page 238, I believe it's Government Exhibit
10 1518.

11 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I have a binder with

12 materials that I'm happy to provide at this time if that would
13 be helpful.

14 THE COURT: Okay.

15 A. I've turned to page 238.

16 THE COURT: Do you have for the defense?

17 MS. POMERANTZ: Yes.

18 THE COURT: Okay.

19 Q. Dr. Loftus, I believe there is a binder now that you have.
20 The book works as well, but it is marked as Government Exhibit
21 1518. And the question I had asked was in your book Witness
22 for the Defense, isn't it true that you wrote: Should
23 psychologists in a court of law act as an advocate for the
24 defense or an impartial educator? My answer to that question,
25 if I'm completely honest, is both.
