LCAVMAX2 A. Farmer — direct

1 this witness at all, and it's extremely far afield.

2 MS. MENNINGER: I can tell your Honor we're not

3 challenging the statements that she had a foot massage, a body
4 massage, and so forth. So there may be some of the details of
5 her memory that are off, but we did not put in to challenge

6 that she had those contacts. That's why we worded the Limiting
7 instruction "the physical contact." And to use the word

8 "rape," when she's above the age of consent -—-

9 THE COURT: She's saying not raped. It's the opposite
10 of raped. It's not raped.

11 MS. MENNINGER: Well, your Honor —-

12 THE COURT: I'll allow the question as a prior -- I'm
13 overruling the objection because it's an anticipated prior

14 consistent statement in which the credibility of all of the

15 witnesses as to what occurred has been attacked.

16 I don't think this needs to be sealed.

17 MS. POMERANTZ: No.

18 THE COURT: Okay. Not sealed.
