Challenging the statements that she had a foot massage, a body
massage, and so forth. So there may be some of the details of
her mémory that daré off, but we did not pit tin, to challenge
that she had those contacts. That's why we worded the .imiting

THE COURT: I'l. allow the questaon as a prion -- I'm
overruling thé objectioh because it's ah anticipated prior

MS. POMERANTZ: ‘No.

THE COURT: Okay. Not sealed.
