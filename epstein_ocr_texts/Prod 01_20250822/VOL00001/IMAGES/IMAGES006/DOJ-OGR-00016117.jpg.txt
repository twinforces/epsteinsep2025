1 their own exhibits; so they won't require us to give them paper
2 copies of that. And I believe the Court does as well. So it's
3 only if we are using to refresh or impeach materials that are

4 not 3500 or the government exhibits, at that point we have

S paper that we can give to the government and to the Court and

9 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

10 Just two small points on that.

11 I think Mr. Everdell was mentioning handing out

12 binders to the witness and to the jurors for some of those

13 materials. We just want to note that the government has not

14 yet had an opportunity to review those binders, and so we'd ask
15 for an opportunity to review those before they are handed to

16 the jurors or to the witness.

17 With respect to the second issue of --

18 THE COURT: Well, I guess let's just take the first

19 one.
20 So certainly before anything is shown to the witness
2l or the jurors, the government and I will see the document. I
22 guess the question is to the extent that there's a binder that
23 they may call the jury and the witness's attention to a
24 document at a time, you're requesting to see the full binder in
25 advance?
