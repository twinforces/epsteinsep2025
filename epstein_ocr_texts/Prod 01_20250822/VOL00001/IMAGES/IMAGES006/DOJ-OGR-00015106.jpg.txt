affirmatively support‘unsealing, ‘subject to appropriate redactions to protect their personal privacy.
Their consent'to disclosure should weigh in favor of-unsealing under this factor. Further, because.
the Government:intends to redact.the names.and ‘identifying information of the victims, there is no
risk that the privacy ofthe victims will be jeopardized. Jn re Kuiler, 800 F. Supp. 2d.42, 50 (D.D.C.
201.1) (procedures for reviewing ‘transcripts to ‘protect named individuals, as needed “allay any
remaining privacy concerns”).

2.. The Court Should Assess the Appropriateness of the Redactions.

The-grand jury transcripts should be released subject:to narrowly tailored.redactions of the
names, likenesses, and identifying information of the victims. ‘The Court should. not, however,
rubber stamp redactions to withhold from the public “information. related to third parties ‘who
neithei. have been charged or alleged to be involved in the crimes with which Epstein and Maxwell
were charged,” Epstein.Dkt. No..66 at 7. Any:effort'to redact'third party names:smacks of a cover
up. The Government does not élaborate on what protocol. it is using to redact other “third party”
jhamés of which types of individuals it:seeksto-protéct ih this way.. To the extent'the Government
for some reason seeks to tedact'the names of other Epstein and Maxwell affiliates on.the basis that
‘thesé individuals “neither have been charged.or alleged to be involved” in thei crimes, the Court
should exercise its independent authority to ensure that any redactions. are tailored to sérve
compelling interests. See generally Brown v: Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 50 (2d Cir, 2019) (even if
materials are not considered judicial documents to ‘which.a presumption of public access applies,
“a-court must still articulate: specific and: substantial reasons for sealing such. material”).

Ax ‘Redactions of the Names and, Identifying Information of the Victims: Is.
Appropriate.

The privacy interests of Ms. Farmer and other victims (as victims of sex: abuse’ and human.
trafficking) are strong. In Giuffre v. Maxwell, Judge Preska repeatedly recognized the “gravity of.
the privacy interests” of “victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse.” Giuffre v. Maxwell, 2020:
USS. Dist. LEXIS. 221599, at: *16 (S.D.N.Y.-Nov.25,.2020). The. Court explained. that “{t]hose
initerests are particularly acute given:that the psychological and emotional. wellbeing of survivors
of alleged sexual assaults tay. be implicated by such a.broad. disclosure.” Giuffre v. Dershowitz,
2020 WL 5439623, at'*2 (S:D.N-Y. Sept. 9, 2020). Aind.“[t]hose interests weigh no less:heavily”
where “it is law enforcement seeking modification of the protective order instead of a private
litigant.” Giuffre v.. Maxwell, 2020 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 221599, at *16. In Doe J v. JP Morgan
Chase Bank, N.A., Judge Rakoff recently ‘found that ‘the privacy interest of a Victim of Epstein
justified sealing because “[p]totecting the identity of sexual assault survivors atid the. detail’ of
their assaults is traditionally considered private and. has been widely recognized as a compelling:
reason to limit public access to [even] judicial documents.” 742 F. Supp: 3d 387, 397 (S.D.N.Y.
