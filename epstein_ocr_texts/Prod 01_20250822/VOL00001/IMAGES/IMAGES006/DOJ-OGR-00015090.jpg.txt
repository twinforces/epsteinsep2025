be affected by disclosure are still alive; and (ix) the additional
need for maintaining secrecy in the particular case in
question.
In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106. The Court noted that “all of these factors and their
precise significance must be evaluated in the context of the specific case.” Id. at 107.

The timing of a request to unseal is “one of the most crucial elements” to be
considered by a district court. In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 107. Here, the grand jury
convened just five years ago, not decades ago. This is not a case where the “passage
of time erode[d] many of the justifications for continued secrecy.” Id. Nor is it a case
where time has brought about the “death of the principal parties involved in the
investigations, as well as that of their immediate families.” Jd. at 107. Epstein may
be dead, but Maxwell is alive and litigating her case.

Maxwell’s Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is pending before the Supreme
Court. She is preparing a habeas petition. Disclosure of grand jury materials at this
stage risks irreparably tainting the legal process by injecting sealed testimony into
the public debate while judicial review is ongoing. The reputational harm from
releasing incomplete, potentially misleading grand jury testimony, untested by cross-
examination, would be severe and irrevocable. Those allegations, if released in raw,
untested form, would inevitably influence any future legal proceeding should
Maxwell succeed in her post-conviction litigation. The government's proposal to
“redact victim-identifying information” does not mitigate this harm. The substance
of the allegations, not the names, creates the prejudice. Public curiosity is insufficient
