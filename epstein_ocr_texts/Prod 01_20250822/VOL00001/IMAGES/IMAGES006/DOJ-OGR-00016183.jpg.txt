1 MR. EVERDELL: As long as the Court instructs the

2 jurors not to --

3 THE COURT: I'll tell them that I may direct them to

4 open binders under the chairs and they should not do so until

a directed. Okay?

6 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.

7 THE COURT: Other exhibits, nonsealed exhibits, those
8 will be shown on the screen?

9 MS. COMEY: That's correct, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: All right. 10-minute break. Thank you.
11 (Recess)

12 THE COURT: The jury inquired as to the holiday

13 schedule. So, I did intend to tell them at the end of the day
14 that the plan is to sit the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday before
15 Christmas and the Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday before New Year's
16 Eve and New Year's, and that I'll fill them in on any

17 adjustments to the schedule as we go and give them as much

18 notice as I can.

19 I also intend to tell them that I'd like them to get
20 here at 9:00 and the jury room will be open earlier than that
21 and breakfast and the like so that we can start promptly at
22 9:30. And counsel, I'll meet with you tomorrow, let's say
23 8:45, to make sure we can cover issues before the jury arrives.
24 I do plan to address the scheduling issue at the end of the
25 day.
