Mexico rather ‘than, the place where they did put the comma, then

that would have told us, can't she be responsible for aiding in
the transportation, of ‘thé rettirn flight, comma, but not’ the
flight to New Mexico, comma, That would then put the wherne/if

the intent was --

THE COURT: That. would. be an entirely different
meaning to the question.

MS. MENNINGER: I think so.

THE COURT: ‘No, I agréé. What IT don't know is T don't
know what they meant and I don't know how much weight. to put on
that Gormima placement; because, as you've noted, that precise
sentence without, that comma has an, entirely different meaning.

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor,

And I thank at the point at. which we'me parsing jury
notes like statutes this finely, I think it illustrates the
point that this note 1s confusing; that we're mot. sure what the
jury is asking abdéut either factually or legally.

The question is about the second element; and so we
think the proper course is to refer the jury to thosé
pagticular ,instructions. And the jury ids free to send sa
Clarifying hote, if they wish to do sé. But I think when we
are parsing commas this finely in a note that is unclear, it"s
unéleéar which Clauses. are modifying which clauses, or which
flights we're even talking about, I think it's far too
confusing to give simple answers here.
