1 MR. EVERDELL: And then the next page, page 45,

2 line 1, there's the word "minor," which would be "an individual

3 under the age of 18."

4 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, in this paragraph, since

a this is the conspiracy that applies to multiple minors, I think

6 it should be "individuals under the age of 18" rather than just

7 one.

8 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine.

9 THE COURT: For the second -- yeah. Right. So that
10 is important that we're doing these one at a time. So line 24,
11 it's "an individual under the age of 18." And then the next
12 page, page 45, line 1, it's --

13 MR. ROHRBACH: I think they both should be --
14 THE COURT: They both should be "an individual under
15 the age of —--"
16 MR. ROHRBACH: I think they both should be
17 "individuals under the age of 18."
18 THE COURT: I'm sorry. You're right. They're both
19 the conspiracy.
20 MR. EVERDELL: That's right, your Honor.
21 THE COURT: Okay. I apologize. Let me start again.
22 So Instruction No. 34, line 24, “individuals under the age of
23 18," on line 24; and then the following page, line 1, same
24 change, "individuals under the age of 18"; and then same change
25 on line 3.
