LCKVMAX4 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 something that you forget ever. You remember an adult woman

2 groping your breasts. You remember a middle-aged man touching
3 your vagina. You remember feeling scared and frozen and

4 trapped and confused. Your common sense tells you these women
5 know what happened to them in their own lives. They know it.

6 These are powerful memories of trauma, and they've carried

7 these haunting memories with them for years.

8 But when the defense talks about memory, they want to
9 talk about experiments, experiments that Professor Loftus

10 performed ina lab, experiments like the one where she tried to
11 convince people that they saw Bugs Bunny at Disneyland;

12 experiments where she told people that a stop sign was a yield
13 sign. Don't be distracted by that.

14 Loftus has made a career of being a witness for the

15 defense. And she said in her book by that name, she doesn't

16 even pretend to be an impartial expert. She admits she is an
17 advocate for the defense. And over the years, as she has

18 admitted, she has been paid by criminal defendants to testify
19 on their behalf. She's made a name for herself as a witness
20 for the defense in high-profile trials. And most importantly,
21 this case isn't about Bugs Bunny, it isn't about stop signs;
22 it's about sexual abuse, repeated sexual abuse of teenage
23 girls. Loftus told you, never done a study about that.
24 So all of that testimony she gave about implanted
25 memories or corrupted memories, it was totally irrelevant to
