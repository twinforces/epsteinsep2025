1 trauma bonding is typically referring to a relationship of

2 attachment and connection between the pimp and the sex worker.
3 We know that the majority of sex workers are under some

4 third-party control. And we know that the trauma bonding is

5 often the means by which the pimp has coerced the sex worker to
6 get them to do their bidding, similar to the kinds of

7 techniques that traffickers might use. So there's a

8 significant amount of overlap. And there has been actually

9 some recent research -- this is one example -- but others have
10 specifically looked at grooming as it applies to trafficking,
11 for example.
