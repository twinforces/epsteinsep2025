LBAGma x2 Rocechio - Direct

trauma bonding is typically referring to a relationship of
attachment and connection between. the pimp and ‘the sex worker.
We know that the majority of sex workers are under some
third-party control. And. we know that ‘the ‘trauma bonding: is
often the means by which the pimp has coerced the sex worker to
get them to do ‘their bidding, similar to the kinds of
techniques that traffickers might use. So there's a
significant amount of overlap. And there has been actually
some: recent, research -- this is one example -- but others have
specifically looked at grooming as it applies to, trafficking,
for example.
