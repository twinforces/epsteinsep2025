LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 As we go through the stories of each of these accusers
2 and each of the witnesses, you need to keep your eye on the

3 thing that the government hasn't, how these stories have

4 changed dramatically over time.

5 Carolyn, you heard, had a lawyer back in 2008, and she
6 started out giving a very clearcut story about Jeffrey Epstein
7 and also about a woman named Sarah Kellen, who she also sued.

8 She had no trouble articulating her claims. She had a lawyer,
9 she filed a lawsuit, a lawsuit that didn't mention, in 290

10 paragraphs, Ghislaine Maxwell one time.

11 The same is true with Jane. She told stories about

12 Epstein. Initially, she said she wasn't sure that Maxwell was
13 ever in the room. And don't be fooled about this difficulty in
14 disclosing the details of it. She had two male lawyers. She
15 had no difficulty disclosing it to them before she ever met

16 with the government. And when she walked in to talk to the

17 government, she told them she wasn't sure if Maxwell was ever
18 in the room. But her lawyer told her it would help her with

19 her case if she cooperated with this prosecution, and so she
20 did, and the lawyers kept asking, the FBI kept asking, are you
21 sure that maybe the person who had a foreign accent was perhaps
22 Ghislaine Maxwell? Are you sure maybe he groped your breasts
23 instead of massaging your upper chest? Are you sure there
24 wasn't sexual abuse in New Mexico? Perhaps you met him when
25 you were only 14? Perhaps you didn't just meet Epstein then,
