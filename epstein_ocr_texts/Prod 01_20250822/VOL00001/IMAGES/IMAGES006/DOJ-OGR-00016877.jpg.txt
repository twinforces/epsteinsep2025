trial subpoena weeks ago.

MS, MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.

I Gan maké a representation about the number of names

that were mentioned. in. the volumes ‘of 3500 material. I know

your Honor has 'réecéived the téstifying Witness 1, but I carn
tell your Honor there was. approximately 900 nontestifying
witnesses, With Similar volumes of interviews with those
individuals. So the fact that we received it on October 11th
doésn't mean that's the day we saw this.

THE COURT: Of course, Fair enough,,

I'm just trying to understand why I got an application
at Lli:54, it was almost -- 11:54, seeking enforcement of a,
trial subpoena regarding a witness who's been disclosed, a
potential defense witness who's been disclosed for months, who
the défense néticed and attempted to serve a subpdend On, who,

unlike the other witnesses the defense attempted to serve a

subpoena én; you received no Gontact.

I know you're busy. I get that. You, have a
milli6n == and I lean that génuinély, obviously. I know this
team -- both teams are working extremely hard. This one is
just a little hard to uhderstand, unless maybe you thought I
would exclude ‘the witness.
