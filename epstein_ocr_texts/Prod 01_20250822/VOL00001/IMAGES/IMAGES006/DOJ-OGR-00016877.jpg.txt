1 trial subpoena weeks ago.

2 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.

3 I can make a representation about the number of names
4 that were mentioned in the volumes of 3500 material. I know

a your Honor has received the testifying Witness 1, but I can

6 tell your Honor there was approximately 500 nontestifying

7 witnesses with similar volumes of interviews with those

8 individuals. So the fact that we received it on October 11th

9 doesn't mean that's the day we saw this.

10 THE COURT: Of course. Fair enough.

11 I'm just trying to understand why I got an application
12 at 11:54, it was almost -- 11:54, seeking enforcement of a

13 trial subpoena regarding a witness who's been disclosed, a

14 potential defense witness who's been disclosed for months, who
15 the defense noticed and attempted to serve a subpoena on, who,
16 unlike the other witnesses the defense attempted to serve a

17 subpoena on, you received no contact.

18 I know you're busy. I get that. You have a

19 million -- and I mean that genuinely, obviously. I know this
20 team -- both teams are working extremely hard. This one is
21 just a little hard to understand, unless maybe you thought I
22 would exclude the witness.
