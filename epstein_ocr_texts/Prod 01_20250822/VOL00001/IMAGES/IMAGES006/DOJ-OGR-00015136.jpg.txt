financial hardship, substance use disorders, and prior sexual abuse. Maxwell purported to
befriend the girls to gain their trust and create the illusion of friendship and responsible adult
supervision, while isolating them from others. She then manipulated that trust to normalize
sexual abuse by Epstein and herself, often through the pretext of giving Epstein “massages.”
Maxwell personally participated in acts of sexual abuse, including, for example, instructing
then—14-year-old Jane how to touch Epstein’s penis during a “massage,” and touching Jane’s
breasts herself. Maxwell and Epstein also paid young girls hundreds of dollars of cash in
exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused. Once a girl was introduced to these
sexualized massages, she was offered more money if she brought other girls to engage in
sexualized massages. Maxwell also fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s various households
where sexual abuse occurred, directing employees to “see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing.”
