Q. When you first visited this ranch, was thé main house you

No, it, was not.

ie)

About. when was construction on this main house completed?

Tit. was under construction for a while, that's, why he had
the triple-wide trailer to stay during the construction, But I
would éstimaté probably late '90s, maybe 2000 is when the house
got finished.

QO; Ana so in the mid to late '90s, when you visited the ranch,
where did Mr. Epstein stay?

A; Hé would stay up at the l1d6dge or the triple=wide mobile
home I described.

QO. Could you déeséribe what the interior 6f that triple=wide
ledge looked like.

A; Sure. AS I méntidned, it was a triplé=wide trailér that
had, a wood western, facade buitdt around it ‘to make it, a little
more dattrdctivé tHhah just. a mébile home. Once you went in the
front door, there was a large wooden deck in the front of ‘the
héuse liké you would see in a western movie. Ahd you went in
the front door, you walked into the living room which had a
fireplace to the left.
