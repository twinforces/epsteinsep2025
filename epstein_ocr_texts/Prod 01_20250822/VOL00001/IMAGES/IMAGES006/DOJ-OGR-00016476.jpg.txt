1 THE COURT: Okay.

2 MS. MENNINGER: I think so, your Honor.

3 THE COURT: All right. I'm just looking at the

4 calendar. The defense case begins on the 16th. We have the

S 16th, the 17th. We'll do the charging conference on the 18th,
6 if the defense case continues into the next week.

7 But let me just encourage -- given this break that

8 we're going on and -- here's just the one thing I want to say.
9 T'll hear from you, but I want -- if the defense were to rest
10 on the 17th, for example, then I will expect closings, absent a
11 rebuttal case, on the 20th. Everybody agree with that?

12 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes, Judge.

13 But I think it's highly unlikely that we will complete
14 it on Friday, and I would ask the Court to take that into

15 consideration.

16 THE COURT: Okay. So let's say you rest on the 20th,
17 Ms. Sternheim.

18 MS. STERNHEIM: That is our anticipation.

19 THE COURT: Okay. So then we would anticipate
20 closings on the 21st; correct?
21 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, we would like to at least
22 discuss our concerns about a jury deliberating one day prior to
23 a Christmas holiday. I think that given that, as was
24 Thanksgiving, Christmas this year is particularly celebratory
25 since people were not able to do that last year.
