Ill. Discussion

A. The In re Craig Factors

The Court directed the Government to “address[] with specificity the[] [/n re Craig] factors
and any other factors that the Government views as germane to its application.” (Epstein Dkt. 63
at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3). What follows is a discussion of each of the /n re Craig factors, which
are designed to assist the Court in exercising its “careful judgment” in balancing the interests in
public disclosure in unique circumstances of strongly expressed and wide-ranging public interest
and the traditional considerations concerning the secrecy of grand jury proceedings. /n re Craig,
131 F.3d at 104.

1. The Identity of the Party Seeking Disclosure

The first factor considers which party is seeking disclosure of grand jury materials; the
identity of the party seeking disclosure “carr[ies] great weight.” Jn re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106. Here,
the Government is seeking disclosure of grand jury transcripts, a request that is consistent with
increasing calls for additional disclosures in this matter.? The Government’s position “serve[s] as
a preliminary indication that the need for secrecy is not especially strong,” even if it is “not
dispositive.” /d.; see also id. (“Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can
government opposition preclude it.”). While the Government acknowledges the extraordinary
? See, e.g., Press Release, Chairman Comer Subpoenas Ghislaine Maxwell for Deposition at
Federal Prison - United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability (“The facts and
circumstances surrounding both [Ms. Maxwell] and Mr. Epstein’s cases have received immense
public interest and scrutiny. At the outset of the 119th Congress, on February 11, 2025, the
Committee and the Task Force on the Declassification of Federal Secrets sent a letter to the U.S.
Department of Justice requesting a briefing regarding documents in the Department’s possession
regarding ‘the investigation into and prosecution of Jeffrey Epstein.” On May 8, the Task Force
sent another letter to the Department requesting the public release of ‘the entirety of the Epstein
files’ and a briefing regarding the release of these files.”).
