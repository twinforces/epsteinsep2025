prior vulnerabilities with respect te childhood sexual abuse?
A. I do.

Q. Can ‘you explain.

A. So, again; I'll use an ‘example in the civil arena. If I'm
asked, as part of my forensic evaluation, to opine about the

impact. of an alleged event, say childhood sexual abuse, and the

degree to which a person's current difficulties are related to
that event, I ‘have to take prior vulnerability into account,

because part of what I'm looking at is, how can I determine

which of these persons' current difficulties are related to the
sexual abuse or maybe related to other things that have
happened in their past. So we know, because of the
vulnerability literature, that, if somebody is being abused in
adolescence, it wouldn't bé at all. unusual. for thém also to
have a history of earlier childhood ‘sexual. abuse.

So I havé to look at the intéraction of thosé prior
vulnerabilities and ways in which those prior vulnerabilities
both may have madé thé individual moré vulnerable to the

grooming behavior and to the subsequent ‘sexual. abuse, and also

wayS in which those prior vulnerabilities may havé interacted

with the abuse to create more adverse outcomes for ‘the

individual, I'm evaluating.

Q. How does what you have observed in ‘your forensic practice
compare to6 your clinical practice with respect to individuals
in, higher-risk. groups?
