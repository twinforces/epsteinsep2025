1 It would be something we speak with the government

2 about and brief if we believe that the testimony elicited

3 during the government's case would give rise to such testimony
4 from any other attorney.

a) MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

6 We'd be happy to confer with the defense about any of
7 these issues.

8 Our view remains the same as it has been throughout

9 this case, which is that there's no basis for calling

10 plaintiffs' attorneys as defense witnesses. There's no basis
11 for waiving attorney-client privilege. And the Court has been
12 very clear that that issue should be briefed in full before any
13 witnesses along those lines should be called. But, again,

14 we're happy to confer with the defense about that.

15 THE COURT: Okay. You'll confer.

16 The one that's been teed up is where there's an

17 email --

18 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

19 THE COURT: -- between you all and which it appears,
20 at least on the face of the email, that counsel made a
2l disclosure.
22 MS. MENNINGER: That's similar to other issues, your
23 Honor.
24 THE COURT: It's in that context that I've encouraged
25 a stipulation as to what was relayed to the government.
