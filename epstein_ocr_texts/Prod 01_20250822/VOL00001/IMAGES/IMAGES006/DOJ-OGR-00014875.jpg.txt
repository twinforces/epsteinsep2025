where much of the abuse occurred and where Kellen worked.** We
therefore hold that the District Court did not err in applying the
leadership enhancement.

With respect to the length of the sentence, the District Court
properly discussed the sentencing factors when imposing the
sentence, and described, at length, Maxwell’s “pivotal role in
facilitating the abuse of the underaged girls through a series of
deceptive tactics.”°” The District Court recognized that the sentence
“must reflect the gravity of Ms. Maxwell's conduct, of Ms. Maxwell’s
offense, the pivotal role she played in facilitating the offense, and the
significant and lasting harm it inflicted.”°* And the District Court
explained that “a very serious, a very significant sentence is necessary
to achieve the purposes of punishment” under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). In
sum, the District Court did not err by failing to adequately explain its
sentence.

CONCLUSION
To summarize, we hold as follows:
56 A-A17.
7 SA-459,
58 SA-461,
