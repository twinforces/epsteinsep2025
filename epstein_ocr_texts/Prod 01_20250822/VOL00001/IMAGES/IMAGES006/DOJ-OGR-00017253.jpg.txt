LCKCmax9 Charge

1 evidence of that fact, but on the combination of the facts that
2 I've asked you to assume, it would be reasonable and logical

3 for you to conclude that between the time you arrived at the

4 courthouse and the time these people walked in it had started

5 to rain.

6 That's all there is to circumstantial evidence. You

7 infer based on reason, experience, and common sense from an

8 established fact the existence or the nonexistence of some

9 other fact. Many facts, such as a person's state of mind, can
10 only rarely be proved by direct evidence.

11 Circumstantial evidence is of no less value than of

12 direct evidence. It is a general rule that the law makes no

13 distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence, but

14 simply requires that, before convicting Ms. Maxwell, you, the
15 jury, must be satisfied of her guilt beyond a reasonable doubt
16 from all of the evidence in the case.

17 Instruction No. 43: Inferences.

18 During the trial, and as I give you these

19 instructions, you've heard and will hear the term inference.
20 For instance, if, in their closing arguments, attorneys have
21 asked you to infer based on your reason, experience, and common
22 sense from one or more established facts the existence of some
23 other fact. I've instructed you on circumstantial evidence in
24 that it involves inferring a fact based on other facts, your
25 reason, and common sense.
