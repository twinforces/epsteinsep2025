1 in '94, '95, and '96. So I'm not really sure.

2 THE COURT: There was a witness who testified as to it

5 MS. MENNINGER: Without saying when, yes. A witness

8 to foundation, but there wasn't an objection to foundation.

9 In any event, you'll brief whether the defense is

10 obligated under Rule 16 to produce in advance to the government
11 documents that clearly -- and we're not talking about

12 statements.

20 you have something that you want to impeach with it, you
21 couldn't have produced that in advance. So the question is not
22 that, but obviously when you anticipate particular testimony
23 and you have material that you think impeaches that you intend
24 to introduce as evidence through cross examination. Whether
25 you're obligated under Rule 16 to turn that over in advance,
