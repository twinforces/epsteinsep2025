1 THE COURT: But I'll hear if anybody has an objection.
2 MS. COMEY: No, your Honor.

3 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.

4 THE COURT: OK. Anything else on that?

5) MR. EVERDELL: No. I think we just have to work a few
6 redactions out.

7 THE COURT: And I think we have one more minor edit.

8 It was just a minor thing, but we can't find it.

9 Let me just note, I want to thank the court staff who
10 worked on Saturday to make this possible, and my thanks to

11 counsel and the parties for doing it. I appreciate everybody's
12 willingness to work on a Saturday. Thank you.

13 Page 51, line 13, missing the word "at." "The

14 government has to prove that at least one of the overt acts."
15 So inserting "at."

16 MR. EVERDELL: No objection, your Honor.

17 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes.

18 THE COURT: All right. We'll make that change.

19 With that, thank you, everyone. I will see you Monday
20 at 8:30.
