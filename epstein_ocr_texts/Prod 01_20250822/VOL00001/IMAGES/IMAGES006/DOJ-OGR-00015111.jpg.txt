soinc, the Maxwell. conviction,is the only:meannglul measure of enmmal accountability;
‘its erosion would. be devastating:'

Of significant. concern, the same government that :failed to provide notice to the: vicims before
mioving this.Court to unseal the:grand jury materials:is now the government:representing to this Court
that it has provided appropriate notice to thé vicuins or their cotinsel aid. has Conducted. a proper

deep: anxicty ‘over whether the redactions were ‘in. fact adequate. Consequently, we requested
yesterday that. the government identify which of our clients were referenced. fo the grand jury. The
government responded promptly and provided clarification. However; we have strong: reason to
belicve that: additional individtials—whorn, we also: represcut—were likely referenced in those
miatenals but.were not identified. to us by the. government

Itremains unclear whether notice was instead. provided to prior counsel, whethertheir omission,was

Il. Rule 6(€) and Eleventh, Circuit Authority Require Heéightened Caution and Narrow

Grand j jury secrecy’ is'a “long-established. policy” safeguarded’ by Rule 6(c). Douglas Oil Co. v. Petrol
Stops Nw, 44) US. 211, 219-23 (1979). Even. where. disclosure :may be considered, the movant
noust:establish.a par ticularized need that outweighs the countervailing:interests.in secrecy, and any
disclosure should. be no broader than. necessary. Jd. at 222-23. The Eleventh Circuit has further
held thatdisttiét courts Jack anherent:aathority to order grand jury disclosure outside ‘the exceptions
in Rule 6(e). 2tch v. United States, 953 F.3d.1226, 1237-38 (1th Cir. .2020) (éii banc); see also

Here, eve if the Court.were to:find.a Rule 6(e) path to:limited:disclosure, victims” CVRA nghts.and
the traditional, interests protected. by grand. jury secrecy converge in favor’ of extraordinary’ care:
figorous judicial, screening, robust redactions, minimization of any risk of re-ideutification, and
imeaniigtul victim participation before aiiything is made’public. Related privacy provisions reinforce

' Several-victims have: already died by suicide, drug‘overdosc,. or under tragic. circumsiances:tied directly to
the. trauma’ caused by Epstem and Maxwell, The psychological-toll of this abuse is ongoing: A‘ ‘pais ‘don, issiied
a: ‘silence, or secrecy, ‘would, reignite. decfy trauma; destabilize the already-fragile, healing “process of many
survivors, and could result in ‘further irreparable. harm—including loss. of life. Tt would suggest: to. victims
everywhere that powerful predators are once again above the law.
