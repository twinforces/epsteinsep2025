1 THE COURT: Okay. Have we made it to 17?

2 MR. EVERDELL: We've made it to 19, in fact.

3 THE COURT: 19. Wow. Progress.

4 MR. EVERDELL: Page 19 is the next one, your Honor.

S THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.

6 MR. EVERDELL: First, on line 5, there's another "or

7 foreign," which we can omit.

8 THE COURT: Okay. Let me just look.

9 Yeah. Okay.

10 MR. ROHRBACH: It would need to be ellipses since this
11 is the statutory text, but that's fine with the government.

12 THE COURT: So we'll do, page 19, line 5, it will

13 read, "Travel in interstate... commerce," cutting "or foreign"
14 and replacing with the ellipses.

15 Okay. Next page.

16 MR. EVERDELL: Same page, your Honor, line 4.

17 Don't worry. I tried to be efficient about this.

18 We'll go quickly.

19 THE COURT: That's fine.
20 MR. EVERDELL: Line 4. There is the inclusion of the
21 statutory text "or coerces," and since we don't have any
22 evidence of coercion, our proposal would be to add -- have it
23 read "knowingly persuades, induces, or entices... any
24 individual."
25 THE COURT: Or in brackets.
