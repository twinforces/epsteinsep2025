LBT.CMAX4: Visoski - direct,

passengers on Mr. Epstéin's private planes?

A. My interaction would be mestly when they either boarded or

6xited the airplane. I would dssist with loading ltiggage. So
my interaction. was brief. Most of my duties were’ obviously up
in, the cockpit.

Q. How, if at all, did you learn the names of passengers on a
particular flight on one of Mr. Epstéin's, planes?

A. Lt was mainly not a priority to get a mame, but we would

try to be as accurdté as we could. We wotild -- Mr. Epstein,

Ms. Maxwell, or even any of these secretaries at the office
would say, you kn6w; so many people are going oh the aircraft.
It wasn't as much important as a ‘pilot knowing that how many

people were going as 6pposed to specifying the name if it. was a

domestic flight. If it was an, international flight, I would

need their hdames, et Getera.

Q. Did, you learn the mame of every sangle passenger who flew

on Mr; Epstein':s planes?
