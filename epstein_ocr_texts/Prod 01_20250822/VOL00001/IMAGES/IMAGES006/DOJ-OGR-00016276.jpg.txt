LCAVMAX2 A. Farmer â€” direct

1 felt very -- like, I thought I had been brought there because

2 of, you know, one set of reasons; like, I thought that he was

3 interested and they were both interested in me as, like, a

4 student; that they may want to help in an academic way. So I

5 was trying to be sort of impressive in that way and talk about
6 things that they wanted to hear about. And all these

7 experiences made me feel that they had a very different

8 interest in me. And so it was extremely kind of disorienting

9 and I just was wanted to be done with it.
10 Q. What, if anything, did you discuss with Maxwell during your
11 last day on the ranch in New Mexico?
12 A. What I remember about that, just this final conversation
13 was that I was sort of trying to reengage with her around,
14 like, this academic stuff. And I had brought, like, three by
15 five note cards for this paper that I was writing where I had
16 little, like, facts on them. And we were sitting outside on
17 what seemed like kind of a deck area. And I was going through
18 them and I was trying to get her to talk to me about them, I
19 think, in a way, like, to make myself feel better, like, maybe
20 they did care about that. And she just seemed like very
21 disinterested and kind of like, you know, she didn't care.
22 Q. Did you say good-bye to Epstein and Maxwell before you left
23 New Mexico?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. Where did you go when you left New Mexico?
