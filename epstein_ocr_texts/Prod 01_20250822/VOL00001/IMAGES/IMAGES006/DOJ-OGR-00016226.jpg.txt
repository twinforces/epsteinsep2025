1 (In open court)

2 THE COURT: I've looked at the transcript, and the

3 government expressly said it wasn't moving 52 in its entirety.
4 So that's what's in issue and that's what I reserved on. So

5 it's the subletters. Then 52, what's been marked for

6 identification as 52 should be part of the record for purposes
7 of the 901 issue. Okay?

8 MS. MOB: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.

9 THE COURT: But what's been moved are the sub-sheet

10 copies.

11 If nothing else, I'll step down until we have our

12 jury.

13 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

14 THE COURT: Thank you.

15 (Recess)

16 THE COURT: We have our jury. Any reason not to bring
17 them in, counsel?

18 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you.

19 MS. MENNINGER: No, your Honor. Thank you.
20 THE COURT: Please bring in the jury.
