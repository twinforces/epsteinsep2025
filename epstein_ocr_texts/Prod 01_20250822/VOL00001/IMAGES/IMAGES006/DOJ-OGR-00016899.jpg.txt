1 abandoned living in East 69th in or about January of 1996.

11 Bast 69th Street. And then subsequent to that, other events

21 instructions are given to the jury in the event that it is
22 criminally noticed; and in a criminal case, the jury is to be
23 instructed that it may or may not accept the noticed fact as
24 conclusive. I'm not intending or offering the full documents
25 that I just cited to your Honor, but the fact of Mr. Epstein's
