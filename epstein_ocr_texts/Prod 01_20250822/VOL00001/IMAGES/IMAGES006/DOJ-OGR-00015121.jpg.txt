b. The privacy interests (iit outweigh any historical
interest justifying disclosure
The same legal analysis applies to the privacy interests of While
the government has not provided any information about the context m which
are mentioned in the grand jury materials, the potential harm to the privacy interests of these
third parties from unsealing of the transcripts is significant.
This Court and the government are aware of the media appetite for all information related
to this case, regardless of whether such information is true or false
The unsealing o
even if mnocuous, will only serve to allow for
at a time when the political attention on this case 1s perhaps
at its most significant. Cf United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo IT’), 71 F.3d 1044, 1051 (2d Cw.
1995) (“Courts have long declined to allow public access simply to cater to a morbid craving for
that which is sensational and impure.” (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Court should
order that the transcripts remain under seal.
I. If the Court determines that unsealing is warranted despite the weight of
precedent, redactions should be appropriately tailored to protect
privacy interests
In the event this Court exercises its discretionary power to unseal these grand jury
materials, | respectfully request that its order doing so include detailed guidance to the
overnment on the appropriate redactions that should be applied prior to any unsealing and that
a. provided with copies of the materials in which they appear in advance so that they
may provide input in order to protect their privacy interests. The government’s statement that it
will “make appropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying
information prior to releasing the transcripts” does not provide clarity as to what precisely the
government intends to redact. Any redactions should include not only a names, but
also any other personal identifying information and any surrounding context by which the public
may be able to deduce the identities of the individuals being discussed.°

5 Failure to redact the surrounding context could allow the substance of redacted testimony to be readily deduced.
