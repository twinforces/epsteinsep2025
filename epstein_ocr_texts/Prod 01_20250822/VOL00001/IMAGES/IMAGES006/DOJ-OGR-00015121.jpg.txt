b. The privacy interests of[ _____—=—=—_—i| outweigh.any historical

interest justifying disclosure

The same legal analysis applies to the:privacy interests :of| ‘While
the: government’ has not provided any. information about:the context:n’ which
are:mentioned.in the grand.j Jury materials, the potential: harm.to the:privacy inferests.of these

third:parties from unsealing of the transcripts is significant:

This Court and the government are aware:of the media appetite:for all information related.
to this case, régardless of whether stich infotmation is true or false

even if mnocuous, will only ‘serve'to-allow for
at a’ time when the political attention on this:case 1s ‘perhaps
at its most significant. Cf. United States v. Amodeo (“Amodeo IT’), 71 F.3d 1044, 1051 (2d Cr.
1995) (“Courts have long declined to allow public-access simply to cater to a’ ‘morbid: raving for
that :which is sensational and 1 inipure.’ (internal quotation:marks omitted)). The Court:should
order that:the transcripts:remain under seal.

II. If the Court determines that unsealing is warranted despite:the weightof _
precedent, redactions should be appropriately tailored to protect
privacy interests:

In the event: this Court exercises ifs.discrétionary power to tnseal these grand jury
materials, [ respectfully request that its.order:doing: so include detailed guidance to:the
overnment onthe appropriate redactions that:should be applied prior to: any unsealing and.that
[pe provided. with-copies of the:materials in which: they appear in advance so. that they
may provide: input in. order to’ protect their privacy interests. The government’s statement that: at.

will: “make. appropriate: redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying
information prior to releasing the transcripts” does not provide clarity as-to-what precisely the
governnent intends:to redact. Any-redactions should. include-not only[ | names, but
also any other. personal identifying. information and.any surrounding context by which the public
may be able fo deduce the identities of the. individuals being discussed?

° Failure to redact'the surrounding context.could allow the. substance of redactedtestimony'‘to:be: readily:deduced.
