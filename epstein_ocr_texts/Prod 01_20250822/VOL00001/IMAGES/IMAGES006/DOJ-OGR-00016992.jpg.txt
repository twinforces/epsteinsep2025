1 were lots of women there and, you know, there are many -- no

2 one --â€” no one observed women that they thought were under age.
3 But it's not -- I don't believe there is going to be

4 an argument, Ms. Maxwell is not guilty because she couldn't

S have known that these four people were whatever age they are.

6 I think the argument is going to be, they weren't that age.

7 That's what I think the defense's position is here, your Honor,
8 not, you know, gee, Mr. Epstein slipped in a couple of

9 teenagers on me here.

10 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, unless the defense is

11 stipulating that Ms. Maxwell knew the ages of these victims,

12 and it's an open issue. The defense has elicited from Larry

13 Visoski, Kimberly Espinosa, the appearance of the victims.

14 They elicited from Carolyn that she was told not to tell -- or
15 told to tell people at the house that she was 17 or 18, when

16 she was younger than that. So the evidence that's been

17 elicited certainly puts the defendant's knowledge of the

18 victims' age at issue.

19 THE COURT: Yes. There are two issues. There's the
20 first question, what age were they. And you contest that. But
21 then there's the second question of, let's assume the jury
22 concludes that they were under the age of 17, then there is the
23 question of Ms. Maxwell's knowledge, and that seems to me to
24 have been put in issue through argument and -- through openings
25 and questions asked on cross.
