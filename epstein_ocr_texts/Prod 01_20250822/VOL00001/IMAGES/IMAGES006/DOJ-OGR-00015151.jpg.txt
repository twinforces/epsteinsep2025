Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 809 _ Filed 08/11/25 Page19 of 31
They do not reveal new venues at which their crimes occurred. They do not reveal new sources
of their wealth. They do not explore the circumstances of Epstein’s death. They do not reveal
the path of the Government’s investigation.

Insofar as the motion to unseal implies that the grand jury materials are an untapped mine
lode of undisclosed information about Epstein or Maxwell or confederates, they definitively are
not that. A “public official,” “lawmaker,” “pundit,” or “ordinary citizen” “deeply interested and
concerned about the Epstein matter,” Motion to Unseal at 3, and who reviewed these materials
expecting, based on the Government’s representations, to learn new information about Epstein’s
and Maxwell’s crimes and the investigation into them, would come away feeling disappointed
and misled. There is no “there” there.

This case is thus a far cry from every reported case applying the Second Circuit’s
“special circumstances” doctrine. In each such case, the petition to unseal, whether granted or
denied, sought unique, undisclosed information. That information generally consisted of
firsthand testimony from a public figure or a witness to an important event. See, e.g., In re
Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 490-91 (granting petition to unseal grand jury testimony of New York City
mayoral candidate Mario Biaggi); /n re Craig, 131 F.3d at 101 (denying petition to unseal 1948
grand jury testimony of Harry Dexter White, an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury accused of
being a Communist spy); /n re Petition of Nat’l Sec. Archive, 104 F. Supp. 3d 625, 626, 629
(S.D.N.Y. 2015) (“In re National Security Archive”) (granting petition to unseal 1950 grand jury
records leading to the indictment of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg for conspiracy to commit
espionage); In re Petition of Am. Hist. Ass’n for Order Directing Release of Grand Jury Minutes,
49 F. Supp. 274, 278, 297-98 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (“dn re AHA”’’) (granting in part and denying in
part petition to unseal transcripts of 1947—1950 grand jury testimony regarding alleged espionage
