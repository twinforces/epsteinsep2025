1 have a financial stake -â€”-

2 THE COURT: That's what you argue to the jury.

3 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, one other thing. If she

4 did, in fact, give a statement to law enforcement in May of

5 2019, it hasn't been disclosed to us.

6 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. My understanding, I was at
7 that very first meeting. I can double-check my notes, which we
8 produced to the defense, it is September 2019.

9 THE COURT: Do you want to refresh her recollection on
10 the date or you don't have any notes from May 2099?

11 MS. MOE: I do not.

12 THE COURT: You're certainly welcome to inquire.

13 MS. MENNINGER: Certainly, your Honor. On her dates.
14 MS. MOE: I'm sorry. My colleague is -- again, I

15 don't remember this off the top of my head, but --

16 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I believe what is possibly

17 happening in the witness's answer about May 2019 is that I

18 believe before the September 2019 interview, FBI agents

19 approached this witness and asked her if she was willing to be
20 interviewed. She declined. And I believe that may have
21 happened around May of 2019. So she may be confusing that as
22 the first time she ever spoke with the FBI. But she was not
23 substantively interviewed and did not give substantive
24 statements until September of 2019.
25 THE COURT: All right. Not sealed.
