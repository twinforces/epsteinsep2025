LCKVMAX2 Summations â€”- Ms. Moe

1 that stand, when they talked about their memories of her,

2 ladies and gentlemen, they were describing the same woman. Not
3 just her name and her physical appearance, but what she was

4 like. These girls knew her. They knew Maxwell. Charming,

5 sophisticated, engaging, impressive. A woman who moved in a

6 social circle that was intimidating. These witnesses were

7 describing the same woman, Ghislaine Maxwell. They knew her.

8 The relationships that Maxwell cultivated with these

9 girls were essential to the scheme. Those relationships helped
10 Maxwell and Epstein maintain control of these girls for years.
11 Jane didn't become Epstein's so-called goddaughter by accident.
12 Maxwell helped establish a close relationship that became a

13 cover for sexual abuse.

14 The patterns you saw throughout this trial, the

15 playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many

16 ways that you know that Maxwell is guilty.

17 I want to talk to you now about what Maxwell and

18 Epstein did to Jane. That's the third way that you know that
19 Maxwell is guilty.
20 This is Jane. Jane turned 14 years old in the summer
21 of 1994, when she met Maxwell at a summer camp for kids.
22 Maxwell and Epstein told her that Epstein was a wealthy donor
23 who gave scholarships. But you learned that meeting Maxwell
24 and Epstein at summer camp was the beginning of years of sexual
25 abuse. What Jane told you about meeting Maxwell in summer camp
