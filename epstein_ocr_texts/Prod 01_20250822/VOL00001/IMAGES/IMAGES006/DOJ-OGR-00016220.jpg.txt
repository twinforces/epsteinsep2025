1 issues. And that's how I understood this was being addressed.
2 THE COURT: Well, you want all of 52 as an exhibit for
3 the appellate record, but you don't want the jury to get all of
4 52?

S MR. PAGLIUCA: I think there are a couple of problems.
6 Certainly, we didn't cross examine on the entirety of 52,

7 because I understood that 52, in its entirety, was not being

8 admitted. So I think that's problem number 1.

9 There are also problems, I think, simply with

10 relevance related to the rest of the exhibit, and there were

11 discrete portions that the government said the government was
12 contending were relevant and not the other portions. So the

13 book is however many pages it is, but I think it's outside of
14 what was appropriate for cross examination at the time.

15 THE COURT: My clerk is sending me the portion of the
16 transcript.

17 I can't tell if you're in disagreement yet or not,

18 Ms. Moe.

19 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. I think the issue is more
20 that because the weight and authenticity of this exhibit has
21 now been put in dispute, I don't know how the jurors would
22 evaluate the testimony about its contents, the format, in order
23 to evaluate its authenticity or weight without the object
24 itself. That's what we wanted to clarify about whether that
25 would be part of the record.
