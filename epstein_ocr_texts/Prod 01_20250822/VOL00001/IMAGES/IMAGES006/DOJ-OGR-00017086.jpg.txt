LCKVMAX4 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 MS. MOE: That's more than enough for venue on each

2 count.

3 So that's all that I'm going to say about the law.

4 We've proved to you that the defendant has committed all six

5 crimes charged in the indictment.

6 I want to switch gears and talk to you about one last
7 topic. I want to talk to you about the arguments the defense

8 has made to you at this trial. Now, before I get into this,

9 let me be clear that Maxwell has no burden to put on a defense
10 or to put on any witnesses or evidence on her behalf. The

11 government has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.
12 We embrace that burden and we've carried it. But in this case,
13 Maxwell chose to cross-examine witnesses, to make arguments,

14 and to call witnesses. You can -- and should -- scrutinize

15 that carefully.

16 In her opening statement, defense counsel said

17 something to you about Maxwell being blamed for something a man
18 did. Let me be very clear. The evidence at this trial showed
19 you that Ghislaine Maxwell made her own choices. She committed
20 crimes hand-in-hand with Jeffrey Epstein. She was a grown
al woman who knew exactly what she was doing. And now she's
22 Sitting here in this courtroom being held accountable for
23 breaking the law. That's what this trial is about. That's
24 what the evidence tells you.
25 And at the beginning of this trial, defense counsel
