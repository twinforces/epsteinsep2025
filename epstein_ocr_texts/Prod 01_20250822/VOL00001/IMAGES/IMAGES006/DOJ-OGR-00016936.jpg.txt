1 THE COURT: Mr. Rohrbach?

2 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, this is a place where the

12 find that that was a conspiracy that existed, and as part of

13 that grooming conduct, the plan would be to continue to abuse
14 her, including back in New York. These are available

15 inferences to the jury, and that's all that's required for the
16 conspiracy count.

25 able to go. So I don't think that is evidence -- if the object
