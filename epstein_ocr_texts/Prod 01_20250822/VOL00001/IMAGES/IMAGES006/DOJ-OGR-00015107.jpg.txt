2024). Thus, Ms. Fariier’s and 6ther'victims’ privacy interests as‘victims of Epstein and Maxwell
weigh heavily in favor of the'redactions' of the victims’ names and idéntifying information:

B.. Redactions of Names and Information Relating to Epstein and Maxwell’s Co-
Conspirators, Are Improper.

The: Government’s. original motion refers to a July 6, 2025 Memorandum. that concluded
that.no evidence could predicate an investigation. into uncharged. third parties. associated. with
Epstein’s.and Maxwell’s criminal scheme.. Epstein Dkt. No. 6]. at 1-2. The Government purports
to seck the unscaling ‘of the grand jury transcripts to provide transparency for the public into the
conclusions reached by the Memorandum. Jd. Tobe clear, we do not agree that there is:insufficient
evidence:to: support-investigations into third parties who enabled Epstein’s and Maxwell’s crimes
and participated:in. them. Numerous individuals have yet to be investigated and several civil cases
have: been filed addressing other individuals’ central involvement, with Epstein’s and.Maxwell’s
sex trafficking.

As the Court acknowledged, there are “over ore thousand, victims” of Epstein’s and
Maxwell’s crimes. Epstein Dkt.. 63 at 4. Less than one-fifth oft these. victinis have. been
compensated. for'the crimes committed against: them, either through. the now-closed Epstein
Victims Compensation Fund or otherwise. To rectify. this, there have been numerous civil cases
filed. that,address third parties’ central involvement with Epstein and Maxwell’s sex-trafficking
crimes. See .Doe J v: JP Morgan Chase Bank; N.A., Case: No. 22-ev-10019 (S-D.N.Y.), Doe I'v:
Deutsche Bank. Aktiengesellschaft, Case No. 22-cv-10018 (S.D.N.Y..); Doe’ 3 v. Jndyke, Case No.
24-cv-01204 (S:D.N.Y.); To the extent any of Epstein’s and. Maxwell’s enablers and co-
conspirators who have ‘thus far evaded accountability are implicated by the grand jury transcripts,
their identities:should not be shielded from the public. Though'“[t]he privacy interests of innocent
third parties” like the victims should be redacted, see Gardner v. Newsday, Inc., 895 F.2d 74, 79
(2d Cir. 1990), there should be:no similar protection for those third.parties accused of wrongdoing.

Ms. Farmer. strongly supports the.release of-Epstein’s and.Maxwell’s:grand jury transcripts,
subjectto appropriate-redactions of the victims’ names and identifying information. Unsealing the
grand jury transcripts serves the interests of transparency, accountability, and restorative justice.
