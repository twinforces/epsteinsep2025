THE COURT: Thank. you.,

I will héa@r the Statement from counsel for Virginia
Roberts.

VIRGINIA ROBERTS, COUNSEL: Good afternoon, your Honor.

May it please the Court, this statement I am reading
on, behalf of ‘my client, Virginia Givffre, is written to
Ghislaine’ Maxwell.

Ghislaine: 22 yedrs, ago in the Summer of 2000, you
spotted. me at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, and you made a choice:

You chose. to follé6w mé and procure me for Epstein. Judt. hours

later, you, and he abused me together for the first time.
Together you datiaged me physically, mentally, sexually and
emotionally. Together you did unthinkable things that still
have a corrosive impact on mé to this day.

I want to be clean about one ‘thing: Without. question,

Jeffrey Epstein was a terrible pedophile, but I néver would

have met. Jeffrey Epstein if not fon you. For me, and for so
many Others, you d6pened the dé6or to hell, and then, Ghislainé,
like a wolf in, sheep's clothing, you used ‘your femininity to
betray us ahd you led us all through it. When you did that,

you changed, the course of our Lives forever. You joked that

you were like a néw méther to us. As a woman, I think you

understood the damage that you. were Causing, the price you were

making us victims pay. You could have put an end to the rapes,
