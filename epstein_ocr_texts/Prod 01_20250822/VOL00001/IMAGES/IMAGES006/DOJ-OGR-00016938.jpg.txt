1 THE COURT: Okay.

2 MR. EVERDELL: We would add, the last sentence, "Count
3 Two relates solely to Jane and the time period 1994 to 1997."

4 THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Rohrbach?

a) MR. ROHRBACH: I think that's redundant, but the

6 government is fine with that.

7 THE COURT: Okay. Page 15, line 13, adding "solely"

8 between "Count Two" and "relates." No, I'm sorry. Between

9 "relates" and the word "to." So the sentence will read, "Count
10 Two relates solely to Jane."

11 Next.

12 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor. Same page, line 15.
13 This is on Count Three.

14 T'll just go back to line 14. Count "Three of the

15 indictment charges the defendant with conspiring with others to
16 transport an individual," and we would add "under the age of

17 18," "in interstate commerce," because we've eliminated "and

18 foreign."

19 THE COURT: Mr. Rohrbach.
20 MR. ROHRBACH: I believe that the elements that the
al Court has set forth for that count is an individual under the
22 age of 17.
23 MR. EVERDELL: I'm sorry.
24 MR. ROHRBACH: Is that -â€”-
25 THE COURT: We've adopted the Sand suggestion.
