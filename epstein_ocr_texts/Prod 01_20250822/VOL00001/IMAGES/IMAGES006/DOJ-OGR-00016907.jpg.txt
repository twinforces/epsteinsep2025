That's the exact question, --

THE COURT: What was. the response?

MS. MENNINGER: You askéd mé ‘that quéstsion three
times. JI believe it is around then, but I don't know exactly
when.

And the ‘position of Jane was that he was Living there

in 1994; SO I think undér 401, it is a question 6f whether

that's relevant, It 1s certainly different than the
testimony ==

THE COURT: The fact ‘that it. was asked, three ‘times is
the argumént that it == Cdéntrary to my immediately prior
ruling, that there was a motive to develop it?

MS. MENNINGER: There waS motive to develop it, your
Honer. That was the whole point of this litigation. I mean, I
can offer the complaint as well, but it's in the sufimary
judgment, ruling.

THE GOURT: Okay:

For the same reason, it*s sustained.
