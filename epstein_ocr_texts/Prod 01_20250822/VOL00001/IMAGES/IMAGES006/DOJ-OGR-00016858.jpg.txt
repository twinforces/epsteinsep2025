1 this, your Honor, as being lacking in foundation and hearsay.

2 THE COURT: Sustained.

3 Q. From your conversations with Ghislaine Maxwell between 1994

6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, this is beyond the scope of

7 my direct examination, so I object to this as well.

8 THE COURT: Sustained.

9 Q. On direct examination, you were asked some questions about
10 your memories of meeting people. Do you remember being asked
11 those questions?

12 A. When were the questions?
13 Q. My question is do you remember Mr. Pagliuca asking you some
14 questions about whether you remembered meeting certain people?
15 A. On the flights?
16 QO. Yes,
17 A. Yes, I do.
18 Q. So I want to ask you a few questions about your memory.
19 Dr. Dubin, without getting into any personal medical
20 details, are you having some issues with your memory?
21 A. Yes, I do.
22 Q. Again, without getting into details because I don't want to
23 invade your privacy, can you just explain for the jury what you
24 mean by that?
25 A. It's very hard for me to remember anything far back. And
