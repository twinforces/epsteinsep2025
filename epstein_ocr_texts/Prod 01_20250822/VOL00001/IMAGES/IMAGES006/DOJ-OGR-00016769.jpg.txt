LEHVMAX 2:
I do intend to go throvgh with this witness whether
they followed up on certain things that they heard .in the
interviews, like, for example -- I'll give an example.
We heard from Jane testimony -- she confirmed. ‘on the

stand ‘that She told the government that shé was involved in

sexualized massages with multiple people, and she named. the

first names of several of 'those people. I believe we know from

what she was saying tq the government who those people are,
it's the subject of some of these submissions, we madé ‘to the
Court about other witnesises that we want to call.

My understanding is from looking at the records that.
were ‘provided to us, they didn't follow up and talk to some of
these witnessés, right. So, for example, one of the names
ment:ioned was Michelle. We think we know who that Michelle ‘is.

That Michelle was evident to the government because there was a

Michelle -- at. least. one Michelle. One Michelle was
communicated to the gévernment by ahother witness that worked

in, the office. They never spoke to that Michelle. Same thing

with some, of the 6ther pedple that were mentidned; hever spoke
to. them.

And I think that. uhder your Hohor's ruling, even
though that, I guess, 1S an investigative step, and, I'm Looking
at your H6nor's ruling how, you were talking about the Watson
Gase, and you said that some arguments about the thoroughness.
of the investigation are probative of guilt in. some
