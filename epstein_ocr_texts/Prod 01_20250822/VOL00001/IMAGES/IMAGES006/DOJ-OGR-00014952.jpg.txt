certainly I've -- it*s something that happens...

THE COURT: Does it surprise you, thén, there's no
discussion in the literature of that specific phenomenon?

discussed in the literature. But I think that, the example

you'ré asking mé dbout is sd highly specific, I think it would

fall under the category of a number of ‘things that, are
discussed, but I'm not aware of it having been discussed, that
specifically.
