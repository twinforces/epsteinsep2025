1 Q. I wanted to direct your attention to the use of the term

2 grooming, so in that top paragraph. If you could review the

3 section of the article that starts with "If their use of the

4 term grooming" and all the way to the end of that paragraph and
5 let me know when you have had a chance to review it, please.

6 A. Okay.

7 Q. Dr. Rocchio, what is your response, reaction to this

8 passage?

9 A. It's a bit confusing as to the point that's being made. I
10 feel like they're trying to -- the author here seems to be

11 mixing different applications of the term that they use

12 grooming, so it looks like in part he's talking about what is
13 true in the literature, which is that we're not particularly

14 good as a field of taking, frankly, many behaviors at all and
15 predicting future behaviors. So he's saying accurately that we
16 can't look at specific behaviors alone as predictors.

17 And certainly, the use of the term grooming, again, is
18 used to describe a process, a pattern of behaviors. I'm not

19 here today to say that if somebody engages in any one of these
20 particular behaviors, yes, we know you're a child abuser. So
21 he's making that point. But I don't think anybody -- I don't
ae think that -- if that's his point, I wouldn't disagree with
23 that. Except that he's then going on -- I disagree where he
24 says that grooming then can't involve behaviors that might in
25 fact be prosocial or normal.
