1 investigation, but I specifically precluded direct evidence of
2 failure of investigative techniques.

3 MR. EVERDELL: I'm not saying an investigative

4 technique per se, your Honor. I'm simply pointing out that

5 evidence that a jury might expect to see, given we are in the

6 modern era, is not present in front of them because of the age
7 of the allegations. So I think this point through the agent

8 clarifies the fact that these records don't exist anymore, they
9 tried to get them, I think, and they didn't exist. It's not a
10 particular technique, it's just highlighting the fact that, in
11 a case of this age, there are records that have disappeared,

12 phone records get deleted after a while, there is no such thing
13 as geo location information, there weren't cellphones that had
14 these things.

15 So pointing it out to the agent is simply pointing out
16 the absence of evidence because there wouldn't be anything in
17 the record to argue that to the jury if I'm not allowed to put
18 that in front of -- through this agent. I mean, there needs to
19 be some explanation of the fact that I think this agent could
20 provide that these people didn't have cellphones to their
21 knowledge, so they wouldn't have had geo location information
22 and that's why we don't have it in this case.
23 MR. ROHRBACH: I'm a little confused why the defense
24 wants to put this in, your Honor. We've had testimony in this
25 case from a custodian and others about what recordkeeping
