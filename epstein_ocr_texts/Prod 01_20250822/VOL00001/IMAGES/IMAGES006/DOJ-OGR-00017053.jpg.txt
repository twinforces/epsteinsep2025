LCKVMAX2 Summations â€”- Ms. Moe

1 You can consider all of the witnesses' testimony as

2 corroborating testimony as you consider what happened to each

3 one of them.

4 Let me just say one last thing about Jane. Defense

5 counsel asked Jane in cross-examination whether she remembered
6 some of the first names of people who were present for group

7 sexualized encounters. She remembered five names: Emmy,

8 Kelly, Sophie, Eva, and Michelle. And keep in mind, she was a
9 kid, right; it's not like she's taking people's IDs in the room
10 when she's being sexually assaulted, but that's what she can
11 remember.
12 The defense seized on two of those names, Eva and
13 Michelle. Here's the transcript where they asked about this on
14 CELOSS.
