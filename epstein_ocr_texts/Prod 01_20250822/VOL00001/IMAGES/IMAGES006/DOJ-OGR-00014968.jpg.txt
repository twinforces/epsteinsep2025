1 about disclosure to formal agencies, you can then compare that

2 with uniform crime reports and look at the statistics for what

3 rate, what percentage, what is the prevalence of these

4 particular crimes being reported to -- through, through the

5 legal system.

6 Also, when you're doing the interviews, you can look

7 at asking individuals: and did you disclose, and if so, to

8 whom.

9 So there are lots of different studies that can look
10 at disclosure. There's also research that's been done Looking
11 at, again, how people tell and, you know, closer in time, not
12 just with adults looking back retrospectively, but times when
13 there's been -- someone has been known to have been abused, and
14 there have been studies that have been done looking at, do they
15 tell or not. I referred earlier to the study of very young
16 children who had presented with sexually transmitted diseases,
17 for example, who were later asked about their experiences, and
18 you can look at, in real time, studies of what they say and to
19 whom.

20 THE COURT: Ms. Pomerantz, let's move to the next
21 opinion.
22 BY MS. POMERANTZ:

24 risks for victims?
