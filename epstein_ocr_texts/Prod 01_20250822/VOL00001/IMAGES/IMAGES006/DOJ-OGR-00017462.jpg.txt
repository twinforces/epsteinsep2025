LBUCmax3 Visoski - cross
1 don't open them yet.
2 I would just, with the Court's permission, instruct,
3 especially the jurors who are here on the right side of the
4 jury box, as you look at the photos, because they are under
5 seal, please do it in such a way that you do not display what
6 you're looking at to the members of the gallery. So keep that
7 manilla folder upright so no one could see, if you would.
8 Is that right all right, your Honor?
9 THE COURT: Yes.
10 MR. EVERDELL: Is it okay with the government?
11 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.
12 MR. EVERDELL: If you would open the folders and
13 please look at what's been marked as LV3A and LV3B. When
14 you've had a chance to look, you can return the folders under
15 your chair. And you can take that down.
16 BY MR. EVERDELL:
17 Q. Now, Mr. Visoski, you spoke to this person in the photos on
18 a number of occasions; is that right?
19 A. That's correct.
20 Q. In fact, you've spoke to her frequently enough that you
al even had her phone number in your cellphone; right?
22 A. That's correct.
23 Q. And she traveled frequently with Mr. Epstein on his planes;
24 isn't that right?
25 A. Yes.
