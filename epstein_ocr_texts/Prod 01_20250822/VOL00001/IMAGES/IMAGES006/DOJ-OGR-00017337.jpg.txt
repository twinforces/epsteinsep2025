1 can be relevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage
2 in sexual activity under the age of 17, I think. I think this
3 is the same basic discussion that we've had. So, in addition

4 to my reasoning yesterday, I think the proposal made by the

5 defense is wrong.

6 I continue to not know how to parse the jury's

7 question exactly, other than to know that they are asking about
8 Count Four, the defense's original suggestion to just point to
9 the motivating factor I rejected language or to say no. To say
10 no, I think, was the wrong course, because I don't understand
11 the question well enough to be able to say no.
12 Pointing to just the motivating factor language I
13 think was unhelpful because, really, the point is to remind
14 them of the whole instruction, including that it's a violation
15 of New York penal law that's charged and is the illegal sexual
16 activity that they're considering.
17 So, for those reasons, I am in the same place.
18 I did want to make a little bit of an additional
19 record regarding my extending the deliberations by an hour, the
20 instructions that I gave yesterday regarding that slightly
al extended schedule.
22 I asked the jury to make themselves available to
23 deliberate until at least 6:00 today, which is a one-hour
24 extension of what's largely been our schedule. Although, it
25 was until 6 o'clock, I think, on the first night of
