1 aren't making this up is that multiple other witnesses backed
2 up what they told you. Think about all of the other witnesses
3 in this case. Juan Alessi, David Mulligan, Janice Swain, and
4 the witnesses called Matt and Shawn. Think about all the ways
5 their testimony was backed up by documents, all of the other

6 evidence in the case.

7 Your common sense tells you the witnesses are not

8 lying and they just cannot be all misremembering the same

9 thing. That just leaves one conclusion: That Maxwell is

10 guilty and you should convict her.

11 Let me take a step back and say this: Ladies and

12 gentlemen, look at the evidence together, all of the evidence,
13 and use your common sense. The evidence points to only one

14 conclusion: That Ghislaine Maxwell sexually exploited young
15 girls. She trafficked underage girls for sex. When you

16 consider all of the evidence and use your common sense, you

17 will reach the only verdict consistent with the evidence:

18 Maxwell is guilty.

19 THE COURT: All right. Thank you, Ms. Moe.
20 Members of the jury, we are going to take that break
21 for lunch. It will be a short break, 20 to 30 minutes.
22 Ms. Williams is having it set up now. My law clerks are going
23 to assist you getting back.
24 I just want to pause one moment. I repeat this, even
25 though we're at the later stages of the case. No discussions
