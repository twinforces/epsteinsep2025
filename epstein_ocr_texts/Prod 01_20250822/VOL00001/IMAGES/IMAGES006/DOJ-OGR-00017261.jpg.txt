Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 240 of 257 3074
LCKCmax9 Charge

1 shows on different occasions Ms. Maxwell engaged in conduct

2 Similar to the charges in the indictment. It is for you to

3 decide whether Ms. Maxwell engaged in the other conduct.

4 Let me remind you that Ms. Maxwell is on trial only

5 for committing acts alleged in the indictment. Accordingly,

6 you may consider this evidence of similar acts as a

7 substitute -- you may not consider this evidence -- let me

8 start that sentence again. Accordingly, you may not consider
9 this evidence of similar acts as a substitute for proof that
10 Ms. Maxwell committed the crimes charged nor may you consider
11 this evidence as proof that Ms. Maxwell has a criminal

12 personality or bad character. The evidence of the other

13 similar acts was admitted for a much more limited purpose and
14 you may consider it only for that limited purpose.

15 If you determine that Ms. Maxwell committed the acts
16 charged in the indictment and the similar acts, as well, then
17 you may, but you need not draw an inference that in doing the
18 acts charged in the indictment, that Ms. Maxwell acted

19 knowingly and intentionally and not because of some mistake,
20 accident, or other innocent reasons. You may also consider
al this evidence in determining whether Ms. Maxwell utilized a
22 scheme or common plan in committing both the crimes charged in
23 the indictment and the similar acts introduced by the
24 government.
25 Evidence of similar acts may not be considered by you
