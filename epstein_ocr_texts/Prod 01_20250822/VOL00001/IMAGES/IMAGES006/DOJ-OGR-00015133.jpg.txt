UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
20 Cr. 330 (PAE)
~ OPINION & ORDER
GHISLAINE MAXWELL,
Defendant.
PAUL A. ENGELMAYER, District Judge:

On December 29, 2021, a jury convicted defendant Ghislaine Maxwell of five felonies
involving the sexual abuse of young girls that she and the notorious pedophile Jeffrey Epstein
committed between 1994 and 2004. This decision resolves the Government’s July 18, 2025
motion to unseal grand jury transcripts and exhibits in Maxwell’s case, subject to redactions
aimed at protecting victim confidentiality. Dkt. 785; see also Dkt. 808. For the reasons that
follow, the Court denies the motion.!

I. Background to the Motion to Unseal

A. Indictments

In late November 2018, prompted by investigative journalism, the United States Attorney
in this District opened an investigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators. On July 2, 2019, a
grand jury returned an indictment that charged Epstein with participating in a sex trafficking
conspiracy, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) and (b).? On July 6, 2019, Epstein was arrested.
' A motion seeking, on similar terms, the unsealing of grand jury materials in Epstein’s case is
pending before the Hon. Richard M. Berman. See United States v. Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB)
(S.D.N.Y. July 18, 2025), Dkt. 61.
