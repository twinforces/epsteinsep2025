13 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, at this time, the defense
14 moves to admit CE3 through CE8, temporarily under seal so we

16 interests of witnesses.

17 MS. POMERANTZ: No objection, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: CE3 through 8 are admitted temporarily
19 under seal for the purpose of protecting the anonymity of a
