LEAVMAX2 A. Earmer - direct

dréam dress;

One night we’ went to the movies with Jeffrey Epstein.
Tt was -- it! was a little weird; one of those ‘things that is
hard to explain. We were sitting next to each other, and he
put otit his hand for 'mé to hold, ard we were holding hands.
Not weird. Normal, Fine, Then he kind of caressed, rubbed my
arm, and shoe, foot. Tt was one of those things that just gave
me a weird feeling, but wasn't that weird and probably normal.

The ore thing that kind of weirded me out about it was
he let go of my hand when the was talking to Maria. Oh, well, I
decided it was no big deal. It just made me mad because He's
being so amazing, paying for a, summer program for me and
helping mé with céllege. He's So nice and so generous with
everyone. I just didn,'t. want ‘to have any weird, feelings about
it. I didn't/couldh't say anything t6 Maria about it because

she worships him and zt would just create problems. I couldn't

tell anyone 6lsé because it is not a big deal and I didn't want
to portray him in a bad laght. I, meally don't think it is a
big deal. I think he is just a relaxed guy and likes to flirt
er was being fatherly or something. I know this sounds like me
trying to justify him doing soémething weird, but it isn't.
Continue meading?
QO. Lét mé just pause you right there.
Can you explain how you were feeling about Epstein at
the time you were writing about him. in. your journal.
