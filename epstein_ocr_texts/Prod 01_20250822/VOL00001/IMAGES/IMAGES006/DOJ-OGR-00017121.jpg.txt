Tnterlochen on the flight logs. And you Should, take a look at

those, because Epstein. went every year, pretty much, including
with Itzhak Pérlman, a famous, mUsicidh, himself. And not only
did. Epstein and Maxwell go to Interlochen in '94, they also
went in *96. And acttdlly, they both went in 1996. And sé,
while they claim the flight log from '94 establishes that Jane
met Epstein and Maxwell iin, "94, ‘in fact, it's just as, possible
that she met them in '96. And if she met. them in '96, .it

certainly makes a lot more sénse given, the rest of the

evidence, which. we'll talk. about now.

Because the next. thing that Happened is there is a
flight. in November of 1996 which the government showed you, and,
I'll show you again in a minute, that. has. Jané going 6n a
flight. from Palm, Beach, when she's 16, to New York. That's the
very first, timé sdémeoneé with Jane's first namé flies 6n a
flight, when she's 16, while she came and told you, all that she
was flying repéatedly when she was 14 ahd 15, but there is ho
records, miraculously, of those flights.

In Mareh of 1997, Jane and hér méther, when she's 16,

file a Jawsuit against her voice teacher, her principal, and
her guidance counselor. That lawsuit went on for two years.

Jane said she remembered her teacher pulling her hair one ‘time,

but she had no idéa that Her mother and shé had sued Hér 6wh
principal, guidance counselor, and voice teacher. Is that
credible; that. a 16-year-old doesn't know she's in litigation
