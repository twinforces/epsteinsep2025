1 THE COURT: It does not happen that anyone invokes in
2 front of the jury. All we would be doing is, outside the

3 presence of the jury, they come, guestions asked, invoke, and

4 then they go home. We could do that if that's what the parties
5 want to do — that seems like an enormous waste of time — or

6 counsel can make an application as to how to proceed after

7 consulting with counsel for the witness. I mean, it's your

8 witness. If you want to send the marshals, despite -- or make
9 an application to send the marshals despite the witness's

10 counsel indicating to you that they want to invoke the Fifth,
11 then I suppose you can do that, but --

12 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I didn't ask for that with
13 respect to that witness. I asked for it for one who refused to
14 communicate with us. I will make a formal application. I

15 understand, your Honor.

16 THE COURT: Okay.

17 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, we're happy to confer with the
18 defense on this issue to the extent the defense wants to make a
19 record that this witness would have invoked, we're happy to
20 confer to the extent it would be helpful about how to make that
2l record.
22 THE COURT: That's precisely why I raised it last
23 night and asked if there was an application, but here we are.
24 But again, we're not delaying trial, so this all needs to
25 happen yesterday.
