1 THE COURT: Or there would be foundation issues,

2 which, if probed into, essentially would be violative of my

3 order to the extent that you're making arguments -- to the

4 extent that foundational inferences are essentially asking the
5 agent what she did or didn't do, which is precisely a violation
6 of my order.

7 And the whole point of the -- I mean, the whole point
8 of not allowing the defense to put on a case about what the

9 government did or didn't do and the motivations and the like is
10 because that's the question for the jury. The question for the
11 jury is, does the evidence that the government put on, that

12 they deemed credible, prove beyond a reasonable doubt or not

13 the charges. That is the core basis of my in limine holding.
14 MR. EVERDELL: I'm not trying to violate this, which
15 is why we're discussing this, your Honor. I just thought there
16 was some room to be able to elicit evidence about the absence
17 of evidence rather than just argument to the jury, and that's
18 what I was intending to do with this witness. If the Court

19 thinks what I've just proposed, that's generally the tenor of
20 the questions on that point are, violative of the order, I
21 might have to think it out and not be able to go into it
22 because of what you're saying, but I hear what you're saying.
23 THE COURT: Yeah, I mean, take it -- imagine it's a
24 modern case, right, and you ask why didn't you get geo location
25 evidence, it's asking what the government did or didn't do.
