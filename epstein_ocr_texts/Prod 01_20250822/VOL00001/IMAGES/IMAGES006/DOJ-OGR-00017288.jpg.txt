1 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

2 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I just wanted to add, I know

3 that the Court typically does close the day before Christmas.

4 But because this year Christmas is on a Saturday, I think

S that's why Thursday is the other day that's off.

6 THE COURT: The courthouse is closed on Christmas Eve,
7 of course, and Christmas. But the 23rd it's not.

8 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, would you be inclined to offer
9 that to them today, in case they need to make arrangements, if
10 that's an option for them?

11 THE COURT: I'll hear from the parties.

12 I think I could say if deliberations are ongoing or if
13 they haven't completed their deliberations, the Court can

14 arrange for them to deliberate on Thursday, the 23rd, if they
15 wish to.

16 MS. COMEY: That's fine, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: Do the parties have a view as to doing

18 that today or tomorrow, I guess, for the arrangement point?

19 MS. STERNHEIM: I would suggest that we do it today in
20 case they do want to have that option and need to make
21 childcare or other arrangements.
22 THE COURT: So I think what I said was if the jury has
23 not completed its deliberations, it is possible for them to
24 deliberate this week on Thursday, December 23rd, if they wish.
25 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.
