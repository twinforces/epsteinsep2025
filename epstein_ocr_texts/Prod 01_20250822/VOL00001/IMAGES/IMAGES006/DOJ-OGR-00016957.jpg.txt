1 MR. ROHRBACH: I've only read portions of it too, but

9 proposed instruction would be suggestive of error because the
10 point is that -- or at least creates the very confusion that

11 arose in Miller about whether it has to be one of the dominant
12 purposes. The use of the word "dominant" is a source of

13 confusion, as Sand has explained.

18 did not come from case law. That is Sand's proposal to deal

19 with the issue of the dominant purpose versus one dominant
20 purpose. There is, however, case law in many circuits where
21 the instruction "one dominant purpose" is accepted instruction,
22 and the Miller case endorses that instruction because that was

24 perfectly proper to give that charge. So I actually think
25 there is more support in the case law for the "one dominant
