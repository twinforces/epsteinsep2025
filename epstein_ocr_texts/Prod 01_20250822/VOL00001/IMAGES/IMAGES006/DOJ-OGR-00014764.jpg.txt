1 MR. EVERDELL: That's correct, your Honor.

2 THE COURT: So I did reject the request for redactions
3 for the reasons explained in my order. And as I explained in

4 overruling the objection to paragraphs 39 to 45, Kate's

5) testimony and her statement are relevant to sentencing which

6 I've indicated she may give. And with that, there's objections
7 pertaining to fine and assets and the like. I think we can

8 turn to those when we get to the fine. Mr. Everdell, okay with
9 that?

10 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor. So we'll delay the

11 offense level calculation objections and the ones related to

12 the financial penalties for now?

13 THE COURT: Yes, precisely, and we'll pick those up.
14 I think otherwise that's it for what I understand to be

15 continuing objections after probation responded to your

16 requests and assertions. Agree with that, Mr. Everdell?

17 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, the only one that I would
18 highlight is there was an objection, I believe it's framed

19 according to paragraph 173, which deals with the financial
20 penalties. The government made in their response some
21 representations that we take issue with, but if you're planning
22 on covering that later, we can reserve that till later because
23 it does deal with the financial penalties.
24 THE COURT: Yes, I have objections to 172, 178, 192
25 and 193.
