1 inconsistent and unreliable. I overrule this objection.

2 Carolyn testified at trial that Virginia first brought her to

3 Epstein's residence when she was 14 years old. I found Carolyn
4 to be credible and credit her testimony. I'm not persuaded by
S the arguments to the contrary. Moreover, @Sean's credible

6 testimony corroborated Carolyn's recollection.

7 Paragraph 59, the defendant makes two objections.

8 Same objection to Carolyn being 14. For the reasons I've

9 stated, that's overruled. She objects to Carolyn's assertion
10 that she visited Epstein's residence more than a hundred times.
11 I overrule that objection. Again, I credit Carolyn's

12 testimony. She testified that she went to the house "over 100
13 times." I reject the suggestion that this is improbable based
14 on Epstein's travel schedule.

15 Paragraphs 61 and 62 again object to Carolyn's age,

16 and I overrule for the same reasons.

17 Paragraph 64, three objections. First, the defendant
18 objects to Carolyn's assertion that she visited the Palm Beach
19 residence over a hundred times and her assertion that she was
20 14. For the reasons I've given, I overrule those objections.
2l She objects to the assertion that Carolyn stopped performing
22 sexualized massages in 2001 when she was 18 years old and
23 argues that the evidence indicates she was 17 years old. We're
24 going to take up the issue of this timing question with respect
25 to the issue of which Guidelines Manual controls. So I'll skip
