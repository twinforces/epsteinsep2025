1 people as sexually abused and others not. So you have to look
2 for other ways to assess acceptability within the scientific

3 literature; peer review and general thoughts about concepts.

4 And so that's where you look at the reliability as in what do
5 the experts consistently agree to among themselves. You look
6 at the degree of overlapping studies, perhaps studying it in

7 different ways, but are they still coming up with the same

8 clear description of the types of things that happen in the

9 context of child sexual abuse.

10 So for example, there was a content analysis done

11 through interviews to pull out what some of those studies have
12 found and to the degree that they're rated by multiple

13 reviewers, and then compare the ratings of those reviewers,

14 that's an indices of reliability.

15 MS. POMERANTZ: I think we're done with Government

16 Exhibit 4.

17 Can we pull up Government Exhibit 5, please.

18 Q. Dr. Rocchio, do you recognize this?

19 A. I do.
20 Q. What is it?
21 A. It's an article describing the evolution of the word
22 grooming and how it's been used, as well as the term seduction,
23 to describe this commonly understood pattern of behavior and
24 the strategies used by child perpetrators in the service of
25 sexual exploitation and abuse.
