LEHCmax5

Ms. Maxwell lived at the Kinnérton, residence at a particular
time.

MR. EVERDELL: That's right. She testified that ‘the
events that she testified to in the U.K., the events of sexual
conduct -- contact with Jeffrey Epstein took place in ‘the
Kinnerton Street address. She even identified the pheto of the
housé with the red door across from the Nags Head Pub, which is
the 44 Kinnerton Street --

THE COURT: Tt was an interesting moment during the
cross. that focused ‘on the pub across the street, I remember
thinking, huh, I wonder if they have a witness from tHe pub

across the street. I actually did. You know what, you were
thinking thé same thing; too.

MR. EVERDELL: Well, ino, ‘your Honor. What we were

thinking is wé wanted to make sure, because that witness had

said on different occasions to the government ‘that the events
took place in the apartment across from the Nags Head Pub, that
was one time, but she also said, it happened, at a Kensington
address, which, by thé way, is not Belgravia, it's Somewhere

else in London. It's mearby, but it's next door, it's several

subway tubé stops away. So we weren't sure she was going to
say it was the Kensington address or it was the Belgravia
address at Kinnérton Street. She committed té the Belgravia.
THE COURT: What, ddte was that?
MR. EVERDELL: What date was what?
