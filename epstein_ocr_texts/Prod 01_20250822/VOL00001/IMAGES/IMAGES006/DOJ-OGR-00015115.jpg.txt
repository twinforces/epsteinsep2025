Re: United States of America vs. Maxwell, 1:20-cr-00330-PAE

United States of America vs. Epstein, 1:19-cr-00490-RMB

Dear Hon. Judge Engelmayer and Hon. Judge Berman:

I have been taken aback from all the monumental and more recently disheartening things
that have taken place between the time Epstein was arrested, the trial that occurred verse
Maxwell with Hon. Judge Alison Nathan and now with the letter I write to you today.

This is all very exhausting. As a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell and the
co-conspirators who were never indicted, you can try to imagine the bewilderment I feel from the
the latest happenings. Also, the news that came out today in regards to potentially releasing audio
of the interview between Maxwell and Todd Blanche and the various subpoenas.

I think the more concerning thing to me are the subpoena’s. Why not subpoena the United States
Virgin Island’s officials that were working with Epstein to allow him to further his sex-
trafficking of girls across inter-continental and international lines? “Jeffrey Epstein used the
money Black paid him to partially fund his operations in the Virgin Islands.” [https://

renews-demand-for-trump-administration-to-produce-epstein-files]
Why not subpoena the long-time attorney and accountant Epstein had working by his side? Once .
again, I just feel like the direction this administration is going is all wrong. AND, what was it
that his accountant took from his 71st Street NY mansion the day after he “killed himself’?

In terms of the audio file that will most likely be redacted once again scrubbing the names of the
wealthy and such off the recordings is once again NOT transparency. Unfortunately, the public
will never be satisfied and the victims will continue to live this nightmare. I am so confused.
Why rewind and go back to the convicted sex trafficker for questioning after all these almost 4
