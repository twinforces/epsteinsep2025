counsel for the Government reviewed the Maxwell grand jury transcripts and whether the
Government provided notice to the victims of the motion to unseal.” (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3;
Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 3).

Epstein and Maxwell grand jury transcripts. In addition, the Government has now provided notice

and Maxwell grand jury transcripts; and (4) a description of any other Epstein and Maxwell grand
jury materials, including, but not limited to, exhibits. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at
