Conviction. ‘Visoski testified ‘that Maxwell partially owned, the
jet, and both pilots testified that she would tell them when to
fly Epstein or Schedule flights for herself. The evidence at

trial demonstrates that Epstein and the defendant had the

pilots ‘fly victims of ‘the conspiracy. Across, ‘the 'timefrdme of
all counts ‘of conviction, Alessi, Visoski and Rodgers provided

defendant's offenses and were not fungible services generally

available 'to the public. Again, I'm citing from the
Carrozzelia case, 105 F.3d at 804.

In addition to these unknowing participants that.

testified at trial, 1, find by a preponderance of the evidence

tHat theré were other unknowing persons 16d by Maxwell. As
Epstein's mumber one, Ms. Maxwell. managed Epstein's numerous
households and interviewed, hired and ovérsaw the household
staff. The defendant bad her own personal assistants, Jike

Sarah Kellen dnd another individual. From the rééord, I éan't

determine the precise number of these other individuals that.
unknowingly assisted Epstein and the defendant in théir
criminal activity, but I find an adequate basis in, the record
that the numbér is sufficient to make the activity extensive
within, the meaning of 3B1,.1(a) from 1994 to 2004. See United
States vs Archer, 671 F.3d 149 (2d Cir. 2011).

Last, the defendant objects to enhancement
