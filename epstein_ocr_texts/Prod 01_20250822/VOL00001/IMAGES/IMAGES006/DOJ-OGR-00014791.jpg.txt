1 conviction. Visoski testified that Maxwell partially owned the
2 jet, and both pilots testified that she would tell them when to
3 fly Epstein or schedule flights for herself. The evidence at

4 trial demonstrates that Epstein and the defendant had the

5 pilots fly victims of the conspiracy. Across the timeframe of
6 all counts of conviction, Alessi, Visoski and Rodgers provided
7 personalized services that were peculiarly tailored to the

8 defendant's offenses and were not fungible services generally

9 available to the public. Again, I'm citing from the

10 Carrozzella case, 105 F.3d at 804.

11 In addition to these unknowing participants that

12 testified at trial, I find by a preponderance of the evidence
13 that there were other unknowing persons led by Maxwell. As

14 Epstein's number one, Ms. Maxwell managed Epstein's numerous

15 households and interviewed, hired and oversaw the household

16 staff. The defendant had her own personal assistants, like

17 Sarah Kellen and another individual. From the record, I can't
18 determine the precise number of these other individuals that

19 unknowingly assisted Epstein and the defendant in their
20 criminal activity, but I find an adequate basis in the record
21 that the number is sufficient to make the activity extensive
22 within the meaning of 3Bl.1(a) from 1994 to 2004. See United
23 States v. Archer, 671 F.3d 149 (2d Cir. 2011).
24 Last, the defendant objects to enhancement
25 2G1.1(b) (4) (B). That provision increases the offense level by
