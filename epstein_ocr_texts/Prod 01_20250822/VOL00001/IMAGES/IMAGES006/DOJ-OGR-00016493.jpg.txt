place; ‘that she wasn't living in that place --

THE COURT: Well, they show she didn't own it, L
SUPPOSE.

MR. EVERDELL: Correct.

TH

COURT: Tt sounds Jiké there dre different stdges
in. the purchase process,

MR. EVERDELL: Wel, ‘yes.

But the records also reflect. in the land registry that
the ownership existed with this couple whose last ‘time is
O'Neill, They owned it under the land registry records as of
1992, That title passes then to Ms. Maxwéll in 1997. Thése
ane both land megistry entries which I have here, if the Court

would liké to seé them:

And what. Mr. Grumbridge's records ‘the agreement for
sale, for example, just shows the proéess. of that. contracting,
right. So jin December of '96, the parties exchange contracts;
Mr. and Mrs. O'Neill and Ms. Maxwell entéred into contract for
sale for this property. And that deal closed as of January
1997. That's reflected in the agreement for sale. And then
the notice is given to the lJand, registry to make it an official
land record by March 6f "97. So there's a record on filé in
the land registry mecornding that. the title has passed from the
O'Neills to Ms, Maxwell as of March of '97,

So there's a couple of documents that we think are
relevant that we think. Mr. Rooney could. enter into evidence.
