1 place; that she wasn't living in that place --

2 THE COURT: Well, they show she didn't own it, I

3 suppose.

4 MR. EVERDELL: Correct.

a THE COURT: It sounds like there are different stages
6 in the purchase process.

7 MR. EVERDELL: Well, yes.

8 But the records also reflect in the land registry that
9 the ownership existed with this couple whose last time is

10 O'Neill. They owned it under the land registry records as of
11 1992. That title passes then to Ms. Maxwell in 1997. These

12 are both land registry entries which I have here, if the Court
13 would like to see them.

14 And what Mr. Grumbridge's records -- the agreement for
15 sale, for example, just shows the process of that contracting,
16 right. So in December of '96, the parties exchange contracts;
17 Mr. and Mrs. O'Neill and Ms. Maxwell entered into contract for
18 sale for this property. And that deal closed as of January

19 1997. That's reflected in the agreement for sale. And then
20 the notice is given to the land registry to make it an official
2l land record by March of '97. So there's a record on file in
22 the land registry recording that the title has passed from the
23 O'Neills to Ms. Maxwell as of March of '97.
24 So there's a couple of documents that we think are
25 relevant that we think Mr. Rooney could enter into evidence.
