LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 told you that she knows what a British accent was. And she

2 didn't identify this person as Ghislaine back in 2007. And it

3 was Roberts who instructed her how to massage Epstein. And

4 Roberts and Epstein had sex while Carolyn watched. And Epstein

S paid Carolyn. And Carolyn and Roberts left. And Carolyn

6 looked up Epstein's number in a phone book. And she called

7 Eostein. And either Epstein or Kellen would call her, she

8 said.

9 And on the second visit, the chef asked her if she was
10 hungry. And she was greeted by someone named Sarah. And Sarah
11 is the one that placed towels on the massage table. And Sarah
12 called to tell her about concert tickets. And Epstein sent her
13 gifts. And Kellen took pictures of her.

14 That's her story from 2007. Not one mention of
15 Ghislaine or Maxwell or Maxwell calling her or Maxwell trying
16 to touch her breasts. I mean, that would be something you
17 would tell the FBI who was there investigating you â€”--
18 investigating a sex assault inguiry, right? She didn't mention
19 anything about Maxwell or Maxwell touching her breast.
20 And one year later, she files not one, but two civil
21 lawsuits. And exactly like her statement to Mr. -- Special
22 Agent Richards, she has lawyers, they draft up these long
23 lawsuits. And not one thing in those civil lawsuits, that go
24 on for 70 pages and 209 paragraphs, is there one mention of
25 Maxwell or Ghislaine.
