Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 128 of 257 2962
LEKVMAX6 Summation. —- Ms. Menninger
told you that she knoWs what a British accént was. And she
didn't. identify this person as Ghislaine back in 2007. And. it
was Roberts whd ‘instructed her how to masSagée Epstein. And
Reberts and Epstein had. sex while Carolyn watched. And. Epstein
paid Carolyn. And Carolyn and Roberts left. And Carolyn
looked up Epstein's number .in a phone book... -And she called
Epstein. And é6ither Epstein or Kellen, wotild call Her, shé
sald.

And or thé sécond visit, ‘the chef asked her if she was
hungry, -And she was greeted by someone named Sarah, And Sarah

is thé one that placed towels oh the massage table. And Sarak

called to tell her about concert tickets. And Epstein, sent her
gifts. And Kéllén todk pictures 6f her.

That's her story from 2007. Not one mention of
Ghislaine or Maxwell 6r Maxwell calling her or Maxwell trying
to touch her breasts. I imean, that would be something you
would tell thé FBI who was there investigating you ==
Lovestigating a sex assault inquiry, right? She didn't mention
anything about, Maxwell or Maxwell touching her breast.

And one year later, she files mot one, but two civil
lawsuits. And exactly like her statement to Mr. == Special
Agent. Richards, she has lawyers, they draft up these Long
lawsuits. And not oné thing in those Civil lawsuits, that go
on. for 70. pages and 209 paragraphs, is there one mention of
Maxwell or Ghislaine.
