LEGCmax4 Loftus - direct

THE COURT: I have them. And have you agreed on How
they come in?

MS. COMEY: Your Honor, wé've offered to stspulate to

what the 302 says. My understanding is that the defense

prefers a livé witness, but we have offered to stipiilatie to
exactly what the witness would testify to if they wish...

MR. PAGLIUCA: The witness is here, your Honor. It
will be quicker just to put on the testimony than to draft up a
stipuldttion and rédd it ‘into the record. So I think that's
what makes sense to me.

THE GOURT: I nmiean,; I can't force a stip. IT can
strongly encourage when it makes sense. Ll right.

And then what's next?

MR. PAGLIUCA: The ones that are in contention, your
Honor, are transcript trial testiamohy 1564, lines 4 through 7,
and, page 1565, 18 through 23.

THE COURT: Let me just get tly eyes 6n it. Okay: Go
ahead.

MR. PAGLIUCA: That Gorresponds to 3505, 005, page 1,
second paragraph, the inconsistent statement is, "Virginia
approached Carolyn at a party and asked her if she would liké
to make $300."

THE GOURT: So what's in dispute is whether it was at
a party or at the Virginia House?

MR. PAGLIUCA: Correct.
