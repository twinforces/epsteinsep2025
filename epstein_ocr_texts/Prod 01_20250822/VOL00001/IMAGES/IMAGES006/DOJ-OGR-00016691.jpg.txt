LCGCmax6 Aznaran â€” direct

1 MR. EVERDELL: I don't know if she put a timeframe on
2 exactly when that was. I'm told it was not -- she testified it
3 was not during the period of the charged conspiracy when she

4 was on public assistance, but she did testify to it and that's
a) now on the record, and if these records tend to counter that

6 point, that she had made that point to the jury, I think we

7 could use these records to show that.

8 With the other travelers, your Honor, I think we can

9 come to a practical solution.

10 THE COURT: See if you can come to a solution and you
11 can tell me where we are. We'll break for 10 minutes.

12 (Recess)

13 THE COURT: All right. Where are we?

14 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, we conferred with the

15 government. We reached agreement as to redactions and other

16 omissions from this exhibit and we're just now printing new

17 copies of the revised exhibit. We have about half of those

18 copies. It's coming up right now and we'll have the other half
19 shortly in just a couple minutes.
20 THE COURT: Okay.
21 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I have your copy I'll hand
22 up, and one to the government, and we'll put one, with the
23 Court's permission, facedown in the witness box.
24 THE COURT: Okay. Ms. Pomerantz, acceptable?
25 MS. POMERANTZ: Yes, your Honor.
