LCKVMAX2 Summations â€”- Ms. Moe

1 part of his testimony about that. You know that Jane traveled
2 with Maxwell and Epstein because Jane told you that. But you

3 also know it because Alessi told you about that. And you know
4 it because the flight records show it too.

5 So let's take a look at Government Exhibit 662. So in
6 the flight records, you learned that the pilots didn't always

7 see the passengers or learn their names; sometimes they just

8 wrote one female or one passenger. Here's an example from

9 January of 1995. And, of course, you know that Maxwell and

10 Epstein wouldn't have been eager to have a pilot log the name
11 of the kid they were bringing on trips. They wouldn't be eager
12 to introduce her to the pilots until she got older.

13 But Jane is listed on several flights in these

14 records. Here's the first one where her name appears. It's

15 November 1996, when Jane was just 16 years old. Here she is on
16 a flight from Palm Beach to Teterboro Airport. That's the

17 airport they would use when they were flying to New York.

18 What you're looking at is cold, hard proof that Jane
19 was an underage girl being transported to New York. And while
20 Maxwell isn't listed on the flight log for the flight there,
21 you know she was there because you look -- if you look at the
22 second entry right below that, she's on the flight log leaving
23 New York the very next flight. That's how you know that
24 Maxwell was in New York too. She's right there.
25 Here's the next flight where Jane's name appears.
