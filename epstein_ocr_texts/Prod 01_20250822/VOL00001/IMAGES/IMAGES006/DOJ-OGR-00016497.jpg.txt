LEGVMAX1

THE COURT: I waS sort of leaning that way when I
thought the attorney was going to come testify whe could be
crossed, on this precise question. But you want it to just come

in. -- you want a fact mot in issue, which is the oQwnership.

question, ‘you want an inference from ownershi'p -- ownership 15

confusing; but the inference from the timing of ownership as to

testimony that would come in from Ms. Maxwell.

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, IT 'think we have records
which we'd have tq find and anticipate this being the issue,
But Ms. Maxwell had another place in Lohddén at a stréét called
Stanhope Mews, I think, it. was 69 Stanhope Mews. And ‘we may be
able to find the title records that she sold it, because she

had, that. prior to the Kinnerton Street residence. And J think,

if you have == we'd have to l6ok for those. I think we
probably can find ‘them. But, they would, show that. she had
another plate until she bought this new plate:

So 1 think that is a fair inference to say that if
somebody S6whed andéther place and didn't buy another placé until
later, that they ane not. living at that new place if they owned,
the other place. That's just. common sense,

THE COURT: (And why can't the attorney who you had
proffered as the witness for this testify?

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, if we need the attorney, we
can try to get him here, but we just couldn't get him here
