1 THE COURT: I was sort of leaning that way when I

2 thought the attorney was going to come testify who could be

3 crossed on this precise question. But you want it to just come
4 in -- you want a fact not in issue, which is the ownership

5 question, you want an inference from ownership -- ownership is
6 confusing; but the inference from the timing of ownership as to
7 when she lived there, which is contradicted by deposition

8 testimony that would come in from Ms. Maxwell.

9 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think we have records

10 which we'd have to find and anticipate this being the issue.

11 But Ms. Maxwell had another place in London at a street called
12 Stanhope Mews, I think it was 69 Stanhope Mews. And we may be
13 able to find the title records that she sold it, because she

14 had that prior to the Kinnerton Street residence. And I think
15 if you have -- we'd have to look for those. I think we

16 probably can find them. But they would show that she had

17 another place until she bought this new place.

18 So I think that is a fair inference to say that if

19 somebody owned another place and didn't buy another place until
20 later, that they are not living at that new place if they owned
21 the other place. That's just common sense.
22 THE COURT: And why can't the attorney who you had
23 proffered as the witness for this testify?
24 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, if we need the attorney, we
25 can try to get him here, but we just couldn't get him here
