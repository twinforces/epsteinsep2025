1 MR. EVERDELL: Right.

2 THE COURT: So just rather than give the jury two

3 elements with two different ages, which I think makes sense.

4 But so then the suggestion is "to transport an individual under
S the age of 17."

6 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.

7 THE COURT: Mr. Rohrbach?

8 MR. ROHRBACH: The government agrees that that's an

9 element of the offense. There is no reason to incorporate all
10 of the elements into the summary.

11 THE COURT: Well, he's not asking all. He's just

12 asking this one. So --

13 MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine, your Honor, although the
14 government would note that that creates an asymmetry between

15 Counts One and Three, so we think it should be in both or

16 neither.

17 THE COURT: All right.

18 MR. EVERDELL: Well, it's not an element of the

19 offense in Count One. I add it there because it says "an
20 individual" and "an individual" seems sort of vague. I mean,
al there's testimony about lots of individuals traveling, and
22 transporting here and there. We just wanted to make it clear
23 to the jury that we're talking about individuals under the age
24 of 17 rather than all these people on the flight logs that we
25 saw who we have no evidence of their ages.
