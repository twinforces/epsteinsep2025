LCKCmax3 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 tea in that schoolgirl outfit and Epstein initiated sexual

2 contact with Kate, later that day, Maxwell asked Kate if she

3 had fun. Maxwell told Kate that she was a good girl.

4 Kate also told you about how Maxwell complained about
5 Epstein's need to have sex three times a day, how Maxwell was

6 constantly looking for someone to give him blowjobs. That

7 makes it crystal clear exactly what Maxwell intended when she

8 was taking Jane on these trips. Jane was there to satisfy

9 Epstein's constant need for sexual gratification. The evidence
10 proves to you that Maxwell is guilty on Count Four.

11 Now let's talk about Count Six, it's sex trafficking
12 an individual under age 18. This count is about Carolyn.

13 The first element is that the defendant knowingly

14 recruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or

15 obtained Carolyn. You heard about how the defendant called

16 Carolyn for massage appointments with Epstein. She was

17 recruiting, enticing, providing, and obtaining Carolyn every

18 single time she did that.

19 The second element is that the defendant knew that
20 Carolyn was under age 18. Ladies and gentlemen, Carolyn was a
al 14-year-old girl. She came to the house over and over again
22 and interacted with Maxwell. She talked about her home life,
23 she told Maxwell she was too young to travel, that her mother
24 wouldn't let her go on trips. She was a girl who had just
25 dropped out of middle school. There just can't be any question
