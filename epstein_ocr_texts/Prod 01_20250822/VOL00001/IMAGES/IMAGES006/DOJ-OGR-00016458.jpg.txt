1 Ghislaine to have Ghislaine arrange the travel. But she didn't
2 even offer it herself. It seems like the best we have on this
3 record is that she performed a ministerial function of

4 arranging the travel. But that is not doing something, a

5 cause, that produces an effect; that is simply doing paperwork.
6 That is not what the statute was designed to criminalize.

7 There has to be some effort to entice or persuade or induce

8 somebody to travel, which we do not have on this record.

9 And one case I would direct your Honor to is United

10 States v. Joseph, 542 F.3d 13 (2d Cir. 2008). In that case,

11 the Second Circuit reversed the conviction for enticement under
12 this same statute, 2422, because the jury was instructed that
13 they could convict if they found the defendant made the

14 possibility of a sex act "more appealing," as if that was

15 enough to entice, if they made it more appealing.

16 The court held that that was not enough to establish
17 persuasion, inducement, enticement under the statute. And here
18 we don't even have that. We just have her performing what a

19 travel agent would do, which is arranging travel plans. And
20 that is not enough, under the wording of the statute, to prove
21 enticement. And there is nothing also from any member of the
22 conspiracy on that same count, your Honor, doing anything to
23 arrange or induce the travel.
24 So I would argue, your Honor, that on the record we
25 have before us, there is insufficient evidence to establish
