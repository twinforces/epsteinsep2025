LBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Cross

1 provided to Dr. Rocchio.

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Do you need a response from me, your

3 Honor?

4 THE COURT: Go ahead.

5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, your Honor, I understand Jencks

6 Act production, but this is a separate issue. She relied on

7 this in preparation for her testimony today, and I believe that
8 under Rule 16 I am allowed to examine whatever she relied on in
9 anticipation and preparation for her testimony here today.

10 This would be part of the bases for her opinion, your
11 Honor.

12 THE COURT: Well, I don't know if it is. Notes that
13 have a subject heading "grooming," for example, that she threw
14 away which are not in the file are not a bases for her opinion.
15 So I don't know that the whole file is subject to that theory.
16 The contract between her and the government is not a
17 basis for opinion, but you've asked for that since she's

18 included that in the file.

19 MR. PAGLIUCA: I have that, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: Right. But you see the point.
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: I understand. But I don't know what is
22 in her file, is my point.
23 THE COURT: Right. Well, so then the question, I
24 think, is: What is in your file that forms the basis for your
25 opinion? That will get us to where we need to get.
