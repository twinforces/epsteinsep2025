provided to Dr. Rocchioc.

MR. PAGLIUCA: Do you. need a response from me, your
Honor?

THE COURT: Go ahead.

MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, your Honor, I understand Jencks.
Act production, but this is a separate issue. She relied on

this in preparation for her testimony today, and I believe that

under Rule 16 I am allowed to examine whatever she relied on in
anticipation and preparation for her testimony Nere today.

This would be part of the bases for her opinion, your
Honor.

THE COURT: Well; I don't. know if it is. Notes that
have a subject, heading "grooming," for example, that she threw
away which aré not in the filé aré not a bases for her opinion.
So I don't, know that the whole file is subject, 'to that, theory.

The contract between her and the govérnmiént is not a
basis for opinion, but, 'you've asked for that since she's
included. that in the file.

MR. PAGLIUCA: I have that, your Honor.

THE COURT: Right. But you see the point.

MR. PAGLIUCA: J ‘understand. But, I don"t, know what is
in her file, is my point.

THE COURT: Right. Well, so Ehen ‘the question, I
think, is: What is in your filé that forms the basis for your
opinion? That will get us to where we need to get.
