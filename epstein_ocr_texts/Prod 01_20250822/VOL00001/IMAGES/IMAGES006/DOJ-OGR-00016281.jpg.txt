your Honor.

have impéachéd hér yet or called her story into question in
opening about this issue. So I'ma little —- I understand that
eventtially it may be, if I do impeach Her.

THE COURT: The opening questioned. the veracity of all
of the accusers.

MS. MENNINGER: Not, on every point, your Honor. I

THE COURT: Okay.

MS. MENNINGER: Not. that. she was there, for example,
or anything like that. So I don't believe that it's been.
opened, and I think it's just bolstering.

THE COURT: Well, Js the statement just that. she's
going to be there or what's == what is thé anticipatéd
statement?

MS. MENNINGER: Actually, my reading of the discovery
1s that she told her mom, I wasn't raped. And so if that's
what is plannéd to6 be elicited, that's going to bé a probleni
for a lot, of other reasons that have been litigated.

THE COURT: Is that what she's going to say?
