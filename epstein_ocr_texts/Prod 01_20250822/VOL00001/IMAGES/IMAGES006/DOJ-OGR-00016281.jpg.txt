2 THE COURT: Is this not a prior consistent statement

3 that was litigated or discussed?

4 MS. POMERANTZ: This is a prior consistent statement,
S your Honor.

6 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I don't believe that we

7 have impeached her yet or called her story into question in

8 opening about this issue. So I'ma little -- I understand that
9 eventually it may be, if I do impeach her.

10 THE COURT: The opening questioned the veracity of all
11 of the accusers.

12 MS. MENNINGER: Not on every point, your Honor. I

13 mean ——

14 THE COURT: Okay.

15 MS. MENNINGER: Not that she was there, for example,
16 or anything like that. So I don't believe that it's been

17 opened, and I think it's just bolstering.

18 THE COURT: Well, is the statement just that she's

19 going to be there or what's -—- what is the anticipated
20 statement?
21 MS. MENNINGER: Actually, my reading of the discovery
22 is that she told her mom, I wasn't raped. And so if that's
23 what is planned to be elicited, that's going to be a problem
24 for a lot of other reasons that have been litigated.
25 THE COURT: Is that what she's going to say?
