LCKVMAX6 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 stand with some names in it, and not one single person says

2 that that black address book is from the time we're talking

3 about and not Epstein's own address book from years later after
4 Ghislaine had nothing to do with it. Not one. If all these

5 employees are around the house all the time seeing these

6 address books laying everywhere, where are those employees and
7 where are all those address books? So Juan Alessi is the sole
8 guardian who can tell you about this black address book from

9 which the government wants to build their case.

10 What do we know about Mr. Alessi?

11 During his direct examination, the government asked

12 him about his burglary of Jeffrey Epstein's home. And he

13 turned on the stand and he looked at you in the eye and he

14 said, I will tell the truth. And then he proceeded to not tell
15 you the truth. He told you a story that he concocted to make
16 himself look better. He told you that he broke into Epstein's
17 home one time to try to help someone because he was out of

18 money. But he told the police back in 2003 that he broke in to
19 steal a gun.
20 He told you he stole the money because he needed it,
21 but then he told you he owned multiple rental properties. He
22 told you he broke in once. But the truth was, as he told the
23 police in 2003, he broke in twice. He went in, stole some
24 money, and then he came back a few weeks later and stole some
25 more money. So the man who turned and looked you in the eye
