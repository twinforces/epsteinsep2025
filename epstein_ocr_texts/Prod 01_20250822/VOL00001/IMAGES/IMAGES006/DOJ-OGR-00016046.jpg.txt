Dear Jeff:

On behalf of the students, faculty, and staff at the
Interlochen Center for the Arts, I want to thank you for
your generous contribution of $25,000.

i

As you know, the support dollars received each year
through the efforts of many individuals add up to a wealth
of opportunities for those young students who come to make
Interlochen their artistic home.

Your gift enables us to continue to provide quality
educational opportunities, enhance our tradition of
excellence, and assist in the development of tomorrow’s
leaders.

You have made a difference. For that irreplaceable
gift, we thank you.

With warm regards,
\
Ven
