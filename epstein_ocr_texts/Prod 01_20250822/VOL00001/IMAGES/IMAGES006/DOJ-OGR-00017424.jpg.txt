LBUCmax3 Visoski - cross
1 BY MR. EVERDELL:
2 Q. She was a woman?
3 A. Yes.
4 Q. Mr. Visoski, in all these flights that you flew, the
5 several hundred to a thousand flights that you piloted for
6 Mr. Epstein in this time period, you also never saw any kind of
7 sexual activity occur on the planes; isn't that right?
8 A. I never saw any sexual activity, no.
9 Q. And you certainly never saw anyone engaging in sex acts
10 with underage girls on the plane?
11 A. Absolutely not.
12 Q. In fact, you never saw anyone engaging in sex acts with any
13 of the women on the flights period; right?
14 A. That is correct.
15 Q. Now, you testified, I think we already established this,
16 that when you were flying, in flight, the cockpit doors were
17 closed?
18 A. That is correct.
19 Q. So if the cockpit doors were closed, you couldn't
20 necessarily see what was going on in the cabin during the
21 flights; right?
22 A. Not at all, no.
23 Q. But you were never instructed by Epstein or anyone else
24 that you were not allowed to leave the cockpits during the
25 flights; is that correct?
