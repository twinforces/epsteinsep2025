1 (In open court)

2 THE COURT: Thank you so much for your patience,

3 members of the jury. I am going to send you back in a moment

4 to begin your deliberations.

a There are five of you who are alternate jurors, and

6 I'm going to tell you, you're the higher number five. They are
7 juror number 125, juror number 149, 151, 152, and 170.

8 The alternate jurors were not to participate in the

9 deliberations, however, it is possible, and it does happen,

10 that we need to bring an alternate juror back in order to

11 participate in the deliberations. So, I am going to release

12 the alternate jurors.

13 You can't participate in the deliberations unless and
14 until you hear from Ms. Williams that you're being brought back
15 into the deliberations. However, because you could be brought
16 back into the deliberations, and because it does happen, all of
17 my rules continue to apply.

18 So, for my alternate jurors, no communications with

19 anyone through any means about the case, no discussions, no
20 consuming of any information through any means about the case
21 until you hear from Ms. Williams either asking you to come back
22 because we need you for the deliberations or telling you that
23 the process is over, and that is very important.
24 So, again, the alternates are 125, 149, 151, 152, and
25 170.
