what Jane said.

Now the Court did instruét the jury that. they can
consider the testamony of Kate and of Annie for whatever
relévdnt purpose they see fit, and I suppése that. could be
evidence of a conspiracy, cerrect, but for them to actually
convict on this, they have to believe that somebody committed a

violation of New York law, and that relates solely to Jane, and

so. we don't think == there aré ho multiple alleged victims of
this conspiracy other ‘than, Jane that's been established, by the

evidence dat trial. S6 we believe while they may be able to

consider the testimony of Annie and, Kate as evidence of some

sort of rélevdnt evidence that speaks to this. conspiracy, that

LS NOt. they are not victims of this conspiracy, there was no
violation of Néw York law that they testified to, ahd that is
Jane alone. So this count relates solely to Jane, as does the
substantive count, your. Honor.
