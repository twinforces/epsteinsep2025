BY MR. EVERDELL:

on And. just to be clear, when I refer to border crossing, what
doés that mean, t6 ‘you?

A. That, it could mean either any international traveler
coming into the United States, at any international airport,
seaport, or land border along the Mexican or northern border of
Canada..

Q. And the information you just listed. is stored in the TECS
system for those passengers that aré Entering ‘through ports of
entry; as. that right?

A. Yes.

Q. How fan back do the border crossing records go Ain the TECS
system?

A. It's hard to say. In my experience, I have not seen any
bérdér trossings any earlier than roughly the early "90s, mid
"90s.

OQ. And how does the border crossing information that is stored
in, the TECS system get input into that database?

A; So, there is another system, it's called APIS, Advanced
Passenger Information System, and essentially what happens Js
international airlines or any airline that has international
flights coming ,into or departing the United, States, they're
required to submit their manifest to us. The manifest géts
loaded into APIS, which is then linked to text, and that's how
we're able to see that informat.ion..
