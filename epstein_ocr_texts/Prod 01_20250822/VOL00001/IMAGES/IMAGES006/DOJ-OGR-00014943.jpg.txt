1 When you look at who reports that they've been sexually abused,
2 is it reported more often by individuals who are members -- who
3 are women versus men. Is it reported, you know, more often or
4 found to have occurred more often, for example, in a group of

5 individuals who are cognitively or intellectually disabled.

6 MS. POMERANTZ: Ms. Durocher, can we pull up

7 Government Exhibit 3, please. Can we turn to page 3.

8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, we looked at this table before. Can you

9 please explain, what if anything does the table tell you about
10 particular vulnerabilities.

11 A. So the particular vulnerabilities in particular are most

12 relevant to the first stage of the grooming model, which is the
13 victim-selection model, in terms of looking at who are the

14 individuals that offenders choose to abuse or who end up

15 abusing. And, again, I think it's important to bear in mind

16 that this whole list was initially established from literature
17 looking at what offenders have told us they look for as well as
18 what kinds of prevalence rates have occurred in certain

19 populations.
20 And then these, in that top section of victim
21 selection, are the factors, vulnerability factors, that there
22 has been statistically significant agreement by professionals
ao factor into victim selection.
24 Q. And when you say "the top section," you're referring to
25 the -- what part of the table are you referring to?
