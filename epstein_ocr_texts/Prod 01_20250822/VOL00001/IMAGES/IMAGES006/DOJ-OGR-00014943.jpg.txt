LBAAMAX 3ps Rocchio - Direct

When you look at who reperts that they've been sexually abused,
is it reported more often ‘by individuals who are members == who
are women versus men. Is it reported, yeu know, more often or
found to have occurred more often; for example, in sa group of
individuals who are cognitively or intellectually disabled.

MS. POMBRANTZ: Ms. Durocher; can we pull up
Government, Exhibit 3, please. Can we turn to page 3.
Q. Dr. Rocchio, we looked at this table before. Can you
please explain, what if anything does the table tell you about
particular vulnerabilities.
A. So the particular vulnerabilities in particular are most
relevant to the first stage of the ‘grooming model; which is the
victim-selection model, in terms of looking at, who are ‘the
individuals that offenders choose to dbusé or who end up
abusing. And, again, I think it*s important to bear in mind.
that this whole list was initially established fr6m literdturé
looking at, what offenders have told us they look for as well as

what kinds of. prevalence rates have occurred in cértain

populations.

And, then these, in that top section of victim
selection, are ‘the factors, vulnerability factors, ‘that there
hdas béen statistically Significant agreemént by professionals
factor into victim selection.

Q. And whén you say "the top section,” you'ré referring to

the -- what part of the table are you referring to?
