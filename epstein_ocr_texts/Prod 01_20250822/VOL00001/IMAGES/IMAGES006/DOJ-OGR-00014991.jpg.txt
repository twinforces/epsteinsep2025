1 grooming; is that correct?

2 A. So it -- grooming, the tactics you're referring to area

3 series of manipulative strategies. And to the extent that

4 those manipulative strategies are being used to increase the

5 likelihood of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, then we

6 would describe it as sexual grooming.

7 Q. Let me ask you a question. In order for something to

8 become grooming, you are looking at the intent of the groomer

9 relative to the act; correct?

10 A. So the intent and the function of the behavior relative to
11 the act has always been part of the definition of grooming,

12 yes.

13 Q. So the answer to my question is yes; is that right?

14 A. Yes.

15 Q. So absent the intent to sexually abuse someone, there are a
16 myriad of actions that one could consider grooming?

17 A. The actions themselves are in the function of the

18 establishment of a relationship of trust and attachment or

19 trauma bonding. So to the extent that those behaviors build a
20 relationship, then yes, they could be in another context
21 normative behaviors.
22 Q. And normative behaviors being normal behaviors; right?
23 A. It could be.
24 Q. So for example, a parent wants to take an interest in their
25 child; correct?
