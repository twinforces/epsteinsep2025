1 mean the flight records that are in evidence?

2 MS. MOE: That's not correct, your Honor. The

3 entirety of the flight records in evidence are not public.

4 That's the exact reason why portions of them are under seal and
S redacted. So we're not talking about the same flight records.
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Well, I disagree, but the point is, we
7 had a live witness who reviewed what purported to be in the

8 media her travel with Mr. Epstein. That media exposure has

9 influenced other people and I believe, frankly, influenced

10 other people, relative to my client, putting my client on

11 flights saying my client did things. It is the exposure to

12 this information. This witness, I believe, will testify, and
13 has so indicated to the government, that what she viewed was

14 inaccurate information. That's the import of it.

15 THE COURT: So the theory is media defined broadly,

16 could be a blog, a tweet, contains any inaccurate information,
17 it is relevant to ask this witness as to the accuracy of that?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: It is inaccurate as to her personally.
19 THE COURT: I understand. But let's say you pull from
20 some blog post, something perhaps inaccurate; relevant to ask
al this witness?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: About her and flight records.
23 THE COURT: Whatever it is from whatever source, there
24 is flight records that show she went to the moon, you should
25 ask her about it?
