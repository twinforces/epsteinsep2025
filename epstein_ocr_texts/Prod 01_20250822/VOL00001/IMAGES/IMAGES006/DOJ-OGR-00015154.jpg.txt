public-record.trial testimony. of firsthand, witnesses, and-thus is not of significant:historical or
‘public interest, there is arguably no, charter for even undertaking the Ja re Craigtinquiry. After
all, the: “special circumstances” exception to.Rule 6(c) only applics in “exceptional
circumstances,” ‘not to “garden, varicty” grand jury testimony: Jn re Craig, 13.1 F.3d at. 103

Noncthcless, for completeness, the Court cvaluates the Government’s motion in Irght of
the non-exhaustive factors listed in /n. re: Craig. The Court also addresses two other factors
‘implicated by the motion: the perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s victims, as. expressed, in
letters to the Court; and the systemié interest:in grand. jury secrecy.

As this assessment:shows, the Government has failed, by wide margin, to carry its
burden. These factors, considered;together, favor denial, ofits motion to unseal.

1. Identity. of the Party Seeking Disclosure

This factor ordinarily carrics “great weight,” and.“the government’s position should be
paid considerable heed.” Ja.re Craig, 131 F.3d at 106. ‘Butithe, Government's position is “not
dispositive.” Jd. “Government support cannot ‘confer’ disclosure, nor can government.
opposition preclude it.” Jd. And courts ‘in this District, applying the /n re Craig factors, have
ruled, against the Government’s position. Se@Jn're National Security: Archive, 104 F. Supp. 3d
at:628-29 (ordering, over Government’s objection, disclosure of testimony ‘of two witnesses
before grand jury that indicted Julius and’Ethel Rosenberg forespionage);./n re AHA, 49 F.
Supp. 2d at 278,.297-98 (ordering, over Government’s objection, disclosure of testimony before
grand juries that.investigated and/or indicted.Alger Hiss for espionage).

This factor favors disclosure. But: for'two reasons, the ‘Court accords this factor limited.

‘weight.
