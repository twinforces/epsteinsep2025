1 Street documents we've been talking about, in that the legal

2 documents describing when Mr. Epstein abandoned this property

3 does not reflect where Mr. Epstein was living. As the defense
4 knows, one of the defense witnesses, who they ultimately

5 decided not to call, would have testified that Epstein was

6 living on East 7J1lst Street prior to 1996.

7 And so if the Court admits this -- this is the reason
8 this has to go first in the remaining issues. If the Court

9 admits this, the government would put on rebuttal evidence

10 showing that, in fact, Mr. Epstein lived on Vist Street before
11 he says he abandoned the property in 1996.

12 So that's sort of a substantive background point.

13 Moving through the documents, your Honor, Judge Chin's
14 opinion is a summary judgment opinion. So I think it's quite
15 clear actually that the facts can reasonably be disputed. The
16 summary judgment standard, as the Court well knows, is that the
17 Court -- is that Judge Chin had to take all facts in the light
18 most favorable to the nonmoving party, which in this case was
19 not the United States. So I think it very much can be
20 controverted that the fact in -- the statement in the
21 background section of Judge Chin's opinion is not a factual
22 finding about when Mr. Epstein abandoned --
23 THE COURT: Can I see it?
24 MS. MENNINGER: What's that, your Honor?
25 THE COURT: Can I see the document?
