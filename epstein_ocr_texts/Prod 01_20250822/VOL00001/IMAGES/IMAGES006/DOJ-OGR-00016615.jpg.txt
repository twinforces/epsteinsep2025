LCGCmax4 Loftus â€” direct

1 Post-event -- somebody could supply post-event information that
2 is accurate and that might cause somebody to supplement their

3 memory with accurate information. Post-event suggestion

4 typically refers to a situation where you're supplying people

a with new information that is not particularly accurate.

6 Q. Memory has been termed a constructive process; correct?

7 A. Yes.

8 Q. Could you explain what that means to the jury.

9 A. What we mean by that is, as I testified earlier, we don't
10 just record events and play it back later like a recording

11 device would work, like a video machine, but rather, we are

12 actually constructing our memories when we retrieve memories.
13 We often take bits and pieces of experience sometimes that

14 occurred at different times and places, bring it together, and
15 construct what feels like a recollection.

16 Q. With regard to the experiments that you have conducted, by
17 virtue of the experiment itself, you have proof of what would
18 form the basis of a memory; correct?

19 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection.
20 THE COURT: Just a moment. Grounds.
21 MS. POMERANTZ: Leading.
22 THE COURT: Sustained.
23 BY MS. STERNHEIM:
24 Q. When you do memory research, is there a process in your
25 experiment that sets up a basis for a memory?
