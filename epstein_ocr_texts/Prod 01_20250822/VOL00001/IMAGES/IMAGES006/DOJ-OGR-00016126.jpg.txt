7 testimony of witnesses, as well as documents and exhibits. The
8 government will examine the witnesses and then the defendant's
9 lawyers may cross-examine them.

10 Following the government's case, the defendant may

11 present a case, if she wishes. Again, because of the

12 presumption of innocence, the defendant is not required to

13 offer any proof. If the defendant does present a defense case,
14 the defense witnesses will testify and the government will have
15 the opportunity to cross-examine them.

19 statements are not evidence, their closing arguments are not
20 evidence either.

23 must be unanimous; it must be based on the evidence or lack of
24 evidence presented at trial.
25 Your deliberations are secret. You'll never have to
