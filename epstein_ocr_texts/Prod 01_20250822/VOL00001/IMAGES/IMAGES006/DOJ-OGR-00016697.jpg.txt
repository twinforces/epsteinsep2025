1 Q. And the one below that says APIS?

2 A. Yes.

3 Q. Can you explain the difference between the two.

4 A. So the first one, airline, not API. An airline employee at
a some point manually entered that person's information into

6 their manifest system as opposed to APIS, which is Advanced

7 Passenger Information System. That means that that airline

8 submitted their manifest electronically to the APIS system and
9 it was electronically and automatically uploaded into TECS.

10 Q. Okay. And what's next?

11 A. The next column is status.

12 Q. What does that indicate. Actually, if I can have you look
13 maybe at page 3 of the document, and you look at top of the

14 page, the third entry down in the column status, it says the

15 word passenger; is that right?

16 A. Yes.

17 Q. So what does that indicate?

18 A. That indicates that that person was, at one point or

19 another, added to that manifest of that airline for that
20 particular flight.
21 Q. Going to the next column, updated status.
22 A. Updated status, I have, in all of my experience querying
23 travel records, I have never seen anything in that column, and
24 I honestly don't know what it means or what it's supposed to.
25 Q. Understood. What about the columns to the right of that?
