1 issue of the Ex Post Facto Clause being implicated. They want
2 to cast this as purely a Sixth Amendment issue and cited cases
3 along the Apprendi lines. But this is an ex post facto issue

7 Under the cases that we've cited, your Honor, we think

10 ex post facto law. I just, for example, highlight for your

11 Honor the Tykarsky opinion that we cited for the Court. That
12 is not an Apprendi decision. That is not a Sixth Amendment

13 decision. In that case, there was an increase in the mandatory
14 minimum that took effect potentially after the offense conduct
15 ended. It's interesting that at the time the law was that you
16 could do that, a judge could make a finding and increase it as
17 long as it didn't increase beyond the statutory maximum, so

18 there was no Apprendi issue there. That decision later got

19 overruled by the Supreme Court, but at the time of Tykarsky, it
20 clearly wasn't a Sixth Amendment Apprendi issue. They resolved
21 that issue on an ex post facto basis. This decision about
22 whether or not the offense conduct ended at a certain time, if
23 it triggers an increase that implicates the ex post facto
24 clause is a decision for the jury to make. The government has
25 not responded to that argument, and we think that that is a
