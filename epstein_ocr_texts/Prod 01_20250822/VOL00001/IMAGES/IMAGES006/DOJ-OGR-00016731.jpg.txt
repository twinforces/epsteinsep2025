THE COURT: Matters to take up, from my perspective,.
it's obviously a long list of prior inconsistent Statements T
need to gq through, Before that, anything, counsel?

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, theré is, oné witness, ‘that

we have under subpoena. whe has not been in. contact with us that

we very much would like to Gall aS a witness. IT can Say the
name out loud or we can have a sidebar, but it is one of the
witnesses, about whom the government moved 'to preclude ‘their
testimony and your Honor ruled tast night that we would be

permitted to put that testiniony on. All 6f our attempts to

have communication, with this witness after the service of

subpoena Have goné unrespénded to. S6 I think, at this pdoéant,

we have no. choice left except ‘to ask to have intervention of

the marshals to bring that witness to court to6 testify.
THE CQURT: You'll have to file something.

MS. MENNINGER: Yess

MS. COMEY: Your Honor, this. is the first time hearing
of this. We'll have to see whatever is failed.

THE GOURT: Obvidusly, if you've got. authority f6r how

to proceed, you need to put that in quickly because we're not
delaying trial.

MS. MENNINGER: Secondly, your Honor, with respect to
the pleading that was filled. yesterday or the day before
