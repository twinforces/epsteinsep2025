1 (Jury not present)

2 THE COURT: Matters to take up, from my perspective,

3 it's obviously a long list of prior inconsistent statements I

4 need to go through. Before that, anything, counsel?

5 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, there is one witness that
6 we have under subpoena who has not been in contact with us that
7 we very much would like to call as a witness. I can say the

8 name out loud or we can have a sidebar, but it is one of the

9 witnesses about whom the government moved to preclude their

10 testimony and your Honor ruled last night that we would be

11 permitted to put that testimony on. All of our attempts to

12 have communication with this witness after the service of

13 subpoena have gone unresponded to. So I think, at this point,
14 we have no choice left except to ask to have intervention of

15 the marshals to bring that witness to court to testify.

16 THE COURT: You'll have to file something.

17 MS. MENNINGER: Yes.

18 THE COURT: Ms. Comey, anything on that?

19 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, this is the first time hearing
20 of this. We'll have to see whatever is filed.
21 THE COURT: Obviously, if you've got authority for how
22 to proceed, you need to put that in quickly because we're not
23 delaying trial.
24 MS. MENNINGER: Secondly, your Honor, with respect to
25 the pleading that was filed yesterday or the day before
