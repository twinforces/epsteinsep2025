1 guilty of these crimes? We're going to prove it to you in

2 several different ways. I want to highlight just a few of

3 those ways for you now.

4 First, you will hear from the victims, including Jane
5 herself. They will take that stand and describe the sexual

6 abuse they suffered at the hands of the defendant and Epstein.
7 They will tell you about the defendant's significant role in

8 that sexual abuse, how the defendant helped put them at ease,

9 how she talked about sexual topics with them, how the defendant
10 was sometimes in the room for the sexual abuse, how the

11 defendant sometimes touched their bodies, how the defendant

12 encouraged some of them to travel with Epstein to his homes.

13 These witnesses will be testifying about some of the most

14 painful and private experiences of their childhood, experiences
15 they couldn't talk about for years, experiences that forever

16 changed their lives, experiences that scarred them.

17 You will also hear that a fund to compensate girls who
18 Epstein abused awarded some of these witnesses millions of

19 dollars, but it will be obvious to you at this trial that these
20 witnesses would have paid anything for this not to have
21 happened to them. They would pay anything to have never met
22 the defendant and Epstein.
23 You'll also hear from people who knew some of the
24 victims, who knew them not as the adults that you will see
25 during the course of this trial, but as the kids they were when
