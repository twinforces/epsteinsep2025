1 mind of their own. Because last week the Court invited them to
2 sit the extra day and they declined that. So an inquiry may be
3 appropriate, but I don't think telling them what they should do
4 is necessarily the right thing to do.

a THE COURT: Well, I have told them previously that

6 they are here till at least 5. I think the question is

7 whether, in light of the circumstances we find ourselves, we

8 should encourage longer, if it's available to them. But you

9 think about it. I'll hear from you. I'm not intending to do
10 anything just yet. I presume we will hear from them as to this
11 evening, but think about the indication of at least some

12 extension of hours tomorrow if they have not completed the

13 task.

14 All right? Thank you.

15 (Recess pending verdict)

16 THE COURT: I have a note.

17 Under Count Four, if the defendant aided in the

18 transportation of Jane's return flight, but not the flight to
19 New Mexico, where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in
20 sexual activity, can she be found guilty under the second
2l element?
22 I'm going to let you take a -- if you want to just
23 take a look at the note. Counsel, you're welcome to take a
24 photo of it, if that helps.
25 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.
