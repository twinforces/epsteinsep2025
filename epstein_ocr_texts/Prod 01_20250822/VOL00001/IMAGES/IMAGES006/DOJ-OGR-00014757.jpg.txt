1 Carolyn credibly testified that she was paid twice as
2 much when she brought friends to the massages. Based on the

3 defendant's control of household and Carolyn's testimony that

4 the defendant on occasion paid her directly, I find it more

S probable than not by a preponderance of the evidence that

6 Virginia was also paid more as encouragement to recruit

7 additional girls.

8 Paragraph 9, there's an objection to the inclusion of
9 Kate in this paragraph. It argues that her name should be

10 deleted because Kate is not a victim of the crimes charged in
11 the indictment.

12 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I'm sorry to interrupt. I
13 think you said paragraph 9.

14 THE COURT: I did. I'm sorry. I'm skipping the first
15 number for some reason. 29. Thank you, Mr. Everdell.

16 I overrule this objection because the paragraph

17 doesn't assert that Kate was a statutory victim as we've

18 discussed throughout trial and the government didn't contend

19 that Kate was a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment,
20 and that paragraph doesn't assert that she was.
21 Paragraphs 30 to 38, there's objection throughout
22 these to the characterization of the defendant having groomed
23 Jane. JI overrule these objections. I think the government is
24 right here that the objection is conflating grooming with
25 enticement to travel for purposes of sexual contact. Jane's
