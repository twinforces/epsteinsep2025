1 Q. Does that refresh your recollection about the date that the
2 boots were seized?

3 A. This is a 302 of an interview with Annie.

4 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, we're going to stipulate

5 to the date of the seizure because I think that makes the most
6 efficient sense for use of the witness's time. I can read it

7 into the record later.

8 THE COURT: Ms. Comey.

9 MS. COMEY: So stipulated, your Honor. We'll check

10 the date, confirm the date of seizure, and then stipulate to

11 that date orally.

12 MS. MENNINGER: One more guestion for the witness,

13 though.

14 BY MS. MENNINGER:

15 Q. The discussion about Ms. Farmer wearing the boots happened
16 during a recent trial prep session; correct?

17 A. I believe so.

18 Q. And it was after the boots were seized; correct?

19 A. I believe so.
20 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor. No further
21 questions.
22 THE COURT: Thank you. Ms. Comey.
23 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.
24 May I inquire?
25 THE COURT: You may.
