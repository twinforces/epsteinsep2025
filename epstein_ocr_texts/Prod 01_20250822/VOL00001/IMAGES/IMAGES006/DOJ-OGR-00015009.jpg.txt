1 Q. And of those 77 items, we basically cut that in half, and

2 then we had 18 people that were ultimately interviewed about

3 those items. Is that right?

4 A. It was in the other order. If they used the 18 people to

5 get the list down from the 77 items to the 42.

6 Q. Right. And the author, if we can go to page 17 of Exhibit
7 3, please, at the start of page 16, bottom. So that the

8 authors conclude, "This study is the first to validate a model
9 of grooming and behaviors involved in the process, which is a
10 major step toward developing a more universally accepted

11 framework for these pre-offense behaviors." Do you see that?
12 A. Yes.

13 QO. And do you agree that this is the first to validate a

14 model?

15 A. Validate a model, yes.

16 Q. OK. And then the authors go on to the rest of the

17 conclusion here. I'm going to pick it up in the middle of that
18 paragraph. "This study has established the content validity of
19 a model of sexual grooming, therein laying the groundwork for
20 further validation of an evidence-based model of sexual
21 grooming." Do you see that?
22 A. I do.
23 Q. OK. They go on to say, "the model" -- this is the model
24 we're talking about here, correct?
25 A. This particular model.
