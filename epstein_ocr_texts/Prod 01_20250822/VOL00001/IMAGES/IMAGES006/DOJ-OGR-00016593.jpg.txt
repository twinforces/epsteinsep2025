1 A. Generally, when we do an experiment or a set of

2 experiments, we will write up a scientific publication, submit

3 it hopefully to a peer-reviewed journal where it will undergo

4 peer review and then be published and be part of the scientific

5 literature so that it's available for other people to have

6 access to.

7 Q. Please, in a very simole fashion, describe to the jury what

8 the peer review process is.

9 A. Journals that are peer-reviewed journals generally have an
10 editorial board. Members of the scientific community that will
11 review a manuscript that has been submitted for publication,

12 will review that manuscript and will make recommendations to
13 the editor about whether this manuscript is worthy of being
14 published. Is it scientifically sound, is it sufficiently
15 interesting, is it appropriate for the journal, helping the
16 editor to make that -- or should it be rejected, because it's
17 none of those things.
18 Q. In addition to your submission of your own reports to
19 peer-reviewed journals, have you had the occasion to serve on
20 the editorial boards of any peer-reviewed journals?
21 A. Well, over these years I've served on the editorial board
22 of many journals. And even today I am still on the editorial
23 board of a few journals. But over the years, many of the major
24 journals in the field of psychology.
25 Q. In the course of your career, have you been a member of any
