LBTVMAX3 Opening â€”- Ms. Sternheim
1 THE COURT: So tell me what you're going to do.
2 You're going to call -- so a witness will testify, and then
3 you're going to call that witness's attorney. What is it that
4 you're going to do? What evidence are you going to --
5) MR. PAGLIUCA: The lawyers are in proffers, your
6 Honor, and the witness is in the proffer. The witness can talk
7 about what the lawyer said to the government in the proffer.
8 The lawyers have emails to the government lawyers about what
9 their clients will or won't say. There's an email from
10 Mr. Scarola to the government in which Mr. Scarola suggests ten
11 topics for the interview with Carolyn. Those are not
12 privileged conversations.
13 THE COURT: Sorry. Just to clarify, you're saying
14 this is not what you just said, the cultivating of the stories
15 by these lawyers; you do not intend to get that by calling any
16 of these lawyers as witnesses.
17 MR. PAGLIUCA: Not unless we brief it and you give us
18 permission to do that.
19 THE COURT: But instead, it's based on communications
20 between the lawyers and the government?
2l MR. PAGLIUCA: Correct.
22 THE COURT: And email.
23 MR. PAGLIUCA: And in proffers.
24 THE COURT: And in proffers in which the government
25 was present.
