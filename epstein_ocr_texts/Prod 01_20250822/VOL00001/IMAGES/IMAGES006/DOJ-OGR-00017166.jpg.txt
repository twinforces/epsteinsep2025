LEKVMAX6 Summation. —- Ms. Menninger
significant body of research and work because she wrote one
beok called Witness for the Defense, But you will have her CV
and you Can look at her eminent qualifications and all of Her
research on how people can. develop. memories of things that
didn't. happen or remémber ‘things differently from ‘the way they
actually were and how people can develop false memories,

And what she 'told you, is, ‘that memory is ‘malleable.
Memory weakens over time, And. memory can. be impacted and
corrupted by post-event contdmination. She talked about times
when false memories can be planted -in a person's mind, and that

the pérson could then becdéme just. as emotional abdut these

created memories as other individuals who truly had, the
experieneés; And contrary to what most people think, memdry.
doesn't work like a recording device; ‘you can't just, push play
and it, all comés back later.

Memories can be impacted by post-event information
that comes from all different sources. Tnterviews that use

words that. are suggestive. You'll recall. that she talked about

the study wheré they used the word "smashed." How fast was the
Car going when it smashed into the other car; and ‘that people

gave much higher rates of speed wheh they heard that word,

because it was suggested to them that it was fast.

And then think back about how none of the interviews

ef these accusers were recorded and we don't have transcripts.

and. we don't know the words that were used in those interviews.
