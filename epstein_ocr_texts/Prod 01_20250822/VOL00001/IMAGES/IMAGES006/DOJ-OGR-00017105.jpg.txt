LCKCmax5 Summation. - Ms. Menninger

from the witnesses. You know they emailed each other, you know

they met? up after court dppedrdnces with Jeffrey Epstéin, dnd
you heard, for example, about Jane's lawyer, Robert Glassman,

Hé told her, béforé this caésé was, 6vér chargéd, that Glassman

stated before the government charged the case, Jane had

discussed ‘whether 'to cooperate -- dnd reminding you, she didn't

want to cooperate before Epstein died, but he advised her that,
to cooperate, would quote, help her case, meaning Her civil

case. She: hired Robert Glassman two weeks before she first

talked to thé FBI in September of 2019.
SQ these women, with ‘thein lawyers, walked into the

U.S; Attorney's Office, they filed théir Givil lawsuits at thé

same time, and the lawyers, like Boies Schiller, helped, set up
the Epstein Victinis Compensation Fund: Annie told you that.

On, that fund application, it asked you, are you cooperating
with a crimindl investigation, have you filed a civil suit,
because if you are, we'll just assume 'you'me a weal victim,
even though wé, the fund, aren't going to ask you any Questions
or put your story to the test. And, all of these ladies had
lawyers, went. to the FBI, and filed a civil suit and filéd a
civil, claim with the fund and they each took home millions, and,

now they dré Stuck with the stories that they told.

That's the money piece. Now for the manipulation, a

manipulation of the truth and the evidence.
