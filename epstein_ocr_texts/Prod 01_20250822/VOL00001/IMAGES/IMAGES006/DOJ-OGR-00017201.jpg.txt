LCKVMAX8 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey

1 Third. If Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie really

2 believed that making up a story about Maxwell would somehow

3 benefit them, you better believe they would have told much

4 better lies. If they wanted to frame Maxwell, if they thought
5 doing so would somehow benefit her, they would put Maxwell in

6 way deeper. They would have said that Maxwell was in the room
7 every single time Jeffrey Epstein initiated sexual contact.

8 Jane, Carolyn, and Annie would have said that Maxwell

9 participated in all kinds of sex acts: Intercourse, oral sex,
10 you name it. That's not what they did.

11 Remember, Annie was so careful to make clear that the
12 defendant touched the tops of her breasts, but not her nipples.
13 Jane was careful to explain that Maxwell wasn't always in the
14 room, and that the only physical contact she remembers is the
15 defendant touching her breasts.

16 Carolyn described oral sex and intercourse involving
17 two other women, but with Maxwell it was just one time touching
18 her breasts. Her memory is that Maxwell mostly talked with

19 her, called to schedule appointments, invited her to travel.
20 And how about Kate? She never put Maxwell in the room
21 for a single sex act. She just remembered Maxwell walking her
22 to the door and leading her into that sexualized massage. And
23 remember, she said she was 17 when this happened. If she was
24 going to lie about her age, why wouldn't she make herself
25 younger? 16, 15, 14.
