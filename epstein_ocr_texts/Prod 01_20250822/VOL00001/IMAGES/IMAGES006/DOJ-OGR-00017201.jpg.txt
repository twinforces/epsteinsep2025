LEKVMAX8 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey

Third. If Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie really
believed that making up a story about Maxwell would somehow

benefit them, you better believe they would have told much

better Lies. Lf they wanted to frame’ Maxwell, if they thought
doing So would Somehow benefit her, they would put Maxwell in

way deeper. They would have said that Maxwell was .in the .room

every single time Jeffrey Epstein initiated séxual contact.
Jane, Carolyn, and Annie would have said that Maxwell
participated in all kinds, of Séx acts: Intercourse, oral sex,
you name it. That's not what they did.

Remember, Annie was so careful to make clear that the
defendant. touched ‘the tops of her breasts, but mot her nipples.
Jane was Gareful to explain that Maxwell wasn't always in the
room, and that. the only physical contact she remembers js the
defendant. touching her breasts.

Carolyn described oral sex and, intercourse involving
two other women, but with Maxwell it was just. ohne timé touching
her breasts. Her memony is that. Maxwell mostly talked with
her, Galled t6 schedule appointments, invited her to travel.

And how about Kate? She mevern put Maxwell in, the room.
for a single sex act. She just remembered Maxwell walking her
to the door and, leading her into that. sexualized massage. And

remember, she. said shé was 17 when this happened. If shé was

going to lie about Her age, why wouldn't she make herself

younger? 16, 15, 14.
