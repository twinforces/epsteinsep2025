1 THE COURT: Well, you'll discuss it and when I come

2 back, you'll tell me, both sides, what the application is.

3 What do we have after lunch?

4 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think we would like to

5 use the Lunch break to hammer out the final stipulations. If

6 we can have extra time to get that done, I think that's going

7 to be it, is the reading of the stipulations. There are some

8 documents, but these are things we have to go through over the
) break.

10 THE COURT: So basically no other defense witnesses

11 are available today following stips. And then the open

12 question, is the defense seeking to have potentially this

13 rebuttal, rebuttal, rebuttal on points, the witness regarding
14 timing of residence on Monday. I don't know when even if the
15 defense's application -- I did ask for a proposed order because
16 I don't â€”--

17 MS. MENNINGER: It was sent, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: I mean, the question is, to what end.

19 MR. EVERDELL: Yes. Why don't we see about the
20 conferral, we'll see how that process goes and maybe it won't
21 be an issue, your Honor.
22 THE COURT: You'll confer on that. I don't know if
23 there is a conferral to be had on the Kelly issue, because I'm
24 going to spend my remaining lunch hour looking at this
25 material. Seems to me, best case scenario is if I agree with
