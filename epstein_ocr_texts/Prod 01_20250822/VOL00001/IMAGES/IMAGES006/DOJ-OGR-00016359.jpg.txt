LCACmax5 A. Farmer â€” cross

1 Q. Thank you. We talked a little bit about this conversation
2 you had with the agents in 2006, and I believe you testified

3 that you recall having Christmas lights up?

4 A. I said holiday decorations. I was selling some holiday

5 products and I remember having them out when the agents came.
6 MS. MENNINGER: Just one moment. Your Honor, after

7 the government has had a chance to look at it, I would like to
8 show the witness what's been marked as AFI1O.

9 THE COURT: Okay.

10 MS. MENNINGER: Has the government had a chance?

11 MS. POMERANTZ: Yes, your Honor, and we object to

12 this.
