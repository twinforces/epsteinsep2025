LCGVMAX3 Loftus â€” direct

1 professional organizations?

2 A. Yes.

3 Q. And give the jury just a sampling of what kind of

4 organizations those are.

5) A. Well, one of my primary organizations with which I

6 affiliate is the Association for Psychological Science. This

7 is an organization primarily of academic university research

8 psychologists, although there are many clinical researchers who
9 also belong to the organization. I was president of that

10 organization in 1998-ish.

11 I'm a member of the Western Psychological Association.
12 This is the organization in psychology that covers the western
13 region of the United States; so it's California, Oregon,

14 Washington, maybe Hawaii, and possibly some other states on the
15 west coast. And I was twice president of the Western

16 Psychological Association.

17 So those are just a couple of the organizations that I
18 affiliate with.

19 I've been president of a couple of the divisions of
20 the American Psychological Association in the past, like the
al American Psychology Law Society, and have served in other roles
22 for other organizations, not president.
23 Q. Moving on to publications. During the course of your
24 career, have you published articles and journals?
25 A. Yes.
