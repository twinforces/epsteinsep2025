LBUCmax3 Visoski - cross

1 over the years in the 2000s, as well, weren't there?

2 A. There was many, yes.

3 Q. Now, you testified that by 2004 or so, to the best of your
4 recollection, Ghislaine was traveling much less frequently on
5 Epstein's planes; isn't that right?

6 A. Yes.

7 Q. She was moving on from Epstein, was she not?

8 A. That's correct.

9 Q. Isn't it true that by 2004, Ghislaine was in a committed
10 relationship with another man?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. You're familiar with Ted Waitt?
13 A. Yes, I am.
14 Q. He's the cofounder of Gateway Incorporated, the computer
15 company, isn't he?
16 A. That's correct.
17 Q. And Ghislaine was in a relationship with Ted Waitt by 2004,
18 wasn't she?
19 A. I don't know if it was a relationship, but I know she was
20 spending a lot of time with Mr. Waitt, and I think he was
21 completing a boat that she was involved in decorating and
22 building a helipad on it. So it was a different transfer to
23 Mr. Weight.
24 Q. And, in fact, I think Ghislaine introduced you to Waitt's
25 pilots, you guys became friends?
