1 were you when that photograph was taken?

2 A. 17.

3 Q. I want to step back and ask you a little bit about your

4 home life during the years we've been talking about. When you
iy were 14 to 17 and living in Florida, can you describe for the

6 jury what your home life was like during those years?

7 A. Well, it was -- it was not great. My father had just

8 passed away, sort of suddenly, and we found ourselves losing

9 our home and moving into a pool house and not being allowed to
10 grieve the loss of my father and having a very depressed mom at
11 home.
12 Q. I think you mentioned that you felt like you weren't
13 allowed to grieve your father. Can you explain to the jury
14 what you meant by that?
15 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, your Honor. Relevance.
16 THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
17 A. Well, I grew up with a mother who didn't allow us to talk
18 about our feelings because that was a sign of weakness. So
19 grieving would be a part of that because she was very concerned
20 about appearance and what we would look like and that you
al always sort of put a pretty face on. So we really didn't
22 discuss those kinds of things at home and weren't allowed to
23 discuss it with anyone else. So, being a kid and losing your
24 dad and not being allowed to talk about it, not having anyone
25 to talk to about it, it was really difficult.
