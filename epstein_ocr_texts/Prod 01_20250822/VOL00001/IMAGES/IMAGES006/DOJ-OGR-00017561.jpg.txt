passed away, sort of. suddenly, and we found. ourselves. losing
oir home and mowing into a pool house dnd not being allowed, to

grieve the loss of my father and having a very depressed mom at

home «
Q. J, think you mentioned that you, felt lake you weren't
allowéd to grieve. your father. Can you explain to the jury
what you meant. by that?
MS. MENNINGER: Objection, yéur Honor, Rélévance.
THE COURT: Overruled. You may answer.
A; Wéll, I gréw up with a mother who didn't allow us. to talk
about our feelings because that was a sign, of weakness. So
grieving would be a part of that because she was very concerned
about appearance and what. we would look like and that ‘you
always Sort of put a pretty face 6n. So we really didn't.
discuss those kinds of things at, home and weren't. allowed ‘to
discuss it, with anyone else. So, being a kid ahd losing your
dad and not being allowed to talk about it, not having anyone
to talk to about it, it was really difficult.
