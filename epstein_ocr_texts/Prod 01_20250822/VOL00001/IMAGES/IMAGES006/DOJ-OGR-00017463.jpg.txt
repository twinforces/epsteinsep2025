1 Q. But that woman is not Jane, is she?
2 A. Correct.
3 Q. And you testified earlier that you often didn't meet the
4 passengers on the flights, you were just given their names
5 sometimes before takeoff; right?
6 A. Correct.
7 Q. So, for all you know, there may have been many other people
8 with that same first name as Jane's first name who traveled on
9 Epstein's planes?
10 A. True.
11 Q. But the bottom line is, you don't know whether Jane was on
12 any of those three flights where there is a passenger listed
13 with Jane's true first name?
14 A. Not the three flights you made reference to. Without the
15 last name, I didn't know which one you were referring to or who
16 it was.
17 Q. Thank you. I want to ask you just about a few more
18 flights.
19 A. Sure.
20 Q. Are you familiar with Prince Andrew, the Duke of York?
21 A. Yes, I am.
22 Q. He is the son of Queen Elizabeth II of England, is he not?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. Did he ever fly on Epstein's planes?
25 A. Yes, he did.
