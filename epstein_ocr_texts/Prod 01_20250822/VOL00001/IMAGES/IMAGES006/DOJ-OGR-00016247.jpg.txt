LCACmax1 A. Farmer â€” direct

1 high school, and we talked a bit about colleges and he asked me
2 where I was considering. I remember he suggested that I should
3 look at UCLA, that that was a place that he liked or had some

4 connection. And then, yeah, just made, you know, made small

5 talk.

6 Q. What, if anything, did Epstein talk to you about in terms

7 of your summer?

8 A. We'd talked about the idea of me going on a trip that

9 summer, something that would help sort of boost my application
10 for college, that would look good. So a lot of people at that
11 time were doing international trips and he said that was
12 something he thought would be a good idea for me to do and he
13 would be willing to help me with that.
14 Q. How did you feel when you first met Epstein?
15 A. I was excited. He was, again, very friendly with me, he
16 seemed down to earth. I had been sort of intimidated by what I
17 heard of him, but he seemed, you know, very nice when I met
18 him. What he said about wanting to helo me was, of course,
19 exciting, reassuring.
