1 To some extent, the government points, I think, to

2 post conspiracy conduct, and that concerns me. And so I would
3 like to ask you to draw my attention to what in the trial

4 record specifically speaks to November and December of 2004.

a) MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

6 As a threshold matter, the government's understanding
7 that the case law is that the question is what is the end date
8 of the conspiracy. In other words, if the conspirators are

9 taking actions periodically over time, the question is what is
10 the last date of the conspiracy? What does the trial evidence
11 establish about the final date? And here the trial evidence

12 was that the conspiracy was ongoing through all of 2004 and

13 into 2005.

14 THE COURT: But to make that point, I think you're

15 relying on post conspiracy evidence.

16 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. We're relying on evidence
17 that exceeds the date in the indictment, but it --

18 THE COURT: It exceeds also the date of Carolyn's 18th
19 birthday. And so it's not just what the indictment charges --
20 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
21 THE COURT: -- but by a conspiracy that is dependent
22 here on Carolyn being under 18 for its continuation. And so
23 that's why I see what you're pointing to as post conspiracy,
24 not only because it goes past what the indictment charged, but
25 because I think legally you're pointing to non-conspiracy
