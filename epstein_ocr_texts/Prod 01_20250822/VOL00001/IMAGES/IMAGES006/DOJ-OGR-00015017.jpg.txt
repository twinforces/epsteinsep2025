government in support of your testimony here today, correct?
A. Partially in support, yes.

Q. And this is by the same folks whe did the 2020 study,
Winters and Jeglic. Right?

A. Yes:

re)

The abstract here == this study was actually giving
professionals a list, undergraduate students a list of
potential grooming behaviors to see if they could identify
grooming behaviors. And there were a total ef 393
undergraduate students who were provided with this information.
Do you recall that?

A. I. don't recall specifically. I recog == I can recall.

This was the article that -- in which -- they did two things.

They developed thé model; which, they later tested. And then
they created a scenario in which they attempted to see whether
or not gré6oming behaviors could bé prédicted.

Q@. Right. And the results of ‘this ‘study were that grooming
béhaviors could not bé prédicted. Correct?

A. Correct.

Q. And this is what é6nded up with thé 2020 attempt to validate
the model, which they're still. working on. Right?

A. SO you're talking about two different concepts. I can't
really answer that, question.

Q. OK. Bottom line, "Nobody could predict grooming out of 364
people" -- "393 undergraduate students." Right?
