Re: United States v, Maxwell, No. 20-c1-330 (S.D.N.Y.)

Dear Judge Engelmayer:

We represent
‘through different counsel; were.

[__] On the late afternoon of Friday, August:1, 1
‘informed by the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOs ” or “the government”) that they are:

réferenced in sonie capacity-in the sealed grand jury materialsthat are the subject of DOF’s
recent. motion for unsealing. See U.S. Mot. 'to Unseal Grand Jury Trs., July 18, 2025, Dkt:.No.
785. requested from:the government.information about the context in
which are named in these materials in order to inform our arguments regarding the.
continued sealing. of the grand jury materials: The government has declined to‘provide us with
any’ information. Absent: such information, we: cannot respond with: specificity to any reference
in,the record concerning Specificity i in this context:may not be. required, however, as
Supreme Court precedent and caselaw-in this Circuit:make clear what ‘this Court:recognized in.its
July 22,.2025 Order—i.e., that there is “long-established policy [of] maintain[ing] the secrecy of
the grand jury. proceedings i in the federal-courts.” United States. v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356
US. 677, 681 (1958): séé also. In re- Grand Sury Investigation of Cuisinarts, Inc.,.665 F.24:24, 28
(2d Cir. 1981) (“This:time-honored policy of secrecy has beén the:most: essential, indeed
indispensable, characteristic of grand jury proceedings.”). Indeed, this.tequirement of secrecy
has been codified:in Federal Rule of:Criminal Procedure 6(e). While the Second Circuit has:
recognized that there are-certain “special circumstances” outside of Rule 6(e)' that may: justify.
the unsealing of grand jury records, the burden of demonstrating those special circumstances. is
even greater than the: already. heavy burden-of demonstrating the. applicability of one of the
exceptions enumerated’in'Rule6(e). See In re Petition of Craig, 131 F.3d 99,106 n.10 (2d'Cir.
1997).

1 The government does.not point:to any of the statutory exceptions enumerated in Rule 6(e) to justify. the need for
disclosure liere,.instead relying solély on “special circumstances” outside-the bouiids of those exceptions as:
atticulated:in In re-Petitiow of Craig, Y31 F:3d:99 (2d'Cir: 1997).. U.S. Mot. to Unseal Grand Jury Trs: at:3,. July‘18;.
2025, Dkt.. No. 785:
