after Carolyn had confided in Maxwell her personal history of having been raped and molested

and by herself touching Carolyn’s breasts when Carolyn was 14 years old. /d. at 90-91. Judge
Nathan also noted that Maxwell had repeatedly deflected blame and lied about her offenses,
including in a civil deposition and to Pretrial Services and the Court. Id. at 95.4

E. Appeal

On February 28, 2023, Maxwell appealed her conviction and sentence. United States v.
Maxwell, No. 22-1426 (2d Cir. Feb. 28, 2023), Dkt. 59. The Second Circuit affirmed. It upheld
Judge Nathan’s (1) holding that a 2007 non-prosecution agreement between Epstein and the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution in this
District; (2) holding that the S2 Indictment had been timely filed; (3) denial of Maxwell’s Rule
33 motion based on juror misconduct; (4) response to a jury note, which Maxwell had argued
resulted in a constructive amendment of or prejudicial variance from the S2 Indictment; and (5)
sentence as procedurally reasonable. United States v. Maxwell, 118 F.4th 256, 270 (2d Cir.
4 Judge Nathan also sentenced Maxwell to a post-imprisonment term of five years’ supervised
release and to pay a $750,000 fine (the maximum allowable).
