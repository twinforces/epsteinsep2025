MS. ‘MOE? Thank you, ‘your Honor.
The second. issue is with respect to the issue of

ean't. see, I think. the Court noted there is an aissue with the

government not being able 'to follow whdt the witness is being

shown.

Our concern in particular is, ‘that in a letter defense

counsel filed, I think. they previewed that they plan to sort of
highlight some portions of the documents or flag certain
pertiens en the screen., That. is very difficult for us to

f6llow without a fhirréred screen. And so because we cannot

mirror the screens because they are open to the gallery, that
is why we proposéd using paper for exhibits like that, and 86
we ask, to proceed that way’.

THE COURT: Here's my thinking: Let's say they show
the paper and then, they say, Okay, paragraph 2, read the first

sentence. If they want té highlight 6r make larger that. first

sentence to ease the reading of it for the witness, if they've
described fully what they're doing on the screen, and I'm
watching it, I thank that's okay and it 1s mot that different.
than doing it. orally and with paper. And I would, of’ course,
allow ‘the same for the government, to the extent. that there are
d6éuméents that you tidy have a witness look at. that cdn't. == if
they can't be projected on the counsel table because it might.
be identifying, I would. permit that as well.
