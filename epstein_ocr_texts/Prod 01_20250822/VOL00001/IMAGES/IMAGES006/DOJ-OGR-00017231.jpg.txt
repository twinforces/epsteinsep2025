Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 210 of 257 3044
LCKVMAX8 Charge

1 herself. Accordingly, you may find Ms. Maxwell guilty of the

2 offenses charged in Counts Two, Four, and Six if you find

3 beyond a reasonable doubt that the government has proven that

4 another person actually committed the offense with which Ms.

5 Maxwell is charged, and that Ms. Maxwell aided, abetted,

6 counseled, commanded, induced, or procured that person to

7 commit the crime.

8 As you can see, the first requirement is that another
9 person has committed the crime charged. Obviously, no one can
10 be convicted of aided and abetting the criminal acts of another
11 if no crime was committed by the other person. But if you find
12 that a crime was committed, then you must consider whether Ms.

13 Maxwell aided or abetted the commission of the crime.
14 To aid or abet another to commit a crime, it is
15 necessary that the government prove that the defendant
16 willfully and knowingly associated herself in some way with the
17 crime committed by the other person, and willfully and
18 knowingly sought by some act to help commit the crime succeed.
19 However, let me caution you that the mere presence of
20 the defendant where a crime is being committed, even coupled
21 with knowledge by the defendant that a crime is being
22 committed, or the mere acquiescence by a defendant in the
23 criminal conduct of others, even with guilty knowledge, is not
24 sufficient to make the defendant guilty under this approach of
25 aiding and abetting. Such a defendant would be guilty under
