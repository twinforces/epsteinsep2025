conspiracy t6 commit a Grime in Counts One and Thrée?

The answer is yes, they can,

DO you have a proposal for how to say that other ‘than,
Just yes? I'm happy to hear it,

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, my proposal 25 to givé ‘them
the limiting instructions that we got before,

THE COURT: The limiting instruction is nonreésponsive
to their question.

MR. EVERDELL: Oné moment, your Honor.

THE COURT: They are mot asking what it may not be
used for. They have a specific question, I think, probably in
light. off the limiting instruction as to whether they may
cénsider it f6r this. And the substantive answer to that. is
yes.

MR. EVERDELL: One moment, your Honor.

(Counsel. conferred)

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, IT think, as you're saying,
to say yes, while technically accurate, allows the jury to then
use her testimony more broadly if they aren't. given the
instruction of how they can use the testimony. So if the
simple answer is yes, then the coricern is that they would usé
it and apply the testimony more broadly. And so I think what.
was given before with the limits ian the limiting instruction i5
how they can use it appropriately in testimony and should be
given again.
