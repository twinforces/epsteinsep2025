1 You essentially want the -- I'ma little with Mr. Rohrbach.

2 I'm not sure why you want the government or if this is a spin

3 to make -- to try to hide what the question is doing, but you

4 want the government to testify, well, we didn't get geo

5 location information because it didn't exist.

6 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I'll be very transparent.

7 I think the point is highlighting the age of the allegations,

8 which I think is a fair point to make to the jury. These are

9 allegations that are 25 years old, and when you make a case on
10 allegations that are more than 25 years old, you're not going
11 to have the same type of corroboration available to you because
12 records get destroyed in that amount of time. The records
13 aren't available that long ago that are available today that
14 you might otherwise expect to to see in a case like this.
15 But the bigger point is just the age of the
16 allegations. So the absence of evidence goes to the fact that
17 these are 25-year-old allegations.
