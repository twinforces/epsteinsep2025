Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 809 _ Filed 08/11/25 Page17 of 31
Each grand jury received evidence on a single day. On that day, it heard testimony from
one person: a law enforcement agent who, acting as a summary witness, testified to information
obtained in the Government’s investigation to support the charges in the proposed indictment.
The agent, responding to tightly structured questions from an Assistant United States Attorney
(“AUSA”), provided highly abbreviated, hearsay accounts of the statements of select witnesses
(e.g., the victims on whom counts in the proposed indictment were based)."4 The agent led the
jury through a PowerPoint of exhibits (e.g., photographs and business records). At the end of the
testimony, the agent testified that he or she had not disclosed all that he or she knew, but had
only responded to the AUSA’s questions. Afterwards, each grand jury voted to return the
proposed indictment.»
‘4 Under federal law, “[i]t is entirely permissible for the government to use hearsay evidence in
its presentation to the grand jury.” United States v. Garcia, 413 F.3d 201, 213 (2d Cir. 2005)
(quoting United States v. Ruggiero, 934 F.2d 440, 447 (2d Cir. 1991)); see also United States v.
Dukagjini, 326 F.3d 45, 54 (2d Cir. 2003) (noting the common “grand jury practice, improper at
trial, of a single agent simply summarizing an investigation by others’).
'S The first Maxwell grand jury met on June 29, 2020. It heard testimony from an FBI special
agent. The agent’s testimony lasted approximately one hour and 25 minutes, spanning 74
double-spaced transcript pages. Two exhibits were put before the grand jury: a PowerPoint
containing slides referred to during the agent’s testimony; and the proposed indictment of
Maxwell. The same grand jury briefly met again on July 8, 2020, for the purpose of returning
the “S1” superseding indictment, which corrected two typographical errors in the indictment.
Compare Dkt. 17, with Dkt. 1. The grand jury did not receive additional evidence.
The second Maxwell grand jury met on March 29, 2021. It heard testimony from a New York
Police Department detective. The detective’s testimony lasted approximately an hour and 48
minutes, not including a brief recess, and spanned 117 double-spaced transcript pages. Nearly
two-thirds of the testimony consisted of reading into the record the special agent’s June 29, 2020
testimony. Six exhibits were put before the grand jury: the transcript of the June 29, 2020 grand
jury testimony; the PowerPoint put before the June 29, 2020 grand jury; a new PowerPoint with
further exhibits; the two earlier indictments of Maxwell; and the proposed “S2” superseding
indictment.
