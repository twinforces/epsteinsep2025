1 allegedly participated in this conspiracy persuaded, induced,

2 or enticed Jane to travel to New York to engage in illegal

3 sexual activity.

4 Your Honor, these words "persuade, induce, entice,"

5 these are words of causation. And I am now quoting from U.S.

6 v. Broxmeyer, 616 F.3d 120 (2d Cir. 2010), and that's at page

7 125. This is a decision that addresses 2251, not 2242, but

8 that statute has the same words "persuade, induce, entice," and
9 it's interpreting in the same way.

10 And Broxmeyer says that these are words of causation,
11 which means they have to bring about an effect. There has to
12 be something done by the defendant to bring about an effect.

13 And in discussing the dictionary definitions, these words are
14 usually given their dictionary definitions, but they do discuss
15 in this opinion what those typically are. And they quote from
16 the Random House Dictionary.

17 "Induce" means, according to the dictionary, to bring
18 about, produce, or cause. "Entice" means to draw on by

19 exciting hope or desire or allure. And "persuade" means to
20 prevail on a person to do something as by advising, urging,
21 etc., to induce to believe or convince.
22 So, again, these are words of causation.
23 Now, the only testimony that we have in the record
24 that relates in any way to Ms. Maxwell taking part in Jane's
25 travel to New York is that Jane testified as to the following
