1 inference, the jury could find that Mr. Glassman's testimony

2 tends to impeach Jane either as to motive to testify or

3 impeachment by contradiction or both. So that is my guidance

4 on the issue of the attorney -- the witness attorney testimony.
a Any questions?

6 MR. ROHRBACH: None from the government, your Honor.

7 MR. PAGLIUCA: I just want to be clear, your Honor.

8 You're precluding testimony from Mr. Scarola and

9 Mr. Edwards.

10 THE COURT: Yes.

11 MR. PAGLIUCA: The only reason I'm asking that

12 question is we can release them and not have them appear.

13 THE COURT: Yes, on the 401/403 grounds.

14 MR. PAGLIUCA: Understood.

15 And that may speed things up a little bit here, since
16 we're releasing a couple of witnesses.

17 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

18 All right. Making progress.

19 There's a government objection to preclude, pursuant
20 to Rule 16, an exhibit that I gather purports to be a sale
2l agreement for the defendant's home in -- house in London at 44
22 Kinnerton Street dated 1996. Does that have a trial mark for
23 identification, that exhibit?
24 MR. EVERDELL: It does now, I believe, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: Okay. Just in time.
