1 ruling. But the ruling is what the ruling is. What's the

2 request?

3 MR. EVERDELL: The request is to eliminate the charge
4 on this point because we couldn't -- we weren't supposed to,

a and nor did -- I think we tried to abide by the Court's ruling

10 MR. ROHRBACH: This is a legally correct instruction.
11 As the Court has ruled many times now in this case, particular
12 investigative techniques are not required. The defense made

15 this is a correct statement of the law on which the jury should
16 be instructed.

18 correct statements on law, your Honor. That doesn't mean that
19 they get into a jury charge.
20 THE COURT: I think I've always included this charge,
21 so it's not just a rarely invoked Sand charge. I mean, as you
22 talked about yesterday, there were questions you were going
23 to â€”- ask.
24 MR. EVERDELL: Special Agent Young.
25 THE COURT: -- Young, thank you -- that either -- some
