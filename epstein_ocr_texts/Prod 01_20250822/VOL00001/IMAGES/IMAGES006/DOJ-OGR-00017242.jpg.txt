LCKCmax9 Charge

1 Ms. Maxwell had such an interest, that is a factor which you

2 may properly consider in determining whether or not she was a

3 member of the conspiracy charged in the indictment.

4 Once a conspiracy is formed, it is presumed to

5 continue until either its objective is accomplished or there is
6 some affirmative act of termination by the members. So too,

7 once a person is found to be a member of a conspiracy, she is

8 presumed to continue as a member in that conspiracy until the

9 conspiracy is terminated unless it's shown by some affirmative
10 proof that the person withdrew and disassociated herself

11 prosecute it.

12 In sum, the defendant, with an understanding of the

13 unlawful nature of the conspiracy, may have intentionally

14 engaged, advised, or assisted in the conspiracy for the purpose
15 of furthering an illegal undertaking. The defendant thereby

16 becomes a knowing and willful participant in the unlawful

17 agreement, that is to say, she becomes a conspirator.

18 Instruction No. 36: Counts One, Three, and Five:

19 Conspiracy to Violate Federal Law â€” Third Element.

25 mere agreement. Some overt step or action must have been taken
