1 MR. EVERDELL: Count Two, "enticement of an individual
2 under the age of 17." And then we would propose "(Jane only),"
3 to add the word "only," your Honor.

4 THE COURT: So adding, after "an individual," "under

a the age of 17," adding in the parentheses, after the word

6 "Jane," "only."

7 MR. EVERDELL: Correct.

8 THE COURT: OK.

9 MR. EVERDELL: Count Three, to transport and then take
10 out the word "a minor," this would be, I guess, "individuals

11 under the age of 17."

12 MR. ROHRBACH: Agreed, your Honor.

13 THE COURT: OK. I will make that change to

14 "individuals under the age of 17," taking out "a minor."

15 MR. EVERDELL: And then Count Four, "transportation of
16 an individual," adding "under the age of 17" and adding the

17 word "only" after "Jane."

18 THE COURT: OK.

19 MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: All right. Make that change, adding
21 "under the age of 17" and then adding "only" after the word
22 "Jane."
23 MR. EVERDELL: Let's just skip over Count Five for a
24 second. Count Six.
Pas THE COURT: "Only."
