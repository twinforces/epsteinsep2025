LCACmax3 A. Farmer â€” cross

1 just a moment, please.

2 If I can just have a moment to confer with defense

3 counsel?

4 THE COURT: Yes.

5 (Pause)

6 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, there is a bit of a

7 disagreement about the redactions, but I don't want to hold up
8 the presentation for the jury. So we can take that up later.

9 THE COURT: Sure.

10 MS. MENNINGER: But I do want to ask the witness a

11 couple of questions. So if I could direct her attention to

12 what we have marked as AFl, and it's going to be page 4 of that
13 exhibit.

14 THE COURT: We have a terminological issue, because

15 that was originally AF1l, but we just admitted the one page as
16 AFL.

17 How about this, we'll go back, I'll admit under seal,
18 again, temporarily, AFl as a seven-page document.

19 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you.
20 THE COURT: Recognizing there is overlap between some
21 of the pages of the AF1l and Government Exhibit 603.
22 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor. We can work
23 that out.
24 THE COURT: Ms. Pomerantz.
25 MS. POMERANTZ: That's fine, your Honor.
