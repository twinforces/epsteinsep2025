counsel ?

disagreement about the redactions, but I don't want to hold up
the presentation for the jury. So we can take that up: later,
THE COURT: Sure.

MS. MENNINGER: But I do want to ask the witness. a
couplé of questions. So if TF could direct her attention to
what we have marked, as AEB1, and it's going to be page 4 of that

exhibit.

THE COURT: We have a, terminological issue, because

that was Originally AF1, but we just admitted the one page as

AF 1...

How about this, we'll go back, I'll admit under séal,
again, temporarily, AFl as a seven-page document,.

MS. MENNINGER: Thank you.

that sut.
