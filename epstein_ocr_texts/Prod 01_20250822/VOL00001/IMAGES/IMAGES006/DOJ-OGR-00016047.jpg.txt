Dear Jeffrey:

It is not difficult to say thank you for your recent gift of
$25,000, or to express our gratitude for your continuing
“generosity (for tax purposes, it should be noted that your

contribution was received by Interlochen Center for the Arts

in support of general operations. Interlochen has not
provided any goods or services to you in exchange for your
gift). But, it is difficult to adequately express our deep
sense of appreciation for all that you have done in
furthering the mission of Interlochen over the past four
years. In addition to your personal and significant annual
contributions, you have opened up and hosted several alumni
meetings and receptions (our New York alumni group is now
one of the strongest in the nation). It all began with our
first meeting at the Villard House. Dr. Tuckerman’s recent
endowed gift in your honor speaks to your support and
commitment to Interlochen.

Last year we built the Epstein Lodge, Interlochen’s first

scholarship lodge in many years. It is our premier guest

accommodation and the first handicapped accessible facility.

Most recently you gave your strong endorsement of

Interlochen to the Ciralsky family as they investigated the

Academy offerings for their daughter, Jessica.

You have done much in the name of Interlochen. We thank

you. If I might borrow from my colleague Dr. Luby, you are

a mensch!

Best wishes for a successful 1995.

Sincerely,

Timothy J. Ambrose

Vice President
