1 which she did.

2 Three, between in or about 2001 and in or about 2004,
3 Epstein's employees sent Carolyn gifts, including lingerie from
4 an address in the Southern District of New York to Carolyn's

5 residence in Florida. For examole, on one occasion, in or

6 about October of 2002, Epstein caused a package to be sent by

7 Federal Express from an address in Manhattan to Carolyn in

8 Florida.

9 Four, on multiple occasions between in or about 2001
10 and in or about 2004, Epstein, Maxwell, or one of Epstein's

11 other employees called Carolyn to schedule an appointment for
12 Carolyn to massage Epstein. For example, in or about April of
13 2004 or May of 2004, another employee of Epstein's called

14 Carolyn to schedule such appointments.

15 In order for government to satisfy this element, it's
16 not necessary for the government to prove that Ms. Maxwell

17 committed the overt act. It is sufficient for the government
18 to show that any of the members of the conspiracy knowingly

19 committed some overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.
20 Further, the overt act need not be one that is alleged
21 in the indictment. Rather, it can be any overt act that is
22 substantially similar to those acts alleged in the indictment,
23 if you are convinced that the act occurred while the conspiracy
24 was still in existence and that it was done in furtherance of
25 the conspiracy as described in the indictment.
