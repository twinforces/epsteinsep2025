and historically significant issue in domestic politics during the 1940s and 1950s, and

Disclosure is being sought in this case due to immense public interest in Jeffrey
Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s cases, along with public interest in the
government’s handling of those investigations and prosecutions. The public interest

nor In re Petition of American Historical Association, support the conclusion that the
Maxwell grand jury materials should be released. Each of those cases involved
testimony dating back at least five decades, along with grand jury testimony relating
to defendants and witnesses who were deceased.
