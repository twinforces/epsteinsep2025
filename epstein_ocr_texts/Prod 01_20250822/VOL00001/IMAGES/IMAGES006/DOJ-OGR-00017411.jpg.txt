LBUVMAX2 Visoski - direct

1 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

2 THE COURT: Okay. And the specific direction to the

3 jury is to pick up the binder now or not yet?

4 MS. COMEY: Pick up the binder now, but don't turn

5 anywhere in the binder yet.

6 THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Everdell, without objection?

7 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine, your Honor.

8 THE COURT: Members of the jury, there's a binder

9 under your seat. Please just pick it up, but don't open it

10 until specifically directed. Thank you.

11 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, also they shouldn't pick up
12 the folder.

13 THE COURT: They should not. There's a folder there
14 as well, and you should not pick up the folder yet, just the

15 binder. Surprises under your seats.

16 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would also ask the witness
17 to please pick up the binder in front of him.

18 THE COURT: Okay. Please do, Mr. Visoski.

19 MS. COMEY: At this time I'd like to ask for the jury
20 and the witness to just turn silently to Government Exhibit 12
2l and take a look at that.
22 THE COURT: We're not going to put these on the
23 screens.
24 MS. COMEY: That's correct, your Honor. All paper
25 copies.
