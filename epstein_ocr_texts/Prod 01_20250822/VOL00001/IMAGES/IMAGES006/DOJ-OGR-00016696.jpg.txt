2 Site is the particular federal inspection site that the person
3 was encountered at.

4 Q. Could you explain that a little more. What do you mean by
a the federal inspection site?

6 A. So on this first page, you have the very first site at the
7 top is Alpha 271. That is the specific terminal at whatever

8 airport that that traveler was encountered. So if I flip to --

10 international terminals. Terminal 4 is Alpha 471. Delta used
11 to be Alpha 473.

12 Q. When we're referring to the sites, are those the sites

13 where the booths or the kiosks are where the immigration

14 officials stamo your passports?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. Going to the right, what else do you see on these columns?
17 A. Then you have type. So that is the type of or more like

18 the way that this information was obtained for each border

19 crossing.
20 Q. And on that, if you look at the first entry --
21 THE COURT: Can't quite hear you there, Mr. Everdell.
22 MR. EVERDELL: sorry.
23 Q. On the column marked type, you see the first entry on the
24 top, it says airline, not API?
