Dear Judges Berman and.Engelmayer:

The Government-writes respectfully to respond to Judge Engelmayer’s Order dated August.
5, 2025, and Judge: Berman’s Order dated August 6, 2025.

In.addition.to: sccking to wnseal the grand jury’ transcripts, ‘the. Government moves to unseal.
the Maxwell and.Epstein grand jury-exhibits subject'to appropriate redactions of victim-related and
other personal identifying information. As there:are’ ‘partics whose names appear in the grand jury
exhibits but did not appcar ‘in the grand jury transcripts, the: Government is. undertaking to. notify.
such parties to the-cxtent their names appear in grand jury. exhibits that were: not publicly admitted.
at the. Maxwell trial (and they were. not already notified, in connection. with. the request to unseal.
the grand. jury transcripts). The Government respectfully requests: to update: the Court following
those notifications. by August 14, 2025, and requests that the: Court. await: that: update before
unscaling any. of the grand jury exhibits, to the extent the Court is otherwise: inclined to-do so.

In. conjunction ‘with this letter, the Government. will submit scaled, ex. purte submissions
clarifying which portions of-the grand jury exhibits in the Maxwell and-/-pstein. matters have been
made public. In. making: this assessment, the Government ‘has compared the: g grand. j Jury. exhibits
complaints identified by the Government that w were c filed by: certain victims, as 15 explained i in further
detail in the Government’s scaled, ex'parie submissions. '

Many civil. complaints: were filed in federal and state courts.on. behalf of victims identified solely
as “Jane, Doc” or by initials that:may or may not be ‘the initials. of the plaintiffs, in those actions,
and therefore:the Government cannot attribute with certainty to whom the statements or allegations
in those anonymized complaints can be: attributed. If the Government. identifies additional.
materials.on. public: dockets that make such attribution possible, it. promptly will ‘notify the Court.
