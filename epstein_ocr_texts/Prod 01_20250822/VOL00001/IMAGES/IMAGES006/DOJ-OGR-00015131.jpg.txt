Re: United States v. Jeffrey Epstein,
19 Cr. 490 (RMB)
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell,
20 Cr. 330 (PAE)
Dear Judges Berman and Engelmayer:

The Government writes respectfully to respond to Judge Engelmayer’s Order dated August
5, 2025, and Judge Berman’s Order dated August 6, 2025.

In addition to seeking to unseal the grand jury transcripts, the Government moves to unseal
the Maxwell and Epstein grand jury exhibits subject to appropriate redactions of victim-related and
other personal identifying information. As there are parties whose names appear in the grand jury
exhibits but did not appear in the grand jury transcripts, the Government is undertaking to notify
such parties to the extent their names appear in grand jury exhibits that were not publicly admitted
at the Maxwell trial (and they were not already notified in connection with the request to unseal
the grand jury transcripts). The Government respectfully requests to update the Court following
those notifications by August 14, 2025, and requests that the Court await that update before
unsealing any of the grand jury exhibits, to the extent the Court is otherwise inclined to do so.

In conjunction with this letter, the Government will submit sealed, ex parte submissions
clarifying which portions of the grand jury exhibits in the Maxwell and Epstein matters have been
made public. In making this assessment, the Government has compared the grand jury exhibits
against the trial record and exhibits in the Maxwell trial, as well as against any publicly filed civil
complaints identified by the Government that were filed by certain victims, as explained in further
detail in the Government’s sealed, ex parte submissions. !

' Many civil complaints were filed in federal and state courts on behalf of victims identified solely

as “Jane Doe” or by initials that may or may not be the initials of the plaintiffs in those actions,

and therefore the Government cannot attribute with certainty to whom the statements or allegations

in those anonymized complaints can be attributed. If the Government identifies additional

materials on public dockets that make such attribution possible, it promptly will notify the Court.
