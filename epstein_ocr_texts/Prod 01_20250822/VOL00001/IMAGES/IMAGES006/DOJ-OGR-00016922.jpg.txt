1 out and we'll end at our normal time.

2 I'm going to let you go for the weekend and the day

3 given where we are in the trial.

4 I want to just take a couple moments to really

iy emphasize how important it is, of course, that you continue to
6 follow all of my instructions. Even though we're at this

7 different phase of the case, no communications with each other
8 or anyone else through any means about the case. No consuming
9 any information about the case through any means. Continue to
10 keep an open mind until you hear the summation -- the closing
11 arguments of the parties, my instructions as to the law, and

12 you begin your deliberations as a jury. It's vitally important
13 that those rules continue to be followed all the way through.
14 I'm very grateful for your patience today and

15 throughout. I wish you a very good and safe weekend. Please
16 be cautious out there. I want to see everybody back here

17 Monday at 9:00. And I hope you have a wonderful weekend.

18 Thank you.
