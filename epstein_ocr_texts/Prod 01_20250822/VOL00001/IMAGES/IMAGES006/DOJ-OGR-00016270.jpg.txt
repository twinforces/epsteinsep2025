LCAVMAX2 A. Farmer â€” direct

1 very, like, playful with each other and kind of grabbing each

2 other. And Maxwell went to, like, pull Epstein's pants down a
3 little bit and, you know, sort of like depantsing someone,

4 which seemed very odd to me at the time because they were

a adults and this is the kind of thing, you know, I would expect
6 more from younger people. And so I was kind of, you know, just
7 caught off guard by it and thought it seemed odd.

8 Q. What movie did you see?

9 A. We saw Primal Fear.

10 Q. How were you, Epstein, and Maxwell seated during the movie?
11 A. Iwas seated next to Epstein, and I believe Maxwell was on
12 his other side.

13 Q. What, if anything, happened during the movie?

14 A. It was very similar to the first time that I went to the

15 movies with Epstein in that he right away began to hold my hand
16 and caress it and, you know -- and rub on my -- on my foot and
17 on my arm.

18 Q. For approximately how much of the movie did Epstein touch
19 you in the way you just described?
20 A. Throughout the majority of the movie. And he also had
21 popcorn, I think, and was, you know, eating. But it was -- he
22 did not -- unlike in New York, he didn't seem to be concerned
23 about hiding those behaviors. He was very blatant in doing it
24 throughout the film.
25 Q. How did what Epstein do in the movie theater in New Mexico
