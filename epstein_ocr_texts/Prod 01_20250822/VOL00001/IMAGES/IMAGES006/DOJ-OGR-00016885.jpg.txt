1 correct?

2 MR. EVERDELL: That's right, your Honor.

3 THE COURT: You didn't see a need to find other

4 witnesses regarding --

S MR. EVERDELL: And the reason why we had to is because
6 that is what we were planning to do all along, to show when she
7 was at that place.

8 However, when we litigated this issue and discussed it
9 yesterday, the Court -- the government raised the deposition

10 transcript from the defendant who said, in sort of an offhand
11 way, if you read the transcript, '92, '93 was when I was there.
12 Then it became an issue of when she was actually residing there
13 as opposed to when she owned it. We thought if the stipulation
14 was going to have to involve that testimony, as well, we then
15 now needed a witness, because the facts we believe to be true
16 was that she was not only -- did not own it until then, she was
17 not there, she did not reside there, she wasn't renting it.

18 There was another couple that was in that house living there

19 until she owned it, purchased it, and then owned it, and then
20 moved in.
21 THE COURT: So really, this is a new -- let me see if
22 I get this right.
23 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, if I can add one more
24 thing. She had another residence in London prior to the
25 Kinnerton Street residence.
