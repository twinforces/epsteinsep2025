a décisié6h net to Gall him.

THE COURT: Okay.

MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, just to clarify, I don't
think that's an accurate representation as to Detective Byrne.

And I, again, would note that the very capable tech
folks were here working and troubleshgoting the issue’. And. L
understand the decision not to Gall Mr. Hamilton was not with
the technological issues, but instead a decision that defense
counsel has made.

MS, STERNHEIM: We could go en all day, Judge, but
suffice it. to say, we're not Calling Mr. Hamilton.

THE COURT: You're not calling Mr. Hamilton and you
havé no additional application regarding being able to call him

remotely with public access at the same time. Your concern is

there would bé a limitatiodn of public access during his

testimony, and for that reason, you've decided. well, that."s
the case, and you've decided not to call Kim.

MS. STERNHEIM: That. is correct. Thank you.

THE COURT: All right. Thank you. Anything else?

MS. CQOMEY: Your Honor, just in terms of ‘timing, there

is oné brief piecé of evidence that we may seek to6 introduce as

rebuttal evidence. I, think it would take 10 minutes, at, most,
t6 gét in. WE just nééed to know whether we sHould have those
witnesses — who are basically custodians — available at the end
of today or if they should be available Monday.
