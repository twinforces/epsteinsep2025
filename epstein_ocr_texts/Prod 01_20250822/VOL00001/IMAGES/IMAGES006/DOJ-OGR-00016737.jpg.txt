1 a decision not to call him.

2 THE COURT: Okay.

3 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, just to clarify, I don't

4 think that's an accurate representation as to Detective Byrne.
S And I, again, would note that the very capable tech

6 folks were here working and troubleshooting the issue. And I

7 understand the decision not to call Mr. Hamilton was not with

8 the technological issues, but instead a decision that defense

9 counsel has made.

10 MS. STERNHEIM: We could go on all day, Judge, but

11 suffice it to say, we're not calling Mr. Hamilton.

12 THE COURT: You're not calling Mr. Hamilton and you

13 have no additional application regarding being able to call him
14 remotely with public access at the same time. Your concern is
15 there would be a limitation of public access during his

16 testimony, and for that reason, you've decided -- well, that's
17 the case, and you've decided not to call him.

18 MS. STERNHEIM: That is correct. Thank you.

19 THE COURT: All right. Thank you. Anything else?
20 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, just in terms of timing, there
al is one brief piece of evidence that we may seek to introduce as
22 rebuttal evidence. I think it would take 10 minutes, at most,
23 to get in. We just need to know whether we should have those
24 witnesses — who are basically custodians — available at the end
25 of today or if they should be available Monday.
