M6s2Max2

1 desire to be law-abiding, which she has exhibited, and to do

2 good. Before the charged offense and for the better part of

3 the past 20 years, she has demonstrated that she is not a

4 danger to anyone. A sentence below the applicable guidelines
5 is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, punishment for
6 Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court should not send her away for the
7 rest of her life.

8 Thank you.

9 THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Sternheim.

10 Ms. Maxwell, you have the right to make a statement.
11 You are not obligated to do so, but if you would like to, you
12 may do so now.

13 THE DEFENDANT: I would, your Honor.

14 MS. STERNHEIM: She would. Where would you like her
15 to -- I'm sorry, Judge. Where would you like her to address
16 the Court?

17 THE COURT: Are the marshals comfortable with the

18 podium?

19 THE MARSHAL: Yes, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: You can go to the podium, Ms. Maxwell.
2l MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you very much.
22 And she may remove her mask?
23 THE COURT: Once you are at the podium, yes, you may
24 remove your mask.
25 THE DEFENDANT: Thank you, your Honor.
