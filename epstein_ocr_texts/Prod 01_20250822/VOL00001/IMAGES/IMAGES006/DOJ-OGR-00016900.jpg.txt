admission that. hé vacated East 69th in or about Jantary "96,

and. then Judge Chin's decision making that finding ‘of fact.

There is one other document from ‘that docket ‘that we

seek to admit, but under a separate rule of evidence,
804(b) (1). There was, actually a deposition transeript from
Mr. Epstein in which he is asked -- and it was taken by the

U.S. Attorney's Office for the Sotithern District of New York.

And. he was asked in that deposition, Is it correct that you

nioved from the premises -- méaning East 69th -- to 9 East 71st
Street. in or around the beginning of '96?

And Mr; Epsteih respénded, Yo6u asked me that. Question
three times, ZL believe it ids around then, but I don"t know
exactly when.

This. deposition excerpt. was appended ‘to a, pleading
that was submitted by the U.S. Attorney's Office in support of
their case at docket number $2. So I, believe that one is
admissible under 804(b) (1), the deposition transcript.

THE COURT: Okay. One at a time, Mr. Rohrbach.

MR. ROHRBACH: Yes; your Honor.

I will go through each of the documents, but just as a
substantive point, this is very much like the 44 Kinnerton

Street issues we've been talking about.

And substantively ==
THE COURT: Microphone.
MR. ROHRBACH: This is very much like the 44 Kinnerton
