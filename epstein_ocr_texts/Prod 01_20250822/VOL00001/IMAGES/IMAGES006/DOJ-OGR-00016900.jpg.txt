1 admission that he vacated East 69th in or about January '96,

2 and then Judge Chin's decision making that finding of fact.

3 There is one other document from that docket that we

4 seek to admit, but under a separate rule of evidence,

5 804(b) (1). There was actually a deposition transcript from

6 Mr. Epstein in which he is asked -- and it was taken by the

7 U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York.

8 And he was asked in that deposition, Is it correct that you

9 moved from the premises -- meaning East 69th -- to 9 East 71st
10 Street in or around the beginning of '96?

11 And Mr. Epstein responded, You asked me that question
12 three times. I believe it is around then, but I don't know

13 exactly when.

14 This deposition excerpt was appended to a pleading

15 that was submitted by the U.S. Attorney's Office in support of
16 their case at docket number 52. So I believe that one is

17 admissible under 804(b) (1), the deposition transcript.

18 THE COURT: Okay. One at a time, Mr. Rohrbach.

19 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor.
20 I will go through each of the documents, but just as a
21 substantive point, this is very much like the 44 Kinnerton
22 Street issues we've been talking about.
23 And substantively --
24 THE COURT: Microphone.
25 MR. ROHRBACH: This is very much like the 44 Kinnerton
