1 tell four different stories, they are four completely different

2 people, and they are going to recount things that they claim

3 happened to them decades and decades ago. They are not going

4 to be able to pinpoint dates; they are going to tell stories

5 that have changed over time and grown over time, stories that

6 they have told for the first time after Epstein died. And

7 Ghislaine has been inserted in those stories as they reframed

8 their stories for a payday.

9 Now, they will come in here and they will point their
10 finger at Ghislaine Maxwell. There is nobody else to point the
11 finger at at this trial. And I ask you to consider, when you
12 hear their testimony, those core themes that I mentioned
13 before: Memory, manipulation, and money.

14 Now, the four women who will come here -- and, as you
15 heard, they are permitted to have pseudonyms or not have their
16 whole names used -- are Jane, Annie, Kate, and Carolyn. They
17 don't have contemporaneous records, they don't have notes of
18 the things they are going to say. Unlike you, as Judge Nathan
19 said, you could keep notes to aid your recollection. They
20 don't have those notes. Instead, they come before you and tell
21 their stories purely from memory.
22 Now, memory, as you will hear, changes. It is not
23 like we take a picture and it is exactly the same as what
24 happened. You are going to hear expert testimony about how
25 memories can be contaminated over time; how false memories can
