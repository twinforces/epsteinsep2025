Epstein Lodge. Apparently it lodged between the wall and
the dresser. It was not discovered until. the unit was moved
for cleaning.

As we discussed, the final week of Camp is August 14 through
the 20th. I have reserved the lodge for Jeffrey's use. In
addition, he has: one more weék that. he can ‘réserve for
Himself or guests He may wish to have use it. Attached is a
list of the dry goods. that. are in. storage as part of
Jeffrey’ s personal inventory. Please advise if we are
missing any items you are awaré of being sent here.

Please convey to Jeffrey how pleased we are to have such a
facility on, our campus. In fact, ‘the President Elect will
be staying in ‘the lodge until his family’s furniture
arrives. It is a remarkable place. We are grateful.

Best. wishes for a wondérful holiday season.
