on January 5, 2022, requesting a hearing; Maxwell then moved for a
new trial under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33. On March 8,
2022, the District Court held a hearing and Juror 50 testified —under
grant of immunity—that his answers to three questions related to
sexual abuse in the jury questionnaire were not accurate but that the
answers were an inadvertent mistake and that his experiences did not
affect his ability to be fair and impartial. Finding Juror 50’s testimony
to be credible, the District Court denied Maxwell’s motion for a new
trial in a written order.

Maxwell was subsequently sentenced to a term of 240 months’
imprisonment to be followed by five years’ supervised release, and the
8 Question 2 asked “[h]ave you, or any of your relatives or close friends, ever been a victim
of a crime?” Question 48 asked “[h]ave you or a friend or family member ever been the
victim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes actual or
attempted sexual assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger,
acquaintance, supervisor, teacher, or family member.)” Finally, Question 49 asked

[have you or a friend or family member ever been accused of sexual harassment,

sexual abuse, or sexual assault? (This includes both formal accusations in a court of

law or informal accusations in a social or work setting of actual or attempted sexual

assault or other unwanted sexual advance, including by a stranger, acquaintance,

supervisor, teacher, or family member.
