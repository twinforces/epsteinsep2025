LCACmax3 A. Farmer â€” cross

1 New York. I apologize if it wasn't clear.

2 A. Okay.

3 Q. You refreshed your memory about the age you were when you

4 took the trip to New York by looking at your journal?

5 A. I don't remember saying that, but that's possible, yes. I
6 mean, I knew it was in my junior year, so I don't think it

7 would have been that hard for me to determine my age, but --

8 MS. MENNINGER: If I could have the witness and

9 counsel look at 3514-006, page 1, third full paragraph about

10 five lines down.

11 Q. If you could just read that bottom half of that paragraph
12 to yourself and tell me if that refreshes your memory about

13 what you told the government in 2019.

14 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection, your Honor.

15 THE COURT: She can look at it.

16 A. I'm sorry. Just read it but to myself, is that what you

17 said?

18 Q. Yes. And do you now recall that, in September of 2019, you
19 had looked at your journal and refreshed your memory about the
20 age you were when you took the trip before you met with the
al government then?
22 A. I think it -- the sentence is a summary. I don't know if
23 that's what it -- that's not my interpretation of it. I see
24 that they wrote a note about that. I think I knew I was 16,
25 but I do know that I refreshed my memory about the experience
