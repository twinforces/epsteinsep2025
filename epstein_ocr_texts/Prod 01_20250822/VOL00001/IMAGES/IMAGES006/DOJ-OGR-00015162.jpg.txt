That admonition requires courts applying the Second Cireuit’s “special circumstances”
exception to grand jury secrecy to invoke it only in rare; “exceptional circumstances,” mindful of
the precedent that unscaling, would set. Jn re Craig, 131 F.3d.at. 103. The exception, afterall,
derives from.a district court’s supervisory authority over grand juries, fd. at 1.02 &(n.2, which
carfics'with it the duty to Safeguard “the traditional, functioning ofthe institution,” United. States
vy. Williams, 504 U:S., 36,5, (1992). Applying. the exception casually or-promiscuously, as the:
Government’s motion to'unscal, the summary-witness grand ‘jury testimony. here invites, would
risk “unravel[ing] the: foundations of:secreey‘upon which-the grand jury is premised,” ./n re
Craig, 131 F.3d at 103, and, croding confidence by. persons called-to testify before “future grand.
juries,” Dotiglas Oil'Co., 441. U.S. at 222, that.the general:rule of secrecy still holds.

This factor weighs heavily against unscaling. Granting.the Government’s motion: would.
bloat the “special circumstances” doctrine, which to date has-warranted disclosure in. only a-tiny
number of: cases, all. involving unique. testimony by firsthand witnesses to events of obvious
because they: are redundant: of the evidence at.Maxwell’s, trial, would be innocuous. Theisame
could be said. for almost any grand jury testimony, by:summary: witnesses or others, given ‘in

support of charges that later proceeded to trial.
