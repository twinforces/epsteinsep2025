1 A. That is correct.
2 Q. In fact, you spoke to Sarah Kellen so often at that point
3 that you had her number on speed dial in your phone; isn't that
4 right?
5 A. Most likely, yes.
6 Q. Do you recall what Sarah Kellen's phone number was?
7 A. I do not.
8 MR. EVERDELL: Let me show you something, see if it
9 refreshes your recollection. I want to call up 3527-001, we'll
10 go to the third page. That is just for the Court, the deputy,
11 and the witness, please.
12 MR. EVERDELL: May I proceed, your Honor?
13 THE COURT: Yes.
14 MS. COMEY: Thank you.
15 Q. Mr. Visoski, do you have that document in front of you?
16 A. Yes, I do.
17 Q. Do you see just sort of maybe a third of the way down from
18 the top of the page, there is an entry there. Does that
19 refresh your recollection on what Sarah Kellen's phone number
20 was?
21 A. Her number wasn't embranded in my mind as a memory, but the
22 number does come back to me as being Sarah Kellen's cellphone
23 number.
24 QO. So the number, was it 917-855-3363?
25 A. That's correct, yes.
