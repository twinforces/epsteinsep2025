‘time, I:really think John and I could have a tespectable draft in. one'to. two:
days’but getting uninterrupted time is nearly impossible!

John told me last'week that he feels he.is doing ‘a:much better job and is
focusing on. details. I don't plan to speak-to him until aftér you leave but.
I'm sure he'll say he:is distracted with the loss.of his father in. law.
Obviously we don't want an attitude while you're in residence!

I'd. like to. discuss this, with. you and hear how: the interviews go.. Remember,
‘we also have 6-8 resumes ‘from the NY aréa which I'll follow up on.

Jerome does power'wash the pool. deck. One thing.I did notice... Jerome was:

working on the staff house. John said Alan has a. contract:with Frank Steele
and Jerome. was not:on,our time. Iasked.John to make-sure'we're getting our,
hours...

Please call.anytime if you want:me:to take any immediate:action.or it you'd
like to discuss this.:

Regards,
Sally

Sally just: received the zorro stutf thanks
l am.sending ‘you this not for’you deal ‘w/it'this w/e but for next, week

I need'to know-what if any list John is using:and heneeds to understand
that:he is doing a truly awful, job.

1. There was no drinking, water in'the black: Mere

2. There were'no pens in’ the black Mere:

3. The bulb on JE-desk'ws burnt out when we arrived.

4. The pool. deck was'so filthy JE had to ask him:to pressuté-wash it. Is

this not the gardeners job and if so why does John not’have it done

5. Even thought John sd that he changed the colour card in, the computer, -
having done’ it could he! not see! that. it was exactly: the same.as before ie.

no different.and that obviously JE would not be happy w/it?

6.The:imassage créains etc in JE’s bathroom. weré:a mess. no one had tidied-up
and arranged ‘them So it. was neat ;

lam.at.a.loss. Plse for a long as we have ‘to work w/him there has to be a
list'='you need to figure. out how’to, make sure he is doing it.

How. are we doing w/the: PB manual - where ‘do we stand:w/it?
