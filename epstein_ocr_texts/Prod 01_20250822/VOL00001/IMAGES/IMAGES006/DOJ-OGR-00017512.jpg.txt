LBUVMAX4 Visoski - cross
1 A. Yes, she did fly the helicopter.
2 Q. You accompanied her on those flights as the more
3 experienced pilot?
4 A. Yeah, I was going to go in that direction, but yes, I
5 accompanied her as a safety pilot. We flew together.
6 Q. And to your knowledge, that was Epstein's helicopter, not
7 Ghislaine's helicopter, right?
8 A. That's correct.
9 Q. So Ghislaine couldn't call you up and say, I want to fly
10 the helicopter. Have it ready for me. Right?
11 A. She might have; but, no, that wasn't the normal situation.
12 We always had a mission to go on, and it was probably
13 Mr. Epstein driven. But to my knowledge, it was Mr. Epstein's
14 helicopter, yes.
15 Q. To your knowledge, it was Mr. Epstein who controlled
16 whether or not the helicopter was flown or not?
17 A. Correct. Yes.
18 Q. Okay. Now, you said that when Ghislaine did fly the
19 helicopter, you would fly with her as the more experienced
20 pilot?
al A. Yes.
22 Q. And you got to know her a little bit from that too, from
23 your shared enjoyment of piloting helicopters, right?
24 A. Yes, we talked a lot about aviation.
25 Q. And you remember her as a nice person, right?
