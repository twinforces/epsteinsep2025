LBTVMAX3 Opening - Ms. Sternheim
the wittnessés, on the Stand will not é6stablish beyond a
reasonable doubt any of those’ six charges.

Now, agé Of consént 1S anh important factor that you
will focus ‘on, And you will learn that in. New York, the age of
consent 15 17 years Old. You will léarn that ‘there are
witnesses, the accusers, some that never traveled to New York
and, some that did ‘that were above 'the age of consént. And you

need to listen to their testimony as to where they claim they

were and what dgé ‘they weré when they were thére, because ‘that
ig critically impertant to the charges in this indictment.

And with regard to the trafficking charges, the age 6f
consent is 18. But regardless of what Carolyn's age was at the
time 6f those charges, the evidence will not prove béyond a
reasonable doubt that those charges have been proven.

Now, the government Has pinned its entire case on the

notion, that Ghislaine enabled Epstein's bad, behavior. The

evidence will not. support that. There will bé ho eyéwitnesses,

there may be some secondhand and thirdhand witnesses, there may

be witnesses who said she told mé this, she told me that. They

are not eyewLtnesses. They ane only repeating what was told to
them, and you have to evaluate the credibility of who told them
what,.

What. you will hear are stories that are based on
words, and words alone. There will not be the kind of
corroboration, if amy corroboration, to support the charges.
