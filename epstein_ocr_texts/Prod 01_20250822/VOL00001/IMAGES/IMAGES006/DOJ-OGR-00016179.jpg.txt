LBTVMAX3 Opening —- Ms. Sternheim

1 the witnesses on the stand will not establish beyond a

2 reasonable doubt any of those six charges.

3 Now, age of consent is an important factor that you

4 will focus on. And you will learn that in New York, the age of
5 consent is 17 years old. You will learn that there are

6 witnesses, the accusers, some that never traveled to New York

7 and some that did that were above the age of consent. And you
8 need to listen to their testimony as to where they claim they

9 were and what age they were when they were there, because that
10 is critically important to the charges in this indictment.

11 And with regard to the trafficking charges, the age of
12 consent is 18. But regardless of what Carolyn's age was at the
13 time of those charges, the evidence will not prove beyond a

14 reasonable doubt that those charges have been proven.

15 Now, the government has pinned its entire case on the
16 notion that Ghislaine enabled Epstein's bad behavior. The

17 evidence will not support that. There will be no eyewitnesses,
18 there may be some secondhand and thirdhand witnesses, there may
19 be witnesses who said she told me this, she told me that. They
20 are not eyewitnesses. They are only repeating what was told to
21 them, and you have to evaluate the credibility of who told them
22 what.
23 What you will hear are stories that are based on
24 words, and words alone. There will not be the kind of
25 corroboration, if any corroboration, to support the charges.
