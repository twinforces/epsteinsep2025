Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 765. Filed 08/10/22 Page 70 of 95 2808
LG IAMAX2ps
defendant traveling with somé of the minor Victims. 1 assume
the defendant is going to say that she didn't know the purposes
of the trips. To 'the extent the purpose was Séxual abuse, the
gevernment, would argue that at a minimum this she did know, if
she didn't. She cons@iously avoidéd knowing, why Jeffrey Epstein
was traveling repeatedly with these minors.
THE COURT: The other point is, from the openings, T
doen't know if it will be a theme of the closing, but the
distancing of MS. Maxwell from Mr. Epstein and what he did was
clearly a theme of the opening, and, so that implicates
knowledge throughéut the Gounts.

SQ my strong inclination is that. it's appropriate

heres That's my Gonclusi6n. That's my Conclusion. I'm going
to. look back through relevant. portions of ‘testimony on, the age

issue, but I think even the age issue == well, not the age

issue. Knowledge of age. Specific arguments as to knowledge
of agé aside, knowledge of agé is intertwined with arguments
regarding age. And, in, any event, there are, as a mesult of the
opening, questions abdut MS. Maxwell's kndéwledge of what
Mr. Epstein is alleged to have been doing that I think it's
s6rt. 6f a standard instance of the applicability of a conscious
avoidance instruction.

So my conclusion is to include it.

MR. EVERDELL: Next; your Honor -- ‘let me make sune.
