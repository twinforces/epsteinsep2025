ORDER
GHISLAINE MAXWELL,
| Defendant.
PAUL A. ENGELMAYER, District Judge:
This order sets a deadline for the Governmentâ€™s outstanding filings in connection with its
pending motion to unseal certain grand jury materials in this case. Dkt. 785.
On July 29, 2025, the Government, in its memorandum of law in support of that motion,
sought leave to file a supplemental submission responding to submissions from victims, which
are due today, August 5, 2025. Dkt. 796 at 2. And, on August 4, 2025, the Government filed a |
letter stating that, although thus far it has moved to unseal only the grand jury transcripts in this ;
case, it is considering whether also to seek unsealing of the grand jury exhibits, and sought leave |
to notify the Court by August 8, 2025, of its position on that point. Dkt. 800 at 2-3. 2
The Court grants these requests for leave to file supplemental submission(s) addressing ,
these points. It sets a deadline of Friday, August 8, 2025 for the Government to file:
1. Its response, if any, to any letters submitted by or on behalf of victims, and/or to any
submission by defendant Maxwell (which is also due today); and
2. Its statement as to whether its motion to unseal (with appropriate redactions) covers
the grand jury exhibits (or merely the grand jury transcripts).
