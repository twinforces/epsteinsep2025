contemplates a broader restriction.”" And while Maxwell contends
that we cannot apply Annabi to an agreement negotiated and executed
outside of this Circuit, we have previously done just that.’* Applying
Annabi, we conclude that the NPA did not bar Maxwell’s prosecution
by USAO-SDNY. There is nothing in the NPA that affirmatively shows
that the NPA was intended to bind multiple districts. Instead, where
the NPA is not silent, the agreement’s scope is expressly limited to the
Southern District of Florida. The NPA makes clear that if Epstein
fulfilled his obligations, he would no longer face charges in that district:

After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the

Agreement, no prosecution for the offenses set out on pages 1

and 2 of this Agreement, nor any other offenses that have been

the subject of the joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of

Investigation and the United States Attorney's Office, nor any
" United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985). We recognize that circuits have
been split on this issue for decades. See United States v. Harvey, 791 F.2d 294, 303 (4th Cir.
1986); United States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 540, 550 (3d Cir. 2002).
2 See, e.g., United States v. Prisco, 391 F. App’x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010) (summary order)
(applying Annabi to plea agreement entered into in the District of New Jersey); United States
v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004) (summary order) (same, to agreement entered
into in the District of New Mexico). Nor does Annabi, as Maxwell contends, apply only
where subsequent charges are “sufficiently distinct” from charges covered by an earlier
agreement. In Annabi, this Court rejected an interpretation of a prior plea agreement that
rested on the Double Jeopardy Clause, reasoning that even if the Double Jeopardy Clause
applied, the subsequent charges were “sufficiently distinct” and therefore fell outside the
Clause’s protections. Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. This Court did not, however, conclude that the
rule of construction it announced depended on the similarities between earlier and
subsequent charges.
