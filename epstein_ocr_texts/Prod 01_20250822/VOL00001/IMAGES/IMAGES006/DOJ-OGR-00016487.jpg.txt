1 that any of these witnesses will testify to relevant

2 nonprivileged information that is not outweighed by prejudice,
3 it's possible to get such testimony.

4 After careful consideration, with one exception, the

5 information the defense seeks to elicit from the three

6 attorneys, I conclude, is either not relevant under Rule 401,

7 is duplicative of information elicited on cross-examination

8 and, therefore, outweighed by prejudice, or is only potentially
9 marginally relevant to the limited inference of impeachment so
10 as to be outweighed by 403 prejudice.

11 The one question I intend to permit is the one I

12 suggested the parties stipulate to testimony from Mr. Glassman.
13 I will permit Mr. Glassman to be asked the following: Did you
14 tell the government that you told Jane that cooperating with

15 the government and testifying in this case would help her civil
16 case against Epstein's estate and Ms. Maxwell and/or her claim
17 to the victims' compensation fund?

18 The question does not elicit privileged information

19 directly because it seeks only to know what Mr. Glassman told
20 the government. Unlike the other proffers, this testimony is
21 relevant because Mr. Glassman's testimony, if the answer is
22 yes, could contradict Jane's testimony and allow an inference
23 to the jury that at least at one point she may have been under
24 the impression that testifying would help her civil case
25 against Ms. Maxwell and her claim to the fund. With this
