LBAGma x4 Rocchie - Cress

conclusion of the study, no.

Q. Well, are you just saying you ignore the conclusion of the
author who did this study because you don't agree with it?

A. I"m not saying this is the conclusion. The purpose of the
study -- a conclusion generally refers to the concluding
comments summarizing the main findings of the study. So this
is actually not part of her -- their conclusion. It's part of
their rationale for why this particular piece of research is
important and needed in the field.

Q. So let's go through the methodology of this particular
study as well.

THE COURT: We'll take about a 20-minute, 30-minuté
break for lunch. It's 12:55, I think we probably need 30
minutés, just logistically, $6 we'll resume at, 1:25.

I do want. to encourage you, Mr. Pagliuca, to focus
your cross less on what you might do in front of a jury --
because you. are ably demonstrating to me so far that the points
you madé in your papers are Ccross-examination points -- so to
the extent there are any of the opinions you want to focus. on
the undérlying Daubert, quéstions -- and you did a littlé bit at
the end here -- the time would be much more effectively used..

MR. PAGLIUCA: Undérstood, your Honor.

THE COURT: Thank you. We'll resume in 30 minutes.
