testimony of mayoral candidate’ exposing as false his representation. to the public.that he had.
answered all questions before grand jury). And the Government's stated:rationale for its motion
bears no resemblance:to any “grounds that justify disclosure under the existing exceptions listed
in, Rule 6(¢).” Ja re Craig, 131 F:3d_at:106.

In arguing that this factor favors disclosure, the Government makes broad proclamations
Mem. at: 5\(“Many. questions remain ‘unanswered, and the public’s, interest: remains.” (quoting Jn:
re-AHA, 49 F. Supp. 2d.at.294)). That interest is undeniable. .But the Government has failed to
connect if tothe materials at-issuc, which would not.answer any of the public’s questions.

This factor decisively weighs against unsealing.

4, What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure

“The specificity of the data sought is significant.in at least two ways.” Jn re Craig, 1321
F.3d at 106.

First, there are obvious differences between. releasing ‘one witness’ [s] testimony,

the full transcript, ormerely the minutes ofthe proceeding. And, sccond, it is.highly

relevant'whether the disclosure is general.or limited to a specified numberof people.
under special. cireumstanecs.

Id. at. 106-107 (citation,omitted),

Here, the:'Government docs ‘not. seck. tailored disclosure of discrete items within a grand
jury record.. Nor does it seck: leave to disseminate. grand jury materials:to a specified audience..
It secks. disclosure to the public at.large of the entire proceedings before the Maxwell. grand-jury,
subject.only to: redactions aimed. at. protécting-privacy.

This factor weighs against unscaling. The Government has identified:no information of
consequence'within the grand jury record that is not:alreadypublic. And, under: /n ‘re Craig, the

blanket quality of the motion to. nseal weighs against unscaling.
