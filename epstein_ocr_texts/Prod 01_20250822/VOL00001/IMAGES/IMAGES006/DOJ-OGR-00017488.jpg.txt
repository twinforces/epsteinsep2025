7 said; right?

16 Q. And did you install the sort of home theater or any audio
17 equipment in the rental residence?

18 A. I don't recall installing in the rental residence, no.

19 Q. Do you recall where the rental residence was located in
20 Palm Beach?
21 A. I don't know the address. I know approximately where it
22 was, but I don't remember the address.
23 Q. Do you recall when the renovation took place?
24 A. I donot. I'd only be guessing if I said the mid 1990s,
