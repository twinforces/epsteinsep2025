The government seeks to unseal the grand jury transcripts, citing “historical
interest” without regard for how that release will affect Maxwell’s privacy interests,

secret conduct at a grand jury hearing cannot eclipse the right the defendant has to
secrecy and overwhelm his objection to public discourse.” 131 F.3d 99, 105 (2d Cir.
1997).

Because this is ongoing litigation in a criminal case involving a living
defendant with existing legal remedies, the government’s motion should be denied.

exceptions, however, and Rule 6(e)(8) lists several exceptions. The Second Circuit
has additionally recognized that there are certain “special circumstances” in which
