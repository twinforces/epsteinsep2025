L€KCmax.7 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey

experiences differently over time. They mixed up details,
couldn't remember exactly when. certain things. took. place. But

Hf you, think about your own lives, and 'your own, mémoriés, you

will see that difficulty remembering certain things doesn't

mean that they didn"t Happen, doesn't mean that you don't

remember the core. Jane and Carolyn were’ both abused many,

Marry times over a period of years. The abusé became routine,

the same sickening precess each time, these were recurring
events.
Now imagine you were asked to recall a recurring event

from years ago in your own lives. Say something like a

holiday, like Thanksgiving. There js a routine you follow each

year, ‘the samé food, the same people attend. That event stands

out in, your mind because it's significant, it's a holiday, but

you woén't. necéssarily remember the specific dinher Coriversation

you had, each year. You're sure you had, turkey because that

happened évery time, but sone details are just hot going to

stand out to you because essentially the same thing happens
every year.

Now what. might stand out. is when a routine gets
broken. Say one year a néighbor Game over to join whd was
unexpected or you switched up salt and sugar and a pile got
totally ruined. You'll remember that. different thing, but you
might, not, be able to remember which Thanksgiving that, thing
happened. Did the neighbor come when I was 14, or 15, or 16?
