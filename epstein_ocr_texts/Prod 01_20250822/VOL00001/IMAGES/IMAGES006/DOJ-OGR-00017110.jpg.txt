LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 Epstein's house. She told you it was other people in Epstein's
2 office. And Ghislaine didn't encourage Jane to travel with

3 Epstein. You heard not one single word out of Jane's mouth

4 that Ghislaine encouraged or enticed her to travel anywhere.

5 The government's biggest promise that they repeated to
6 you over and over again with respect to Jane is that she was,

7 quote, sometimes in the room when it happened. But when Jane

8 got on the stand, she admitted, finally, that what she told the
9 government several times is she wasn't sure and had no

10 recollection that Ghislaine was ever in the room when Epstein
11 abused her. She said it in February 2020, and what she said on
12 the stand in front of you is, as you sit here today, you're not
13 sure whether you were ever in the room alone with Ghislaine and
14 Epstein, correct, and she said, no.

15 The government also promised you an array of

16 witnesses, another promise they broke. They said these

17 witnesses would back up the accusers' claims. They told you,
18 for example, that there were relatives from the victims that

19 you would hear from, and that those relatives would tell you
20 about the victims spending time with the defendant and Epstein
21 and traveling with them and receiving phone calls from them all
22 when they were between the ages of 14 and 17.
23 Let's break that down.
24 What relatives came to tell you about Jane spending
25 time with the defendant and Epstein? What relative was that?
