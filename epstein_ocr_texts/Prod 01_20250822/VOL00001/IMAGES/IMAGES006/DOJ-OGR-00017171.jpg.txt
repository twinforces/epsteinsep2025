LCKCmax7 Summation â€” Ms. Menninger

1

2 MS. MENNINGER: And Count Six only relates to Carolyn.
3 So if you don't believe Carolyn or if you have a reasonable

4 doubt about Carolyn adding Ghislaine to the story, you just

S acquit her on that charge, as well.

6 And there are numerous reasons why you should have

7 substantial reasonable doubt in this case.

8 But before I get to that, let's talk about conspiracy.
9 Judge Nathan will explain to you that conspiracy is an
10 agreement to accomplish something unlawful, and the

11 government's theory is that Epstein and Maxwell agreed that

12 they would encourage or arrange for females under the age of 17
13 to travel to New York to engage in sex acts with Epstein, and
14 New York law provides that an adult of someone under 17 cannot
15 legally consent to have sexual contact.

16 So, what did Annie Farmer and Kate and Carolyn have to
17 do with that violation of New York law? Nothing. Carolyn

18 never went to New York. She never traveled anywhere. Any

19 suggestion that she was asked to travel was something she added
20 in the last year after her first lawsuits were over and her
al money was gone and she was adding Ghislaine Maxwell to the
22 case.
23 Annie came to New York through no involvement of
24 Ghislaine Maxwell. As she told you, quite clearly on the stand
25 and after she went to New Mexico, nobody asked her to travel
