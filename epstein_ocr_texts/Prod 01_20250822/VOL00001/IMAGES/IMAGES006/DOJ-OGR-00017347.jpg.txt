1 (Jury present)

2 THE COURT: Members of the jury, I did receive your

3 note indicating that you would like to end today at 5:00 p.m.

4 and continue tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. I will send you home at the
5 time you've requested. We'll start again tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.
6 Of course, all rules continue to apply. Please

7 continue to take all precautions regarding the highly

8 contagious omicron variant. We need each of you here and

9 healthy. So please, wear high quality masks and take all

10 available precautions. As I've indicated before, we have masks
11 for you. If anyone wishes to have transportation provided that
12 hasn't taken us up on that offer, please let Ms. Williams know.
13 Relatedly, the main courthouse administrator has asked
14 me to remind you of the COVID protocols. You must remain

15 masked in KN95 or N95 masks at all times, except when briefly
16 eating or drinking. You must maintain distance in the jury

17 room during deliberations as indicated in the seat placements
18 and markings. If you do break briefly for lunch, please use

19 the additional seating to gain even further distancing while
20 your masks are briefly off.
21 As to the schedule going forward, we are going to
22 continue with the same schedule as of today, if needed, 9:00
23 a.m. to at least 6:00 p.m. Please let me know by note if you
24 agree to stay longer any day.
25 However, I am going to ask that deliberations continue
