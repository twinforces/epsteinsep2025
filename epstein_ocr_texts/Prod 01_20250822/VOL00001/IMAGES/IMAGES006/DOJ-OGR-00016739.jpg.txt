1 here today?

2 MR. EVERDELL: Because they're coming from the U.K.

3 and they can't be here until Monday.

4 THE COURT: Who is it and how long?

5 MR. EVERDELL: How long is the witness going to be?

6 It would be a very short witness. And this is related to the

7 Kinnerton Street property. I think just today we got a

8 declaration from him, which I can hand over to the government.
9 They got this signed this morning about what his testimony

10 would be. And I could provide it to the Court, as well.

11 I would like it in front of me, but I could generally
12 summarize, don't quote me on this, but he is the owner of the
13 Nags Head Pub, which is right across the street from the

14 Kinnerton Street residence. He owned that for the whole time
15 that's relevant here. He knew the previous owners. He always
16 saw them there. And he met Ghislaine Maxwell when she took

17 ownership of the property, and he knew the prior owners to be
18 living there, and then he knew Ghislaine to be living there

19 when she bought the property. And he goes there every day. He
20 owned the pub, he had a flat above the pub that looked across
21 to the Kinnerton Street property, and he can verify the fact
22 that she didn't take occupancy until after she purchased the
23 apartment.
24 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would just note that the
25 defense has had an extraordinary amount of time to prepare its
