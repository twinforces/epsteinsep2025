LCKCmax7 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 importance to my client, Ghislaine Maxwell, that hesitation is
2 reasonable doubt.

3 As we have said from the beginning, Ghislaine Maxwell
4 is not Jeffrey Epstein. She's being tried here for being with
a Jeffrey Epstein. Maybe that was the biggest mistake of her

6 life, but it was not a crime.

7 Please only consider the evidence against her, don't

8 be fooled by the government's smoke in mirrors and big fancy

9 houses and bank accounts. What was the evidence that pertains
10 to her? The evidence on the law, the burden of proof, justice,
11 demand that you acquit Ghislaine Maxwell of every single count
12 with which she is charged.

13 Thank you for your time.

14 THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Menninger.

15 Members of the jury, we'll take our short break now,
16 and bearing in mind all my instructions, which continue to

17 apply. When we return, we'll have rebuttal by the government
18 and then I'll give you my charge. Enjoy your break.
