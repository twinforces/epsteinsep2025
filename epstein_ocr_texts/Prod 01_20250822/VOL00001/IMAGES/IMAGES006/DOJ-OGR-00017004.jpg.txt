1 objected to.

2 So here's just a slight change. Line 4. "Each party
3 had an opportunity to call any of these witnesses."

4 MR. EVERDELL: We would accept that, your Honor.

5 THE COURT: It's a similar meaning. It's not quite

6 equal. I'll adopt that. "Each party had an opportunity to

7 call any of the witnesses."

8 MR. ROHRBACH: If your Honor is thinking of that

10 THE COURT: That's fine. So the proposal would be

11 that, line 1, cut "equally available to both sides" from the
12 heading, and then, line 4, cut "equal opportunity or lack of
13 opportunity” and change to "an opportunity."

14 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.

15 THE COURT: I think it's clearly true, Mr. Rohrbach,
16 this is standard language, and I've given it a slightly,

17 slightly altered meaning, to take emphasis off of "equal

18 opportunity." So I think it still captures the meaning of the
19 charge.
20 MR. ROHRBACH: I just -—- we will think about it and
21 include it in our letter. But just to preview for the Court,
22 part of our concern is that the most obvious witness who was
23 available to both sides and who we expect the defense to
24 comment on is Virginia Roberts, who was described as a victim
25 but did not testify and she was fully available to the
