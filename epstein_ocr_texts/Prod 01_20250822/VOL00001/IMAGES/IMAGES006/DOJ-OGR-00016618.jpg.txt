LCGCmax4 Loftus â€” direct

1 the problem is when you have post-event suggestion or

2 intervention, people get very confident about their wrong

3 answers, and you can see that even wrong answers or false

4 information, false memories can be expressed with a high degree
5 of confidence.

6 Q. In connection with your experience and research, have you

7 ever come across the term, rich false memories?

8 A. Yes.

9 Q. Could you please explain to the jury what that means.

10 A. So going back, actually, to the typical eyewitness study,
11 witnesses see an accident, they really saw the car go through a
12 stop sign. Later on, you suggest it was a yield sign and many
13 people will succumb to the suggestion. You have changed a

14 detail in memory for an event that actually happened.

15 But somewhere around the 1990s, researchers from

16 around the world started to look at, could you plant an entire
17 event into the minds of people for something that didn't

18 happen, could you use enough suggestion that you would get

19 people to construct whole events, and we and others have
20 accomplished that, meaning other scientific laboratories,
al planting false memories that -- well, as I mentioned, you
22 witnessed your parents have a physically violent fight or you
23 were attacked by a vicious animal, or you had a serious indoor
24 or outdoor accident, or you nearly drowned and had to be
25 rescued by a lifeguard, or you committed a crime as a teenager
