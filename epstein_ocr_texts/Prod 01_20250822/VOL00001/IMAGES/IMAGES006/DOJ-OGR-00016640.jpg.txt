1 form of post-event information can be intentional or

2 inadvertent; correct?

i) A. Correct. Of course, in my studies or the studies of other
4 scientists, we do it deliberately in order to study what

5 happens, what changes it leads to. But out there in the real

6 world, it doesn't necessarily happen deliberately that people

7 are deliberately trying to mislead other people. It can happen
8 inadvertently.

9 Q. Have you conducted any research or are you aware of any

10 research that has indicated that secondary gain or motive may
11 impact the retelling of an event?

12 A. Well, there is some work on motivated false memories.

13 People do seem to be more willing to accept suggestions when

14 it's going to fit with their -- with their prior beliefs or fit
15 with some motives. I'm not sure I know any specific study that
16 sort of shows if people are offered money for a particular

17 memory, that they are more likely to give it to you, but it

18 certainly seems plausible.

19 Q. In any of the studies that you've conducted, has there been
20 an analysis of who provides the post-event information, meaning
21 someone who you trust as opposed to someone you don't trust?
22 A. Yes. There are several studies that are in the literature
23 on the source of the post-event information. And just in
24 brief, what people find is -- what researchers find is that
25 people are more likely to accept suggestive post-event
