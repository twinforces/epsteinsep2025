1 deliberate, it is your duty not to discuss this case with

2 anyone and not to remain in the presence of other persons who

3 may be discussing this case. And this includes discussions

4 even with members of your own family and your friends. In this
S regard, please understand that the parties and the counsel in

6 this case have been instructed by me to have no contact with

7 any of you, not even to offer a friendly greeting. So if you

8 happen to see any of them outside this courtroom and they don't
9 acknowledge you, say hello, or make small talk, please do not
10 take offense. They are not being rude; they are following my
11 instructions.

12 That concludes my preliminary instructions to you.

13 We will begin after lunch with the initial stage of

14 the case, which, as I said to you, is opening statements, and
15 we'll begin when you return from lunch with the government.

16 Let me just note, as I've said in the beginning of

17 jury selection, we are in an outfitted courtroom for COVID

18 times. The witness will testify -- witnesses will testify in
19 this Plexiglas box that has a HEPA filter, and they will remove
20 their mask to testify when we have witnesses testify. The
2l lawyer who will be questioning them and the lawyer during
22 opening statements, for example, will be in that Plexiglas box
23 which also has a HEPA filter, and they'll be permitted to
24 remove their mask while they provide opening statements as
25 well.
