MS. MOE: Post indictment conduct, your Honor.

THE GOURT: Post. indictmént. Is it in s6me way not

something 'you'me pointing to for your statement, the post. 2005
which consists of conspiratorial conduct?

MS. MOE: I think, separate from the 2005 evidence, we

would point t6é in the fall of 2004, a message from Carolyn in
November of 2004 showing that, she was contacting the house to

make a scheduled appointment.
