1 of the red house to impeach the testimony that she lives ina

2 blue house, you show it to the government before or no?

3 MS. MENNINGER: I did just show it to the government.
4 THE COURT: Before the beginning of the day?

S MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I believe it's impeachment
6 and it comes in when it comes in. I did not believe that your
7 Honor ordered us to produce impeachment materials prior to

8 trial.

9 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think we may need to brief
10 this tonight.

11 THE COURT: You'll brief it. You'll brief it. A

12 specific example would be helpful. I suppose you can use this
13 one complicated by the fact that my understanding of the

14 testimony was that she was -â€”- she said that's the street I

15 lived on, reading a document that she had never seen before,

16 from a photograph taken in 2021.

17 So I suppose the question is, perhaps you could pick
18 another example, or you could imagine that photograph without
19 the information --
20 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, if I had a photograph from
21 that time period, I certainly would have used it. That's the
22 only thing available to me.
23 I would say, your Honor, that the government has just
24 introduced, today, photographs that were taken in the last year
25 of Epstein home when we're talking about events that happened
