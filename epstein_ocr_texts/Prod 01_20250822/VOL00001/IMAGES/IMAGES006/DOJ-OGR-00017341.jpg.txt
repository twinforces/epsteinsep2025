1 activity that occurred in New Mexico, that wouldn't be a

2 sufficient basis to convict on Count Four or Count Two because
i) it requires an intent to violate New York law, and you can't

4 violate this section of New York law in New Mexico.

5 So if that's all they're considered on a basis to

6 convict on Count Four and Count Two, then that would be

7 insufficient and improper, and that's why I think a

8 supplemental instruction that clarifies that point is warranted
9 in this case, but I understand the Court has rejected that.

10 And that's all.

11 THE COURT: I think the instruction is correct that I
12 referred them to. The reading of the note that you've

13 suggested, I have no idea if that's what the jury is asking or
14 many other plausible readings, and what you've proposed, as you
15 just indicated, would be incorrect. So, I think that's why

16 precisely we sent them back to the charge.

17 Anything else?

18 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.

19 THE COURT: As I said, we'll see where we are at the
20 end of the day, but in light of the variant, my concern about
al interruption of trial, given the increasing daily risk of
22 exposure to either a juror or trial participant requiring
23 quarantine, it is time to think to have the jurors make plans
24 to continue deliberating until a verdict is reached.
25 IT will wait until we hear from the jury, otherwise
