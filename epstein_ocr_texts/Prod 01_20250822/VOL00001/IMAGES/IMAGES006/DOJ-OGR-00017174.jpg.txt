LCKCmax7 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 And what does reasonable doubt mean? I expect the

2 Judge will instruct you reasonable doubt is a doubt based in

3 reason in arising out of the evidence in the case or the lack
4 of evidence. It is a doubt that a reasonable person has after
5 carefully weighing all of the evidence in the case or the lack
6 of evidence. So every witness you didn't hear from, every

7 piece of document that you didn't see, every piece of evidence
8 that you didn't see, you can take that into account and decide
9 whether the government has met their awesome burden. In other
10 words, if you have such a doubt as would reasonably cause a

11 prudent person to hesitate to act in matters of imoortance in
12 his or her own affairs, then you have a reasonable doubt, and
13 in that circumstance, it is your duty to acquit Ms. Maxwell of
14 that charge.

15 What does that mean? It means something different to
16 every person. But what is a matter of importance in your own
17 affairs or someone else's own affairs? Is it whether to get
18 heart surgery? Is it whether to buy a house? What major

19 events in your own affairs do you need highly trustworthy
20 information to make a decision about?
21 And then ask whether the quality of the evidence, the
22 lack of the evidence, the evidence that you did get, the
23 evidence that you didn't get was of such a standard that you
24 would not hesitate to act in a matter of importance to
25 yourself. Would you hesitate to act in a matter of importance
