LCKCmax.7 Summation. - Ms. Menninger

And what does reasonable doubt méan? I expect the
Judge will. instruct you reasonable doubt is a doubt based in
redson in arising out of the ewidence in the casé or tHe lack
of evidence. It is a doubt that a reasonable person has after
carefully ‘weighing all of ‘thé 6vidence in ‘the casé or ‘the lack,

of evidence. So every witness you didn't hear from, every

pléce of doctmént ‘that ‘you. didn't see, every piece of evidence

that you didn't see, you can take that into account and decide

whether the government has met théir awesome burden. In other
words, if you have such a doubt as would reasonably cause’ a
prudént pérson to hesitate to act in matters 6f importance in
his or her own affairs, then you have a reasonable doubt, and
in that circumstance, it is your duty to acquit Ms. Maxwell of
that charge.

What. does that mean? It means sémething different t6
every person. But what is a mattern of importance in your own
affairs or Someone else's own affairs? Is it whether to get
heart. surgery? 2s it whether to buy a house? What major
events in your own affairs do you need highly trustworthy

information to make a decision, about?

And then ask whether the Quality of the evidence, the

lack of the evidence, the evidence that you did, get, the
evidence that you didn't get was 6f such a Standard that. you
would not, hesitate to act, in a matter of importance to
yourself. Would you hesitate to act in a matter of importance
