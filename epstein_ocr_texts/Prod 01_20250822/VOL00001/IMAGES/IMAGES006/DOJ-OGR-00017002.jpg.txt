that! we intendéd to call as a witness.

THE COURT: There was a lawyer letter indicating that
they had received a stibpoeéna arid they intended t6 invoke. I
asked many, many times if there was an. application. with respect
to it. Ti never got one. So I'm not Sure Row 'to think, Of that.
It's certainly true that, if somegne invokes, the defense can't
offer immunity the way that the government Can. That's true in
every case. This charge 1s quite’ standard, though standardly
objected to, but I don't know that I see anything in this. case
that, would distinguish its application, based on what. you've
just indicated.

MR. EVERDELL: In, addition to what I had just
indicated, just f6r purpose of completeness, there aré a number

of witnesses who, based, on, the witness testimony in this case,

there would bé pedple whe the Ggoverhment == who we hormally may
have considered calling as a witness but. who the government
Clearly céuld have charged, criminally, based oh the testimony
we heard. And I won't mame names if, we don't want to do that.
But I think wé probably know who we're talking about Here. And
that. is, you know, had we ‘tried, to call that, witness on those
witnesses, théy undoubtedly would have invoked their Fifth
Amendment. rights. In fact, as some of them -- one of ‘them was
not called by the government and would have had. to have been
given statutory immunity orn granted. immunity to be able to
testify, by the government, if they had. decided. to call them.
