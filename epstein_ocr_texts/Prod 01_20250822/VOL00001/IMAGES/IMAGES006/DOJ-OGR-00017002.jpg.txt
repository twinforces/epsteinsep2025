1 that we intended to call as a witness.

2 THE COURT: There was a lawyer letter indicating that
3 they had received a subpoena and they intended to invoke. I

4 asked many, many times if there was an application with respect
5 to it. I never got one. So I'm not sure how to think of that.
6 It's certainly true that, if someone invokes, the defense can't
7 offer immunity the way that the government can. That's true in
8 every case. This charge is quite standard, though standardly

9 objected to, but I don't know that I see anything in this case
10 that would distinguish its application based on what you've

11 just indicated.

12 MR. EVERDELL: In addition to what I had just

13 indicated, just for purpose of completeness, there are a number
14 of witnesses who, based on the witness testimony in this case,
15 there would be people who the government -- who we normally may
16 have considered calling as a witness but who the government

17 clearly could have charged, criminally, based on the testimony
18 we heard. And I won't name names if we don't want to do that.
19 But I think we probably know who we're talking about here. And
20 that is, you know, had we tried to call that witness or those
21 witnesses, they undoubtedly would have invoked their Fifth
22 Amendment rights. In fact, as some of them -- one of them was
23 not called by the government and would have had to have been
24 given statutory immunity or granted immunity to be able to
25 testify, by the government, if they had decided to call them.
