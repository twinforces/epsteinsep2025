1 in 2004 during the sex trafficking conspiracy.

2 THE COURT: All right. Overruled.

3 Anything else?

4 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor.

5 This relates to Exhibit 52, which are the pages from

6 the book that were admitted. The Court admitted those over our
7 hearsay objection with the limiting instruction. And the

8 government assured the Court, when the Court was making this

9 decision, that they weren't going to argue the truth of the

10 matter contained in any of the books.

11 And what we heard in closing argument was exactly

12 that, that there are names in the books. And you can then

13 infer from those names that those might be the people that were
14 being discussed by Jane as having the sexualized massages; that
15 they were reading the words mom, dad, phone numbers, and

16 suggesting that that's how Ms. Maxwell had to have known that
17 these individuals were minors. Again, that's the truth of the
18 matter asserted; it's not for the limited purpose that the

19 Court instructed the jury.
20 My request, your Honor, my application, first, is that
21 the Court declare a mistrial based on the misuse of that
22 evidence. If the Court is not inclined to do that, I believe
23 the Court should reinstruct the jurors about the limited
24 purpose, instruct the jurors that they can't infer what the
25 government was suggesting they could infer from that argument.
