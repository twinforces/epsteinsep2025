THE COURT: All right. Overruled.

Anything élse?

MR, PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor.

This relates, 'to Exhibit 52, which aré the pages from
the book that were admitted. The Court admitted those over our
hearsay objection with the limiting instruction. And ‘the
gevernment assured the Court, when the Court was making this
decision, ‘that. they weren't going ‘to argue ‘the truth of the
matter contained in any of the books,

And what. we Heard in ¢losing argument was exactly

that, ‘that there ane names in the books. And ‘you can then

infer from those names that those might bé the péedple that were
being discussed by Jane as having ‘the sexualized massages; that
they were, réading the words mom, dad, phone numbers; and
suggesting that that's how Ms. Maxwell had to have known that

Céurt. instructed the jury.

My request, your Honor, my application, first, is that

the Court. should reinstruct the jurors abdéut the limited
purpose, instruct, the jurors that, they can't infer what the
government was suggesting they could infer firom that argument.
