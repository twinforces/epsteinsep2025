1 (Jury present)

2 THE COURT: Thank you, members of the jury. I did get
3 your note that you declined my invitation to deliberate

4 tomorrow. We had assumed trial would be proceeding and I

5 wanted to give you the option to deliberate tomorrow, but

6 understand you have plans.

7 We will resume Monday at 9:00 a.m. Same instructions
8 as previously indicated. As soon as all 12 of you are there,

9 you may deliberate. Before then, please wait until all 12 of
10 you are there.

11 Please stay safe over the long weekend. Obviously

12 we've got the variant and I need all of you here and healthy on
13 Monday. So please take good care and take cautions.

14 Somewhat related to that, the district is going to

15 announce some new protocols on Monday, including specific mask
16 requirements. So the district is going to require everybody to
17 wear either N95s or KN95s or KF94s to be in the courthouse.

18 We'll supply those for you. We'll have supplies on Monday.

19 You're also welcome to take some for the long weekend if you'd
20 like those to help be cautious.
21 It's a long weekend, it's a holiday, it's imperative
22 that you continue to follow my orders regarding the rules in
23 this case as I know that you have, but I have to repeat it.
24 It's critical that you, outside of deliberations, don't discuss
25 this case with each other or anyone else. No consumption of
