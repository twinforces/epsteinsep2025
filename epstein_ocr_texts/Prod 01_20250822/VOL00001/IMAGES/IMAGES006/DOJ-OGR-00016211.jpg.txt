1 THE COURT: All right. Matters to take up, counsel?

2 MS. COMEY: Not from the government, your Honor.

3 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor, unless you want to talk
4 about the cross choreography.

a THE COURT: Sure. That's a good idea.

6 So you will have binders --

7 MR. EVERDELL: Yes.

8 THE COURT: -- that will be placed under the jurors'

9 chairs.

10 MR. EVERDELL: Let me be clear, your Honor. We will
11 have a binder for the witness; although we are going to try to
12 use the electronics, but we'll have a binder just in case for
13 the witness.

14 THE COURT: Right.

15 MR. EVERDELL: And we have manila folders this big,

16 which is two documents in them, each one page, for each of the
17 jurors. And there will come a point where I will ask the

18 jurors to Look at these; but I think, similar to what we did

19 with the government binders, if we can leave them there and
20 instruct the jurors not to look at them. And then when I use
21 them, I will show copies to the government before they open
22 them up to make sure everything is okay. And then we can have
23 them open it up if and when the Court approves that.
24 THE COURT: Okay.
25 And so you'll show the paper copies to the government.
