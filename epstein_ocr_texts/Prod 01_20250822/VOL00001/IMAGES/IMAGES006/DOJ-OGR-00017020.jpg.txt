2 MS. COMEY: That's exactly right, your Honor. And to

6 that?

7 MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor.

10 MS. COMEY: The PowerPoint presentation, your Honor,
11 but --

12 THE COURT: -- the PowerPoint, that does anything

13 other than show admitted evidence or testimony?

14 MS. COMEY: There may be some portions of the charge,
15 once it's finalized. It's possible that there would be text of
16 the final charge on the slides. But I don't think there would
17 be anything beyond that, or excerpts of the transcript from the
18 trial.

19 THE COURT: Right.
20 MR. EVERDELL: Actually on that point I didn't know
21 what the Court's practice was on that, whether the Court allows
22 the final charge excerpts to be used in the closing or whether
23 we do something else.
24 THE COURT: I do allow it.
25 MR. EVERDELL: OK.
