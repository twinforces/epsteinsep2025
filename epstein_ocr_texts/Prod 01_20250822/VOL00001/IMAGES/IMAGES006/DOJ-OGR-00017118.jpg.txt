LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 room together, she was not sure that ever happened and she

2 doesn't recall that now, no. But now, as she sits on the

21 times, and she was homeless. That's not the way it looked to
22 the outside world. She's applying to go to an arts camp with
23 her two brothers every summer for three years. That arts camp
24 costs $4,000 per person, per summer, so $12,000 per year, all
25 three of them go all three years. They don't even apply for
