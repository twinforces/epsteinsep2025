cléarer, your Honor, this notion that shé was, somehow -- Sarah
Kellen. wag an assistant of both Epstein and Maxwell is again
belied by 'the trial record.

If you look at Larry Visoski's testimony, which I
believe iS what the government is, relying on there, he
originally testified, oh, I think she was. an assistant for

both. But On Cross-éxdminattion, hé conceded that He réally

didn't know what her role was, and his best recollection was
that sSHé was an assistant for Epstein.

And again, just look again at Cimberly Espinosa's
testimony who was the actual assistant for Ms; Maxwell, and she
says unequivocally, "I was her assistant. Kellen was Epstein's
assistant." So there is no fair inference that MS. Maxwell was

supervising Sarah Kellen. The inference is exactly the

opposite, and it Gah't provide a basis for that leadérship
enhancement.

THE GOURT: All right. Anything further oh the
enhancements for the government's objection?

MS. MOE: Your H6nor, just very briefly with respect.
to the Jeadership question, I just want to direct ‘the Court's.
attention, we noted this 6n page 27 of our brief, but. thé
testimony at trial was that Carolyn recalled that even after

Sarah Kelleh took over calling to schedule massages, Maxwéll

was Still present, inside the Palm Beach residence when Carolyn,

arrived, for massage appointments.
