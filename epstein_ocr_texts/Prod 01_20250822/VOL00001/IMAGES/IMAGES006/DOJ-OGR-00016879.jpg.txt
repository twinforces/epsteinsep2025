1 people who Jane recalled in particular being present for these
2 group sessions. I don't know the exact number off the top of

3 my head, but I think it is just the people who Ms. Menninger

4 asked about on cross examination and those particular first

5) names. So I want to make sure the record is clear, that it's

6 not the case that the 3500 materials had hundreds of names of

7 people â€”-

8 THE COURT: Can you just give me one second. Sorry.

9 Go ahead.

10 MS. MOE: I just want to make sure the record was

11 clear that in the materials relating to Jane that we produced
12 in October, it's not the case that those materials contain

13 hundreds of names of people. In fact, it was, I want to say,
14 five or fewer. But Ms. Menninger has those materials and it's
15 a very narrative scope. So I just want to make sure the record
16 is clear on that in terms of when the relevance of that would
17 have become apparent and how specific it was.

18 THE COURT: And the address or contact information

19 that you used to try to contact this witness, do you have any
20 basis -- what is the basis to the current contact information?
21 MS. MENNINGER: She was served personally by a process
22 server, and with that handover, I believe she was handed the
23 contact information to get in touch with us to be placed on
24 call. We had a standard letter that we gave to all of the
25 witnesses we've placed on call.
