LEKVMAX2 Summations - Ms. Moe

do tell, here's what Dr. RoGchio Explained to ‘you. She said,
Disclosure is a process that unfolds gver time, So individuals
will typically begin the disclosure maybe by alluding 'to what's
happened in a general sense or the gist of what"s -happened.

Lét' mé pause Here and say that's, exactly what happened
with Matt. She's alluding to what happened, giving the gist of
it, but not all the détails. It's just too hard.

Here's the rest of her testimony, And then it"s only
ower time they will begin 'to talk more specifically about what
has happened. And even in therapy, oftentimes disclosure’ of
the mést intimate or difficult détails is something that's very
hand and individuals ane very meluctant to do. Dr. Rocchio has
explained tO you that's what Happens in these cases, and she's
an, expert. in the psychology of sexual trauma.

Now, the defense cross=éxaniined Jane, about why she

didn't ,immediately tell someone about the abuse she suffered

whieh she wa5 14 and 15 and 16, as if that. would have been easy.

And, in fact, when, the defense points out that Jane wasn't able
to tell peoplé what really happened to her, they're aétudlly.
pointing to what makes this a ‘textbook, case of child sexual
abuse.

How else do you know that Jane told you the truth?

It's because her testimony is corroborated by the testimony of

Annie, and Carolyn and Kate, whose experiences were strikingly

Similar, as we've already discussed. It"s not a coincidence.
