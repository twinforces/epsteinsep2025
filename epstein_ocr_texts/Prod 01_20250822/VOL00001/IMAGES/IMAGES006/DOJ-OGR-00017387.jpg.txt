Q. And while that's up, Mr, Visoski,. would. you please describe
what the insidé of this apartment looked like.
A. I. believe it was on the second ‘or third floor, we're going
back a little 'ways. But it was -- once you went in the front
deer, it was a little on the unique side, It was a very long
type of apartment. Once you went in the front door, there was
an. entrance foyer, And if you continued straight through that
foyer, it wotild take you into ‘the kitchen. And then to the
left of the kitchen, I think, led down. to a hallway with some
guest. bedrooms.

Once 'you came back to the kitchen, to the right there
was a dining room. And then to the right of the dining réom

there was. Mr. Epstein's office where he had, a jnome theater set

up in his office as wells» And then once you Garttie out. back into
the foyer, I believe if you went to the right, it ‘took you, to
either more guest. bedrooms, and definitely the master bedroom
was down the hallway.
