to be blind, déaf dnd dumb, and to say nothing of Epstéin's and
Ms. Maxwell's lives,

Paragraph 26, there"s an objectiion to the
characterization concerning the defendant's identification. and
isolation Of minor girls aS inGonSistent with ‘the trial
evidence, I overrule this objection for the same reasons. as
articulated with respect to paragraph 22. In addition, the
trial evidence established that the defendant and Epstein.
isolated girls by spending titme with them alone away from ‘their
families. For example, Annie's testimony regarding the trip to
New Mexicé, Jane's testimohy that she would spend time at the
Palm Beach residence alone with Epstein and, the defendant.

Paragraphs 27 and 28 the defendant makes two
objections: First, to the assertion that the defendant and,

Epstein déveloped a scheme that created a "Constant stream of

ginrts who recruited each other." And, second, she objects to
the assertion that she encouraged minor girls to bring other

minor girls to. provide Epstein, with sexualized massages.

Again, based oh the trial testimdény and evidence, I

overrule the objection. It supported the information in these

paragraphs. The evidence, indicated the scheme started with the
defendant"s recruitment of Virginia. Virginia, then enlisted
Carolyn in additidén t6 at. least two other girls. Cardélyn in
turn recruited at, least three friends, and those friends then
brought more girls.
