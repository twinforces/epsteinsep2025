nature of the instant request, it is also (like the Court) faced with a broad. public interest. in. the

2. Whether the Defendant to the Grand. Jury Proceeding or the
Government: Opposes the Disclosure

The second factor asks whether the defendant or the Government opposes public disclosure:
of grand jury materials. See Jn re Craig, 131 F.3d. at. 106; see. also Lawyers? Committee for 9/L
InquiryIne.v. Garland, 43, F.4th 276, 285-86 (2d Cir. 2022) (affirming denial.of motion to disclose:

3. ‘Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in the Particular Case

The third factor considers “why disclosure::is being sought in the particular :case.” Jn re

in. Some situations historical or -public: interest alone could justify ‘the release of grand, jury’
information.” /d. As described above and in the underlying:motions, there:is undoubtedly a clearly
‘expressed interest; from. the public in Jeffrey Epstein’s and Ghislaine Maxwell’s crimes. Beyond.
that, there is abundant public interest in ‘the, investigative Work condueted by the Department of

Justice and the: Federal Bureau. of Investigation. into those crimes. See Jnre'Am. Hist. Assn, 49 F.

> As noted. below; the Government has not reccived any outreach from Epstcin’s surviving family:
concerning the instant motion.
