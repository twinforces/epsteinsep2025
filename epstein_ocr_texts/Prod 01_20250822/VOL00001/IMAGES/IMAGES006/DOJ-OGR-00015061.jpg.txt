Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 795 Filed 07/25/25 Page4of4
question best left to the court adjudicating that future case. We are concerned that, if this Court
explicitly or implicitly blesses the Government’s proposed redactions of non-victim-related
personally identifiable information (even in passing), that opinion will be treated as a proverbial
thumb on the scale in our FOIA case without materially affecting the Court’s decision in this
case,

In other words, if this Court mentions in its decision that it was swayed at all by the
Government’s promise to redact personally identifiable information, we are concerned that the
Government will then argue in its FOIA case that “Judge Englemayer agreed that this
information should not be publicly disclosed.” Therefore, we respectfully request that this Court
not take the Government’s statements regarding non-victim-related personally identifiable
information into account when reaching its decision regarding the Government’s motion, and we
further request that the Court specify that it is not opining on that question, should it grant the
Government’s motion.

The Government takes no position on the intervention of MSW Media. I attempted
twice—Wednesday and Thursday—to reach Defendant’s counsel and have not received a
response, so I am filing this as an opposed motion due to the fast-moving nature of this case.

Sincerely,
Vie
Counsel for Proposed Intervenor
