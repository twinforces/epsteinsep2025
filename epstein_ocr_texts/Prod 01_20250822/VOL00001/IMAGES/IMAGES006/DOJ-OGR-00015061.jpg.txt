explicitly‘or implicitly blesses the Government’s proposed redactions of non=-victim-related.
‘personally identifiable information (even in passing), that, opiiion ‘will be treated as a proverbial
thumb. on-the scale in our FOIA casewithout materially affecting the Court’s decision inthis
case.

In. other words, if this Court mentions in its decision that it was ‘swayed. a/ a// by the
Government’s promise to rédact-personally identifiable information, we: are Concerned that the
Government will then argue in, its FOIA case that “Judge Englemayer agreed that this
information should:not be publicly disclosed.” ‘Therefore, we respectfully: ‘request that this Court
not take the Government’s statements regarding non-victim-related personally-identifiable
information into account; when. reaching its decision, regarding the Government’s motion, and we
‘further request.that the Court specify that it is n0¢ opining on. that: question, should it grant: the:
Government’s motion.

The Government takes:no position on the intervention of MSW Mcdia. I attempted
twicc—Wednesday and Thursday—to reach Defendant’s counsel and have ‘not reecived.a

response; so I am filing this as an opposcd:motion duc to the fast-moving nature of this case.

Sinc rely,

Al McClanahan
Counsel for Proposed Intervenor’
