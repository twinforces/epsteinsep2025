1 above-guidelines sentence and an above-guidelines fine, we

2 would respectfully request that the Court address both the

3 sentence and the fine in the Court's statement of reasons.

4 THE COURT: Yeah, I actually -- guideline range, let

a me just check. I meant to talk about that. I'm not sure it is
6 an above-guidelines, but it may be since, as we know, I read

7 over five to mean five. So maybe I got that wrong. Let me

8 just check.

9 Oh, you are right. It is 20 to 200,000 for each

10 count. Do I have that right?

11 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.

12 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

13 I want to thank counsel. As I indicated, I do thank
14 the victims who made statements in writing or orally and their
15 counsel who supported them in that endeavor. I thank counsel
16 for Ms. Maxwell and counsel for the government.

17 We are adjourned.
