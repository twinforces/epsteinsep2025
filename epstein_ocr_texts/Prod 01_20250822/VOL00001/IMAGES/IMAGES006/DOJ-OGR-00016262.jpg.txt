LCAVMAX2 A. Farmer â€” direct

1 THE COURT: Counsel, there's a limit, and hearsay is
2 the limit, and this is a central question. You have the

3 witness, you have Maria Farmer coming to testify. I presume,
4 although I don't know, that she can testify Ms. Farmer was

5 there in New Mexico; correct?

6 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

7 THE COURT: And then you can ask her how she felt

8 about that. But you can't do it through hearsay.
