LG IAMAX2ps

Of which wére asked of the rélévant ‘investigative dgents or

argument's that. could be made based on the absence of evidence

‘in, the ‘record and ‘the like. And my ruling was what it was,

which didn't foreclose entirely the opportunity with respect to

cross-éxamination dnd ‘the like. I suspect this will be part of
the defense''s arguments in. closing, so 1t's appropriate to
include the charge.

MR. EVERDELL:; Understood.

Just. a8 long as we're allowed to argue, are permitted

to argue in closing about absence of evidence consistent with

the Court's ruling.

THE COURT: Absolutely, so long as the inference is
available in the récord.
And I'll just pause, because I made a mote to say

this. I Have a decent memory, and my afternodén and tomorrow

will be spent reviewing much of the trial ‘testimony. I don't

want o6bjéeétions during ¢ldésings, but that requires == I gather
it's Ms. Menminger that's doing the closing and, Ms. Moe, who
are absent today. So for both sides, any inference argued had
better be from the transcript. or the documents, and, any
objections should be rare and not based on your interpretation

of the available evidence but the fact of ‘the available

evidence. We should get through closings without objections.
MR. EVERDELL: Understood, your Honor.
MR. ROHRBACH: Understood on our part, your Honor.
