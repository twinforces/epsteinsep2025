Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 796 Filed 07/29/25 Page6of10
Supp. 2d 274, 294 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (applying Jn re Craig) (“Many historians ... have spent
countless hours documenting the Rosenbergs’ story. Many questions remain unanswered, and the
public’s interest remains.”); (Epstein Dkt. 61 at 1; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 1). Attention given to the
Epstein and Maxwell cases has recently intensified in the wake of the July 6, 2025 Memorandum
announcing the conclusions of the Government’s review into the investigation. See id.

The instant motions for unsealing are consistent with the fundamental purposes set forth in
that memorandum given the magnitude and abhorrence of Epstein’s crimes: to provide information
to the public while remaining sensitive to protecting the rights of victims.

4. What Specific Information Is Being Sought for Disclosure

The fourth factor asks what specific information the movant seeks to disclose. See Jn re
Craig, 131 F.3d at 106. Here, the Government seeks the public disclosure of the grand jury
transcripts in the Epstein and Maxwell cases (Epstein Dkt. 61 at 1; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 1). As
stated in the pending motions, any public disclosure granted by the Court would be “subject to
appropriate redactions of victim-related and other personal identifying information” (Epstein
Dkt. 61 at 2; Maxwell Dkt. 785 at 2).

5. How Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place

The fifth factor asks how long ago the grand jury proceedings took place. Jn re Craig, 131
F.3d at 106. The grand jury met in June and July of 2019 in the Epstein case. The grand jury met
in June and July of 2020 and March of 2021 in the Maxwell case. Here, the passage of time has
not dulled the public’s interest in these cases. See In re Craig, 131 F.3d at 107 (“if historical interest
in a specific case has persisted over a number of years, that serves as an important indication that
the public’s interest in release of the information is substantial”).
