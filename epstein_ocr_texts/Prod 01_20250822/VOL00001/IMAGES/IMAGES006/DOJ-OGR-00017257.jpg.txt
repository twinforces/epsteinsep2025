1 is for you to decide to what extent, if at all, the witness's

2 interest has affected or colored his or her testimony.

3 You have heard the testimony of a witness who was

4 previously convicted of a crime punishable by more than one

10 required to accept testimony even though the testimony is not
11 contradicted and the witness's testimony is not challenged.

25 lives. You may consider the interest of any witness in the
