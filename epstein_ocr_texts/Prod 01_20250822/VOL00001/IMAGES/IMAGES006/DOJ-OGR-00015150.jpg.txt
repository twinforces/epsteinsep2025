Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 809 _ Filed 08/11/25 Page 18 of 31

Second,-the evidence’ put before the Maxwell grand. juries is today, with only very minor
exceptions, a matter of:public record. The Government admitted as much in. response to the:
Court’s order: “‘The:enclosed, annotated. transcripts show that much of the information provided
during the course of the grand jury. testimony—with the exception of the identitics of:certain
withessés—was. made publicly available at [Maxwell’s] trial or has otherwise. been publicly
reported:through the public statements of: victims and witnesses.” Dkt. 800 at 3. And because
the :Government proposes to redact the witnesses” identitics, the exception it noted docs not
reflect information that the public would learn were the grand jury transcripts unscaled.

The Court’s‘review confirmed.that unscaling the grand jury:materials would not, reveal
new information of any consequence. In resporise to the Court*s order, the Govertiment. supplicd.
the Court with a binder highlighting any information. that the: Government-had been.unable:to
determine is ‘public. Only scattered: words, clauses, ‘and oceasional. sentences are highlighted.
about'the same conduct that:was the focus of Maxwell’s month-long trial.. The same is so for the
exhibits ‘put before the grand juries. Save inconsequential. portions, of a few: exhibits, these were’
reccived in ‘evidence at Maxwell’s trial. Some were reproduced. in the Maxwell indictments:

A. member of the public familiar with the Maxwell trial, record:who reviewed the grand
jury materials that the Government proposes to unseal would thus learn next to, nothing new.

The materials do not identify any person otherthan Epstein and. Maxwell.as having had.scxual
contact with,a minor. They do not discuss or identify any client of Epstcin’s or Maxwell’s.

They do not réveal any heretofore’unknown.mcans or methods of Epstein’s or Maxwell’s crimes.

'® And the Government’s highlighting is. significantly over-inclusive: On the Court’s review of
the trial record, a:.number of items highlighted infact were covered, by testimony .at;Maxwell’s
trial.
