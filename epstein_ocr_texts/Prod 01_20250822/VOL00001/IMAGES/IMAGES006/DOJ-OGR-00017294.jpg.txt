1 answer is yes.

2 THE COURT: I will say, I received your question.

3 I'll say, Yes, you may consider it.

4 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.

5 THE COURT: All right. So I will say: I received

6 your note. The answer is yes, you may consider it.

7 Please, everybody be back at 4:55 and ready to go.

8 T'll bring the jury out right at 5.

9 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: Thank you.

11 (Recess pending verdict)

12 THE COURT: So just to go over what I'm going to say,
13 T'll say that I received their note regarding dismissal tonight
14 at 5 p.m. and timing for tomorrow. That's fine. And we'll

15 have lunch for them by noon tomorrow. I'll ask them to give

16 Ms. Williams their lunch order on their way out.

17 I would say what I said I would say regarding

18 deliberations Thursday, if they wish. We got just a reminder
19 from the chief judge to remind everyone to wear masks at all
20 times, given where we are with the variant. So I'm going to
21 just remind them, other than when briefly eating or drinking,
22 they should have their mask on in the jury room.
23 Anything else?
24 MS. COMEY: No, your Honor.
25 MS. STERNHEIM: No, thank you.
