The Government will also today submit to Judge Berman under seal and ex parte a version
of the Epstein grand jury transcripts that specifically identifies which information in the transcripts
is, as far as the Government is aware, publicly available. This approach is in line with that taken
by the Government with respect to the Maxwell grand jury transcripts submitted to Judge
Engelmayer on August 4, 2025 (20 Cr. 330, Dkt. 800).
As always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.
Respectfully submitted,
