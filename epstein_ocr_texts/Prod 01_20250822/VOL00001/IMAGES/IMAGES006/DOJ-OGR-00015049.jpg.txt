Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 789 _ Filed 07/22/25 Page3of4

The Government’s motion does not adequately address these factors. The Court
accordingly directs the Government to file a memorandum of law, no later than Tuesday, July 29,
2025, addressing with specificity these and any other factors that the Government views as
germane to its application. The memorandum of law is to be no more than 25 pages, double
spaced. In light of grand jury secrecy and victim-related issues and other personal identifying
information concerns, the Government is authorized to file, on the public record, a redacted
version, and to file under seal the memorandum in unredacted form. The Court also directs the
Government to state in the memorandum whether, before filing the instant motion, counsel for
the Government reviewed the Maxwell grand jury transcripts and whether the Government
provided notice to the victims of the motion to unseal.

Following the Court’s ruling on the motion, the Court will invite the Government’s input
as to whether, and to what extent, the redactions in its memorandum remain warranted.

Grand jury transcripts: The Court has not received the grand jury transcripts that the
Government seeks to unseal. The Court directs the Government to submit to the Court under
seal the following materials no later than Tuesday, July 29, 2025: (1) an index of Maxwell grand :
jury transcript materials, including a brief summary, the number of pages, and dates; (2) a |
complete set of Maxwell grand jury transcripts; (3) a complete proposed redacted set of Maxwell
grand jury transcripts (i.e., the transcripts in the form that the Government proposes to release |
them); and (4) a description of any other Maxwell grand jury materials, including, but not limited
to, exhibits.
