1 animals, but I am proposing studies with humans. It goes

2 through a process of review on the campus. And sometimes they
3 ask you to make modifications in your procedure; other times

4 they just outright give you the blessing to go ahead and do the
5 study.

6 Q. Is there a standard requirement that the experiment that

7 you're engaging in cause no harm to the participant?

8 A. Well, we certainly -- we certainly hope for -- yes, that

9 the -—- when we're experimenting with human beings, that we are
10 not going to create any -- any harm in those participants.

11 Q. And does that requirement in and of itself limit the types
12 of experiments that you might otherwise choose to engage in?

13 A. Yes, it does. It does. So it might dictate what kind --
14 in the case of my work on false memories, what kind of false

15 memory I would propose to plant in the minds of a research

16 participant. So I might want to plant a false memory that

17 something horrible happened that would have been traumatic if
18 it actually had happened, like you were, you know, attacked by
19 a vicious animal. And the human subjects review committee,
20 well, has been known to approve that kind of proposal.
21 But other kinds of studies that might be a little bit
22 more sensitive, the human subjects committee might feel a
23 little uncomfortable about approving, like a deliberate attempt
24 to —- to plant a memory, for example, that your father, you
25 know, forced you to sacrifice animals or breed babies and kill
