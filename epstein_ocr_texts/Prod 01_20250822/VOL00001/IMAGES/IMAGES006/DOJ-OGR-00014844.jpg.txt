1 supervised release on Counts Three and Four and five years on

2 Count Six, all to run concurrently, for a total of five years

3 of supervised release.

4 Defense counsel indicated no objection to the

a conditions of supervised release indicated in the presentence

6 report, and so I impose them precisely as stated in the

7 presentence report, including the standard conditions, special
8 conditions, and mandatory conditions of supervised release.

9 Again, I am imposing them precisely as stated in the PSR.

10 I order Ms. Maxwell to pay a fine in the amount of

11 $750,000. The maximum amount per count is $250,000, so that is
12 $750,000 total. As I have indicated, I reject the contention
13 that the defendant is unable to pay a fine. Ms. Maxwell has

14 received a $10 million bequest from Epstein. This is in

15 addition to her other assets. And the defendant, I conclude,
16 is able to afford a substantial fine, and I conclude that the
17 maximum amount per count is reasonable under all relevant

18 circumstances in light of the counts of conviction.

19 The government has indicated that it is not seeking
20 restitution nor forfeiture.
21 I am imposing a mandatory special assessment, as I
22 must, of $100 per count, which is due immediately.
23 Does either counsel know of any legal reason, other
24 than those already argued, why the sentence shall not be
25 imposed as stated?
