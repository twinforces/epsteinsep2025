M6Ss2Max2

supervised reléasé on Counts Three and Fotr and five years on

Count. Six, all to «un. concurrently, for a total of five years

of supervised reléase.

Defense counsel indicated no objection te the

conditions of Supervised réléase indicdtéd in ‘the presentence

report, and 'so I impose them precisely as stated in the

preséntence report, including 'thé standard conditions, special

conditions, and mandatory conditions ef supervised release.
Again, I am imposing them precisely as stated ih the PSR.

I order Ms. Maxwell to pay a fine in ‘the amount, of
$750,000. Thé maximum amount per count is $250,000, so that is
$750,000 total. As I, have indicated, I reject the contention
that the défendant is uhdable to pay a fine. Ms. Maxwéll Has
received a $10 million, bequest from Epstein. This is. in
addition to hér other assets. And the défendant, I eénclude,
is able to afford a substantial fine, and I conclude that ‘the
maximum amount. pér Count is reasonable under all relevant.
cincumstances in light of the counts of conviction,

The government has indicated that it is not seeking
restitution nor forfeiture.

I am impdésing a mandatory special assessment, as I

must, of $100 per count, which is due immediately.
Does either counsel know of any legal reason, other
than those already argued, why the sentence shall ‘not, be

imposed as stated?
