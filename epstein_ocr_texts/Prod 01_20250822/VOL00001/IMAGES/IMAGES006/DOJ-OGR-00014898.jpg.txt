1 conference, where I'm providing either information and

2 knowledge in the course of a presentation or I'm conducting a
3 workshop, either by myself or as part of a symposium, a panel
4 of presenters, on a given topic.

5 Q. Are your professional presentations peer reviewed?

6 A. Yes, they are.

7 Q. What does it mean for a professional presentation to be

8 peer reviewed?

9 A. So it's the same peer-review process or it's analogous to
10 the process I described for publication. In other words,

11 people will submit, I would submit a presentation. There's a
12 call for proposals. I would provide a proposal of what it is I
13 would like to present to the program coordinator. They

14 typically would have a team of individuals who then review all
15 of the submissions and rate them. And then they would select
16 those that they feel are most relevant and worthy and

17 professional to present.

18 Q. Focus on page 7 of Government Exhibit 1, have any of your
19 professional presentations focused on trauma psychology or
20 interpersonal violence?
21 A. The vast majority of them have, yes.
22 Q. Then turning to pages 7 and 8, have you given any invited
ao addresses?
24 A. I have.
25 Q. What are invited addresses?
