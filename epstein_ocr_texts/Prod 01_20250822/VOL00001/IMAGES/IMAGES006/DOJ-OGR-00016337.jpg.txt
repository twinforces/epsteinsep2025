3 THE COURT: You may.

4 (Counsel conferred)

5 BY MS. MENNINGER:

6 Q. You talked on direct about the fact that you -- let me make
7 sure I've got my quote accurate. You talked generally about

8 once you got to New Mexico, that Ghislaine did not seem

9 surprised to see you there.
10 A. Right.
11 Q. And that you felt more comfortable because she was there.
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. Originally, your sister Maria was going to accompany you on
14 this trip to New Mexico; correct?
15 A. I don't remember that.
16 Q. Well, do you remember meeting with the FBI in 2006?
17 A. I do remember that meeting.
18 Q. Okay. And just as a side note, you, I think, testified on
19 direct that you believed the meeting with the FBI was in either
20 2006 or 2007?
21 A. Yeah. I had holiday decorations up, so I remember it was
22 that late in the year.
23 Q. Well, earlier you have said that you remembered it was 2007
24 because you remembered it being hot out. Do you remember that
25 statement?
