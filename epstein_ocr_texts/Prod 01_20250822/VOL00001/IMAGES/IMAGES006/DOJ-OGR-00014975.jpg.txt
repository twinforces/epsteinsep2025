LBAAMAX3ps Rocchio - Cross
1 BY MR. PAGLIUCA:
2 Q. What is it in your file that forms the basis of your
3 opinion?
4 A. There's nothing in my file that forms the basis of my
5 opinion. What's in my file are, for example, the motion for
6 today's hearing, a copy of the disclosure for some of the
7 witnesses, a redacted copy of those sorts of things, but
8 nothing from which I'm basing my opinion on today.
9 Q. OK. You mentioned a contract. You're billing the
10 government at a rate of $450 an hour. Is that correct?
11 A. That is correct.
12 Q. And your initial government contract is from $45,000. Is
13 that right?
14 A. Up to $45,000.
15 Q. And how much have you been paid up to today?
16 A. Nothing.
17 Q. And so you need to complete your contract before you
18 receive your $45,000; is that right?
19 A. No. That's not my understanding. I need to prepare an
20 invoice and provide it to the government. And I haven't had a
21 chance to do that yet.
22 Q. OK. And do you know what your final invoice will look like
23 in terms of hours spent up till today?
24 A. I don't at this point, no.
25 Q. How many hours have you spent up till today?
