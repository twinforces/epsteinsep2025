epinion. What's in my file are, for example, the motion for
today's hearing, a copy of the disclosure for some ‘of the
witnesses, a redacted copy of those sorts of things, but
nothing from which I'm basing my opinion on today.

Q. OK. You mentioned a contract. You're billing the
government. at a rate of $450 an hour. Is that correct?

Q. And your initial government contract is from $45,000. Is
that right.?

A. Up to $45,000.

Q. And how much have you been paid up ‘to today?

A. Nothing.

@. And 'so 'you need to complete your contract before you
réceive your $45,000; if that right?

invoice and provide it to the govérnnént. And I haven't had a
chance ‘to do that yet.

Q. OK. And do you know what your final invoice will look Like
in ‘terms of hours spent up ‘till today?
