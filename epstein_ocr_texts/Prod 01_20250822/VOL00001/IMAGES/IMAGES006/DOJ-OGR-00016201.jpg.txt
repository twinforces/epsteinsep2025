1 probably couldn't see the passengers as well, but depending

2 upon how the car approached the aircraft, if I'm sitting in the
3 cockpit looking down, I would be able to see the driver of the
4 car.

a Q. During that same period between 1994 and 2004, who do you

6 remember that you saw driving passengers up to Mr. Epstein's

7 plane in Palm Beach?

8 A. There were probably several. Typically, it was the house

9 manager at the time that would drive Mr. Epstein to the

10 airplane. One name comes to mind would be Juan Alessi, and

11 another would have been one of the house managers, Janusz.

12 There were probably a couple more that I'm just drawing a blank
13 on their names right now.

14 Q. That's fine. Now switching gears to New York, about when
15 do you remember first visiting Mr. Epstein's New York

16 residence?

17 A. Well, he first had a home on 69th Street, so it was in 1991
18 that I went to his very first residence, and then it was

19 probably a year or maybe two years later on that he had
20 purchased a different townhouse or brownstone, they call it, I
21 guess, on 7lst Street. So it was immediately with my
22 employment I visited the home.
23 Q. Thank you. I'd like to go back to something you said
24 earlier about the Palm Beach airport. You referenced a house
25 manager as a driver. What is a house manager?
