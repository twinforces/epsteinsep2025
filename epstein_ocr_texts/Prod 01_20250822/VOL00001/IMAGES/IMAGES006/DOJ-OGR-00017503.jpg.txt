1 AFTERNOON SEs SION

2 1:35 P.M.

3 THE COURT: Matters to take up, counsel?

4 MS. COMEY: Very briefly, your Honor.

5 Some of the courtroom sketch artists have indicated

6 confusion about the order about who they are allowed to draw

7 and not. And so I think we would propose that before we call a
8 witness who cannot be sketched, that that be put on the record.
9 THE COURT: Okay. The only restriction is with

10 respect to the witnesses who I've permitted to testify

11 anonymously.

12 MS. COMEY: That's correct, your Honor. And any

13 sealed exhibits, if someone were to somehow glimpse a sealed

14 exhibit, though I think that's unlikely given the precautions
15 we're taking.

16 THE COURT: Okay. So let's just talk through the

17 protocol, also what the witness will be called using the

18 pseudonym.

19 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: And then I'll swear them in. I would
21 typically say, State your name for the record. I'll just say,
22 I've granted you permission to testify under the pseudonym,
23 fill in the blank. And then turn the witness over for
24 questioning.
25 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.
