Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 761 Filed 08/10/22 Page 152 of 246 2447
LCGCmax4 Loftus — direct

1 MR. ROHRBACH: It's the same 401 question, although

2 this one is even more attenuated from any notion of bias or

3 motive since it says nothing about her incentives or why she is
4 testifying. She could be testifying for literally or

a cooperating with the government for literally any reason and

6 make the same statement. It sheds no light on her motives or

7 biases.

8 MS. STERNHEIM: It sheds light on her knowledge that

9 she knows what the other accusers are doing.

10 MR. ROHRBACH: That is not a motive or bias objection.
11 THE COURT: I think that's right. I'm inclined to

12 sustain on that one on the 401 ground. Okay.

13 So I think wetre limited to the first question. So

14 you'll work out —-

15 MR. ROHRBACH: We've been conferring and will work out
16 a way for Mr. Hamilton to testify on that point.

17 THE COURT: All right. We can bring in the jury?

18 MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing else from the government.

19 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim.
20 MS. STERNHEIM: Ready to proceed.
21 THE COURT: We'll get the witness and Ms. Williams
22 will get the jury.
23 (Witness present)
24 You may take off your mask. Thank you.
