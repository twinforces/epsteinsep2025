MR. EVERDELL: No, your Honor. ‘We rest on the papers.

THE COURT: I thank you counsel for your thorough
briefing. I dm prepared to rule.

The defendant raises four ‘objections. to the
calculation of the guideline rangé contained in the PSR. AS we
discussed, first, she argues I must apply the 2003 guidelines.
rather than the 2004 guidélinés. Beyond that, shé objects ‘to
the application of three sentencing enhancements. The
government's sole objection to the calculation of the

guidelines is that Virginia Roberts and Melissa should. be

considered victims. So I will address the defense objections

and, then the government's objectitons.

I begin by determining which of the Guideline manuals
apply. Generally, a sentencing court applies the version of
the guidelines in effect Sn the date that the defendant is
sentenced. 18 U.S.C. Section 3553 (a) (4) (A) (14). But. the
Ex Post Facto Clause is violated if a defendant is sentenced
under Guidelines issued, after she's committed her offense and
the néw Guidelines provide a Higher sentencing range than the.
version in, place at the tame of the offense. That's the
principle of a case calléd Peugh v. United Statés, 569 U.S. 530
(2013). In that case, a sentencing court must -- in the case

of a Higher range at the time of sentencing than in placé at

the time of the offense, in that case the sentencing court must

apply the guidelines in effect when the offense was committed.
