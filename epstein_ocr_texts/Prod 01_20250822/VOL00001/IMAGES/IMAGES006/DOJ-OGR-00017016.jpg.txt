1 paper exhibits that we were not able to show to the jury. So

2 that's what might push it back two hours. So I would ask for

3 the Court's indulgence to two and a half hours, in light of the
4 fact that we really didn't get to show the jury all of the

a exhibits, and it's going to take more time to walk them through
6 those exhibits that they haven't even seen.

7 THE COURT: All right. So two and a half, and two and
8 a half.

9 MS. STERNHEIM: They should five minutes for rebuttal.
10 And it will be fine.

11 THE COURT: Can you do 30 for the rebuttal?

12 MS. COMEY: I would ask for the Court's indulgence for
13 a little more than 30 if I may, just to have a little bit of a
14 cushion.

15 THE COURT: All right. 35.

16 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: So we're going to start at 9. We're going
18 to do a very short midmorning break. We're going to do a short
19 lunch. The jurors' lunch will be here, I think, 20 minutes.
20 Let's say 30 minutes for you all to have lunch too. Given
21 that, we should get through closings and the charge tomorrow
22 and potentially they can start deliberating, depending on what
23 time it is. But I agree --
24 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, just on the issue of
25 timing, thinking it through, so we start at 9, we start right
