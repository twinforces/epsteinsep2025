1 THE COURT: All right. Please bring in the jury.

2 (Jury present)

3 THE COURT: Thank you so much.

4 First, I received your note regarding dismissal

5 tonight at 5 p.m. and timing for tomorrow. That's fine. We

6 will have lunch for you by noon tomorrow. Please do give

7 Ms. Williams your lunch order on your way out.

8 And as a reminder for the morning, when you come in,
9 as soon as all 12 of you are present, you may begin your

10 deliberations, not before all 12 are present.

11 Next point I want to say, if you have not completed
12 your deliberations, it is possible for you to deliberate this
13 week on Thursday, December 23rd, if you wish. You can discuss
14 and let me know, if pertinent.

15 And then I want to give you a reminder that our chief
16 judge has asked us to remind all people in the courthouse that
17 masks are required to be worn at all times, unless they're

18 briefly off for eating and drinking. So a reminder to wear

19 masks at all times other than that.
20 With that, I just do want to have you bear in mind my
21 instructions, of course. I know that you are, but I just find
22 it important to repeat.
23 When you're not together deliberating, the 12 of you,
24 no discussions with each other or anyone else regarding the
25 case. Obviously no communications regarding the case, no
