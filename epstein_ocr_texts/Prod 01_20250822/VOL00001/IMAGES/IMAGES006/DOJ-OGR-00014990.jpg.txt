1 Q. And is that your definition?

2 A. It's my understanding of the definitions that have been

3 talked about in the literature. I mean, I haven't written and
4 published a specific set definition. It's a common definition
5 and the one I'm using in my testimony, yes.

6 Q. I was going to ask you that question. You have not

7 published anything specifically about grooming; correct?

8 A. Specifically about grooming, no. But I have certainly

9 published and made reference to grooming.

10 Q. And you have not done any metadata studies on your own to
11 collect data about grooming; correct?

12 A. Correct.

13 Q. Grooming can consist of the actions that you're talking

14 about, can consist of -- I think we saw a list of 77 things on
15 it as part of your testimony; is that right?

16 A. Those were 77 specific behaviors that had been identified
17 in the literature as potentially being part of the grooming

18 process, yes.

19 Q. But I think we were talking about things like taking an
20 interest in another human being could be considered grooming?
21 A. Not in and of itself. It would depend on the pattern of
22 behavior and the context in which it's occurring.
ao Q. Let's talk about that for a second. Because what you're
24 Saying is, it depends on the groomer's intent in doing a
25 specific act is what, in your view, makes it grooming or not
