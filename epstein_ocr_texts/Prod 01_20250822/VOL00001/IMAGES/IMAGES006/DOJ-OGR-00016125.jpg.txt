1 (Jury present)

2 THE COURT: Jurors, you may take your seats as

3 Ms. Williams directs you. Feel free to be seated as you come

4 in. Everyone may be seated.

S This will not be your permanent seats; we'll get that
6 squared away during the lunch break.

7 But first, let me say good afternoon to you. It's

8 nice to see you all. Thank you very much for your patience. I
9 appreciate you hanging in there with a little bit of delay, but
10 we're now prepared to get started.

11 I will ask Ms. Williams to swear you in as our jurors.
12 (A jury of 12 and six alternates was impaneled and

13 sworn)

14 THE COURT: Thank you so much. You may be seated.

15 Members of the jury, now that you've been sworn, I'm
16 going to give you some instructions about your duties as

17 jurors. At the end of the trial, I'll give you more detailed
18 instructions, and those instructions will control your

19 deliberations in this case. But for now, let me explain how
20 the trial will proceed.
21 The first step in the trial will be opening
22 statements. The government will make an opening statement.
23 After that, I expect the lawyers for the defendant to make an
24 opening statement as well. Those statements are not evidence.
25 They serve no purpose other than to give you an idea in advance
