MS, COMEY: Your Honor, I'm transitioning entirely

away from ‘where we were at ‘the prior sidébar. I was about to

Switch to eliciting seme prior consistent statements of Jane's,
T do believe the door Has. beén, opened for ‘that, but T
understand defense counsel would object as beyond the scope.
But for efficiency purposés, I was going to ask hér now while
she's on the stand about these prior consistent statements.

MS. MENNINGER: I mean, your Honor, opening the door
tq prior eonsistent statements in this manner will then, on
recross, I think 6pen the door to ahy number 6f other prior
inconsistent statements that your Honor just ruled out, and, we
had to go through ah entire process té gét in the very few
prior inconsistent statements we did. The government. hasn't,
even told uS now which prior Gohsistent statement that they're
offering.

THE COURT: Rebuttal if it's beydénd the scope. So
sustained with the opportunity to confer if they want to recall
the witness for rebuttal.
