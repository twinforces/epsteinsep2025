years since she was convicted?’ What was there to'ask?’What are you conspiring? What is your
next step? What i isthe énd. game? T I ask’ the United States Government, thats so rightfully wants| to

when‘ you decide to maké these decisions like moving her into a “a tnihimnumn-secutity pion camp.

I think: the victims have a.right to hear the audio without redactions.. I think the:victims should
be able to see what'the FBI took from his, NYC tiansion, FL mansion.afid, USVI private island
resort: I think we should be able‘to see ALL the files. J think any photos or videos of the victims
should bé given. ba¢k:to:them. NOT REVIEWED BY CONGRESS, GROSS!!!

Will justice ever be served? I question what that'would look like to the DOJ, the: FBI, because so
fat we have. ‘got nothing, n not. even an apology, not even the answers we so long for: We all want:

the public ignorant. The very y fact that something: Is Secr et means s there: 1S 5 something to hide.

I support the United States Senate Committee on Finance lead. by Senator Wyden, “‘Follow-the-:
Money” Investigation of Epstein Finances. I'thank:-him.and his team for their work, but.I request
more transparency. I‘think the victims lawyers should have’ access to:all these findings. We have
a.right to take legal action against: these institutions and/or individuals involved in Epstein’s and
co-conspirators crimes.

It-has been super unfortunate the way the US Government has handle'this ordeal. We as
victims want answers, but not only us, T think’the. general public is exhausted also by all of this.
The general public: cares more about their:own personal wellbeing, right? Unfortunately, for us
victims, this story';will NEVER go away. There will.always be an interest in the case of Epstcin
and Maxwell. Ghislaine’s trial was based off of the fact‘that J effrey’ could.never be tricd and died
by “killing himsclf”. Why oh’why ‘will we have to-live with this conspiracy for the rest of our
lives? Because they keep laboring the truth, scrubbing the data, It is so hurtful and:a. detriment to
the victims to continue-disregarding our fecling, our traumas. Pleasc L.ask you to: consider our
well-being first, Please I ask that the true redactions that:come first are only for the victims.

Thank you, for your’ time:
