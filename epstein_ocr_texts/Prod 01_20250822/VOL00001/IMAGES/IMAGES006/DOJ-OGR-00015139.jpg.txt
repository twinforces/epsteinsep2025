Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 809 _ Filed 08/11/25 Page7of31
In the same press release, the DOJ quoted a letter from the AG to the FBI Director,
stating that the AG had just learned that the FBI possessed “thousands of pages of documents
related to the investigation and indictment of Epstein.” The AG’s letter continued:
By 8:00 a.m. tomorrow, February 28, the FBI will deliver the full and complete
Epstein files to my office, including all records, documents, audio and video
recordings, and materials related to Jeffrey Epstein and his clients, regardless of
how such information was obtained. There will be no withholdings or limitations
to my or your access. The [DOJ] will ensure that any public disclosure of these
files will be done in a manner to protect the privacy of victims and in accordance
with law, as I have done my entire career as a prosecutor. ...
I appreciate your immediate attention to this important matter. I know that we are
both committed to transparency for the American people, and I look forward to
continuing to work with you to serve our President and our country.

On July 6, 2025, the DOJ and the FBI issued another memorandum regarding Epstein. It
stated, in part:
As part of our commitment to transparency, the [DOJ] and the [FBI] have
conducted an exhaustive review of investigative holdings relating to Jeffrey
Epstein. To ensure that the review was thorough, the FBI conducted digital
searches of its databases, hard drives, and network drives as well as physical
searches of squad areas, locked cabinets, desks, closets, and other areas where
responsive material may have been stored. These searches uncovered a significant
amount of material, including more than 300 gigabytes of data and physical
evidence.
The files relating to Epstein include a large volume of images of Epstein, images
and videos of victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten
thousand downloaded videos and images of illegal child sex abuse material and
other pornography. ... Only a fraction of this material would have been aired
publicly had Epstein gone to trial, as the seal served only to protect victims and did
not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of illegal wrongdoing.
Through this review, we found no basis to revisit the disclosure of those materials
and will not permit the release of child pornography.
This systematic review revealed no incriminating “client list.” There was also no
credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of
his actions. We did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation
against uncharged third parties... .
