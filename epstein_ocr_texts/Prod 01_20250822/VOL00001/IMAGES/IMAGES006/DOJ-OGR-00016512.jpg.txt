1 equipment does not save anything. So I would ask permission

2 that we would be able to take a picture of it for the record.

3 It's a demonstrative; it's not being put into evidence. But if
4 the Court wished it to be part of the record, the only way to

a preserve it would be by a copy of it.

6 THE COURT: What's an examole? Usually you just use

7 words to describe for the record what's being indicated.

8 MS. STERNHEIM: There's an opportunity for her to doa
9 demonstrative for the jury. If we weren't in COVID, she would
10 get up, she would stand before the jury with a whiteboard. We
11 cannot do that under these circumstances. And the equipment is
12 for that very purpose. It's been done in other cases; it's

13 just that this equipment —--

14 THE COURT: So it would be like a whiteboard.

15 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes.

16 THE COURT: Whiteboard doesn't come into evidence.

17 MS. STERNHEIM: I'm not saying it's coming into

18 evidence.

19 THE COURT: She can draw on it, but I don't see a need
20 to take a picture.
al MS. STERNHEIM: I'm only saying if the Court wished
22 there to be a -—- part of the record. But if the Court does
23 not, that's fine.
24 THE COURT: I'm sorry, I misunderstood. I thought you
25 were asking for it to be part of the record.
