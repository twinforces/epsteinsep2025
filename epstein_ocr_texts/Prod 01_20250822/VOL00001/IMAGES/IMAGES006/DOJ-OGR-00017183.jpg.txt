L€KCmax.7 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey

(Gury present)

THE COURT: Everyone may be seated, Thank you,
members of the jury. We'll now héar a short rebuttal argtiment
by the government.

Ms. Comey, you may proceéd.

MS, COMEY: Thank. you, your Honor.

I want to Start off by making one thing wery eléar,
this ease is about that woman, it's about. the children. that she
targeted, the steps that she took to Serve those children up to
be abused. It's about her ‘own participation in that abuse when
she touchéd Jane's breasts and Carolyn's breasts and Annie's
breasts, This case is about, Ghislaine Maxwell, the crimes she
committed.

The defense just spent a whole Lot of energy tryang to
get yéu to think about anyone other thah the defendant, trying
to. get you, to look, away from the massive amount of evidence

that Ms. Moé walked you through this morning.

Now, to be clear, the defense doesn't have to. do

anything at all at this trial. As Judge Nathan has instructed

you, the government bears ‘the burden of proof and we embrace

that burden, but when the defense makes arguments like they

just did, it is perfectly appropriate for ‘you to think, about
whether those arguments make any sense at. all and it is

perfectly appropriate for the government to respond to those

arguments. Here; the :'defense's theories just ‘do not hold up.
