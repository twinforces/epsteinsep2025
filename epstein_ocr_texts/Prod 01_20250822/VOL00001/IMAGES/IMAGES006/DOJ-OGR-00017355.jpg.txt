1 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.

2 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

3 THE COURT: All right. So again, just to sum it up:

4 "You asked about the schedule going forward. Yes, you
a will continue deliberations as needed every day going forward,
6 including 12/31, 1/1, and 1/2, until you reach a verdict. If

7 this presents a substantial hardship for anyone because of

8 unmoveable commitments, please let Ms. Williams know. Of

9 course, by this I don't mean to pressure you in any way. You
10 should take all the time that you need."

11 I will write that up in my best possible handwriting
12 and then we'll put that in. In the meantime, we have a note.
13 Ah. Okay. "We are requesting the transcripts of the
14 expert witness on memory." So it is Elizabeth Loftus. And

15 that will be Court Exhibit 19.

16 Okay. So you'll keep the transcripts coming. I will
17 write up that note and send it back. Anything else, counsel?
18 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Just with respect to the
19 transcripts, I think -—-
20 THE COURT: Oh, you have -—-
21 MS. MOE: Just one issue with respect to the
22 transcript regarding Cimberly Espinosa. I'm going to defer to
23 my colleague on this particular issue.
24 THE COURT: Yes. Go ahead.
25 MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor.
