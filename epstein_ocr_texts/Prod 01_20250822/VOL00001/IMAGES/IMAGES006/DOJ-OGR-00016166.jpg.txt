MR. PAGLIUCA: Correct.
MS, MOE: Your Honor, what Ms. Sternheim said ain the
opening was that the Jury would léarn ‘that ‘these women had beén

no Connection between what's been proffered to this jury and
what we are hearing now from defense counsel, The fact that
there is an émail between a lawyér and a 'prosectitor suggesting

tepics about an interview is a separate matter, but certainly

wouldn't suppért the argument that they themselves had
manipulated, their clients and cultivated the stories. That Ls

an entirély separate matter, your Honor.

THE COURT: I think the iunference Js. available from --

cultivating, so I'm géing to allow that. It's unéledr to me

attorneys, but it's based on nonprivileged communication's

between the attorneys and the government. And so beyond that,

I'm going to let the angument be made, unless ‘the government"s
positioh is there is fo éeviderice available from which thé
inference of manipulation by the attorneys could be made.

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor,

The only evidence that defense counsel has proffered
1s an email between an. attorney and. a prosecutor suggesting
