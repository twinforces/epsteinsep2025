LBTVMAX3 Opening —- Ms. Sternheim

1 MR. PAGLIUCA: Correct.

18 attorneys, but it's based on nonprivileged communications

19 between the attorneys and the government. And so beyond that,

23 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
24 The only evidence that defense counsel has proffered
25 is an email between an attorney and a prosecutor suggesting
