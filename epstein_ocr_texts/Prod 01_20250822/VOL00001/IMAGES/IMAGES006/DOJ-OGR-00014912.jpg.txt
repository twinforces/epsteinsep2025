1 what that typically entails, not just the sexual components,

2 but also the psychological and emotional components and their

3 effects. And also, certainly, in my reviews of the literature
4 and things that we talked about in graduate school and in other
5 trainings, what sorts of behaviors offenders commonly use in

6 order to engage children in that relationship.

7 Q. In your clinical practice, have you treated and evaluated

8 patients who have reported being groomed in connection with

9 sexual abuse?

10 A. I have. Although they don't typically use that word. As I
11 said, most patients, including patients I treat, who have been
12 abused as children, have had abuse happen in the context of a
13 relationship. The abuse hasn't involved explicit force. So to
14 the extent that they talk about the ways that they came to

15 know, love and depend upon the perpetrator, yes, they talk and
16 describe at length the types of behaviors that would meet the
17 definition of grooming.

18 Q. Approximately how many patients have you treated, evaluated
19 who have reported behaviors consistent with grooming?
20 A. I would say the vast majority of patients I have treated
21 who have reported childhood sexual abuse, again, that would be
22 hundreds upon hundreds.
23 Q. What are the ages of the patients you have treated who have
24 reported behaviors consistent with grooming?
25 A. I have treated patients who are adolescents and patients
