LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 sisterly-type things. They went to see a play, they went to

2 the Blue Man Group, they went to the Met, they went to a New

3 Year's party, they went to thrift stores, and she got a dress.
4 There were two instances she met Epstein while she was
iy in New York, and during those events, she and her sister sat

6 had in his office across a desk and discussed her college

7 applications. She told you she thought Epstein's home was

8 under renovation at the time, and she told you that there was

9 no sexual activity that occurred whatsoever in that home. She
10 told you Ghislaine Maxwell was not in the home, never came to
11 the home, no physical contact happened in the home, she wasn't
12 present, she wasn't there, and she didn't see anything that had
13 to do with Ghislaine Maxwell while she was in New York. So how
14 did Ghislaine target her somehow to come into New York to see
15 her sister? Where is Ghislaine Maxwell's role in any of that?
16 The second contact she had was in the movie theater

17 when they went to see a movie, she said she remembers was

18 called Five Monkeys. There isn't a movie called Five Monkeys,
19 there is a movie called 12 Monkeys, but that's what she
20 remembers. And while she was in Five Monkeys, Epstein caressed
21 her hand and held her hand, and as creepy as this is, what she
22 told the Victims Compensation Fund was that him holding her
23 hand was sexual abuse.
