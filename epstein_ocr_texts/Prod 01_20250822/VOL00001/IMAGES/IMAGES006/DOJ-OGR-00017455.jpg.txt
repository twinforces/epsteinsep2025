1 just her true first name?

2 A. Correct. Yes.

3 Q. And there were three of those flights; is that right?

4 A. As far as that same first name?

5 Q. Yes.

6 A. I'm sure, yeah, there is at least three.

7 Q. There was one in '96, one in '97, and one in '98 they

9 A. I don't remember the dates, Mr. Everdell.
10 Q. Do you remember those three flights they showed you?
11 A. Yes.
12 Q. Well, when you met with the government and they showed you
13 these three flights, you couldn't recall whether the woman we
14 are referring to as Jane actually flew on those flights or
15 whether it was somebody else with her same first name?
16 A. Correct. There was a -- the first names were the same, but
17 there were no last names.
18 Q. Now, sitting here today, you still don't know whether the
19 women we're calling Jane flew on any of those flights; isn't
20 that right?
21 A. Not to my knowledge. I mean, it was just -- I couldn't
22 tell one from the other with no last name and 20 -- like you
23 said, 20, 22 years ago.
24 Q. Sure. But there were other people in Epstein's world who
25 had that same true first name; isn't that right?
