Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 761 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 244 of 246 2539
LCGVMAX7 Hyppolite - direct

1 completing closings and the charge on Monday.

2 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes.

3 THE COURT: Okay.

4 MS. MENNINGER: May I inguire, your Honor? In some

5) courtrooms I've been in there is a rule, perhaps not strongly
6 enforced, but strongly suggested, that the government only

7 reserve a certain portion of their summation for the rebuttal
8 piece because otherwise it ends up being a bit of a more in

9 rebuttal than in the actual substance. I don't know if your
10 Honor has that practice, but I would request that some

11 reasonable percentage be allocated to the first versus the

12 rebuttal portion.

13 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I expect the rebuttal will be
14 significantly shorter than the closing. I don't think that's
15 going to be an issue.

16 THE COURT: Well, it certainly should be. It should
17 be rebuttal and not â€”-

18 MS. COMEY: That's exactly right, your Honor. And

19 T'll be doing the rebuttal. I fully intend it to be much
20 shorter than the closing and to the point, as is consistent
al with our office practice before your Honor and in this
22 district.
23 THE COURT: Okay. Anything else on that?
24 Let me just check my various inputs to see if I'm
25 missing -- check with my law clerk.
