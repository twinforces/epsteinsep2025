1 of the conspiracy is to violate New York law, then an

2 invitation to an island that's not New York doesn't count.

3 And also, an invitation to travel to New Mexico to do
4 whatever it is they were planning on doing in New Mexico is

5) also not a goal of violating New York law. I'm sorry, from

6 Arizona. So there's no connection to New York law with respect
7 to Annie's testimony either.

8 And so whatever purpose they want to glean from those
9 two witnesses' testimony, Kate and Annie, or even Carolyn, the
10 object of this conspiracy, for this to be a crime, it can only
11 be hung on the testimony, at least in the evidence in the

12 record, the testimony of Jane. And --

13 THE COURT: You're doing precisely what Mr. Rohrbach
14 said, which is you're switching back and forth between the

15 conspiracy and the substantive count. So Annie, for example,
16 the evidence is the conduct occurred in New Mexico. That's why
17 I gave the limiting instruction. But that could be considered
18 with other evidence of the conspiracy with respect to New York,
19 the violation of New York law. You don't have to have the
20 violation of New York law to establish the elements of the
21 conspiracy count.
22 So the objection is overruled.
23 Next.
24 MR. EVERDELL: All right. Next is line 13, your
25 Honor, same page.
