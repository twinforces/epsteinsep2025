affirmed 147 F.2d 336 (Sth Cir. 1945) (“The same jurisdiction that was sought in the beginning
continues to exist insofar as the integrity and preservation of the minutia and minutes and
proceedings of those steps are concerned. What was done here is evidence and may be advantaged
by either party, having in mind, of course, the question of the secrecy of the grand jury proceedings.
And the only jurisdiction over such matters is in this court.”); see also, e.g., Dale v. Bartels, 532
F. Supp. 973, 978-79 (S.D.N.Y. 1982) (ordering limited disclosure of sealed grand jury testimony
after entry of a nolle prosequi). However, the fact that Epstein passed away—which was the basis
for the entry of the nolle prosequi—is a factor to be considered. See Jn re Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 106
(2d Cir. 1997) (noting that “the current status of the principals of the grand jury proceedings and
that of their families” is a factor “that a trial court might want to consider when confronted with
these highly discretionary and fact-sensitive ‘special circumstances’ motions”).

Seventh, regarding the Government’s approach to victim notification of the instant
proceedings, as noted in its July 29 submission, the Government has provided notice of the
unsealing motions to all but one of the victims who are referenced in the grand jury transcripts at
issue in the motions. The Government still has been unable to contact that remaining victim. With
respect to victims who are not identified in the grand jury transcripts but who have previously
received victim notifications in the Maxwell and Epstein matters, the Government will over the
coming days alert those victims to the fact of the unsealing motions.

Finally, in light of the Government’s ongoing efforts to ensure that that the interests of
victims and other third parties are appropriately considered, as well as the multifaceted nature of
these and other relevant proceedings, it may be necessary or appropriate for the Government to
modify or supplement the information provided today, and the Government commits to doing so
as promptly as practicable.

As always, the Government is available to answer any questions the Court may have.
