1 Transcript at 2174 to 76 and 2194 to 95, I'll sustain.
2 I sustained two objections to continuing question on this

3 issue. Statement was read aloud and the defense made and can

4 make its impeachment argument.

a) 2182 to 83, sustained. The statement was read aloud.
6 2185 to 86, sustained. The statement was read aloud

7 and there is no inconsistency as I previously ruled at 2186.

8 2195, sustained for the same reasons I just indicated.
9 2197 and 98, sustained. Annie did not earlier

10 characterize Ms. Maxwell as, quote, disinterested, but that's
11 not an inconsistency. Further, Annie had no opportunity to

12 explain or deny the statement or lack thereof.

13 2209 to 13, sustained. There isn't an inconsistency
14 and Annie answered, "I don't recall."

15 2224, sustained.

16 I think that's it. And just on that last one, it was
17 read aloud and I don't see an inference of inconsistency.

18 Anything else on that?

19 MS. COMEY: No, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: Ms. Menninger?
2l MS. MENNINGER: No, your Honor.
22 THE COURT: Again, recognizing that the parties had
23 agreed on others.
24 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. Just with respect to
25 one thing your Honor just said, because the statement was read
