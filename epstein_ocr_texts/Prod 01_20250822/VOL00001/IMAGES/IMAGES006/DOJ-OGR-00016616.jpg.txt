Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 761 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 133 of 246 2428
LCGCmax4 Loftus â€” direct

1 A. In some of the experiments, yes. So, for example, in the

2 study that I've testified about already, we show people a

3 simulated accident, so we know exactly what the event was, we

4 know what they saw and that way we can see how the post-event

S information changes what they remember.

6 Q. And in contrasting that, which you just said you could see,
7 that would be different than somebody who just reports a memory
8 with no visual proof or documentation of it; correct?

9 A. Yes, then you don't have a record of what actually

10 happened.

11 Q. And somebody who might report a memory may give very vivid
12 detail; correct?

13 A. Yes.

14 Q. And does the fact that someone reports a memory with vivid
15 detail mean that the memory is accurate?

16 A. No, because of false memories. Once they're constructed in
17 somebody's mind, either by external suggestion or by

18 autosuggestion, could be very vivid, detailed. People can be
19 confident about them, people can be emotional about them, even
20 though they're false.
21 Q. So if somebody believes that they had an experience and
22 describes that experience, there is no way of proving that that
23 actually occurred?
24 MS. POMERANTZ: Objection.
25 THE COURT: Sustained.
