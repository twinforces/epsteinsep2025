1 may not believe that relationship to be abusive. They may

2 believe that the two of them are in love. They may have been

3 deliberately misled to believe that it is somehow a love, a

4 love relationship. So they, they don't identify it or label it
5 as abuse.

6 Also, there's, as with any form of sexual abuse,

7 sexual assault, in childhood or otherwise, there's a great deal
8 of shame and stigma, and adolescents are, again,

9 developmentally as a group notoriously sensitive to fear of

10 being judged.

11 And then finally, they don't want to get in trouble.
12 They don't want their freedom restricted. There are, you know,
13 studies that have been done talking to teenagers or adults

14 about why they did or didn't disclose at various points in

15 time, have identified all of these as factors, among others.

16 Q. Based on your experience, research, and training, how do

17 people who have experienced childhood sexual abuse talk about
18 or disclose the abuse?

19 A. So this is something that's really been studied in terms of
20 the literature looking at how and why do people disclose or not
21 disclose. And one of the consistent findings is that
22 disclosure most often takes place to appear not -- for an
23 adolescent to appear and for adults -- to friends, not to
24 formal agencies.
25 I'm sorry. Can you repeat the question?
