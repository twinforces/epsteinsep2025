when Maxwell’s legal and reputational interests are at stake. These factors weigh
heavily in favor of preserving the secrecy of the grand jury materials.

Although the government’s memorandum sets forth that certain “aspects and
subject matters of the transcript became public during Maxwell’s trial,” Maxwell has
never had an opportunity to review the entirety of the grand jury materials in her
case. Dkt 796 at 7. The government provided a list to the Court, under seal, of
witnesses whose accounts were conveyed in the grand jury and a corresponding list
noting which witnesses testified at trial. That list has not been disclosed to us. The
government's memorandum, however, acknowledges that the law enforcement
witnesses who testified before the grand jury are alive and remain active in the FBI
and NYPD respectively. The government’s memorandum also disclosed that “many”
of the complaining witnesses, who formed the subject matter of the grand jury
witnesses’ testimony, are also alive. Dkt 796 at 8. This factor likewise counsels
against disclosure of the grand jury transcripts given the need to protect both active
law enforcement personnel and alleged victims.

death. They were executed in 1953. Id. In 2015, upon a motion by a non-profit
