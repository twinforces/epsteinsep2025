1 yield sign, not a stop sign, right?

2 A. It was the critical item, yes.

3 Q. Okay. But to be clear, the research subjects still

S A. Presumably, yes.

6 Q. Okay. In that experiment, did any of the experiment

10 Q. Now, in that experiment, you changed one fact, that's the
11 yield sign stop sign, right?

12 A. Or vice-versa.

13 Q. You've done other experiments where you've changed more
14 than one fact, right?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. There is, I think, a science museum experiment?

17 A. Yes.

18 Q. And in that study you tried to change two facts, right?
19 A. Correct.
20 Q. People went to a museum and they watched a short video,
21 right?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. And in that video, a blue car rushed towards a person for
24 eight seconds, right?
25 A. I don't -- the car was blue, the offending car, yes.
