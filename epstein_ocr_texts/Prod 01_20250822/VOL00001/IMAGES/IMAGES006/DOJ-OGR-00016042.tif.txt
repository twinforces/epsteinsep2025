Fund for deserving and talented students. When
awards are made, Interlochen will notify you, with
respect to the recipients. The recipient will
also be asked to communicate with the donor. If
you would like to met the students, we will help
arrange a meeting on campus as well.

6. At present we are calling the lodge the "Jeffrey
E. Epstein Scholarship Lodge." If you would like
it named in another manner, please contact me with
the appropriate name or wording.

7. Under the charitable contribution act, you are
permitted use of the lodge for two weeks each
year, without any negative implications in respect
to the full tax deductibility of your gift.
Naturally, we would like you to visit the new
lodge this summer. So that we might begin to book
the lodge, I would ask you to consider what two
weeks you would like reserved for your use.
Perlman will be giving his concert on August 7,
1994. I have enclosed the appropriate tax code
for your file.

We have much to discuss as we move towards completion, but I
thought this might be helpful.
Jeffrey, we really appreciate all that you do for
Interlochen. Somehow thank you seems inadequate for your
continued commitment and generosity. We are most grateful.
Warmest regards,
