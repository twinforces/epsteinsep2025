1 this witness, it's about the direct of the next witness; fair

2 to say?

3 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes. And there could be redirect that
4 might, in some way, have bearing on this, but I will review it
5 in connection with the direct examination of this witness.

6 THE COURT: Okay.

7 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

8 THE COURT: Thank you for previewing it. We'll take

9 it as it comes. I understand the government's position, I

10 understand Ms. Sternheim's request to evaluate it. It's the

11 specific testimony that comes in on direct of the next witness
12 in light of what happens yet on cross.

13 Anything else?

14 MS. MOE: Not from the government, your Honor. Thank
15 you.

16 THE COURT: We'll meet again at 8:45. As soon as we
17 have the jury, we'll take up issues, I'll see a briefing, and
18 hopefully we can get resolution and we'll start with the jury
19 as soon as there here. We're adjourned.
