1 MS. MENNINGER: Of course.

2 THE COURT: And if not, we can unseal it.

3 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, as long as we're referring

4 to just page 2, then the government does not believe any

a redactions are necessary. So it can be published.

6 THE COURT: Why don't we do that. Why don't we make

7 page 2 AFI.

8 MS. MENNINGER: That's fine.

9 THE COURT: Page 2 of what I'm looking at will be now
10 marked as AFl and, without objection, I'll admit AF1, which is
11 only page 2.

12 Let me just give the Bates that's at the bottom. You
13 want to just give that --
14 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. It's Bates labeled
15 AFarmer10472.,
16 THE COURT: That is the single page that I'm admitting
17 as AFl. And no objection to it being published?
18 MS. POMERANTZ: No objection, your Honor.
19 THE COURT: You may publish.
20 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor.
21 BY MS. MENNINGER:
22 Q. So this is, I think as we just said, an entry that you made
23 in the same journal before you went to New York?
24 A.  Gorréect.
25 Q. So it's your handwriting, et cetera?
