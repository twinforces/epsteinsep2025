And as I said, we'll discuss voir dire and take up
questionnaire issues as needed.

So that's Monday, November 15th.

I would also like to just. go ahead and schedule what
will be our final pretrial conference for November 23rd, is
what I propose, in the afternoon. I still need to work. through
the logistics and space and timing on that, use that to elear
out any remaining issues or motions in advance of trial.

Ms. Pomerantz, how does that sound to the government?

MS. POMERANTZ: That all sounds fine. Thank you.

THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim?

MS. STERNHEIM: That sounds fine. TI just have a
question with regard to the commencement --

THE COURT: Could you. pull up. thé mike.

MS. STERNHEIM: Oh. Sorry.

With regard. to the cdémmencenént of voir dire, what
time will we begin on the 16th?

THE COURT: I believé 9; but I will confirm. and. see

what time I believe -- what time we think the jurors will

actually be réady to go, checked. in and réady to go, and I'll
work backwards from that, give us time to get set up and
address any preliminary issues. So lét's assume 9 and I'll
confer with the jury department.

MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.

Just a moment.
