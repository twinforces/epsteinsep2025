You spoke to the government on May 9th of 2020, right?

Oo

A. Yes.

Q. And I want, to jump ahead about a month from that. In late
June of 2020, the Epstein Victims Compensation, Fund, opened,
right?

A. <2 don"t remember when it opened, but yes.

MS; MENNINGER: Okay: I'd like to have the witness
look at AF-1l2.

THE COURT: The government has it?

MS, MENNINGER: I will get them a copy, your Honor. I
believe théy do, but I'll give them a copy.

If I could, have the witness take a look at the first
paragraph of text. and just tell me if that refreshes your
memory about when the Epstein Victims ‘Compensation. Program
opened.
