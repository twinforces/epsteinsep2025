LCAVMAX2 A. Farmer â€” direct

1 Thank you.

2 Q. What did Maxwell sound like?

3 A. She had a British accent and she was well-spoken and

4 articulate. And she was enthusiastic in greeting me and

a speaking with me.

6 Q. Annie, had you wanted to go to New Mexico at the time?

7 A. No, I was not eager to go to New Mexico.

8 Q. What, if anything, made you feel more comfortable about

9 going to New Mexico?

10 MS. MENNINGER: Objection. Hearsay, your Honor.

11 THE COURT: I'm going to overrule here and I'll adopt
12 a limiting instruction.

13 MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor.

14 A. I had been told that Maxwell would be in New Mexico with

15 Epstein; and so that made me feel more comfortable. Basically,
16 after what had happened in the movie theater in New York, I did
17 not want to be alone with him. But I thought that Ghislaine

18 was his romantic partner, and I didn't think he would do

19 anything like that while they were together.
20 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I think we need to say who
2l told her that.
22 THE COURT: Okay. You may ask and then I'll give the
23 instruction.
24 Q. Who told you that?
25 A. I was told by my mother.
