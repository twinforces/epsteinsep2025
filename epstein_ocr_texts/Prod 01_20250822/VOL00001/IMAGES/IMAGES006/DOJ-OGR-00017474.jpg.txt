3 you to the two guest bedrooms on the right side of the trailer.
4 Q. Were the guest bedrooms next to each other or how were they
5 set up?

12 A. On occasion I have slept there.
13 Q. Where did you sleep, in one of the guestrooms?

15 Mr. Epstein was on the ranch. It was before I built my home,
16 so I was able to spend the time at the lodge. We're going
17 really back far.
18 Q. But eventually, and I think maybe it was in the 2000s or
19 so, Epstein gave you some land; is that right?
20 A. That's correct.

22 that you could build a house; isn't that right?
23 A. That's correct.
24 Q. And he didn't charge you for that land?
25 A. No, he did not.
