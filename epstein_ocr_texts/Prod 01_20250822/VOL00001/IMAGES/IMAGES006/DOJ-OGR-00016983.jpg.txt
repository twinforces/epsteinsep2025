1 one moment.

2 Oh, and we'll again change, on line 23, page 49, the

3 word "reads" to "alleges."

4 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.

S THE COURT: Okay. Next.

6 MR. EVERDELL: Same page, page 50, your Honor,

7 line 18, just going back, these are overt acts with respect to
8 Count Five.

9 THE COURT: Mm-hmm.

10 MR. EVERDELL: The third one, which begins on line 17,
11 between -- oh, yes. "Between in or about 2001 and in or about
12 2004, Epstein's employees, including at times Maxwell, sent

13 Carolyn gifts, including lingerie, etc." I don't think there's
14 any evidence in the record that Maxwell sent any gifts. In

15 fact, I think the FedEx records show that it wasn't Maxwell

16 sending anything. I don't think there's any testimony in the
17 record that Maxwell was sending the gifts, so I think that

18 should be excluded.

19 MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine, your Honor. This is what
20 the grand jury charged, but that is fine, given the state of
2l the record.
22 THE COURT: Okay.
23 MR. ROHRBACH: But to be clear, the government is fine
24 with including the clause -- cutting the clause "including at
25 times Maxwell."
