one moment.
Oh, and we'll again change, on line 23, page 49, the
word "reads" to "alleges."
MR, EVERDELL; Yes, your Honor,

THE COURT: Okay. Next.

MR, EVERDELL: Same page, page 50, your Honor,

line 18, Just going back, ‘thesé are overt acts with respect to
Count. Fave.
THE COURT: ‘Mm-hmm.

MR, EVERDELL: The third one, which begins on-line L/,
between == oh, yes. "Between in 6f about. 2001 and in or about
2004, Epstein's employees, including at tames Maxwell, sent
Carolyn gifts, inéluding lingérie, eté." I ddén't. think there's
any evidence in the record that Maxwell sent any gifts. In
fact, I think the FedEx récords show that it wasn't Maxwéll
sending anything. I don't thank there's any testamony in ‘the
record that Maxwell was sénding the gifts, so I think that
should be excluded.

MR. ROHRBACH: That's fine, your Honér. This is. what
the grand jury charged, but that is fine, given the state of
the record.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. ROHRBACH: But t6 be clear, the government is fine
with including the clause -- cutting the clause “ineluding at
times. Maxwell."
