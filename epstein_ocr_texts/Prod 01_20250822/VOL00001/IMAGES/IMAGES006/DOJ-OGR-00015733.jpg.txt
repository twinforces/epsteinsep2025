GROOMING & GUEST RELATIONS
Appearance is extremely important if high standards are to be maintained. A favorable
first impression goes a long way. Personal cleanliness, good presentation, and a genuine
and polite “aim to please” approach are very important.

* Try and anticipate the needs of Mr Epstein, Ms M axwell and their guests.

* Make guests feel pampered and welcome.

* Always address guest by their name, (eg: Mr Smith or Ms Smith)

* Do not discuss personal problems with guests.

* Becautious of voice levels and noise while working in rooms, kitchen and
hallways.

* Unobtrusive is the key.

* Remember that you see nothing, hear nothing, say nothing, except to answer a
question directed at you. Respect their privacy.

* Use your judgment when conveying information to Mr Epstein. If the matter is
not urgent, leave a note for him, clearly stating what it is you need to know.

* Wear the appropriate clothing while Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests are
in residence. Dark blue trousers with white golf shirts to be worn daily, long
sleeve white shirts for dinner service.

* Items in pockets must not create a bulge or be visible.

* Do not address Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests with your hands in your
pockets.

* Do not eat or drink in front of Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests. Do not
chew gum.

* When you are attending to Mr Epstein, Ms Maxwell and their guests, cellular
phones must be placed on “vibrate.” At no time should these phones “ring.”

* Avoid using strong perfume or aftershave lotion. This could cause an allergic
reaction.

* Channel all questions and concerns through the Estate Manager.
