Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 761 Filed 08/10/22 Page 151 of 246 2446
LCGCmax4 Loftus — direct

1 THE COURT: So what else beyond that?

2 MS. STERNHEIM: There is the statement that Kate told
3 him that the case against Ms. Maxwell was getting stronger

4 because the women were strengthening their stories.

S THE COURT: Okay. Mr. Rohrbach.

6 MR. ROHRBACH: So a few concerns about this one, your
7 Honor. This one sort of doesn't attempt to be a quotation from
8 Kate, so we don't know the sense in which it's going to be

9 viewed with mental impressions from. Mr. Hamilton is not a

10 statement that Kate was asked about on cross examination.

11 THE COURT: Pause on that point. Tell me the legal

12 basis for the pertinence of that.

13 MR. ROHRBACH: Well, to the extent that they are -- I
14 guess if they're offering it solely to show bias or motive,

15 then that wouldn't be necessary. If they're offering it as an
16 inconsistent statement with her other statements that she did
17 give on direct, that would not be available since they didn't
18 challenge her with a statement.

19 THE COURT: This is why I keep asking what's the
20 framework, because --
21 MR. ROHRBACH: If this is the bias framework again, it
22 wouldn't matter —-
23 THE COURT: Is that the same contention?
24 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes, Judge.
25 THE COURT: So then we have the 401 question.
