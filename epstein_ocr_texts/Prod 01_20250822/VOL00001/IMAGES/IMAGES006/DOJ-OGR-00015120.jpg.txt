and who are still alive today,
significantly outweigh any historical interest that the public has in reviewing these materials.
For these reasons, the grand jury materials related to should
remain sealed.
3In Craig, the Second Circuit lists nine “non-exhaustive” factors that a trial court should consider when deciding
whether to unseal grand jury materials because of “special circumstances.” Jd. at 106.
