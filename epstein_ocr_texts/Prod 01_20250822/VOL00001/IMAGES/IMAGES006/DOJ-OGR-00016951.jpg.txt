1 different statute, it's quite a different statute. It's the

2 production of child pornography statute. And also, the

3 question in Broxmeyer was somewhat different. It was a

4 sufficiency of the evidence question about whether the

5 government's evidence showed that the persuasion or inducement
6 occurred before the production of the child pornography, and so

8 like, form of causal nexus that's required between

9 "oersuasion," "inducement," or "coercion" and the travel

10 itself. I think the jury will be confused by an instruction

11 along those lines because it suggests that some amount of

12 causation is required above the inherent causation in the

13 statutory terms of inducement or enticement. Those are words
14 of causation, but they are sort of words of causation in the

15 plain and ordinary sense and not in any greater or more

16 Significant sense that I think a further instruction on that

17 point would suggest.

20 this is simply -- the opinion is simply explaining what is
21 required by those words, "persuasion,â„¢ "inducement,"
22 "enticement," and those words are the exact same words that are
23 used in the statute, so I don't think the context of the case
24 really matters in terms of what those words mean. There may be
25 some inherent causation built into these words, but this is
