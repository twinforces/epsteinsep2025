LEKVMAX2 Summations - Ms. Moe

SO in this éSsay, here's, how Maxwell described, her
relationship with Jeffrey Epstein: Jeffrey and Ghislaine have
been together, a couple, for the last eleven years. They are,
contrary to what many people think, rarely apart. I almost

always Seé them together. Jeffrey and Ghislaine complement

each other really well, and I cannot remember one without the
other. On top of being gréat partners, they aré also the best
of friends.

A Gouple for é@léeven years. Great partners. Rarély
apart. Best of friends. Does that soqund like a personal
assistant, conipartmentalized from Jeffrey Epstein's life? Of

Close partners who operated, together. And, ladies and
gentlémen, whén you're with someone for eleven years, you khow
what they like. Epstein liked underage girls. He Jiked to
touch undéragé girls. Maxwell knew it.

Make no mistake. Maxwell was crucial to the whole
schemé. Epstéin Gould hot have déne this alone. A single
middle-aged man who invites a teenage girl to visat Ais ranch,
to come to his house, to fly to New York, is Creepy. That séts
off alarm bells. But when, that man is accompanied by a posh,.
sitiling, réspéctable, age=appropriate woman, that's when
everything starts to seem legitimate. And when that woman.
encourages those girls to massage that man, when she acts Like
