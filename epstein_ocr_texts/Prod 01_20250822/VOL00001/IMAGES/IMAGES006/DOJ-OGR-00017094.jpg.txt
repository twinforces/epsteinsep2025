LEKVMAX4 Summation, - Ms. Moe

Finally, I also expect the defense will maké arguments
te you. about property records in London, Those all came in by
stipulation on Friday. They'll say that Maxwell didn't live at
44 Kinnerton Street in. 1994, when. Kate met her; and. that she
lived -- that Maxwell lived ‘in another hotise nearby tin, London.
But that's just another distraction and here's why:

Maxwell herself testified whder oath in a 2019

deposition, here it is, that she had lived at 44 Kinnerton

Street since 1992 or 1993. So either the defendant lived ‘there

the whole time or she mixed. up. her two London. houses and Kate
did t6o. Eithér way, it just. doesn't matber,.

SQ next, the defense has argued to you that, Jane and
Kate and Carolyn and Annie aré all lying. The défense has
asked ‘you to believe that. Jane and Kate and, Annie and Carolyn,
that they are all lying for méney. But n6éne of that. makés any
sense when, you, look at at closely. It doesn't make any sense
when you look at the evidence.

Now, all. four women have testified that, they submitted
Claims to the Jeffrey Epstein Victim Compensation Program.
They were awarded millions of dollars. And, that, happened well
before this trial. Their civil lawsuits are 6ver. Thosé cases
ane done and the witnesses don't get. anything out of testifying

at this trial. They were clear in their testimony. They havé

no financial stake in the otttcome of this trial. None.

And one of the other ways you. know the witnesses
