LCKVMAX4 Summation — Ms. Moe

1 Finally, I also expect the defense will make arguments
2 to you about property records in London. Those all came in by
3 stipulation on Friday. They'll say that Maxwell didn't live at
4 44 Kinnerton Street in 1994, when Kate met her; and that she

5) lived -—- that Maxwell lived in another house nearby in London.
6 But that's just another distraction and here's why:

7 Maxwell herself testified under oath in a 2019

8 deposition, here it is, that she had lived at 44 Kinnerton

9 Street since 1992 or 1993. So either the defendant lived there
10 the whole time or she mixed up her two London houses and Kate
11 did too. Either way, it just doesn't matter.

12 So next, the defense has argued to you that Jane and
13 Kate and Carolyn and Annie are all lying. The defense has

14 asked you to believe that Jane and Kate and Annie and Carolyn,
15 that they are all lying for money. But none of that makes any
16 sense when you look at it closely. It doesn't make any sense
17 when you look at the evidence.

18 Now, all four women have testified that they submitted
19 claims to the Jeffrey Epstein Victim Compensation Program.
20 They were awarded millions of dollars. And that happened well
al before this trial. Their civil lawsuits are over. Those cases
22 are done and the witnesses don't get anything out of testifying
23 at this trial. They were clear in their testimony. They have
24 no financial stake in the outcome of this trial. None.
25 And one of the other ways you know the witnesses
