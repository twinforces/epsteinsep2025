Dear Jeffrey:
I have talked to you and Ghislaine on several occasions to
Say thank you. But, I wanted to express in writing my
personal and professional gratitude for the very generous
gift 9f $200,000 for a new scholarship lodge. It is truly
an extraordinary sture.
I thought an update would be appropriate at this time.

1. The contract with Town and Country has been
executed and they have scheduled construction of
the lodge.

2. We are waiting for the temperature to rise above
10-15 degrees so that we can move the
existing buildings and set the foundation. (The
June target date remains at this time.) Design
and construction of the exterior walls is
underway.

3. You have approved the latest set of drawings with
the basement entrance as indicated and approved
the green roof which works for us as well.

4. We are requesting furniture packages from local
vendors that will be both aesthetic and functional
for a rental lodge. When we receive the packages
and corresponding quotes, we will send them on to
Ghislaine for her comments and suggestions.

5. We anticipate setting aside all lodge income in
the 1994 Camp season and placing the net income in
an endowment fund so that subsequent repairs,
maintenance and furniture replacement are funded
through the endowment. All succeeding income will
be placed into the Jeffrey Epstein Scholarship
