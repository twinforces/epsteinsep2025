LCKCmax3 Summation — Ms. Moe

1 what had happened on that trip.

2 Here's Janice Swain's testimony about that. She told
3 you that Annie said, I don't want to talk about it, I'm just

4 not going to let it ruin my life.

S But not long after this happened, Annie told her high
6 school boyfriend what Maxwell and Epstein had done. She told

7 him about meeting Maxwell on the trip to New Mexico.

8 You heard from David Mulligan at this trial. Here's

9 his testimony about what Annie told him. She said that Maxwell
10 was very charming, very pretty, she greeted her when she

11 arrived, and I remember that they had a day around town where
12 Maxwell took her shopping. He even remembered that Annie said
13 that Maxwell had bought her cowboy boots. But most

14 importantly, Annie told him that Maxwell had given her a

15 massage and touched her breasts.

16 Here's his testimony about that. He remembered what
17 Annie told him, that Maxwell had touched her, that she had

18 touched her breasts during the massage, and in 2006, Annie told
19 the FBI the same thing.
20 Here's her testimony about that. She told them about
21 Maxwell in 2006 — 15 years ago. That's one of the many ways
22 that you know that Annie is telling the truth. She has been
23 consistently describing since the 1990s what Maxwell did to
24 her, and what Maxwell did to Annie is powerful evidence of her
25 guilt.
