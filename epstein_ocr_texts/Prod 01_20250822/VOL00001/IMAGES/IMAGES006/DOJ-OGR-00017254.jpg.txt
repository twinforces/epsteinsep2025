What iS an inference? What does, it mean to infer
something? An inference is not a suspicion or a guess. It is
a reasoned, logical décision to conéltide that a disputed fact

exists based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.

There aré times when different inferences may be drawn
from. different. facts, whether proved by direct ‘or

Circtimstantial, evidence. The government asks 'you 'to draw one

set of inferences. while the defense asks you to draw another.
Tt is! for yot’ and 'you dlone to décide what inferences, 'you will
draw. The process ‘of drawing inferences from facts in. evidence
1s not, a mattér of guesswork 6r speculatidn. Ah inference is a
deduction or a conclusion that you, the juny, are permitted, but
not réquiréd to draw from the facts that Have been established
by either direct on cincumstantial evidence.

In drawing inferences, you should exercise your Gorimon
sense. Therefore, while you're considering the evidence

presented to you, you may draw from the facts that you find to

be proven. such reasonable inferences as would be justified ,in

light. of your experience. Some inferences, however, are

impermissible. You may not infer ‘that Ms. Maxwell ds guilty of

participating in Criminal conduct if you find merély that she
was present at ‘the time the crime was being committed and had
knowledge that. it was being coémttitted. N6r may you use
evidence that I instructed ‘you was admitted for a limited
purpose for any inference beyond that limited purpose.
