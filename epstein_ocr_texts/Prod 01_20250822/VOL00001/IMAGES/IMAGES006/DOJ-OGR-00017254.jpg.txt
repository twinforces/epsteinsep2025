1 What is an inference? What does it mean to infer

2 something? An inference is not a suspicion or a guess. It is

3 a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact

4 exists based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.

5 There are times when different inferences may be drawn

6 from different facts, whether proved by direct or

7 circumstantial evidence. The government asks you to draw one

8 set of inferences while the defense asks you to draw another.

9 It is for you and you alone to decide what inferences you will
10 draw. The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence
11 is not a matter of guesswork or speculation. An inference is a
12 deduction or a conclusion that you, the jury, are permitted but
13 not required to draw from the facts that have been established
14 by either direct or circumstantial evidence.

15 In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common
16 sense. Therefore, while you're considering the evidence
17 presented to you, you may draw from the facts that you find to
18 be proven such reasonable inferences as would be justified in
19 light of your experience. Some inferences, however, are
20 impermissible. You may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of
al participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she
22 was present at the time the crime was being committed and had
23 knowledge that it was being committed. Nor may you use
24 evidence that I instructed you was admitted for a limited
25 purpose for any inference beyond that limited purpose.
