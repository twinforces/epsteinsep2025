2 MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor.

3 This information is being asked not for the truth of
4 the matter being asserted, but for her state of mind for what
5 was in her mind at the time that she was going to New Mexico,
6 why she felt comfortable, why she felt more comfortable going
7 to this trip. It's not being offered for the truth of the

8 matter; it's being offered for what her state of mind was when
9 she was going on this trip to New Mexico.

10 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, this is backdoor hearsay.
11 THE COURT: It is backdoor hearsay.

12 You can ask her about going on the trip, why she went
13 and why she was comfortable. But to the extent you're

14 eliciting -- which you clearly are -- hearsay as to what her
15 mother told her about who would be there, objection sustained.
16 MS. POMERANTZ: Okay.

17 MS. MENNINGER: Her mother is testifying; so if

18 there's a conversation between Epstein and her mother, I

19 understand that that would perhaps come in through the mother.
20 THE COURT: Right.
21 MS. POMERANTZ: Okay. Thank you, your Honor.
22 THE COURT: Counsel, the other thing you can say is
23 after you had your conversation with your mother, did you then
24 go to New Mexico. And again, you can ask her about her own
25 experience, but not elicit the hearsay of what her mother told
