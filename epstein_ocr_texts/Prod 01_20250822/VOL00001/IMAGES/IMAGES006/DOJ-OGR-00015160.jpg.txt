9. Additional Need for Maintaining Secrecy in the Case in Question

The Government identifies under this factor the privacy interests of victims and third
parties referenced in the grand jury materials. Jd. The Government proposes to redact their
names and other personally identifying information. On the Court’s review, the proposed
redactions would satisfactorily do so. This factor is neutral.

10. Perspectives of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Victims

The Court has received, and reviewed with care and great respect, letters on behalf of
numerous victims of Epstein and Maxwell. See Dkts. 804, 806. Their letters address whether
the Maxwell grand jury materials should be disclosed. They also express broader concerns about
recent Government actions with respect to Maxwell and the Epstein-Maxwell investigation.

public disclosure of the grand jury transcripts, and further state that all Epstein-related
information and documents in the possession and control of law enforcement, prosecutorial[, ]
and other government agents and entities should be fully disclosed.”).

This factor therefore favors unsealing. But there is an important qualification. The
