LCACmax3 A. Farmer â€” cross

1 THE COURT: Let me just talk to the record for a

2 moment.

3 I retract that I'm only admitting the single page of

4 AFl as AF1l. Instead, I am temporarily admitting under seal a

5) seven-page document marked as AF1l. Counsel will work out

6 limited redactions. We'll turn that into a public document

7 with limited redactions.

8 Go ahead.

9 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor.

10 BY MS. MENNINGER:

11 Q. So I just wanted to ask you, in this journal entry, you

12 wrote about going to a ski cabin and going cross country

13 skiing; right?

14 A. Yeah. I'm sorry. I think I got lost. Are we back in the
15 binder now?

16 Q. You can testify from memory right now. If you need to look
17 at it, we can show it to you again.

18 A. Okay.

19 Q. But you, I believe, would recall that you wrote about going
20 to a cross country skiing cabin?
2l A. Yes.
22 Q. And you also wrote about going to see a movie or watching a
23 movie while you were in that cabin, and the name of the movie
24 was Sleuth?
25 A. Okay. Yes.
