5. ‘How Long Ago the Grand Jury Proceedings Took Place:
The Second Circuit has instructed:

in ‘several ways. “First, if historical interest i ina, specific case’ has persisted over a
number of'years, that serves as an. important: indication that the ‘public’s interest ‘in
release of the information. is substantial. (Hence the hypothcticals involving John
Wilkes Booth and.Aaron Burr.)'” Second, the: passage: of time crodes many of'the
justifications. for continued secrecy. See Douglas Oil [Co. v. Petrol Stops
Northwest,441 U.S. 221,,.222 (1979)] (noting that the interests in grand jury secrecy
are reduced ‘after the grand jury has ended.its activities). Third, 'the*passage: of time
eventually, and inevitably, brings about the death. of the principal. partics involved.
in the investigations, as'well.as that of'thcir:imimediate families. And'the.continucd
existence and. vulnerability of such. parties is, of itsclf, a factor that a court should
consider.

Td. at.107 (footnote added).

This factor presents countervailing considerations. On the one hand, 20-30 years have
passed.sinec Maxwell, (and Epstcin):committed the crimes ‘for which they were charged. (The
conduct for'which Maxwell was convicted spaniied 1994 to 2004.)

On the other hand, the grand jurics that-indicted Maxwell met approximately’ five years
ago. Maxwell’s trial occurred under four years ago. Her‘conviction remains, on, dircct.appcal.
And-numcrous: victims: of Epstein and Maxwell are still alive. These: circumstances starkly:

Scé; @.g., id..at 100 (1948 testimony); Jn re National Security Archive,'104. F. Supp. 3d at 626
(1950 testimony); Jn. re.AHA, 49. F. Supp..2d at.277-78 (1947-1950 testimony); see also note 12,
supra, (citing similar D.D.C. cases). But see In re Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 492-93 (testimony less

than,two ‘years carlicr).

'? The Circuit, in illustrating carlicr in. its opinion why historical or public interest considerations
could justify the release of g grand jury information, stated: “To the extent that the John Wilkes
Booth or Aaron Burr conspiracies, for example, led.to grand jury investigations, historical,
interest might by now overwhelm any continued need for secrecy.” Jd. at 105.
