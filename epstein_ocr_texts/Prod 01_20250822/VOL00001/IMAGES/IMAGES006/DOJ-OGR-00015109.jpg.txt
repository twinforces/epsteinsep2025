; RE: Crime Victims’ Rights Act Implications Regarding Unsealing of Grand Jury
Materials in Maxwell Proceedings
Case: USA v Maxwell
Case No.: 1:20-cr-00330 (PAE)
Dear Judge Engelmayer:
We represent numerous survivors of Jeffrey Epstem and Ghislaine Maxwell, including individuals
whose names and identifymg mformation appear m the subject materials and one woman who
testified at Ghislame Maxwell’s criminal trial. Many of these victims placed immense personal and
emotional trust in the federal justice system, with the belief that the conviction of Ms. Maxwell finally
represented a measure of accountability. Most view that conviction as the only justice they ever
received from the criminal justice system.
In that vein, we write to address the Department of Justice’s request to unseal grand jury materials
and to respectfully urge the Court to administer any disclosure in a manner that fully honors the :
victims’ rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (““CVRA”), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, the enduring
interests protected by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e), and Eleventh Circuit precedent.
I. Victims’ CVRA Rights Are Directly Implicated and Must Be Considered in Context—
Not in a Vacuum
‘The CVRA guarantees victims:
‘ e The right to be reasonably protected from the accused (§ 3771(a)(1));
DOJ-OGR-00015109
