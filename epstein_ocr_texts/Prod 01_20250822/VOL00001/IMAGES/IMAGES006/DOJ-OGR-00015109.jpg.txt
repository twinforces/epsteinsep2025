Dear Judge Engelmayer:

whose names.and. identifying information appear im the subject materials and one woman who
testified at Ghislaine Maxwell’s criminal trial. Maniy of thesé victims placed. immense. personal and
émotional trustiii the federal justice.system, with the belief that the-conviction of Ms. Maxwell finally

represented a measure of accountability. Most view that conviclion as the only justice. they ever
received, from the criminal justice system.

In, that vein; we write ‘to. address the Deépartinént of Justice’s request to iséal. grand: jliry materials
and to respec tfully urge: the Court to administer any disclosure ina ‘manner that fully honors the
vicims” rights ‘under the Crime Victims” Rights Act (“CVRA”), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, the. enduring
interests protected, sby-Federal Rule of. Criminal Procedure 6(e), and;Fleventh. Gircuit, precedent:

I. Victims’ CVRA. Rights Are Directly Implicated. and. Must Be Considered in Context—

“The CVRA._ guarantees vicims:
