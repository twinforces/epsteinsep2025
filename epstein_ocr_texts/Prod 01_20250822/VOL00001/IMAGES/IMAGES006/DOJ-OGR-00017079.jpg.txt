LCKCmax3 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 you that the defendant is guilty on Count Two.

2 Now let's talk about Count Four, it's transportation

3 of an individual under age 17 to engage in illegal sexual

4 activity. And again, this count is about Jane.

5 The first element is that the defendant knowingly

6 transported Jane in interstate commerce. Here we're talking

7 about the travel itself. The last count we looked at was about
8 enticement to travel, this one is about the travel itself.

9 We've already talked about how Jane was transported to New

10 York, and for this count, all that's required is that the

11 defendant was actively engaged, either personally or through an
12 agent, in making travel arrangements, or that she aided and

13 abetted Epstein.

14 THE COURT: Ms. Moe, closer to the mic, please.

15 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

16 Maxwell did not need to physically transport Jane

17 herself or even be present for transportation, but again, Jane
18 told you that Maxwell helped with her travel arrangements and
19 that Maxwell was on flights with Jane. Juan Alessi confirmed
20 that. The flight records confirm that.
al The second element here is that the defendant
22 transported Jane with the intent that Jane would engage in
23 sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a
24 criminal offense under New York law. We've already talked
25 about this one and how the evidence conclusively proves that
