I. Motion to Unseal the Maxwell Grand Jury Materials

On July 18, 2025, the Deputy Attorney General (“DAG”) filed a three-and-a-half-page
motion to unseal the grand jury transcripts in this case. Dkt. 785 (“Motion to Unseal’”’).’ The
motion stated:

On July 6, 2025, the [DOJ] and [FBI] issued a memorandum describing an

exhaustive review undertaken of investigative holdings relating to Jeffrey Epstein

(the “Memorandum”). The Memorandum detailed the steps taken by the [DOJ]

and [FBI] to determine whether evidence existed that could predicate an

investigation into uncharged third parties. As the Memorandum concluded, no such

evidence was uncovered during the review.

Since July 6, 2025, there has been extensive public interest in the basis for the

Memorandum’s conclusions. While the [DOJ] and [FBI] continue to adhere to the

conclusions reached in the Memorandum, transparency to the American public is

of the utmost importance to this Administration. Given the public interest in the

investigative work conducted by the [DOJ] and [FBI] into Epstein, the [DOJ]

moves the Court to unseal the underlying grand jury transcripts in [United States v.

Maxwell and] United States v. Epstein, subject to appropriate redactions of victim-

related and other personal identifying information.

Id. (citation omitted).* The motion noted that the Second Circuit has recognized that, in “special
circumstances,” release of grand jury records may be appropriate even where not authorized by
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e). /d. at 3 (citing Jn re Petition of Craig, 131 F.3d 99,
102 (2d Cir. 1997)) (“In re Craig”).

On July 22, 2025, after the case was reassigned to this judge, Dkt. 786, the Court issued

the Government, by July 29, 2025, to file a memorandum addressing the factors identified in Jn

States v. Epstein, 19 Cr. 490 (RMB) (S.D.N.Y. July 18, 2025), Dkt. 61.
