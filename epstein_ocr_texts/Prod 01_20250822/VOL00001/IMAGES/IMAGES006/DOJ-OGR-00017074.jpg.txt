1 Maxwell delivered Kate to Epstein.

2 In 1995 and 1996, Maxwell was still in contact with

3 Kate, encouraging Kate to travel to see her and Epstein, and in
4 that same period, Maxwell was traveling with Jane, still

5 exploiting Jane, in Palm Beach, in New York, and in New Mexico.
6 And in the spring of 1996, Annie Farmer went to New

13 and Epstein on Epstein's private jet. And in 2001, Virginia

14 Roberts was still 17 and still flying on the jet with Maxwell
15 and Epstein. They were flying around with a teenage girl.

16 In 2001, Virginia brought Carolyn to the Palm Beach

18 Maxwell and Epstein, and that was the beginning of the pyramid
