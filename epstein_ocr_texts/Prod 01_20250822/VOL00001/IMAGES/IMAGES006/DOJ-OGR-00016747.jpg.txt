1 five full days, including three business days. They had extra
2 days' notice that we were going to rest on Friday of last week,
3 and they had plenty of time in advance of trial to plan for

4 this. So we strongly disagree with the suggestion that defense
5 counsel has been unduly rushed here.

6 MS. MENNINGER: I can go back and forth on this, as

7 well, your Honor.

8 THE COURT: We're not going to go back and forth. The
9 record is what it is. There was a five-day, three-business-â€”day
10 break between the close of the government's case. The record
11 will reflect when you learned when the government will likely
12 rest, the record will reflect what you said regarding when you
13 learned of a nonresponsive witness, and the record will reflect
14 that I will take an application within a half an hour with an
15 opportunity for the government to respond all in the interest
16 of conforming to my standard practice, which is everybody has
17 their next witness or be prepared to rest or bring ina

18 different witness.

19 Now, wetll take it as it comes. What I'm learning,
20 what is new information to me today, which is different than
al yesterday, when we knew when I was informed that the defense
22 would rest today with the exception of some small issue or
23 document that Ms. Menninger put aside. There is no argument
24 about a subpoenaed witness who is nonresponsive. There was no
25 suggestion of a need for a witness to fly in from England. So
