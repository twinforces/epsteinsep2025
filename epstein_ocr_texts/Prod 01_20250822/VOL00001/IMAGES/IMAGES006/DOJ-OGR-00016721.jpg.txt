LCGVMAX7 Hyppolite - direct

1 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. I think we can take
2 the same chart we have both been working off of and just

3 eliminate the ones that are no longer -- or somehow with color
4 indicate the ones that are still in dispute.

a THE COURT: Yes. Or give me a new chart with the ones
6 that are in dispute and each just very briefly state each

7 side's position.

8 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.

9 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: Okay. The only other thing -- oh, right.
11 So I gave you till 6 o'clock on what I didn't recall
12 at the time. It was your response on the remaining witness. I
13 sort of staggered the response time on the motion to preclude
14 based on when we thought we would have witnesses.

15 So who remains in dispute who will be called tomorrow?
16 MS. MENNINGER: I think there were Eva, Michelle, and
17 Kelly. I think Mr. Lopez, I believe, we're not calling.

18 MR. EVERDELL: That's right, your Honor.

19 MS. MENNINGER: So that one is no longer in dispute.
20 THE COURT: Okay. So you said Eva, Michelle, and
21 Kelly.
22 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: So they will be called tomorrow if they
24 are not precluded.
25 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor. I believe so.
