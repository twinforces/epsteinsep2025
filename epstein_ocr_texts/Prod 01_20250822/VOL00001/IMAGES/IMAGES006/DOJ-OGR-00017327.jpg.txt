1 instruction. Clearly they are making an error concerning which
2 state begins with "New." And I suggest that if the Court

3 wishes to refer them to the charge, the Court also clears up

4 the fact that Count Four requires a violation of New York law,
5 not New Mexico law.

6 THE COURT: That's certainly why we should refer them
7 to the whole charge. That's what lines 7 through 10 make

8 clear.

9 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

10 The only illegal sexual activity identified in the

11 entirety of the jury charge is a statute in New York. There

12 cannot be any risk of confusion on that score. This particular
13 charge reminds the jury of that and includes that language as
14 well. The jury has not been charged about any laws in New

15 Mexico; so there can't be any risk of confusion for exactly

16 that reason.

17 MR. EVERDELL: I just don't understand the confidence
18 about how there can be no possible confusion --

19 THE COURT: This conversation is stopping.
20 My decision is to refer them back to this charge,
21 because it iS a proper instruction on the second element to
22 Count Four. I do not know what this question means. It's too
23 difficult to parse factually and legally what they're asking.
24 So the only option in those circumstances is to direct them
25 back to the count.
