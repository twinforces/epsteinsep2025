state begins with "New." And I suggest that if the Court.

The enly illegal sexual activity identified in the
entirety of the jury Charge is a statute in Néw York. There
cannot be any tisk, of confusion on, that score. This particular
charge reminds the jury of that and inéludes that. languagé as
well. The jury has not been charged about any Jaws in New
Mexico6; so there Gan't be ahy risk of confusidn for éxactly

difficult to parse factually and legally what they'ré asking.
So the only option, in those circumstances is to direct them
back to the count.
