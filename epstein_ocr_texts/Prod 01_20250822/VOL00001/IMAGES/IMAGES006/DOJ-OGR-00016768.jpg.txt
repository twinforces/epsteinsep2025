1 THE COURT: How about this: I'll let you ask the

2 agent -- I suppose I'll hear from the government.

3 What is the time period of the allegations that she

4 investigated?

5) MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I think that the investigation
6 that this agent was the case agent for was much broader than

7 the charges here. And so it could lead to avenues that are not
8 appropriate for this trial and that are irrelevant to this

9 trial. And I think that your Honor's pretrial ruling was

10 crystal clear here that this is not appropriate direct

11 testimony by the defense.

12 Defense counsel, in almost every trial, stands up in
13 front of a jury and says, You didn't see this kind of evidence,
14 you didn't see DNA, you didn't see phone records. And they

15 don't need to put an agent on the stand to prove that negative.
16 They are able to make that argument without having to put on

17 that case through affirmative agent testimony, and the same is
18 true here.

19 THE COURT: You can certainly argue to the jury from
20 the indictment and what they are being instructed to determine
2l what the age of the allegations are.
22 MR. EVERDELL: Okay. I understand, your Honor.
23 As we're doing this, I think maybe we should raise a
24 few other points, since I don't want to violate the judge's
25 ruling.
