LBAAMAX 3ps Rocchio - Direct

evaluate patients who have delayed disclosing childhood sexual
abuse?

A. It's consistent with my peers and reports that I've read in
the clinical literature, yes.

Q. In your forensic practice, Nave ‘you dealt with
disclosure=related issues?

A. I have.

Q. Can you explain.

A. Disclosure-related issues in a forensic setting can come up

particularly, for example; when there are issues related to the
statute ef limitations. So in a recent case, I was asked to
evaluate the time at which an individual reasonably came to be
aware of a connection between their present difficulties or
potential connection betwéen their présent difficultiés and the
alleged abuse. And part of that case involved my looking at,
you know, weré thére dny reports made about the abuse at the
time, because I'm working with an adult who's alleging
something during childhood, and if §0 to whom and undér what
circumstances. And, you know, even if ‘the reports weren*t, made

at thé time of thé abuse, for example, did this pérson. talk

about their experiences with their ‘therapist or when they were
hospitalized. for substancé abuse, what did théy have to say.
So I'm looking at, what they disclosed, how they
disclosed it. I'm obviously; in a forensic sétting, comparing
that to what they're telling me now and with what the fact.
