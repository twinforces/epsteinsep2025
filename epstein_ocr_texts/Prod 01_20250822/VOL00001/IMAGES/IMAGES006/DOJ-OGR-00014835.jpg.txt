1 THE COURT: Thank you for your patience.

2 As I have stated, the guideline range applicable to

3 this case is 188 to 235 months' imprisonment.

4 Under the Supreme Court's decision in a case called

5 Booker and related cases, the guideline range is only one

6 factor that the Court must consider in deciding the appropriate
7 sentence. I am also required to consider the other factors set
8 forth in a provision called 18 U.S.C. 3553(a). These include

9 the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the history

10 and characteristics of the defendant; the need for the sentence
11 imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote
12 respect for the law, to provide just punishment for the

13 offense, to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, to
14 protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, to

15 provide needed educational, vocational training, medical care,
16 or other treatment. I am to take into account the kinds of

17 sentences available, as I have said, the guideline range, any
18 pertinent policy statement, the need to avoid unwarranted

19 sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who
20 have been found guilty of similar conduct, the need to provide
21 restitution as appropriate under the law to any victims of the
22 offense.
23 I am required to impose a sentence sufficient, but no
24 greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes I have just
25 described. I have given substantial thought and attention to
