1 MR. EVERDELL: You did.

2 THE COURT: Along with, I presume the government would
3 seek to introduce the testimony?

4 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

5) MR. EVERDELL: That's right, your Honor.

6 THE COURT: So a new witness —-—

7 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I did not anticipate that

8 the issue between ownership versus occupancy was going to be

9 such a relevant issue, and so given that that came up in the

10 course of discussing what the stipulation --

11 THE COURT: Just to be clear, I considered that as to
12 whether to allow you to introduce ownership documents. I'm

13 allowing you to introduce ownership documents. Arguably, they
14 were not relevant or marginally relevant, but a 403 issue

15 because of the complications of ownership. If you can put in
16 the ownership documents on stipulation as to the timing of

17 ownership, I'm allowing that. It's not a basis -—- because I

18 almost excluded it, but didn't, that's not a basis to call a

19 new witness.
20 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, the stipulation would allow
al us to put in the ownership documents and the Court itself
22 raised that there is an issue with residency or occupancy.
23 THE COURT: I raised that in questioning whether the
24 ownership documents were relevant. I'm allowing the ownership
25 documents in. That's not a basis to call a new witness.
