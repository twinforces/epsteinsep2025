Dear Judges Berman and Engelmayer:

The Government writes respectfully to respond to the Court’s orders, dated July 31, 2025,
directing the Government to provide additional information regarding grand jury materials the
Government has asked the Court to unseal in these cases. (Epstein Dkt. 67; Maxwell Dkt. 797).

In particular, on July 18, 2025, the Government moved the Court to unseal grand jury
transcripts from these cases, subject to appropriate redactions. (Epstein Dkt. 61; Maxwell
Dkt. 785). The Court directed the Government to provide supplemental briefing (Epstein Dkt. 63;
Maxwell Dkt. 789), which the Government submitted on July 29, 2025 (Epstein Dkt. 66; Maxwell
Dkt. 796). In addition, the Court set a schedule whereby the defendants and victims could set out
their positions on or before August 5, 2025. (Epstein Dkt. 63 at 3-4; Maxwell Dkt. 789 at 4).

On July 31, 2025, the Court directed the Government to provide additional information by
August 4, 2025, in particular, in the Epstein case, a letter:

1. Verifying the date(s) of all grand jury presentation(s) in this
case;
2. Providing all exhibits shown to grand jurors;
3. Stating whether the Government moves to unseal the grand
Jury exhibits as well as the transcripts;
