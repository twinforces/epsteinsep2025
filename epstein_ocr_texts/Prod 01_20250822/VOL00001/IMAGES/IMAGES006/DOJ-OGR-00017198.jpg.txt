LCKVMAX8 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey

1 MS. COMEY: Finally, there is this, frankly, desperate
2 suggestion that the FBI manipulated these witnesses; asked

3 leading questions to fit a narrative.

24 participated in it, witness after witness after witness must
25 have lied to you. Jane and Kate and Carolyn and Annie must
