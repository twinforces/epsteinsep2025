1 for testimony.

2 THE COURT: You can submit authority on that. I mean,
a certainly appropriate grounds for cross. I'm not sure, absent
4 some specific motion for discovery, that I've ever seen expert
5 time records turned over.

6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Understood, your Honor.

7 BY MR. PAGLIUCA:

8 Q. Dr. Rocchio, I'd like to talk to you about some of the

9 terms that you've been using here today. The first one I want
10 to ask you about is the definition of "child." Do you recall,
11 when you discussed this case with the government on April 9th
12 of this year, that you defined "child" for the government as

13 someone under the age of consent? Do you recall that?

14 A. I don't specifically recall that, no, I'm sorry.

15 Q. Is that a definition of "child," someone under the age of
16 consent?

17 A. I would -- I would define "child" as someone under the age
18 of 18.

19 Q. Well, I'm looking at page 3 of the interview notes produced
20 in connection with your interview on April 9, 2021.
21 THE COURT: Do you have a 3500?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA: I do, your Honor. I'm at page
ao 3502-004. That's the beginning of this interview, April 9,
24 2021. And if we go to -- well, that's the page 3 of that
25 interview. The top of the page.
