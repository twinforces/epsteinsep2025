1 Because I think -- as I said, I think that doesn't -- there's a
2 basis for it in the email; it doesn't require wading into

3 attorney-client privilege issues; and I think it gives the

4 defense what it's looking for, as would an inquiry, which would
iy be Limited, into what the attorney said to the client. I

6 haven't come to rest on how that's resolved, but I've indicated
7 I think it's a close call in light of the email I've seen.

8 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: So you'll confer.

10 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.

11 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

12 THE COURT: I have briefing currently on that issue.
13 So if you don't reach resolution, then I'll either -- I'll

14 resolve or tell you what additional steps I need in order to

15 resolve. If there are other issues that are similar, we should
16 probably talk about timing for briefing --

17 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: -- following conferral.

19 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
20 Is there a particular date upon which the Court would
21 like to receive briefing from the parties about any additional
22 privilege-related issues?
23 THE COURT: I'm fine for it to be discussed and then
24 fully briefed again sometime on Wednesday, if that works.
25 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
