LBTCMAX2 Opening -â€”- Ms. Pomerantz

1 and woman were predators. What Jane didn't understand then or
2 what you will learn at this trial was that this meeting was the
3 beginning of that man and woman targeting Jane for sexual abuse
4 that would last for years.

5 Jane was not their only victim. There were other

6 young girls, teenagers who the man and woman targeted for

7 sexual abuse. Who was that woman targeting young girls for

8 sexual abuse? It was the defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell.

9 The defendant took these girls on shopping trips,

10 asked them about their lives, their schools, their families.

11 She won their trust. She discussed sexual topics with them.

12 She helped normalize abusive sexual conduct. She put them at
13 ease and made them feel safe all so that they could be molested
14 by a middle-aged man.

15 She knew what was going to happen to those girls. The
16 defendant walked the girls into a room where she knew that man
17 would molest them, and there were times when she was in the

18 room when it happened, making it all feel normal and casual.

19 That is why we are here today, because between 1994
20 and 2004, the defendant sexually exploited young girls. She
21 preyed on vulnerable young girls, manipulated them, and served
22 them up to be sexually abused. The defendant was trafficking
23 kids for sex. That is what this trial is all about.
24 Ladies and gentlemen, this opening statement is the
25 government's opportunity to give you a roadmap of the evidence
