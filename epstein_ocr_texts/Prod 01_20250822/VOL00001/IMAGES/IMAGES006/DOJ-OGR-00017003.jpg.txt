1 So there is more than just the one witness who indicated that

2 she was going to invoke had the defense called her. There were
3 other co-conspirators who the government chose not to call, not
4 to immunize, and we couldn't possibly call in our defense

5 without -- because we can't give any immunity ourselves.

6 MR. ROHRBACH: Your Honor, this is true in basically

7 every conspiracy case and every gang case that is prosecuted in
8 this district. There are unindicted co-conspirators. Yet this
9 instruction is given and is the run-of-the-mill instruction, as
10 the Court said, in cases in this district.

11 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, if the Court is inclined to
12 give the instruction, I can propose an alternative.

13 THE COURT: I will take an alternative.

14 MR. EVERDELL: If we can just eliminate the language
15 in the title of the charge that says "equally available to both
16 sides" and just have "the uncalled witnesses."

17 I believe there's also language that says "equal

18 opportunity."

19 THE COURT: Or lack of opportunity.
20 MR. EVERDELL: Yes.
21 MR. ROHRBACH: This is the uncalled witness
22 instruction, your Honor. This is the instruction given,
23 suggested by Sand and given by this Court. I have five
24 examples right here where the Court has given this instruction.
25 THE COURT: As I say, it's always given, always
