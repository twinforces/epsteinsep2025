1 Q. You were asked some questions on direct about your contacts
2 with Jeffrey Epstein, so I want to ask you about some time

3 periods in particular.

4 Focusing on the time frame from 1994 to 2004, how

a often did you spend time in Jeffrey Epstein's house in Palm

7 A. Not that often. We live in New York City and we would only

9 Q. And when you say "not that often," can you explain for the
10 jury what kind of frequency we're talking about?

11 A. Very hard to say because there's so many years. But in

12 Palm Beach specifically?

13 Q. Yes, just focusing on Palm Beach from 1994 to 2004, how

14 often were you in that house in Palm Beach?

15 A. Maybe four times per year. It's hard -- I really can't

16 remember.

17 Q. Did you know what was going on in that house ona

18 day-to-day basis?

19 A. Absolutely not.
20 Q. I'm going to ask you just a few questions about what was
2l going on in your life during those years, focusing on the 1990s
22 and, in particular, between 1994 and 2000.
23 In 1994, were you living in Paris?
24 A. Yes, we were.
25 Q. And in 1995, your first child was born; is that right?
