1 to them and adopted it as their own memory. And that study was
2 published in 1978.

3 Q. Have you conducted any studies that have to do with

4 language and how language might affect memory?

a A. Yes. An example of that would be -- again, this is alsoa
6 fairly widely cited study.

7 We showed people a simulated accident. Afterwards, we
8 asked people about the speed of the vehicles involved in the

9 accident. But different witnesses are questioned in different
10 ways. So some witnesses are asked a question like, How fast

11 were the cars going when they smashed into each other? And

12 others are asked, How fast were the cars going when they hit

13 each other?

14 And we found that people estimated the speed as

15 greater if you used the word "smashed" than if you used the

16 word "hit." Also we had found that if we use the smash word,
17 this leading kind of biased word, it affected what other things
18 that people remembered. Our witnesses were more likely to

19 remember, for example, broken glass that didn't exist if we had
20 used that word smashed in questioning them.
21 So that's an example of what you're asking about, the
22 connection between language and memory.
23 Q. In the course of your research and experience, are you
24 aware of any experiments that have actually measured emotion
25 and its impact on memory?
