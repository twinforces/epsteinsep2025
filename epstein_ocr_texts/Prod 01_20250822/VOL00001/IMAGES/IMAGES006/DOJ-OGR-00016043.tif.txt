Dear Jeffrey:
On behalf of the Interlochen Board of Trustees, I have been asked
to convey our sincere and heartfelt appreciation for your very
generous gift of $200,000 for a scholarship lodge. As you have
requested, this soon to be constructed lodge will be handicapped
accessible and designed to meet the ADA requirements. This is
the first such facility on our campus.
We are pleased to accept and acknowledge your significant
commitment to Interlochen and to the students, parents and guests
who visit our campus each year.
You have set the standard for others in creating an aesthetically
pleasing and accessible new scholarship lodge here among the
pines of northern Michigan.
Warmest regards,
James L. Tolley
Chair, Board of Trustees
