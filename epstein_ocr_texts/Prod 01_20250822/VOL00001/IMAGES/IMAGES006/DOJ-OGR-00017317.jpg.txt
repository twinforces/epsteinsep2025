1 question because they haven't identified a flight here.

2 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think they've been fairly
3 clear. They say: If the defendant aided in the transportation
4 of Jane's return flight, but not the flight to New Mexico. The
5 only evidence we have of a flight to New Mexico with Jane is

6 the one in the flight logs, and it is a flight to New Mexico.

7 And so the return flight would be some other flight besides the
8 flight to New Mexico.

9 She is also alleged that -- and to be honest, I think
10 it was a little unclear what may have happened in New Mexico

11 based on her testimony; but if there was any illegal sexual

12 conduct, the flight to New Mexico, this is what they are

13 debating, because they say, but not the flight to New Mexico,
14 where/if the intent was for Jane to engage in sexual activity.
15 Okay. So it seems that the jury is deliberating or at
16 least trying to decide whether the flight to New Mexico was for
17 the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual activity. And they
18 are confused that the return flight that happens after that,

19 could that be the basis alone for a conviction on Count Four.
20 Answer is no, because that return flight is not for the purpose
al of illegal sexual activity.
22 MS. MOE: Your Honor, at the very least, the answer to
23 this can't be no, because a jury could infer intent to engage
24 in sexual conduct and the return of a flight in aiding and
25 abetting that.
