LERVMAXT.
guéstion beGatise they Kaven't identified a flight Here.

MR, EVERDELL: Your Honor, IL think they've been fairly
clear. They Say: Tf ‘the defendant aided in the transportation

of Jane's seturn flight, but not the flight to New Mexico. The

only evidence we have of a flight 'to New Mexico with Jane is

the one in the flight logs, and it is a flight to New Mexico,

And, so ‘the réturn flight would be somé other flight besides the
flight to New Mexico.

She is also alleged that -- and to be honest, I think
it was a little unclear what may have happened. -in. New Mexico
based oh Her testimony; but if there was any illegal sexual
conduct, the flight to New Mexico, this is what they are

debating, because they say, but not the flight to Néw Mexico,

where/if, the intent was fon Jane to engage in sexual activity.
Okay: So6 it. seéms that the jury is deliberating or at

least ‘trying to decide whether the ‘flaght. to New Mexico was for

the purpose of engaging in illegal séxual activity. And they
céuld that be the basis alohe for a Cénviction on Count Four.
Answer Js no, because that return flight is not for the purpose
of illegal sexual activity.

MS. MOE: Your Honor, at. the very least, the answer to
this Gantt be no, because a jury Gould infer intent to engagé
in. sexual conduct, and the return of a flight in aiding and
abetting that.
