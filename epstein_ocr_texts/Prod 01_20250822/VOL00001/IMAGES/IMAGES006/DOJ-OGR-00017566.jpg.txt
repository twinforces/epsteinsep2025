LBUCmax5 Jane â€” direct

1 offered for the truth, it's being offered for the effect on the
2 listener. I would give the jury a limiting instruction that

3 the witness's testimony regarding what her mother said is not

4 being offered for the truth of those statements, but for the

5 impact or effect that it had on the witness. We'll keep it

6 limited, Ms. Moe, as to eliciting statements for an

7 out-of-court witness, but with that caveat.

8 And then tell me, Ms. Menninger, what your concern

9 down the road was so I have it in my head.

10 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, if you're admitting it

11 with that limiting instruction, I think we'll take up the

12 issues with other statements by the mom when they come up.

13 THE COURT: Okay.

14 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. Just to preview in
15 order to streamline things because we're on the subject, I

16 expect the next few questions to be about the issue of

17 disclosure. In particular, I expect to ask the witness whether
18 there was ever a time when she talked to a guidance counselor
19 when she was a kid and whether she came to learn that her
20 mother had found out that she talked to the guidance counselor,
al and I want to talk to her about how her mother reacted to that
22 and told her that she should never talk about what goes on in
23 their house.
24 We're offering that, again, not for the truth of
25 anything, it's certainly not our position that she shouldn't
