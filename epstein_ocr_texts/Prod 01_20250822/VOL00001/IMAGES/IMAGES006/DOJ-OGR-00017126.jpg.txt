LCKCmax5 Summation. - Ms. Menninger

came in and told you that ‘that is, what she told them back in
2019, and that's a core detail you're not likely to ferget if
At's trues

Let's take another example, whether there was ever

abuse in Néw México. Jané ‘told you, told ‘the government
repeatedly, ‘she had no specific recollection of abuse’ in New
México. So what’ did the government do? They kept asking Her
over and over again — remember, they're trying to prosecute a
case abolit. transportation dnd enticement to cross, State lines, —
are you ‘sure there was no evidence? There wag no abuse in. New
Mexico? I have no tiemory of abuse in New Mexico. Are you
sure? Maybe there was some abuse in New Mexico? And finally,
after they asked Her four times, she suddenly got. back a meniory
of abuse in New Mexico that she testified to here on the stand,
that shé Said someone came to get her, she doesn't know who,
and, that her heart sank when she was taken, to Epstein's room
for the abuse. That's not how memory works. That's
suggestion.

And clearly, for purposes of this case, the most.
important thing 1s what did, Ghislaine know about. what. was going
on, if anything, betweeh Jane and Jeffrey Epstein. Was she
ever in the room as the government told, you over and over? And,
when I asked hér, she, does hot recall if she was ever alone if
the room with Ghisld@ine and Jeffrey for any of the abuse.

And not only :does she not remember being in the room
