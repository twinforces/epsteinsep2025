LCKVMAX4 Summation — Ms. Moe

1 the facts of this case. And that's because those experiments

2 are nothing like what happened here. And Loftus was basically
3 forced to admit that on cross-examination.

4 Remember that study she described about telling people
5) that they were lost in a mall? Remember that she only was able
6 to trick 25 percent of the participants about that?

7 But, more importantly, another researcher then did a

8 follow-up study, and that researcher tried to implant two false
9 memories. She tried to implant the Lost-—in-the-mall story, and
10 also a story about an unpleasant bodily intrusion, a rectal

11 enema. Now, some people were tricked about getting lost in the
12 mall, but no one had a false memory about getting a rectal

13 enema. Why is that? Your common sense tells you that kind of
14 experience is the sort of thing you can't trick someone into

15 believing. You cannot suggest that. You can't make it up. A
16 rectal enema is the kind of thing you'd only remember if it

17 really happened, kind of like sexual abuse.

18 And again, Loftus basically had to admit this on

19 cross-examination. She said the core memory of trauma is
20 stronger than other types of memory. She admitted that.
al People might forget some of the peripheral details, but the
22 core of the traumatic event, those memories are much stronger.
23 You don't need a paid expert to tell you that, ladies and
24 gentlemen. It's just common sense. You remember something
25 like this.
