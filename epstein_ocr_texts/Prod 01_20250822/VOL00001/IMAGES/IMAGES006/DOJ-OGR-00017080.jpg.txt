LCKCmax3 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 Maxwell intended for Jane to be sexually abused on these trips.
2 I want to emphasize here that there is no requirement
3 that abuse in New York actually happened or that the defendant
4 was the one who committed the abuse. The crime is transporting
5 Jane with the intent that she will be abused.

6 Ladies and gentlemen, when Maxwell was helping arrange
7 travel for Jane, when she got on that plane with Jane, Maxwell
8 knew exactly what she was doing, and she knew exactly what

9 Epstein was going to do to Jane. The crime happened the moment
10 they crossed state lines. And to be very clear, when Epstein
11 flew Jane to New York and Maxwell aided and abetted him, that's
12 enough, too.

13 The last element is that the defendant knew Jane was
14 less than 17 years old. And you know that the defendant knew
15 that Jane was under 17, ladies and gentlemen, she met her at a
16 summer camo for kids. She was too young to drive. Maxwell

17 knew this girl for years, when she was 14 and 15 and 16. She
18 would talk to Jane where they would spend time together.

19 Maxwell absolutely knew that she was under 17.
20 And through all these elements, when we're talking
al about the defendant's knowledge and intent, I want you to think
22 about Kate. She told you about how the defendant asked her to
23 deliver tea to Epstein wearing a schoolgirl outfit. That is
24 striking evidence that Maxwell knew Jeffrey Epstein had a
25 sexual preference for schoolgirls. And after Kate delivered
