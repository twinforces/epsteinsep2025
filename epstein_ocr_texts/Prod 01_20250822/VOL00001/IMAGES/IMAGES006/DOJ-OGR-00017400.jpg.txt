1 obviously if you make a left turn, that would bring you into

2 the cockpit. You made a right turn, brought you into the

3 passenger compartment. And as soon as you got into the

4 passenger compartment, there were four large captain's chairs.
5 They were baseball glove leather in color. This aircraft hada
6 burgundy carpet. Once you get past the four chairs, you're

7 continuing walking to the rear of the aircraft. There was a

8 conference table to the right that had two chairs as well.

9 And then further aft, as you continue walking to the
10 back of the aircraft, there was a couch or a divan inside
11 there. And then once you went past the couch divan, there was
12 a galley or what you would call kitchen inside the aircraft.
13 And as you went further past that was the bathroom for the
14 aircraft. And then further back than that is the luggage
15 compartment.
16 Q. What, if any, barrier was there on this aircraft between
17 the pilots and the passengers?
18 A. Between the pilots and the passengers there was a door that
19 could be shut.
20 Q. And when you flew this plane for Mr. Epstein, was that door
al open or shut during flight?
22 A. We always had the door closed. It's much quieter with the
23 door closed as well.
24 Q. So were you able to observe what the passengers were doing
25 when you flew this plane?
