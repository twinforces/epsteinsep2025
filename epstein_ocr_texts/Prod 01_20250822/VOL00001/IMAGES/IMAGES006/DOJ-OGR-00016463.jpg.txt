LCAVMAX8

THE COURT: Okay.

MR, PAGLIUCA: But the problem is, you know, we have a
largér list that? we've needed to winnow down, given the fact
that the government has rested early and has not called a
significant numbér of witnessés.

We also have the problem of travel for this period of
time with somé of OUr witnesses. And we're confirming who's
available, And we have been confirming who's available and
who's, not available and when. And there may be the need to
substitute a different witness ‘on the same topic.

But what I expect to be able to do ténight is to send
the government what we believe our good-faith list is. And,

there will be some, T expect, adjustment to that as we move

along. But that."s eur anticipated goal hene, your Honor.
MS. MOE: Your Hénor, thé government warned the
defense multiple times this week that we would rest. The Court

ordered the défense to préducé these materials at. the

conclusion, of the government."s case, long before the trial.

And we Submit. the defense should do just that.

With mespect. to Rule 26 materials, especially given

that there are experts in this case, there should be Rulé 26
materials, including communications with experts, things like
contracts and payment materials. And if there were going to be
defense witnesses, any notes of interviews with those witnesses
are governed by Rule 26 and are subject to disclosure today.
