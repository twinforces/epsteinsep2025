LCKVMAX8 Charge

1 in mind particularly that questions put to witnesses â€”-

2 although they can provide the context -- the questions are not

3 themselves evidence. It's only the answers that are evidence.

4 I remind you also that nothing I have said during the

5 trial or will say during these instructions is evidence.

6 Similarly, the rulings I've made during the trial are not any

7 indication of my views of what your decision should be.

8 The evidence before you consists of the answers given
9 by the witnesses, and the exhibits and stipulations that were
10 received into evidence. If I have sustained an objection to a
11 question or told you to disregard testimony, the answers given
12 by a witness are no longer part of the evidence and may not be

13 considered by you. I'll instruct you at the end of these
14 charges about your ability to request to have testimony read
15 back and your access to other evidence admitted during the
16 trial.
17 Instruction No. 3. Contact with others, social media.
18 During your deliberations, you must not communicate
19 with or provide any information to anyone by any means about
20 this case. You may not use any electronic devices or media
21 such as a telephone, cell phone, smartphone, iPhone,
22 BlackBerry, or computer, the internet or any internet service
23 or any text or instant messaging service or any internet chat
24 room, blog, or website such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn,
25 YouTube, Twitter, or Snapchat to communicate to anyone any
