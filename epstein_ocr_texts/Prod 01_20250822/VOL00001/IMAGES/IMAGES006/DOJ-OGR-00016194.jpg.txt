1 plane between 1994 and 2004?
2 A. Mostly private -- the private jet. The only time that he
3 would take the airlines was when the Concorde was flying. And
4 typically, he would take a Concorde from New York to Paris, but
a otherwise anytime else, it was mostly private.
6 Q. How about Ms. Maxwell, during that same period, to your
7 knowledge, did she only fly on Mr. Epstein's private planes?

8 A. She flew on the private planes. And if memory serves, she
9 did ride the airlines, as well. And then, it was probably in
10 the late 1990s, she also had an option on a quarter share or a

11 private -- or a quarter ownership of a private jet, as well.
12 They call it a quarter share.
13 Q. What did Ms. Maxwell tell you about that?
14 A. That it was her jet, which, in fact, it was, because she
15 was partial owner of the jet and she had access to it with
16 notice.
17 Q. Could you explain the difference between flying on a
18 private plane and flying commercially.
19 A. Well, the best advantage is you leave when you want.
20 Otherwise, flying privately, security is much less. You don't
21 have TSA, you don't have x-rays, you come and go as you please,
22 pretty much. Some airports even let you drive your car
23 directly onto the ramp next to the aircraft and unload. So
24 it's a lot more freedom flying private.
25 Q. Typically, what, if any, interactions did you have with
