LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 specific memory of the first time with Ghislaine until she got
2 up on the stand and told you one.

3 So the government kept asking her, was Ghislaine ever
4 in the room when it happened. I asked her, how many times, and
5 she said I don't know -- I'm sorry. The government asked her

6 how many times, and she said I don't know. Was it once, no.

7 Was it twice, no. How many times, I don't know, but more than
8 twice. That's the evidence they want you to convict Ghislaine
9 Maxwell on? I don't know? I don't remember?

10 She also told you the thing that happened more

11 frequently was being in these group sexualized massages, and

12 because that involves other witnesses, you have a right to

13 evidence about this. She said that this group sex massages —
14 she called them orgies — happened frequently, and that Epstein
15 would just summon people up to a room and they would all follow
16 him up there. And she said she was a 14-year-old girl when

17 these orgies were going on in his house, and she wasn't sure

18 how often Ghislaine was ever present for these orgies, but she
19 gave other names.
20 Apparently none of these other women thought it was
21 unusual that a 14-year-old was in an orgy with them and they
22 didn't call the police or report it, but naturally, being the
23 FBI when they got names of these other women, they ran right
24 out to try to corroborate those stories and be like, hey,
25 sounds like maybe you were in a group orgy with a 14-year-old
