Re: United States v. Maxwell, Case No. 20-Cr-330
Dear Judge Engelmayer:

On behalf of MSW Media, Inc. (“MSW Media”), I respectfully submit this letter motion
to intervene in the above-captioned case for the purposes of partially supporting and partially
opposing the Government’s motion to unseal the transcripts of grand jury testimony in this case,
filed as Docket No. 785.

MSW Media (https://mswmedia.com/) operates numerous podcasts and blogs about
federal government operations, including Mueller She Wrote, SpyTalk, Daily Beans, and Jack. It
clearly qualifies as a representative of the news media.

MSW Media has standing to intervene in this case for the following reason. On 17 July
2025, after President Donald Trump publicly instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the
Court’s permission to release “any and all pertinent Grand Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom of
Information Act (“FOIA”) request with the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of all/
grand jury testimony from this case and United States v. Epstein, No. 19-490 (S.D.N.Y.). We are
concerned with the modifier “pertinent” in President Trump’s instruction, and that concern
seemed vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to “make
appropriate redactions of victim-related information and other personal identifying information
prior to releasing the transcripts.” (Dkt. #785 at 2 (emphasis added).)

To be clear, we have no interest in victim-related information, and this Motion does not
pertain to that information. However, we do have concerns that the Government seems to be
implicitly seeking this Court’s permission to withhold other personally identifiable information,
such as information about Defendant’s partners in crime or clients. Accordingly, while we join
the Government in requesting that these transcripts be released, we accordingly make this narrow
independent request to the Court: Please do not weigh in on the appropriateness of withholding
personally identifiable information unrelated to victims. We intend to litigate this FOTA request
if necessary, and the question of whether such information may be properly withheld is a
