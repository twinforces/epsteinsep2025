Re: Wnited States '¥. Maxwell, Case No. 20-Cr-330
Dear Judge Engelmayer:

On behalf'of MSW Media, Inc: (“MSW Media”), I respectfully submit-this letter:motion.
‘to intervene in the above-captioned case for the purposes of partially. supporting’ and partially’
opposing the. Government’s motion ‘to unscal the-transeripts of grand jury testimony in this, case,
filed as Docket No.'785..

MSW: Media (https://mswmedia.com/) operates numerous podcasts and. blogs about
federal government. operations, including Mueller She Wrote, Spy-Talk, Daily Beans, and Jack. It
clearly qualifies as a representative of the news media.

MSW.Mcedia has standing ‘to intervene in this case for. the following reason. On. 1.7 July
2025, after President, Donald Trump publicly instructed. Attorney..Gencral, Pam Bondi to seck the
Court’s permission,to release “any and all’pertinent’Grand.Jury testimony, we filed a Freedom, of
Information. Act (“FOIA”) request, with the: Department: of Justice (“DOJ”) for transcripts of a//
grand jury*testimony from. this cas¢ and United States.v. Epstein, No. 19-490. (S.D.N.Y.). We are
concerned; with the modifier‘ “pertinent” in President Trump’s instruction, and, that.concern
scemed:vindicated when the Government advised this Court that it intended to.“make:
‘appropriate redactions of victim-related information and. other personal identifving information
prior to releasing the transcripts.” (Dkt. #785 :at '2 (emphasis added).)

To be clear, we have ‘no interest ‘in:victim-related information, and:this Motion docs not:
pertain to that information. However, we do have concerns that the Government scems.to be:
implicitly seeking this Court’s permission to withhold, other personally identifiable information,
‘suchas information about;Defendant’s'partners:in crime or:clicnts. Accordingly. while: we join.
the Government in réquésting that these transcripts be réleased, we accordingly make this narrow
independent request to the Court? Please do ‘not Weigh ini.on the appropriatencss of withholding,
personally identifiable information unrelated to victims. We intend to litigate this FOIA request
if necessary; and.the question, of whether such information may‘be properly’ withheld isa
