1 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

2 Members of the jury, that closes the evidence portion
3 of the trial.

4 Let me tell you what comes next.

a Closing arguments are summation by the parties. Both
6 sides will have an opportunity to summarize for you their view
7 of the evidence in the case and the arguments they wish you to
8 consider. Following that, I'll instruct you as to the law that
9 you'll follow during your deliberations and then you'll begin
10 your deliberations.

11 Monday, I'm going to ask that we start at 9:00 a.m.

12 instead of 9:30. And I want you -- I believe we'll finish at
13 our normal time, but there is a possibility that, just to get
14 through what we need to do on Monday, we may go a little bit

15 later. So I'm going to ask you to arrange to be here as late
16 as 6:00 p.m. If that is a problem, on your way out tonight,

17 let Ms. Williams know, and we won't do that. I want to stick
18 to my promise to the schedule, but if everybody is able to stay
19 as late as 6:00 on Monday, that might help us ensure that we
20 can get done what we want to do in one day.
21 So again, Monday, 9:00 a.m., the parties will do their
22 closing arguments, their summations, then I'll instruct you as
23 to the law, and then the deliberations will begin.
24 So 9:00 a.m. on Monday. If staying until 6:00 on
25 Monday is a hardship, please let Ms. Williams know on your way
