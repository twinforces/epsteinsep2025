LCGVMAX7 Aznaran â€” cross

1 Q. I want to talk about people traveling into the United

2 States. In your work you refer to that as inbound travel,

3 right?

4 A. Yes.

5 Q. Based on your review of CBP records and your experience as
6 a CBP officer, if someone was traveling into the United States
7 before September 11th, 2001, would CBP records necessarily

8 reflect that person's travel into the United States?

9 A. Not necessarily.

10 Q. Can you explain why?

11 A. Once again, the recordkeeping and the way that the airlines
12 used to basically operate, I'll go back to APIS, Advance

13 Passenger Information System. Prior to 9/11, it was voluntary
14 for airlines to submit their manifests to APIS. After 9/11

15 and, more specifically, the most recent update that I'm aware
16 of in, I believe it's 2005, mandated airlines to submit full

17 and complete manifests to CBP using the APIS system.

18 Q. I want to talk about when someone leaves the United States
19 and travels internationally. In your work, you refer to that
20 as outbound travel, right?
al A. Yes.
22 Q. Based on your review of CBP records and your experience as
23 a CBP officer, if someone was traveling out of the United
24 States before September 11th, would CBP records necessarily
25 reflect that person's travel out of the United States?
