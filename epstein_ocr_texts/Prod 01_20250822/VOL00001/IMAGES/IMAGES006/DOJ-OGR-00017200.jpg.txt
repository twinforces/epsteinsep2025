LCKVMAX8 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey

1 Maxwell was exactly who Alessi said she was. And just like the
2 ex-boyfriends, Alessi has no reason to lie to you.

3 Second. Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie have no motive
4 to lie at this trial. The defense's only explanation for why

5 they would perjure themselves on that stand is money. But the
6 facts just do not support that. Remember, the victim

7 compensation fund is finished; the civil cases are done.

8 There's nothing pending. These women have already received

9 millions of dollars. They are not getting a penny more.
10 Now, the defense tried to point you to this
11 stipulation about Jane's lawyer. I'd encourage you to take a
12 look at it. Look at the whole stipulation. You'll see it
13 doesn't change anything I've said. Jane's lawyer told the
14 prosecutor that he remembered telling Jane that testifying
15 would be the morally right thing to do and that it could help
16 her case. But to be clear, that conversation with that
17 prosecutor occurred in 2021, long after Jane's civil case was
18 settled, long after she already received her award from the
19 fund. So there was no case to help. Whatever the Lawyer meant
20 by that, there is absolutely no evidence that Jane had any
21 financial incentive to testify at this trial. There's no money
22 to be had. You heard Jane, Kate, Carolyn, and Annie each tell
23 you unequivocally they have no financial stake in the outcome
24 of this trial. This verdict will have zero impact on the money
25 they received.
