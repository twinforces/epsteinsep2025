1 believes to be an example of suggestion. This testimony

2 provides a sufficient basis for the jury to consider the

3 relevance of Dr. Loftus's opinions on suggestive questioning

4 techniques. So that's my basis for that ruling.

S There was argument regarding Agent Young testimony

6 that -- I don't know the government's general views on Agent

7 Young's testimony and I don't need to reach a conclusion on

8 that for purposes of this ruling. So I don't have further

9 guidance on that now.

10 All right. Questions on that?

11 MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing from the government, your

12 Honor.

13 MS. STERNHEIM: Nothing at this time.

14 THE COURT: Okay. Thank you.

15 All right. Motion to preclude Alexander Hamilton

16 testimony.

17 MS. STERNHEIM: We'd like to get Broadway tickets for
18 everyone. That's the best we can do.

19 THE COURT: It really is -- yes. It was Hamilton in
20 Federal '78 that said, We just have judgment, not will nor
21 force, just judgment. So I guess this calls for judgment.
22 So I have the defense response with respect to this
23 witness that came in at 12:31 a.m. this morning. I haven't had
24 a chance to work through the issue yet.
25 What's the timing on this witness?
