believes to be an example of Suggésttion. This testimony
provides a sufficient hasis for the jury to consider the
relevance of Dr. LOfttis's, Opinions on suggestive questioning

Theré was argument regarding Agent Young ‘testimony
that -- IL don't know the government"'s general views on Agent
Young's testimony dnd I don't need to reach a conclifsion on

guidance on that now:

All right. Questions ‘on that?

MR. ROHRBACH: Nothing from the govérnnient, your
Honor.

MS. STERNHEIM: Nothing at this time.

THE COURT: Okay. Thank. ‘you.

All right. Motidn to6 preclude Alexander Hamilton

test:iumony:.

MS. STERNHEIM: We'd liké to get Broadway tickets for
everyone. That's the best we can do.

THE GOURT: It really is == yes. It was Hamilton in

a chance to work through the issue ‘yet.
What's the timing on this witness?
