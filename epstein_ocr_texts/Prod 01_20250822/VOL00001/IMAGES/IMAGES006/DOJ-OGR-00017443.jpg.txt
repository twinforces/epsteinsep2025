LBUCmax3 Visoski - cross
1 female if we didn't catch a name.
2 Q. Obviously, if you did know the name or it was a person you
3 recognized from before, you would put their name on the
4 manifest?
5 A. Absolutely.
6 Q. And you said that it was important to keep track of the
7 head count, which is why you wanted to know how many people
8 were on the plane; right?
9 A. That is correct.
10 Q. Now, you said weight was also a consideration; is that
11 right?
12 A. It's a consideration on some aircraft, not the kind that
13 we're flying, but it's something that should take into account
14 or as far as how heavy luggage is. But it is a consideration
15 as a pilot to know how much something weighs as far as luggage
16 and/or passenger.
17 Q. And that's if you're flying a small plane, for example, you
18 need to know the weight of the passengers?
19 A. Exactly, yes.
20 Q. But for the planes you were flying for Epstein,
21 particularly the Gulf Stream and the Boeing, you didn't need to
22 know the weight for those planes; right?
23 A. It was not necessary, no. It's, like I said, more of a
24 head count, but yeah, it's not a factor in these type of
25 aircraft.
