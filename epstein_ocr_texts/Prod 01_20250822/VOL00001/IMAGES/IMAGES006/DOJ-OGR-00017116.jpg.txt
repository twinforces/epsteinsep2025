LCKCmax5 Summation - Ms. Menninger

1 But in terms of Ghislaine Maxwell's lifestyle, do you
2 know what it was before she met Jeffrey Epstein? No, because

3 the government didn't tell you about that. Do you know what it

11 And does that motive even make sense for a woman in

12 her 30s, that she needs this lifestyle, so she's just willing
13 to drag 14-year-olds in for sexual abuse? Use your common

14 sense.

16 gentlemen of the jury, then why wouldn't Eva Dubin be telling
17 you the same thing? She dated Jeffrey Epstein for a decade.

18 She saw nothing abnormal. She let her kids hang around with

19 Jeffrey Epstein. She went on to marry a billionaire.

21 Maxwell needed Jeffrey Epstein's lifestyle so bad she was
22 willing to perpetrate on young females.
23 I'm going to take some time now, after talking about
24 the promises the government did not keep to you in their
25 opening, and go through each one of these women's stories and
