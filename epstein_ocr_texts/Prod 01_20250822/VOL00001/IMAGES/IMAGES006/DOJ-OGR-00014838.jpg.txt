1 provides another example. She testified that she confided in

2 the defendant that her mother was an alcohol and that she had

3 been raped and molested by her grandfather starting at a very

4 young age. The defendant, aware of this knowledge, used it to
a subject Carolyn to a continuing cycle of sexual abuse. The

6 defendant wasn't an impassive observer, but herself touched

7 Carolyn's breasts, again, at the time Carolyn was 14. For

8 years, Carolyn was paid for the sexualized massages, including
9 personally paid by the defendant.

10 Similar patterns of conduct were described by other

11 witnesses. Indeed, the criminal conduct established at trial
12 was extensive and it was far-reaching. Ms. Maxwell and Epstein
13 victimized multiple underaged girls using this pattern, this

14 playbook, over the span of many years and in a variety of

15 locations. And the damage done to these young girls was

16 incalculable. They did bravely testify at trial about what

17 happened to them despite the extraordinary difficulty that

18 entailed. They withstood cross-examination from zealous

19 defense counsel and testified credibly at trial about the
20 trauma that they had endured and the painful, horrific, and
al lasting impact of that trauma. They did so, they told me in
22 their statements, in order to help ensure justice for
23 themselves and others and to do what they could to try to
24 prevent other girls from suffering in the future as they had
25 suffered.
