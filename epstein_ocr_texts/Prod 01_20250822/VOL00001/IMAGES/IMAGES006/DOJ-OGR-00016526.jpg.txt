1 A. Hard to say, but I don't think so.

2 Q. Wetll talk about those folks in a minute.

3 Can you describe the layout of the office space at

4 Madison Avenue from when you get off the elevator.

5 A. Sure. So you get off the elevator and immediately to your
6 left were the restrooms. Immediately in front of you was the

7 accounting team office, then the reception desk would just be

8 kind of pitched to the right. Behind the reception desk was a
9 hallway where the offices were. The legal team sat on the

10 left-side office, and that was followed by Jeffrey's office,

11 which was a corner. Directly next to Jeffrey's office and

12 directly behind the receptionist at the end of the hall would
13 have been Jeffrey Epstein's assistant, and then I sat to the

14 left of Jeffrey Epstein's assistant. So we were, like, ina

15 row. If all doors were open, I could see Jeffrey in the

16 corner, his assistant, myself. And then in my office, which

17 was Ghislaine's office, there were three desks — one was

18 Ghislaine's, one was mine, and one was the legal assistant's.
19 Q. Do you remember the legal assistant's name when you were
20 there?
21 A. Lauren Quitner (ph.).
22 Q. Lauren Quitner?
23 A. Yes.
24 Q. So in the office where you sat and where Ghislaine sat, how
25 many people actually sat in that office?
