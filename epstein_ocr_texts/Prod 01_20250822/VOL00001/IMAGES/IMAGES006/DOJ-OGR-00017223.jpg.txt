The first element ‘of Count Four which the government.

necessary for Jane to travel as planned. Ms. Maxwell must have
knowingly ‘transported or caused, the transportation, of Jane in.
interstate commerce. That méans that. the Government. must. prove
that. Ms. Maxwell knew both that she was causing Jane to be
transported and that Jane was being transported in interstaté

it's done voluntarily and intentionally and. not because of
