LCKVMAX8 Charge

1 And third, that the defendant knew that the individual
2 was less than 17 years old at the time of the acts alleged in

3 Count Four of the indictment. Count Four also relates solely

6 individual under the age of 17 to engage in illegal sexual

7 activity. First element.

8 The first element of Count Four which the government

9 must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that Ms. Maxwell

10 knowingly transported Jane in interstate commerce as alleged in
11 the indictment. The phrase "to transport an individual in

12 interstate commerce" means to move or carry or cause someone to
13 be moved or carried from one state to another.

14 The government does not have to prove that Ms. Maxwell
15 personally transported Jane across a state line; it is

16 sufficient to satisfy the element that Ms. Maxwell was actively
17 engaged, either personally or through an agent, in the making
18 of the travel arrangements such as by purchasing tickets

19 necessary for Jane to travel as planned. Ms. Maxwell must have
20 knowingly transported or caused the transportation of Jane in
21 interstate commerce. That means that the government must prove
22 that Ms. Maxwell knew both that she was causing Jane to be
23 transported and that Jane was being transported in interstate
24 commerce. As I've explained, an act is done knowingly when
25 it's done voluntarily and intentionally and not because of
