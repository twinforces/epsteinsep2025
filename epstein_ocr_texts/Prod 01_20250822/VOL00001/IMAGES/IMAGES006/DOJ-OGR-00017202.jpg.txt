LCKVMAX8 Rebuttal - Ms. Comey

1 If these four witnesses wanted to dirty Maxwell up for
2 a huge payday, they would have told way better lies.

3 But, you know, let's just say the defense is right.

4 Let's say these women are lying. Given how consistent their

Â© accounts are with each other and with the other witnesses in

6 this case, that would mean that at least eight people -- Jane,
7 Kate, Carolyn, Annie, Dave, Shawn, Matt, and Juan Alessi -- all
8 are part of a massive conspiracy to frame the defendant. And

9 then they just happened to be lucky enough that the FBI had

10 documents to back up what they said: Flight records, FedEx

11 records, message pads, contact book, household manual to back
12 up their lies.

13 Beyond how implausible such a massive conspiracy of

14 eight people to lie in a federal court is, the timing here

15 makes it impossible. Remember, the defense's theory is that

16 the incentive to frame Maxwell arose after Epstein died in

17 2019. So this supposed frame job was hatched in 2019, meaning
18 Carolyn had to get in a time machine, go back to 2009 and

19 sprinkle in a couple references to Maxwell in her deposition.
20 And then Annie had to borrow that time machine, go back to
21 2006, and tell the FBI about how Maxwell touched her breast
22 during a massage.
23 Ladies and gentlemen, that's fiction. You know that
24 did not happen. Annie told the FBI about Maxwell because it
25 was the truth. Carolyn described Maxwell in her deposition
