something that could vaguely look like it might be eyéglasses

or whatever, very ambiguous. If it get labeled as eyeglasses,

people remembered it as more like eyeglasses. If it got

labeled. as dumbbells, people later remembered it as looking

more liké dumbbells. That's Just an example of how you car

label something ambiguous. and it will affect people's memory
for what they saw.

on Sq if two people,. let's say, are having a conversation
concerning an event, and oné of the individuals characterizés,

it in. some colorful fashion that the other ‘one may not have

considered, would that be a Situation where the memory might

become labeled?

A; Yes, absolutely. Ih one 6f our older studies, we found
that, Labeling something as an incident, which is really fairly
neutral, Has a different affect than when you label the thing

that, happened as a fight. People are more likely ‘to construct

an image 6f a fight, probably because of that label.

Q. Are you familiar with the term memory ‘traces?

A. Memory traces?

Q. Yes. Or memory fragments?

A; Well, I suppose that every now and then sémebddy might talk

about. memony fragments. Just, you, would have a bit or a ‘piece

of information in your fiemory.

®. And are you familiar with situations where someone might

take that bit of a memory and enhance it in some way?
