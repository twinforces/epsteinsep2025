LCGVMAX7 Hyppolite - direct

1 MS. STERNHEIM: It will not interfere, Judge.

2 THE COURT: Okay.

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, just --

4 THE COURT: It's like I'm getting triple-teamed here.
S I can barely keep up.

6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Sometimes five heads, six heads may be
7 better than one, sometimes maybe not.

8 But there is an issue about a government rebuttal

9 witness that I don't know if that's been resolved yet. And I
10 just wanted to lay that out there for the Court.

11 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. We are leaning against
12 calling that witness. We need to circle up as a team and we'll
13 have a final decision tomorrow morning for your Honor. I doubt
14 we will be calling any rebuttal witnesses.

15 THE COURT: Okay. I guess the only thing I would ask
16 you to consider is if we have time left over tomorrow, if there
17 is a very short witness on Monday, if perhaps the government

18 does intend to call a rebuttal, if you would consider using the
19 time tomorrow for the rebuttal, if that's acceptable to the
20 defense.
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: If there is going to be a rebuttal
22 witness, your Honor, there's going to be briefing on it
23 tonight.
24 THE COURT: I'm here all day.
25 When will you come to a decision?
