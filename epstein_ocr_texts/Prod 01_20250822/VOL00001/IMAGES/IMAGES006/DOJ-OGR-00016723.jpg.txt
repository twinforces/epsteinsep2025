MS. STERNHEIM: Tt will not tanterfere, Judge.

THE COURT: Okay.

MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, just --

THE COURT: It's like I'm getting triple-teamed here.

I can, barely keep up.

MR, PAGLIUCA: Sometimes. five heads, six heads may be
better than oné, Sometimes maybe not.

But there is an issue about a government rebuttal

witness that I don't know fF that's been résolved ‘yet. And I

just wanted to lay that out there for the Court.

MS. GCOMEY: Yes, your Honor. We are leaning against.
calling that witness. We meed to circle up as a team and we'll
have a finial decision tomérrow morning for your Hénor. I doubt
we will be calling any rebuttal witnesses.

THE GOURT: Okay: I guess the only thing I would ask

you to consider is if we have time left over tomorrow, if there

1S a very short witheéss on Monday, if perhaps the government.
dees intend, to call a mebuttal, if you, would consider using the
time tomorrow for the rebuttal, if that's acceptable to the
defense.

MR. PAGLIUCA: If there is gé6ing to be a rebuttal
witness, your Honor, there's going to be briefing on it
tonight.

THE COURT: I'm here all day.

When will you ‘come to a decision?
