Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 Filed 08/10/22 Page 46 of 257 2879
LCKCmax3 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 Exhibit 802. Again, Carolyn was 15. Carolyn told you that she
2 got packages from Epstein from New York, and she did. You can
3 see that here in black and white. That's Government Exhibits

4 801, 802, and 803.

5 Who else was sending packages from Epstein's office

6 from this very same time period? Maxwell. She used the same

7 account to send packages. You see Maxwell's name on each of

8 these FedEx account invoices. Maxwell was a part of the

9 operation just like Carolyn told you.

10 You also learned about phone messages that Carolyn

11 left in the Palm Beach house on those message pads. Those

12 phone messages corroborate Carolyn's testimony. They prove to
13 you that she was there.

14 So let's talk about two of them.

15 First, this is Government Exhibit 608. Carolyn

16 testified that this was her mother's phone number. She wrote
17 it down so she wouldn't have to say it out loud at trial, and
18 we marked it as an exhibit. That same phone number is all over
19 the message pads from the Palm Beach house, phone message after
20 message.
21 This is Government Exhibit 1-B. It's the same phone
22 number, and that's Carolyn's full name, first and last. It's
23 from 2004. And remember, we were just looking at FedEx records
24 from 2002. What's the message here? That she wants to work
25 for Epstein today. What you were looking at is a phone message
