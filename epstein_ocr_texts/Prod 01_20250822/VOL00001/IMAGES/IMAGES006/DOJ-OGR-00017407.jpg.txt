1 passenger name, I wanted to put whether they were male or

2 female, the passenger -- as a pilot's standpoint, it's more

6 Q. And remind us why you wouldn't necessarily know the name of

24 A. I don't remember it being cold, because I know it gets
25 pretty cold up there. It had to have been summer or, you know,
