MS. STERNHEIM: Thank, ‘you..
THE COURT: Okay. What other ‘open issues do we have

MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think there are some

issues with this first witness that I just want to raise 'with
the Court first.
THE COURT: That I have briefing on?

MR, EVERDELL: These’ are things that we've tried to
talk With ‘the government about. I don't think, it's going t6 be
a major dispute.

THE GOURT: Okay: JI just wanted to make sure I hadn't
missed it.

MR. EVERDELL: You did nét miss anything:

THE COURT: Okay. Go. ahead.

MR. EVERDELL: The first. witness is Ms. Espinosa.

THE COURT: Right.

MR. EVERDELL: S6 the first issue, which I think thé

government and the defense agree on, is that, there's a line of
cross that we ask the government if they plan to gét. into, and
they have agreed that they won't. And that's melated to the

following, which is that Ms. Galindo was a defendant in a civil

Lawsuit by one of the Epstein -- not one of the accusers in

this Gasé, but a different person. And s6 I've asked thé

government that they not get into that; they've agreed that

they won't cross Ms. Espinosa about that.
