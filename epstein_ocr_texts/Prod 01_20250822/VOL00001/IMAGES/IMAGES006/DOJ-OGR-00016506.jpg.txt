1 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.

2 THE COURT: Okay. What other open issues do we have

3 that we can deal with now, counsel?

4 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I think there are some

a issues with this first witness that I just want to raise with

6 the Court first.

7 THE COURT: That I have briefing on?

8 MR. EVERDELL: These are things that we've tried to

9 talk with the government about. I don't think it's going to be
10 a major dispute.

11 THE COURT: Okay. I just wanted to make sure I hadn't
12 missed it.

13 MR. EVERDELL: You did not miss anything.

14 THE COURT: Okay. Go ahead.

15 MR. EVERDELL: The first witness is Ms. Espinosa.

16 THE COURT: Right.

17 MR. EVERDELL: So the first issue, which I think the
18 government and the defense agree on, is that there's a line of
19 cross that we ask the government if they plan to get into, and
20 they have agreed that they won't. And that's related to the
al following, which is that Ms. Galindo was a defendant in a civil
22 lawsuit by one of the Epstein -- not one of the accusers in
23 this case, but a different person. And so I've asked the
24 government that they not get into that; they've agreed that
25 they won't cross Ms. Espinosa about that.
