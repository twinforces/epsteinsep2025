LCACmax5 A. Farmer â€” cross

1 Q. So you don't know whether there is a flight log entry

2 showing either Ghislaine Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein traveling

3 to New Mexico over a weekend in April of 1996; right?

4 A. Ido not.

5 Q. While you were at the ranch, there were other people there,
6 I believe you testified?

7 A. Yes.

8 Q. There was a driver that took you to and from the airport?

9 A. Yes.
10 Q. There were other ranch hands working there?
11 A. There were.
12 Q. There was actually, I think you did not mention on direct a
13 chef who was present; correct?
14 A. I -- I don't have a lot of memories of that.
15 Q. You don't recall a chef who made meals for you while you
16 were at the ranch?
17 A. I don't recall a person doing that, but that makes sense to
18 me, that there was a chef there.
19 Q. If I could refresh your memory by having you look at
20 3514-001, and this is the same 2006 document we looked at
21 earlier, page 3.
22 A. Is this in the binder?
23 Q. We're going to show it to you on the screen because it will
24 be easier than you flipping to it. But if you want to see the
25 whole document, let us know.
