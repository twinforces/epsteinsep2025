1 THE COURT: All right. So why don't we schedule the

2 charging conference for Saturday the 18th. I will confirm with
3 the relevant court administrative staff and the marshal that we
4 can do that and ensure public access and the like, of course,

a Ms. Maxwell's presence. But, as I said, my assumption is we

6 can do that. So I will get you the charge sometime in advance
7 of the 18th.

8 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, one other matter to take

9 up.

10 Looking ahead to the defense case -- and we have been
11 in contact with a number of our potential witnesses, and we are
12 already getting requests, and I think these are valid

13 requests -- that at least some of them testify anonymously --
14 THE COURT: I think your mic went out.

15 MR. EVERDELL: Maybe it's my mic that's the problem,
16 your Honor. It's making noise.

17 MS. STERNHEIM: Try this one.

18 MR. EVERDELL: Is that better?

19 THE COURT: It is.
20 MR. EVERDELL: Okay. So, your Honor, as I was saying,
21 we've been in contact with some of our witnesses, and we are
22 already getting what I think are valid requests that these
23 witnesses testify anonymously or under some sort of protection,
24 name protection, whether that's a pseudonym or a first name, we
25 have to work that out.
