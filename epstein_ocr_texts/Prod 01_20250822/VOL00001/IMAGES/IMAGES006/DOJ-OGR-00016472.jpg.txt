Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 759 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 256 of 267 2284
LCAVMAX8

1 number of exhibits, both defense exhibits and government

2 exhibits, that need additional redactions. And we agreed over
3 the break we would work diligently to resolve the full slate of
4 pending redactions issues. We don't understand the particular
5 urgency with respect to these exhibits.

6 Ms. Menninger is right, that she did email the

7 government last night in the evening while, as the Court is

8 aware, we were tending to other matters. I don't understand

9 the particular urgency with respect to these exhibits. And

10 again, we conferred with the defense this morning to confirm

11 they would resolve all the pending redaction issues over the

12 weekend. That seems entirely reasonable, given how many

13 redaction issues we'll be resolving.

14 We're still waiting to hear from the defense ona

15 number of redactions and we'll work together on that issue. I
16 don't see the need for a fire drill redaction resolution this
17 evening; and so I think the proposal we discussed this morning
18 is reasonable. We're going to get those issued resolved in

19 full.

21 Thank you.
22 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: The attorney-client privilege issue.
24 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I think we very well may
25 be able to reach some type of stipulation, as your Honor
