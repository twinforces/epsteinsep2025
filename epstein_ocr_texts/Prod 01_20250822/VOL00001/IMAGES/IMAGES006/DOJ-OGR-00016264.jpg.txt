LCAVMAX2 A. Farmer â€” direct

1 the jury.

2 A. Yeah. It was a large -- a large piece of property in New
3 Mexico, so kind of a desert landscape. And there were

4 different sections. And there was one that had like an old

iy movie set, like a western movie set on it. And then there was
6 a portion where we were staying where there's a small

7 residence.

8 THE COURT: I'd ask you again, Ms. Farmer, if you can
9 maybe shift it a little bit closer to you.

10 Thank you. Perfect. Thank you.

11 Q. Who, if anyone, did you meet at the ranch?

12 A. When I arrived, I had met -- I mean, I saw Epstein, and

13 then I met Ghislaine Maxwell.

14 Q. What did Maxwell look like?

15 A. She was trim, attractive woman, well-dressed, dark hair.
16 Q. About how old did Maxwell seem?

17 A. I believe she was in her thirties, so at the time she was
18 an adult.

19 MS. POMERANTZ: Ms. Drescher, can we please pull up
20 what's in evidence as Government Exhibit 115.
