Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 809 _ Filed 08/11/25 Page8of31

One of our highest priorities is combatting child exploitation and bringing justice

to victims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those

ends.

information regarding Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the

government’s possession, it is the determination of the Department of Justice and

the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no further disclosure would be appropriate

or warranted.

Ensuing news accounts reported public and congressional dissatisfaction with the July 6,

investigation into Epstein.°
