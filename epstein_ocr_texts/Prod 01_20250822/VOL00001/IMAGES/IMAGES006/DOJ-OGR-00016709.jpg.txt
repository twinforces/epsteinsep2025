LCGVMAX7 Aznaran â€” cross

1 A. Not necessarily, no.

2 Q. And can you briefly explain why?

3 A. Once again, the airlines, it was a little bit of a

4 different -- different world before 9/11 happened.

5) Q. I want to turn to the records that defense counsel asked

6 you about during direct examination.

7 Can you be certain that all outbound travel before

8 9/11 for the listed individuals is reflected in those records?
9 A. No.

10 Q. And again, briefly, why not?

11 A. I can't really say whether these records truly reflect

12 exactly any passenger's complete travel history.

13 Q. Can you be certain that all inbound travel before 9/11 for
14 those individuals is reflected in these records?

15 A. No.

16 Q. So it is possible that the people named in these records,
17 in fact, took international trips in the 1990s that are not

18 reflected in these records, right?

19 A. Possible.
20 Q. I think defense counsel had pointed you to -- if we could
2l turn to page 9. We're in Defendant's Exhibit MA-1.
22 THE COURT: I can't quite hear you, Ms. Pomerantz.
23 MS. POMERANTZ: I'm sorry. Defense Exhibit MA-1.
24 Q. We'tre on page 9. And on the last line there is a flight on
25 July 20th, 1997. Do you see that?
