Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 767 _ Filed 08/10/22 Page 235 of 257 3069
LCKCmax9 Charge

1 recounted what was heard or observed as the witness may be

2 honest but mistaken.

3 If you find that a witness is intentionally telling a
4 falsehood, that is always a matter of importance that you

5 should weigh carefully. If you find that any witness has lied
6 under oath at this trial, you should view the testimony of such
7 a witness cautiously and weigh it with great care. You may

8 reject the entirety of the witness's testimony, part of it, or
9 none of it. It's for you to decide how much of any witness's
10 testimony, if any, you wish to credit. A witness may be

11 inaccurate, contradictory, or even untruthful in some respects,
12 and yet entirely believable and truthful in other respects.

13 It's for you to determine whether such untruths or

14 inconsistencies are significant or inconsequential and whether
15 to accept or reject all or to accept some and reject the

16 balance of the testimony of any witness.

17 In evaluating the credibility of the witnesses, you

18 should take into account any evidence that the witness who

19 testified may benefit in some way from the outcome of this
20 case. If you find that any witness whose testimony you're
21 considering may have an interest in the outcome of the trial,
22 then you should bear that factor in mind when evaluating the
23 credibility of his or her testimony and accept it with great
24 care. This is not to suggest that any witness who has an
25 interest in the outcome of the case would testify falsely. It
