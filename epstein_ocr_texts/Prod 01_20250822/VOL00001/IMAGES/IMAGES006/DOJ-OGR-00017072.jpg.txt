LCKCmax3 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 Melissa's birth certificate. Sean told you this is the girl.

2 And sure enough, there are two entries under massage for

3 Melissa, Carolyn's friend. Here they are.

4 Again, remember how you learned that, by this point,

5 things operated like a pyramid scheme. Virginia brought

6 Carolyn, Carolyn brought Melissa and other girls. One girl

7 would bring another, who would bring another.

8 Ladies and gentlemen, this book, Maxwell's book, it

9 proves to you that Maxwell is guilty. What you'll see in this
10 book corroborates the witnesses who testified at this trial.

11 She had victim names written in a little black book. This

12 document is powerful evidence of the defendant's knowledge and
13 intent. These were not real massages. What was happening was
14 sexual abuse with underage girls. Maxwell knew it, she was

15 part of it, she was responsible for it, and the fact that she
16 had a little black book with her victims' names in it proves to
17 you that she is guilty.

18 That brings us to the seventh reason that you know

19 Maxwell is guilty. It's the money. Now, we've already talked
20 about Epstein's luxurious lifestyle and all of the perks that
21 Maxwell got from being his partner in crime, but it wasn't just
22 getting to live in the mansions and flying on the private jets,
23 maxwell got millions of dollars from Epstein. You learned that
24 between 1999 and 2007, Jeffrey Epstein gave Maxwell about $30
25 million, and you know exactly what that money was for.
