2. Whether the ‘Defendant to the Grand.Jury Proceedings or the
Government. Opposes Disclosure

Maxwell. opposcs disclosure because, among, other reasons, her case remains:on direct
appeal. Dkt. 803 at,2 (“Because this is ongoing litigation in a criminal case involving a. living
deéfendant;with existing legal remedies, the government?s motion should. be denied”)

This factor thus-weighs against unsealing. The Court, however, assigns. limited weight'to
this factor because Maxwell, who does not:have a legal right to access the grand jury materials,
has not scen it. Heropposition is therefore fairly viewed as-precautionary. Had Maxwell/been
aware thatthe grand.jury materials are duplicative of information in,the:publie record, her
position might have been different.

3. Why Disclosure Is Being Sought in ‘the Particular Case

This. factor addresses the present-day ‘significance of the grand jury materials at issue and.
whether their disclosure. would advance the public interest. This factor so decisively weighs.
against-unsealing that it alone would require denying the Government’s motion.

Arguments to disclose grand jury: testimony on account of historical or public interest are
“totally appropriate” and sometimes may even be weighty. Ji re Craig, 131.F.3d at 106. But for
interest importance. This evidence was put before the grand. jurics in June 2020 and March
2021, in‘a.case that remains on direct appeal. Cf" In re National Security.Archive, 104 F. Supp.
3d at 628-29 (1950 grand jury testimony regarding Julius and.Ethel Rosenberg); /n,re AHA, 49
E. Supp. at 278, 297-98 (1947-1950 grand jury testimony regarding Alger Hiss). And.it.is not
‘of present-day public: importance: because it consists of summary testimony by law enforcement
agents recounting information that today is a:matter, of public record, on account of the month-

long trial,on the charges returned by the grand jury. Cf. /i re.Biaggi, 478 F.2d at 494 (grand jury
