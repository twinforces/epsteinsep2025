6 THE COURT: I want to know if the transcripts have

7 been reviewed for the government.

8 MS. COMEY: They have, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: So they are ready to go?

10 MS. COMEY: They are, your Honor.

11 THE COURT: It was frustrating to have to have the

12 jury wait for three hours to get what they requested.

13 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.

14 And we apologize for that.

15 THE COURT: Defense agrees that they are now ready to
16 go?

17 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor. We've conferred on
18 every witness at this point.

19 THE COURT: Okay.
20 Second thing. I'm inclined to have Ms. Williams just
21 call our alternates tonight to say deliberations are ongoing.
22 All the rules continue to apply. She'll communicate with any
23 further instructions.
24 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.
25 MS. STERNHEIM: No problem. Thank you.
