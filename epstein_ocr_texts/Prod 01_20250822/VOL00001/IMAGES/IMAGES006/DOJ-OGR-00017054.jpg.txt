LCKCmax3 Summation â€” Ms. Moe

1 MS. MOE: So in the defense case, they happened to

2 find two people with the first names, Michelle and Ava, and

3 they brought them down to court to try to discredit Jane. But
4 here's the thing, Jane never testified that Michelle Healey and
5 Eva Dubin were in the room when she was abused. She did not

6 say that.

7 Defense counsel asked her about a Michelle and an Eva.
8 They expressly did not ask Jane if she knew those people's last
9 names. They didn't show Jane pictures of Eva Dubin or Michelle
10 Healey to see if those were the people she was referencing.

11 They left it really vague on purpose. But trying to discredit
12 Jane this way makes no sense. Your common sense tells you that
13 those aren't the only Michelles and Evas in the whole wide

14 world.

15 And you can take a look at excerpts from Government

16 Exhibit 52. That's the black contact book. Remember, there

17 were pages from Epstein and Maxwell's contact book, and we're
18 going to talk more about this book later. But you're going to
19 see this book had another Eva in it and three Michelles. Of
20 course there were other Michelles and Evas out there and other
21 people with those names in Epstein's life. Calling these women
22 to testify was completely meaningless and it was a total
23 sideshow. Don't be distracted by that. It was meaningless.
24 Ladies and gentlemen, the evidence tells you that Jane
25 told you the truth at this trial because you could see and hear
