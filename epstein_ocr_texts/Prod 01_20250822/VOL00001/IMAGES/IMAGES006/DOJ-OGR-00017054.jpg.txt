L€KCmax3 Summation - Ms. Moe

MS. MOE: SO in the défense cdasé, they happened to
find two people with the first names, Michelle and Ava, and
they brotight' them down, to court to try to discredit Jane. But
here's the thing, Jane never testified that Michelle Healey and
Eva Dubin ‘were in ‘the room when shé was abuséd. She did not
say that.

Défense counsel asked her about a Michelle and, an, Eva.
They expressly did not ask. Jane if she knew those people's last
names. They didn't show Jané pictures of Eva Dubin or Michelle

Healey to see if those were the people she was referencing.

They left it really vague oh purpdése. But trying to discredit
Jane this way makes no sense. Your common, sense tells you, that
those, aren't the 6nly Michelles and Evas in the whole wide
world.

And you Gah take a 160k at excerpts from Government
Exhibit 92. @Phat's the black contact. book. Remember, there
were pages from Epstein and Maxwell's contact. book, and we're
going to talk more about, this book later. But you're going to.
see this book had ahother Eva ih it and three Michelleées. Of

course there were other Michelles and Evas out there and other

people with those namés in Epstein's life. Calling these women

sideshow. Don't be distracted by that. It was méaningless.

Ladies ‘and gentlemen, the evidence tells you that Jane

told you the truth at this trial because you could see and hear,
