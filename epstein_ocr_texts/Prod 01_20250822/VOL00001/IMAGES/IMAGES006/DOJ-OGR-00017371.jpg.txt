1 (In open court)

2 THE COURT: I had an additional conversation with the
3 juror. He was confident there was no way to move it. He said
4 he could cancel it, they would lose money, it was a burden, he
a was distracted by it, so I had to excuse juror number 58.

6 All our other jurors are here. They're just finishing
7 up settling in. So we can proceed as soon as Ms. Williams

8 brings them out.
