Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 804 _ Filed 08/06/25 Page 9 of 27

It is obviously impossible for two péople to conduct a decades-long’ sex-trafficking enterprise
involving ‘thousands of'victims, without other individtials who participated in aid facilitated these
unspeakable atrocities.

The récént controversy sirrounding the Gevernment’s decision to withhold :information
concerning Epstein’s, and, Maxwell’s crimes has, largely ignored ‘the victims’ perspective: Ms.
Farmer is thankful for the Court’s. invitations to state the victims’ positions, and, supports the
unsealing of ‘the grand jury ‘transcripts, as well as the accompanying grand jury exhibits, with
redactions only as necessary to protect victims’ names, likenessés, and ‘identifying information.
Transparency. is critical to-justice, and the public has:a. legitimate interest in understanding the full
scope of Epstein’s.and Maxwell’s crimes, particularly where those actions caused.Jasting harm to
others,, While it was not the victims’ :decision‘to seek disclosure of the grand jury transcripts. alone
(as opposed to the:much larger volume of information available in the “more than 300 gigabytes
of data and physical evidence” in, the Government’s possession ‘that should be disclosed as well),
the instant motion for unsealing will help expose the magnitude and. abhorrence of Epstein’s and
Maxwell’s crimes.

In this case. that involved a decades-long, systematic criminal scheme that shocked the
consciénce ofthe public, caused lasting harm to survivors, and raised:credible concerns about the
failures. of institutional, accountability, there is an especially compelling interest in transparency.
Unsealing the grand jury: transcripts will illuminate the scope of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s abuse,
provide additional. insight into those who eiabled ‘his abuse, and. brifg light to how these ctimes
were investigated and prosecuted. ‘While grand jury’ secrecy serves important purposes, it is riot
absolute and under these: circumstances the balarice'tilts in favor of disclosure.

1. Given: the Magnitude and Abhorrence of Epstein’s and Maxwell’s Crimes, ‘the
Unsealing of the Grand Jury Transcripts Is Appropriate.

The Second Circuit has recognized ‘that there are special circumstances when the. release
of grand jury. records is appropriate based.on the courts’ supervisory authority over the grand juries
they empanel. and that the trial court has “wide discretion ... in ‘evaluating whether disclosure is
appropriate.” Jn re Petition of Craig, 131 F.3d.99, 102, 104 (2d Cir. 1997). In Craig, the Second
Circuit outlined a non-exclusive list of factors that a trial court: may consider when. deciding
whether “special. circumstances warrant the:release of grand jury transcripts. Jd. at'106. We join
the Government’s arguments: for unsealing under the Craig factors, Epstein .Dkt No. 66, at 3-7.
Two factors warrant additional discussion in light of the victims’ position. in. favor of unsealing.

or:commutation of her'sentence. The victims of her'crimes unequivocally object'to. any: potential
leniency that the Government may be considering offering Maxwell, a,convicted sex trafficker.
