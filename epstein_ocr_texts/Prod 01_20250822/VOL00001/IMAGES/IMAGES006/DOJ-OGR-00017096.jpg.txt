1 with each other or anyone else about the case. Wait until you

8 THE COURT: Any matters to take up?

9 MS. COMEY: No, your Honor.

10 MS. STERNHEIM: One brief matter, Judge.

11 THE COURT: Okay.

12 MS. STERNHEIM: And I preface this by saying that I

13 haven't had an opportunity to research it, but during the

14 closing argument, Ms. Moe indicated that because a massage

15 table came from California, that affects interstate commerce.
16 It is not my understanding that that is accurate. If that were
17 the case, then any dwelling that contained any property that

18 had come out of state would have affected interstate commerce.
19 There is no evidence that the table was purchased, when it was
20 purchased, and whether it was purchased in connection with the
21 offenses charged. It is unlike the cases where property is
22 stolen, and that property is for resale and affects interstate
23 commerce. This is not that situation, and I think that the
24 statement is incorrect.
25 THE COURT: Application?
