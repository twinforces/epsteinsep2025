THE COURT: Any matters to take up?

MS. COMEY: 'No, your Honor.

MS. STERNHEIM: One brief matter, Judge.

THE COURT: Okay:

MS, STERNHEIM: And I preface this by saying that L
haven't hdd an Opportunity to research it, but during the
closing argument, Ms. Moe indicated, that because a massage
table canié from California, that affects interstate cdomnrierce.
Lt is not my understanding that that 1s accurate. If that were

the ease, then any dwelling that Gohtaihed any property that

had come out of state would, have affected interstate commence.
There i5 no evidence that. the table was purchased, when it was

purchased, and whether it was purchased, in, connection with the

offensés chargéd. It is unlike the cases where property is
stolen, and that property is for resale and, affects interstate
commerce. This i8 hot that situation, and I think that the
statement. is incorrect.

THE COURT: Application?
