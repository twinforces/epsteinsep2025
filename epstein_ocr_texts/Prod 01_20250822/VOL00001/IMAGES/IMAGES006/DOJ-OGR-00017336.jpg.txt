1 there can be no error in referring the jury to a correct legal
2 instruction. And so no relief is appropriate here.

3 At bottom, your Honor, the jury asked a question and

4 nothing more. There is no reason to speculate about what the

5 jury might be concluding. The jury has been accurately

6 instructed on the law and that's all that's required here.

7 Going beyond that to speculate about the jury's deliberations

8 and compound speculation upon speculation to send back

9 confusing legal instructions would compound the problem here.
10 The simple course is exactly the course the Court took

11 yesterday, which is to refer the jury to a thorough and

12 complete and accurate legal instruction. There can't be any

13 dispute that the instructions that the Court has given are

14 accurate, and that's all that's required here.

15 THE COURT: I suppose an additional point, just

16 looking at the -- I mean, the defense's new proposed

17 instruction talks about Count Two, which wasn't asked about.

18 Also, it has -- so it has three paragraphs. The first one is
19 about Count Two, which wasn't asked about. There is a second
20 paragraph. And then the third paragraph I think is just wrong,
21 an intent that Jane engaged in sexual activity in any state
22 other than New York cannot form the basis of these elements.
23 That would suggest it may have no relevance. This is the same
24 discussion we've had a couple of times, Mr. Everdell. Sexual
25 activity with respect to Jane in New Mexico under the age of 17
