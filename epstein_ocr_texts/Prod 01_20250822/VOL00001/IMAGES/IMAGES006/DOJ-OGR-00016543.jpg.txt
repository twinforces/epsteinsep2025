1 Q. And that included yourself?

2 A. Uh-huh.

3 Q. And about how soon after the show opened, in your

4 recollection, was he handing out these tickets?

S A. That I can't say. I'm not sure.

6 Q. But you recall it being a hot ticket?

7 A. Oh, yeah. It was new. It was a new show.

8 Q. Do you recall anybody else that he gave Lion King tickets

9 to?

10 A. I feel like he gave them to almost all of the employees if
11 they wanted. It was just something that he was giving out at
12 that time. I don't really recall who else.

13 Q. I'm going to ask you a little bit more about the office.

14 Did Epstein ever receive visitors in the office?

15 A. Yes.

16 Q. Were any of these visitors female?

17 A. Yes.

18 Q. I want to show you on the screen, this is an exhibit that's
19 already admitted, Government Exhibit 12, but I believe it's
20 admitted under seal. So if we can just display it --
21 MR. EVERDELL: May I confer, your Honor?
22 THE COURT: You may.
23 MR. EVERDELL: All right. So if we can just display
24 Government Exhibit 12 for the Court, the deputy, and the
25 witness only. This is already admitted under seal.
