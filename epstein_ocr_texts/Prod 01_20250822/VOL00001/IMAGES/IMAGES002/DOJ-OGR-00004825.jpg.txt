Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 310-1 Filed 07/02/21 Page 13 of 80
Canadian authorities, in turn, referred the complaint to Philadelphia Police.
Philadelphia forwarded the complaint to Cheltenham Police. The District
Attorney’s Office became involved at the request of the Cheltenham Chief
of Police John Norris.

Everyone involved in this matter cooperated with investigators including the
complainant and Mr. Cosby. The level of cooperation has helped the
investigation proceed smoothly and efficiently. The District Attorney
commends all parties for their assistance.
The District Attorney has reviewed the statements of the parties involved,
those of all witnesses who might have first hand knowledge of the alleged
incident including family, friends and co-workers of the complainant, and
professional acquaintances and employees of Mr. Cosby. Detectives
searched Mr. Cosby’s Cheltenham home for potential evidence.
Investigators further provided District Attorney Castor with phone records
and other items that might have evidentiary value. Lastly, the District
Attorney reviewed statements from other persons claiming that Mr. Cosby
behaved inappropriately with them on prior occasions. However, the
detectives could find no instance in Mr. Cosby’s past where anyone
complained to law enforcement of conduct, which would constitute a
criminal offense.
After reviewing the above and consulting with County and Cheltenham
detectives, the District Attorney finds insufficient, credible, and admissible
evidence exists upon which any charge against Mr. Cosby could be
sustained beyond a reasonable doubt. In making this finding, the District
Attorney has analyzed the facts in relation to the elements of any applicable
offenses, including whether Mr. Cosby possessed the requisite criminal
intent. In addition, District Attorney Castor applied the Rules of Evidence
governing whether or not evidence is admissible. Evidence may be
inadmissible if it is too remote in time to be considered legally relevant or if
it was illegally obtained pursuant to Pennsylvania law. After this analysis,
the District Attorney concludes that a conviction under the circumstances of
this case would be unattainable. As such, District Attorney Castor declines
to authorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this matter.
Because a civil action with a much lower standard for proof is possible, the
District Attorney renders no opinion concerning the credibility of any party
involved so as to not contribute to the publicity and taint prospective jurors.
The District Attorney does not intend to expound publicly on the details of
his decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue
weight by jurors in any contemplated civil action. District Attorney Castor
cautions all parties to this matter that he will reconsider this decision should
the need arise. Much exists in this investigation that could be used (by
others) to portray persons on both sides of the issue in a less than flattering
