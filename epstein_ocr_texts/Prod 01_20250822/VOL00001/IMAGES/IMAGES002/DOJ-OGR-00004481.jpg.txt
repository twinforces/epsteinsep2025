OPR. explored the subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests
for.in-person, meetings and, whether such. aecommodation;was unusual. OPR, questioned cach. of
the four supervisory subject :attorncys, about: his rationale for cngaging in, multiple meetings with.
the defense.

Lourie could not recall his reasoning for meeting. with Epstein’s defense counsel, but he
told OPR that his general, practice was:to' meet with, defense counsel. when, asked, to do so; ‘Lourie:
recognized that some prosecutors—like Villafatia—viecwed, meeting with the defense as a.sign, of
“weakness,” but.in. Lourie’s view, “information is power,” and as long as the USAO did not share
information with the defense. but rather. listened ‘to. their arguments, mectings ‘were “all power to

Lourie explained that by mecting with the defense, “[Y]ou’re getting the information that
they think is ‘important; that they’re going to focus on. The witnesses that they think are liars .
And ‘so you. can. form.all of that into ‘your’ strategy.” Lourie also told OPR that giving defense
counsel. the opportunity to argue the defense ‘position is an important “part of the proccss” that.
helped ensure procedural fairness, allowing them. to “belicve that they are: getting heard.” When.
asked whcther he:afforded the same access to all defendants, Louric responded, “I: don’t recall ever
getting . ... so many requests for:mectings ... .;and/so many appeals and. so ‘many audiences that.
[Epstein’s S ; attorneys] got. But this was | think the first'time that that’s really happened.”

Menchel, too, told OPR: ‘that-his g gencral vicw'was that ‘ ‘cthically: it’s appropriate” to give a
‘defense attorney “an. audience,” and there was no:real “downside” to doing so. Menchel added,
“[W]hat happens a. lot of times is the government will carve around. those points that are being
raised ‘by the defense, and it?s good to: know” what:the defense willbe:

During his‘OPR interview, Acosta rejected the:notion that his meeting’with defense counscl
was unusual or outside: the norm. He'told OPR that his initial mecting with. the defense: tcam,
before'the NPA was.signed, was “not the first-and only'time that,1 granted a:mecting ... . to defense
attorneys” who requested one. Acosta, did not belicve it;was “atypical” for a U.S: Attorney’ to mect;
‘with opposing counscl, particularly’ as a casc was coming to ‘resolution. Sloman corroborated.
Acosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta, typically meét with ‘defense attorneys, aiid that the
USAO handled-requests for mectings:from Epstcin’s:counsel “in thenormal course.” Furthermore,
Acosta said that notwithstanding that mecting and all the: other * ‘process’ ” granted to the: defense
bythe USAO and the Department, “we:suceessfully held firm in our positions” on the key clements
of the ‘resolution=that: is, the requirements that Epstein. be incarecrated, register as a. sexual
offender, and provide nionetary daniages to the. victiiis.

OPR, examined. the circumstances surrounding cach, subject's decisions to have the
individual ‘meetings with ‘defense counsel to determine if those mectings hada. neutral, strategic.
purpose. The first ‘meeting, on February. 1, 2007, followed. a phone call between Louric and one
of Epstein’ '§ attorneys, in which the attorney asked. for a chance 'to “make a pitch” about the
victims’ lack of:credibility and suggested that Epstcin-:might agree to an interview: following that
pitch. Villafafia objected to meeting with.the:defense, but she recalled.that L-ouric told-her she was
not being: a “strategic thinker,” and that, he believed the meeting could lead. to a debriefing of
Epstein. The mecting did not result in. a. debriefing of Epstein, but in, advance of the follow-up
meeting on Eebruary 20,2007, defense counsel gave ‘the USAO audio, recordings of the state’s
Withess Interviews. Contemporancous documents indicate that Louric was unpersuaded by’ the
‘defense arguments. After Villafafia. circulated the prosecution memorandum, -Louric: suggested,
