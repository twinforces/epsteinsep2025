Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document204 Filed 04/16/21 Page. 67 of 239

‘Involving’ .. . is equally consistent, with, applying a fact-based. approach.” 865.F.3d at 60 n.111
(citing Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29, 38 (2009) (applying'the circumstances-speécific approach
to a statute containing the: word. “involves”)). Moreover, as'the Weingarten courtobserved, the
Supreme ‘Court ‘has applied. the categorical approach to ‘statutes. containing’ the word “‘involving”
where the statutes, at issue, also referenced “elements” of offenses, or specific prior “convictions,”
ina manner that. referred to specific convictions, as opposed to particular offense conduct: 865
F.3d at,59.(citing Zaylor'v. United States, 495 U.S. 575 (1990): Leocal v: Ashcroft, 543 U.S. '1
(2004)). By contrast, the phrase“‘scxual.abuse” in Section.3283 refers to. specific conduct, and not
the statutory offenses charged. in the Indictment.

In. Weingarten, the Second. Circuit further noted that applying the categorical approach to
Section. 3283. would. run. contrary to Congress’s intention. to “cast.a. wide net to ensnare as. many:
offenses. against children.as possible.” 865 F.3d, at 60 (quoting Schneider, 801,/F.3d at 196). On,
this'point, it bears emphasizing that'the interpretation.the defendant.advances'would.lead t6-absurd.
‘outcomes, as' many federal, crimes involving the scxual,abuse of minors do not.contain, as an,
element, a ‘requirement that the defendant commit:a sex.act-with a minor. It would run contrary to
‘Congress’s intent.to interpret Section 3283 in a:manner that would exclude many—if not:most—.
‘sexual offenses against.children..

The lone Section 3283 case the defendant cites, United States v. Cotinténtos, 651 F.3d.809
(8th ‘Cir. 201.1), is casily distinguishable on jits facts. In that case, the Eighth Circuit considered,
‘among’ other issues, whether, the, crime of possessing’ child. pornography ‘involved sexual abuse
within'the:meaning of Scction 3283. /d..at.816-18. In-analyzing that question, thecourt:discussed,
among. a ‘varicty’ of factors, the clements ‘of the crime. But it did not consider the categorical

approach, or purport:to apply.an “essential ingredients” test, as the defendant:implics. Instead, the
