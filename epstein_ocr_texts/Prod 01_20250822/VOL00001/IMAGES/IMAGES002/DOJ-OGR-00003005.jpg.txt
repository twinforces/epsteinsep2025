2. Discussion

The defendant points to: at ‘least four ways in which she claims the passage of time
prejudiced her defense, but none of her hypothetical claims of prejudice ‘withstand, scrutiny. In
particular, she contends:that, as.a result of the passage of:time,, four:witnesses have died, unnamed
Epstein employees have been “lost,” unspecified witnesses now have “failed or corrupted”
memories, and records have been lost. or destroyed. She further contends that these collectively
demonstrate actual. prejudice. (Def. Mot. 7:at 8-14). None:has merit, individually or collectively.

With respect to the first three arguments, the: fact. that certain, witnesses cannot. testify.
because of theirdeaths or failed. memories docs not. compel a firdirig, of-actual prejudice. “Faded

a, defendant. must demonstrate a substantial, actual prejudice to his ability to defend himself.”
