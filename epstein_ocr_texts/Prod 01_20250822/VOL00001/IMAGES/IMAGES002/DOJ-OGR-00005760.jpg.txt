Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document394_ Filed 10/29/21 Page4of9

Ghislaine’ Maxwell moves to exclude any testimony: or reference to an. alleged-“rape” by
Jeffrey Epstein.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Accuser- ,’s allegations against: Mr. Epstein have been inconsistent. Sometimes: she: has
claimed that.Mr. Epstein, raped her. At other times, however, Accuser-1 has, not:made any
allegation.about being raped.

All the same, Accuser-] has never accused:Ms. Maxwell of knowing’that: Mr. Epstein.
allegedly raped her or-of facilitating or‘participating in an. alleged ‘rape. And the indictment in
this case docs not charge any:such:conduct by Mr. Epstcin or.Ms. Maxwell. Rather, the
‘indictment charges ‘enticement and transportation of minors across state lines to’provide
“sexualized massages” to Mr. Epstein and conspiracy to, do the samc.

Itis not.clear whether any other witness will.allege having been raped by Mr. Epstein.
But what;is clear is:that:the indictment does not: allege that any rape occurred. Nor does it ‘allege
that Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated :in an alleged rape.
