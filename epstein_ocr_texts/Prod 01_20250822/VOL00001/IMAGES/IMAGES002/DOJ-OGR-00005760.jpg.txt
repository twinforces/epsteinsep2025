Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 394 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page4of9

Ghislaine Maxwell moves to exclude any testimony or reference to an alleged “rape” by
Jeffrey Epstein.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Accuser-1’s allegations against Mr. Epstein have been inconsistent. Sometimes she has
claimed that Mr. Epstein raped her. At other times, however, Accuser-1 has not made any
allegation about being raped.

All the same, Accuser-1 has never accused Ms. Maxwell of knowing that Mr. Epstein
allegedly raped her or of facilitating or participating in an alleged rape. And the indictment in
this case does not charge any such conduct by Mr. Epstein or Ms. Maxwell. Rather, the
indictment charges enticement and transportation of minors across state lines to provide
“sexualized massages” to Mr. Epstein and conspiracy to do the same.

It is not clear whether any other witness will allege having been raped by Mr. Epstein.
But what is clear is that the indictment does not allege that any rape occurred. Nor does it allege
that Ms. Maxwell knew of, facilitated, or participated in an alleged rape.

ARGUMENT

The United States Constitution guarantees due process of law and fair trials by impartial
juries. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI. Essential to that guarantee is a promise that the jury will not
be misled by irrelevant and prejudicial evidence that will district jurors from their one and only
duty—to decide whether the government has proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt. See
United States v. Doyle, 130 F.3d 523, 538-39 (2d Cir. 1997). A jury that has been misled by
irrelevant and prejudicial evidence cannot be considered impartial. See Fed. R. Evid. 403,
Advisory Committee Notes, 1972 Proposed Rules (evidence must be excluded when it risks
inducing a decision based on a purely emotional basis).
