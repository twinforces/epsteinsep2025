In. his 2009 deposition, Reiter stated ‘that; Villafafia ‘sent him, a. letter “around, the ‘time of
sentencing,” listing the victims, in the federal, investigation, and that ‘she asked him to, destroy the
letter after he reviewed. it. Reiter recalled that he requested the list because he was. aware that the
state grand jury’s indictment of Epstein did not: include all of the victims that the PBPD. had
identified and he “wanted. to.make:sure that some: prosecution body had considered. all of our
victims.”3°9

In her 2017 declaration in the CVRA. litigation, Villafafia stated ‘that she and ‘the. PBPD
“attempted to notify the victims about [the June: 30] hearing in the short-time available to us.
In her 2008 declaration, ‘however, Villafafia, conecded that “all’known victims were not notified.”

Villafafia. told OPR that Edwards ‘was, the only: victim. attorney’ she ‘was: authorized to
contact—she thought probably by Sloman—about’ the.Junc 30, 2008-plca hearing because Edwards
“had expressed a specific:interest in the outcome.” Villafafia recalled, “Iwas told that I could
inform [Edwards] of [the plea date], but I still couldn’t inform, him of the’NPA. 355: In her 2008
declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia. stated that she called. Edwards and. informed him of
‘the plea. hearing scheduled for Monday; Villafafia stated that: Edwards told her that he could not:
attend the hearing but, “someone” would be present. In a later filing in the CVRA litigation,
however, Edwards. asserted that Villafafa told him. only that “Epstein was pleading: guilty: to state
solicitation. of prostitution charges involving other victims—not Mr. Edwards’ clients nor any of
the federally-identified victims.”*°* Edwards further claimed that because Villafafia failed to
inform him, that the; “guilty pleas in state:.court would, bring ‘an. end. to the: possibility of federal
prosecution pursuant to'the plea agréement,” his clients did ‘not attend the hearing. Villafana told,
OPR that her cxpectation was that‘the state plea proceeding would allow Edwards and-his clients
the ability to;comment on the resolution:

356 Villatafia stated:that she “never told, Attorney Edwards: that the state charges involved ‘other victims,” and,
neither the state court charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the. procurement. of prostitution charge tora
specific victim.” Although Edwards criticized Villafafia’s conduct: in. his CVRA. filingss:in ‘his’ recently’ published
book, Edwards described Villafafia as.a “kindhearted prosecutor w ho:tried to do:right,” noting that she “belicv [ed] 1 in,
the victims: and’ tr[icd] . ‘to bring:down Jeftrey‘Epstein.”” Bradley J. Edwards with Brittany’ Henderson, Relentless
