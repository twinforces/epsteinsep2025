in each indictment—to his personal profit); United States v. Brown, No. 07-0296, 2008 WL
161146, at *5 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 16, 2008) (severing an “isolated” firearms possession charge on a
certain day from other narcotics and firearms charges); United States v. Martinez, No. 92 Cr. 839
(SWK), 1993 WL 322768, at *8-9 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 19, 1993) (similar).

The defendant also contends that her false statements were not connected to the substantive
offenses because they were made in a civil deposition, rather than “to the grand jury or the FBI to
derail its investigation.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 8). As an initial matter, and as evidenced by the
defendant’s own motions to suppress the fruits of the grand jury subpoena issued to Boies Schiller,
the defendant herself professes to have been concerned about the prospect of a criminal
investigation at the time of her depositions, which strongly suggests that, on these facts, the
distinction is of little moment. (See, e.g., Def. Mot. 3 at 3-4 (explaining that the defendant “flatly
rejected” a law enforcement exception to the civil protective order); Def. Mot. 11 at 2 (arguing
that the defendant “declined to invoke” her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination
at the deposition after negotiating the protective order)). More important, and whatever moment
that distinction may have in other contexts, it has little bearing on the severance analysis which
turns instead on whether the substance of the false statement relates to the substantive offense, and
is thereby provable through overlapping evidence and part of the speaker’s effort to conceal the
offense. See Ruiz, 894 F.2d at 505; Potamitis, 739 F.2d at 791 (citing United States v. Carson,
464 F.2d 424, 436 (2d Cir. 1972); Sweig, 441 F.2d at 118-19) (affirming denial of a severance
motion where the false statements “concern the substantive offenses” and citing cases where the
perjury count’s proof overlapped with the evidence on the substantive counts). With respect to
that analysis, the defendant cites no case for the proposition that the setting in which the statement
is made is significant, much less determinative. Cf Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at 1190 (false statement
