Finally, the defense argues that this motion is purely tactical on the part of the Government,
because this motion affords sympathy to the victims. (Def. Opp. at 22). Remarkably—and
unfortunately—the defense again repeats their claim that testimony is being fabricated. (/d.). The
Government is responding to the real concerns of its victims, as it is duty-bound to do, and as is
common in cases involving sexual abuse. It has also already agreed to a jury instruction, as is
sometimes given in these cases, explaining that the use of pseudonyms and first names should not
be held against the defendant. (See Gov’t Mot. at 14 n.4). If any tactical gamesmanship is
occurring, it is on the part of the defense, which spends a few paragraphs out of nearly twenty
pages of their brief offering conclusory reasons why privacy safeguards undermine a defense
interest. As the defense is well aware, such safeguards are significant to the Minor Victims and
their willingness to testify. But the Court need not arbitrate issues of litigation tactics. The balance
of interests on this issue is clear and weighs in favor of privacy safeguards, as it did in many other
trials involving sex crimes.

information of Minor Victims. As the Court is well aware, the right to access trial evidence is not
absolute, and it can be overcome—especially by information that is “traditionally considered
