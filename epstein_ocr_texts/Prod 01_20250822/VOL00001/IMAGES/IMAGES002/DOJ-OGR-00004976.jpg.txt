Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 317 Filed 08/13/21 Page2of14
® Maxwell moves to dismiss counts five and six on the grounds that prosecuting her on
those counts would violate her rights under the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Court
concludes that Maxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for these offenses and
therefore her prosecution on these counts does not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause.
6 Maxwell moves to dismiss counts five and six as untimely. The Court again concludes,
as it did in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, that the Government brought the
charges within the applicable statute of limitations.
® Maxwell moves to dismiss count five and either count one or count three as
multiplicitous. The Court again determines, as it did in its April 16, 2021 Opinion &
Order, that this motion is premature and denies it without prejudice for renewal at trial.
e Maxwell moves to dismiss the S2 indictment for pre-indictment delay. The Court again
concludes, as it did in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, that Maxwell has not
established that she suffered prejudice and therefore any delay has not violated her
rights to due process.
® Maxwell moves for a bill of particulars related to counts five and six because they are
too vague, and in particular do not provide specific dates. The Court again concludes,
as it did in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, that the charges are sufficiently
specific.
6 Maxwell moves to compel the Government to produce the statements of ““Minor-Victim
4” in the S2 indictment as Brady material. The Court concludes that the current
disclosure schedule gives Maxwell sufficient time to make effective use of any such
statements and therefore immediate disclosure is not warranted.
1. Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement does not bar the charges in the S2
indictment
In its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order on Maxwell’s first set of pretrial motions, the
Court held that the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida did not bar the charges against Maxwell in
the S1 superseding indictment. See United States v. Maxwell, No. 20-cr-330 (AJN), 2021 WL
1518675, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 16, 2021). Maxwell now renews those arguments for the charges
in the S2 superseding indictment. The Court understands the primary purpose of Maxwell’s
renewed motion to be to preserve these arguments for appellate review, and the Court denies the
