alleged omissions and correcting the alleged errors, the “ultimate inquiry” is whether “there
remains a residue of independent and lawful information sufficient to support probable cause.”
United States v. Martin, 426 F.3d 68, 74 (2d Cir. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations
omitted).

“TE]ven if the misrepresented or omitted information was material, a motion to suppress is
to be denied unless the misrepresentations or omissions were intentional or deliberate, or were
made in reckless disregard for the truth.” Lambus, 897 F.3d at 399. The standard to demonstrate
material false statements and omissions in an agent’s affidavit is a “high one.” Rivera v. United
States, 928 F.2d 592, 604 (2d Cir. 1991). The intent prong of Franks is particularly demanding
with respect to omissions. “Franks protects against omissions that are designed to mislead, or that
are made in reckless disregard of whether they would mislead.” Awadallah, 349 F.3d at 68
(emphasis in original). After all, “‘[a]ll storytelling involves an element of selectivity,’ and it is
therefore not necessarily constitutionally significant that an affidavit ‘omit[s] facts which, in
retrospect, seem significant.’” United States v. Lahey, 967 F. Supp. 2d 698, 708 (S.D.N.Y. 2013)
(quoting United States v. Vilar, No. 05 Cr. 621 (KMK), 2007 WL 1075041, at *27 (S.D.N.Y. Apr.
4, 2007)); see also United States v. DeFilippo, No. 17 Cr. 585 (WHP), 2018 WL 740727, at *2
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 31, 2018) (“As courts in this Circuit have recognized, it is not shocking that every
affidavit will omit facts which, in retrospect, seem significant.” (internal quotation marks and
citations omitted)).

The “substantial preliminary showing” requirement explained above exists to “avoid
fishing expeditions into affidavits that are otherwise presumed truthful.” Falso, 544 F.3d at 125.
“(C]onclusory allegations cannot support a Franks challenge as a matter of law.” United States v.
Pizarro, No. 17 Cr. 151 (AJN), 2018 WL 1737236, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 10, 2018); see also
