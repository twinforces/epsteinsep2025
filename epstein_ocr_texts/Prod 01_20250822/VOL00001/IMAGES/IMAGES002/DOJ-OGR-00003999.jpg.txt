the defendant to consult with a contrary expert regarding the newly added count regarding a gun
silencer which added a new “draconian punishment’).

G. Motions

Ms. Maxwell anticipates that the Court will need to resolve various discovery disputes
relating to the problems identified supra. In addition, Ms. Maxwell needs additional time to
supplement her previously filed motions and file additional F. R. Crim. P 12 motions relating to
the second superseding indictment. After reviewing the “new” discovery, Ms. Maxwell
anticipates that she will file motions in limine related to the government’s alleged FRE 404(b)
evidence and the government’s proposed exhibits, FRE 702 challenges to purported expert
testimony, and motions concerning jury selection and change of venue. In addition, expert
disclosure may necessitate a Daubert hearing.

Because Ms. Maxwell has not yet had sufficient time to review and investigate the “new”
discovery and has had insufficient access to existing discovery she is unable to predict precisely
what additional evidentiary motions will be required. The late-filed superseding indictment along
with the late disclosure of Brady material and failure to provide the discovery to Ms. Maxwell
have delayed defense trial preparation and will continue to interfere with various tasks that
would normally be in process at this stage of the proceedings. Simply stated, Ms. Maxwell’s
counsel cannot perform all of the necessary tasks in the time remaining before July 12, 2021.

II. Requested Relief
In United States v. Rojas-Contreras, 474 U.S. 231 (1985), Justice Blackmun, in a
concurring opinion joined by Justice Brennan, recognized the need for a continuance when a
superseding indictment adds significant changes.
