Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
The Court has considered the parties’ proposals regarding the commencement of trial.
Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the Government’s letter, the Court will request
November 29, 2021 from the Clerk’s Office as the trial start date—that is the date (pending
approval from the Clerk’s Office consistent with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening
statements will be made to the jury. However, the Court will also request from the Clerk’s
Office that jury selection occur during the week of November 15. Counsel shall plan
accordingly.
The Court grants the Government’s motion to exclude time until November 29, 2021.
The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial
computations for the period from today’s date through November 29, 2021, outweigh the
interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to
permit the defense to continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding
indictment; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in /imine; to permit the parties to
make and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allow adequate time for the parties to
prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. §
3161(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2021.
