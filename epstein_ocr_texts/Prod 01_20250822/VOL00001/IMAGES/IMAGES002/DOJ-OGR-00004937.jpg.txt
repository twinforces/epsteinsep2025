Ce On the Current Record, the Court Cannot Find That the Protective Order
Was “Improvidently Granted”
Under Martindell, a Rule 26(c) protective order may be modified, for among other
reasons, where a party can show “improvidence in the grant.” 594 F.2d at 296. While the
Government has not moved for modification on these grounds, I address this factor in light of the
current proceedings before the Second Circuit.
The term is not well understood. See United States v. Taleo Contractors, Inc., 153 |
F.R.D. 501, 511 (W.D.N.Y. 1994) (observing that the Circuit “provided no guidance as to what |
might constitute ‘improvidence in the grant of a... protective order’”). To date, the Second |
Circuit has identified two ways in which an order might be considered “improvidently granted.” |
The first is, essentially, that it was issued in bad faith. However, this is a high bar. For example, |
a sealing order is “improvidently granted” where the presiding judge “reasonably should have |
recognized that [it] would facilitate or further criminal activity.” Palmieri, 779 F.2d at 865-66. |

But there is absolutely no evidence that the district court harbored any such realization; indeed, |
at the time Judge Sweet entered the Order, it appeared that criminal activity against Maxwell and

2 In 2007, financier Jeffrey Epstein plead guilty to two prostitution charges in state court, arising from
allegations that he “assembl[ed] a large, cult-like network of underage girls-—with the help of young female
recruiters” (including Maxwell)—whom he coerced into performing sex acts “behind the walls of his opulent
waterfront mansion,” among other locations, “as often as three times a day.” Julie K. Brown, How a future Trump
Cabinet member gave a serial sex abuser the deal of a lifetime, Miami Herald (Nov. 28, 2018),

agreement with the Department of Justice, which immunized Epstein and four named accomplices from all federal
charges, broadly immunized “any potential co-conspirators,” and—in contravention of federal law—kept the
agreement secret from Epstein’s victims. Jd. Epstein served just thirteen months in county jail, during part of which
he was permitted to continue working from his downtown office. Jd.
In November 2018, the Miami Herald published a series of feature articles describing the allegations
against Epstein and suggesting that the plea deal constituted Government misconduct. Liam Stack, U.S. Opens

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/06/us/fbi-jeffrey-epstein.html. The exposé garnered attention from the media
and from Congress and has apparently prompted an investigation by the Department of Justice. Jd. Whether the
grand jury subpoena arose out of this renewed interest in Epstein’s behavior is ultimately not relevant to the Court’s
decision—but it seems likely.
