° AK.did not.expréss any concems about anything to ‘the attorneys. AK may have asked,
something like whether the attorneys are asking SDNY to re-do'the Florida. investigation
because AK: was trying to understand what the attorneys ‘were proposing: ‘was it looking
at the same: conduct that was investigated in.Florida and. mishandled, or was it: looking at
different conduct.and possibly ongoing conduct? AK. recalls, asking questions:to clarify
that point. : oe : |
what the attorneys were describing a and what the conduct was. AK would not have:
responded to.a question, asking’ about why AK wouldn’t just open an. investigation.
Purpose ofthe: mecting ‘was: for AK to’ understand: what the arromneys ‘W were: trying to
to do.

0 Brad. Edwards’s book suggesting that the AUSA. seemed “confident that a case would. be
brought” does not ‘seem. accurate to. AK. AK didnot intend to give such an impression
during the meeting. That decision is not-one for AK.to make alone, in any event.

0 AK docs:not recall,any mention that the number of victims.in NY far execeded the

° Brad Edwards’s.description of wanting.a case against Epstein is:consistent with,AK’s
recollection that the focus was on Epstein.

° Ifanyone called AK, she docs notiremember that, and she would.not have mentioned the
comity shown. to other USAOs around. the: country.

e AK doesnot recall. anyone ever approaching her to ask if SDNY would, consider charging
Maxwell. with. perjury.

o AK.has a.vague memory'that the attorneys called or, cmailed.AK at Somme point.
and told her that there had been depositions, presumably. by. contact from.one of.
these lawyers, but AK cannot recall the specifics. AK. does not ‘remember.one
way or the other. if.any of the attorneys:referenced the:possibility of perjury.

o AK-recalls thinking;that'a perjury investigation would-have. the same challenges.
AK: rcealls thinking’ in her*mind that if the depositions ‘were about the underlying
conduct that, had. all of the ‘issucs' that. gave AK pause after the meeting (length, of
time that had. passed, sense: there must-have been a.rcason.SDFL resolved the case:
the. Way they did) Were:not alleviated by a perjury-based prosecution.

© AK.does'not recall ever knowing anything about the substance of the depositions
and does not remember anyone sending her a deposition transcript.

o AK.does not remember who had'been deposed or who might have been the
subject of a possible perjury investigation.

o No investigation. into perjury was ever opened.

e AK-took no further action.re. Epstein after calling Scan. Watson.

© Though there may be emails or calls AK cannot remember, she knows that she
took ‘no action after the call to'Scan Watson. Part.of the reason AK felt, horrible
when reading the Miami-Herald article was because AK.took no action after
calling Scan Watson.
