definitions share some key similarities, many behaviors may be classified as
grooming under some definitions but not under others. Some of these sim-
ilarities in definition include the criterion of preparing a child for abuse
(Brackenridge, 2001; Craven, Brown, & Gilchrist, 2006; Gallagher, 1999),
gaining a child’s trust (Berson, 2003; Craven et al., 2006; Gillespie, 2002;
Salter, 1995), making it more difficult to the child to resist or disclose the
abuse (Berson, 2003; Craven et al., 2006; Gallagher, 1999; Gillespie, 2002;
Knoll, 2010; Leberg, 1997), and the enumeration of specific tactics used to
groom the child (Berson, 2003; Gallagher, 1999; Sgroi, 1982).

Furthermore, a variety of different kinds of definitional features are pro-
posed. For example, one definition mentions “betrayal” (Salter, 1995) while
another references “courtship” (Howitt, 1995). Some proposed definitions
give concrete examples of grooming (Gallagher, 1999; Sgroi, 1982), while
others try to give abstract properties to capture what the authors take to be
the essential properties of grooming (O’Connell, 2003; Spiegel, 2003). Some
definitions are fairly brief and more vague (Brackenridge, 2001; Howitt, 1995;
Spiegel, 2003), whereas others are much longer and more detailed about
what grooming looks like (Berson, 2003; Craven et al., 2006; Sgroi, 1982).
Obviously this heterogeneity presents serious challenges for forensic and
clinical work.

Some of these definitions involve additional difficulties in that the terms
used to define grooming present additional serious definitional problems
themselves. For example, Salter (1995) used the phrase “emotional seduc-
tion” in her grooming definition. This requires further delineation of what
exactly emotional seduction entails as well as a measurement strategy to
validly capture this alleged dimension. As another example, Spiegel’s (2003)
definition involves constructs such as “boundary diffusion” and “role con-
fusion.” These constructs are not part of the standard scientific lexicon and
thus create further impediments to enhancing our scientific understanding of
the grooming process. Finally, some definitions propose stages of grooming,
