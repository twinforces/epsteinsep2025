United States v.. Vickers, No. 1 3-CR-128-A, 2014 WL 1 838255, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. May 8,
2014),-also.docs not help the government. This case concerned a one count indictment:in 2013. It.
is patently clear from the opinion by the district court that the statements ‘from the alleged victim.
detailing the allegation had. been provided to the defendant and the court which noted that the:
lengthy recitation of facts in the-opinion “are taken from the allegations set forth in the.A ffidavit
of Federal Burcau of Investigation Special Agent Jennifer Jayne Amo submitted in support of the
May- 16, 2013 Criminal;Complaint (Dkt-# 1), the Indictment (Dkt-# 8); and the government's
response to the instant:motions (Dkt.# 20).” 2014 WL 1838255, at *3 n.1. The datcs-and times
of the alleged conduct would haye been fairly easy to identify given:the detail provided in
discovery..Here, Ms. Maxwell has:not been. provided with any,relevant statements by the
government or iis witnesses.

The government’s attempt'to hide behind thie general proposition that children cannot be
‘expecied to remember dates. also fails. Resp. at 155.:The alleged victims here are not children,
they are adults. Morcover,,a review of the case relied on by the government, United States v.
Young,.No. 08-CR-285,(KMK), 2008 WL.4178190, at #2 (S:.D.N.Y. Sept.4, 2008), demonstrates
the proper way to’charge these types of allegations (which.is not as the government did here):

Count One alleges that Defendant sexually abused. Victim One, aged fourteen at:

the time; during the daytime ona Saturday in‘or about the Fall of 2006; Count

Two: alleges that Defendant sexually abused, Victim One, ‘aged fifteen at the time,

during the daytime ona Saturday i in: or about. September 2007; and Count Three:

alleges that Defendant scxually. abused. Victim Two, aged sixtecn-at the time, on

an evening in-or about. ‘the Summer. of 2006.. Stated. differently, the: three counts

each specify a, particular time of day (daytime or evening), .and feature variances

in date ranges, stretching from roughly. four:days in Count Two to thirteen days in
Count One. to four months in Count Three:
