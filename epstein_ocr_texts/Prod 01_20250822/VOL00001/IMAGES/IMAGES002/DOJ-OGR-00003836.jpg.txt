Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 213 Filed 04/16/21 Page4of8
years ago that may be applicable to dozens of people in multiple places including a foreign
country.

United States v. Vickers, No. 13-CR-128-A, 2014 WL 1838255, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. May 8,
2014), also does not help the government. This case concerned a one count indictment in 2013. It
is patently clear from the opinion by the district court that the statements from the alleged victim
detailing the allegation had been provided to the defendant and the court which noted that the
lengthy recitation of facts in the opinion “are taken from the allegations set forth in the Affidavit
of Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent Jennifer Jayne Amo submitted in support of the
May 16, 2013 Criminal Complaint (Dkt.# 1), the Indictment (Dkt.# 8), and the government's
response to the instant motions (Dkt.# 20).” 2014 WL 1838255, at *3 n.1. The dates and times
of the alleged conduct would have been fairly easy to identify given the detail provided in
discovery. Here, Ms. Maxwell has not been provided with any relevant statements by the
government or its witnesses.

The government’s attempt to hide behind the general proposition that children cannot be
expected to remember dates also fails. Resp. at 155. The alleged victims here are not children,
they are adults. Moreover, a review of the case relied on by the government, United States v.
Young, No. 08-CR-285 (KMK), 2008 WL 4178190, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2008), demonstrates
the proper way to charge these types of allegations (which is not as the government did here):

Count One alleges that Defendant sexually abused Victim One, aged fourteen at

the time, during the daytime on a Saturday in or about the Fall of 2006; Count

Two alleges that Defendant sexually abused Victim One, aged fifteen at the time,

during the daytime on a Saturday in or about September 2007; and Count Three

alleges that Defendant sexually abused Victim Two, aged sixteen at the time, on

an evening in or about the Summer of 2006. Stated differently, the three counts

each specify a particular time of day (daytime or evening), and feature variances

in date ranges stretching from roughly four days in Count Two to thirteen days in

Count One to four months in Count Three.
