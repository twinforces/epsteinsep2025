counsel is not afforded an opportunity to gain the necessary information upon which to base such
strikes.”). Without the opportunity for counsel to effectively probe for hidden prejudices, it
would be difficult to accomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory
challenges.

A. The Attorneys Have More In-Depth Knowledge of the Case
It is counsel, not the Court, who is in the best position to obtain the information necessary

to exercise intelligent peremptory challenges through attorney-conducted voir dire. The
attorneys have more in-depth knowledge of the case than the Court. See, e.g., United States v.
Cleveland, 1997 WL 2554 at *3 (E.D. LA. Jan. 2, 1997). Important follow-up questions are more
likely to occur to an advocate than a judge for several reasons, including the fact that a judge
“does not have the advocate's awareness that soon [s]he will be making peremptory challenges
based on inferences from what prospective jurors have said” and the fact that “the judge does not
know the case of either party in detail, so that [s]he cannot realize when responses have opened
areas for further inquiry.”” As the Fifth Circuit has recognized:

A judge cannot have the same grasp of the facts, the complexities

and nuances as the trial attorneys entrusted with the preparation of

the case. The court does not know the strength and weaknesses of

each litigant’s case. Justice requires that each lawyer be given an

opportunity to ferret out possible bias and prejudice of which the

juror himself may be unaware until certain facts are revealed.
Ledee, 549 F.2d at 993 (citing Frates and Greer, Jury Voir Dire: The Lawyer’s Perspective, 2
A.B.A. Litigation No. 2 (1976)). Indeed, the Fifth Circuit later amplified this concept, stating
that “voir dire may have little meaning if it is not conducted at least in part by counsel.”

While Federal Rules [sic] of Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives wide

discretion to the trial Court, voir dire may have little meaning if it is

not conducted at least in part by counsel. The "federal" practice of

almost exclusive voir dire examination by the Court does not take
