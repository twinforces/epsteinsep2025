Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government submits this letter pursuant to the Court’s Order dated October 5, 2021
(Dkt. No. 337) directing the parties to confer and submit a joint letter estimating when the jury is
likely to begin deliberations. The parties have conferred, in accordance with the Court’s Order.

Government Position: The Government estimates that it would rest within four weeks
from the start of the trial. That estimate is conservative, and the Government anticipates that it
could rest as early as the third week of trial, provided that the cross examinations of witnesses do
not exceed the length of direct examinations. In an abundance of caution, however, the
Government projects approximately four weeks for its case in chief.

As the defense notes below, conversations between the parties about the length of trial are
ongoing. The Government timely produced its exhibit list, witness list, and Jencks Act material
to the defense yesterday. !

Although the anticipated length of trial may change, based on current estimates and the
! Specifically, the Government produced those materials by FedEx and by making them available for pickup at the
US. Attorney’s Office, as is usual practice.
