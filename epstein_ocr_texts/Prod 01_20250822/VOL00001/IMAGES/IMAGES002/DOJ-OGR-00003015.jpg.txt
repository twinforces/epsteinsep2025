Even if the defendant could establish any actual prejudice—which she cannot—such
prejudice would be “necessary but not sufficient” to establish a due process claim. Lovasco, 431
U.S. at 790. The defendant’s motion fails because she has not demonstrated the other necessary
element to prevail: that the claimed delay by the Government was intentional and deliberate to
gain a strategic advantage. Here, as in Lovasco, any pre-indictment delay was the result of the
Government’s continuing investigation of the case. The Lovasco Court held that the investigative
delay did not deprive the defendant of his due process rights and noted that imposing a duty upon
prosecutors to file charges as soon as probable cause exists “‘would have a deleterious effect both
upon the rights of the accused and upon the ability of society to protect itself.’” Jd. at 791 (quoting
United States v. Ewell, 383 U.S. 116, 120 (1966)).

The same is true in the present case. The defendant has not shown—and cannot show—
that the Government caused any pre-indictment delay in this case to gain a tactical advantage. The
defendant argues that “[t]actical, reckless, and bad faith motives can reasonably be inferred from
the way the government has ignored evidence, delayed any prosecution, enlisted partisan lawyers
to do its bidding, circumvented established precedent to illegally obtain evidence, and
misleadingly quoting banal testimony so that it could be labeled ‘perjury.’” (Def. Mot. 7 at 15).
But rhetoric aside, the defendant offers nothing beyond baseless speculation in support of her
claims.

The defendant claims a twenty-six-year delay on the part of the Government in bringing
Counts One through Four and a four-year delay as to Counts Five and Six. (Def. Mot. 7 at 4).
That is not so. The USAO-SDNY opened its investigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators in
late November 2018. See Section IV, infra. Epstein was charged by indictment on July 2, 2019.
Thereafter, the Government continued its investigation, which included interviewing two victims
