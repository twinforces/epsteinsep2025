persons protected by a constitutional, common-law, or statutory privilege is particularly applicable
to grand jury proceedings.”) (citations omitted).

Finally, even were the Court to apply the Martindell test here,* despite the significant
distinguishing factors described above, this Investigation is a paradigmatic example of
extraordinary circumstances. In the first instance, unlike in Subpoena Duces Tecum, the posture
of the Application does not involve a motion to quash. Of course, should this Court permit Boies
Schiller to respond, Boies Schiller would have the right to move to quash—including, for example,
if a grand jury subpoena made any improper requests, such as for materials subject to privilege.
But it is not anticipated that Boies Schiller will do so.

Additionally, as set forth in the Application, the existence and scope of the Investigation
in this district is not publicly known. While counsel for certain victims are aware of the
Investigation, neither Epstein nor other subjects of the investigation are believed to be similarly
aware. Accordingly, the ordinary exercise of grand jury power to “subpoena witnesses to testify,
regardless of whether they have already testified or furnished documentary evidence in civil
litigation,” Martindell, 594 at 296, would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the
possibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to
destroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that
caused the Government to proceed via subpoena and its related Application. Cf Subpoena Duces
Tecum, 945 F.2d at 1224 (in which the party that moved to quash the relevant subpoena argued
that the government could not meet its burden of showing need for deposition testimony until it
had at least called the witness before the grand jury).

The subject matter of the Litigation also demonstrates the extraordinary circumstances of
the Government’s Investigation and Application, insofar as the materials at issue here appear not
to be of the sort that ordinarily would provide protection against Government investigation. See
> To read Martindell more broadly would not only be contrary to the opinion itself, as described
above, but would risk rendering that opinion in even further conflict with the well-reasoned
decisions of numerous other Circuits. In particular, the Fourth, Ninth, and Eleventh Circuits have
each adopted a per se rule favoring enforcement of a grand jury subpoena even where a protective
order exists. See In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 836 F.2d 1468, 1477 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 487
U.S. 1240 (1988); Zn re Grand Jury Subpoena Served on Meserve, Mumper & Hughes, 62 F.3d
1222, 1226-1227 (9th Cir. 1995); In re Grand Jury Proceedings (Williams), 995 F.2d 1013, 1020
(11th Cir. 1993) (expressly criticizing the Martindell test and stating that it “is administratively
unworkable,” “defies construction,” and “places prosecutors in untenable positions”). In the First
and Third Circuits, a grand jury subpoena overrides a protective order unless the party seeking to
quash the subpoena shows “exceptional circumstances that clearly favor subordinating the
subpoena to the protective order.” In re Grand Jury Subpoena (Roach), 138 F.3d 442, 445 (1st
Cir.), cert. denied, 524 U.S. 939 (1998); In re: Grand Jury, 286 F.3d 153, 157-158 (3d Cir.
2002). The Government is aware of no case in those circuits where the presumption was rebutted
and the grand jury subpoena was not enforced.

* An application of the Martindell test would not in any event preclude the provision of a list of
witnesses deposed, see 594 F.2d at 293, and of pre-existing documents collected or produced in
the course of discovery, see id. at 297 n.8.
