Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 209  Filed.04/16/21 Page3of5

allegations in the indictment continues to'prej udice:Ms. Maxwell’s: ability to investigate.and
defend this matter. It is fundamentally unfair for the government to withhold basic information
while atthe same lime. making representations about ‘that information 1o.the Court when
convenient. This type of sclective disclosure by onc party. in litigation is disfavored. See,

e.g., United States v. Nobles, 422.U.S.225,:(1975);, Uniled States v. Bilzerian; 926 F.2d 1285 (2d
Cir. 1991); In. re Grand Jury Proceedings, 219 F.34.175, 182-84 (2d Cir.2000); Granite
Partners, LP. v. Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc; 184-F.R:D..49, 54 (S:.D.N-Y. 1999); Worthington v:
Endee; 177 F.R.D. 113, 116-17 (N.D.N-Y. 1998); Peck v. United States, 514 F. Supp. 210, 213
(S:D.N-Y..), on reargument, 522 F: Supp. 245 (S:D.N-Y. 1981); Siaie of N..D. ex rel: Olson vi.
Andrus, 581F:2d,177, 182 (8th Cir. 1978) (selective disclosure exhibited by the. government in.
this actionis “intolerable as a-matter of policy”).

It would be inefficient and a waste of judicial resources to’continue'to litigate this issue’
piccemeal. Morcover, until:Ms. Maxwell has complete rclevant-in formation, she cannot préciscly
identify the many: witnesses and documents that-are unavailable.to her asa result of thepretrial
delay.

Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court defer consideration of her Motion to
Dismiss Counts-One Through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay: until
after the government has prodticed.all of the discovery in this matter, including, but not limited.
to. any alleged F.R.E, 404(b) information, all witness statements, and:all Brady.and Giglio
material.
