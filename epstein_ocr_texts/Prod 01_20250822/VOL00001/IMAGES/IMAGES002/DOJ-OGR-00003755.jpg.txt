allegations in the indictment continues to prejudice Ms. Maxwell’s ability to investigate and
defend this matter. It is fundamentally unfair for the government to withhold basic information
while at the same time making representations about that information to the Court when
convenient. This type of selective disclosure by one party in litigation is disfavored. See,

e.g., United States v. Nobles, 422 U.S. 225, (1975); United States v. Bilzerian, 926 F.2d 1285 (2d
Cir. 1991); In re Grand Jury Proceedings, 219 F.3d 175, 182—84 (2d Cir.2000); Granite
Partners, L.P. v. Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc., 184 F.R.D. 49, 54 (S.D.N.Y. 1999); Worthington v.
Endee, 177 F.R.D. 113, 116-17 (N.D.N.Y. 1998); Peck v. United States, 514 F. Supp. 210, 213
(S.D.N.Y.), on reargument, 522 F. Supp. 245 (S.D.N.Y. 1981); State of N. D. ex rel. Olson v.
Andrus, 581 F.2d 177, 182 (8th Cir. 1978) (selective disclosure exhibited by the government in
this action is “intolerable as a matter of policy”).

It would be inefficient and a waste of judicial resources to continue to litigate this issue
piecemeal. Moreover, until Ms. Maxwell has complete relevant information, she cannot precisely
identify the many witnesses and documents that are unavailable to her as a result of the pretrial
delay.

CONCLUSION

Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court defer consideration of her Motion to
Dismiss Counts One Through Six of the Superseding Indictment for Pre-Indictment Delay until
after the government has produced all of the discovery in this matter, including, but not limited
to any alleged F.R.E. 404(b) information, all witness statements, and all Brady and Giglio
material.
