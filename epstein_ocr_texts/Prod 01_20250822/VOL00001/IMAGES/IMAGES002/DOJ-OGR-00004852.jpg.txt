in prison. Cosby was denied bail pending an appeal. He filed post-sentence motions
seeking a new trial and a modification of his sentence, which were denied.

Cosby timely filed a notice of appeal, prompting the trial court to: order him to file a
concise statement .of errors complained of on appeal pursuant ‘to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b).

Cosby complied. On May 14, 2019, the trial court responded ‘to Cosby’s. concise
statement with its opinion, issued pursuant to Pa.R.A.P. 1925(a).

under Rule 404(b). The panel observed that a, réviewing court must evaluate the
admission of evidence pursuant to the abusé-of-discretion standard. Jd. at 397.

crime, so as to effectively eliminate the possibility that it could have been committed by
anyone other than the accused.” /d. at. 398 (citing Commonwealth v. Miller, 664 A.2d
1310, 1318.(Pa. 1995)). Although the common plan, scheme, or design rationale typically
is used to establish the identity of a perpetrator of a particular crime, the Superior Court
pointed out that courts previously have also. used the exception “to counter [an]
anticipated defense of consent.” /d. (quoting Tyson, 119:A.3d at 361).

In Tyson, Jermeel Omar Tyson brought food to his victim, who was. feeling ill.
