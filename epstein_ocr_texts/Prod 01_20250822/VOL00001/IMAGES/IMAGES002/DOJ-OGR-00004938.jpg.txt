; To Be Filed Under Seal
Order itself facilitated or furthered criminal activity; and the record contains no evidence of bad
faith. |
The second way in which a protective order might be “improvidently granted” is if the :
presiding judge did not require the moving party to show “good cause” for entering an order that :
permitted documents to be filed with the court under seal. It was long the law that the parties |
needed to make a document-by-document showing of good cause whenever discovery materials |
were filed with the court under seal. Jn re Agent Orange Prod. Liab, Litig., 821 F.2d 139, 148 |
(2d Cir. 1987) (Agent Orange). |
In recent years, however, the Second Circuit has relaxed the Rule 26(c) “good cause” |
showing for discovery materials that are never filed with the court, in light of changes to the |
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 233 n.11. The new, more lax |
standard recognizes that, “Without an ability to restrict public dissemination of certain discovery |
materials that are never introduced at trial, litigants would be subject to needless annoyance, |
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense.” Iridium India Telecom Ltd. v. |
Motorola, Inc., 165 F. App’x 878, 881 (2d Cir. 2005) (summary order) (emphasis added) |
(quoting TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 229). |
As a result, the “good cause” showing necessary for entry of a blanket pretrial protective |
order like the one entered in Giuffre is not onerous. Dorsett v. Cty. of Nassau, 289 F.R.D. 54, 67 |
(E.D.N.Y. 2012). “[W]here “a protective order (1) is entered on a showing of good cause as |
required by Rule 26(c), (2) is limited to the context of pretrial civil discovery, and (3) does not |
restrict the dissemination of the information if gained from other sources,” it is not improvidently |
granted. Jd. (quoting Seattle Times Co. v. Rhinehart, 467 U.S. 20, 37 (1984)); see also |
