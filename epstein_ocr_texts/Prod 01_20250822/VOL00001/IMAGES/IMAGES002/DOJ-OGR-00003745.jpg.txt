The new victims will establish at trial that the Government violated their CVRA rights in
the same way as it violated the rights of the other victims. The new victims’ participation in this
case is important because it appears that the Government intends to raise a factual defense that
somehow it did keep Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 properly informed of what was happening in
the criminal prosecution. Of course, if four victims all testify consistently that they were not
properly informed by the Government (as we believe they will), that provides a stronger case for
a CVRA violation.
In addition, Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4’s participation is relevant to a defense the
Court has allowed the Government to raise. The Court has previously ruled that the victims’
request for rescission of the NPA “implicates a fact-sensitive equitable defense which must be
considered in the historical factual context of the entire interface between Epstein, the relevant
prosecutorial authorities and the federal offense victims — including an assessment of the
allegation of a deliberate conspiracy between Epstein and federal prosecutors to keep the victims
in the dark on the pendency of negotiations between Epstein and federal authorities until well
after the fact and presentation of the non-prosecution agreement to them as a fait accompli.” DE
189 at 12 n.6 (emphasis added). Jane Doe #3’s and Jane Doe #4’s participation in this case will
help to show what the “entire interface” was between the Government and the victims and thus
to respond to the Government’s estoppel arguments as well as other defenses that it appears to be
preparing to raise. See, e.g., DE 62 (52-page response from the Government to the victim’s
summary judgment motion, raising numerous factually-based and other arguments against the
victim’s position).
