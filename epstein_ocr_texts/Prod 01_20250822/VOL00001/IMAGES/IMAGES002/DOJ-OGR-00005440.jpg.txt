United States v. Castro, 813 F.2d 571, 575-76 (2d Cir. 1987)). But this doctrine “has never
required the admission of portions of a statement that are neither explanatory of nor relevant to
the admitted passages.” United States v. Williams, 930 F.3d 44, 58 (2d Cir. 2019) (internal
quotation marks and alterations omitted); see id. at 61 (“[T]he rule of completeness does not
require the admission of self-serving exculpatory statements in all circumstances.” (emphasis in
original)). This rule is strictly applied, leading the Second Circuit to hold, for example, that a
defendant could not introduce a portion of his confession relating “to the execution of [a]
robbery,” where the portion introduced by the Government concerned only “plans to execute the
robbery.” Johnson, 507 F.3d at 796 (emphasis in original).

The Government expects to offer certain of the defendant’s written statements contained
in her emails and oral statements through witness testimony. To the extent the defendant wishes
to offer her own out-of-court statements, they are hearsay, whether in emails, deposition
transcripts, or elsewhere. And unless they accomplish the narrow function of the rule of
completeness, the Court should preclude them. Given the limited admissibility of such
statements, and to avoid mid-trial delays, the Government requests that (a) to the extent the
defense seeks to admit such evidence during the Government’s case-in-chief during cross-
examination of witnesses, the defense preview with the Government and the Court prior to each
trial day any statement of the defendant it intends to admit, so that any evidentiary issues can be
addressed outside of the trial day; and (b) that the defendant be required to mark any such
statements that she intends to offer during her case-in-chief at the time of her Rule 26.2
disclosures.
