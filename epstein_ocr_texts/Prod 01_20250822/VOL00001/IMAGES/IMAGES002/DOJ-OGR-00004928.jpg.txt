To Be:Filed Under Seal

B. Attacks on the Protective Order

Both during and after the settlement.of the Giuffre Action, third parties made highly-
publicized applications:to have documents that: were filed under seal by order of Judge Sweet
unsealed and:made. public. (15-cv-7433, Dkt. Nos. 362, 550, 935.) Harvard Law professor and
crimiiial defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz, whom Giuffre publicly alleged. of perpetrating sex
crimes’ alongside Epstein, moved.to:unseal a limitéed-portion-of the recordin order to clear his
name. (15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 364 at 1.) Alt-right activist and provocateur Michael Cernovich
also sought to utiseal the papers filed as part of Maxwell’s motion for summary judgment,
arguing, “Cernovich Media ‘cannot conduct its Forth [sic] Estate function if this Court-allows the
Parties to conduct'their dispute outside of the normal sunlight of transparency: and accessibility.”
(15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 55].at'1,). The Miami Herald Media Company and investigative journalist.
Julie Brown, whose feature story about-Epstein recetitly gatneréd significant public interest, also
moved post-settlement to unseal the entire record. (15-cv-7433,, Dkt. No. 936.)

All stich applications were denied by Judge Sweet. (15-cv-7433, Dkt. Nos, 439 (sealed),
892, 953.) A consolidated appeal. fromthe orders. deriying ‘the unsealing motions is currently
pending before the Second, Circuit. Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 18-2868 (2d Cir.). On-March.6,
2019, the Court of Appeals. heard argunient on the: consolidated appeal, which was widely
covered in the legal press.. I think it is fair to say'that during the argument, the pariel seemed
critical of the district court’s failure to make specific findings about why. any: particular. document
as to which-unsealing was sought should remain sealed. Forexample,. Circuit. Court Judge Jose
A. Cabranes stated that, Maxwell’s lawyer “[couldn’t] possibly be Serious” whet he argued that

no documents should be made public, even after the case:had settled.
