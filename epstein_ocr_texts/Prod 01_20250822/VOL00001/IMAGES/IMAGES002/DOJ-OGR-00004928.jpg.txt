‘ To Be Filed Under Seal |
B. Attacks on the Protective Order |

Both during and after the settlement of the Giuffre Action, third parties made highly- |
publicized applications to have documents that were filed under seal by order of Judge Sweet |
unsealed and made public. (15-cv-7433, Dkt. Nos. 362, 550, 935.) Harvard Law professor and |
criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz, whom Giuffre publicly alleged of perpetrating sex |
crimes alongside Epstein, moved to unseal a limited portion of the record in order to clear his |
name. (15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 364 at 1.) Alt-right activist and provocateur Michael Cernovich |
also sought to unseal the papers filed as part of Maxwell’s motion for summary judgment, |
arguing, “Cernovich Media cannot conduct its Forth [sic] Estate function if this Court allows the |
Parties to conduct theit dispute outside of the normal sunlight of transparency and accessibility.” |
(15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 551 at 1.) The Miami Herald Media Company and investigative journalist |
I

Julie Brown, whose feature story about Epstein recently garnered significant public interest, also |
moved post-settlement to unseal the entire record. (15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 936.) |
All such applications were denied by Judge Sweet. (15-cv-7433, Dkt. Nos. 439 (sealed), |

892, 953.) A consolidated appeal from the orders denying the unsealing motions is currently |
pending before the Second Circuit. Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 18-2868 (2d Cir.), On March 6, :
2019, the Court of Appeals heard argument on the consolidated appeal, which was widely |
covered in the legal press. I think it is fair to say that during the argument, the panel seemed |
critical of the district court’s failure to make specific findings about why any particular document :
as to which unsealing was sought should remain sealed. For example, Circuit Court Judge Jose |
A. Cabranes stated that Maxwell’s lawyer “[couldn’t] possibly be serious” when he argued that |
no documents should be made public, even after the case had settled.! |
