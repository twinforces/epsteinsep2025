to describe the window of when a violation, oceurred.” United States v» Kidd, 386 F.Supp. 34,
364, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (quoting United States. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 1294, 1323 (2d Cir:
1987)). “This is especially truc:in cases of:scxual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse
of underage victims often, proeced without specific dates of the offenses.” United States v.
Young, No. 08-cr-285.(KMK), 2008 WL 41.78 190, at'*2(S.D.N-Y. Sept. 4, 2008) (collecting
cases). As here, these cases frequently involve alleged abuse: spanning a lengthy period of time,
and. witnesses who'were victimized as children may'struggle to'recall the precise dates, when
abuse occurred.. The indictment adequately describes the time and place ofthe charged conduct.

Maxwell next contends that.allegations of noncriminal, conduct render the charges
impermissibly vague. The Court disagrees. Rule 7'requires only that.the language of the:
indictment-track:the language ofthe statute: and provide a rough.account.of the time and_place.of
thecrime. Yramunti, 513 Pi2d,at 11.13. The language of the S1.'superseding indictment does so:
The Government’s. decision to provide more, details than those. strictly required docs not.hamper
Maxwell’s ability: to prepare a defense. Maxwell’s argument that some of the conduct alleged is
not inherently criminal goes to the merits of the Government’s case, not: the specificity. of the
charges.

Finally, Maxwell argues that.the indictment is vague because the government does not,
‘provide thé names of the:alléged victims. The Court sées no basis to require that. the alleged,
victims” names. be included the indictment. The names of victims, even:if important, ‘generally
need_not appear there unless their omission would seriously prejudice the defendant. See United
States v. Siringer, 730.F.3d 120,127 (2d Cir..2013); Unitéd States ¥. Kidd, 386.F. Supp. 3d 364,
369.(S:D.N.Y..2019). Maxwell likely knows the identity of the-alleged victims described. in the

indictment. at’this point: because the Government has provided extensive. discovery on them.
