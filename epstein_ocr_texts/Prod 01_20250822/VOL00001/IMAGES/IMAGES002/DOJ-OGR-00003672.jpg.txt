transportation ofa child’ with the‘requisite.intent, 18:U-S.C. § 2423(a); it does ‘not necessarily
entail. “*the:employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion of a child” to ‘do
unlawful séxwal activity, a § 2422(a)-offense has beén committed, but no sexual abuse of'a child
has occurred. If a defendant transports a.minor withthe intent (unbeknownstto the minor) that
the minor will engage ‘in, sexual activity, no sexual activity occurs, and there is no “employment,
US, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion” to engage in sexual activity, a § 2423(a)
offense has been committed, but no.sexual abuse of.a child has occurred.

No.. 13 Cr. 128 (RJA) (HKS),.2014. WL 1838255 (W.D.N.Y.. May 8, 2014), the court held that.a
§ 2423(a) offense involved sexual abuse, but it did not hold:that.§ 2423(a) necessarily entails
sexual abuse; instead, the court;used.a fact-based ‘approach. Jd, at *11 (“defendant Vickers is
charged with transportation ofa. minor in violation of [§ 2423(a)] and itis alleged that the
defendant did have sexual contact with Victim.1”) (emphasis added). No court has‘held that
either, the enticement of an:individual to travel, or the transportation. of a minor necessarily: entails
“sexual. abuse” within, the meaning of §'3283.. It does not. The governinent therefore cannot and

should:not prevail.
