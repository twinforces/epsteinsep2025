Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document207 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 33 of 34
Given the complexities of the case and the addition of two counts via the S2 indictment, the
Court encourages the parties to agree to approximately eight weeks.

IX. The S2 superseding indictment moots Maxwell’s grand jury challenge

The Court has not received supplemental briefing on the motions in light of the return of
the S2 superseding indictment and so does resolve any such issues here.! However, Maxwell’s
motion seeking to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment because it was returned by a grand jury
sitting at the White Plains courthouse appears moot. Maxwell argued that the use of a grand jury
drawn from the White Plains Division in this District did not represent a fair cross-section of the
community, because her trial would proceed in the Manhattan Division. A grand jury sitting in
Manhattan returned the S2 superseding indictment. By April 21, 2021, Maxwell shall show
cause why her grand jury motion should not be dismissed on that basis.

Conclusion

The Court DENIES Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein’s
non-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. 141), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by the
statute of limitations (Dkt. No. 143), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment delay (Dkt. No.
137), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No. 123), to dismiss the
perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. 135), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. 145), to
dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No. 121), and to expedite pretrial
disclosures (Dkt. No. 147). The Court GRANTS Maxwell’s motion to sever the perjury counts
for a separate trial (Dkt. No. 119).
