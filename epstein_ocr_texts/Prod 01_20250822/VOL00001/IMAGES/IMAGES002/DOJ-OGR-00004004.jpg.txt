the Requests themselves ask for “communications” between, BSF and.a designated party about a.

gencral topic over a five-year period, and then define communications. as “all ‘forms of

correspondence.” Request 2, for example, is for “Communications between: You. and the: United.

States. Attorney between 2015 and the date of this subpocna about.7____——_/J,”” defining’

partner or.cemployee of” BSF; and defining “the United States Attorney” as “any: employee of the:
office of the United States Attorney forthe. Southern District of New York.” This, Request-cannot:
be:read as anything but “w// communications in any form between. anyone who has ever worked at.
BSF in any capacity and anyone who: has ever worked at.the $.D.N:Y. United States Attorney’s
office in. any capacity between 2015 andthe date of this subpocna about(____—S—_].”?_ Thus,
duc‘to their expansive definitions, the Defendant’s requests.are:even broader than thosethat Judge
Gardephe rejected in Avenatti, which were limited:to identified individuals.* Requests 1 through.

5 ofthe subpoena thus fail Nixon’s specificity requirement.

3 The Defendant contends: that Requests 1 through.5 are similar to. those approved. by the

court. in United States v; Wey, 252.F. Supp. 3d 237 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). Resp.Ltr. at 6, But in Wer,
the court originally. denied the defendant’s motion. for the issuance of a Rule 17 subpoena because
it requested: “All emails and. records related ‘to the listing applications and approvals. for
[SmartHeat], [Deer], and [CleanTcch], including in-particular, any communications regarding, or’
interpretation.or. application of, the:300 round-lot sharcholder requirement.” Jd. at 243. The court
found that: the defendant “had. not identified. the documents sought) with ‘the requisite specificity:
and, had failed to :make the necessary showing that all requested documents would be admissible
at trial,” but. granted the defendant Icave to renew is ‘motion and ‘show that: Rule 1°7’s requirements
were: met. Jd. The defendant then submitted .a new set of requests that, unlike the Requests.at.
issue here, limited the request to communications between 4 Certain, specified sct of individuals
and-narrow time periods: of approximately: a:ycar.or Icss. Jd. The:defendant’s renewed-motion-also,

unlike the: Defendant’s response here, “set: forth anticipated bases for admission of the documents
‘at ‘trial through. several, specific exceptions ‘to the hearsay rule.” Jd. ‘Thus, the court granted the
renewed motion: Jd.
