the Requests themselves ask for “communications” between BSF and a designated party about a
general topic over a five-year period, and then define communications as “all forms of
correspondence.” Request 2, for example, is for “Communications between You and the United
States Attorney between 2015 and the date of this subpoena about xy.” defining
“communications” as “all forms of correspondence”; defining “BSF” as “any owner, shareholder,
partner or employee of” BSF; and defining “the United States Attorney” as “any employee of the
office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York.” This Request cannot
be read as anything but “a// communications in any form between anyone who has ever worked at
BSF in any capacity and anyone who has ever worked at the S.D.N.Y. United States Attorney’s
office in any capacity between 2015 and the date of this subpoena about yg.” Thus,
due to their expansive definitions, the Defendant’s requests are even broader than those that Judge
Gardephe rejected in Avenatti, which were limited to identified individuals.? Requests 1 through
5 of the subpoena thus fail Nixon’s specificity requirement.
3 The Defendant contends that Requests 1 through 5 are similar to those approved by the
court in United States v. Wey, 252 F. Supp. 3d 237 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). Resp. Ltr. at 6. But in Wey,
the court originally denied the defendant’s motion for the issuance of a Rule 17 subpoena because
it requested: “All emails and records related to the listing applications and approvals for
[SmartHeat], [Deer], and [CleanTech], including in particular, any communications regarding, or
interpretation or application of, the 300 round-lot shareholder requirement.” /d. at 243. The court
found that the defendant “had not identified the documents sought with the requisite specificity
and had failed to make the necessary showing that all requested documents would be admissible
at trial,” but granted the defendant leave to renew is motion and show that Rule 17’s requirements
were met. /d. The defendant then submitted a new set of requests that, unlike the Requests at
issue here, limited the request to communications between a certain, specified set of individuals
and narrow time periods of approximately a year or less. /d. The defendant’s renewed motion also,
unlike the Defendant’s response here, “set forth anticipated bases for admission of the documents
at trial through several specific exceptions to the hearsay rule.” /d. Thus, the court granted the
renewed motion. /d.
