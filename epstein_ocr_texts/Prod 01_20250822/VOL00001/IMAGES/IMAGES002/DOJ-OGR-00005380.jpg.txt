Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s Order dated
October 22, 2021, attaching the Court’s draft preliminary remarks to be recorded and played before
each questionnaire session and directing the parties to suggest any proposed edits by letter. (Dkt.
No. 366). The Government has no objection to the Court’s proposed remarks. However, the
Government seeks clarification from the Court of the following line in the Court’s draft remarks:
“Throughout the selection process and if you are selected as a juror, although the lawyers and I
will know your names, we will only refer to you in Court by your juror number.” (/d. at 3). In
particular, the Government respectfully requests that the Court clarify for the parties when during
the jury selection process that the parties will be provided with the names of prospective jurors.

The Government understands that during the jury selection process, prospective jurors will
only be referred to in open court by their juror numbers. The Government seeks confirmation that,
consistent with the practice in other high profile cases in this District using jury questionnaires,
the parties will be provided the prospective jurors’ names no earlier than November 16, 2021, the
day that oral voir dire begins. See, e.g., United States v. Skelos, 15 Cr. 317 (KMW)); United States
