I emailed the following response to Ms. Papapetru:

Your accusation is inaccurate as is the information reported to you by your

staff. Nothing in Ms. Maxwell ‘s legal papers was given to her by me or by Leah Saffian,

Esq. Both Ms. Saffian and I dispute these allegations in the strongest terms.

Today, Ms. Saffian and I met with Ghislaine Maxwell for a scheduled legal visit- under

the gaze of 5 guards and a portable camera recording audio and video.

After the legal visit concluded and Ms. Saffian and I left the visiting area, guards accused

Ms. Maxwell of possessing documents obtained from counsel. The guards seized

confidential documents from her, including documents she had previously received in

legal mail delivered to the MDC and given to her by MDC staff. After seizing “highly
confidential” documents (subject to a protective order that your staff is not authorized to
review) and work product, the guards began reading the documents and have not
returned them to Ms. Maxwell.

At no time did the guards, who were assiduously watching and filming the legal

conference, bring any concern to my attention, so it is quite telling that you have been

contacted when counsel are told that legal staff are unavailable during the weekend.

No documents were given to Ms. Maxwell for her retention. Demand is hereby made for

an immediate identification of the documents you claim were not in Ms. Maxwell’s

possession upon entering the legal visiting area in advance of the arrival of counsel, a

list of all guards present during the visit, and a copy of the video recording.

Please immediately return the confiscated legal documents to Ms. Maxwell. They are her

documents, not mine. The confiscation of these documents has deprived Ms. Maxwell of

her time and seriously impaired her ability to review legal documents and prepare for an
upcoming trial, adding to an already difficult situation.

This matter is being reported to the Court and legal action will be initiated.

See Exhibit B.

A notice and demand to preserve items of evidence has been send to Ms. Papapetru. See
Exhibit C.

Confiscation and Review of Confidential Legal Documents

In advance of previous in-person legal visits, guards have gone through Ms. Maxwell’s
legal papers. In a break from such protocol, the guards did not do so prior to commencement of
the legal visit on Saturday.

After the legal conference and departure of counsel, the guards seized all of Ms.
Maxwell’s legal papers, consisting of multiple letter-sized manilla folders containing documents
and a composition notebook within a Redweld folder. The guards told Ms. Maxwell they
believed she improperly retained documents given to her by her attorneys and that this was a
