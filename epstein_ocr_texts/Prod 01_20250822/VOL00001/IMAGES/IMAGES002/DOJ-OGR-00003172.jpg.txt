2012) (affirming Judge Bianco’s “thorough and well-reasoned” opinion). Indeed, “‘[a] selection
process that is facially neutral is unlikely to demonstrate systematic exclusion.’” United States v.
Savage, 970 F.3d 217, 259 (3d Cir. 2020) (brackets in original) (quoting Howell v. Superintendent
Rockview SCI, 939 F.3d 260, 269 (2d Cir. 2019)). Moreover, a defendant cannot “make out a
prima facie case merely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or in combination, might
contribute to a group’s underrepresentation.” Berghuis, 559 U.S. at 332 (emphasis in original).

Insofar as the underrepresentation here is measured by a comparison of the White Plains
Qualified Wheel to the jury eligible population of the “Manhattan Division” or entire Southern
District, the defendant’s argument rests entirely on the prosecution’s decision to pursue an
indictment in White Plains rather than Manhattan. (Def. Mot. 9 at 7). That decision was entirely
proper, as set forth above. See Section XI.C.1, supra. And even if it were the case that this decision
resulted in substantial underrepresentation, it nevertheless does not amount to “systematic
exclusion . . . in the jury-selection process.” The prosecution’s decision as to where to seek an
indictment was based entirely on the availability of grand juries during a pandemic, which has
nothing to do with the process by which the grand jury is selected. The defendant points to no
other source of any supposed systemic exclusion of any identified group. Accordingly, the
defendant’s claim also fails at the third prong of Duren.
