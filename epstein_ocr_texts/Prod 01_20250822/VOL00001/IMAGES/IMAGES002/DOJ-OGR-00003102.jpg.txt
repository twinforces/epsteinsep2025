B. Discussion

The perjury:counts should be tried jointly with:Counts:One through Four: The offenses.are
of similar:character, arc logically connected and will be proved through.much.of the same evidence
because: the’ perjury. counts concern at. least. some of the same conduct relevant, to the crimes
charged, iff Counts One through Four and, as such, are properly joined. See generally Potamitis,
739 F.2d at 791. Severing the counts would:waste judicial-resources by:requiring a second trial at
which the Government would offer similar proof, including by calling the same victims of sexual,
abuse 'to.testify again, at a sccond trial. The defendant has identified ‘no prejudice, sufficient to
justify imposing that‘burden,on the ‘victims, the Court, and the Government.

fact that evidence of the crime charged in one:count may be admissible in. the Government’s direct.
casc:in the trial.of the other-will. typically defeat the need to severe the counts.”). At trial, some of
the ‘most ‘critical cvidence that the defendant committed ‘the: offenses charged in Counts One
through Four will also form'the, crux. of the Government’s proof-of the falsity of the defendants
deposition testimony. In, particular, victim testimony: and rélated evidence offered. to prove the:
existence of Epstcin’s scheme: to abuse underage girls, and Maxwell’s participation therein, will
also. provide much. of the evidence. demonstrating the ‘falsity of the statements. charged. in Count.
Five. Gompare, e.g., Indictment ¥.4(c), (c) (discussing massages resulting in sexual abusc), with
id, ¥.2.1. (denying interacting withundcrage girls and.a denying'a. “scheme to recruit‘undcrage girls
