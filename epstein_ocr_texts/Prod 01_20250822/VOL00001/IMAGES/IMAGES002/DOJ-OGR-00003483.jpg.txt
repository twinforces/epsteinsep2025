Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page:307 of 348

state pleas would resolve ‘the federal investigation, Edwards ‘then filed the CVRA. petition. and,
learned about the NPA: signed months earlier and. that: the ‘federal investigation..of Epstein had.
coneludéd ‘with Epstcin’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received acéess to the NPA ’when, a judge
permitted. it in. August 2008 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this scrics of
interactions, itis not surprising that: Wild came away from. the experience feeling confused. and.
belicving she had. been, misled.

OPR. did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, ‘Sloman,
Menchel, or. Louric opted not to consult:with the victims: in.order to protect Epstcin. or shield the:
NPA from: public: scrutiny: Although,ncither Sloman. nor,Acosta could.recall a specific discussion,
of CVRA, obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knowing that. victim, consultation
‘was not required, and Menchel, also told OPR that consultation was ‘not required, at. Icast. not ‘up: to
the point when he left.the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various ‘points to
consult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA: ‘but was: constrained before: the
N PA was signed by: managers who cither:madeia decision to not consult victims or did not address
the issuc after it, was ‘raised, and after the signing by her own concern about creating ‘possible
impeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.

Nonctheless, a more: open.and straightforward approach with:the victims, both before: and
after the signing of the: NPA, would have been. the better: practice. Before the NPA was signed,
victims could have been, asked for their views about. the general terms the USAO was
contemplating offering, including that .a, plea to state charges was. one of the options being
considered: asked, for’ their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share
their views of how the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to
proceed. with. the NPA, the: government would. have had ‘the benefit of the. victims” thoughts and
‘concerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and. victims would have felt included. .in, the
process. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed. or
considered before the NPA‘was signed.

After the NPA was:signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the
majority: of the: victims until months later and only: after the entry: of Epstein’s guilty plea.
Although the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion. that she acted from a. good faith belief that.
Epstein might breach the NPA and a a potential trial, ‘would. be harmed if.information about. the: NPA
desire: to shicld the victims from. that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of
the openness and fairness of:the:process. As Wild stated during the CVRA. litigation, she believed.
she had’been “mistreated-in the process.” When deciding not. to inform, the victims of the NP‘A to
avoid creating impcachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do ‘not appear: to have
carefully considered possible alternatives to, or'all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did,
they revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person.to discuss a. potential trial or
spoke to Edwards or. other attorneys representing victims. 46 “Furthermore, more attention necded.

“He Itis not .at.all clear whether a.court would have permitted impeachment of. the victims: ‘concerning one

provision. in. a ‘plea ‘agreement. that otherwise could not. be used as-evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. Cf) (The:
‘admissibility or inadmissibility‘of a‘plea, a‘plea discussion, and any?related statementis governed by Ecderal-Rule:of
Evidence 410°"). ‘In. any case, the victims ‘could. have been. impeached regarding the possibility of. their obtaining
monetary: damages through ‘either a civil, suit. or through. .18"U.S.C. § 2255 (if-Epstein. were convicted ‘after.a trial),
