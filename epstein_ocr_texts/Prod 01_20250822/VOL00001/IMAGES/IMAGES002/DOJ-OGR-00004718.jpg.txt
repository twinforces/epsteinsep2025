crimes listed in the NPA overlap with some (but not all) of the offenses:in'the S2'Indictment. But.
at this stage of the litigation, in which ’the Court. has already concluded that the NPA has no force
in. this ‘District, itzmakes no difference what the precise terms ofthe NPA were. The.NPA. has no
bearing on this case.

The balance ofthe. dcefendant’s motion sécks to relitigate the Court’s rulings in. this case,
asserting that the history of the negotiations of the’ NPA indicate that the parties intended broader
coverage. (Def. Mot. at-16). This Court: has firmly rejected that argument and.has concluded that:
“[nJo evidence suggests anyone promised. Epstein that-the NPA would. bar the: prosccution. of his:
coconspirators in other districts.” (Apr. Op. at.6). The motion should-be denied for precisely this
reason.

IT. Counts Five and Six.Are Not Barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause

It is axiomatic: that. “an accused must ‘suffer jcopardy before: he can, suffer double
jeopardy.” Serfass' v. United States, 420 U.S.377, 393 (1975). Here, the. S2. Indictment is the first.
time the defendant has been, charged ‘with 'scx trafficking and scx trafficking conspiracy, and the

Double Jeopardy’ Clause therefore docs not prohibit; prosecution. of ‘those offenses. The
‘defendant’s argument to the contrary: fundamentally misunderstands that Clause’s protections.
“[A]t. its core,” the Double Jeopardy, Clause “means that. those acquitted or convicted of a.
‘particular ‘offence’ cannot. be tricd.a'sccond time for the same‘offence.’” Gamble v. United States,
139 S. Ct. 1960, 1963 (2019). Accordingly, “[a] defendant may only raise a Double: Jeopardy

claim.ifhe has been put in jeopardy (fc., jeopardy has ‘attached’) sometime before the alleged.

‘second’ prosccution.” United States v. Podde, 105 F.3d 813, 816 (2d-Cir. 1997). As the Sccorid.

* At'most, the'scope of the NPA’s coverage would.appear to encompass Counts Five and Six. The
remaining counts encompass conduct that both,postdates and predates the temporal, limitations in,
the NPA, which was expressly limited’to offenses between. 2001 and.2007. (Apr. Op. at 6-7).
