BACKGROUD
The government repeatedly and erroneously argued in the context of Ms. Maxwell’s bail
applications that Ms. Maxwell went into “hiding” following the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein to avoid
detection by law enforcement. See 7/2/2020 Gov’t Mem. in Supp. of Detention (Dkt. 004) at 8
(“[Ms. Maxwell] made intentional efforts to avoid detection”); 7/13/2020 Gov’t Reply Mem. in
Supp. of Detention (Dkt. 022) at 8 (measures that Ms. Maxwell took “to conceal herself” after
Epstein’s indictment “are at least equally consistent with the notion that the defendant also
sought to evade detection by law enforcement”); 12/18/2020 Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def’s
Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt. 100) at 21 (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant
was hiding not just from the press, but also from law enforcement.”). The government also
repeatedly and erroneously argued that Ms. Maxwell’s conduct at the time of her arrest
evidenced an intent to evade law enforcement. See 7/13/2020 Gov’t Reply Mem. in Supp. of
Detention (Dkt. 022) at 7-8; 7/14/2020 Tr. of Bail Hrg. at 31:20-34:5; 12/18/2020 Gov’t Mem. in
Opp. to Def’s Renewed Mot. for Release (Dkt. 100) at 21-22.
The government’s assertion rests on groundless speculation concerning actions which
Ms. Maxwell was forced to take in the days after Epstein’s arrest to protect herself and her
family and friends from unrelenting harassment by the media and the very real danger of
physical threats against them. In particular, the government has noted the following in its prior
submissions:
