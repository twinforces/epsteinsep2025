Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 236 of 239
source list will be an exact statistical mirror of the community.” United States v. Guzman, 337 F.
Supp. 140, 143 (S.D.N.Y. 1972); see also Taylor, 419 U.S. at 538. The mere fact that a jury
selection system is imperfect does not make it invalid. Swain v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202, 209
(1965) (overruled on other grounds). Accordingly, the Second Circuit has found that absolute
disparities as high as nearly 5% fail to establish a prima facie case of underrepresentation. See,
e.g., Biaggi, 909 F.2d at 677-78 (3.6% for Blacks and 4.7% for Hispanics); United States v.
Ramnath, 131 F.3d 132, 132 (2d Cir. 1997) (3.45% for African-Americans and 4.87% for
Hispanics); see also Barlow, 732 F. Supp. 2d at 34-35 (collecting out-of-circuit cases rejecting
claims presenting similar and even higher disparities).”!

Properly calculated, the “absolute disparity” in this case falls comfortably within the range
deemed acceptable by the Second Circuit and other courts. As noted, the “relevant jury pool” is
the White Plains Master Wheel, which is comprised of 11.20% Black or African-American persons
and 12.97% Latino or Hispanic persons. (Siskin Aff. at § 28). The “community population” is the
jury eligible population for the five counties from which the White Plains Master Wheel is drawn,
which was comprised of 12.45% Black or African-American persons and 14.12% Hispanic or
Latino persons in 2018. (Ud. at § 19). This yields an “absolute disparity” of 1.25% for Black or
African-American persons and 1.15% for Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at 28). That disparity
does not rise to the level of satisfying the second prong of the Duren test.
| In United States v. Jackman, the Second Circuit held that an absolute disparity of 2.5% for Black
or African-American persons and 3.4% for Hispanic or Latino persons was sufficient to satisfy the
second prong of the Duren test. 46 F.3d 1240 (2d Cir. 1995). The unique facts of Jackman make
it readily distinguishable. The jury clerk in Jackman relied on a qualified jury wheel that was
mostly drawn from a master jury wheel that completely excluded potential jurors from two cities
in the Division—cities that accounted for 62.93% of the voting-age Black population and 68.09%
of the voting-age Hispanic population in the division. See id. at 1242-44. This resulted in a venire
comprised of no Black or African-American persons and one Hispanic or Latino person. /d. at
1244. See also id. at 1252 (Walker, J., dissenting) (stating that the majority’s decision was “at
odds with every decision in every circuit applying the Duren test’).
