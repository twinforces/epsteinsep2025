Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document204 Filed 04/16/21 Page 236 of 239

source list will’be an exact statistical:mirror of the community.” United States v: Guzman, 337 F.
Supp. 140, 143 (S.D.N.Y. 1972); se@ also Taylor, 419 U:S. at 538. The mere fact. that a jury’
sclection system..is imperfect docs not make it:invalid. Swain-v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 202,.209
(1965) (overruled.on other grounds). Accordingly, the Second Circuit: has found ‘that; absolute:
disparities as high. as. nearly 5% fail té establish a prima. facic: case of underreprescntation. See,
eg., Biaggi, 909 F.2d at 677-78 (3.6% for Blacks and 4.7% for Hispanics); United States vy.
Ranindth, 13), F.3d 132, 132 (2d Cir. 1997) (3.45% for AfricansAmericans and 4.87% for
Hispanics); see also Barlow, 732 F.Supp. 2d at 34-35! (collecting out-of-circuit cases rejecting
claims presenting similar and ‘even higher disparitics).”"

Properly calculated, the “absolute disparity” in this case‘falls Comfortably within the range
‘deemed acceptable by‘the Second Circuit and other courts. As noted, the “relevant jury pool” is
the White’Plains Master Wheel, which.is comprised of 11.20% Black or African-American persons
and 12.97% Latino or Hispanié persons. (Siskin Aff. at. 28). The “community population” is the
jury cligible population for the five counties from which the White Plains'Master Whecl is drawn,
which was comprised. of 12:45% Black. or African-American persons and. 14.12% Hispante or:
Latino persons in 2018. (/d. at'4 19). This yiclds an “absolute disparity” of 1.25% for Black. or
African-American persons and. 1.15% for Latino or Hispanic persons. (Jd. at.4,.28). That disparity

does not rise to the level of satisfying the sccond-prong of the Divren test.

"| In. United States v. Jackman, the: Second Circuit held that an absolute disparity. of. 2.5% for Black:
or Aftican-American persons and 3.4% for Hispanic or Latino persons was sufficient'to satisfy the
second prong of the Duren, test..46 F.3d.1240 (2d Cir. 1995). The unique facts of Jackman make
qt readily: distinguishable. The jury clerk in.Jackman.rclied on.a qualified. jurywheel that: was
mostly drawn from a master jury wheel ‘that: completely excluded. potential jurors from:two citiés
in:the. Division—cities that accounted for 62.93%. of the voting-age Black: population and. 68.09%
of the voting-age Hispanic:population in the division. See id. at 1242-44. This resulted in a.venire
comprised, of:no Black: or African-American ‘persons and one Hispanic or Latino person. Jd. at.
1244. See also id: at 1252. (Walker, J., dissenting) (stating that the majority’s decision, was “at:
odds with every décision in. every circuit. applying the Dirén,test’’).
