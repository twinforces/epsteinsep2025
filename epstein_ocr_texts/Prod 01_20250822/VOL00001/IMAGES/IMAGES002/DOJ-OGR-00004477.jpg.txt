Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 180 of 349

In its review of the documentary record, OPR, examined. an cmail written. by Villafafia. in,
2018, more than.a, decade after'the NPA, was negotiated, in. which, she suggested that;the two-year
sentenee requirement:in the initial “term sheet”:provided.to the defense was developed by'Menchel
as a favor to defense attorricy Sanchez. OPR examined the facts surrounditig this allegation aiid
determined that there was ‘no merit to it. Specifically, in December 2018, after the Miami Herald
investigative report renewed. public. attention to the casc, ‘Willafafia recounted jin an email to a.
supervisory AUSA, a.conversation she recalled having had with Sloman, about the case.°** In.the
email, Villafafia stated that she had not‘been a participant.:in, discussions that: led. to Acosta’s
decision to offer a two- -year plea deal, but she addéd the following: “Months (or possibly years)
later, | asked former First Assistant Jeff Sloman where the two-ycar figure came from. He: said
that Lily [sic] Ann. Sanchez (attorney for ‘Epstcin) asked. Mr. Menchel. to “do her a solid” and.
convince Mr. Acosta to offer two years.”

OPR questioned, both Villafafia and Sloman about the purported, “‘do her a solid” remark.
Villafania told. OPR.that.she had ‘been. aware that .Menchel and. Sanchez were friends. During her
OPR interview, Villafafia explained:

[A] lot later, 1 asked Jeff. Tsaid,'you know; ‘Jeff, where did this two
years come from?” And.he said, “Well, I always figured that .
Lillyasked Matt to do her a solid,” which. I thought ‘was such a a
strange term, .. . “and to get hera good. deal:so that she would beiin
Epstcin’s good ; graces” ‘and. that. that’s where the two years came
from. Although, strangely cnough, then several, years. after that, Jeff
Sloman,.askéd me ‘where the two years came: from, and, 1 had, ‘to
remind him ofthat coriversation. So Jeff doesn’t know where the
two ycars:came from.

Because the email. had, been. expressed in more definitive terms, OPR asked. Villafafia.
‘whether Sloman had affirmatively: asserted that the two-year deal. was a favor from Menchel to
defense courisel, or whether he had stated that‘he merely “figured” that ‘was’the, case, but Viillafana,
could not recall preciscly what Sloman had said. Ata. follow-up interview, Villafatia again. said
that she was unable to.recall whether Sloman’s' specific statement was “Lilly asked’Matt to do her
a.solid, and he did it,” or “Ialways figured. Matt just wanted... . todo herasolid.” Villafafia:stated.
‘that she was ‘unaware of any: information. that “expressly: [indicated] ‘that: there was any’ sort of
exchange of... a favorin cither diréction.”

not. rule out the possibility that Villafaiia, for whom he: repeatedly ‘expressed great respect, “heard.
‘that in some.fashion.”” He told OPR that if he did:say something to Villafafia about Menchel having’
dorie.“a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, he could-not have meant it:sériously; and.he explained, “[I]t’s
not something that I would have believed. Him doing: ‘her. a-solid. I mean that’s the furthest thing
from my:recollcction. or:impression even. after years later.”

28:

Villafafia’s,email stemmed from a.congressional inquiry received, by the: ‘Department: concerning the Epstein
investigation, and ‘the NPA, ’to which the USAO had been asked to assist in responding, In. her email, Villafaiia.
addressed several issues that she perecived to be'the “three main questions” raised'by the press coverage.
