Dear Judge Sweet:

to ‘unscal. discovery materials ‘in. the possession of Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP

(“Guiffi e”), 15:Civ. 7433 (RWS) (the “Litigation”), a copy of which is enclosed.as Exhibit A.

Background

As described in the Application, the Government has served a grand jury subpoena
(the *Subpocna’ *) upon Boies Schiller. & Flexner (“Boies Schiller”) requiring the production of
copies of discovery and related. materials related to the Litigation. The Subpoena ‘was. validly.
issucd pursuant.to an ongoing investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and, others, for possible violations
of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 1591 and 1594(¢) (unlawfully trafficking minors) and.
Section, 2422(b) (unlawfully enticing minors) (the “Investigation”. The production of materials
pursuant to the: Subpoena. is solely for the purposes of the: ‘Investigation, and.:is subject to the
protections and restrictions of Fed. R. Crim. P. 6(c).

The Governnient has been. advised that Boies Schiller; which:is counsel for plaintiffs in.the
Litigation, docs not intend, to contest the Subpocna. However, the Government. is..advised ‘that.

although. Boies Schiller would not otherwise: contest. compliance with. the Subpoena, it believes
that a protective order entered in the Litigation (the “Protective Order”):may preclude compliance.

permitting Boies Schiller to comply’ with the validly- iSsuied ‘Subpocna.
