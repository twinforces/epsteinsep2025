depart from, the:Ashcroft ‘Memo. He told ‘OPR, however, that: he did not recall discussing the:
Asheroft:;;Memo with his colleagues and nothing i in the contemporancous, documentary: record,
suggests that: hc} made.a conscious decision to depart from.it-when he decided to resolve’ the federal
investigation through the NPA. Instead, it-appears'that'Acosta simply’ failed'to consider the tension.
‘between. federal. charging: policy and:the strong federal interest in this case, on the onc hand, and
his broad reading of the Petite ‘policy and his g gencral concerns about “federalism,” ‘on the other

hand. OPR coneludes that Acosta. viewed. the federal government’s role: in prosecuting Epstein,
‘too narrowly and through the’wrong prism.

Furthermore, Acosta’s federalism concerms: about intruding on. ‘the state’ s autonomy
to pursue a. federal, prosecution would have. By means of the NPA, the federal government
dictated to, the state the charges, the sentence, the timing, and certain conditions thatthe state had
to obtain during the state’s own prosecution. Acosta acknowledged. during his OPR interview that.
his “attempt to backstop the state here[] rebounded, because in the: process, it’... ended up. being
arguably more intrusive.” 7 . . .

Acosta’s concern. about; ‘invading the ‘state’s authority: led to additional negative
consequences. Acosta revised the-draft. NPA ‘in-séveral respects to, “soften” its tone, by substituting
provisions requiring Epstcin to make his “best efforts” for.language that appeared to dictate certain.
actions to the:state: In so doing, however, Acosta undermined the enforceability of the agreement,
making it. difficult later to-declare Epstein i in’ breach when he failed to: comply.

OPR found no indication that when. deciding to resolve the federal prosecution. through a
mechanism that relicd complctcly:on state action,, Acosta considered the numerous disadvantages
of having: Epstein, plead guiltyi in.the state court:system, a system.in which.none of the:subjccts had.
practiced.and with which, they were unfamiliar. Villafafia; ‘recogniz.cd.that there-were “a lot.of ways
to manipulate state sentences,” and. she'told OPR, that: she was concerned from the outset of.
negotiations about entcring:into'the NPA, becaise by sending the case back to, the state the USAO
was “giving'up all control over'what was going on.” Villafafia also:told OPR’that:defense. counsel
“had.a lot of. experience: with the state system. We did not.” Epstcin’s ability to ‘obtain. work.
relcasc, a provision directly: contrary to the USAQ’s intent with,respect’to Epstein’s sentence, is a.
clear example of the ‘problem ‘faced by the, prosecutors. when trying to craft a ‘plea, that depended
on a. judicial system.‘with ‘which. they. ‘were ‘unfamiliar and over which they’ had ‘no control.
Although the issue of’ gain time was. considered and addressed in. the NPA, none.of the. subject,
attorneys: negotiating the NPA. realized:until. afer the NPA was signed that Epstein might be:
eligible for. work release. Acosta, in. particular, told OPR:that‘ “if.it was typical. to provide that kind.
of work ‘release ‘in, these cases, that, would have been news to me.” Because work release was not.
anticipated, the NPA. didnot specifically address it, and'the USAO was unable to foreclose Epstein,
from applying for admission to'the program.

a9. The'Petite policy: only applies’ to the Department of Justice, and:federal prosecutions. It:docs not prevent state
authorities. from, pursuing’ state; charges after a federal prosceution. See, e.g, United States v.. Nichols and State.
Nichols (dual prosecution for-acts committed in'the ‘bombing of*the Oklahoma City-federal building). However, in
practice . and,to use; their resourecs ‘most efficiently, state; authorities often choose not to pursue state charges. if the

federal prosecution:results-in a, conviction.
