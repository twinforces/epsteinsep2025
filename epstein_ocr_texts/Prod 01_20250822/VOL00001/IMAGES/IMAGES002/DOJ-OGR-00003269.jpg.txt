having directly ‘with Alex Acosta, and.Alcx Acosta agreed to 18
months.

Villafana further explained to OPR?

Regarding going from:24 months to 20 months, | recall a-discussion
that:24 months of federal: time was really 20. months after gain, time,
s0 Epstein should. be allowed to plead. to 20 months’ in the state.
Epstcin’ $ counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like
that: in the [s]tate, and somconc above:me:agreed. Later, of course,
as shown. in the agreements, Epstcin’s counsel (Jay Lefkowitz) got
Alex to agree that Epstein should, be allowed 'to carn gain time in the
[s]tate, so'the 20 months in the state became’ at least ‘17 months.

Regarding. going from.20 months’ to 18:months, . . . this came.from
a negotiation between Epstcin’s ‘counsel, and Andy or Alex, where
the federal statutory max:could only be 24 or 18,.so 18 was. agreed
to. I also recall that, after Epstcin’s, counsel. decided that they
wanted to-proceed with.an NPA anid-only a state guilty plea, | asked
Alex why-we didn’t return to 20 months because the reason why’we
went.to 18 months'was' because that:was the orily-way:to.end up with
a federal, statutory: maximum,,'"”

However, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations, with Epstein’s.attorneys,
drafted by Villafaita for Acosta several weeks after the September 12, 2007 meeting » with-the. State

in the amount of jail time - - “fiom, the originally proposed] twenty- four months down to cightecn,
months, which would be:served at the Palm Beach ‘County Jail rather than'a, state:prison facility.”
Acosta also noted to OPR’that: Villafatia was engaged. in a “tough negotiation,” and he was willing
to allow: her the discretion to: reduce the amount of. incarecration. time:'without him. “second-
guessing” her. Acosta acknowledged that-he “clearly approved it at some point.”

Based on this :‘record, OPR. could not definitively determine when, how; or by’ whom the
decision was made to reduce: the required term of imprisonment ‘from 24. months to 18 months. It
is possible:that the:reduction.was connected to Epstcin’s effort to.achieve a result.that would allow
him:to serve his time: in a.county facility, but it may: also have: resulted from the partics’ attempts
to reach agreement.on, federal charges that ‘would not:result.in a sentence of incarceration g _greaten
than, what. had been discussed with respect to state charges. In the end, the evidence: shows that.
Acosta approved of a reduced term of incarceration from 24 months to,'18 months, and the USAO
understood. at the time that the state gain time:tequirement would further reduce the actual amount’
of time: Epstein would spend incarecrated.

110 By “federal.statutory maximum.” Villafafia:referred to ‘1 2-month.and.6-month misdemeanors:
