' The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns to the NPA.
“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender
Registration Requirement

After having spent days negotiating the federal charges to be included ina:plea agreement,
by the.afternoon of September 20, 2007, the defense rejected the:federal plea-option, and the:partics
resumed negotiations over the details of an.NPA, calling for Epstcin to plead:to only:state charges.
Through multiple emails and. attempts (some successful) to, speak directly with Acosta and. other:
supervisors, defense attorneys Vigorously fought the USAO’s.:insistence that Epstein plead. to a.
state charge requiring sexual. offender registration.

After reeciving the federal, plea, agreement, Lefkowitz ‘spoke with Villafafia. She reported,
to Acosta and Louric: that Lefkowitz told her the defense was “back: to: doing the. state-charges=
only agrcement” and. wanted. until the middle of the following. Weck té Work out the details, but’
that :shc-had told. defense counscl that “we needa. signed. agreement by tomorrow: [Friday] or-we
arc [filing charges] on Tucsday.” | .

Lefkowitz emailed ‘Villafafia about the draft. NPA that:she had sent to him, pointing out.
that it called for a.20-month jail. sentence followed by 10. months.of community control, rather than.
18 months:in jail.and 12:under community control, and:to ask :if the USAO had. “any: flexibility”
‘on the § 2255 procedure. ‘Villafafia:responded: ;

The 18 and 12 has, already. becn agreed. to by our office, :so that. is
not a problem. On the issue about 18 [U.S.C. §] 2255, we seem 'to
be miles apart. Your most recent version not only had me binding
the girls to a trust fund. administered by the state court, but: also
promising that.they will give up their [§] 2255 rights.

on.some of your + other changes. In: the context ofa non- prosecution
agreement, the office: may be more willing to be specific: about :not
pursuing charges against. others. ‘However, as. 1 stated on Sunday,
the Office cannot; and will:not bind Immigration.

Also, your timetable will need ‘to: move'up significantly. As [State
Attorney] Barry [Krischer] said.in our mecting last week, his office
can’put togcther,.a plea agreement, [and an] information, and ‘get you
all-before the [state] judge on.a change of plea within, a day.

Villafafia. alerted. Krischer that. evening that. negotiations were “not going very: well” and
that defense: counsel “changed. thcir:minds again, and.they only: want to'plead.to state charges, not
concurrent. state ‘and, federal.” She added, “If we cannot reach .,. ..an agreement, then Ineed. to
[charge] ‘the case on, Tucsday [September, 25] and.1 will:not budge from, ‘that date.”

In response to Villafafia’s report of her conversation. with Lefkowitz about the defense

preference for a “state- charges- only agreement,” Louric alerted. her that, “He wants to get: out of
[scxual, offender] registration which'we should. not agree to.” Louric emailed Acosta:
