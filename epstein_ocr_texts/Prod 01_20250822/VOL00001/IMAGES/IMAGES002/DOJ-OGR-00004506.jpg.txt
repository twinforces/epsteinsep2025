D. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties Enforcing the NPA.

After the agreement was reached, the ‘collateral. attacks and. continued appeals raised the
‘specter that-the: defense had negotiated. in bad. faith. At;various points, individual members of the
USAO tcam became frustrated by defense tactics, and in some instances, consideration was given
to whether the USAO should declare a unilateral breach. Indced, on, November 24, 2008, the
USAO gave. notice that it deemed. Epstcin’s participation in‘work release to be:a breach of. the
agreement but ‘ultimately: took no further action. Acosta told OPR: “Ii was personally very:
frustrated. with the failure to‘report.on October 20, and had.I cnvisioncd that, entire collateral attack,
[think I would have looked at this, very differently:”

Once: the: NPA. was Signed. Acosta could. have: tgnored Epstein’ Ss! requests for further r review!
suilty plea, ‘declared Epstein to ‘be i in “breach ‘and proceeded to ‘charge him. federally, When
questioned. about: this issue, Acosta. cxplained that he believed. the Department had the “right” to
address Epstcin’s concerns. He told OPR. that because the USAO is part of the Department of
Justice, if'a defendant asks for Departmental review, it would. be “unseemly” to object. During: his
OPR interview, Sloman described.Acosta as'very process-oriented, which he attributed to Acosta’s
prior Department experience. Sloman, however, belicved the USAO. gave Epstein “[t]oo much
process,” a result: of the USAO’s desire, to ““do the right-thing” and to'the defense team’s ability to
keep pressing for moré process. without, triggering a breach. of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s
defénse. counsel repeatedly’ and carefully made clear they were not repudiating, the agreement.
Acosta told 'OPR that the USAO-would have had to declare: Epstein in breach:of the NPA in order
to‘proceed to file federal, charges, and Epstein would undoubtedly have litigated whether his cffort
to-obtain. Departmental review constituted a breach. Acosta-recalled.that he was coneerned, as was
Sloman, that. a, unilateral decision to rescind, the non-prosccution. agreement. would result. ‘in.
collateral litigation that would. further delay matters and make what'was likely'a.difficult trial even
harder.

Acosta’s.and Sloman’s concerns about declaring a breach were not-unreasonable. A court.
‘would, have been unlikely to, have determined that defense counscel’s appeal. of the NPA to the
Department and, unwillingness to, set a;state plea date while that appeal was ongoing was sufficient.
to: negate the agreement. However, some of the difficulty the USAO faced ‘in declaring a breach.
was caused by decisions Acosta made before:and shortly after the NPA was signed. Forcxample,
and significantly, it'was Acosta,who changed the language, “Epstein:shall enter his guilty. plea and.
be sentenced not later than. October 26, 2007” 'to “Epstein, shall use [his] best efforts ‘to enter his
guilty plea and be sentenced not later thar’ October 26, 2007.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta. also
agreed not'to enforee the NPA’s. October 26, 2007 deadline for entry ofEpstcin’s plea,.and he told
defense counsel that he had no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.
Epstein.s was “not using ‘his “best efforts” to comply with: the NPA and \ was « intentionally failing to
comply; as opposed to pursuing'a. course to‘which the U.S. Attorney had at least implicitly agreed.

E. _ Acosta Did.Not, Exercise Sufficient Supervisory Review over the Process

The question at. the center of much of. the public controversy concerning the USAO’s
handling‘of its criminal investigation,of Epstein is why'the USAO agreed .to resolve a case in-which,
