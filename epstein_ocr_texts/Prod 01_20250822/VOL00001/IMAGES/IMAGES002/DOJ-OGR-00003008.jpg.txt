2018 respectively, would have testified, and that such testimony would have been exculpatory and
would have materially helped the defense. (Def. Mot. 7 at 9-11). The defendant cannot establish
that Casey and Detective Recarey would have testified in a way that would help, rather than hurt,
the defendant.

In particular, the defendant contends that Michael Casey, the purported agent of Minor
Victim-1, “would be able to testify” about Minor Victim-1’s behavior during the “relevant time
period” and the “lack of any ‘outcry’ or ‘grooming.’” (/d. at 10). The defense suggests that Casey
not having related any complaints about Maxwell to “any authority, Ms. Maxwell, or any other
known witness” means that he knew of no complaints. (/d. at 9-10). As an initial matter, “there
is no evidence before the Court as to what [Casey] would have testified.” Scala, 388 F. Supp. 2d

testimony (which would be purely speculative and unsubstantiated) would also have no bearing
on whether the abuse, in fact, occurred.

The defendant argues that Detective Recarey would have testified that none of the
witnesses with whom he spoke in connection with a prior investigation told him about the
defendant participating in sex trafficking activities. (Def. Mot. 7 at 10-11). Asa threshold matter,
the defendant has not established how such testimony, which would consist entirely of hearsay,
could even be admissible at the defendant’s trial. Moreover, the fact that Epstein may have abused
victims without the defendant’s participation is not exculpatory as to charges alleging the
defendant assisted in the grooming and abuse of other victims. The well-established law of this
Circuit generally precludes a defendant from offering evidence that a defendant did not participate
in criminal conduct on a particular occasion—or of her law-abiding conduct during uncharged
periods or uncharged events—to rebut the Government’s evidence with respect to the charged
