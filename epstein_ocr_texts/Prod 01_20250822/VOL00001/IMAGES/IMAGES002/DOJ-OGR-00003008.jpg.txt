2018 respectively, would.have testified, and that such testimony’ would, have been exculpatory and.
would. have materially helped the defense. (Def. Mot. 7 at 9-11). The défendant cannot establish
that Casey and. Detective Recarey would. have testified. in away that:would help, rather than hurt,
the defendant:

In particular, the defendant contends. that Michacl Casey, the purported agent of Minor
Victim-], “would ’be able to testify” about. Minor Victim-].’s behavior during the “relevant. time:

victims without: the defendant’s participation :is not. exculpatory as to charges alleging the
defendant. assisted, in, the grooming ‘and. abuse, of efher victims. The well-established, law of this
