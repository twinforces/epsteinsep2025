Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 310-1 Filed 07/02/21 Page 31 of 80

On May 24, 2016, following a preliminary hearing, all of Cosby’s charges were held
for trial. Thereafter, Cosby filed a number of pretrial motions, including a petition for a
writ of habeas corpus, a motion to dismiss the charges on due process grounds, and,
most pertinent here, a “Motion to Suppress the Contents of his Deposition Testimony and
Any Evidence Derived therefrom on the Basis that the District Attorney’s Promise not to
Prosecute Him Induced Him to Waive his Fifth Amendment Right Against Self-
Incrimination.” After holding a hearing on the suppression motion, at which no new
testimony was taken, the trial court again concluded that former District Attorney Castor’s
testimony was equivocal, credited the testimony of Constand’s attorneys, and found that
no promise or agreement not to prosecute existed. Having so determined, the court
discerned “no [c]onstitutional barrier to the use of [Cosby’s] civil deposition testimony”
against him at trial, and it denied the suppression motion.'> Later, the Commonwealth
would introduce portions of Cosby’s deposition testimony against Cosby, including his
admissions to using Quaaludes during sexual encounters with women in the past.

On September 6, 2016, the Commonwealth filed a “Motion to Introduce Evidence
of Other Bad Acts of the Defendant,” which Cosby opposed by written response. The
Commonwealth sought to introduce evidence and testimony from other women who
alleged that Cosby had sexually assaulted them, instances that could not be prosecuted
due to the lapse of applicable statutes of limitations. On February 24, 2017, the trial court
granted the Commonwealth’s motion, but permitted only one of these alleged past victims
to testify at Cosby’s trial.

On December 30, 2016, Cosby filed a motion seeking a change in venue or venire.
The trial court kept the case in Montgomery County, but agreed that the jury should be
18 T.C.O. at 72 (quoting Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order Sur
Defendant’s Motion to Suppress Evidence Pursuant to Pa.R.Crim.P. 581(l), 12/5/2016,
at 5).
