There is no doubt that promises made during plea negotiations or as part of fully
consummated plea agreements differ in kind from the unilateral discretion exercised when
a prosecutor declines to pursue criminal charges against a defendant. As suggested by
the trial court in the present case, such an exercise of discretion is not per se enforceable
in the same way that a bargained-for exchange is under contract law. The: prosecutor
enjoys: “tremendous” discretion to wield “the power to decide whether to initiate. formal

criminal charges lies in the district attorney”).

Commonwealth v. Sims, 919 A.2d 931,941 n.6 (Pa.:2007). (noting that federal and state
due process principles generally are understood as operating co-extensively). We have
explained that review of ‘a due process’ claim “entails an assessment as. to whether the

challenged proceeding or conduct offends some principle of justice so rooted in the
