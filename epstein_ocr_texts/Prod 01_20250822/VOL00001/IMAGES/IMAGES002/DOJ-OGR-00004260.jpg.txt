(2 year conspiracy charged the following year); Jones (1 year conspiracy charged the same
year); Lebedev (2 year conspiracy charged in the second year); Corley (2 year conspiracy
charged in January of the following year). None involved, as this one does, allegations of a
10-year conspiracy charged 25 years later. None involved accusers who were located in at

it produces its exhibit list, one week after the in limine filing deadline. Neither government
proposal will allow Ms. Maxwell to raise appropriate objections to the materials sufficiently
in advance of trial, nor promote briefing during the in imine motions. Indeed, the government
fails to explain how Ms. Maxwell can object in limine to exhibits containing purported co-
