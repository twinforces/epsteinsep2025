Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s Order dated
May 10, 2021, which directed the Government to propose and justify any requests for redaction of
the defendant’s memorandum in support of her supplemental pre-trial motions and exhibits. (Dkt.
No. 274).

After reviewing the defense’s memorandum, the Government seeks a limited number of
redactions. These proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the
Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although
the defense’s memorandum in support of her supplemental pre-trial motions is a judicial document
subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored
to protect the privacy interests of victims and third parties referenced in the document. These
redactions are thus consistent with similar, tailored redactions permitted by the Court in this case
to protect the privacy interests of third parties. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 168, 232). Today the
Government is submitting to the Court by email its proposed redactions to the defense’s
memorandum, which the Government respectfully requests be filed under seal.
