‘Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE, Document 285-2 Filed 05/20/21. Page 6 of 7

© AK did not express any conecrns about anything to the attorneys. AK may have ‘asked
something like whether the attorneys are:asking SDNY to:re-do the Florida investigation
becalise. AK. was trying to'understand what the attorneys were. proposing? Was it looking
at: the} same conduct: that’was, investigated 1 in Florida and ‘mishandled, or was it looking at
different. conduct and. possibly ongoing conduct? AK. recalls asking questions to: clarify
that point.

e AK jis'sure one of the things she asked would have been. venue ‘oriented to understand
what the attorneys were: describing and what'the conduct was... AK would not have
‘responded to a quéstion asking about’ why AK. wouldn’t just open an-invéstigation.
‘Purpose of the mecting was for AK:to understand what the attorneys were trying to
convey, not for AK. to make any representation, about her thoughts or'what she was going
to do.

© ‘Brad Edwards’s book suggcsting:that:‘the AUSA iscemed. “‘confident:that.a case would be
brought” does not scem accurate:to AK. AK.did not intend:to give-such-an impression
during the mectitig. That:decision is not. one for AK to maké alone, in any event.

© AK docs not recall any mention that the number of victims in NY far exceeded the.
‘number in Florida.

e Brad Edwards’s description. of wanting a:case: against Epstcin is consistent with AK’s
recollection that the focus was on Epstein.

6 If anyone called AK, she docs not réniember that, and she would not' have mentioned the
comity’shown ‘to other USAOs around the country.

6 .AK does not recall anyone. cver approaching her to ask:if SDNY would consider charging
Maxwell with perjury: : :

© AK has a vague memory that the attorneys called or emailed AK. at some’ point
and. told her that ‘there: had been depositions, presumably by ec contact: t-from | one: cof
‘way. or the other if any” of the aiforneys teferenced the possibility: of perjury.

© AK recalls thinking that ‘a-perjury investigation would have the same challenges.
AK. recalls thinking in. her mind. that if the depositions were: about the underlying
conduct'thatihad all of the issues that.gave, AK. pause after the mecting (length of
‘time that. had ‘passed, sense there must have becn a reason SDFL. resolved the case
the way they did) were not alleviated by a, Perjury: -based. prosecution. |
and docs not: remember: anyone J sending her a deposition transcript.

© AK doés notzremember who had been deposed. or who might have becn’the
‘subject: ofa; ‘possible’ perjury ‘Investigation.

© No investigation into‘perjury was ever opened.

© AK took no further action re Epstein after calling Scan Watson.

o Though there may ‘be emails or calls AK.cannot remember, she knows that. she
took no. action. afterthe call to. Scan. Watson. Part of the reason AK: felt horrible
when-reading the Miami Herald article: was because AK took: no action.after:
calling Scan, Watson.
