Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 67 of 349

Menchel could not recall who initially suggested a state: plea, but: noted. to OPR. that his
own,“‘emails ..; make clear that this course of action,was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He
referenced, atniong others, his May' 14, 2007 cmail to Villafafia informing her that Acosta, was
deciding how he wanted 'to.handlethe case. Menchel surmised that a state-resolution accomplished.
two. things: that. Acosta viewed _as important: first, it resolved any Petite policy concerns, and
second, it.afforded more flexibility: in sentencing | » than a federal: ‘plea. would have allowed. Menchel
told OPR. that the state ‘plea. proposal, did ‘not reflect any minimization of Epstcin’s conduct. and.
‘that any state plea. would have been. to an offense that. required, sexual offender registration. He
told:OPR, “I don’t think atiybody sat around and.said, you know, it’s not that big.a deal. That was
not:the reaction that I think anybody-had from-the:federal side. of this.case.” Rather, Menchcl said,
“The concern:was if we charge him. [as proposed], there’s going to be a trial.”

25 July 2007: Villafafiia and Menchel Disagree about ‘the Proposed State
-Résolution

Villafafia-told OPR,that she was angry” when;she received Menchel’s July: email explaining
that he had ‘proposed, to Sanchez. resolving the federal, investigation through ‘a. state plea. In
Villafafia’s view, the proposed, state ‘resolution “didn’t make any sense” and.“‘did. not correspond”
to Department policy requiring that a plea offer reflect “the most serious :readily provable
offense.*** In.her view,:a. plea to a state:charge“obviously” would:not satisfy:this:policy.. Villafana.
also told OPR that in her view, the USAM. required the USAO- to confer with the | investigative
plea, “Villafaiia. also eclicved the CVRA required attorneys for the government. to confer, with,
victims béforé making a plea offer; but the wictims had. not. been consulted about this proposal.
Villafana told OPR. she had met’with some of. the victins during thé course of the investigation.
who had negative:impressions of the State Attorney’s Office, and:she belicved that.“sending them.
back,to the State Attorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support.

(knownas the* Acheron Memo™ y. which arow ded, in: npertinent part:

[I]n all federal, criminal cases, federal, prosecutors: must: charge and pursue; the,
most serioussreadily-provable , offense or offenses that-are supported! by the facts
of:the cases except: sas authorized: by an, Assistant; Attorney General, United States
Attorney: or designated supervisory attorney. in, the limited circumstances
described below. The:most serious offense or, offenses:are those that.generate the
most substantial sentence under the Sentencing Guidclines, unless a mandatory
minimum, sentence or count requiring. a; consecuti sentence would, generate; a
longer sentence. A, charge is not “readily provable” ifthe: prosecutor, has.a good
faith doubt, for, legal or- evidentiary. reasons, as.to the Government’s ability readily
to. prove a; charge at: trial, “Thus, charges should, not be filed simply to exert
leverage; ta induce a: ‘plea. ‘Once filed, the most, serious readily prov able charges
may not be dismissed, except to ‘the extent; permitted [elsewhere sin this
