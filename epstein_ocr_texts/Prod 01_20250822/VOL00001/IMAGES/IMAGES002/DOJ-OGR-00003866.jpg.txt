Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 221 Filed 04/20/21 Page2of5

After the parties submitted these letters, the Court issued its Opinion & Order denying
Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the S1 indictment on multiple grounds. Dkt. No. 207. The Court
also granted severance as to the perjury counts. Both the denial of the motions to dismiss and the
severance of the perjury counts are relevant to the requests for a bail hearing and for an
adjournment of the trial date. The Court addresses both in this Order.

First, the request for a renewed bail hearing is denied. The Court held an original bail
hearing on July 14, 2020. After extensive argument and presentation of information, the Court
found that no conditions or combination of conditions could reasonably assure the Defendant’s
appearance as required, determining as a result that Maxwell was a flight risk and that detention
without bail was warranted under 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(1). Dkt. No. 23. The Court based its
conclusion on the presumption in favor of detention, 18 U.S.C. § 3142(e)(3), and its weighing of
the 18 U.S.C. § 3142(g) factors, including the nature and circumstances of the offense charged,
the weight of the evidence, and Maxwell’s history and characteristics. Since that time, Maxwell
has twice sought reconsideration of the Court’s original bail determination and offered different
bail packages and proposed conditions of release. The Court carefully considered those requests
and denied them in written Orders, concluding that none of the new information had any material
bearing on the Court’s original conclusion and that the Government again met its burden of
establishing that Maxwell poses a substantial risk of flight and that no conditions or combination
of conditions could reasonably assure her appearance as required. Dkt. Nos. 106, 169.

Maxwell now seeks a new bail hearing at which “witnesses [would] testify regarding the
purported strength of the government’s case.” Dkt. No. 192 at 3. The request is denied. The S2
Indictment raises no issues that warrant reconsideration of the Court’s prior bail determinations.
On the contrary, the new charges contained in the S2 indictment as well as the Court’s resolution
