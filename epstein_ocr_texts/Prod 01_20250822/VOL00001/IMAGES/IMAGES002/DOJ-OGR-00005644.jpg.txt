E. Opinion 5: Nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and secrecy are
common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety of reasons, and that
memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted. by a
number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the trauma

Theré are séveral problems ‘with Rocchio’s proposed. testimony that “nondisclosure,
incremental ‘disclosure, and secrecy are: common among victims of sexual abuse for a varicty of.
reasons, and, that:memory and. disclosure of traumatic or abusive events is impacted, by ‘a, number
of factors, iriéluding the cireumstanices surtounding the trauma.”

The first half of this opinion—regarding nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, or late
disclosure=is ‘unreliable because the alleged connection “between child:sexual abuse: and_a.
failure to report... .:is not a testable: hypothesis.” Schneider, 20.10 WL,3734055, at *4. Rocchio

opinion based. entirely on her'treatment of a self-selected. group of individuals she assumes are
telling. the truth. Schneider, 20.10 WL 3734055, at *4 (“Indeed, Edelman testifies that when her
clinical patients tell. her they‘have been 'subjected,to sexual abuse, she uncquivocally’ believes.
them.”). “There is. also:no known or identified rate of error to [Roechio’s] conclusion, nor is

And because Rocchio’s:. experience is apparently “limited to-providing therapy for those :child
victims who have reported their abuse,” Rocchio is in no position. “reliably opine as to the’
characteristics or psychology of victims who maintain their silence.” Sée' id. Rocchio’s
testimony, therefore, “cannot be challenged or tested in any meaningful. way.” /d. Her opinions
are unreliable and, inadmissible:

Rocehio’s testimony also “will [not] help. the trier of fact'to understand the evidence or to

determine’ a fact in issue.” Fed. R. Evid. 702(a). Rocchio’s opinions on, disclosure are so generic
