obligated to.amend her prior Ietter to. victims to correct the reference to the December letter

Accordingly, the September letter contained no information about ‘the: partics’ intent; |
implementing’ 18 U.S.C. § 2255, but ‘merely’ referred to ‘the NPA language concerning Epstcin’s 'S
waiver of his ‘right to ‘contest liability under ‘the. provision. In addition, the September letter
described. the: appointment of'a special. master, the special.master’s selection of an. attorney: to
represent'the victims in their 18°U:S.C. § 2255 litigation, against Epstein, and Epstcin’s agreement
to’pay the attorney. representative’s fecs arising out, of such litigation. The letter also clarified that.
Epstcin’s agrecment:to, pay foriattorncys’ fees did not.cxtend to contested litigation against him.

The g government. also intended for the Iter to ony with the court's order concerning

victims that they: could r receive a, ‘copy of the NPA:

In, addition, a judge has ordered that the United, States make
available to any designated victim. (and/or her attorney) a. copy of

would like to review the Agreement, please Ict me kriow, and I will
forward a:copy. of the Protective Order for her signature.

language regarding ‘the August 21, 2008.court order in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued.
that there'was “no court ofder requiring.the government'to provide: the-alleged ‘victims’ with riotice
that the [NPA] is.available'to them: upon.request and:doing so is.in conflict with the confidentiality
provisions of the [NPA].” In.response, and in consultation with USAO management, ‘Villafaiia.
revised the paragraph, as ‘follows:

In. addition, there has been litigation between. the United. States and
two other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement
between the United States and. Mr. Epstcin. [The attorney. sclected
by. the special:master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or.
if ‘you seléct. another attorney to represent: ‘you, that attorney can
review the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].

On September 18, 2009, a ‘state court ‘judge unsealed. the copy of the NPA. that had. been.
filed in'the state case:?””
