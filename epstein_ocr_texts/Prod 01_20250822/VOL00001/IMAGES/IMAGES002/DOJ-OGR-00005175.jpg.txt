further discuss the claim. These meetings are completely optional and voluntary. Requests to meet
with the Administrator should be sent by email to ClaimantServices@EpsteinVCP.com and will be
scheduled at a mutually convenient time and location. The Administrator may also request a meeting
with a Claimant or her Legal Representative at a reasonable mutually convenient time and location,
though the Claimant is not obligated to attend any such meeting.
3. Release
By submitting a claim to the Program, a Claimant is seeking to resolve all claims relating to allegations
of sexual abuse against Epstein and/or the Estate, and related entities and individuals as set forth in the
Release. If a Claimant chooses to accept the offer of compensation pursuant to the Program, the
Claimant will be required to sign and execute a full Release, in a form satisfactory to the Estate, of all
past and future claims (including lis pendens, writs of attachment, etc.) relating to such allegations of
sexual abuse against the Estate, related entities and/or related individuals. A Claimant may reject the
offer of compensation and may stop participating in the Program and withdraw the claim at any time
prior to the execution of the Release.
The Release will waive any rights the Claimant and her heirs, descendants, legatees or beneficiaries
may have to assert any claims relating to allegations of sexual abuse against the Estate, related
entities and/or related individuals, to file an individual legal action relating to such allegations, or to
participate in any civil legal action associated with such allegations, except as a witness. However,
the Release will not operate to preclude or limit the Claimant’s ability to report and discuss
allegations of sexual abuse with law enforcement officials or anyone else. In other words, the
Release will not impose any rules of confidentiality on claimants, who are expressly permitted to
discuss their allegations without restriction, should they choose.
Before signing a Release, the Claimant must consult with an attorney selected by the Claimant. Ifthe
Claimant is not represented by an attorney, the Program will provide an attorney to provide free legal
counseling to the Claimant for the sole purpose of advising the Claimant concerning the language and
binding nature of the Release.
No one affiliated with the Program will provide tax or legal advice to those receiving payments under
the Program. Claimants are urged to consult with a tax advisor concerning any questions regarding
tax liability for payments pursuant to the Program.
4. Payments
Upon the Claimant’s acceptance of the Administrator’s determination, the Administrator’s receipt of
the Claimant’s executed Release and, where applicable, dismissal with prejudice of any existing
lawsuit, legal actions or claims against the Estate or related entities and/or related individuals, the
Administrator will initiate payment by check or electronic funds transfer to each eligible Claimant as
directed by the Claimant. Checks will be sent to Claimants via overnight courier service. All
