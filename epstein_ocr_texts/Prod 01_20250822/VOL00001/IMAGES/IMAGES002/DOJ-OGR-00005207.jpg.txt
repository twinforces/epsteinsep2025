Defendant: Ghislaine Maxwell submits this‘: memorandum of law:in, support of her:motion,
for individual sequestered voir dire of prospective jurors and limited attorney-conducted:voir

The Court has already determined:that'a juror questiorinaire is, appropriate in this, case.

types of unfairly prejudicial media attention: (i). the pretrial publicity that.this case has ‘received
and will continue to reccive throughout the duration ofthe trial and (ii) the extensive:prior
