4. ‘Late July 2006: The State Indicts Epstein, and, the USAO Moves
Forward. with a Federal Investigation

Several days. after Villafania spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July 19, 2006, Assistant
State Attorney Belohlavek presented the case: to the state grand jury. *3 Krischer told OPR that
“the whole'thing” was put beforethe g grand jury, According'to:a statement made at the time’by the
State Attorney’s Office spokesman, the:grand jury was presented with.a.list of charges from highest.
‘to lowest, without.a. recommendation by’the’ prosecutor, and deliberated. with the-prosecutor out of
the room.2? The state. grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstcin with one count'of felony’
solicitation. of prostitution, in.violation of Florida Statute § 796.07, a felony understate law-because
it alleged three or: more instances of solicitation. °5 The.indictment did not: identify the person, or
persons solicited-and made no:mention of the fact that Epstein had:solicited minors.°° OnJuly 23,
2006, Epstcin self-surrendcred. to be arrested on the indictment, but ‘was, not detained, and, the
charges weére:made:public.

Villafafia told OPR, that she:decided:to move forward with,the federal, investigation, at‘that
point, because she believed. the State Attorncy’s Office would ‘permit. Epstein to enter a. plea to a.
reduced :misdemeanor:charge and that once he entered.a guilty*plea, the Department’s Pctite:policy
might preclude a federal prosecution.”’ Villafafia told 'OPR that at, the time, she “definitely
belicved that we were ‘going to proceed ‘to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ... we had
sufficient. evidence.” . - .

af Villafana‘and.the.EBI obtained and-exaniined records of'the state grand:jury proceeding, and.Louric reviewed
them. ‘Because the grand jury records:have'not been ordered released:publicly, OPR does:not:discuss their. substance
‘in. this-Report.

26 In pertinent part; the state indictment read, “[B]etween the I st: day’ ‘of August [2004] and October’311, 2005,
[Epstein] did solicit; induces entice, or procure another to. commit prostitution lewdness, or‘assignation; ......on three
or more occasions.” The 1'S-month time; frame and lack of detail regarding'the place; or-manner“of the offense: made
‘its impossible’ to identify from:the charging document:which-victim or:victims:seryed_as the basis forthe charge in-the
state indictment, Belohlavek.explained to:OPR thatthe charge did-notilist specific victims so that she could: go forward.

37 The:Pctite policy is.a set‘of guidclines.used by federal. prosecutors when-considering whether to pursue federal
charges;for,defendants previously prosecuted for'state or local.offenses. The Constitution.does not prohibitithe federal
‘government from prosecuting defendants who"have. been-charged, acquitted, or;convicted on state charges based. on
the same criminal:conduct. ‘The Supreme. Court’has repeatedly-upheld the long-standing principle thatthe prohibition
against double jcopardy docs.not:apply'to, prosecutions’ brought by: different sovereigns. See, e:g., Gamble v. United
States; 587 US. ; 139 S.Ct. 1960, 1966-67 (2019) (and cases cited therein); Abbate y. United States, 359° US.

187,195 (1959) (and, cases’ cited therein); and United States v: Lanza, 260U. S. 377. 382 (1922). Noncetheless;. to
better: promote the, efficient: use of; criminal justice resources; the Department dev “eloped policies in, 1959 and 1960 to
guide federal prosecutors in, the use of their ‘charging discretion. See ‘Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IEA.2, for a.
more detailed discussion of the Petite;policy.
