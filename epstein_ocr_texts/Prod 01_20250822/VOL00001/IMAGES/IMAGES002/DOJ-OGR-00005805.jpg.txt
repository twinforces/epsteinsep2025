That is precisely how Rule 702.works in cases where experts testify about general principles, which,
the Rule contemplates. Seé Fed. R. Evid. '702 Advisory Committee note (“[I]t might, also be
important :in some cases for.an. expert to ‘educate the factfinder about gencral principles, without
ever attempting to ‘apply these principles. to the specific facts of the case.”). Dr. Rocchio will
provide reliable opinions about.principles of coercion and.attachment.in.abusive relationships:that
will help the jury understand the psychological factors ‘underlying the relationships: that the: jury’
will learn, about at trial.

Finally,.the.defendant:argues that the Court should preclude Dr. Rocchio’s testimony under
Rule 403. In, so arguing, she expresses concern that Dr. Rocchio’s testimony will “‘radically
simplify’ an otherwise complex case” by ‘‘foist[ing] a damning telcology on a scrics of actions
cach of which might have been motivated. by a varicty of ends or no ends.at all.’” (Def. Mot. at
11 (quoting United States 'v. Burns, No. 07 Cr. 556, 2009 WL 3617448, at *5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27,
2009)).* There is nothing:prejudicial or simple about Dr. Rocchio’s testimony. The jury’ will not
conclude that the defendant is guilty because Dr. Roechio explains that. acts ‘which “might have

been:motivated bya variety of ends” are ‘sometimes ‘part: of the process of sexual abuse. Whether:

expert testimony to educate the factfinder on, general principles.” Raymond, 700 F. Supp..2d at.
150 n.12 (quoting: Fed. R. Evid. 702 Advisory Committee ‘note). The defendant cites,:no place
containing this limitation.in'the text of the Rule, its advisory committee notes, Daher, or the law’
of this Circuit‘or District. Nor.docs it make:sense on its ownterms:“how:financial.markets respond
to corporate reports” or the “principles of:thermodynamics” are:sometimes highly predictable, but
not always, depending on the context.

> Burns;.a case about-a district:court’s application af sentencing ofa Guidelines enhancement, says
nothing about whether the jury would be confused. by lcarnifig about grooming.
