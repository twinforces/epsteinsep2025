specified in the NPA, Epstein had to fulfill a series of terms and conditions. These included: (1)
pleading guilty in Florida state court to one count of solicitation of prostitution and one count of
solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, (2) registering as a federal sex offender, (3)
paying for an attorney to represent his victims to sue him for personal injuries, and (4) waiving
his right to contest any damages awarded in those lawsuits up to an agreed-upon amount. (Ex. B

and paid over $12.5 million in settlements to multiple alleged victims. (Ex. H). Indeed, Epstein
paid i to the person we believe to be Accuser-4 and her attorneys. (/d.; Ex. I).

The USAO-SDNY cannot now seek additional punishment for the same offenses that
were resolved by the NPA. Courts employ different tests to determine whether two offenses are

(1) the criminal offenses charged in successive indictments;

(2) the overlap of participants;

(3) the overlap of time;

(4) similarity of operation;

(5) the existence of common overt acts;

(6) the geographic scope of the alleged conspiracies or location where

overt acts occurred;

(7) common objectives; and

(8) the degree of interdependence between alleged distinct conspiracies.

curiam)). “[I]f.a defendant makes a non-frivolous showing that two indictments in fact charge
only one conspiracy, the burden shifts to the prosecution to show, by a preponderance of the
