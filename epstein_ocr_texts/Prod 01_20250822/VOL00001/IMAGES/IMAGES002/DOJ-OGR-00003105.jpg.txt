therein. See Broccolo, 797 F. Supp. at. 1190-91 (joining counts involving use: of businesses to
commit fraud with.a count of falscly swearing in bankruptcy court, that the defendant, “had. not:
engaged. in any business activity during the: preceding six ycars”)."* Accordingly, and. consistent.
with the holdings in,Ruiz'and Broceolo, this Court 'should deny the severance: motion.

The defendant argues that the offenses are not connected. because they involve different’
time periods. To’be sure, Counts One through Four charge conduct:involving certain victims from.
1994 to 1997, while the perjury counts charge statements made ‘in 201.6 in a case conceming
Giuffre’s abuse: from..1999 to 2002. However, the specific statements charged in Count Five and
Count Six directly relate to the conduct, charged. in, Counts One: through ‘Four, including, in, one
instance, a. specific: victim identified as rélevant'to those counts. Arid ‘those statements were: not:
time-bound:or restricted.to Giuffre. For instanec,’the defendant: denicd.the existence of anyscheme
to recruit underage girls for sexual massages, not'the existence of such a.scheme between 1999
and ‘2002, or a scheme specifically focused. on Giuffre. The defendant also. denied. ever giving
anyone a massage, specifically including Epstein and-Minor’Victim-2. She did not.limit/her denial
‘to Giuffre or to a'particular time period. There is, accordingly; a. strong connection between the
truth-or falsity: ofthe defendant’s broad denials and her acts:in the period at issue in the substantive
counts. The cases on which the defendant, relies are factually inapposite and do ‘not :support, her
argument, because they involve wholly unrelated events. See, e.g, United States... Halper, 590
F.2d 422, 43.1 (2d Gir. 1.978) (severing. a Medicaid fraud indictment. from.a tax evasion indictment.

where the only similarly was the defendant’s manipulation. of people he had.cmployed—different.

°3 "While the defendant ‘may argue that the fact that. her deposition, ‘unlike Aivz, did not involve
criminal. authorities: counsels: in favor of a different outcome, as: discussed further below, ‘the:
prospect .of a criminal. prosecution was nonetheless plainly on. her mind. at the: time: of’ the:
depositions, as evidenced by the myriad.arguments she herself makes in support of her‘motions to
suppress the fruits, of'the,grand jury :subpocna,to Boies Schiller. (See, e-g., Def. Mot. 3. at 3-4, Def.
Mot. ‘1:1 at.2).
