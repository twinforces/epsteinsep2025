Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-322, tit. XX XTII,
§ 330018(a), 108 Stat. 1796, 2149 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3283 (1994)) (“No statute of limitations
that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse
of a child under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution before the child reaches the
age of 25.””).

As the Second Circuit has recognized, “after nearly a decade, Congress began to view even
the extended statute of limitations period in the 1994 version of § 3283 as ‘inadequate in many
cases’ because it released from criminal liability sex abusers whose crimes were not brought to the
attention of federal authorities until after their victims turned twenty-five.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d
at 54 (citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 108-66, at 54 (2003)). Accordingly, in April 2003, Congress
amended Section 3283 to permit the prosecution of sex offenses against minors at any time during
the lifetime of the minor victim. Prosecutorial Remedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of
Children Today Act (“PROTECT Act”) of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-21, tit. II, § 202, 117 Stat. 650,

prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under
the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child.”).

In January 2006, Congress further amended Section 3283 to its current form to permit the
prosecution of such offenses during the lifetime of the victim or ten years after the offense,
whichever is longer. Violence Against Women and Department of Justice Reauthorization Act of
2006, Pub. L. No. 109-162, tit. XI, § 1182(c), 119 Stat. 2960, 3126 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3283
(2006)) (“No statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense
involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall
