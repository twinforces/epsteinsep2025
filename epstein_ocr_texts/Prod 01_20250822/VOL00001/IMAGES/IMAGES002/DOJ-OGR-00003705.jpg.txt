has committcd.to producing co-conspirator statements at.Icast-six wecks ‘in, advance of trial to

C. Witness list

As a general. matter, “district. courts have authority to compel pretrial. disclosure, of the.
identity of government witnesses.” Wnited States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 300 (2d.Cir, 1975).
In deciding whether to order accelerated. disclosure of'a’witness list, courts consider whether a
defendant has made.a specific: showing that disclosure is “both:material to the preparation of the
defense and-reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.” United States v.
Bejasa, 904 F.2d 137, 139-140 (2d Cir. 1990) (cleaned up).

Maxwell. has:madea particularized. showing ‘that:the Government. must produce a witness
list:reasonably in,advance of trial. The nature of the allegations inthis case—decades-old,
allegations spanning. multiplé locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of
the defense. However, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford
Maxwell at Icast six’ weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—=allows Maxwell
significantly: more time to:review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this
District. See, e.g, United’ States v. Ruch, No. 00-CR-91 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at. *9
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2001) (thirty days before'trial); Vnited States v:, Nachamic, 91.F. Supp. 2d 565,
580 (S.D-N-Y. 2000) (fourteen. days before trial). In addition, on April 13,'202:1, the
Government produced. over:20,000 pages of interview notes, reports and, other materials. related
to non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circunistances, including the Complexity of the

discovery, the Court.concludes that the Government’s ‘proposal is generally reasonable.
