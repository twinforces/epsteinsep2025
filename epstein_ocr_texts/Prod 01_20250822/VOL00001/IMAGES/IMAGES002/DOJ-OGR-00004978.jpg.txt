Court in. Commonwealth v. Cosby, No. 39 MAP 2020, 2021, WL 2674380 (Pa. June-30, 2021),
‘requires dismissal. Neither argument:is persuasive.

Annabi contains no exception. for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are
“identical to the dismissed charges.” In the language Maxwell cites from Annabi, the Second,
Cireuit discussed (and rejected) a claini.based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, ‘not a‘claim based.
