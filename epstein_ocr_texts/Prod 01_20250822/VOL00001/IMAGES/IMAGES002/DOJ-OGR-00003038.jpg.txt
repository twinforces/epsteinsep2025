“Agent Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig., 821 F.2d 139, 147 (2d Cir. 1987); see also Andover Data
Servs., a Div. of Players Computer, Inc. v. Statistical Tabulating Corp., 876 F.2d 1080, 1083 (2d
Cir. 1989) (“It is well-settled here and elsewhere, for instance, that a Rule 26(c) protective order
may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary circumstances
or compelling need.”).

In Martindell, the Government informally—and without use of a grand jury subpoena—

parties, including the Government.” /d.; see also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated
Apr. 19, 1991, 945 F.2d 1221, 1224-25 (2d Cir. 1991) (“The Martindell test [ | does not transform
a protective order into a grant of immunity because the test allows a protective order to be
overcome by a showing of improvidence in the grant of the order, extraordinary circumstances or
compelling need.”); Palmieri v. State of N.Y., 779 F.2d 861, 862 (2d Cir. 1985) (holding that
