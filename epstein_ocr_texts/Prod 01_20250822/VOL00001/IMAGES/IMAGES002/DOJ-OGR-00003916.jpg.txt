ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
The Court is in receipt of the Defendant’s and Boies Schiller Flexner LLP’s April 19,
2021 joint letter responding to the Court’s April 19, 2021 Order, Dkt. No. 215. The letter
proposes limited redactions on the basis that some of the information is covered by the terms of
the protective order in this case.
In light of this, by April 22, 2021, the Defendant and BSF are hereby ORDERED to
confer with the Government regarding whether the Government requests redaction of any
information contained in the Defendant’s response to BSF’s objections to the Defendant’s
proposed Rule 17(c) subpoena, BSF’s reply, and the April 19, 2021 joint letter addressing the
redactions to these documents.
The Government may submit any redaction requests by April 23, 2021; in doing so, the
Government shall justify any proposed redactions by reference to the test articulated in Lugosch
v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).
The Defendant, BSF, and the Government are further ORDERED to notify the Court
whether any party seeks redactions to the April 19, 2021 joint letter. If not, the Defendant shall
file the letter on the public docket by April 23, 2021.
SO ORDERED.
