courthouse, were drawn from Nassau and Suffolk Counties. /d. at 24. The defendant argued that
the district court erred by selecting the jury from the “Long Island Division” wheel because there
was under-representation of Blacks and Hispanics in that “division” as compared to the Eastern
District as a whole. /d. at 23-24. The Second Circuit rejected the argument, finding that it “[wa]s
based upon an improper premise.” /d. at 24. Contrary to the defendant’s claims, “[w]here a jury
venire is drawn from a properly designated division, we look to that division to see whether there
has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Jd. (emphasis added).

Consistent with Bahna, courts have repeatedly found that defendants in criminal cases have
no constitutional or statutory right to a jury drawn from the entire district or from a particular
geographic area within a district, such as the county or “division” where the offense was
committed. See, e.g., Rutenberg v. United States, 245 U.S. 480, 482 (1918) (rejecting claim that
defendant had Sixth Amendment right to jury drawn from entire district); United States v. Miller,
116 F.3d 641, 659 (2d Cir. 1997) (“‘Th[e] [Sixth] Amendment’s guarantees of an impartial jury ‘of
the State and district’ in which the crime was committed does not require a narrower geographical
focus than the district itself.”); United States v. Richardson, 537 F.3d 951, 959 (8th Cir. 2008) (a
criminal defendant “does not have a right to have his trial in or jurors summoned from a particular
division of the state and district where the crime was committed”); United States v. Herbert, 698
F.2d 981, 984 (9th Cir. 1983) (finding that “[a] petit jury may be drawn constitutionally from only
one division and not the whole district”); Zicarelli v. Dietz, 633 F.2d 312, 318 (3d Cir. 1980)
(“[T]there is no constitutional right to a jury chosen from the division where the offense was
committed or from the entire district which includes that division.”); United States v. Florence,
456 F.2d 46, 49-50 (4th Cir. 1972) (holding that a defendant has no constitutional or statutory right
to a jury selected from the entire district or from a particular division).
