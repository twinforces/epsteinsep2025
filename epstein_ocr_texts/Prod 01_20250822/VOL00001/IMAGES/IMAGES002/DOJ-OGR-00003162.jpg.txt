116 F.3d 641, 659 (2d Cir. 1997) (“Th[e] [Sixth] Amendment’s guarantees of an.imipartial jury ‘of
the State and district’ in which the crime:was committed does not require a narrower geographical

‘one division and. not the whole district”); Zicarelli 'v. Dietz, 633 .F.2d 312,318 (3d. Cir. 1980)
(“[E]there is ‘no constitutional right to a jury chosen. from the division where: the: offense was
committed. or from the entire. district which. includes that division.”); Waited States. Florence,
456 F.2d.46, 49-50 (4th Cir. 1972) (holding that a defendant has:no constitutional, or statutory right:
