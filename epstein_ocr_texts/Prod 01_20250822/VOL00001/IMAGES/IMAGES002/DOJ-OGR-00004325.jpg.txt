SIGNIFICANT ENTITIES AND INDIVIDUALS
1. THE FEDERAL AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES

A. The Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District

of Florida, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation

The Department of Justice (Department) is a cabinet-level executive branch department
headed by the United States Attorney General. The stated mission of the Department is to enforce
federal law and defend the interests of the United States; ensure public safety; provide federal
leadership in preventing and controlling crime; seek just punishment for those guilty of unlawful
behavior; and ensure the fair and impartial administration of justice. The Department enforces
federal criminal law through investigations and prosecutions of violations of federal criminal
statutes. It also engages in civil litigation. During the period relevant to this Report, the
Department had approximately 110,000 employees in 40 components. The Department’s
headquarters are in Washington, D.C., and it conducts most of its work through field locations
around the nation and overseas.

The prosecution of federal criminal laws is handled primarily through 94 U.S. Attorney’s
Offices, each headed by a presidentially appointed (with advice and consent of the U.S. Senate)
U.S. Attorney who has independent authority over his or her office but is overseen by the Attorney
General through the Deputy Attorney General.! The Department’s Criminal Division, headed by
an Assistant Attorney General, includes components with specialized areas of expertise that also
prosecute cases, assist in the prosecutions handled by U.S. Attorney’s Offices, and provide legal
expertise and policy guidance. Among the Criminal Division components mentioned in this
Report are the Appellate Section, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the Computer Crime and
Intellectual Property Section, and, most prominently, the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section
(CEOS).

CEOS, based in Washington, D.C., comprises attorneys and investigators who specialize
in investigating and prosecuting child exploitation crimes, especially those involving technology,
and they assist U.S. Attorney’s Offices in investigations, trials, and appeals related to these
offenses. CEOS provides advice and training to federal prosecutors, law enforcement personnel,
and government officials. CEOS also works to develop and refine proposals for prosecution
policies, legislation, government practices, and agency regulations.

The U.S. Attorneys’ Manual (USAM) (revised in 2018 and renamed the Justice Manual)
is a compilation of Department rules, policies, and guidance governing the conduct of Department
employees. It includes requirements for approval by, or consultation with, the Criminal Division
! Two U.S. Attorney’s Offices, in the judicial districts of Guam and of the Northern Mariana Islands, are
headed by a single U.S. Attorney. The Attorney General and the U.S. District Court have authority to appoint acting
and interim U.S. Attorneys.
