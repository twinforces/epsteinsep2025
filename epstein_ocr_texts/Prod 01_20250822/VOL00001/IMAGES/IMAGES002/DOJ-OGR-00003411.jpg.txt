had already, been signed that precluded a any: prosecution of Epstein
for'fedcral charges against me. I did not.gct-the opportunity. to: mect
of confer. with the prosecuting attorneys about any‘potential federal
deal-that related to me orthe crimes committed against: me.

My understanding of the agents’ ‘explanation, was that. the federal.
investigation, would continue. J also ‘understood that my: own case
would move ‘forward towards prosecution of Epstein.

In, addition, the ‘case: agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions: to
WVillafafia in,an, email:

Jane Doe #14 asked me why [Epstein] was.reeciving such a lite [Sic]
jail sentence and Jane Doe #13 has asked for ‘our Victim. ‘Witness
vended [profesional c counseling. “Other. ‘than that. their response
was filled with emotion and grateful, to the Federal authorities for
pursuing justice and-hot giving’ “up.2°°

The case agent:told OPR that: when she informed one-of these victims, that individual cried. and.
expressed “‘a.sense of:relicf.”” Counsel for “Jane: Doe: #13” told OPR.that while his elient recalled,
mecting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did:not reeall receiving any information about:
Epstein’s guilty plea. In.a letter t6 OPR, “Jane, Doe #14°s” attorricy’ stated that although. her, elient.
recalled speaking with an FBI agent, she: was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein.
would.not face federal, charges in exchange for his state court plea.

After mecting ‘with these three victims, the FBI case agent: became concerned that, if
Epstein. breached 'the NPA and 'the, case went to federal trial, the defense could ‘use the victims’
knowledge of the: NP.A’s monctary damages provision:as a basis to impeach. the victims. 344 “The
‘case agent explained. to OPR. that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims: about the:
damages. provision, and. that as the Icad. investigator, “if we did cnd.up going to trial. . . [if]
Mr: Epstein breached this that]. would be on the stand” testifying that “I told cvery onc of these
girls that they could sue Mr. Epstein. formoncy, and I was 'not comfortable with that, I didn’t think
it was:right.”

Similarly. the co-case agent told. OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went. back to Maric [Villafafia]
and. satd'we’re not. comfortable ‘now: putting , y this. out-there . . . because. . . it’s likely that [the case
agent] and I are going to, have: to take the stand.if it went to trial, and this could be.a. problem’”
Villafafia told OPR.that the case agents were concerned they. would be accused.of “offering a bribe
308, The case agent did ‘not record any: of the victim ‘notifications ‘in ‘interview reports, because “it wasn’t an,
interview: of, them, it: was, a; notification... . » [I]f. there was something . ; .. relevant: [that] came up pertaining: to the
investigations or something:that: thought was noteworthy »:~ 1 might, have [recorded it in-ancinterview-report}.*
