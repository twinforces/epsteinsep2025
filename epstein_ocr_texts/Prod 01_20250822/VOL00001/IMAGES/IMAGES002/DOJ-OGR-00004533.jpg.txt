Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 236 of 349

During this meeting, the Agents did not explain that an agreement

had already been signed that precluded any prosecution of Epstein

for federal charges against me. I did not get the opportunity to meet

or confer with the prosecuting attorneys about any potential federal

deal that related to me or the crimes committed against me.

My understanding of the agents’ explanation was that the federal
investigation would continue. I also understood that my own case

would move forward towards prosecution of Epstein.

In addition, the case agent spoke to two other victims and relayed their reactions to

Villafafia in an email:

Jane Doe #14 asked me why [Epstein] was receiving such a lite [sic]

jail sentence and Jane Doe #13 has asked for our Victim Witness

coordinator to get in touch with her so she can receive some much

needed [professional counseling. Other than that, their response

was filled with emotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for

pursuing justice and not giving up.°°
The case agent told OPR that when she informed one of these victims, that individual cried and
expressed “a sense of relief.” Counsel for “Jane Doe #13” told OPR that while his client recalled
meeting with the FBI on a number of occasions, she did not recall receiving any information about
Epstein’s guilty plea. In a letter to OPR, “Jane Doe #14’s” attorney stated that although her client
recalled speaking with an FBI agent, she was not told about the NPA or informed that Epstein
would not face federal charges in exchange for his state court plea.

After meeting with these three victims, the FBI case agent became concerned that, if
Epstein breached the NPA and the case went to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’
knowledge of the NPA’s monetary damages provision as a basis to impeach the victims.*** The
case agent explained to OPR that she became “uncomfortable” talking to the victims about the
damages provision, and that as the lead investigator, “if we did end up going to trial. . . [if]
Mr. Epstein breached this that I would be on the stand” testifying that “I told every one of these
girls that they could sue Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think
it was right.”

Similarly, the co-case agent told OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went back to Marie [Villafafia]
and said we’re not comfortable now putting this out there... because. . . it’s likely that [the case
agent] and I are going to have to take the stand if it went to trial, and this could be a problem.”
Villafafia told OPR that the case agents were concerned they would be accused of “offering a bribe
08 The case agent did not record any of the victim notifications in interview reports, because “it wasn’t an
interview of them, it was a notification. ... [I]f there was something. . . relevant [that] came up pertaining to the
investigation, or something that I thought was noteworthy . . . I might have [recorded it in an interview report].”

304 Within limitations set by the Federal Rules of Evidence, a defendant may attack the credibility of a witness
through evidence of bias, which may include the witness having received money, or expecting to receive money, from
the government, the defendant, or other sources as a result of the witness’s allegations or testimony.
