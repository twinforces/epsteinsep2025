July 12, 2021 as a potential trial date. Counsel resisted this date because of Ms.

All defense counsel but one in J are amenable to a postponement; the remaining co-

conspiracy with two alleged co-conspirators. The second superseding indictment adds seven
years to the scope of the alleged conspiracy. This is a material change that, standing alone,
