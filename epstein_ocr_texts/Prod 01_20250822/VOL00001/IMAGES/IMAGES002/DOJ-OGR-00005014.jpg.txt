‘Re: United States v. Ghisluine Maxwell
S220 Cr. 330 (AIN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The government-cannot, resist. the opportunity. to gratuitously cast.Ghislaine Maxwell ina.
negative light; while it defends the Metropolitan, Detention Center at‘all costs, regardless of the facts.
[Dkt. 326]. The government accuses Ms. Maxwell of using a cart to, barricade the door to the VTC
room. The cart was never uscd to barricade. The government has chosen to:makce:this:an issuc. - when. it
never was - to justify the: restriction. placed on the amount of legal materials:Ms. Maxwell can bring :into
the VTC room on,any. given, day.

The: government mischaracterizés facts to, which it doés not, have first-hand. knowledge.
Ms. Maxwell continues to, use:the cart daily to bring legal material into the VTC room and to remove
those: documents at.the:cnd ‘of the VIC session. Most of:her legal. papers. are kept in.a separate room.
She is only allowed-to bring. a certain, portion of documents: to any given VTC session and.is not allowed
to leave the VTC. room to collect additional documents that may be needed for review'and discussion,
with, counsel. The amount of Icgal ‘material.Ms. Maxwell can access depends ‘upon rules that fluctuate
With, cach-teaim rotated into 'the, MDC. every two weeks to guard her.

compromises Ms, Maxwell’ 5 ability to prepare > for trial,
Very truly yours,

cc: All counsel
