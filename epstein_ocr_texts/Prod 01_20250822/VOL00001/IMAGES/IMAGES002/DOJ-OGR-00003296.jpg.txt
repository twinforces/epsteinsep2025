protracted ‘phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department: of Justice. Despite the:
fact that Epstein, and his attorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new. strategy: of appealing’
to senior Department managers ‘with ‘the goal. of setting aside the NPA entirely. Although.
ultimately unsuccessful, the: strategy delayed:the entry-of Epstein’ s guilty plea by months.

Sloman to address ‘with Lefkowitz. Among’ other things, Villafafia pointed out: that. the NPA.

with the timeline established Py the NPA when. he sought and obtained a plea hearing
USAO’s s communications with \ various ; entities and individuals, ‘Villafania noted that the USAO
needed to, be able to communicate ‘with the State Attorncy’s Office and the victims’ attorney. “to
(c]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the: terms of the agreement.”

That same day, Assistant State Attorney Belohlavck informed Sloman, that: the state, judge
assigned to the:case had schcduled’Epstcin.s plea and.sentence ‘in, carly January.2008. ‘Belohlavek.
assured, Sloman that: the “plea ‘and. sentence will definitely occur before the January’4th date that.
was agrecd.on by all forthe sentencing.”'? Nonetheless, emails over the course of the nextimonth
show that the USAO, the State Attorncy’s: Officc,, and defense counsel. continued to:communicate
regarding, the date: of the'g guilty plea, with. the USAO asserting that a. proposed January 7, 2008
date for the entry of Epstcin’s guilty plea. was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that.
Epstein, had, not agreed ‘to ‘any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various
potential dates, on December 7, 2007, Epstein attorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of
Hearing, s¢tting:the case ‘for January 4, 2008.'°°
