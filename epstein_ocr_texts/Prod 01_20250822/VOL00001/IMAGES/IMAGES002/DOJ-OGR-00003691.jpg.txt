171, F.3d 748, 751 (2d Cir. 1999) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v.. Marion, 404 U.S. 307,
322 (1971)). There-is a strong presumption. that. an indictment:filed within the statute of
limitations is valid. ‘To prevail on.a claim.that pre-indictment delay violates duc process, a
defendant must show both,that:the Government-intentionally delayed bringing charges for an
improper purpose and:that'the. dclay seriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the
shut the door‘firmly’ on.a. contention that: at; some ‘point: the Due Process Clause ‘forccloses
prosccution of.a claim. because it is'too old, at most the door is barely: ajar.” DeMichele v.

The Court sees no. evidence that.the Government?s delay in. bringing these: charges was
designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. However, it is.cnough to say that.
Maxwell does not;make'the strong showing of*prejudice required'to support-this sort of claim:
Maxwell contends thatthe Government’s delay in. bringing charges has prejudiced her interests
because potential. witnesses have diced, others have forgotten, and:records have been Jost or
destroyed. It-is highly: speculative that any of these factors, would make a substantial. difference
‘in. her case.

Maxwell first points to several potential witnesses who have passed. away., These include
Jeffrey Epstein.and his mother, one individual Maxwell beli¢ves worked with one of the alléged
victims :in-this case, and.a police: detective who investigated Epstein :in Florida. She contends
they. all would’have provided exculpatory testimony were'they alive'today. Courts have
gencrally found that vaguc assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable.

F. Supp. 2d 396, 399=400 (S.D.N-Y.:2005). The Court agrees with this approach. Maxwell
