considered the Government’s application and then issued a lengthy opinion ruling on that
application, the Government was entirely reasonable in its understanding that the order was lawful.
It was therefore similarly reasonable for the Government to obtain materials from Boies Schiller
in response to the subpoena that had been analyzed and blessed by a court order. The Government
acted with an “objectively reasonable good-faith belief’ that its conduct was lawful and in
reasonable reliance on the district court’s order. Zodhiates, 901 F.3d at 143 (internal quotation
marks and citations omitted).

c. Suppression of Certain Materials Would Be Improper Under
the Inevitable Discovery Doctrine
To the extent materials the Government obtained from Boies Schiller have now been
unsealed and posted on the public docket, there is no basis to suppress such materials because the
Government would have inevitably been able to access them upon unsealing.
i. Applicable Law
Under the inevitable discovery doctrine, “evidence that was illegally obtained will not be
suppressed ‘if the government can prove that the evidence would have been obtained inevitably’
even if there had been no statutory or constitutional violation.” United States v. Roberts, 852 F.2d
671, 675-76 (2d Cir. 1988) (quoting Nix v. Williams, 467 U.S. 431, 447 (1984)). When a claim of
inevitable discovery is raised, the court must “determine, viewing affairs as they existed at the
instant before the unlawful search occurred, what would have happened had the unlawful search
never occurred.” Stokes, 733 F.3d at 444 (citation omitted) (emphasis in original); see also United
States v. Heath, 455 F.3d 52, 55 (2d Cir. 2006) (The application of the inevitable discovery
doctrine “turns on a central question: Would the disputed evidence inevitably have been found
through legal means ‘but for’ the constitutional violation? If the answer is ‘yes,’ the evidence
seized will not be excluded.”).
