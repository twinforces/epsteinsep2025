VI. THE, GOVERNMENT. FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND
FEDERAL INVESTIGATION

Although OPR. does. not conelude that any of the subjects conimitted professional.
misconduct, cither ‘by: failing to consult: with. the victims before: the NRA. was signed. or in.
interactions afterwards, OPR’s findings: are not an endorsement of the government’s course of
action. ‘The government’s interactions. with, victims confused. and, frustrated many of: the victims,
particularly the two'C VRA: petitioners andthe! two, victims who had. unsuceessfully’ attempted. to
join, in the CVRA litigation. As.a result, the'victims’ and-the. public’s, perception of the matter is
that the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s attorneys to. disenfranchise and silence the victims. It.
is‘unfortunate, and appears fundamentally: unfair tothe victims, that: Acosta and. Sloman (after
Menchel. and, Lourie departed) took: the unusual step of deciding to vet. the USAO victim
notification. letters. with the defense after the NPA. was signed, but: failed to go beyond ‘the
‘requirements of the CVRA orthe: 2005 Guidelines to consult;with the victims before the NPA was
Signed. This résult.is contrary'to, the Departinent’s iftcnt, as. sct forth i the'2005 Guidelines, that
Department employees work: to ‘ ‘minimize ‘the frustration and. confusion. 'that: victims of crime:
endure in its wake.” When considcring;the entirety ‘of the government’s interactions with victims,
OPR concludes, that victims were: not. treated with the.:forthrightness. and. sensitivity expeeted ‘by
‘the Department.

Wild’s criticisms ofthe government’s conduct were based.on :intcractions that are similar
to.and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other ‘Epstein victims and.
that demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity tothe victims by the government. Wild experienced,
a scrics of confusing and inconsistent;communications in. her interactions ‘with ‘Villafafia and the
case agents. Wild reccived Villafana’s letter in, Juné 2007 stating inaccurately that she Was a.
federal victim entitled to CV.RA rights. She was:interviewed bythe: FBI in-August 2007. but was
not told that a potential outcome was a, state-plea. Shortly: after the September 24, 2007 signing. of
the NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her. of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,
on January ‘10, 2008, the FBI sent: her a victims’ rights letter indicating that the case was ‘under
investigation and, that.some of her CVRA rights may. not. apply until after the defendant was
charged. ‘On January 31, 2008, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS attorney and
the FBI agents, and told Wild thatthe case was:under investigation, but:did:not specifically:mention.
the NPA, although she may have ‘mentioned. a. possible resolution. In, mid-June’ 2008, when
Edwards. contacted. Villafaria:‘on Wild’s behalf, Villafatia informed. him, that the case was under
investigation but did. not ‘mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 30, 2008 state court. plea,

HS OPR. notes: that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted, with .a victim's, attorney’ during the time period,

between the signing of the NPA. and Epstein’s. state guilty. plea. In January 2008, Sloman:received a: telephone ‘eall
from his former. law partner; who: represented one of the; victims and who, asked Sloman, whether ‘the federal
government.could bring: charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict: of interest:
allegations ‘due to: his prior’business relations with ‘the. attorneys refused to answer any: questions regarding Epstein.
Because Sloman refused.to;provide any information, OPR found no basis:for finding that Sloman.misled.the attorney.
