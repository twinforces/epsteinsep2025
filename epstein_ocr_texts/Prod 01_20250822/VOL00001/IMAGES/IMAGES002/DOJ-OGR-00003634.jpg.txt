and the more homogeneous the area, the more accurate the geocoding estimate. I defined the
population in the census tract as U.S. citizens of voting age. To estimate the percent Hispanic, I
used the Bayesian Improved Surname Geocoding (BISG) method, which enhances the accuracy
of the geocoding by also using information about the ethnicity of a person’s last name. This
method has been shown to significantly improve the estimation for Hispanics. !°

27. There is one constraint on the accuracy of the geocoding methodology. The basic
assumption is that if the potential voting eligible population (U.S. citizens of voting age) ina
census tract is 85% African American, then we would expect 85% of those on the master jury
wheel who reside in that census tract to be African American. However, since the master jury
wheel is selected from registered voters and not from potentially voting-eligible persons, this
assumes that the likelihood of registering to vote for those who live within the same census tract
is the same by race and ethnicity. If African Americans and/or Hispanics are less likely to
register to vote, the results of the geocoding will overestimate the percent of African Americans
and Hispanics on the master jury wheel (reason 1). However, there is no valid statistical
evidence to conclude there is such a difference."!

28. Based on the geocoding, the race and ethnicity representation of the master jury
wheel is 11.20% African American and 12.97% Hispanic. Thus, the master jury wheel is 1.25

Census Bureau’s Surname List to Improve Estimates of Race/Ethnicity and Associated
Disparities” in Health Serv Outcomes Res Method 9:69-83 (2009).

'! The only data available on citizens registering to vote by race and ethnicity is published by the
U.S. Census Bureau, Current Population Survey November 2016, and it shows the rates across
the state, not within the same census tract. The difference in rates of registering by race and
ethnicity statewide would be expected to be greater than within census tracts. The data for
November 2016 shows African American citizens more likely to register by 1 percentage point,
and Hispanic citizens less likely to register by 7.2 percentage points. Neither of these differences
are statistically significantly.
