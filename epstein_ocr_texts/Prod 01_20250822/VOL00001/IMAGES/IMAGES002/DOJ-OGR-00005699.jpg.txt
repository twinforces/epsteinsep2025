and requested a ride away from the:murder scene shortly after the crime took place did-not
support an inference of guilt).

The 'government:therefore cannot establish, with any degree.of confidence, sufficient
facts to satisfy cven the:first of the Sudawi inferences. Al-Sudawi,:432 F.3d at-424 (probative:
valuc of flight evidence as. proof of consciousness of guilt “depends upon the degree of
‘confidence with which four inferences can be:drawn: (1) ‘from the defendant’s behavior to:
flight...."). Allowing the government. to present. this evidence to'the jury’ as evidence of “flight”
would:invite the jury: to infer consciousness: of guilt based ‘on nothing more than:unfounded
speculation. ‘That'is patently improper and, must'be precluded. Jd. (citing Sanchez, 790 F.2d at
252 (flight evidence “must.... provide: the jury. with more than. an opportunity for nicre conjecture
and. speculation.” (internal quotation marks and.citation omitted))).

Furthermore, ‘admitting evidence of ‘flight; would be misleading to'the jury:and unfairly
prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. It would also require the defense to call withesses. to counter the
government’s evidence and.lead.to a distracting mini trial on the issue of flight. The prejudice,
confusion, and, delay’ caused by admitting’this evidence would substantially outweigh any limited
probative value it-may have. It must.therefore be excluded under Rule 403. See-Fed. R. Evid.
403; see ulso Green, 2017 WL 4803957, at. *4-*5 (precluding flight evidence pursuant to A/-

Sudawi and. Rule 403).
