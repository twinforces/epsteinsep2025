AK indicated that the article did not. accurately describe AK’s interactions with attorneys
for Virginia Roberts.

AK’s recollection is not.that.attorncys urged. SDNY to open an, investigation into’ “the
duo.” They were focused on Epstein. Maxwell was mentioned in-passing, not as.a target.
AK. did not participate in a'second mecting with anyone. ‘Had there been a meeting on,

this subject in the summer of 2016 in. SDNY, AK would have.known about it in her
capacity as Human Trafficking Coordinator.

o AK.had been in'that;role since approximately 20.0, and if somcone came in.to
mect with a ‘unit chicf about a:potential human, trafficking-matter, AK would. get:
contacted ‘about the meeting. AK-met with chiefs to gather information about any
cases they had that touched. on-human trafficking: so that AK. could coordinate. So
if a-sccond mecting had'taken. place with a-supervisor.in,the office, AK would
have known about it. Dan‘Stein also would:have brought AK in if he learned of a,
second mecting.
