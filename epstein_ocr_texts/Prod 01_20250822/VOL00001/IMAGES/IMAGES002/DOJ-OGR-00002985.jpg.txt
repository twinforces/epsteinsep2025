A. Statutory Background

Between 1990 and. 2006, Congress passed a scrics of laws. that.expanded the statute of
limitations for ‘prosccutions of crimes against ‘minors, ultimately extending the statute of

Crim. L. & Criminology 1, 60-61 (1986)).

prosécution before the child reaches the age of 25 years.” Crime Control.Act of 1.990, Pub. L.’No.

Congress re-codified this provision, moving it to ‘18 U.S.C. § 3283 ‘with identical, language.
