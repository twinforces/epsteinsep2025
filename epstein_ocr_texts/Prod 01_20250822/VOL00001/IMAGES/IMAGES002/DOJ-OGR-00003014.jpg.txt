Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 80 of 239

The Second Circuit has clearly held that a defendant seeking the dismissal of an indictment
filed within the statute of limitations must establish that the Government acted intentionally,
deliberately, or with some strategy, and that the Government used that delay to gain a tactical
advantage over the defendant. See, e.g., Cornielle, 171 F.3d at 752 (delay must be “intentional
device to gain [a] tactical advantage over the accused”); see also United States v. Alameh, 341
F.3d 167, 176 (2d Cir. 2003) (“To show unjustifiable conduct, a defendant must demonstrate that
the government has intentionally used delay to gain unfair tactical advantage.”); see also United
States v. Delacruz, 970 F. Supp. 2d 199, 203 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (“Delacruz’s motion to dismiss
would nevertheless fail for the independent reason that he has not made any showing that the
preindictment delay was an intentional device designed by the Government to gain a tactical
advantage.”’); United States v. Martinez, No. 94 Cr. 219 (RPP), 1995 WL 10849, at *4 (S.D.N.Y.
Jan. 12, 1995) (“In order to establish improper delay by the Government in filing an indictment, a
defendant must show that the delay was the result of an intentional device of the Government to
gain tactical advantage over the accused.” (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted) (citing
United States v. Hoo, 825 F.2d 667, 671 (2d Cir. 1987))). Indeed, some version of the phrase
“deliberate device” and “tactical advantage” is found in nearly every Second Circuit decision on
the issue. See, e.g., Alameh, 341 F.3d at 176 (“intentionally used delay to gain unfair tactical
advantage”); Cornielle, 171 F.3d at 752 (requiring “intentional device” to gain “tactical
advantage”); Lawson, 683 F.2d at 694 (delay not “engineered by the government for an improper
purpose, such as gaining a tactical advantage’’); Snyder, 668 F.2d at 689; United States v. Watson,
599 F.2d 1149, 1157 n.5 (2d Cir. 1979); United States v. Tanu, 589 F.2d 82, 89 (2d Cir. 1978);
United States v. Laurenti, 581 F.2d 37, 40 n.11 (2d Cir. 1978); United States v. Hillegas, 578 F.2d
453, 460 (2d Cir. 1978).
