OPR was attentive to any evidence that any of the subjects was motivated by bribes, gratuities, or
other illegal political or personal considerations, and found no such indication.’ Witnesses,
including law enforcement officials, were specifically asked whether they had any information
indicating such corruption, and all—notwithstanding the harsh criticism by some of those same
witnesses of the Epstein matter’s outcome—stated that they did not. Specifically, the FBI case
agent told OPR that she did not believe there had been any illegal influence, and that if she had
perceived any, she “would have gone screaming” to the FBI’s public corruption unit. The co-case
agent and the FBI supervisors up through the Special Agent in Charge likewise told OPR that they
were unaware of any indication that a prosecutor acted in the matter because of illegal factors such
as a gratuity or bribe or other corrupt influence, and that any such indication would immediately
have been referred for criminal investigation by the FBI.

B. Contemporaneous Written Records and Witness and Subject Interviews Did
Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That the Subjects Were Improperly
Influenced by Epstein’s Status, Wealth, or Associations
Although Epstein’s name is now nationally recognized, in 2006 and 2007, he was not a
familiar national figure or even particularly well known in Florida. All five subjects told OPR that
when they first learned of the investigation, they had not heard of Epstein. Similarly, the FBI case
agent told OPR that when the investigation began, no one in the FBI appeared to have heard of
Epstein, and other witnesses also told OPR that they were initially unfamiliar with Epstein.
However, news reports about Epstein’s July 2006 arrest on the state indictment, which were
contemporaneous with the beginning of the federal investigation, identified him as a wealthy Palm
Beach resident with influential contacts, including William Clinton, Donald Trump, Kevin Spacey,
and Alan Dershowitz, and other “prominent businessmen, academics and scientists.””!° Villafafia,
Lourie, Sloman, and Acosta learned of this press coverage early in the investigation, and thus
understood that Epstein was wealthy and associated with notable public figures.7!' The FBI case
agent also told OPR that “we knew who had been on his plane, we knew . . . some of his
connections.”
1. The Contemporaneous Records Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing
That the NPA Resulted from Improper Factors
OPR found no evidence in the extensive contemporaneous documentary record that the
terms of the NPA resulted from improper factors, such as Epstein’s wealth or influential
connections. Epstein’s legal team overtly raised Epstein’s financial status in arguing for a sentence
that did not include a term of imprisonment on the ground that Epstein would be extorted in prison,
but the USAO insisted that Epstein serve a term of incarceration. Defense counsel mentioned
former President Clinton in one pre-NPA letter, but that reference was made in the context of a
202 OPR’s jurisdiction does not extend to the investigation of allegations of criminal activity. If OPR had found
indication of criminal activity, it would have referred the matter to the appropriate Department investigative agencies.

au Lourie later made Menchel aware of Epstein’s prominence in the course of forwarding to Menchel the initial
prosecution memorandum.
