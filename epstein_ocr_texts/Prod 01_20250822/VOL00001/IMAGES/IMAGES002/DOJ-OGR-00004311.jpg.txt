treatment of the victims, reflected.poorly on'the Department as ‘a whole, and is:contradictory to the
Department’s, mission to: minimize the frustration and confusion that. victims of a crime. endure.

OPR. determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications: sent to
certain, victims: after the NPA. was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and. that
failed to inform them. of the’ NPA. ‘The letters were 'sent by an FBI administrative employee who
‘was not-dircetly involved in the ‘investigation, incorporated standard, form, language ‘used. by the
FBI when communicating with victims, and were not drafted or reviewed. by ‘the. subjects.
Morcover, the statement that the matter was “under investigation” was not ‘false. because the
government: in 1 fact continued to investigate the case in, anticipation that Epstein; would not t fulfill
frustration atid confusion by. failing to provide important information about the status of the
investigation. The lctters also demonstrated. a lack. of Coordination between. the fedcral agencies
responsible for communicating with Epstcin’s victims and showed. a lack of attention. 'to. and.
oversight regarding communication with. victims.

After ‘the NPA, was signed, Acosta. clected,'to defer 'to the State Attorney the decision.
whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant to’the state*s own’ victim’s rights
requirements. Although Acosta’s decision ‘was ‘within his, authority and, did not constitute
professional misconduct, OPR. concludes that Acosta. exercised poor judgment when he failed. to
make certain, that the state intended to and would notify victims identified through the federal
Investigation about the state‘plea.hearing. His decision left victims uninformed:about:an, important.
proceeding’ that resolved the federal ‘investigation, ‘an. investigation about ‘which. the USAO had.
communicated. with victims for months. It also ultimately éreated, ‘the. misimpression. ‘that the
Department ‘intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure: that: victims. were
made aware of'a court proceeding 'that:was related to: their own cases, and thus he failed to ensure
that victims were treated with forthrightness and dignity.

After ¢xamining the full scope and context of the government’s interactions with victiins,
OPR ‘concludes that, the government’s lack of transparency. and its inconsistent messages. led. to
victims feeling confused. and. ill-treated. by the government; gave victims and the: public the
