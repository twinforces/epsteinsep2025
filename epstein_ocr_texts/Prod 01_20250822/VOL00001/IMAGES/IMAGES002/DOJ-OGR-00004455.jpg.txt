4. -FRPC 4-8:4 — Conduct 'Prejudicial'to the Administration of Justice

ERPG 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall-riot engage in conduct.involving dishonesty, fraud,
deccit, or misrepresentation.

FRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from, engaging in conduct in connection with. the practice
of law that.is prejudicial to the administration, of. justice.

In.dVorida, Bar -v. Frederick;, 756 So..2d 79, 87 (Fla..2000), the court noted that FRPC:
4-8.4(d) is not limited. to conduct:'that. occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can. be applicd to
“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” InJorida, Bar v. Shankman, 41 So, 3d 166, 172
(Fla.2010), forcxample, an attorney’s continuous hiring'and firing of:firms to assist.in.the client’s

20 OPR also ‘examined FRPE 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of.a Prosecutor. Nothing-in the text of that: rule,
however, was relevant:to the. issucs,addressed.in this Report: A comment to FRPC’Rule 4-3.8 notes;that Florida has,
adopted the American, Bar Association (ABA) Standards-of Criminal. Justice Relating to the: Prosecution Function.

These “standards,” however, are not binding rules of conduct but rather prov ide; guidance: to prosecutors. Indeed, ‘the
ABA has: expressly stated that'these:standards “are not intended to serve-as the basis forthe: imposition.of: professional
discipline, tovercate substantive or procedural. rights:for accused or.convicted persons, to, create;a standard.of care for
civil liability; or to serve asia predicate. fora motion'to suppress evidenceior dismiss:a charge.” OPR does not consider:

the ABA: standards as binding on:the conduct of Department prosecutors.
