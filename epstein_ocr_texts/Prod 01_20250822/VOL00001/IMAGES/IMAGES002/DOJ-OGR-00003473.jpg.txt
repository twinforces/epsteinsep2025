investigation. ‘Because the state indictment:and information appearcd:to pertain to far fewer than,
the total victims identified in either the state or the federal investigation, and no one: at'the USAO
‘was certain ‘which. victims were: covered. by the state charges, it should have been ‘apparent to
Acosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Attorncy’s, Office, there
was a substantial risk that. most: of the ‘victims: identificd.:in. the: federal investigation. would not
reccive notice of the hearing. “25, Notification.to'the broadest possible number of identified victims
could only‘have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO. and.
‘the state prosecutors, communication that: had ‘previously been lacking regarding other significant.
issucs. relating 'to Epstein. Villafafia. and. Slomian’s hastily arranged. effort to. enlist in. the
notification-process. PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played little:role in complying with the state’s
victim=notification obligations in a typical case, was not an-adequate substitute for careful planning
‘and, coordination with the State: Attorney’s Office.*?°

Even if the State Attorney’s ‘Office had notified.all of the identificd-victims of the upcoming
plea hearing, there'was no guarantce that such notification would have included information that.
the state plea was resolving:not just the state’s investigation.of Epstcin, but the federal investigation.
as well., The State Attorney was not obligated. by state statutes to inform the’victims of the’ status
of the federal investigation, and. there was little ‘reason to assume, ‘Krischer, or one of his.'staff,
would voluntarily do so, thereby putting the State Attorney’s Office in the position. of fielding:
victim: ‘questions, and concers about the outéonic. Furthermore, as both:the USAO and the defense
had differing views as to who could lawfully participate :in the state plea. hearing, there is: no
indication, that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took steps to ‘confirm, that, if victims appeared, they
could actually participate in the state: court procecding when,they were! not victims of the charged,

crimes. 42d

‘Through counsel, Acosta. asserted. to OPR. that because Villafafia and. Sloman both. told.
OPR that. they believed. that state: officials would notify: the: victims, “OPR. identified no reason,
why. Secretary Acosta, should have distrusted his team:on these points.” Acosta?s counsel. further:

426 The State Attorney's Office; had sits own,procedures and employees who handled victim notification; and,
‘Belohlavek: told OPR. that ‘the Chicf’of the Police Department would :not, regularly: play a, role in, the state ‘victim,

47 Although Villafafia*s: notes indicate ‘that: she researched Florida. Statutes §§:960:00 and. 921.143 when she
‘drafted.unsent letters to victims:in November and December‘2007 inviting.themrto participate in-the state plea ‘hearing
pursuant:to, those statues, the casclaw‘was not clearthat all federal victims: would have beenzallowed.toyparticipate in
the state: plea‘hearing. In'Letkowitz’s’ November 29, 2007 Ictter to. Acosta, he argued. that'the statutes afforded a-right’
to: speak at a:defendant’s sentencing or to: submit a statement only to, they, ictims of the crime:for which the:defendant:
was being senteneed. In April 2008; a Florida District ‘Court of Appeal: ruled against. a'defendant:who argued that
Florida Statute § 9211.14: 3(1): did -not:allow-the testimony of the victim's relatives at the sentencing: ‘hearing: The:court:
ruled. that § 921, 143(I)* ‘should not be :read as: limiting: the: testimony Rule 3. 720(b) allows trial courts to consider at:
sentencing hearings.” Smith y. States 982 So. 2d 69; 72 (Fla. Dist. Ct: App. 2008).
