I have reviewed the 'presénténce réport. I accept and

adopt as my findings the described offense and offense conduct,
the calculation of the guidelines. The total offense level 15
29% The defendant's criminal history category is Il, IL accept
and, adopt as my findings the déscription of the offender

characteristies as are set forth beginning at paragraph 56 ‘of

the presentence report.

I want tq thank Mr, Donaldson. for his eloquent
memorandum. I'm not going to put dll of the détails on the
record, but it. is pretty clear to me that Ms, Days' life might
have been very, very different if she had not been subjected to
the abuse she was. subjected to as a young teenager. I have no
reason to believe that she was on that path.

I have considered all of ‘the section 3553(a) factors,

and I conéludeé that the mandatory minimum sentence méets the

parsimony goals of the statute and is sufficient to provide
deterrence to this defendant and to punish her for the crimes
committed.

Accordingly, uhder décket number 19 CR 619, a total
offense level. of 25 and, a criminal history category of II, I

hereby. Sentence you, Tiffany Days, to the mandatory minimum

term of 60 months' imprisonment, to be followed, by 'a term of

four years' supervised release. I am not imposing a finé. The

defendant, has no ability to pay. Restitution is not

applicable.
