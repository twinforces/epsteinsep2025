1 I have reviewed the presentence report. I accept and
2 adopt as my findings the described offense and offense conduct,
3 the calculation of the guidelines. The total offense level is
4 25. The defendant's criminal history category is II. I accept
a and adopt as my findings the description of the offender

6 characteristics as are set forth beginning at paragraph 56 of

7 the presentence report.

8 I want to thank Mr. Donaldson for his eloquent

9 memorandum. I'm not going to put all of the details on the

10 record, but it is pretty clear to me that Ms. Days' life might
11 have been very, very different if she had not been subjected to
12 the abuse she was subjected to as a young teenager. I have no
13 reason to believe that she was on that path.

14 I have considered all of the section 3553(a) factors,
15 and I conclude that the mandatory minimum sentence meets the

16 parsimony goals of the statute and is sufficient to provide

17 deterrence to this defendant and to punish her for the crimes
18 committed.

19 Accordingly, under docket number 19 CR 619, a total
20 offense level of 25 and a criminal history category of II, I
21 hereby sentence you, Tiffany Days, to the mandatory minimum
22 term of 60 months! imprisonment, to be followed by a term of
23 four years' supervised release. I am not imposing a fine. The
24 defendant has no ability to pay. Restitution is not
25 applicable.
