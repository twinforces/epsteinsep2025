Co-Conspirator Statements

The government’s letter raises a second issue—disclosure of the purported co-conspirator
statements it intends to offer at trial. The government says that, at least as of August 18, it
intends to seek admission of co-conspirator statements from only two individuals: Jeffrey
Epstein and the employee of Epstein’s referenced in paragraph 25(d) of the S2 Indictment. Dkt.
320 at 2. But the government also hedges, allowing for the possibility that it might identify
“statements for use at trial from additional co-conspirators.” Jd.

Both in its August 18 letter and during an August 24 conferral call, the government took
the position that it has no obligation to identify the specific statements it intends to offer under
Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E). The government told defense counsel that Ms. Maxwell
could glean what statements might be offered from the government’s witness list and exhibit list,
once those lists are disclosed on October 11.

This Court has already resolved this matter, and the government’s position is another
improper attempt to obtain reconsideration.

After conferral, the parties spelled out their positions with respect to the disclosure of co-
conspirator statements and the identities of co-conspirators. Dkt. 291 at 5, 8-9. On June 2, this
Court ordered the government to disclose “co-conspirator statements” no later than October 11.
Dkt. 297 at 1. In the same order, the Court additionally ordered the government to disclose its
witness list and proposed exhibit list, also by October 11. /d. The Court then ordered the parties
to file their motions in limine by October 18 and responses by November 1.”

> The in limine response date since has been advanced to October 25, 2021. Dkt. 330.
