PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Omnibus Memorandum in Support of her
Supplemental Pretrial Motions Related to the S2 Superseding Indictment (“Motion”). For the
reasons set forth below, Ms. Maxwell moves the Court to:

1. Dismiss Counts One, Three, Five and Six for breach of the Non-Prosecution

Agreement;

2. Dismiss Counts Five and Six for violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause;

3. Dismiss Counts Five and Six as time-barred under the statute of limitations;

4. Dismiss Count Five and Either Count One or Count Three as multiplicitous;

5. Dismiss the $2 Indictment for pre-indictment delay;

6. Order a Bill of Particulars as to Counts Five and Six;

7. Order the government to produce Accuser-4’s prior statements as Brady material.

government is willing to go to “get” Ms. Maxwell and disingenuously blame her for the crimes
of Jeffrey Epstein. No longer content to charge a 25-year-old case based on purported conduct in
the 1990s, the government now sweeps in the 2000s through the allegations of one person—

District of Florida (““USAO-SDFL”) interviewed Accuser-4 in or around 2007 during their three-
year investigation of Epstein’s alleged sexual abuse (the “Florida Investigation”). And
remarkably, although interviewed just a few years after she claims any misconduct occurred,
Accuser-4 never implicated Ms. Maxwell. Instead, she reported [is
" Accuser-4 is identified in the S2 Indictment as Minor Victim-4.
