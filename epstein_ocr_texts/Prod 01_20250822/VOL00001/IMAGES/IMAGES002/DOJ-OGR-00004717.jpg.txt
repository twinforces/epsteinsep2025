that Gonzalez could not have reasonably understood the plea agreement to restrict the Western
District of New York.”); United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) (“Here, Ajaj
presents no evidence that the parties to the Eastern District plea agreement contemplated that it
would bar the prosecution of Ajaj in any district other than the Eastern District.”). But they contain
no analysis of overlap between immunized offenses and the offense charged—a question that can
be analytically complicated—when evaluating whether the affirmative appearance rule applies at
all. See, e.g., Prisco, 391 F. App’x at 931; United States v. Laskow, 688 F. Supp. 851, 853-56
(E.D.N.Y. 1988) (analyzing whether the Eastern District of New York was bound by a California
plea agreement and then discussing the “unnecessary” question whether the new charges fell
within the scope of the plea agreement), aff'd, 867 F.2d 1425 (2d Cir.) (tbl.); cf, e.g., United States
v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 916, 922-24 (2d Cir. 1988) (analyzing whether a narcotics conspiracy count,
dismissed pursuant to a plea agreement with USAO-SDNY, was the same narcotics conspiracy
later charged by USAO-SDNY).”

As the foregoing cases illustrate, the Second Circuit has repeatedly cited Annabi for a clear
rule of interpretation: a plea agreement does not bind another district unless it affirmatively appears
otherwise. Under this clear rule, this Court has already held that the NPA does not bind this
District. To be sure, if the NPA applied in this District—and if Maxwell could invoke it—the

is, of course, bound by Annabi and not by the decisions of a circuit that expressly deviates from
Annabi’s rule. See United States v. Gebbie, 294 F.3d 540, 546-50 (3rd Cir. 2002) (criticizing
Annabi and holding that “that when a United States Attorney negotiates and contracts on behalf of
‘the United States’ or ‘the Government’ in a plea agreement for specific crimes, that attorney
speaks for and binds all of his or her fellow United States Attorneys with respect to those same
crimes and those same defendants”).
