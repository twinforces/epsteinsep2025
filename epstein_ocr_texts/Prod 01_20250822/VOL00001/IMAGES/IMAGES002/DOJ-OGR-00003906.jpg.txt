C. Some Overlapping Proof, By Itself, Does Not Make Joinder Proper

The government contends that joinder ts appropriate because it will seck to prove the
Perjury Counts ‘with some of the same witness ‘testimony that it will use to prove the Mann. Act
Counts. Resp. 141-42, That argument is-ufiavailing. Firsé, the government admits that only. “in.
one instance” docs.a charged deposition question relate to.a “specific victim” in the Indictment.
Resp. at 144. Second, as Ms: Maxwell set:forth in her opcning:memorandum, even ifthe
government:uses some minimal amount:of overlapping evidence,.including witness testimony, to
prove both. the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act’ Counts, that‘is not sufficient reason; by itself, to
try the two groups of counts together. See United States'v. Burke, 789 F. Supp.2d 395, 398
(S:D.N-Y.. 2011) (severing witness tampering charges from RICO conspiracy charges in the.
interests of judicial economy, despite fact that government would have to present “sortie
overlapping proof” and “five limited-overlapping witnesses” to prove both charges).

Incredibly, the government.also contends that answering poorly phrased questions
instead of asserting the privilege against sel f-incrimination is somehow admissible in the trial of
thie Mann Act Counts as consciousness of guilt. Resp. at 141-42. For example, the government
repeatedly claims that.Ms. Maxwell “denlicd] a “scheme to recruit‘underage girls.” /d@. The:
actual question. posed to Ms. Maxwell at her deposition was “Did Jeffrey Epstcin-have a scheme
to recruit underage girls. for sexuall massages? ‘If you know . . 2” and her-answer‘was “I don’t
know what you’re talking about.” -Apparently, the government intends -to prove this answer not
by demonstrating that Ms. Maxwell did know. what the examirer was talking about; but instead
that:a:third party — Epstein — “had'a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages.” And
the answer’ of not understanding the questioner shows “consciousness. of guilt.” This isa citcular
argument; anyone who.denics being’a witch must be.a witch. For anallegedly false exculpatory.
