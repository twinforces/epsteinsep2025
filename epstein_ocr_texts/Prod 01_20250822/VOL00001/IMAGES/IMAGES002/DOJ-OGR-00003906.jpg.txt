C. Some Overlapping Proof, By Itself, Does Not Make Joinder Proper

The government contends that joinder is appropriate because it will seek to prove the
Perjury Counts with some of the same witness testimony that it will use to prove the Mann Act
Counts. Resp. 141-42. That argument is unavailing. First, the government admits that only “in
one instance” does a charged deposition question relate to a “specific victim” in the Indictment.
Resp. at 144. Second, as Ms. Maxwell set forth in her opening memorandum, even if the
government uses some minimal amount of overlapping evidence, including witness testimony, to
prove both the Perjury Counts and the Mann Act Counts, that is not sufficient reason, by itself, to
try the two groups of counts together. See United States v. Burke, 789 F. Supp. 2d 395, 398
(S.D.N.Y. 2011) (severing witness tampering charges from RICO conspiracy charges in the
interests of judicial economy, despite fact that government would have to present “some
overlapping proof” and “five limited overlapping witnesses” to prove both charges).

Incredibly, the government also contends that answering poorly phrased questions
instead of asserting the privilege against self-incrimination is somehow admissible in the trial of
the Mann Act Counts as consciousness of guilt. Resp. at 141-42. For example, the government
repeatedly claims that Ms. Maxwell “den[ied] a “scheme to recruit underage girls.” Jd. The
actual question posed to Ms. Maxwell at her deposition was “Did Jeffrey Epstein have a scheme
to recruit underage girls for sexual massages? If you know .. .” and her answer was “I don’t
know what you’re talking about.” Apparently, the government intends to prove this answer not
by demonstrating that Ms. Maxwell did know what the examiner was talking about, but instead
that a third party — Epstein — “had a scheme to recruit underage girls for sexual massages.” And
the answer of not understanding the questioner shows “consciousness of guilt.” This is a circular
argument: anyone who denies being a witch must be a witch. For an allegedly false exculpatory
statement to be of any value “it either must involve a matter collateral to the facts establishing
