it is inapposite as well: both cases appear to concern instances in which the grand jury and trial
jury sat in the same courthouse, and thus there was no cause to consider whether the same
“community” was relevant to separate challenges to the grand and petit juries. See United States
v. Johnson, 21 F. Supp. 2d 329, 334-35 (S.D.N.Y. 1998); United States v. Kenny, 883 F. Supp.
869, 874-75 (E.D.N.Y. 1995). As such, neither case supports the proposition that where a
defendant is challenging the selection of the grand jury, the relevant “community” is the
population of the location in which her trial will be held. Such a comparison is unjustified, as
Bahna makes clear: That case appears to involve conduct that occurred in Brooklyn, appears to
have been indicted in Brooklyn, was originally tried in Brooklyn, and was later transferred to
Uniondale, where it was tried with a jury drawn from the “Long Island Division.” Yet the Second
Circuit rejected the defendant’s claimed entitlement to a jury drawn from Kings, Queens and
Richmond counties, or the entire Eastern District, because that argument—like the defendant’s
here—was based on a flawed premise.

The defendant’s proposed rule—comparing the composition of the grand jury venire to the
population of the expected trial location—makes little legal or practical sense. Where, as here,
the defendant’s challenge is to the indictment, the proceeding for which the defendant is entitled
to expect a jury drawn from a fair cross-section of the community is not the trial, but the grand
jury proceeding itself. Indeed, that must be the case, as it is not yet determined where the trial in
this matter will in fact occur. The defendant assumes that her trial will ultimately be held at the
Manhattan courthouse. While that is /ikely to be the case, it is not necessarily so. Bahna again
illustrates the point, as a case originally tried in Brooklyn was reassigned to Uniondale for the
retrial “to accommodate trial congestion in the court’s calendar during a period of judicial
emergency... .” United States v. Soares, 66 F. Supp. 2d 391, 397 n.2 (E.D.N.Y. 1999). In the
