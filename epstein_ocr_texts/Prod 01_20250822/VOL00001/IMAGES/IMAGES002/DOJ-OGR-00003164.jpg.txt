‘it is inapposite as ‘well: both, cascs.appear to concern ‘instances in which, the grand. jury’ and. trial.
jury ‘sat in the same .courthousce, and, thus there was no causé to consider whether’ the same
“community” was relevant to separate challenges to the: grand. and ‘petit,jurics. See United States
Vv: Johnson, 2.1 F. Supp: 20,329, 334-35 (S.D°N.Y. 1998); United States'v:,. Kenny, 883. F.. Supp.
869, 874-75 (E.D.N.Y. 1995). As. such, neither casé supports the proposition. that where a.
defendant. is challenging the selection of the grand jury, the relevant “community” is the:
population, of the location. in, which her frial' will be held. Such,'a,comparison. is ‘unjustified, as
Bahna.makes clear: That case appcars to.:involve. conduct. that occurred in. Brooklyn, appcars. to
have: been. indicted in, Brooklyn, was originally’ tricd.in Brooklyn, and. was later transferred to
Uniondale, where it was tried with a jury'drawn ‘from the “Long: Island Division.” Yet the Second,
Circuit rejected. the defendant’s claimed. entitlement to a jury drawn from Kings, Queens and.
Richmond. counties, or the entire Eastern District, because that argument—like the defendant’s
here—was based.on a‘flawed premise.

The defendant’s:proposed rule—comparing the composition ofthe grand jury venire to the:
population, of the expected tria/ location=makes little legal or:practical sense. Where,.as here,
the defendant’s challenge ‘is to' the indictment, the proceeding for which the: defendant ‘is entitled
jury procceding itself. Indeed, that mst be the case, as it.is not yet determined where the trial ‘in
this matter will.in fact occur. The defendant assumes that her trial. will ultimately be held at the:
Manhattan, courthouse. While that is /ikely. to be the case, it is not; necessarily so. Bahna again,
illustrates the point, as a-case..originally tried :in Brooklyn, was reassigned ‘to Uniondale for the
retrial, “to accommodate trial congestion in the ‘court’s calendar during a. period. of judicial,

emergency...» .” United States 'v. Soares, 66.F. Supp..2d 391; 397 1.2. (E.D-N.Y. 1999). Tnthe
