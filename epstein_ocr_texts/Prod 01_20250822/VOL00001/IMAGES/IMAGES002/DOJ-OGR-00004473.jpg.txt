C. Other Significant Factors .Are Inconsistent with a. Conclusion That: the
Subjects” Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences

OPR. considered additional. aspects of the Epstcin case that were inconsistent. with a.
suggestion. that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 3:1, 2007 terms was driven by’ corruption, a.
desire:to provide an improper bencfit'to Epstein, or other improper influences.

First, OPR. considered ‘highly significant 'the fact that if-Acosta’s primary motivation was.
to benefit Epstein; he had 2 an n option e\ even more favorable to Epstein available: to him. The NPA.
for. the: victims to seck monetary famages- outcomes unlikely if the: matter had been abandoned
and. sent back. to the state for whatever result state authoritics deemed. appropriate: Epstein” S
attorneys had vchemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation.
and, that. his conduct was exclusively a matter of state:concern. If the USAO had. declined to
‘intervene in the case, as Epstcin’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued.it.should,'the state;would,
have meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s.original plan, Epstein likely
would have reccived.a sentence of:probation. Menchcl described such a result as a mere “slap:on.
the wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony scx offense, no sexual, offender registration, [and] no
restitution for the victims.” ‘Instead of acecding'to Epstein’ s proposal, however, the USAO devised,
a.resolution of the federal investigation. that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address
the scriousness of Epstein’s. conduct, nevertheless. penalized Epstcin.more:than a guilty plea to the
state’ S: original charge, Standing alone. ‘would have donc. Acosta’ S. ; affirmative decision to
than exercising’ rhis discretion to quietly decline prosecution, 1S. is strong , circumstantial evidence that.
he was not acting’ for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.°*° Similarly, despite defense counsel’s
repeated requests’ to eliminaté the scxual offender registration requircment, Acosta refused to

Sloiian stated that: although Acosta. “Was sénsitive:to [P]étite policy concerns, fedéralisin-Concerns......, Twas
not.” Meiichel coninientéed.“T don*t think itwould have béen a concem:of mine,”

Menchel, also ‘pointed out during his OPR interview that; Acostarwas Republican and “had: nothing to: gain”
by showing favoritism to Epstein, who had been; ‘portrayed i in. the media as “this ‘big Democratic donor.” “Villataiia
recounted for OPR an exchange between-the USAO team,and a defense attorney who- argued in,one meeting that—

‘we were; prosecuting [Epstein] because; he was-Jewish. We then: pointed out'that
a:nuniber. of members:of [the USAO] ‘chain of command were; Jewish. Then, he
said, well we're prosceuting: him because he: was'.a ‘Democrat. And. againy we
pointed out that a numiber of us were Democrats. So then, it went to, we were
prosecuting‘him’because:he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so: well.
