and Villafana

On ‘the same: day that the: defense: team. sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr
and, Lefkowitz sent to Acosta two “independent, cthics opinions”—one authored, by prominent.
criminal, defense attorney and former U.S: Attorney Joe Whitley, which assessed ‘purported.
improprictics in. the federal investigation of Epstcin,. and.the other, by a ‘prominent retired. federal
judge:and former U.S. Attorney, arguing. against ‘the. NPA’s ‘usc ofthe civil damages recovery
provision.under [8'U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal. restitution.”

Days later, on’ December 11, 2007, Starr sent a. Icttcr'to Acosta ‘transmitting two lengthy.
submissions authored by Lefkowitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and,'to the
“background and conduct.of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments.previously
raised by the defense but: also asserted new issues. In onc:submission, 20 pages long, Lefkowitz
addressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities: inthe investigation, and criticized.
Villafafia for a number of alleged impropricties, ‘including having engaged.in, “unpreecdented,
federal overreaching” by: sccking to ‘prosecute Epstcin federally, “insist[ing]” that the State
Attorneys Office “charge Mr. Epstein. with, violations of law and recommend a sentenec that arc
Significantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate," and requiring that Epstcin plead

Lefkowitz also argued that: the federal investigation relied upon ‘a,state investigation. that:
was “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detcctive’s, misrepresentation. of key facts in. affidavits. and
interview summarics, leading the USAO to make its charging’ decision based on flawed
information that “compromised. the federal investigation.” Finally; ‘Lefkowitz criticized federal
‘involvement in the state’plea.process as a violation of “the'tenets of the Petite’Policy.” In a second,
13-page! submission, Lefkowitz reiterated Epstcin’s complaints about:the § 2255 component of the
NPA, arguing, among other ‘things, that fedéral prosecutors “should not. be if the business: of.
helping alleged victims of state crimes secure: civil financial. settlements.”
