are minimal. See United States v. Rojas-Contreras, 474 U.S. 231, 234 (1985) (no prejudice to
superseding indictment which changed the date of offense by ten days); United States v. Stringer,
730 F.3d 120, 128 (2d Cir. 2013) (not an abuse of discretion to deny continuance for a
superseding indictment that extended the conspiracy range by one month).

In this case, the changes to the indictment were anything but minimal. The conspiracy
was expanded from four years (without any specific actual dates within that range) to eleven
years (again, without any specificity), an additional seven years, and two new counts were added.
These were significant and substantial changes that require a continuance. The need to research
Ms. Maxwell’s whereabouts during a full eleven year period, not to mention comb the millions

and has resisted disclosure until after the filing of the second superseding indictment and on the
eve of trial.2, Many of the reports recently produced stem from the years 2006-2008.

? Consistent with the updated Fed. R. Crim. P. 5(f) and the Due Process Protections Act, Pub. L.
No 116-182, 134 Stat. 894 (Oct. 21, 2020), this Court on November 5, 2020, ordered that “The
Government shall disclose [Brady] information to the defense promptly after its existence
becomes known to the Government so that the defense may make effective use of the information
in the preparation of its case. See Dkt. 68 (emphasis supplied). The Government has not
explained why key witnesses statements, made to the government in 2019 and 2020, that Ms.
