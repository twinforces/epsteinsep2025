ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

No party has proposed redactions to the Court’s opinion on Maxwell’s motions to
suppress evidence or the documents ordered unsealed in the Court’s June 25, 2021 Order (Dkt.
No. 303). Thus, the Court lifts the temporary seal on its June 25, 2021 opinion on Maxwell’s
motions to suppress. It also unseals the April 9, 2019 memorandum decision and order on the
Government’s application to modify the protective order in Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 15-cv-7433,
as well as the transcripts of the March 26, 2019 and April 9, 2019 ex parte hearings on that
application, originally filed under seal as Exhibits D, E, F, and G to the memorandum of law in
support of Maxwell’s first motion to suppress (Dkt. No. 134). Maxwell shall file those exhibits
on the public docket without redaction by July 2, 2021.

SO ORDERED.
