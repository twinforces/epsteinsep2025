omitted)). The defendant has not and cannot establish that Epstein would have been available to
testify in the first instance, much less that he would have voluntarily agreed to testify at her trial
in a way that would help, rather than hurt, the defendant.

As to Epstein’s mother, who died in April 2004, the defendant contends that she “would
have testified that she did not observe Ms. Maxwell with any Accusers between 1994 and 1997.”
(Def. Mot. 7 at 9). “Counsel’s unsworn assertions as to vague generalities” that witnesses, “if
alive, would give testimony helpful to [the defendant] do not show that [the defendant’s] ability to
present a defense has been substantially and actually prejudiced.” United States v. Scala, 388 F.
Supp. 2d 396, 399-400 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). Here, “there is no evidence before the Court as to what
[the deceased witness] would have testified, much less specific evidence of how losing that
testimony has caused [the defendant] actual prejudice.” Jd. at 400. Further, unless Epstein’s
mother was with the defendant “every moment” between 1994 and 1997, “it would be impossible
for [her] to testify that [the] defendant did not commit the charged crimes, so whatever helpful
testimony [she] might have offered (the details of which are sparse in the motion) would be easily
undermined on cross-examination.” Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL 4043140, at *4 (citing Spears, 159
F.3d at 1081-1085). Moreover, Epstein’s mother died “sufficiently prior to ‘any realistic trial
date,’ to make it improbable that any prejudice it may have caused [the defendant] was the result
of government delay.” United States v. Cheung Kin Ping, 555 F.2d 1069, 1073 (2d Cir. 1977)
(quoting United States v. Stein, 456 F.2d 844, 848 (2d Cir. 1972)). Indeed, Epstein’s mother passed
away before the Palm Beach Police Department even began investigating Epstein in 2005. (Def.
Mot. 7, Ex. D at i).

The defendant’s claims relating to Michael Casey and Detective Recarey fare no better.
She again speculates that Casey and Detective Recarey, who passed away in August 2017 and May
