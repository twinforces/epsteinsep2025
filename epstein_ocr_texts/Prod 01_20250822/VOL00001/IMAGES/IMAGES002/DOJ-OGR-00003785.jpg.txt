Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document212 Filed 04/16/21 Page11of20

Second, the:government’s inevitable discovery: doctrine is far too:speculative. The
“typical application” of the:inevitable discovery doctrine is ‘when “the governiicnt sccks to.
invoke the doctrine on the basis of standardized, established procedures such as-those requiring:
inventory-searches.” Siokes, 733: F.3d -at-447. The government’s “inevitability. analysis. in this:
case,” however, “is predicated on an assessment of the actions that:might.have been taken by.
third-parties,” such as Judge Preska and the Miami Herald, who are “not acting at the behest of
the police.” Jd: “Such an analysis is inherently speculative.” Jd.

In fact, unlike ¢very other civil case in-the Souther District of New York against
Maxwell or Epstcin’s estate, the government.dcliberately chose not to intcrvenc in the. on-going.
unscaling process in Giiffre v: Maxwell. Inthe only other active SDNY case against Epstcin,
Doe v. Indyke, No. 20-cv-484-JLK, the government intervened and-moved to stay discovery,
saying that continued discovery-could threaten its‘case- against Maxwell.

By contrast, the government opted not to intervene and stay the unsealing in Giuffre v.
Maxwell. The reason is obvious. Legitimatcly conceriied about the propricty of its conduct in,
misleading Chicf Judge McMahon and issuing an. unconstittitionally overbroad.subpocna to
Boies Schiller, the government hoped to hedge its bets by allowing the-unsealing process to
unfold so it could-:make the inevitable discovery argument it now makes. This Court should not
condone such gamesmanship:'

Third, the govérnment’s-inevitable discovery atguienit is far too broad. Even’ the.
government admits that the vast:majority of material it obtained ‘from Boies Schiller is,not on the
Giuffre v.. Maxwell docket.and has not.been unsealed by Judge Preska. Resp. at 94. In fact, the
government’s response:appears to concede'that its inevitable discovery argument is limited to

"As theg government. recognizes, Judge Preska recognized: this: possibility; but deferred to this
Court 6n the question since it is presiding over'the criminal:case. Resp..at’94-n.41.
