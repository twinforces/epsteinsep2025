Incarceration.

year term of, imprisonment. Although: presented | to the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would.

the result that the defense continued to chip away at. it as the negotiations continued. The
contemporaneous. emails make 'no ‘mention of any rationale forthe decision. to, propose two years
as the g government’ s beginning negotiating position, and nobody with whom.OPR spoke was able:
to recall how’the decision.was made. As discussed. below; Acosta did offer OPR.an explanation,
but. OPR was unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it.’

Villafafia, Louric, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafafia:continued moving toward filing charges. ‘On.
July 19, 2007, the: day after reeciving Oosterbaan’s email supporting a potential prosecution,
Villafafia emailed Lourie and Menchel seeking approval, to take further ‘investigative’ steps
regarding z three of Epstein S assistants. ‘However, “Menehel, direeted Villafafia to “hold off: until
week.” Menchel told OPR that he. did: fot specifically. recall why! he: asked Willafafia to, wait, but
he:assumed it was because Acosta was deciding-what course of action to take:on the case:

On Monday, July 23,.2007, Menchel, submitted a resignation:notice to Acosta, ‘stating’ that;
he'would be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2007.7’
