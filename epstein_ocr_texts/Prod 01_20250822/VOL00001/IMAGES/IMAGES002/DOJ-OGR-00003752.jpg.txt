Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts - so not a new individual. The allegations made by Victoria
Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are not new and have
been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.

Each time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public figures and
world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschowitz is involved in having

sexual relations with her, which he denies.

Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as
they are defamatory.

Ghislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same.
Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British
press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old
defamatory claims.
