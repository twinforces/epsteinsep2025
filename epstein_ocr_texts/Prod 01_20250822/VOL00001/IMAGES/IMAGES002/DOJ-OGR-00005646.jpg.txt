witness encroaches upon the jury’s vital and exclusive function to make credibility
determinations and therefore does not ‘assist the trier of fact’ as required by Rule 702.”)
(citations omitted). Rocchio’s opinions on disclosure also contravene Rule 403 because they
suggest that delayed reporting of child sexual abuse is more consistent with truthfulness than
with fabrication, a determination which the jury must make for itself. Schneider, 2010 WL
3734055, at *6.

That leaves the second half of Rocchio’s disclosure opinion: that memory and disclosure
of traumatic or abusive events is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances
surrounding the trauma. This opinion is so generic as to be meaningless. It is also a matter of
common sense—how could anyone dispute that memory is “impacted by a number of factors”?
Moreover, Rocchio is not an expert in the human brain or memory generally. And her opinion
about when, why, and how alleged victims of sexual assault remember being assaulted suffers
from all the same flaws discussed above: Rocchio doesn’t point to any data or studies validating
her opinion; her opinions cannot be tested, reproduced, or meaningfully challenged; and her
opinion is based on the self-reports of her own clients, who she assumes are telling the truth.

II. Ata minimum, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing

For all these reasons, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying in this case. At

the very least, this Court should hold a Daubert to evaluate each of her proposed opinions.
CONCLUSION

This Court should exclude Rocchio’s proposed testimony or, in the alternative, hold a
Daubert hearing.
