EXAMINATION BY

MS. McCAWLEY :

Qe. Good morning. I'm going to explain

respect, to depositions.

Have you ever been deposed before?
Ae I have not.

Q. What is going to happen here, we

have a court reporter and a videographer.

What, they do is take down the words that we
say so when I ask you a question they will
record what you say in response to that. So
we have, to be mindful that in order for them
to do their job we can't. talk over each
other.

Another issue you have to be weary
