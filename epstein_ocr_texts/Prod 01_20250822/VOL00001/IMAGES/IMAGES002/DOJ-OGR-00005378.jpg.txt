Consistent with the Court's Order of today (Dkt. 368), counsel for Ms. Maxwell will file
this Response together with her other pleadings regarding in limine issues on the public docket
with any proposed redactions and a joint letter justifying any such redactions on or before

Respectfully Submitted,
