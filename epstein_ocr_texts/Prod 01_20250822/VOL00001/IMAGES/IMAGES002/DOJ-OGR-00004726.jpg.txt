time the defendant, was indicted in July 2020 or at the time Jeffrey. Epstein, was indicted in 2019.
Specifically, although. Minor Victini-4 had ‘previously becn interviewed once if or about. 2007 in
connection with..a prior investigation conducted by the: USAO-SDFL, Minor ‘Victim-4 did not.
agree to be interviewed ‘by the prosecution, team ‘handling this case until, July 2020. The
Govérnment ‘then conducted ‘two preliminary interviews with. Minor Victim-4 ‘by’ video
teleconference in the summer of 2020. Because of the difficult, nature of the interview topics,
however, the Government. was not; able to, fully'debrief Minor Victim=4 over video. Due to'travel
constraints and safety concernsarising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government was:unable
to travel to meetwith Minor Victim-4 until late January 2021, at which, time the Government
conducted, multiple in-person interviews ‘with Minor Victim-4. The Government. then took
additional investigative steps and sought the $2 Indictment in late March 2021, approximately two
months after concluding its debricfing of Minor Victim-4..

Simply put, the $2 Indictment was brought in a ‘timely manner ‘upon. the Governiment’s
collection, of evidence to support the additional charges. Any‘suggestion, that the Government:
intentionally delayed obtaining the S2 Indictment to gain. some ‘strategic advantage has no basis in.
fact. The defendant has not. established—and ‘cannot establish—an ‘undue delay,,much less an.
‘intentional and deliberate delay:caused by the Government for an improper purpose.

Finally, the defendant. again asks the Court to “defer considcration of this motion until
trial.” (Def? Mot. -at.22). The Court should again. reject the defendant’s invitation to defer ruling
on this motion. See.Apr. Op. at 1.8 (denying motion, but allowing renewal of motion if the “‘factual,
record at'trial shows otherwise”); s¢e-also United Statés ¥..Muric, No. 10 Cr. 112 (LTS), 20.1.0 WL
