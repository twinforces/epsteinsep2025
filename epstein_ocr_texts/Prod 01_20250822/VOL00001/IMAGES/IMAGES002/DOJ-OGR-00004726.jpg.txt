time the defendant was indicted in July 2020 or at the time Jeffrey Epstein was indicted in 2019.
Specifically, although Minor Victim-4 had previously been interviewed once in or about 2007 in
connection with a prior investigation conducted by the USAO-SDFL, Minor Victim-4 did not
agree to be interviewed by the prosecution team handling this case until July 2020. The
Government then conducted two preliminary interviews with Minor Victim-4 by video
teleconference in the summer of 2020. Because of the difficult nature of the interview topics,
however, the Government was not able to fully debrief Minor Victim-4 over video. Due to travel
constraints and safety concerns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government was unable
to travel to meet with Minor Victim-4 until late January 2021, at which time the Government
conducted multiple in-person interviews with Minor Victim-4. The Government then took
additional investigative steps and sought the S2 Indictment in late March 2021, approximately two
months after concluding its debriefing of Minor Victim-4.

Simply put, the S2 Indictment was brought in a timely manner upon the Government’s
collection of evidence to support the additional charges. Any suggestion that the Government
intentionally delayed obtaining the S2 Indictment to gain some strategic advantage has no basis in
fact. The defendant has not established—and cannot establish—an undue delay, much less an
intentional and deliberate delay caused by the Government for an improper purpose.

Finally, the defendant again asks the Court to “defer consideration of this motion until
trial.” (Def. Mot. at 22). The Court should again reject the defendant’s invitation to defer ruling
on this motion. See Apr. Op. at 18 (denying motion but allowing renewal of motion if the “factual
record at trial shows otherwise’); see also United States v. Muric, No. 10 Cr. 112 (LTS), 2010 WL
2891178, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 13, 2010) (“The motion to dismiss the Indictment as the result of
pre-indictment delay is therefore denied, without prejudice to appropriately supported later motion
