was a. protective order that would govern at least some of the materials, and. that. is why we
ultimately made the application to the Court?’)).

While the Government appreciates, with. the benefit of hindsight, that an answer that had.
also referenced the February 20:16 meeting (and the.fact that USAO-SDNY. took (no action, as a.
resultof that:meeting) would have provided.additional.context—and would have further rcinforeed
accurately’ described its contacts ‘with Boies Schiller as relevant. to “your investigation” and. the
issuance ‘of the subpoena at hand. Indced, there:is no :reason. to believe that.a description of the:
February 2016 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon’s analysis of whether
shé was facing a “Chemical Bank kind of situation.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex.E at 2).

In. Chemical Bank, counsel for.a.civil party approached the.Manhattan District Attorney’s
Office “suggesting that it had, evidence of:criminal. violations relating’ to'the case.” 1'54.F.R.D..at:
93. In.response, a, grand jury subpoena was issued and “confidential documents were produced by’
the defendant.without complying with any of the specific procedures or exceptions provided in the
[confidentiality] orders.” /d. Here, by contrast, the Government: accurately’ conveyed, to Chief
Judge McMahon-the opening of its investigation in late 2018, the reason it‘made contact with Boics
Schiller shortly thereafter and served. a subpoena in February 2019, and that no documents
governed by’ the protective order had yet been produced. Aside from rank speculation looscly’
premised..on an anonymously sourced. news:report, the defendant offers nothing to support her
‘assertion that “Boies Schiller was ins(rumental in:fomenting the Maxwell prosecution” (Def. Mot.
3.at 2) (emphasis. in original), or that AUSA-1’s February 2016 mecting with Boics Schiller (a8 :it.
actually’ occurred) undercut: the accuracy: of the: Gevernment’s representations to: Chicf Judge

MeMahon, or played.any role in the Government: opening ‘its investigation. in November 2018.
