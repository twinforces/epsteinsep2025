modification of the Protective Order in an,ex parte hearing (chock full‘of misrepresentations):
without first‘providing Maxwell notice and an opportunity. to be heard. Mot. No: 11, at 11-15.
The goverment offers no response to this ‘fundamental point—Martindell demands.notice and
an. opportunity to be heard; ‘Maxwell received neither. Resp. at‘76—811.

Now, in an audacious request, the government.argties this Court cannot evaluate the
propricty of Chicf Judge McMahon’s analysis of Martindell, because Judge McMahon. is a. co-
equal jtidge' who exercised her sound discretion. Resp. at 81 & n.37. Were the government’s
unsupported argument correct, though, it would mean that Maxwell will never have an
opportunity to ‘challenge the subpoena under Martindell, as that.case and duc process :require.
The government is.not right.

This Court does not owe deference to Judge McMahon’s decision, for at least three
reasons. First, Maxwell never was given. the chance to, oppose the governm ent’s request, so due:
process demands that she be. given that chance now. Second, Chief Judge McMahon. did not
possess all the-rclevant facts because the government: improperly concealed them from her. To
thecontrary;.the government misled Judge McMahon about its contacis with Boies Schiller and
the-originis of its:investigation, facts that were central to Judge McMahon's decision to modify
the Protective Order and authorize the subpoena. Mot. No. 3 & Reply in Support:Thereof: Third,
this Court is not tasked‘with deciding whether the Protective Order. should be modified or even
“questioning the correctness of Judge McMahon’s modification, This Gourtis deciding a ‘different:
question entirecly—whether the government’s violation of Martindell.rcquircs suppression.

As to remedy, the govemment:says thatno case addresses whether suppression is proper

for:a Martindell violation. Fair enough. Resp..at 8 L.
