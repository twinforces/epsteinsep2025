various itcrations ‘of the victims’ rights legislation.”*** Villafafia explained. to OPR her reference:
to'the victims:

[M]¥ concern was. that [Menchel] was ‘violatitig the CV.RA. which
requires the. attorneys for'the g government, which[] includes mel, i to
to keep’ the victims apprised of what’s S. - happening with the. case. So
in essence; I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to
allegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in ‘these
plea negotiations: without. letting us know: about it.?°

In. his reply to Villafafia’s cmail, and after noting ‘that he found her email, “totally.
inappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental. policy, and he noted that:
“[a]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person. designated by the U.S. Attorney to exercise
appropriate discretion. in deciding whether certain pleas. are appropriate and :consistent with”
Departmental policy. Perceiving | Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism, of her judgment, “Villafatia.
responded, “[RJaising concerns about the forgotten voices of victims ‘in, this case should. not. be
classified as alapse’in judgment” and that her“‘first and only concern ‘in this case; ... is the victims.”

Menchel told OPR ‘that he did not. view his :conversation with Sanchez. as. a plea. offer,
asserted that he ‘was: not: obligated to consult: with, -victims during ‘preliminary settlement:

very day that. Villafafia criticized him. for engaging in scttlcment. negotiations without. consulting,
her, the FBI, or the'victims, Villafafia. had hersclf sent an.cmail to Sanchez offering “to discuss the
possibility of a federal, resolution. of Mr. ‘Epstcin’s case that.could run concurrently with, any'state

resolution,” without having spoken to, the victims about. her proposal. °*”

286. As discussed; the Department’s position atthe time was that the CVRA did not;apply ‘before charges were

filed against a defendant.
