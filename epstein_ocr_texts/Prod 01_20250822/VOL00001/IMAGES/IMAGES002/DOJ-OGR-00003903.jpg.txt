Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 224 Filed 04/20/21 Page 6of17

A. ‘The Counts are Dissimilar and Illogically and Artificially Connected.

The government'claims that the.Perjury Counts are properly joined because they are
“logical ly connected” to the: Mann Act Counts and part of the’ same “common plan. or scheme.”
Resp.-at 138, 141,143. No logic can.be gleaned from:the government’s response. Offenses are
or “connected” or part:of'a “common scheme or plan” if the counts “grow out of related
transactions.” Unitéd States v: Randazzo, 80 F.3d.623, 627 (1st:Cir. 1996).

Here, the Perjury‘Counts did not “grow out of” the conduct underlying the Mann Act
Counts. Ms. Maxwell’s depositions occurred.in. 2016, twenty years after the conduct alleged in.
the:Mann: Act Counts purportedly occurred from.1994-1997. Furthermore, the allegations
underlying the two sets of counts are unrelated. ‘The “scheme” alleged.in the Indictment is the:
alleged enticement of three females. to travel for the ptitpose of engaging :in illegal sex acts
between 1994 and 1997. The depositions at the heart: of the Perjury:'Counts concerned the truth or
falsity-of Virginia Giuffre’s “obvious lics” about being sexually trafficked to famous:people and
been sexually trafficked by Epstein or Ms. Maxwell to anyone, let alone any famous people.

And the defamation.case had nothing’ to do:with any allegations by Ms. Giuffre of being enticed
to travel to engage in-illegal sex: acts. How Ms: Maxwell’s answers to questions in 2016 about
the falsity of Ms. Giuffre’s sex trafficking claims. (ycars-after the allegations in the Indictment)

are related to the conspiracies alleged in the Indictment is.therefore a mystery."

‘There is also-no evidence that Ms. Maxwell and.Lpstein.conspired or agreed to lic inthe
defamation case. Afier Ms. Maxwell.compelled Epstein to: sit: fora deposition in’ the defamation-action, he
-asserted his right against self-incrimination. and.dceclinied (6.answer any questions. Ms. Maxwell, having:
committed no crime and.not being: a part of any Conspiracy with Epstein, chose (6 answer qticstions:
truthfully. No charges were‘pending against cither Epstcin,or Ms. Maxwell:at the'time of the depositions.
and there was no relationship.between the two individuals.
