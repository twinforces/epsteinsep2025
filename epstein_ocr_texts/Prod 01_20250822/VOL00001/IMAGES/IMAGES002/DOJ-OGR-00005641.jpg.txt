B.. Opinion 2: The relationship of trust and. attachment between an alleged
perpetrator and alleged victim prevents victims from being aware. that
what they are experiencing is abuse ‘and can, prevent disclosure.

Rocchio’s second. opinion—that the relationship ‘of trust and attachment between an
alleged, perpetrator and alleged victim. prevents victims from being aware that, what. they are
experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure—has several ‘flaws that.render it inddmissible.

First, the opinion:is unreliable, because it-is, in reality, an opinion. about grooming
disguised,as an, opinion ‘about delayed, disclosure: In, Rocchio’s view, alleged. victims delay or fail
to disclose alleged abuse because they were groomed. But. because, Roechio’s.proposed
grooming testimony is unreliable, not helpful to the:trier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial (for all.
the reasons given above, sipra, Part, 1.a=1.c), so too is this opinion unreliable, ‘not helpful to the
trier of fact, and unfairly prejudicial.

To reiterate, Rocchio’s opinions are based on, herpersonal experience as a treatment
‘provider. She assumes her'clients are telling the truth, and. her clicnts are a sclf-sclected. group of
alleged. victims. Rocchio cannot cite an error rate forher conclusions, nor can. she: say-how
representative her patients are of those, who:suffer sexual abuse. See./:-F.O0.C., 20.0 WL.
3466370, at *14 (cxclusion of an expert is required where the expert:makes “no cffort to ensure
that the materials he reviewed. were representative”). 'Her-conclusions cannot be tested or
verified, and they are “virtually ‘impregnable for purposes, of cross-cxamination.” Gonyer, 2012
WL 3043020, at *2.

Second, Rocchio apparently has no experience treating alleged perpetrators. ‘So her view
entircly one-sided. See Schneider, 201.0 WL 3734055, at *2-3. The second opinion-Rocchio

proposes to offer is, outside ‘her expertise.
