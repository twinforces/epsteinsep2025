The ‘only exception is United States v. Nader, 425 F. Supp. 34.619 (E.D. Va. 2019). In

Nader, the court:performed a.Landgraf analysis in.analyzing the retroactivity of the 2003
Amendment, and it appears to be the:onZy previous case in:which.Congress’ ‘explicit rejection of
a.retroactivity’ provision. in the 2003 Amendment has even been:mentioned. In.Nader, however,
the court noted the legislative, history’ of the 2003 Amendinent but héld that only'the, ‘exvrof the
amendment was relevant to step one of Landgraf: 425 F. Supp. 3d at 627 (finding legislative.
