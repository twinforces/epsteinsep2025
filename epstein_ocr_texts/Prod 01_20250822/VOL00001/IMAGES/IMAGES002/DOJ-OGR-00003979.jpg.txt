Regardless, the government has failed to produce, or even look for these communications
and Ms. Maxwell has no other means to obtain them.

Requests 6 and 7

Requests 6 and 7 request the engagement agreements between BSF and alleged victim 2
and her sister. BSF has previously claimed that it represented these individuals. Farmer v.
Indyke, No. 19-cv-10475 (LGS-DCF); Farmer v. Indyke, 19-cv-10474-NRP. The scope and dates
of these engagements are relevant to Ms. Maxwell’s pending motions and are relevant and
admissible for many of the reasons articulated with respect to Requests 1-5. Moreover, these
agreements are exculpatory evidence that, as discussed below in connection with Request 12, are
procurable in advance of trial.

Request 8

Request 8 seeks the grand jury subpoena the government served on BSF. This is hardly a
controversial, sensitive or speculative item. It is however relevant to Ms. Maxwell’s pending
motions to suppress because it is the document reviewed by Judge McMahon commanding
production of the entire BSF file including confidential materials subject to a strict protective
order in Giuffre. The subpoena is admissible either as part of the written motion practice or in a
hearing on the motions to suppress. Indeed, the Court could take judicial notice of the document
which is in the SDNY court files. Ms. Maxwell would then be the only party to the motion
practice that was in the dark about the content of the subpoena. What the subpoena commands,
when it was served, and who accepted service are all relevant to the issues before the Court.
BSF’s only retort is that Ms. Maxwell should get the subpoena from the government. Ms.
Maxwell asked the government for the subpoena and the government refused this request. She
has no other recourse but to ask this Court for assistance.
