mother that he would write down the name of the pills and provide them that information,
but he acknowledged that he never actually did so. After the interview—and without being

to be Benadryl.

In February 2005, then-District Attorney Castor reviewed Constand’s interviews
and Cosby’s written answers in order to assess the viability of a prosecution of Cosby.
