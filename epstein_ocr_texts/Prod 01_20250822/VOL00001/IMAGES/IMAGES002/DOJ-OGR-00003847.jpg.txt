Re: United States Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Joint Letter Concerning Redactions:to Omnibus Response & Exhibit. 11.

Dear Judge Nathan:

Pursuarit.to this Court’s Order of March.29, 202.1 (Dkt. No. 189), the parties
respectfully submit this joint. letter concerning redactions to the Omnibus Memorandum. in
Opposition, to’ the Defendant’s Pre-Trial ‘Motions (““Response’”’).

Joint Position

The partics no longer seck, the proposed redactions to: pages 1/18 and 119 of the
government’s Response.

Ms. Maxwell’s Position.

Ms. Maxwell seeks to redact from, pages 129-134 of the Response and from Exhibit ‘1 ]
only those portions of her July 22, 2016 deposition as to which Judge Preska:ruled:

public :access:to [these] parts of the transcript.is outweighed by Ms. Maxwell's
countervailing interests in:resisting disclosure of the details of her private,
intimate relationships with consenting adults. This'testimony is, in. any case, far
aficld. fromthe sex.trafficking and scxual.abusc allegations that were. central to’
the dispute in Giuffre v. Maxwell. Although the prurient interest of some may
be left unsatiatéd as a ‘result, Ms. Maxwell's interest in kecping-private the
details of her sexual. relationships with consenting adults warrants the scaling:
of those portions of her testimony (and any materials that, reference them).
