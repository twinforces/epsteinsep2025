Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 237 of 239

The result is the same even if the defendant’s preferred relevant jury pool is used. The
White Plains Qualified Wheel is comprised of 8.76% Black or African-American persons and
10.48% Latino or Hispanic persons. (/d. at § 17; see also Martin Aff. at § 55). This results in
absolute disparities of 3.69% and 3.64%, respectively. These figures are also comfortably within
the range that the Second Circuit has determined does not satisfy the second prong of the Duren
test. Moreover, as discussed below, the factors that cause the disparity between the White Plains
Qualified Wheel and the White Plains Master Jury Wheel, as well as the voting age population,
are not the result of systematic exclusion.

It is only by employing an apples-and-oranges method of comparing the White Plains
Qualified Wheel to the jury eligible populations of the “Manhattan Division” or the entire Southern
District that the defendant is able to identify disparities that might arguably satisfy the second
prong of Duren. Because that method has no basis in the law, the defendant’s claim fails at the
second prong.

b. Any Potential Underrepresentation Is Not Due to Systematic
Exclusion

Even assuming the defendant had satisfied the second prong of the Duren test—which she
has not—she most certainly has not demonstrated that any underrepresentation is “due to
systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.” Rioux, 97 F.3d at 654 (emphasis
added). That is, she cannot establish that the exclusion is the product of “the system of jury
selection itself, rather than external forces.” Id. at 658 (emphasis added). She therefore cannot
satisfy the third prong of Duren.

As then-District Judge Bianco explained, “systematic exclusion does not occur simply
because a facially neutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular group.”
