The result is the same even if the defendant’s preferred, relevant jury pool is used. The
White Plains ‘Qualified. Wheel is comprised of 8.76% Black or African-American. persons and.
10.48% Latino or ‘Hispanic persons. (/d. at 4 17; see.also Martin. Aff. at. 4 55). ‘This results in.
absolute: disparities: of 3.69% and 3.64%, respectively. ‘These figures are also comfortably within,
the range that ‘the. Sceond Circuit has determined docs not satisfy ‘the. second prong of the, Dien
test. Moreover, as discussed below, the factors that.cause the disparity between the: White: Plains
Qualified, Wheel, and the White Plains Master Jury’ Wheel, as well as the voting age :population,
are not the result of systematic exclusion.

It is only’ by ‘cmploying an, apples-and-oranges method of comparing the White’ Plains
Qualified Wheel 'to'the jury éligible populations of the ‘Manhattan Division” orthe entire Southern
District. that the defendant is able to identify disparities that might arguably satisfy the second.
prong of Duren. Because that method has no basis in. the law, the defendant’s claim’ fails. at the
second prong.

b. Any Potential Underrepresentation Is Not, Due to Systematic
Exclusion

Even assuming the defendant had satisficd.the, second. prong. of the Diem test—which she
has not—she most. ‘certainly ‘has not demonstrated that. any ‘underrepresentation, is “duc to
systematic exélision, of the group in the. jurv-seléction. proéess.” Riotix, 97. F.3d at,654 (emphasis
added). That’ is, she ‘cannot’ establish that ‘the. exclusion is, 'the. ‘product of “the, system, of. jury
satisfy the third:prong of Diiren.

As then-District Judge: Bianco explained, “systematic. exclusion ‘does not occur. simply.

because-a, facially neutral disqualification criterion disproportionately impacts a particular ‘group.
