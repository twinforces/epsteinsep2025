Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 310-1 Filed 07/02/21 Page 48 of 80
Il. Issues:

On June 23, 2020, this Court granted Cosby’s petition for allowance of appeal,
limited to the following two issues:

(1) Where allegations of uncharged misconduct involving sexual contact

with five women (and a de facto sixth) and the use of Quaaludes were

admitted at trial through the women’s live testimony and [Cosby’s] civil

deposition testimony despite: (a) being unduly remote in time in that the
allegations were more than fifteen years old and, in some instances, dated

back to the 1970s; (b) lacking any striking similarities or close factual nexus

to the conduct for which [Cosby] was on trial; (c) being unduly prejudicial;

(d) being not actually probative of the crimes for which [Cosby] was on trial;

and (e) constituting nothing but improper propensity evidence, did the Panel

err in affirming the admission of this evidence?

(2) Where: (a) [District Attorney Castor] agreed that [Cosby] would not be

prosecuted in order to force [Cosby’s] testimony at a deposition in

[Constand’s] civil action; (b) [the district attorney] issued a formal public

statement reflecting that agreement; and (c) [Cosby] reasonably relied upon

those oral and written statements by providing deposition testimony in the

civil action, thus forfeiting his constitutional right against self-incrimination,

did the Panel err in affirming the trial court’s decision to allow not only the

prosecution of [Cosby] but the admission of [Cosby’s] civil deposition

testimony?
Commonwealth v. Cosby, 236 A.3d 1045 (Pa. 2020) (per curiam).2°
lll. Analysis

We begin with Cosby’s second listed issue, because, if he is correct that the
Commonwealth was precluded from prosecuting him, then the question of whether the
prior bad act testimony satisfied Rule 404(b) will become moot.

On February 17, 2005, then-District Attorney Castor announced to the public, on
behalf of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, that he would not prosecute Cosby for any
offense related to the 2004 sexual abuse that Constand alleged. Constand’s potential
20 In his petition, Cosby also sought this Court’s review of his claim of improper juror
bias and his challenge to the constitutionality of SORNA. We denied allocatur as to those
two claims.
