Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document.204 Filed. 04/16/21. Page 44 of 239

Government’s ‘promises in the plea agreement to only cover ‘past crimes, observing that “not.
limiting the‘prohibition.to-past crimes would make it absurd.and probably illegal”) (citing Aronson
v.K. Arakelian, Inc., 154 F.2d 231,233 (7th. Cir. 1946) (“[A] contract. will not be presumed. to
have: imposed, an, absurd. or impossible condition, on, one of. the partics, but will, be interpreted, as
the partics. must be supposed.to have understood the conditions. atthe time.”)).

Mot. | at 26 n.4). Notso. The NPA lists specific statutory provisions within the Mann.Act, but.
none of the provisions: contained in the Indictment. In particular, the NPA ‘expressly covers
violations of 18°U.S.C. §§ 2422(b), 2423(b),:and, 2423(c), but it ‘does not include the particular
‘provisions charged in. the Indictment against, Maxwell, which.alleges violations of §§ 2422(a). and,
2423(a). These:are:plainly:not the same crimes, and.a:plea. agreement cannot be:read:to immunize
‘unnamed. crimes in;the gencral. ballpark of the specific crimes enumerated, in the agreement. The
defendant:cites ‘no authority that supports her overbroad reading of this provision.

Accordingly, the NPA, immunizes' ‘only certain, specific offenses, none of which are
contained in the Indictment. Avs a result, the defendant cannot invoke the NPA to seck the dismissal
‘of the Indictment.

2. The NPA. Does Not:Confer Enforceable Rights.on Maxwell

Even if this Court were to construc the: NPA beyond its plain terms to;preclude: prosecutions
for. the: crimes contained. in the Indictment, the defendant has .established. neither that those
protections.cxtend to Maxwell specifically, nor that she has standing to‘pursuc those’protections.

The defendant asks, this, Court to interpret the NPA, aecording to contract principles, and
accord.the defendant standing to enforce the NPA.as a third party ‘beneficiary, Asa general matter,

plea agreements are interpreted using principles from, contract law, but that maxim ‘is not; without.
