An entirely different situation arises when the decision not to prosecute is
unconditional, is presented as absolute and final, or is announced in such a way that it
induces the defendant to actin reliance thereupon. When a non-prosecution decision is
conveyed in such a way, and ‘when a defendant, having no indication to the contrary,

prosecution. Numerous state and federal courts have found ‘that a defendant's
detrimental reliance upon the government’s.assurances during the plea bargaining phase
both implicates his dué process rights: and entitles him to enforcement even of

unconsummated agreements. The. cases are legion.*°
