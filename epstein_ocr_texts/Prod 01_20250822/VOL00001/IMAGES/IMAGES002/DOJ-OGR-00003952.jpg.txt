as scheduled, and has already planned to be available to testify at trial as scheduled this summer,
despite her personal and professional obligations. These views further weigh against an
adjournment of the July 12, 2021 trial date.

Finally, although the Government maintains that an adjournment is not warranted here, if
the Court nevertheless adjourns trial, the Government respectfully requests that the new trial date
be scheduled for March 2022. Were the trial to be scheduled for any date between September
2021 and February 2022, one or more of the undersigned prosecutors, including prosecutors who
have been on this case for multiple years, would be unable to participate in the trial given pre-
existing trial commitments,’ among other reasons. Given the complexities in this case, including
a large volume of discovery, litigation history involving numerous legal and factual issues, years
of investigation, and relationships with the victims, continuity of Government counsel at trial is a
particularly compelling interest here. Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that,
should an adjournment be granted, any new trial date be set for March 2022.

Respectfully submitted,

AUDREY STRAUSS
