despite her personal and professional obligations. These views further weigh, against an
adjournment of the July. 12, 2021 trial date.

Finally, although. the Government maintains that an.adjournment is not warranted here, if
the Court nevertheless adjourns trial, the Government respectfully ‘requests that;the new trial date:
be scheduled ‘for March, 2022. ‘Were the trial. to be scheduled ‘for any date, between, September
20211 and February 2022, one:or-more of the undersigned prosecutors, including’ prosecutors who
have been. on, this case for ‘multiple ‘years, would, be unable to ‘participate ‘in, the trial given pre=
existing trial ‘commitments, among other reasons. ‘Given the complexitics in-this :casc, ‘including:
a.large volume of discovery, litigation history ‘involving numerous Icgal, and. factual issues, ycars
of investigation, and relationships with the'victims, continuity of Government counsel at, trial isa
particularly compelling interest here. Accordingly, the Government.respectfully requests that,
should.an adjournment be granted, any new trial, date’be, set: for March 2022.
