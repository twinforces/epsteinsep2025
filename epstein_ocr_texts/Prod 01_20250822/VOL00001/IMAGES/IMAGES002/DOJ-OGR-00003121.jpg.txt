Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 187 of 239
Murgio, 209 F. Supp. 3d at 724 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting United States v. Smith,
985 F. Supp. 2d 547, 610 (S.D.N.Y. 2014)).

In setting forth allegations in an indictment, the Government is not limited to description
of only the bare elements of a crime; rather, an indictment may be used to provide background to
the charged criminal conduct, to describe the circumstances, means, and methods of an offense,
and to describe evidence that is otherwise admissible at trial. Simply put, “[s]tatements providing
background are relevant and need not be struck.” United States v. Mostafa, 965 F. Supp. 2d 451,
466 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citing Mulder, 273 F.3d at 100). Allegations also will not be stricken where
they elucidate the circumstances, means, and methods of a charged scheme or would be admissible,
in the alternative, under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. See United States v.
Hernandez, 85 F.3d 1023, 1030 (2d Cir. 1996) (affirming denial of motion to strike surplusage
where “[d]Jefendants’ cocaine-related activity was clearly relevant evidence of the organizational
structure and method of operation of their heroin conspiracy, and it also tended to establish the
nature of the relationship between Defendants and their supplier of heroin, defendant Jose Antonio
Hernandez,” and citing Rule 404(b)).

In terms of timing, “[c]ourts in this district routinely await presentation of the
Government’s evidence at trial before ruling on a motion to strike.” Mostafa, 965 F. Supp. 2d at
467 (citing, inter alia, Scarpa, 913 F.2d at 1012); see also United States v. Ahmed, No. 10 Cr. 131
(PKC), 2011 WL 5041456, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 21, 2011). As multiple courts have concluded,
““t]here is little or no purpose in attempting to predict in advance of trial what evidence will prove
admissible or how specific allegations relate to the overall charges.’” Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d at
612 (brackets in original) (quoting United States v. Butler, 351 F. Supp. 121, 124 (S.D.N.Y. 2004)).
