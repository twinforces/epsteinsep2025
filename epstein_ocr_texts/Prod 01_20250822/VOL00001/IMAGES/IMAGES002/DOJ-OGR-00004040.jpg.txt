explained that itvorder to require. production prior totrial, the moving:party must show: (1) that
in advance of trial by exercise of due diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for
trial without such-production and. inspection in-advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such
‘inspection:may tend unreasonably to delay the trial; and. (4) that the application, is made’ in ‘good
faith and is not intended as a general ‘fishing cxpedition.’” Jd. at.698—700. To clear'that hurdle,
the Court considers (1) relevancy, (2) admissibility; and.(3) specificity. /d. at.700.
