has attempted to join. Ms. Villafana’s response was that she was unaware of anysuch

investigation.

Plaintiff also: secms ‘to be claiming that she:is part of this alleged investigation and,.asa
consequence, has inappropriatcly attempted .to. claim a non-existent “investigalive privilege”
which has been replaced by her equally inappropriate “public intcrest privilege.” Issucs related
to:Plaintiff's ongoing failures to produce discovery;-including her specious claims of privilege:

According to Plaintiff, Ms. Maxwell “cannot show any significant reason for needing”
theinformation. This is, again, a:meritless argument which ignores the fact that Ms: Maxwell is
entitled to the information under the rules of discovery. And, the “need” for the information is
both obvious and necessary for at, least’three reasons: ‘first, any communications between
Plaintiff, her lawyers and law enforcement ate likely inconsistent with. statements Plaintiff has.
made to the media; second, the statements will reflect Plaintiff s:motive-and bias in bringing this
litigation; and third, knowing the information will allow Ms. Maxwell to access the impact on
any 5" Amendment privilege. Plaintiff, at this point, should be either required to provide the
information or accept-a'stay in the proceedin gs as. a consequence of her failure to comply with
hét-discovery obligations. Sle should not be allowed to brandish this, likely nonexistetit, sword
but deny Ms. Maxwell the opportunity to adequately prepare for her deposition and other
discovery matters. Accordingly, in the event that the Plaintiff.continues to fail to reveal the:
information that she claims to have regarding some “ongoing criminal investigation,” Ms,

Maxwell moves to'stay these proceedings.
