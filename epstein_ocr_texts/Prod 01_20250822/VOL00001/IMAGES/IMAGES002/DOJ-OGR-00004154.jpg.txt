Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 285 Filed 05/20/21 Page 19 of 34

For one thing, the government-admits:that:Giuffre’s attorneys turned over several
documents in 201.6, which were in the government’s possession when AUSA[~__] claimed
to. Judge McMahon that he did not know what was:in Boies Schiller’s file. Moreover, by: the time
AUSA[_______] told Judge: McMahon. that, for all -he knew, the deposition.transcripts would
Show “page after. page of people taking the Fifth,” it was already a-matter. ofpublic record that
Maxwell, had been deposed and:that. she had not invoked the Fifth Amendment. Ex..Q, p 1.

The government’s argument also, defics logic. The government was asking Judge
McMahon to authorize a subpoena.of Boies Schiller’s entire: file. At a:minimum, the government
had to have.asked Boies Schiller about-the size of the file and. issues related, to privilege to
determine, if Boies Schiller would contest the subpoena or'notify cither the civil court or
Maxwell when the subpoena:was issued and.-responsive: documents produced, In. fact, the
government: issued fo subpoenas to Boies Schiller: the ‘first’ for'material, covered by the.
Protective Order, and the sécond:for material outside the Protective Order’s:reach. Clearly, the
government.knew more, about Boies Schiller’s file than AUSA[—___] let on.

o Defense 6: The “subject.of your investigation” to whom. Judge McMahon

According to the government, when. Judge McMahon asked AUSA[—_] “about

‘issuance ofthe subpoena on the subject of your investigation,” Mot. Ex. E, p.2,. Judge McMahon
was referring only:to Epstein. Resp. at'7.1. This:is not a plausible:reading of the transcript.

After ‘his first appearance before her, Judge;MeMahon haled AUSA [7] back to

court for'orie reason. “I'l be very"up-front“with you,” she said. Mot. Ex. E,'p 2.
