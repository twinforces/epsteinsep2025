an. illegal sex act, in ‘violation. of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a). Sce Indictment:44 15-17. In other words,
Count One and.Count Three charge the: defendant with agreeing to commit two separate and.
distinct federal crimes.

B. Applicable Law:

The Double Jeopardy ‘Clause: of the Fifth Amendment to: the Constitution “protects against:
multiple‘punishments for the same offense.” North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 U.S. 71.1, 717 (1969).
Accordingly, ‘a defendant cannot be sentenced for. multiplicitous charges: covering the same crime.
“An indictment is multiplicitous when it charges.a single offense as an offense multiple times, in
separate counts, when, in law and fact, only one crimic has been committed” United States v.

Although, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not protect against 'simultancous prosceutions for the
same offense; a defendant docs have a right not to be ‘punished twice; for the same crime. United
States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir. 2006) (per curiam). Accordingly, “[i]f the jury:
convicts on more than one multiplicitous count, the defendant’s ‘right not, to suffer multiple
‘punishments for the same offense will be protected by having the Court enter judgment on. only’
‘one of the multiplicitous counts.” Jd. Similarly, where the judgment of conviction. has already

one. count. Jd.

The Second Circuit has clarified that‘District Courts should not rule on a motion to dismiss

a charge on ‘multiplicity grounds until the time of sentencing. Sée id. (vacating’ district court’s
