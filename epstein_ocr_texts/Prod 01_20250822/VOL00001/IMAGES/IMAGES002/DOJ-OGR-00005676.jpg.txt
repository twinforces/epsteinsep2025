should:not be admitted as evidence of the conspiracies. See Cummings, 60 F. Supp. 3d at 437
(quoting Bagari@, 706 F.2d at 64); see also, United States v.. Benissi, 216 E. Supp. 2d 299, 311
(S.D.N.Y. 2002), aff'd sub nom. United States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 608 (2d Cir. 2003) (the:
“scope of the conspiratorial, agreement” is the key to determining whether “‘an, overt act may
properly be regarded as in furtherance of the conspiracy” (quoting Grunewald v. United States,
353 U.S. 391, 397 (1957)).

In its opposition to Ms. Maxwell’s motion to strike, the government argued. that. because ’a,
conspiracy “does not require-a. completed substantive crime,” Accuser-3’s. allegations could still
be admitted as direet;proof of the charged conspiracies even though, she did not travel, as.a, minor
or engage iin illegal sex acts because Ms. Maxwell allegedly “groomed” her'to engage in’those
sex acts. Gov’t.Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Pretrial. Motions (Dkt. 204) at 161-163 (citing Salinas v.
United. States, 522, U.S. 52,.65 (1.997)). That argument misses the mark. While it is true that a
conspiracy does not require,a completed. substantive crime, Salinas itsclf states that “[a]
conspirator must:intend to further an'‘endeavor'which, if completed, ‘would satisfy all of the

elements of a substantive criminal offense.” Salinas, 522 U.S.'at 65. As'to, Accuser-3, the

completed endcavor—i.e., her. alleged sex.acts with Epstein—was nota substantive:criminal
offense. Even if we acceptiher allegations as truc (which'we-do not), there is nothing unlawful
about encouraging an adult'to engage in. entirely lawful sex acts. Hence, Accuser-3’s allegations
are not direct:proof of the charged conspiracies regardless.of whether Ms. Maxwell. allegedly
“groomed” her (which she did.not).

The Court should not admit. Accuser-3’s allegations as intrinsic proof ofthe charged
conspiracics cither. See.Nektalov, 325 F. Supp. 2d.at'370 (listing, three categorics of “intrinsic”

proof not. considered Rule, 404(b) evidence). The Mann Act conspiracies ‘in the S2 Indictment.
