‘The Defendant has not explained how uny of the photographs are relevant to her defense and,
‘would.“help in establishing her innocence” or why “the dates of creation” or “other specifics”

‘VI. Request 12: EVCP. Material,

A. The Reqticst is Not Specific.

The Defendant does not even address the lack of specificity of her Request for “any
submission to: the Epstein Victim’s ‘Compensation Program made by. You, including any claims
on behalf-of persons who have.accused Jeffrey Epstcin. or Ghislaine Maxwell of any: misconduct,
any releases signed by You or Your Clients, and any compensation, received by You. or Your
Clients.” This Request. on. its ‘face includes a// claims that: BSF has.submitted on behalf of ald of
its clients, including all-of the supporting documents (including sensitive medical. and therapy:
records) that each, client, submitted with those claims. As, BSF explained. in its objections, the
Defendant cannot merely request every picec of highly confidential information that BSF’s clients
submitted to. the Program in the hopes that something relevant, and.admissible: turns up. The:
Defendant offered. to narrow this Request:to EVCP: Material submitted on behalf of victims who
ultimately. testify inthis action. This “narrowing” docs not change the improper nature of Request
the charges against the Defendant and that: are highly sensitive in nature.

B. The Defendant ‘Has. Not Demonstrated. Relevance, Other Than Potential
Impeachment.

Request: ‘12. independently fails. because the Defendant secks the EVCP Material only for
impeach purposes. The:.Defendant argues that the EVGP Material. is not “mere impeachment
material” because ‘it:ts also: “Brady material.” Resp. Ctr. at.13. This ‘argument does not make this

Request proper under Rule 17. First, the Defendant does, not. explain. how the EVCP Matcrial is
