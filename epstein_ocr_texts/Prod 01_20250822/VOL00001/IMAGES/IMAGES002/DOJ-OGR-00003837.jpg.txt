Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document213  Filed.04/16/21 Page 5of8

Thus, the court:found: the indictment “contains dates ranges for cach count, stretching from
approximately four days to four months. These date ranges are well within the boundaries
permitted by the Second Circuit and other federal. courts, and have been supplemented with
additional details provided by the Government. Id., at *4:(cmphasis added).

To-date, the only time:the government has “supplemented” any information.about the
accusations.is when it is attempting to excuse:some failure.

Here, theaccusers have given statements to the government. Accuser-1 gave astatement

they mean what the user'wants'them to mean in. any given situati on; they have no meaning of
their own.” -Abstrax, Inc. v. [Hewlett-Packard Co., No, 2:14-CV-158-JRG, 2014 WL: 5677834, at:
*2 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 4, 2014). For example: “up to and including ‘at Ieast:in. or about,”
“contributed,” “among, other things,” “for example in some instances,” “certain victims,” and.
“sroomed.and/or abused at multiple locations including the following.” Ms. Maxwell is at.a‘loss

to understand what she is charged with and ‘when it'is alleged to have happened. She can guess at’
