Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 213 Filed 04/16/21 Page5of8
Thus, the court found: the indictment “contains dates ranges for each count, stretching from
approximately four days to four months. These date ranges are well within the boundaries
permitted by the Second Circuit and other federal courts, and have been supplemented with
additional details provided by the Government. Id., at *4 (emphasis added).

To date, the only time the government has “supplemented” any information about the
accusations is when it is attempting to excuse some failure.

*2 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 4, 2014). For example: “up to and including at least in or about,”
“contributed,” “among other things,” “for example in some instances,” “certain victims,” and
“groomed and/or abused at multiple locations including the following.” Ms. Maxwell is at a loss
to understand what she is charged with and when it is alleged to have happened. She can guess at
