Ghislaine Maxwell,
OPINION & ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell seeks an order authorizing four subpoenas pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Specifically, she seeks authorization

process to become a “broad discovery device” that would undermine the discovery procedures
set forth in Rule 16. United States v. Cherry, 876 F. Supp. 547, 552 (S.D.N.Y. 1995). Thus, if
