Finally, later that same year, Congress cnacted.a new statute as part of the Adam. Walsh.
Child. Protection ‘and. Safety Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-248, 120 Stat. 587. That; statute:
climinated the statute of limitations entirely for ecrtain. crimes, involving the sexual. exploitation of

(“Because Congress evineed a, clearintent to extend, rather'than shorten, the:statute of limitations
applicable to sexual, abuse. crimes, and. because there is no et pose facto problem here,, the

prosccution was timely:”) (citing United Stutes’y. Jeffries, 405 F.3d 682, 685 (8th Cir. 2005), cert.
