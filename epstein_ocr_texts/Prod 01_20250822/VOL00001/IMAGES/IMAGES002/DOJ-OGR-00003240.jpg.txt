Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 64 of 348

[The prosecution] was going forward on the part of the state, and so
here, is, the big bad federal government: stepping on, a ‘sovereign . . .
state, saying’ you. re not; doing enough, [when] to my.‘mind . . . the
whole idea. of the [P]etite policy is to recognize, that the []state.. .

is an independent entity; and. that we: should presume that what
they”, re doing is correct, even. if we don’t like the outcome, except
in the most unusual ‘of: circumstances.

Acosta told OPR that “absent'USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstcin would have
become final, and accordingly, :it. was: “prudent” to employ Petite policy analysis. As Acosta
explained ina public ; statement he issued. in 2011, “the: federal responsibility” in

situation was merely, to ‘serve as a “backstop [to] state authorities to ensure that. there [was] n no
miscarriage of justice.”*" Furthermore; Acosta saw ‘a.distinction between.a case that originated. as
a federal investigation. and, one that had already. been indicted. by the state but was brought to the:
federal government because of a perception that the state charge was inadequate. In. the latter
circumstance, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role only as preventing a“manifest injustice.”*' Acosta.
explained that “no jail time” ‘would. have been a‘manifest. injustice. But. it was his ‘understanding
that if Epstein, had. pled guilty to state, charges and received a ‘two-year sentence: to a-registrable
offense, “it would, never have comic to the office in the first. place,” ard therefore ‘would, not be
vicwed as a manifest injustice.

Acosta.also told‘OPR he was concerned that.a, federal prosecution in this case would result.
in unfavorable o Pree eee because the Epstein case ‘straddled the dine Petwecn “solicitation” or
an. emerging ‘matter of federal interest. Acosta contended, ‘that! in 1 2006, “it would have becn.
extremcly unusual for any United States Attorncy’s Office to become involved. in. a. ‘state
solicitation, casc, ‘even, one involving underage teens,” because solicitation was “the province of’
‘state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR, “I’m not saying it:was the right view -- but there are at. least.
some individuals who would have looked. at.this.and said, this is a solicitation casc,.not a trafficking
casc.” Acosta was concerned that if the USAO ‘convicted Epstein. of a. federal. charge, an appeal
might result in:an. adverse opinion about.the distinction between prostitution-and sex: trafficking.

Acosta, also told OPR that he was concerned, that a trial would be difficult ‘for Epstcin’s
victims. In Acosta’s estimation, a.trial, court in 2007 might. have permitted. “victim shaming,”
which would havebeen traumatic for them. In addition, the. factthat'the, state. grand jury returned
‘a.onc-count indictment. with a:charge that: would not require: jail time: suggested to Acosta that the
state grand jury found little merit:to the case.°” Acosta told-OPR:

‘60 Letter, from. R. Alexander, Acosta *To whom it :may concern” at 1,(Mar. 20, 201 1), :published online in ‘Zhe
6 Acosta was: referring ‘to the Petite: policy provision. allowing the presumption that:a:prior state prosecution
has vindicated.the relevant federal interest to’be “overcome. . ..if'the prior [state] sentence, was manitestly: inadequate
in light of the federal:interest involved and a substantially enhanced. sentence. .... is.available‘through'the contemplated,
federal prosecution” USAM § 9-2.031-D.

@ Acosta told OPR. he was unaware ‘that USAO prosecutors: believed the State -Attorney’s ‘Office ‘had.
deliberately ‘undermined the ‘case: before: the state grand jury. Menchel told OPR. that he: understood that the State
