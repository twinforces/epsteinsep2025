Government’s Proposed Exhibit List and Marked Exhibits

The Government is prepared to provide the defense with its proposed exhibit list and
marked exhibits by October 25, 2021, or 5 weeks in advance of trial. This deadline will allow the
defense adequate time to review and raise objections to any Government exhibits.
Defense Disclosures

The Government proposes that the defense be required to provide expert witness
disclosures pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(b)(1)(C) by October 4, 2021, or 8
weeks in advance of trial. This deadline will give the defendant ample time to determine what, if
any, expert testimony she may seek to offer. The defense—who has had the Government’s expert
notice since April 23, 2021—-seeks to provide expert notice 4 weeks in advance of trial, or by
November 1, 2021, but such a belated disclosure would not allow adequate time in advance of trial
to brief any motions regarding the admissibility of such testimony, much less by the Court’s
deadline. See, e.g., United States v. Rajaratnam, No. S2 09 Cr. 1184 (RJH), 2011 WL 723530, at
*3,*5 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2011) (reasoning that “the purpose of reciprocal expert disclosures is to
minimize surprise that often results from unexpected expert testimony, reduce the need for
continuances, and to provide the opponent with a fair opportunity to test the merit of the expert’s
testimony through focused cross-examination.”; “Specifically, under Rule 16, a defendant’s
obligation to make expert disclosures does not turn on whether the government will call a certain
witness or prove certain overt acts in furtherance of a conspiracy—disclosures mentioned nowhere
in the Rule—but on whether the government has made its own expert disclosures.”) (internal
quotations and citations omitted); see also United States v. Jasper, No. 00 Cr. 825 (PKL), 2003
WL 223212, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 21, 2003) (disagreeing with the defense’s claim that the
Government’s request for reciprocal discovery and summaries of expert testimony was
