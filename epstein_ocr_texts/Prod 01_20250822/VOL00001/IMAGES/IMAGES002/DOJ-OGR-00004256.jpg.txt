Government’s Proposed Exhibit List and Marked Exhibits

The Government is prepared to provide the defense with, its proposed exhibit, list and.
marked, éxhibits. by October 25, 2021, or 5 weeks in advance of*trial. This deadline will allow the
defense adequate:time to review and raise objections to any Government exhibits.

Defense Disclosures

The Government proposes that the defense be required 'to provide. expert witness
disclosures'pursuant to ‘Federal, Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(b)(1.)(C) by October 4, 20211, or 8

‘obligation to.make expert disclosures docs not turn on whether the government-will, call a certain,
‘witness or prove certain overt acts in furtherance of a.conspiracy—disclosures mentioned ‘nowhcre
‘in. the. Rule—but on whether the government has: made its own expert disclosures.”) (internal.
