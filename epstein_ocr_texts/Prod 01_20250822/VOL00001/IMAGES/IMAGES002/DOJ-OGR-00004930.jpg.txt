: To Be Filed Under Seal
Order. (Letter from AUSA Alex Rossmiller to the Hon. Robert W. Sweet, dated Feb. 28, 2019 |
(“Gov’t Letter Br.”), Dkt. No. 2, at 1.) |
Judge Sweet asked for further briefing. On February 28, 2019, the Government |
submitted a letter brief in camera, to which it appended a copy of the Protective Order and a |
proposed order granting the relief requested. (See Gov’t Letter Br.) Neither the initial |
application nor the subsequent letter brief was initially filed with the Clerk of Court. |
Prior to ruling on the Government’s application, Judge Sweet died. The open application |
was referred to me. |
I directed that a miscellaneous docket number be assigned to the Government’s :
application and that all materials theretofore sent to Judge Sweet’s chambers be filed under seal.” |
I also held two conferences in which I questioned the U.S. Attorney’s Office about the |
application. |
II. The Government’s Application, While Irregular, Is Granted 2
A. Procedural Irregularities Attendant to This Application |
In the ordinary course, one would expect this application to arise in a different procedural |
posture. |
First, one would have expected Boies Schiller, the recipient of the subpoena, to have |
either (1) moved for relief from the Protective Order, or (2) moved to quash the subpoena. See |
In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. 19, 1991, 945 F.2d 1221, 1225 (2d Cir. |
1991) (“The proper procedure .., is... to subpoena the deposition transcripts for use in a |
pending proceeding such as a grand jury investigation or trial, in which the issue could be raised |
2 All materials under this docket number, 19-mc-149, including this opinion, will be kept under seal as |
related to a pending grand jury investigation. |
