Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 336-1 Filed 09/07/21 Page 53 of 60
e All Claimants will be treated with respect, dignity and fairness without regard to

race, color, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, gender or disability. To

ensure claims will be adjudicated fairly, the Administrator will manage the process

so that all Claimants can equally access the Program’s claim process. Individuals

with disabilities will be given the opportunity to effectively communicate their

claims and to request special process accommodations.
The Program is available to all victims-survivors regardless of where they were harmed, when they were
harmed, whether the claim is time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and whether they
have previously filed a lawsuit against or settled with Epstein and/or the Estate.
The exclusive claims period for filing a claim pursuant to this Protocol shall commence on the to-be-
determined Effective Date and shall conclude nine (9) months after that date (“Filing Deadline”). All
individual claims filed with the Program must be filed within this period.
To complement the Program’s resources, the Administrator will, at her discretion and with the consent
of the Claimant, consult with Professor Marci A. Hamilton, a nationally recognized sexual abuse expert,
leading legal academic and advocate of victims’ rights. Ms. Hamilton’s role will be to further inform the
Administrator and her staff about the dynamics of sexual abuse, common responses to sexual abuse,
and the impact of sexual abuse on victims; to serve as a resource for the Administrator in developing or
updating policies and procedures; to advise the Administrator regarding sensitivities involved in
interactions with victims; and to serve as a referral source for the Administrator in providing post-
determination information to claimants who seek guidance, counseling or other services. The
Administrator may, at her discretion and with the Claimant’s prior written consent, request that Ms.
Hamilton review an individual claimant file. The Administrator will determine on a case-by-case basis, in
her discretion, the need to anonymize individual claimants’ files before sharing them with Ms. Hamilton.
As set forth above, the Administrator is solely responsible for all decisions relating to the administration
of the Program, including the review, processing, evaluation, and determination of individual claims
submitted to the Program.
During the term of the Program, Ms. Hamilton will not meet or speak with a Claimant or her
representatives concerning any aspect of the Program without the Administrator present. Ms. Hamilton
will maintain in strict confidence and will not disclose outside the Program any information she obtains
through her participation in the Program, including individual Claimants’ submissions.
