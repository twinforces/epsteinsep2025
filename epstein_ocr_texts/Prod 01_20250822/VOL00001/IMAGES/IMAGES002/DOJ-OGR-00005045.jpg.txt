Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 336 Filed :09/07/21 Page 3 of 10

As previously:detailed, Annic Farmer is believed to-be the alleged victim referred, to in
the superseding indictment as “Minor Victim 2.” She is represented. by BSF. See, ¢.g., Anitic
Farmer v. dndyke, et al.,.No. 19 Civ. 10475 (LGS). The proposed-BSF Subpoena calls for
production of ‘particular physical, items‘that.belong to Annic Farmer, specifically a journal, black
boots, afd. certain photographs. BSF produced photos of those items (and. PDF replications of
the photographs) to Ms. Maxwell in the. Annie farmer action. It is unknown‘whether the items
are currently in the possession.of BSF or Ms. Annic Farmer. Ms: Maxwell proposes to serve ‘a.
subpoena, attached as Exhibit 1, on Ms..Annic Farmer forthe physical items; counsel. also
proposes that service be: effected through BSF if they are willing to accept service.’ Inspection
of cach of these items in advance of trial is necessary for'the reasons set: forth in. the Ms.
Maxwell’s First.Motion.

Ms. Maxwell secks also to serve a subpoena.on Ms. Annie Farmer in the event.that BSF
claimis the physical items arc not in their custody or control, but rather belong to (arid ate inthe
possession. of) their client. The proposed. subpoena secks no new or additional information
beyond that which is sought by the BSF Subpocna.

Similarly, Ms. Maxwell secks also. to serve a:subpoena on.Annic Farmer’s older sister,
Maria, Farmer., See Exhibit 2., Like Annic, Maria Farmer is represented by BSF. See Maria
Farmer ¥. Indvke et al., 19 Civ. 10474 (NRB). .Ms. Maxwell secks to serve'the. proposed
subpoena .on Maria Farmer through BSF if they are willing to accept service.

Defense counsel. does not believe that: Maria Farmer is mentioned. in the Indictment,

however, counsel beliéves;the government will offer her as a witness at this criminal trial cither

' Fed. R. Crim. P..'17(c)(3) requires notice to an alleged victim where “personal, or
confidential information about a'victim” is being sought. These subpoenas. are addressed directly:
to the alleged. victims so notice should be provided upon issuance.
