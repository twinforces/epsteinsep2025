Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 336 Filed 09/07/21 Page3of10

As previously detailed, Annie Farmer is believed to be the alleged victim referred to in
the superseding indictment as “Minor Victim 2.” She is represented by BSF. See, e.g., Annie
Farmer v. Indyke, et al., No. 19 Civ. 10475 (LGS). The proposed BSF Subpoena calls for
production of particular physical items that belong to Annie Farmer, specifically a journal, black
boots, and certain photographs. BSF produced photos of those items (and PDF replications of
the photographs) to Ms. Maxwell in the Annie Farmer action. It is unknown whether the items
are currently in the possession of BSF or Ms. Annie Farmer. Ms. Maxwell proposes to serve a
subpoena, attached as Exhibit 1, on Ms. Annie Farmer for the physical items; counsel also
proposes that service be effected through BSF if they are willing to accept service.' Inspection
of each of these items in advance of trial is necessary for the reasons set forth in the Ms.
Maxwell’s First Motion.

Ms. Maxwell seeks also to serve a subpoena on Ms. Annie Farmer in the event that BSF
claims the physical items are not in their custody or control, but rather belong to (and are in the
possession of) their client. The proposed subpoena seeks no new or additional information
beyond that which is sought by the BSF Subpoena.

Similarly, Ms. Maxwell seeks also to serve a subpoena on Annie Farmer’s older sister,
Maria Farmer. See Exhibit 2. Like Annie, Maria Farmer is represented by BSF. See Maria
Farmer v. Indyke et al., 19 Civ. 10474 (NRB). Ms. Maxwell seeks to serve the proposed
subpoena on Maria Farmer through BSF if they are willing to accept service.

Defense counsel does not believe that Maria Farmer is mentioned in the Indictment,
however, counsel believes the government will offer her as a witness at this criminal trial either

' Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3) requires notice to an alleged victim where “personal or
confidential information about a victim” is being sought. These subpoenas are addressed directly
to the alleged victims so notice should be provided upon issuance.
