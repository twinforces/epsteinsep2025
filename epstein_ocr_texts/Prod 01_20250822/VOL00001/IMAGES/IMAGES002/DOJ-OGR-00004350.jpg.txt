memorandum, noting that the’ “keys” were whether the USAO: could. prove’ that Epstein traveled.
for the purpose of engaging ‘in, sexual acts, and the fact that some minor victims told. Epstein they’
were 18.°” Lourie asked.for'Menchel’s “very general. opinion as'to whether this is a. case you think’
the office should do,” and. reminded .Menchcl that the State Attorncy’s Office “went ‘out of their

a7 In ‘various submissions: tothe USAO, ‘the defense contended thatthe federal statute ‘required proof: that:
‘engaging ina sexual. act was the “paramount or dominant purpose” of Epstein’s: travel, but’that: Epstein’s;trayel was,
motivated, byhis ‘desire to live outside of New York for over half-of cach. year for. tax purposes. The. defense also
asserted that the; federal, statutes at issue required proof that the defendant knew the. victims were under. 18, but that:
Epstein “took affirmative steps to ensure that every woman. was: at least 18 years of age” In‘her ‘prosecution
memorandum, however, Villafafia.sct:forth.her conclusion that.the statute: conly: required. proof. that: cengaging:ina sexual,
act-was one of the motiy ating factors forthe travel. She also concluded that the statutes did not require proof that the
defendant knew'the victims were:minors.
