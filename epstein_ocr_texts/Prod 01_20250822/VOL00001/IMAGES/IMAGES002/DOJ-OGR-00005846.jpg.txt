Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document397 Filed 10/29/21 Page 63 of 84

Even if the Government has misread the Court’s order, the defense’s claims of prejudice
are exaggerated. Although the defense complains that the Government seized “multiple electronic
devices” containing “hundreds of thousands of statements spanning decades” (Def. Mot. 1 at 3),
any statements contained in emails or other documents that the Government plans to use at trial
have been marked as Government exhibits and produced to the defense. The defense need look
no further than the Government’s exhibit list to discover what documents will be offered at trial.
Similarly, although the defense complains of “document dumps” (id. at 2) and the need to review
“thousands of pages of newly provided discovery material” (id. at 7), any witness testimony
containing co-conspirator statements is contained in the Government’s Jencks Act production—
and specifically, the Government’s production of material for testifying witnesses. Although the
Government produced as a courtesy prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, by definition the
Government does not plan to call those individuals at trial. And the Government has informed the
defense of the limited number of co-conspirators to whom it may refer at trial, so the defense
knows exactly which declarants’ statements are possibly subject to the co-conspirator exception.

Finally, and in any event, suppression is not a proper remedy. The defense relies
principally on Taylor v. Illinois, 484 U.S. 400 (1988), in which the Supreme Court upheld an order
'6 To be clear, the defendant’s motion concerns the admission of statements under Rule
801(d)(2)(E). The majority of the statements made by co-conspirators that will be offered at trial
have other bases for admissibility. For example, witnesses will testify regarding promises, offers,
instructions, and directions they received from Epstein. Those statements are not factual assertions
subject to hearsay rules. Rather, they are offered for the effect on the listener, among other reasons.
