(holding that the Rule “permits the introduction of a declarant’s consistent out-of-court
statements to rebut a charge of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive” where “those
statements were made before the charged recent fabrication or improper influence or motive”).

And regardless of the timing of any alleged motive to lie, the Minor Victims’ prior
consistent statements will be admissible under subpart (11), which was enacted “to extend
substantive effect to consistent statements that rebut other attacks on a witness.” 2014 Advisory

Victims on another ground, such as inconsistency or faulty memory, the Government is entitled
to rehabilitate the Minor Victims through prior consistent statements made to other witnesses.
See, e.g., Purcell, 967 F.3d at 197; Flores, 945 F.3d at 705-06; Cox, 871 F.3d at 487.
