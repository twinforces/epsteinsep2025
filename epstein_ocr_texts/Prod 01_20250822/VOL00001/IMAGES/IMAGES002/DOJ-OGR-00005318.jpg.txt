United States v. Maxwell, 20cr330
Preliminary Remarks Prior to Questionnaire
To be video recorded and played on 11/4, 11/5, and 11/12

Hello everyone. Thank you so much for being here. And welcome to the Southern
District of New York. My name is Judge Alison Nathan and I am the judge who will preside
over the trial for which you have been summoned. I have recorded this message to you because
you are spread out in different rooms and over different times as part of the District’s COVID
safety protocols. I look forward to seeing you in person as this process moves forward.

We are about to start the process of selecting a jury to try a criminal case. I’m going to
briefly describe the process to you as it may be different than what some of you have previously
experienced when summoned for jury duty.

The first part of the process is going to occur now. In a few minutes, after you’ve been
sworn to tell the truth, you will fill out a questionnaire. The purpose of the questionnaire is for
you to provide information to myself, to the prosecutors, to defense counsel, and to the defendant
to assist all of us in determining whether you can be a fair and impartial juror in this case.

When you are done filling out the questionnaire, you will return it to the Jury Department
staff and you will be done for the day. Some of you will be asked to return for a phase two,
which will involve in-person questioning by me. That is going to start on November 16. So you
are free of jury service with respect to this case from whenever you finish the questionnaire until
at least November 16. Some of those who are going to return will come in on November 16,
some will come on November 17", and possibly there will be one or two more days. You will
get instructions before you leave here today about how you will find out whether you are going
