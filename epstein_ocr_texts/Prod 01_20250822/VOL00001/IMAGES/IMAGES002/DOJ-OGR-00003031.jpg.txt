formal application” for the relevant materials and took that approach to “avoid the types of
problems” created by other less formal government requests in other cited cases. (/d. at 20).

the subject of your investigation.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2 (emphasis added)).*4 In Chemical

stripping important context from the nature of Chief Judge McMahon’s question which, as asked,
was focused on “your investigation.” (See Def. Mot. 3 at 7).
