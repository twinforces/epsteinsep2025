BACKGROUND

The Court has already ruled that the perjury: counts must’be severed ‘because trying the
perjury: counts‘with the other counts in the indictment. would risk admitting cvidence that would
be “unduly prejudicial” to Ms. Maxwell, would. “compromise [Ms.] Maxwell’s right to the
counsel of her choice,” and would “risk an unfair trial.” 4/16/2021 Op. and. Order (Dkt. 207) at
23-24. In‘particular, the Court recognized that introducing cvidence related to the-perjury
charges. would expose the jury to other acts of.alleged sexual. abuse:that: are not charged. in the
indictment, as well as cvidenee of an unrelated civil lawsuit by a'separate accuser, that could,
Significantly sway the jury’s. verdict on ‘the. other counts inthe. indictment.

[Trying the perjury counts with, the other counts] would. introduce
unrelated. allegations of, scxual. abuse, which, would potentially
expose the’ jury’to, evidence that might otherwise not; be admissible.
In particular, a joint trial would potentially expose the jury to a
wider swath of° information. regarding civil litigation against
Epstein that is remote .from Maxwell's charged. conduct. ‘This
presents. a. significant risk that, the jury will cumulate the evidence

of the: various crimes ‘charged, and find, guilt when, if considered
separatcly; it would:not do so.
