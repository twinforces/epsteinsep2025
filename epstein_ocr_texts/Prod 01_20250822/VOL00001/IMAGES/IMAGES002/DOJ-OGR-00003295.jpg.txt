that read “This has to stop,” in which. he ‘stated:

Just réad the letter.

1. We specifically refused to include the: provision. saying that
we would not. communicate. If'l recall the conference call, wetold
him we; could ‘not. agree to a. gag order using those; words.

2. The. purpose: of the agreement was not an out. of court
settlement. Seems ‘that: they can’t: take no. ‘Let’s talk re how to

addendum for her on behalf of the USAO.

Villafana later emailed Sloman Manking. him for ¢ ‘the advice and the pep tall ” which.

The funny thing is ‘that. had ‘never met (ard. still haven’t met) or
spoken to [the private. attorney] before | asked him if he. would ‘be
willing to: take on'this case. ... . But as'soon as ‘you mentioned. the
appearance problem, | saw ‘where the problem. would arise and
agreed. that the Special Master would be a safer route. I just 'worry
