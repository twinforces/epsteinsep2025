Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 310-1 Filed 07/02/21 Page 24 of 80
Cosby in order to remove from him the ability to claim his Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing
him to sit for a deposition under oath. ... But those lawyers
representing [Constand] civilly . .. were part of this agreement
because they wanted to make Cosby testify. | believed at the
time that they thought making him testify would solidify their
civil case, but the only way to do that was for us (the
Commonwealth) to promise not to prosecute him. So in effect,
that is what | did. | never made an important decision without
discussing it with you during your tenure as First Assistant.

[B]ut one thing is fact. The Commonwealth, defense and civil

plaintiff's lawyers were all in agreement that the attached

decision from me stripped Cosby of his Fifth Amendment

privilege against self-incrimination forcing him to be deposed.
He indicated in his email that he learned Mr. Phillips had died on the date
of his email. The email also suggested that the deposition might be subject
to suppression.
Ms. Ferman responded to Mr. Castor’s email by letter of September 25,
2015, requesting a copy of the “written declaration” indicating that [Cosby]
would not be prosecuted. In her letter, Ms. Ferman indicated that “[t]he first
| heard of such a binding agreement was your email sent this past
Wednesday. The first | heard of a written declaration documenting the
agreement not to prosecute was authored on 9/24/15 and published today
by Margaret Gibbons of the Intelligencer. ... We have been in contact with
counsel for both Mr. Cosby and Ms. Constand and neither has provided us
with any information about such an agreement.”
Mr. Castor responded by email. His email indicated,

The attached Press Release is the written determination that

we would not prosecute Cosby. That was what the lawyers

for the plaintiffs wanted and | agreed. The reason | agreed

and the plaintiff's wanted it in writing was so Cosby could not

take the 5" Amendment to avoid being deposed or

testifying. ... That meant to all involved, including Cosby’s

lawyer at the time, Mr. Phillips, that what Cosby said in the

civil litigation could not be used against him in a criminal

prosecution for the event we had him under investigation for

in early 2005. | signed the press release for precisely this

reason, at the request of Plaintiff's counsel, and with the

acquiescence of Cosby’s counsel, with full and complete

intent to bind the Commonwealth that anything Cosby said in
