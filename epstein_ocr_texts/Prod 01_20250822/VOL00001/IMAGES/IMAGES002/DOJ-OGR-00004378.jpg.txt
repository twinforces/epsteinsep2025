the period of imprisonment, because the USAO failed to hold firm to its proposal of “at least two
years in prison.” The USAO did, however, consistently reject defense proposals to change other
terms, particularly the requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender.

A. July 31, 2007: The USAO Presents Its Proposal to the Defense Team, which

Makes a Counteroffer

Menchel, Sloman, Lourie, Villafafia, and the case agents met with Epstein attorneys
Lefcourt, Sanchez, and Black on July 31, 2007, with Menchel “leading the meeting” for the
USAO.*’’ The USAO presented the term sheet, and Villafafia distributed a federal sentencing
guidelines calculation showing that if prosecuted federally, Epstein faced a sentencing range of
188 to 235 months’ incarceration.

Villafafia recalled that during the meeting, Epstein’s attorneys opposed the requirement of
sexual offender registration, argued that Epstein would not be safe in prison, suggested that Epstein
serve a sentence of home confinement or “community control’”*® in lieu of incarceration, and
emphasized that a state resolution provided greater sentencing flexibility.*’ Villafafia told OPR
that when Epstein’s attorneys expressed concern during the meeting about Epstein’s security in a
state prison and argued for a home confinement sentence, Menchel suggested Epstein plead to a
federal charge so that he could serve his time in a federal facility. A few days after the meeting,
Villafafia emailed Menchel, stating that she had “figured out a way to do a federal plea with a 2-1/2
year cap.”

Although Acosta had authorized a plea to state charges, emails and other correspondence
show that during the negotiations, the parties also considered structuring a plea around federal
ey Villafafia was the only witness with whom OPR spoke who had a substantive memory of this meeting.

88 According to the Florida Department of Corrections fact sheet for defendants subjected to community control,

The Community Control supervision program was created as a diversion to

incarceration or imprisonment; therefore it is an intensive supervision program

where you are confined to your home unless you are working, attending school,

performing public service hours, participating in treatment or another special

activity that has been approved in advance by your officer. The program was

designed to build accountability and responsibility along with providing a

punishment alternative to imprisonment. While on Community Control

supervision (also known as “house arrest”) you will not be allowed to leave your

home to visit family or friends, go out to dinner or to the movies, go on vacation,

or many of the other activities you are used to being able to do... , but it does

allow you to continue to work to support yourself and your family or attend school

in lieu of being incarcerated and away from loved ones.

8 Villafafia told OPR that she was concerned about a state resolution because the defense team “had a lot of
experience with the state system. We did not.” Villafafia anticipated there would be ways to “manipulate” a state
sentence and the USAO would be “giving up all control,” and she told OPR that she discussed this concern with
Lourie, although she could not recall when that discussion occurred.
