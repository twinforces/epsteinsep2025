Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 185 of 348

State Attorney and the lead state prosecutor on. September 12, 2007, was a niecessary ‘part ‘of the
NPA ‘negotiation process.

Even after the: NRA. was signed, ‘the defense continued. to request meetings and. reviews of
the case, ‘both within, the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal, Division, and the: Deputy
Attorney Gencral. Although limited ‘reviews were granted, during this period there was only one:
substantive meeting with.Acosta, on December 14, 2007.7" This mecting occurred. in licu.of the
meeting Starr'had requested of Assistant Attorney Gencral Fisher, most likely because the. defense
submissions tothe Department’s. ‘Criminal .Division. had. raised issues not previously. raised with.
the USAOsand the Department determined that.Acosta: should. address those in the first:instanee.°**
Acosta fold.OPR that he did not:ask for the Department review, but-he alsodid not-want to appear
as if, he) “fear[ed]” ‘that. review. Acosta’s nuanced ‘position, however, was not: clear to the
Department attorneys who ‘responded to Epstcin’s appeals and:who perécived Acosta to be in favor’
of a Department review, rather than mercly'tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those:mectings
‘or. reviews resulted. in. the USAO: abandoning ‘the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial
advantage from. his continued, entreaties.

In.sum, in.¢valuating the subjects’ conduct,'OPR considered. the number of meetings, their
purpose, the content of'the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR. cannot say: that the
number of mectings, particularly‘those occurring before the NRA. was signed, was so far outside
the norm—for a high ‘profile case with skilled defense attorncys—that the quantity of mectings
alone ‘shows that the subjects:were motivated by improper favoritism. In. cvaluating the subjects’
conduct, OPR.considered that the: mectings were held with different levels of USAO managers and.
that the: explanations. forthe. decisions;to participate inthe, meetings reflected reasonable, strategic
goals. Although OPR. cannot: rule out: the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Louric, or
Sloman knew or knew of the defense attorneys, they may‘have been willing to mect with them, it
is also true'that prosecutors.routincly:meet with defense attorneys, including those’ who are known,
to them and those whio a are not. Furthermore, meetings arc more likely t to, occur in n. high Profile
mectings at the highest levels of the USAO and the Department. Most significantly, OPR. did not.
find evidence supporting a conclusion, that the meetings themselves resulted in any‘ substantial
benefit fo the defense. At cach, mecting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,
legal,.and policy grounds=to forgo its federal investigation and to return the mattcr’to, the state to
proceed. as it.saw fit. The USAO never ‘yiclded on. that point. Accordingly,. OPR did not find.
evidence. supporting a. conclusion ‘that. Acosta, Sloman, Menchcl, ‘Louric, or Villafafia met with,
defense: counsel for. the purpose of benefiting Epstein or ‘that: the: mectings. themselves caused,
Acosta or the other:subjccts to ‘provide improper benefits fo Epstein.
