Cir. 1986) (“[C]onsent is a defense to kidnapping but not to:a Mann Act charge’... . 2”); United
States. Rivera, No. 13 Cr. 149 (KAM), 2015 WL. 1886967, at:*7 n.4.(E.D.N.Y. Apr. 24, 2015)
(“[C]Jonsent is not a defense ‘to the sex:trafficking, of minors . . . and is. also not..a defense to
violations of 18 U.S.C. § 2422.”); United, States ‘vy. Griffith, No. 99 Cr. 786 (HB), 2000 WL
1253265, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2000) (“The Mann Act (18 U:S.C. §§ 2241-3) has..never,
since: its inception, provided. for a. defense of'consent.”); see also Gebardi y, United States, 287
U.S. 112, 11.9 (1932) (“For the statute is drawn to include cases in which the woman. consents to
her own transportation.”). And. it isnot a defense to the New York offense which is the object of
the Mann Act. counts. See N7Y. Penal Law § 130:05(3)(a) (“A person ‘is deemed. incapable of
consent when he or she ts . ... less than. séventcen years old... .”).

The Indictment concerns only ‘minor victims, and. as a matter of law, such. underage
victims could not consent; to engage in sexual activity. Accordingly, evidence: or arguments ‘that:
the victims consented to being trafficked, transported, enticed,or sexually exploited would. not
give rise to: a valid. defense, and. they: should be precluded. See Elbert, 561 F.3d at 777-78
(affirming exclusion of evidence of a'victim’s consent ‘under: Federal Rule of Evidence! 41:2). In.
the absence ofa consent defense, evidence: about the victims’ consent toscxual. activity should
also be exeluded.as irrelevant. See Fed... Evid. 401., Such evidence ‘is not probative or relevant.
to any issuc:at the’trial. It cannot support a deferisc, and.it docs not impeach the ‘witnesses or
undermine their credibility.

And ‘in, any event, ‘argument. and evidence, about: victims’ consent ‘should, be exeluded,

under :Rule,403. Any marginal ‘value, of'such evidence would serve primarily to ‘east aspersions.
