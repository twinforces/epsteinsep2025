When, asked why’ the’ USAO did. not simply: notify the victims of the change of plea. hearing,
Sloman responded that he “was, more ‘focused. on the: restitution‘provisions.. | didn’t get the sense
‘that the victims were overly interested ‘in showing'up . . . at. the change of plea.”

Also, in n late June, Villafafia drafted a ‘victim notification letter concerning: the June 30,
‘vould:not provide written notice of the s state change of plea, the written ‘vietim ‘notifications v were
prepared to be sent immediately following Epstcin’s guilty plea.”°*' As she did with prior draft
victim notification letters, Villafania ‘provided the draft'to the defense for comments.3~

Although Epstein’ s plea hearing was set; ‘for June 30, 2008, Villafafia took.steps to facilitate:
the filing of federal charges on July 1, 2008, in the event he did not plead, guilty in,state court.

OPR. reviewed voluminous ‘Epstcin-related files that the State Attorncy’s Office made
available online, but OPR-was unable to locate any document establishing that before the hearing:
date, the:state informed. victims of the June 30, 2008'plea. On March, 12,:2008, the State: Attorney’s
Office issucd trial subpoenas to three victims and.one non-law enforcement. witness: commanding
‘the individuals to “remain on call” during the week’ of July 8,.2008. However, the Palm Beach
County Sheriff was unable to sérve one of the victims in ‘person because the'victim was “away [at]
college.”
