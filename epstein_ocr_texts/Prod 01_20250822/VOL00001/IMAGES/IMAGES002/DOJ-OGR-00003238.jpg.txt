damages.** During a:'two-month, period, the'subject:attorneys were involved to varying degrees in
converting ‘the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the: NPA, signed by Epstein on,
September:24, 2007. The subjects, including Acosta, were gencrally.able to explain'to. OPR both.
the larger goals and. the case-related factors they likely considered. during, the. ‘proccss. of
conceptualizing,: negotiating, -and finalizing this resolution. However,-the: contemporancous cmails
and other records do not. reflect.all of the: conversations among’ the decision, makers, and. their
deliberative and decision- -making process is therefore’ not, entirely clear. In particular, Menchel
and. Acosta, had. offices located ncarcach other and. likely’ spoke in. person. about: the case, but.
neither had.a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR.could not:determine all of the
facts surrounding the devclopmentvof the two-ycar state plea resolution or the NPA.

In the’ following account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve’ the federal
investigation through state, rather than. federal, charges, ‘and sets forth many’ of the numcrous
communications that reflect the negotiations between the partics that led. to the final NPA. OPR
questioned cach ‘of the subjects: about. how: the: decision was reached to pursuc.a state resolution,
and. OPR includes below: the subjects’ explanations. The subjects” memorics of particular
conversations about this topic. were unclear, but, from their statements to OPR, a gencral consensus
emerged that there were overlapping concerns. ‘about the viability of the Icgal theorics, the
willingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the:
casc'that-had been developed at'that.timec,. and the uncertainty about: ‘the. USAO’S ability to prevail,
at trial and through: appeal. In n addition, Acosta ‘was: concerned, about: usurping | x the state” S: authority
on 1 this evidence, OPR concludes that. Acosta: may ‘well have formulated the initial plan, to ‘resolve
the matter through a state ‘plea. In any event, Acosta acknowledged to OPR that, at a minimum,
he approved. of the concept. of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the: allegations
and. the evidence against Epstein as sct. forth ‘in Villafafia’s. prosecution memorandum.
Furthermore, Acosta.approved of the final terms of the NPA.
