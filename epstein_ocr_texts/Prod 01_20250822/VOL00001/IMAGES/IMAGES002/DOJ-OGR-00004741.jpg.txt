timeframe, the Defendant. may make an application to the Court.to compel the Government.to
adhere to its 'répresentation.

Request. 1:L.:secks production of the original versions of certain photographs.of the alleged
victim. Maxwell secks these matcrials:to inspect them prior, to trial in, order to investigate their
authenticity. In its.May’'6 letter, the Government indicated that'the. original versions of a.subset’
available to the defense for'inspeetion‘upon, request. The Court:.agrees with, the Government that.
the request is. moot as to those photographs. Again, to the extent-that the Government.fails to
comply‘with its representation that. it will make those’photographs available to the defense upon
‘request, the defense may:make:an application.to the Court.

As to the remaining photographs, the request is denied. on-the basis. that the defense: has
failed to establish, the relevance of the original versions of:the photographs. The defense already
has photocopies of scarinied versions. of the-photographs in. question. ‘But the defense. proffers
that it secks the original versions of these photographs in order to determine’whether they are
genuine. The only discernible theory. of relevance as to this request. is impeachment. Maxwell.
does ‘not set forth any other nonconclusory: basis for their relevance. And again, because
impeachment-evidence falls outside the scope of Rule 17(c), the request fails to meet Nixon’s
relevance requirement. But even.assuming’that impcachnient could permissibly cstablish
relevance, the argument fails because Maxwell does not:yct know the scope of the victim’s
testimony. or whether it will implicate, the photographs.

1. Conclusion.
The ‘Defendant’s motion, for.an order authorizing the subpoena pursuant to Rule 17(c)(3)

is DENIED.
