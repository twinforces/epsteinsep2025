( 1 because I don't know anything about the case.
2 MR. ROSSMILLER: Okay, your Honor, and I think the |
3 answer to that is in a couple parts. The first is, I would
4 point the Court towards some of the opinions that have talked |
5 about the government's investigative ability and authority
6 being broad, and it is the case that sometimes we issue grand
7 jury subpoenas --
8 THE COURT: But that was true in Martindell too.
g MR. ROSSMILLER: Yes, of course, your Honor, but I
10 just need to say that it is entirely possible that, in any :
11 grand jury subpoena, that materials will come back that are not
12 helpful to our investigation, are not relevant, for whatever
( 13 reason, that it was, however unintentionally, overbroad or
14 included unnecessary aspects. Here, we are essentially unable |
15 to significantly narrow the request for information in part for
16 exactly the reasons that you describe. We have either little
ig or no additional information than the Court does in terms of
18 what materials there are, who was deposed, and that is in
19 marked contrast to some of the other cases.
20 THE COURT: Every other case in the whole world.
21 MR. ROSSMILLER: Of course, your Honor. Exactly. For
22 exactly the reasons we described.
23 So what I can say in terms of assurance is, we are not
24 sort of an ordinary third-party intervenor. All of these
a 25 materials will be subject to the extraordinary protections of
