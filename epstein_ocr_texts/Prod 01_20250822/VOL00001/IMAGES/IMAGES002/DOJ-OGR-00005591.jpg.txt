offenses are negated by a consent defense. (See Gov’t Mot. at 39-40). Accordingly, there is no
basis to offer'evidenceé or make argument related’to the Minor Victims’ consent.

In.Counts Two and Four, the defendant:is charged under the Mann Act with. transporting a
minor with, intent-to violate’New York: Penal Law § 130.55,.and enticing a minor to do the: same.

That crime. does:not rélaté to prostitution. li Courits One and Three, the defendant is. charged with.

‘conspiracy to violate the sume statute—not “varying local, state laws” in “multi-jurisdictional,
locations; (Def. Opp.'at 47), and not violating the Mann. Act ‘with intent to commit:prostitution:
In Count.Six, the.defendant:is charged with-sex trafficking ofa person less than cightcen. In Count
Five, the defendant, is charged, with conspiracy to commit the same.

Beéeause these offenses all involve crimes with victims below specified age cutoffs for
which consents not:a defense, consent-is not at:issuczin this ‘case. The: defense is therefore wrong
when it argues that the Government has “charged, offenscs.'associated with cocrcion, foree and.
violence.” (/d. at 49). The charges in the ‘Indictment concern sexual activity ‘with a.minor,
simpliciter, The Government: has: not, for instance, charged sex trafficking through force, fraud,
or coercion, and those! clements arc’ not-at:issue in this case.

This:misunderstanding by: the defense underlics.its response to this point. For instance, the
defense’ suggests that..Minor Victim-4 was cngaged.‘in, prostitution at the time of the charged.
offenses, which. might: give: her criminal exposuré under Florida law. (Sée id. at.48). That is
irrelevant, because all that:matters for the:purposes of.18 U.S.C. § 1591—and therefore this case—
is,'that;she was a minor. See, é@g., United States 'v. Corley, 679 F. App’x, 1, 4 (2d. Cir. 2017)

(summary order) (“Further, the victims could not. consent because they’ were minors.”).
