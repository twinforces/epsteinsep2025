in bankruptcy proceeding). And the:cases the defendant cites in which a perjury or false statements
count. Was severed only ‘underscore this point. In both casés,'the statement itself concerned. an
entirely different subject matter, provable through largely if:not entirely different evidence. See
United States v: Botti, No: 08'Cr. 230 (CSH), 2009 WL 3157582, at *1,*5 (D. Conn. Sept. 25,
2009) (severing a ‘structuring conspiracy and. false statements related to that conspiracy from. a.
“separate” corruption, conspiracy); United States v. Mitan, No. 08-760, '2009 WL,'2328870, at. *3
(E.D. Pa. July. '28, '2009) (severing counts charging a, fraud scheme from. ‘perjury. count. for an
affidavit submitted as part.of.a bail. motion, which. “was not.as an. attempt to cover up the scheme:
to defraud, but rather an attempt to show that-Court had, erred” incits bail decision).

answers “conecaled” no crimes because'they were “truce and:reflective ofthe poor questioning by
the plaintiff's lawyers.” (Def. Mot: 5 at 8-9). The, defendant is 'free/to make at least someof these
arguments to the jury, but these assertions arc not a lawful basis for severing Counts Five:and Six.
This is merely an attempt to'refashion the dcefendant’s claim. that she gave. truthful, immaterial
answers to ambiguous questions. But, as discussed. in detail in. Section VV, those arguments have
no merit.

Third, the defendant has failed to carry her heavy burden under Rule 14(a), to show
prejudice. At the outset, “[t]he:contention-that:there:is some inherent prejudice in. joining perjury
and.related counts with substantive charges hasbeen widely rejected.” Polamitis, 739'F.2d at 791.
And.courts routinely hold that there:is no prejudice’where the evidence. in support of the two counts

is “interconnected.” Blakney, 941, F:2d at 116;.see Carson, 464 F.2d at 436.(“[ T]he commonality:
