WI. The indictment is timely

A. The indictment compliés with the statute of limitations

Eederal law imposes.a five-year limitations. period for. most non-capital offenses. .18
UIS-C. § 3282(a). Recognizing the difficulty of promptly prosecuting crimes against children,
physical, abuse, or,kidnaping” of a minor. 18U.S.C. § 3283. Until 2003, the operative version
of § 3283 allowed prosecution of these offenses ‘until the'victim reached the age of twenty-five.
‘Congress further extended:the limitations period in the PROTECT. Act of 2003, Pub..L. No. 108-
21, 117 Stat. 650, to allow prosecution.any time during the life of the-victim.

The parties agree that.the: Mann Act charges are timely if subject.to, the PROTECT Act,
but untimely-under the general statute ‘of limitations for non-capital offenses.or the pre-2003
version of § 3283. Maxwell, contends that the charged offenses do not: qualify as offenses
involving the sexual or physical. abusé or kidnapping of'a minor-and are thus governed by the
general statute of limitations. Alternatively, she contends that the pre-2003 version ‘of § 3283
applics because the charged conduct: occurred prior to 2003. ‘The Court.concludes that statute! of
limitations in the PROTECT. Act applies and that the charges are timely:

1. The Mann Act charges are offenses involving the sexual abuse of minors

Maxwell docs not dispute that the facts alleged in. the SI superséding indictment: involve
the:scxual abuse of:minors. The indictment charges that Epstein sexually abused ‘cach of the
alleged minor victims ‘and that Maxwell_allegedly enticed'them.to travel. ortransported them:for
that purpose. Instead, Maxwell contends that charged. offenses do. not qualify as offenses.
involving the sexual abuse ‘of minors because sexual abuse:is not an ‘essential ingredient of each

statutory offense. See Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209, 221 (1953). In Maxwell’s view,
