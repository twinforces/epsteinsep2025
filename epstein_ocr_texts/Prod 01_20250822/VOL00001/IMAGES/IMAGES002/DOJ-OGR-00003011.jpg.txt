to the extent the passage of time affects the memories of witnesses who testify at, trial, the
defendant, will have an opportunity to cross-examine such. witnesses. See United States v.
Harrison, 764 F. Supp. 29, 32 (S:D-N-Y. 1991) (noting that “the passage: of time does affect.
witnesses’ memories and it may be relevant to the credibility of ‘their testimony” and. ‘that; the
Government also faces potential harms from 'the:passage of timc).'* Accordingly, the defendant's
bald. assertions regarding diminished memorics:of potential ‘witnesses are speculative and, thus,
fall short of the proof of actual ‘prejudice required by the Supreme Court’s, standard. in.Marion.
The defendant also claims that because of the delay in the: prosecution, she does not have
access to certain exculpatory documentary evidence. (Def. Mot. 7 at. 12-14). Once again, this
argument is entirely speculative. The defendant. hypothesizes that.if she had access: to cértain
documentary: evidence (some of which, such as travel ‘records, has been produced ‘in. discovery),
or evidence which, she: herself ‘should ‘have access to (¢.g., her own emails from, 1994 to 1997, her:
own. phone records from 1994 to 1997, and. her own. travel records ‘from :1994 to 1997), this
‘evidence would ‘have helped ‘her. She offers no'proofor basis for concluding that the records
‘would be helpful. Even.if such records were helpful, dismissal of the Indictment would be too
extreme a. measure in light of the relative significance. of'this form of evidence to other proof:in.
the case. Thus, the defendant’s claim, that she no longer has access to certain. evidence is. not, a.
‘proper basis. to dismiss the Indictment. See Wnited. Statés’v. Dornait, 356 E. Supp. 1091, 1094

(S.D-N.Y. [973) (“A-bare allegation that records have been, lost.or destroyed, which might relate:

'® The Government. notes that. it: faccs the same ‘potential harms from the ‘passage of time as docs
any party, including loss of witnesses through:death.or disappearance, diminishment.of memoriés
over the passage of time, and loss of evidence. —The Government, of course, bears the burden. of
proof: at trial, and as such, prosccutors have ‘every. incentive to bring cascs:as promptly: as possible,

when ‘memorics are fresh:and, when it is possible to identify corroborating witnesses and, records.

Any suggestion that:the: Government delayed bringing‘the instant case for over two decades'for its
own. benefit.or a ‘tactical advantage borders on the absurd.
