Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 366 Filed 10/22/21 Page4of6
anything that has anything at all to do with this case or anyone involved in the case. You are not
to discuss this case among yourselves, you are not to discuss it with anyone, including your
family, friends, anyone. You may say that you are part of the jury selection process in a criminal
case in federal court, but that is all you may say. Moreover, you are not to do any research
through any means about the case or anyone involved in it. That includes the defendant, it
includes the judge, it includes the lawyers, and it includes any other names you hear about today.
And it means, among other things, that you are not to chatter about it on Facebook, Twitter,
Instagram, Tiktok, Snapchat, or any other social media services. You are not to read anything
about it online or in the paper. You are not to watch or listen to anything about it on television,
the radio, or on podcasts. You are not to do a Google search or any other kind of search. You
may not do any of that and that is very important. As I am sure you understand, we must ensure
that we have a jury of citizens who will decide the issues in this case based only on the evidence
that is presented in court during the trial.

Because this is a high-profile case AND because we are still in the age of COVID, I want
to assure you that the Court will take a number of steps to protect your privacy and safety. First,
when you are filling out the questionnaire and as we go through the later stages of the process, I
ask that you please not identify yourself by your name or identify anyone you are associated with
by name. Throughout the selection process and if you are selected as a juror, although the
lawyers and I will know your names, we will only refer to you in Court by your juror number.
This will protect your privacy.

Second, due to COVID and to ensure easy access into and out of the Courthouse, the
Court will arrange and provide transportation for selected jurors to and from the Courthouse
every day of trial.
