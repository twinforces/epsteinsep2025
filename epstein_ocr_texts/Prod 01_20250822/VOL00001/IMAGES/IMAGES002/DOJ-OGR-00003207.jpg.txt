Kirkland & Ellis, which was representing Epstein, because Acosta had begun discussions with the
firm about possible employment.

After leaving the USAO in June 2009, Acosta became the Dean of the Florida International
University College of Law. In April 2017, Acosta became the U.S. Secretary of Labor, but he
resigned from that post effective July 19, 2019, following public criticism of the USAO’s handling
of the Epstein case.

Jeffrey H. Sloman joined the USAO in 1990 as a line AUSA. In 2001, he became Deputy
Chief of the USAO’s Fort Lauderdale branch office Narcotics and Violent Crimes Section, and in
2003, became the Managing AUSA for that branch office. In early 2004, Sloman was appointed
Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division. In October 2006, Sloman became the FAUSA, and
Sloman’s office was located with Acosta’s in the Miami office’s executive suite.

As FAUSA, Sloman was responsible for supervising the Civil, Criminal, and Appellate
Divisions, and he was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation.
Although Sloman had relatively little involvement in the decisions and negotiations that led to the
NPA and did not review it before it was signed, he personally negotiated an addendum to the NPA,
which he signed on behalf of the USAO in October 2007. After subordinates Matthew Menchel
and Andrew Lourie left the USAO, Sloman directly engaged with the line AUSA, Marie Villafafia,
on Epstein matters, and participated in meetings and other communications with defense counsel.
After Acosta was formally recused from the Epstein matter in December 2008, Sloman became
the senior USAO official supervising the matter. When Acosta left the USAO, Sloman became
the Acting U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, and in January 2010, the Attorney
General appointed Sloman to be the Interim U.S. Attorney for the district. Sloman left the USAO
to enter private practice in June 2010.

Matthew I. Menchel joined the USAO in 1998 after having served as a New York County
(Manhattan) Assistant District Attorney for 11 years. After several years as a line AUSA, Menchel
became Chief of the USAO’s Major Crimes Section. In October 2006, Menchel became the Chief
of the USAO’s Criminal Division, based in Miami. As Criminal Division Chief, Menchel was
part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein investigation, and he participated in meetings
and other communications with defense counsel. Menchel participated in the decision to extend a
two-year state-based plea proposal to Epstein and communicated it to the defense. Shortly after
that plea offer was extended to Epstein in early August 2007, and before the precise terms of the
NPA were negotiated with defense counsel, Menchel left the USAO to enter private practice.

Andrew C. Lourie joined the USAO as a line AUSA in 1994, after having served for three
years as an AUSA in New Jersey. During his 13-year tenure at the USAO, Lourie served two
terms on detail as the Acting Chief of the Department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity
Section, first from September 2001 until September 2002, and then from February 2006 until July
2006. Between those two details, and again after his return to the USAO in July 2006, Lourie was
a Deputy Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, serving as the Managing AUSA for the West
Palm Beach branch office. Lourie was part of the supervisory team that oversaw the Epstein
investigation and negotiated the NPA, participating in meetings and other communications with
defense counsel. During September 2007, while the NPA was being negotiated, Lourie
transitioned out of the USAO to serve on detail as the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General
