and. had added. language waiving the ‘preparation. of, a. presentence investigation (PSI) ‘ ‘so ‘he ‘can,
keep all-of his information confidential. I have already told Jay that. the PSI language ... was
‘unacceptable to our office.” Of even greater’ significance, ‘in. a follow-up email, Villafafia noted,
that the defense had removed both the requirement that Epstein plead to.a tegistrable. offense, and
the entire provision relating to monctary damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255. —

Inthe afternoon,, Villafafia, circulated. ‘her own proposed. “hybrid” plea agreement, first.
internally’to, the management tcam ‘with a:note' stating that: it “contains the 18/12 split that Jay. and
Andy agreed 'to,” and. ‘then to Lefkowitz. Regarding the proscéution of other individuals, she
included the following provision: “This.agrecment resolves ‘the federal criminal liability ofthe
defendant and any: co- conspirators in the Southern ‘District of Florida g growing ‘out of any criminal,
conduct by: those ‘persons ‘known to the [USAO] as of the date of this plea agreement,” ‘including
but. not limited 'to, the conspiracy to solicit minors to cngage in prostitution.

In her email. to Lefkowitz, transmitting the plea agreement, Villafafia wrote:

attorneys to work, on the:plea agreement, and asking , if Acosta:would be available to. provide final
approval. Acosta.replicd, “I don’t think.I should be'part of:negotiations. I’d-rather lcave it to you,
if that’s ok.” Acosta, told OPR that: “absent truly exceptional circumstances,” he believed it was
important ‘for him. “to not get involved” in negotiations, and added, “You. éan:mect, like I did in.
September, [to] reaffirm the position of the office, [and] back your AUSA, but ultimately, I think:
your trial lawyer needs diserction to do their job.” Villafafia told OPR, however, that:she did not
understand Acosta:to be giving her discretion to conduct.the negotiations as she:saw fit; rather, she
believed Acosta did not want to engage in face-to-face: negotiations because “he wanted ‘to have
