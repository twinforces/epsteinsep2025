Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21. Page 260 of 349

[My expectation of whatwas going [to] happen at the plea was that
it would’be like:a, federal plea where'there: would be a factual proffer,
that:;:was read, and where the judge would ask. ‘if there were any
victims present who' wanted to be heard, and that at'that pointif.Brad
Edwards wanted to address. the court or if his clients wanted. to
address the court, they*would. be given, the opportunity to do: so.3*7

Sloman told OPR that he didnot recall directing Villafafia to contact anyone about the'plea,
hearing or directing her specifically not. to, contact. anyone about it. Acosta told OPR. that he
belicved the state would notify the victims of the “all-encompassing plca” resolving the federal
case “and [the victims would] have: an opportunity ‘to speak ‘up at the state: court hearing.”
Nevertheless, Acosta, did. not know whether the state victims overlapped with the federal ‘victims
or whether the USAO “shared that list with them.” ‘Villafafia told OPR. that ‘she and, Acosta,
“understood that the state would notify the state victims” but that neither of them were:aware “that.
the state.only belicved ‘they had one victim. 358 “Willafafia told OPR that there. was “very little”
communication between the USAO and the State: Attorncy’s Office, and, although she discussed a
factual, proffer with the State: Attorncy’s Office and “the fact'that:. . . the federal investigation had.
identified additional victims,” she did not recall discussing “who the: specific people were'that they
considered. victims, in the state case.”*°”

Sloman.told OPR. that the “public perception. . . that. we:tried.to hide the fact of thecresults
‘of this resolution from the victims” was incorrect. He explained:

[E]ven though we didn’t have a, Icgal obligation, | felt that. the
victims. Were going 'to be notified aiid the state Was going . . . to
fulfill. that. opgation. and even as: another. failsafe, [the victims]
would be: notified of. . . the restitution mechanism that ‘we had sct
up on their behalf,

Sloman acknowledged. that although neither the NPA terms nor the CVRA prevented the USAO
from exercising its: discretion to notify the victims,

it was [of] concern that this was going. to break down.and. . result
in ‘us ‘prosecuting Epstein, and that the victims were going to be
witnesses and if we provided. a'victim notification indicating, hey,
you're going to get. $150,000, ‘that’s . . . going, to ‘be instant
