Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 194 of 348

Lourie described the promise not to ‘prosecute “potential, co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told.
OPR'that:he did not-know why it; was.included.in,the: agreement, but added that it; would. be “unlike
mceif I read that, language to just.leave it. in thereunless, 1 thought:it-was somchow helpful.” Lourie
posited that victims who recruited. other underage: girls ‘to provide, massages ‘for Epstein.
. ‘theoretically” could have been charged.as co-conspirators. He told OPR. that when. he saw the
provision, he: may have: understood the: reference: to ‘unnamed “‘co- conspirators” as “a message to
any’victims that, had recruited other victims that.there was no intent to charge them.”

Acosta did not recall any’ discussions about the non-prosecution provision. But he, told.
OPR that Epstcin:was always * “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would have viewed
the federal interests as ‘vindicated as long: as’ Epstein, was required. to face “meaningful
consequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR. that when he reviewed. the draft. NPA, “[t]o the
extent [reviewed this, co-conspirator‘provision, I can speculate that: my thinking'would. have been
the focus ‘is on Epstein[ ].. . going to jail. Whether some.of his employees. go to. jail, or other,
lesser involved [individuals], is not the: focus ofthis.” Acosta also toldOPR that he assumed
Villafafia ‘and. Louric had. considered. the provision. and. decided that it was appropriate. Finally,
Sloman, who'was not ‘involved. in negotiating the NPA, told-OPR. that in retrospect, he understood.
the non-prosccution, provision. was designed, to protect; Epstcin’s ‘four assistants, and.it. “never
dawried” on. him that it was intended. to shield anyone else.

This broad provision. promising not: ‘to prosccute * “any potential co-conspirators” is
troubling:and, as discussed.more fully later in this Report, OPR did not find-evidence showing that.
the subjects gave careful, consideration 'to the potential scope of the provision or whether it was
warranted. ever that the investigation had, been. curtailed and the USAO: lackéd complete

time, the subjects believed that was the purpose. “However, the USAO had not, indicated interest.
in,prosecuting anyone other ‘than the four ‘named. female assistants, and OPR. found no record.
‘indicating that, Epstcin had expressed concern. about the prosccutive fate of anyone other than the
four assistants and. unnamed cmployces of a specific Epstein company. Accordingly, OPR.
concludes that ‘the cvidence does. not.:show ‘that. Acosta, Louric, or Villafafia. agreed tothe non-
prosecution, provision to protect any of Epstcin’s political, cclcbrity, or other influcntial
associates.”

H. OPR’s Investigation Did Not Reveal Evidence Establishing That Epstein
Cooperated in Other Federal Investigations or Received Special Treatment:on
That Basis.

One ‘final issuc.OPR explored stemmed from. media reports suggesting, that. Epstein may
have: received. special treatment from the USAO in. return for his :cooperation. in another. federal

‘As prey tously: stated, Sloman'was on v acation’ when Villafafia:ineluded the provision in draft: plea agreements
and did not: monitor'the case or comment:on’the various itcrations:of the: NPA that were;eirculated during his absence.
Menchel left the’ USAO on.August 3, 2007, before the;parties drafted the NPA.
