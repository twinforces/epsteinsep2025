Contrary’ to BSF’s assertion, the, EVCP is not “mere? impeachment:material; itis Brady:
material that the government would be required to turn over iftin thei? possession. The
government;knows that.it “is under no obligation,to: turn, over that which it does not!have,”

depends almost-entircly: on the uncorroborated testimony: of the accusers, “impeachment”
evidence is material and discoverable ‘in, advance of trial. As discussed, in Poveniud'v. Citof
