trial and, free up time for the'defense to prepare for a trial that, includes the new: allegations and.
charges in. the $2. Indictment. Although the defense: has ¢xpressed, concéms that trial on the S2
Indictment would be excessively long, and.that the:defense would nced. additional time to prepare
for trial, balanced, against the two counts added by the: $2 ‘Indictment are the two perjury counts
severed by the Court’s April 1.6,.2021, opinion.and order. (Dkt..No. 207). In-other ‘words, the
defense has ‘long maintained that the perjury counts would substantially cxpand the scope of the
‘trial, but those counts ‘will no longer be at: issuc’ during trial in, July.

As the Court:may recall, in the defense’s view; the Mann Act and perjury counts involved
at most. “some minimal amount of overlapping evidence,” which was “far outweighed b[y] the
much. larger :inefficicnéy of substantially lengthening and, complicating the trial.” (Dkt. No. 120
at 12). According to the defense, a trial including the perjury counts would. have: “necessarily
involve[d] litigating’ a complicated dcfamation-action within,a,criminal trial,” and possibly require:
‘resolution of “[a]pproximately 50 substantive motions” and, “evidentiary challenges to thousands
of deposition:questions and. answers containcd in dozens of. bankers boxes.” (/d. at 9-10, 12). The
defense.'also identified more than.a, dozen, arcas of evidence: that it claimed would, be ‘part of the
perjury trial, including “how discovery’ is. obtained” in civil litigation, “[t]he testimony often. to
fifteen other witnesses including fact and expert-witnesses” on,materiality, and “(t]he testimony of
Ms. Maxwell’s, lawyers.” (Dkt No. 224 at 7-8). As a result, in, the defenise’s ‘view, 1f the perjury’
counts were tried together with the Mann.Act counts, “this criminal trial. will. be subsumed by
evidence not:relevant to the main, charges, the Mann,Act Counts.” (/d. at,8).

The Government has never understood the perjury courts to require the resolution of

dozens of. motions from. the civil. case.or the trial testimony of dozens of witnesses above and.
