First, the Court’s recent decision to sever the perjury counts will both shorten the upcoming
trial and free up time for the defense to prepare for a trial that includes the new allegations and
charges in the S2 Indictment. Although the defense has expressed concerns that trial on the S2
Indictment would be excessively long, and that the defense would need additional time to prepare
for trial, balanced against the two counts added by the S2 Indictment are the two perjury counts
severed by the Court’s April 16, 2021 opinion and order. (Dkt. No. 207). In other words, the
defense has long maintained that the perjury counts would substantially expand the scope of the
trial, but those counts will no longer be at issue during trial in July.

As the Court may recall, in the defense’s view, the Mann Act and perjury counts involved
at most “some minimal amount of overlapping evidence,” which was “far outweighed b[y] the
much larger inefficiency of substantially lengthening and complicating the trial.” (Dkt. No. 120
at 12). According to the defense, a trial including the perjury counts would have “necessarily
involve[d] litigating a complicated defamation action within a criminal trial,” and possibly require
resolution of “[a]pproximately 50 substantive motions” and “evidentiary challenges to thousands
of deposition questions and answers contained in dozens of bankers boxes.” (/d. at 9-10, 12). The
defense also identified more than a dozen areas of evidence that it claimed would be part of the
perjury trial, including “how discovery is obtained” in civil litigation, “[t]he testimony of ten to
fifteen other witnesses including fact and expert witnesses” on materiality, and “[t]he testimony of
Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers.” (Dkt No. 224 at 7-8). As a result, in the defense’s view, if the perjury
counts were tried together with the Mann Act counts, “this criminal trial will be subsumed by
evidence not relevant to the main charges, the Mann Act Counts.” (/d. at 8).

The Government has never understood the perjury counts to require the resolution of
dozens of motions from the civil case or the trial testimony of dozens of witnesses above and
