10 VII case where there were emotional distress damages being

13 time she was born to the present. We met and conferred on two
14 hours on their discovery requests, your Honor. We agreed to

16 2002 and anything else we had that was related to the sexual

21 in their production. Should they be entitled to things that
22 happened prior to that? Absolutely not, your Honor. They are
23. not entitled to a full-scale production of everything that's
24 happened in this young lady's life. She was abused by these
25 individuals. She shouldn't be reabused by having to disclose
