to justify the relevance of that evidence; she does not.claim, for‘instance, that that. cvidence is
exculpatory or that the evidence is otherwise relevant to her defense. Furthermore, Maxwell
docs not attempt to justify the relevance of.a// of the: requested materials. The very:nature of the
request evinces that it seeks considerable amounts of physical evidence, and the only thing tying
the evidenée together is that Subpocna Reeipient-2. may have shown that cvidence to certain
attorneys at some point. To'prevail under Nixon, however, a movant.must show why a// of the
requested evidence is ‘relevant. United States v. Pena, No. 15=CR=551.(AJN), 2016 WL
8735699, at *2(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 12, 2016). That is not.the case here.

The request thus fails because Maxwell has not,established the relevance of all of these
‘materials. The most she can muster‘is that some of it md be relevant for impeachnient purposes,
if Subpoena-Recipient-2 is called to testify. On that basis alone, the request fails. In addition,
the third request separately fails because it amounts to nothing more than.a fishing expedition.

As aresult, the request for authorization of a ‘Rule 1,7(c) subpoena:to: Subpoena
Recipicnt=2 is DENIED.

The final two requests for authorization of Rule’ 17(c) subpocnas—one relating to
Subpocna.Recipiént-3, the other to Subpoena Recipicnt-4—are the same. The first five requests
in. both of these proposed subpoenas concern communications regarding mectings with the
