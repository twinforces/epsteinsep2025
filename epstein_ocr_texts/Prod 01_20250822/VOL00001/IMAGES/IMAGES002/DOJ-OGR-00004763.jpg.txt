1 on full quarantine and full isolation and said I was not going

2 to be able to use the phone because I was infected.

3 During the lockdown and the time that I was in SHU, I

4 was without a cup to drink water. I was fed frozen boxes of

5 baloney sandwiches that most of the time came molded because it

6 was expired. They gave us frozen peanut butter, lunch and

7 dinner, jelly sandwiches that were frozen -- they hurt your

8 teeth -- potato chips that had expiration dates of 2019.

9 At MCC, no matter how much I complained or told them
10 the pain that I was going through, nobody cared. I was left in
11 the SHU cell and people would just come by to see the person
12 that was sick from Covid. They wasn't trying to help me. They
13 just wanted to see who was the person in the cell that was
14 infected so they know who to stay away from. The solitude of
15 lockdown drove me insane, and came to the point that I started
16 talking to myself and seeing shadows.

17 After being transferred to MDC Brooklyn, I was tested
18 for Covid-19, and I tested positive again in December 2020. I
19 was put in SHU for five days. I was there for five days, ona
20 23-hour lockdown, handcuffed to come out and shower, fed
21 through a hole in the door, in a cell with no windows, mentally
22 broken inside out again.
23 Later, they came back and said it was a false
24 positive. Anytime the doctors called me for anything, I'm
25 paranoid, I'm nervous, my hands start sweating, I get dry
