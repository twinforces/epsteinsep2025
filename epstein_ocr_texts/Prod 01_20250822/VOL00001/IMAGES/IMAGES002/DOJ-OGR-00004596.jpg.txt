argued that.Acosta.should have been able to.rcly on his staff to accomplish the victim notification,
task, and thus had.‘no responsibility to personally confirm. that ‘Chicf Reiter would notify the:
victims of the hearing. ”* Acosta is correct: that ‘under ‘usual circumstances, USAO management.
played. no role iin. the ‘victim :notification process; however, :in this. case, the issue. of! victim.
notification. had been elevated. from a rote administrative task to a major-arca of dispute with the
defense, Acosta, personally involved ‘himself by resolving: the notification dispute with, defense:
counsel ‘in, his Decemiber 19, 2007 letter. Villafafia provided Acosta, with a. draft. letter to state
officials that would. have opened a.dialogue concerning the notification of all the victims identified,
in. the ‘federal investigation. OPR. found ‘no evidenee, however, that: Acosta sent the letter or any
similar communication to the State Attorney’s Office or that he provided Villafaia and Sloman.
with instructions concerning. victim notification. other than those contained in. his December 19,

2007 letter. Having inserted himsclf into the notification process, Acosta. had.a responsibility fo
ensure that his expectation, that the victims would be notified could be accomplished through ‘the:
state process.

Many victims only learned of Epstcin’s state court pleas when they later received a letter
from the USAO. informing them that:thosc ‘pleas had. resolved the federal. investigation, and. some
victims only learned of the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In, the end,
although Villafafia arid Slomaii hastily attempted to censure victim notification. through Chicf
Reiter, their effort’ Was ‘too little and too late to, ensure. that Victims had the. opportunity to attend,
the plea. hearing or were given, sufficient. information about its significance to their own. cases?”
Although Acosta may’have conferred with others about the decision,to: defer the responsibility for
notifying victims.to the State Attorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.
OPR concludes that under thesce*unique circumstances, its, criticisms are warranted because Acosta,
personally decided to change the process initiated by‘his staff, arid, although he expected that the
federal victims would be notified, he did:not take:the necessary. ‘steps to ensure: that they would be.
Acosta ‘could. have authorized disclosure of the: plea. nearing: to victims, even, if he did not belicve:
the CVRA required. it, to ensure that. the victims identified in.the federal ‘investigation were aware
of the state court: proceeding. ‘Because the:state pleas cnded:the federal investigation into, Epstcin’s
conduct, ensuring that the victims were ‘notified of the state plea hearing would have been
consistent with. the Department’s: overarching commitment to treat victims with fairness, dignity,
and sensitivity. Acosta’s failure to prioritize:notification and coordinate communication about the:

wee As noted, in-his comments on OPR’s draft report; Acosta’s counsel, strongly: ‘objected. to OPR’s' finding of

‘poor judgment with respect to v. ictim notification, arguing that OPR.“unw arr antedly-applics: a. standard never before
expected of, any US Attorney?” and. inappropriately criticizes, Acosta for “not personally: confirming ‘that the State
Attorney had the:information.needed™ to notify the-vietims and for“notypersonally confirming” that, Chief’ Reiter ‘had,
actually notified ‘the victims: For-the reasons discussed, the Issue is not: Whether, Acosta ‘ “personally” ‘took: certain,
specific, steps but that he stepped his:staff from. implementing wnotification plan theyhad devised, and instead, shifted.
responsibility for notification,to:another entity while failing-to consider how. or:even. whether ‘that: entity: would beable
‘to accomplish: the notification: that Acosta-expected to‘happen:

9 OPR. notes that Villafafia contacted Reiter‘soon.after'the state plea hearing was’ scheduled, and the resulting
window of time for Reiter'to make: any: notifications was short. ‘Had/the USAO coordinated with the: State Attorney:
at:some, point in time closer’to Acosta’s: December. 19» 2007 letter and :decision, the USAO could ‘have ensured that:
the, State,Attorney had an appropriate notification, process: in place:to act:quickly-when the hearing was-scheduled.and
that: issues coneerning the; victims® appearance at the; hearing were appropriately considered by. state, authorities.

Similarly; if the USAO believed that‘Reiter should makethe notifications,:it could have;coordinated with 'Reiter:in'the
