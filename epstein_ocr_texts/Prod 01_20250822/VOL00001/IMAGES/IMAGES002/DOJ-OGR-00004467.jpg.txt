2 The Subjects Asserted. That They: Were Motivated by ‘Reasonable
Strategic and, Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences

In. addition to: reviewing’ the documentary’ evidence, OPR questioned the five ‘subject.
attorneys, all of whom denied. being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth. or'status in making:
decisions ‘regarding the. investigation, in. the decision to resolve the case: through an NPA, or in.
negotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal
investigation that Epstein. ‘might, try to employ against. the USAO the same pressure that. she
‘understood had been used with. ‘the State Attorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to
counter Epstein’s possible influence by ‘meeting with Acosta and. Sloman to sensitize them to
Epstein’s tactics. Both Acosta-and Sloman.told OPR:that'the USAO had handled cases involving.
wealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. Acosta. told OPR, “[Wc:
tricd to:treat [the:case] fairly, not looking: at .... how’wealthy is he, but also not saying we nced to
do this because he:is:so wealthy.” Menchel. expressed a similar view, telling OPR that he did not.
believe “it’s. appropriate to. go after somebody because of their status oneway'or the other.” Lourie
told, OPR. that Epstcin’s status may have g generated" more “front. office” involvement in. the case,
but it did:not affect the outcome, and. Sloman “emphatically disagrec[d]” with the suggestion: that
the USAO’s handling of the case had been affected-by Epstein’ s wealth or influential connections.
Other, witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony on this point, including the FBI case agents,
who told OPR that.no one: cver communicated to them that ‘they ‘should treat; Epstein differently
because of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he ad not. ‘tecall anyone at the USAO

and. ‘nflucace:

OPR ‘takes note: of. but; does not: consider dispositive the absence of ‘any affirmative
evidence that the subjects were acting from impropér motivations or their denial of such
motivations. Of more significance, and as. discussed more fully below, Was the fact ‘that.
‘contemporancous, records: support the subjects” assertions that the: decision to pursuc a pre- -charge
resolution. was ‘bascd on ‘various case-specific legal and ‘factual considerations.2'* OPR. also

Inthe pre-NPA letter to the USAO, counsel:recited a:litany-of Epstein’s: ‘purported g good deeds and charitable
works, ‘including. a trip Epstein: took.to:. Africa with: former President Clinton;to raise awareness of, AIDS, and counsel,
also, noted, that ‘the former President; had been, quoted by New York Magazine. describing Epstein, as “ta committed,

OPR. also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the! factors
