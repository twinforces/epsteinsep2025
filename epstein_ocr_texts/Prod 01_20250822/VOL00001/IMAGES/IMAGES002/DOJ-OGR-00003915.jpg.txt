Pursuant to the Court’s Opinion and Order, dated April 16,2021 (Dkt.:207), we write to
inform the Court that the defense:agrecs that Ms. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the S1 superseding.
indictment on. the grounds that it was.rcturned by a grand jury sitting at the White Plains
courthouse, (Dkt. 125) is now moot in. light of the fact'that.a grand jury sitting im Manhattan
retumed the S2 superseditig indictment.
