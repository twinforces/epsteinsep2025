and successfully pushed back against the government’s attempts to limit the scope of the
provision. Epstein’s lawyers, in fact, insisted on a proposal that would have immunized the four
individuals, “any employee” of one of Epstein’s companies, and “any unnamed co-conspirators
for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” OPR Report at 166
n.237. Defense counsel’s efforts were in line with their representations to the government that
Epstein “wanted to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame for what happened.”
Id. at 167 (internal quotations omitted). When the government “finally revised” the language to
the provision that appears in the signed NPA, it obviously acceded to defense’s counsel’s desire
to leave open the possibility that other “potential co-conspirators” might someday have occasion
to invoke the immunity provision. /d. at 166.

In addition to being irrelevant, the government’s argument that Ms. Maxwell had largely
escaped its attention at the time of the NPA is demonstrably incorrect. The government’s own
file demonstrates that the FBI had interviewed Accuser-2° in 2006 (Opp. 16 n.9; Dkt. 148, Ex. B
(sealed)), and thus had obviously learned of Accuser-2’s claims regarding Ms. Maxwell now
included in the Indictment. Indeed, an internal FBI document expressly names Ms. Maxwell as
one of the individuals that the FBI’s Miami office “began investigating” in 2006 as part of the
investigation that led to the NPA. (See Ex. A). Thus, the government was clearly aware of Ms.
Maxwell at the time it executed the NPA and agreed to extend the immunity provision to “any
potential co-conspirators.” She is covered by the NPA.

As a third party immunized by the NPA, Ms. Maxwell has third-party beneficiary status
to enforce it. While the government cites United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d 182 (2d Cir. 2019),
for the proposition that “plea agreements differ from commercial contracts” (Opp. 18), the
“differ[ence]” to which the Second Circuit was referring was that in construing a plea agreement,
* Accuser-2 is identified in the Indictment as Minor Victim-2.
