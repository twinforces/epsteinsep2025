and. successfully pushed back. against. the government’s attempts to limit:the scope of the
provision. .Epstein’s lawyers, in fact, insisted.on a'proposal that: would have immunized the four
individuals, “any employee” of one.of Epstein’s companies, and.‘any unnamed. co-conspirators.
for, any’ criminal charge that ‘arises out;:of the ongoing federal investigation.” OPR. Report;at: 166
