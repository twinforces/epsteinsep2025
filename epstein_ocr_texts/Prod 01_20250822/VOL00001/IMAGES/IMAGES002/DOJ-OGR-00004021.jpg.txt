Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 248 Filed 04/26/21 Page 4 of9
LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C: STERNHEIA\

Ms. Maxwell no longer fcels'that; her legal. papers. are safe: and belicves that the
confidentiality required to prepare her defense for‘trial has been:irreparably. breached. She is
justifiably concerned 'that-her defense documents and their contents have been improperly
reviewed and disseminated. The: fact that the g guards did not confront counsel but chose: to
her : suspicion ‘and that of her counsel. In.addition, Ms. Maxwell is fearful that she will be subject
to retaliation, bascless allegations, and unwarranted. and ‘unprovoked. discipline.

Ms. Maxwell is.an indicted pre-trial. detainee who has asserted her right to counsel. Once
the right to ‘counsel has attached and is asserted, as is the case here, the government must honor
‘it. This means more than that the government “cannot prevent the accused, from obtaining the
assistance of counsel. The Sixth Amendment.also imposes on, the goyernment.an affirmative
obligation to réspect and:préserve the accused's choice to seck this assistance.” Maine 'v.
Moulton, 474°US. 159,170-71 (1985).

The actions’ by the: MD€ guards violated ‘Ms. ‘Maxwell’s Sixth Amendment right to:
effective assistance of counsel. Without any justifiable cause they 'seized.and inspected Icgal,
matcrials, failed to identify’the materials seized, and'withheld the materials, for improper
purposes. Ms. Maxwell docs. not know if the matcrials’were ‘duplicated in some fashion, /.e.,
photocopied, scanned, or photographed. She docs not.know whether the MDC plans to’ give any.
of these: privileged. and confidential materials orthe information contained therein:to the
‘prosecution or lcak them, to the press. And, ; given, the prior treatment.of Ms. Maxwell’s HIPPA-
‘protected medical information, these concerns are ‘warranted.

Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court enter an. order directing that the MDC, through. its
egal counscl. and/or warden, to provide to Ms. Maxwell’s attorneys, only,’the following,
‘information:

a the identity of the person or persons who scized the legal material;

a an.ifiventory of the items seized;

® a:statement, subject. to penalty of perjury, regarding ‘whether the materials were
duplicated in any fashion; and

© whether any disciplinary or corrective action,was taken against ‘any ofthe offending
guards.

Very truly yours,

BOBBI CGC. STERNHEIM.
