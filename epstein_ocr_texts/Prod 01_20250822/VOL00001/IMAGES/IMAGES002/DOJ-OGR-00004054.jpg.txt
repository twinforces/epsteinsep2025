Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell

‘Dear Judge Nathan:

During: oral, argument of Ghislaine Maxwell’s bail appeal before. the Circuit, Ms.
Maxwell’s: appellate counsel ‘expressed concern that she was improperly:deprived of sleep.while
detained in,the MDC, an, issue:that’has been raiscd in filings before this Court. In its bricf denial.
of her appeal, the Circuit stated: “To the extent. Appellant sccks relicf specific to her:slecping
conditions, such:request should be! addressed to the District Court.” See Exhibit A. We press our
concerns regarding disruption of Ms. Maxwell’s slecp andthe deleterious effect. sleep
deprivation :is having, on-her. health, well-being, and ability‘to prepare for and: withstand. trial.

Ms. Maxwell continues to be disrupted throughout the night by guards, shining a
flash/strobe light into her cell, claiming that.her breathing must. be checked. The myth that Ms.
Maxwell’s, conditions of confinement are rclated'to her being a sticide:risk ‘was laid to rest
during the oral.argument: There is:nothing to support that contrived claim. -In fact, Ms. Maxwell.
is Classificd with the standard C@1-Mh, designation: inmate with no significant mental health
care. (See Dkt. 159 at,3.)

Contrary to the report that Ms. Maxwell “wears.an cye mask when she slecps” (Dkt. 196
at.4), an item neither available for purchase: through. MDC ‘commissary: nor. provided to her, she
resorts to using a'sock.or towel to cover her eyes in an, awkward attempt to shicld them:from
disrupting illumination every 1S minutes. Last. night, she was confronted by. MDC staff duc a.
surveillance (except when auards ¢ elect to exert authority: it in an intimidating: way off-camera, as
they did in.Saturday’s bathroom:incident), no guard. addressed the bruise-until. Ms. Maxwell, who
has no mirror, caught.a reflection of her aching, eye in.the: glean. of a nail.clipper. At that point,
MDC staff'confronted.Ms. Maxwell regarding the source of the bruise; threatening to place her
‘in. the SHU if:she did not:reveal how she got it: While Ms. Maxwell is:unaware of the cause of
the bruise, as réported to medical. and.psych staff, she has grown increasingly reluctant’to report
information to. the ¢ guards for fearof retaliation, discipline, atid :punitive, chores. However, there
is concern.that the: bruise may be related. to the nced. for:Ms. Maxwell to shield her eyes from the
lights: projected. into her‘cell throughout the night.
