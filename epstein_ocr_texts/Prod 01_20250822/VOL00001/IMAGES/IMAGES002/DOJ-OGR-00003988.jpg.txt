Re: = United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20'Cr: 330 (AJN)
Request: for Adjournment of 120 or 180 Days for Trial.on ‘the Non-Perjury Counts

Dear Judge Nathan:

Pursuant-to the Court’s Orderof April, 20, 2012, counsel, for'Ghislaine Maxwell, move for.
a. continuance of the trial ofthe non-perjury counts. forthe. reasons sct forth below. ‘The S2
indictment'tripled the: scope ‘of the time frame at issuc and expanded both the scope and-type of
conduct: on trial, ‘necessitating a re-revicw: of millions of pages of discovery. (most of which. is not
OCR or-scarch capable), multiplying the type of experts needed for trial, and altering the
COVID-challenging worldwide investigation to.a,new set of hundreds of witnesses. Layered,
onto, this complexity, Ms. Maxwell still-has not been ‘provided an, opportunity. to. review the entire
sct of discovery provided last'November because:the government-provided. laptop:and hard-
drives are missing critical data and. software; even her:counsel is unable, to access significant
portions of the “old” discovery. Nor has:Ms. Maxwell been. affordéd.any opportunity to review
the “new” 20,000-plus pages of, essentially,.Brady material produced. last: week, by the
government. related to 225 nons-testifying witnesses. A continuance under these circumstances is

a:necessity for a fair trial on charges amounting to.a-potential life sentence.
