Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s Order dated
August 23, 2021, which directed the Government to propose and justify any requests for redaction
of the Court’s temporarily sealed August 13, 20201 Opinion and Order and the underlying motion
papers. (Dkt. No. 325). After reviewing the Court’s August 13 Opinion and Order, the
Government agrees with the defense that no redactions are necessary to that document and
accordingly has no objection to the public filing of that document in its entirety.

After reviewing the underlying motion papers, the Government respectfully submits that
portions of those papers should be redacted. With respect to Ms. Maxwell’s Second Ex Parte and
In Camera Motion for an Order Authorizing a Subpoena Pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3) (the
‘“Motion”), the Government respectfully submits that limited redactions are appropriate to protect
the privacy interests of victims who have not identified themselves on the record in this case and
the privacy interests of third parties referenced in the Motion. With respect to Exhibit 1 to the
Motion, the Government respectfully submits that the journal entries and photographs contained
in Exhibits A, B, and C to Exhibit 1 should be redacted in their entirety to protect the privacy
