Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 175 of 349

The USAO might have been able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues
presented by a federal prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have
prevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even after the NPA was negotiated, she repeatedly
recommended declaring Epstein in breach and proceeding with an indictment, because she
continued to have confidence in the case.”*? Oosterbaan and others also believed that the
government would succeed at trial. Furthermore, the victims were not a uniform group. Some of
them were afraid of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein
prosecuted, but even among those, it is not clear how many expressed a willingness to testify at a
trial; and still others provided information favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed
responsibility for deciding how to resolve the Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and
benefits of a trial versus those of a pre-charge disposition. His determination that a pre-charge
disposition was appropriate was not unreasonable under the circumstances.

Although evidentiary and witness issues explain the subject supervisors’ concerns about
winning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some sort of pre-charge
disposition, they do not fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue a state-based resolution as
opposed to a traditional federal plea agreement. OPR did not find in the contemporaneous records
a memorandum or other memorialization of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s decision to offer a
state-based resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 31, 2007.

According to Acosta, “In 2006, it would have been extremely unusual for any United States
Attorney’s Office to become involved in a state solicitation case, even one involving underage
teens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR that he
developed “a preference for deferring to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not
stepping on something that is a purely local matter, because we [didn’t] want bad precedent for
the sake of the larger human trafficking issue.” Acosta also told OPR that it was his understanding
that the PBPD would not have brought the case to federal investigators if the State Attorney’s
Office had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included jail time and sexual offender
registration. Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest
injustice” that, in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from the state’s original plea proposal.
Acosta acknowledged that if the investigation had begun in the federal system, he would not have
viewed the terms set out in the NPA as a satisfactory result, but it was adequate to serve as a
“backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,
“|encouraging the state to do a little bit more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the Epstein case
lay in “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,
and a potentially unfavorable outcome had to be “weighed against a certain plea with registration
that would make sure that the public knew that this person was a sex offender.”

Acosta told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman and Menchel, and both
told OPR that while they did not share Acosta’s federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had
the terms offered to the defense on July 31, 2007. Therefore, any allegations against the prosecutors could not have
played a significant role in Acosta’s decisions as reflected in the term sheet.

220 Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed in the case.”
