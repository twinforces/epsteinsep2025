Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell (“Ms. Maxwell”) files this Response in Opposition to
Plaintiff's Motion to Exceed Presumptive Ten Deposition Limit, and states as follows:

INTRODUCTION

Despite having taken only three depositions to date, Plaintiff prematurely requests
permission to exceed the presumptive ten deposition limit imposed by Fed. R. Civ. P.
30(a)(2)(A)(i) and to conduct 17 separate depositions, almost twice the limit. Without legal
support, Plaintiff attempts to conflate the presumptive time limitation for each deposition of
seven hours with a right to take a total of 70 hours of depositions. This is an absurd reading of
the Federal Rules. The presumptive ten deposition limitation is an independent limitation, and
speaks to the number of separate deponents, not deposition time. Indeed, the two independent
limitations do not even appear in the same section of the rules.

The heart of Plaintiffs argument is that Ms. Maxwell inconveniently testified and denied
Plaintiff's claims, rather than invoking the Fifth Amendment. This dashed Plaintiff's apparent
hope to obtain an adverse inference, rather than actually having to prove her case against Ms.
Maxwell. Instead, Ms. Maxwell fully testified for the entire 7 hours, responded to all questions
posed to her,' and testified based on her actual knowledge. Ms. Maxwell’s testimony simply
bears no relevance to Plaintiff's request to take more than 10 depositions of non-party witnesses.

Conspicuously absent from Plaintiff's motion are (a) any actual information she believes
these witnesses may provide which is neither cumulative nor duplicative of other information
already disclosed in this case, (b) the fact the information can be obtained from other sources,

' Plaintiff flatly mis-represents to the Court that Ms. Maxwell “refused” to answer the questions posed to
her, as the actual transcript amply demonstrates. Ms. Maxwell did not avoid any questions and answered
all questions to the best of her recollection relating to alleged events 15 years ago. The majority of the
bullet point “summary” of the matters about which Ms. Maxwell could not testify were based either on a
lack of any personal knowledge or the fact that the events claimed by Plaintiff did not actually happen.
