Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 61 of 349

On, that same day, Villafafia emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, ‘and her immediate supervisor
complaining ‘that. she had received no reply. to her query: about making: changes ‘to: the proposed.
indictment and asking’ again, for feedback. During his OPR interview, Lourie observed that
Villafafia’s request for feedback reflected her desire to “charge this case sooner than . . . everybody’
else,” but.Acosta was still considéring what strategy to pursuc. Sloman.told OPR: that’ Jhe did net:
know whether Villafafia received any response. to her-request, but he'believed that at-that point in.
time, Menchel and. Lourie were evaluating the case:to make a decision about how to proceed.

The day before'the Junie 26 miceting, defense counsel Lefcourt transmitted to.the USAO a.
19-page. letter intended {o provide “an overview of our position and the materials:we plan to present
in. order to demonstrate that none of the statutes: identified by. you can. rightly be applied ‘to the:
conduct at issuc here.” Reitcrating their prior arguments and themes, defense counsel strongly:
contested the apprepriateness of federal.involvement in'the:matter. Among othcrissucs, Lefcourt’s
letter argued:

e Voluntary sexual activity involving “tyoung adults-16 or 17 years of age’?—.was.
“strictly 'a state concern.”

0 Federal statutes: were not méant to apply to circumstances in. which the défendant:
reasonably believed ‘that the person ‘with’ whom he engaged in sexual. activity, was:
18 'ycars of age.

© Onc of the chief statutes the USAO had focused upon, 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was’
intended to address ‘use of the internet to:prey upon child victims through “internet:

o The “travel” statute, 18 U:S.C.. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “for the purpose of”
‘engaging in illicit sexual conduct, but Lpstem traveled to Florida ‘to visit family,
oversee his Florida-based flight operations, and “engage in the routine activities of
daily living.”

Lefcourt :also. argued again that ‘ “uregularities” had tainted the.state’s: case and ‘would. “have ‘a
significant impact on any federal proséciltion. 52:

Lourie sent to Menchel, with. a copy to Villafafia, an.cmail! dividing the:defense arguments.
into “weaker” and “stronger” points. Lourie: disagreed’ with. the argument that 18-U.S.C..§ 2422(b)
was limited.to:‘ ‘internet. trolling,” and described. this as “our best. charge and the most defensible:
for federal interest.” On the other hand, Louric believed the defense argument that Epstein did not:
travel to Florida “with the:purpose’” of. engaging in illicit sex with a minor-was more persuasive.

Lefcort; he told OPR thar hé “wouldn't take issue” with Villafania’s claim, that hé had doe 86. ‘Menchél also. told,
OPR-that he did.not recall Villafafia, objecting at that point:to-providing the information to the détense..

2 L:efcourt claimed ‘there. were deficiencies . in: the ‘PBPD search: warrant ‘and “material misstatements and.
omissions” in.the PBPID: probable. cause: affidavit. Asan example, he contended. that the police had lacked probable
cause to search ‘for videotapes, * ‘since all the women. who were: asked, whether they: had ‘been videotaped denied
know. ledge of any’ videotaping.” (Emphasis i in original).
