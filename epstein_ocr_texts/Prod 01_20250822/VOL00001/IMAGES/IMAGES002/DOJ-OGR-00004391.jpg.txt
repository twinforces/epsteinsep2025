having directly ‘with Alex: Acosta, and Alex Acosta agrced to 18
months.

Villafana further explained to OPR?

Regarding going from24 months to 20 months, I recall a-discussion
that:24 months of federal: time was really 20. months after gain, time,
so Epstein should. be allowed to plead. to 20, months’ in the state.
Epstcin’ $ counsel represented that he wouldn’t get gain time like
that: in the [s]tate, and somconc above:me:agreed. Later, of course,
as shown. in the agreements, Epstcin’s counsel (Jay Lefkowitz) got
Alex to agree that Epstein should, be allowed 'to carn gain time in the
[s]tate, so'the 20 months in the state became’ at least. months.

Regarding. going from.20 months’ to 18:months, . . . this came.from
a negotiation between Epstcin’s ‘counsel, and Andy or Alex, where
the federal statutory max:could only be 24 or 18,.so 18 was. agreed
to. I also recall that, after Epstcin’s counsel. decided that they
wanted to-proceed with.an NPA anid-only a state guilty plea, | asked
Alex why-we didn’t return to 20 months because the reason why’we
went.to 18 months'was' because that:was the onily-way: to.end up with
a federal, statutory maximum.."°

However, a subsequent account of the history of negotiations, with Epstein’s.attorneys,
drafted by Villafaita for Acosta several weeks after the September 12, 2007 meeting » with-the: State

in the amount of jail time - - “fiom, the originally proposed] twenty- four’ months down to cightecn,
months, which would be:served at the Palm Beach ‘County Jail rather than'a, state:prison facility.”
Acosta also noted to OPR that Villafania was engaged. in a “tough negotiation;’ and he was willing
to: allow. her the diseretion to: reduce the amount of. incarecration time:without him. ‘“‘sccond-
guessing” her. Acosta acknowledged that. he “clearly approved it at some point.”

_ Based « on this record, ORR: could not definitively deferring: when, how, or r by whom ‘ne
‘1S possible: thatthe: reduction: was: connected to Epstein’ s effort to: achieve a resuilt. ‘that would allow
him-to serve his time in.a.county:facility, but it may also have: resulted :from the: partics’ attempts
to reach, agreement on. federal charges that-would not. result in a sentence of incarceration, greater
than, what; had, been discussed with respect; to state charges. In the end, the cvidence shows that.
Acosta approved of a reduced teri of incarceration from 24 months to,'18 months, and the DSAO
‘understood.at the time that the state gain time:tequirement would further reduce the actual amount’
of time: Epstein would spend incarecrated.

HO By “federal, statutory. maximum,” Villafafia:referred to 12-month.and.6-month misdemeanors.
