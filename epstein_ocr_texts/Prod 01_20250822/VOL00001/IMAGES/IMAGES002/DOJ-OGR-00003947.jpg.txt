Second, the Goverment ‘will continue to take steps to ensure, that ‘the, defense :is able, to
prepare for trial ‘as scheduled. As noted. in its April 9, .2021 letter, the Government. has already:
included Rule 16 discovery relating to'the S2 Indictment. in its prior productions to the defense,
and, the: Government -has provided. the: defense with a list of pages within. those discovery
productions that are particularly pertinent to the new:allcgations contained in:the $2 Indictment.’
Contrary to the defense’s, suggestion in its most’ recent Ictter, the largest discovery production in.
this case came from electronic: devices 'scized. from, Jeffrey Epstein, That production, dated.
November 1.8, '2020, included approximately’ 1.2 million. documents (totaling approximately: 2.2
million-pages), all of which.are text searchable and:were produced .in:a.format.conducive to loading
that production into a document:review platform.’ Morcover, the defense’s suggestion that it will
need, to re-review every single page of discovery produced ‘to date: is, at bests hyperbolic. The

‘defense has already .reviewed the discovery and. presumably: knows which portions relate in.

2 "To the extent the defense complains of teeent difficulties reviewing. certain Highly Confidential
the Government repeatedly informed defense counsel beginning 4 im the fall. ‘of 2020 that ‘those
matcrials‘would’be made available for revicw. upon request. The defense did not. request'to review’
those materials until March 202 l, after which the Government.coordinated. with defense counscl,
the Federal Burcau of Investigation, and the U.S. Marshals to :arrange for multiple days, in. April
2021 during which all of the materials were: made available for review. The Government is of
course willing to make similar arrangements: should defense counsel. believe additional review of
those materials is necessary.

3 Only yesterday did defense counsel provide the Government. with, a list of documents that the
past when such. issues have ‘been raised, the Government will work with it dts ‘staff and staff at the
Metropolitan Detention.Center (“M DC”) to address thesc:issucs as. expeditiously as possible. The:
Government notes, however, that had. defense counsel, raised these specific: issues earlier, the
Government could:have addressed them much, sooner.

‘Similarly, the defense. only raised concerns about metadata.on certain photographs this month,
even. though those: Phovographs were produced: to ‘the defense in November 2020.. The Government

address the defense’ 3 concerns as. “quickly as possible.
