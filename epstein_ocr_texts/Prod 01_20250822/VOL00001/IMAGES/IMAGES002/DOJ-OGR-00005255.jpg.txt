‘Honorable Alison.J. Nathan
United States District Judge.
United States Courthouse.
40 Foley Square
Re: United. States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S220 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear. Judge Nathan:

There is nothing’ surprising about the government’s, opposition. to, limited.attorney=
conducted, voir dire and individual, sequestered, voir dire: (Dkt. 355.) The government;s response:
is standard SDNY operating’ procedure: “We don’tdo that here.” ‘Rarely is there: an AUSA;who
has ever conducted voir dire, so ‘itis casy’ to just say “no.” In:this case, counsel. are better
positioned to address particular arcas of case-related bias than. is the: Court, and:requesting a:mere:
minute per juror is far from.oncrous.

The ‘proposed, questionnaire sccks highly. sensitive and. personal information:regarding
cach juror. Simply asking,jurors to raise:their hand:in response to an invitation.to speak privately
‘on a.personal topic is revealing and.invasive. One would hope that the government would be
sensitive to that fact and'would. want.to ensure that.a fair.and impartial jury will be scated in this
high-profile case. With cach. passing day. the amount of public. exposure this case receives erodes.
that possibility. Bclow are today’s Google scarch,results:

s Ghislaine Maxwell: “about 4,740,000 (about 0.89 seconds)”
s Jeffrey Epstein: “about 26,200,000 results (0.86 seconds)”

The:Court has the power:and the obligation to cnsure that jury sclection climinates jurors
who are biased and/or motivated. to serve for:reasons beyond, being fair and impartial.
Supervisory powers, and discretion.and grant’the defense request for individual. sequestered voir.
dire: and very limited counsél-conducted, voir dire.

‘Very truly yours,
BOBBI'C. STERNHEIM.

‘ec? All. Counsel
