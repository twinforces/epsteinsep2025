at v-vi), evidence or argument on that point can only distract the jury from its function.

The defense is free to offer its own evidence about the victims and instances charged in
this case, and it is free to attempt to impeach the Government’s witnesses through legitimate
evidentiary means. But evidence about unrelated investigative steps and their outcomes would
only serve to extend the trial and distract the jury with irrelevant information. This Court should
preclude such evidence.

C. The Defense Should Not Be Permitted to Call Case Agents Without First Proffering

a Valid Basis for Their Testimony

As explained above, the Court should preclude evidence or argument regarding either the
outcomes of the prior investigations, investigative steps taken during those investigations, the
length of those investigations, or the evidence developed during those investigations about
unrelated events. Nevertheless, it appears the defense intends to call one or more case agents in
order to elicit such improper testimony. The Court should preclude testimony from case agents
unless the defense identifies a proper basis for their testimony.

The Government has received a request from the defense pursuant to United States ex.
rel. Touhy v. Regan, 340 U.S. 462 (1951) for the testimony of two FBI case agents from the
Florida Investigations and two FBI case agents for the investigation that led to charges in this
District against Epstein and the defendant. The notice is attached as Exhibit A. According to the
Touhy request, which must summarize the testimony sought, see 28 C.F.R. § 16.23(c), the
defendant seeks testimony “concerning the scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as
well as the various investigative steps taken by the agents, including but not limited to testimony
