The government says that this. Court.nced not resolve Ms. Maxwell’s motions to

suppressor hold.an evidentiary hearing before the trial. on.the: non-perjury counts. because it

“does not. intend. to use these materials”—v/.e., any of the materials ‘subject:to the suppression
motions—‘in its casc-in-chicf at the trial of the non-perjury counts in. this case.” (Dkt. No.
227,p 1). At'the same time, the government purports to “reserve[] its right to‘use relevant
matcrials, from. this set. for.any purpose permissible’under'the Rules of Evidence.” Jd. at 2., The
‘government’s representation is not. good cnough, and its reservation-of rights is misplaced.

It is not enough for the government to ‘represent that it “does not intend.to use: [the
suppression] materials in its.casc-in-chief at'the: trial. of the :non-perjury counts in this case.”
Id. at 1. That’s because Ms. Maxwell’s motions to ‘suppress allege violations of the duc
process clause, the Fourth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment, and the Second. Circuits:
decision.in Martindell v. International: Tel. & Tel. Corp., S94 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979). Tf this
Court agrees with Ms. Maxwell’s arguments, not-only will itssuppress all 90,000-some pages
of material the government improperly obtained through its ee purfe-subpoena, it will also
suppress.all evidence derived therefrom. See Wong Sun-v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 488
(1963); United States v. Bailey, 743 F.3d 322, 341-42 (2d, Cir. 2014).

The government thus. cannot avoid. inquiry into :its Conduct simply by pledging not'to.
usc the material itsclf.in. its.casc-in-chicf. If. Ms. Maxwell:is right—and an evidentiary hearing
will. show. that ‘she is—the government also cannot use any evidence it obtained. “by
exploitation. of the illegality.” See Woig Sun, 37.1 U.S. at.488..

What’s more, “the:burden of proof.on [an] attcnuation claim is.on the government.”
United States v..Ghailani, 743 F. Supp. 2d, 242, 259 (S.D.N-Y. 2010) (ordering an, evidentiary

hearing :to put the. government to its burden of proving attenuation) (citing United States v.
