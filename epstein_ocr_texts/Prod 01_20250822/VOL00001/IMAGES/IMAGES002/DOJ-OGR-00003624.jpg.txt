jury wheel, I was able to identify and measure the various causes of the absolute disparity
between the community and the qualified jury wheel.

6. The first step in the process of analyzing the qualified jury wheel is to re-create the
master jury wheel. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random selection from the
voter registration lists. The master jury wheel was chosen from the November 1, 2016 county
voter registration lists. Based on geocoding the master jury wheel, I was able to estimate that a
proper random sample from the complete November 1, 2016 voter registration lists would have
been 11.88% African American and 13.79% Hispanic. Hence, if a simple random sample had
been selected, the absolute difference between the African American percent in the master jury
wheel and the community would have been only 0.57 percentage points, and the absolute
difference between the Hispanic percent in the master jury wheel and the community would have
been only 0.33 percentage points. Hence, the voter lists are a good representation of the
community benchmarks for representation of African Americans and Hispanics

7. As pointed out by defendantâ€™s expert Mr. Martin, the selection of the individuals on the
master jury wheel was not a simple random sample from the November 1, 2016 voter registration
lists. That is, all registered voters did not have an equal chance of selection. There were two
reasons for this. One, registered voters from the counties which provided jurors to both the
Manhattan and White Plains master jury wheels were less likely to be selected than registered
voters in counties which fed only the White Plains master jury wheel. Two, except for Dutchess
County, inactive registered voters were not selected for the master jury wheel.' These reasons
were responsible for the actual master jury wheel being only 11.20% African American and
' The voter registration lists for all counties but Dutchess did not include inactive registered
voters.
