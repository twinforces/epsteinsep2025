jury wheel,.1 was able to identify and. measure the various causes of the absolute disparity
between. the community arid the qualified jury wheel.

6. The.first step:in the process of:analyzing the qualified jury'wheel is to re-create'the
‘master‘jury wheel., The master jury wheel is supposed'to be a simple random. selection:from the
voter registration. lists. The:master jury wheel was chosen from.the November ‘1, 2016 county
proper random. sample, from, the complete November 1,'2016 voter registration lists would have
been. 1.1.88% African American and 13.79% Hispanic. Hence, if'a simple random sample had
been selected, the absolute difference between the African American percent.in, the master jury
wheel. and the community. would have beén only 0.57 percentage points, and the absolute
difference between the:Hispanic percent in'the master jury-;wheel and the community would have
been, only 0.33 ‘percentage points. Hence, the voter lists are:a good representation of, the’
commniunity benchmarks for representation.of African Americans. and Hispanics

7. As ‘pointed out-by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin, the selection of the individuals on the
‘master‘jury wheel was, nota simple, random-sample from the November: 1, 201.6 voter registration
lists. Thatzis, all ‘registered ‘voters did not:have an equal chance of selection. There were'two
reasons for this. One, registered'voters from the counties which provided jurors to both, the
Manhattan.and White Plains master jury wheels Were less likely'to be selectéd than:registered
voters in.counties. which. fed only the White: Plains master jury ;wheel. Two, except .for Dutchess
County, inactive registered voters were not selected forthe master, jury;wheel.' These reasons

were. résponsible. forthe actual master jury wheel. being only‘ 11.20% African American and

' The voter'registration, lists for all. counties but; Dutchess did. not include inaetive registered.
