and Sloman to discuss the Epstein investigation, ‘but Villafaiia declined.

Shortly thereafter, Lilly Arn-Sanchez, a former-AUSA, contaeted Sloman:and advised him.
that she also represented Epstcin. Sanchez was is employed by the USAO from. 2000 to September
the Chief. According to Sloman’s contemporaneous ‘email recounting ‘the: conversation, when.
Sanchez indicated to him. that.his participation‘in Lewis’s call'with Villafafia led the defense team
to belicve that the mattér had been “elevated” within the USAO, Sloman tricd ‘to “disabuse” her of
that notion. Sanchez said that Epstein “wanted to be as transparent and cooperative as possible”
in, ‘working x with the USAO. Despite the fact that'Lewis had already, made contact with the USAO
‘on Epstein’s behalf, Sanchez sent a letter to Villafafiacon November 15,2006, in which'she asserted.
that she, and Gerald Lefcourt:were representing Epstcin.and asked that ‘the USAO direct all contact.
or communications about, Epstein to them. In response, Villafana requested. that, the defense:
provide documents and.information.pertinent to the federal investigation, including the documents
and. information. ‘that: Epstein. had previously provided. to the State Attorney’s Office, and.

“computers, hard drives, CPUs [computer processing units], and any other computer media”
removed, from, Epstcin’s home before the PBPD executed, its scarch, warrant in October 2005. In,
January 2007, Sanchez contactéd Villafana to schedule a mecting, but Villafafia responded that.
she wanited:to reécive. and review the documents. before scheduling. a mecting. with. Sanchez.

Immediately after reeciving’ Villafafia’s response, Sanchez bypassed. Villafafia and. phoncd.
Lourie, with, whom she had,worked,when she was an AUSA, to press for a meeting. ‘Lourie ‘agreed,
to meet with Sanchez: and. Lefcourt. Lourie explained to Villafafia that Sanchez was concerned.
that federal charges Were. “imminent,” wanted to mect with the USAO aiid. “make. a, pitch,” and
promised that once given the opportunity to :do so, if the USAO “wanted to interview Epstein, that.
would.be a, possibility.” ‘Willafafia told. Lourie that Sanchez had not yet provided the documents
she had:promised, and Villafafia wanted.“the documents not the pitch.” Louric explained to OPR,
however that. it was his ‘practice to grant mectings to defense counsel; he considered it. “good for:

s” to learn the defense:theories of a.casc:and belicved,.that “information is power.” Lourié further’
explained ‘that learning what information the: defense viewed as important could. help the: USAO
form its strategy and determine:which counts relating,to which-victims should. be charged. Louric’
also believed, that as a. gencral ‘matter, prosecutors should grant defense requests. to make’ a.
presentation, because “[p]art of [the] process. is for them to believe they are heard.” ‘In addition to
agrecing to a mecting, Lourie sent.Sancheéz a narrowed document request, which ‘responded. to
‘Sanchez’s ‘complaint that the. USAO’s carlier request ‘was overbroad but which retained the
demand. for. the computer. related. items removed. ot rom Epstein’ s home. The nomena w was scheduled.

USAO by January:25, 2007.

Villafana did not.agrec with Lourie’s decision'to mect.with Sanchez and-Lefeourt! Indeed,
two days after Lourie agreed to the mecting, Villafaiia alerted. him that she had:spoken. again with.
Sanchez;and learned that‘Epstcin’was not going to provide the:requested documents. As’ Villafafia
told, Lourie, “I just get;to listen to'the pitch and/hear about how’ the girls are liars and, drug users.’
She told OPR that in her view, “it-was way: too carly. to: have a meeting,” she already. knew’ what.
the defénse'would say, and:sheé could not'sce how a.meécting'would benefit the federal investigation.
She explained to Lourie the basis for her objections to ‘the: mecting,, but Louric “vehemently”
