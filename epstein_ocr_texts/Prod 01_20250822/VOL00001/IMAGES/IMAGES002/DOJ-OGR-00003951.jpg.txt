this case would have been present whether or not the Government sought a superseding indictment,
yet the defense never previously raised this issue as necessitating an adjournment. But more
importantly, there is no reason to think that the S2 Indictment will increase the length of time
required for jury selection in this case, and as noted above, the parties have agreed to the use of a
jury questionnaire to expedite the selection process. Similarly, the defenseâ€™s complaint that it is
difficult to estimate the length of a defense case before disclosure of Jencks Act material and
Government exhibits would be true regardless of new charges.

The defendant has five retained lawyers appearing on her behalf on the docket in this case,
all of whom are experienced and skilled trial attorneys. Throughout the pendency of this case, the
defense team has demonstrated its ability to litigate multiple complex issues on overlapping
schedules while also carefully reviewing discovery and preparing for trial. In addition, the
defendant has the benefit of even more attorneys who have appeared on her behalf to brief and
argue appeals in this case before the Second Circuit, as well as staff such as paralegals and
investigators assisting her attorneys. Given their skills and the resources at their disposal, there is
every reason to believe that defense counsel will provide the defendant with exceptional
representation at trial as scheduled.

Third, the victims in this case would suffer additional harm were trial to be delayed. The
longer this case remains pending, the longer the victims suffer the anxiety of anticipating their trial
testimony and the uncertainty of awaiting a resolution. As a result, multiple victims oppose any
adjournment of the trial date. In particular, Minor Victim-3 expressed feeling significant stress
during the pendency of this case and a strong desire to have the case brought to a close through
trial as soon as possible. Similarly, Minor Victim-2 also indicated that she has experienced an
enormous amount of stress while this case has been pending, wishes to see the case brought to trial
