Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 60 of 348

On, that same day, Villafafia, emailed Louric, ‘Menchel, ‘Sloman, and her immediate supervisor
complaining that she had. reecived no reply to her: query about making changes to ‘the proposed,
indictment: and asking again, for feedback. During his OPR. interview, Louric observed. that.
Villafafia’s request for:fcédback reflected her desire to “charge'this case Soorier than . .. everybody’
clse,” but.Acosta:was still considering what strategy to pursuc. Sloman told OPR. that he did. not
know whether Villafafia reecived any response to. her request, but he belicved.that. at’that: point, in,
time, Menchel and.Louric’were evaluating the case to make a decision about how to’ proceed.

The day before the June 26 mecting, defense. counscl. Lefcourt transmitted to the USAO a.
19-page letter intended to: provide “an overview of:our position:and'the:materials:we plan to present.
In, order to: demonstrate that none of the statutes identified ’ ‘by you can, rightly: be applied ‘to: the:
conduct. at issue here.” Reitcrating their prior arguments and themes, defense’ counsel strongly:
contested the appropriateness of federal involvement in'the:matter. Among: otherissucs, Lefcourt’s
letter argued:

°o Voluntary’ sexual activity’ involving “young adults=16 or 17 ‘years of age”=was
“strictly.a, state’ concer.”

e Federal statutes were not meant:to.apply to circumstances. in/which. the defendant.
reasonably believed that. the person with ‘whom he engaged in sexual activity was
18 years of age.

e One, of the chief'statutes the USAO had focused upon, ‘18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), was
intended. to address ‘use of the ‘internct to ‘prey upon child victims through “internet:
trolling,” but-Epstein. did:not use the internet to lure victims.

° The “travel” statute, 18 U-S.C. § 2423(b), prohibits travel “forthe purpose of”
engaging in illicit. sexual conduct, but Epstein. traveled. to Florida to visit; family,
oversee his Florida-based flight operations, and, “engage in the routine activitics of
daily living.”

Lefcourt also argued again ‘that. “irregularitics” had tainted ‘the state’s case and. would. “have a
significant impact on, any federal prosccution,”*”

Lourie sent’to:'Menchel, with a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense arguments
into “weaker” and * ‘stroniger” points. Lotirie:disagreed with the argument that 18 U-S.C. § 2422(b)
was limited to “internet trolling,” and described. this as “our'best charge: and. the most ‘defensible
for federal interest.” On the other hand, Lourie believed the defense argument'that‘Epstein did not
travel to Florida ““‘with,the'purpose’” of engaging in. illicit sex with a minor was. more persuasive.

‘Lefcourt, he told OPR, that he “wouldn’t take issue® with Villafafia’s claim,that he had done so. ‘Menchel also told,
OPR that‘he did not recall’ Villafafiasobjecting at that point to-providing the information-to the defense:

“2 Lefcourt claimed there; were, deficieneies in. the ‘PBPD, search, warrant and, “material misstatements and,
omissions” in.the PBPD: probable, cause affidavit: As.an example, he: contended that the: police had lacked probable
cause to search -for videotapes, * ‘since all the women, who were: asked whether they: had ‘been videotaped. denied:
knowledge of:any videotaping.” (Emphasis in original).
