contended specifically that the indictment is too vague because it refers to open-ended time
periods for the Mann Act counts. The Court disagreed in light of Circuit precedent requiring
only that an indictment describe the time and place of the charged conduct in “approximate
terms” and permitting the use of “on or about” language to describe the window of when a
