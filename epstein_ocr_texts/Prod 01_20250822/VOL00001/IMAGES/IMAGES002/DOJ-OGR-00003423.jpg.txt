Nevertheless, as Epstcin’s team, continued to argueto higher levels. of the. Department:that.
there was no appropriate fedcral-interest in. prosecuting Epstein and.thus no basis forthe:NPA, and.
with his attorncys asserting that “the facts had gotten better for Epstein,” Villafafia came to believe
that Epstcin would likely breach the NPA.*”° ‘In January 2008, Villafafia informed her supervisors
‘that the FBI “had ‘very tight. contact with the ‘victims several months ago when we were prepared.
to [file;charges], but all the shenanigans over'the past few months have resultéd.in no-contact with.
the vast majority of'the victims.” Villafafia then. ‘proposed that the FBI “re-establish contact with.
all the: victims’ so that: we know we can rely on them at:trial.’”°2” Villafafia.told OPR that. at this
point, ‘ ‘Tw]hile the case was being investigat[ed] and ‘prepared. for indictment, I did. not ‘prepare or
send any. ‘victim notification lctters=there simply.'was nothing to update. I did not receive any’
victim. calls during this time.”

contact information with the FBI in. order to’obtain. current information about the :matter.*"* The:
case agent informed. Villafaiia.in an‘email that the Victim, Specialist sent. a “standard form, [FBI]
Ictter to all the remaining identified, victims.” These 2008 Ictters were identical to the FBI form,
letters the Victim Specialist.had sent to'victims between August: 28, 2006, and October 12, 2007.
Like those-préevious Ictters, most, of which were sent before the NPA was signed on September 24,
2007, the 2008 Ictters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted. that “[t]his
