Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 310-1 Filed 07/02/21 Page 80 of 80
Commonwealth v. DiPasquale, 246 A.2d 430, 432 (Pa. 1968)). The decision to charge,
or not to charge, a defendant can be conditioned, modified, or revoked at the discretion
of the prosecutor.

However, the discretion vested in our Commonwealth’s prosecutors, however
vast, does not mean that its exercise is free of the constraints of due process. When an
unconditional charging decision is made publicly and with the intent to induce action and
reliance by the defendant, and when the defendant does so to his detriment (and in some
instances upon the advice of counsel), denying the defendant the benefit of that decision
is an affront to fundamental fairness, particularly when it results in a criminal prosecution
that was foregone for more than a decade. No mere changing of the guard strips that
circumstance of its inequity. See, e.g., State v. Myers, 513 S.E.2d 676, 682 n.1 (W.Va.
1998) (explaining that “any change in the duly elected prosecutor does not affect the
standard of responsibility for the office”). A contrary result would be patently untenable.
It would violate long-cherished principles of fundamental fairness. It would be antithetical
to, and corrosive of, the integrity and functionality of the criminal justice system that we
strive to maintain.

For these reasons, Cosby’s convictions and judgment of sentence are vacated,
and he is discharged.*°

Justices Todd, Donohue and Mundy join the opinion.

Justice Dougherty files a concurring and dissenting opinion in which
Chief Justice Baer joins.

Justice Saylor files a dissenting opinion.
a5 Accordingly, we do not address Cosby’s other issue.
