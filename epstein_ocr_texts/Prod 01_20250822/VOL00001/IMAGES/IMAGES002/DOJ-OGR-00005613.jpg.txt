Ghislaine Maxwell moves in liming to exclude any evidence the Government. sccks to
admit at trial under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b) (the “Rule”). That Rule, as amended. in December’
2020, expressly requires particularized:notice to the defense of the exact.evidence to be offered,
‘an.articulated;non-propensity purpose for its admission, andthe reasoning supporting that
purpose. Despite notice of the rule change and an. opportunity'to, comply with the Rule by this.
Court's deadline ‘of October 11:1, the Government opted. not to follow*the requirements of'the Rule
and. should now be foreclosed from offering any cvidence pursuant to Rule 404(b).

BACKGROUND

introduce evidence under the rule:

“Ina criminal case, the prosecutor must:

(A) provide reasonable notice of any such ‘evidence that the prosecutor intends to ‘offer at
trial, ‘so that the defendant. has a.fair opportunity to'mect it;

(BY articulate in the notice the permitted purpose ‘for which the prosecutor intends:to offer
the evidence andthe: reasoning that, supports the purpose; and

(C) do so in writing before trial —or‘in, any form during trial, of the court, for good cause,
excuses lack of:pretrial notice.”

Eed. R. Evid. 404(b)(3). In December 2020, the Rule was.“amended. principally to
Impose additional notice requirements iin.a criminal case.” Fed. R. Evid. 404, Advisory’
Committee Notes, 2020 Amendments. ‘Prior'to, the rulé change, the prosecution needed only to
give:notice of the “general nature” of the anticipated cvidence; thus, “some courts....permit[ted]
the government to satisfy the notice obligation without describing the specific act that the
evidence would tend:to prove, and. without.cxplaining the: relevance ofthe evidence for a non-

propensity purpose” (/d.)..
