20-CR-330 (AJN)
Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
Last summer, the Court scheduled trial in this matter to commence on July 12, 2021. On
March 29, 2021, three and a half months before trial, the Government filed an S2 Superseding
Indictment. As a result of the late filing of the S2, counsel for Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
request a continuance of the trial date until either fall 2021 or January 2022.' The Government
opposes any continuance, but requests that if one is granted it be until March of 2022. Having
carefully considered the parties’ respective positions, the Court GRANTS Maxwell’s request for
a short continuance until the fall of 2021 to allow the defense to prepare for the additional
charges brought in the S2 indictment. The Court rejects Maxwell’s alternative request to
continue the trial date until January of 2022 and the Government’s alternative proposal that the
Court adjourn trial until March of 2022.
The Court bases its decision on a number of factors. First, the filing of the S2 indictment
has added a significant burden to the defense’s preparation for trial. The new indictment alleges
! The alternative request by Maxwell resulted from a conflict among lawyers involved in both this case and a
criminal matter before Judge Furman, which is discussed in defense counsel’s letter. Dkt. No. 246 at 4. The Court
has been informed that Judge Furman has adjourned the trial date with respect to two defendants. The Court
presumes that this eliminates the September through December conflict for one of Maxwell’s defense counsel. It
presumably does not eliminate the conflict for one of the AUSAs involved in both cases. Dkt. No. 235 at 10 n.5.
