Ghislaific Maxwell,
ORDER.
Defendant.

ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

Last summer, the: Court. scheduled trial. in this matter to commence‘on July 12,2021. On
March 29, 202.1, three and, a half:months before trial, the Government filed an,S2.Superseding
Indictment. As a result of the late. filing ofthe S2, counsel for Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
request a continuance of the trial, date until, cither fall 2021 or January 2022." The Government
Opposes any’ continuance, but requests that if one is granted it be until. March of 2022. Having
carefully considered the parties’ respective positions, the Court GRANTS Maxwell’s request for
a. short. continuance until the fall of 2021 to allow the defense to prepare for the additional
charges brought in the S2 indictment. The Court rejects Maxwell’s alternative request to
continue the trial date until January of 2022 and. the: Government’s alternative proposal that the
Court adjourn: trial until March of 2022.

The Court bases its, decision 6n.a number of factors. /irst, the filing of:the. S2 indictment

has added.a significant burden to the defense’s preparation, for trial. The new indictment alleges

! The alternative request by Maxwell-resulted ‘from a‘conflict.among lawyers:involved in-both this: case and a
‘criminal matter before Judge-Furman, whichis discussed:in defense counsel's letter. (Dkt. No. 246 at 4. ‘The Court
‘has:been:informed that Judge-Furman has adjourned the trial date with-respect‘to'two defendants. The Court
presumes that'this eliminates the: September through-December’conflict:for one of Maxwell's defense counsel. It
presumably does‘not eliminate the conflict for one.of the. AUSAs involved in both cases. ‘Dkt. No. 235 at 10°n.5.
