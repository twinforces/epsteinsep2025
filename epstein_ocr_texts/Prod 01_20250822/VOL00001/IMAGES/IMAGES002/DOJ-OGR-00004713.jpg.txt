as multiplicitous remains premature. Sixth, a bill of particulars is not warranted, especially when
both the speaking indictment and discovery in this case provide ample details regarding the
charged offenses. Seventh, the defendant’s request for immediate disclosure of impeachment
material regarding one of the Government’s witnesses should be denied consistent with this
Court’s prior conclusion that such material may be provided closer to trial.

I. Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement Does Not Bar the Superseding
Indictment
In an Opinion and Order dated April 16, 2021, the Court denied the defendant’s previous
motion to dismiss the Indictment based on a 2007 non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between
Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (the “USAO-

District and, accordingly, the motion should be denied. In an effort to relitigate the Court’s April
Opinion, the defendant now claims that the rule of Annabi “only applies in situations where the
