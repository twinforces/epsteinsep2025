néed,riot satisfy that standard. See, Dkt. No. 134, at ‘16; Dkt. No. 285, at.23. However, she
provides no explanation for'why /ranks should:not apply. To the extent she offers any
alternative framework in,her reply, it is that an evidentiary hearing iis required whenever any’

Maxwell, must.thus make a substantial preliminary showing on,cach-of ranks’
requirements to:justify an. cvidentiary‘hearing. United States v. Salameh, 152’F.3d 88, 1.13 (2d.

Cir. 1998). That:is, she must: first make .a substantial preliminary’ showing that the Government
