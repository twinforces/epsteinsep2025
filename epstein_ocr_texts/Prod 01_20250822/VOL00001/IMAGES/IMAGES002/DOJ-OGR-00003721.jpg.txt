court held that the ambiguity of both questions rendered the answers insufficient as a matter of
law to support a perjury conviction. The courts holding is equally applicable here:

Precise questioning is imperative as a predicate for the offense of perjury. A perjury

conviction cannot be based upon evasive answers or even upon misleading answers

so long as they are literally true. In the face of evasion or misleading answers, it is

the lawyer's duty to bring the witness back to the mark, to flush out the whole truth

with the tools of adversary examination. When a line of questioning is so vague as

to be fundamentally ambiguous, the answers associated with the questions posed

may be insufficient as a matter of law to support a perjury conviction (cleaned up).
And, finally, although there are more, in United States v. Bonds, 580 F. Supp. 2d 925, 931 (N.D.
Cal. 2008), the court ruled that using the terms “anything like” in connection with a perjury
prosecution in a professional baseball steroid investigation created a serious problem. The
government argued, similar to the claims here that, in context, this phrase refers to “anything like
steroids that could have led to a positive steroid test.” According to the court, the use of the
qualifier made the question fundamentally ambiguous requiring dismissal of the count.

The government, at page 133 of its Response, incorrectly suggests that the burden was on
Ms. Maxwell or her counsel to clarify the confused questions, particularly regarding the infinite
time span. First, that is simply wrong. The questioner has the responsibility to ask clear
questions and to “pin down” the witness. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 231, 236-37. It is the
government, not Ms. Maxwell who is engaging in post-hoc definitions about undefined terms
“scheme” and “interact with” (Count Five); and about the “presence” of certain items, or
Epstein’s possession of “items” used in “activities,” her “awareness” of what Epstein was doing
when she wasn’t with him in a “millennium” and giving a “massage.” (Count Six). Because the
questions were so bad, the government spends significant energy trying to rationalize what the
questioner meant.

The answers to the bad, ambiguous, objectionable questions were also “literally
true.” Bronsion v. United States, 409 U.S. 352 (1973), makes clear that an individual cannot be
