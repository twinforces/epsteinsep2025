were illegal and included discussions that could be interpreted as attempts by Constand
and her mother to get Cosby to pay Constand so that she would not contact the
authorities. The totality of these circumstances ultimately led D.A. Castor to conclude
that “there was insufficient credible and admissible evidence upon which any charge
against [] Cosby related to the Constand incident could be proven beyond a reasonable
doubt.” N.T., 2/2/2016, at 60.

Having determined that a criminal trial likely could not be won, D.A. Castor
contemplated an alternative course of action that could place Constand on a path to some
form of justice. He decided that a civil lawsuit for money damages was her best option.

office] would not prosecute [] Cosby,” believing that his decision ultimately “would then

something illegal—on the threat of if you don’t answer, you'll be subject to

sanctions because you’re under subpoena.

So the way you remove that from a witness is—if you want to, and what |

did in this case—is | made the decision as the sovereign that Mr. Cosby

would not be prosecuted no matter what. As a matter of law, that then made

it so that he could not take the Fifth Amendment ever as a matter of law.

So | have heard banter in the courtroom and in the press the term

“agreement,” but everybody has used the wrong word. | told [Cosby’s

attorney at the time, Walter] Phillips that | had decided that, because of
