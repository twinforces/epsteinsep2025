the proportionality'was:to lower the African. American percentage by 0.34 percentage points and.

and, 5) resulted. in the actual, master jury-wheel representation of African Americans being 0.68)
percentage’points lower and Hispanics being 0.82: lower and, as:a result, the absolute disparity:
between the actual master jury wheel and the community. was 1.25. for African.Americans and.

1.15 for Hispanics.
