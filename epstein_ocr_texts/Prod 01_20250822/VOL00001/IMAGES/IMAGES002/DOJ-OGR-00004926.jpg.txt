statutory and common law privacy concerns. (Dkt. No. 38 at 1.) Maxwell submitted a proposed
form of order for Judge Sweet’s consideration. (Dkt. No. 39-1.) |
Giuffre represented that she “[did] not oppose the entrance [sic] of a Protective Order in |
this case, but [did] oppose a Protective Order in the form proposed by Defendant because it is |
overly broad and can lead to abuse and over designation[.]” (15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 40 at 2.) |
Giuffre redlined Maxwell’s proposed protective order, deleting some provisions and (insofar as |
is relevant) adding language to paragraph 4— stating that confidential information “shall not be :
disclosed or used for any purpose except the preparation and trial of this case”’—to provide that |
confidential materials also could be disclosed with impunity “in any related matter, including but :
not limited to, investigations by law enforcement.” (15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 41-5 § 4.) Maxwell |
opposed these modifications. (15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 49.) |
At a hearing held on March 17, 2016, Judge Sweet concluded that “of course” a
protective order was warranted. (Hrg. Tr., 15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. 66, at 4:25—5:1.) He gave no |
reason, but as Maxwell made her motion on the basis of privacy concerns, and Giuffre consented |
to entry of some form of a protective order for the same reason, I assume that Judge Sweet found !
privacy concerns to constitute good cause—which, given the subject matter of the lawsuit, would |
certainly have been warranted.
Judge Sweet did not, however, resolve any of the disputes between the parties about what |
should or should not be in the order. Instead, he directed the parties to come up with an |
agreement to which everyone could stipulate. (/d. at 5:1—-12.) By the end of the hearing, Giuffre, |
who was eager to take Maxwell’s deposition, agreed to the form of order originally proposed by |
Maxwell. (Id. 9:7-24.) The court agreed that it would “so order” Maxwell’s proposed version :
