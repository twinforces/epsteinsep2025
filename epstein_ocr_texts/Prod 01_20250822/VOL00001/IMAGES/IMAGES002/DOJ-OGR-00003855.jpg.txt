searches did not occur, witnesses were not interviewed. The government’s modus operandi
can be summed up in two words: “willful blindness.”

Consistent with its “willful blindness” policy, the government has intentionally and
methodically avoided obtaining substantial exculpatory evidence in the possession of third
parties. By way of example, Alleged Victim 2 kept what she claimed was a contemporary
journal of the events surrounding her meetings with Epstein. The “journal” does not mention
Ms. Maxwell and contains no reference to any alleged sexual misconduct. The absence of any
contemporaneous recording about Ms. Maxwell is powerful evidence of innocence.
Importantly, it is the whole journal that is significant—that there are references to other
contemporaneous events supplies context and detail about the paucity (or more accurately,
absence) of Ms. Maxwell’s involvement. When asked to produce the journal, the
government’s response was “we don’t have it.” The same is true about other physical
evidence, including boots, photographs, and documents.

Although all the alleged victims in this matter have monetized their claims against
Epstein and others, including Ms. Maxwell, the government has failed to investigate those
financial gains or the lawyers fomenting them and their own self-interest in monetary
outcomes. Again, this is powerful evidence of innocence.

The government, singularly focused on obtaining a conviction at any cost, has
abandoned fair play and the pursuit of justice. Accordingly, it is Ms. Maxwell who must use
the subpoena process to secure specific, necessary, relevant, and exculpatory evidence for a
fair hearing on her motions and in presentation of her defense at trial. Ms. Maxwell’s Rule 17
subpoena is necessary to vindicate her constitutional right to present a defense. See Crane v.
