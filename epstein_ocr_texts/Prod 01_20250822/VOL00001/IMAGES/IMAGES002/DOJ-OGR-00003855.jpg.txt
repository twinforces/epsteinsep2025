starches didnot occur; Witnesses were not interviewed. The government’s modus operandi
can.be summed:up in two words: “willful blindness.”

Consistent with. its “willful blindness” policy, the goyvernment.has intentionally. and

contemporancous recording about. Ms. Maxwell is powerful evidence of;innocence.
Importantly, it 1s'the whole. journal that is significant—that there are references’to other
‘contemporancous events supplics context-and detail about the paucity (or more accurately,

Epstein. and others, including Ms. Maxwell, the government has failed.to investigate:those
financial gains or the lawyers fomenting them and their own sclf-interest, in monetary:
outcomes. Again, ‘this is powerful evidence of infiocence:

The ‘government, singularly focused. on. obtaining, a conviction at any cost, has.
abandoned fair play:and the pursuit of justice. Accordingly, it is;Ms. Maxwell who must-use
