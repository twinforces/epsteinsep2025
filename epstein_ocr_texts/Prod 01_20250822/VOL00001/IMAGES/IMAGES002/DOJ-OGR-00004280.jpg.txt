ago when the events were still recent.° Accordingly, because the USAO-SDNY is bound by the
terms of the NPA as to the offenses charged in Counts Five and Six for the reasons discussed
below, Ms. Maxwell cannot be prosecuted for those counts.

B. The NPA Binds the Southern District of New York as to Counts Five and Six.

Although the Court ruled that the NPA does not bind the USAO-SDNY as to the charges
in the S1 Indictment (Dkt. 207 at 4-6), the NPA does bind the USAO-SDNY as to the sex
trafficking offenses charged in Counts Five and Six that were added to the S2 Indictment.
United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670 (1985) and its progeny, which the Court relied upon in its
earlier ruling, do not mandate a different result. In its prior ruling, the Court noted that Annabi
established “something akin to a clear statement rule” that a plea agreement binds only the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the district in which the plea is entered “unless it affirmatively appears that
the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” (Dkt. 207 at 4 (quoting Annabi, 771 F.2d at
672). That interpretive rule, however, only applies in situations where the district bringing the
second prosecution charges offenses different from the offenses resolved by the plea agreement
in the first prosecution. Annabi itself specifically noted that it was not addressing a situation
where the charges in the follow-on prosecution are “identical to the dismissed charges.” Annabi,
771 F.2d at 672. Accordingly, the Court is not bound by the rule in Annabi because Counts Five
and Six are identical to the charges presented to the SDFL grand jury that were resolved by the
NPA. When examined without the overlay of Annabi, the terms and the drafting history of the
NPA indicate that the agreement should be read to preclude other districts, including the USAO-
° Accuser-4’s statements to the FBI, and any other prior statements in which she did not mention Ms. Maxwell, are
exculpatory Brady material that the government should immediately produce to the defense. (See Section VII infra).
