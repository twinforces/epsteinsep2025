Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 382 Filed 10/29/21 Page 39 of 69

Accordingly, the Florida Investigation will already be a central part of the case presented
to'the jury. It will not. be confusing or distracting to clicit evidence of how’ that investigation
concluded, as the government.contends. See:Mot. at 27. In fact, the:opposite is true. Without
that evidence, the jury will’be left to speculate how and when the Florida Investigation ended,
and whether .Ms. Maxwell was, charged in connection with that investigation. Accordingly,
eliciting ‘evidence of how the Florida Investigation ended, including whowas (and-was not)
charged. in the proposed indictment, and who'was (and was'‘not) immunized. in the NPA, will be
necessary: to-avoid jury. confusion and speculation, as‘well as. prejudice:to Ms. Maxwell.

The government also suggests that introducing the NPA ‘would. require an.extended “trial.
within a trial” concerning the. history of its creation, which was the subject of the 290-page report
from the Department of Justice Office of Professional Responsibility (the “OPR. Report”). Mot.
‘at 27-28. Not-so. The defense: has‘no interest in‘probing the minutiac of the circumstances
surrounding the création ofthe NPA. Itscems even, less likely that the government would do. so,
given that:the OPR ‘Report found that the NPA was “flawed” and was extremely critical of how
‘the U.S. Attorncy: forthe Southern District of Florida, Alexander Acosta, handled the resolution
of the investigation. OPR Report.at.284. The risk of delay or juror confusion by. putting the.

NPA at issuc ‘in, the trial is therefore illusory. It should, not-be exeluded under Rule 403.”°

°"-The'NPAvis also not hearsay. It is an agreement thathas independent Iegal.significance and jis a “verbal
act
