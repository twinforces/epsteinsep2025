To Be Filed: Under Seal

strong presumption. against access to. documents . ... we have held more recently in United States.
v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir.1995).CAmodeo I ), that a subspecies of sealed documents
in civil cases—so-called ‘judicial documents’—deserve a'presumption in.favor of access.”)
(emphasis in original), That, 1 gather, is‘the subject of'the pending appeal. Press reports of the
oral argument suggest'that.perhaps the necessary findings might not have been made before
certain.court filings were sealed. I cannot and will-not pretend not to know that:the. issue is out
there. However, know of no reason:why it‘would-have been improper to shield sensitive.
materials from public disclosure before any court filings were made.

D. If, Any Party Relied on the Protective Order To Shield Confidential
Materials ‘from Disclosure to Law Enforcement, That Reliance Was
Unreasonable

Under. Martindell, a court must consider the degree'to which the party opposing unsealing
(or, in this case, the party who could. be expected to. oppose unsealing) reasonably relied on'the
protective order. “Once a confidentiality order‘has been, entered and relied upon, it can only be
modified if an “extraordinaty circumstance’ or ‘compelling need’ warrants the requested
modification.” F.D.LC. y. Ernst & Ernst, 677 F.2d 230, 232 (2d.Cir. 1982) (emphasis added)
(internal quotation omitted).

I will assume, for purposes. of argument, that: Maxwell. would. oppose releasing Boies
Schiller fromthe terms of the Protective Order in order to accommodate the grand jury
subpoena; that is faitly obvious from her refusal to: agree to a:protective order that would have
permitted Boies Schiller to comply with the subpoena without a court order authorizing
compliance., I further assume:she would argue that she.relied on the Protective Order in deciding
whether and howto comply. with various discovery requests. The question to. be decided is

whether such reliance was reasonable.
