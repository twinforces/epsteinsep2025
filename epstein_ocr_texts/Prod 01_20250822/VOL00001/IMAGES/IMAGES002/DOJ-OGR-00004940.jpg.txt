strong presumption against access to documents . . . we have held more recently in United States
v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir.1995) (‘Amodeo I ), that a subspecies of sealed documents
in civil cases—so-called ‘judicial documents’—deserve a presumption in favor of access.”’)
(emphasis in original). That, I gather, is the subject of the pending appeal. Press reports of the
oral argument suggest that perhaps the necessary findings might not have been made before
certain court filings were sealed. I cannot and will not pretend not to know that the issue is out
there. However, I know of no reason why it would have been improper to shield sensitive |
materials from public disclosure before any court filings were made. :
D. If Any Party Relied on the Protective Order To Shield Confidential |
Materials from Disclosure to Law Enforcement, That Reliance Was
Unreasonable |
Under Martindell, a court must consider the degree to which the party opposing unsealing |
(or, in this case, the party who could be expected to oppose unsealing) reasonably relied on the |
protective order. “Once a confidentiality order has been entered and relied upon, it can only be |
modified if an ‘extraordinary circumstance’ or ‘compelling need’ warrants the requested |
modification.” F.D.LC. v. Ernst & Ernst, 677 F.2d 230, 232 (2d Cir. 1982) (emphasis added) |
(internal quotation omitted). |
I will assume, for purposes of argument, that Maxwell would oppose releasing Boies |
Schiller from the terms of the Protective Order in order to accommodate the grand jury |
subpoena; that is fairly obvious from her refusal to agree to a protective order that would have |
permitted Boies Schiller to comply with the subpoena without a court order authorizing |
compliance. I further assume she would argue that she relied on the Protective Order in deciding |
whether and how to comply with various discovery requests. The question to be decided is |
whether such reliance was reasonable. |
