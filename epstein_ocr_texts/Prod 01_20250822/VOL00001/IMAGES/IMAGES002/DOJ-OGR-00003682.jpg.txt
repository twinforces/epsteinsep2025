Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 8of34

C. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing

In the alternative to dismissing the indictment, Maxwell requests that the Court conduct
an evidentiary hearing as to the parties’ intent in the NPA. The Court finds no basis to do so.

The cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings on the scope of a plea agreement
mostly involved oral agreements where there was no written record of the full set of terms
reached by the parties. All of them involved defendants with first-hand knowledge of
negotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an oral promise. “An oral agreement greatly
increases the potential for disputes such as . . . a failure to agree on the existence, let alone the
terms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 90 (2d Cir. 2002). Thus, an
evidentiary hearing may be necessary to determine the terms of an agreement never committed to
writing. This is no such case. The NPA’s terms are clear. Beyond the NPA itself, an extensive
OPR report details its negotiation history. No record evidence suggests that prosecutors
promised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing. The Court agrees with the
Government that Maxwell’s request for a hearing rests on mere conjecture.

For the same reason, the Court will not order the discovery on the NPA. In any case, it
appears that the Government has already produced two of the documents Maxwell seeks in her
motion—the OPR report and notes mentioned in a privilege log. Of course, the Government’s
disclosure obligations would require it to disclose to Maxwell any exculpatory evidence or
evidence material to preparing the defense, including any evidence supporting a defense under
the NPA. The Government shall confirm in writing within one week whether it views any
evidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA as material it is required to disclose,
and, if so, whether it has disclosed any and all such evidence in its possession.
