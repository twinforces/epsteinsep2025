to join this action, on the condition that they not re-litigate any issues already litigated by Jane

current victims. Accordingly, they desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights as well.
Because the new victims will not re-litigate any issues previously litigated by the current victims
(and because they are represented by the same legal counsel as the current victims), the
Government will not be prejudiced if the Court grants the motion. The Court may “at any time”
add new parties to the action, Fed. R. Civ. P. 21. Accordingly, the Court should grant the
motion.!
