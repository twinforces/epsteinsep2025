with the intent that they engage in illegal sex acts. In other words, Count One requires proof of an
agreement to transport, while Count Three requires proof of an agreement to entice. Transportation
does not necessarily require enticement, and likewise enticement to travel does not necessarily
require transportation. See United States v. Griffith, No. 99 Cr. 786 (HB), 2000 WL 1253265, at
*4 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 5, 2000) (denying post-trial motion to dismiss as multiplicitous 18 U.S.C.
§ 2422 transportation charge and 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) enticement charge involving same alleged
conduct and noting “[t]hat persuasion and transportation involve proof of different facts is hardly
contentious”).

Here, it is possible that the jury could conclude, after hearing all the evidence, that the
defendant agreed to transport one or more minors interstate, but that she did not agree to entice
minors to travel. For example, the jury could theoretically conclude that although the defendant
agreed to arrange transportation for a minor victim, the defendant herself did not agree to persuade
or entice a minor victim to travel. Likewise, the jury could theoretically conclude that the
defendant agreed to entice, or encourage, one or more minors to travel interstate, but she did not
agree to actually transport or assist in the transportation itself. Although the Government expects
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant in fact agreed both to entice and to transport
one or more minor victims, it is possible that the jury may reach a different conclusion. Depending
on the inferences the jury draws from the evidence presented at trial, it could convict on one
conspiracy count while acquitting on the other, or it could conclude that the defendant agreed both
to transport and to entice, in which case it could convict on both counts. That possibility means
that a motion to dismiss counts as multiplicitous is premature. Because the Government has the
discretion to present to the jury both the theory that the defendant agreed to transport and the theory
that the defendant agreed to entice, the defense motion is premature. See Josephberg, 459 F.3d at
