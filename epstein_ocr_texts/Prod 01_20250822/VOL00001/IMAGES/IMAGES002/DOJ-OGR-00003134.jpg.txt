with the intent,that they engage in illegal sex acts. In other words, Count One requires proof of an
agrecmicnt'to transport, while Count Threeé requires proof of an.agreement to entice. Transportation
does not. necessarily require enticement, and. likewise: enticement to travel.does not. necessarily
require ‘transportation. See United States. Griffith, No. 99 Cr. 786 (HB), 2000. WL 1253265, at:

Here, it is possible that. the jury could, conclude, after ‘hearing all the evidence, that, the

minors to travel. For example, the jury could theoretically conclude: that although. the ‘defendant
agreed,to arrange transportation for’a.minor victim, the defendant herself did.not agree’to persuade
or, entice, a minor Vietim to travel. Likewise, the jury’ could ‘theoretically conclude. that the
defendant. agreed to entice, or cncourage, one: or more minors to travel interstate, but she did not:
agree to actually: transport or assist. in the transportation itself: Although the ‘Government expects
to'prove beyond a reasonable doubt'thatthe defendant:in fact agreed both:to entice and:to-transport.
one or more minor victims, it,is possible that the jury:may reach.a.different.conclusion. Depending
on the infercrices the jury draws from the ¢vidence presented, at, trial, it could. convict. on one
conspiracy count while acquitting on.the:other, or it could conclude that the defendant agreed both.
to transport and to entice, in which case.it:could convict:on both counts. That possibility mcans
that .a. motion ‘to dismiss counts, as. multiplicitous is ‘prcmature. Because the Government has the
discretion,to present'to the jury both,the theory that the defendant-agreed to:transport andthe theory:

‘that the defendant.agrced to entice, the defense motion Is, premature. Sceé.Josephberg, 459 F.3d.at.
