Henry, 861 F. Supp. at 1197; see also Mitlof, 2014 WL 4243657, at *2 (recognizing that “care

particulars contained in the bill”); United States v. Samsonov, No. 07 Cr. 1198 (CM), 2009 WL
176721, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 23, 2009) (“The vehicle of a bill of particulars serves to inform a
defendant of the nature of the charge, when he is otherwise insufficiently informed, and must not
be misused to compel disclosure of how much the Government can prove, nor to foreclose the
Government from using proof it may develop as the trial approaches.”). Moreover, where the
Government’s provision of particulars is tantamount to an itemized preview of its proof, it creates
the very real danger that a defendant will “tailor her testimony to explain away the Government’s
case.” Henry, 861 F. Supp. at 1197. These concerns animate the rule that “if the defendant has
been given adequate notice of the charges against her and can prepare fully for trial with reasonably
diligent efforts, the Government cannot be required to disclose additional details about its case.”

to cover up that conduct during her civil deposition testimony in 2016. Specifically, the Indictment
makes plain that the defendant is charged with engaging in a conspiracy to transport minor girls
with intent that they engage in sexual activity with Epstein, engaging in a conspiracy to entice
