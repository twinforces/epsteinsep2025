practice.”); United States v. Drago, No. 18 Cr. 0394 (SJF) (AYS), 2019 WL 3072288, at *2
(E.D.N.Y. July 15, 2019) (denying motion to dismiss on the ground of pre-indictment delay
without prejudice to renewal).

Because the defendant cannot meet her “heavy burden” of establishing either element of
unconstitutional delay, let alone both, her motion to dismiss the $2 Indictment for pre-indictment
delay is meritless and should be denied.

V. The Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Count Five and Either Count One or Count
Three as Multiplicitous Is Premature

The defendant moves to dismiss Counts One, Three, or Five on the ground that they are
multiplicitous. Consistent with this Court’s prior ruling on a nearly identical issue, this motion
should be denied as premature. (See Apr. Op. at 27-28). Each of these three counts charges the
defendant with conspiring to commit distinct and separate crimes. In particular, Count One alleges
that the defendant agreed to entice minors to travel, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2422, Count Three
alleges that she agreed to transport minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a), and Count Five
alleges that she agreed to engage in the sex trafficking of minors, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591.
See S2 Indictment 9 11-13, 17-19, 23-25. Given the different objects of each conspiracy count,
a jury could possibly find that the defendant committed some but not all of these charged offenses,
and the Court will be best positioned to complete any multiplicity analysis after a full factual record
is developed at trial. Accordingly, and consistent with the Second Circuit’s prior finding that
district courts should defer ruling on a multiplicity challenge until after trial, this motion should
be denied as premature. United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir. 2006) (per
curiam).
