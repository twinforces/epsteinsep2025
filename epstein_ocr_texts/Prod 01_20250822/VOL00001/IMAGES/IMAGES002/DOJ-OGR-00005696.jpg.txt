Flight is, at. most, circumstantial evidence of guilt,and its probative value “depends upon,
the degree: of confidence with which four inférencés can be drawn: (1) fron the :defendant’s
behavior to flight; (2) from. flight:to consciousness of. guilt; (3) .from consciousness of guilt to
consciousness of guilt coneerning the crime charged; and (4) from, consciousness of guilt
concerming ‘the, crime charged to actual. guilt of the crime charged.” .A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 424
(quoting Mvers, 550 F.2d.at: 1049). “Because ofthe inherent unreliability of evidence of flight,
and the danger of prejudice its ‘use ‘may: entail, a flight instruction. is ‘improper unless the evidence:
is sufficient to furnish reasonable support ‘for all four of the necessary inferences.” Myers, 550.
F.2d at 1050 (internal, citations omitted). An adequate evidentiary predicate “must include some’
evidence surrounding the failure to appear ....and must'thereby provide: the jury'with more than
an. opportunity:for mere conjecture and:speculation.” United States'v. Sanchez, 790. F.2d.245,
252 (2d Cir. 1986) (internal quotations. and citations omitted) (emphasis. in original).

Il. The Government Should Not Be Permitted to Introduce Evidence of Alléged

“Flight” or Argue that Ms. Maxwell’s Conduct After. Epstein’s Death Is Proof of
Consciousness: of Guilt

The government cannot establish a satisfactory factual predicate for the jury to infer that
Ms. Maxwell was, in fact, flecing, or evading law:enforcement authorities after the arrest of
Jeffrey Epstein, or that her conduct; is proof of consciousness of guilt. ‘The reason is, simple —
those inferences are entirely speculative and demonstrably false. Ms. Maxwell ever once left
the country after Epstein’s arrest, nor has the government produced any evidence that she was
planning’ to flee, despite having reccived a.grand jury subpocna and.knowing that she was
‘considered. a subjcct-of the ongoing FBI. investigation. Instead, she. found.a permanent residence
‘remained in.regular contact with the prosecutors through her attorneys. As ‘previously discussed,

Ms. Maxwell also addressed and-rebutted.cach-point that the government.referenced in. its bail
