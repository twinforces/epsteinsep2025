B. May — June:23, 2008: Review by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General.

Also on ‘May 19,2008, Starr and Whitley co-authored a letter to‘Deputy Attorney General
Mark Filip asking for.review “of the federal involvement in,a quintessentially state matter”! In,
the letter, they acknowledged, that:‘CEOS had recently completed. “a ‘very’ limited ‘review” of the
Epstein. case, but conterided ‘that. “full. review of all the facts, is urgently needed at. senior levels, of
the Justice Department.” They argued that federal: prosecution of Epstein was “unwarranted,” and
that “the irregularity: of conduct by'prosecutors ; and.the unorthodox, terms ofthe [NPA] are beyond.
any reasonable interpretation of the scope of.a, prosecutor’s responsibilities.” They. followed up
with a second Icttcr on May:27, 2008, in‘which they.asserted “the bedrock:need. for‘integrity. in ‘the
enforcement of federal criminal laws” and. “the profound. questions raised by the unprecedented.
extension of federal laws . . . toa prominent public figure:who has. close tics to President Clinton”
required. Departmental review. On’this latter point, they argued. that Epstein. ‘ “entered, the public:
arena only’ by virtue-of his close personal, association with former President. Bill Clinton,” and that.
there was “little doubt” that the USAO “never would have contemplated. a prosceution.in'this case
if Mr. Epstein were: just afiother ‘John.’ This was the: first. défense submission ‘mentioning
Epstein’s connection to Président Clinton and:raising the insinuation.that'the, federal, involvement’
in-the investigation:was duc:to politics.

In, the May 27, 2008 letter to the Deputy Attorney General, Starr and, Whitley used, the
existing, x June: 2, 2008 deadline forthe éentry.of Epstein’s guilty plea to argue that! it made. the need,
for review of the case “all the more exigent.” John Roth, a Scnior Associate Deputy Attorney
General ‘who was handling the: matter, instructed the: USAO to rescind. the deadline, and. on.
May 28, 2008, Sloman, notified. Lefkowitz that the USAO ‘had ‘postponed ‘the deadline ‘pending
completion of the review by’ the ‘Deputy Attorney Gencral’s. office.'”” Mcanwhile, the: Criminal.
