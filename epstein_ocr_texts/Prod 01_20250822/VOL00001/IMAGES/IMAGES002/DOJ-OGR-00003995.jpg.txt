the dispersed locations of the witnesses are formidable challenges, even without the difficulties
imposed on travel by COVID.

Defense counsel are reviewing the 20,000 pages of information relating to 225 potential
witnesses and, simultaneously, attempting to locate the various potential witnesses to conduct
defense interviews. Defense interviews are necessary because of the government’s continued
refusal to affirmatively investigate exculpatory evidence. Of the 302s reviewed by defense
counsel a pervasive tactic has emerged: as soon as the witness begins to provide information
helpful to the defense the interview is terminated by the government. Had the government asked
logical follow-up questions defense interviews might not be necessary.

The government has had years to investigate these allegations (dating decades ago, from
1994-2004) using the enormous resources at its disposal, including multiple grand juries, scores
of agents, and teams of prosecutors. It is unreasonable to expect that Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers can
conduct a COVID-burdened review of 20,000 pages of interviews with 225 potential witnesses
while preparing for a trial less than 90 days away.

D. The new charges require additional defense investigation and preparation.

Dozens of the statements produced support Ms. Maxwell’s defense and will require
further defense investigation. Defense investigation is a key component to providing effective
assistance of counsel and the duty of counsel to diligently carry out this task is well established.
