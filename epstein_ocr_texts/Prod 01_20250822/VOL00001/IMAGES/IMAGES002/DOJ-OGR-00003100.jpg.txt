orif the counts have a sufficient logical coninéction.” United. States v. Pages; 657 F.3d.126, 129
(2d Cir. 20.11) (internal. quotation marks and citations omitted). “For purposes of analysis under
Rule:8(a),” however, “no-one characteristic is. always sufficient to establish ‘similarity’ of offenses,
and cach case depends largely on its:own. facts.” United States. v. Blakney, 941, F.2d 114, 1:16 (2d
Cir, 1991) (internal quotations and citations omitted). For instance, in Wnited States v, Werner,
620..F.2d 922.(2d:Cir. 1980), the “Sccond Circuit: found sufficient; similarity’ betwecn two cargo

offenses arose out of [defendant’s] scheme to use his position as an insider . . .. to ‘obtain 'money or
‘property carried by it’” Wnited States v. Smith, No.'05 Cr. 922: (DLC), 2007 WL. 9804311, at, *2

Oct. 19, 2018) (citing Werner, 620 F.2d at.927). Specifically. in the context of:perjury, “[t]he law’
‘in this circuit clearly supports the joinder. of underlying’ substantive ‘crimes: with perjury: counts
where, as here, the false declarations concern the'substantive offenses.” United States v. Potamitis,
739 F.2d 784,791, (2d Cir. 1984); see Unitéd States’y. Sweig, 441 F.2d 114, 118 (2d Cir. 1971).

made as’part of. an investigation, into the specific substantive conduct. See United States v., Ruiz,
