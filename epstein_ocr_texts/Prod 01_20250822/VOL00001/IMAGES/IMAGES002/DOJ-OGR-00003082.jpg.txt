natural meaning in the context in which words were used they were materially untrue, perjury was
established.” United States v. Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d 1218, 1221 (2d Cir. 1976). Critically, and as
noted with respect to Lighte above, courts generally evaluate whether a challenge to a perjury
count on the basis that a question was fundamentally ambiguous after trial and following the
development of a full factual record. See, e.g., Strohm, 671 at 1175 (appeal following conviction);
Sarwari, 669 F.3d at 406 (same); Farmer, 137 F.3d at 1269 (appeal following conviction and
partial Rule 29 dismissal) Markiewicz, 978 F.2d at 808 (appeal following conviction); cf’ United
States v. Forde, 740 F. Supp. 2d 406, 413 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (denying a motion to dismiss a perjury
count). Indeed, the defendant cites no case in which a court has dismissed a perjury count on the
basis of “fundamental ambiguity” before trial.

Because perjury requires a knowing false statement, the law does not permit conviction
based on answers that are literally true. See Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374. Nor can a conviction rest on
answers that are literally true but unresponsive, and therefore “arguably misleading by negative
implication.” /d.; see Bronston v. United States, 409 U.S. 352, 362 (1973). But when “the answer
is false, the fact that it is unresponsive is immaterial.” United States v. Corr, 543 F.2d 1042, 1049
(2d Cir. 1976). Even statements that “could be literally true in isolation” can support a perjury
conviction if they are “materially untrue” in “the context in which the statements were made.”
United States v. Schafrick, 871 F.2d 300, 304 (2d Cir. 1989). “[U]nless the questioning is
fundamentally ambiguous or imprecise, the truthfulness of [the defendant’s] answers is an issue
for the jury.” Jd. at 304; see United States v. Kaplan, 758 F. App’x 34, 39 (2d Cir. 2018) (same);
cf. Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374 (finding the evidence insufficient where some answers “were literally
true under any conceivable interpretation of the questions”).
