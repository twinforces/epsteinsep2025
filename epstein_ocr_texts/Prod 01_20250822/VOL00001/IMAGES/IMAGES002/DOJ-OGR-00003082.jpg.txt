natural meaning in.the context in which words were used-they were materially untruc, perjury. was
established.” Unitéd States ¥. Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d 1218, 1221 (2d Cir. 1976). Critically, and.as
noted. with respect to Lighte above, courts. generally evaluate whether a. challenge ‘to a perjury
count on the basis that a question. was fundamentally ambiguous afier trial ‘and following the
development of.a full factual record. See; e.g., Strohm, 671 at 1.75 (appeal following conviction);
Sarwari, 669. F.3d at 406 (same); Farmer, 137 F.3d-at 1269 (appeal, following conyiction and.
partial Rule.29 dismissal) Markiewicz; 978 F.2d at-808 (appeal following conviction); cf United
States v. Forde, 740. F. Supp. 2d 406, 413: (S.D.N.¥..2010) (denying a motion to .dismiss.a perjury:
count). Indeed, the defendant, cites no case in which a court-has dismissed a perjury count on the
basis of “fundamental ambiguity” before trial.

Because perjury requires.a. knowing false statement, ‘the law docs not. permit conviction.
based on answers 'that'are literally true. See Lighic, 782, F.2d at 374. Nor can a conviction rest on,
answers that are literally truc but unresponsive, and. therefore “arguably: misleading by negative
implication.” /d.; see Bronston-y. United:States, 409 'U:S, 352, 362 (1973). Butwhen, “the answer
is false, the fact: that: it-is unresponsive is immaterial.” United States v2 Gorr, 543 F.2d 1042, 1049
(2d Cir. 1976). Even statements that.“could be literally: true in isolation” can support a. perjury:
conviction if they are “materially untrue” in “the context in which the statements were made.”
United. Statés v. Séhafrick, 871 F.2d 300, 304 (2d Cir. 1989). “[U]nless the questioning is
fundamentally ambiguous or imprecise, the: truthfulness of [the defendant’s] answers is an issue
for the jury.” /d..at-304: sce United States v. Kaplan, 758 F. App’x, 34, 39 (2d Cir. 20.18) (same);
cf Lighte, 782 F.2d at.374 (finding the evidence. insufficient where. some. answers, “were literally

truc‘under any conceivable interpretation, of the questions”).
