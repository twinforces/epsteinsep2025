3. The NPA Did. Not Violate Department Policy Relating ‘to Deportation
of Criminal Aliens

During ‘the. negotiations, the USAO rejceted a defensc-offered, provision prohibiting the
USAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration. authorities to
institute immigration, ‘proccedings” against: two female assistants. However, OPR. considered.
whether the April, 28, 1995 memorandum imposed any obligation on the USAO to prosecute
Epstein’s two female assistants who were known. to be foreign nationals=as Villafafia, urged in
her: prosecution memorandum—anid thus trigger theirremoval, or conversely, whether it'preeluded
the USAO from agrecing not.to prosccute: them as part of.a negotiated resolution. OPR :-found

nothing. in the policy that: created a.clear and unambiguous standard in cither regard.

The Attorney Gencral’s April 28, 1995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal
Alicns” directed federal, prosecutors to beéome involved actively and directly’ in the process of
removing: criminal alicns. from the United States, and, alongwith USAM § 9-73.520, provided that.

“fall deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary circumstances exist.”
However, Epstein’s two assistants were not “deportablc” unless.and until convicted.of a crime’ that.
would have triggered their'removal. But neither the policy. memorandum ‘nor the USAM imposed
an obligation on the USAO‘to prosecute or secure a conviction against a foreign national nor did.
cither provision. preclude the USAO fron declining t6 prosccute.an. alien using, the same broad
discretion that otherwise applies to charging decisions.

The policy guidance also requires. “prompt and ‘close coordination” with, immigration.
officials in cases: involving x alien defendanits.and specifics that prosecutors ‘must notify immigration
authorities before cngaging in plea negotiations. with alien defendants. OPR, learned during its
investigation that an ICE agent ‘participated. in. the Epstein investigation in its carly stages.
Morcover, because the USAO never ‘engaged. in plea negotiations with, the two female: assistants,
who, in any cvent, had ‘not ‘been charged and were: therefore not. “defendants,” ‘no further:
notification’was, required.

IV. THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT ESTABLISH THAT THE SUBJECTS WERE
INFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE IN THE NPA TERMS
FAVORABLE TO EPSTEIN OR TO OTHERWISE EXTEND BENEFITS TO
EPSTEIN

OPR. investigated. whether any: of the: subjects—Acosta, Sloman, -Menchel, Louric, or
Villafatia—was influenced.by corruption, bias, or other improper motive, such as Epstein’s wealth,
status, or political,'associations, to include terms in the NPA that. were ‘favorable to Epstein, or
whether such motives otherwise affected the outcome of the fedcral investigation. OPR.
considered ‘the. case-speecific, tcasons the subjects. identificd as the niotivation. for the USAO’s
July 31, 2007 “term sheet” and. Acosta’s: approval of the NPA ‘in September 2007. OPR also
thoroughly ‘examined ‘various factors forming the basis for allegations that the subjects were
motivated. by improper influcnees, including the subjects” preexisting relationships with defense
counscl: the subjects’ numerous ‘meetings ‘with Epstcin’s team. of nationally known attorneys:
emails between the subjects—particularly Villafatia—and defense. counsel. that.appeared, friendly,
casual,.and deferential to.defense counsel; and:inclusion in the NPA ofa broad provision declining:
