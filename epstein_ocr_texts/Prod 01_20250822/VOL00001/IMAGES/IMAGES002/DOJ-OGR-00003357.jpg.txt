stages of the negotiations.

As discussed: below, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-
year offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable-to determine the
reasoning: underlying the. decision. to offer two years as ‘the term of incarceration, as opposed. to
any other term of: years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence'that.Acosta was aware of
and, approved the initial, offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.
The only evidence suggesting that:-the offer of two’ years stemmed from an improper‘motivation of.
Méenchel’s was a single second-hand, statement in an email. drafted many years later. Sloman, the:
purported declarant, told:OPR that:he could not recall whether he:made‘the statement, but.he:firmly.
disputed that the cmail accurately reflected. cither the:.reason for the two-year. proposal or his
understanding of that. reason. Villafafia herself could remember little about. the critical,
conversation. with, Sloman, including whether she had recorded, accurately what Sloman, had ‘said.
Given the lack’ of any corroborating ¢vidence, and,'the evidence showing Epstein’s vigorous
resistance to the proposal, OPR. concludes. that there.:is no evidence. to. support the statement’ in.
Villafafia’s 2018 email that Menchel ‘had extended a two-ycar. plea deal as a favor ‘to one: of
Epstcin’s attorneys.

1. The Evidence Shows That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet: with
Epstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted. by Strategic Considerations

Although pre-indictment negotiations are: typical in whitc-collar:criminal cases. involving
financial.crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with.defense counsel are: infrequent

view, the significance of the carly meetings granted to the: defense team’‘was that, but for those

OPR’s investigation established that while‘the defense attorncys.persistently contacted the
