accept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead continued to press for a sentence of
home confinement, suggesting that the defense had not requested the two-year term as a favor and
did not view it as such. The defense had previously rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of
probation, and there is no indication in the contemporaneous records that Epstein viewed any jail
sentence favorably and certainly that did not appear to be the view of the defense team in the early
stages of the negotiations.

As discussed below, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis for the two-
year offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR was unable to determine the
reasoning underlying the decision to offer two years as the term of incarceration, as opposed to
any other term of years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that Acosta was aware of
and approved the initial offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.
The only evidence suggesting that the offer of two years stemmed from an improper motivation of
Menchel’s was a single second-hand statement in an email drafted many years later. Sloman, the
purported declarant, told OPR that he could not recall whether he made the statement, but he firmly
disputed that the email accurately reflected either the reason for the two-year proposal or his
understanding of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember little about the critical
conversation with Sloman, including whether she had recorded accurately what Sloman had said.
Given the lack of any corroborating evidence, and the evidence showing Epstein’s vigorous
resistance to the proposal, OPR concludes that there is no evidence to support the statement in
Villafafia’s 2018 email that Menchel had extended a two-year plea deal as a favor to one of
Epstein’s attorneys.

E. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with Defense

Counsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein

OPR considered whether decisions by Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie to meet with
defense counsel while possible charges were under consideration or during the period after the
NPA was signed and before Epstein entered his state guilty pleas evidenced improper favoritism
toward or the provision of an improper benefit to the Epstein defense team.

1. The Evidence Shows That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with
Epstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations

Although pre-indictment negotiations are typical in white-collar criminal cases involving
financial crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with defense counsel are infrequent
in sex offense cases. As the lead prosecutor, Villafafia vehemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s
attorneys and voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s
view, the significance of the early meetings granted to the defense team was that, but for those
meetings, the USAO would not have offered the disposition set forth in the July 31, 2007 “term
sheet” and, moreover, “that term sheet would never have been offered to anyone else.”

OPR’s investigation established that while the defense attorneys persistently contacted the
subjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in-person meetings
actually occurred with the USAO personnel involved in the matter. As shown in the chart on the
following page, while the case was under federal investigation and before the NPA was signed,
the subject supervisors and defense counsel had five substantive meetings about the case—
