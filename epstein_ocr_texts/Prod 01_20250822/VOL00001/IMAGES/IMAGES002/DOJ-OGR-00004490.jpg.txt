entitled. to: significant weight, and.OPR. credits them. OPR finds, therefore, that the: emails jin,
question do ‘not themselves establish, that Villafafia, (or-any other subject) acted to improperly:
benefit Epstcin, was motivated. by: favoritism, or other improper influences, or sought to silence
victims.

G. The Evidence: Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafana Agreed, to
the NPA’s Provision Promising Not to _Prosecute “Potential, Co-conspirators”
in Order to Protect Any’ of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential
Associates:

OPR. examined the decision by the subjects ‘who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,
and Acosta—to include, in;the agreement.a, provision in, which,the USAO agreed, not to prosecute
“any potential, co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four ‘named ‘individuals, to determine
whether that provision resulted ‘from the subjects” improper favoritism. towards Epstein or. an.
improper effort to:shicld from: prosecution any of Epstein’ 's known associates. Other than-various
drafts of the NPA. and ofa federal plea, agreement, OPR, found. little: in the contemporaneous
records mentioning 'the provision. and nothing indicating that.the subjects discussed or debated.it—
or even gave it. much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal ‘plea, agreement show’
that the final broad language promising not to‘prosccute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”
evolved from a:more:narrow provision-sought.by the.defensc. ‘The-provision.expanded.as Villafafia
and defense counsel. exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed. federal plea agreement and, then, of the
NPA, with apparently little analysis and no substantive discussion within, the USAO about, the
provision.237

As the NPA drafting ‘process ‘concluded, Villafafia circulated to Louric and. another
supervisor a draft. that contained ‘the :non-prosccution. provision, telling Louric it:was “some of
[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding ‘promiscs not to prosecute other pcople,” and.
commenting only, “I don’t think it;hurts.us.” In.a reply email, Lourie responded;to another issue:

287 As set forth:in OPR’s factual, discussion, carly: in the:negotiations over a.federal plea. agreement; the defense

sought..a non- prosecution provision applicable to: ‘only. four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed
employees: of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with,‘ “standard language” referring: to unnamed

“co-conspirators” so as to:av oid * ‘highlight[ing] for. the judge. all:of the other crimes-and.all of the other persons , that:
we; could charge.” Nonetheless, drafts of the NPA, sent: by Lefkowitz: after, Villafaiia’s email continued to include
language referring to the four: named assistants and. unnamed employees. Villafaiia, however; internally: ‘circulated
drafts ofa federal plea agreement that:included language stating, * “This agreement: resolv ros the federalcriminal liability
of the defendant and any co- conspirators in, the Southern, District of Florida growing out of any criminal, conduct: by;
those:persens known, to the [USAO].as of the: date; of-this pleasagreement?” The federal-plea agreement draft revised,
by 1 Lourie. and, Acosta on September 20; 2007, included that language: ‘When.the defense-team. reverted tonegotiation,
of state charges, Villafafia-adyised them, * “In:the context of a’ non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] ‘may. be more
willing to be specific, about not pursuing charges against others The; next day, Lefkowi itz sent a revised,draft/NPA,
referring: to the four;named. assistants, “any employee™ ofthe named companys, and“any:unnamed co-conspirators for
any eriminal,charge that ar ises outof the ongoing federal:iny estigation,” The language was finally:revised by Villafafia,
to prohibit ‘prosecution, of “any: potential, co-conspirators, of Epstein, including ' but: not limited to, [the four named,
assistants].”

In commenting: on :‘OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s ‘counsel and Lourie both noted that the, non: :prosecution
prov ision could bind.only the USAO, and Lourie further opined that it w as limited to certain specified. federal charges
and a time-limited scope of'conduct. ‘Although the non- prosecution: provision in the NPA did not.explicitly contain
such limitations, those limitations were included:in other parts of the;agreement.
