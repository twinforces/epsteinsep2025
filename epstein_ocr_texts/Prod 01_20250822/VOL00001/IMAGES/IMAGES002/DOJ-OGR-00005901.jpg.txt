However, this criticism may be countered if a definition of aggression were to include indirect
aggression, which sexual grooming could be considered to be.
Hall and Hirschman’s Quadripartite Model
Hall and Hirschman’s (1992) Quadripartite Model was first developed as a theory of rape, but
it was applied subsequently to child sexual abuse. This model suggests that someone commits
an act of child sexual abuse because of four vulnerability factors and the presence of
opportunity. The vulnerability factors are physiological sexual arousal, distorted cognitions
that act to justify sexual aggression, affective dyscontrol, and personality problems. It is
suggested that offending will occur when the presence of these vulnerability factors exceed a
threshold, this could include one or all of these vulnerabilities. There are several problems
with this model; first, it does not explain why someone chooses to offend against a child rather
than an adult. Second, sexual grooming is not an impulsive act and the threshold would need
to be maintained over a long period of time in order to explain sexual grooming, because it
can occur over weeks, months or even years. Hence, this theory can account for sexual
grooming if it is accepted that, for example, sexual arousal persists over long periods of time,
so once sexually aroused to children/child the offender would be continually aroused to them.
A further problem with this theory relates to the presence of opportunity; offenders often
create their own opportunities to offend.
Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model
Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (1984) suggests that there are four pre-conditions to sexual
offending. The first is the motivation to sexually abuse; it is suggested that this develops as a
result of emotional congruence (a fit between the offender’s emotional needs and the child’s
ability to meet them), deviant sexual arousal and blockage (the sexual needs of the offender
not being met by appropriate adults). The second is to be able to overcome internal inhibitors;
the third is to be able to overcome external inhibitors; and the fourth is to overcome the child’s
resistance. Before an incidence of abuse would take place, these pre-conditions need to be
satisfied. Although Finkelhor does not use the term sexual grooming, others (e.g. Morrison,
Erooga & Beckett, 1994; Sampson, 1994) have reviewed his work using this term. They
referred to overcoming the child’s resistance as grooming.
Ward and Siegert’s Pathways Model
Ward and Siegert’s (2002) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological
mechanisms—emotional regulation, intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and sexual
arousal (deviant sexual scripts). All the aforementioned psychological mechanisms are
involved to some degree. There is evidence of these dysfunctional mechanisms being present
typically in child molesters, although to different degrees and for different functions. The five
possible pathways are specified by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism is the
most dominant; in turn this will affect the others. In the case of the fifth pathway, all the
psychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A sexual offence occurs when the
above is present in conjunction with sexual need. In addition, Ward and Siegert still
emphasize the importance of there being an opportunity to offend; however, the nature of
sexual grooming is to create an opportunity to offend. Successful theory would need to
account for this.
