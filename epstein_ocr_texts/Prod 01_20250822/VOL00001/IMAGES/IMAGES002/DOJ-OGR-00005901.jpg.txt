Hall aid Hirschinan’s Quadripartite: Model.

’s (1992) Quadripartite Model was first developed-as a:theory-of fape, bit,
it was applicd subsequently. to, child sexual abuse. This model suggests:that someone,commits
an act of. child sexual. abuse: because of four vulnerability factors: and. the presence of
opportunity: The vulnerability ‘factors are physiological s¢xual. arousal, distorted, cognitions
that! act ‘to justify? yn, affective dyscontfol, and personaliw probléms. It-is
suggested that offending will occur when ‘the: presence of these vulnerability. factors ‘exceed, a
threshold;. this could ‘include:‘one or.all ‘of these: vulnerabilities. There ‘are several problems
‘with this model; first, it doesinot explain.why somcone:chooses to offend against a.child rather
than. an adult. Second, sexual groomihg is not an implilsive. act ‘andthe threshold would need
tobe maintained over a long period of time in order to explain. sexual grooming, because it.
can, occur. over: weeks; months :or even, years. Hence; this theory can account for sexual
grooming if it is ‘accepted-that, for’°example; sexual. arousal.persists over long periods ‘of time,

so. once sexually aroused. to children/child the offender would. be continually aroused to them.

A. further problem, with. this, ‘thi relates to the presence |
create their own opportunities to offend.

Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model.

Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model. (1984) suggests: that: there are. four preconditions to. sexual
offending: The first is' the motivation. to sexually abuse; it‘is ‘suggested. that‘this' develops as a
result ‘of emotional. congruence (a fit betwéen the offénder’s emotional needs ‘and. the ‘child’s
ability ‘to meetjthem), deviant sexual, arowisal, and ‘blockage: (the séxtal. needs. of the offender
not being met:by:appropriate;adults). The second is,to be able to°overcome internal inhibitors;
the'third isto betable to overcome: external inhibitors; and the fourthtis to. overcome? the child’s
resistance. Beforé an. incidence’ of ‘abuse ‘would take’ place, ‘these :pre-conditions nééd ‘to bé
gatistied.. Although -Finkelhof doés not tise: the term Sextal.groomitig, others («© g. Morrison,
Erooga, & Beckett, 1994, Sampson, 1994) have reviewed his. work. using this term. They:
referred to. overcoming the child’s resistance: as' grooming.

Ward and’ Siegert’ s! Pathways Model:

‘Ward. and Siegert’s (2002) model is based on the dysfunction of one or more psychological
mechanisms intimacy deficits, cognitive distortions and. sexual
arevsal. (deviant sexual scripts). All ‘the aforementioned. psychological mechanisms’ arc
involved to some ‘degree: ‘There is evidence ofthese. dysfunctional ‘mechanisms being present
typically in,child molesters, although to ‘different degrees and:for different:functions. The:five
possible ‘pathways'are specified. by whichever dysfunctional psychological mechanism. is' the
most. dominant? in'turh this will. affeer the others. In the case of*the. fifth. pathway; ‘all. the
psychological mechanisms would be similarly dysfunctional. A-Sexual offence. Occurs:when, thé
above: is: present in conjunction with sexual need. In. addition, Ward :and Siegert still
emphasize the importance of there being ‘an opportunity to) offend; however, the nature of
séxual ‘grooming‘ is to. create an. opportunity to offend. Successful theory ‘would need. ‘to
