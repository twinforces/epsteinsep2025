1 entirely too many stories like the one she just recounted on

2 the record.

3 I wish that the Attorney General, whoever, head of the
4 Bureau of Prisons and the leader of the Congress, would have

5 heard that presentation. The single thing in the five years

6 that I was chief judge of this court that made me the craziest
7 was my complete and utter inability to do anything meaningful

8 about the conditions at the MCC, especially at the MCC and the
9 MDC, two federal correctional facilities located in the City of
10 New York that are run by morons, which wardens cycle

11 repeatedly, never staying for longer than a few months or even
12 a year. So there is no continuity, there is no leadership,

13 there is no ability to get anything done. They lurch from

14 crisis to crisis, from the gun smuggling to Jeffrey Epstein,

15 none of which is the fault of Ms. Days or any of the other

16 inmates I have sentenced or will sentence.

17 It is the finding of this Court that the conditions to
18 which she was subjected are as disgusting, inhuman as anything
19 I've heard about any Colombian prison, but more so because
20 we're supposed to be better than that.
21 So if I could, Ms. Days, I would say you've been
22 punished enough, and I would send you home, but I can't. The
23 law doesn't allow me to sentence you to less than five years.
24 Some of what you've endured has been endured by prisoners even
25 in well-run facilities, some of it.
