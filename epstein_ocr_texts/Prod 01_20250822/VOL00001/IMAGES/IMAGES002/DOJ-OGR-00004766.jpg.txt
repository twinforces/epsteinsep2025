entirely todo many stories, like the oné she just recounted on

the record.

I wish, that the Attorney General, whoéver, head of the
Bureau. 'of Prisons. and the leader of the Congress, would have
hédrd ‘that presentation. The single thing in ‘the five years
that I was chief judge of this court that made me the craziest
was my Complete and utter inability to do dnything meaningful
about the conditions at the MCC, especially at the MCC and the
MDC, two féderal correctional facilities located in the City of
New York that are run by morons, which wardens cycle
repeatedly, névér staying for longer than a few months or even
a ‘year. So there is no continuity, there is no leadership,
there is no ability t6 gét anything déne. They lurch from
erisis to crisis, from the gun, smuggling to Jeffrey Epstein,
none 6f which is the fault of Ms. Days or any of the 6theér
inmates I have sentenced on will sentence.

It is the fanding of this Court that the conditidns to
which she was subjected, are as disgusting, inhuman, as anything
I've Heard abdéut any Golombian prison, but more sé bécauseé
we're supposed to be better than that.

So if I Gould, Ms. Days, I w6éuld say you've been
punished enough, and I would send ‘you home, but I can't. The
law d6esn't allow me to sentence you to less than five yéars-.
Some of what you've endured has been endured by prisoners even,
in. well-run facilities, some of it.
