Jil. Counts five and. six are not time-barred.

For most non-capital. offenses, the statute of limitations under federal law is five years.
18 U.S.C. §.3282(a). Congress has enacted. longer limitations periods for certain. crimes, in
particular for'“offensc[s] involving the sexual or physical ‘abuse, or kidnapping” ofa minor‘in, 1.8
US.C. § 3283. Priorto 2003, the limitations period. in § 3283 lasted until the victim reached the
age of 25, and then, Congress'extended the: limitations period-to the life of the victim:with the
PROTECT Act of 2003, Pub. L. No. 108-21, /117 Stat60. In 2006,:Congress enacted. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3299, which eliminated the statute of limitations for the sex trafficking of minors in-violation
of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 and. for:some other scx-crimes. See. 18 U.S.C. § 3299 (“Notwithstanding
any other law, an indictment may be found or an information ‘instituted at any time without
limitation for any offense under . . . section 1'591.”).

In. her previous motion, Maxwell argued, that the Mann, Act-charges against her in the
indiétment’were time-barred on. the grouinds,that'the extended limitations period. § 3283 ‘was not
applicable. The Court: denied that motion in, its April, 16, 2021, Opinion & Order. Maxwell, 2021
WEL 1518675, at:*5. Maxwell now argucs that.the new'charges the:'Government has brought
against.her. in-the:S2 indictment, Sex. Trafficking Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 37.1) and Sex
Trafficking (18 U.S.C, § 1591), are time-barred, as well. because § 3283 does not.apply to those
offensés cither. She renews her contention from.her previous motion. that the limitations period.
in. § 3283 only applics to offenses which “necessarily entail” the:sexual abuse of a minor.and
argues that a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 does not. Thus, ‘according ‘to Maxwell’s reasoning,
the general ‘five-ycar ‘statute of limitations period in, 18 U.S.C. § 3282(a) applics.to the scx
trafficking counts and, because the alleged ‘conduct occurred from, 2001 to 2004, the Government

is now time-barred for prosecuting’ her for these offenses.
