against. the two assistants wiho w were -e forcion nationals.

At this point, Lefkowitz again sought to speak to.Acosta, ‘who :repli¢d by email: “Iam.
happy to talk. My caveat iis that inthe middle of negotiations, u try to avoid[] undermining, my
staff by allowing “interlocutor{}y’ appeals so to: speak: so I'd want [Maric on,the call[.] I?ll have:
her set something up.”

Villafafia sent.'to Lefkowitz her own. revised NPA, telling him it was her “attempt at
combining our thoughts, ” but it had not “been approved.by theoffice yet.” She inserted solicitation.
of minors to engage in, prostitution, a-registrable offense, as the charge to. which Epstein. would.
plead guilty; ‘proposed a joint recommendation ‘for a 30- month sentenec, divided into 18 months.
in the county jail and 12 months of community control; and amended the § 2255 provision.!
Villafafia’s revision :tetairied the provision suspending the investigation and holding all. legal
Process | in abeyance, and she incorporated the ‘non- -prosecution provision while slightly altcring it
deleting | mention ‘of the: corporate ‘entity employees. "Finally, ‘Villafafia: deleted. mention of
immigration:procecdings, but. advised iin. her transmittal. email that “we have not.and don’t; plan to
ask immigration” procecdings to be initiafed.!"4

Later that day, Villafafia. alerted Lourie (who had.arrived.in Florida from Washington, D.C.
carly. that afternoon) and the:new West;Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line-supervisor and.
co-counscl) ‘that: she had ‘included. language that defense counsel had requested. ‘regarding’
‘promises ‘not to prosecute other people,” and commented, “I don’t think it hurts us.” There: is no
documentation that:Lourie, the West Palm.Beach:manager, or: anyone clse expressed. disagreement.
with Villafafia’s assessment. Rather, within. a few minutes, Villafafia re-sent. her email, adding
that defense-counsel was persisting in including an.immigration, waiver inthe: agreement, to'which,
Lourie responded, “No way. ‘We-don’t put that sort-of'thing in a’plea‘agreement.” Villafafia:replicd,
to Lourie, indicating she would, pass that along to defense counsel and adding, “Any other
thoughts?” When Lourie gave no‘further response, Villafana informed defénse:counscl:that'Louric
had. rejected the proposed immigration language.

OPR. questioned the subjects about; the USAO’s agreement not to prosecute “any potential.
co-conspirators.” Lourie did ‘riot recall’ why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated that he left.
that provision in.the NPA. because he believed at the time that it benefited the government in some
way. In particular, Lourie conjectured. that the promise: not. to prosccute “any potential
co-conspirators” protected victims: who had. recruited ‘others and. thus ‘potentially were
co-conspirators in,Epstein’s ‘scheme. ‘Lourie also told.OPR, “I bet the answer was that we. weren,t.
going to charge” Epstcin’s accomplices, because Acosta, “didn’t really‘want to charge Epstein” in

124 Villafanar noted that: she had consulted with:a USAO employee who was a; “former corporate counsel trom a,

hospital” about:the § N 2255. language, and:thought that the revised language “addresses the concern about haying an.
unlimited :nuniber, of:claimed v ictims, withoutime trying:to bind girls who ‘T-do not represent”?

Ds Villatana gave OPR.an explanation, similar to that given. by the case agents—that an ICE Special, Agent chad.
been.involved in the carly: stages of the-federal investigation of Epstein, and Villafaiia believed the agent knew two, of
Epstein’ s female assistants were: foreign nationals and would have acted: appropriately on that information. ‘Villafafia
also said that the USAO generally did:not.get involved in immigration issues.
