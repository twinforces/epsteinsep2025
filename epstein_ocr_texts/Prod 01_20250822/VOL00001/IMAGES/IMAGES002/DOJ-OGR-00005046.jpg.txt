Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 336 Filed 09/07/21 Page4of10
under Rule 404(b) or as res gestae evidence in conjunction with her sister’s allegations. See
First Motion at 11, 15-16. Maria Farmer is the individual who purportedly introduced her
younger sister to Jeffrey Epstein. In her civil lawsuit and in numerous public statements, Ms.
Maria Farmer has asserted that she has certain physical items that substantiate her allegations
against Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. She described in various publications certain
“envelopes” that she “still has” with the touch DNA and fingerprints of Jeffrey Epstein and
Ghislaine Maxwell.” Ms. Maxwell seeks to examine those envelopes and to test them in advance
of trial to disprove Maria Farmer’s claims.

Maria Farmer also reportedly met with attorneys Brad Edwards and Stanley Pottinger at
her home in Paducah, KY in or about June 2016. To counsel’s knowledge, those attorneys have
never represented Maria Farmer. Brad Edwards describes in his self-published memoir,
Relentless Pursuit, that Maria Farmer during that meeting showed him substantial physical
evidence corroborating her claims against Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell, including
photographs, diaries, telephone books, Rolodexes and mementos collected from her “time with
Epstein and Maxwell.” See Ex. 2(A). Ms. Maxwell also seeks to examine these items of
physical evidence in advance of trial so that her experts and investigation team may rebut any
such evidence and effectively confront this accuser. The requests for her attorneys’ fee
agreements and her EVCP Materials are identical to those in the BSF subpoena, but are being
requested directly from her in the event her attorneys claim they do not have constructive
possession or control over those items.

? In a podcast with journalist Whitney Webb which aired on May 26, 2020, Maria Farmer
claimed to possess “envelopes” that “still have the touch DNA and fingerprints on them” of
“Jeffrey and Ghislaine” and that she offered them to the FBI but the FBI said “we don’t need it.”
