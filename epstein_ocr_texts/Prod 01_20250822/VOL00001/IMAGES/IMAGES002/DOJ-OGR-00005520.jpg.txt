The government has the burden of proving the charges in the Indictment beyond a
reasonable doubt. The defense bears no burden and is not obligated to disclose defense theory or
strategy unless required by statute. The government seems overly concerned that the jury will be
confused, a reference it uses 24 times throughout its Motions in Limine, and that the government
will be highly prejudiced. Any confusion will be the result of its own presentation of evidence,
the lack of corroborating evidence, and the prejudice inflicted upon Ms. Maxwell.
