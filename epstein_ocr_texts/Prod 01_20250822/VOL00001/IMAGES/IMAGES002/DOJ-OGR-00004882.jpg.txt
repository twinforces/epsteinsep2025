announcing it publicly, D.A. Castor reasonably expected Cosby to act in reliance upon his
charging decision.

We cannot deem it unreasonable to rely upon the advice of one’s attorneys. The
constitutional guarantee of the effective assistance of counsel is premised, in part, upon
the complexities that inhere in our criminal justice system. A criminal defendant confronts
a number of important decisions that may result in severe consequences to that
defendant if, and when, they are made without a full understanding of the intricacies and
nuances of the ever-changing criminal law. As Justice Black explained in Johnson v.
Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458 (1938):

[The right to counsel] embodies a realistic recognition of the obvious truth

that the average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to

protect himself when brought before a tribunal with power to take his life or

liberty, wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned
counsel. That which is simple, orderly, and necessary to the lawyer to the
untrained layman may appear intricate, complex, and mysterious.

Consistently with the wise policy of the Sixth Amendment and other parts of

our fundamental charter, this Court has pointed to the humane policy of

modern criminal law, which now provides that a defendant, if he be poor,

may have counsel furnished [to] him by the state, not infrequently more able

than the attorney for the state.’

The right to be heard would be, in many cases, of little avail if it did not

comprehend the right to be heard by counsel. Even the intelligent and

educated layman has small and sometimes no skill in the science of law. If
charged with crime, he is incapable, generally, of determining for himself
whether the indictment is good or bad. He is unfamiliar with the rules of

evidence. Left without the aid of counsel he may be put on trial without a

proper charge, and convicted upon incompetent evidence, or evidence

irrelevant to the issue or otherwise inadmissible. He lacks both the skill and
knowledge adequately to prepare his defence, even though he [may] have

a perfect one. He requires the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the

proceedings against him.

Id. at 462-63 (cleaned up). Not only was Cosby’s reliance upon the conclusions and
advice of his attorneys reasonable, it was consistent with a core purpose of the right to
counsel.
