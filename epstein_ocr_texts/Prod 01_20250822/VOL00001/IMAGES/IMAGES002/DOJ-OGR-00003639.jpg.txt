or Hispanics or fewer. Thus, the disparity may be because the clerical error led to African
Americans and Hispanics being more likely or less likely to not respond to the mailed
questionnaire because they did not receive the questionnaire due to this issue. I was able to
identify the persons on the master jury wheel whose questionnaire was mailed to the incomplete
alternative mailing address on the voter registration list. None of these persons responded to the
questionnaire, presumably because they never received it due to the clerical error. Assuming
that, absent the clerical error, these persons would have received the questionnaire and made it
onto the qualified jury wheel at the same rate as those in the county who were not subject to the
clerical error, I estimated the number of additional persons who would have made it on to the
qualified jury wheel by race and ethnicity. Overall, 1,681 additional persons would have made it
onto the qualified jury wheel, of which 111 (or 6.60%) would have been African American and
149 (or 8.87%) would have been Hispanic. That is, correcting this clerical error would increase
the number of persons on the qualified jury wheel, but lower the percent of persons on the
qualified jury wheel that were African American and Hispanic. Based on this analysis, I
estimated that if the clerical error had not been made, the percent African American on the
qualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by 0.14 percentage points (from 8.76% up
8.62%) while the percent Hispanic on the qualified jury wheel would have slightly decreased by
0.10 percentage points (from 10.48% down to 10.38%). Obviously, this clerical error is not a
cause of the difference in African American and Hispanic representation between the qualified
jury wheel and the community.

37. The final and dominant cause of the difference between the qualified jury wheel and
the master jury wheel, and hence the difference between the qualified jury wheel and the
community, is the fact that when African Americans and Hispanics on the master jury wheel are
