Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 36 of 239
prosecutions by those two offices, and only those two offices.4 The defendant therefore cannot
argue that the word “global” in this provision means that the NPA binds the entire federal
government.

In sum, the defendant points to nothing in the text of the NPA that could possibly be
construed to bind other districts. To the contrary, there are affirmative indications in the text that
the NPA applies only to the USAO-SDFL. Accordingly, under Annabi, the NPA is only binding
on the USAO-SDFL, and the defendant’s motion fails as a matter of law.

Z. The Defendant Has Offered No Evidence That the NPA Binds Other
Districts

Although a defendant may offer evidence that the negotiations between the prosecutor and
defendant contained a promise to bind other districts, Russo, 801 F.2d at 626, the defendant has
failed to do so here. The defendant’s motion is replete with bare assertions and conclusory
allegations, but it fails to point to any evidence that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY.

The lone document the defendant offers in support of her motion is a privilege log filed by
the USAO-SDFL in connection with a lawsuit filed by Epstein’s victims. (Def. Mot. | at 22). The
log reflects that the FBI agents working with the USAO-SDFL interviewed witnesses in other
states—including New York—during their investigation. That is entirely unremarkable, since
federal investigations frequently involve gathering evidence in other states. This does not in any
way establish the substantive involvement of any other districts in the prior investigation, let alone
that the USAO-SDFL promised Epstein that the U.S. Attorney’s offices in those states would be
bound by the NPA.

* Interpreting the term “federal liability” in this provision could not be read to encompass all U.S.
Attorney’s offices without also interpreting its neighboring term, “state . . . liability,” to refer to
every state prosecutor’s office in all fifty states. The USAO-SDFL clearly did not—and could
not—make such a broad promise.
