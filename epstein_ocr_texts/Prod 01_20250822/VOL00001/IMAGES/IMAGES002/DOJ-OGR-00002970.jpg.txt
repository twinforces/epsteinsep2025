prosccutions by those two offices, and. only, those two offices.1 The: defendant therefore cannot.
argue: that the word “global” in this provision means that, the NPA binds the entire federal
government.

In. sum, the defendant points to nothing in the text of ‘the NPA. 'that:.could possibly be
construed to bind other districts. To. the contrary, there are affirmative. indications in the-text'that’
the NPA applics only to: the USAO-SDFL. Accordingly, under,Annabi, the NPA. is: only: binding:
on the USAO-SDEL, and the defendant's motion-fails, as a mattcr:of law:

2. ‘The Defendant Has. Offered. No Evidence That the NPA Binds Other
Districts

Although a defendant.may offer evidence that the negotiations between the prosccutor and
defendant. contained a ‘promise to bind other districts, Russo, 801 F.2d at 626, the defendant has
failed to do so here. ‘The defendant’s ‘motion, is. replete with bare assertions and. conclusory.
allegations, but it fails to point to any evidence that the NPA binds the USAO-SDNY.

The lone document:the defendant offers in support.of her:motion is a:privilege log filed by:
the USAO-SDFL in connection with,a, lawsuit filed by Epstcin’s victims. (Def. Mot. ] at 22). The:
log reflects that the FBI agents working With the USAO-SDFL interviewed Witiesses in. other
federal investigations frequently involve gathering evidence in other states. This docs not ‘in any’
way ¢stablish the substantive involvement'of any’other districts in the prior investigation, lct'alone
that the USAO-SDFL promised Epstein that.the U.S, Attorney’s offices :in. those states ‘would be:

bound by. the NPA.

* Interpreting the term “federal. liability” in this provision could not be read.to encompass all. U.S.
Attorncy’s offices without. also interpreting its neighboring term, “state .. . liability,” to refer to
every ‘state prosccutor’s office ‘in.all fifty states. The USAOQ-SDFL clearly did not—and_ could.
not—make:such a broad:promise.
