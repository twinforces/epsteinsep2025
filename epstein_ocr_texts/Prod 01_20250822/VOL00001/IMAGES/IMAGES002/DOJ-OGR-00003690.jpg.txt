However, it also concludes that-even if the statute were ambiguous, it would. properly-apply to
these: charges.

At.Lanfgraf’s second. step, the Court asks whether application of the statute to past
conduct; would have impermissible retroactive effects. “[A] statute: has presumptively
impermissible retroactive effects:when it ‘takes away or impairs vested.rights acquired under

‘existing laws, or ercates a new obligation, imposcs a new duty, or attaches a new disability; in.

respect.to transactions or considcrations, alrcady‘past.”” Weingarten, 865 F.3d.at-56 (quoting
Landgraf, 51:1 U.S. at 290). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously: time-
barred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. /nter. Mortg: Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec.

Maxwell concedes that these offenses, were within the statute of limitations when
Congress cnacted:the. PROTECT Act. Thus, ‘the, Act did not:deprive, her of any vested rights.
occurred more than twenty years ago, but there ‘is no dispute that: Congress has the ‘power to sct:a
lengthy. limitations period or. no limitations period at all. It has donc so here, judging that.the:
difficulty of prosecuting these offenses and, the harm they work on children outweighs a,
defendant’s interest in ‘repose. Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy
judgment, not.an impermissibly retroactive application ofithe statute: The Court concludes that
§ 3283 allows her prosecution now.

B. The Government’s delay in. bringing charges did not:violate due process

“Ns the Supreme Court stated in, United States v. Marion, the statute of limitations is ‘the

primary’ guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges.”” United States, v: Cornielle,.
