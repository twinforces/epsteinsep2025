shoes ‘of the hovght process. in, 2006 ‘and “07 “when 1 trafficking
prosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than. today; some
Jurors may hav looked at this as prostitution, and |. . ta] judge's
tolerance ‘for victim shaming may have . . . caused:more hesitation
onthe part of victims. .....°°

Finally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution.offered more flexibilityin fashioning
a, Sentence, because..he beli¢ved prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district
court in the Southern District of Florida ‘to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence
that differed. from the otherwise applicable ‘federal sentencing guidclines range. 4

In. summarizing his, thinking at the time, Acosta'‘told OPR,

The way the matter came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing
cnough. It didn’t provide for prison, time. It. didn’t provide for
registration, and then-you-had the‘restitution.issuc. There were legal.
issues .... There were witness, issucs. And... we-could go to trial

aiid’ We may or may‘not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at
a a pre- -indictment resolution, and at various points, the office. went
back and forth, between, a. federal ‘pre-indictment resolution, and a

state’ pre- -Indictment resolution,

Acosta 'told OPR that, in, the end, “there was, a preference, for deferring to the state” because, in.
part, the facts of the Epstein. case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution.
rather than trafficking,. and a fedcral, prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta, explained.
that he did, not, view it as problematic to defer resolution of the casc to the state, although ‘as the
Epstcin.case ‘played out, the fedcral role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because
the defense tried to get'the state to “circumvent and-undérmine” the outcome.

Attorney's Office: could have proceeded ‘against. Epstein: by w fay of-ar information, but:decided to go into the ‘grand.
jury. because the’ State Attorney's Office * ‘didn’t like the case” and wanted * ‘Political cover” for declining the ‘case or
proceeding on.a lesser charge.

83 Menchel told. OPR. however, that the federal jiidges ‘i: West Palm, Beach were ‘highly regardeéd. and, were
gehicrally viewed.as “pro-prosecution.”

o Acosta said that; “dismissing a: number of: counts and ‘then: doing. a [RJule I, is not something ‘that: [South
Florida.tederal district] judgestend to, do* Othersubjects also;told OPR that the federal judges inthe Southern: District
of Elorida-were generally. considered averse to pleas: that’bound them on: sentencings, commonly-referred: to. as “Rule

were: “uncommon” “in, the; Southern, District of Florida; as the; ‘ “judges do not like; to be told... . what sentence to
