Discussion
Where, as here, a grand jury subpoena has validly issued, and the recipient of the subpoena
is not contesting compliance—but rather seeking authorization to comply with the subpoena—a
court should grant such permission through limited modification of an applicable protective order,
absent countervailing interests not present in this case. As described below, a court can and should
modify a protective order, or permit limited relief from it, to allow the recipient of a grand jury
subpoena to comply with such a subpoena under the circumstances presented here.
The Court is best guided by the decision in Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., 154
F.R.D. 91 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), which rejected an application for a party in civil litigation to be held
in contempt for complying with a grand jury subpoena despite the existence of a protective order,
without first obtaining authorization from the court, because the court would have granted such
authorization had it been sought. Chemical Bank, 154 F.R.D. at 93. As that court explained:
The role of the federal courts in law enforcement, exemplified by
the Federal Criminal Code (Title 18, USC) and in enforcing Grand
Jury subpoenas argues in favor of making significant information
available to enforcement authorities absent a countervailing
showing that the need for the information for such purposes is
outweighed by the need for protecting expectations of
confidentiality under Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c).
Id. at 94 (citing United States v. Davis, 702 F.2d 418, 421-22 (2d Cir. 1983) (finding that the
“conflict between protection of private material used in a civil proceeding and public need in a
criminal prosecution” posed in that case was “easily resolved” and explaining that “[a]bsent
applicable grounds for exception, such as a previously asserted Fifth Amendment privilege, no
shiled protects the civil evidence” in that case “from compellable production before the grand jury
which subpoenaed it”). The court in Chemical Bank chastised the relevant party for responding to
the grand jury subpoena without authorization specifically because such disregard was “entirely
unnecessary and inappropriate” due to the readily available remedy of a modification of the
applicable protective order. Chemical Bank, 154 F.R.D. at 93. The court also explicitly noted that
such formal judicial approval could be obtained ex parte if sufficient reason for doing so was
shown. Id.
Chemical Bank further described the types of interests that otherwise might be implicated
in connection with a Rule 26(c) protective order, none of which are implicated here. Jd. at 94
(“There is no indication that any difficult balancing under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) would have been
necessary of interests of law enforcement against protection of technological trade secrets,
currently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which
could benefit rivals, since no such information has been claimed to have been contained in any of
the discovery materials in this case.”) (citations omitted).!
' Notably, here, and in contrast to other cases further described below, the Government’s specific
knowledge of the subject matter of discovery materials is relatively limited, due to the confidential
nature of the Litigation; however, the Protective Order itself indicates that discovery materials
