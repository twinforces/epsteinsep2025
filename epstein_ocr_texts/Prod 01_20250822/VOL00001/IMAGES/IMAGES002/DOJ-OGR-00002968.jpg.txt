not. parties to the agreement. This position is at odds with the law in this Circuit, which presumes
a fiarrow reading of the boundaries of a plea agreement unless. a defendant can affirmatively
establish. that a more ‘expansive: interpretation. was. contemplated.”) (citing Annabi, 771. F.2d. at.
672). To hold otherwise would.turn Annabi on, its head.
The defendant next argues that the following ‘provision, of the NPA cVinces an intent. to

bind the entire federal, government:

In. consideration of Epstcin’s agrecment to plead guilty and to

‘provide ‘compensation. in the manner described above, if’ Epstein

successfully fulfills all of the terms and. conditions of. this
agreement, the United States also agrecs that.it will:not institute-any:

criminal charges against.any ‘potential co-conspirators of Epstein,

including but. ‘not limited, to Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, Lesley

Groff, or Nadia Marcinkova.

above, is. insufficient, the defendant docs not; point; to any language ‘in, this provision ‘that:
purportedly binds.other districts. ‘Instead, she argues, that the absence of language specifically’
limiting this provision, to the USAO-SDFL. demonstrates an intent to bind the entire federal
government. This,argument:fails, for at.least three reasons. First, the defendant’s argument inverts
the holding of Annabi: inthis Circuit, the presumption:is that plea agreements bind only-the district
in which, they. are entered, absent. affirmative indications otherwise. Put differently, the absence’
of express. limiting language in this provision is not. an. affirmative indication. of ‘a broader
application. Accordingly, under Second. Circuit law, the absence of limiting language: in this
specific provision provides no ‘support; forthe defendant’s motion.

Second, ‘the defendant’s. argument acknowledges that the ‘plain. terms of the NPA.

immunized ‘Epstein, from. prosecution in “this District,” that: is, the Southern, District: of Florida.
