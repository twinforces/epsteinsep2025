The goverriment. says that this Court.need. not resolve Ms. Maxwell's motions to

suppress or hold an ‘evidentiary hearing before the trial.on.the:non-perjury counts because it

“does not; intend to use these materials”—i.c., any of the materials subject:to the suppression
motions—‘in its-case-in-chicf at the trial of the non-perjury counts in.this ease.” (Dkt. No.
227, p 1). Atthe same time, the government purports to “rescrve[] its right to. use:relevant
materials, from this sct. for:any purpose permissible underthe Rules of Evidence.” Jd. at.2. The
government’s representation is not,good enough, and its reservation-of rights is misplaced.

It'is not. cnough for the government to:represent that it “docs not intend. to use [the
suppression] materials in its. casé-in-chief at’the trial. of the tion-perjury counts in this case.”
Id. at... That’s because: Ms. Maxwell’s motions to suppress.allege violations of the duc
process clause, the ‘Fourth. Amendment, the Fifth,Amendment, and the Second, Circuit’s:
decision. in Martindell *. International Lel. & Tel. Corp.,, 594 F.2d 291 (24.C if. 1979). If this.
Court agrees with Ms. Maxwell’s arguments, not-only will it.suppress all 90,000-some pages
of material the government improperly obtained through ‘its ev. parfe-subpocnha, it will also
suppress.all evidence derived therefrom. See Wong Sun v. Wnited States, 371 U.S.471, 488
(1963); United States v; Bailey, 743 F:3d 322, 341-42 (2d Cir, 2014).

The goverfiment‘thus Cannot avoid:inquiry into its Conduct simply by:pledging not, to,
usc the material itsclf.in its casc-in-chief. If.Ms. Maxwell:is right—and an evidentiary hearing
will, show that ‘she is—the government also cannot use, any. cvidenee it obtained, “by
exploitation of the illegality.” See Wong Sun, 371 U.S. at 488.

What’s more, “the’burden, of proof on [an] attenuation claim, is on the government.”
United: States Vv. Ghailani, 743 F. Supp. 2d 242,'259:(S.D.N.Y.. 2010) (ordering an, evidentiary:

hearing'to put the government to its burden of proving attenuation) (citing United States v:
