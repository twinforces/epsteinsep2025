Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 232 of 239

In sum, the decision to indict the defendant in White Plains was entirely proper, and the
lack of any constitutional or statutory basis for the defendant’s contrary argument is fatal to her
fair cross-section claims, as described below.

De The Defendant’s Fair Cross-Section Claim Is Meritless

The defendant’s fair cross-section claim is based on the assertion that Black or African-
American and Hispanic or Latino individuals are unfairly underrepresented in the relevant jury
pool. (Def. Mot. 9 at 5). While these are “distinctive” groups, satisfying Duren’s first prong, the
defendant’s claim fails on each of the other two prongs.

a. The Defendant Has Not Established that Blacks or Hispanics
Are Unfairly Represented

The second prong of the Duren test requires the Court to determine whether representation
of either or both of the “distinctive” groups in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and
reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community. Duren, 439 U.S. at 364.
This requires determining the relevant comparators—i.e., what is the “relevant jury pool” and what
is the community “population” against which it is compared—as well as the appropriate method
of statistical comparison. See Rioux, 97 F.3d at 656.

Here, the defendant contends that the relevant jury pool is the White Plains Qualified
Wheel. (Def. Mot. 9 at 5-6). The Government believes that the relevant jury pool is the White
Plains Master Wheel, but, as set forth below, the defendant’s claim fails even using the White
Plains Qualified Wheel.

“Neither the Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit has defined the ‘relevant jury pool’
with any specificity.” United States v. Rioux 930 F. Supp. 1558, 1565 (D. Conn. 1995). Ina
detailed survey of the case law, the district court in Rioux found that cases have examined different
relevant pools, including the master wheel, the qualified wheel over a period of time, the venires
