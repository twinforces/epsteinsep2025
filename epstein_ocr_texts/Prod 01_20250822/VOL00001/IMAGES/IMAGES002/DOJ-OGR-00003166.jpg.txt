Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document204 Filed 04/16/21 Page 232 of 239

In ‘sum, the decision to ‘indict the defendant in White Plains was entircly proper, and the
lack of any constitutional or' statutory basis for the defendant’s contrary argument is fatal to her
fair cross-scction.claims, as described below.

2. The Defendant’s Fair Cross-Section, Claim'Is Meritless

The defendant’s fair cross-section claim. is. based on the. assertion ‘that Black or Aftican-
American, and. Hispanic or Latino: individuals are unfairly underrepresented in the relevant jury’
pool. (Def. Mot.9.at 5). ‘While these are “distinctive” groups, satisfying Durén’s first:prong, the

Here, the defendant: contends that the relevant jury pool is the White ‘Plains Qualified.
Wheel. (Def: Mot. 9 at 5=6). The Government. believes, that the relevant; jury pool. is, the White
Plains Master Whecl, ‘but, as set forth, below, the defendant’s, claim. fails even, using the White
Plains Qualificd Wheel.

“Neither the Supreme Court: nor the Second Circuit; has defined the ‘relevant jury: pool’
with any: specificity.” United States v. Rioux 930 F. Supp. 1558, 1565 (D. Conn. 1995). In.a
detailed‘survey of the case law, the district,court in Riowy found that-cases have examined different,
