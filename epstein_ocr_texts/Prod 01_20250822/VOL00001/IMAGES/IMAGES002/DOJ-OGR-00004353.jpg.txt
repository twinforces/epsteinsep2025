thing to do is, charge Epstcin by complaint, ‘assuming ‘we decide to charge him... . The
[sentencing] guidelines will be.in the 20 year-range, so we would.nced to plead-him. to one. or two
conspiracics to’ cap him.and ‘there.:is no telling if'a judge would go for: that ‘once. we indict."
‘Menchel, responded that. he and Acosta. would read the ‘prosecution; memorandum. and “[w]e ‘can,

complaint, arrest him, detain him . . . and then try to sce if he wants
a pré-indictment résolution. That would give us moré control [over]
a plea than if we indict‘him and nced.the court’s approval.to dismiss
counts. We will need to.cap him ‘with ‘conspiracy counts to:make:a
plea.attractive and 'the:court could give us a hard time with, that if we
