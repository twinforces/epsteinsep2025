Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr.:330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

Even. though I do not currently represent Ms. Maxwell.in. any proceedings and
have never entered an appearance in connection with her trial before Your Honor, the
Government submitted.a.letter “to bring to the Court’ s attention” an article that I wrote
on June, 30, 2021, and asked that the Court “issue an order pursuant, to Local Rule
23.1(h)” directed. at me. (Dkt.. No. 309). This Court ‘ordered that. I-respond (Dkt. No.
312), and Ido so here. I respectfully request that the Court deny the Government’s
request for the following reasons:

I. The local, rules do not apply as I do not currently represent Ghislaine
Maxwell in any ‘proceeding and have not entered an appearance in
this Court.

court and has 1 never’ v entered an  appeara ance as s her © lawyer j in 1 this Court, the local rules
do not, apply. See, e.g., Local Rule 23.1(h) (explaining that the Court. “may issue a
special order governing stich. 'matters as extrajudicial. statements by parties and
witnesses likely to inter fere with. the rights of the accused to a faite tr ral bya an vimpar tial

witness, the Government's request should be denied.

Undersigned counsel was previously retained to represent Ms. Maxwell’s family.
Then, when this Court deried her third bail application, 'undérsignéd coursél was
retained to represent Ms. Maxwell in the Second Circuit, on her bail appeal (and. not
regarding the merits of the case). That proceeding is concluded, and undersigned
counsel no longer ‘represents Ms. Maxwell in any capacity.
