death.'” As such, itis neither surprising nor terribly probative of any issue in dispute in. this case
that Detective Recarcy might have testified to.a lack of knowledge:as to what. the'victims identified,
in. this Indictment have:'told the USAO-SDNY. In sum, the defendant -has :not put: “specific:

to “demonstrate that [defendants] cannot receive, a. fair trial” or “justify the dismissal of ‘the:
indictment.” Marion, 404'U:S. at 326; Elshery, 602 F.2d at 1.059. Indeed, the‘fact that the defense

described the witnesses’ as “pofential witnesses” suggests that. she might still call them. Further,
