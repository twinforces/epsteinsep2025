Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document224 Filed 04/20/21 Page15of17
one or more of Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers should become actual witnesses, a circumstance that
would create a circus, not a fair trial.

The truth of the matter is simple: the government included the Perjury Counts because it
wants to call Ms. Maxwell a liar in front of the jury and because it wanted a way to introduce
unrelated, but extremely prejudicial evidence of alleged sexual abuse through the back door. The
simple, non-prejudicial, solution is to sever the Perjury Counts.’

CONCLUSION

The Perjury Counts are improperly joined with the Mann Act Counts. A joint trial of
these charges would deny Ms. Maxwell her right to a fair trial and her counsel. Accordingly, the
Court should grant the request for a separate trial on the Perjury Counts.

Respectfully submitted,

7 Ms. Maxwell’s Colorado Counsel would not participate as advocates in any trial of those

charges but would testify as witnesses.
