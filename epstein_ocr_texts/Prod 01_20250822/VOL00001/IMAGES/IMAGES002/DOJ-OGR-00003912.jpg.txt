Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 224 _ Filed 04/20/21 Page 15 of 17

‘one.or more of Ms., Maxwell’s lawyers should. become actual, witnesses,.a circumstance. that
would create a Circiis, not a fair trial.

The truth of the:matter is simple: ‘the governnicnt included tlic Perjury Counts because it
wants to call Ms. 'Maxwell:a liar in front of the jury and because it wanted a-way to introduce
unrelated, but extremely prejudicial evidence of- alleged sextial. abuse through the back door. The
simple; non-prejudicial, solution is to sever the Perjury Counts.’

CONCLUSION

The Perjury Counts .are improperly joined with the Mann Act Counts: .A. joint trial of
thesé charges would.deny Ms. Maxwell her right to 4 fair trialand her coutisél. Accordingly, the
Court should. grant; the request‘for a scparate'trial on the Perjury Counts.

Dated: March 15,2021

Respectfully submitted,

s/ Jeffrey S. Paglitica

Ms. Maxwell’s Colorado Counsel would not participate a8 advocates in.any.trial of those
charges but would testify.as. witnesses.
