Accordingly, we respectfully request that the Court issue an order directing the MDC to
accept the master hard drives either from defense counsel or from the government. We will send a
copy of this letter to the MDC Legal Department so that they can note any objections they may
have.
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
Sincerely,
