Epstein’s wish.to have the Department review the case.!°*

On November .28, 2007, Starr:requested, by letter, a:mecting with.Fisher. In his letter, Star
argued that the USAO improperly had compelled Epstein to agree to pay civil damages under
18 U.S.C. § 2255 as part of a state-based resolution/of.a criminal case. On,the:same day, Lefkowitz
emailed:Sloman, complaining about-the USAO’s plan, to:notify victims about the § 2255 provision,
and_alerting Sloman that. Epstein’s counsel ‘were secking a meeting with the Assistant Attorney’

evolved. Villafana responded. that shen was ‘ ‘going through all of the: ways i ‘in: nwhich +h they have tried,

because ofits serial nature; atid observed that the NPA’ was “prettyadvantagcous for the:defendant.
and. not.all that.helpful to the victims.” He opined, however, that the Assistant Attorney General

During her OPR, interview, Fisher did not recall reading: Starr’s Ictter ‘or discussing jit. with,
Oosterbaan, but belicved the comment; about: her “ ‘agrec[ing] with, it” referred to a federal
prosccution of Epstein, ‘which she believed was appropriate. She told OPR, however, that she
“played no rolé:in” the NPA and. did not réview or approve thé agreement cither before or after:it.

provided a draft ofthe. notification. letter to Lefkowitz for comments. On Noveniber 29, 2007,
Lefkowitz sent Acosta a letter ‘complaining about the draft. notification tothe victims. Lefkowitz
asked the USAO'to refrain from notifying | x the victimsuntil after defense counsel. met with Assistant:
Attorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would take place the following week. ‘Internal
emails ‘indicate that Lourie contacted, Oosterbaan about’ his availability for a mecting with Starr,
but. both Fisher and Lourie: told. OPR that such a ‘meeting never took place, and OPR: found no
evidence that it did.
