Ghislaine Maxwell submits this reply in, support of her Motion to suppress all evidence
the government obtained from a grand jury subpoena it issuied to Boics Schiller Flexner LLP and.
to.dismiss Counts Five and. Six, which are the fruits of that'unlawful subpoena.

Introduction and Summary of the Argument

If the, government ‘meant to ‘reassure this Court that nothing' improper happened, its
Response was anythirig but reassuring.

The government:now confesses that it-had significant and substantial contact. with
Virginia, Giuffre’s attorneys in 2016=while the Giuffre defamation suit against Maxwell was
on-going—as part of'an-cffort.to instigate a criminal:prosccution of Maxwell. for allegedly
trafficking Giuftre and others and then‘lying under oath. Doubling down on an:increasingly
farfetched story, however, the government insists that nothing, improper occurred’ when. it
misrepresented these contacts to the: Chicf Judge of the Southern District of New York,

Contrary to the government’s portrayal of events, what happened.here'is '‘that.a prosecutor
affirmatively: misled. Chief Judge: M¢Mahon to'circumvent a Protective Order entered by: one of
her colleagues. The ‘prosecutor’then exploited the, material, he obtained to indict Maxwell.

Had the prosecutor. not affirmatively misled Judge McMahon, the government would
never have obtained the 90,000 pages of-material. it, now possesses, material that is eentral—
indced, essential—to ‘its, case against Maxwell. It Would be the height of irony, not to mention
injustice, ‘to allow the: government to convict Maxwell of testifying falsely when.the: government
could not have indicted Maxwell but: forthe false statements it made to a federal, judge.

“Tn.a situation like this, the judiciary _... May exercise its supetvisory power. to ‘make it

‘clear that the misconduct was serious, that the government’s unwillingness to ‘own, up to it was

more serious still, and that steps must’ bé takén to avoid a recurrence of this, chain. of events.”
