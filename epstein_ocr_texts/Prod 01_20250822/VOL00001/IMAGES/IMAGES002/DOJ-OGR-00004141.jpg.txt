Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 285 _ Filed 05/20/21 Page6 of 34

Ghislaine Maxwell submits this reply in support of her Motion to suppress all evidence
the government obtained from a grand jury subpoena it issued to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP and
to dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are the fruits of that unlawful subpoena.

Introduction and Summary of the Argument

If the government meant to reassure this Court that nothing improper happened, its
Response was anything but reassuring.

The government now confesses that it had significant and substantial contact with
Virginia Giuffre’s attorneys in 2016—while the Giuffre defamation suit against Maxwell was
on-going—as part of an effort to instigate a criminal prosecution of Maxwell for allegedly
trafficking Giuffre and others and then lying under oath. Doubling down on an increasingly
farfetched story, however, the government insists that nothing improper occurred when it
misrepresented these contacts to the Chief Judge of the Southern District of New York.

Contrary to the government’s portrayal of events, what happened here is that a prosecutor
from the public corruption unit of the United States Attorney’s Office, in an ex parte proceeding,
affirmatively misled Chief Judge McMahon to circumvent a Protective Order entered by one of
her colleagues. The prosecutor then exploited the material he obtained to indict Maxwell.

Had the prosecutor not affirmatively misled Judge McMahon, the government would
never have obtained the 90,000 pages of material it now possesses, material that is central—
indeed, essential—to its case against Maxwell. It would be the height of irony, not to mention
injustice, to allow the government to convict Maxwell of testifying falsely when the government
could not have indicted Maxwell but for the false statements it made to a federal judge.

“Tn a situation like this, the judiciary . . . may exercise its supervisory power to make it
clear that the misconduct was serious, that the government’s unwillingness to own up to it was
more serious still, and that steps must be taken to avoid a recurrence of this chain of events.”
