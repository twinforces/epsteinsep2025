Alternatively, the Government could have moved ex parte for permissive intervention in |

the Giuffre Action, and then sought modification of the Protective Order. Permissive |
intervention is the appropriate procedural device when any non-party seeks to modify a |
protective order. AT&T Corp. v. Sprint Corp., 407 F.3d 560, 562 (2d Cir. 2005) (“We have |
stated that permissive intervention is the proper method for a nonparty to seek a modification of |
a protective order.”); H.L. Hayden Co. of New York v. Siemens Med. Sys., Inc., 797 F.2d 85, 90 |
(2d Cir. 1986) (“[W]e continue to adhere to our holding in Martindell |v. International Tel. and |
Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 291, 294 (2d Cir. 1979)], that ‘this extraordinary writ [mandamus] would |
hardly be available ... where the only purpose was to obtain modification of a pretrial order for |
investigative purposes.’”), Or it could have filed a writ of mandamus, since “mandamus lies to |
compel a judge to unseal documents shown to be material and necessary in litigation,” United |
States v. Davis, 702 F.2d 418, 423 (2d Cir. 1983). But the Government has done neither of the |
above; instead, it has moved pursuant to the All Writs Act. It cites no authority for that |
procedure. |
Nonetheless, there is precedent in this Circuit for granting procedurally puzzling :
applications by the Government to unseal materials for use by a grand jury. For example, in
Davis, 702 F.2d 418, the Government, which was not a party to the underlying civil litigation, |
successfully “moved the Bankruptcy Court for an order permitting it access to the materials |
under seal,” including transcripts of examinations taken under Rule 205 and exhibits marked at |
those examinations. Jd. at 420-21. On appeal, the Second Circuit rejected the defendant- |
appellants’ argument that the bankruptcy court had abused its discretion in granting the |
Government’s application: “A court may direct access to such material upon a proper showing of
