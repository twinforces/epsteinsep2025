attached to the perpetrators, such that they try to protect the perpetrators.

Sexual abuse also impacts the way memory is encoded. In traumatic circumstances, often
only the most salient details are encoded, and over time, specific details may be lost. With

cause people to narrow their focus to the most salient and relevant details. If someone is abused
multiple times or by multiple people, it is very common for memories of similar occurrences to
