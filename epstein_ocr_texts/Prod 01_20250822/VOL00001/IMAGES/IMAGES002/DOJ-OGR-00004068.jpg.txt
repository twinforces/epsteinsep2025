Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 261 Filed 05/03/21 Page4of9 4
L4N3MAXC Arraignment

1 superseding indictment in this case?

2 THE DEFENDANT: Yes, your Honor.

3 THE COURT: Have you had time to review it with your
4 attorney?

S THE DEFENDANT: I have, your Honor.

6 THE COURT: You have a right to have the indictment
7 read to you here in open court or you can waive the public

8 reading. Do you waive the public reading?

9 THE DEFENDANT: I waive the public reading.

10 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim, how does your client wish
11 to plead?

12 MS. STERNHEIM: She enters a plea of not guilty.

13 THE COURT: Thank you.

14 With that I note that we do have a number of

15 scheduling issues pending. I have received the parties'

16 briefing on the defense's request for a continuance of the

17 trial date until either the fall or winter. I'm considering
18 that request and gathering information. I will provide

19 resolution as soon as I can, and I believe it is important to
20 do so quickly.
21 As I've stated, however, unless and until you hear
22 further from me, you must assume that I will request a jury
23 selection date as close to the planned July 12 date as
24 possible.
25 I have also received the parties' proposed schedules
