Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 2 of 14

As the Court is aware, more than six years ago, Jane Doe #1 filed the present action
against the Government, alleging a violation of her rights under the CVRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3771.
DE1. She alleged that Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused her and that the United States had
entered into a secret non-prosecution agreement (NPA) regarding those crimes in violation of her
rights. At the first court hearing on the case, the Court allowed Jane Doe #2 to also join the
action. Both Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 specifically argued that the government had failed to
protect their CVRA rights (inter alia) to confer, to reasonable notice, and to be treated with
fairness. In response, the Government argued that the CVRA rights did not apply to Jane Doe #1
and Jane Doe #2 because no federal charges had ever been filed against Jeffrey Epstein.

The Court has firmly rejected the United States’ position. In a detailed ruling, the Court
concluded that the CVRA extended rights to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 even though federal
charges were never filed. DE 189, The Court explained that because the NPA barred
prosecution of crimes committed against them by Epstein, they had “standing” to assert
violations of the CVRA rights. Jd. The Court deferred ruling on whether the two victims would
be entitled to relief, pending development of a fuller evidentiary record. Jd.

Two other victims, who are in many respects similarly situated to the current victims,
now wish to join this action. The new victims joining at this stage will not cause any delay and
their joinder in this case is the most expeditious manner in which to pursue their rights. Because
the background regarding their abuse is relevant to the Court’s assessment of whether to allow
them to join, their circumstances are recounted here briefly.
