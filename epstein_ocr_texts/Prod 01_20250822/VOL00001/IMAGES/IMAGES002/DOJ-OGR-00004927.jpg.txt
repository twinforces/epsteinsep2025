pursuant to the parties’ stipulation. Judge Sweet made no specific findings about any provision
of that order. Ud. 9:25—10:6.)

On March 18, 2016, the court formally entered the Protective Order. (15-cv-7433, Dkt. )
No. 62.) It provided, as such orders generally do, that any documents, materials and/or |
information designated confidential by the parties (the “Confidential Materials”) would be |
subject to the protections of, and could be disclosed to non-parties only in accordance with the |
terms of, the Protective Order. (Id. §§ 1-5.) The Protective Order also required all parties, at the |
conclusion of the case, either to return to the party who made the confidentiality designation, or |
(in the alternative) to destroy, each document and all copies of Confidential Materials in their |
possession. (Ic. 5-7, 12.) This destruction obligation extended to the parties’ lawyers as well |
as to the parties themselves. Ud. § 12.) |
The Protective Order specified that if Confidential Materials were contained in any |
document presented to the court, the filing “shall be accompanied by a Motion to Seal pursuant |
to Section 6.2 of the Electronic Case Filing Rules & Instructions for the Southern District of |
New York.” (/d. $10.) The docket sheet in Giuffre v. Maxwell reveals that such motions were |
frequently made and routinely granted. As a result, a vast amount of the Giuffre Action was |
conducted, in effect, in secret—despite the fact that there was immense public interest in the |
matter. | |
The Giuffre Action was settled and dismissed with prejudice pursuant to a joint |
stipulation for dismissal on May 25, 2017, which was shortly before the trial was to begin. (15- .
ev-7433, Dkt. No. 919.) The terms of the settlement remain confidential. (15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |
953 at 10.) |
