with Ms. Giuffre’s lawyers to, obtain information subject.to strict protective ordérs in the civil
cases. To carry.out this plan, the: government sought.cxv parte subpoenas. from-two judicial
offieers—Chicf Judge McMahon. and Magistrate: Judge’ Netburn—for Boies Schiller Flexner’s
files, in the civil cases.

Magistrate Judge Netburn-rejected the scheme.

Judge McMahon proceeded with, caution, concerned.about possible collusion between
the government and.the civil attorneys. She haled.an Assisted United States: Attorney:into
court,and asked him.a,simple and.direct question: What-contacts had there been between. the
government and the plaintiffs’ lawyers? The honest. answer to the question would have
‘disclosed at Icast one lengthy mecting, and numerous followup communications between. the:
government and the lawyers, a disclosure that would-have led Judge MeMahon to deny the ex
parte subpoena request. But the government did not give an-honest answer. The government
instead. denied any contacts or communication, between the U.S, Attorney’s Office and the
plaintiffs’ lawyers. Reassured by the misrepresentation that there was ‘no coordination.
between-the government:and. counsel, Judge McMahon authorized the ex parte subpoena,
which resulted:in the illegal circumvention of a valid protective order.. Ms. Maxwell’s due
‘process ‘motion to:suppress and the reply in support thercof sct forth the relevant: factual
background. An evidentiary hearing on the motion will.shed. even further light, given-the
ineredible nature, of the government’s denials.

Indeed, in:tesponse to.Ms. Maxwell’s motions 'to exclude evidence, obtained in
violation of the protective order, the government,made:minimal inquiries about the scope of
its, misrepresentations to Judge McMahon. The government. endeavored to minimize the

damage, not find outthe truth. Professed lack:of memory-was not.probed,, global email.
