Judge McMahon proceeded with caution, concerned about possible collusion between
the government and the civil attorneys. She haled an Assisted United States Attorney into

disclosed at least one lengthy meeting and numerous follow up communications between the
government and the lawyers, a disclosure that would have led Judge McMahon to deny the ex
parte subpoena request. But the government did not give an honest answer. The government
instead denied any contacts or communication between the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the
plaintiffs’ lawyers. Reassured by the misrepresentation that there was no coordination
between the government and counsel, Judge McMahon authorized the ex parte subpoena,
which resulted in the illegal circumvention of a valid protective order. Ms. Maxwell’s due
process motion to suppress and the reply in support thereof set forth the relevant factual

incredible nature of the government’s denials.

its misrepresentations to Judge McMahon. The government endeavored to minimize the
damage, not find out the truth. Professed lack of memory was not probed, global email
