plaintiffs’ lawyers. Reassured by the misrepresentation that there was no coordination
between the government and counsel, Judge McMahon authorized the ex parte subpoena,
which resulted in the illegal circumvention of a valid protective order. Ms. Maxwell’s due
process motion to suppress and the reply in support thereof set forth the relevant factual

damage, not find out the truth. Professed lack of memory was not probed, global email
