Re: | Response to Government Letter dated August 18, 2021, Dkt. 320, United States v.
Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,
I write in response to the government’s letter dated August 18, 2021, Dkt. 320, which
raises two issues.!
Identities of Co-Conspirators
The government first attempts to walk back its multiple concessions regarding disclosure
of the identities of the unnamed co-conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment.
As this Court noted, Ms. Maxwell has on at least two occasions requested such
disclosure. Dkt. 317 at 12 n.1 (citing Dkt. 291 and Dkt. 293). Only after this Court ordered
disclosure of the identities of the unnamed co-conspirators alleged in the S2 indictment did the
government finally object. The government’s objection comes too late.
' As directed by the Court, on August 24 the parties conferred about the government’s
letter, but they were unable to reach an agreement on the government’s requests for
reconsideration.
