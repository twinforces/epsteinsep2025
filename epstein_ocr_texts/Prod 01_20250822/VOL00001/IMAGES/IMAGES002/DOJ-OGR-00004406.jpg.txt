details from a press report.about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty: to
child sex abuse: charges and ‘was'sentenecd to a term of probation. She: noted ‘that: she ‘ ‘spoke. to
[M]att, [Menchel]” and asked Louric to call.her. Two hours latershe sent Louric'a second, lengthy
email, ‘strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against.
‘registration [as a sexual. offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been
a.“miscommunication” during the September 12,,2007:mceeting, and that “we. only agreed to the
solicitation. with. minors because: we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was
NOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime ‘sexual, offender registration, was a, “life
sentence” that was; “unealled for,” “docs not make sense,” and, was. “inappropriate” ‘to’ impose
“simply: [because] ‘the FBI wants it in rewurn for all there ie efforts. ” _ She: listed, numerous
sexual. offenses; the lack: of. any danger of vovidivism: the casc with which he could be “tracked”
without registering; and that.it'would be “virtually impossible to: comply” with, four separate state
registration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone number‘to Lourie
“in case youwant to speak:to him directly.”

In another email sent less than. two hours later, Sanchez told Louticishe was writing, again.
result: of a + misunderstanding ata meeting.” “She stated that. Epstein’s S. -attomeys ‘had * ‘consistently
emphasized their goal of 18 months in.a. federal. camp” and. “[c]veryone knew: that a registcrable
offense precluded” a camp. designation. Sanchez added,“Therefore it would have been Wholly’
inconsistent with. that primary goal of [Epstcin’s] safety to lightly: concede to registration at that
mecting.” Sanchez concluded, “[[]mposing a life sentence on. him is not something anyone will
eventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get,a fair result.”

Lourié responded to none of the Sanchez: emails, but heedid reach out to Acosta for a-:phone
conversation. By email late:that night, at 10:26 p.m.,, Lefkowitz asked. Louric to phone him.

The next. day, Lefkowitz emailed. Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and. Villafatia—
to “follow up on our:conversation Friday,” asking Acosta. again to reconsider the requirement. that:
Epstein-plead, to, a registrable offense. Lefkowitz wrote that.there had been.a “misunderstanding”
at the September 12, 2007 mecting:

Before the meeting, Mr. Krischer and Ms. Belohlavek, a sex
‘prosccutor for 13 years, told‘us that solicitation,of a:minor . . . 1s not
aregisterable offense. However, asit.turned out, [it] is.a'régisterable
offense: and our discussion at.the meeting was based‘on a mistaken
assumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein. enter two pleas—one to
the Indictment.and a sccond to a non-registcrable charge.
