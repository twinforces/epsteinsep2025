G. Villafaia and Lourie Recommend Ending Negotiations, but Acosta Urges
That They “Try to Work It Out”

In. ‘the late afternoon of Wednesday;, September 19, 2007, Villafahia expressed her
inercasing ‘frustration to her supervisors. She ‘emailed the defense redline version. of the: ‘plea.
agrecment:to Lourie and the incoming West.Palm, Beach:managcr, identifying all-of the provisions
she had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into
the agreement.” (Emphasis ‘in original): Villafafia opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”
Lourie :responded.that he would “reach outto Alex’ to discuss.”

Louric immediately emailed Acosta the following:

I looked atthe latest draft from Jay [Lefkowitz] and I:must agree
with. Maric. Based on:my:-own. conversations with. him, his: draft:is
out of left ficld. He claims to. orally agree to our terms.and ‘then
sends ‘us a document that is the opposite. I suggest we simply. tell
him that: his counter offer ‘is rejected and. that we; intend to move
forward with our case.

Acosta replied:

Why’ don’t we just:call him. Tell him.

L. You agree, and then change things.

2. That's not acecptable, and is in, bad, faith. Stop it or we'll
indict.

3. Try to work it out.

It seems that. we are! close, and ‘it[’]s worth trying to overcome what
has'to be painfully’. . . annoying negotiating tactics.

[t]his negotiation was a‘pain, but ifit was the ‘right position, the fact
that you've. got. annoying. counsel on,the. other side doesn’t. it make
it less of .a right. position. You. tell them stop being annoying, you
try to’work it out, and if not, then;you. indict.

In. response to.Acosta’s instruction, Lourie responded, “Ok will do.” He.also, forwarded to
Acosta ‘the. latest version, of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea. agreement that ‘Villafafia had. sent' to

Lefkowitz the previous day, which Louric: had: requested and obtained. from Villafafia. carlicr that.
aftcrnoon.

Meanwhile, Villafafia sent to Lourie and his successor West Palm Beach manager‘a draft.
message she proposed to send to Lefkowitz with her objections to the ‘defense révisioris,

explaining, “I know that -you keep saying’ he: is :going to plead, and he will plead. if we cave on.
