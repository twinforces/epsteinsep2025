government’s allegations regarding Accuser-3 are thus not in, furtherance of, and are irrelevant
‘to, any alleged conspiracy to cause minors to travel to engage in unlawful sex acts.

I. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3.Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms..Maxwell.

The government:now concedes that when. it:alleges ‘that Epstein “sexually abused”
Accusér-3 ‘with Ms. Maxwell’s knowledge and assistaricé, the purportéd “séxual. abuse” to which
the government refers ‘was entirely: lawful. conduct—and that’the sole basis for the government’s
characterization. of that lawful. conduct as “sexual abuse” was Accuser-3’s “subjective:
experierice” of consensual Sex acts. Opp. 162..57. Such a characterization is, to say the least,
grossly misleading. As the government argued in a:2017 Supreme Court case, the term “sexual
abuse” implies a crime. See Esqiiivel=Quintana v. Sessions, 137 S:Ct. 1562, :1569.(2017)
(“*Sexual. abuse of a. minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes
conduct;that.(1) is i//egal, (2). involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed. at a person younger
than 18'yéars old.’”) (quoting governinent’s. briéf) (emphasés added). Merriam-Webstér’s, legal
dictionary defines “sexual abuse” as (i) “the infliction of sexual.contact upon a person'by
forcible compulsion,” (it) “engaging in sexual, contact with a person’who 1s below.a specified age
or. who is incapable of giving consent. because. of age oriental. or physical incapacity,” or (iii)
“the crime of engaging jin. or:inflicting sexual.abuse.” “Sexual abuse,” Merriam-Webster.com

Although the government concedes its. inability to establish that Accuser-3’s. alleged
interactions with Ms. Maxwell and Epstein‘weré anything other than consensual and, lawful, it
insists that.it-has “accurately” characterized those allegations and that “it is neither misleading
nor, prejudicial to imply that this activity involved illegal conduct.” Opp. 165. The:

government’s rationale: is baseless and untenable: Since the. government has alleged that. lawful.
