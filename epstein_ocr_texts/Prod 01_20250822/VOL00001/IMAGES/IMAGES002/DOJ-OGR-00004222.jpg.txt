government’s allegations regarding Accuser-3 are thus not in furtherance of, and are irrelevant
to, any alleged conspiracy to cause minors to travel to engage in unlawful sex acts.

I. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Unduly Prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell.

The government now concedes that when it alleges that Epstein “sexually abused”
Accuser-3 with Ms. Maxwell’s knowledge and assistance, the purported “sexual abuse” to which
the government refers was entirely lawful conduct—and that the sole basis for the government’s
characterization of that lawful conduct as “sexual abuse” was Accuser-3’s “subjective
experience” of consensual sex acts. Opp. 162 n.57. Such a characterization is, to say the least,
grossly misleading. As the government argued in a 2017 Supreme Court case, the term “sexual
abuse” implies a crime. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, 137 S.Ct. 1562, 1569 (2017)
(“Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes
conduct that (1) is i/legal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger
than 18 years old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Merriam-Webster’s legal
dictionary defines “sexual abuse” as (1) “the infliction of sexual contact upon a person by
forcible compulsion,” (i1) “engaging in sexual contact with a person who is below a specified age
or who is incapable of giving consent because of age or mental or physical incapacity,” or (iii)
“the crime of engaging in or inflicting sexual abuse.” “Sexual abuse,” Merriam-Webster.com

Although the government concedes its inability to establish that Accuser-3’s alleged
interactions with Ms. Maxwell and Epstein were anything other than consensual and lawful, it
insists that it has “accurately” characterized those allegations and that “it is neither misleading
nor prejudicial to imply that this activity involved illegal conduct.” Opp. 165. The
government’s rationale is baseless and untenable: Since the government has alleged that lawful
