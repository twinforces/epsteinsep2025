Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204-12 Filed 04/16/21 Page 18:0f 30

Reasons 6,'7, and 8:

34. The. last. step in Creating the qualified jury wheel is the sélection from. the master jury
wheel. of those deemed qualified and:not excused. Reasons 6, 7 and/or 8 are the:potential causes
of any disparity between the qualified jury wheel ‘and the master jury wheel.

35. Focusing onthe. difference between the master jury Wheel and the qualified jury
wheel, ‘one possible cause (reason 8) is that:the qualified jury: wheel, differs from the master jury
‘wheel. because, of chance in selecting persons from the voter registration lists to be sent: a
questionnaire to determine if:they are qualified and:not excused and should therefore be moved
to the qualified jury wheel. While possible, it is not-expected that the demographics of those
mailed a questionnaire will meaningly differ from. those not mailed a questionnaire. Any
variation should be:random and equally likely‘to overrepresent.or underrepresent any race or
ethnicity. Those:mailed a questionnaire are chosen, by:a simple random, sample drawn from, the
master jury Wheel. Given the size of the samples drawn, the representation on the master jury
wheel, should closely mirror the demographics of the voter lists.

36. However, some difference, between the qualified jury wheel and the master jury:
wheel. may be:caused by the clerical. error in transferring alternative:mailing addresses to the
master jury wheel (reason.6),,. which‘was noted by defendant’s expert Mr. Martin. If the clerical
error disproportionately impacted African Americans and Hispanics eitherpositively or
negatively it could explain some of:the difference between the qualified jury'wheel.and-the
master‘jury wheel. That: is, the clerical error failure'to pick up the zip :code from, the alternative:
addresses, on the Voter registration list likely prevented the questionnaire from reaching those
who ‘provided alternative addresses. All who were affected by this error were less likely to.

respond. to the questionnaire, but:we do not.know if the error affected. more African Americans
