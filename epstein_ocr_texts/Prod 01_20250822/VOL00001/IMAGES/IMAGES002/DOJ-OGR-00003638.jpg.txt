Reasons 6, 7, and 8

34. The last step in creating the qualified jury wheel is the selection from the master jury
wheel of those deemed qualified and not excused. Reasons 6, 7 and/or 8 are the potential causes
of any disparity between the qualified jury wheel and the master jury wheel.

35. Focusing on the difference between the master jury wheel and the qualified jury
wheel, one possible cause (reason 8) is that the qualified jury wheel differs from the master jury
wheel because of chance in selecting persons from the voter registration lists to be sent a
questionnaire to determine if they are qualified and not excused and should therefore be moved
to the qualified jury wheel. While possible, it is not expected that the demographics of those
mailed a questionnaire will meaningly differ from those not mailed a questionnaire. Any
variation should be random and equally likely to overrepresent or underrepresent any race or
ethnicity. Those mailed a questionnaire are chosen by a simple random sample drawn from the
master jury wheel. Given the size of the samples drawn, the representation on the master jury
wheel should closely mirror the demographics of the voter lists.

36. However, some difference between the qualified jury wheel and the master jury
wheel may be caused by the clerical error in transferring alternative mailing addresses to the
master jury wheel (reason 6), which was noted by defendantâ€™s expert Mr. Martin. Ifthe clerical
error disproportionately impacted African Americans and Hispanics either positively or
negatively it could explain some of the difference between the qualified jury wheel and the
master jury wheel. That is, the clerical error failure to pick up the zip code from the alternative
addresses on the voter registration list likely prevented the questionnaire from reaching those
who provided alternative addresses. All who were affected by this error were less likely to
respond to the questionnaire, but we do not know if the error affected more African Americans
