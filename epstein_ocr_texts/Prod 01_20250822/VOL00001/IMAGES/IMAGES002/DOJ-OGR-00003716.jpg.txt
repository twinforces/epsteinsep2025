ACUITY Reputation

Jane: Doe:3 is Virginia. Roberts—so not a new individual. The allegations made. by
Victoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue: The original allegations
are not new and have been fully responded to and shown. to. be untruc.

Each time the story is:r¢ told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about
public: figiires and-world leaders and.now it is alleged by. Ms.Roberts [sic] that

Alan Derschowit [sic]:is involved in having sexual relations with her, which he
denics..

Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be ‘treated as such and not
publicised as news, as-they are defamatory:

Ghislaine Maxwell’s original response to ‘the lies and defamatory claims remains
the same. Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which
have appeared.in the British:press and elsewhere and reserves-her ri ight? to seck
redress .at the repetition of such old defamatory claims.

Eight years afier Epstein’s guilty plea, Giuffre brought the defamation action, repeating:
many‘ of the:allegations she made in-her CVRA joinder motion. The:complaint alleged, thatthe
January:2015 statement “contained the following deliberate falschoods”:

(a) That Giuffre’s sworn allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.”

(b) That the allegations have been “shown to be untrue.”

(c) That Giuffre’s “claims are obviotis lics.”
