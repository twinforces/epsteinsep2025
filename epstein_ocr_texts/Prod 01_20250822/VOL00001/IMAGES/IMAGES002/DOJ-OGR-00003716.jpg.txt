Thanks for your understanding.

ACUITY Reputation

Jane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts—so not a new individual. The allegations made by

Victoria Roberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations

are not new and have been fully responded to and shown to be untrue.

Each time the story is re told [sic] it changes with new salacious details about

public figures and world leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts [sic] that

Alan Derschowitz [sic] is involved in having sexual relations with her, which he

denies.

Ms Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not

publicised as news, as they are defamatory.

Ghislaine Maxwell’s original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains

the same. Maxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which

have appeared in the British press and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek

redress at the repetition of such old defamatory claims.

Ex. N.

Eight years after Epstein’s guilty plea, Giuffre brought the defamation action, repeating
many of the allegations she made in her CVRA joinder motion. The complaint alleged that the
January 2015 statement “contained the following deliberate falsehoods”:

(a) That Giuffre’s sworn allegations “against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue.”

(b) That the allegations have been “shown to be untrue.”

(c) That Giuffre’s “claims are obvious lies.”
