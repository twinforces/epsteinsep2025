defense because it is in the possession of a third party. (Opp. 187-88). Ms. Maxwell anticipates
that the rest of the diary will contain exculpatory information and inconsistent statements. It is
therefore critical that Ms. Maxwell be able to review the original diary and to test it to ensure it is
authentic and written contemporaneously with the events it describes. If the government will not
obtain the diary, the Court should order the government to disclose the authorâ€™s identity so that
Ms. Maxwell can seek an appropriate subpoena. *

CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, we respectfully request that the Court grant the motions
presented in their entirety.
