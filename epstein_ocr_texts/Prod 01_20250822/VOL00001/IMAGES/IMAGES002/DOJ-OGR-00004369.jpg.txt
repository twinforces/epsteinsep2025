proof beyond a.reasonable: doubt of Epstcin’s criminal, culpability:.
Lastly, I' was not'trying to “dictate”’a.mecting with the U.S. Attorney
or anyone else. I stated. that I “would like” to, schedule a, mecting,
asking, to have the Same courtesy'that' was extended to the defense
attorneys extended: to the FBI and @ an Assistant in. the Office. With
that, disagreements about sirateey “and raising concerns about the
forgotten voices of the ‘victims in this case should not be classified
as a lapse in judgment. This Office should. scck to ‘foster spirited
debate: about the law and. the. use of prosecutorial diseretion .. . .
[M]y: first. and only’ concern, in. this case (and :my other child
exploitation cases) is the victims. If our personality differences
threaten their.access to justice, then please put someone: on:the: case.
whom you. trust:more, and ‘who'will also protect their 'rights.

In. the meantime, T will. be: mecting with the agents.on Monday to
begin preparing a revised. indictment package containing your

her -concerns.’' Menchel, however, told OPR. that he did not “order” Villafafia.to refrain from.
raising her ‘concerns with.Acosta, Sloman, or Louric, and he:did not’believe his email to Villafafia
foreclosed her from meeting with,Acosta. ‘Rather, “the context of this exchange:is, she is running
roughshod over the U:S. Attorney, and what I'am, saying to her is, there is.a, process: “You’re not:
in, charge oft. I’m‘not in charge of it. [Acosta’s] in charge of it.” Acosta,'who was apparently’
not aware of Villafana’s. email exchange: with, Menekcl, ‘told OPR that from his. perspective,
Villafana was not’ frozen out” of the casc and that:he would have met with her had.she-asked him.
