Dear Judge Nathan:

In:response to the Court’s Order dated October 22, 2021, regarding the Court’s draft preliminary
remarks for-prospcéctive jurors (Dkt. 366), the government took. the opportunity to reargue its requést
that counscl.cxercise: challenges to the final venire.on the last. day of jury. section (November 1.9) rather
than on November 29. ‘The Court:merely‘inyited a, discrete response to its proposed, address to
prospective jury but'the. government scized the opportunity to rearguc.

‘During‘the October’2 |, ‘conference, the defense: stated its reasons for preferring November 29, a.
date when the Court could inquire whcther.any prospective jury might not: be able to be fair or otherwise
impacted-or influenced by any:reference to this case. during’the. 10-day interval that included the:
Thanksgiving holiday. Further, it would climinate the:need to substitute alternates in, the event any, juror
was exposed to COVID or otherwise became ill. If last‘year was any indication, Thanksgiving weck is a.
likely time for COVID to spike due to high-volume travel, students returning home: from college, and
friends, and, familics congregating. ‘Even an exposure to the virus during the holidays can necessitate a
prospective juror to quarantine ‘for a-tinic period past.November 29.

During the conference, the government pressed. for November 19 because it:wanted a-have a firm.
start date for witnesses coming from out of state. November 29 is the firm start-date and openings ‘will

commence following exercise of challenges and the swearing in.of the jury. ‘The. government appears.
