Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document286  Filed.05/20/21 Page 5of14

Even ‘more incomprehensible is the government’s argument that, the allegations regarding
Accuser-3 arenot prejudicial. The government concedes ’that: it has characterized. Accuser=3’s
lawful, consensual sexual. encounters with Epstein as “sexual[] abuse[],” based solely on
Accuser-3’s “subjective experience” of those encounters. By characterizing those encounters as
“sexual[] abuse[],” the government’ has ‘falsely accused Ms. Maxwell of a crime that it now
adinits she did not commit, improperly: broadening the charges against her by implying that she
participated inthe sexual abuse of three minors rather than two. The. allegations as to Accuser-3
are ‘thus itrelevant and.prejudicial and should be stricken. At minimum, thé allegation that Ms.
Maxwell was complicit.in the purported sexual abuse of Accuser-3 should be stricken.

Finally, the government effectively: concedes that the admissibility. of evidence'regarding
Accuset-3 must be litigated‘under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). While the government’s effort to
establish the admissibility, of such, evidence in its opposition suffers from the same infirmities as
‘its inclusion of the allegations regarding Accuser-3 in the Indictment, Ms. Maxwell will:respond
tothe government’s admissibility arguments more’ fully at the appropriate time.

1. The Allegations Regarding Accuser-3 Are Irrelevant'to the Alleged Conspiracies.

The Indictment alleges that Ms. Maxwell. conspiréd-with Epstein. to (i) violate 18 U.S.C.
§.2422(a), with the objective of enticing ‘one or more individuals to travel, in interstate and
foreign commerce ‘for the purpose of engaging in unlawful sexual activity (Indictment! FF 9=10):
and (ii) violate: 18 U.S.C. §.2423(a), with the objective of transporting an individual under age 18
with the intent that the individual engage in unlawful sexual activity (Jd. $f 15-16). As an overt:
act in. furtherance of these, conspiraciés, the government alleges that Ms. Maxwell “encouraged
[Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein. in London, England, knowing that Epstein intended
to.sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those: massages.” /d.. Ff 11d, 17d (emphasis added). The.

Indictinent further-alleges that Epstein, “sexually abused” Accuser-3. Jd. [ 7c.
