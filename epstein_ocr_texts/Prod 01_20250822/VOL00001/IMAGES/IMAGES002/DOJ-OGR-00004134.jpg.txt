Re: United States‘v. Ghislaine. Maxwell, 20 Cr.330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government, respectfully submits this letter in ‘response to the: Court’s Order dated.
May 10,2021, which directed the Government to propose and justify any:requests ‘for redaction of
the defendant’s memorandum in.support.of her supplemental pre-trial motions.and exhibits. (Dkt.
No. 274).

After reviewing the defense’s memorandum, the Government sécks, a. limited riumber of:
redactions. These proposed redactions are consistent with, the three-part test articulated by the
Second ‘Circuit in Ligosch v. Pyramid. Co: of Onondaga, 435 F.3d. 11.0 (2d.Cir. 2006). Although
the defense’*s memorandum in.support:of hersupplemental pre-trial motions is a:judicial.document
‘subject'to the common law presumption of access, the proposed. redactions are narrowly, tailored.
to ‘protect the privacy interests of victims arid third parties referenced in the document. These
redactions are thus consistent-with:similar, tailored. redactions permitted. by‘the Court in this case
to protect the ‘privacy interests. of third ‘parties. (See; eg. Dkt. No. 168, 232). Today the
Goverment is, Submitting 'to the Court by cmail, its proposed tédactions to the ‘defense’s

memorandum, which the Government respectfully: requests be filed:under seal.
