Vs Magistrate Judge Netburn’s Order

On or about April 9, 2019, the Government advised Judge Netburn, who had not yet ruled
on the Government’s other application in Jane Doe 43 v. Epstein, et al., 17 Civ. 0616 (JGK) (SN),

Subsequently, on April 16, 2019, Judge Netburn denied the Government’s application. (Def. Mot.
3, Ex. H). Judge Netburn found that she was authorized under the All Writs Act to modify the
protective order, but declined to do so as the Government had not established exceptional

parties’ reliance on the protective order was reasonable and the presumption of confidentiality
should apply. (/d. at 5-6). The court rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional
circumstances and compelling need as relying on “the general desire for secrecy” and
“unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (/d. at 6). Judge Netburn concluded that “the
Government must demonstrate not that this investigation is an extraordinary circumstance, but that
the reason for seeking the documents is so extraordinary or compelling that there is a need to
modify the Protective Order. The Government has not met that standard.” (/d. at 7) (emphasis in
original).
