Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 219 of 348

OLC coneluded:that: because the CVRA, defines “‘erime victim’ as a ‘person. directly and.
proximately harmed bythe commission. of a Federal, offense,” . . . the definition, of victim, is ‘thus.
tethered. to the identification. of a, ‘Federal offense,’ an event t that occurs ‘with the filing ofa.
complaint.” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated that the CVRA codifics
the ‘rights of crime victims in ‘the Federal. judicial. system’” and a complaint “commences: the
‘judicial. process’ and. places an offense within the ‘judicial, system,’” the legislature must have.
intended for CVRA, rights to: commence upon the filing of a: complaint.

OLC. also found that the language of the CVRA rights supported its interpretation. For
example, the first right grants a victim: protection. from “the accused,” not a suspect. Additionally,
the:second, third, and. fourth rights refer to “victim notification, and. access to, public procccdings
involving release, plea, ‘sentencing ‘or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing ofa.
complaint.”
