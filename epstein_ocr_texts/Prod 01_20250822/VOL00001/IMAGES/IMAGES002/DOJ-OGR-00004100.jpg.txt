individual “is a prospective witness in this case; the Government will provide Carton with his
3500, Jencks and Giglio material by the deadline set by the Court”); United States v. Yudong Zhu,
No. 13 Cr. 761 (VM), 2014 WL 5366107, at *3 & n.3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 14, 2014) (rejecting a
subpoena request under Rule 17(h) even though the records were not in the Government’s
possession). Here, the Government has discharged its obligations already by providing the
defendant with the relevant pages from the diary, and Rule 17(h) bars a search for additional
statements.

The defendant’s theories miss the mark because Request 9, at its core, is precisely the sort
of “fishing expedition” that Nixon prohibits. 418 U.S. at 700. Accordingly, Request 9 should be
denied.

B. Request 10

The Government understands Request 10 to seek a pair of boots purchased by the defendant
and Jeffrey Epstein for Minor Victim-2. The defendant states that she would like to examine the
boots in order to “identify the make and provenance of the boots.” (4/2/21 Letter from Def., Dkt.
No. 244 at 11). This appears to be an attempt to use the boots to impeach Minor Victim-2’s
testimony, shrouded again in a conclusory claim about the need for authentication. For
substantially the reasons set forth above with respect to the diary, the Government respectfully
submits such a claim is meritless under Nixon.

However, and although the Government is not obligated to do so, the Government has
requested that BSF provide the boots to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI’’). BSF has
indicated that Minor Victim-2 will likely agree to do so. When the boots are in the FBI’s custody,
the Government intends to make them available promptly to the defense for examination and use
at trial, and will so notify the Court, which should moot Request 10. The Government submits,
