individual “is a prospective witness jin, this case; the Government ‘will ‘provide Carton, with his
3500, Jencks and. Giglio, material bythe deadline set by: the Court”); United States, v: Yudong Zhu,
No. ‘13 Cr. 761 (VM), 2014 WL 5366107, at *3 & n.3: (S.D.N-Y. Oct. 14, 2014) (rejecting a
subpoena request. under Rule '17(h) even though the records ‘were not in the Government’s
‘possession). ‘Here, the Government, has discharged. its obligations already by providing the
‘defendant with the relevant pages from. the diary, and Rule 17(h) bars a search for. additional
‘Statements:

The defendant’s theories miss the mark because Request 9, at its. core, is precisely the sort.
‘of “fishing expedition” that,Nixen prohibits, 418°U:S. at.700, Accordingly; Request 9 should be:

boots :in.order‘to “identify the make and:provenancc of the boots.” (4/2/21 Letter from Def., Dkt.
No. 244:.at. 11). This ‘appears'to be an,.attempt to use: the boots to impeach Minor Victim-2’s

substantially the reasons sct forth above with respect. to the diary, the Government respectfully
submits such a. claim is, meritless under Nixon.

However, and although. the Government is not obligated to :do so, the Government has
requested that BSF provide the boots to the Federal Burcau. of Investigation (“FBI”). BSF has
indicated that. Minor Victim=2 ‘will likelyagrec to do'so. When. the! boots are, in the FBI’s custody,
the Government intends to make them available promptly to the: defense .for.cxamination and:use

at trial, and. will so notify the Court, which should, moot Request 10. The Government. submits,
