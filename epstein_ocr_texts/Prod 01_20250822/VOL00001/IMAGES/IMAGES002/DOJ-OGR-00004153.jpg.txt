Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 285 Filed 05/20/21 Page 18 of 34

Two of the sources in the Daily News article insisted there was a second meeting in the
summer of 2016.1

In addition, as described above, AUSA [in 2021 said she recalls contemplating a
perjury prosecution of Maxwell. Ex. K, p 5. But if there were only the one meeting, it makes
little sense for AUSA J to have been thinking about a potential perjury prosecution in
February of 2016, before Maxwell had even been deposed (unless the plan was to set a perjury
trap for Maxwell). It is more likely that AUSA J contemplated a perjury prosecution after
a second meeting with Giuffre’s attorneys, which took place after at least one of Maxwell’s
depositions. As reported in the Daily News, “David [Boies] was particularly frustrated by the
failure to pursue a perjury charge.” '? “We have her dead to rights,” he said.“

This Court cannot accept without further inquiry the government’s assertion that there
wasn’t a second meeting or any further contact between the U.S. Attorney’s Office and Giuffre’s
attorneys. At a minimum, an evidentiary hearing is required.

e Defense 5: AUSA RR had no idea what was in Boies Schiller’s files.

The government stands by the claim that AUSA gg had “either little or no
additional information than [Judge McMahon did] in terms of what materials there are [and] who
was deposed” and, for all the government knew, the deposition transcripts would show “page
after page of people taking the Fifth.” See Resp. at 70. The government’s Response is not
credible.
