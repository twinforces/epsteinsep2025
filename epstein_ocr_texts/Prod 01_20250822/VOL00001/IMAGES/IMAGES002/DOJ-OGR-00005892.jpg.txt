not:mention the:misuse of'the:term in:civil litigation. Where a’victinuis suing:
an ‘employer or organization<in connection. with the sexual. abuse of a’minor
by ai cinployee or ‘volunteer, thas become commonplace for the Victinn’s
advocate’to argue that the failure to detect“*grooming™ was negligent onthe:
part of. the employer ‘or. organization. If their use of the ‘term. “grooming™
always. encompassed excessive focus on. a, particular:child, time. alone: with.
the: child, or inappropriate touching, this, usage;might not be problematic, ‘but
when, * ‘grooming® ‘is applied. to such, common and ‘desirable behaviors as,
being. kind.or. attentive or helpful or caring, there: is:considerable risk.of mis-:
lcading' the fact finder: into. believing that these latter behaviors are. well-
established, predictors of child sexual, abuse When, ‘there is id evidence.
whatsoever that they-can help discriminate between.good employeces,and vol-
unteers, on. the one? hand, and. risky employees. and: volunteers, on the other
hand. Inthe litigation-context, efforts to expand the.concept of “grooming” to:
efheompass desitable. behaviors that aire -riot associated with: clevated risk, is
misleading, particularly ‘when, coupled with the presumption or suggestion,
that “grooming” always reflects.an intent or-plan to offend.or, worse, that an.
offense can be proved bythe fact that the accused engaged:in “grooming.”

Seduction

Although I agree with: ‘Lanning QO. 8) that:the tern’ “seduction” is prefer tible.
to the tert “grooming,” atl ‘least Whenthereci8 an opportunity to: explain How
similarthe seduction.of a:child isto the seduction ofan, age-appropriate: part-
ner, there: is ample historical reason to be cautious: about’the use ofthe’ term.
“seduction” in: this context without further explanation, This. is because of.
two, archaic usages of “Seduction” inthe dldc¢ literature:

Archaic: Usage #1: Seduction asa Euphemism for the Offense

One, ofthe. archaic usages of “seduction,” found often.in the, oldéf scichitific
literature, is as. a vague cuphemism for any occurrence of child. sexual abuse:
or an exent that may have. been. sexually simulating tothe: child, as. in. these:

© *[A] shock of some kind ‘is, held :responsible for the. :ncurosis—an,
attack: by an animal, a threat of castration, a seduction, an actual. view-:
ing of: ‘parental. coitus... .” (Isaacs, 1928, p. 193).

frequency might not'be due:to:actual seduction that thechild had expe-
rienced... “” (Rank, 1942, p. 56).
