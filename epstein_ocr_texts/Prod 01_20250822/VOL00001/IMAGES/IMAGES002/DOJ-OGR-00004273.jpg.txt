as to the S| Indictment counts. ‘However, Annabi, by-its own terms, is inapposite to the
circumstances of this case, where one federal, district: has agreed'that “the United States” will.
abandon certain. offenses as part of a negotiated agreement and ‘then a.second federal district later
seeks to charge those very same’ offenses based on the exuef same conduet. Counts Five and Six
of the S2 Indictment aré therefore barred, by'the NPA. The Court must dismiss these counts, ‘as.

foreign. commerce to engage in,““sexual activity for which. a person can be charged with a
criminal offense” in. violation of 18 U.S.C. §.2423(a). (Ud. FF 16-19). In the'S 1 Indictment, thesé
‘counts were: based on conduct that occurred at unspecified times’ between 1994 and 1997. The

‘$2 ‘Indictment expands the date range of these conspiracies into the. 2000s based on the
