Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 142 of 239
Franks, 438 U.S. at 171 (“To mandate an evidentiary hearing, the challenger’s attack must be more
than conclusory and must be supported by more than a mere desire to cross-examine.”). Instead,
to warrant a Franks hearing:

[t]here must be allegations of deliberate falsehood or of reckless
disregard for the truth, and those allegations must be accompanied
by an offer of proof. ... Affidavits or sworn or otherwise reliable
statements of witnesses should be furnished, or their absence
satisfactorily explained. Allegations of negligence or innocent
mistake are insufficient. The deliberate falsity or reckless disregard
whose impeachment is permitted today is only that of the affiant,
not of any nongovernmental informant.
Td.

The burden to even obtain a Franks hearing is a heavy one, and such hearings are thus
exceedingly rare. See United States v. Brown, 744 F. Supp. 558, 567 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (“A
defendant seeking to have the Court hold a Franks hearing bears a substantial burden.”); United
States v. Swanson, 210 F.3d 788, 790 (7th Cir. 2000) (“These elements are hard to prove, and thus
Franks hearings are rarely held.”).

b. Discussion

In an alternative effort to suppress the materials obtained pursuant to the subpoena, the
defendant argues that an evidentiary hearing is warranted to inquire into the Government’s
“misrepresentations” to Chief Judge McMahon. (Def. Mot. 3 at 16). However, as discussed
extensively above, Maxwell’s motion is little more than speculation and innuendo, itself rooted in
a lone news article that, as described above, is not fully accurate. She otherwise presents no
admissible evidence, affidavits, or other materials supporting the breathless accusations contained
in her motion papers. As such, because the defendant does not include “an affidavit of someone
with personal knowledge of the underlying facts,” Shaw, 260 F. Supp. 2d at 570, and because the
