secks to offer under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b). Under Rule 404(b), iftthe prosecutor in a
criminal, case intends to use “evidence of a-crime, wrong, or other, act” against a defendant, the
prosécutor must “provide reasonable noticé.of the general nature of any‘ such evidence ‘thatthe.
prosecutor intends to offer at trial” and must:“do so in writing before trial—or in, any form.
during trial ifthe court; for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial:notice.” The Government
represents that it will notify the defense ofits intent to use 404(b) evidence at least 45 days in.
advance of trial to allow’Maxwell to file any motions in limine to be considered at the final,

ates | v. Thompson, No. 13-cr-378
(AJN), 2013. WL 6246489, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 3,201.3). The Court concludes this schedule:is
generally: reasonable, although additional time:to enable briefing and resolution in, advance of
trial. is strongly encouraged.

The Court’s denial of Maxwell’s requests to compel pretrial disclosures does: not preclude
the parties from negotiating in.good. faith foran expedited. discovery: timeline that-will account,
for Maxwell*s specific concerns. “[]]n most criminal cases, pretrial disclosure will redound to
the benefit of all. parties, counsel, and.the court.” United: States'v. Percevault, 490 F.2d 126, 132
(2d Cir. 1974). ‘In general, the Court will require the partics'to negotiate a’ final, omnibus.
schedule-to propose t6 the Court. The Court éonéludes,that'the, disclosure ofall of the above

materials approximately six to cight'wecks in advance of trial is appropriate and sufficient.
