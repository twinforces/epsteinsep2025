“Given thatthe hearing provides anopportunity for the Rule 412 movant.to. detail the .cvidence he
secks to. admit: and for the partics to discuss the propriety’ of its admission, the notice: requirement
should. be secn as serving two'‘purposcs: 1.) aiding’the Court.in determining the 'threshold:matter of
whether a. hearing’ is necessary;,:and 2) providing sufficient notice to the nonmovant and victim.
alike to prepare for and argue against, the necessity of any in camera hearing.” hited States v.

Government to investigate and meaningfully respond.to, such ‘sensitive and important issues. See’

412 motion on’'November 15, 2021, and.give notice to’both the Government and victims. See Fed.
R. Evid. 412(¢)(1)(D). At some point. over the: following two wecks=during' jury’ selection. and.

conduct-an in camera-hearing” that gives the’parties and the victims the right to be heard. See Fed.
