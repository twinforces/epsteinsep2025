Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 221 Filed 04/20/21 Page4of5
deadline to submit requests for jury selection dates in the third quarter of 2021 is May 15.
Following the submission of requests, the Clerk’s Office will assign jury selection dates
according to a protocol that has rules of priority. For example, criminal jury trials requesting a
particular jury selection date are given priority over civil jury trials requesting that same date.
Criminal trials involving detained defendants are given priority over criminal trials in which
defendants are not detained pre-trial. Among detained defendants, cases that set trial dates prior
to March 16, 2020 get priority. For any detained defendants whose trial date was set after March
16, 2020, priority is based upon who has been detained the longest. Absent a grant of an
adjournment, by May 15, the Court will request a jury selection date as close to July 12, 2021 as
possible. Once a jury selection date is assigned by the Clerk’s Office, that date is firm. As of
now, the parties should presume that trial will commence on a date close to July 12 (depending
on trial demand and the order of priority) and plan accordingly.

With this information in mind, the Court seeks confirmation and express clarification
from defense counsel for three reasons. First, Maxwell’s request for an adjournment came
before the Court ruled on the pending motions, including the Court’s granting of Maxwell’s
request to sever the perjury counts. Trial on the non-perjury counts will proceed first, which will
shorten preparations for and the length of trial on the non-perjury counts. Second, Maxwell’s
request was ambiguous as to the length of adjournment being requested. As noted, the letter
argued a 90-day adjournment was necessary but also suggested that some number of her defense
counsel would not be available until January 2022. And third, by this Order the Court denies
Maxwell’s request for a renewed bail hearing. All of these factors may influence Maxwell’s
adjournment request.
