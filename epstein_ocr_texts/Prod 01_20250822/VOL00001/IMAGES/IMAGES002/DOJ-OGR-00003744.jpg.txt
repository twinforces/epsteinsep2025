Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 280 Entered on FLSD Docket 01/02/2015 Page 8 of 14

The acts Epstein committed against Jane Doe #4, constituted numerous federal sex
offenses, some of which do not carry a statute of limitations and thus are not time-barred. See 18
U.S.C. § 3283. And these offenses were the kinds of offenses that the Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) and U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida were pursuing
in 2007. So far as Jane Doe #4 is aware, the U.S. Attorney’s Office made no serious effort to
locate her. Instead, after identifying approximately forty separate underage sexually abused
victims, and apparently preparing a 53-page federal indictment and with full awareness of the
existence of many victims like Jane Doe #4 — unidentified and not interviewed — it entered into a
non-prosecution agreement barring prosecution of Epstein’s federal crimes against these victims.
This is contrary to the Government’s normal approach in prosecuting federal sex offenses. It
also violated Jane Doe #4’s rights under the CVRA, including the fact that she had a
“reasonable” right to confer with the U.S. Attorney’s Office before they entered into an
agreement with a sex offender barring prosecution of him for the crimes he committed against
her. 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5).
