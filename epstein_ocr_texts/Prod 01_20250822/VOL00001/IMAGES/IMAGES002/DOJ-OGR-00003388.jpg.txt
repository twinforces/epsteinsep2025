parties.7°° The rush to reach a resolution should not have led the USAO to agree to such a
significant provision without a full consideration of the potential consequences and justification
for the provision. It is highly doubtful that the USAO’s refusal to agree to that term would have
itself caused the negotiations to fail; the USAO’s rejection of the defense proposal concerning
immigration consequences did not affect Epstein’s willingness to sign the agreement. The
possibility that individuals other than Epstein’s four female assistants could have criminal
culpability for their involvement in his scheme could have been anticipated and should have caused
more careful consideration of the provision.

Similarly, the confidentiality provision was also accepted with little apparent consideration
of the implications of the provision for the victims, and it eventually became clear that the defense
interpreted the provision as precluding the USAO from informing the victims about the status of
the investigation. Agreeing to a provision that restricted the USAO’s ability to disclose or release
information as it deemed appropriate mired the USAO in disputes about whether it was or would
be violating the terms of the NPA by disclosing information to victims or the special master.
Decisions about disclosure of information should have remained within the authority and province
of the USAO to decide as it saw fit.

There is nothing improper about a U.S. Attorney not having a meeting with the line AUSA
or other involved members of the prosecution team before he or she makes a decision in a given
case; indeed, U.S. Attorneys often make decisions without having direct input from line AUSAs.
And Acosta did have discussions with Menchel, and possibly Sloman, before making the critical
decision to resolve the matter through a state plea, although the specifics of those discussions could
not be recalled by the participants due to the passage of time. This case, however, was different
from the norm, and Acosta was considering a resolution that was significantly different from the
usual plea agreement. Contemporaneous records show that Acosta believed the case should be
handled like any other, but Acosta’s decision to fashion an unorthodox resolution made the case
unlike any other, and it therefore required appropriate and commensurate oversight. Acosta may
well have decided to proceed in the same fashion even if he had sought and received a full briefing
2n8 CEOS Chief Oosterbaan told OPR this provision was “very unusual.” Principal Associate Deputy Attorney
General John Roth commented, “I don’t know how it is that you give immunity to somebody who’s not identified. I
just don’t know how that works.” Villafafia’s co-counsel told OPR:

[I]t’s effectively transactional immunity which I didn’t think we were supposed

to do at the Department of Justice. ... I’ve never heard of anything of the sort... .

[W]e go to great lengths in most plea agreements to go and not give immunity for

example, for crimes of violence, . . . for anything beyond the specific offense

which was being investigated during the specific time periods and for you and

nobody else. I mean on rare occasion I’ve seen cases where say someone was

dealing drugs and their wife was involved. ... And they’ve got kids. . . . [and] it’s

understood that the wife probably could be prosecuted and sent to jail too, but you

know the husband’s willing to go and take the weight .... This is not one of

those.
Deputy Attorney General Filip called the provision “pretty weird.” Menchel’s successor as Criminal Chief told OPR
that he had never heard of such a thing in his 33 years of experience as a prosecutor. A senior AUSA with substantial
experience prosecuting sex crimes against children commented that it was “horrendous” to provide immunity for
participants in such conduct.
