Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 390 Filed 10/29/21 Page9of11
from lawyers representing plaintiffs against Epstein. This one-off document is far from a
reliable business record. There is simply no evidence to suggest that this document was created
in the course of any business. Rather, the exhibit was specifically “prepared” in anticipation of
litigation against Mr. Epstein and therefore is not a business record. Records prepared in
anticipation of litigation are not made in the ordinary course of business. See Palmer v.
Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109 (1943) (reports prepared for the purpose of litigation do not fall within
business records exception to hearsay rule because they are not kept in the course of regularly
conducted business); Timberlake Const. Co. v. U.S. Fidelity and Guar. Co., 71 F.3d 335, 342
(10th Cir.1995) (“It is well-established that one who prepares a document in anticipation of
litigation is not acting in the regular course of business.”); United States v. Casoni, 950 F.2d 893,
911, n.10 (3d Cir.1991).

Setting aside the fact that the document was prepared for a criminal purpose, to be
admissible as a business record the proponent of the document must establish the source of the
contested information, that is, (1) the author of the document had personal knowledge of the
matters reported; (2) the information he reported was transmitted by another person who had
personal knowledge, acting in the course of a regularly conducted activity; or (3) it was the
author's regular practice to record information transmitted by persons who had personal
knowledge. See Missimer v. Tiger Machine Co., No. 04-3443, 2005 WL 3968133, at *2 (E.D.Pa.
Sept. 28, 2005). In addition, the proponent must establish the information was kept in the regular
course of the author’s business, and it was the author’s regular practice to prepare such reports.
See Fed. R. Evid. 803(6); United States v. Pelullo, 964 F.2d 193, 200 (3d Cir.1992) (for business
record exception to apply, proponent must establish “(1) the declarant in the records had personal
knowledge to make accurate statements; (2) the declarant recorded the statements
