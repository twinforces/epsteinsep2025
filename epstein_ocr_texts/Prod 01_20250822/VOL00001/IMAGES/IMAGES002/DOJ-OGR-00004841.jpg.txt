Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 310-1 Filed 07/02/21 Page 29 of 80
permission from a court is a prerequisite to any offer of transactional immunity. See id.
§ 5947(b) (“The Attorney General or a district attorney may request an immunity order
from any judge of a designated court.”). Because D.A. Castor did not seek such
permission, and instead acted of his own volition, the trial court concluded that any
purported immunity offer was defective, and thus invalid. Consequently, according to the
trial court, the “press release, signed or not, was legally insufficient to form the basis of
an enforceable promise not to prosecute.” T.C.O. at 62.

The trial court also found that “Mr. Castor’s testimony about what he did and how
he did it was equivocal at best.” /d. at 63. The court deemed the former district attorney's
characterization of his decision-making and intent to be inconsistent, inasmuch as he
testified at times that he intended transactional immunity, while asserting at other times
that he intended use and derivative-use immunity. The trial court specifically credited
Attorney Troiani’s statements that she never requested that Cosby be provided with
immunity and that she did not specifically agree to any such offer.

(c) Order to testify.--WWhenever a witness refuses, on the basis of his

privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or provide other information in

a proceeding specified in subsection (a), and the person presiding at such

proceeding communicates to the witness an immunity order, that witness

may not refuse to testify based on his privilege against self-incrimination.

(d) Limitation on use.--No testimony or other information compelled under

an immunity order, or any information directly or indirectly derived from such

testimony or other information, may be used against a witness in any

criminal case, except that such information may be used:
(1) in a prosecution under 18 Pa.C.S. § 4902 (relating to perjury) or
under 18 Pa.C.S. § 4903 (relating to false swearing);
(2) in a contempt proceeding for failure to comply with an immunity
order; or
(3) as evidence, where otherwise admissible, in any proceeding
where the witness is not a criminal defendant.
42 Pa.C.S. § 5947(a)-(d).
