Ghislaine Maxwell,
OPINION & ORDER
Defendant.

ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

In June 2020, a grand jury returned a six-count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell
with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual abuse of minor victims from around
1994 to 1997. The Government filed a first (S1) superseding indictment shortly thereafter,
which contained only small, ministerial corrections. The S1 superseding indictment included
two counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of
the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It also included two
counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell’s testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to
begin on July 12, 2021.

Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the S1 superseding
indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those
motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking
count and another related conspiracy count.

This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell’s currently pending pretrial motions other than
those seeking to suppress evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and
this Opinion, deal exclusively with the S1 superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues
