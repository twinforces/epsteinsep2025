“cross-examined the detectives” about the identification procedure and “pointed out that [the
defendant] was charged even though he had a confirmed alibi and [the alternative perpetrator] did
not.” 799 F.2d at 613. The court said in addition that “[a] common trial tactic of defense lawyers
is to discredit the caliber of the investigation or the decision to charge the defendant, and we may
consider such use in assessing a possible Brady violation.” Jd. But the Court did not say that any

weapon and the victim’s purse in the places they were found”). See also United States v. Mickens,
Nos. 20-258 (L), 20-462, 20-630, 2021 WL 3136083, at *9 (2d Cir. July 26, 2021) (summary
order) (describing a defense that “emphatically and repeatedly” attacked the thoroughness of the
Government’s investigation in “‘cross-examinations and closing statements”). But that is all.
Indeed, if such a line of defense were permissible, it would be used routinely, and the defense
