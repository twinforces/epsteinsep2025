‘Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 204-4. Filed 04/16/21, Page 3 of 6

° <AK’s recollection is that the attorticys did not. make any suggestions regarding what
investigative steps SDNY should take. ‘The attorneys did, not ‘suggest; that; SDNY. use.
civil lawsuits as a.means to conduct a-criminal, investigation.

o° Discussion of Epstcin’s conduct expanded, beyond, Virginia, Roberts. Attorneys described.
the conduct:as involving. many ‘or several other girls. There:was more detail, provided.
about. Virginia Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about.Epstcin’s
conduct as ‘a pattern and long-running, if not ongoing, behavior’ that continued after
Virginia was.no‘longer involved.

o AK’s understanding was ‘not that the attorneys were hoping SDNY ‘would investigate or
charge anyone other than,Epstein. The meeting was focused on Epstein.. There:was,
mention of other people who: had helped-him over time, including an individual who'was
in Europe and potentially was a source of evidence against Epstein. The thrust of the:
discussion was about building a case against Epstein. The other individuals were
mentioned. or described as part of telling the story, or as, potential sources. of information.

o AK.doés not remember exactly what:she said at the end. of the mecting, but.she knows
herpractice was that in.cvery such mecting’ she has ever had, she has:thanked the people
for coming in,and been, completely non-committal and non-responsive about what'the
office would:do about'the information that was provided.

o AK.absolutely did not'tell the attorncys that! an investigation would be opened.

Events after February 29, 2016 meeting:

o After the February 29,2016 meeting, AK.emailed, Dan, Stein (Chief of ‘Criminal Division
shared, AK’s thoughts, and Stcin’s:thoughts. Decided on an.action plan.

o AK knew there'was the pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation, which
gave AK, some pause because she had other oceasions where civil. litigants have
decided to report something to:the USAO because they think, it'will help them jin,
their civil:case. AK:mentionced.that to Stcin.

o Discussed’the length of time that had passed; wasn’t clear there. was any ongoing
conduct; USAO SDFL is. a reputable USAO'with skilled’FBI agents, and. AK’s.
assumption, was that however they:concluded their case probably reflected
something ‘about the strength of the case or some:issue that-cxisted.

© Oneé'thing that leaned in ‘favor of taking action was that one of the lawyers (Stan
or Brad) 'said that FBI agents. in Florida, case were not happy with the result.and
in this. arca-usually, in AK’s ‘experience, make: collaborative decisions:with the:
USAO.

6 AK.& Stein decided (don’t recall who came ‘up with idea) that AK’would reach
out to Scan Watson (head. of FBI C-20 atthe time) and ‘ask him.to contact. Miami
FBI agents to ask if they in fact were:unhappy'with the: outcome:and felt like
justice had not been served.

0, After the meeting with Stein, AK. called Scan Watson. and relayed the summary of this
and. asked him’to reach out. to the Miami agents who ‘were on the Epstein.case. AK. asked
