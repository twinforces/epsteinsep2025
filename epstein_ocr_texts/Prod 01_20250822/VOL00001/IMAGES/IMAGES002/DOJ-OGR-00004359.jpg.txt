Lourie opined that.the government:could argue “that.over time [Epstein] setup a network of illegal
high school, massage recruits: that; would’be difficult'to duplicate anywhere else,” which ‘supported,
the conclusion that. the massages must: have been a-motivating purpose of his,travel, ifnot. the sole
purpose. However, ‘Loutic éxpréssed concern. about “getting to. the jury” on this. issue and noted.
that he had. not found.a Icgal. case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with.
‘Louric’s analysis ‘of the purpose of'travel issuc and’had discussed .the matter with him.” Villafaiia
also recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and, her colleagues considered.
“particularly‘weak.”

On June 26, 2007, Sloman, Menchel, Louric,, Villafafia, the case-agent, and:the West Palm.
‘Beach squad. supervisor met: at the ‘Miami, USAO with ‘Epstein. attorneys Dershowitz, Black,
Lefcourt, and, ‘Sanchez, Dershowitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO
perspective, the mecting' was, mercly’.a “listening' session.”** Echoing the arguments made ‘in.
Lefceourt’s. Ictter, Dershowitz: argued. that the USAO should, permit the state: to handle the case
because these were. “traditionally. state: offenses.” The. case agent recalled being ‘uncomfortable
that the defense was asking, questions in. an. attempt to gain. information about the federal
investigation, including the number of. victims and the types of ‘sexual contact. that.had been
Involved.

Villafaria told ‘OPR that when. Epstcin’s attorneys Icft the: mecting, they appeared to be:
“under the:impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told‘OPR, “[T]hey
obviously:did:not persuade” the USAO'because “we ..... didn’t:drop the investigation.” According
to Villafafia, Couric, ‘and Menchel, during’ ‘a, short ‘post-mecting’ discussion at: which, ‘Lourie:
expressed. concern about, the purpose of travel issue and.Menchel raised issucs related. to general
erédibility‘of the victims, the prevailing sense amiong the USAO participants was thatthe. defense
presentation had. not: been. persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that :she “left [the mecting] with the:
impression that we were continuing towards” filing charges.

RESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION

USAO internal communications show that in July: 2007, Acosta-devcloped, or adopted, the
broad outline of an. agreement that could. resolve the federal, investigation. The agreement would.
leave the ease in state court. by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would
accomplish three goals important to: the federal prosccutors: Epstein’ s incarecration; his
registration as a'scxual offender; and a mechanism,to' provide for'the:victims to recover monetary:

massages.

“ In his written response ‘to ‘OPR, Menchel indicated:that he had ‘no independent recollection, of the June 26,

position”
