these interviews constitute witness statements covered by the Jencks Act and are not subject to
disclosure by statute until after each witness has completed direct examination at trial. See 18
U.S.C. § 3500. As noted above, however, the Government fully intends to provide all Jencks Act

counsel attached as Exhibit C was recovered during the execution of a search warrant for one of
Epstein’s devices and was produced to defense counsel in the form in which it was recovered from
the device. In other words, defense counsel has received two copies of this same document: the
redacted version that Epstein had on one of his devices, and the unredacted version from the FBI’s
files.
