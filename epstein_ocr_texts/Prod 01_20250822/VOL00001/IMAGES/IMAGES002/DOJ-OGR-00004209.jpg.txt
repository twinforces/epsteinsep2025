Putting aside the admissibility of this testimony, it appears that both men were involved in the
investigation of Mr. Epstein and are expected to testify about their investigation. Plaintiff's
allegations were not a part of their investigation, which took place years after Plaintiff left the
country. Moreover, their investigation did not involve Ms. Maxwell. Again, such duplicative
and irrelevant deposition testimony speaks to the intended purpose of the ten-deposition limit,
not a reason to exceed that limit.

The same holds true for Nadia Marcinkova, Sarah Kellen (a/k/a Sarah Kensignton or
Sarah Vickers) and Jeffrey Epstein, each of whom Plaintiff anticipates will not respond to
questions and invoke their Fifth Amendment right. As discussed above, such invocation has no
bearing on the issues in this matter. Moreover, it is obviously cumulative and duplicative.

Plaintiff also identifies Rinaldo Rizzo and Jean Luc Brunel but fails to provide any
information from which Ms. Maxwell or the Court could identify the subject matter of their
expected testimony. Thus, it is unclear how these individuals have information that differs from
or would add to the other proposed deponents. It is the Plaintiff's burden to explain to the Court
why these depositions should be permitted if they exceed the presumptive limit, why the
information would not be cumulative, and its relevance to the important issues in the action, or
the importance of the discovery in resolving those issues. She simply fails to provide any
information by which the Court can assess these factors, and thus should not be permitted to
exceed the deposition limit based on her proffer.
