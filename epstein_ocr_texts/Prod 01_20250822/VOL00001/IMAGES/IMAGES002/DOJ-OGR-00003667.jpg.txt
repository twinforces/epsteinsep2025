no dispute that Congress could have amended § 3283 in 2003 to extend the limitations period for
live charges; had it done so explicitly, the government would prevail on the first Landgraf step.’
Rather, the second Landgraf step asks whether the effects of retroactive application of a statute
are such that the Court, in the absence of an express retroactivity provision, should presume that
Congress intended to apply the statute retroactively. See Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 283 (framing
issue as whether a law is “the kind of provision that [applies] to events antedating its enactment
in the absence of clear congressional intent”).* As both Miller and Gentile recognize, Toussie
suggests that, in the context of a criminal statute of limitations, Congress should not be presumed
to have intended retroactive application absent a clear expression of such intent, and the Court
should not reach such a conclusion here.
I. Section 3283 Does Not Apply at All.

Ms. Maxwell’s Motion should be granted for the separate and independent reason that
regardless of whether the 2003 Amendment can be applied retroactively, § 3283 does not apply
to the offenses with which Ms. Maxwell is charged. Neither enticement of an individual to travel
nor transportation of a minor is an “offense involving” the sexual or physical abuse or
kidnapping of a child. The government fails to rebut the long line of cases interpreting “offense
involving” language to refer to offenses that necessarily entail particular conduct, and the
’ For this reason, the government’s invocation of Falter v. United States, 23 F.2d 420 (2d Cir. 1928)—a case
decided decades before both Landgraf and Toussie—adds nothing to the analysis. While the government cites
Falter for the uncontroversial proposition the law treats the revival of time-barred criminal charges more harshly
than the extension of live charges—indeed, as the government points out, the former raises issues under the Ex Post
Facto Clause—it sheds no light on the issue of statutory interpretation here, particularly in light of Landgraf and
Toussie.

* The fact that the inquiry into a statute’s retroactive effects is the second step of Landgraf, rather than the first,
demonstrates that Landgraf is not an inquiry into a statute’s constitutionality. If the Landgraf analysis were simply
an inquiry into whether the Ex Post Facto clause permits Congress to apply a criminal statute of limitations
retroactively, as the government contends (Opp. 34-35), the first step would have to be read out of Landgraf
entirely. Otherwise, Congress could expressly prescribe an unconstitutional retroactive application of a statute,
thereby ending the analysis at step one before the court ever addressed the statute’s constitutionality.
