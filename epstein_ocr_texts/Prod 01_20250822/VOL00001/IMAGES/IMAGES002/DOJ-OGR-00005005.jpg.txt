Re: United States y.. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2:20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

Pursuant.to the Court’s order, dated. August 13, 202.1, we respectfully submit this Ictter to
inform the Court that Ms.. Maxwell. docs: not seck any:redactions:to the Court’s sealed. Opinion and
Order, dated August..13, 2021, or'the:underlying motion. papers.

We note that, under the terms of the Protective Order entered ‘in, this case, defense counsel,
are prohibited, from “filing ‘publicly as an attachment to,a filing or ¢xcérpted within a filing the
identity of. any victims.or, witnesses: referenced iin. the discovery, who have not spoken by‘ name. on.
the public: record in.this case.” (Dkt. 36.46). The underlying motion papers reference the names
‘of accusers and potential, witnesses who‘have spoken on the public record in this' case and others
who have spoken publicly but not associated, themselves directly with this case. The: Court has
ruled 'that:the cxistence of the Protective ‘Order; by itself, is not sufficient to justify redactions, and
that any redactions must be justified ‘under the three- -pait test articulated by'the Second Circuit in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). ;

The defense has consistently taken the position that the names of the accusers and other
‘witnesses, who, have chosen to speak:to the media about. thcir alleged experiences, including:
regarding the very'materials sought by the subpocna, should be publicly disclosed, and that it 'is not.
the defense’s burden-to justify:redacting their names. Accordingly, the defense does not seck any
redactions. If the government wishes to seck:any redactions, we respectfully submit that:it:is their
burden — not Ms.’Maxwell’s — to justify them under Lugosch.
