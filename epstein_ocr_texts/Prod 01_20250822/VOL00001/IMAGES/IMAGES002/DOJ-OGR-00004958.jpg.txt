This is not consistent with principles of fundamental fairness.
(emphasis added).

The press (including Bloomberg, NBC, the New York Post, and Forbes)‘ reported
on this argument by Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers. Accordingly, there is no substantial
likelihood that the Op-Ed, which made the very same arguments that were made by
Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers and covered extensively in the press, will interfere with a fair
trial, and the Government does not even really attempt to argue to the contrary.®

Second, Ms. Maxwell’s family, and undersigned as counsel for her family, have
the right to respond to the numerous lawyers, witnesses, and surrogates who are
speaking to the press and making it impossible for Ms. Maxwell to receive a fair trial.
As Justice Kennedy explained in Gentile, “in some circumstances press comment is
necessary to protect the rights of the client and prevent abuse.” Such “statements have
the full protection of the First Amendment.” Gentile, 501 U.S. at 1058 (Kennedy, J.,
concurring).

The press has been unrelenting and overwhelmingly prejudicial in its coverage
of Ms. Maxwell and her family, fueled by statements from involved parties about the
matters at issue. It is not an understatement to say that 99.9% of the press coverage

5 The Government also complains that the Op-Ed described the accusations as “stale”
and “flimsy.” But both descriptions have been used in publicly filed pleadings.
Moreover, many of the accusations are in fact decades old, and similar descriptive
words have been held not to violate the rules. See, e.g., Law360, Brooklyn U.S.
Attorney’s Pretrial Remarks Fair Game, Judge Says, July 1, 2021 (reporting that Judge
Dora Irizarry held that U.S. Attorney’s comments that defendant had engaged in a
“spree” of robberies that were “unprecedented” did not violate the local rule and also
