Dear Judge Nathan:

Counsel for Ms. Maxwell has conferred with Boies Schiller & Flexner (BSF)
concerning any proposed redactions to the pleadings addressing the Rule 17(c) subpoena sub
judice, specifically Defendant’s Response of April 2 and BSF’s Reply of April 5, both of
which were submitted to the Court via email in order to allow an opportunity to address any
necessary redactions.

Ms. Maxwell is mindful of the Court’s previous directive that any proposed redactions
must be specifically justified and tailored yet is obligated by the Protective Order at § 6 to
seek to redact two references to an individual’s name and description of that witness that were

exhibits.

Those two references were derived from a document that the government marked
