which Villafafia and Louric believed that the state: had intentionally failed:to aggressively pursue
‘a, broader state indictment:

One cxample:illustrates this communication gap. In a'September 20, 2007 email to-Louric
asking him. to read the latest version. of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for
aprecments. “We should ‘only « go for ward if’ the tr ial eam supports and signs ‘this. agree ement. I
didn’t even'sign the ‘public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not.be the first.”
(Emphasis added.) In ‘his email to Villafafia, Lourie attached Acosta’s, cmail and instructed
Villafatia to. “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay: Uctowitr|
he wanted. to give the “trial t team” a - chance to‘ “speak up and ict him know” if they ‘did not ‘feel
comfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, however, told OPR. that.she did ‘not ‘understand ‘that:
shé was being given an opportunity to obj cct'to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted,
her to sign: ‘it because he was taking an “arm’s: length” approach and signaling this “was not his
deal.” The fact that the top decision.maker belicved he: was giving the: line: AUSA an. opportunity
to reflect and.'stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA.
believed she was being ordered.to sign'the agreement. because: her boss. wanted to distanec himself
from the decision, reflécts a sérious Communication gap.

rebuke, Menchel rejected the request: Although: ‘Menchel. told, OPR. that ‘he, was. not prohibiting:
Villafaria from speaking to Acosta, Villafana interpreted. Menchel’s email to nican that she could,
not scck .a meeting With Acosta. AS. a consequence, Acosta made his decision. about a. state
resolution. and the term of incarccration'without any direct: ‘input from Villafafia. Acosta:told OPR.
that ‘he was unaware: that ‘Villafafia ‘had. sought a. meeting with, him and ‘he would. have met. with.
her if-she had asked him directly. OPR did not, find. any written evidence of a meeting involving

facts and the law—before Acosta mad¢ his:decision to resolve'the casé through state charges or to
offer the two- -year'term, and. Villafafia-said she did not have any.input into the decision. Although.
a.U.S. Attorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and.it may be that. Menchel
presented. what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no.evidence'that.Acosta was aware
of Villafafia’s'strong views.about, and objections to, the’proposed resolution.*°°

Two logistical problems: hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers
involved. in. the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the:
offices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia. and, to a, lesser extent,
Lourie=were located in. West.Palm Beach. Consequently; Villafania’ s discussions with her senior

286 In her 2017 Declaration inthe: CVRA ‘litigation, Villafafia. stated, that, given the challenges, of obtaining
victims’ cooperation. with a federal prosecution, “lbelieved.and still belicve'that anegotiated.resolution‘of the matter’
wasn ‘the best interests. of ‘the [USAO] and ‘the vietims as a-whole. The [USAO] had also reached that:same
conclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villatafia i in fact supported the NPA. In/her
OPR interview, how ever, Villafaia drew a distinction between resolving the iny estigation through negotiations that
led: to what i in her view was a reasonable outcome; which she would have supported; and “this negotiated resolution” —
that:is, the NPA—which she did not support.
