how the particular Master Wheel is selected. It says nothing about the process by which a Master
Wheel is reduced to the subset of qualified jurors contained in the Qualified Wheel. Because the
“systematic defect” alleged by the defendant relates to the Master Jury Wheel, the White Plains
Master Jury Wheel is the appropriate “relevant jury pool.” Rioux, 930 F. Supp. at 1566-68.

Although the Master Jury Wheel does not include reliable information regarding the race
and ethnicity of the individuals selected from voter registration lists, the racial and ethnic makeup
of the White Plains Master Jury Wheel can be estimated using geocoding and Bayesian Improved
Surname Geocoding (“BISG”).© Taking into account those estimates, the White Plains Master
Wheel is 11.20% Black or African-American and 12.97% Hispanic or Latino. (Siskin Aff. at §
28). By contrast, the White Plains Qualified Wheel is 8.76% Black or African-American and
10.48% Hispanic or Latino. (/d. at § 17).

The community population for purposes of assessing representativeness is the population
eligible for jury service in the community. See, e.g., Taylor v. Louisiana, 419 U.S. 522, 524 (1975)
(focusing on population eligible for jury service); Rioux, 97 F.3d at 657 (“We conclude that the
appropriate measure in this case is the eighteen and older subset of the population ....”). But how
should the relevant “community” be defined? The defendant contends that it is the jury eligible
population of the “Manhattan Division,” because that is where the offense occurred and where she
assumes she will be tried. (Def. Mot. 9 at 6). As set forth above, she is wrong. The relevant
°° The defense motion references the expert report of an expert witness named Jeffrey O’Neal
Martin (“Martin Aff.”’), which was prepared for the defense in United States v. Balde, No. 20 Cr.
281 (KPF), where a similar motion is currently pending before Judge Failla. The Government is
likewise attaching the expert report of Dr. Bernard R. Siskin, which was prepared for the
Government in Balde. As detailed Dr. Skiskin’s report, geocoding is based on estimating the
proportion of persons who are of a given race or ethnicity based on the racial and ethnic area in
which they live. (See Affidavit of Dr. Bernard R. Siskin (“Siskin Aff.”), attached hereto as Exhibit
12, at § 26). BISG enhances the accuracy of geocoding for Hispanic or Latino persons by using
information about persons’ last names. (/d.).
