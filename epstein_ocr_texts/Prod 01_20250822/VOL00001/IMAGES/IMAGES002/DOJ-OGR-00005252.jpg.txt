defendant claims ‘that. because. this. case has received significant pretrial, publicity’ arid ‘the, charges
voir dire ‘after the ‘Court’s general. ‘voir dire,” but.she docs ‘not. identify what. information, she
belicves that her-attorncys would be more:capable of'discovering than-the Court. (Dkt. No. 342 at.
1,10). Evenif counsel identify specific or additional issues the defendant believes her attorneys
should, be able to explore in. light of, as the defendant claims, the attorneys’ “moré in-depth
knowledge of the case” (id. at.1 1), counsel are .free:to propose additional questions that the: Court
may ask, and the Court; is.in'the best’position to consider whether such inquiry’ is appropriate and,
if $0, how to-pose-such questions:in a way that is fairto:the interests ofall partics.and the potential
jurors. Even if counsel, attempt to.ask their additional questions in. an even-handed way, counsel
may easily and inadvertently: step over: the line and significantly ‘prejudice the other side. See:
Saipov, 2020: WL 958527, at *1 (holding that court-conducted voir dire “assures that:the partics
do not:stray into impermissible areas that could potentially taint the prospective jurors’ answers or
adversary”).

The defendant claims, ‘that: “questioning conducted exelusively by ‘the ‘Court further
hampers ‘the. ability ‘to "uncover important information, about. jurors because it placcs, jurors in. a
defendant’s motion, does not. expand. upon this conclusory assertion, but instead. cites “research”

that appears to broadly recommend in-depth voir dire. (Jd. at 13-14). But there is no reason. to

1428 (S.D.N-Y. 1983) (rejecting defense request for attorncy-conducted voir dire and noting ‘that.
court-conducted voir dire has resulted. in the “empanclling of fair and impartial jurics”; “And this
has been truce of cascs that-have attracted:in advance of trial:the widest'publicity in,the:news media
over extended periods of time.”).
