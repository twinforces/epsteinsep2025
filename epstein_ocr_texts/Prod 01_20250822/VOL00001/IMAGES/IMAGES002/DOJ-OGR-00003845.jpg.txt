ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

In its April 16, 2021 Opinion, the Court denied the Defendant’s motions to dismiss the $1
superseding indictment in whole or in part and granted the Defendant’s motion to sever the
perjury counts for a separate trial. Dkt. No. 207. The Court will try the non-perjury counts first.

As the Court noted in its Opinion, it has not yet resolved the Defendant’s two motions to
suppress evidence. See Dkt. Nos. 133, 139. The Defendant contends in those motions that the
Government obtained by subpoena documents covered by a protective order in violation of her
rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, against self-incrimination, and to due process
of law. The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the
Government knowingly misrepresented facts to procure an order modifying the protective order.

The Court requires information from the Government for scheduling purposes.

The Government is ORDERED to inform the Court by letter docketed on ECF no later
than April 20, 2021, whether it intends to use any of the documents subject to the pending
motions to suppress in the trial of the non-perjury counts in this case.
