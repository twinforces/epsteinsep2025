anon-prosecution, agreement with another, district would.be a miscarriage of, justice. See United
States v. Carter, 454 F.2d 426, 427-28 (4"" Cit. 1972) (federally prosecuting defendant a second
time for the same charges previously resolved by a plea agreement with a different federal
district puts at stake. “thehonor ofthe government[,] public confidence in the fair administration,
of justice, and the efficient’ administration of justice in a féderal. scheme of government”):
‘autonomous fiefdoms. They represent:the United States, and their promises om behalf of the
Governinient must bitid eachother absent express cOfitractual, limitations or. disavowals to, the
