Discussion

‘Where, as here; a. grand.jury subpoena has validly issued, and the'recipicnt of the subpoena,
is not contesting complian¢e—but, rather sécking authorization to comply. with the subpocna—a.
court should. grant such permission. through. Jimited:modification ofian applicable protective order,
absent countervailing interests not: present in this case. As.described below; a court can and. should.
modify ‘a. protective order, on permit. limited relicf from. it, to allow. the recipient, ofa grand. j jury’
‘subpoena ‘to comply with. sucha subpoena under the circumstances presented. here.

The Court is best guided by. the decision. in Chemical Bank v. Affiliated: &M Ins. Co., 154
F.R.D. 9.1 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), which. rejected an. application for a. party .in. civil. litigation to be held.
‘in contempt. for:complying with a grand.jury subpoena despite the’ existence of 'a’protective order,
without first obtaining authorization, from. the court, because the court would have granted such,
authorization. had it been. sought. Chemiéal Bank, 154 F.R.D. at 93. As that court. explained:

The :role of the federal courts.:in. law .enforcement, ‘exemplified. by
the Federal Criminal Code (Title 18, USC) and in enforcing Grand
Jury subpoenas argues, in favor of making significant information
available to énforcément duthoritics absent a countervailing
showing that the iiccd ‘for ‘the, information for such purposes’ is
outweighed. by the need for protecting expectations ‘of
confidentiality under‘Fed. R. Civ. P..26(c).

Id. at 94. (citing United States v. Davis, 702 F.2d 418, 421-22 (2d Cir. 1983) (finding that, the:
“conflict between, protection of ‘private material ‘used in.a civil proceeding and public. nced in. a.
criminal. prosecution?” posed. in that case: was “easily resolved” and. explaining that “[a]bsent.
applicable grounds: ‘for exception, such as a ‘previously: asserted Fifth Amendment privilege, no
shiled:protects the civil cvidence” in that case “from:compellable production before the grand jury’
which subpocnacd it”). The court in-Chemical. Bank chastised the relevant party for responding to
the grand, jury subpoena without authorization specifically because such disregard ‘was “entirely”
unnecessary and inappropriate” * due: to. the readily: available. remedy: ‘of ‘a. modification ‘of the
applicable protective order:, Chemical Bank, 154 F.R.D, at 93. The court also explicitly: noted that:
such formal judicial approval could. be: obtained.-ex parte if sufficient reason. for doing so was
shown. Jd.

Chemical Bank further described the types of:interests that otherwise might be implicated
in. connection with.a Rule 26(c) protective: order, none of which. are implicated here. Jd. at 94
(“There is no indication that any: difficult, balancing. under Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) would have been.
necessary of interests of ‘law enforcement. against protection of technological trade scercts,
currently sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive information which
could benefit rivals, sine no, such information has’ been claimed:to havi been contained in any’ of
the discovery materials in this. case.”) (citations omitted). |

' Notably; here, ‘and in contrast'to, other'cases further described, below, the Government’s specific
knowledge ofthe, subject matter of discovery materials:is relatively limited, duc to the confidential,
nature of the Litigation; however, the: Protective Order itsclf:indicates that discovery materials
