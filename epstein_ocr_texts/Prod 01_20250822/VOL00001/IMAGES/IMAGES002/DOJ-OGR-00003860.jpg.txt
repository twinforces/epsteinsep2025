sought by the subpoenas is not confidential. The government argues, based on the Boies
Schiller response, that the “diary” would be considered confidential. The government’s
hyperbole about the alleged confidential nature of the diary is inaccurate, and in any event,
Boies Schiller is capable or raising confidentiality and requesting a protective order where
applicable. Of course, to the extent any of the information is legitimately confidential, Ms.
Maxwell will not object to an appropriate protective order negotiated between the third party
and Ms. Maxwell and approved by the Court.
VI. Conclusion

The government could easily address the issues raised in its April 5, 2021 letter by
simply obtaining the relevant exculpatory evidence. But it refuses to fairly investigate this
case, and it should not be permitted to interfere with the defense function. Accordingly, the
various requests made in its letter motion should be denied.

Respectfully submitted,
