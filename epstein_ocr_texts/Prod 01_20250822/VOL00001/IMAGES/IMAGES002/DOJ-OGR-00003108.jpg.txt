of proof of the conspiracy and perjury crimes permitted joinder of the offenses . . . and denial of
appellant’s Rule 14 pretrial motion for severance.”); Pizarro, 2018 WL 1737236, at *6-*7.

The defendant argues that the trial on the perjury counts will require a “full-blown re-
litigation of the defamation action.” (Def. Mot. 5 at 9). That is a significant exaggeration. To
litigate the perjury counts, the parties will need to present evidence about the basic substance of
the civil suit—in particular, Giuffre’s allegations and the defendant’s denials—such that the jury
will be able to assess materiality and the statements’ context. This can be done briefly—as stated
in Section V, the Government is amenable to presenting that information through a stipulation—
and, in any event, through minimal additional evidence. The stipulation or other evidence could
be crafted to minimize the risk of spillover prejudice, for instance by referring to Giuffre by a
pseudonym to avoid any connection she might have to testimony on the substantive counts. And
any remaining prejudice could be vitiated by a limiting instruction that the jury should not consider
Giuffre’s allegations as evidence of the substantive counts. See Page, 657 F.3d at 130-31
(approving of similar precautions when introducing evidence of a defendant’s prior felony
conviction); Pizarro, 2018 WL 1737236, at *7; see also Zafiro, 506 U.S. at 540 (“[JJuries are
presumed to follow their instructions.” (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). There is
every reason to think a jury could and would follow such an instruction. See, e.g., Rivera, 546
F.3d at 254 (using a limiting instruction to prevent spillover prejudice for counts involving the
sexual exploitation of different children, especially in light of admissibility across counts); United
States v. Pena, 932 F. Supp. 2d 464, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (using a limiting instruction to address
spillover prejudice from two murder for hire conspiracies). Indeed, even if the counts were
severed, as noted above, the Government would still seek to offer evidence of the defendant’s false
denials of conduct relevant to Counts One through Four as evidence of her consciousness of guilt
