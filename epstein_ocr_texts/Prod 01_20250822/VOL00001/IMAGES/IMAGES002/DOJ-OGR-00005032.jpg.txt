Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 334 Filed 08/13/21 Page3of10
Recipient-1’s original journal for inspection and copying; (3) a pair of black boots that Maxwell
and Jeffrey Epstein allegedly gave to Subpoena Recipient-1; (4) production of the original copies
of certain photographs of Subpoena Recipient-1; and (5) materials related to the Epstein Victim
Compensation Fund. As the Court previously noted, all of these requests fail the Nixon test.

The request for any contingent or engagement agreements fails because Maxwell has not
made the required showing that such records would be relevant or admissible. The only
plausible theory of relevance set forth in Maxwell’s papers is that these documents are necessary
for purposes of impeachment. See Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 2021 Op., at 4-5. The need to
impeach witnesses generally “is insufficient to require [materials’] production in advance of
trial.” Nixon, 418 U.S. at 701. As a result, many courts have held that mere impeachment
material does not become relevant until after the witness testifies. United States v. Skelos, No.
15-CR-317 (KMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. May 17, 2018)), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645
(2d Cir. 2021) (collecting cases). Here, there is no other plausible theory of relevance to these
materials—and Maxwell does not advance any explanation, other than impeachment, as to why
these materials might be relevant under the Nixon test. Lacking any relevance or admissibility,
the request is improper for purposes of Rule 17(c). In any event, there is little risk that review of
these materials, if they become relevant and admissible, will lead to a delay at trial, given their
limited volume. United States v. Seabrook, No. 16-CR-467 (ALC), 2017 WL 4838311, at *2
(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 23, 2017). Ifthe materials become relevant at trial, Maxwell will be able to
procure them at that time.

Maxwell’s request for production of Subpoena Recipient-1’s journal also fails the Nixon
test. As the Court noted in its June 2, 2021 opinion, the original and complete journal is not the
proper subject of a Rule 17(c) subpoena. As already noted, mere impeachment purposes do not
