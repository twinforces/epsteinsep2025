The Government. is unaware of any case: of comparable complexity. and. scope in which.
‘such an,carly deadline has’been set:for witness-rclated disclosures, and the defense has cited none.
Indeed, even in complex white-collar cases in. this District that involve ‘far more complicated. fact
patterns than this case, the Government often provides 3500, material:two wecks prior to trial, and,

ifthe defendants agree to reasonable stipulations, four weeks before trial. See, e.g., United States

prohibits a District. Court from ordering the pretrial ‘disclosure of witness statements.”); Ji re
United.States, 834 F .2d,283, 287 (2d.Cir. 1987), The Government:recognizes that Giglio v» United
States, 405 U. S. 150 (1972), ‘requires disclosure of: any materials that might be used, to impeach,
key’ witnesses “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity to act'upon
the information. cfficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d.2211, 226 (2d Cir. 2007). In.
this District, the time which. is considered to allow for cffective useof the: material is typically
measured. in days or, at.most, wecks,. before: trial. See, e. Z-5 United. States y. Underwood, ‘No. 04
Cr. 424 (RWS), 2005 WL 927012, ‘at #3 (S:D.N:Y: Apr. 2:1, 2005) (Government ordered to produce
Giglio. material two business days before trial); (/nited. States v, Gr cen, No. 04 CR.:424 (RWS),
2004 WL: 2985361, at *3 (S.D.N.¥. Dec. 23, 2004) (noting, “the widely accepted practiec in this
district ‘of producing impeachment material when. ithe Government] provides ‘prior s statements of
