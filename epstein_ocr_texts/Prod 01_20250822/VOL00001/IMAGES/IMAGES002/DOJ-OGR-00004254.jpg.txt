See, e.g., United States v. Kaufman, 19 Cr. 504 (LAK), Dkt. No. 175 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 22, 2021)
(ordering Government disclosure of Jencks Act and Giglio material 2 weeks before trial); United
States v. Cole, 19 Cr. 869 (ER), Dkt. No. 23 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 18, 2020) (ordering disclosure of
Jencks Act and Giglio material 4 weeks before trial); see also United States v. Dupigny, 18 Cr. 528
(JMF) (Government turned over Jencks Act material to the defense approximately one week before
the original trial date in sex trafficking case); United States v. Jones, 16 Cr. 553 (AJN)
(Government turned over Jencks Act material approximately one week before trial); United States
v. Lebedev, 15 Cr. 769 (AJN) (Government turned over Jencks Act material approximately 2 weeks
before scheduled trial date); United States v. Corley, 13 Cr. 48 (RPP) (AJN) (Dkt. Entry, Oct. 10,
2013) (Government turned over Jencks Act material less than one week before trial of defendant
charged with sex trafficking of a minor and possession of child pornography).

The Government is unaware of any case of comparable complexity and scope in which
such an early deadline has been set for witness-related disclosures, and the defense has cited none.
Indeed, even in complex white-collar cases in this District that involve far more complicated fact
patterns than this case, the Government often provides 3500 material two weeks prior to trial, and,
if the defendants agree to reasonable stipulations, four weeks before trial. See, e.g., United States
prohibits a District Court from ordering the pretrial disclosure of witness statements.”); In re
United States, 834 F.2d 283, 287 (2d Cir. 1987). The Government recognizes that Giglio v. United
States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), requires disclosure of any materials that might be used to impeach
key witnesses “in sufficient time that the defendant will have a reasonable opportunity to act upon
the information efficaciously.” United States v. Rodriguez, 496 F.3d 221, 226 (2d Cir. 2007). In
this District, the time which is considered to allow for effective use of the material is typically
measured in days or, at most, weeks, before trial. See, e.g., United States v. Underwood, No. 04
Cr. 424 (RWS), 2005 WL 927012, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 21, 2005) (Government ordered to produce
Giglio material two business days before trial); United States v. Green, No. 04 CR. 424 (RWS),
2004 WL 2985361, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2004) (noting “the widely accepted practice in this
district of producing impeachment material when [the Government] provides prior statements of
a witness pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3500,” and ordering production of Giglio material by Friday
before trial unless materials are voluminous).
