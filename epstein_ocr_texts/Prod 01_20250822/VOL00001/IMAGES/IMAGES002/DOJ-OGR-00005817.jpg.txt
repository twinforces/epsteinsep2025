exhibits, all of which were in the Government’s discovery productions. The Government also
provided the defense with Jencks Act materials for all trial witnesses that same day, including
detailed notes and reports of the Government’s interviews of the witness referenced in the letter.

The defendant now moves to exclude this evidence, arguing, among other things, that the
Government has not provided sufficient notice of the evidence it intends to offer at trial under Rule
404(b). For the reasons set forth below, the defendant’s motion lacks merit, and should be denied.

“arose out of the same transaction or series of transactions as the charged offense,” (b) they are
“inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the charged offense,” or (c) they are
“necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial.” Carboni, 204 F.3d at 44; see also United
States v. Quinones, 511 F.3d 289, 309 (2d Cir. 2007); United States v. Baez, 349 F.3d 90, 93-94
(2d Cir. 2003). In those circumstances, the uncharged crimes evidence is “appropriately treated
