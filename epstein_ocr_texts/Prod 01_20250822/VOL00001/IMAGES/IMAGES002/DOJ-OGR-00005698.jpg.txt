157). By contrast, the Second Circuit found that the government's evidence in-A/-Sadawi was
“foo attenuated” to, establish. that. the defendant. intended to flee to avoid prosecution or
apprehension and‘the government should:not have been permitted to argue ‘consciousness of guilt
on the basis of that evidence: Jd.

Here, the purported “flight” evidence, is even more attenuated than. in A/-Sadawi. Like
Al-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell knew she was a subject of the government’s investigation after the
arrest: of Jeffery Epstcin, and could have left the country: at any‘point in the one-year period
leading up to her arrest (ninc-and-a-half:months longer than Al-Sadawi). But she did not.

Unlike A/-Sadawi, there is no evidence whatsoever that Ms. Maxwell was preparing to flec.
Neither Ms. Maxwell nor her spouse had purchased a'plane ticket, nor was Ms. Maxwell
planning:to move:locations. On the contrary, Ms. Maxwell had. been living in.the same residence
in. New Hampshire, for seven, months:—‘a, location ‘she chose, because it was. close to ‘her family
and close tothe. prosecutors in New Yorkin. case she needed to meet/with them. Moréover,

to abscond. Finally,‘unlike. A/-Sadawi, Ms. Maxwell proffered independent: evidence supporting
an alternative: cxplanation for her actions that: rcbuts. any :inference that she intended to flee.

Hence, ifit-was improper for the trial court to allow the introduction of flight evidence in,
Al-Sadawi, it; would. be even-more improper for the Court to do so here. See id; see. also
