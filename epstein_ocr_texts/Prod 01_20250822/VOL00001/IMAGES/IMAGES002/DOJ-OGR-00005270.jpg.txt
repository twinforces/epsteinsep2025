Voir dire is a critical stage of criminal proceedings, and the public interest in favor of access
to voir dire is correspondingly weighty. United States v. Shkreli, 260 F. Supp. 3d 257, 259-60
(E.D.N.Y. 2017) (“Press coverage of voir dire, no less than coverage of opening statements or the
cross examination of a key witness, contributes to the fairness of trials.”); accord United States v.
Avenatti, 2021 WL 1819679, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 6, 2021). Recognizing that interest, the
Supreme Court has held that the First Amendment requires the voir dire process be presumptively
open to the press and public. Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of California, Riverside Cty., 464
US. 501, 510 (1984).

Juror questionnaires, which are used to facilitate and expedite the jury selection process,
are subject to the same presumption of openness as that which attaches to voir dire generally. See
United States v. King, 140 F.3d 76, 82 (2d Cir. 1998) (including juror questionnaires when
analyzing whether limited closure of voir dire violated public’s right of access); see also Order, In
re The Washington Post, No. 15-1293 (4th Cir. Apr. 27, 2015) (stating that “the public enjoys a
presumptive right of access to voir dire proceedings, including voir dire questionnaires”); /n re
Access to Jury Questionnaires, 37 A.3d 879, 886 (D.C. 2012) (“Every court that has decided the
issue has treated jury questionnaires as part of the voir dire process and thus subject to the
presumption of public access.” (citing Jn re South Carolina Press Ass’n, 946 F.2d 1037, 1041 (4th
Cir. 1991), and collecting other cases)); Stephens Media, LLC v. Eighth Judicial District Court,
221 P.3d 1240, 1245 (Nev. 2009); Forum Commce’ns Co. v. Paulson, 752 N.W.2d 177, 182-83
