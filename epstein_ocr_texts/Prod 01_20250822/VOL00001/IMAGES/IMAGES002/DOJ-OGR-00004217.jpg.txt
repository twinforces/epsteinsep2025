Ghislaine‘Maxwell respectfully:submits this Reply Memorandum:in Support of her
Motion to: Strike Surplusage ‘from the Indictment (“Motion”).

In. its opposition (“Opp.”) to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion, the government concedes it cannot
charge Ms. Maxwell with a:substantive offense against Accuser-3 ' under either 18 U.S.C.
§ 2422(a) of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a). It concedés that any such charge as to Accuser-3 would be
time-barred. (Opp..:164). ‘It.concedes that it cannot show that either Ms. Maxwell. or Jeffrey
Epstein,ever engaged, or sought. to engage, in’unlawful ‘sexual. activity. with, Accuser-3, who at all.
relevant times was above the legal. age. of consent in England, where all alleged activity as to
Accuser-3 occurred. (Opp..162 n.57.) And it concedes that it cannot establish that either Ms.
Maxwell or Epstein ever-caused, or sought,to, cause, Accuser=3. to travel while she was a ‘minor.

Yet;the government argues that Ms. Maxwell and:Epstein’s alleged. lawful interactions
with AccuSser-3 were somehow “part of” and. “in. furtherancé, of” a. conspiracy to entic¢é or cause
underage girls to travel:to engage in-unlawful sexual activity with Epstein. Opp. 161,:163. The
government's argument defies, logic. The government: does ‘not ‘and cannot explain how.
purported lawful, consensual sexual. activity: in-England was pait of an.alleged conspiracy to

[sf revidencerthat the grand jury did not-include:in the Superseding Indictment

(“Indictment”) —does not establish the relevance of those allegations, given the government's

inability to show that Accuser-3[_—
