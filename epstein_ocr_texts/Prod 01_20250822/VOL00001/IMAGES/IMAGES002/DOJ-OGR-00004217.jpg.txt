Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 286 Filed 05/20/21 Page4of14

Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submits this Reply Memorandum in Support of her
Motion to Strike Surplusage from the Indictment (“Motion”).

In its opposition (“Opp.”) to Ms. Maxwell’s Motion, the government concedes it cannot
charge Ms. Maxwell with a substantive offense against Accuser-3' under either 18 U.S.C.

§ 2422(a) or 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a). It concedes that any such charge as to Accuser-3 would be
time-barred. (Opp. 164). It concedes that it cannot show that either Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey
Epstein ever engaged, or sought to engage, in unlawful sexual activity with Accuser-3, who at all
relevant times was above the legal age of consent in England, where all alleged activity as to
Accuser-3 occurred. (Opp. 162 n.57.) And it concedes that it cannot establish that either Ms.
Maxwell or Epstein ever caused, or sought to cause, Accuser-3 to travel while she was a minor.
(Opp. 163 n.58.)

Yet the government argues that Ms. Maxwell and Epstein’s alleged lawful interactions
with Accuser-3 were somehow “part of” and “in furtherance of” a conspiracy to entice or cause
underage girls to travel to engage in unlawful sexual activity with Epstein. Opp. 161, 163. The
government’s argument defies logic. The government does not and cannot explain how
purported lawful, consensual sexual activity in England was part of an alleged conspiracy to
cause minors to travel in the United States. Its eleventh-hour effort to salvage its allegations
regarding Accuser-3 by proffering evidence that she [tis
evidence that the grand jury did not include in the Superseding Indictment
(“Indictment”) —does not establish the relevance of those allegations, given the government’s
inability to show that Accuser-3 ee.

" Accuser-3 is identified in the Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-3.” Similarly, the individuals identified in
the Superseding Indictment as “Minor Victim-1” and “Minor Victim-2” are referred to herein as Accuser-1 and
Accuser-2, respectively.
