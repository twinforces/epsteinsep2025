twelve months, ‘with ‘six ‘served in, home confinement, to run
consecutively:

I just received an c-mail asking if Mr. Epstein could just do 12
months. imprisonment instead.

As you can,sec, Mr. Epstein is having sceond;thoughts about doing
jail time. I'would, like to send Jay Lefkowitz an c-mail. stating: that
if we. do ‘not have a. signed agrecmicnt by tomorrow at 5:00,
negotiations will end. Ihave selected tomorrow at 5:00 because’ it
gives them, enough, time to.really negotiate an.agreement if they are
serious, about ‘it, and if-not, it gives me one day before 'the Jewish
holiday | to get [prepared] for cues _ [September 1 when I

the indictment package.
Do you. concur?

A few minutes later, the. incoming West Palm. Beach, manager cmailed Lourie, suggesting ‘that.
‘Lourie “talk to‘Epstcin and.close the deal.”!'*

Within moments, Louric replied.to'the manager, with a copy’to Villafafia, reporting that he
had just spoken with Lefkowitz and agreed “to. two fed[éral] obstruction[] charges (24 month cap)
with nonbinding-recommendation for 1.8 months. When. [Epstein] gets out, he-has to plead to state
offenses, including against minor, registrable, and then. take onc ycar house arrest/community
confinement.” ‘By reply‘email, Villafafia asked ‘Louric to.call her, but there is no record-of whether
they spoke:

F. Defense Counsel. Offers New Proposals Substantially Changing the Terms of
the Federal, Plea.Agreement, which, the USAO: Rejects

Approximately an hour after Louric’s. email, reporting the deal, he had. reached with,
Lefkowitz, Lefkowitz sent, Villafana a revised.draft:plea:agreement. Despite the agreement.Louric¢
believed he. and. Lefkowitz had reached that’ morning, Lefkowit7"s proposal, would have resulted
in.a 16-month federal ‘sentence followed by 8 months of supervised release: served. in the: form. of
home detention. Lefkowitz also inserted. a:statement in his proposal, ‘explicitly: prohibiting: the
USAO from requesting, initiating, or encouraging immigration authoritics to institute immigration,
proceedings against two of Epstcin’s, female assistants.

Villafafia. circulated. the defense’s proposed plea agreement to Louric and two other
supervisors, and expressed frustration that the new defense version incorporated. terms that: were:
“completely different. from what Jay just told Andy they would agree to.” Villafafa also pointed,
out that:the defense “wants us to: recommend an.improper‘calculation” of the sentencing: guidelines

8 The-manager told OPR that heprobably meant this as a joke because) inhis view the continued back-and-
forth. communications with. defense counsel, “was ridiculous,” and the only way. to: “get this deal. done’ might be: to
haye a direct conversation with Epstein.
