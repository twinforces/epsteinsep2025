would-mandate‘a.continuance. Ms. Maxwell must ‘now: scarch, various records (to the extent they
are available) and track down. numerous witnesses to determine her locations and. activities
during this. expanded period. She must also identify employees. who worked, for Mr. Epstein
during this time period to determine the scope of their knowledge: about the allegations. These.
are time consuming. and. difficult tasks and Ms. Maxwell respectfully submits that denial, of.a
‘continuance under these circumstances would constitute an, abuse of diserction.

In United States v. Guzman, 754 F.2d,482. 486 (2d. Cir: 1985), the Second Circuit:
reversed the defendant’s: conspiracy :conviction, noting’ that:

[W]c cannot agree with the government's contentions that the changes in
Guzman's superseding indictment. were) insubstantial and, that ‘Guzman ‘was

would offer ‘no, new. evidence at: the second trial, Guzman, was entitled to the

‘Second Circuit found that the refusal, to grant. a continuance was an abuse of discretion.. ‘By:

contrast; the denial of a continuance may. be upheld:in casés where the changes to the indictment
