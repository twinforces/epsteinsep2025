ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday’s conference, the Court will implement
the following procedures for jury selection:

e A screening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and 12.

e The Clerk’s Office will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror
numbers. The list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury
selection. Jurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the
process by their assigned number only.

e Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed to defense counsel by the U.S.
Attorney’s Office.

e After reviewing the completed questionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and
jointly submit four lists: (1) prospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to
voir dire; (2) prospective jurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective
jurors that the defense, but not the Government believes should be excused; and (4)
prospective jurors that the Government, but not the defense believes should be excused.
