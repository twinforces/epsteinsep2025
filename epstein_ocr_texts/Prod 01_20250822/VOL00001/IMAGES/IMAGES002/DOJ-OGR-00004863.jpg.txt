Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 310-1 Filed 07/02/21 Page 51 of 80
Cosby was not a formal attempt to bestow transactional immunity upon Cosby is
supported by the record.

The trial court’s description of former D.A. Castor’s testimony as inconsistent and
equivocal finds support in the record as well. At times, the former district attorney was
emphatic that he intended his decision not to prosecute Cosby to bind the Commonwealth
permanently, provided no substantive changes occurred in the case, such as Cosby
confessing to the alleged crimes or proof appearing that Cosby had lied to, or attempted
to deceive, the investigators. In addition to the unconditional nature of the press release,
former D.A. Castor told then-District Attorney Ferman in his first email to her that he
“intentionally and specifically bound the Commonwealth that there would be no state
prosecution.” N.T., 2/2/2016, Exh. D-5. In his second email to D.A. Ferman, Mr. Castor
asserted that, by “signing off on the press release, he was “stating that the
Commonwealth will not bring a case against Cosby for this incident based upon then-
available evidence.” /d., Exh. D-7.

Further indicative of his intent to forever preclude prosecution of Cosby for the
2004 incident, former D.A. Castor testified that the signed press release was meant to
serve as proof for a future civil judge that Cosby would not be prosecuted, thus stripping
Cosby of his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Mr. Castor emphasized that his decision
was “absolute that [Cosby] never would be prosecuted.” T.C.O. at 52. The former district
attorney stressed that his intent was to “absolutely” remove “for all time” the prospect of
a prosecution, because, in his view, only a steadfast guarantee would permanently strip
Cosby of his right to invoke the Fifth Amendment. N.T., 2/2/2016, at 67. Mr. Castor also
expounded upon the purpose of his emails to D.A. Ferman, which he claimed were an
attempt to inform her that, while he bound the Commonwealth with regard to the 2004
incident, she was free to prosecute Cosby for any other crimes that she might uncover.
