young as twelve) to the United States for sexual purposes and farm them out to his friends,
especially Epstein. Brunel would offer the girls “modeling” jobs. Many of the girls came from
poor countries or impoverished backgrounds, and he lured them in with a promise of making
good money. Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to observe him, Brunel and Maxwell engage in illegal
sexual acts with dozens of underage girls. Epstein also forced Jane Doe #3 to have sex with
Brunel on numerous occasions, at places including Epstein’s mansion in West Palm Beach, Little
St. James Island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (many including orgies that were comprised of other
underage girls), New York City, New Mexico, Paris, the south of France, and California.

Epstein also trafficked Jane Doe #3 for sexual purposes to many other powerful men,
including numerous prominent American politicians, powerful business executives, foreign
presidents, a well-known Prime Minister, and other world leaders. Epstein required Jane Doe #3
to describe the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail them.

The Government was well aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it
listed her as a victim in the attachment to the NPA. Moreover, even a rudimentary investigation
of Jane Doe #3’s relationship to Epstein would have revealed the fact that she had been
trafficked throughout the United States and internationally for sexual purposes. Nonetheless, the
Government secretly negotiated a non-prosecution agreement with Epstein precluding any
Federal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida of Epstein and his co-conspirators. As
with Jane Doe #1, and Jane Doe #2, the Government concealed the non-prosecution agreement
from Jane Doe #3 — all in violation of her rights under the CVRA — to avoid Jane Doe #3 from
raising powerful objections to the NPA that would have shed tremendous public light on Epstein
