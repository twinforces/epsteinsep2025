Judge McMahon “returned” to that point. when. discussing whether Maxwell could have
‘reasonably relied. on. the Protective Order:

[T]he only thing on which Maxwell. or anyone clse might reasonably haye relied is
that Giuffte. or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank
did—that is, forward discovery: materials in’ their possession, to: prosecutors for the:
purpose ‘of fomenting an investigation. But I am not faced with that ‘situation.
Nothing in this tecord suggests to me that Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything ‘to.
do-with the Government’s decision to convene a.grand jury’to look: into-the matters
that were the subject of the Giuffre Action. On the contrary—the Government has:
advised the Court; that it; contacted, Boies, Schiller as part of its search, for partics
who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller: told the:
Government that it could not. consensually: ‘produce at: least some: documents in its
files ‘because of the :existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of

“collusion,” to invoke a term of the moment, and it:is quite clear that Boies Schiller
did. ‘not foment the Government’s investigation. Moreover, the Assistant United
States Attorney has. represented to this ‘Court that.he has no idca what iIs.:in, Boics
Schiller’s files, and that for all he knows every witness who was, deposed stood on
his/her.Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions.

Id. at:21.

Gontrary' to Judge McMahon’s understanding, Boies Schiller contactéd the governnient
(not the other way around); there was ample evidence of “collusion”; it-was “quite clear ‘that
Boics Schiller, did’. . .. foment the Government’s investigation”; and AUSA [_] knew
much more about-what was in Boies. Schiller’s files than he Jet on.

The Chemical Bank situation Judge McMahon was worried about— when civil litigant
attempts to foment a criminal ‘investigation of her opponents. cxactly. what occurred.

Judge McMahon cannot be faulted ‘for not.knowing all. the facts. AUSA[—___],. on
the other hand, had,a “complete handle on the'landscape,” and,he withheld. the truth ftom, Judge
McMahon. Had AUSAL___] not misled-her, it is.clear Judge McMahon’would not have,

authorized the subpoena,”!

*1 It’s notable that even'without the bénefit-of truth from, AUSA [——_], Judge MeMahon,
wrongly concluded that Maxwell. could not-haye reasonably relied. onthe Protective Order; In fact, the
