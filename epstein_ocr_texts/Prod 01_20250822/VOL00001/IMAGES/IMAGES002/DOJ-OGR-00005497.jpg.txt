ES With Epstcin dead, the
media focus shifted immediately to Ms. Maxwell who was vilified as Epstein’s principal
accomplice. In addition, Epstein’s accusers were extremely upset, having been denied the
opportunity to see Epstein face the allegations against him in open court. Then-Attorney General
William Barr publicly vowed that “[a]ny co-conspirators should not rest easy. The victims
deserve justice, and we will ensure they get it.”*! Thereafter, in announcing the arrest of
Ghislaine Maxwell at a choreographed press conference on July 2, 2020, Acting United States
Attorney Audrey Strauss boldly announced: “This case against Ghislaine Maxwell is the prequel
to the earlier case we brought against Jeffrey Epstein.” See https://youtu.be/hGAsZthBKCE.

The defense is entitled to elicit this evidence, as well as evidence of the public outcry and
media scrutiny that followed the Miami Herald articles and Epstein’s death, to argue that the
government initially focused the New York investigation on Epstein and charged only him in the
initial July 2, 2019 indictment in order to rectify the perceived injustice that the NPA was a
“sweetheart deal” for Epstein. When Epstein died, however, the government had to scramble to
quickly build a case against his purported co-conspirators, including Ms. Maxwell. The defense
is further entitled to argue that the public pressure to charge Epstein’s co-conspirators and the
attendant focus on Ms. Maxwell caused the government to engage in a hasty and sloppy
investigation in which they ignored inconsistencies in the evidence, accepted the witness’
statements at face value without testing them or verifying them with corroborating evidence, and
generally exhibited a “remarkably uncritical attitude” to the evidence against Ms. Maxwell.
