OO With Epstein dead, the
media focus shifted. inimediately to, Ms. Maxwell who was vilified as Epstein’s principal
accomplice. In addition, Epstcin”s accusers were extremely-upset, having been.denied. the
opportunity to see Epstein face the ‘allegations against him,in open.court. Then-Attorney Gencral
William Barr publicly vowed that “[a]ny' co-conspirators. should notrest casy. The victims
