2:1, 2021 Order, Dkt. No. 221, under temporary scal with proposed:redactions. The proposed.
redactions are GRANTED. The Court’s coniclusion.is guided by'the, threc-part'test articulated by
the Second Circuit in. Lugesch vy. Pyramid Go. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d. 1,10 (2d-Cir. 2006). Under
‘this, test, the Court: musts (1) determine whether the; documents in question are: “judicial
documents,” (ii) assess the-weight of the common. law presumption of-access to the materials,
and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Jd, at 119-20. The
Court concludés that these. are judicial documents and; that the First Amendment and common
law presumptions of. access attach.

Couirt finds that the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy’ interests of
defense lawyers’ clients:in other matters and to allow defense: counsel to comply with their
professional obligations ‘under the rules of professional conduct.
