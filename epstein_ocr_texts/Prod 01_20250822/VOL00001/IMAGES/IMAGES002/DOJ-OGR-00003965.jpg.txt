Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
On April 22, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed her response to the Court’s April
21, 2021 Order, Dkt. No. 221, under temporary seal with proposed redactions. The proposed
redactions are GRANTED. The Court’s conclusion is guided by the three-part test articulated by
the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under
this test, the Court must: (1) determine whether the documents in question are “judicial
documents;” (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials;
and (ii1) balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. /d. at 119-20. The
Court concludes that these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common
law presumptions of access attach.
In balancing competing considerations against the presumption of access, however, the
Court finds that the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of
defense lawyers’ clients in other matters and to allow defense counsel to comply with their
professional obligations under the rules of professional conduct.
The Defendant is ORDERED to docket the redacted version of her letter by April 23,
2021. The Defendant is further ORDERED to docket the basis for the redaction request,
originally sent by email, on ECF by April 23, 2021.
