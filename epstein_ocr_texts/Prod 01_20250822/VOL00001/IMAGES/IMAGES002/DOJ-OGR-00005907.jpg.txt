296 — S. Craven et al.

Offenders frequently make the child feel responsible for the abuse (Leberg, 1997; van
Dam, 2001; Warner, 2000). They convince the child that they are to blame for letting the
abuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg, 1997). This is reinforced by
stereotypes in society, which emphasize that men cannot control their sex drive (Warner,
2000). Additional guilt may be felt if the child has been made to perform sexual acts on the
abuser or another child (Warner, 2000). However, this feeling of responsibility and guilt is
overshadowed by the self-betrayal the child feels as their body reacts to sexual stimulation
against their will (Warner, 2000) which children may interpret as evidence that they are
enjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly may have an impact on the child’s
developing identity. Disclosure is avoided because the child feels that it is “all their fault’’, that
he/she is bad and that no one will believe them (Warner, 2000).

Each victim’s experience of grooming is different, because offenders adapt their strategies
dependent on the child, whose response during the grooming process is important. It seems
reasonable to suggest that offenders require some level of “empathy” during the grooming
process to recognize reactions in the child, so that they can adapt their strategy accordingly.
For example, during the desensitization process an offender would need to recognize the
limits of the victim and to strategically increase those limits. It is proposed that empathy
involves four components: (1) emotion recognition; (2) perspective-taking; (3) emotion
replication; and (4) response decision (Marshall, Hudson, Jones & Fernandez, 1995).
Continuing with the previous example, offenders recognize the distress in their victim and
make a decision based on this, because they choose to stop temporarily as a strategic part of
the desensitization process. Thus, offenders appear to have ability in components (1) and (4),
which are the cognitive components, but not in the affective components (2) and (3). While
early research on empathy in sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more
recent research has found that this empathy deficit to be victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,
Lightbody & O’Sullivan, 1999; Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 2001; Marshall et al.,
1995). This is inconsistent with the suggestion that the grooming process requires some level
of empathy. However, Fernandez et al. (1999; Marshall et al., 2001) provide a possible
explanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy deficits manifest as cognitive
distortions, which protect the offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, thus allowing
them to continue abusing a child. Based on this suggestion, victim-specific empathy deficits
arise as a consequence rather than a cause of the abuse. These cognitive distortions therefore
facilitate self-grooming.

The manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating to a victim-specific empathy deficit
may be facilitated by cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive deconstruction (see Ward, Hudson
& Marshall, 1995) is a state entered into to escape negative experiences and negative self-
evaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves processing at a lower, more concrete, level, i.e.
muscular movements, and rewards of behaviour, rather than social action. Resultantly, the
individual has much more focus on feelings of pleasure and less awareness of the
consequences of his behaviour. This concrete-level focus may reinforce cognitive distortions
such as victims enjoyed the abuse because they became physically aroused, which justifies the
offender’s lack of empathy toward their victim.

Self grooming, grooming the environment and significant others, and grooming the child
are relevant to situational and preferential offenders, extra-familial and intrafamilial offences.
It is important that the different types of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies
and classifications of offenders because sexual grooming is not used solely by one group of
offenders and, furthermore, these categories are not mutually exclusive (Itzin, 2001).
