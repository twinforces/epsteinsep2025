proof that this:led to the breakfast meeting, cmail exchanges’ between Lefkowitz and Acosta show:
that it was undcr discussion, at the time they were scheduling the mceting. Shortly ‘aftcr the
breakfast: meetings Sloman, in.Miami, ‘scnt,an email to Lefkowitz (copying Acosta.and Villafafia),

noting that he “just got. off'the phone with, Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the
addendum relating to the mechanism. for selection of. the attorney::representative. Sloman later
clarified. for’Villafafia that “Jay’s'suggested-revision has been, rejected.”

A second area of continuing negotiation arosc from the defense claim that. Epstcin’s
obligation under the NPA to ‘pay the attorncyrepresentative’s fees did not obligate him to: ‘pay the
fecs.and costs.of contested litigation filed-against-him. Although this:was:at odds with the. USAO’s
interpretation ofthe: provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and: clarified the:
provision in the NPA. addendum, that was finalized several weeks ‘after the October breakfast:
mecting. Although the revised provision ‘was to, Epstein’s: advantage, ‘the ‘revision concerned.
attorney’s fees and, did, not materially impede the victims’ ability to séck damages from Epstcin
under § 2255. ‘The fact.that:the negotiations continucd after the breakfast mecting indicates that.
Acosta did. not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.

OPR. found limited contemporancous evidence concerning the discussion between .Acosta,
and. Lefkowitz. In a letter sent. to. Acosta on October 23, 2007, two. weeks after the breakfast.
meeting, Lefkowitz represented that Acosta made'three significant concessions during the:mecting.
Specifically, Lefkowitz claimed. that Acosta. had. agreed. (1) not. to intervene with the State
Attorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact.any of the victim-witnesses or their
counsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta, told OPR. that.
he: did, not. remember the breakfast mecting arid did not recall making the commitments defense
counsel. attributed ‘to him. Acosta. also.'told OPR that Lefkowitz was. not a reliable narrator of
events, and. on several ‘occasions in. written communications had inaccurately.and misleadingly.
characterized conversations he‘had with Acosta. |

Of more significance for OPR’s cvaluation was a, contemporaneous document=an
October.25, 2007 draft response to Lefkowitz’s letter, which Sloman:drafted, and.Acosta reviewed
and. edited for-signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkowitz’s claims. The draft letter stated:

I specifically want to clarify one of the items 'that I believe was
inaccurate ‘in, that; October 23rd letter. Your letter claimed that this
Office

‘would not intervene with, the State: Attorncy’s Office
regarding this matter; or contact any of the identified
‘individuals, potential. witnesses, or ‘potential. civil
‘claimants and their: respective counsel in.this matter;
and neither your Office nor the [FBI] would
intervene regarding’ the sentence Mr. Epstein

reccives pursuant, to a’plea, with the State, so long as
that sentence docs ‘not violate state law.

As we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States
Attorney’ previously explained in, an, carlier conference call, such a
