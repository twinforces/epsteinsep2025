1 she can see somebody.

2 I also neglected to mention that I would ask the Court
3 to strongly suggest to the Bureau of Prisons that Ms. Days be

4 allowed to continue with any of her drug treatment. She's

5 taking drug treatment programs, as well as any vocational or

6 educational programs that she is allowed to participate in. I
7 think it will only help. She is going to try to get into any

8 program she can as much as she can, but â€”-

9 THE COURT: It is my recommendation that she be

10 incarcerated at Danbury, but as close as possible to the

11 New York City Metropolitan area in order to have facilitate

12 family visitation, which as a result of the pandemic, she has
13 been denied for over a year.

14 It's my recommendation that Ms. Days be considered for
15 the RDAP program. It's my recommendation that Ms. Days be

16 given continuing drug treatment, and as Ms. Days has proven

17 that she is someone who benefits from coursework and from being
18 put in a position to assist other inmates, it is my hope that
19 the Bureau of Prisons will take note of that and make sure that
20 she has plenty to do, both education-wise and mentoring-wise.
21 MR. DONALDSON: Thank you.
22 THE COURT: Ms. Days, when you are released, you will
23 have 72 hours to report to a United States probation officer
24 here at the courthouse on the sixth floor, and for four years
25 you'll meet on a regular basis with your probation officer.
