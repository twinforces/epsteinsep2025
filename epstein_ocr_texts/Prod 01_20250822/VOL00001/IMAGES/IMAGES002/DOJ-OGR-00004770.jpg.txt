she Carn Ssée somebody.

I also neglected to mention that I would ask the Court
to strongly suggest to the Buréau of Prisons that Ms. Days be
allowed to continue with any of her drug treatment. She's
taking drug treatment programs, aS well aS any vocational or
educational programs that she is allowed to participate in, I
think @t will only help. She is going to try to get into any
program she can as much as she can, but --

THE COURT: Tt 48 my recommendation that she be
incarcerated at Danbury, but as close as possible to the

New York Gity Metropolitan aréa in order to have facilitate
family visitation, which as a mesult, of the pandemic, she has
been denied for over a year.

It's my recommendation that, Ms. Days be considered, for
the RDAP program. It's my recommendation that Ms. Days be
given. continuing drug treatment, and as Ms. Days has proven
that she is sémeone who benefits from coursework and from being
put in, a position ‘to assist other inmates, it is my hope that
the Bureau of Prisons will take néte 6f that and maké Sure that
she has plenty to do, both education-wise and mentoring-wise.

MR. DONALDSON: Thank you.

THE COURT: (Ms. Days, when you are released, ‘you will
have 72 héurs. to report té a United States prébation officer
here at the courthouse on the sixth floor, and for four years.
you'll meet on. a regular basis with your probation, officer.
