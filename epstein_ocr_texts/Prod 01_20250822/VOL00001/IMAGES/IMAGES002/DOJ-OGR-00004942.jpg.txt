To Be Filed. Under Seal

while the Protective Order also had a-permanent aspect.about it—i.e., it provides for the return or
destruction of documents upon conclusion, of the.case (see Protective Order J 12)—this:provision:
neither trumped the law’ concerning the public’s right of access to materials filed in court, nor
specifically required the designating: patty to maintain confidentiality over its own designated
materials once the:Protective Order expired. (See id.)

Of course, this casé contains an unusual fact that might seem to render’Maxwell’s
reliance on a.blanket Protective Order reasonable, as against: even disclosure:pursuant to a grand
jury subpoena. We know that Maxwell refused.to agree to any Protective Order containing:a
provision that is: customary in all the protective: orders entered, by this Court: a-provision,

the court. (See Def.’s.Reply in Further Supp. of Mot. for Protective Order, 15-cy-7433, Dkt. No.
49 at 5.) This might seem.ironic, since Maxwell argued, in support of.her motion for entry ofa.
protective order, that.prosecution of anyone based on Giuffre’s allegations was unlikely. (Id.)
But whether prosecution seemed likely or not, Maxwell did.indeed. bargain for such a provision;
and.for whatever-reason, Giuffré and Boies Schiller agreed to it.

the court’to. order'disclosure of Confidential Material ‘in circumstances other. than those listed in
Paragraph $ (a)-(h). See Protective Order J 5. (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not,
without the consent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed|.]”)
(emphasis.added), All the list of exceptions at subparagraphs 5(a) through (h) does is indicate
when there is:no need. forthe opponent’s consent or a-court order before disclosure can be ‘made.
As the Protective Order plainly gives the court.the power to enter an. order:compelling disclosure

to anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could:not reasonably have relied.on the
