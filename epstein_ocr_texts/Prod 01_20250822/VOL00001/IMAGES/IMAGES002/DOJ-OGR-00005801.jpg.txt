That point is particularly true in sex trafficking cases. As Judge Engelmayer explained
when evaluating the testimony of a similar expert in a sex trafficking case, analyzing error rates is
an “unusually poor fit” in this area:

[S]tudying the circumstances and psychological drivers of trafficked

women is not like studying diseases or potential cures in laboratory

animals. . . . Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a

study, given the small size of the populations under review, and

given the inherently individualized circumstances presented by

different perpetrators, victims, and contexts in this tumultuous and

emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the vocabulary of

error rates . . . is an unusually poor fit... . The testing that has been

done as to trauma bonding and coercive control, instead, necessarily

uses more qualitative research methodologies. These involve

interviews and case studies and clinical examinations conducted

over time.”

research like Dr. Rocchio’s, statistical tools like error rates are irrelevant to the Daubert analysis.

Contrary to the defendant’s next claim, these opinions are not “impregnable for purposes
of cross examination.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 7 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). The
defendant is free to cross Dr. Rocchio on how frequently she sees grooming in her patients and
how she evaluates whether they are telling the truth. The defendant is also free to explore, in cross
examination, the difficulties in assessing whether a patient has been groomed. The defense can
also make arguments—in cross examination and in jury addresses—about the lack of quantitative
rigor in this qualitative area of science. That is the point: it is for the jury, after hearing the
