Government's Position

For the reasons set forth below, the Government respectfully requests that the Court set the
remaining schedule consistent with the Government’s proposals. In particular, the Government
makes the following proposals:
Identities of the Victims

The Government will provide the defense with the identities of the victims referenced in
the S2 Indictment by September 13, 2021, or 11 weeks in advance of trial. The Government
understands that the defense requests that the Government disclose the identities of the victims
immediately. The Government notes that the parties previously agreed, and the Court ordered,
that the Government would provide the defense with the identities of the victims 8 weeks before
trial, on May 17, 2021, assuming trial were to begin as scheduled on July 12, 2021. (Dkt. No. 229,
250). The Government’s proposal would provide the defense with the victims’ identities
substantially in advance of trial. See, e.g., United States v. Kee, No. 98 Cr. 778 (DLC), 2000 WL
760096, at *1-*2 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. June 12, 2000) (requiring Government to disclose identities of
victims approximately 45 days in advance of trial).
The Government’s Proposed Witness List, Giglio Material, Jencks Act Material, and Rule 404(b)
Notice

The Government is prepared—consistent with the Court’s April 26, 2021 Order (Dkt. No.
250) to produce a proposed witness list, Giglio material, Jencks Act material, and notice pursuant

DOJ-OGR-00004252
