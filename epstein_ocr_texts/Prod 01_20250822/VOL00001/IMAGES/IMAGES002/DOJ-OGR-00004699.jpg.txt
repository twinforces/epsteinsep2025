2. | I am the Assistant United States Attorney assigned to the investigation of
: Jeffrey Epstein. The case was investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”).
The federal investigation was initiated in 2006 at the request of the Palm Beach Police
Department (“PBPD”) into allegations that Jeffrey Epstein and his personal assistants had
used facilities of interstate commerce to induce young girls between the ages of thirteen and
seventeen to engage in prostitution, amongst other offenses.

3. Throughout the investigation, when a victim was identified, victim notification
letters were provided to her both from your Affiant and from the FBI's Victim-Witness
Specialist. Attached hereto are copies of the letters provided to Bradley Edwards’ three

clients, T.M., C.W., and S.R.' Your Affiant’s letter to C.W. was provided by the FBI. (Ex.
1). Your Affiant’s letter to T.M, was hand-delivered by myself to T.M. at the time that she
was interviewed (Ex. 2).? Both C.W. and T.M. also received letters from the FBI's Victim-
Witness Specialist, which were sent on January 10, 2008 (Exs. 3 & 4). S.R. was identified
\ via the FBI’s investigation in 2007, but she initially refused to speak with investigators.
S.R.’s status as a victim of a federal offense was confirmed when she was interviewed by
i a
‘Attorney Edwards filed his Motion on behalf of “Jane Doe,” without identifying which of
his clients is the purported victim. Accordingly, I will address facts related to C.W., T.M., and S.R.
' All three of those clients were victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s while they were minors beginning when
; they were fifteen years old.
| ?Please note thal the dates on the U.S. Attorney's Office letters to C.W. and T.M. are not the
dates that the letters were actually delivered. Letters to all known victims were prepared early in the
| investigation and delivered as each victim was contacted.
