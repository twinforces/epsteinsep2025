The Government respectfully submits that Exhibits C, E, F, G, H, and I should be filed
entirely under seal in order to protect the privacy interests of victims and third parties implicated
in the documents. The Court has accepted similar exhibits under seal in this case to protect such
privacy interests. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 168, 232).
Respectfully submitted,

Ce: Def | (By ECF
o: Delense sounsel (By ) The Court grants in part the Governmentâ€™s redaction and
sealing requests. Its conclusion is guided by the three-part test
articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).
The Court concludes that these are judicial documents and that
the First Amendment and common law presumptions of access
attach. Jd. at 119-20. In balancing competing considerations
against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the
arguments the Government has put forward in this letter,
including the need to protect the privacy interests of third
parties and alleged victims, favor the narrowly tailored
redactions. See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050
er (2d Cir. 1995). Similarly, the Court concludes that the
Government has shown that Exhibits E, F, G, H, and I should
A I. Wie be filed under seal.
. With respect to Exhibit C, however, the Court concludes that
S60 ORDERED, narrowly tailored redactions are sufficient to advance the

privacy interests the Government has identified. Accordingly,
the Government is ORDERED to confer with defense counsel
and submit proposed redactions to Exhibit C by May 20, 2021.
SO ORDERED.
