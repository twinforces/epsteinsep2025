Sophia-
Your accusation is inaccurate as is the information reported to you by your staff. Nothing in Ms. Maxwell ‘s legal papers was given to
her by me or by Leah Saffian, Esq. Both Ms. Saffian and | dispute these allegations in the strongest terms.
Today, Ms. Saffian and | met with Ghislaine Maxwell for a scheduled legal visit- under the gaze of 5 guards and a portable camera
recording audio and video.
After the legal visit concluded and Ms. Saffian and I left the visiting area, guards accused Ms. Maxwell of possessing documents
obtained from counsel. The guards seized confidential documents from her, including documents she had previously received in legal
mail delivered to the MDC and given to her by MDC staff. After seizing “highly confidential” documents (subject to a protective order
that your staff is not authorized to review) and work product, the guards began reading the documents and have not returned them to
Ms. Maxwell.
At no time did the guards, who were assiduously watching and filming the legal conference, bring any concern to my attention, so it is
quite telling that you have been contacted when counsel are told that legal staff are unavailable during the weekend.
No documents were given to Ms.
Maxwell for her retention. Demand is hereby made for an immediate identification of the documents you claim were not in Ms.
Maxwell’s possession upon entering the legal visiting area in advance of the arrival of counsel, a list of all guards present during the
visit, and a copy of the video recording.
Please immediately return the confiscated legal documents to Ms. Maxwell. They are her documents, not mine. The confiscation of
these documents has deprived Ms. Maxwell of her time and seriously impaired her ability to review legal documents and prepare for
an upcoming trial, adding to an already difficult situation.
This matter is being reported to the Court and legal action will be initiated.
Regarding tomorrow- | have recieved 15 different confirmations and cancellations regarding the scheduled visit for tomorrow, which
will be attended by Ms. Saffian alone.
lam sorting through these emails to determine what time period is permitted for tomorrow’s visit.

Good afternoon Bobbi:
It had been brought to my attention by the staff of MDC Brooklyn that Ms. Maxwell received paperwork that was not in her
possession upon entering the legal visiting area. As you are aware, the policies set forth for MDC Brooklyn legal visits do not allow
for passing of any material during a legal visit. Due to our policy and procedures, the additional documents that were provided to
Ms. Maxwell were confiscated. Those materials were put in an envelope and will be returned to you tomorrow upon your arrival to
EXHIBIT B
DOJ-OGR-00004023
