about, numerous witness interviews they, conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents
they obtained, by subpoena,” and, their activities before the grand jury. (Ex..A at 1-2).

But. as set forth. above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior :investigation is
irrelevant; hearsay’ that would. only serve, ‘to confuse ‘the jury. Evidenee about; the “scope,”
“timeline,” or “various investigative. steps taken by ‘the. agents” is similarly irrelevant and.
the jury.swecping conclusions, about: the: Florida Investigations or this onc.” ‘The bases identified
for. their testimony: are impropcr,, and the ‘Court should preclude them unless the defense:
‘identifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.

IV. The Court Should Préclude Evidence. or Argunvent About the Governmeiit’s
Alleged Motives for Prosecution

As the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted. as a.
scapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g.. Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. ‘142, at 1 (“[T]he
government has sought to substitute our client.for Jeffrey Epstein... . .”)). That claim is as false
‘asit-is. offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives. for prosecution are irrelevant; to

the question of the defendant’s ‘factual guilt that will be before ‘the. jury at trial, atid. any probative

” Furthermore, the proffered. bases for the case agents’ testimony’ will. ‘likely run, afoul, of
numerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s :case:.agents, cannot testify to the substance, of
“numerous ‘witness interviews ‘they conducted” with. uncalled witnesses, which. is hearsay. The:
agents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that
govern prior consistent or inconsistent ‘statements. And. there 1 1S significant risk that case agent
about: information ‘their investigations “gencrated. about the defendant would, likely yield hearsay
responses and. would open the door’to, agents, offering other information that-is inculpatory’to, the
defendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.
