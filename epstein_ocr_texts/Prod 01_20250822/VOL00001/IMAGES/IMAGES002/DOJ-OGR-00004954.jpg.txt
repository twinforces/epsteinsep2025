representing any party or witness to the case. Their position on the applicability of Rule 23.1
apparently fluctuates depending on who is talking to the press.

Accordingly, we would ask the Court to be mindful of two important points. First, Ms.
Maxwell has been, and continues to be, the subject of an unquestionable tsunami of adverse
publicity every day, which is surely impacting the pool of jurors in the Southern District of New
York. Second, efforts to persuade the public and the government that a defendant should not be
prosecuted are permissible. See Gentile v. State Bar of Nevada, 501 U.S. 1030, 1043 (1991) (“A
defense attorney may pursue lawful strategies to obtain dismissal of an indictment or reduction
of charges, including an attempt to demonstrate in the court of public opinion that the client does
not deserve to be tried.”).

Respectfully submitted:
