representing any ‘party: or’witness to the case. Their position, on, the applicability of Rule 23.1
apparently fluctuates depending on-who is:talking’to the press.

Accordingly, we would.ask the Court. to be mindful of two important points. First, Ms.
Maxwell has been, and.continucs to be, the subject of an unquestionable'tsunami of adverse
publicity every day, which.is surely impacting,the pool. of jurors in the Southern District:of New
York. Second, efforts to persuade the public and the government that a defendant should not be
prosecuted are permissible. See Gentile.v. Staté Bar of Nevada, 501. U.S. 1030, 1043 (1991) (A.
defense attorney may pursue: lawful strategies to. obtain dismissal, of an indictment‘or reduction
of charges, including an attempt to demonstrate in the court. of:public: opinion that.the client does
not deserve to be tried.”).
