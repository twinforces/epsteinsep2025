time period.from 2001-2004. The counts do not'specify, however, the dates that, any. of this
alleged conduct occurred. For example, the S2 Indictment .does not specify when.Ms. Maxwell
“interacted” with.Accuser-4 or allegedly “recruited” her “to engage in sex.acts with Epstein” or
“enticed?” her “to recruit other girls to engage in paid.sex acts:with Epstein.” (S2.Indictment-44
9d, 25a, 25b). Nor doés the S2 Indictiment specify when Ms. Maxwell allegedly paid. Accuser-4
‘or. sent‘her gifts: or called herto schedule massage appointments, (Id. {9 9d,.25c, 25d). A Bill of
Particulars for Counts. Five‘and. Six: is'therefore necessary and appropriate. See Borinovsky, 820
F.2d at'575 (Bill of Particulars warrarited’where “[t]hé-rélevancé of Key’ events was shrouded. in
mystery: at the commencement of and throughoutthe trial’). Jd, at 575.

Furthermore, ‘as discussed above, Ms. Maxwell has already‘ credibly asserted that her
prosécution on. Counts Five and Six is batréd by the Doublé Jeopardy Clause. (See Section IL
supra). In order “to interpose [her] plea of double jeopardy,” Ms. Maxwell must confirm what is
apparent from the grand jury testimony of Special. Agent | = that’ the offenses charged
in Counts Five:and Six are the same offenses that were presented to the SDEL grand jury.

Accordingly, for these.reasons and.the’reasons already discussed iin, our‘previous motion
for a Bill:of Particulars, the Court should order thé government'to file a Bill of Particulars
identifying the following information related to Counts Five and Six ofthe $2 Indictment:

(1) The dates when’Ms. Maxwell allegedly met: and/or ‘interacted with
Accuset-4. (S2 Indictment 7 9d).

(2) The dates when.Ms. Maxwell allegedly, “groomed” or “recruited”
Accuser-4 “to engage in, sex acts with Epstein.” (/d. §§ 9d, 25a).

(3). The dates ‘when. Accuseér-4 allegedly provided “nudé massagés” to Epstein,
during:which.Epstein “engaged in multiple sex.acts” with Accuser-4. (/d.

(4) The dates when.Ms. Maxwell allegedly was “present” when [Accuser-4]
“was:nude in the massage room of the Palm Beach Residence.” (/d. § 9d).
