CAUTION - EXTERNAL:
Good afternoon Your Honor,
| write in regards to the letter filed by Christian Everdell on April
30, 2021. Based on prior discussions with defense counsel and the U.S.
Attorney's, the MDC Brooklyn is only permitted to accept external hard
drives which were loaded and certified by the U.S. Attorney's Office.
However, after internal discussions, we are not opposed to accepting the
external hard drive from defense counsel. It is our position that there
is there is no need for an Order, as MDC will be working with Defense on
acceptance of the hard drive. We will be in contact with defense
counsel in coordinating acceptance of the delivery.
Please let us know if the Court requires any additional information,
which we will be happy to provide.
Sincerely,
Sophia Papapetru
Staff Attorney
U.S. Department of Justice
Federal Bureau of Prisons
Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn
