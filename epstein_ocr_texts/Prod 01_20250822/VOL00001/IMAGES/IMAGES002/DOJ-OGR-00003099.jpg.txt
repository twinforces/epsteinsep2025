Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 165 of 239

In sum, the defendant asks this Court to dismiss Counts Five and Six by stretching to read
ambiguity into clear questions and encouraging the Court to resolve questions committed to the
jury. The Court should reject those arguments and permit the jury to resolve these issues of fact.
VI. Counts Five and Six Are Properly Joined and Should Not Be Severed

The Indictment charges the defendant with participating in a scheme to sexually abuse
minors, and with committing perjury to conceal her crimes. All six counts of the Indictment are
properly joined: they are logically connected, subject to overlapping proof, and connected by a
common scheme or plan. To sever the counts and justify holding a second trial at which a second
jury will be convened and the same witnesses—including victims of sexual abuse—will testify a
second time, the defendant must carry a heavy burden by showing substantial prejudice from the
joinder. She has not done so, and the severance motion should be denied.

A. Applicable Law

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 8(a) permits the joinder of offenses that “are of the
same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or are connected with or
constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a). This rule establishes three
tests for joinder, each “reflect[ing] a policy determination that gains in trial efficiency outweigh
the recognized prejudice that accrues to the accused.” United States v. Turoff, 853 F.2d 1037,
1042 (2d Cir. 1988).

Charges are “similar” if they are “somewhat alike” or “hav[e] a general likeness to each
other.” United States v. Rivera, 546 F.3d 245, 253 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting United States v. Werner,
620 F.2d 922, 926 (2d Cir. 1980) (internal quotation marks omitted). “Rule 8(a) does not require
‘too precise an identity between the character of the offenses.’” United States v. Pizarro, No. 17
Cr. 151, 2018 WL 1737236, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 10, 2018) (Nathan, J.) (quoting Werner, 620
