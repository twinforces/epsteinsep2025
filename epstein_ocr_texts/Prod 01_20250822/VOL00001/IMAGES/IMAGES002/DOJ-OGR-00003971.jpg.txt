CC: Counsel of Record

The Court agrees with the position set forth in this letter

that, unless the Government agrees to forgo any use of the

documents subject to the motions to suppress at trial on the

non-perjury counts, the Court must resolve those motions

prior to that trial. The Court will resolve the motions in due

course. SO ORDERED.
