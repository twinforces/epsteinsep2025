against her. The Indictment also cites the relevant state criminal statute under which the defendant
is charged constituting “sexual activity” within the language of both § 2422 and § 2243,
specifically, violations of New York Penal Law § 130.55. Indictment 4 11(b), 13, 17(b), 19. The
defendant cites no authority for her suggestion that by providing additional detail regarding how
the defendant committed the charged crimes, the Government is somehow required to provide
even more specificity beyond the basic elements of the crimes charged. Absent any such authority,
and where there is no suggestion that the Indictment fails to allege the essential elements of each
crime charged, there is no basis to dismiss any of the counts in the Indictment.

For the foregoing reasons, the defendant’s sufficiency challenges to the Indictment fail as
a matter of law, and her motion to dismiss Counts One through Four should be denied.
VIII. There Is No Basis to Strike Any Portion of the Indictment

claiming that—contrary to the plain terms of the Indictment—the events involving Minor Victim-
3 are unrelated to the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three and that some of that the
allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 are unduly prejudicial. (Def. Mot. 6). The motion is
baseless. First, as the Indictment itself makes clear, the defendant’s and Epstein’s interactions
with Minor Victim-3 were part of a broader scheme and agreement to entice and transport minor
victims with intent to commit illegal sex acts. Even if Minor Victim-3 was not ultimately

there is no legal requirement that the agreed upon crime be completed. Although Minor Victim-
3’s experiences cannot alone form the basis of a timely substantive charge, both charged
conspiracies include timely overt acts, and it is well established that a charged conspiracy can
encompass otherwise time-barred acts so long as at least one overt act in furtherance of the
