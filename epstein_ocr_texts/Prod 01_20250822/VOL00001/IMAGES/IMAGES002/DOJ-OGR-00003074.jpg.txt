hearing requires “an affidavit of someone with personal knowledge of the underlying facts.”
United States v. Shaw, 260 F. Supp. 2d 567, 570 (E.D.N.Y. 2003); see also United States v. Gillette,
383 F.2d 843, 848 (2d Cir. 1967); United States v. Ahmad, 992 F. Supp. 682, 685 (S.D.N.Y. 1998)
(“ordinarily [a factual issue must be] raised by an affidavit of a person with personal knowledge
of the facts;” otherwise “there is no basis for holding an evidentiary hearing or suppressing the
evidence”).

The defendant’s allegations are analogous to those raised when evaluating defendants’
claims of Government Franks violations. To obtain a Franks hearing, a defendant must make a
“substantial preliminary showing,” United States v. Falso, 544 F.3d 110, 125 (2d Cir. 2008)
(quoting Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154, 155-56 (1978)), that (1) there were “inaccuracies or
omissions” in the affidavit, (11) “the alleged falsehoods or omissions were necessary to the issuing
judge’s probable cause or necessity finding,” and (iii) “the claimed inaccuracies or omissions
[were] the result of the affiant’s deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth.” Lambus,
897 F.3d at 397; see also United States v. Awadallah, 349 F.3d 42, 64 (2d Cir. 2003). Even if a
defendant clears the first Franks hurdle with a substantial preliminary showing of a false statement
or omission, the defendant is not entitled to a Franks hearing unless a reviewing court makes the
legal determination that the false statement or omission was “necessary to the [issuing] judge’s
probable cause finding.” United States v. Canfield, 212 F.3d 713, 718 (2d Cir. 2000).

To determine whether alleged errors and omissions are material, a court should revise the
affidavit (adding alleged omissions and correcting alleged errors), and determine whether the
revised affidavit supports a finding of probable cause. See, e.g., Canfield, 212 F.3d at 719. Ifthe
revised affidavit supports a probable cause finding, then “the inaccuracies were not material to the
probable cause determination and suppression is inappropriate.” Jd. at 718. After adding the
