“It is well-settled. that neither the,jury sclection statute nor the Constitution ‘requires that
jurors be drawn from‘an entire district.” Buhna, 68 F.3d at 24 (collecting cases); see also United
States v. Plaza-Andrades, 507 F. App’x 22, .26 (2d Cir. 2013) (“[OJur precedent makes clear that

os "This case was s indicted: on June 29, 2020, on wich date the g grand jury sitting in White Plains
quorums: s-returned i in. Manhattan, but with substantially less ‘availability than before the pandemic.

As a result, the: Government has sought indictments, from. grand. jurics sitting in White Plains and.
Manhattan, as availability permits. In this instance, the Government was prepared, to indict on.
June 29, 2020, ‘and the only grand, jury available in this District; on. that day ‘sat in, White Plains.

The global pandemic’s cffect.on. grand. jury availability continucs to cvolve, but at.no-point have:
grand jurics.in White. Plains, or. Manhattan resumed normal. activity.

The defendant jspeculates that the Government sought an indictment: on, June 29, 2020
because of some arbitrary desire to arrest the defendant on July 2,:2020, one year to the day after:
‘a, grand jury. retuned a,scaled. indictment charging Jeffrey Epstein. with federal crimes on July 2,
2019. (See, ég:, Def: Mot. 9 at, 8). Setting: aside the silliness of marking the anniversary of an.
indictment’ s return, as s opposed: to the anniversary of the arrest itself, which.took Place 0 on July 6,
Government ‘attempted to locate and. arrest st the defendanto on n July l, 2020 butw ‘was s unable to confirm.
her location until obtaining cellphonc location data identifying her location.and enabling her arrest:
on July 2, 2020. The defense knows this because they have the warrant application. that the
Government submitted on July 1, 2020 for the. defendant’s :ccllphone location information, jin.
which the Government stated that. it had been.unable:to confirm the :defendant’s location. In other
words, the Government indicted, the defendant.as soon, as it was prepared to ‘present the evidence
it had gathered to a grand jury, and the Goyvernment.arrested the defendant: as soon'as it was able
to locate her after obtaining that indictment.
