the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him, to work six days a weck, for 12.hours per
day. Finally, ‘Villafafia pointed out that Epstcin’s purported, “supervisor’—who as. the
Foundation’s, vice president was subordinate ‘to Epstcin, the Foundation’s president=had.
promised to alert' the Sheriff's Office ifEpstein. failed:to comply with. his work schedule, but the
“supervisor” lived and. worked in the New York: metropolitan arca and was unable to monitor
Epstein’s activitics on a day-to-day: basis. The Sheriffs Office neither acknowledged nor
responded.to Villafafia’s letter.

In. March.2009, Sloman met in Miami with Dershowitz for, as Dershowitz! characterizéd.:it.
‘ina, subsequent email, “a relaxed drink.and. conversation,” which included.a discussion. of. the:
Epstein, case. After that encounter, ‘Dershowitz; emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation, for
‘Sloman’s “assurance that. the feds will not. interfere with, how the Palm ‘Beach sheriff. administers”
Epstein’s sentence’ “as long'as he is, treated like any. similarly:situated inmate.” Sloman ‘responded:

Regarding Mr. Epstein, the United States: Attorney’s Office will:not
interfere ‘with how the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office administers the
sentence imposed by the Court. That’being said, this docs:not mean
that; the USAO condones or cncourages: the. PBSO to mitigate the
terms and,conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does. not mean
that, :if'contacted. for our position. concerning alternative custody: or.
in-home detention, we would. not: object. To be elcar, if contacted
we will ‘object. Naturally, I also expect. that no one on. behalf of
Mr. Epstein, will use my’ assurance to you. to'affirmatively represent
‘to PBSO that the USAO does riot object to an. alternative custody or
home detention.

A. week’ later, Dershowitz cmailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation, for
Sloman,s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that; your office would take no position,
on how’ he handled. Epstein’s sentence,” as long'as Epstein did not. receive special, treatment, but.
adding, “[L]et’s:put any call off for awhile.”

Epstcin’s. ‘sentence required that, he be confined. to his home for a 12-month. period:
following his release from;prison: On July 22, 2009, almost 13 months after he began. serving his
sentence, Epstcin. was released from the Stockade and: placed on. home confinement.!** At this
time, he régistered as'a sexual. offender.

In the: summer of 2009, allegations surfaced, that. Epstein had cooperated. with the U.S.

Attorney’s Office for the Eastern ‘District of New York’s Investigation of investment bank Bear:
Stearns, and that he had been released early from his 18-month imprisonment term because of that.

ABS In Florida, what :is commonly referred to.as house arrest is actually the: ‘Community Control, supervision,
program. Florida Statute § ’ 948.001(3)-defines the -program.as “a forny of::intensive; supervised custody: in ‘the
community.”
