improbable that instructions would eliminate the obvious and substantial prejudice to Ms.
Maxwell. Any reasonable, intelligent, jury cannot be instructed to ignore the following:

e = Ms. Maxwell was sued for defamation by an alleged victim because she called the
alleged victim a liar.

e The government necessarily believes that Ms. Maxwell, not the alleged victims in
this case, is a liar, which is why the government charged her with perjury.

e By implication, Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers here, arguing that she is innocent, should not
be believed because they were complicit in the perjury.

e In considering whether the jury should convict Ms. Maxwell of enticing girls to
travel to perform illegal sex acts the jury should ignore all of the underlying facts
related to the defamation action including, for example, the 30 alleged victims,
Epstein’s settlement, the CVRA litigation, Epstein’s, and Ms. Maxwell’s non-
prosecution agreement.

In addition, the government glosses over, via a footnote, enormous prejudice attendant to
the perjury charges: Ms. Maxwell’s counsel of choice for five years also represented her in the
defamation action. The deposition transcript and the perjury charges place the credibility of Ms.
Maxwell’s lawyers at issue. The government obfuscates how it intends to establish materiality of
the statements, but it is probable that the government will attempt to do so through the testimony
of the civil lawyers who prosecuted the defamation action. Any rational jury would want, as a
counter, testimony from the defending lawyers on the same topic. The government suggests that
this is no problem, at least for the prosecutors, under NY RPC 3.7. We beg to differ.

The question of disqualification arising from counsel’s status as attorney and witness in
the same proceeding is premised on the so-called advocate-witness rule.> The rule, generally, is
that counsel cannot maintain dual roles as advocate and witness in the same matter before the
