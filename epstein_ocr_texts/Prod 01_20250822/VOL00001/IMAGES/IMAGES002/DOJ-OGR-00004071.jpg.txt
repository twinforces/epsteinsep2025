L4N3MAXC Arraignment

1 sure that our disclosures are complete and are prepared. Given
2 the number of other items that need to be taken care of between
3 now and 45 days before trial, we proposed 45 days before trial
4 because we are confident that we can complete a thorough review
5 of voluminous files to make sure we have satisfied our

6 disclosure obligations by that date.

7 THE COURT: If we split the difference, they're saying
8 eight weeks, you are saying six weeks. How about seven?

9 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, whatever your Honor directs,
10 we would certainly make our absolute best efforts. Our

11 estimate is based on the volume of files that your Honor is

12 aware we need to review. It is that we are confident and

13 comfortable that we can make the disclosure 45 days before

14 trial.

15 THE COURT: I'm thinking of splitting that difference.
16 The government has a lot to review to make sure it's making

17 those disclosures fully. Whatever the volume of that material
18 is, the defense has to have time to review it. This schedule,
19 assuming trial stays in July, this is the schedule. If trial
20 were to move, this is the same schedule. So, they don't get
21 any more time to review the material, whatever happens with the
22 trial date. And as I say, everyone should assume July. But I
23 think, sounds like the government would be agreeable to a
24 seven-week disclosure date.
25 MS. COMEY: May I have a moment, your Honor?
