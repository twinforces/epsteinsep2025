Jane Doe #3, in violation of her rights under the CVRA” (id. at 3); and “The Government was
well aware of Jane Doe #3 when it was negotiating the NPA, as it listed her as a victim in the
attachment to the NPA” (id. at 6). As none of Jane Doe 4’s factual details relate to non-parties,
the Court finds it unnecessary to strike the portion of the Rule 21 Motion related to her
circumstances. Regarding the Declaration in support of Petitioners’ response to Mr.
Dershowitz’s motion to intervene (DE 291-1), the Court shall strike paragraphs 4, 5, 7, 11, 13,
15, 19 through 53, and 59, as they contain impertinent details regarding non-parties. Regarding
the Declaration of Jane Doe 3 in support of the Rule 21 Motion (DE 310-1), the Court shall strike
paragraphs 7 through 12, 16, 39, and 49, as they contain impertinent details regarding non-
parties. Jane Doe 3 is free to reassert these factual details through proper evidentiary proof,
should Petitioners demonstrate a good faith basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a
matter presented for the Court’s consideration.

As mentioned, Mr. Dershowitz moves to intervene “for the limited purposes of moving to
strike the outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and requesting a show cause
order to the attorneys that have made them.” (DE 282 at 1). As the Court has taken it upon itself
to strike the impertinent factual details from the Rule 21 Motion and related filings, the Court
concludes that Mr. Derschowitz’s intervention in this case is unnecessary. Accordingly, his
motion to intervene will be denied as moot.’ Regarding whether a show cause order should

* This also moots Mr. Dershowitz’s Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Reply in
Support of Motion for Limited Intervention. (DE 317). Denying Mr. Dershowitz’s motion to
intervene also renders moot Petitioners’ motion (DE 292) to file a sealed document supporting its
response to Mr. Dershowitz’s motion. It will accordingly be denied as moot, and DE 293 (the
sealed response) will be stricken from the record.
