26.2(f) Advisory Committee’s Note, 1979 Addition. However, like the Jencks Act, the Rule
requires disclosure of witness statements only after a witness has testified on direct examination.
Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.2(a); see also Scotti, 47 F.3d at 1250 (“The plain language of
both Rule 26.2 and 18 U.S.C. § 3500(a) shows that the discovery procedure therein outlined
applies only to statements that must be produced after a witness testifies[.]”) (internal quotation
omitted)); United States v. Felt, 502 F. Supp. 71, 74 (D.D.C. 1980) (“access is to be permitted
after the defense witness has testified on direct examination”). A district court therefore lacks
authority to order early disclosure statements of prospective defense witnesses.

Due to their similarities, federal courts look to decisions interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 3500 in
order to interpret Rule 26.2. The Second Circuit has long maintained that “the Jencks Act
prohibits a District Court from ordering the pretrial disclosure of witness statements.” United
States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 145 (2d Cir. 2001). See also In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 286 (2d
Cir. 1987); United States v. Percevault, 490 F.2d 126, 132 (2d Cir. 1974) (‘the trial judge is
prevented by the Jencks Act from ordering pretrial disclosure of statements made by a
prospective government witness over the government’s objection”). Cf United States v. Benson,
20 F.R.D. 602, 605 (S.D.N.Y. 1957) (holding that Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1953)
does not apply until “a witness is called to the witness stand”).

Because the court cannot compel the government to provide early Jencks Act or Rule
26.2 disclosures to the defense — and the defense is not entitled to it by virtue of statute — it
necessarily follows that the court cannot compel the same material from the defense. See
Wardius v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 475-76 (1973). A district court can only “encourage” the
practice of early disclosure. See Percevault, 490 F.2d at 132.
