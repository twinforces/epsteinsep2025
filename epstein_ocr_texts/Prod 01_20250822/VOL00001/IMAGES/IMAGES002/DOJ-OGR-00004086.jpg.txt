26:2(f) Advisory: Committec’s Note, 1979. Addition. However, like the Jencks Act, the Rule
requires disclosure of witness statements only:afier a 'witness.has testified on direct examination.
Fed. R.. Crim. P..26.2(a); see also Scotti, 47. F.3d at.1250 (“Theplain language of

both Rule 26.2. arid 18 U:S.C. § 3500(a) shows that the: discovery procedure therein outlined
applics only to statements that-must be:produced. after a witness testifies[.]”) (internal quotation.
omitted)); Wiited States v. Jelt, 502: F. Supp. 71,74 (D.D.C. 1.980) (access. is to be permitted.
after the defense witness has testified on. ditect'examination”). A district. court therefore lacks
authority to order early: disclosure statements of prospective: defense witnesses.

Due to their:similaritics, federal courts look’to, decisions interpreting’ 18 U.S.C. § 3500 in
order to:interpret Rule 26.2. The Second Circuit has long maintained that “the Jencks Act
prohibits a District, Court.from ordering the pretrial, disclosure of witness statements.” United
States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 145 (2d.Cir. 2001). Sc@ also In Fé ULS.9'834 F.2d 283,286 (2d
Cir. 1987); United States -v. Percevault, 490 F.2d 126,132. (2d.Cir. 1974) (“the trial. judge is.
prevented, by the Jencks.Act from ordering‘pretrial disclosure of statements made, by’ a
prospective government Witness over the government’s objection”). Cf Unitéd States ¥. Benson,
20 F.R.D. 602, 605 (S.D.N.¥. 1957) (holding that Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1953)
does ‘not. apply. until “‘a ‘witness is called. to the witness, stand”).

Because the:court cannot compel the government to provide carly Jencks Act or.Rule:
26.2. disclosures to the’ defense — and.the defense ‘is not, entitled to:it by. virtue of statute — it
necessarily follows that the court.cannot compel the same material from the defense. See
Wardins.v. Oregon, 412 U.S. 470, 475-76 (1.973). A-district court can only “encourage” the:

practice of carly disclosure. See Percevaull, 490 F.2d at 132.
