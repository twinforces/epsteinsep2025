The balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are committed
to’the sound discretion. of the trial judge.” United States v. Casdmenté,, 887 E.2d.1141, 1149 Qd
Cir. 1989). In its discretion, the Court. concludes that trying the: perjury counts separately will
best ensure a’ fair ‘and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.

VI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusagé is premature

Maxwell moves to strike allegations related:to one of the alleged victims from the S$
superseding' indictment as, surplusage. The ‘Court declines to do so atithis juncture.

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allows a:court to strike surplusage from.an
indictment. on a.defendant’s motion. “Motions to:strike surplusage from, an ‘indictment:will. be
granted, only where the challenged allegations are: not relévant to the:crime charged, and are
inflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d.1023, 1030(2d Cir. 1996)
(cleaned up). Courts in;this District; gencrally delay ruling on.any motion.to strike until after'the:
presentation of the Govérnment’s, éVideneé attrial, because that evidence may affect how
specific allegations relate to:the overall charges. See, ¢.g., United States v. Nejad, No. 18-cr-224
(AIN), 2019:WL 6702361, at *18(S.D.N.Y.. Dec. 6, 2019): United States vy. Mostafa, 965 F.
Supp. 2d 451,467 (S.D.NLY. 2013).

Maxwell contends that the allegations related, to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage’
because the indictment docs not charge that. Minor Victim-3 traveled. in interstate: Commerce or
was below the age of consent in. England where the alleged. activities took.place. Thus, she
‘argues, these allegations. do ‘not relate to the charged:conspiracy and. instead reflect.an attempt to
introduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.

The Court will not strike any language fromthe S1 superseding indictment at this

juncture. ‘The standard ‘under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires, the defendant to demonstrate.
