Epstein or the defendant.”)). In other words, the defendant again seeks supposedly exculpatory
evidence that does not exist. The defendant offers no basis on which to conclude that this
representation is false or that any such evidence does in fact exist. As such, this motion should be
denied.

Fifth, the defendant asks this Court, again without citing any legal authority, to order the
Government to produce copies of a// subpoenas it has issued for the defendant’s records as part of
its investigation in this case. (Def. Mot. 10 at 11). This incredibly broad request is nothing more
than a fishing expedition inappropriately seeking the details of investigative requests made through
the grand jury process. The defense has cited no legal basis for the Court to direct the Government
to provide the defense with copies of the subpoenas themselves (as opposed to records or other
materials received in response to such subpoenas), let alone every subpoena issued for the
defendant’s records during a multi-year and ongoing grand jury investigation. The types of
requests issued by the grand jury have no conceivable bearing on the defense or on any motion the
defense may seek to bring. The Government has already produced to the defense all discoverable
material that it has received in response to subpoenas issued to date during this investigation. In
the absence of any legal authority justifying this request, it should be denied. Additionally, for the
reasons discussed above in Sections I and I'V, the defendant is not entitled to discovery or a hearing
relating to her motion to dismiss the Indictment based on the NPA or her motion to suppress
subpoena returns.

Sixth, the defendant asks the Court to direct the Government to immediately disclose any
Brady and Giglio material. (Def. Mot. 10 at 11-13). The motion for disclosure of Brady material
should be denied as moot because the Government has conducted a search for any such material
and has already disclosed any potentially exculpatory information in its possession of which it is
