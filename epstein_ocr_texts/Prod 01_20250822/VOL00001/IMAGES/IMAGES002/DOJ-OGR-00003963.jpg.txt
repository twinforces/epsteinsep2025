Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s Order dated
April 21, 2021, which directed the Government to submit any requests for redaction of information
contained in filings regarding the defense’s proposed Rule 17(c) subpoena. (Dkt. No. 226). After
reviewing the relevant filings, the Government seeks a limited number of redactions, which are
narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of third parties. In particular, the Government
respectfully requests that the Court permit the redaction of the names and identifying information
of particular third parties referenced in the defense’s response to the objections of Boies Schiller
Flexner LLP (“BSF”) to the defense’s proposed Rule 17(c) subpoena, BSF’s reply, and the April
19, 2021 joint letter addressing the redactions to those same documents. Today the Government
is submitting to the Court by email its proposed redactions to those documents, which the
Government respectfully requests be filed under seal.
These proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second
Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although these
documents are judicial documents that are subject to the common law presumption of access, the
