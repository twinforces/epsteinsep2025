material information to a federal judge in an ex parte proceeding, “[t]he call for the court’s
supervisory power .. . is at its strongest and most defensible.” Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1214.

Maxwell need not satisfy the standard of Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978) in
order to obtain relief. But even if Franks applies, Maxwell has easily met her burden. To obtain a
Franks hearing, a defendant must make a “substantial preliminary showing,” United States v.
Falso, 544 F.3d 110, 125 (2d Cir. 2008) (quoting Franks, 438 U.S. at 155-56), that (1) there were

were deliberately false, since he had a “complete handle on the landscape” months before he

105 F.3d 82, 91 (2d Cir. 1997). To prevail on an outrageous government conduct claim, “a
defendant must show that the government's conduct is ‘so outrageous that common notions of
fairness and decency would be offended were judicial processes invoked to obtain a
