traumatic experiences” (second alteration in original)); Raniere, 2019 WL 2212639, at *3, *7
(admitting expert testimony that “disclosure by sexual assault victims often unfolds over time, and
the process of disclosure is influenced by multiple and changing factors including, but not limited
to, the specific characteristics of the experience, the victim’s psychological vulnerabilities, the
victim’s relationship to her perpetrator and her pattern of recovery and coping”); United States v.
Young, 623 F. App’x 863, 865-66 (9th Cir. 2015) (“[The expert] testified that . . . delayed
disclosures, piecemeal disclosures and/or even recanted disclosures are coping mechanisms. ...
[The expert]’s testimony was helpful and probative because [the defendant] had attacked the
victims’ credibility based on their delayed and incomplete reports of abuse.” (citations and internal
quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Betcher, 534 F.3d 820, 826 (8th Cir. 2008) (“In this
case, Dr. Levitt’s testimony as to delayed disclosure helped the jury understand why the girls did
not reveal they had been photographed until they were confronted with the images.”).

The defendant suggests that Dr. Rocchio’s opinions on delayed disclosure are not helpful
to the jury because they are too generic. As set forth here and more fully in Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks
Act material, Dr. Rocchio has elaborated on her opinions about the relationship between child
sexual abuse and traumatic memory.’ The defendant adds that, because Dr. Rocchio’s opinion is
that delayed disclosure is consistent with sexual abuse but not a necessary consequence of sexual
abuse, jurors have no means to determine whether a Minor Victim is lying or telling the truth.
7 The defendant also argues that Dr. Rocchio is not an expert in “the human brain or memory
generally.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 17). The Government agrees. But Dr. Rocchio is an expert in trauma
psychology, which includes related issues of memory.
