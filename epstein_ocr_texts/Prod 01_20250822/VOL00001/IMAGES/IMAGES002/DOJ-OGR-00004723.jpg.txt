question is'simply “whether the charged offenses involved. the:scxual abuse of'a:minor on the facts
alleged in this case.” (Apr. Op. at 13). As was the case for Counts One through Four, there is no
question that Counts Five:and Six involved the:sexual abuse: of a:minor on:the facts alleged in this
case. Accordingly, the motion, should’be denied.

Counts Five and. Six. are also timely*under 18 U.S.C. § 3299, which .climinated the statute
of limitation, for certain scx crimes, including violations of 18'U.S.C. § 1591. Enacted in July:
2006, § 3299 provides that:

Notwithstanding any ‘other law, an indictment may. be found or an

information. instituted. at.any time'without limitation for any offense

under ‘section 1201 involving a minor victim, and. for any felony

‘under chapter 109A, 110 (except for section. 2257 and .2257A), or

‘LL, or section 1591.
Because:Count Five alleges a conspiracy to violate § 1591. and Count Six alleges a substantive
violation of § 15911, there is, no statute of limitation for these counts, pursuant to § 3299.

Applying § 3299, which was passed in 2006, to charges arising from-conduct between 200.1
and 2004 is appropriateunder:Landgraf v.. UST Film Products, 51. 0.S.244, 280 (1994). At step
one of the Lundgraf analysis, the statute unambiguously: applics to offenses notwithstanding any’
other statute of limitations, as the plain text of § 3299 applics “[nJotwithstanding any other law.”
And. at step two, because the statute of limitations for Counts Five and. Six: had ‘not ‘run in 2006
when § 3299 was passed, its application here has no impermissible retroactive effect. Indeed, in
many respects the analysis of §.3299 under Landgraf mirrors the analysis of § 3283, which the
Court has ‘held. applies to pre-cnaetment conduct. (See Apr. Op: at 16 (analyzing the, retroactive:

application. of § 3283 and concluding that the statute applies to-pre-chactmcnt conduct)).
