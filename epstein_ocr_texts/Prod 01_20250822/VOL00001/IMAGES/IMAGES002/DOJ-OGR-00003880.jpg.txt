set forth herein stem from the role of [Ms. Maxwell] in the sexual exploitation and abuse of
multiple minor girls by Jeffrey Epstein.” Indictment § 1. The Indictment also contains two
conspiracy counts that charge Ms. Maxwell with conspiring with Epstein. /d. 9] 9, 15.

According to the government, however, Ms. Maxwell’s status as an alleged co-
conspirator of Epstein is somehow insufficient for an NPA that immunizes “potential co-
conspirators of Epstein” to apply to her. The government claims that there is “no evidence that
the parties intended to confer a benefit on her in particular.” Opp. 20. In essence, the
government implausibly argues that even though the parties expressly agreed to immunize “any
potential co-conspirators of Epstein,” only those individuals whom the parties were thinking
about “in particular” qualify for immunity. The government cites no support for the rule it has
concocted, and case law is to the contrary.
For example, in United States v. Florida West Int’l Airways, Inc., 853 F. Supp. 2d 1209
(S.D. Fla. 2012), where a corporation had entered into a plea agreement that immunized its
employees, the court held that one of those employees had standing to enforce the agreement as a
third-party beneficiary by virtue of his employment; the court did not require a showing that the
parties thought about protecting that employee “in particular” when they agreed to immunize the
class. /d. at 1228. Similarly, in United States v. El-Sadig, 133 F. Supp. 2d 600 (N.D. Ohio
2001), where a Saudi prince had entered into an agreement with the government that none of the
individuals involved in purchasing guns for two members of the Saudi royal family would be
prosecuted, the court did not require the defendant to show that the government and the prince
intended to immunize him “in particular”; to the contrary, as the court noted, the parties to the
agreement did not even discuss the defendant. /d. at 604.
