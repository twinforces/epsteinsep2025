Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293 Filed 05/25/21 Page 14 of 32
Maxwell, who called Accuser-4 from New York to schedule massage appointments. (Ex. C at
17:18-22, 25:1-6). It was Epstein, not Ms. Maxwell, who encouraged Accuser-2 to recruit her
friends to give him massages. (/d. at 25:25-26:18). And it was Epstein, not Ms. Maxwell, who
provided lingerie and other gifts to Accuser-4 and sent FedEx packages to her residence. (/d. at
28:19-29:10). Furthermore, Accuser-4 alleged that led Accuser-4 upstairs to Epstein’s
bedroom the first time she gave him a massage by herself (id. at 25:7-15) and that paid
Accuser-4 $500 to take nude photographs of her at the Palm Beach residence at Epstein’s request
(id. at 27:1-10).

Ultimately, the proposed SDFL indictment sought to charge Epstein not Ms.
Maxwell, with a sex trafficking offense involving Accuser-4. (/d. at 28:11-14 (the evidence
relating to Accuser-4 formed “the basis for the allegation [in Count Two of the proposed SDFL
indictment] that Jeffrey Epstein Ps procured [Accuser-4] to engage in commercial
sex acts knowing that she was under 18”)). This is entirely consistent with the language of the
NPA, PY and not Ms. Maxwell, as one of the four named “potential co-
conspirators.” (Ex. B at 5 of 7). In fact, the USAO-SDFL conceded that it never found “any
specific evidence against” Ms. Maxwell related to the subject of their investigation. (See Ex. A,
OPR Report at 167 (internal quotations omitted)).

Hence, it would not only be impermissible under the NPA to prosecute Ms. Maxwell for
the offenses charged in Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment because they were “the subject
of” the Florida Investigation and “the related grand jury investigation.” (Dkt. 207 at 7). It would
also be entirely unjust to base a prosecution in this District on the same offenses related to the
same accuser who never mentioned Ms. Maxwell—and instead implicated a vben
she first reported the allegations that form the basis of Counts Five and Six over thirteen years
