method of assessing a particular defendant’s degree of sophistication. Any attempt would

Commonwealth's decision for approximately ten years. When he announced his
declination decision on behalf of the Commonwealth, District Attorney Castor knew that
Cosby would be forced to testify based upon the Commonwealth’s assurances. Knowing
that he induced Cosby’s reliance, and that his decision not to prosecute was designed to
