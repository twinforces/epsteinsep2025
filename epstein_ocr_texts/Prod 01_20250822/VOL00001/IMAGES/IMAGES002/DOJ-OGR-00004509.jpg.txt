managers required more effort than in other offices, where a.line AUSA can more casily just.stop
by a'supervisor’s office'to discuss.a case.”

Second, key personiiel Were, abscnt at varying times. Menchel’s last day.in the office was
August 3, 2007, the day ‘he sent to the defense: his letter making, the initial offer, and presumably
in.the immediate period before his departure date, Menchel:would have been,trying:to wrap up:his
outstanding work. Yct, this'was also the time when Acosta, was-deciding how to resolve the:matter.
Similarly, in the,critical ‘month of September, the NPA and ‘plea negotiations intensified and the
NPA cvolved significantly, with the USAO. having ‘to consider multiple different options as. key’
provisions. ‘were continuously ‘added. ‘or modified ‘while Villafana pressed. to meet her late-
September deadline. Although Lourie was involved ‘with the negotiations during this ‘period, he
was at.the same time transitioning not only, toa new job but, to.one in Washington, 'D.C., and was
traveling between the two locations. Sloman'was on. vacation in the weck preceding the signing,
when many significant.changes were made'to the agrcément, and. he did:not participate in drafting
or reviewing’the NPA before: it was signed. Accordingly, during the key negotiation-period for a
significant case involving,a‘uniquc resolution, no onc involved-had both.a thorough. understanding
of the case and full ownership of the decisions that were’ being made. ‘Villafafia certainly felt:that.
during the negotiations, she was, only implementing decisions ‘made: by Acosta. Acosta, however,
told:OPR that when reviewing the NPA, “I would have ‘reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did.
it do the... bullet:points, and.my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have: ‘been that. Andy aiid
Maric: would have looked at this, and :that'this was . . . appropriate.”

The consequences flowing from the: lack of ownership and effective communication can.
be scen in. the NPA. itself. As demonstrated by. the contemporancous communications, the
negotiations were at times confusing as the partics considered multiple options and even.revisited
proposals: previously-rejccted. Mcanwhile, Villafafia sought to.keep to a deadlinc:that.would allow
her'to charge Epstcin’when, she: had planned. to, if the partics did not.reach, agreement. In the end,
Acosta accepted several terms with little apparent. discussion or consideration of the ramifications.

The USAO’s agreement fot to. prosecute * “any potential. co-conspirators” is. a notable
example. As previously noted, the only: written discussion about the: term that OPR. found was
Villafafia’s email to Lourie: and the incoming’ West Palm, Beach, manager, with copies to: her:
co-counsel and dircet.:supervisor, ‘stating that she did not. believe’ the provision “hurts, us,” and.
neither.Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafafia-recalled any further discussion about the provision. Although
OPR did ‘ot find evidence showing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia intended. the scope of the
provision to protect anyone other: than.Epstcin’s four assistants, the plain language oftthe:provision.
precluded the USAO. from: prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in-his criminal. conduct,
within. the limitations sct by the ‘overall agreement. This. broad prosecution declination would.
likely be unwise in most:cases but jin this case in particular, the USAO did not have a'sufficient.
‘investigative basis. from ‘which. it, could conclude with any reasonable certitude’that'there were ‘tio
other individuals who. should. be held accountable along ‘with Epstcin or that evideneéc might not.
be: developed implicating others. Prosccutors:rarcly promise: not. to prosecute unidentified. third.
