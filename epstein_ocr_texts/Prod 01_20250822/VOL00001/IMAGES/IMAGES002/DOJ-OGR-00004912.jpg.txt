oN il Rule 60. We will be extremely restricted in our use of them.
2 To the extent that we receive materials that otherwise wouldn't

10 that these materials would be used to commence criminal
11 proceedings against either of the parties to the libel case?
12 MR, ROSSMILLER: I can say that just as a general

16 proceed with an investigation of any such individual. That's a
17 little broad, your Honor, obviously, but --

20 MR. ROSSMILLER: But I don't think that there's any
21. additional protection for the parties of the lawsuit as opposed
22 to nonparties' information.
23 THE COURT: They're the ones who relied on the
24 protective order. Of course you say it's not reasonable to
25 rely, but they're the ones who relied on the protective order
