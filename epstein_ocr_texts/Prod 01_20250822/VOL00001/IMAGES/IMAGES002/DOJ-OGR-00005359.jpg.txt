Introduction

The parties respectfully request, pursuant to Rule 24(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, that the Court include the following questions in its examination of prospective jurors.
The Court is requested to pursue more detailed questioning if a particular juror’s answer reveals
that further inquiry is appropriate and, in such an instance, to conclude with an inquiry whether
the particular fact or circumstance would influence the juror in favor of or against either the
Government or the defendant, or otherwise affect the juror’s ability to serve as a fair and impartial
juror in this case.

You are being considered for jury service in a criminal case involving charges against
Ghislaine Maxwell.

it is important for you to remember that Ms. Maxwell has denied the charges and pleaded
not guilty. Like anyone accused of a crime in this country, Ms. Maxwell is, and must be, presumed
innocent of any and all charges made against her unless and until the government proves her guilt
beyond a reasonable doubt. The Indictment is only an accusation and is not proof or evidence of
anything.

The government and only the government has the burden of proving each of the essential
elements of each crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. The purpose of the trial is to determine
whether the government has met this burden.

A defendant in a criminal trial never has to prove innocence. Every defendant is presumed
innocent of the charges in an indictment, unless and until during your deliberations you determine
that the government has met its burden of proof.

Four rules apply in every criminal case that you must keep in mind.
