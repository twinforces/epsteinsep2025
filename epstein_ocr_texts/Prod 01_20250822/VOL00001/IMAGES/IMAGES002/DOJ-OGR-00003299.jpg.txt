Epstein’s counsel;to challenge’portions.of the NPA. Acosta’s letter concluded:

Although it happens rarely, | do not’ mind this, Office’s, decision
being appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our
with, the. option of appealing. our 1 decisions. ‘Indeed, although. | am
confident in our prosecutors’ cvidenee and Icgal analysis, |
nonetheless directed them to:consult with:the subject matter: experts
in [CEOS] to. confirm our interpretation of the law before approving
their [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a. letter addressed. to
Department;Headquarters that raises. issues that. cither have not’ been
raised ‘with this Office previously or that: have been. raised, and in

Agreement. “The AUSAS who: have been. negotiating with defense
counsel have’ for some time complained to me ‘regarding the tactics
used. by the: defense team. It appears to. them. that as soon as

whether the defense’ team wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the
Agreement.

Acosta explained to OPR-that he did not.view his letter as“inviting” Departmental:review,
but he believed. the: ‘Department., had ‘the “right” te address Epstein’s concerns. Moreover, the
USAO?’s only option at, that time’was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which, would have

‘repeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent to abide by’ the agreement, making: any USAO cffort. to
declare him:in breach. more: difficult. In fact, the day after recciving Acosta’s Ictter, Starr and
