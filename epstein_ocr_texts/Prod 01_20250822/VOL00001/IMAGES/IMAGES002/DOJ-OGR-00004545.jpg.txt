Nevertheless, as Epstcin’s team, continued to argueto higher levels. of the. Department'that.

‘that the FBI “had ‘very tight. contact with the ‘victims several months ago when we were prepared.
to [file;charges], but all the shenanigans over'the past few months have resultéd.in no-contact with.
the vast majority of'the victims.” Villafafia then. ‘proposed that the FBI “re-cstablish contact with.
all the: victims’ so that: we know we can rely on them at:trial.’”2’  Villafafia.told OPR that at this
point, ‘ ‘Tw]hilethe case was being investigat[ed] and. prepared. for indictment, I did. not ‘prepare or
send any.‘victim notification Ictters=there simply ‘was nothing to update. I did not receive any’
victim. calls during this tinic.”
