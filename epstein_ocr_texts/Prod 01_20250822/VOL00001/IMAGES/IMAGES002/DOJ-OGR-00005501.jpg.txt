ae once mentioned Ms. Maxwell.”> See 3505-005. Instead, she told Special
Agent i that (|) i would call her on the phone from
New York to schedule the massages, (2) led her upstairs to the massage room and
prepared the massage table, (3) called her on one occasion to tell her that Epstein had
bought her concert tickets, and (4) J took nude photographs of her for Epstein when she
was 16 years old. See 3505-005 at 2-4. On the basis of I testimony and other
related documentary evidence, the USAO-SDFL charged Epstein gg, and not Ms.
Maxwell, with a substantive count of sex trafficking in a proposed indictment that Special Agent
HEE presented to the grand jury on March 18, 2008. See 3505-018 at 28 (Count Two of
the proposed SDFL indictment alleged that “Jeffrey Epstein qq procured
[Accuser-4] to engage in commercial sex acts knowing that she was under 18”).
EE 2007 testimony stands in stark contrast to her first interview with the
New York FBI almost thirteen years later, on July 17, 2020, when she specifically recalled that
on her first visit to the residence she was greeted at the door by “Ghislaine Maxwell” and
recounted what Ms. Maxwell said to her. See 3505-068 at 1-2. further described
seeing Ms. Maxwell multiple times at the residence and having “multiple conversations” with
her about sexual topics, and claimed, among other things, that Ms. Maxwell called her to
schedule massages, paid her for the massages on a few occasions, sent her gifts, and offered to
help her get a passport so that she could travel with Epstein. See id. at 2-4. In subsequent

whom she saw at the Palm Beach residence the first time she went. 3505-005 at 1. But even assuming,
arguendo, that Accuser-4 was referring to Ms. Maxwell (which we do not concede), she did not implicate
Ms. Maxwell in Epstein’s alleged sex trafficking in any way.
