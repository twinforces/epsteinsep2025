1. The Text of the Agreement Does Not: Contain.a Promise to Bind Other
Districts

Turning first to the text of the ‘NPA, ‘the terms of. the agreement do not contain an.

SDFL signed the agreement. There is no signature block for, nor specific mention. of, any other
district or component of the Department of Justice:
