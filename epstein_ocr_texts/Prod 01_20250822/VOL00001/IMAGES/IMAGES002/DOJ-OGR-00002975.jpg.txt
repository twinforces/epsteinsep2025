including any agreement not to prosecute, which purports to bind

any other district(s) or division without the express written approval

of the United States Attorney(s) in each affected district and/or the

Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division.’
Government Brief, 08 Civ. 80736 (KAM), Dkt. No. 205-2, at 11 n.11 (S.D. Fla.) (quoting United
States Attorney’s Manual, 9-27.641 (Multi-District (Global) Agreement Requests)). Significantly,
this brief was signed by the same prosecutor who negotiated and signed the NPA. /d. Although
the defendant makes the sweeping, self-serving, and unsupported allegation that “the government
had every reason to foresee a potential prosecution of Epstein’s co-conspirators in this District
and, after multiple layers of review within the Department of Justice, intended to agree to preclude
it,’ the USAO-SDFL’s brief says otherwise. (Def. Mot. 1 at 22). Further still, the record
developed in both civil litigation and OPR’s investigation does not support this claim.

3s 2 3
As the foregoing makes clear, the defendant has failed to produce any evidence that the
USAO-SDFL promised Epstein that other districts would be bound by the NPA. There is no
“affirmative appearance” that the NPA binds other districts, and the motion should be denied.
Under Annabi and its progeny, the defendant has failed to establish that the NPA binds other
districts. For this reason alone, the defendant’s motion should be dismissed, in keeping with the
well-established law in this Circuit.*
8 In her motion, the defendant asks this Court to apply a bizarre and unprecedented choice-of-
federal-law doctrine, under which the defendant asks the Court to apply non-existent rulings from
the Eleventh Circuit on an issue that Court does not appear to have reached. (Def. Mot. 1 at 23-
25). This argument has no legal foundation, and the defendant offers no authority for the
proposition that federal plea agreements are governed by the choice of law principles that apply to
conflicting state laws. Annabi is the binding law of this Circuit, and this Court must apply it.
