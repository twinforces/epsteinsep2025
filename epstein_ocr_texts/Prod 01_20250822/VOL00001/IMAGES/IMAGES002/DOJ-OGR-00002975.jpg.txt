including any agreement not.to prosecute, which purports. to bind

any. other-district(s) or-division without-the express ‘written approval

of the United States Attorney(s) in. cach affected. district and/or the

Assistant Attorncy Gencral of the Criminal Division.’
Government Brief, 08 Civ:'80736 (KAM), Dkt..No. 205-2, at, nl] (S.D, Fla.) (quoting United
States Attorney’s Manual, 9-27.641. (Multi-District (Global) Agreément Requests)). Significantly,
this brief was. signed by the:same prosecutor who negotiated and signed the NPA. /d. Although.
the defendant makes the sweeping, ‘self-serving, and, unsupported allegation that “the government.
had every reason to foresee a. potential, prosecution. of Epstein’s, c6-conspirators in, this, District
and, after multiple layers of review within the Department of Justice, intended to agrec to preclude
it,” the USAO-SDFL’s, bricf says otherwise. (Def. Mot. 1 at. 22). Further: still, the record
developed. in both. civil litigation-and OPR’s investigation does not support this claim.

As the foregoing makes clear, 'the defendant. has failed to.producé any evidence that the

USAO-SDFL promised.Epstcin 'that..other districts would be bound by the.NPA. There ‘is no
“affirmative appearance” that the NPA ‘binds other districts, ‘and.‘the motion, should ‘be, denicd.
Under Annabi and its progeny, the defendant has. failed to establish ‘that. the NPA binds other
districts. For'this reason alone, the: defendant’s motion should’be dismissed, in. keeping with the

well-established law in this Circuit.®

* In her’ motion, the defendant: asks this Court fo apply a bizarre and unprecedented .choice-of-
federal-law- doctrine, _under which the defendant asks the Court to apply:non-existent rulings from.
the Eleventh. Circuit on an. issue that Court docs not.appear.to have reached. (Def. Mot. | at 23-
25). This argument has no legal foundation, and the defendant. offers ‘no authority for the
proposition that federal. plea, agreements are governed by the choice of'law principles that apply to
conflicting state laws. Annabi is the binding law of this Circuit, and this Court must apply it.
