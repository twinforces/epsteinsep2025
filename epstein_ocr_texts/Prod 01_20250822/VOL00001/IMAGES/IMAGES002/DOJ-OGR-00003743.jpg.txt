Jane Doe #4’s Circumstances

If permitted to join this action, Jane Doe #4 would allege, and could prove at trial, that
she has CVRA claims similar to those advanced by Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, based on the
following:

As with the other Jane Does, Jane Doe #4 was repeatedly sexually abused by Epstein. In
or around the summer of 2002, Jane Doe #4, an economically poor and vulnerable sixteen-year-
old child, was told by another one of Epstein’s underage minor sex abuse victims, that she could
make $300 cash by giving an old man a massage on Palm Beach. An acquaintance of Jane Doe
#4 (also a minor sexual abuse victim of Epstein) telephoned Epstein and scheduled Jane Doe #4
to go to Epstein’s house to give him a massage. During that call, Epstein himself got on the
phone (a means of interstate communication) with Jane Doe #4, asking her personally to come to
his mansion in Palm Beach.

Jane Doe #4 then went to Epstein’s mansion and was escorted upstairs to Epstein’s large
bathroom by one of Epstein’s assistants. Shortly thereafter Jeffrey Epstein emerged and Jay face
down on the table and told Jane Doe #4 to start massaging him. Epstein asked Jane Doe #3 her
age and she told him she had recently turned sixteen. Epstein subsequently committed illegal
sexual acts against Jane Doe #4 on many occasions.

Epstein used a means of interstate communication (i.e., a cell phone) to arrange for these
sexual encounters. Epstein also frequently travelled in interstate commerce (i.e., on his personal
jet) for purposes of illegally sexually abusing Jane Doe #4.
