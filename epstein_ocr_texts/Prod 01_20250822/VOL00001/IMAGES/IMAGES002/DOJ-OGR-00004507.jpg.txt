Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21. Page 210 of 349

the defendant faced decades in. prison for sexual, crimes’ against minors with such an, insignificant:
term of incarceration, and made, numerous other concessions to the defense. As OPR‘has sct forth.
in. substantial detail inthis Report, OPR did. not find cvidence to support allegations that the
prosécutors sought to, benefit Epstein, at the expense of the victims. Instead, ‘the. result. can more
appropriatcly be tied. to Acosta’s misplaced.:concerns about interfering with. a traditionally: state
crime and. intruding on, state authority. Acosta was also’ unwilling to abandon the path. that:he had.
set, even when Villafafia and Lourie advocated to end. the negotiations and even, though Acosta.
himself had Icarned that the ‘state authorities may‘not have been. a reliable partner.

Many: of the problems that developed might have been avoided. had. Acosta engaged in.
greater consultation ‘with his staff before making key decisions. The ‘contemporancous' records
revealed problems’with communication and coordination among the five’key participants. Acosta.
‘was involved to, a greater extent and made more decisions, than. he did in’ a typical, case. Lourie
told OPR that. it, was “unusual to have a U.S. Attorney get involved with this level. of detail?”
Menchcel:told.OPR, “I know we would have spoken aboutthis case a lot, okay? And.I’m sure with.
Jeff.as well, and there were conversations -- a mecting that I had. with. Maric and Andy as well.”
Lourie :similarly. told. OPR: .

Well,. .. he would.have:been. talking to Jeff and Matt, talking to, mé
to the extent.that he did, he would have. been looking at the: Pros
Memo and. ; . the suas from CEOS, he would have | been
Aitomey, 1 don’t know, just . bone all these different sources s of
information he was -- I’m. comfortable that he knew the case, ‘you
know, that he was, he’was reading everything. Apparently, he, you
know,, read the Pros Memo, he read all the stuff.

At the same'time, Acosta-was'significantly removed, both in.physical distance and.in_levels
in. the ‘supervisory chain, from the individuals with the most knowledge of the facts, of the case=:
Villafaiia and, ‘to a lesser extent, Lourie. Louric normally would have:signed offon the prosceution,
memorandum.on his.own, but as he:told OPR, he recognized thatthe case was going: to go through.
the front offiec “[b]ecausc there was front office involvement from the g get go.” Yet, although,
Acosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as
oversecing the investigation or the’ details, of implementing his decisions. OPR. observed that-as a,
consequence, management, of the case suffered from. both an absence of Ownership of the
investigation and failures in:;communication that affected:critical decisions.

On occasion, Villafafia.included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information ‘upon
which Acosta relied for his decisions and information about the decisions Acosta, had made
traveled through ‘multiple layers between Acosta and Villafafia. Villafafia did draft a detailed,
analytical prosecution ‘memorandum, but:it.is not.clear that Acosta read. it and instead ‘may have
relicd on conversations primarily with. ‘Menchel and. later with Sloman after Menchel’s. departure.
Despite'these discussions, though, It isnot clear that, Acosta-was aware of certain information,:such,
as Oosterbaan’s. strong opinion, from. the, outset: in :favor. of the prosecution or of Villafafia’s
concerns and, objections to a state-based resolution or the final NPA. Acosta. interpreted the state
indiétment'on.only one charge as 4 sign. that the case. was Weak’ cvidentially, but it is-not élear'that
when making his decision to resolve the matter though:a. state-based ‘plea, he knew the: extent. to
