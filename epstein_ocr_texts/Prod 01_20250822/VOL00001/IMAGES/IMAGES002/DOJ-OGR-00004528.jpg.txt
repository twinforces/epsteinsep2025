instructed, “Don’t talk to [the'‘victims]. Don’t tell them ‘what’s, happening;” but: she was not told
why'she should not speak:to:the victims, and. she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In,
a subsequent OPR..interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raised the :issuc ‘of notification.
during the meeting, she-was' told, “Plea negotiations ; are confidential. You:can’t disclose them.”?*?
Villafafia remained-uncertain who g gave her this instruction, but belicved.it:may have been Acosta.

Neither Acosta, Sloman, ‘nor Menehel recalled a mecting at which Villafana ‘was, directed.
not to notify the victims. Acosta told OPR that the decision whether to solicit the victims’ view:
“is: something [that] I think, was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused.
on at lcast at this time,” and. he did not.“recall discussions about victim, notification until after the
NPA ‘was signed.” Sloman. also told OPR. that: he did not; recall a meeting at which victim.
notification was discussed. Mencheél wrote in his résponsé to OPR, “I have no recollection of any’
discussions or.decisions regarding whether the USAO should:notify victims:of its intention to enter
into a.pre-charge disposition. of the Epstein matter.” Furthermore, Menchel. told OPR.he could not
think: of a, reason. why the issuc of victim notification would have arisen before he Icft the USAO,
because “we were way off:from finalizing or having anything cven:close to a deal,” and it would
have: been “premature” to consider‘notification.””*

[CEOS: Chief Oosterbaan] ‘politely reminded me, is required under, the law” and that “the [PBPD]

ARK Villafaha could,not recall the specific. date of the meeting. but Meiichel lett the USAO on August 3. 2007.

‘victims to exaggerate their storics because-of their desire to obtain damages from.Epstein:”

290 In commenting on. OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel reiterated, his, contention. that Villafafia’s ‘claim
about a ‘meeting. involving. Menchel. in which she. was instructed. not to consult with ‘victims was inaccurate and,
inconsistent’ with otherevidence. OPR carefully considered;the comments but.did..not:conclude. that the evidence. to
which Menchel’s attorney pointed necessarily:refuted Villafafia’s :assertion.that she had received an instruction from
a supervisor not to inform:victims about: the plea negotiations. ‘However, :it 1s also true that OPR.did. not ‘find any:
reference in, the emails and other documents ‘dated before the; NPA. was signed toa meeting’ at which victim.
consultation was: discussed or to a. specific instruction not to: consult with the victims:, This:is one of several, ev ents
about which Menchel and ‘Villafafia. disagreed, but: given. OPR’s conclusion that the Department did not: require
prosceutors to consult. with victims before charges were brought, OPR. does not. reach, a conclusion ‘regarding the
alleged meeting:and instruction.
