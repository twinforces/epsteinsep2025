II. The Government Lacks Standing.

A party lacks standing'to challenge a, subpoena issucd to.a third party absent a claim of
privilege or a proprictary interest ‘in the subpocnacd matter. Langford 'v. Chrysler Motor

The government docs not'acknowledge, however, that in.Ra\ the court. denied. it standing‘to
move to quash the subpoena.
