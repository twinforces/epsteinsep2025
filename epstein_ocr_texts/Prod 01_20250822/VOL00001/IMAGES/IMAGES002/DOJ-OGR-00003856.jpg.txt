I. The Government Lacks Standing

A party lacks standing to challenge a subpoena issued to a third party absent a claim of
privilege or a proprietary interest in the subpoenaed matter. Langford v. Chrysler Motor

defense subpoenas would implicate this interest. Moreover, the defendant has no reason to
