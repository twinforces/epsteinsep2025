Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 295 Filed 05/25/21 Page 21 of 26

VI. A Bill of Particulars Is Not Warranted,

The defendant: again secks a bill of particulars, this time related'to, Counts Five and Six. of
the S2 Indictment. Because the Government has:provided the defendant: with more than.sufficient
‘information—through both the’'S2 Indictment and discovery—to understand the charges ‘against.
her, to:prepare.a defense, and, to protect. against, double jeopardy, this motion. should be denied.
The instant-motion.sccks essentially the same'type of details that the:defendant-sought. with regards
to Counts; One through, Four, inher prior motions.. For the same reasons that-the: Court denied. that.
prior motion, this motion, should also be denied. (Sée.Apr. Op. at 19).

The proper purpose of a bill of particulars ‘under‘Fedcral Rule of Criminal ‘Procedure 7(f)
is “to ‘provide defendant with information about the details,of the charge: against. him if this is
necessary to the preparation of his defense, and to avoid prejudicial.surprise-at trial.” United States
vs ‘Lorres, 901 F.2d 205, 234 (2d Cir. 1990), abrogated, on other grounds by United States: v.
Maréiis, 628 F.3d 36, 41 (2d Cir. 2010); (emphasis added) (internal. quotation marks omitted).
Accordingly, “[a] bill of particulars. is required. ‘only where the charges of the ‘indictment. are so
general that they do not;advise the defendant of the specific acts of which. he is aceused.’” United
States v. Walsh, 194 F.3d:37, 47 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting, .orres, 90.1 F.2d at 234); see United
States'y. Mahabub, No. 13 Cr, 908 (AJN), 201.4 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D!N.Y. Aug. 26, 2014).

As‘was the case with, the charges contained in the prior indictment, the charges contained
in. Counts Five and Six. of'the $2: Indictment are clear from the face of the charging instrument,
which provides significant:detail. Asis apparent, from the 23-page speaking S2.Indictment, Counts
Five and Six concern ‘the defendant’s participation. in a conspiracy to comimit.’scx trafficking of
minors with Epstein and her participation in, and aiding and abetting of, the scx trafficking, of a
particular minor identified as Minor Victim-4 with Epstein from approximately. 2001, through,

2004.
