VI. A Bill of Particulars Is Not Warranted

The defendant again seeks a bill of particulars, this time related to Counts Five and Six of
the S2 Indictment. Because the Government has provided the defendant with more than sufficient
information—through both the S2 Indictment and discovery—to understand the charges against
her, to prepare a defense, and to protect against double jeopardy, this motion should be denied.
The instant motion seeks essentially the same type of details that the defendant sought with regards
to Counts One through Four in her prior motions. For the same reasons that the Court denied that
prior motion, this motion should also be denied. (See Apr. Op. at 19).

The proper purpose of a bill of particulars under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(f)
is “to provide defendant with information about the details of the charge against him if this is
necessary to the preparation of his defense, and to avoid prejudicial surprise at trial.” United States
v. Torres, 901 F.2d 205, 234 (2d Cir. 1990), abrogated on other grounds by United States v.
Marcus, 628 F.3d 36, 41 (2d Cir. 2010) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Accordingly, “[a] bill of particulars is required ‘only where the charges of the indictment are so
general that they do not advise the defendant of the specific acts of which he is accused.’” United
States v. Walsh, 194 F.3d 37, 47 (2d Cir. 1999) (quoting Torres, 901 F.2d at 234); see United
States v. Mahabub, No. 13 Cr. 908 (AJN), 2014 WL 4243657, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 26, 2014).

As was the case with the charges contained in the prior indictment, the charges contained
in Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment are clear from the face of the charging instrument,
which provides significant detail. As is apparent from the 23-page speaking S2 Indictment, Counts
Five and Six concern the defendant’s participation in a conspiracy to commit sex trafficking of
minors with Epstein and her participation in, and aiding and abetting of, the sex trafficking of a
particular minor identified as Minor Victim-4 with Epstein from approximately 2001 through
2004.
