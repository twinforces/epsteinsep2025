and will not agree to’ this.
It is. the intent of this Office:to treat this matter like, anyother case.

Acosta told OPR that:this was a polite way. of-chastising Lefkowitz for:mischaracterizing
what Acosta said during the breakfast mecting. Although OPR could, not find, evidenee that ‘the:
letter was sent'to Lefkowitz, OPR nonctheless considers it:persuasive:cvidence'that: Acosta, shortly
after the. breakfast mecting, disagréed ‘with Lefkowitz’s. description of their discussions aiid had
discussed. those disagreements with. Sloman.

Nevertheless, OPR, examined ‘the three Specific concessions that, Lefkowitz described, in.
the breakfast mecting, First, Lefkowit7 claimed that Acosta agreed doring the breakfast’ rioting
that ‘he did not intend ‘to jinterfere with the: state’s handling of the case. Contemporancous
documents show that well before the breakfast mecting, Acosta had expressed the view that‘he did.
not want to “dictate” actions to ‘the: State Attorney or ‘the state court: ‘For example, during’ the: NPA.
negotiations, Acosta,asked Villafafia'to “soften” certain language that,appcared to'require the State
Attorncey’s Office or the staté court'to:take, specific actions, such as.requiring that-_Epstcin enter his
guilty: plea. or report ‘to begin. serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta ‘may: have:
made a, statement during, the breakfast mecting expressing his disinclination. to interfere with the:
state’s proceedings, such a statement would, have been a. reiteration of his prior position on, the
‘subject, rather than, any new concession.

Lefkowitz also'claimed in his October 23, 2007 letterthat Acosta agreed not.to:contact any
of the victims ‘or. potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully: in.
Chapter Three, OPR concludes that. the decision not:to notify the victims about the NPA, did not.
stem, from, the breakfast mecting, but rather reflected, an, assessment of multiple issues and.
considerations discussed, internally by the subjects who participated iin that, decision: Acosta,
‘Sloman, and Villafana.

Finally, Lefkowitz’s October 23 letter ‘suggested. that. Acosta had agreed. not.fo intervene
regarding ‘the sentence Epstcin reecived from the ‘state court, and. it asserted that Epstein was
“entitled to any type of sentence available to, him, including, but.not limited to gain time: and ‘work’
release.” Later cominitiications between ‘the, USAO and defense counsel, however, show’ clearly
that Acosta did not. abandon the NBA's expels sentencing provision. The:NPRA, required Epstein.
although ‘the parties understood. that. he would. receive: othe: same: “gain time” benefits available to
all state inmates. After the October breakfast mecting, Sloman and Villafafia, on. behalf of the
USAO, repeatedly made clear that :it'would hold. Epstein to that requirement, and. the USAO also
subsequently ‘insisted that Epstein was ineligible for: work release. ‘For example, i ina. ‘November 5,
his aercement:to plead guilty to the specified. charges ‘and-to make a ‘binding recommendation that
the Court impose.a sentence of 18 months of continious confinement in the county jail.” Shortly’
before Epstein entered his plea in. June: 2008, Villafafia wrote to the State Attorney to, remind him
that the NPA required Epstein to plead. in-state court to an offense that..required an. 18-month.
