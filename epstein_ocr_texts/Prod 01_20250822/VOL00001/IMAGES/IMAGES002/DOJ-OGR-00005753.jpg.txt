e Any testimony about the nature and structure of alleged conspiracies, or the nature
and structure of alleged sex trafficking operations. See United States v. Daly, 842
F.2d 1380 (2d Cir. 1988) (testimony about the nature and structure of organized crime
is expert opinion testimony); see also Mejia, 545 F.3d at 189-92.

e Any testimony purporting to interpret the communications of others or “codes.” See
United States v. Levasseur, 816 F.2d 37, 45 (2d Cir. 1987) (testimony about the
meaning of messages written in code is expert opinion testimony); United States v.
Borrone-Iglar, 468 F.2d 419, 421 (2d Cir. 1972) (testimony “concerning the narcotics
vernacular used in [recorded] telephone conversations” is expert opinion testimony).

e Any testimony vouching for or bolstering the credibility of witnesses. United States v.

Cruz, 981 F.2d 659, 662-63 (2d Cir. 1992) (improper for an expert to bolster
government fact-witness’ credibility because such bolstering is irrelevant and
prejudicial).

e Any “opinion about whether [Ms. Maxwell] did or did not have a mental state or

condition that constitutes an element of the crime charged or of a defense. Those
matters are for the trier of fact alone.” Fed. R. Evid. 704(b); see United States v.
Haynes, 729 F.3d 178, 196 (2d Cir. 2013) (“Testimony regarding whether the
defendant ‘realized’ that there were drugs in the car was erroneously admitted
because it is expert testimony about the defendant’s state of mind.”’).

The above list is merely an example of the types of expert opinions law enforcement
officers often try to offer at trial. Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, though, any opinion
testimony that is based on ys specialized “training and
experience” is expert opinion testimony subject to Rule 702 and Rule 16(1)(G) and is
inadmissible at trial. Garcia, 413 F.3d at 216.

If the testimony of the government’s law enforcement officers is not properly limited, it
is “likely to give [their] factual testimony an ‘unmerited credibility’ before the jury.” Mejia, 545
F.3d at 192 (2d Cir. 2008). See also United States v. Alvarez, 837 F.2d 1024, 1030 (11th Cir.
1988) (“When the expert is a government law enforcement agent testifying on behalf of the

especially problematic because juries may place greater weight on evidence

perceived to have the imprimatur of the government.

United States v. Casas, 356 F.3d 104, 119-20 (1st Cir. 2004).
