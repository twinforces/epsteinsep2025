Tl. At Minimum, the Government Must: Demonstrate the Admissibility:of Evidence

Regarding Accuser-3 Pursuant to Fed. R.. Evid.:404(b).

The government apparently doesnot dispute its obligation to demonstrate. the
admissibility of Accuser-3’s testimony as “other act” evidence under Fed. R- Evid. 404(b).
Litigation.of the admissibility.of this evidence is premature, and Ms. Maxwell reserves the right
to challenge it at the appropriate juncture. Ms. Maxwell-notes,, however, that ‘the:government’s
argument that such evidence is admissible under Fed. 'R. Evid. 404(b), suffers from the:same
flaws as its argument*that'Ms. Maxwell’s intéractions. regarding Accusér-3 constitute an overt
act.

The government. claims Accuser-3’s testimony is ‘admissible to show Ms. Maxwell’s
“knowledge, intent, and. modus operandi.” Opp. 158 (emphasis in. original). The government’s
very use of those terms, however, betrays an implication that Ms. Maxwell's interactions with.
Accuser-3 were somehow unlawful. Any knowledge or'intent on Ms. Maxwell’s:part that’
Epstein. would engage in:consensual sexual activity with Accuser-3, or any method by which she
purportedly persuaded. Accuser-3 to engage'in such lawful conduct, has no bearing on whether

Ms. Maxwell knéw or intended Accuser-1. or Accuser-2 to engage in vinlawfiil: sexual activity:

issues. more fully-in connection. with her evidentiary motions.
