opposition to these:meetings, but we:are simply looking at this: case
as‘a;violent crime prosecution involving 'stiff penaltics rather than as.
a ‘white collar’ or ‘public corruption case ‘where the parties can
amicably work: out alight’ sentence.”

With respect to the “policy: reasons” that Lefcourt wants to: discuss,
those were:already raised.in,his letter (which.is;part of the indictment
‘package) and. during’ his meeting ‘with Andy’ and myself. Those
reasons are? (1) he wants’ the Petit’ [sic] ‘policy to trump ‘our ability
‘to prosecute: Epstein, (2) this: shouldn’t be a federal offense, and
(3) the victims ‘were ‘willing participants so the crime: shouldn’t ‘be
‘prosecuted at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those
arguments will be:persuasive, a mecting will not-be beneficial to the
‘prosecution, it will only benefit the défense. With ‘respect to
Lefcourt’s promised Icgal. analysis, that also has already been
provided. The: only way to get. additional analysis is to expose to the
defense the other charges that we are-considering. In my opinion

email, to Sloman, or: Menchel ‘because Villafafia could, be viewed as insubordinate. She also told.
Villafana thatif Villafafia did-not stay with the case, “the case would.go away” and Epstein “would,
never sérvée.a day’in jail.”

Villafafia, told OPR. that, at that. point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file
charges against. Epstein despite: agrecing to accommodate the defense request. for mectings. She
also told'OPR, on. the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going down the same path that.
the State Attorney’s Office had gone down.” Villafafia belicved the purpose of the defense request
