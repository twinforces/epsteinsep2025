from. Villafafia. and. others, but given the highly’unusual ‘procedure being’ considered, his decision,
‘should, have: been. ‘made: only after a full consideration of, all of the, possible ramifications and,
consequences of pushing the matter into the state court system, ‘with which ‘neither: Villafafia, nor
the other subjects had cxperienec, along with consideration ofthe legal and evidentiary:issucs and
possible means of overcoming those issucs. OPR did not find ‘evidence indicating that: such. a.
mecting or discussion, with the full team was held ‘before the decision’ was made to. pursue: the
state-bascd. resolution, before the decision was made to offer a two-year term, of incarecration, or
before the NPA, with its ‘unusual. terms, was, signed. As Acosta. later recognized and told. OPR,
“And a question that, think 1s a-valid one 'in my mind. is, did the focus on, let’s just get this done:
and. get a jail term, mean that'we didn’t take a-step back and say, lct?s evaluate: how: this train. is
moving?”

Many. features of the NPA ‘were given inadequate consideration, including core provisions
like the term of:incarceration.and sexual offender-registration, with the:result' that Epstein was able:
to:manipulate the process to his benefit. Members of his-scnior staff-held differing opinions about.
some of the issues that Acosta felt were important. and ‘that..factored into his decision-making.
There does notseem, to be a'point, however, at which those differing opinions were considered.
when forming a strategy; rather, Acosta-scems to have made a decision that everyone beneath him,
followed and.attempted. to. implement but without a.considered strategy beyond attaining the:three
core:clements. As’the, U.S. Attorney, Acosta had authority to procecd.in-this mariner, but-many of
the problems that developed. with the NPA might have been avoided. with a more thoughtful.

was ill conceived from the start-and thatthe NPA resulted from a flawed decision-making: process.
From the time: the USAO opened. its investigation, Acosta recognized ‘the: federal, interest in,
prosecuting Epstein, yet. after that investigation. had run. for more than. ‘a, year, he sct: the
investigation on. a, path not' originally contemplated. Having doné so, he. had ‘responsibility for

line AUSA and the FBI casc agents dissatisficd but.also caused ’victims and the public to question,
the motives of the prosécutors and whether any ‘rcasonable measure of justice was achieved.
Accordingly, OPR ‘concludes that. Acosta exercised. poor judgment in that. he chose..a course of
action that was in.marked contrast to the: action. that. the Department-would reasonably expect.an.
attorney. exercising good. judgment to take.

In commenting on OPR’s draft report; Acosta’s attorney acknowledged that “(t]he matter would have
‘benefited trom.more consistent staffing and-attention.”
