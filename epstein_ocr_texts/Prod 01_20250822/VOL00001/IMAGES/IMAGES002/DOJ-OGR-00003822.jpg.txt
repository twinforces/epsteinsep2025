1 review so you are aware of the ongoing investigation. But it

2 is my view that that needs to be protected.

3 As you probably know, the history of these cases with
4 Mr. Epstein, there were a variety of things that went on in

5 that investigation, so there is reason to keep an investigation
6 in this situation protected so that they can properly

7 investigate and move forward with that without being inhibited
8 by other individuals. Your Honor, I would ask that that remain
9 protected. It's covered by her very, very broad requests,

10 which is why we had to lodge those objections. I would

Le appreciate your Honor considering our arguments with respect to
12 that issue.
18 The other things, your Honor, that she has raised is,
14 for example, she had asked for the Epstein settlement agreement
15 and that was one of the things that she asked for. We agreed
16 to produce that if we got the waiver from Mr. Epstein because
V7 we can't produce it without that waiver.

18 I believe that covers it, your Honor. If you have any
19 questions, I would be happy to answer them.
20 THE COURT: Thanks very much.
21 Thank you all for all the clarification that you've
22 given me. I much appreciate it.
23. With respect to the retainers and the dates of
24 representation, that information will be provided for any
25 attorney that's listed on the privilege log.
