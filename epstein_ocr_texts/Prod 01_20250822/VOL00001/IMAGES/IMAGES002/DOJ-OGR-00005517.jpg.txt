MAXWELL’S STATEMENTS IS PREMATURE AND SHOULD BE DENIED AT

THIS TIME

Hearsay: is a statement:that: (1) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current:
‘trial or hearing; and (2) a‘party offers in cvidence to:prove the truth of the matter.asserted in the
statement. Fed. R. Evid. 801 .-Hearsay is not admissible unless allowed bya federal. statute; the
Federal Rules of Evidence or other-rules prescribed by the Supreme Court. Fed.'R., Evid. 802.
“The hearsay rule is designed'to prevent the admission of unreliable hearsay but to permit
through its. many exceptions the:admission. of reliable:hearsay.” erriery. Duckworth, 902 F.2d
545,547 (7th Cir.), cert: denied, 498°U.S. 988 (1990).

Counsel for Ms. Maxwell. understand the Federal Rules of Evidence and intend to, follow:
them. Notably; there arc dozens of exceptions to:the hearsay exclusionary rule, many ‘of which
could be applicable at.any trial. in this case, for'example, those contained in, Fed. R. Evid. 803(1)
through 803(23).. Ms. Maxwell has not:moved in /imine:to admit any: hearsay: statement, and the
government docs not identify any statement made by Ms. Maxwell that it believes will be at
issuc in'this trial. Basically, the government:is asking the Court to enter an order dirécting’the
partics to follow the Rules. of-Evidence.

The failure of the government-to identify any statement or circumstance where a
Statement might be offered makes it:impossible for the Court to rule onthe admissibility ofthis
unknown evidence. As noted by the court in Veles v. Novartis Pharms. Corp., No. 04 CLV. 9194
‘CM, 2010 WL 11043081, at.*6(S.D.N.Y.. Feb. 25, 2010), the “motion to cxelude hearsay"... is
ycet-another example ‘of the improper use of in. /imine motions. . . °” Denying the motion, the
court directed the following solution: “Ifa witness is asked. for hearsay testimony, an attorney...

should.stand up and, object, and, the Court? will rule.” 7d.
