Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 385 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page6of12
229 at 3. This Court then ordered the Government to provide disclosure of any “Rule 404(b)
evidence and notice” by October 11. Dkt. 297.

On October 11, 2021, the Government served on defense counsel a short letter entitled
the “Maxwell Rule 404(b) letter’ (the “Rule 404(b) Letter” or the “Letter’’), attached as Exhibit
A. Init, the Government referenced two sets of evidence: (2)

(b) a Witness i who worked for Epstein between ggg (after the
conclusion of the charged conspiracy) whom the Government said it “may call” at trial. The
Government asserted in the Letter that the evidence collectively was, in its opinion, “direct
evidence of the crimes charged and, in the alternative, pursuant to Rule 404(b) as proof of the
defendant's intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, and/or absence of mistake of (sic)
accident.” /d. at2. The Government stated it would not be moving in /imine to seek the
evidence's admission "[b]ecause this evidence is admissible as direct evidence." Jd. The Letter
lacked identification of any particular purpose for these two categories of evidence and lacked
any "basis for concluding that the evidence is relevant in light of this purpose."

Also on October 11, the Government provided its anticipated trial exhibits. Even a quick
review of those exhibits reflects the Government's apparent intent to offer numerous documents
and other evidence that purportedly occurred after the conclusion of the charged conspiracy.

See, e.g., GX-4-D through GX-4-K (message pads dated beginning in 2005); GX-423 (an
Amazon shipment to Jeffrey Epstein of an iPhone USB lightning cable in 2013); GX-501 & 502
(financial statements from June 2007); GX-661 & 662 (flight logs from 2005-13). None of these
items of evidence were mentioned in the Maxwell Rule 404(b) Letter. The Government's theory
of admissibility concerning this post-2004 evidence remains unclear.
