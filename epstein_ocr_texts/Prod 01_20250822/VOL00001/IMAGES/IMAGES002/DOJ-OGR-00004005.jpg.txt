The Defendant ‘argues that Requests 1 through 5 are nota fishing expedition. merely
because the government has admitted. “that there were, in fact mectings and. communications
between these individuals and the: USAO-SDNY about Ms..Maxwell and [7] and.
because Virginia Giuffre logged a, number of: communications on a ‘privilege log in 2016. Resp.
Ltr. at 2,3. This docs:not get the Requests over Nixon's hurdles—the Defendant is still attempting:
to fish through. BSF’s communications ‘in, the hopes that. something relevant and admissible turns
‘up, without. setting forth the relevance and admissibility as ‘to cach document. she secks. Further
the privilege log does not, as the Defendant insinuates, reference communications: between BSF
and, the U.S. Attorney as defined in the Subpoena, as the log references only an,unspecified “law
enforcement agency.” Jd. at.4.

B. The Defendant Has Not Demonstrated-Relevance and.Admissibility.

The Court’s.analysis docs not-stop ‘at‘specificity—Requests | through 5 independently fail
bécause'the Defendant has not demonstrated: that all of the communications she seeks aré relevant’
and admissible. The Defendant’s sole:basis for contending that the wide array of communications
she secks are: all relevant. to her defense is that the communications are relevant to “two motions
to suppress based.on misrepresentations: made. by: the government to Chicf Judge McMahon.and:a
motion, to dismiss. the: indictment for prejudicial delay” because: they “would. establish the
substance and frequency’ of the communications between BSE and.the government prior to the
government’s end run. around Martindell.” Resp. ‘Ltr. at‘6-7. But the Defendant has not met her
burden of demonstrating relevance and ‘admissibility.

First, because. Rule 1.7’s “purpose is trial-focused,” a Rule 17(c) subpoena “may be ‘used.
‘only to. obtain materials admissible: as evidence af trial?” United States v. Louis, No. 04 Cr. 203

(LTS), 2005 WL. 180885, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2005) (emphasis added); see also. United States
