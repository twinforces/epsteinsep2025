Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

Maxwell’s motions to suppress evidence (Dkt. Nos. 133, 139) are DENIED. The Court
sets out its reasoning in an opinion concurrently filed under temporary seal to allow Maxwell and
the Government the opportunity to propose redactions. The parties may file under seal any
proposed redactions to the opinion within three days.

The Court further ORDERS that the April 9, 2019 memorandum decision and order on
the Government’s application to modify the protective order in Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 15-cv-
7433, as well as the transcripts of the March 26, 2019 and April 9, 2019 ex parte hearings on that
application shall be unsealed. These documents were previously filed under seal as Exhibits D,
E, F, and G to the memorandum of law in support of Maxwell’s first motion to suppress (Dkt.
No. 134). Within one week, the parties shall confer and file under seal any proposed redactions
to the memorandum decision, order, and transcripts.

Any proposed redactions shall be narrowly tailored and shall be supported with reference
to the Second Circuit’s opinion in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.
2006). The parties’ proposed redactions should not include any information that has already
been made public.
