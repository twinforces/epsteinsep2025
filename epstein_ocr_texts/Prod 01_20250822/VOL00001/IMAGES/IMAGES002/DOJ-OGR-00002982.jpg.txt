concluded. that. “the: evidence does :not show that [Former. USAO-SDEL U.S. Attorney Alex]
Acosta, [Former USAO-SDFL supervisor Andrew] Louric, or Villafafia. agreed, to the
nonprosccution provision to. protect ary of Epstcin’s political, celebrity, or other influential
associates.” OPR.Report at 168. N

In. view of OPR’s conelusions—and. in, the absenec. of any evidence ‘to the contrary
proffered by the defendant—the defendant has failed to establish, that ‘that. she. ‘was. an intended

C. The Defendant Has Offered No Basis for Additional Discovery or ‘a Hearing

The defendant’s: motion :for discovery and a hearing fares no better. Lacking any:
evidence—much less any: legal authority—that. the NPA, applics to this District or the crimes. in

the Indictment, the defendant asks ‘the Court to order discovery and,conduct.a hearing. In short,

' The OPR Report, further reflects that ‘in, OPR’s interview of Villafaiia, she reported that she did.
not have anyone:in mind,aside from. the: four individuals named in the ““co-conspirator’*provision:
“Villafafia told OPR that. she’ was willing to include:a non-prosccution provision for Epstein’s co-
conspirators, who at the ‘tinic she ‘understood to be ‘the. four women named. in ‘the proposed.
agrecment, because the USAO was not interested. in. ‘prosecuting those ‘individuals. if Epstein.
entered a plea. Villafafia told. OPR, ‘[W]e:considered Epstein, to be the top of the food chain, and.
we wouldn’t have been, interested in-prosceuting anyone else.’ She did not consider the. possibility
that Epstcin, might be trying to protect other, unnamed individuals, and:no onc, including the FBI
cas¢ agents, raised. that coricern.” OPR Report at 70. Further, the OPR Report’ notes, that:

“Villafafia told OPR that, apart from the: women named in the NPA, the ‘investigation had not
deyeloped. evidence of ‘any other potential. co- conspirators. Id. at 81. Similarly, the report:
reflects that.a supervisor at USAO-SDFL told.OPR “that it never occurred to him.that the reference
to potential co-conspirators, was directed toward any’ of the high-profile individuals who, werc at:
the time or subsequently linked with Epstcin?” OPR Report at.80-81.

i, Although the:defendant-correctly notes that the:OPR Report reflects that the prosecutor remarked.
that Epstein “wanted.to make sure’ that.he’s the only one who takes the blame. for what. happened,”

OPR Report at 167, that desire: explains the existence of the “co-conspirator” provision, but it does
not. inform its micaning or scope.
