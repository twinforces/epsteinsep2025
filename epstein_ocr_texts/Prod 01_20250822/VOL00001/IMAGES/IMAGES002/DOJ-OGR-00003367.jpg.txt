Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 191 of 348

With regard to ‘her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia.told-OPR that her goal
was to protect the anonymity of the victims. She:'said ‘that; the case was far: more ‘likely to be
covered. by the Palm Beach press, which had already written articles about: Epstein, than‘in Miami,
and “if [the victims] ‘wanted to attend [the plea, hearing], I wanted, them to be able to go into the
courthouse without their faces being: splashed all over the: newspaper.”

In.cvaluating the emails, OPR reviewed all;the email exchanges between, Villafania, as well
as Sloman and,Acosta; and Lefkowitz and other defense counsel, including the ‘portions redacted
from the ‘publicly released emails (except fora ‘few: to.or ‘from Acosta, copics. of Which. OPR. did.
not locate in. the USAO records).. OPR <also considered. the. emails in the broader context of
Villafafia’s overall, conduct during the ‘federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,
as’well,as witness and subjcet interviews, establishes that Villafafia consistently advocated in favor
of prosecuting Epstcin and ‘worked. for months. toward ‘that. goal. She repeatedly ‘pressed her:
supervisors for permission to indict Epstein and:made numerous ¢fforts to cxpand the scope of the
case. She opposed mectings with. the defense team, and nearly: withdrew. from. the case. because:
her supervisors agreed. to those mectings. Villafafia objected to the: decision. to resolve the ‘case
through a. guilty plea. in:state court, and she cngagcd in, a lengthy and heated email exchange with,
Menchel, about that: subject. ‘When. she was. assigned the: task: of creating’ an, agreement to effect.
that resolution, Villafana fought hard during the:cnsuing negotiations to hold the USAQ’s position
despite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.

OPR also considered statements. of her supervisors. regarding her interactions with defense
counsel. Sloman, ‘in ‘particular, told OPR that reports that Villafafia, “was.‘soft on, Epstein .
couldn’t have been further from the truth.” Sloman added that Villafafia “did her best.to ‘implement.
the decisions. that were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Louric similarly told OPR ‘that.
when he read the district. court’s February 2019 opinion. in. the CVRA. litigation and the emails
from. Villafafia. cited in that opinion, he: was: “surprised to sce how nice'she was to them. And.she
winds-up taking it on the chin.for being:so ‘nice to'them. ‘When I-know the whole time she was the
one'who'wanted to go, after him the most.” The AUSA‘who assisted Villafafia on the! investigation
told, OPR “everything that [Villafana] did . . . was, as far as 1 could tell, [ ] completely pro
prosecution.”

Because the emails. in question were publicly disclosed, without context and without other
information showing Villafafia’s consistent cfforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a.
‘public narrative developed that Villafana colluded, with defense counsel to, benefit Epstein. at the
expense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that.
narrative to be: inaccurate. The USAO’ s and. Villafafia’s. interactions with the victims can be:
criticized, as OPR ‘does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that-any missteps
Villafafia may fayem made in her interactions with vietins or r their attorneys were not made for the
about Epsteitt s victims. Before the NPA: Was. Sioned, ‘she raised to hot supervisors: the is Issué ‘of
consulting. with victims, and after ‘the NPA was Signed, she drafted fetters to notify victims
appear. The draft letters, led, defense counsel to argue: to ‘Department management that Villafana
and. Sloman committed ‘professional misconduct by: “threaten[ing] to send. a highly improper and
unusual ‘victim notification letter’ to all” of the listed’victims. Given'the-full. context of Villa faria’s
conduct'throughout.her tenure: on-the:case, OPR concludes that herexplanations: for her cmails.are
