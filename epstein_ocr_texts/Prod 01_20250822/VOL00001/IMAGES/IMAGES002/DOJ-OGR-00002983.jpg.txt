Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document.204 Filed. 04/16/21. Page 49 of 239

the defendant asks this Court, to authorize an. extensive and, burdensome fishing. expedition,
‘premised. on the defendant’s purée conjecture. The Court should deny the motion.

Although ‘the defendant. asserts that the Court is obligated. to conduct a hearing, she has
failed to establish,'that any hearing ‘is warranted. The defendant argues that: courts, conduct:
agrecment is in genuine:dispute.” (Def. Mot. | at.29). But the defendant has not.established any:
genuine factual dispute in this case that a hearing would be'required to resolve. The defendant. has
offered. bare :conclusions in. support. of her. motion, which are ‘refuted. by: governing law, record
evidence, and the four corners of the agreement itself. That is not.a'basis for a. hearing.

As the Sécond Circuit.explained. in Viited S1ates i. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, (2d Cir. 2002),
“a district court need ‘not conduct a. hearing every time a defendant summarily ‘accuses: the
government of failing to live up 'to' an.alleged bargain.” Jd. at 91. In that case,'the court held that:
a hearing was. required because, the defendant had submitted affidavits ‘from his attorney, as well.
as corroborating, affidavits from. other attorneys, and. the Government had. not. submitted any:
evidence. Jd; see.also United States Vv: Sattar, 272.F.. Supp. 2d 348, 383 (S.D.N-Y. 2003) (applying
Aleman, and:ordcring an evidentiary hearing based upon the.defendant’s submission.of an affidavit:
from an, attorney. with knowledge of the alleged oral agreement). Similarly, in United States v,
Feldman, 939 E.3d.182 (2d.Cir. 2019), the Second. Circuit held that a.hearing was ‘required. based.
‘on ‘the defendant’s uncontested assertions about specific: representations made to him by a
prosecutor. J/d.,at-1.84, 190. Here, by contrast, the defendant has offered ‘no evidenee in''support:
of her allegations.

The defendant: cannot seriously argue that she has made the type of showing that requires

a hearing: For'example, she has:not offered any affidavits from Epstcin’s former defense attorneys
