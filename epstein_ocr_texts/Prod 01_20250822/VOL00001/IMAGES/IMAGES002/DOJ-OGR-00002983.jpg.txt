Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 49 of 239
the defendant asks this Court to authorize an extensive and burdensome fishing expedition,
premised on the defendant’s pure conjecture. The Court should deny the motion.

Although the defendant asserts that the Court is obligated to conduct a hearing, she has
failed to establish that any hearing is warranted. The defendant argues that courts conduct
evidentiary hearings “where the existence or scope of a plea agreement or non-prosecution
agreement is in genuine dispute.” (Def. Mot. 1 at 29). But the defendant has not established any
genuine factual dispute in this case that a hearing would be required to resolve. The defendant has
offered bare conclusions in support of her motion, which are refuted by governing law, record
evidence, and the four corners of the agreement itself. That is not a basis for a hearing.

As the Second Circuit explained in United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d 86 (2d Cir. 2002),
“a district court need not conduct a hearing every time a defendant summarily accuses the
government of failing to live up to an alleged bargain.” /d. at 91. In that case, the court held that
a hearing was required because the defendant had submitted affidavits from his attorney, as well
as corroborating affidavits from other attorneys, and the Government had not submitted any
evidence. /d.; see also United States v. Sattar, 272 F. Supp. 2d 348, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (applying
Aleman, and ordering an evidentiary hearing based upon the defendant’s submission of an affidavit
from an attorney with knowledge of the alleged oral agreement). Similarly, in United States v.
Feldman, 939 F.3d 182 (2d Cir. 2019), the Second Circuit held that a hearing was required based
on the defendant’s uncontested assertions about specific representations made to him by a
prosecutor. /d. at 184, 190. Here, by contrast, the defendant has offered no evidence in support
of her allegations.

The defendant cannot seriously argue that she has made the type of showing that requires
a hearing. For example, she has not offered any affidavits from Epstein’s former defense attorneys
