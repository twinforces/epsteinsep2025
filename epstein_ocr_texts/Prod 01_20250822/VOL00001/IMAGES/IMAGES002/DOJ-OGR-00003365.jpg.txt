sentence of incarceration, andthe: USAO-would consider a plea that:differed from that requirement
‘a, breach. ofthe NPA, and would “procced. accordingly.”

The guilty plea Epstein-enteréd :in state, court in.June 2008 was. consistent with the dictates
‘of the. NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed. a:scntence of 18 months’ incarceration.
Epstein, however, applicd. for and was accepted into the work, release program, and. was able: to
‘serve..a, substantial portion, of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference: work,
release nor authorize Epstcin to receive such benefits during’his tenure at/thc; Palm Beach County’
Stockade. Morcover, Villafana réccived assurances:from defense counsel that Epstein would serve
his entire sentenec of:confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein.
work: release privileges during his incarceration, rested ‘with istate officials, who had the sole
authority for administering the work: release’program.

After considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made. after Acosta’s
‘October 12,.2007 breakfast mecting with Lefkowitz, OPR found nothing in-the record:to suggest.
that the mecting resulted. in, a material. change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served.
pursuant to the NPA, or-contributed.to state officials’ decision to permit;him, to participate in work.

Villafana’s ‘Emails with. Defense Attorney Lefkowitz during the NPA.
Negotiations Do Not Establish That Villafana, or Other Subjects, Intended to
Give Epstein Preferential ‘Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or
Other Improper Influences

During the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstcin’s attorney, and filed
under seal, a.redacted serics.of email exchanges between.Epstein attorney’ Lefkowitz:and Villafafia.
(and. others with, Acosta.and Sloman), during September 2007 when the NPA was being finalized,
and. thereafter. These cmails, had been. redacted. to: delete. most of Lefkowitz’s side of’ the
communications, and consequently they did not, reflect, ‘the full context of Villafafia’s
communications to Lefkowitz. ‘The.redacted emails. were later unsealed and. made public over
Epstein’s ‘objections. 236 Media coverage’ ‘pointed. to the content and. tonc.of Villafafia’s cmails as
proof that. Villafafia, and. the USAO. worked. in concert. with Epstcin’s attorneys to keep the
“sweetheart” deal ‘a, seeret from. the victims and the public. Statements, in, several ‘emails in.
particular were cited as. evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism towards Epstein. If one
example, Villafania told Lefkowitz that she. was Willing to inelude in.the NPA .a provision.agrecing
not:to prosecute.others, but would.“‘prefer:not to. highlight. for the judge all. of the.other crimes and.
all of the other persons that-we could charge.” ‘She also offered. to mect with him “‘offcampus””
to finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an “avoid the press’ note,” that. filing federal
charges, against Epstein in. Miami rather'than West. Palm Beach, would substantially’ reduce’ press
covcrage.
