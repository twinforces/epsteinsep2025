thus, that the Court need not resolve Request 10 at: this time, as the Court. will likely be able: to
deny: it as moot ‘in, the near term.
C. Request:11.

Request.‘ appears to scck a. series of photographs. ‘The Government?s ‘understanding is
that the defendant already has copies of those photographs. (Se@'4/2/2.1 Letter from.Def., Dkt. No.
244 at. 11 (“[C]Jopies were produced by BSF «in civil. litigation.”)). (It also appears that the
Government also produced. copies, of some: of'these photographs in Rule 16 discovery. In any:
event, and again, although, the Government. is not obligated ‘to. do So, the Government requested
and. produced to the defendant.

Remaining at issue, then, are only the original versions of the photographs. ‘The
Government understands from BSF that the photographs were all taken on film and.are not digital,
‘photographs. Accordingly; the originals are physical. photographs, not digital files. The: defense
subpoena for these original photographs should be denied, at least unless. and, until the defendant.
provides further justification, for the need ‘for and entitlement ‘to the originals. Because. the
defendant already has copics of the photographs, the defendant. must. explain, how her request for
the originals can satisfy: the Nixon test without’being “otherwise’procurable.” 418 U.S. at:699.

The defendant suggests that:she needs the ortginals to identify the “dates of creation or any’
other specifics.” (4/2/21 Letter from Def.,-Dkt. No. 244 at 11). It is entirelyunclear-what “other
specifics” refers to, but as noted above, the Government-understands that these photographs were
‘taken on film, such that: the originals ‘would. generally not;contain metadata regarding the date or
other information. regarding when they were taken. And in. any event, the defendant has: not

explained the relevance or ‘admissibility of this information—and specifically, whether it would.
