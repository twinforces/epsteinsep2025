C. Request 11

Request 11 appears to seek a series of photographs. The Government’s understanding is
that the defendant already has copies of those photographs. (See 4/2/21 Letter from Def., Dkt. No.
244 at 11 (“[C]lopies were produced by BSF in civil litigation.”)). It also appears that the
Government also produced copies of some of these photographs in Rule 16 discovery. In any

provides further justification for the need for and entitlement to the originals. Because the
defendant already has copies of the photographs, the defendant must explain how her request for
the originals can satisfy the Nixon test without being “otherwise procurable.” 418 U.S. at 699.

specifics” refers to, but as noted above, the Government understands that these photographs were
taken on film, such that the originals would generally not contain metadata regarding the date or
other information regarding when they were taken. And in any event, the defendant has not
explained the relevance or admissibility of this information—and specifically, whether it would
