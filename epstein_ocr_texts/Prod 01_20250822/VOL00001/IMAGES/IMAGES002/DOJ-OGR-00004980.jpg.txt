Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 6of14

no indication that'Maxwell was even. a subject.of the Florida investigation. The Double Jeopardy
endured. neither. Thus, the Double: Jeopardy Clause does:not bar the charges against: her.

Despite facing no'prior prosecution or punishment; herself, Maxwell contends that'she iis
immune from prosecution, because Epstein was. alrcady*punished, forthe. same conspiracy. The
‘cases she cites, however, deal with succcssive’prosecutions of a, particular defendant: for the: same
conspiracy; not scparate prosecutions of individual co-conspirators. See, é:¢.; United States, v:
Lopez, 356 F.3d 463,469 (2d:Cir..2004). The Double Jeopardy Clause does: not require all co-
conspirators be tried. together for related offenses. See Zafiro v. United,States,506'U.S. 534,539
(1993); United, States v., Hinton, 543 F.2d,1002, 1014 (2d Cir. 1976). Whether'the Government
could have charged Epstcin.again. in this case has nothing,to do with. Maxwell’s rights: under the:
Double Jeopardy Clause.

Maxwell. finally’points'to oné case. in Which the Second Circuit held ‘that:a subsequent
prosccution might not’be permissible against a defendant whose charges were dismissed after her
husband:pleaded guilty. Dkt. No. 293:at 19. (citing United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 609
F.2d 603 (2d Gir. 1979)). However, the Court agrees: withthe Government-that.the result in.
Cambindo Valencia rested on the terms of the husband’s ‘plea agreement, not the Double
Jeopardy Clause. See Cambindo Valencia, 609 F.2d at 638. No precedent stands ‘for the
proposition that an:uncharged ‘co-conspirator is put in. jeopardy when another co-conspirator.
accepts a:non-prosecution. agreement. ‘This is the first;case in which Maxwell will be putin,

jeopardy for these. offenses, arid-so'this prosecution docs not:put her in jeopardy’a sccond,time.
