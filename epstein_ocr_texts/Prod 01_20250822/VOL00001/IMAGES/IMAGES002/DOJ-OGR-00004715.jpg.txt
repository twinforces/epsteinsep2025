this’phrase‘is entirely misplaced. ‘That.phrase appcars.in a specific portion of the Second Circuit’s
Opinion, in Which the paricl rejected the defendants’ attempt. to, distinguish Abbamonte and Alessi
by saying that they were only secking the same protection.afforded by the Double Jeopardy Clause,
while Abhumonie. and Alessi, involved. protections greater than, the ‘Double Jeopardy ‘Clause.
Annabi, 771, F.2d at 672. In rejecting ‘that.argument, the Court explained:

never in ~ jeopardy’0 on, ‘the charges dismissed i in. n the ‘Eastern, District,
the:protection,they’now'scck under the plea agreement:is necessarily
broader than. that.accorded by the Double Jeopardy Clause. Second,
to the extent ‘that the appellants: rely: on.a claim that ‘the Clause, if

identical to those dismissed, the short 2 answer is ‘that. the pending

charges, covering conduct extending more than, {wo years beyond

the date of the period covered by the ‘dismissed, charges, are not the

conspiratorial agreement that underlay the charges dismissed ‘in the

Eastern District, the ‘allegation, that the conspiracy extended ‘for an

additional ‘two years suffices to show that. the new chargés are not

identical to the dismissed charges.
Jd. Asthe foregoing makes clear, the Second Circuit'did not in any way: qualify the plain-statement:
rule set forth in ‘its opinron. Rather, the Sccond. Circuit. addressed the defendant’s efforts to
distinguish precedent based. on:the Double-Jcopardy Clause and.cxplained why the Clause did not
preclude a prosecution in that.casc., In other words, this language in. Anmabi was cabined to an
analysis ‘under the Doublé Jeopardy Clause. As discussed.:in greater detail below, ‘the Double
Jcopardy Clause does not:preclude:a prosecution. in this case because Maxwell has not: previously
been.prosecuted for the offenses. in the S2 Indictment.

Ignoring the. Double Jeopardy language..in. Annabi, the déferdant argues that the phrase

“identical to the dismissed charges” somchow creates a.different rule of’ interpretation, for ‘plea.

agreements, under which, the Court. must; first.analyze the similarity. between, the NPA. and the S2
