Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21. Page 283 of 349

As discussed below, OPR. concludes that none of the subject attorneys violated a ‘clear and.
‘unambiguous duty under’ the'CVRA because the USAO‘resolved the Epstein investigation without:
a federal criminal. charge. In September 2007, when, the NPA‘ was signed, the Department-did not:
interpret CVRA rights, to attach, unless and until ‘federal charges liad been filed, and the federal
courts had. not'established.a clear and: ‘unambiguous standard applying the CVRA. before criminal
charges were brought. Pursuant to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR. does not. find.
professional misconduct unless a ‘subject. attorncy intentionally. or recklessly violated a clear and.
‘unambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR finds that. the subject attorneys’ conduct did not:risc to
the level..of professional misconduct. OPR névertheless coricludes that. the lack’ of consultation
was part of'a.scrics of government interactions with-victims that.ultimately led to public: and court
condemnation of the government’s treatment of the victims, reflected: ‘poorly: on the Department as
a. whole, and is contradictory to the Department’s mission to “minimize the frustration and.

confusion:that vietims of a-crime endure in its’ wake.

A. At the Time, No Clear and Unambiguous Standard. Required the USAO to
Notify. Victims Regarding Case-Related, Events until after the ‘Filing of
Criminal, Charges

Although the rights enumerated, in the CVRA are clear on. their facc, the threshold issue of
whether an individual qualifics as a victim. to-whom. CVRA rights attach.was neither :clear nor
unambiguous at the time:the USAO entered into'the. NPA. with Epstein in September 2007. Atthat

time, the Department. ‘interpreted the CVRA. in a way that. differed markedly from, the district
court?s later interpretation in,the CVRA litigation.

The CVRA. defines..a.“crime victim” as.“a person directly and proximately harmed as:a
result of the commission of:a Federal offense or an offense:in the District of Golumbia.” On April.
1, 2005, soon after the CVRA was enacted, OLE concluded that. “the status of a ‘crime victim’
may. be reasonably understood to commence: upon the filing of'a, criminal complaint, and that ‘the:
status énds. if there is a subsequent decision not to indict or prosécute the Federal offense that.
directly caused ‘the, victim’s harm.” Beginning with the 2005S:OLC guidance, the Department has
consistently, ‘taken ‘the position ‘that. CVRA. rights do not apply until the initiation. of criminal.
definition to all cight CVRA rights it in. effect i in 1.2005, but noted that the obligation created by the
eighth CVRA right=to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect” =is “always expected of Fedcral
officials, aid, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 [(VRRA)] indicates that this right
applics ‘throughout the criminal justice process. °2397 Consistent with the OLG interpretation, in.
May 2005, the Department issued the.2005 Guidelines to.implement the 'CVRA.

The 2005 ‘Guidelines assigned CVRA-rclated obligations ‘to, prosecutors only. after ‘the
initiation of federal charges. Specifically, the.2005 Guidelines stated that during the “prosecution,
stage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable efforts to notify identificd ‘victims: of,

‘had been.repealed upon passage of the CVRA.
