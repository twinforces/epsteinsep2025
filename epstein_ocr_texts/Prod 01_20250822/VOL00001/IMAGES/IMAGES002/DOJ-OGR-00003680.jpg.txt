about,the NPA’s ‘negotiation history in.the form of the OPR report.and yet identifics no evidenee
that the Department of Justice made any. promisés not contained in the NPA. The OPR report
reflects that the Office of the Deputy Attorney-General. reviewed the.NPA, but only after iit-was
signed when Epstein,tried.to get out of it. OPR Report at 103. Other documents show that
assistance but not for help negotiating the NPA. Dkt. No. 204-2. ‘Nor would direct approval of
‘the NPA by the Office of the Deputy: Attorney General change the mcaning ofits terms. No
evidence suggests anyone promised Epstcin-that the. NPA-would bar the prosecution of his co-
conspirators in other districts. Absent such a promise, it docs not matter who did.or did, not.
approve it.

Second Circuit precedent. creates a strong presumption that a plea agreement binds only
the U:S. Attorney’s office forthe district where it was.signed. Maxwell identifics nothing in the
NPA’s text or:negotiation history to disturb this presumption. The Court thus coneludcs ‘that ‘the.
NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of NewYork.

B. The non-prosecution agreement does not cover the:charged. offenses

The NPA would-provide Maxwell no defense to the charges in the S11 superseding
indictment.even, against an office’bound to follow it. ‘The’ NPA bars ’prosccution, following
Epstein’s fulfillment of its conditions, onlyfor three specific categorics of offenses:

(1) “the: offenses sct:out on pages |..and 2”.of the NPA; namely, “any offenses that

may have been. committed by Epstcin ‘against the United States from ‘in or around.
2001 through in or around September 2007” including five cnumerated offenses;

(2) “any: other offenses: that have been:the subject ofthe joint investigation by-the
Federal, Bureau. of Investigation and the United, States Attorney’s Office”; and.

(3) “any offenses that arose from the Federal Grand.Jury investigation.”
