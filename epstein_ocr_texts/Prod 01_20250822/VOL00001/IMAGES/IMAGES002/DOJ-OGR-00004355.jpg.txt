‘we are contemplating:so Dershowitz can tell’us why they:don’t apply:”*” Lourie told Menchel, “I.
don’t sec. the downside,” but added, “Maric jis against it.’ Menchel responded that it was

“premature” to provide the: information. During his-OPR interview, Menchel could not’specifically’
reeall’ why he belicved it was “premature” to provide the defense with the requested information,
but speculated that it was too soon after the prosecution memorandum. had been circulated for
Acosta to:have made a decision, about ‘how he wanted to proceed.. This recollection is consistent
with, the’ May‘2007 cmails:reflecting that Acosta wantcd.time to’ consider the proposcd.prosecution.

On May 22, 2007, defense, courisel Lefeourt emailed. Lourie, a letter to “corifirmn’’ ‘that.
Epstcin’s attorneys would. be given an opportunity to:mect with Louric before:the USAO:reached
a.final decision on. charging Epstein. Louric forwarded the Ictterto Menchel and.Sloman, but
noted.that Epstcin’s defense team was “really:ready for the next.level,” rather than another mecting
with him. Louric suggested that; Menchel mect with defense counscl, adding, “Whether Alex
would be present: or grant them another mecting after that is his call’? Lourie also emailed.
Lefcourt,, clarifying that Lourie: had not promiscd to call Epstein’s counsel before filing charges,
and suggesting x that Epstein’s. counsel :make thcir:next presentation to Menchel.

Although Lourie’s emails show that he had no objection. to'morce: senior USAO managers
meeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed. such.a mecting. Scveral cmails indicate. that.
Menchel.traveled to ‘West Palm Beach to. meet. with Louric and Villafafia on. the afternoon of
May 23, 2007.** ‘On. that same date, Villafafia drafted.an email, which she planned. to send, to
‘Sloman and:Menchel, expressing her disagreement with, mecting with defense counsel. Although,
the email, was written, for Sloman and ‘Menchcel, Villafafia. sent it-as a draft only to her immediate
supervisor, seeking her “guidance and counsel” as to how to ‘proceed.

Hi. Jeff and Matt — I just want to again.voice: my disagreement with
promising to have a mecting or having a.mecting with Lefcourt or.
any other of Epstcin’s attorneys. A’s ‘I mentioned, this is not.a, case
where we will be sitting: down to negotiate whether'a defendant will
Scive one ‘year versus two years of probation. ‘This is a case where
the defendant is facing the possibility of ‘dozens of: years of prison
time. Just as the defense will defend a case like that differently: than
they would’ handle:a;probation-type-case, we:nced to handle'this ease
differently. Part: of our ‘prosecution strategy was alrcady: disclosed
at the last’ mecetirig, and. lam coéncéried that more will be disclosed
at a future-mecting.

My-co-chair.. ... who has prosecuted more of these cases than ‘the.
rest of us combined and ‘who actually worked on the drafting of
some of thé child cxploitation statutes, also 6pposes.a mecting. We
have been accused of not being “strategic thinkers” because of our

43, Dershowitz had joined Lefcourt and Sanchez in-representingEpstein-for, the federal,case.

a8 During her OPR.interview, Villafafia could not:recall'the mecting- with specificity; but believed'the purpose

was’ to-discuss whether the USAO should agree to additional -mectings w ith, Epstein’s counsel. Menchel, similarly,
told OPR ‘that he’could not remeniber anything specific about the meeting:
