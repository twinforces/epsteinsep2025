of § 3509(k) applied to conduct predating its enactment in 1990)). The Eighth Circuit’s
reasoning—which addressed earlier versions of the statute—applies with equal, if not greater,
force to the 2003 amendment, which established an even broader statute of limitations. Following
Jeffries, the Ninth Circuit has similarly held that Section 3283 applies retroactively, because
“Congress evinced a clear intent to extend” the statute of limitations. Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at
924 (citing Jeffries, 405 F.3d at 685).
Not only does the wording of the statute clearly express that Congress intended for the

2003 amendment to be the only governing statute of limitations for live claims of child sexual
abuse, but the legislative history also supports this conclusion. The Joint Report accompanying
the 2003 amendment explains that Congress wanted to expand the statute of limitations out of
concern that the 1994 amendment did not go far enough to ensure that perpetrators of child sexual
abuse were held to account:

While [the statute of limitations allowing for prosecution until the

victim reaches age 25] is better than a flat five-year rule [under

Section 3282], it remains inadequate in many cases. For example, a

person who abducted and raped a child could not be prosecuted

beyond this extended limit — even if DNA matching conclusively

identified him as the perpetrator one day after the victim turned 25.
H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 108-66, at 54 (2003). Congress’s express intention was to prevent
perpetrators of crimes against children from escaping justice based on a timing technicality.
Moreover, since the 2003 amendment extended the statute of limitations throughout the lifetime
of the victim, it is clear that Congress expressly authorized prosecutions to occur decades after
crimes had been committed.!3
‘8 Although the defendant claims that prosecuting her crimes now presents unique fairness
concerns, there is nothing unusual about prosecuting sex crimes long after they have occurred.
