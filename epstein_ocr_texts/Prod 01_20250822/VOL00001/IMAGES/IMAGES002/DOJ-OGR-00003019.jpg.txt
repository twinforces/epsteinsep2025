particular, this ‘matter appears to be the only remaining active civil case in this District, in;which
claims against Ghislaine Maxwell have been asserted.” (20 Civ. 484 (DCF) (JGK), Dkt. No. 80
at 2). The defendant’s baseless conjecture about the Government’s supposedly nefarious reasons
for delaying her prosecution ‘are not sufficicnt to support a dismissal, of ‘the Indictment. The
defendant:ignores the fact ’that-cases such as this one take time. to investigate. and.:indict.

The defendant also. ‘suggests that the Government. ‘engaged. in reckless disregard of
circumstances that would likely impede her:ability to‘mount an effective defense. (Def. Mot. 7 at:
5-6, 15). As. an. initial matter, this argument: falls short. of “‘a standard. that requires a showing of
intentionality.” United States y. Wey,’No. 15 Cr. 611 (AJN), 2017 WL 237651, at *13 n.8

evidence as.to how or why the Government acted recklessly here.

In sum, not. only. does the defendant fail to demonstrate’ actual, non-speculative ‘prejudice

owing to pre-indictment delay, but.she also fails to establish that. the Government intentionally

reckless—as opposed to intentional—disregard of circumstances . . .. may’ support a due process

balance’, more plainly comport: with. a, standard that ‘requires a showing of intentionality.” Wey,
201.7 WL 237651, at *13 n.8 (citing Cornielle, 171 F.3d at 752-(defendant bears burden.of showing,
that “delay: was a. course intentionally pursued by the government for an improper purposc”)
