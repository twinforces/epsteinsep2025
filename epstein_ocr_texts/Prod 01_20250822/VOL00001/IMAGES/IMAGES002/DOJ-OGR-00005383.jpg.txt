Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

Counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully submit this letter in response to the Court’s Order
dated October 22, 2021, regarding the Court’s draft preliminary remarks for prospective jurors. (Dkt.
366). The defense has no objection to the proposed remarks. However, the defense does object to the
government’s position that the parties should not receive the names of the prospective jurors until the
first day of oral voir dire on November 16, 2021. (Dkt. 371). The Court has already determined that the
names of the prospective jurors will be given to the parties with the juror questionnaires. The second
page of the Court’s draft jury questionnaire is a blank page that will be filled in with the “juror
information sheet from the jury department.” (Dkt. 365). It is the defense’s understanding that the juror
information sheet includes the name of the prospective juror. If the government had wanted to delay the
disclosure of the names of the prospective jurors, they could have made a request to the Court when the
parties submitted their joint proposed juror questionnaire. The government did not do so. Accordingly,
the Court should deny this request.

Very truly yours,
/s/
