S2 20.Cr. 330 (AIN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

Counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell, respectfully submit this letter in response to the Court’s Order
dated October 22, 20211, regarding the Court’s draft preliminary remarks for'prospective jurors. (Dkt.
366). The defense has no objection.to the proposed remarks. ‘However, the:defense does .object to ‘the
goyvernment’s: position, that;the parties should not reecive the:names of the prospective jurors until’ the
first day of oral voir dire of November ‘16, 2021... (Dkt. 371). The Court has already determined that the
names of the prospective jurors will be given to the parties with the juror questionnaires. The second.
page of the Court’s draft jury questionnaire is a blank ‘page that;will be filled in'with the “juror
information shcct:from the jury department.” (Dkt: 365). It is the: defense’s understanding thatthe juror
information shect:includes the name of the prospective juror. Ifthe government, had wanted, to delay: the
disclosure ofthe nanics of the prospective jurors, they could have:made:a request'to the Court when the
partics submitted. their joint-proposed juror questionnaire. The government did not do so. Accordingly,
the Court should deny this ‘request.

Very truly yours,

ee: Government Counsel,
