is particularly instructive here. See 386 F. Supp.3d at 366. In denying the motion to dismiss,
Judge Marrero found Stringer’s holding “that the identity of a victim was not required to be
contained in an indictment, despite the centrality of the victim’s identity to the charge” to be
equally applicable in a case involving sex trafficking charges. /d. at 369. The same logic follows
here. The use of pseudonyms to refer to the minor victims of sexual abuse in Counts One through
Four is no more prejudicial to the defendant here than the absence of victim identities was to the
defendants in Kidd or Stringer. This is especially so when the Government has already provided
the defendant with the birth month and year of each victim, provided discovery regarding each
victim, and has repeatedly indicated that it will provide the defendant with the names of its
witnesses, including the minor victims referenced in the Indictment, four weeks in advance of trial.
Such disclosure will ensure that the defendant is readily able to bar future prosecutions for the
same offense, and together with the elements of each crime and additional details contained in in
the Indictment, is more than sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss.

Second, the Indictment “state[s] the time and place (in approximate terms)” of the conduct
alleged in Counts One through Four. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d at 693 (quoting Tramunti, 513 F.2d
at 1113). In particular, Counts One through Four each allege that the defendant engaged in a
continuing course of conduct involving the enticement and transportation of minors with intent to
commit illegal sex acts, as well as conspiracies to do so, between in or about 1994 and in or about
1997. See Indictment 7 1, 6, 7, 9-11, 13, 15-17, 19. Courts in the Second Circuit have consistently
upheld indictments containing a range of time rather than a specific date. See, e.g., Kidd, 386. F.
Supp. 3d at 369 (“[Th]le Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used to
describe the window of when a violation occurred.” (citing United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d
1294, 1323 (2d Cir. 1987)); United States v. Vickers, No. 13 Cr. 128 (RJA) (HKS), 2014 WL
