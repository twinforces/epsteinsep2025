G4LMGIUC

1 confidential material to go to deponents, witnesses or

2 potential witnesses.

2) THE COURT: That's a different issue. I have not

4 dealt with that. Obviously anybody who is a witness may have
5 access to the confidential material, because they have to buy
6 into the confidentiality order in order to do that. But they
7 are outside of it at the moment.

8 MS. McCAWLEY: Your ruling is, they cannot attend the
9 deposition tomorrow?

10 THE COURT: They can. Anybody can attend the

Le deposition that anybody wants to have, but they can't

12 participate in it. They can't have access to the confidential
13 material until we get this matter straightened out. Ok.
14 MS. McCAWLEY: I understand, your Honor.

LS MR. PAGLIUCA: Your Honor, we will be designating the
16 testimony as confidential.

cy THE COURT: You see. There you go. That's life. I
18 can't believe that this entire testimony is going to be

a We. confidential. Honestly, you all are too much. Ok. If that's
20 what you do, you know that's not going to work because not all
21 of this stuff at issue is going be to confidential. No, no
22 way. What is your name? Ok. We will deal with tomorrow's
23 problem tomorrow.
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Ok, your Honor.
2) THE COURT: The compel. Anybody want to add anything
