her a victim,for purposes of the federal charges, and.continued-to treat her as a victim, because:she
wanted “to ‘go above ‘and beyond in terms of caring forthe victims.”*""

E. December 19, 2007: Acosta Advises the Defense That the USAO Will Defer to
the State Attorney the Decision Whether to Notify ‘Victims of the State ‘Plea
Hearing, but the USAO Would Notify Them of the Federal Resolution, “as
Required by. Law”

On Deéember 1:1, 2007,. Starr transmitted:to. Acosta two lengthy submissions authored. by’
Lefkowitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and ‘to “the background. and conduct of
the investigation” into Epstcin. ‘Regarding issucs relevant to‘victim notification, in,his transmittal,
letter, Starr asserted that the “latest episodes, involving [§] 2255 notification,to the alleged victims
put: illustratively:7 in bold. relicf our concerns that the ends of justice, time and.time again, are not-
beirigserved.” By way of'cxample, Starr complained the g government had.recently inappropriately
provided * “oral notification of the victim notification letter” to one: girl’s attorney, even though it
was clear from, the girl’s recorded FBI interview that:she “did.not in,any manner view herself as a.
victim.”

In, his. submissions, Lefkowitz argued. that the government’ was ‘not required ‘to notify’
victims of the § 2255 provision:

‘Villafafia’s decision to utilize 'a.civil remedy statute in the place of
a restitution ‘fund forthe alleged: victims. climinates the notification
réquirement-undér the Justice for All Act of 2004, a federal. law that
requires federal authorities. to fotify victims as 'to any available
restitution, not..of any potential. civil remedies. Despite this. fact,
[she] proposed a. Victims Notification Ictter to be'sent to the alleged
federal victims.

Lefkowitz also. atgucd ‘that a ‘victim trust fund would provide, a more appropriate
mechanism for compensating the-victims than-the government’s proposed useof 18 U'S.C. § 2255,
and.a.trust ‘fund. would not violate Epstcin’s duc: ‘process: rights. ‘Lefkowitz; took: issue: with, the
government’s “assertion” that the USAO was. obligated to send. a victim notification, letter'to ‘the:
alleged victims, or cven. that: it was appropriate for the USAO to do so. Lefkowitz further argued.
that the government misinterpreted both ‘the, GVRA and the VRRA, because. ncither applied to. a.
public, state court proceeding involving the entry of:a plea on. state charges..

In, a, letter from Villafafia to Lefkowitz, ‘responding’ to his ‘allegations: ‘that; she had.
committed ‘misconduct, she specifically addressed. the “false” allegations that the government. had.

alk As noted previously, in.April'2007, this victim gave:a vidco-recorded interview to'the FBT that:was:tavorable
to: Epstein, Villafafia told OPR.she-was instructed by cither Sloman.or Acosta “not to, consider. [this individual] as-a
v. ictim for purposes of the: NPA. because she was not someone whonrthe’Office was prepare[d] to include in” a federal,
charging document: Accordingly, the;victim: who'beeame “Jane;Doe #2°* was not:ineluded:on'the v ietim: list ultimately
furnished to:the defense: The: attorney w ho was: representing: this victim at the;time of her EBI interview was-paid by
Epstein, and.she; subsequently obtained different counsel.
