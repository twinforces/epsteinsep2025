Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document298 Filed 06/04/21 Page 2 of 6

Maxwell appears to proffer two theories of relevance as fo the entire journal. While’ she
studiously avoids using the’ word, one such theory relates to, impeachment. As this Court has
noted, the potential. impeachment of a witness does not provide grounds for issuance or
enforcement of a Rule 17(¢) subpoena because: such. materials would only become relevant affer
a-witness has testified. United States v. Skelos, No. 1S-CR-317 (KMW), 20.18 WL.2254538, at
*2 (S.D.N.Y. May: 17, 2018), aff'd, 988 F.3d 645 (2d.Cir, 2021) (collecting cases).

The other theory. of relevance that Maxwell proffers is that ifthe rest of the journal, docs
not mention her, the journal as a ‘whole may serve .as exculpatory evidenec. At best, the theory
amounts fo little more than a “fishing expedition,” which is not.the’proper‘use of Rule 17(c).. See
United States v., Nixon, 418 U-S. 683, 698-70 (1974). In.afiy event, the argument is too
speculative to mect the standard sct.forth in.Nixon. To begin with, the: request appears to be
overbroad; under Rule, 1'7(c), the moving partymust ‘show that all ofthe requested material ‘is
relevant. Cf United. States. v. Pend, No. 1.5-CR-55:1 (AJN), 20.16 WL 8735699, at'*2 (S.D.N-Y.
Feb. 12, 2016). ‘It appears ‘from the bricfing thatthe diary includes entries from,before Minor
Victim-2’s first.time mecting Epstein or Maxwell. Maxwell docs not explain why the absence! of
references to her:in those entries: would be ‘relevant, and she provides no other basis as to:the
relevance of any portions of the diary that:precede her meeting Epstein or Maxwell. And here,
to specific: incidents is, in-its nature, targeted at impeaching the alleged. victim’s anticipated
testimony.

In addition, Maxwell does not plausibly cstablish-the relevance of the rest of the. diary
‘other'than the pages she has already received. ‘BSF has represented that. the rest of the journal

docs not discuss Maxwell or Jeffrey. Epstein. Dkt. No. 1.91 at:5. The Government.has similarly.
