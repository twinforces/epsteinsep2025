Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 265 Filed 05/03/21 Page2of3
counsel’s current application is that this Court order MDC to turn over copies of video tapes of
the in-person attorney-client visit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video tapes must be preserved in light of
defense counsel’s preservation letter. Dkt. No. 248, Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel
are entitled to view or receive copies of those materials as a matter of law, they should be
provided. To the extent defense counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this
Court, that application is denied.

The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has the opportunity
to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in light of all relevant circumstances
and consistent with the treatment of all other detained inmates in BOP custody. The isolated
incident that took place on April 24, 2021, and the serious allegations leveled by MDC legal
counsel and defense counsel in no way undermine the Court’s conclusion that Ms. Maxwell and
her lawyers are fully able to prepare for trial. The Court is confident that all parties recognize
the importance of this going forward and in advance of the upcoming trial.

In furtherance of this, counsel for the Government are ORDERED to confer with legal
counsel for MDC to ensure that Ms. Maxwell continues to have access to confidential attorney-
client communications as she prepares for trial. If any additional incidents arise, defense counsel
shall promptly confer with counsel for the Government regarding those incidents and seek to
resolve any such issues swiftly, responsibly, reasonably, and amicably. If that fails, the parties
may write to the Court jointly indicating their views, identifying and justifying any specific
application being made.

SO ORDERED.
