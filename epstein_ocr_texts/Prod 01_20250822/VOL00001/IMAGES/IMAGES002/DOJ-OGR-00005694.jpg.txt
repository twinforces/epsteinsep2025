morning of her arrest, which had nothing to do with evading capture by law enforcement. See
id., Ex. S 79 4-13. This individual stated that he had spoken to the security guard who was on
duty with Ms. Maxwell that morning. /d. 47. The security guard reported that he had seen a
helicopter flying above the property in the early morning hours and assumed it was the press. Jd.
Believing that the press had discovered the property, the head of the security company instructed
the security guard to prepare Ms. Maxwell to move to a safe room in the event that the perimeter

Id. 9§ 8-9. He radioed Ms. Maxwell to alert her that members of the press were on the grounds

(Dkt. 97) at 24. Moreover, the cell phone was subscribed in the name of Ms. Maxwell’s charity
and was therefore easily traceable to Ms. Maxwell. See id. at 24-25.

In sum, the government cannot establish a sufficient factual predicate to argue that Ms.
Maxwell’s actions were evidence of flight, much less evidence of consciousness of guilt. Ms.
