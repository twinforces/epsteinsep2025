In. deciding to stay the civil.case, courts’ generally weigh six factors: (1) the extent to
which the issues in the criminal case overlap with those in the civil case; (2) the status of the
criminal. case,:including whether the.defendant has been indicted; (3) the:private interests of the
plaintiff in proceeding expeditiously weighed against the prejudice to the plaintiffs caused by the
delay; (4).the private interests of and burden on.ihe defendant; (5) the interest’ of the Court; .and
(G) the public interest. See Trustees of ‘the Plumbers and Pipefitters Nat’l Pension Fund v.
Transworld Mech., Inc.,.886.F. Supp. 1134; 1139 (S-D:N.Y. 1995) (stay was-appropriate so.as.to
not interfere with defendant’s Fifth. Amendment ri ghts).

Here, consideration. of the'six factors weighs in favor of staying this action against-Ms.
Maxwell, largcly because Plaintiff controls access tothe alleged information.and has refused to
provide the information to Ms: Maxwell. First, presumably-the issucs:in any purported :criminal
inyestigation are identical with the underlying issue in this case: did Ms. Maxwell assist in,
“trafficking” the Plaintiffas she claims.from 1999 to 2001. ‘As to the second. factor Plaintiff
claims to have information about this issuc, although no. ifdictinent has been issued. ‘Third,
given the age of the underlying allegations, almost 20 years, there docs not appear to be any
prejudice that could be caused by-any delay. Fourth, in the event: there actually is. an
investigation and. Plaintiff is involved in fomenting-the investigation, Ms. Maxwell has a
significant interest in: knowing about'the investigation, so ‘that. she can appropriately respond and.
assess any’ claim of privilege. Conceming factor five, the Court has an interest in controlling the
proceedings before it and also has an interest in,protecting the rights of the litigants. Appropriate

disclosure would iallow an informed decision to be made-regarding these issues. Finally, there is:
