Identities of Accusers

The government offers no justification for continuing to withhold defense counsel,

defense can adequately prepare for trial. The government has never argued that Ms. Maxwell

thorough review of the Jencks Act material and the government’s exhibits. The government
previously has indicated to counsel that the Jencks Act materials total in the "low thousands"

prior to the presentation of evidence and will necessarily be raised in the context of a particular
witness’s testimony.
