the significance of those interactions and of AUSA J misrepresentations to an Article
III federal judge. This Court should not permit the government to whitewash its conduct.

The discovery provided to Maxwell in response to her Motion rebuts every defense the
government now offers of its conduct. And if that weren’t enough, the government’s defense
fails on its own terms, because if this Court were to assume its truth (an assumption the
government has not earned), AUSA [J statements to Judge McMahon would still have
been demonstratively and materially false.

A. The Government’s Defenses Are Not Credible.

Discovery provided to Maxwell in response to her Motion rebuts every defense the
government now offers of its conduct.

e Defense 1: The February 29, 2016 meeting was only about Epstein.

AUSA J Contemporancous hand-written notes entirely undermine the
government’s claim that the February 29, 2016 meeting was about Epstein only and had nothing
to do with Maxwell. Resp. at 89 & n.39. See Ex. J. AUSA J notes refer to Maxwell as
Epstein’s “head recruiter” of underage girls; they document allegations that Maxwell “regularly”
took sexually explicit photos of Giuffre and other underage girls, which she kept on her
computer; they allege that Maxwell gave one such photo to Epstein as a birthday present, which
he hung on his wall; they claim that Maxwell, along with Epstein, brought Giuffre to New York
to personally “train[] [her] . . . [in] how to service men;” and they assert that Maxwell used the
“same MO” to recruit other girls to the sex trafficking scheme. The contents of AUSA yg
notes belie any notion that Giuffre’s attorneys—who at that very moment were suing Maxwell
