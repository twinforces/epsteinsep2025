he‘hung, on-his wall; they claim that Maxwell, along with Epstein, brought Giuffre to New York:
to‘personally. “train[] [her] .,... [in] how to service: men;” and they‘ assert that Maxwell used the
“same MO” to rectuit other girls to the séx.trafficking scheme. The contents of AUSA[_]

notes beli¢-any notion that, Giuffte’s attorneys—who at that:very. moment were suing Maxwell.
