Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 380 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page 32 of 54

Cir. 2017) (summary order) (instructing jury that the “government is not, on trial” is
“appropriate” (internal quotation. 'marks omittéd)). Introducing evidence about investigative
‘decisions would only confuse the issues properly before the: jury and ‘suggest that jurors ‘should.
focus on, ‘the ‘history of investigations into Epstcin’ and his co-conspirators. rather than, the
eviderice against the defendant.

Judge Stcin’s decision in United States v. Duncan, No. 18 Cr. 289 (SHS) (S.D.N.Y.), is
instructive. In that.case, a defendant sought to calla case agent on three topics: (1) the length of.
the FBI’s investigation, (2) the: law: enforeement.techniques that ‘were used and not used, and. (3)
contacts and. communications with that.defendant prior to his arrest. Letter, /d., Dkt.'No. 130.
The Court éxplained, that, defense counsel “warited to bring out that [the defendant] was not.a
target of the: investigation. for a. long period oftime.” May 16, 2019 Tr. at..1168:12-23, id:, Dkt.
No. 159. Citing Su/darriaga, the Court explained, that the argument was “absolutely. irrelevant,”
because “[W]hat matters is, whether ‘the, government has proven. its case against [the defendant]
here beyond. a reasonable doubt.” Jd, at: 1168:12-25; see Duncan, ‘2019 WL. 22.0663, at *3
(“Evidence about the length of the investigation, the techniques used, and'when, Locust became,
target is: therefore not admissible. pursuant to Fed. R. Evid. 401.”).

So too here. It is irrelevant what. investigative steps were taken, during the Florida.
investigations or this invéstigation, and it. is irrelevant how long those investigations lasted.
Testimony and. argument .on ‘those points would ‘not assist: the jury in evaluating the defendant’s
guilt or innocence, but; it) would, confuse the jury by directing them to ‘focus on investigators’

conduct: Especially where, the investigative context is complicated and a topic of public interest
