Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document204 Filed 04/16/21 Page 198 of 239

dismissal of count.as‘multiplicitous prior to trial, as such,a. determination before trial is “at. best.
‘premature”). Among other reasons, courts look. to, “the record. as a’ whole in determining whether
an..indictment is in fact multiplicitous,” and the record cannot be fully established until. trial is
complete. United States vi McCourty,562 F.3d:458, 469 (2d, Cir. 2009). Additionally, because
double, jeopardy is meant'to protect'a defendant'from successive: punishments:for the Same offense,
a.multiplicitous count docs not violate the Clause unless and until sentence is imposed. See’
Josephberg, 459 F.3d at.355 (“Where there has been. no:prior conviction or acquittal, the Double
Jcopardy Clause does not protect against simultancous prosccutions forthe same offense, so long’
as. no more than one punishment is eventually imposed.”).

Following the Second. Circuit’s diréctive, courts in this Circuit. regularly defer ruling. on a.
multiplicity motion until after. the conclusion of trial. See, ¢.g., United States v. Halkbank, No. 15
Cr. 867 (RMB), 2020 WL. 5849512, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 1, 2020) (denying pretrial, motion, to

dismiss multiplicitous count and noting that “‘[c]ourts in this Circuit’ have routinely denied. pre-

trial motions to: dismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.’” (quoting United States y.
Medina, Niow’'13 Crs 272.(PGG), 2014 WL 3057917, at *3:(S.D.N.Y. July'7, 2014))); Unifed Staies
v. Dumitru, No. 18 Cr. 243: (LAK), .2018 WL 3407703, at.*1 (S.D.N.Y. June. 26, 20118) (denying
pretrial motion to’ dismiss multiplicitous count in light of “the Circuit’s. controlling view that the
question of multiplicitousticss is properly considered. only at..a later point::in the procecdings”);
United States v. Mostafa, 965 F. Supp. 2d 45.1, 464 (S’D.N-Y..2013) (“[MJultiplicity is properly
addressed. by the’trial court at the sentencing stage.”); Wnited States v; Ghavami, No. 1.0 Cr. 12.17
(KMW), 2012, WL 2878126, at *1:1 (S.D.N-Y. Juily 13,.2012) (“To the extent that the. Indictment
alleges more than, one conspiracy .. . , Defendants’ multiplicity challenge is‘premature. Should.

the jury convict: Defendants on. what:the Court ultimately determines to be multiplicitous counts,
