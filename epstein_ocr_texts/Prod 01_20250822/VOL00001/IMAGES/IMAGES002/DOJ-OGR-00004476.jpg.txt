Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21. Page 179 of 349

his USAO: colleagues viewed Epstein’ S -attempt:to exert influence through his choice of counsel. as
“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”

Sloman told OPR. that although ‘he: became. aware that Louric was fricnds with Guy Lewis
colleagues and any of Epstein’s S. attorncys, but that i in n any ‘event his attitude roparding cases
involving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but'we didn’t:pull any-punches
with them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with. defense counsel, did not.“chanige the
equation” because as AUSAs, he and his: colleagues: were motivated. by-what they perceived to. be
best for the case.

Lourie told OPR that his‘preexisting.associations with Epstein’s attorneys “didn’t influence
anything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie. sought guidance, from. the USAO’s
Professional. Responsibility: ‘Officer about the propricty of his role as ‘a. supervisor. in. the:
investigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long- time: friendship with, Lewis’s law:
partner. OPR considered'Louric’s caution. in secking and obtaining the Professional Responsibility:
Officer's advice, as an. indication that he was ‘alert: to his ethical responsibilitics regarding’
‘relationships with:defensé counsel, including avoiding the appearance of a conflict,of interest.

Acosta, said during ‘his OPR interview that: he “developed” the three criteria reflected on,
the term sheet—a sentence of incarceration, sexual offender registration, and. monetary damages
for the victims=before he engaged directly with any of Epstcin’s attorneys and before Epstein
added. Starr and, Lefkowitz, the Kirkland. & Ellis attorneys, to his team. Acosta poirited out ‘that.
the USAO continued to insist on a:resolution ‘that: satisfied all three of those criteria even after
Kirkland & Ellis became involved.in the case.

Acosta took’ other actions, that. appear inconsistent; with, an ‘intent to benefit Starr and.
Lefkowitz. On several occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkowitz or Starr, he dirécted.
them to address their communications, to Villafafia, Sloman, and other subordinates. After his
October .1.2, 2007 breakfast: mecting with Lefkowitz, Acosta immediately: communicated. with.
‘Sloman about, their conversation. In late 2008, when Acosta anticipated. |caving the: USAO and.
was considering’ pursuing employment with Kirkland,& ‘Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest:
and. instructed Sloman to:stop copying him.on cmails: relating to the Epstcin matter. On Acosta’s
behalf, the USAO’s Professional. Responsibility Officer sought and obtained. formal Department’
approval:of Acosta’s recusal:from the case based .on the fact that he had “begun:to discuss possible
employment” with Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion. that he was
cognizant of his ethical, responsibilitics concerning relationships with defense: counscl.?"4

aa In addition, in May: 2008, the USAQ’s Professional ResponsibilityOfficer consulted, with the Department’s
Professional Responsibility Officer about whether Acosta. should. recuse trom the ‘ ‘Epstein matter because he was
considering secking a.v. Asiting professorship at. Harvard: Law School.in 2009;-and ‘Dershowitz—a Harvard:Law School
professor—w: as representing: Epstein. ‘asa priv ate; paying client, and not as any part ofa: Mary ard Law: School:elinic
or law school teaching program” * and “should haverno role in deciding: whether’ Mr. Acosta.is offered any position,as
a visiting professor?” The, Department.advised that these facts provided no’basis for:recusal.
