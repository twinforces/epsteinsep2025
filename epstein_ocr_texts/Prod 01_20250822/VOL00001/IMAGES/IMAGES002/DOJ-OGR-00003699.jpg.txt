counsel testify on, her behalf on.the’perjury charges and-having.them assist her in defending the
Mann Act chargés.

The Second Circuit has recognized. that witness testimony offered by a party’s attorney
presents serious risks to the fairness of'atrial. See Murrav'v., Metro. Life Ins. Co., 583 F.3d,173,
178 (2d Git. 2009). ‘The. lawyer might appear'to vouch forthcir own éredibility, jurors might
perecive the lawyer as distorting the truth,to benefit their client, and-blurred lines between
argument and evidence might. confuse the jury: J/d.. Disqualification.of counsel also implicates

represented-her in.the civil case: have worked with her for years and are particularly familiar-with
the ‘facts surrounding the criminal prosecution. See Whited. States’ v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d
1064, 1070-71. (2d Cir. 1982).

The Court is of course cognizant of the burden separate trials may’ impose on all. trial

evidence on that, question. is unlikely to’bear on, the other-charges here. See Kross, 14 F.3d at

beyond the narrower issues presented. And while the Court agrees. withthe Government that.at-
least some of Maxwell’s concerns. are overstated, there is little question that the jury’s
‘consideration, of the nature-of the defamation action will require a significant investment of'time

and. resources to provide the requisite context.
