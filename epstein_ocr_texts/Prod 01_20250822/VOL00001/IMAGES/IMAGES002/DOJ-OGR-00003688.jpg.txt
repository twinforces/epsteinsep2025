Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 14 of 34

Section 3283, as amended by the PROTECT Act, broadly states that “[inJo statute of
limitations that'would. otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or
physical.abusc, or-kidnaping, of a child under the age of.1.8-ycars:shall. preclude such prosecution.
during the life of the child.” The statute Jacks.an express retroactivity clause, but courts. have,
held'that.no such clausc:is necessary, including forthis particular statute. See Léo Sure Chief,
438 F.3d at 923. The:statute’s plain language unambiguously requires that it apply to
prosccutions for offenses committed. before the date of enactment. Instead of simply’ providing’ a
new limitations period for future conduct, Congress stated that vo statute of. limitations that
would otherwise preclude prosecution of these offenses:will apply... That.is, it prevents the’
application of any statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to:past conduct.

Courts have:reached.the: same conclusion for other statutes employing, similar language:
The Eighth. Circuit; has held that the 1994 amendments to § 3283, which allowed prosecution of
Sex crimes against childrcn-until:the victim reached age twenty-five, applicd'to past'conduct. See
United: States v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d.682, 684-85 (8th Cir. 2005). The Second. Circuit‘has observed.
‘that the Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1991, Pub..L.'No. 102-26, 105 Stat. ‘123,
‘illustrates language that requires.a statute’s application to past conduct. See.Enter. Mortg.
Acceptance Co. LLC, See. Litig., 391 F.3d at 407. That statute climinated, the statute of
limitations for'claims on defaulted student loans by stating that “‘no limitation. shall terminate the
period. within which suit may be filed.” Jd. The:PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.

The history of § 3283 confirms Congress’s intent;to apply the extended limitations period,
as broadly’ as the Constitution allows. With cach sucécssive amendment to the statuté, Congress,
further extended the limitations period, recognizing that:sex ‘crimes against children “may: be

difficult to detect quickly” because children often delay or decline to ‘report sexual. abuse.
