motive to fabricate arose immediately: after the supposed.child-abuse, and thus statements made
to others, months or years latér, were inadmissible: under now-Rule: 801.(d)(1)(B)(). The same is
true-here. The improper influence.and motive to fabricate occurred, in several. instances, many
years, ago, shortly after the purported abuse occurred, and before the recently-disclosed
“consistent” statements. Wright & Miller, 30B Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid. § 6753 Consistent
Premotive Statements (2021, ed.) ("Asin Jome, prior consistent statements will frequently: be
‘tainted. by’the! same ‘alleged: motive to, lie that is claimed to ‘impugn the witness" trial testimony. If
so,, Rule 80.1(d)(1)(B)(i) docs not-permit.their:introduction. This result has favorable policy:
implications. As 7ome stresses, the general_cxclusion of prior consistent statements ensures that
‘the: whole emphasis of the trial’ does not. ‘shift to the out-of-court statenients” as. opposed to ‘the
in-court.ones.").

or éxplain their faulty memory"under Rule 80.1(d)(1)(B)(ii), the "offered prior consistent

impeachment with relative directness. The wall, attacked. at one point, may not be: fortified. at.
‘another, distinct point.”)). Aswas the case prior to the 201.4 Amendments, “a prior consistent
Statement may only’ be used for rchabilitation “when. the statement'has a probative force bearing,
