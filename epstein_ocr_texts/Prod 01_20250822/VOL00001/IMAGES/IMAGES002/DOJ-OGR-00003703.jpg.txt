Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 29 of 34

Maxwell requests an order directing immediate disclosure of all Brady and. Giglio
‘material and also requests a few specific: documents she contends the Government ha’ failed’to
disclose. The Court begins with:the specific: requests. The requested. materials include (1)
records of witness intervicws in connection with an.cx: parte declaration in, support of a response
to a motion to quash subpoenas; (2) aiiunredacted:copy of two, FBI reports; (3) pages ‘from a,
personal diary that is in the custody of a civilian third-party; and (4) copies of all subpoenas the
‘Government has issucd for Maxwell’s records as part of its investigation ‘in this case.

The Government represents that it is: cognizant. of its.Brady obligations, that.is has
reviewed. the witness interviews. and one’ of the FBI reports, and that neither set.of documents
includes exculpatory inforniation. not ‘previously disclosed. The Court has no, reason to doubt the
Government’s representation. in this case that it is aware of its Brady obligations and that it has
complied and, will continue to:comply with them. And because the witness. statements. are
covered by the Jericks. Act, the Court cannot compel production. of such. statements under the
terms of the:statute. See 18 U.S.C, § 3500; Coppa, 267 F.3d at 145. Next, the Government:
represents that it has already produced an unredacted copy: of the other requested FBI report, and
so that request is:moot. The diary pages she:requests are:within the:control. of a civilian third
party, not, the Government, and so the Government need not (and.perhaps cannot), produce them.
See United States’, Collins, 409 FE. Supp. 3d 228, 239 (S.D.N-Y. 2019). Finally, Maxwell's
request. for copics of all. subpoenas the Government has issued.is overly broad.and lacks a legal
basis. Maxwell 1s not-entitled to compel production. of these documents.

The Court also ‘will not. issue an order requiring the immediate disclosure of Brady arid
Giglio. material. The Government has’ represented that jt recognizes its obligations ‘under Brady

and. that; it has complicd, and ‘will continue to comply, ‘with such obligations. ‘The Court.has no
