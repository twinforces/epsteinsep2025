random. sample. First, the inactive voters in.all counties except Dutchess were excluded. from
sélection. Assuming that they should have been considered,? this exclusion resulted in the
sample.frame (the: voter lists) being improperly defined for all counties except Dutchess. The
‘second issue is that, of the six counties which make up the White Plains community, three:
counties feed both,the Manhattan aid, Whité Plains master jury Wheel, whilé threé counties. feed
‘only White Plains. The process for selecting for the White‘Plains master jury wheel, from the
three non-overlapping counties was to, select. one out of every three voters, while the process for
selecting from-the three overlapping counties-was to select one out of every 4.5-voters.* Thus,
the White Plains sampling methodology underrepresents the voters in the three overlapping
counties.”

14. lf the sample.from the voter registration. lists had been a simple random‘sample, then.
the master jury wheel;would, be expected to ‘mirror that ofthe voter registration lists as of
November 1, 2016. Any’ difference would be due to chanéeé as'a result’ of raidon selection and,
given, the large number of selections, the difference due to chance should be trivial. Of:course,

the master jury wheel, could vary’ from the:actual demographics of the community’ due to

* There may be some valid: reason for excluding inactive voters, but: inactive voters: from,
Dutchess. county were included in the selection process, and some ‘inactive voters ‘responded. and
‘were, on the, qualified jury: wheel. Thus, assume that the exclusion. of the inactive, voters‘was in
error and.] explore the. impact of this error in. explaining ary differences between'the wheel and
community demographics.

* The methodology ‘was to ‘first select the Manhattan wheel’ by: selecting one out of every’3: voters
from, each county. in, the Manhattan community, and.then for the overlapping counties to remove
those selected forthe. Manhattan wheel from consideration ‘for the White Plains community: and.
then selécting one out of every'3 of the remaining voters. The result is that, considering all
voters in:the county, only 1 out of every 4.5'are selected forthe White: Plains community.

° The procedure: may have been.a compromise between. having an. overly burdensome process for
voters in,the overlapping counties whose chances of jury selection would be twice that of'voters
in, non-overlapping counties and the underrepresentation. of voters.in'the overlapping counties in,
the White Plains master jury: wheel.
