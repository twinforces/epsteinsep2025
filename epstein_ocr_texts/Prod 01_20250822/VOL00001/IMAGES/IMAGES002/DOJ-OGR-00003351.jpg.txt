Cc. Other Significant Factors .Are Inconsistent with a. Conclusion That: the
Subjects” Actions Were Motivated, by Improper:Influences

OPR. considered additional. aspects of the Epstcin case that. were inconsistent. with a.
Suggestion. that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 31, 2007 terms was driven by’ corruption, a.
desire:to provide an improper benefit'to Epstein, or other improper influences.

First, OPR. considered highly significant the fact that if-Acosta’s primary motivation was.
‘to benefit Epstein, he had an. option even more favorable to Epstein. available to him. The NPA.
required, Epstcin to serve time in jail and register as a Sexual offender, and provided a mechanism,
for. the victims: to seck monetary. damages—outcomes: unlikely if the: matter.had been. abandoned
and sent back: to the state for whatever result state authoritics deemed. appropriate. Epstein’ S
attorneys had'vchemently. argued to the USAO that there’was no federal interest in the investigation.
and. that. his conduct was exclusively a matter of state:concern. If the USAO had. declined to
intervene in the case, as Epstcin’s counsel repeatedly ‘and strongly argued.it.should,'the state; would,
have:meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. ‘Under the:state’s.original plan, Epstein likely
would. have received. a sentence of: probation. Menchel, described such a. result as amere | “slap: on.
restitution for the: ‘victims: » "Instead of acceding: to Epstein’ S proposal, ‘however, ‘the USAO devised
a resolution of the federal investigation. that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address
the seriousness of Epstein’s. conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstcin.more:than a guilty plea to the
state’ S. original charge, Standing alone, ‘would have done. Acosta’ S: » affirmative decision to
than exercising rhis discretion to quietly decline prosecution, 1S. is strong , circumstantial evidence that.
he. was not acting’ for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.°*° Similarly, despite defense counsel’s
repeated requests’ to ‘eliminate the sexual offender registration. requitement, Acosta refused to

Sloiian stated that: although Acosta “was sensitive'to [Petite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was
not.” Meiichel coninientéed.“T don*t think itwould have béen a concem:of mine,"

Menchel. also ‘pointed out during his: OPR: interview that; Acostarwas Republican and “had: nothing to: gain”
by showing favoritism to Epstein, who had been; ‘portrayed i in. the media as “this ‘big Democratic donor.” “Villataiia
recounted for OPR an exchange between-the USAO team,and a defense attorney who- argued in,one meeting that—

“we Were; prosecuting: [Epstein] because’he was-Jewish. We then: pointed out'that
a:nuniber. of members of [the: USAO] ‘chain of command were Jewish. Then he
said, well we're prosecuting: him because, -he was:.a‘Demoerat.. And again, we
pointed out that a numiber of us were Democrats. So then, it went to, we were
prosecuting‘hiny because:he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so- well.
