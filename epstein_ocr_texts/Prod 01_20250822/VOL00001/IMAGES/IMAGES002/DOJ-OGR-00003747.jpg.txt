new victims will simply join in a single summary judgment motion that the current victims

anticipate filing after discovery has been completed.

Nor will adding the new victims prejudice the United States. As the court is aware, this
Court is still in its initial discovery stage. The Court is currently considering whether to reject
the Government’s assertion of privilege over documents regarding the case. See DE 265
(victims’ reassertion of objections to the Government privilege claims). The new victims do not
seek any additional discovery beyond that previously sought by the current victims.”
Accordingly, the United States will not be prejudiced or burdened by adding them to this case.

The CVRA does not contain any statute of limitations for filing an action to enforce
rights under the statute. Accordingly, were the Court to deny this motion, the result might be
that the new victims would then be forced to file a separate suit raising their claims, which would
then possibly proceed on a separate litigation track. Rather than require duplicative litigation,
the Court should simply grant their motion to join.

Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 support the joinder motion. Counsel for the victims have
discussed this motion with the Government at length in an effort to avoid any need to file a
substantive pleading on the issue. Counsel for the victims asked the Government during the
summer for its position on joinder. The Government, however, took the matter under
advisement for months. Ultimately, after several inquiries from victims counsel, the
Government indicated without explanation that it opposes this motion. Counsel for the victims
has requested a meeting with the Government on this issue, which will hopefully occur in

2 Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 have asked the Government to provide them with the
record of their statements that they provided to the FBI. These FBI 302’s should be only a few
pages long.
