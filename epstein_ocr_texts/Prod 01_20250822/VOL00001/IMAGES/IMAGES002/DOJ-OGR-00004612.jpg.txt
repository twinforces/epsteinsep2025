Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 315 of 349
Attorney’s Offices was migrated to EOUSA’s centralized system to be maintained. The USAO’s
data was migrated between March and June 2008.

EOUSA and OPR separately confirmed with the USAO that it was unable to locate any
additional emails. OPR questioned Acosta, as well as numerous administrative staff, about the
email gap. Acosta and the witnesses denied having any knowledge of the problem, or that they or,
to their knowledge, anyone else made any efforts to intentionally delete the emails. In addition, at
OPR’s request, EOUSA conducted an analysis of records migrated from four other U.S. Attorney’s
Offices and found that each office provided data that also contained significant gaps in their U.S.
Attorney email records, although the time periods varied for each office. OPR found no evidence
indicating that the gap in Acosta’s emails was caused by any intentional act or for the purpose of
concealing evidence relating to the Epstein investigation and concludes that it was most likely the
result of a technological error.

Although a gap in Acosta’s email inbox from May 26, 2007, through April 2, 2008,
remained, OPR was nonetheless able to examine a significant number of Acosta’s emails from this
time due to the extensive case files kept by the USAO; the availability of Acosta’s sent email,
which did not contain a similar gap; and the availability of emails of other USAO subjects and
witnesses who were included on emails with Acosta.

3. Federal Bureau of Investigation Records

OPR worked with the FBI’s Palm Beach Office, including with two case agents and the
Victim Witness Specialist who worked on the Epstein matter, to obtain relevant FBI documents.
In addition, the FBI searched its Automated Case Support system and also provided documentation
concerming its victim notification system.

4. Criminal Division Records

The Office of the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division provided OPR with
Outlook data for the four individuals from that Office who examined issues connected to the
USAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,
and saved emails, and calendar entries.

CEOS also provided OPR with Outlook data for the four individuals from that office who
worked on, or examined issues connected to, the USAO’s Epstein investigation. The data included
the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted, and saved emails. CEOS also conducted a check of
its shared hard drive and provided documents that were potentially relevant to OPR’s investigation.

5. Office of the Deputy Attorney General Records

OPR obtained Outlook data for the three individuals from the Office of the Deputy
Attorney who examined issues connected to the USAO’s Epstein investigation, including the
former Deputy Attorney General. The data included the individuals’ inbox, outbox, sent, deleted,
and saved emails, and calendar entries.
