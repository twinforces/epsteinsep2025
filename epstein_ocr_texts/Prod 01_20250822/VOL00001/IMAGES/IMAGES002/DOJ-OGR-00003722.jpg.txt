ILL The Questions and Answers Were. Immaterial

The government is confusing arguable “relevance” and “materiality” which “are not
synonymous.” United States v. Litvak, 808 F.3d 160, 174 (2d Cir..2015). It is not enough that any
alleged “misrepresentation’” concern “a variable that-mattered to the” recipient of the
information. The government-must prove that alleged:misstatements were “capable of
influcncing a decision” of the intended récipient../d.. Itremains tinclear how the government will
argue this issuc. However, the questions were improper and could not have:produced admissible
evidence for a jury to consider. There’ was nothing “influenced” on the part‘of the.questioncrs.
who would not have accepted any answer from. Ms. Maxwell as trie: Moreover, the questions
were not:calculated to lead to discoverable evidence.

The Court has the necessary transcripts to decide this:issue in Ms: Maxwell’s favor,.
pretrial. Accordingly, Ms.. Maxwell:requests that the Court dismiss Counts Five and. Six.
