Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 14 of 16
convicted of perjury for an answer given under oath that is literally true, even if it is
unresponsive and intended to mislead. The Court noted that “|t]he burden is on the questioner to
pin the witness down to the specific object of the questioner's inquiry.” Jd. at 360. The answers
to the questions in Counts Five and Six are “literally true” as discussed in detail in Ms.
Maxwell’s moving brief.

Ill. The Questions and Answers Were Immaterial

The government is confusing arguable “relevance” and “materiality” which “are not
synonymous.” United States v. Litvak, 808 F.3d 160, 174 (2d Cir. 2015). It is not enough that any
alleged “‘misrepresentation” concern “a variable that mattered to the” recipient of the
information. The government must prove that alleged misstatements were “capable of
influencing a decision” of the intended recipient. /d. It remains unclear how the government will
argue this issue. However, the questions were improper and could not have produced admissible
evidence for a jury to consider. There was nothing “influenced” on the part of the questioners
who would not have accepted any answer from Ms. Maxwell as true. Moreover, the questions
were not calculated to lead to discoverable evidence.

CONCLUSION

The Court has the necessary transcripts to decide this issue in Ms. Maxwell’s favor,
pretrial. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell requests that the Court dismiss Counts Five and Six.
