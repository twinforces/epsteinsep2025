whose law firm website cites his “national reputation for the aggressive defense” of “high-profile
defendants in criminal matters.”

In late 2006, after the USAO opened its investigation, Epstein hired Miami criminal
defense attorneys who were former AUSAs. One, Guy Lewis, had also served as the U.S.
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida and as Director of the Department’s Executive Office
for United States Attorneys, the component charged with providing close liaison between the
Department and the U.S. Attorneys. Another, Lilly Ann Sanchez, had served in the USAO and
as a Deputy Chief in the Major Crimes Section before leaving in 2005. In August 2007,
immediately after the USAO offered the terms that ultimately led to the NPA, two attorneys from
the firm of Kirkland & Ellis, one of the largest law firms in the country, contacted the USAO on
Epstein’s behalf: Kenneth Starr, former federal judge and Solicitor General, who was serving as
Dean of Pepperdine University School of Law while of counsel to the firm; and Jay Lefkowitz, a
litigation partner who had served in high-level positions in the administrations of Presidents
George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. They were joined by nationally prominent Boston
criminal defense attorney Martin Weinberg. After the NPA was signed, former U.S. Attorney
Joe D. Whitley joined the defense team, as did the former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS and
another former U.S. Attorney, who was also a retired federal judge.
