of the VRRA, ‘noting. that. ihe VRRA “clearly extends. victim- notice rights into 5 the pre- ‘charee
phase” and opining' that; the government “may ‘well have violated” the VRRA with regards to its
investigation of Epstein. As a predecessor tothe CVRA, ‘the. VRRA afforded victims various rights
and services; however, it provided no mechanism for a victim.to assert.such: rights in-federal court.
or by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights portion ‘of the VRRA. established, the
victims’ ‘right to be treated. with, fairness and. respect and the right.to confer with an attorney. for
the government. However, the ‘rights portion of the VRRA.‘was repealed upon passage of the
CVRA and. was notin effect. at the time of the Epstein investigation.

The portion of the VRRA. directing federal law: enforcement agencies to provide certain,
victim, services such as counscling and medical:carc referrals remained in effect following passage
one CVRA. Furthermore, two of the VRRA requirements=once requiring a responsible official

“inform a victim. of any: restitution or other relief to which the victim may be entitled,” and.
another requiring that a responsible official “shall provide a’victim the: carlicst. ‘possible notice of.
the status of the investigation. of the crime, to the extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and.
to the extent that it will ‘not interfere with the investigation”—may: have applied, to the Epstein.
Investigation. However, the VRRA did not ereate a clear and unambiguous obligation on the part:
of the subject. attorneys, as the 2005 Guidelines assigned the duty of enforcing the: two
requirements tothe investigative agency‘rather'than to prosecutors. Morcover, the VRRA:did not.
require notice to victims before the NPA. was: signed because, at that point, the case remained

“under investigation,” and :the-victims did not’become entitled to pursue monctary:damages‘under
the NPA, until Epstein entered, his guilty*pleas in. June 2008. Once Epstcin.did'so, and:the victims.
identified by the USAO became entitled, to pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished. the
victims with appropriate notification.

B. OPR Did. Not Find Evidence Establishing That the Lack of :Consultation Was
Intended to Silence Victims

September 24, 2007. Acosta, “Sloman, “Menchel, “and. Lourie, however, had no recollection of
discussions about consulting victims before ‘the NPA ‘was signed, and Menchcl disputed.
Villafafia’s assertions. OPR. found only one written reference before that date; explicitly raising
the issuc of' consultation. Given. the absence of Contemporancous records, OPR was unable to
conclusively determine whether the: lack of: consultation stemmed from. an. affirmative decision.
made by one or more of the subjects or whether the:subjects discussed consulting the victims about:
the NPA before it was signed. ‘Villafafia’s recollection. suggests that. Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman,
may haye been concerned with maintaining the confidentiality ofplca, negotiations and did not:
believe, that the government was obligated to consult’with victims about such negotiations. OPR.

Conduct 1.3, ‘lack‘of diligence, and 8.4¢d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The holding:in Smith
was'based on: Article 47 of the’ “Maryland Constitution and various: specific statutes: affording: victims the right, among’
others; to receive various notices and an opportunity to be heard concerning “fa case originating by: indictment or
information filed :in a cireuit. court.” | Howevers both the; underlying statutory: provisions and, significantly; the. facts
are, substantially - different from the ‘Epstein, investigation. In Smith, the eriminal defendant. had ‘been arrested and.
charged before; entering a-plea.
