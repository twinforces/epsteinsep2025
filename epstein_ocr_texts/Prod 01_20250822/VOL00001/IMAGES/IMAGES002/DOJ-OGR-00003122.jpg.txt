The defendant’s motion to strike should. bé denied—or at’ a :mininium deferred until after
the conclusion of the Government’s direct case—because all of the challenged allegations ‘pertain,
‘to evidence that will be relevant. and.admissible at; trial, and arc not ‘unduly. prejudicial.

First, the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 are properly included ‘in the Indictment’s
description of the conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three because’ evidence of. those
incidénts is relevant and, admissible at trial as direct evidence of the crimes charged. Counts One
and, Three: allege that the: defendant. participated. in. conspiracies with Epstein both to transport.
minor victims and to entice minor victims to travel with the intent to commit illegal sex acts.
Indictment 49 9-11, 15-17. Jn the course and as part-of those, conspiracics, ‘the. defendant groomed

Minor Victim-3 to. cngage:in sex.acts:with Epstein was apart of and therefore constitutes evidence
of these conspiracies. /d. 49 7(¢),.11(¢d), 17(d)-

The defense claims that because the Indictment does not allege: that cach clement of
substantive violations of 18 U.S-C. §§ 2422 and 2423(a) was met as to Minor Victim-3, her
expericnecs cannot. be direct: evidence of the ‘conspiracies to violate those statutes charged in,
Counts One. and Three. But that argument ignores a fundamental tenet of conspiracy law. It.is
axiomatic that a:conspiracy: docs not require a. completed substantive-crime. See Salinas vy. United
States, 522 U.S. 52, 65 (1.997) (“It'is elementary. that a conspiracy. may. exist and. be ‘punished.
