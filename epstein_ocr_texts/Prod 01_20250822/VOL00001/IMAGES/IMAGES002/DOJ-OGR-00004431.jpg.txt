In.another letter, Starr.renewed the defense accusation thatthe USAO improperly disclosed.
information about the case ‘to the media, and ‘accused, Sloman ‘and Villafaria. of “encouraging civil
litigation” against. Epstein. Finally, in a letter to Assistant: Attorney’ General Fisher’ on
May 14, 2008, Starr thanked her ‘for having spoken.with him the previous day, reiterated the
defense team’s various complaints, and asked her'to mect'with him, Lefkowitz, and Whitlcy.

Meanwhile, Oosterbaan’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision Ictter to’be sent.from Oosterbaan,
‘to Lefkowitz, ‘and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input. from
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mandelker.and Assistant Attorney: General Fisher, as well. as
the Criminal. Division’s Appellate: Section (regarding :certain legal issues). and. Office of
Enforcement Operations (regarding x the Petite policy). Oosterbaan told OPR.that, notwithstanding
the defense submissions ona wide varicty. of issues and. complaints, CEOS’s review was limited.
‘to determining whether there was.a. basis, for a federal. prosecution, of Epstcin.

Oosterbaan’s letter, sent to.Lefkowitz ‘on May: 15, 2008, notified the defense team. that.
CEOS ‘had completed its independent evaluation, of whether prosccution of Epstein for federal
criminal, violations “would contradict criminal, enforeement policy, interests.” The letter:specified.
that CEOS’s review’ addressed the “narrow question” of whcther,a. lcgitimate basis cxisted fora.
federal prosecution, and that. CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues
relating:to federal statutes that did not.pertain to child exploitation, or: review'the:terms of:the.NPA.
‘or. the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The Ictter stated that based. on. its examination. of the:
material relevant to its limited review of the:matter, CEOS had concluded that,“federal prosecution.
in. this case would not: be, improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta. “could, properly use his
diserétion.to authorize: proscecution:in this case.”

On May’ 19, 2008, Lefkowitz reached. out to Acosta to request. a meeting and specifically
asked that Acosta “not shunt:me‘off to one of your staff.” Lefkowitz made several;points in support.
of the request for a:mecting: (1) CEOS’s letter acknowledged, that federal prosecution of Epstein.
would, involve a “novel application” of relevant. federal statutes;'*° (2), CEOS’s conclusion that:
federal prosecution, would not. be “ait abuse..of diserction” was “hardly an. cndorsement” of the
case;!67 (3)'CEOS did not address Epstcin’s prosecutorial misconduct allcgations; and (4) “critical

new evidence,” in, the form, of recent defense counsel depositions: of''victims confirmed. “that:

166 Oosterbaan’s letter, stated, “Mr. Acosta can: soundly exercise his:authority-to decide to-pursue a:prosecution,
eyen, though it: smight involve arnov rel: application of a:federal,statute.” This statement referred tora defense argument
based.on a prior Departmental expression, of, concern, about a Congressional proposal,to expand: federal law to “adult;
prostitution, where no:force, fraud or-coereion was used” Oostebaan stated thatthe Department’ sefforts areyproperly
focused on the commercial sexual exploitation: of children?—ey en: if, wholly: local—and, “the exploitation of -adults
through force, ‘fraud, or, coercion.” THe; then-obseryed. that the fact “that:a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might:not: look,
precisely: like the cases that-came before:it is not dispositive?

167 Oosterbaan begarhis letter; however, by:making:it clear that'GEOS had considered “the:narrow question as
to: whether. there; is..a legitimate basis for ‘the U.S: Attorney’: s Offiee: to: proceed witha federal prosecution of
Mr. Epstein.”
