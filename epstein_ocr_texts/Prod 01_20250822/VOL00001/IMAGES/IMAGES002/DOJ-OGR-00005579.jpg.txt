permit this. As the Government has explained, for many of the subjects of the Government’s
motions, any evidence or argument is irrelevant, inadmissible, lacks a good faith basis, and is
highly prejudicial. The Court should preclude the defense from discussing these issues in its
opening statement or attempting to offer evidence relating to these issues at trial unless and until
the defense makes an offer of proof so that the Court can make evidentiary rulings. See United
States v. Randle, 745 F. App’x 422, 424 (2d Cir. 2018) (summary order) (““The making and timing
of opening statements can be left constitutionally to the informed discretion of the trial judge.’”
(quoting United States v. Salovitz, 701 F.2d 17, 21 (2d Cir. 1983)) (alteration omitted)); United
States v. Ahaiwe, No. 20 Cr. 179 (DLC), 2021 WL 2134922, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. May 26, 2021) (“The
Government’s motions to preclude defense counsel from making certain statements in its opening
statement or in its questioning of witnesses is granted with the following exceptions.”’). To proceed
otherwise would risk an improper defense opening statement or attempts to elicit other improper
evidence that could cause a mistrial.

A. The Court Should Preclude Evidence and Argument about Investigations of the
Defendant

A defendant has a “right to call witnesses in order to present a meaningful defense.” (Def.

Opp. at 28) (quoting United States v. Percoco, 13 F.4th 158, 177 (2d Cir. 2021)). “The right is

not, of course, unlimited; the defendant must comply with established rules of procedure and

evidence designed to assure both fairness and reliability.” Percoco, 13 F.4th at 177 (citation and

internal quotation marks omitted). For instance, “[a] federal court may preclude a defendant from

presenting a defense when the evidence in support of such a defense would be legally insufficient.”
