and | appreciate that you, understand ‘this and have no objection ‘to
our secking appellate review within.DOJ.

Starr, Lefkowitz, and Martin Wcinberg attended the March. 12, 2008 mecting, as well as
the former Principal Deputy Chief of CEOS, who had joined the Epstein, defense team.
Oosterbaan,, Mandelker, and..a, current CEOS ‘Deputy Chief represented the Department. The
current-CEOS Deputy. Chief told OPR that it was primarily.a “listening' session” ‘with Starr doing’
most ofthe: presentation. Qosterbaan told OPR that-he recalled “some back:and forth” beeause the
defense tcam:was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterbaan and.his Deputy Chicf: were
disturbed that the former'CEOS Principal. Deputy: Chief, who had:been.an aggressive ; advocate for
child exploitation, prosecutions, was. supporting the defense position, although according to the
‘CEOS Deputy. Chief, the former Principal Deputy’ Chief gave only a “weak ‘pitch” that; was not.
effective.

After the meeting, Starr and Lefkowitz made-multiple written submissions to:the Criminal,
Division., One submission provided.a lengthy list of USAO. actions that. “have caused. us serious

“Federal. involvement ‘in.a. state:criminal. prosecution without any:
communication with state authoritics”;!“

the issuance of legal process and document: requests for items, that
“had no. Connéction to the conduct at issue”:

Assistant United States Attorncys involved ‘in this. case” to serve ‘as
the victims’ attorncy representative;

the “insistence” ‘on a victim: notification letter inviting x the victims:to
the purported existence: of.a “relationship” between. Sloman and a
law firm. representing scveral, of the alleged victims in civil suits
against Epstein. '*

16s This: complaint appeared. to be cat odds with Villafafa’s understanding that: the defense objected. to USAO
communications ‘with the ‘state authorities. In “November 2007, Sloman ‘noted. to: Lefkowitz, “Your recent:
correspondence attempting. to restrict our Office. frony communicating with the State. Attorney's Office . . . raises
concern.” In.a March 2008 email reporting to, CEOS about ‘the; state case, Villafafia noted. that she did, not know:
whether;a state “misdemeanor deal. [was] back’on the table. because. the defense demanded, that we ‘have: no' contact
with the State Attorney’s Office. so I haven't spoken: with the [Assistant State Attorney] in over 6'months.” ’Villafaiia.
later: reported. to Acosta.and.Sloman that when Krischer complained to:her that the USAO ‘had not been communicating:
with him, she explained.to: Krischer, that “it-was the:;defense who were blocking the; channels of communication.”

165 In approximately 200.1, Sloman briefly left the USAO and for.a.few months*was ‘in private practice with’ a
‘Miami ‘attorney, whose ‘practice! ‘specialized in. plaintiffs’ sexual.:abuse: claims., During 2007-2008, the attorney
