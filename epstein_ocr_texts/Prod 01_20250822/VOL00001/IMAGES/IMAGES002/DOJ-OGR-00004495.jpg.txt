Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 198 of 349

sex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had ‘then, recently passed ‘the
PROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the: exploitation: of minors,was “an important. fedcral
interest,” which, in Epstcin’s case was compounded by the “sordidness” of the acts involved. and.
the number of victims.

It is. also clear that; because: the state case against Epstcin, was still pending and had not.
reached a,conviction, acquittal, or other decision on the; merits, the Petite policy did net.apply and.
certainly did not preclude. a. federal. prosecution. of. Epstein. He had been. charged ‘with one state
charge ‘of solicitation. to prostitution on three occasions, involving one ‘or more other persons
without regard to age—a. charge that: would have addressed ‘only: a.scant: portion ‘of the ‘conduct:
under fedcral, investigation. Acosta acknowledged to OPR. that the Petite policy “on. its face” did.
not. apply: Morcover; the State Attorney did not: challenge the federal. government’s assumption
of:prosccutorial:-responsibility, and:despite-having obtained.an.indictment, held back on proceeding
with the: state prosccution. in deference to: the federal. government’s involvement. In. these
‘circumstances, the USAO was .free:to proceed. with. a prosecution sufficient to ensure: vindication.
of the federal interest. ‘in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to’prey-upon minors.
The federal government was uniquely positioned, to fully investigate the conduct of an, individual.
who engaged in repeated criminal conduct, in. Florida. but, who also traveled extensively and, had,
residences. outside of Florida. Even ifthe, Petite. policy had. applicd, OPR has little doubt that ‘the
USAO could-have.obtained.authorization.from the-Department.to proceed with a:prosecution- under

the circumstances of this case.?"

Despite:theundeniable federal. interest:in-prosccuting Epstein, the fact.that the Petite:policy
did not apply, and the State Attorney’s willingness to, hold.'the, state, prosecution in abeyance
pending xthe federal:g government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal. government's
role in prosccuting, Epstcin as limited. by’principles of federalism. 46 In, essence, Acosta. believed.

that a federal prosecution, would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He
explained his reasoning to OPR:

aan In .2008;. the Office of Enforeement Operations; the office charged. with :reviewing Petite policy walver

requests; opined; that: even, ifthe Petite policy: applied with: respect to, the victims of.the indicted state char ges, It Ww ould
not: apply to federal prosecution, of char ges relating. to.any other victim. The: office also noted that:if ‘other factors
existed, such as‘use‘of the;internet to: contact v ictims, those factors might warrant awaiver of the: policy; if-it:did apply.
ca In:;commenting-on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counscl.argued that-OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s,
concerns from.those:of the-other subjects: However, OPR’s investigation madc:clear that, although Acosta shared his
subordinates’ concerns, about the strength of: the case, victim-witness credibility, and the; novelty of some legal
theories, he; ialone focused, on federalism issues. Acosta*s:-counsel. also asserted, that: OPR “misunderstands. ‘and,
devalues Secretary Acosta’s, very: real. and legitimate interest in. ‘the development of human trafficking ‘laws,” cand,
counsel:further noted. Acosta’s concerns'that’*bringing a-case: with serous evidentiary:challenges:pressing novel legal
issues could-result:in-an.outcome that:sct back'the development of trafticking.laws and-resulted.in.an.aggregate greater
harm. to: trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully ‘considered. counsel’s arguments: and. agrees that.it was
appropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of: Epstein might: have forthe: ‘Department’s anti-
trafficking:cfforts; OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the-matter through,the NPA, which,

for the; reasons discussed. in this Section, failed to: satisfy the federal interest and allowed Epstein. to, manipulate the
state system to his’benefit:
