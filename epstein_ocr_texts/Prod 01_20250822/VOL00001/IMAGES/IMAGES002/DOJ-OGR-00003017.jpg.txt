Moreover, even if the Court were to determine that a twenty-six-year period of delay were
applicable here, the defendant’s motion should be dismissed because she failed to show that the
Government acted improperly to obtain a tactical advantage. See, e.g., Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL
4043140 (denying motion to dismiss for pre-indictment delay as to conduct charged in 2016
involving sexual abuse of minors from 1998 to 2007 as defendant failed to satisfy both prongs of
pre-indictment delay standard); United States v. Burke, No. 09 Cr. 135 (SJ), 2011 WL 2609837,
at *7 (E.D.N.Y. July 1, 2011) (denying motion to dismiss indictment based on thirty-year pre-

(RCC), 2004 WL 2222145 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2004) (in a racketeering conspiracy case in which
a 14-year-old murder was alleged as a predicate act, finding that, even assuming defendant had
shown actual prejudice, defendant’s motion to dismiss based on pre-indictment delay failed
because defendant supplied no evidence that government’s conduct was for an improper purpose).

The defendant claims that the Government intentionally delayed the indictment in this case

“has been advantageous to the government to have aggressive lawyers collecting information from
Ms. Maxwell as part of civil discovery and disseminating that information to the public, as part of
an ongoing campaign to vilify Ms. Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 7 at 16). She again cites the subpoena
the Government issued to Boies Schiller & Flexner LLP (“Boies Schiller”) to obtain materials
from the Giuffre civil litigation. (/d.). Leaving aside the fact that, as set forth in Section IV, the
Government obtained such materials through a judicially approved and entirely appropriate
