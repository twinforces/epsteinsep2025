B. The Government Has Failed to Carry its Burden to Establish the Extraordinary
Need to Use Fake Names

The government’s motion to use false names and suppress evidence from the public falls
short in both evidence and analysis. Other than conclusory arguments by lawyers, the motion
contains no facts supporting any of the claims related to future reputational harm or
embarrassment. As the proponent of this extraordinary measure, the government cannot simply
hypothesize that, as to adult women
hc
use of false names here will “protect [their] well-being, prevent undue embarrassment and other
adverse consequences, including loss of employment, and prevent the victims from being
harassed by the press and others.” Mot. at 10. It is the government’s burden to establish that,

a some reason exists to proceed by pseudonym. That “burden is not, of course, discharged by
mere conclusory or ipse dixit assertions, for any such rule would foreclose meaningful inquiry”
into the issue. Jn re Bonanno, 344 F.2d 830, 833 (2d Cir. 1965).
