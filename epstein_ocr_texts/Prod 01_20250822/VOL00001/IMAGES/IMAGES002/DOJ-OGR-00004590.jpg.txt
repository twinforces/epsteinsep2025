Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21. Page 293 of 349

strongly objected. to the government’s plan to notify victims:of the state proceedings, ‘which, he
described, as, “highly inappropriate” and. ‘an. “intrusion. into state, affairs, when, the identified,
individuals are not even:victims of the crime for which Mr. Epstein is being x sentenced.”

Thereafter—at a‘time when the: USAO believed. Epstein’s plea-to be imminent—Villafafia
drafted, and Sloman. signed, the December 6, 2007 Ictter ‘to ‘Lefkowitz; rejecting the: defense
arguments regarding notification and. reiterating: the USAO’s'position that the victims identified in,
the federal investigation, be invited to appear at:the state plea hearing. The Ictter'took an expansive
view of the applicable statutés by contending that both the CVRA arid. the VRRA. required. the
USAO to notify: the: victims of:the state: procecdings:

[T]hese sections are not limited to proceedings. in, a federal district
court. ‘Our Non-Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal
investigation. by allowing Mr. Epstcin to plead to a state. offense.
The ‘victims: identified through the federal. ‘investigation should be
appropriately informed, and our Non-Prosccution. Agreement: does
not require the U.S. Attorney’ s Office to forego [sic] ‘its legal,
obligations.*!*

The letter also asserted. that the VRRA obligated the USAO to provide the victims with.
information concerning; restitution to which they may: be entitled and “the eur liest possible” notice
of the status of the investigation, the filing of charges, and:the acceptance of'a. plea. Along with.
the Ictter; Sloman forwarded a revised draft victim, notification, letter to Lefkowitz for his
comments. This draft victim. notification letter stated, that. the federal. investigation. had been
completed, Epstcin would plead guilty in state court, the partics would:recommend.18 months of.
imprisonment-at:sentencing, and-Epstein would compensate victims for monctary:damages claims
brought under 18 U.S.C. § 2255. The draft. victim, notification letter provided specific.information.
conecrning the upcoming change of plea hearing and invited, the victims to ‘attend or provide: a.
written Statenient to the State Attorney’s Office. When Lefkowitz asked, Sloman to:delay sending
victim:notifieations until after a discussion of their contents, Sloman.instructed Villafafia, who was
preparing, letters for transmittal. to 30. victims, ‘to “Hold. the Ictter.” During his OPR interview,
Sloman recalled that he had “wanted to: push the Ictter out,” but he “must have had. a conversation,
with somebody” about: whether the CVRA applied, and. based on, that conversation he directed,
Villafafia to hold the letter.

In. his response letter to. Acosta, .Lcfkowitz contended. that the _ government had.
misinterpreted both the: CVRA.and VRRA, because neither applied to: the “public proceeding’ in,
this matter [which] will. be in.state court for the purpose of the entry of.a plea, on, state: charges.”

416 Sloman. told, Lefkowitz the USAO did, not seck to, “federalize”..a state plea, but “is simply informing ‘the
victims of their rights.” Slomanialso addressed the defense attorneys’ objection to advising the victims'that they could
contact ‘Villafaiia or the:EBI case agent with: questions ; or coneerns by: referencing:the CVRA, noting; “Again, federal
law requires that victims have the: ‘reasonable right to:confer with the attorney for the Gov ernment in.this case.”
