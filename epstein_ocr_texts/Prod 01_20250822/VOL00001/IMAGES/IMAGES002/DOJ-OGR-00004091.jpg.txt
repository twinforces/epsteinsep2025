Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
On April 30, 2021, defense counsel requested that the Court issue an order directing the
MDC to accept two hard drives from defense counsel that contain the non-Highly Confidential
discovery in this case for Ms. Maxwell’s use. Dkt. No. 260. On May 4, 2021, the Court
received the attached email from MDC legal counsel indicating that MDC does not oppose the
defense’s request and that MDC staff will coordinate with defense counsel so that Ms. Maxwell
can receive the hard drives.
In light of this, defense counsel’s April 30, 2021 request appears moot. Defense counsel
shall raise any further issues regarding their request within two weeks of this order.
SO ORDERED. AM fh we
