credibility issues, and the absence of direct or corroborative proof by which to substantiate
her claim, led the district attorney to believe that the case presented “insufficient, credible,
and admissible evidence upon which any charge could be sustained beyond a reasonable
doubt.” Press Release, 2/17/2005 (cleaned up). Given his “conclu[sion] that a conviction
under the circumstances of this case would be unattainable,” D.A. Castor “decline[d] to
authorize the filing of criminal charges in connection with this matter.” /d. In light of the
non-prosecution decision, Cosby no longer was exposed to criminal liability relating to the
Constand allegations and thus could no longer invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege

determining “whether there is evidence in the record to justify the trial court’s findings.”
ld. at 1199 n.6. “If so, this Court is bound by them.” /d. However, while “we accord
deference to a trial court with regard to factual findings, our review of legal conclusions is
de novo.” /d. at n.7 (citation omitted). Indeed, it is a long-standing appellate principle
that, “[w]ith respect to [] inferences and deductions from facts and [] conclusions of
