Publicity. concerning pretrial suppression hearings such as'the one ‘involved. in
the present case poses special risks: of-unfairness. The'whole purpose of such
hearings is to: screen out unreliable or illegally obtained evidence and insure:

during a pretrial procceding, however, it may never be:altogether kept from

potential jurors.
