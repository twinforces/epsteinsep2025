Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s Order dated
April 16, 2021, which directed the Government to confirm that it has complied with its discovery
obligations with respect to the non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) between Jeffrey Epstein and
the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida (“SDFL”). (Dkt. No. 207).
A. Overview
The Government takes its discovery and disclosure obligations seriously, and it has
endeavored to take an expansive approach with respect to those obligations throughout the
pendency of this case. In particular, the Government carefully formulated its discovery and
disclosure plan in this case to ensure that it not only satisfies its Rule 16, Brady, Giglio, and Jencks
Act obligations with respect to the materials already in the possession of the prosecution team, but
that it also makes reasonable efforts to identify other potentially disclosable material within the
files of other investigative agencies who are not part of this prosecution team. This approach was
formulated in close consultation with multiple layers of supervisors within the U.S. Attorney’s
Office for the Southern District of New York. The Government set forth its intentions with respect
