4. The USAO-SDNY Commences the Instant Investigation in 2018

On or about November 29, 2018, the USAO-SDNY initiated its investigation into Epstein
and possible co-conspirators, and formally opened the investigation by completing the requisite
paperwork to open an investigation on or about November 30, 2018. The investigation was
prompted by a series of articles published by the Miami Herald earlier that same week relating to
Epstein, his conduct, and the circumstances of his prior conviction. See Julie K. Brown, “Even
from Jail, Sex Abuser Manipulated the System. His Victims Were Kept in the Dark,” Miami
Herald (Nov. 28, 2018).*!_AUSA-1 was not involved in the decision to open the investigation or
in the investigation itself. (See Ex. 4 at 6). Indeed, AUSA-1 stopped serving as the Office’s
Human Trafficking and Project Safe Childhood Coordinator as of April 2017.

Shortly after initiating the investigation, the prosecutors involved in the investigation
learned of the prior February 2016 meeting and requested copies of AUSA-1’s notes and records
31 Indeed, on July 8, 2019, at the press conference following the arrest of Epstein, Geoffrey S.
Berman, then United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, stated that while he
was not “going to go into any aspects of how our investigation originated[,] I will say that we were
assisted from some excellent investigative journalism.”
