after the assault; and (v) Ms. Constand had contacted civil attorneys to pursue financial
compensation through a lawsuit against Mr. Cosby. (/d. at 9-10).
DA Castor issued a signed public statement declining to prosecute Mr. Cosby, which he
viewed as, and Mr. Cosby’s lawyers understood to be, an agreement that Mr. Cosby would never
be prosecuted for the events involving Ms. Constand. (/d. at 10-13, 16-18). Believing that he no
longer had a basis to assert his Fifth Amendment rights, Mr. Cosby testified at several depositions
in a civil suit brought against him by Ms. Constand and made inculpatory admissions. (/d. at 13-
15). Ten years later, the successor District Attorney, Risa Vetri Ferman, used those admissions to
charge Mr. Cosby with the same crimes related to the sexual assault of Ms. Constand that were
covered by DA Castor’s promise. (/d. at 18). Mr. Cosby was convicted of those charges at trial.
(Id. at 38).
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held that DA Castor’s promise was enforceable and that
DA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later on the same charges violated his Due
Process rights. (/d. at 78-79). Asa result, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (/d. at 79).
In so holding, the Court noted the following:
Interactions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including
circumstances where the latter seeks enforcement of some promise or
assurance made by the former, are not immune from the dictates of due
process and fundamental fairness.

(Id. at 55).

The same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the government is trying
to renege on its agreement and prosecute Ms. Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same
offenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even more
strongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal written agreement, as opposed to
an informal promise like the one in Cosby. This is not consistent with principles of fundamental
fairness.

Accordingly, for the reasons already set forth in our supplemental pretrial motions, and the
principles discussed in Cosby, the Court should hold the government to its agreement and dismiss
Counts One, Three, Five, and Six of the $2 Indictment.
