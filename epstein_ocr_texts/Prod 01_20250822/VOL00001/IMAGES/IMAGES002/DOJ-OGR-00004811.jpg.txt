after the assault; and (v).Ms.:Constand-had contacted. civil attorneys to pursuc: financial.
compensation through. a. lawsuit. against, Mr. Cosby. (/d. at-9-10).

DA. Gastorissued,a signed public statement declining to prosecute Mr. Cosby, which he
viewed as, and. Mr. Cosby’s lawyers understood to be,:an agreement that Mr. Cosby would. never
be:prosecuted for the events involving-Ms. Constand. (/d: at 10-13, 16-18). Believing that he:no
longer had a basis-to assert his Fifth. Amendment rights, Mr. Cosby testificd at-several depositions
in,a civil, suit brought ‘against:him, by Ms. Constand and:made:inculpatory admissions. (/d. at, 13-
15). ‘Ten: years later, ‘the successor r District. Attorney, Risa. Vetri Ferman; used those admissions ‘to
covered by. DA. Castor’ s promise. a at tl 8). Mr. Cosby ‘was convicted of those: charges at trial,
(id. at: 38).

The Pennsylvania Supreme Court: held that DA Castor’s promise'was, cnforecable and that
DA. Ferman’s prosecution. of Mr. Cosby ten years later on the same charges violated his Due
Process rights: (/d. at’ 78-79). As a ‘result, the Court-vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (/d.at.79).
In so holding, the Court noted the following:

Interactions between a-prosecutor.and a criminal, defendant, including
circumstances where the latter secks criforcement of some promise or
assurance ‘made by the former, are not. immune from the dictates of duc
‘process and, fundamental fairness.

(/d. at:55).

The same:principlé applics:to. Ms. Maxwell’s case. Asin Cosby, the government is trying
to renege on.its agreement and prosecute Ms.. Maxwell. over 25 years later for the exact same
offenses for which she was granted immunity in the NPA. ‘Indced, the principle applics even more:
strongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because’the NPA, wasa. formal written agreement, as opposed to
‘an, informal:promise like the one in. Cosby. This is not. consistent-with principles: of fundamental
fairness.

Accordingly, for the reasons: already’ set forth 1 in‘our supplemental. pretrial, motions, and:the

principles: discussed in © ‘osby, the Court should hold the government-to its agreement and. dismiss
Counts One, Three, Five, and. Six of the $2 Indictment.
