engage in commercial sex acts knowing that [Accuser-4] was under 18”)).° Pursuant to the
terms of the NPA, the proposed indictment was never returned, and the USAO-SDFL did not
pursue it further, once Epstein pled guilty on June 30, 2008 to Florida state law charges of
solicitation of prostitution and procurement of minors to engage in prostitution. (Ex. A, OPR
Report at i-ii).

The similarity of the allegations presented to the SDFL grand jury and those alleged in
Counts Five and Six of the $2 Indictment is striking and self-evident. The same overt acts,
including the allegations that form the basis for jurisdiction in SDNY over the crimes charged in
Counts Five and Six, were presented to both grand juries. Furthermore, the proof offered to
corroborate Accuser-4’s allegations—e.g., cell phone records, FedEx records, message pad
notes, etc_—was identical. (See Ex. C at 56:21-57:10). The chart below highlights these
similarities:

> The government previously denied Ms. Maxwell’s request that it produce copies of the proposed 60-count SDFL
indictment and the related 82-page prosecution memo to the defense. To resolve any ambiguity about the charges in
the proposed SDFL indictment and the evidence underlying the counts related to Accuser-4, Ms. Maxwell requests
the Court to order the government to produce both of these documents to the defense.
