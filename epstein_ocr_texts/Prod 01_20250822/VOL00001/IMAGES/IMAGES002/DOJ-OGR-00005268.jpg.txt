ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

At the telephone conference scheduled to take place on October 21, 2021, in which the
Court will discuss jury selection matters and logistics with the parties, the Court will hear from
counsel regarding the unopposed request to seal their joint proposed juror questionnaire and voir
dire. See Dkt. No. 339. The Court will also inquire as to whether the sealing request extends to
the Court’s draft questionnaire and voir dire and any justification for such sealing.

In the meantime, the Court will today transmit via email its draft questionnaire and draft
voir dire to the parties so that the drafts can be discussed at the conference tomorrow. After the
Court explains how jury selection will proceed, the parties should be prepared to raise any
objections to the Court’s draft questionnaire and voir dire.

SO ORDERED.
