1838255, at *1, 4-6 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2014). (denying motion fo dismiss indictment. charging
enticement of a minor, in’violation of 18 U.S.C. 2423(a), “between-in or.about 2000 to in.or about
2004,” because “the Indictment states. all. the elements ‘of the crime charged by tracking the
‘statutory language,” as, well ‘as “the nature of the criminal activity” and “the underlying facts”).

“This is specially’ truc in, cases of sexual, abuse of children: allegations, of sexual. abuse. of
underage victims ‘often, proceed ‘without specific dates of offenses,” including “[i]n, cases of
continuing'sexual.abuse,” for which “it is sufficient.for the indictment to specify: a period of timc
rather than.a specific. date—in which.defendant committed the acts :at issue...” United'States v.
Young, No. 08 Cr. 285 (KMK), 2008 WL 4178190, at. *2 (S.D-N:Y. Sept. 4, 2008) (internal,

2994449, at *5 (S.D.N-Y. Oct. 15, 2007)). ‘Indeed, “[b]ecause minors often are:not. capable of

The same is,truc here. The minor’victims in this case cannot reasonably be expected to recall the
exact dates: when particular instances of abuse took place ‘during their adolescence. This is
especially so for Minor Victim-1, who experienced. numerous instances of abuse over multiple
years of her:youth. Providing the approximate ranges of dates during which. the offenses took’
place fully satisfies the requirements ofan. adequately pled. charging instrument. The defendant.
cites no authority to'the contrary, and her motion to dismiss, should accordingly be denied.

Third, the Indictment lists in, cleat detail the allegations relevant to cach. clemenit of every
‘criminal statute for which she is charged. Beyond simply “parroting the language ‘of a federal

criminal. statute,” Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. at 108, the Indictment provides extensive. detail
