1838255, at *1, 4-6 (W.D.N.Y. May 8, 2014) (denying motion to dismiss indictment charging
enticement of a minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. 2423(a), “between in or about 2000 to in or about
2004,” because “the Indictment states all the elements of the crime charged by tracking the
statutory language,” as well as “the nature of the criminal activity” and “the underlying facts’).

“This is especially true in cases of sexual abuse of children: allegations of sexual abuse of
underage victims often proceed without specific dates of offenses,” including “[iJ]n cases of
continuing sexual abuse,” for which “it is sufficient for the indictment to specify a period of time—
rather than a specific date—in which defendant committed the acts at issue... .” United States v.
Young, No. 08 Cr. 285 (KMK), 2008 WL 4178190, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 4, 2008) (internal
quotation mark omitted) (quoting Edwards v. Mazzuca, No. 00 Civ. 2290 (RJS), 2007 WL
2994449, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 15, 2007)). Indeed, “[b]Jecause minors often are not capable of
remembering the exact dates when the alleged acts occurred, ‘fairly large time windows in the
context of child abuse prosecutions are not in conflict with constitutional notice requirements.’”
Young, 2008 WL 4178190, at *2 (quoting Valentine v. Konteh, 395 F.3d 626, 632 (6th Cir. 2005)).
The same is true here. The minor victims in this case cannot reasonably be expected to recall the
exact dates when particular instances of abuse took place during their adolescence. This is
especially so for Minor Victim-1, who experienced numerous instances of abuse over multiple
years of her youth. Providing the approximate ranges of dates during which the offenses took
place fully satisfies the requirements of an adequately pled charging instrument. The defendant
cites no authority to the contrary, and her motion to dismiss should accordingly be denied.

Third, the Indictment lists in clear detail the allegations relevant to each element of every
criminal statute for which she is charged. Beyond simply “parroting the language of a federal
criminal statute,” Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.S. at 108, the Indictment provides extensive detail
