government informed any victim about the potential for resolving the federal investigation through
a state plea.

A. The Case Agents and Villafafia Solicit Some Victims’ Opinions about

Resolving the Federal Investigation

Villafafia told OPR that when she and the case agents met with victims, “we would ask
them how they wanted the case to be resolved.”7*!

And most of them wanted the case to be resolved via a plea. Some
of them wanted him not to be prosecuted at all. Most of them did
not want to have to come to court and testify. They were very
worried about their privacy rights. Some of them wanted him to go
to jail. But... [s]ome of them talked about bad experiences with
the State Attorney’s Office. And so, I felt like sending them back to
the State Attorney’s Office was not something that they would have
supported.

Villafafia told OPR that she also recalled that some victims “expressed . . . concern about
their safety,” and were worried that Epstein would find out about their participation in the
investigation. In her 2017 declaration submitted in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that the
two CVRA petitioners “never communicated [their] desires to me or the FBI case agents and my
role was to evaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all of the victims, and
allow the Office to exercise its prosecutorial discretion accordingly.”** She also noted that some
victims “fear[ed] having their involvement with Epstein revealed and the negative impact it would
have on their relationships with family members, boyfriends, and others.”

In the FBI case agent’s 2017 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, she stated, “During
interviews conducted from 2006 to 2008, no victims expressed a strong opinion that Epstein be
prosecuted.” She further described the concerns of some of the victims:

Throughout the investigation, we interviewed many [of Epstein’s]

victims .... A majority of the victims expressed concern about the

possible disclosure of their identities to the public. A number of the

victims raised concerns about having to testify and/or their parents

finding out about their involvement with Mr. Epstein. Additionally,
26 Villafafia created for OPR a chart listing victims identified in the state and federal investigations, with
notations indicating several with whom Villafafia recalled discussing their opinions about resolving the case. The
chart, however, does not indicate what the victims said, and Villafafia told OPR that the information contained in the
chart was based on her memory of her interactions with each victim. OPR was unable to determine the details or
extent of any such discussions occurring before September 24, 2007, because Villafafia did not have contemporaneous
notes of the interviews, and the FBI reports and corresponding notes of the interviews did not contain information
about the victims’ desired outcomes. The victims who provided information to OPR did not recall discussing potential
resolution of the federal investigation with anyone from the government.
282 In the declaration, Villafafia stated, “Jane Doe 2 specifically told me that she did not want Epstein
prosecuted.”
