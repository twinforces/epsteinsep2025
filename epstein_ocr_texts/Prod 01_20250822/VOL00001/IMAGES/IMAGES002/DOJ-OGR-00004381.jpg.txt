Re: Jeffrey Epstein
Dear Lilly:

Thank you for your letter of August 2™ regarding your proposal on how to resolve the
Epstein matter.

As we explained at our meeting on July 31, 2007, the Office believes that the federal
interest will not be vindicated in the absence of a two-year term of state imprisonment for
Mr. Epstein. That offer was not meant as a starting point for negotiations, it is the minimum
term of imprisonment that will obviate the need for federal prosecution. The Office has
never agreed that a state prison sentence is not appropriate for Mr. Epstein. Rather we
simply stated that if Mr. Epstein preferred to serve his sentence in a federal penctentiary, we
would be willing to explore a federal conviction that may allow that in lieu of any state
resolution. Further, as | made clear in our follow up telephone conversation after the
mecting, a plea to two federal misdemeanors was never extended or meant as an offer,

We also would reiterate that the agreement to Section 2255 liability applies to all of
the minor girls identified during the federal investigation, not just the 12 that form the basis
of an initial planned charging instrument,

As you know, the ability to engage in flexible plea negotiations is dramatically
changed upon the return of an indictment. Once an indictment is returned, the Office does
not intend to file a Superseding Information containing a lesser charge or to dismiss the case
in favor of state prosecution.
