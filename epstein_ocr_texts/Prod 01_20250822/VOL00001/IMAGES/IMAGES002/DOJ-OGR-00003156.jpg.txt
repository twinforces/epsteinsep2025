local rules/ rules-2018-10-29.pdf. Moreover, the Rules do not describe—much less limit—what
matters may be heard by what grand jury. Cf SDNY Business Division Rule 6 (describing
proceedings after an indictment has been returned). Rather, the Rules provide only that once an
indictment is returned, “[t]he U.S. attorney designates on the criminal cover sheet that the case is
to be assigned to White Plains if the crime was allegedly committed in whole or in predominant
part in the Northern Counties.” SDNY Business Division Rule 18(b)). Furthermore, the Rules
specifically contemplate that cases may be reassigned from one courthouse to another. SDNY
Business Division Rule 19. Consistent with these Rules, it is common for cases to be indicted by
grand juries sitting in the White Plains courthouse and tried in the Manhattan courthouse. See,
e.g., United States v. Israel, 05 Cr. 1039 (CM), Dkt. No. 25; United States v. Cromitie, et al., 09
Cr. 558 (CM), Dkt. No. 183, 200; United States v. Annabi, 10 Cr. 07 (CM), Dkt. No. 45; United
States v. Arici, 12 Cr. 24 (LAP), Dkt. No. 115, 117; United States v. Reeves, et al., 16 Cr. 372
(VEC), Dkt. No. 51; United States v. Guerrier, 18 Cr. 284 (JSR), Dkt. No. 98.

De The SDNY Jury Plan
The Jury Selection and Service Act of 1968, 28 U.S.C. § 1861 ef seg. (the “JSSA”),
provides the structure for the selection of juries in federal district courts. The JSSA requires each
district to “devise and place into operation a written plan for random selection of grand and petit
jurors....” 28 U.S.C. § 1863(a). Each district in New York selects grand and petit juries pursuant
to a plan adopted by the judges of the district and approved by the Judicial Conference of the
Second Circuit. /d.; see also United States v. Bahna, 68 F.3d 19, 23 (2d Cir. 1995). The plan for
the Southern District has been in place since February 2009. See Amended Plan for the Random
Selection of Grand and Petit Jurors in the Southern District of New York, available at
