when prosecutors have used third parties as leverage in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have
made clear, however, that a plea is not invalid when entered under an agreement that includes a
promise of leniency towards a third party or in response to a prosecutor’s threat to prosecute a third
party if a plea is not entered. See, e.g., United States v. Marquez, 909 F.2d 738, 741-42 (2d Cir.
1990) (rejecting claim that plea was involuntary because of pressure placed upon a defendant by
the government’s insistence that a defendant’s wife would not be offered a plea bargain unless he
pled guilty); Martin v. Kemp, 760 F.2d 1244, 1248 (11th Cir. 1985) (in order to satisfy “heavy
burden” of establishing that the government had not acted “in good faith,” a defendant challenging
voluntariness of his plea on grounds that the prosecutor had threatened to bring charges against
the defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish that government lacked probable cause to believe
the defendant’s wife had committed a crime at the time it threatened to charge her); Stinson v.
State, 839 So. 2d 906, 909 (Fla. App. 2003) (“In cases involving . . . a promise not to prosecute a
third party, the government must act in good faith . . . [and] must have probable cause to charge
the third party.”’).

The second context concerns situations in which courts have enforced prosecutors’
promises of leniency to third parties. For example, in State v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.
1997), as consideration for the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and announced in
open court that the government would dismiss charges against the defendant’s niece and nephew,
who had all been charged as a result of the same incident. When the state reneged and attempted
to prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial court dismissed the charges against them, and the state
appealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law
principles, the niece and nephew were third-party beneficiaries of the plea agreement and were
therefore entitled to enforce it.

Apart from voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a
prosecutor’s promise not to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of
prosecutorial discretion.

D. State Bar Rules

During the period relevant to this Report, the five subject attorneys were members of the
bar in several different states and were subject to the rules of professional conduct in each state in
which they held membership.'?’ In determining which rules apply, OPR applied the local rules of
the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida (Local Rules) and the choice-of-law
provisions of each applicable bar. Local Rule 11.1(f) incorporates rules governing the admission,
practice, peer review, and discipline of attorneys (Attorney Admission Rules).'?* Attorney
Admission Rule 4(d) provides that any U.S. Attorney or AUSA employed full-time by the
government may appear and participate in particular actions or proceedings on behalf of the United
States in the attorney’s official capacity without petition for admission. Any attorney so appearing
ml The subjects’ membership in state bars other than Florida would not affect OPR’s conclusions in this case.
198 These rules have been in effect since December 1994.
