when prosecutors have ‘uscd third parties as leverage: in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have:
made clear, however, that a plea ‘is ‘not ‘invalid ‘when. entered under an ‘agreement that ‘ineludes a.
promise of Icniency towards a third party or‘in response to a prosccutor’s threat to prosecute'a.third
party if-a plea is not'cntered. See, e.g., Winited States ¥. Marquez, 909: F.2d 738, 741-42 (2d Cir.
1990) (rejecting claim that plea ‘was s involuntary because of pressure Placed upon.a defendant ‘by
pled guilty); Mar tin V. “Kemp, 760 F, 2d 1244, 1248 (1 Ith, Cir. “1985) (in order to satisfy, “heavy
burden” of establishing that-the government: had not acted “in good.faith,” a defendant challenging:
voluntariness of his plea on grounds that. the prosecutor had. threatened. to bring charges against.
the defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish. that government lacked. probable cause to believe:
the defendant’s wife had committed a crime at the: time it: threatened. to charge her); Stinson v.

Slate, 839 So, 2d.906, 909. (Fla. App. 2003) (“In cases involving. ....a‘promise ‘not to prosecute a.
third. party, the government must act in. good ‘faith . . . [and] must. have probable cause 'to charge
the third party.”).

_ The second context: concerns situations in which courts have enforced Peers
1997), as consideration for: ‘the defendant’s Ss ‘guilty ‘plea, ‘the prosecutor vvagreed and, announced i in,
open court that the government would dismiss charges against*the defendant’s nicce and nephew,
who had all been, charged as.a result of the. same incident. When the state reneged and attempted
to prosecute the niece:and nephew, the trial. court dismissed the charges against them, and.the:state
appealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law
principles, the niece and nephew were third-party’ bencficiarics of the plea agreement and were
therefore entitled to enforce it.

Apart from. voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not. suggested that a
prosccutor’s promise not: to ‘prosecute a third. party amounts ‘to an. inappropriate exercise of
prosecutorial diserction.
