public, and so punishable in itself”). Indeed, “[i]t is well settled that the essential elements of
the crime of conspiracy are: (1) that the defendant agreed with at least one other person to commit
an offense; (2) the defendant knowingly participated in the conspiracy with the specific intent to
commit the offenses that were the objects of the conspiracy; and (3) that during the existence of
the conspiracy, at least one of the overt acts set forth in the indictment was committed by one or
more of the members of the conspiracy in furtherance of the objectives of the conspiracy.” United
States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 145-46 (2d Cir. 1998).

Because a conspiracy does not require the completion of a substantive crime, it does not
matter whether Minor Victim-3 was ever in fact transported as a minor, or whether the elements
of the substantive crimes of transportation an enticement are satisfied as to her. See Salinas, 522
U.S. at 65. What matters is whether the Indictment properly alleges that the defendant agreed to
participate in schemes to transport and entice minors to travel with the intent that an illegal sex act
would be committed, and whether the allegations at issue are relevant and admissible evidence of
that conspiracy. Here, that is plainly the case. As alleged, the defendant’s participation in
recruiting and grooming Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts as a minor with Epstein during the
period charged in the Indictment, is itself evidence of the defendant’s agreements with Epstein to
identify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.*’ Moreover, the
>’ The defendant takes issue with the Indictment’s reference to these sex acts as “abuse” because,
she asserts, Minor Victim-3 was above the age of consent in the United Kingdom at the time they
occurred. The description in the Indictment is factually accurate, however, because Minor Victim-
3 will testify to her subjective experience of these acts with a much older man as traumatic,
exploitative, and abusive at trial. While the Government will be careful to avoid suggesting to the
jury that any consensual act committed after Minor Victim-3 was at or above the age of consent
was itself criminal (as opposed to evidence of the charged conspiracies), to the extent defense
counsel wishes to request a particular limiting instruction or to seek authorization for a particular
line of cross-examination regarding the legality of any sex acts that took place in London, the
appropriate forum to do so is in a motion in limine.
