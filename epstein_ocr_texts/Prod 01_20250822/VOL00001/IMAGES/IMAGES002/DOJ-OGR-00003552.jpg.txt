Indeed, the Chemical Bank opinion specifically: rejected judicial protection for the type of
information the Protective Order appears to cover in the Litigation:

Avoiding embarrassment may be a reason for’ a party to seck
confidentiality. It'is not by: itself'a valid-reason for courts to: uphold
confidentiality as against a legitimate law cnforeement:nced for the
information. Courts ‘must honor restrictions laid:down, by the Fourt
or Fifth Amendment or applicable statutes. But aside from. those
restrictions, hiding po ssible ériminal vidlations from law
enforcement authorities is hardly a ground, for judicial protection.of
confidentiality.

Chemical Bank, 154°F-R.D. at 94 (emphasis added). Although parties may rely on, confidentiality.
agreements and ‘protective orders génerally,:such classification “is not. binding on. the court” and,
the “risk of: disclosure, is ‘well.known to'the, Bat, if part because, disclosure may be required’where
such information is :necded for judicial decisions, to the basis for which. the public: should. have
access. Id. (collecting cases).

Undér some circumstances, courts in this Circuit have applied a balancing test’to evaluate:
the government’s ability to obtain.acecss to matcrials covered by a protective, order. Specifically,
in. Martindell v. International tel. and Lel. Corp., $94 F.2d 29.1, (2d. Cir. 1979), the government.
informally—and.without-use ofa grand.jury: subpoena—sought access to discovery-materials from,
‘a, civil, litigation. The ‘Court held that the Government: was:not entitled. to the materials unless it:
could show’ cither that the :protective order was ‘improvidently. granted or some extraordinary’
circumstance, or compelling need. for the material; sce also Jn re Grand Jury Subpoena Dices
Tecum Dated Apr. L9, 199] (“Subpoena, Duces Fecum?), 945 F.2d 1221, 1224: (2d Cir. 1991) (in.
‘connection with. ‘bankruptcy proceeding, and. citing Murtindell, vacating denial of a motion to
quash ‘a. grand jury. subpoena sccking production of documents subject to protective order and.
remanding for determination, of showing that the order was improyidently granted or of
extraordinary circumstance or Compelling need).

Asan initial matter, the Court need:not employ the Martindell balancing test here. This. is
so for twovrcasons. First, Martindell and cases employing its balancing test. gencrally relate’ to
motions, to quash or other challenges to a grand jury subpoena, or clse instances where the
Government sought protected, information withoir such. grand jury process. Seé Martindell, 594
F.2d 291 (in. which, the government informally, and without-use of.a g grand. jury subpoena, sought.
access, to discovery materials); Subpoena Duces ‘Lecum, 945 F.2d. at 1224 (vacating denial ofia
motion,to quash a. grand jury subpoena). Here, there:is:no such, deficiency :in the form of request:
nor, a challenge by ‘the recipient of ‘the ‘subpoena. Indeed, in. Chemical Bank, which cited.
Martindell, the: district court. opined, that had the Government. obtained judicial relicf fo issue an

such as documents ‘and depositions are not.likely to ‘include the kind of confidential business
information that Chemical. Bank describes as having the potential to give rise to “difficult
balancing.” See id. see also Jane Doe, Protective Order (“Prot. Order”) (Dkt. 1°77) (defining
“confidential” information. as, ‘in, Sum. and, substance, ‘medical, and psychological information,
personal identifying information, and information relating to sexual activity or sexual contact).
