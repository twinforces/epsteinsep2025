regarding how the defendant is alleged to have committed, the crimes charged in Counts One
through Four. .Sée Indictment 44 1-11. Indeed, “by providing Defendant with a ‘narrative. of the:
manner in. which Defendant is.alleged ‘to have committed ‘the charged..offenses, the Indictment
provides Defendant with more detail than, is strictly nceessary” under the governing law. United
States ¥..Kozel, No. 19 Ct. 460 (KMW), 2020 WL 47511498, at *2 (S:D.N-Y. Aug. 17,2020).
Although the defendant: complains that some: of the:terms used inthe speaking‘portions of
the Indictment are somehow vague, she cites no authority to suggest. that her difficulty’
comprehending basic language in portions of a charging instrument that do not speak to the
elements of the offense requires dismissal.** Counts One and Three, charging the defendant with
violations of 18 U.S.C § 371, “clearly contain[] the clements of the offense: charged, fairly inform[]
[her] of the charge[s] against [her], and enable[] [her] to plead an acquittal or conviction. in bar of
future prosecution. for the same offense.” United States v. Bunn, 154 'F. App’x 227, 229 (2d ‘Cir.
2005). Counts Two and Four, charging violations of 18 U.S.C §2422 and § 2243, respectively,

85 Alternatively, the defendant claims that the acts listed throughout, the Indictment do not:
constitute illegal behavior. In this:vein, the defendant makés specific reference to “grooming” as
conduct:that.is notillegal. (Def. Mot. 12 at 4). The defendant cites no authority for this argument,

which is contrary’ to Second Circuit ‘law. In particular, the Second Circuit has for many ycars
found grooming behavior. to be a:means to “persuade, induce, or entice” minors to engage in.illegal
‘sexual, activity. See, é.g:, United States \. Thompson, 896 F.3d 155, 173 (2d Cir: 2018) (“Our
precedent, however, supports applying a broad definition of enticement in, this context: ‘that.
definition would reasonably include Thompson’s: grooming’ of the::minor. victims to act ‘as he
desired with regard to many matters over the months before he made the video.”); United States v.

Dorvee, 616 F. 3d 1'74,. 180 (2d Cir. 201.0) (“We do ‘not belicve' that the district.court was clearly’
erroncous iin. finding, asa. matter of fact, that these images ‘were sent.as ‘part. of a, grooming process
to persuade the agént to cngage in. the type of séxual conduct depicted in. the images.” (internal
quotation :marks and citation. omitted)); Waited States-v. Brand, 467 F.3d 1.79, 203, (2d Cir. 2006)
(“Brand’ 's sexual advances and. grooming behavior provide: additional. evidence: in support of the:
jury’s finding that.Brand, attempted. to entice a,minor.”). In any event, whether grooming alone
constitutes.a.crime is immaterial:to'the instant motion, and it will be for the jury to decide, whether:
the évidence at trial, as. a whole, establishes the clements of the crime beyorid a reasonable doubt.
