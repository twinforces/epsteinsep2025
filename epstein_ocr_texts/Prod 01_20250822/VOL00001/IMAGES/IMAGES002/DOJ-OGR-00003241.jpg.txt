shoes ‘of the hovght process. in, 2006 and “07 “when 1 trafficking
prosecutions were fairly new, when . . . more so than. today; some
jurors may‘ have looked. at ‘this as prostitution and... [a] judge’s
tolerance ‘for victim shaming may have . . . caused:more hesitation
onthe part of victims. .....°°

Finally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution.offered more flexibilityin fashioning
a. Sentence, because. he believed prosecutors Would have difficulty persuading a federal district’
court:in the Southern District of Florida to approve a:federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence
that differed. from the otherwise applicable ‘federal sentencing guidelines range. 4

In. summarizing his, thinking at the time, Acosta'‘told OPR,

The way the matter came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing
cnough. It. didn’t provide for prison, time. It. didn’t provide for
registration, and then-you-had the‘restitution.issuc. There were legal.
issues .... There were witness, issucs. And... we-could go to trial

aiid’ We may or may‘not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at
a a pre- -indictment resolution, and at various points, the office. went
back and forth, between, a. federal ‘pre-indictment resolution, and a

state’ pre- -Indictment resolution,

Acosta 'told OPR that, in, the end, “there was, a preference, for deferring to the state”? because, in.
part, the facts of the Epstein. case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution.
rather than trafficking,. and a fedcral, prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta, explained.
that he did, not, view it as problematic to defer resolution of the casc to the state, although ‘as the
Epstcin,case ‘played out, the fedcral:‘role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because
the defense tried to get'the state to “circumvent and-undérmine” the outcome.

Attorney's Office: could have proceeded ‘against. Epstein: by w fay of-ar information, but:decided to go into the ‘grand.
jury. because the’ State Attorney's Office * ‘didn’t like the case” and wanted * ‘political cover” for declining the case! of
procecding on.a lesser charge.

@ Menchel told. OPR, however, that the federal jiidges ‘in West Palm, Beach Were ‘highly: regardéd. and, were
generally viewed.as “pro-prosecution.”

o Acosta’ said that; “dismissing a number of, counts and ‘then: doing.a [Rule 11, is not something that [South

Florida.tederal district] judges:tend todo? Othersubjects also:told OPR.that-the federal judges inthe Southern: District
of Florida: ‘were generally considered averse: te pleas that’bound them on, sentencing; commonly-referred.to, as “Rule
ib ‘1(¢);pleas*

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure: | L(¢)(1.)(G) allows the. parties to,agree on a specific sentence:as part of!
a plea agreement. The court is required to impose. that sentencezif the court accepts the plea agreement; ifthe court!
does not-accept the, agreed -upon plea and.sentencey the agreement ts void.. Villafafia told OPR, that Rule 1 1(¢) pleas
were: “uncommon” ‘in, the Southern, District of Florida; as the; * “judges do not like; to be told... . what sentenee to
impose.” Menchel similarly , told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges i in the, Southern, District of Florida. as
averse'to Rule | Ca) pleas, although Menchel,had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had:never‘offered
a Rule 1.1(¢) plea.in any‘of her cases-and had no experience with such pleas.
