this ‘point, Sloman left;on vacation, and. he informed Acosta and Villafafia, that.in. his absence
Lourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent: the ‘following work week’ at his new ‘post:
at ‘the. Department :in. Washington, D.C., but’ communicated ‘with his USAO colleagues byphone
and. cmail.

In.a Sunday, September 16, 2007 email, Villafana informed.Lefkowitz that she had drafted,
a, factual ‘proffer'to, accompany a, revised “hybrid” federal ‘plea:proposal. In that email, Villafaiia,
also. noted. that she ‘was ‘considering filing, charges. in. the ‘federal district court’ iti Miami, “which.
will hopefully cutthe press coverage significantly. * This.cmail reccived:considcrable-attention 12
years , later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and. was ‘viewed as evidence of'
the USAO’s efforts to conceal, the NPA. from the victims. Villafafia, however, explained to OPR.
that she was concerned that news media, coverage ‘would violate. the victims’ ‘privacy. She told.
OPR, “[I]f [the victims] ‘wanted to, attend [the plea hearing], I ‘wanted them to be able to, go. into
the courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity.
was.less likely to happen in. Miami, where thepress “in general. docs not care about what happens
in Palm Beach.”

Lefkowitz responded to Villafafia ‘with a revised ‘version of her’ latest. proposed, “hybrid”
plea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly; this defense proposal

immigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:

assistants] or any employee of [a-specific Epstein-owned, corporate
cntity] for-any criminal charge that arises. out of the ongoing federal
investigation .. . Further, no immigration | Broceoding, will be

The second new provision related to the USAO’s, cfforts to, obtain Epstcin’s' computers:

resolves any and all outstanding [lcegal’‘process] that have requested
‘witness testimony’ and/or the production. of documents and/or
computers in relation to the. investigation ‘that. is. the subjcet of the
Agreement. ach. [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the
execution of the Agreement and ‘will not be re-issued-absent reliable
