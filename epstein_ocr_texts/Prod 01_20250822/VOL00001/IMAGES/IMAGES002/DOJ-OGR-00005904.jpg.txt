Sexual, grooming of children ‘293

‘In. order to gain. access to their victim(s),, offenders. groom. the environment. and. their
potential victim’s significant others (e. g: parents, carers, teachers, ete). This may mean: the
offender integrating'themselves into; society: and places where’they are likely to meet children.
This will often be 4 position of trust. ‘Offenders then begin grooming the adults’ in this
community; specifically. ‘those who are. significant to, their potential victim, with the aim of
creating an. opportunity'‘to ‘access and ‘abuse a. child, or:children.. van Dam (200.1): reports! that,
offendérs are frequently charming, ‘very ‘helpful, and have:
important: factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help ;out in the
community; they:are considering: how. their: efforts’ will. bé rewarded. later: when. they can then

A desire! on the: part of parents to avoid cognitive: dissonance ‘may. assist offenders’

When thoughts :do'‘not match behaviour, ‘cognitive dissonance: manifests, and. often thoughts
are changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam,. 200 1). Thus, offenders. gain insider
status long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam,,.2001). Grooming is therefore a well-
organized lonig‘term.activity (Sanford, 1982). ‘Offenders groom. the community so well that if

‘because they deem tthe offender, to. be: more believable ‘than. the child.

‘Intrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non= abusing parent, siblings
and ‘the: outside world by, developing an exclusive relationship with the child..For instance,
