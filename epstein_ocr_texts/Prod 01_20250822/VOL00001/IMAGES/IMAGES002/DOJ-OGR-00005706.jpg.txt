Id. at 24 (citing United States v. Halper, 590 F.2d 422, 430 (2d Cir. 1978). The Court did not
believe that a limiting instruction would be adequate to mitigate the risk of prejudice to Ms.
Maxwell. /d.

The Court further found that any consideration of the perjury charges would likely
require disqualification of at least one of her attorneys in the criminal case, two of whom had
represented her at the civil depositions, which would significantly prejudice Ms. Maxwell.

Importantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of

at least one of Maxwell’s attorneys from participating as an

advocate on her behalf..... Maxwell’s counsel in the civil action

and the deposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury

counts. Even if counsel were not required to testify, trying all

counts together could force Maxwell to choose between having her

counsel testify on her behalf on the perjury charges and having

them assist her in defending the Mann Act charges....

Disqualification of counsel also implicates Maxwell’s Sixth

Amendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice.

The prejudice to Maxwell is especially pronounced because the

attorneys who represented her in the civil case have worked with

her for years and are particularly familiar with the facts

surrounding the criminal prosecution.
Id. at 24-25 (internal citations omitted). Finally, the Court noted that much of the proof relevant
to the perjury counts was beyond the scope of the “narrower issues” presented by the other
charges, that the perjury counts involved legal and factual questions were “unlikely to bear on
the other charges,” and that addressing the perjury counts would involve a “significant
investment of time and resources” that would impair the efficiency of the trial. /d. at 25-26. For
these reasons, the Court found that Ms. Maxwell had shown “significant unfairness” that
outweighed the burden of conducting separate trials and severed the perjury counts. /d. at 23, 26.

Accordingly, the government will not be allowed to introduce at trial evidence of any
alleged false deposition statements by Ms. Maxwell as evidence of the perjury counts. The
superseding indictment, however, attempts to link the purportedly false statements to the other
