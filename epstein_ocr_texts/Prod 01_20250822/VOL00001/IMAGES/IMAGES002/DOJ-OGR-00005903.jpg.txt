sexual grooming, i.¢. after a. sexual, offence has been committed, is much easiér ‘than
prospective identification, ize: before: a. sexual offence. Nevertheless, the ‘latter is necessary in
order to prevent the sexual.:abuse from, taking: place. The reason for ‘this ‘is because the
‘behaviours ‘used ‘to groom a ‘child ‘for ‘sexual abuse :are not dissimilar to. innocent. behaviour

underlying the behaviour.

Self-groonung:

van Dam (2001) reports that during treatment; offenders’ talk about “grooming themselves”:
They. were referring to the justification or denial. of their offending behaviour. It therefore
séems important to’ consider this ‘as part. of the. grooming process. However}, it'may be more
agreeable to refer wo. this phenomenon by another name, avoiding the use of ‘the: teem
“grooming”: Nevertheless, self-grooming: is likely to playa part in ‘the. move: from being
motivated, to sexually abuse ‘a child to the subsequent targeting of a child, through the
justification ,or denial ‘of :the steps: child sexual offenders ‘take towards abusing. a. child.

the child, and the success or failure of the efforts to victimize the child. “Success” is likely-to
result in:further justification;or denial oftheir actions:and more ;entrenched, sexual-interest in
children.‘and ‘motivation to offend. “Failure”,.'on the other hand, is likely ‘to result in, :the
desistence. of offending or the offender developing/enahancing. his skills/strategies to ensuré

Justification and ‘denial of offenders” behaviour manifests, in cognitive distortions: Ward
and Keenan (1999) propose: that child. sex offenders have cognitive distortions in the form of
implicit theories, ‘which. relate to. themselves, the victinY and ‘the’ world. Implicit theories-help
individuals to Understand the world. around them. Problems ‘arise because offenders’ amplicit.
theories are maladapti ive. and. supportive of. sex with: children. These. amplicit. theories
subsequently ‘affect: encoding and, interpretation jof future behaviours and, events. Ward, and
Keenan havetidentitied five implicit theories’ that:account for most of-the: cognitive distortions
held by child sex: offenders: children. as sexual objects; entitlement; dangerous’ world;
uncontrollabilitys and, ature of harm,

Of course, jit 1s; not. only offenders who have ‘maladaptive; implicit; theories: For example,
many. people have an implicit theory, that children are at most risk from ‘strangers; which is not
consisténtiwith research findings. However, it is easi¢r'to believe that strangers ‘sexually: abuse
children, thant -acéepe that fri¢nds and family’ do; ‘he h he
people from the ‘harsh nature: of reality. Offenders’ implicit theories work in a. similar way,
‘because it isscasier:for offenders to believe that the child:seduced them than to‘accept.that they’
sexually ‘abused. a child.

Grooming ‘the environment and significant'others

Grooming t the child begins with identifying a vulnerable child (van Dam, 200 1). Child Sex

These vulnerabilities: may be that the. children have-a a‘poor. sr relationship with their parents, ‘do
not have: many friends (Berliner & Conte; 1990); or have ‘already been victimized (Leberg,
1997). Alternatively, offenders may: target women who ‘were. séxually abused ‘as children,
