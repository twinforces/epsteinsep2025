which Villafafia and Louric believed that the state: had intentionally failed:to aggressively pursue
‘a, broader state indictment:

One cxample:illustrates this communication gap. In a:September.20, 2007 cmail to -Louric
asking him.to read.the: latest: version. of the proposed, “‘hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for
Epstcin, to: plead to beth, state: and federal, charges), Acosta. noted, “I don’t. typically sign, ‘plea.
agreements. We. should only go forward. if'the trial team supports: and signs, this agreement: |
didn’t: even sign the ‘public corruption. or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not:be the first.”
(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie attached Acosta’s, email and instructed
Villafatia to. “change the: signature block to your name and send as final to Jay: Uectkowitz)”
he wanted to give the “trial. t team” a chance to‘ “speak up and ict him know” if they ‘did not ‘feel
comfortable with the agreement. ‘Villafafia, however, told OPR. that. she did not ‘understand ‘that:
shé was being: given af opportunity to obj cct'to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted,
her to sign it because he was taking an “arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his
deal.” The:fact that the top decision :maker believed he was giving the line: AUSA an. opportunity
to'reflect and. stop the process. if she belicved the deal was ‘inappropriate, but the line AUSA.
believed she was being ordered.to sign the, agreement. because:her boss. wanted to distance himsclf
from the decision, reflécts a serious Communication gap.

being:made concerning: a: possible: resolution, requested. a: meeting y with, Acosta; ina sternly: worded.
rebuke, Menchel rejected the request: Although: ‘Menchel told, OPR, that he was not prohibiting:
Villafaria from speaking to Acosta, Villafana interpreted. Menchel’s email to nican that she could,
not seck, a mecting, with Acosta. As. a consequence, Acosta made his decision, about a.state
resolution and the term of incarccration'without any dircct: ‘input from Villafafia. Acosta:told OPR.
that ‘he ‘was unaware that Villafafia had sought a. meeting with, him and ‘he would. have met. with.
her if she had asked him, direetly. OPR. did not, find. any. written cvidence of a mecting involving
both.Acosta=the final decision maker—=and. Villafafia—the:person‘most knowledgeable about-the
facts and the law—before Acosta madé his decision to resolvé'the casé through state charges or to
offer the two- -year'term, and. Villafafia-said she did not have any.input into the decision. Although.
a. U.S. Attorney is certainly: not required to have such.‘direct input, and.it may be ‘that: Menchel
presented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that, Acosta was aware
of Villafafia’s ‘strong views.about, and objections: to, the proposed resolution.**°

Two logistical problems: hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers
involved. in. the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the:
offices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, toa. lesser extent,
Louric=were located in West.Palm Beach. Consequently; Villafafia’ 5 discussions with her senior

286 In her 2017 Declaration in the; CVRA ‘litigation, Villafafia. stated, that, given the: challenges, of ‘obtaining
victims’ cooperation. with a federal prosecution, “Ubelieved.and still belicve'that anegotiated.resolution‘of the matter’
wasn ‘the best interests. of ‘the [USAO] and the vietims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same
conclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafana i in fact supported the: NPA. In-her
OPR interview, how ever, Villafaia drew a distinction between resolving the iny estigation through negotiations that:
led: to what i in her view was a reasonable outcome; which she would have supported,and “this negotiated resolution’ —
that:is, the NPA—which she did not support.
