of turning over their discovery to the government in order to coerce a settlement”). The parties
also settled just a short time before trial; such a settlement could have been occasioned, at least in )
part, to avoid the public disclosure of any confidential materials. |
However, the only thing on which Maxwell or anyone else might reasonably have relied |
is that Giuffre or her lawyers would not do what the defendant in Chemical Bank did—that is, |
forward discovery materials in their possession to prosecutors for the purpose of fomenting an |
investigation. But I am not faced with that situation. Nothing in this record suggests to me that :
Giuffre or Boies Schiller had anything to do with the Government’s decision to convene a grand |
jury to look into the matters that were the subject of the Giuffre Action. On the contrary—the |
Government has advised the Court that it contacted Boies Schiller as part of its search for parties |
who might have been victims in its investigation; and that Boies Schiller told the Government |
that it could not consensually produce at least some documents in its files because of the |
existence of the Protective Order. There is no evidence of “collusion,” to invoke a term of the |
moment, and it is quite clear that Boies Schiller did not foment the Government’s investigation. |
Moreover, the Assistant United States Attorney has represented to this Court that he has no idea |
what is in Boies Schiller’s files, and that for all he knows every witness who was deposed stood |
on his/her Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions. |
The literal terms of the Protective Order permit the court to authorize the release of |
:
Confidential Materials by parties to the Order “for good cause shown.” (Protective Order, {[ 14.) :
Any party who read the order had to be aware that it contained no promise that Confidential |
Materials would forever be withheld from a prosecuting agency—especially where, as here, a |
duly empowered grand jury seeks their production.
