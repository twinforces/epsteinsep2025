is indisputable that, in Constand’s civil case, Cosby was entitled to invoke the Fifth
Amendment. No court could have forced Cosby to: testify ina deposition or at a trial so:
long as: the potential for criminal charges remained. Here, however, when called ‘for
deposition, Cosby no: longer faced criminal charges. When compelled ‘to testify, Cosby
no longer had a right to invoke his right to remain silent:

rather that Cosby simply chose not to invoke it.

The trial court’s conjecture was legally erroneous. The trial court surmised that,
although Cosby repeatedly told an exculpatory, consent-based version of the January

2004 incident, he naturally would have been willing to offer inculpatory information about
