told Tyson to stop, and he complied. But, when she fell asleep a second time, he resumed
the uninvited sexual contact. Tyson was arrested and charged with sex-related offenses.
Id.

Before trial, the Commonwealth sought to introduce evidence of a rape for which
Tyson had been convicted in Delaware twelve years earlier. /d. The Delaware offense
involved a victim of the same race and of a similar age as the victim in Tyson. Id. The
Delaware victim similarly was casually acquainted with Tyson, invited Tyson into her
home, was in a compromised state, and awoke to find Tyson engaged in vaginal
intercourse with her. /d. at 357. The trial court declined to admit the Rule 404(b) evidence
against Tyson. /d. at 356. On interlocutory appeal, the Superior Court reversed the trial
court’s decision, finding that the proffered evidence was admissible. /d. at 363. The court

President Judge Emeritus Bender and Judge Ott, opining that the majority
“overemphasize[d] the few similarities that exist between Tyson’s prior rape conviction
and the present matter while completely dismissing the several important differences
between the two incidents.” Tyson, 119 A.3d at 363 (Donohue, J., dissenting). The
dissent further disputed the en banc majority’s reliance upon the need for the prior bad
acts evidence “to bolster the credibility of the Commonwealth’s only witness where there
is no indication that the witness is otherwise impeachable.” /d. at 364.
