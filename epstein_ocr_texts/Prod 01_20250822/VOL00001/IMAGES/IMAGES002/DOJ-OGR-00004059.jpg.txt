The MDC routinely places inmates in the SHU if they have engaged in physical
altercation with other inmates or to protect inmates who are the subject of abuse. It would be
ironic if the MDC follows through with its threat to place Ms. Maxwell in the SHU: It would
signal that Ms. Maxwell needs protection from the very staff so intent on protecting her, since
she has no contact with anyone but staff.
As suggested by the Circuit, we ask the Court to address Ms. Maxwell’s sleeping
conditions by directing the MDC to cease 15-minute light surveillance of Ms. Maxwell or
justify the need for the disruptive flashlight surveillance.
Very truly yours,
