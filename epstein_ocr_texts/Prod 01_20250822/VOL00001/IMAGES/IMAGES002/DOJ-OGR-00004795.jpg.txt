protective order. Jd. And, if confidential materials tum out to be relevant, to a.court’s ruling,
Second Circuit precedent creates a. strong presumption that they will be made ‘public
notwithstanding any protective order. See Lugosch, 435,F.3d at.126. These are not. remote: or
theoretical possibilitics. Each. ofthem,predictably came, to pass in this case. See Brown, 929
F.3d at 48 & n.22; Ginffre, 827 F. App’x at 145. Itis “unrealistic” to beliéve that deposition
testimony'central to a.civil case of high public interest will remain, effectively sealed indcfinitely.
Andover, 876 F 2d at 1083.

Maxwell. claims:that she did not cxpect.the: Government.to be able to obtain. her
deposition. testimony, and that if she knew it-would, she never would, have testified. If Maxwell.
subjectively harbored this belief, it was noncthcless unreasonable. Sc@ Smith, 442: U.S. at.743.
The Court further notes'that.Maxwell was ably represented by a number. of attorneys ‘during the
civil, litigation, who the Court is. confident were :familiar with.the’preeedents governing’ protective

Because Maxwell had no:reasonable expectation of privacy in, documents shared with
third:partics, during the civil case, the Government. did not: engage’ in a scarch when it obtained
those documents: from:a:third party: by subpoena... Maxwell:also makes.a half-hearted.argument
that obtaining those documents was a ‘seizure of her personal property. Copies of documents
held. by. a law firm that-represented Maxwell’s adversary in a civil cas¢ were not Maxwell’s
personal property. Thus, the Government.cngaged in neither a.scarch nor a scizure, and. so it did
not violate Maxwell’s. Fourth Amendment right against unreasonable scarches and. seizures.

The Government also contends'that-cven if it improperly’obtained documents pursuant to
the grand jury subpoena, the Court should not:suppress those documents because the

Government acted in good faith and. would have obtained the documents anyway. See:.Nix Vv.
