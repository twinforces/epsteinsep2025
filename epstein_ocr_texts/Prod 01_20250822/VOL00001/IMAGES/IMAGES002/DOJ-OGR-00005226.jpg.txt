Re: Deadline for Filing Motion under Federal Rule of Evidenée 412,
United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20.Cr..330 (AIN)

Dear Judge Nathan,

I’write to:confirm that November :15, 202.1 is the deadline. for Ms. Maxwell'to file. a
motion-under Federal‘Rule of Evidence.412, which governs the admissibility of evidence of an
alleged. vietim’s sexual behavior.

Under this Court’s pretrial. scheduling order, motions in limine:are duc on October 18..A
motion. in limine ‘is a.“pretrial. request that-certain inadmissible evidence not.be referred to or
offered at trial.” Black’s Law Dictionary'(11th ed. 2019).

A motion under. Rule 4112 is not a motion in.liminc. Rathcr, it:is.a motion sccking
permission to admiticvidenee the ‘Rules of Evidence might otherwise exclude. Jt is a, substantive
motion ‘under a. specific rule. of. évidencé with specific procedures for its filing, consideration, and
determination. Fed.'R. Evid. 41.2(c). And-the Rule itself sets a.deadline for filing a.motion under
its terms=14 days before trial. Fed. R. Evid. 412(¢)(1)(B) (providing'that.a defendant must file

her motion “at least ‘14 days before trial unless the court, for good cause, scts a different.time”).
