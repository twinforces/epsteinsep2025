quickly approved, he reported to Menchel that ‘the’ FBI was, | “not happy” about the delay, adding,
“T did not even tell them] think: we should bring [Epstein] in, once we decide to charge him, and
offer apre-indictment deal, figuring.a judge:might:never agree.to'sueh.a-deal post indictment. ‘That,
would.have sent'them thru the roof.” Lourie explaincd: to OPR.that he thought-a judge, after secing
an, indictment charging the: full nature: and. scope of, Epstein’ S conduct, might: not agree to a plea.
‘involving substantially less time or to dismiss substantive charges."

Lourié told,OPR that despite Oosterbaan’s favorable opinion ofthe case, “[t]his was... ..a
bit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that.were unlike the case law ‘Oosterbaan had. cited.
Although Lourie: had some concerns about ‘the legal i issues and about'the witnesses, he ‘ ‘probably”
did. not, sce any impediment to going forward with the case; in fact, Louric “was not.in favor of
walking away; which is what. the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought.
we could, have ‘won. and we could, have ‘prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the odds were
nearly‘as good. as. you want:in a criminal case, and . . . the things that’ ‘we had to gain. [through a.
plea agreement] were much :more than. [in] a. normal ‘criminal case,” in. which the: only cost: ofa
loss ‘would.be that the defendant did not. go to jail. Lourie told OPR. that. to the best of his
recollection, he: thought a. plea agreement would, be a good. result, and although ‘the: government.
might have to “give up.some jail time,” there were other benefits to. plea, such. as the ability to
require Epstein. to, register as a scx offender and the availability of monctary damages. for the
victims. Lourie recalled “thinking that this case should. scttle: and. we: should sct:it up so we can.
settle it” by; for example, charging Epstein by complaint. and. then negotiating a plea to.limited.
charges in‘a,criminal information. Villafania told OPR that she agreed with, Louric that a criminal
complaint.charging an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all of the information related to what-the
case was about” would be a good way to “get.things moving” toward. a pre-indictment plea.

Although Lourie and Villafafia, belicved a pre- -indictment plea agreement was a desired.
resolution, there was no guarantee that Epstcin'would agrec'to plead guilty, and.they continued fo
‘work: together’ to. shape an ‘indictment. ‘On.May' 10, 2007, Louric cmailed Villafafia:

[MJaric

I believe that Epstein? s att{orneys] arc scared. of the victims they
don’t.know. Epstein has no doubt told.them that. there were many:
Thus, 1 believe the f[ir]st indictment should:contain only the victims
they have fiothing on at all. We can add.in the other ones ‘that: have
myspace [sic] pages and prior testimony in a. [superseding
indictment]. I think: for the first strike: we should. make all their
nightmare[]s come true. Thoughts?”

+ Lourie explained, to OPR that the government's dismissal, of counts :in:an; indictment: required ‘the court?s

approval, and that, while “it’s:rare,” it was possible: that a-judges seeing:the nature-and extent:of Epstein’s conduct as
setiforth: in an-extensive indictment, might: not-allow-substantive counts to’be dismissed,

and Lourie’s references'to MySpace pages and. “‘prior testimony” referred to the impeachment. information

‘brought forward’by defense counsel.
