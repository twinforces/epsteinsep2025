for him, as U.S. Attorney, to attend witness interviews, and further, that no one in the USAO “was
questioning the pain or the suffering of the victims.” Sloman told OPR that he himself had “never
gone to a line assistant’s victim or witness interview.”

Villafafia told OPR that although three of the victims interviewed during this period had
been notified by the FBI in October 2007 about the resolution of the case, at this point Villafafia
did not specifically tell these victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had
these terms.” Villafafia also told OPR she “didn’t talk about money” because she “didn’t want
there to be an allegation at the time of trial . . . that [the victims] were either exaggerating their
claims or completely making up claims in order to increase their damages amount.” Rather,
according to Villafafia, she told the three victims that “an agreement had been reached where
[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look like he intends to actually
perform . . . [and] now it looks like this may have to be charged, and may have to go to trial.”
Villafafia recalled “explaining that the case was under investigation,” that they “were preparing
the case [for charging] again,” and “expressing our hope that charges would be brought.” Villafafia
recalled one victim “making a comment about the amount of [imprisonment] time and why was it
so low” and Villafafia answered, “that was the agreement that the office had reached.”**?

With regard to the victims Villafafia interviewed who had not received an FBI notification
in October 2007, Villafafia recalled discussing one victim’s safety concerns but not whether they
discussed the agreement. She recalled telling another victim that “we thought we had reached an
agreement with [Epstein] and then we didn’t,” but was “pretty sure” that she did not mention the
agreement during the interview of the third victim. Villafafia explained that she likely did not
discuss the agreement because

at that point I just felt . . . like it was nonexistent. [The victim] didn’t
know anything about it beforehand, and as far as I could tell it was
going to end up being thrown on the heap, and I didn’t want to --...
if you tell people, oh, look, he’s already admitted that he’s guilty,
like, I didn’t want that to color her statement. I just wanted to get
the facts of the case.

The CEOS Trial Attorney told OPR that she did not recall any discussion with the victims
about the NPA or the status of the case.*4° She did remember explaining the significance of the
prosecution to one victim who “did not think anything should happen” to Epstein. The FBI case
agent told OPR that she did not recall the January 2008 interviews. OPR located notes to an FBI
interview report, stating that one of the victims wanted another victim to be prosecuted. Attorneys
for the two victims other than Wild who had been notified by the FBI in October 2007 about the
resolution of the case informed OPR that as of 2020, their clients had no memory of meeting with
authored concerning one of the two victims that contained no information regarding a discussion of the status of the
investigation or the resolution of the case. Through her attorney, this victim told OPR that she did not recall having
contact with anyone from the USAO.
aa? Villafaiia did not recall any other specific questions from victims.

380 The CEOS Trial Attorney noted that CEOS did not issue victim notifications; rather, such notifications were
generally handled by a Victim Witness Specialist in the assigned USAO.
