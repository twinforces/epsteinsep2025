pimp to arrange sex:acts for third parties. See, ¢:g., Kidd, 385. F. Supp. 3d at 263; Oct. 17,.2019
Tr. at 2771-12, Waited. States ¥. Diipigny, No. 18 Cr..528 (JME) (S.D.N.Y.); Dkt. No. 198. Second,
in-any event, the: Government did:not provide :expert-notice on “grooming by proxy.” ‘Dr. Rocchio
will give.an opinion, on grooming, and, she will discuss how “[t]he ‘presence of other individuals
can ‘facilitate the sexual, abuse of minors.” (Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3. Ex. | at 2). The ‘former is
a.rcliable opinion, as explained.above, and the defendant does not ‘challenge the reliability of the:
latter opinion. (See Def: Mot. 3.,at-14). Third, trial, testimony will show. that. the defendant (1) in.
fact participated in-scxual abuse of minors, (2) facilitated that abuse through her presence, and.(3)

conspired with, a predator who groomed. and ‘sexually abused. minors. None of that involves

“srooming by:proxy.”

Finally,’Dr. Rocchio will offer the opinion that “nondisclosure, incremental disclosure, and.
secrecy.are common among ‘victims of sexual abuse for a varicty of:reasons, and that. memory and
disclosure of ‘traumatic or abusive events :is ‘impacted by a number of factors, including the
circumstances surrounding the trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex..1 at.2).

Much of the: basis ‘for this opinion is set forth in. Dr. Rocchio’s Jencks Act material. For
instance, extensive psychological. literature supports the: idea that individuals who are harmed.as
children may come to disclose, their experiences. incrementally or not-until much_later, as they may
only realize'that their experiences’ were abusive.later in life, among:other:reasoris. Sclected articles
fronrthat'literature are attached.as Exhibit B. See Alaggia ct al., “Facilitators and:Barriers to Child.
Sexual, Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A. Research Update (2000-2016), 20 ‘Trauma, Violence &
Abuse. 260, 276 (2016) (“Disclosure is now generally accepted as a complex and lifelong process,
