Sean to call AK-back and lct-her know:if the Florida agents had.concerns. Sean never

ealled AK. back. AK. docsn’tirecall ever affirmatively ‘following up with Scaii, but’ she

took the radio silence to, mean that the FBI agents in-Florida did not express

dissatisfaction.

No investigation was, opened as a.result of the; February 29, 2016 mecting.

No investigation:into Epstein was opened while AK was the Human Trafficking
‘Coordinator and, Project Safe: Childhood coordinator.

AK never'met with any other Boies Schiller attorneys. AK docs not recall everspeaking.
with David Boics.at any point:
AK never'met ‘with the attorneys from. the February 29, 2016 'mceting again.

When asked what, if any, communications AK had ‘with the attorneys, .AK notéd ‘that. she
sees an email from May 2016 with Stan Pottenger. AK. believes, it’s possible Stan called.
AK, but she does not:remember that.

the Miami Herald series was published.

AK confirmed she has read:the. Daily News Article LP sent.

AK indicated, that the:article did not accurately describe AK’s interactions with attorneys
for Virginia. Roberts.

AK’s:recollection. is not that attorneys urged SDNY to open an investigation into “the

duo.” They were ‘focused on Epstein. Maxwell was mentioned. in passing, not.as a. target.

AK didnot participate in-a second mecting with anyone. Had there been a:mceting on
this subject in’the summer of 2016:in SDNY, AK would. have known. about it in her

capacity as’ Human, Trafficking Coordinator.

o AK.,had been in that role:since approximately 201.0, and. if somcone came in to
mect with.a unit chicf about a potential .human trafficking matter, AK‘would get
contacted about the meeting. AK met’with chiefs to gathcr:information. about any’
cases they had that: touched on human:trafficking so that.AK could.coordinate. So
if a second meeting had taken place with a supervisor in the officc, AK;would.
have known about it. Dan Stcin also would have brought AK in:if he learned of'a
second mecting.

© AK would have made a. record if'there had ever’been a sccond mecting. AK.
would remember if'there were a second meeting. She has,no record.and no
memory: of:any second meeting.

AK does not:recall everspeaking with. or.mecting David Boies in her life, so to her
knowledge,, Boics: was not making any:effort to persuade SDNY ‘to investigate Epstein.

AK noted.it.is possible Boics could have been on the phone if Stan Pottinger called AK.

‘In, or:around:May of 2016, but.AK has no recollection of such.a call.

AK does not:recall the attorney ‘presentation being framicd on highlighting Maxwell’s

assistance, with, Epstein’s:scxual abuse. It was‘not presented, as.a, “duo.” AK reealls the.
mention.of a:pilot:and the mention,of someone having’ an address book, so other people:
‘were mentioned as part of telling the story of Epstein.
