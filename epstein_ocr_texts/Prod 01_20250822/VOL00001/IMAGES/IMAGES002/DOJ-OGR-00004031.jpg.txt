Good afternoon Bobbi:

It'had'been brought to my-attention bythe staff.of MDC:Brooklyn that Ms. Maxwell received paperwork:that'was not in her possession
upon entering the legal visiting area. ‘As you are aware; the policies setforth for MDC Brooklyn legal visits:do notallow for passing of
any material during:a legal visit. Due.to our policy and procedures; the additional documents:that were provided to Ms:. Maxwell were
confiscated; ‘Those materials were-putiin an‘envelope.and' will be.returned to you:tomorrow upon your arrival.to the institution; Please
note; that.you may put:these documents inthe legal mail box‘in-the lobby-of the eastibuilding:

Thankyou for understanding:

Best:
Sophia
