‘conspiracies (Counts One and. Three) to 2004, based entirely on,Accuser-4’s allegations, But.
these. offenses are the exucl same: offenses that were-the subject of the Elorida Investigation and
resolved bythe NPA, which:covers “any potential. co-conspirators of Epstein,” including: Ms.
Maxwell.

The Court ruled. tintequivocally'that the NPA covers “any involvement of [Ms.] Maxwell
in. offenses committed by Epstein. from 2001. to.2007, other offenses that were'the subject of the
FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office investigation, and, any offenses that-arose from the related, grand.
jury investigation.” (Dkt. 207 at 7). Yet’ Counts Five and ‘Six fall squarely within all three
categories of offenses for which the NPA immunizes Ms. Maxwell:

2 Theallegations of Accuser-4 fall within the 2001-2007 timeframe and:the new
counts charge violations of 18 U.S.C. § 1591, a. statute ‘specifically:

enumerated in'the NPA.

e The Palm, Beach FBI and the USAO-SDFL thoroughly ‘investigated Accuser-
4’s allegations as part of the Florida, Investigation.

° Accuser-4’s allegations were presented, to the grand. jury ‘in. that..District.and
formed. the basis ‘for ‘a. conspiracy charge. and ‘a. sex, ‘trafficking charge in a
proposed 60-count; federal, indictment. of Epstein that was dropped. pursuant to
the terms of the NPA.

Because Counts Five and Six are based on the exuct same evidence investigated. and presented to
the SDFL grand jury in 2008, and are the exact’ same crimes included in,the proposed SDFL
indictment, against Epstein later abandoried pursuant.to, the NPA, the government cannot.now
charge Ms. Maxwell with these offenses.

Further, the NPA. binds the United States Attorney’s Office forthe Southern District of

New York (“USAQ-SDNY”) as to the newly-indicted counts. We understand that the Court
previously ruled-that-under United States v. Annabi,'771 F.2d 670 (2d Cir: 1985) and its progeny,

the language and drafting history‘of the NPA does riot “affirmatively appear” to bind this, District
