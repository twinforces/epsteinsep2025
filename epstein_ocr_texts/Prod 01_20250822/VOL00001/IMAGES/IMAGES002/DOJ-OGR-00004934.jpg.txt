and that such an.order. should not be vacated or:modified merely to accommodate the
Goverfimenrit’s desire to inspect protected testimony for possible use in.a criminal
investigation[,]” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296.

Since: Martindell, “It'is well-settled [in this Circuit] . ... that a Rule 26(c) protective. order’
may be overtuiied or: modified [only] based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary
circumstances or compelling. need.” Andover Data:Servs., a Div. of Players Computer, Inc. 'v.
Statistical Tabulating Corp.; 876 F:2d 1080, 1083 (2d.Cir. 1989). Moreover, the: Second Circuit.
has‘held that Martindell applies to the Government, as well as to any other third party seeking to
modify.a protective order. TheStreet:Com, 273.F.3d at 229 0.7.

grand jury subpoena,’ Davis, 702 F.2d at 422.” (See Gov’t Letter. Br. at 3-4.) However, the
statement ftom Davis’ that, is quoted above concerned. the testimony of a.non-party appellant
whose testimony was shot subject to.a Rule 26(c) protective order, but rather to:an informal
“understanding of confidentiality” that was never reduced to writing. Davis, 702 F.2d at 422.
The opinion underscored ‘that'the parties” unwritten understanding about the confidentiality of
this deponent’s testimony would.not trump a formal gratid jury subpoena. That discussion is.
irrelevant to the question of whether this Court is required to apply the Martindell rulé:in

evaluating this application.
