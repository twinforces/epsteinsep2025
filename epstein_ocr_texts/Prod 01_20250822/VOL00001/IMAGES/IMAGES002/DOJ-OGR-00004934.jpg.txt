and that such an order should not be vacated or modified merely to accommodate the |
Government’s desire to inspect protected testimony for possible use in a criminal |
investigation[.]” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296.
Since Martindell, “It is well-settled [in this Circuit] .. . that a Rule 26(c) protective order |

may be overturned or modified [only] based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary |
circumstances or compelling need.” Andover Data Servs., a Div. of Players Computer, Inc. v. |
Statistical Tabulating Corp., 876 F.2d 1080, 1083 (2d Cir. 1989). Moreover, the Second Circuit |
has held that Martindell applies to the Government, as well as to any other third party seeking to |
modify a protective order. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d at 229 n.7. |
The Government argues that Martindell should not apply to the instant application, for |

three reasons. (Gov’t Letter Br. at 3-5.) |
First, it argues that the rule of Martindell is inapplicable because here the grand jury |

issued a valid and proper subpoena to Boies Schiller, while in Martindell the Government “‘was |
proceeding outside of its usual investigative powers to secure the requested testimony, not by |
grand jury subpoena,’ Davis, 702 F.2d at 422.” (See Gov’t Letter Br. at 3-4.) However, the |
statement from Davis that is quoted above concerned the testimony of a non-party appellant |
whose testimony was not subject to a Rule 26(c) protective order, but rather to an informal )
“understanding of confidentiality” that was never reduced to writing. Davis, 702 F.2d at 422. |
The opinion underscored that the parties’ unwritten understanding about the confidentiality of
this deponent’s testimony would not trump a formal grand jury subpoena. That discussion is |
irrelevant to the question of whether this Court is required to apply the Martindell rule in |
evaluating this application. |
