and "good faith” of the New York investigation leading to the charges against her. Kyles, 514
USS. at 445,

It is clear from the documents produced by the government that the NPA was the reason
why the New York Investigation was opened in late 2018. Ona telephone call with the
prosecutors on February 11, 2021, former AUSA gg confirmed that she met with
attorneys for some of Epstein’s accusers on February 29, 2016, when she was the Project Safe
Childhood Coordinator at the USAO-SDNY, but ultimately did not open an investigation at that
time. See Ex. G at SDNY _GM_02742887-91. In late November 2018, however, Julie K. Brown
published a series of articles in the Miami Herald entitled “Perversion of Justice,” which were
sharply critical of the NPA and the perceived leniency that Epstein received to resolve the
Florida Investigation. JJ confirmed that she read the Miami Herald articles when they
came out and “‘was very disturbed to read about how the case was resolved in SDFL, which was
inconsistent with [her] assumptions when the case was presented by the attorneys in February
2016.” Jd. at SDNY_GM_02742892. [MN further stated that soon afterwards, she spoke
to prosecutors in the Public Corruption Unit, including some of the prosecutors on this case, and
discussed the Miami Herald articles and her February 29, 2016 meeting with the attorneys. See
id. Shortly after that, the New York Investigation was opened.

It is also clear from the documents produced by the government, that the government
initially focused its investigation on Epstein and did not begin to investigate Ms. Maxwell until
after Epstein died on August 10, 2019, roughly one month after he was arrested. To give just
one example, the New York FBI did not speak to a single one of the four accusers in this case
until after Epstein’s death. [nn
