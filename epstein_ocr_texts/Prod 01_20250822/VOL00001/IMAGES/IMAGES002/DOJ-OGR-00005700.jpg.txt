Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 388 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page13o0f14
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should exclude evidence of Ms. Maxwell’s supposed
“flight” following the arrest of Jeffrey Epstein and preclude the government from arguing that
Ms. Maxwell was hiding from or evading law enforcement authorities prior to, or at the time of,
her arrest, or that her conduct during this time period is proof of consciousness of guilt.
