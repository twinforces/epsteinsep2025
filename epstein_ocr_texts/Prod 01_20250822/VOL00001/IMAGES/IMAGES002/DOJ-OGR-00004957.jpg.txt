lawyers was making outrageously false statements to the press.” The prosecution,
responded: “Spencer Kuvin does not represent any of the witnesses the Government
expects to call at trial. in this case. Because this individual does not: represent any
witnesses in this 'case,” the local:rules did not apply to him and. there. was :no “need to
raise this ‘issue: with the Court.”

II. Even if the local ‘rules somehow applied to undersigned counsel, ‘the
Op-Ed did:not violate the local rule.

Even.if the local:rule applies'to.a lawyer who does: not currently:represent.a party:
or a witness and has. never appeared in the ‘trial court, the opinion piece here did not
violate the rule.

First, there is no risk of danger or prejudice to the upcoming trial because the
Op-Ed yaised the samie argument —'that the Cosby decision. applied to:'Ms. Maxwell’s
case — that was filed in public pleadings that were quoted. by the press. No confidential.
information was disclosed.?: Ms. Maxwell’s trial lawyers made the very same argument.
in a public pleading that was quoted by the press. (Dkt. No. 810). In that public
pleading, Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers argue:

The Penrisylvania, Supreme Court held that: DA. Castor’s promise was
enforceable.and that DA Ferman’s prosecution of Mr. Cosby ten years later
on the same charges violated his Due Process rights. (Id. at 78-79). As a
result, the Court vacated Mr. Cosby’s conviction. (Id. at 79). In so holding,
the Court: noted the following:

Intéractions between. a prosecutor ard a criminal deféndant,
including circumstances where the latter seeks enforcement of ‘some
promise or assurance made by the former, are not immune from the
dictates of due process and fundamental fairness.

(Id. at 55).

The same principle applies to Ms. Maxwell’s case. As in Cosby, the
government is trying to renege on its agreement. and prosecute Ms.
‘Maxwell over 25 years later for the exact same offenses for which she
‘was granted immunity in the NPA. Indeed, the principle applies even
more strongly in Ms. Maxwell’s case because the NPA was a formal.
