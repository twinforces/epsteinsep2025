Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 11 of 34

To the extent, that the categorical approach is ever appropriate in other contexts, it is
inappropriate here.

The Court begins with.the: statute’s text. Statutes that.call for application of the
categorical approach, typically deal with'the clements of an offense. in‘a;prior:criminal, conviction.
Id. at'59. “The language. of’ § 3283, by contrast, reaches. beyond the offense aiid its legal.
‘elements to the conduct ‘involv[ed]’ in the offense. That'linguistic expansion indicates Congress
intended courts to look beyond the bare Icgal charges in.deciding ‘whether § 3283 applicd.” Jd: at
59-60 (alteration. in original) (quoting § 3283). Maxwell.cites-one case.holding otherwise, but
that case ‘involved, a venue’ statute presenting significantly different concerns. See United. States
‘vi. Morgan, 393 F.3d 192, 200 (D.C. Cir. 2004). The Supreme Court has likewise: held that'a
statute which uses the language:“an offense that... involves fraud, or ‘deceit in which the loss to
the victim or victims execeds $10,000" is “consistent'with a. circumstance-specific approach.”
Nijhawan ¥. Holder, SST U.S. 29, 32, 38 (2009) (emphasis added). Thus, the;word “involves”
generally: means that.courts should. look to. the circumstances of an offense as: committed in, cach,
case. This ‘reading’ accords with a robust.legislative history indicating that Congress intended to
apply § 3283 to a wide range of crimes against.children. See Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 60;
Schneider, 801, F:3d at 196.

The ‘purposes underlying’the categorical approach do not: apply here cither. For statutes
dealing with prior convictions, “[t]he:categorical approach serves ‘practical’ purposes:. It
promotes judicial and administrative efficiency’ by*precluding the relitigation of past-convictions
in. minitrials conducted.long after the fact.” Moncriéffe v. Holdér, 569 U.S. 184, 200-011, (2013).
In the context of § 3283, there is no. prior conviction,to: assess, and the, jury’ will determine in the

first. instance! whether “the defendant engaged in the applicable: abusive conduct.” Weingarten,
