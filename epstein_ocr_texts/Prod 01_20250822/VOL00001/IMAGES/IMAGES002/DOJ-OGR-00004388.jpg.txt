decides to do,” the agrecment.'‘with Epstein. should “follow . . .'a,version of my’ written, ‘non=
prosécution agrecment” in. order to “avoid any’ state shenanigans and . . . keep the defense on. a,
strict timeline.” . :

Later that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta ‘and Sloman.a revised NPA ‘that called for a.
20-month jail sentence to, be! followed. by 10 months of home confinement. This, redrafted NPA
contained a provision that specified, “With. credit' for gain time, Epstein shall serve. at Icast
17: months ‘in a state correctional institution?!" Acosta reviewed the revised NPA.and amended
it to: include a statement clarifying, that it was Epstein’s obligation “to ‘undertake discussions with,
the State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent-her. version, of the
revised: NPA to Lefcourt. that: afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s ‘proposed change to him the
following day, after she leartied of it.

On September 11,2007, the court contacted. Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would.
be prepared to proceed. with the litigation concerning the computers the following day. At
Sloman’s direction, Villafafia:asked the court-to delay’the hearing, and the court-rescheduled it: for
the following wéck. At the same: time, anticipating that pléa ‘negotiations would fail, Villafania.
circulated a ‘revised indictment to: her co- -counsel. and Oosterbaan, secking their feedback: before:
sending it “through the chain. of command.” ‘Villafafia also sent Oosterbaan the revised NPA and.
told. him ‘she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined. the
USAO’s offer. Oosterbaan responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but] suppose it’s.
understandable.”

“Plead. to the three specified [state] charges, a. 30-month, sentence, split 20 in jail and 10. in.
‘community control,” and. agree'that;the girls ‘are victims ‘for purposes of damages. We also’put in,
deéadlities ‘for a-plea.and sentencing date.”
