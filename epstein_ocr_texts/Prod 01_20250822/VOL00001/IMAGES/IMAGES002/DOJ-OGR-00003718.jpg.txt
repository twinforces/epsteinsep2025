Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 10 of 16
As expected, both depositions were hostile. The questions posed to Ms. Maxwell were
poorly phrased without regard to the rules of evidence. Accordingly, counsel for Ms. Maxwell
was required to object many times. As this court knows, civil litigants are limited to three types
of objections: form, foundation, and privilege. When those objections are posed, the examiner
has the opportunity to ask for the basis of the objection. It is not incumbent, indeed it is not
permitted, for the objecting lawyer to expound on the basis for the objection unless asked.
Virtually all of the questions that form the basis of Counts Five and Six were the subject
of valid objections. A prerequisite to use of deposition testimony at trial is that the testimony
must be admissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence as if the deponent were present and
testifying. Fed. R. Civ. P. 32(1)(b). The form and foundation of the questions asked were
improper and largely not relevant in the context of the defamation action. It is unlikely that any
of the answers would have been admitted at any trial.
II. The Questions Were Fundamentally, and Fatally, Ambiguous
In addition to being poorly phrased, the questions were unquestionably ambiguous.
“TW |hen a line of questioning is so vague as to be “fundamentally ambiguous,’ the answers
associated with the questions posed may be insufficient as a matter of law to support
[a] perjury conviction.” United States v. Lighte, 782 F.2d 367 (2d Cir. 1986); see also United
States v. Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d 1218, 1221 (2d Cir. 1976). “Precise questioning is imperative as a
predicate for the offense of perjury.” Bronston v. United States, 409 U.S. 352, 362 (1973). “A
question is fundamentally ambiguous when it is not a phrase with a meaning about which men of
ordinary intellect could agree, nor one which could be used with mutual understanding by a
questioner and answerer unless it were defined at the time it were sought and offered as
testimony.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 375 (cleaned up). Here, the questions were “fundamentally
ambiguous,” containing particular undefined terms, “scheme” and “recruit” for example.
