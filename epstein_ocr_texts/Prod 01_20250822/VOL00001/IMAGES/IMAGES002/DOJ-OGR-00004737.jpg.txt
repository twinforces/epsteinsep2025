20-CR-330 (AJN)
Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

On April 27, 2021, the Court denied Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell’s request for
authorization to serve a subpoena to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP. Dkt. No. 252. The Court
requested the Government’s views as to three of those requests: Request 9, which sought
production of Minor Victim-2’s entire diary from her teenage years; Request 10, which targeted
a pair of boots that Minor Victim-2 allegedly received as a gift from Jeffrey Epstein and
Maxwell; and Request 11, which sought original versions of certain photographs. /d. The
Government submitted its views on May 4, 2021. Dkt. No. 269. It supplemented its letter on
May 6, 2021. Dkt. No. 271. The Defendant filed a response on May 12, 2021. Having
considered the parties’ views, the Defendant’s request is denied in full.

As noted, Request 9 seeks the original copy of a journal from an alleged victim from
when she was a teenager. Maxwell received copies of some of the pages in the journal from the
Government pursuant to Rule 16, but the Government represents that it does not have access to
the entire journal. In those pages, Minor Victim-2 describes a trip to New York in which she
spent time with Epstein and, among other things, visited his residence. Minor Victim-2 also
describes her impression of Epstein at the time. There is no indication that Maxwell is
mentioned there or anywhere else in the journal.
