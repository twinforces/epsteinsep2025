requested the same relating to Jane Doe 43 v. Epstein, et al., 17 Civ. 0616 (JGK) (SN). Because
of the ongoing and covert nature of the grand jury investigation, and consistent with its standard
practice under such circumstances, the Government did not notify the defendant or her counsel
that it had issued the subpoenas.

In response to receiving the subpoenas, Boies Schiller began producing materials not
covered by the protective orders in the relevant civil cases. However, Boies Schiller also had
advised the Government that although it would not otherwise contest compliance with the
subpoenas, it believed that the protective orders precluded full compliance.» (Exs. 8 & 9).
Accordingly, the Government applied ex parte and under seal to each relevant court (Judge Sweet
and Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn, respectively) to request that each court modify the respective
protective orders to permit compliance with the subpoenas. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. C).

Following a request by Judge Sweet for briefing supporting the Government’s initial
application, see Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at 4, 20; Ex. G at 6, the Government submitted ex parte and
sealed letters in support of its applications to each court on or about February 28, 2019. (Exs. 8 &
9). The Government wrote, “Where, as here, a grand jury subpoena has validly issued, and the
recipient of the subpoena is not contesting compliance—but rather seeking authorization to comply
with the subpoena—a court should grant such permission through limited modification of an
applicable protective order, absent countervailing interests not present in this case.” (/d. at 2). The
Government submitted that the court was “best guided” by Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins.
Co., 154 F.R.D. 91, 93 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), in which the court rejected an application for a party in
civil litigation to be held in contempt for complying with a grand jury subpoena by producing
3 Significantly, and as detailed herein, Boies Schiller did not produce to the Government any
materials subject to the protective orders until, as further described below, it received an order
granting it the ability to do so in one of the civil cases.
