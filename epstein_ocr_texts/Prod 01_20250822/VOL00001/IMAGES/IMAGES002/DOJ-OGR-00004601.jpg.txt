attend the hearing: In, his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here'was no: possible way: could have
believed that this state plea could. affect:the federal, investigation, or the rights of my: clients in‘ that:
federal investigation.”

In. Wild, the Eleventh. Circuit. panel stated that the: government ‘ “sccmingly” deferred to
Epstcin’s attorneys’ requests not to: notify the victims about the NPA, and that: in. sending’ the:
January and/May 2008 FBI Ictters, the government’s efforts “scem'to have g graduated from:passive
nondisclosure to (or at least close fo) active misrepresentation.”*3” Although both the appellate
court:and district court focused on.the FBI’s Ictters forwhich OPR concludes that neither Villafana,
Sloman, nor Acosta. was s responsible, OPR considered the courts” analyses ‘in evaluating, whether
February, 1, 2008, and. to “Edwards, were’ ~ misleading, "Therefore, OPR ‘considered “whether
Villafafia’s statements that the matter: was “under investigation” and her failure to inform all of the
‘victims whom She interviewed or Edwards about 'the NPA violated. FRPC. 4-4.1(a), 4-8.4(¢), or
4-8:4(d).

FRPC 4-4.1(a) prohibits an. attorney from, “knowingly ‘mak[ing] a false statement of
material fare or law toa. third person” during’ the representation. of.a.clicnt. The FRPC defines
“knowingly” as s “denot[ing] actual knowledge of the fact in question” and, states that such
knowledge may be “inferred from. circumstances.°*** The comment to FRPC 4-4.1 states that

“[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that.
are the cquivalent of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[f]or
dishonest conduet that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.1(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)
requires evidence that the attorney knew the statement in. question. was ‘false. Under ERPC
4-8.4(c), the intent. requirement: can, be satisfied. “mercly by showing that ‘the, conduct’ was
deliberate or knowing” ‘and the “motive: underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;
instead.the issue is'whether he or she:purposefully acted, 2439 Th FF ceinberg, the court concluded that
the prosecutor violated ‘FRPC. 4-41 and, 4-8.4(c) and, (d) by deliberately making untruthful
statements to a defense attorney, despite evidence that the prosecutor intended to help: the
defendant by making the statements. 4" ‘In this case, Villafania was fully aware ofthe signed.NPA.
when she: interviewed the victims: on January 31 and February l, 2008, and when she spoke to

question’ is whether this omission amounted to a knowing false statement or misrepresentation,

One. difficulty’ is. determining ‘what Villafafia actually said during conversations ‘that.
participants were: asked _to recall many years later. With respect to three: of the victims whom she:
interviewed in. January: and. February 2008, Villafafia contended that she discussed. the agreement:
