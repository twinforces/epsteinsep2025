I. FLORIDA RULES OF PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT

A. FRPC 4-4.1 — Candor in Dealing with Others

FRPC 4-4.1 prohibits a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact
or law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule
explains that “[m]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or
omissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular
statement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”

B. FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice

FRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,
deceit, or misrepresentation.

FRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice
of law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.

As previously noted, courts have determined that FRPC 4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct
that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to “conduct in connection with the practice
of law.” Frederick, 756 So. 2d at 87; see also Shankman, 41 So. 3d at 172.
