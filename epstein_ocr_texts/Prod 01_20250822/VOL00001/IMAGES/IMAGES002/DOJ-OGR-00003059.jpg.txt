to produce documents, the contents of which are not privileged, where the act of production is,
itself, (1) compelled, (2) testimonial, and (3) incriminating.” Jn re Three Grand Jury Subpoenas
Duces Tecum Dated Jan. 29, 1999, 191 F.3d 173, 178 (2d Cir. 1999).

Consistent with these requirements, the privilege only “prohibits the compelled disclosure
of documents when the act of production has independent communicative aspects—such as an
admission that the documents exist, that the subject possesses or controls the documents, that the
documents are authentic, or that the subject believes the documents are responsive to the
subpoena.” Jn re Various Grand Jury Subpoenas, 924 F. Supp. 2d 549, 552 (S.D.N.Y. 2013),

total of the Government’s information by conceding that he in fact has the papers.” Jd. at 411; see
also In re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, 1992, 1 F.3d 87, 93 (2d Cir. 1993);
Madanes v. Madanes, 186 F.R.D. 279, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 1999) (“[E]ven if documents contain
incriminating information, requiring a person to produce them does not implicate the Fifth
Amendment unless the act of production is itself testimonial in nature and incriminating to the
person making the disclosure.”).

iil. The Fifth Amendment — When Private Action Is Deemed
Government Action

As discussed above, “[t]he sole concern of the Fifth Amendment . . . is governmental
coercion.” Connelly, 479 U.S. at 170. “[T]he Fifth Amendment privilege is not concerned ‘with
moral and psychological pressures to confess emanating from sources other than official
coercion.’” Jd. (quoting E/stad, 470 U.S. at 305). For this reason, even “[t]he most outrageous
