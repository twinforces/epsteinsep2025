as a “non-prosecution agreement” came from Acosta, although Menchel may have communicated
that terminology to her. According to Villafafia, she asked that it include a mechanism for the
victims to be provided monetary compensation through 18 U.S.C. § 2255 in lieu of the restitution
that would have been available if Epstein were pleading guilty to federal charges.*° Acosta told
OPR that he “developed and approved” the term sheet.”

Before the document was presented to defense counsel, two terms were dropped from
Villafafia’s draft—one providing that the agreement would apply only to already-identified
victims, and another requiring the deal to be accepted, and Epstein to plead guilty, within the
month. The final term sheet was as follows:

to plea agreements, which involve the formal conviction of a corporation in a

court proceeding.

86 A civil remedy for personal injuries suffered by victims of certain crimes is provided for in the federal
criminal code at 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Subsection (a) of the statute, as in effect from July 27, 2006, to
March 6, 2013, provided as follows:

Any person who, while a minor, was a victim of a violation of section

2241(c), 2242, 2243, 2251, 2251A, 2252, 2252A, 2260, 2421, 2422, or 2423 of

this title and who suffers personal injury as a result of such violation, regardless

of whether the injury occurred while such person was a minor, may sue in any

appropriate United States District Court and shall recover the actual damages such

person sustains and the cost of the suit, including a reasonable attorney’s fee. Any

person as described in the preceding sentence shall be deemed to have sustained

damages of no less than $150,000 in value.
Villafafia also told OPR that she asked that the terms include the requirement that Epstein plead to an offense that
required him to register as a sexual offender; however, sex offender status was also mentioned in Menchel’s July 3,
2007 email to Villafafia recounting his preliminary discussions with Sanchez.
