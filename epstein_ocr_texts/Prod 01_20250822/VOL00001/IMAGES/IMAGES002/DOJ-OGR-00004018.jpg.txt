Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

I write to report an incident stemming from an attorney-client conference with Ghislaine
Maxwell: Guards on Ms. Maxwell’s security detail wrongfully seized and reviewed her
confidential legal documents and then intimidated Ms. Maxwell by standing over her as she used
the bathroom after threatening her with a disciplinary infraction. This incident has further
compromised Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial, to confer with counsel, and to retain
confidential legal documents. In addition, intimidation and humiliation by guards has further
exacerbated Ms. Maxwell’s feelings of insecurity due to officious power exerted upon her by
guards.

On Saturday, April 24, 2021, Leah Saffian, Esq. and I attended a pre-scheduled in-person
legal conference with Ms. Maxwell in the MDC. The entire 2.5-hour conference was conducted
under the constant watch of four to five guards, including a lieutenant, with a camera on a tripod
focused on Ms. Maxwell and counsel while recording audio and video, and captured on
surveillance cameras affixed within the visiting room. After counsel left the facility, Ms.
Maxwell called me to report that her legal papers were confiscated.

Later that day, I received an email from Sophia Papapetru, MDC legal counsel, which
stated:

It has been brought to my attention by the staff of MDC Brooklyn that Ms. Maxwell

received paperwork that was not in her possession upon entering the legal visiting

area. As you are aware, the policies set forth for MDC Brooklyn legal visits do not allow

for passing of any material during a legal visit. Due to our policy and procedures, the

additional documents that were provided to Ms. Maxwell were confiscated. Those

materials were put in an envelope and will be returned to you tomorrow upon your

arrival to the institution. Please note, that you may put these documents in the legal

mailbox in the lobby of the east building.

See Exhibit A.
