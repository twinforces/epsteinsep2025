Ogiins,.921 F.2d.442, 447 (2d Cir, 1990) (“The government bears the burden of proving that
the taint [of an-illegal.scarch] has been.alleviated.”)). Like a-Kastigar hearing, “the
government bears ‘the: heavy burden of proving that all, of the evidenec it proposes to use was
derived. from legitimate, independent sources.’ See United States, ¥. Allen, 864 F.3d 63, 9'1.(2d

Cir.2017) (quoting Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 453, 461-62 (1972) (holding that
‘use and derivative use immunity provides protection “from. the'use of compelled testimony, as
well.as ‘evidence derived dircetly: and indirectly therefrom,” and reversing conviction for. Fifth
Amendment, violation)). “[C]onelusory denials [of taint] are insufficient, as a matter of law to
Sustain the prosecution’s burden. of ‘proof:” Jd. at 94.

The government's April 21 letter, with-its vague and conclusory assurances, thus.
offers no reason to ‘postpone consideration, of, Ms. Maxwells motions to ‘suppress.

The -government’s purported reservation of rights is, also ‘without merit. Initially, itis
not at all, clear what the government means when it:says it might “use:relevant materials: from,
‘this set. for any: purpose permissible ‘under the Rules of Evidence.” (Dkt. No. 227, p 2). Butif
the government means that it:intends to-use the: suppression. material. for impeachment
purposes, that is.all the more reason to hold.an evidentiary hearing now-and to resolve Ms.
Maxwell’s motions before trial on the non-perjury counts.

There are at least two reasons why. First, while:the constitution in certain
circumstances allows the government'to use unconstitutionally-obtained.cvidence for.
impeachment.purposes, ¢.g., Harris v.. New York; 401 U.S.'222, 223-24 (1971) (statements
secured in violation of. Miranda are admissible for impeachment purposcs if voluntary), the
constitution forbids admission. of evidence for all purposes if the government’ s, conduct

violated duc-process, ¢.g:, New Jersey v. Portash, 440 U.S. 450,459 (1979) (due:process
