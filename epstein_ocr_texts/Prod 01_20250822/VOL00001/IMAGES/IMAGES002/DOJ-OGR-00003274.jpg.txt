Villafatia replied that whilc’a, federal, plea, agreement would be part of the court file and publicly
accessible, the NPA “‘would. not be made ‘public or filed with. the Court, but it would remain part:

E. The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement on a.Plea'to Federal. Charges

Negotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September 18, 2007. Responding to
Villafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkowitz suggested that Epstcin plead to one federal charge
with a 12-month,sentence,. followed by. one yearof supervised release with a requirement:for home
détention and two:years of state probation, with. the first six months of the state sentence: to be:
served ‘under community control. Villafafia replicd, “| know: that. the U.S. Attorney. will not go
below 18 months of: prison/jail. time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly
thereafter, Villafafia emailed. Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm:Beach manager:

drafting Informations, changing ‘plea. agreements, and ‘writing
factual ‘proffers. |] was supposed to ‘reecive'a, draft agreement from
them ‘yesterday, which. never arrived. At that time, they were
leaning towards ‘pleading only to state: charges and doing all of the
time.in state custody. - . .

Late last ‘night I talked to Jay Lefkowitz who asked about Epstein

of'full disclosure, I'did not believe that'Mr. Epstcin would’be cligible
because ‘he will, not’ be in, Zone A, or ‘B.''? This. morning’ Jay
Lefkowitz called aid said that was correct buts if we could get

My response: have him plead to two separate Informations. On, the.
first one.he gets 12. months’ imprisonment.and on the:second he gets
