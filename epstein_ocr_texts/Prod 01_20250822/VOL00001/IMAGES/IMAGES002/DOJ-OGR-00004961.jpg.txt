because it is doing so in pleadings, it is not crossing the line in the local rules. For
example, the Government filed in a public pleading that Ms. Maxwell was vaccinated
while at MDC. (Dkt. No. 196). There was no valid reason for saying this at all, let alone
in a public pleading. (Imagine if the defense publicly filed medical information about
one of the accusers). But it believed that it could legally speak to the media in such a
fashion.

The Government also falsely claimed that Ms. Maxwell had an “eye mask” and
that she was responsible for the stench in her cell. Jd. Both claims were proven to be
untrue. She has never been provided an eye mask and the stench in her cell is caused
by a sewage problem in the jail, which has been well-documented by other inmates and
judges. But the damage was done. The media went into a feeding frenzy, reporting the
false Government statements and ignoring the truth when it came out. As Mark Twain
said, “a lie can travel halfway around the world while the truth is still putting on its
shoes.” The Government’s responsibility for the fair administration of justice
commands it to foster a realignment of the scales.

The Government’s request should be denied because (1) undersigned counsel
does not currently represent Ms. Maxwell, and (2) the Op-Ed did not violate the local
rules.
