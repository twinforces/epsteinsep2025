particularly strong interest to'the authorities of the: state: « or local
jurisdiction in’which they occur, cither because of the nature of the
offense, ‘the, identity’ of the offender or victim, the ‘fact ‘that’ the
investigation. was conducted primarily by state or local
investigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,
when. ‘it. appears that the Federal. interest in ‘prosccution is less
substantial than the interest of state or local, authorities,
consideration should, be given ‘to referring the casé to those
authorities: rather than commencing ‘or recommending: a Federal
prosecution. . .

Another comment; cautions that:in. assessing whether to defer to state or local. authoritics, “the
Federal prosecutor should bé alert. to any local conditions, attitudes, relationships or other
circumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood ofthe state or local authoritics conducting a.
thorough and successful prosccution.”

‘or beliefs; the prosccutor’s “own personal feelings” about the:person. or the: victim; or the: ‘possible:
effect of the decision on the prosecutor’s own professional or ‘personal circumstances. When.
opting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor-should.ensure'that:the reasons for'that decision,
are communicated. to, the investigating agency and reflected:in the office files. USAM § 9-27.270.

Department has'a long-standing:policy, known.as the Petite:policy, governing federal prosecutions
charged. after the: initiation of a prosecution in another. jurisdiction ‘based. on. the same or similar
conduct.'°? The’ general principles applicable: to the prosecution. or declination, decision, are sct.
forth in USAM  § 9-2.03.1, “Dual and, Successive: Prosecution, Policy (‘Petite Policy’), which,

prosecution resulting in an acquittal, a.conviction, including one resulting: froma plea agreement,
or a dismissal or other termination. on,the merits after jeopardy. has attached.”
