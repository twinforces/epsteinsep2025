Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 149 of 349

Some offenses, even though in violation of Federal law, are of

particularly strong interest to the authorities of the state or local

jurisdiction in which they occur, either because of the nature of the

offense, the identity of the offender or victim, the fact that the

investigation was conducted primarily by state or local

investigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,

when it appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less

substantial than the interest of state or local authorities,

consideration should be given to referring the case to those

authorities rather than commencing or recommending a Federal

prosecution.
Another comment cautions that in assessing whether to defer to state or local authorities, “the
Federal prosecutor should be alert to any local conditions, attitudes, relationships or other
circumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local authorities conducting a
thorough and successful prosecution.”

USAM § 9-27.260 identifies impermissible considerations relating to the decision whether
to initiate or decline a federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision may not be based on
consideration of the person’s race, religion, sex, national origin, or political association, activities,
or beliefs; the prosecutor’s “own personal feelings” about the person or the victim; or the possible
effect of the decision on the prosecutor’s own professional or personal circumstances. When
opting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor should ensure that the reasons for that decision
are communicated to the investigating agency and reflected in the office files. USAM § 9-27.270.

2. USAM § 9-2.031: The Petite Policy

Although the Constitution does not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and
federal authorities, even when the conduct charged is identical in both charging jurisdictions, the
Department has a long-standing policy, known as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions
charged after the initiation of a prosecution in another jurisdiction based on the same or similar
conduct.!°? The general principles applicable to the prosecution or declination decision are set
forth in USAM § 9-2.031, “Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’),” which
contains guidelines for a federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring
a federal prosecution based on the substantially same act or transaction involved in a prior state or
federal proceeding. The policy applies “whenever there has been a prior state or federal
prosecution resulting in an acquittal, a conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,
or a dismissal or other termination on the merits after jeopardy has attached.”

In circumstances in which the policy applies, a prosecutor nonetheless can initiate a new
federal prosecution when three substantive prerequisites exist. The prerequisites are as follows:

(1) The matter must involve a substantial federal interest. The determination whether

a substantial federal interest is involved is made on a case-by-case basis. Matters
