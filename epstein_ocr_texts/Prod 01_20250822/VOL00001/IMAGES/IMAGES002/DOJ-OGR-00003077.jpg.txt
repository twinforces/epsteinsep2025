Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 143 of 239
Government has responded with reliable information directly rebutting the defendant’s allegations,
there is no material issue of fact sufficient to justify an evidentiary hearing.**

The defendant cites Franks, to suggest that a hearing is somehow warranted, but her motion
falls far short of the standard required to obtain a hearing. “While the Franks analysis discussed
above is typically employed to evaluate misstatements and omissions relating to probable cause,
the Second Circuit has extended the Franks analysis to other Title III requirements for obtaining a
warrant.” United States v. Rajaratnam, No. 09 Cr. 1184 (RJH), 2010 WL 4867402, at *18
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 24, 2010). The defendant fails to identify the standard that would govern such a
hearing. In light of the interests implicated by a Title III wiretap, the USAO-SDNY submits that
the defendant’s depositions in a civil matter, even with a protective order, are no more significant
than the interests implicated by a Title III wiretap. As such, the exacting standard of Franks should
apply. On this record, the defendant has not made a threshold showing that the Government acted
with the intent to mislead or in reckless disregard for the truth. The Franks standard is rightly a
“high one,” Rivera, 928 F.2d at 604, and one the defendant has failed to meet here.

The defendant’s bald assertions alone do not entitle her to a fishing expedition in the form
of a hearing.

V. The Jury Should Decide Whether the Defendant Committed Perjury

Counts Five and Six of the Indictment allege that, during the course of two depositions, the
defendant knowingly made false material declarations, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1623. The
defendant moves to dismiss those Counts, arguing that the Court can determine now—on a pre-
“4 For similar reasons, the defendant’s request for discovery regarding this matter should be denied.
The defendant has failed to meet her burden under Rule 16 of making “a prima facie showing of
materiality and must offer more than the conclusory allegation that the requested evidence is
material.” Urena, 989 F. Supp. 2d at 261 (citations omitted). Because the defendant has offered
nothing more than her conjecture, based on an inaccurate and hearsay-ridden article, that some
unspecified evidence might exist, her request for discovery should be denied.
