3 If there are questions that I have
4 instructed the witness not to answer and
5 it later turns out the judge disagrees
6 with my characterization, we will be
7 back to revisit it, but we are done as
8 far as I'm concerned.
9 MR. BOIES: The deposition is not
10 closed. There are a number of
11 instructions not to answer. I think it
12 is a fair point that if the court were
13 to conclude that none of the questions
14 that have been instructed need to be
15 answered, we're not going to be
16 continuing the deposition, barring some
17 additional information coming to light.
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: I think we agree
19 then.
20 THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 2:51
21 p.m., and we are going off the record.
