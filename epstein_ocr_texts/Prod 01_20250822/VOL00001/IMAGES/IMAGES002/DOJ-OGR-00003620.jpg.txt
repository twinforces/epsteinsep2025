closed.

If there are questions that I have

instructed the witness not to answer and
Lt later turns out the judge disagrees
with my characterization, we will be
back to revisit it, but we are done as
far as I'm concerned.

MR. BOIES: The deposition is not
closed. Ther√© are a number of

instructions not to answer. I think it

is a fain point that if the court were

to conclude that none of the questions
that have been instructed need to be
answered, we're not going to be
continuing the deposition, barring some
additional information Goming to light.

MR. PAGLIUCA: I think we agree

then.
THE VIDEOGRAPHER: The time is 2:51
2, and we are going off the record.
