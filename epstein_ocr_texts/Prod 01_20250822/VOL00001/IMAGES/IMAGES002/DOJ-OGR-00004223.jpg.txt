conduct. involving Accuser-3 was an overt.act in furtherance of a conspiracy, it argues that it is
entitled to, imply that the conduct: itself was unlawful. The obvious ‘flaws in this logic are at least’
threefold. /irs/, the Indictment. does not merely imply that the alleged conduct :involving
Accuser-3 was unlawful; it specifically and falsely characterizes the conduct as “sexual[]

conspiracy need not itself be unlawful. See, e-g., Opp. 161 (“It is axiomatic that a ‘conspiracy:
does not require a:completed substantive crime.”). And third, the government’s reasoning is
citcular: It. argues simultaneously that Accuser-3"s lawful sexual encounters with Epsteiri
demonstrate the existence of a.conspiracy, and that the existence of a conspiracy: makes those
‘sexual. encounters ‘unlawful.

Since the governinient concedes that Epstein’s alleged sexual contact with.Accuser-3 was
‘consensual and lawful, and.that.Accuser-3 was above the legal age of consent, the government’s
allegation that Ms. Maxwell was complicit in the “sexual[] abuse[]” of Accuser-3 amounts 'to:a
knowingly false accusation that she: committed a crime. It is hard to:conceive of a more:
inflammatory or prejudicial allegation.

Also troubling is the. yoverniment’s statement that Accuser-3 ‘will testify to her “subjective
experience” of her admittedly lawful. sexual encounters with-Epstein “as traumatic, exploitative,
and. abusive.” See Opp. 1.62 n.57 (emphasis, added). To the extent that evidence’regarding
Accuset-3°s itivolvement in lawful. sexual activity in England while she was above the age of.
legal, consent.has any relevance whatsoever to an alleged conspiracy to cause-underage girls to
‘travel in the United States to engage in illegal sex acts, that:relevance certainly does ‘not
encompass Accuser-3’s: “subjective:experience” of her lawful, ;consensual encounters. The

government’s intention to present such testimony further demonstrates that Accuser-3’s function.
