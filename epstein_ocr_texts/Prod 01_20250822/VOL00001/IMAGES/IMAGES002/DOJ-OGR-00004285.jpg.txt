progeny do not control. The Court: should instead follow Gebhic.and find that’NPA: precludes
the USAO-SDNY from charging Counts Five and Six.

This result is consistent with the terms. and the drafting history ofthe NPA. As noted in
our. previous motion, the use of the phrase “the United. States” in the co-conspirator. immunity
provision of the NPA stands. in stark contrast to Epstein’s immunity provision, which is
expressly limited to the SDFL. (Dkt, 223 at 9-10). The broad language of the co-conspirator
provision reflects Epstein’s desire, which his, attorneys communicated to the USAO-SDFE, that
he-would be “the only oné-who, takes the blame for what happened” (Ex. A, OPR. Report at 167
(internal, quotations omitted)). ‘Furthermore, it is consistent with Epstein’s goal. “to resolve
globally. his state‘and federal criminal liability,” which is set:forth in,the factual recitals of the
NPA. (Ex. Bat 2 of 7; see.also Ex. D'{ 5 (declaration.of AUSA.A. Marie Villafaia-noting that
Epstein, ““sought-a, global resolution of the:matter”). Epstein.and his counsel were clearly aware
that the irivestigation had, extended beyond, the SDFL and involved New York-based witnesses.
Indeed, we now‘know from. discovery recently produced by the government:that the government
interviewed at least three New’ York-based witnesses in:connection with the Florida.
Investigation, two. of-whom implicated other. potential. co-conspirators of Epstein. (Exs. E-G).
Hence, these: provisions of the NPA reflect. Epstein’s desire to ensure that he would not’become
embroiled in. subsequent prosecutions of his “potential, co-conspirators” in any other districts.
(Dkt. 223 at 11).

Moreover, this result is consistent with fundamental, fairness. Allowing a federal district

to-prosecute a defendant: for'an offense that's identical’to one’that’was already resolved as ‘part.of

* For, the;same reasons,the Court:is not bound ‘by subsequent Second Circuit decisions:interpreting Annabi, which
