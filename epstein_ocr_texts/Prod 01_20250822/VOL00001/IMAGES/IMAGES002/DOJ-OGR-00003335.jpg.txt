-PART THREE: ANALYSIS

Following the Miami Herald. report. in November 2018, media, scrutiny’ of and public
attention to, the USAO’s handling ofits Epstein investigation has continued unabated. Atthcheart,
of the public’s,concern is the-perception that Epstcin’s ‘.8-month. sentence, which resulted in.a.13-
month term of: actual incarccration, was too Icnient and inadequately punished Epstcin’s criminal
conduct, Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from.
Epstein’s conduct, the’publichas reecived only limited information regarding the decision-making
process leading tothe’ signed-NPA. .A’s a'result,; questions have ariscn about Acosta and his:staff’s
motivations for cntcring into 'the NPA. ‘Publicly released communications. between, prosecutors
and defense counscl, the ‘leniency of the sentence, and an. nunusta’ non- ‘prosccution provision: ‘inthe:
they'w were ¢ motivated by improper ‘influences, such a as s their preexisting: and, personal relationships
with his attorneys, or-even.corrupt influences, such as the recciptof personal benefits from Epstein.

Through its investigation, OPR.has Sought to to answer the following core questions: (1) who
specific terms; 2) did the NPA or any y of its provisions violate Department policies or 1 other rules
or regulations; and :(3) ‘were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by’
improper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. To the extent that.available records and:witness
‘interviews shed light on-these questions, OPR shows in detail the process that Ied:to'the. NPA, from.
the initial complaint to the USAO. through, the intense and often confusing negotiation ‘process.
After a thorough and detailed examination of thousands of contemporancous ‘records and.extensive
intervicws of subjects and witnesses, OPR, is able to ‘answer most of the significant questions
concerning’the NPA’s origins,and development. Although some questions remain, OPR'scts forth
its. conclusions. and the bases, for them. in this Part.

ACCOUNTABLE FOR IT

Although Acosta did not sign the NPA, he approved it, with knowledge ofits terms. He
revised drafts of the NPA and. added Janguage ‘that. he thought appropriate. Acosta told OPR.that:
he cither was informed. of, or had access to::information, concerning, the underlying facts of the
case against.Epstein.. OPR: did not find, any evidence suggesting that:any of his subordinates.misled,
him about the facts or withheld information that would, have influenced his décision, atid Acosta.
did not-make such, a claim'‘to OPR. As.Acosta.affirmed in his OPR. interview, the “three pronged.
resolution, two-ycars .. . , registration and restitution, ... . ultimately that was approved on my
authority: . (UJftimately;, J. approved it, and so, 1. .., accept that. I?m. not. .. pushing away:
responsibility for it.”

In.making its misconduet assessments, OPR:considers the conduct.of subjects individually.
Menchel, Sloman, Lourie, and. Villafafia were involved. in. the matter to varying’ degrees, at.
