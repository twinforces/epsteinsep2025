Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21. Page 287 of 349

Acosta told OPR. that there:was no requirement to notify the victims because the NPA was
“nota plea, it’s deferring in:favor of a state prosecution.” Acosta’said, “[W ]hcther or not;victims’
views were elicited is something I think was the focus of the trial team, and not. something that: |
was focused. on.at' least at this:time.” Acosta could. not recall any‘particular concern that. factored
‘into the decision.not to consult with-the victims before entering:into'the-NPA, but he acknowledged
to: OPR, “[C]learly, given the: way it’s ‘played out, it may have ‘been, much better if we had.
[consulted with the victims].

As indicated, ‘the contemporancous récords refléct, little about decisions ‘made regarding
victim consultation prior to'when the. NPA-’was signed. Villafafia:raised the issuc in writing-to her
supervisors in early September, but there is no evidence showing whether her supervisors
affirmatively rejected. Villafafia’s contention that the USAO was obligated to consult'with victims,
ignored. the suggestion, or failed to address it for other reasons, possibly because of the: extended,
uncertainty as to whether Epstein would.cvér agrée to'the government’s plea proposal. OPR notes
that its. subject interviews were conducted more than:a. decade: after the NPA.was signed, and the
passage of time affected. the recall of cach individual OPR interviewed. Although. Villafaifia
recalled. discussions with, her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did not, and
Menchel,contended.that Villafania’s recollection:is inaccurate. Assuming the discussions occurred,
the timing is unclear. Sloman ‘was on vacation. before the NPA was signed, so, a call ‘with Villafania.
about'victim notification at that point in time appearsunlikcly. Any discussion involving Menchel
necessarily:oceurred. before August 3, 2007, when it was unclear whether the defense would. agree:
to. the government’s offer. ‘Supervisors could well have decided that at:such, an carly stage, there
was little’to discuss:with victims.

To the-extent that Villafafia’s supervisors affirmatively made a decision not-to consult’
victims, Villafana’s recollection suggests that the decision-arose from supervisors? concerns about
the confidentiality of plea negotiations and.a.belicf that the government was not obligated to
consult. with ‘victims about a pre-charge disposition, That. belicf accurately reflected the
Department’s, position, atthe! time about application of the:CVRA. Importantly, OPR. did not. find.
evidence éstablishing that the lack of consultation was for the purpose of silencing victims, and,
Villafafia told OPR that she did not hear any supervisor cxpress:concerns about-victims: objccting
to the agreement if they Icarned .of it. ‘Because the: subjects did. not: violate: any: clear and.
unambiguous standard. in the CVRA ‘by failing to consult with the victims about the NPA, OPR.
concludes that:they didnot engage ‘in professional, misconduct.

treatment of the victims. Although the government, was ‘not obligated to consult with victims, a.
more: straightforward. and, open approach’ would ‘have been consistent with. the government’s goal
to treat victims of crime: with. fairness and respect. This was-particularly important in a case: in
