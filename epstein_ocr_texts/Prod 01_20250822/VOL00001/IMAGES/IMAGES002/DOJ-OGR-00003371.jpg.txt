Investigation. “43 Media reports in, mid-2009 suggested. Epstein was released. from. ‘his state:
incarecration “carly” because he was. assisting in,a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern,
District. of New: York. involving Epstcin’s former employer, Bear: Stearns. At the time, Villafania,
‘was notified by the AUSAs haridliig the matter that they “had neverhcard of’ Epstcii.and he was
Providing * ‘absolutely t no cooperation” * to ) the g government. In. 201 l, Villafana reported to senior
it] is truce.” Villafafia told OPR that ther rumor ‘that Epstein had cooperated with. the ease ‘in, 1 New
York:was “‘completely-false.” Acosta told OPR.that he didnot have any:information about.Epstein
cooperating in. a financial irivestigation or relating ‘to media reports that! Epstcin had. been an
“intelligence. asset.” a

Tn addition, to the contemporancous record attesting that Epstein..was not, a cooperating
witness in,a.fedcral matter, OPR:found no evidence suggesting that Epstcin was such.a:cooperating:
Witness or “intelligence assct,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s
investigation—bclieved. that ‘to be the case, or that. Epstein was afforded any benefit.on such.a
basis. OPR.did not find any reference to Epstcin’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion.
that he had assisted iin.a different matter, ‘in, any of the numerous communications:sent by defense
counsel to'the USAO andthe Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel. would have
omitted any reason Warranting. leniency for Epstein if it had existed.

Accordingly, OPR. concludes that none:of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided.
Epstein with any, benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an ‘unrelated federal
Investigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had, received benefits. for
cooperation in. any. ‘matter.

INVESTIGATION THROUGH. THE NPA

Although OPR finds that none, of thé subjécts committed professional misconduct in. this,
matter, OPR. concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment: when. he agreed to end the federal
investigation through the’ NPA. Acosta’s flawed application,of Pctite policy principles to this case
and his concerns with overstepping ‘the boundaries of federalism, led ‘to ‘a, decision ‘to resolve. the
federal investigation through an NPA that'‘was, too difficult: to administer, lcaving Epstein. free to
manipulate the conditions of his sentence to, his Own advantage. The NPA. rclied on state
authoritics to implement its key:terms, leading'to an:absence'of control by federal authorities over
the: process. Although, the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed. in the NPA,
such as gain, time and.community control, many other key. issues were not, such. as. work release
and. mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as;promising’
not to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with little discussion. or'consideration
by ‘the. prosecutors. In addition, although, there ‘were evidentiary and legal challenges to a.

a When OPR asked. Acosta.about:his: apparent equivocation-during his 2019 press conference, in answ ering a.
media. ‘question. about: whether’he had knowledge of Epstein being an.* “intelligence asset, Acosta stated to OPR that:
“the answer is.no.”” Acosta was made:aware that OPR could useia classified setting to discuss intelligence information.
