Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 282 Filed 05/14/21 Page2of2
can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that these factors necessitate more
frequent safety and security checks. The Government also indicates that the prohibition on eye
masks is a generally applicable policy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other non-
contraband items to cover her eyes.

To the extent that Maxwell’s April 29, 2021 letter asks the Court to override BOP’s
determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check procedures, that
request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported. Certainly nothing in the
record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with Maxwell’s ability to prepare for
her trial and communicate with her lawyers. Defense counsel’s May 7, 2021 letter, Dkt. No.
272, describes generalized grievances but makes no additional specific and supported application
for relief. Nevertheless, the Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pre-
trial detainees can be reduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to
continue to ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP
determines are necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,
and consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees.

The Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel
for the MDC.
