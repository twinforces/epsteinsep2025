forward, that cither there is this pre-indictment resolution, or we go forward with, an, indictment.

The September meeting did not;alter or shift ourposition.”!

Villafafia told OPR. that after hearing the defense, argument, Acosta reiterated that the
federal interest:in the:case: could. be vindicated only by a:state plea ‘to an offense that required,
sexual, offender registration, resulted. in a two-ycar term, of incarceration, and was subject to: the
18, U.S.€. § 2255 process ‘for providing compensation to 'the victims. When defense counsel
objected to'the:registration requirement, Acosta.held.firm, and he ‘also-rejected the defense:proposal
for a sentence of home: confinement. In.a.subscquent email cxchange.'with Criminal. Division.
Deputy: Assistant: Attorney General Sigal. Mandelkcr,;who supervised CEOS, Oosterbaan reported
that the: mecting was “non-eventful,” noting that defense counsel, argued. “federalism” and might
approach Criminal Division. Assistant. Attorney General, Alice: Fisher to present. that argument.
directly: to her.

PROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED

Acosta had. dispensed. with ‘the August. 17, 2007 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s
August 3, 2007 letter, :in order to allow the defense to mect with him. After that. meeting, and
although. Villafafia continued to plan.to file charges.on September 25, no new plea deadline was
established, and.the negotiations continued through most. of September.

The defense used that time to:push the USAO to make concéssions. Because Acosta was
not willing to compromise on the ‘issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means
through which the victims could seck: monetary damages, the negotiations focused.on the:term. of
imprisonment. As the confemporancous emails show, the USAQ did, not hold.to its. position that.
a:two-year term, of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an,
agreement with the defense on Epstcin’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in cither’
federal or state. court, or both, and Villafana. ‘Spent considerable time. and effort working. with.
defense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the ‘course of that
process, the: agreement: was revised to: require that Epstein, accept a sentence of 18 months, with,
the ‘understanding that under the state’s, sentencing procedures, he would, likely ‘serve, just: 15
months.

A. The Incarceration. Term Is ‘Reduced from 24 Months to 20’Months

Shortly after the September 7,'2007 mecting, Epstein. attorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had.
not’been present at the mecting, spoke with both,Acosta and‘Lourie, and.made:a new‘ counteroffer,
proposing that Epstein serve 15 months in jail, followed. by 15 months in‘home confinement. On,
the afternoon of Monday; September 10, 2007, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she
wanted to discuss. with him, including her concern that defense. counsel ‘was, pushiig for a.
resolution that would allow Epstein to avoid. incarceration and possibly sexual. offender
registration, Villafafia.stated that Lefeourt’s counteroffer was “a, reasonable ‘counteroffer in light:
of our starting position of 24 months,” but added that. it was “a ‘really. low sentence.” Villafafia.

JON Sloman. echoed this point, telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused on, the :issue of federalism, but:the

USAG had.already decided'to defer prosecution to the state;and after the meeting, the USAO-continued.on that path.
