The Government, respectfully: submits this letter in ‘response’ to the’ Court’s Order dated.
October 14, 2021 (Dkt. No. 347) ordering the Government to respond to'the defendant’s October
14,2021 letter regarding:the deadline for filing a:motion-under Federal Rule of Evidence 412 (Dkt.

deadline for [her] to file.a motion.under Federal Rule. of Evidenee 412.” (Dkt. No. 345).

Federal Rule: of Evidence 412(a)(1) provides that in a.case involving allegations of sexual
misconduct, “cvidence offered to ‘prove that. a. victim engaged in. other scxual behavior” is
inadmissible. The Rule “aims to safeguard the alleged. victim against the invasion of privacy,
potential cmbarrassment and scxual. stereotyping that ‘is associated. with public disclosure of
intimate sexual details.’" United States v. Rivera, 799 F.3d 180, 184 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting Fed.
