particularly strong interest to'the authorities of the: state: « or local
jurisdiction in’which they occur, cither because of the nature of the
offense, ‘the, identity’ of the offender ‘or victim, the ‘fact ‘that’ the
investigation. was conducted primarily by state or local
investigators, or some other circumstance. Whatever the reason,
when. ‘it. appears that the Federal interest in prosecution is less,
substantial than the interest of state or local. authoritics,
consideration should, be given ‘to referring the casé to, thosé
authoritics: rather than commencing ‘or recommending a Federal
prosecution. . .

Another comment; cautions that:in. assessing whether to defer to state or local. authorities, “the
Federal prosecutor should bé alert. to any local conditions, attitudes, relationships or other
circumstances that might cast doubt on the likelihood ofthe state or local authoritics conducting a.
thorough and successful prosccution.”

USAM § 9-27.260 identifies impermissible considerations relating tothe decision whether
to initiate or decline a federal prosecution. ‘Specifically, the decision ‘may not be based on
cconsideration-of the person’ 's race, religion, scx, national. origin, or political association, activities,
‘or beliefs; the prosccutor’s “own personal feelings” about the: ‘person. or the:victim, or the:possible:
effect of the decision on the prosecutor’s own professional or ‘personal circumstances. When.
opting to decline federal prosecution, the prosecutor-should.ensure'that:the reasons for'that decision,
are communicated. to, the investigating agency and reflécted:in the office files. USAM § 9-27.270.

Although the Constitution docs not prohibit prosecutions of a defendant by both state and
federal authorities, even when'the conduct charged is identical in both charging, jurisdictions, the
Department has'a long-standing:policy, known.as the Petite:policy, governing x. federal prosecutions
charged. after the: initiation of a prosecution in another, jurisdiction ‘based on. the same or similar
conduct.’ The’ general principles applicable: to the prosecution, or declination, decision, are set.
forth in USAM. § 9-2.03.1, “Dual and, Successive: Prosecution, Policy (‘Petite Policy’), which,
contains g guidelines fe for a federal prosccutor’s excreise ofdiscretion in dcremmining wheiher to bring
federal proceeding. The policy applics. * whenever ‘there: has been a prior state or federal
prosecution resulting in an acquittal, a.conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,
ora dismissal or other termination. onthe merits: after jeopardy. has attached.”

In. circumstances in. which the ‘policy applics, a. prosecutor noncthcless. can initiate. a new
federal prosecution when three substantive: prerequisites exist. The prerequisites arc:as follows:
