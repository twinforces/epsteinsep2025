want to sec that,” ‘perhaps. because: of ‘heir lack oft experience ‘with: these types of ¢ cases” or a.
misguided. belief “that [Epstcin’s] attorneys would, not. engage in this behavior.” Villafafia. told,
OPR that she “could. not secm to gct [her supervisors] to. understand the scriousness of' Epstcin’s
behavior and the fact-that he was probably: continuing to:commit the behavior, and that there was
a. need. to move with, necessary speed. mo ‘Nonetheless, ‘Villafafia followed the ‘guidance of her
‘immediate supervisor and did not.send.the email.

Like Lourie, Menchcl, told OPR that lic belicved mecting with defense. counsel, was good
practice. Menchcel told OPR ‘that. he: saw “no downside” to hearing the defense ‘point of vicw.
alternatively, arceent arguments the defense would inevitably raise if the ‘case’ c went forward, and.
Menchcel believed it would be to the USAO’s advantage to Icarn about:such arguments, in’ advance:
Méenichel.also told OPR that.he did notirceall Villafania ever'articulating a concern that Epstein was
continuing'to offend, and. in Menchel’s view, Epstcin:was:“already undcr.a microscope, at lcast in.
Florida,” and.it would have been “the height of stupidity” for Epstcin to continuc to offend. in those:
circumstances.

the victims. In the cmail transmitting the addendum. to Lourie, Menchcel, Sloman, and, her

make Lee "changes now or st wait until w we have received approval of the current nt charging steatewy.”
The addendum itself related,to a particular victim referredto as the minor who “‘saw‘Epstcin. most.
frequently” and who, had allegedly. engaged ‘in sexual activity with, both Epstein ‘and :an Epstein
assistant. Inthe. addendum, Villafaria identified documents. she had found corroborating. four
scparate statements made by this:victim.

Villafana, told OPR. that; the only victim. about. whom ‘any supervisor ever articulated,
specific credibility issues; was the victim discussed inthe addendum. Louric told OPR that:he had
no specific recollection of :the.addendum, but. it Was. “reasonable” ‘to assume that the addendum.
addressed one: particular victim because: no one had identified specific concerns relating to any
other victim, ‘Villafafia’s immediate supervisor similarly told.OPR. that to her recollection, the:
discussions ‘about, credibility issues were gencric rather than.ticd to specific victims.
