“misstatements” to Chief Judge McMahon and the extent of coordination between the USAO-
SDNY and Boies Schiller prior to the issuance of the subpoena. (Def. Mot. 3 at 16). With respect
to that alleged “misconduct,” the defendant appears to makes two general accusations: first, that
in 2016 Boies Schiller encouraged the USAO-SDNY to investigate the defendant for perjury, and
second, that the Government’s statement to Chief Judge McMahon as to whether she was facing a
“Chemical Bank kind of situation” was false. Neither is correct, for the reasons described above.
Because the defendant has proffered no reliable evidence to support any of the accusations
contained in her motion papers, and because the Government has responded to those accusations
with AUSA-1’s contemporaneous notes of the February 29, 2016 meeting and notes from an
interview of AUSA-1 conducted by the USAO-SDNY and the FBI (see Exs. 4 & 5), as well as
relevant AUSA-1 emails (Exs. 6 & 7), such a hearing is not warranted.

a. Applicable Law

“TE]videntiary hearings should not be set as a matter of course, but only when the petition
alleges facts which if proved would require the grant of relief.’ Grant v. United States, 282 F.2d
165, 170 (2d Cir. 1960). “In order to make the requisite showing in sufficient detail, the defendant

States v. Noble, No. 07 Cr. 284 (RJS), 2008 WL 140966, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 11, 2008). “In the
absence of such an affidavit, or when the allegations contained in such an affidavit are general and
conclusory, an evidentiary hearing is unnecessary.” United States v. Dewar, 489 F. Supp. 2d 351,
359 (S.D.N.Y. 2007). A district court may decide the motion without a hearing if the moving
papers do not create a genuine issue as to any material fact. United States v. Caming, 968 F.2d
232, 236 (2d Cir. 1992), abrogated on other grounds by Ratzlaf v. United States, 510 U.S. 135
(1994. Moreover, it is well settled that a material issue of fact sufficient to justify an evidentiary
