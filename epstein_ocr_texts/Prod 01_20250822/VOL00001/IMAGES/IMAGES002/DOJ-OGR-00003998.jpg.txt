to evaluate the photographs for admissibility purposes, or even to decide which photographs she
will want to introduce in her own defense, she will otherwise need to make an appointment to
view these materials at a government office.

Further, after the government discloses its testifying witness list, counsel will have to
comb through the thousands of photos once again to determine which photographs she needs to
use for impeachment purposes or for affirmative defense evidence. And, again, the images
contain metadata that defense counsel must forensically analyze. Because defense counsel do not
even have all of the images, this investigation cannot be accomplished in advance of the July 12,
2021 trial.

F. The new charges and discovery require the assistance of defense experts

In addition to locating, investigating, and perhaps interviewing a significant number of
potential witnesses, counsel also anticipate that the defense may require the specialized
knowledge of expert witnesses to analyze evidence that is now potentially relevant due to the
expanded time frame of the allegations. Ms. Maxwell anticipates that the “highly confidential
hard drives” will need to be forensically examined by a computer specialist to determine actual
file creation dates, any alterations, and the original location of the data. Although the government
has not identified any trial exhibits, it seems probable that the services of various forensic
examiners may be necessary to analyze the exhibits.

Ms. Maxwell will also need to receive and review the 20,000 pages of “new” material to
provide that information to potential defense experts for consideration. None of this can happen
in time to make appropriate disclosures in advance of trial. See United States v. Santos, No. S 91
