Re: United States-v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government writes with respect to the Court’s Order. dated April 19, 2021, which.
directed the Government to notify the Court, by tomorrow whether it- intends to “use: any of the
documents subject to the-pending motions to suppress in the trial of the non-perjury counts in this
case.” (Dkt.. No. 2.1.6). The:Government respectfully requests that the Court grant the Government.
‘until Thursday, April, 22, 202] ,'to submit its response:

The Government is carefully considering, the Court’s, Order, and. has. begun reviewing its
file, considering: Icgal, issucs, and having internal, conversations’ with. supervisors .in. order to
thoughtfully and accurately ‘respond to the Court. In‘particular, although the materials at-issue are
not likelyto be central'to the Government’s case in chief in:the'trial of the non-perjury counts, the
Government ‘nonetheless recognizes the importance of anticipating how, these materials may’ be
relevant to (and ‘used at) the trial. For ¢xample, and among other considérations, the matcrials
include transcripts of depositions of witnesses who may testify at trial, and the Government is
mindful, of potential, uses of such, material ‘that; might arise during the: cross-cxamination of both,
Government and defense witnesses whose prior statements are. cncompassed within the materials

at issue.
