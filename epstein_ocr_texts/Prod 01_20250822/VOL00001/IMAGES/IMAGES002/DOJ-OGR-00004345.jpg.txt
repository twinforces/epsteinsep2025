On July:24,'2006, Villafafia alerted:‘Sloman, who informed-Acosta, that the State-Attorney’s
Office had charged, and arrested Epstein.** On that:same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach: ‘formally
opened. the case, assigning the casc agent: and, later, a co-casc; agent, to investigate it. Villafafia.,
told Sloman that the FBI agents “are, getting copies ofall of the evidence and ‘we are goiiig to
revicw cverything at [the] EBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her: target date for filing federal.
charges: against Epstein was August 25, 2006. Acosta cmailed Sloman, asking: whether ‘it was
“appropriate to ‘approach [State Attomey Krischer] and give him a heads up re where’ we ‘might.
go?” Sloman replied, “No for fear'that it will be leaked straight to Epstcin.”??

Although Lourie Icarned ofthe case at this point from-Sloman, and eventually took a more
active role in supervising the investigation, ‘Villafafia ‘continucd. to. ‘update, Acosta.and Sloman.
directly on the progress of the case.°” Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach, had.
little involvement. in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her
emails to. Sloman, Menchcl, and Louric: without copying her immediate supervisor. In the
immediate supervisor’s view, however, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the. “authority” for the
case, which the immediate supervisor regarded as. “highly unusual. 31

By late August: 2006, Villafafia,and the FBI had identified several. additional ‘victims and.
obtained “some flight, manifests, telephone: messages, and. cell phone records that, show the
communication. and. travel. in interstate: commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia
reported.to her supervisors that the State Attorncy’s Office would not: provide transcripts from the
state grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chicf Reiter “to convince him to
relinquish, the, evidence: to the FBI.” Villafafia also told. her supervisors that she expected, “a
iumber of fights’? over her document. demands, and that some partiés were refusing to comply’
“after having.contact with Epstein or his. attorneys.”

Villafafia’s reference to anticipated, “fights” and. lack of compliance led Sloman. to ask,
whether she was referring ‘to the victims. Villafana responded that the problems did not involve:
victims, but rather a. former employce of Epstein and sonic. business entities that had objected to
document. demands as overly burdensome. Villafana explained to ‘Sloman and Louri¢ ‘that.some
victims were: “scared. and/or embarrassed.” and ‘some had. been. intimidated by the defense, but
“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken,so far has been, willing'to:tell her’story.” ‘Villafaiia.

ak On the same day; Slonian cmailed-Louric, whoni Villafafia had not‘yet bricfed about the case, noting that:
