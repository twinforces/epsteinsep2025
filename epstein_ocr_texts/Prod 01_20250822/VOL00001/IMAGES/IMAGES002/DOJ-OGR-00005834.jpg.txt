Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document397 Filed 10/29/21 Page 51 of 84

Not so. The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment
and the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged with conspiring to transport and entice minors
for the purpose of sexual abuse. The question at trial will be whether the defendant took steps to
provide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls under the age of 18, knowing that Epstein intended to
have sexual contact with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Victim-3 were part of
that scheme and are highly relevant to demonstrating the existence of the conspiracy and the
defendant’s role in the scheme. That is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s
exploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant is not
charged with an offense under United Kingdom law, and the age of consent in the United Kingdom
is irrelevant. The defendant is also not charged with any substantive offenses with respect to Minor
Victim-3, and thus it makes no difference whether the defendant could have, attempted to, or did
successfully transport Minor Victim-3 in violation of those statutes. !”

In any event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 404(b).'? Testimony regarding the
defendant’s efforts to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex acts with Epstein in
the context of massages establishes that the defendant knew of Epstein’s attraction to minor girls
' Indeed, there is no risk at trial that the jury will convict the defendant based on the testimony of
Minor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has made clear, the jury may not convict the defendant
of the conspiracy offense solely based on Minor Victim-3 due to the statute of limitations. (Gov’t
Opp. at 157-58, 163, Dkt. No. 204). The jury should be appropriately instructed at the conclusion
of the trial.

'3 To the extent this evidence is properly admissible under Rule 404(b) rather than as direct
evidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,
which described theories of 404(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at 165-69, Dkt. No. 204), and this
memorandum, filed five weeks before trial, is more than sufficient notice for the defense.
