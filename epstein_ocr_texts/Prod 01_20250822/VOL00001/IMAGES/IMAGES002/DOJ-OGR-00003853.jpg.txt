The goverfiment’s superficial analysis of a Fed. R. Crim. P. 17:subpoena is neither.
accurate: nor informative. The collection of various cliché phrases. about Rule: 1.7 :subpoenas,
selectively gathered from cases inapplicable here, 1s, unpersuasive, and the ‘Court should.deny
the requested relief because: (1) 'the, government lacks, standing to, interfere with subpocnas.
issued. to the third:party respondents; and.(2) this intrusion is’yct another, attempt to infringe
on Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights to effective assistance of counscl,'a, fair trial, and, duc
process, all in violation of the 5" and.6"" Amendments to the United. States Constitution.

This first: meeting was followed up by additional communications from these: lawyers to the

government: Subsequently; and‘unknown to Ms. Maxwell, the government brokered a deal
