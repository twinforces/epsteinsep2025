into a federal, penitentiary.” The letter’s deadline of August. 1.7, 2007, for acceptance of the
government's offer was intended to, accomniodate Villafafa’s request. that the déadline provide

assistants, do witness interviews, and.take additional. legal. steps to obtain Epstcin’s computers if
Epstein:rejected.-the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered. August 1'7'to be'a firm deadline: “[I]f

letter on. Friday, August.3, 2007, which was his last: day at the USAO before joining a private law
firm.”
