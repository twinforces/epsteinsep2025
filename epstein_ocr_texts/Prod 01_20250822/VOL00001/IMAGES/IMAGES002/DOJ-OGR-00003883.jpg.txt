‘courts hold. the government to'an even, higheristandard than, parties to a.commercial contract.
Feldman, 939 F.3d at.189 (describing “meticulous standards of:performance” to, which
prosecutors are held in-negotiating plea agreements). As. the government acknowledges, at least
three courts have applied the:third-party beneficiary doctrine'to confer'standing on third parties
to enforce immunity provisions in pléa agréements. florida, West, 853 F. Supp. 2d at 1228: E-
Sadig, 133-F, Supp. 2d at 608-09; United States v. CF W Const. Co., 583 F. Supp., 197,203
(D.S.C. 1984), uff'd,'749 F.2d 33 (4" Cir. 1984). ‘The government’s attempt to distinguish these

plea deal.” No. 3:15-CR-0240-B, 2016 WL. 107841, *4.(N/D. Tex. Jan. 11, 20:6). Here;
Epstein. cannot obtain rélief forthe. government’s breach ofthe NPA; riot only is: he deceased, but
he served. the sentence stemming from. his guilty plea, long before his death, paid. millions of,
dollars to:accusers under the NPA’s claims provision, and‘thus would have had no occasion to
enforce the NPA by withdrawing his guilty plea. Nor is.it clear'that-Epstein could have:
withdrawn his plea had the NPA been breached, while he was serving. his. sentence, given-that:the
NPA—unlike a pléa agréemént—was not' submitted to the staté court in which Epstein.entered

his plea.
