Maxwell had sufficient opportunity to review the disclosures or the opportunity to effectively
review and discuss the production with counsel. Clearly, there has been insufficient time to
prepare any additional filings to meet today’s deadline, a concern previously raised with
government counsel and the Court.

Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to file additional/or supplemental motions
in limine in response to the government’s recent disclosure of Jencks Act, Giglio material and
government exhibits, dated October 11, 2021. See 6/2/2021 Order (Dkt. 297) (“In addition, and
as requested by the parties, the parties may bring issues to the Court’s attention that arise after
the deadline for motions in limine if the issues could not have been raised within the deadline set
for in limine motions.”).

Your consideration is greatly appreciated.

Respectfully Submitted,
Jeffrey S. Pagliuca
CC: Counsel of Record (via ECF)
2 In addition, Ms. Maxwell’s counsel provided the government with encrypted hard drives to obviate the need for the
government to encrypt the underlying files. Contrary to the defense’s specific request, the government encrypted the
files themselves necessitating two passcodes—one to open the hard drive and one to open the files—to access the
documents each time we wish to review them. This two-step process has slowed the review process.
