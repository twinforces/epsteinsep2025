Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page. 75 of 348

Villafafia, Menchel, left the mecting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and.
stunned.”

Menchcl told OPR. that he did not recall the July 26, 2007 mecting. Noncthcless, he
strongly disputed Villafana’ s. description of events, asserting that it would. have been. “directly at
leave without discussion, “Acosta told OPR that. he had “decided and ‘endorsed: this resolution at
some point,” but: he did ‘not recall. being aware that Menchel, was going to announce the decision,
at the July'26 mecting; in addition, although. Acosta. did not:recall the circumstances of. Menchel’s
relaying of that decision, he said it “would-have been consistent-with” his decision for Menchel to
do so. Neither Sloman. nor Lourie recalled-the meeting. The ‘FBI casc agent: recalled attending a.
mecting at the USAO in Miami, with her co-case agent, and. supervisors, together with, Villafafia,
Lourie (by: telephone), Menchel, and, Sloman, at. which they discussed how: to proceed ‘with the
Epstein case. According ‘to the case agent, at this mecting the EBI insisted that, Epstein be:
registered for life as.a sexual. offender, and.the:co-case agent advocated. for'waiting until the court
had. ruled on the USAO’s. ability to obtain: Epstcin’s computer equipment.

Regardless of cxactly how Acosta’s decision regarding the two-year term ‘was
communicated, to Villafaha and. the FBI agents, and regardless of who initially proposed the
specific term, ‘the record shows: that Acosta ultimately :made: the ‘decision. to offer Epstcin a
resolution that included.a two-year term of. imprisonment, as he acknowledged. 1

Villafafia asserted. that she was not: consulted. about the specific two-ycar term before the
decision was made.” Villafafia told OPR. that she had: worked. hard-to develop a strong case, and.
none of her:supervisors had identified to her any’ specific:problem with the case that, in, her view,
explained the decision to extend an offer for a two-year sentence. Villafania also told OPR ‘that
Menchel.provided no'explanation for this decision during the July 26,,2007:mccting, and Villafana
did not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.
Villafaita described.the proposal as “random,” and.told OPR, “[WJ]e’re all [sentencing] guidelines
