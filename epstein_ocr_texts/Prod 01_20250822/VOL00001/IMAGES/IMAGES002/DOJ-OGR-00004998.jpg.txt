Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan;

I write: to update the: Court.regarding MDC ongoing interference with attorney-client.
communication, between Ghislaine Maxwell and her counsel.

Since December: 20.19; Midco teleconferences s UVTCS") between. Ms. Maxwell, and her counsel
the exception of when the MDC: ‘placed th the VIG monitor: inside a box with a a screen, which severely
impacted: Ms. ‘Maxwell’s' ability to: see counscl and. documents shown to‘her, That issuc, which, arose on
June 14, 2021, was resolved between defense counsel and the’MDC..

Howéver, on. August 6, 2021, MDE Legal sent counsel an cmail stating that startitig Monday
(August 9')-we could no longer usc defense counsel’s WebEx platform-for the VTCs, and ‘instead had to
use any:of four Zoom. access codes provided bythe MDC. When questioned why the platform.was.
being changed from’ WebEx to Zoom, MDC Legal, stated the VTC platform was. changed due to
complaints made by Ms. Maxwell. Upon: information,and belicf, the:complaints concerned visual
evidence that someone on MDC’s end of the WebEx connection, other'than. Ms. Maxwell, appeared on
the screen as.a VTC, participant called, ““NER/BRO,” adjusted the volume during the VTC, arid:moved
the viewing box used to view documents on.the:screen. During the past several wecks, interruption ‘in.
Ms. Maxwell’s VTC signal and’bandwidth, suggested that: her connection was'split, causing her’VTC.
sessions to,go.in.and out,.and her:screen often,turned grecn,and became: blurry., No other’participants
expericnced such disruption.

When Ms. Maxwell raised these concerns: to various staff members, no: one scemed surprised.
The fact that MDC immediately provided. a, “more secure’ "link: an their words) SuBEcsts there v was some
privileged attorney- -client communication and is placing’ ar an on -going chill on ‘communication between
Ms. Maxwell and.her defense'team.

It is my understanding that the new;:MDC Zoom. platform does not-preclude third. partics who
have the access information to the Zoom “Courtrooms” from interfering (inadvertently or intentionally)
with, Ms. Maxwell’s privileged communication. That concern manifested itself.on August 12" when
