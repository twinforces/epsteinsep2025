Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan;

I write to update the Court regarding MDC ongoing interference with attorney-client
communication between Ghislaine Maxwell and her counsel.

Since December 2019, video teleconferences (“VTCs”) between Ms. Maxwell and her counsel
have been conducted via defense counsel’s WebEx platform. There were no problems with VTCs with
the exception of when the MDC placed the VTC monitor inside a box with a screen, which severely
impacted Ms. Maxwell’s ability to see counsel and documents shown to her. That issue, which arose on
June 14, 2021, was resolved between defense counsel and the MDC.

However, on August 6, 2021, MDC Legal sent counsel an email stating that starting Monday
(August 9") we could no longer use defense counsel’s WebEx platform for the VTCs, and instead had to
use any of four Zoom access codes provided by the MDC. When questioned why the platform was
being changed from WebEx to Zoom, MDC Legal stated the VTC platform was changed due to
complaints made by Ms. Maxwell. Upon information and belief, the complaints concerned visual
evidence that someone on MDC’s end of the WebEx connection, other than Ms. Maxwell, appeared on
the screen as a VTC participant called “NER/BRO,” adjusted the volume during the VTC, and moved
the viewing box used to view documents on the screen. During the past several weeks, interruption in
Ms. Maxwell’s VTC signal and bandwidth suggested that her connection was split, causing her VTC
sessions to go in and out, and her screen often turned green and became blurry. No other participants
experienced such disruption.

When Ms. Maxwell raised these concerns to various staff members, no one seemed surprised.
The fact that MDC immediately provided a “more secure” link (in their words) suggests there was some
type of breach or interference with the attorney-client VTC which impinged upon confidentiality of
privileged attorney-client communication and is placing an on-going chill on communication between
Ms. Maxwell and her defense team.

It is my understanding that the new MDC Zoom platform does not preclude third parties who
have the access information to the Zoom “Courtrooms” from interfering (inadvertently or intentionally)
with Ms. Maxwell’s privileged communication. That concern manifested itself on August 12 when
