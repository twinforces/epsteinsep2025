in question include, among other things, depositions of potential witnesses.' If the defense were
to put these documents at issue at trial, during either the defense case or the cross-examination of
witnesses, the Government reserves its right to use relevant materials from this set for any purpose
permissible under the Rules of Evidence. Likewise, the Government has no objection to the
defense using these materials at trial for any permissible purpose under the Rules of Evidence,
including to cross-examine trial witnesses.

Moreover, the Government notes that, even if these materials were suppressed — which the
Government submits is inappropriate here — the Government would nonetheless have the right to
offer these materials under certain circumstances. For example, it is well established that a
criminal defendant who testifies in her own defense may be impeached with materials that would
otherwise be subject to suppression. United States v. Trzaska, 111 F.3d 1019, 1026 (2d Cir. 1997)
(“The Supreme Court has held that illegally acquired evidence may be used to impeach defendants
who testify in their own defense.”) (citing Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 64-66 (1954)).
As the Supreme Court has explained, the exclusionary rule must be balanced with the truth-seeking
functions of a trial:

It is one thing to say that the Government cannot make an

affirmative use of evidence unlawfully obtained. It is quite another

to say that the defendant can turn the illegal method by which

evidence in the Government’s possession was obtained to his own

advantage, and provide himself with a shield against contradiction

of his untruths. Such an extension of the Weeks doctrine would be

a perversion of the Fourth Amendment.
' The Government further notes that many of the materials in the file in question are duplicates of
materials the Government has obtained through other sources. For example, the file contains
materials that appear to have been obtained from third parties and law enforcement agencies. At
trial, the Government is likely to offer documents it has obtained during its investigation through
other sources, even though those materials happen to be contained in duplicate in the file in
question.
