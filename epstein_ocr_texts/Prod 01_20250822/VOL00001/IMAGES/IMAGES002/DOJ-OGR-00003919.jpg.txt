in, question. include, among. other things, depositions ‘of potential, witnesses. | Ifthe defense were:
to’put these’ documents at, issue at trial, during cither the defense case or the cross-examination of
witnesses, the Government reserves its right to use relévant:materials from this sct for any. purpose:
permissible: under the Rules of Evidence. Likewise, the Government has ‘no objection to the
defense using these materials. at trial for any permissible purpose under ‘the Rules of Evidence,
ineluding to, cross-cxamine ‘trial witnesses.

Morcover, the Government:notes that, even if these materials'‘were suppressed —'which, the
Government submits is inappropriate here = the Government:would. nonctheless, have the right to
offer these matcrials under. certain. circumstances. For example, it is well established that a.
criminal, defendant who testifies ‘in, her own defense may be impeached with, materials that would.
otherwise be subject:to suppression. Waited States v.. Trzaska, V1.1 F.3d. 1019, 1026 (2d.Cir. 1997)
(“The Supreme Court-has held that illegally acquired evidence may be:used to.impeach defendants
who testify in, their own defense.”) (citing Walder v. United States, 347 U:S.:62, 64-66 (1954)).
As the:Supremeé Court has éxplained, the exclusionary rule must. be balanced with the truth-secking:
functions ofa trial:

It is one thing ‘to say that the: Government cannot make an
affirmative use of evidence'unlawfully obtained. It is quite another
to. Say ‘that’ the defendant can ‘turn the illegal method by which
evidence inthe Government’s possession ‘was obtained 'to his own
advantage, and ‘provide himself with a. shicld. against contradiction

of his untruths. ‘Such an extension. of the Weeks doctrine would be
a perversion of the Fourth Amendment.

' The Government further‘notes that many’ of the materials inthe file in’ question arc duplicates of
materials the Government: has obtained through other sourecs. For' example, the file contains
materials, that appear to have been obtained ‘from third partics.and law cnforecment agencics. At.
trial, the Government is likely:to offer documents it has: obtained during its investigation through.
other sources, even though those: materials happen. to be: contained. in duplicate in. the file in
question.
