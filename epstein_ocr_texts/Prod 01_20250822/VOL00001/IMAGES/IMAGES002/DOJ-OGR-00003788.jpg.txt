Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document212 Filed 04/16/21 Page14 of 20

But that’s doubtless because that law has been clear for forty-two years that the
government can modify a civil Protective Order and then subpoena confidential material on/y
after notice to the real party in interest and an opportunity to respond. Martindell, 594 F.2d at
294 (Martindell decided in 1979). The proper procedure for modifying a civil Protective Order at
the government’s request, in other words, is the one that affords due process. U.S. CONST.
amend. V.

That no case has addressed the remedy for a Martindell violation is evidence only of (1)
the government’s prior compliance with Martindell (which should, of course, be expected), or
(2) a criminal defendant having not raised the issue before. In this case, however, (1) the
government violated Martindell, and (2) Maxwell seeks suppression as a sanction.

Suppression is the proper remedy for at least two reasons. First, at its heart, Martindell is
grounded in due process principles, and the government’s conduct here violated Maxwell’s right
to due process. See U.S. CONST. amend. V. The essence of due process is notice and an
opportunity to be heard. Martindell guaranteed Maxwell notice and an opportunity to be heard,
594 F.2d at 294, as did the Protective Order, Mot. 3, Ex. A, §] 14. But Maxwell had no idea that
the Giuffre Protective Order had been modified behind her back until she was indicted and the
government disclosed the 90,000 pages of material it obtained from Boies Schiller.? The
government’s due process violation warrants suppression. F.g., Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d 122,
135 (2d Cir. 2001) (suppression for due process violation).

Second, because the government violated Martindell not only by denying Maxwell notice
and an opportunity to be heard, but also by affirmatively misleading Chief Judge McMahon,

* To this day, Judge Preska—who is presiding over the Giuffre action since Judge Sweet’s
passing and is addressing the Protective Order on a daily basis as the parties brief what material should be
unsealed—apparently does not know the Protective Order was modified.
