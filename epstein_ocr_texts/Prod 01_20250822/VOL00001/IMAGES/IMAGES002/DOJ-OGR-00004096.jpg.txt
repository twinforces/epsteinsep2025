First, the defendant has not adequately identified why the diary is relevant beyond the
portions of the diary the defense has already received. See Ulbricht, 858 F.3d at 109 (explaining
that Rule 17(c) is not appropriate for evidence that is “otherwise procurable” (internal quotation
marks omitted)). BSF represents that “all potentially relevant pages were produced from this
journal to the Defendant in civil discovery in another matter.” (3/22/21 Letter from BSF, Dkt. No.
191 at 5). The Government also obtained and produced seven pages of the diary to the defendant
in discovery. (Mot. for a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures, Dkt. No. 148 at 10).

The defendant argues that the entire diary is exculpatory because it contains no reference
to her. (4/2/21 Letter from Def., Dkt. No. 244 at 9). But the Government and Minor Victim-2
have acknowledged the absence of references to the defendant from the start, and Minor Victim-2
is expected to testify to that fact at trial. (See Gov’t Omnibus Response, Dkt. No. 204 at 187 (citing
Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s Renewed Motion for Release, Dkt. No. 100 at 11 n.2.); 3/22/21 Letter from
BSF, Dkt. No. 191 at 5). The defendant earlier moved to compel the Government to obtain and
produce the diary to her, a motion the Court has denied. (Opinion & Order, Dkt. No. 207 at 29).
As the Government explained in its opposition to that motion, the Government understands that
Minor Victim-2 stopped writing in her diary shortly after meeting Jeffrey Epstein, so there are no
entries regarding her later trip with Epstein, during which she met the defendant. (See Gov’t
Omnibus Response, Dkt. No. 204 at 187). The victim provided the Government with her entries
relating to Epstein, which the Government in turn produced to the defense. (/d.). The remainder
of the diary consists of Minor Victim-2’s unrelated personal diary entries, and the defendant has
not explained and cannot explain why she needs to review those entries to establish a fact that the
