photos of [Giuffre] regularly.”? Jd.

o That, as a birthday present, Maxwell gave Epstein a sexually explicit photo of
Giuffre taken when Giuffre was sixteen.’ /d.

o That Epstein hung the photo on one of his walls.* /d.

o That Giuffre has a note in Maxwell’s handwriting with the name of another
victim. Id. at 8.°

o That Giuffre was “live in” sex slave from 2000-2002.° Jd. at 3.

o That there were other victims of Epstein and Maxwell, including yy
ME. i. at 7, who is apparently Accuser-1 in this case, and another woman
whose description matches ME. @. at 9, who is apparently
Accuser-3.

with Giuffre. /d. at 7, 9.

> Maxwell denies ever taking any photos of Giuffre, and we have seen no sexually explicit photo
of Giuffre in any of the civil or criminal document productions.

3 Not only did Maxwell not meet Giuffre until Giuffre was seventeen years old, Maxwell never
provided any such photo to Epstein, nor, to our knowledge, has any such photo ever been produced, in the
civil or criminal cases.

4 Again, we have not seen any such photo produced in any discovery, either in the civil or
criminal cases.

> We are aware of no note in Maxwell’s handwriting being produced in the Giuffre action, or the
criminal discovery.

° Giuffre was in fact living with her fiancé at the time and held multiple other jobs, as later
confirmed through depositions and documents in the Giuffre action.
