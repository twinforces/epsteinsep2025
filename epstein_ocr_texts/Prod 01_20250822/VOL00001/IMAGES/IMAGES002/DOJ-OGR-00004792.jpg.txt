‘inculpatory. lisher,425 U.S. at-410-11. This isno‘such case. The existence of deposition
transcripts in Maxwell’s civil case is ‘not ificulpatory. It is the content of those'transcripts that 'is
at issuc.

In,the face of these straightforward precedents, Maxwell relics primarily on,a single
district court.case, decided the year before the Second Cireuit’s decision in Andover that quashed
a.subpoena. for deposition testimony:covered bya, civil’protective order. See Dkt.’No. 140, at
16=17 (citing United Siaies v.. Oshatz, 700 F.Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. 1988); Dkt. No. 212, at'12=
13.(same). Oshatz docs not suggest.that:theuse of civil deposition-testimony in ‘a. subsequent
criminal trial would violate a defendant’s right against, compelled ‘s¢lf-incrimination—and if it
did, that view would be:plainly inconsistent with the Second Circuit’s later, precedential
opinions. Instead, the case simply describes the standard for whether a ‘court should modify a
protective order to allow .a,government subpoena. ‘Maxwell cites no case in. which, a court has
suppréssed cviderice bécatise another court erred in modifyinig.a protective order. Even. if
Maxwell were right that the protective order'should not have’been modified, it would not
transform her’ earlicr deposition testimony into the product of cocrcion.

The Government would also be entitled to use Maxwell’s deposition testimony against
her in her'perjury trial, notwithstanding any violation of her'right, against compelled self-
‘incrimination. The Supreme: Court has held, that.a defendant may. be prosecuted, for false
statements in. unlawfully compelled testimony. See United States 'v.. Wong, 431 U.S. 174, 179
(1977); Whited States vi Knox, 896 US. 77, 82 (1969). As in. Knox, Maxwell secks'to suppress
her deposition transcripts not'because they are inctlpatory “for a prior or subsequent criminal

act” but because: her statements in those depositions were themselves allegedly criminal. Knox,
