Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 9 of 16

The defamation litigation was legally very complicated and New’ York law afforded
many statutory, common law, and constitutional defenses to: Ms. Maxwell (which: may become
relevant at another time). In addition. to strong legal. defenses: Ms. Maxwell’s defense of truth was
exceptional. It-was clear that-given the wording of Mr. Gow’s statement, proof of falsity of onc
or. more of Giuffre’s claims would be enotigh to defeat the civil action. ‘Very quickly there:were
many ‘provable “obvious lies.”.A few examples:

e Contrary to her claim of “slavery,” Giuffre lived independently from her parerits ‘with her

fiancé long before mecting Epstein or Ms.. Maxwell and.held a number of jobs in 2001

and.2002.

° Giuffre’s employment at the Mar-a-Lago spa began in fall 2000 when she was 17, not 15.
(This falsity was important to: Giuffre’s story for many reasons.)

e Palm Beach-Police investigation.revealed no evidence that Ms.. Maxwell:was inyolved.in:
sexual abuse of minors, scxual trafficking or production. or possession of child
pornography.

© No nude photograph ‘of Giuffre was displayed in Epstein’ s-home..

° Giuffre’s tales about forcign presidents and prime ministers were untrue.

° All. of the famous people Giuffre'claimed to have: been sexually trafficked to denied these
claims, which were completely implausible.

Importantly, Giuffre post-dates, the allegations contained ‘in the superseding ‘indictment
(‘Indictment’) by three years. By her claims,-and admissions, she did not-mect Epstein until.
2000, long after the accusers named. in the Indi¢tment. Her strong:connection with these accusers
developed through her lawyers who likely represent at least'two of the.accusers and. some of the:
witnesses.

Virtually every:issue in the defamation action. was contested. A review of the docket,
unfortunately, reflects over onc-thousand ciitrics. The parties disagreed-about the scope and
meaning of Virtually all of Judge Sweet’s discovery orders, including’those related to Ms.

the words “sexual activity” an “séxual activitics.”
