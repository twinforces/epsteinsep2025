Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:
The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s Order dated
April 16, 2021, which directed the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all remaining pretrial
matters in the above-referenced case. (Dkt. No. 207). Although the parties have agreed upon a
schedule for several pretrial matters, the parties have not reached complete agreement on a full
schedule. Accordingly, the Government is submitting this letter containing its proposal, and
understands that defense counsel will write separately to convey the defense’s competing proposal.
Based on conversations with defense counsel, the Government understands that the parties
agree on the following proposed dates, assuming trial begins as scheduled on July 12, 2021:
e The Government will provide expert notice to the defense by April 23, 2021.
e The defense shall file any additional or supplemental motion briefing in light of the
S2 Indictment by May 7, 2021. The Government shall file its responsive briefing
by May 21, 2021. The defense shall file any reply briefing by May 28, 2021.
e The Government will provide the defense with the identities of the victims
referenced in the S2 Indictment by May 17, 2021.
