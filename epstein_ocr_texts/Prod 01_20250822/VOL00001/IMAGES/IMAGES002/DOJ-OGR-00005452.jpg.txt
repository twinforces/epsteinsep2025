Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 381 Filed 10/29/21 Page2of5
now a month away from trial and any delay receiving her legal mail impedes her ability to adequately
prepare for trial.
Further, Ms. Maxwell is not receiving disclosures sent via Federal Express by the

government in a timely manner. We have requested that within a month of commencement of trial,
government disclosures be hand delivered to the MDC to alleviate delivery delays. The government has
declined this request, again claiming resource issues. There is no assurance that Ms. Maxwell will
receive legal mail — critical to trial preparation — in a timely manner. This is yet another example of how
pretrial detention is encumbering Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial and interfering with her
ability to effectively communicate with counsel. This should undermine the Court’s confidence that Ms.
Maxwell and her attorneys will be fully able to prepare for trial.

Very truly yours,
