Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document211 Filed 04/16/21 Page5of11

The government thus raises only two points of dispute. ‘First, it claims that even though
the offenses in the Superseding Indictment (“Indictment”) are alleged'to have occurred in
Manhattan.(to the extent they-occurred in the Southemn-District.at.all), and even though the:case
has been.assigned:to and, will be tried in. this Court, the appropriate comparison population for
‘purposes of the sécond Dien prong is thé eligible, juror: population ofthe, White, Plains Counties,
rather than-that of either the Manhattan. Counties or the Southern.District as a whole. Second,
the government. argues that;Ms. Maxwell. has not satisfied, the’third Duren prong because any
underrepresentation.was not the result of systematic exclusion, even though the
underrepresentation:is attributable solely to the government’s decision, to indict Ms. Maxwell.
‘using a White Plains grand jury. Both.arguments fail.

I. The Relevant “Community” for Comparison Purposes Is the Manhattan Counties
or, inthe Alternative, the Southern District.of New York.

The ‘second prong of uren asks whether a'group’s ‘representation, im the source from.
which juries are selected is “fair and reasonable in.telation to the number-of such persons. in the
community.” Duren, 439 U.S. at 364. “Although the Duren court did:not clearly detine the term
‘community,’ it is generally accepted that the term refers to the district.or division where'the trial
is to be held.” United States v. Johnson, 21 F.Supp. 2d 329, 334-35 (S.D.N-Y. 1998); see also
United States v» Kenny, 883 F. Supp. 869, 874 (E-.D:N.Y. 1995) (“the:term-refers to the district—
or division, when a district'has been. so. dividéd—where:the trial.is to be held’’)

While the government argues that those cases are inapposite because the grand jury and
petit jury'sat in,the same courthouse, it: cites‘no:case. that: holds, otherwise'where the grand:jury.
and petit. ury. sit in different courthousés—or any other casé that holds that the relévant
“community” for a grand jury:is a community that.exve/udes jurors from the county in:which the

trial is‘to be held (and:in which the offense allegedly occurred). Moreover,.28 U.S.C. § 1861,
