Finally, the defendant requests early disclosure of Rule 404(b) material that the
Government may seek to introduce at trial. (Def. Mot. 10 at 17). As is customary in this district,
the Government will provide notice to the defense of its intent to use any such evidence at least 45
days in advance of trial, which will leave sufficient time for the defense may file any motions in
limine to be considered at the final pretrial conference. See Thompson, 2013 WL 6246489 at *9
(“The Government has represented that it will disclose the substance of [the 404(b) evidence it
intends to introduce at trial] . . . in a timely fashion in order to permit the defendants the opportunity
to challenge admission and to permit the Court to make an appropriate finding. This is all that Rule
404(b) requires.” (alterations in original) (internal citation omitted)); United States v. Tranquillo,
606 F. Supp. 2d 370, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (“The Government has indicated that it will make the
required disclosure two weeks prior to trial, a practice that typically comports with Rule 404(b));
United States v. Fennell, 496 F. Supp. 2d 279, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (“The government has in good
faith noted its obligations under Rule 404(b), and indicated that it intends to provide notice of the
404(b) evidence it intends to introduce two weeks before the beginning of trial. There is therefore
no need to issue the order Defendant seeks.”). Accordingly, this motion should be denied.

On June 29, 2020, amidst a global pandemic that suspended grand juries across the country,
the Government sought and obtained an indictment from a grand jury of the Southern District of
New York (the “Southern District” or “SDNY”) sitting in White Plains. The defendant now
challenges the pool from which that grand jury was drawn, alleging that it does not reflect a “fair-
cross section of the community,” and moves to dismiss the Indictment under the Sixth
Amendment. (Def. Mot. 9 at 1). As set forth below, the defendant’s arguments rely on faulty
