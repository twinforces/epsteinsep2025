One such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual
relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a close friend of Epstein’s
and well-known criminal defense attorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual
relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but
also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition to
being a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other minors, Deshowitz was an eye-witness
to the sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein’s co-conspirators.
Dershowitz would later play a significant role in negotiating the NPA on Epstein’s behalf.
Indeed, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement that provided immunity from federal
prosecution in the Southern District of Florida not only to Epstein, but also to “any potential co-
conspirators of Epstein.” NPA at 5. Thus, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a
provision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for
sexually abusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity would have been controversial if

general public, even though such secrecy violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.

Ghislaine Maxwell was another person in Epstein’s inner circle and a co-conspirator in
Epstein’s sexual abuse. She was someone who consequently also appreciated the immunity
granted by the NPA for the crimes she committed in Florida. In addition to participating in the
sexual abuse of Jane Doe #3 and others, Maxwell also took numerous sexually explicit pictures
