Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 387 Filed 10/29/21 Page 6of21

Accuser-3 were illegal., Indeed, referring to Accuser-3 in the indictment.as “Minor Victim-3” is
entirely misleading — there is ‘76 evidence that she: was a “minor” when any of the alleged. scx
acts took place.

Nevertheless, even. after the, defense‘pointed out-in, our pretrial motions that Aceuser-3
was ot a:minor aiid.had not' alleged any’ illegal conduet, the government.repeated her allegations
verbatim to the grand jury and. in the S2 Superseding. Indictment. This was not only misleading,
it was also an ¢nd-run.around Rule 404(b). Simply including the conduct alleged. by:Accuser-3 in
the :indictment docs: not mean that it:is evidence ofthe charged conspiracies. The conduct
alleged by Accuser-3 isnot within the scope’ of the charged conspiracies and the Court should
not,admit this evidence as-proof of those charges. Nor:should,the Court admit.this evidence as
“other-act” evidence:under,Rule 404(b). This evidence: would only be offered.to show criminal
propensity, despite the alleged conduct being entirely Iegal, and would mislead the jury and,
unfairly*prejudice Ms. Maxwell. Accordingly, the Court should exclude evidence. related to

Accuscr-3.
