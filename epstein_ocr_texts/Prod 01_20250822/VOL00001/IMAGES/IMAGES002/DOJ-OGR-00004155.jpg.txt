Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 285 Filed 05/20/21 Page 20 of 34

I want to make sure I'm not in a Chemical Bank{'>] kind of situation, so I would

like to know about contacts between the United States Attorney's Office and the

Boies Schiller firm prior to the issuance of the subpoena on the subject of your

investigation.
Id. (emphasis added).

“Tellingly,”!® Judge McMahon did not ask AUSA J about the “target” of his
investigation; she asked about its “subject.” The “subject of [the] investigation” is much broader
than its “target.”

“A ‘target’ is a person as to whom the prosecutor or the grand jury has substantial
evidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the
prosecutor, is a putative defendant.”!” “A ‘subject’ of an investigation is a person whose conduct
is within the scope of the grand jury’s investigation.”!* The scope of an investigation, in turn,
includes not only potential defendants and potential victims, but also the conduct at issue and the
locations involved.

Were there any doubt about Judge McMahon’s meaning, she put that doubt to rest in her
written order authorizing the subpoena. Mot. Ex. G, p 21. The “subject of the investigation,” she
explained, was “the matters that were the subject of the Giuffre [defamation] Action.” Jd. And
having asked AUSA J about his office’s contacts with Boies Schiller about “the

'S Chemical Bank v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co., 154 F.R.D. 91 (S.D.N.Y. 1994).

'6 “Tellingly,” claims the government in the Response, “Maxwell omits [the phrase ‘subject of
your investigation’ | of this question from her motion.” Resp. at 70 n.34. Not true. On page 13 of
Maxwell’s Motion, in arguing that AUSA gg mislead Judge McMahon, Maxwell fully and
completely quotes Judge McMahon’s question, just as she does above. Mot. at 13 (quoting Ex. E, p 2).
