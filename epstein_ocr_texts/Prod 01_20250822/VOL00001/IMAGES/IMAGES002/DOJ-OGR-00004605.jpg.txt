Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21. Page 308 of 349

state pleas would resolve ‘the federal investigation, Edwards ‘then filed the CVRA. petition. and,
learned about the NPA: signed months earlier and. that: the ‘federal investigation..of Epstein had.
coneludéd ‘with Epstcin’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA 'when.a judge
permitted. it in. August 2008 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this scrics of
Interactions, it-is not surprising that: Wild came away from. the experience feeling confused. and.
believing she had. been, misled.

OPR. did not find cvidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, ‘Sloman,
Menchel, ‘or Louric: opted not to consult:with the victims: in.order to protect Epstcin. or shield the:
NPA from public scrutiny: Although neither Sloman nor,Acosta could.recall a specific discussion,
of CVRA, obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knowing that. victim. consultation
‘was not required, and .Menchcel also told OPR that consultation was ‘not required, at. least. not-up: to
the point when he left.the USAO. The évidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various ‘points to
consult: with and to notify victims. about the details of the NPA. but was: constrained before: the
NPA was signed by.managers who cither madea decision to not consult victims or did not address
the issue after it, was. raised, and after the signing by her own concern about creating possible
impeachment:-evidence that would: damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.

Nonetheless, a more: open.and straightforward approach with-the victims, both before and
after the signing of the NPA, would have been. the better: practice. Before the NPA was signed,
victims could have been, asked for their views about. the general terms the USAO was
contemplating offering, including that .a plea to state charges was. one of the options being
considered: asked. for’ their views in. general about a. guilty plea; or; ata minimum, asked to share:
their views of how the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to
proceed. with. the NPA, the: government would. have had ‘the benefit of the. victims” thoughts and
‘concerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and. victims would have felt included. in, the
process. OPR. found no evidence that the ‘benefits of victim consultation were discussed. or
considered. before the NPA‘was signed.

After the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the
majority ‘of the: victims: until months later and only after the entry: of Epstein’s guilty plea.
Although the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good, faith belief that.
Epstein. might breach the NPA and a a potential trial ‘would. be harmed if.information about. the: NPA
desire: to shicld the victims from. that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of
the openness and fairness of:the:process. As Wild stated during the CVRA. litigation, she believed.
she had been “mistreated.in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to
avoid creating impeachment evidenec, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear: to have
carefully considered possible alternatives to, or'all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did,
they revisit the: decision before Villafafa met the victims in person. to discuss.a. potential trial or
spoke to Edwards or other.attorneys representing victims. 46 “Furthermore, more attention necded.

“He Itis not at all clear whether a.court would have permitted impeachment of. the victims: ‘concerning one

provision. in, a ‘plea ‘agreement. that otherwise could not. be used as-evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. TIC) (The:
‘admissibility or inadmissibility‘of a‘plea, a‘plea discussion, and any?related statementis governed by Ecderal-Rulciof
Evidence 410°"). ‘In. any case, the victims ‘could. have been. impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining:
monetary damages through ‘either a civil. suit. or through..18'U.S.C. § 2255 (if-Epstein, were convicted ‘after.a trial),
