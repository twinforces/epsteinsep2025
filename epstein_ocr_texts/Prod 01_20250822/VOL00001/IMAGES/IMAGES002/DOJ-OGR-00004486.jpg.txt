and will not agree to’ this.
It is. the intent of this Office:to treat this matter like aiiy.other case.

Acosta told OPR that:this was a polite way. of-chastising Lefkowitz for:mischaracterizing
what Acosta said during the breakfast mecting. Although OPR could, not find, evidenee that ‘the:
letter was sent'to Lefkowitz, OPR nonctheless considers it:persuasive evidence'that: Acosta, shortly
after the. breakfast mecting, disagréed ‘with Lefkowitz’s. description of their discussions aiid had
discussed. those disagreements with. Sloman.

Nevertheless, OPR, examined ‘the three Specific concessions that, Lefkowitz described, in.
the breakfast mecting, First, Lefkowitz claimed that Acosta: agreed during the breakfast’ rioting
that ‘he did not intend ‘to jinterfere with the: state’s handling of the case. Contemporancous
documents show that well before the breakfast meeting, Acosta had expressed the view that‘he did.
not want to “dictate” actions to ‘the: State Attorney or ‘the:state court: ‘For example, during’ the: NPA.
negotiations, Acosta,asked Villafafia'to “soften” certain language that,appcared to'require the State
Attorney’s Office or the staté court’to:take, specific actions, such as.requiring that Epstein enter his
guilty: plea. or report ‘to begin. serving his sentence by a certain date. Although Acosta: may: have:
made a, statement during, the breakfast mecting expressing his disinclination, to interfere with the
state’s proceedings, such a statement would, have been a reiteration of his prior position on, the
‘subject, rather than, any new concession.

Lefkowitz also'claimed in his October 23, 2007 letterthat Acosta agreed not.to'contact any
of the victims ‘or. potential witnesses or their counsel. For the reasons discussed more fully: in.
Chapter Three, OPR concludes that. the decision not:to ‘notify the victims about the NPA, did not.
‘stem, from, the breakfast mecting, but rather reflected, an, assessment of multiple: issucs and,
considerations discussed, internally by the subjects who participated iin that, decision: Acosta,
‘Sloman, and Villafana.

Finally, Lefkowitz’s October 23 letter suggested. that. Acosta had agreed. not.fo intervene
regarding ‘the sentence Epstcin reecived from the state court, and. it asserted that Epstein was
“entitled to any type of sentence available to, him, including, but.not limited to gain time and work’
release.” Later cominitinications between'the, USAO and defense counsel, however, show’ clearly
that Acosta did not. abandon the NBA's expels sentencing provision. The:NPRA, required Epstein.
although ‘the parties understood. that. he would. receive: othe: ‘Same: “gain time” benefits available to
all state inmates. After the October breakfast mecting, Sloman and Villafafia, on. behalf of the
USAO, tepeatedly made Clear that it-would hold Epstein to that requirement, and, the USAO also
subsequently: insisted that Epstcin was incligible for work release. For example, in a.November 5,
2007 letter, Sloman, requested confirmation;from defense counsel that “Epstein , intcnds'to abide by:
his agreement to plead guilty fo the specified. charges ‘and to make’a. binding recommendation that.
the Court ‘impose a, sentence of /8 months of contimious confinement in. the county: jail.” Shortly
before Epstein entered his plea in. June: 2008, Villafafia wrote to the State Attorncy to, remind him
that the NPA required Epstein to plead.in state court. to an offense. that.required an 18-month.
