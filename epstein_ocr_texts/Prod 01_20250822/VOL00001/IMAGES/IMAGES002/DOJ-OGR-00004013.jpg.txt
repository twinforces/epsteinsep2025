Vv. Requests 10 and 11: Boots and Photographs

As to Requests 10 and 11, for boots that Epstein and the Defendant purchased for Annie
Farmer and various photographs, the Defendant complains that “the government has scrupulously
avoided actually obtaining” this evidence. Resp. Ltr. at 11. But, as explained above, Rule 17 is
not a tool that can be used to circumvent discovery disputes with the Government. BSF is a private
entity with no Brady or other constitutional obligations to the Defendant, and a subpoena to BSF
cannot be used to replace discovery appropriately aimed at the Government under Rule 16 or to
avoid resolving discovery disputes with the Government.

In any event, the photographs are not “admittedly relevant” and the Defendant has not
explained how they would be relevant and admissible as trial. Resp. Ltr. at 11. The photographs
do not portray any event described in the indictment. Instead, the photographs depicted in Exhibit
C to the Subpoena that the Defendant seeks are as follows:
