reasoning, Annabi does not apply in these circumstances, nor do subsequent Second Circuit cases
that applied the Annabi rule. See, e.g., United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 118-20 (2d Cir.
1998) (defendant pled guilty in EDNY to using the passport of another person to enter the United
States and later charged in SDNY with related, but distinct terrorism offenses); United States v.
Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 269-70 (2d Cir. 2004) (defendant pled guilty in the District of New
Mexico to drug conspiracy and later charged in the Western District of New York with related,
but distinct weapons possession offense). The Court should not apply them here.

Instead, the Court should follow the Third Circuit’s approach in United States v. Gebbie,
294 F.3d 540 (3™ Cir. 2002), which involved a situation like this one where the charges in the
second prosecution were identical to the dismissed charges. In Gebbie, the defendants were
charged in a multi-count indictment in the Southern District of Ohio charging them with various
offenses related to a scheme to make false statements to the U.S. Postal Service. 294 F.3d at
542. As part of their plea agreement, the defendants pled guilty to misprision of a felony in
exchange for dismissal of the counts in the indictment. /d. at 543. The plea agreement further
provided that the agreement did not protect the defendants from prosecution for “other crimes or
offenses” which “the United States” discovers by independent investigation. /d. at 545-46. A
few months after entering their plea, the defendants were charged in the Western District of
Pennsylvania with “the same crimes and offenses that were at issue” in the Ohio prosecution. /d.
at 546 (emphasis in original). Because the plea agreement barred “the United States” from
prosecuting the defendants for the same crimes covered by the agreement, the question for the
Court was: “who is bound when a plea agreement refers to ‘the United States’ or ‘the
Government’?” /d. In other words, did the use of the term “the United States” in the Ohio plea
