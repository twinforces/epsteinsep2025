same or similar-story, further supports the admissibility of this evidence under the doctrine
of chances.” Id.

The trial Court recognized that the alleged assaults upon the prior bad acts
witnesses were remote in time, but it explained that remoteness “is but one factor'that the
court should consider:” /d. at97. The court reasoned that the distance in time between
the prior acts and the incident involving Constand ‘was “inversely proportional to the
similarity of the other crimes. or acts.” /d. (citing Tyson, 119-A.3d at:359). Stated more
simply, the “more similar ‘the crimes, the less. significant the length of time that has
passed.” /d.at 98 (citing Commonwealth v. Luktisch, 680 A.2d 877 (Pa. Super. 1996)).
The court noted that, while there was a significant temporal gap between the: prior
incidents and Constand’s case, the alleged assaults involving the prior bad acts witnesses
occurred relatively close in time ‘to each other. Thus, “[w]hen taken together,” the court
explained, “the sequential nature of the acts coupled with their néarly identical similarities
renders the lapse of time unimportant.’ Jd. at 109.

To be unfairly prejudicial, the trial court emphasized, the proffered evidence must:
be “unfair,” and must have a “tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis or to
divert the jury's attention away from its duty of weighing the evidence impartially.” /d. at:
100 (quoting Pa.R.E. 403 emt). Evidence “will not be prohibited merely because: it: is
harmful to. the defendant,” and a court “is not required to sanitize the trial to eliminate all
unpleasant facts.” /d. at100-01 (quoting Gommonweaith v. Conte, 198.A.3d 1169, 1180-
81 (Pa. Super. 2018)). For the trial court, the aforementioned similarities between
Constand's claim and that of the other alleged victims weighed in favor of admissibility,
particularly because the’ court believed that the Commonwealth had a “substantial need”

for the evidence. /d: at 109. “Where the parties agreed that the digital penetration

occurred, the evidence of other acts was necessary to rebut [Cosby's] characterization of
