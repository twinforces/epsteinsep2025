‘VI. REVIEW OF JEFFREY MARTIN’S AFFIDAVIT

39. Mr. Martin computes the ‘percent African American on the White Plains qualified jury
the overall Southern District'using the 5-year ACS. J] can reproduce his:calculations. He then
compares the. demographics of the White Plains qualified jury wheel to that of the White. Plains,
‘community, the Manhattan community, and the Southern’District community.

40. He computes the absolute difference between the White Plains qualified jury wheel,
and the White Plains community based'on the 5-year 2018 ACS data, as 1 do.. While I didnot
compare the White Plains qualified, jury. wheel and.the Manhattan, and Southern:District.
community estimates, | do, not:dispute his reported absolute disparities. However; since the.
percent African. American and.Hispanic ‘in. Manhattan and.the: Southern. District are significantly
Jarger than, in White’ Plains, ‘and, the master jury wheel jis designed:to represent/White Plains, by:
design the White Plains master jury’wheel. and herice its qualified jurywheel will be: significantly
demographically: different, 'since'the communities’ demographics are different.

41.. Mr: Martin:properly notes that the master jury wheel was not’a:valid. simple: random
sample, so it does not:properly represent the voter lists from. which-potential.jurors are selected,
due' to what he labels a proration issue (the voters ‘in different, overlapping counties have a
different selection rate that those non-overlapping Countiés) and the fact that ifiactivé voters on
the voter list were: not selected in five counties. He also points out that, in. making the master
jury wheel, there’ was a-clerical error, in;that zip codes were not; included, for individuals who
provided aialternative mailing address when they ‘registeréd‘to voté. The result.of this. error was

presumably: because they ‘never received it. due to the, clerical, error:
