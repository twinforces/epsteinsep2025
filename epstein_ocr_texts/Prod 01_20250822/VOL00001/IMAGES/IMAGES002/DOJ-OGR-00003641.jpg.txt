VI. REVIEW OF JEFFREY MARTIN’S AFFIDAVIT

39. Mr. Martin computes the percent African American on the White Plains qualified jury
wheel and the estimated percent African American and Hispanic in White Plains, Manhattan, and
the overall Southern District using the 5-year ACS. I can reproduce his calculations. He then
compares the demographics of the White Plains qualified jury wheel to that of the White Plains
community, the Manhattan community, and the Southern District community.

40. He computes the absolute difference between the White Plains qualified jury wheel
and the White Plains community based on the 5-year 2018 ACS data, as I do. While I did not
compare the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the Manhattan and Southern District
community estimates, I do not dispute his reported absolute disparities. However, since the
percent African American and Hispanic in Manhattan and the Southern District are significantly
larger than in White Plains, and the master jury wheel is designed to represent White Plains, by
design the White Plains master jury wheel and hence its qualified jury wheel will be significantly
demographically different, since the communities’ demographics are different.

41. Mr. Martin properly notes that the master jury wheel was not a valid simple random
sample, so it does not properly represent the voter lists from which potential jurors are selected,
due to what he labels a proration issue (the voters in different overlapping counties have a
different selection rate than those non-overlapping counties) and the fact that inactive voters on
the voter list were not selected in five counties. He also points out that, in making the master
jury wheel, there was a clerical error in that zip codes were not included for individuals who
provided an alternative mailing address when they registered to vote. The result of this error was
that voters who provided an alternative mailing address never responded to the questionnaire,
presumably because they never received it due to the clerical error.
