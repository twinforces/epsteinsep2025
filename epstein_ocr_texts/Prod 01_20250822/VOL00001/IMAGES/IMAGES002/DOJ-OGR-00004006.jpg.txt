v.. Rajaratnam,753 F.’Supp. 24.317,.320.(S.D.N.Y.201 1) (Rule 17(c) “was not intended to provide
a means of discovery for criminal cases”; rather, “its chicf innovation was to: expedite the trial by,
providing a time: and place: before trial for the inspection of subpocnacd..materials” (emphasis
‘added)). The Defendant, has failed to explain how’ the communications sought.in Requests: |
through 5 will be relevant.and admissible at'trial, and only points to three pending pre-trial.motions.

Second, although BSF cannot fully respond to. the Defendant’s relevance arguments as to
the Defendant’s two motions to suppress because ‘it-has ‘not been ‘provided ‘unredacted versions, of
those motions. and because it has not been-provided.a copy: of the: Defendant’s ex parte motion,"
one: thing is clear—it is not..conccivable: that, every communication, the: Defendant requests in.
‘Requests 1 through 5S would be relevant: and admissible at an. evidentiary. hearing on.her motions.
A defendant must demonstrate that all of the: evidence it: secks ‘pursuant to:a Rule 17 ‘subpoena
would be relevant and admissible, not. just thatthe defendant is likely to find something relevant
and admissible in. the nonparty’s production. See, e.g., United States v. Pena, No. 1S Cr. 55.1.
(AJN), 2016 WL 8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.¥. Feb. 12, 201.6) (“Pena has failed to make the requisite:
showing regarding the admissibility of ‘any. and all’ other records regarding the coopcerators that.
might.exist at the MDC, MCC, or DOC.”).

For example, it is-entirely unclear how communications regarding [—_____] would.
be relevant to any of the Defendants pretrial. motions; her 'two :motions to suppress. relate to

evidence obtained by: the Government by ‘means of.a grand, jury subpoena to. what appears to be

4 If the Court is inclined ‘to grant the Defendants’ motion as to Requests ‘1 through 5; BSF
requests that it first be provided with.an opportunity to. fully respond to, the Defendant’s relevance:
arguments: after being provided with unredacted. versions of the two pretrial motions that. the:
Defendant cites in her response: and a copy of her ex parte’ motion, in. which she presumably:
attempts: to explain the relevance of her Requests. in a more fulsome way than her barebones
response letter.
