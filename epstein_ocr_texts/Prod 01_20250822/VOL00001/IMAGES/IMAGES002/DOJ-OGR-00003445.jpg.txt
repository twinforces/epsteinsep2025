letters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in, stating-that:the matter was
“under investigation” because the government, continued to investigate given, its uncertainty that:
Epstein'would:plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia,contacted the petitioners’ attorncy-prior'to Epstcin’s
State ‘plea. to advisé him of the hearing. ‘Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR ‘that, While there were
valid ‘reasons: for the g governments position that CVRA rights do not.apply: pre-charge, “[T]his:is
a.casc where | felt we should have done: more than ‘what ‘was Icgally: required. Iwas obviously:

preparcd.to:spend.as much time, energy and cffort necessary:to mect:with, cach and:every [victim]:

Over the.-course of' the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the
provisions of the CVRA, ‘including the court’s key’ conclusion. that victim CVRA. rights “attach.
before: the Government: brings formal. charges against a defendant.” The court: also held that:
(1). “the CVRA, authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a.
hon-prosccution.agrcement, reached in violation of a‘prosecutor’s, conferral obligations under the
statute’: (2) the CVRA authorizés the setting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;
(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal
investigations and proceedings”, (4) the: alleged federal Sex’ crimes committed by Epstein render

defensc[s] are: properly left for resolution after development of’ a, full Svidentiary record.”

On February 21, 20.9, the district. court. granted. the petitioners’ Motion. for. Partial
Summary Judgment, ruling that “once:'the Government. failed. to advise the victims about its
intention to enter into the NPA, a-violation. of the: CVRA occurred.” The government did not.
dispute the fact that; it did not confer with the petitioners. prior to signing ‘the NPA, and, the court.
concluded ‘that “[a]t.a bare minimum, the CVRA ‘required, the Government ‘to inform Petitioners
that it intended 'to enter into.an agreement not'to:prosecute Epstein.” The.court found that the post-
NPA letters the government sent to'victims: describing the investigation. as ongoing “misled the
victims to belicye: that federal ‘prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was.a. material
emission for the Government to suggest. to the victims that. they have patience relative: to an,
investigation about'which it had alrcady: bound itself not:to prosecute.”2**

The ‘court relied. on..Dean. and..BP Products to support its holding and. noted that the
government’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a ‘plea.
agreement. for which the victims could voice objection, at.a sentencing hearing, “[o]nccan NPA is
entcred ‘into: without: notice, the matter is closed and the victims, have no opportunity’ to, be heard.
regarding any aspect. of the case.” The court.also highlighted. the inequity of the USAO?s failure
to: communicate with the victims whilc:it.simultancously: engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with.
Epstein’s counsel. and. assured the: defense that: the NPA would. not be “made public or filed with.
the Court.”

Although the USAO: defended, its actions by citing the 2005 Guidelines for the:
Department’ $ position ‘that. CVRA rights do not.attach until after a defendant.is charged, the court.
was “not! persuaded that the © [Guidelines were the basis for the Government’ S decision to withhold.

86 The court: did not :resolve ‘the factual, question, as: to. whether, the victims: were, given adequate notice of.

Epstein’s state court plea hearing.
