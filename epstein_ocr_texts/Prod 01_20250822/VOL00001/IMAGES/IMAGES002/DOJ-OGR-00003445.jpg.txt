Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 269 of 348
letters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in stating that the matter was
“under investigation” because the government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that
Epstein would plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia contacted the petitioners’ attorney prior to Epstein’s
state plea to advise him of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR that, while there were
valid reasons for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply pre-charge, “[T]his is
a case where I felt we should have done more than what was legally required. I was obviously
prepared to spend as much time, energy and effort necessary to meet with each and every [victim].”

Over the course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the
provisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “attach
before the Government brings formal charges against a defendant.” The court also held that
(1) “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a
non-prosecution agreement, reached in violation of a prosecutor’s conferral obligations under the
statute”; (2) the CVRA authorizes the setting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;
(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge state of criminal
investigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged federal sex crimes committed by Epstein render
the Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable
defense[s] are properly left for resolution after development of a full evidentiary record.”

On February 21, 2019, the district court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial
Summary Judgment, ruling that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about its
intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA occurred.” The government did not
dispute the fact that it did not confer with the petitioners prior to signing the NPA, and the court
concluded that “[a]t a bare minimum, the CVRA required the Government to inform Petitioners
that it intended to enter into an agreement not to prosecute Epstein.” The court found that the post-
NPA letters the government sent to victims describing the investigation as ongoing “misled the
victims to believe that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[iJt was a material
omission for the Government to suggest to the victims that they have patience relative to an
investigation about which it had already bound itself not to prosecute.”>*°

The court relied on Dean and BP Products to support its holding and noted that the
government’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a plea
agreement for which the victims could voice objection at a sentencing hearing, “[o]nce an NPA is
entered into without notice, the matter is closed and the victims have no opportunity to be heard
regarding any aspect of the case.” The court also highlighted the inequity of the USAO’s failure
to communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with
Epstein’s counsel and assured the defense that the NPA would not be “made public or filed with
the Court.”

Although the USAO defended its actions by citing the 2005 Guidelines for the
Department’s position that CVRA rights do not attach until after a defendant is charged, the court
was “not persuaded that the [G]uidelines were the basis for the Government’s decision to withhold
information about the NPA from the victims.” The court found that the government’s reliance on
386 The court did not resolve the factual question as to whether the victims were given adequate notice of
Epstein’s state court plea hearing.
