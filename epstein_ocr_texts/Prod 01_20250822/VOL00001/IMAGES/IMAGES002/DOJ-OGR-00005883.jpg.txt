THE ASSESSMENT OF GROOMING
Because grooming is a set of common behaviors seen in child sexual offend-
ers (as the previous reviewed literature seems to support this conclusion),
it should be possible to assess behaviors to determine whether they are
indicative that sexual abuse is likely to occur. We have reviewed the pub-
lished literature and have not been able to find any measures that validly
assess grooming behaviors (by any definition of grooming). This greatly
reduces the value of any definition as the practical usefulness of a definition
is seen in its ability to be operationalized in valid measurement processes.
It is important to develop valid measures as it is not ideal for the detection
of grooming to be an entirely post hoc process—that is, only after the abuse
occurs are the gifts seen as inappropriate and thus as part of a grooming
process. The grooming acts should seem at least somewhat inappropriate
at the time they are occurring and thus ideally adults can intervene to stop
future abuse. To resolve this problem, grooming requires a valid definition
and a psychometrically adequate assessment procedure to reduce both the

number of false positives and false negatives.

We are currently developing an assessment device that would aid a clin-
ician in coming to a valid conclusion as to whether an individual’s behaviors
can be considered grooming. As mentioned, an assessment of grooming in
our proposed definition would involve a two-step process: (a) determining
that the adult’s behavior is inappropriate in and of itself, such as if the tickling
is excessive or the bikini gift is not justified by the nature of the relationship;
and (b) reasonably arguing that the function of this inappropriate behavior
is to increase the likelihood of future abusive contact.

What is “inappropriate” admittedly is somewhat of a vague term that
requires judgment because we need to clearly differentiate the behavior
from normal adult-child relationships. However, this judgment requirement
currently exists for other psychological constructs as well. For example,
the diagnosis of a major depressive episode might require that a clinician
judges the client’s guilt as “excessive.” In addition, under our criteria these
judgments of inappropriateness should be explicit (there must be a clear
argument as to why the behavior is inappropriate). Since the argument must
be explicated, others would be able to evaluate it and decide whether it is a
nonproblematic judgment of the behavior.

To illustrate, a male coach buying an eight-year-old girl a bikini would
generally be considered inappropriate, but the act of buying her a pair of
