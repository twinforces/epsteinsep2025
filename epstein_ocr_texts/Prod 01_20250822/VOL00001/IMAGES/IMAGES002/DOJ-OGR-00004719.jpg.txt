Circuit'has explained, the “key issue” for jeopardy attachment is “whether the disposition, of an
individual’s indictment entailed findings of facts on the merits such that the defendant/was placed,
in. genuine jeopardy by the making of such. findings.” United States: v., Dionisio, 503 F:3d 78, 83
(2d Cir. 2007), cert: denied, 129 S. Ct. 158 (2008); see United States v. Vanhoesen, 366 F. App’ x.
264,266-67 (2d Gir. 2010) (summary-order) (“Jeopardy attaches when “there.has been.a fact-based
resolution of'elements of'the offense charged as a.result of'a-process:in which'the defendant risked.
conviction.’” (quoting Dionisio, 503 F.3d at 85)). Traditionally..jcopardy attaches “to the entire
‘indictment as soon as.a jury:is empaneled.” Podde,,105 F.3d.at 816.

In. the context. of pretrial dispositions, it is “essential” for jeopardy attachment that. the
resolution involve: “adjudication. of some facts that. go ‘to ‘the mérits of a charge. against a.
defendant.” Dionisio, 503 F.3d at. 84 (emphasis in original). -For a guilty-plea, jeopardy attaches
to'the offense of conviction. See.Morris v.. Reynolds, 264 F.3d 38, 49 (2d. Cir. 2001) (Given, that:
a, guilty plea is. a ¢onvietion, and that the Double Jeopardy Clause ‘protects against a. second.
prosecution ‘for the same: offense after conviction, the Clause prohibits asecond prosecution for
the same offense following a. guilty plea.” (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). But
‘it generally docs: not attach.to counts‘that are dismissed.simply pursuant:'to “an agreement.be/ween
the parties,” involving no “process that put [the defendant] at any-‘risk of conviction.” Dionisio,
503, F.3d. at 89; sce Annaubi, 771 F.2d at.672. (“[S]ince appellants were never in jeopardy on the:
charges dismissed in the Eastern District, the protection they now seck under the: plea. agreement.
Is, necessarily broader, than ‘that ‘accorded. by the ‘Double Jcopardy Clause:”); United. States vy.
Hernandez, No. 09 Cr. 625 (HB), 2009 WL 3169226, at’ *4 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 1, 2009) (explaining,

Count ‘One pursuant. fo the ‘plea, agreement,” jcopardy’ did not attach to Count:Onc); cf. Evans v:
