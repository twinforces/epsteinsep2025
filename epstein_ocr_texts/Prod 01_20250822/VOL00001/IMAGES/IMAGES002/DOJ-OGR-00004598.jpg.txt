agent and Villafafia consulted with the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer about the
matter, and thereafter stopped notifying the victims about the NPA and their ability to pursue
monetary damages according to its terms.

Villafafia advised Sloman by email of her concerns regarding the potential impeachment
evidence, telling him, “One thing I am concerned about is that, if we [file charges] now, cross-
examination will consist of- ‘and the government told you that if Mr. Epstein is convicted, you are
entitled to a large amount of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in her later CVRA
declaration, Villafafia said that after Epstein’s attorneys “complained that the victims were
receiving an incentive to overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein in order to increase their
damages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional victims could compromise the
witnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on the agreement.” Acosta was aware of these
concerns as he referred to them in an August 2008 email, “[W]e also believed that contacting the
victims would compromise them as potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they
were doing this for the money, and we did not want to discuss liability with them, which was [a]
key part of [the] agree[ment].”

The case agents interviewed victims in October and November 2007, but did not inform
them about the NPA.**! On January 31, 2008, the FBI agents, Villafafia, and the CEOS Trial
Attorney interviewed three victims, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least one
more victim the next day.°? Wild and two others had been contacted by the FBI in the fall of
2007 and may have been informed about the resolution of the federal investigation.

Villafafia told OPR that during the January 31, 2008 interviews, she did not specifically
tell the victims that “there was a signed non-prosecution agreement that had these terms.” She
stated that she would not use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most people don’t understand
what that means.” Instead, with respect to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been
informed by the FBI about the resolution, she stated that “can agreement had been reached where
[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty plea, but it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually
perform . . . [and] now it looks like this may have to be charged . . . and may have to go to trial.”
Villafafia recalled telling some victims that Epstein “was supposed to enter a plea in state court”
that would end the investigation, but she did not recall distinguishing between the “federal
investigation versus a state investigation.” Villafafia told OPR she explained “the case was under
investigation,” she and the agents “were preparing . . . again” to file charges, and they hoped “that
charges would be brought.” An email from Villafafia to Sloman and Acosta during this time period
reflects that she had such discussions with at least one victim interviewed on this date: “The
second girl... was very upset about the 18 month deal she had read about in the paper... .
[S]he would rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time in jail.” Villafafia,
however, did not recall telling all of the victims interviewed at this time of the state plea; rather,
she likely only told those who knew about the resolution from the FBI. In her own 2015 CVRA-
case declaration, Wild stated that she “was not told about any [NPA] or any potential resolution of
wl FBI agents also interviewed victims in March and May of 2008, without prosecutors, and did not inform the
victims of the NPA.
a2 Two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February 1, 2008, but the evidence is unclear as
to whether the interviews occurred.
