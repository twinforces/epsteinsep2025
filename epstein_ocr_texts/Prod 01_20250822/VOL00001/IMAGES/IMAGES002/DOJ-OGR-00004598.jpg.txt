‘evidence, telling: him, “One thing J, am. concerned. about is that, if ‘we [file charges] now, cross-
examination. will, consist of- ‘and'the g government told ‘you that if’ Mr. ‘Epstein, is convicted, you-are
entitled to a large amount; of damages right?’” Explaining the decision in, her later CVRA
declaration, Villafafid, said that after -Epstcin’s attorneys “complained that ‘the victims were
recciving an:incentive to: overstate their involvement with Mr. Epstein. in. order to inercase their
damages claims,” she “concluded that informing additional. victims could compromise the:
witnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged. on theagreement.” Acosta.was aware of these
concerns as, he ‘referred. to them. in.an, August.2008 email, ‘[W]e also believed. that. contacting the
victims Would, Ccompromisé them as ‘potential witnesses. Epstein argued very forcefully that they’
were doing this: for the money, and we did. not-want to discuss: liability with them, which-was [a]

tell the victims that. “there: was a signed non-prosccution agreement that had these terms.” She
stated that she would not-use “terminology” such as “NPA” because “most: people don’t understand,
what that, means.” Instead, with:respect.to the three victims who, , according to’ Villafafia, had been
informed. by the FBI’ about the resolution, ‘she stated, that “an agreement had. been ‘reached where:
[Epstein] was going to be entering a guilty ‘plea, but it doesn’t look’ [like] he intends to actually
perform... . [and] now it looks like this may‘have, to be charged . . . and may have-to go to trial.”
