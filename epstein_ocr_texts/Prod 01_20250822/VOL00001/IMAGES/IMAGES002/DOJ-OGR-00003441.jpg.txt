letter was substantially identical to the previous FBI victim notification letter the FBI had sent to
victims (in 2006, 2007, and 2008) in that it identified each recipient as “a possible victim of a
federal crime” and listed her eight CVRA rights.

The letter did not indicate that Epstein had pled guilty in state court on June 30, 2008, or
that the USAO had resolved its investigation by deferring federal prosecution in favor of the state
plea. Rather, like the previous FBI VNS-generated letter, the letter requested the victims’
“assistance and cooperation while we are investigating the case.”

For each of the two victims residing outside of the United States, Villafafia also drafted a
notification letter concerning the June 30, 2008 plea and the 18 U.S.C. § 2255 process, which were
to be hand delivered along with the FBI’s letters. However, FBI records do not reflect whether
the USAO’s letter was delivered to the two victims.

E. August — September 2008: The Federal Court Orders the USAO to Disclose

the NPA to Victims, and the USAO Sends a Revised Victim Notification Letter

On August 1, 2008, the petitioners in the CVRA litigation filed a motion seeking access to
the NPA. The USAO opposed the motion by relying on the confidentiality portion of the NPA.?”
On August 21, 2008, the court ordered the government to provide the petitioners with a copy of
the NPA subject to a protective order. In addition, the court ordered the government to produce
the NPA to other identified victims upon request:

(d) If any individuals who have been identified by the USAO as
victims of Epstein and/or any attorney(s) for those individuals
request the opportunity to review the [NPA], then the USAO shall
produce the [NPA] to those individuals, so long as those individuals
also agree that they shall not disclose the [NPA] or its terms to any
third party absent further court order, following notice to and an
opportunity for Epstein’s counsel to be heard[.]?”

In September 2008, the USAO sent a revised notification letter to victims, and attorneys
for represented victims, concerning Epstein’s state court guilty plea and his agreement to not
contest liability in victim civil suits brought under 18 U.S.C. § 2255.74 The September letter
appeared to address concerns raised by Epstein attorney Lefkowitz that the government’s earlier
notification letter referenced language concerning 18 U.S.C. § 2255 that the government had
proposed in Acosta’s December 19, 2007 letter to Epstein attorney Sanchez, but that the defense
had not accepted.*” As a result of the defense objection, Villafafia determined that she was
