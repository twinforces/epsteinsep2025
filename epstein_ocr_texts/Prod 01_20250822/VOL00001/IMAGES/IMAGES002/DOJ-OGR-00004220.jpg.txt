consider such a proffer in the context of a motion to strike,’ the proffered testimony, even if
credited, adds nothing to the analysis. By the government’s own admission, Accuser-3 will not

establish that she was transported or enticed to travel for the purpose of engaging in unlawful

original); United States v. Hitt, 249 F.3d 1010, 1016 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (“Adherence to the language of the indictment
is essential because the Fifth Amendment requires that criminal prosecutions be limited to the unique allegations of
the indictments returned by the grand jury.”).
