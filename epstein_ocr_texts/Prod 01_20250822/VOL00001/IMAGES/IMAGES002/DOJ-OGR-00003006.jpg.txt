United States v. Long, 697 F. Supp. 651,657 (S-D:N.Y. 1988)., The defendant has not'made such
a showing. Her speculative assertions simply do not rise to that level.

The defendant first claims she has suffered ‘substantial. prejudice as a result of pre-
indictment:delay duc'to the unavailability of Jeffrey Epstein, Epstcin’s: mother, Michacl Casey (the
alleged agent of Minor Victim-1.), and. Palm Beach Police Department Detective Joseph Recarcy.
‘testified thatthe defendant did not engage in. the criminal. activity:;with which she ‘is charged. (Def.
Mot. 7 at 8). That assertion is speculative at best, and the law:is clear'that “proof of prejudice must.
be definite and not speculative.” Birney, 686 F.2d at 105-06; see also Long, 697 F.’Supp. at.657
(finding that “perceived-prejudice is speculative” where there was “no, way of knowing what [the
unavailable:witness’s] testimony would. have been”). To credit Maxwell’s argument is to assume
that Epstein, after being ‘indicted with. federal, sex ‘trafficking charges, would, have taken the ‘stand,
would. not have.:invoked his..Fifth Amendment rights, and, would. have provided testimony ‘that
‘exculpated Maxwell, which a jury would have credited in the face of contradictory trial evidence.
This is an exercise!'in chain. upon chain of conjecture that. comes ‘nowhere close to mecting the
burden of demonstrating actual prejudice. See Spears, 159 F.3d at..1085 (“[A] defendant must do
more than show that a particular witness is unavailable and.that the witness’ testimony would have
helped. the defense. He must, also, show that. the witness would have testified, withstood, cross-
examination, and that the jury would have found. the witness credible.” (citations omitted)); see
also United States v. Valona, 834 F.2d 1334, 1339 (7th, Cir. 1987) (noting that prejudice analysis
must consider ‘whether the, missing ‘witness. “would have ‘withstood. cross-cxamination,” whether
the jury would. have found. him a.“credible witness,” and whether the testimony, when ‘compared.

‘to other trial evidence “would affect.the trial, outcome” (internal. quotation marks and citations
