Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 186 of 349

State Attorney and the lead state prosecutor on. September 12, 2007, was a niecessary ‘part ‘of the
NPA ‘negotiation process.

Even after the: NRA. was signed, ‘the defense continued. to request meetings and. reviews of
the case, ‘both within, the USAO and by the Department’s Criminal, Division, and the: Deputy
Attorney Gencral. Although limited reviews were granted, during this, period, there was only one:
substantive mecting with Acosta, on December 14, 2007.72” This mecting occurred in licu.of the
meeting Starr'had requestéd of Assistant Attorney General Fisher, most likely bécause the defense
submissions tothe Department’s. ‘Criminal Division. had. raised issues not previously. raised with.
the USAO and the Department determined that.Acosta: should. address those in the first:instanee.°*°
Acosta fold.OPR that he did not:ask for the Department review, but-he alsodid not-want to appear
as if, he) “fear[ed]” ‘that. review. Acosta’s nuanced ‘position, however, was not: clear to the
Department attorneys who ‘responded to Epstcin’s appeals and:who perécived Acosta to be in favor’
of a Department review, rather than mercly'tolerant of it. Notably, though, none of those:mectings
‘or. reviews resulted. in. the USAO: abandoning ‘the NPA, and Epstein gained no substantial
advantage from. his continued, entreaties.

In.sum, in.¢valuating the subjects’ conduct,'OPR considered. the number of meetings, their
purpose, the content of'the discussions, and decisions made afterwards. OPR. cannot say: that the
number of mectings, particularly‘those occurring before the NRA. was signed, was so far outside
the norm—for a high profile case with skilled. defense ‘attorncys—that the quantity of mectings
alone shows 'that:the subjects:were motivated by improper favoritism. In cvaluating the subjects’
conduct; OPR. considered that the mectings were held with different levels of USAO: managers and.
that the explanations. forthe. decisions:to participate inthe meetings reflected reasonable. strategic
goals. Although. OPR. cannot. rule out. the possibility that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie; or
Sloman knew or knew: of the defense attorneys, they may have been willing to mect with, them, it
Js also true‘that:prosccutors routincly:meet with defense attorneys, including those’who are known,
to them and those who are ‘not. Furthermore, meetings are more likely to occur in high profile
cases involving defendants.with the financial resources to hite skilled defense-counsel who request.
mcectings at: the: highest levels:of the USAO and.the Department. Most significantly, OPR. did not
find evidence supporting a conclusion, that the meetings themselves resulted in any substantial
benefit to the defense. At cach, mecting, defense counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,
legal, and policy grounds=to forgo its federal investigation and.to return the matter'to, the state to
proceed. as ‘it.saw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly, OPR did not find.
evidence supporting -a. conclusion ‘that. Acosta, Sloman, Menchcl, Louric, or Villafania met with.
‘defense counsel for the purpose of benefiting Epstein or that the mectings. ‘themselves caused.
Acosta or the other subjects to‘provide improper benefits to‘Epstein.
