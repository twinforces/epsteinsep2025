Ms. Maxwell objects to their‘public re-release for several reasons. As the Second

Circuit explained, “the-privacy interests of innocent third-parties as well ds those of
defendants that may be: harmed by disclosure:. . . should weigh heavily in.a court's balancing
equation jin. determining what portions of motion papers in, question should, remain, scaled, or
should-be redacted.” Mater of New York ‘Limes, 828 F.2d 1.10, 116 (2d Cir. 1987) (emphasis
supplied)." Inthe context of considering whether to unscal, wiretap evidence during a motion,
‘to suppress, the Second. Circuit-cxplained that “[p]roceedings may. be closed and, by. analogy;
documents may. be sealed if ‘specific, on'the record. findings are. made. demonstrating that
‘closure is essential to preserve higher’values and. is ‘narrowly. tailored to:serve that interest.”
