Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 15-cv-7466-LAP, Tr. of Jan. 19, 2021 at 6-7. Ms. Maxwell moved to
suppress use of her deposition testimony, including these quotes, based on the government’s
violations of due process and the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. See Dkt. Nos. 134 & 140.
The quotes at issue only constitute “part of the public record in this case” -- in the Indictment
— because the government circumvented Second Circuit precedent and made material
misrepresentations to Judge McMahon in seeking modification of the Protective Order entered
by Judge Sweet.

Ms. Maxwell objects to their public re-release for several reasons. As the Second
Circuit explained, “the privacy interests of innocent third parties as well as those of
defendants that may be harmed by disclosure . . . should weigh heavily in a court's balancing
equation in determining what portions of motion papers in question should remain sealed or
should be redacted.” Matter of New York Times, 828 F.2d 110, 116 (2d Cir. 1987) (emphasis
supplied).! In the context of considering whether to unseal wiretap evidence during a motion
to suppress, the Second Circuit explained that “[p]roceedings may be closed and, by analogy,
documents may be sealed if ‘specific, on the record findings are made demonstrating that
‘closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.’”
Id. at 116 (quoting Press-Enterprise Co. v. Sup. Ct., 478 U.S. 1, 12 (1986) (“Press-Enterprise
IT”).
fe Miieearafl nari for purposes of this argument that the Omnibus Response and
Exhibit 11 are “judicial documents.” Matter of New York Times, 828 at 115-116 (recognizing
qualified right of public access to papers filed in connection with a motion to suppress).
