in the past. I had. good reason to believe she had information on Ghislaine’s
role in recruiting girls for Epstein. This type of information was becoming
more crucial than ever, because it was..at the center of Virginia’s defamation
lawsuit against Ghislaine Maxwell.

I called every number for Maria that I could find. I had my investigators
call every number that they could find. Finally, Maria called me back and left
me a message saying that she knew I was ‘trying to.reach her. I returned her
call immediately. She started off by telling me that she had spoken with
Vicky Ward from Vanity Fair a long time ago but her experience was not
included in Ward’s story, which ‘was devastating to her, and that she really
didn’t know whether she should talk to me. She had already suffered more
than she could. handle from her experiences with Maxwell and Epstein. She
didn’t know me, and she certainly didn’t trust me.

Maria eventually agreed that she would talk to. me, but only in person. She
gave me her address in Paducah, Kentucky. This. was.a town and region of
the country that I knew nothing about. I told her I would go there and spend.
as long as I needed for her to have the opportunity to tell me everything. By
the end of the phone call we had built a rapport.

Later that month. flew up to meet with her. To get there I had to fly to
Nashville and drive over to Paducah. I stayed in the only hotel that I could
find within ten miles of her house and planned ‘to meet with her the next
morning. By the time I arrived for our meeting, Maria had. hundreds of
photographs sprawled across her floor. She had also dug out her old diaries,
telephone books, and Rolodexes. It looked like she might have spent the
whole night before digging things out of boxes in her closet.

We chatted for only a few minutes before she launched into everything that
she thought I had ‘come to Paducah to hear and see. Unlike other witnesses.

who were cagey‘arid reluctant to share, Maria was grateful that I had:come so
