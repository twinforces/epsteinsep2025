forward, that cither there is this: pre-indictment resolution, or we go ‘forward. with, an, indictment.
99103 ;

The September meeting did not;altcr or shift our’position.

Villafafia told OPR. that after hearing the defense, argument, Acosta reiteratéd. that the
federal interest:in the:case: could. be vindicated only by a:state plea ‘to an offense that required,
sexual, offender registration, resulted. in a two-ycar term, of incarceration, and was subject to the
18, U.S.€. § 2255 process ‘for providing compensation to 'the victims. When defense counsel
objected to'the:registration requirement, Acosta.held.firm, and he ‘also-rejected the defense:proposal
for a sentence of home corifinement. In. a subsequent email. cxchange.'with Criminal..Division.
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sigal. Mandelkcr, who supervised CEOS, Oosterbaan reported
approach Criminal Division, Assistant. Attorney General Alice Fisher to present. that.argument
directly to her.

PROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF IMPRISONMENT IS. REDUCED

Acosta had. dispensed. with ‘the August. 17, 2007 plea deadline specified in Menchel’s
August 3, 2007 letter,:in order to allow the defense to mect with him. After that. mecting, and
although. Villafafia. continued to plan.to file charges.on September 25, no new plea deadline was
established, and.the negotiations continued through most. of September.

The defense used that time to:push the USAO to make concéssions. Because Acosta was
not willing to compromise on the ‘issue of sexual offender registration or providing a means
through which the victims could seck: monetary damages, the negotiations focused.on the:term. of
imprisonment. As the confemporancous emails show, the USAQ did, not hold.to its. position that.
a:two-year term, of imprisonment was “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an,
agreement with the defense on Epstcin’s sentence, the USAO explored possible pleas in cither’
federal or state. court, or both, and Villafana. ‘Spent considerable time. and effort working. with.
defense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In the ‘course of: that
process, the: agreement: was revised to: require that Epstein, accept a sentence of 18 months, with,
the understanding that under the state’s sentencing procedures, he would, likely ‘serve just: 15
months.

A. The Incarceration, Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 20’Months

Shortly after the September 7,'2007 mecting, Epstein. attorney Gerald Lefcourt, who had.
not’been present at the mecting, spoke with both.Acosta and-Louric, and-made:a.new‘counteroffer,
proposing that Epstein serve 15 months in jail, followed. by 1.5 months in‘home confinement. On,
the afternoon of Monday, September 10, 2007, Villafafia emailed Sloman, identifying issues she
wanted to discuss. with him, including her concern that defense. counsel ‘was, pushiig for a.
resolution that would allow Epstein to avoid. incarceration and possibly scxual offender
registration, “Villafafia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “a, reasonable counteroffer in light:
of our starting position of 24 months,” but added that. it was “a ‘really. low sentence.” ‘Villafafia.

JON Sloman. echoed this: point; telling OPR that Starr’s presentation focused. on. the issue ‘of federalism, but the

USA had.already decided'to defer prosecution to the; state:and after the meeting; the USAO ‘continued.on that path.
