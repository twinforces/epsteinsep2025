B. The NPA Does Not. Immunize Maxwell from. Prosecution.

Even ifthe NPA bound this Distriet—which, it does iot—the NPA provides no basis for
dismissing'the‘Indictment. The NPA. doesnot protect’ the defendant for atleast two reasons. First,
‘the text. of the NPA specifically limits the scope of the NPA. to certain. federal. crimes committed
between.2001.and 2007, :and thus:the NPA docs:not apply to the distinct-offenses and time:periods
charged. in the Indictment. Second, the NPA ‘does not protect. the defendant at all, because’ the
mere use of the word “co-conspirator” does not establish that the defendant was among the:class
of persons contemplated. by the agreement, much less that the defendant has standing.to enforce it.

I. The NPA Is Limited to Particular Crimes, Between 2001 and.2007

Contrary to the defendant’s assertions, ‘the. NPA did not provide carte blanche immunity
to Epstcin, or his “co-conspirators.” In fact, the NPA. contains detailed. provisions that limit the
scope of the crimes immunized. in the agreement.

The NPA begins by outlining the: scope of the USAO-SDFL ‘investigation, delineating the
timeframe of the offense conduct under investigation (“from in or around, 2001 through in or
around September’ 2007”), and, listing each and. every statutory offense under investigation. NPA
at 1. The.NPA. does this. for a reason, because these terms are later uscd in. the agreement to sct
the boundaries of immunity: In particular, the agreement provides:

[N]o:prosccution for the offenses sct out, on ‘pages |] and,2 of this
agreement, nor any other offenses: that have been the subject of, the
joint investigation by the Federal Burcau.of Investigation and the
‘United States Attorney’s Office, nor any offenses that arose’ from
‘the. Federal Grand Jury investigation will be: ‘instituted in, this
District, and the charges against Epstcin if any, will be dismissed.

NPA at 2. Thus, the NPA. barred the USAO-SDEL from. prosecuting Epstein for the: specific:
