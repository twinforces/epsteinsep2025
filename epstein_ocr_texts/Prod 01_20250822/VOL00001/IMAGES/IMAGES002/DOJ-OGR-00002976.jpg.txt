B. The NPA Does Not Immunize Maxwell from Prosecution

Even if the NPA bound this District—which it does not—the NPA provides no basis for
dismissing the Indictment. The NPA does not protect the defendant for at least two reasons. First,
the text of the NPA specifically limits the scope of the NPA to certain federal crimes committed
between 2001 and 2007, and thus the NPA does not apply to the distinct offenses and time periods
charged in the Indictment. Second, the NPA does not protect the defendant at all, because the
mere use of the word “co-conspirator” does not establish that the defendant was among the class
of persons contemplated by the agreement, much less that the defendant has standing to enforce it.

1. The NPA Is Limited to Particular Crimes Between 2001 and 2007

to Epstein or his “co-conspirators.” In fact, the NPA contains detailed provisions that limit the
scope of the crimes immunized in the agreement.

The NPA begins by outlining the scope of the USAO-SDFL investigation, delineating the
timeframe of the offense conduct under investigation (“from in or around 2001 through in or
around September 2007”), and listing each and every statutory offense under investigation. NPA
at 1. The NPA does this for a reason, because these terms are later used in the agreement to set
the boundaries of immunity. In particular, the agreement provides:

[N]o prosecution for the offenses set out on pages | and 2 of this
agreement, nor any other offenses that have been the subject of the
joint investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the
United States Attorney’s Office, nor any offenses that arose from
the Federal Grand Jury investigation will be instituted in this
District, and the charges against Epstein if any, will be dismissed.
NPA at 2. Thus, the NPA barred the USAO-SDFL from prosecuting Epstein for the specific
