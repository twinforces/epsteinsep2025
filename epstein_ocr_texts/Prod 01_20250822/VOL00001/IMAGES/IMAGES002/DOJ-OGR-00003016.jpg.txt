(Minor Victim-1 and Minor Victim-3) for the first time. In particular, Minor Victim-1 first agreed
to be interviewed in September 2019, and Minor Victim-3 first agreed to be interviewed in August
2019.7! The Government conducted multiple additional interviews of both victims, as well as
other witnesses, and took additional investigative steps over the next several months before it was
prepared to seek an indictment charging the defendant. Those two victims were critical to the
investigation, as they helped form the basis of the charges in the Indictment, which the Government
sought on June 29, 2020, less than a year after the victims came forward. That period of time—
and, in particular, less than one year between when key victims came forward and the Indictment
was obtained—cannot possibly give rise to a colorable due process violation.” See Cheung Kin
Ping, 555 F.2d at 1072 (finding that “the government is not responsible for a period of delay during
which an important witness is unavailable to it” and describing the delay as the period between the
witness’s cooperation and the date of indictment); United States v. Rubinson, 543 F.2d 951, 961
(2d Cir. 1976) (“If there was any intentional delay in returning the instant indictment, it was due
in significant measure to the refusal of critical witnesses until 1973 to reveal what they knew.”).
Cf Lovasco, 431 U.S. at 796 (“Rather than deviating from elementary standards of fair play and
decency, a prosecutor abides by them if he refuses to seek indictments until he is completely
1 While the Government is proffering these facts for purposes of this Motion, the underlying
information, which is contained in the FBI 302 reports of interviews with the victims, will be
produced to the defense as 3500 material in advance of trial.

2 In this respect, the Government notes that significant aspects of the defendant’s argument rest
on a faulty premise: 7.e., that the Government could have indicted the defendant at any time
between 1994 and 2020, but simply chose not to do so for tactical reasons. As noted above, two
key witnesses who helped give rise to the instant charges did not agree to speak law enforcement
until 2019, facts that significantly undercut the notion that the Government was intentionally
sitting on a criminal case against the defendant for any meaningful period of time. Cf Ex. 3 (OPR
Report) at 81 (“Villafafia told OPR that, apart from the women named in the NPA, the investigation
had not developed evidence of ‘any other potential co-conspirators.’”’); id. at 167 (with respect to
Maxwell, “according to Villafafia, in 2007, they ‘didn’t have any specific evidence against her.’”).
