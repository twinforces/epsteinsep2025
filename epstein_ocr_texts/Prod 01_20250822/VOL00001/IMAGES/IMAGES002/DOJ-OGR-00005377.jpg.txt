Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

We respectfully submit this letter to request a one-week extension until November 3, 2021,
to file the joint proposed jury charge and verdict sheet, which are currently due on October 27,
2021. See 8/27/2021 Order (Dkt. 330). The government consents to this request.

On October 20, 2021, the government provided the defense with its proposed jury charge.
Because of the press of other deadlines in this case—including the motions in limine responses
and replies, and the Rule 412 briefing—the defense requests an additional week to provide its
counterproposals to the government and to submit the final proposed jury charge to the Court.

The government and the defense have met and conferred and agreed that the defense will
send the government a redlined version of the government’s proposed jury charge containing the
defense’s counterproposals by 7:00 p.m. on November 1, 2021. The parties will submit the final
joint proposed request to charge and verdict sheet, with the areas of continued disagreement
shown in redline, on November 3, 2021. We respectfully request that the Court approve this
revised schedule.

Sincerely,
__/s/ Christian Everdell
