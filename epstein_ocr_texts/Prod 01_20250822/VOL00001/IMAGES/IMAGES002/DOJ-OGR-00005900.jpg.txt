‘Forty-five per cent of Canter ct al.’s (1998) sample were; classified as being’ intimate
offenders. Thus, 45% of: the child sex offenders employed an intimate behaviour repertoire
and Sexiial ‘grooming ‘behaviours. This figure is likely to. be Unrepresentative ofthe. child sex
offender Population as a whole. Intimate offenders tend ‘to cause less physical harm to their
‘victims than the other categories of: offenders :and the very nature of the behaviour’ used ‘to
categorize! the intimate offenders implies: that they would. be less likely, to be reported,
identified ‘and. convicted, because these grooming behaviours are"used: to: avoid disclosure and

‘Figures show that cight of 10 sex abuse:victims know-their, abuser (Stop it Now, 2003). In
such cases, offenders have substantial.interest‘in preventing disclosure, bécause in the event of

Aetiology of. a ‘motivation to abuse

Before an individual begins:to groom a:child; some;level:of motivation ’to ‘abuse a child needs
to be present. Furthermore, adequate ‘theories’ of. sexual offending ‘should be: able ‘to account.
for thé phenomenon of. sexiial gfoomirng. Until recently there have ‘beén three dominant
theories of:child sexual abuse, namely: ‘Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model (1984);. Marshall and
Barbaree’s Integrated, Theory: (1990); and. Hall ‘and ‘Hirschman’s ‘Quadriparitite Model
(1992). In 2002, Ward. and Siegert proposed ‘a:more comprchensive theory of ‘child sexual
abuse by “knitting together” the strengths. of cach of the above. theories. They propose that
there are five pathways, to sexual offending against, children; hence, the ‘thedry is called The
Pathways Model. ‘This, review shall consider cach of these: only briefly; ‘because; Ward and
colleagues have ‘already ‘provided in-depth reviews ee Ward; 2001, 2002; ‘Ward & Hudson,
2001). Herein, more emphasis will be placed-on.how’ these theories relate to. the phenomenon
of Séxtial grooming:

Marshall and. Barbaree’s Integrated Theory

Marshall ‘and. Barbareée’s. (1990) Integrated Theory of. the aétiology: of: séxual offending:
(proposes that the ‘presénce of vulnerabilities, which dévelop as ‘a restilt. of adverse: carly
developmental experiences, leave offenders unprepared ‘to deal with the. surge of hormones at.
“puberty, and unable to; understand ‘the7emotional world. As a resultant; offenders: satisfy their’
emotional, and sexual needs ‘inappropriately‘in deviant ways. This ‘theory suggests’ that sexual
offending, o¢curs. a8 a Consequence of an individual’s sex and aggression drives becoming’

that:this;need not be the case, as, there; are:many:functions, that. are’close ‘in proximity. but-that
do not affect each other. Furthermore, this theory suggests that sexual offending would. be
aggressive. Therefore, it "it would seem ) that it ‘does not account. for’ the phenomenon. of sexual
grooming, bécaus ‘
