process, the inference that. the defendant ‘urges this Court.to draw—that the Government delayed.
secking an indictment'to gain a ‘tactical advantage and, did so through strategy in the pending civil
litigation—is. both-unsupported by the record.and illogical.

The defendant makes much of the Government having moved to intervene and. stay’ the
procecdings in Doe ¥. Indyke, No. 20 Civ. 484 (JGK), whilé the Government has. not' moved. to
stay Giuffrev. Maxwell. (Def. Mot. 7 at 16-19). She suggests that there is some “sharp contrast”
between, the Government’s actions in the various civil:mattcrs, which.“‘establish a strong inference
that as long.as the government stood to gain a-tactical advantage by.delaying'the indictment .. ., it
would:not move to'intervene.” (/d. at 19), Setting the defendant’s conspiracy’ theories aside, the
civil matters were in Completely different procedural postures, which implicate different concerns
regarding. a. pending criminal. case. The Ginffre v. Maxwell litigation was scttled and. complete
well, before the Government: even, opened. its investigation in. this:case. By contrast, the Doe v-
Indyke casé Was initiated after the ‘Government opened its investigation and remained ongoing,
after the Indictment in,this.case'was filed.” The defendant quotes the Government’s letter to Judge
Freeman:requesting permission to intervene and stay Doe v. Indvke (see:id.), but-omits the portion
of that Ictter in -which the Government explained that, as: far as it was aware, Doe v. Indvke: was

the “lone'case in this ‘District that has ‘not yet, been either resolved. or stayed. at. this point. . . . In.

°3'In particular, Ginffrev. Maxwell Was tesolved in 20/17 and ‘the. determination of what :matctial,
should.:remain. scaled. remains the only: open issue. Accordingly, there: is‘no:more discovery. to be:
conducted. in the Giuffre case and no possible concern, to the Government that, for ‘example, its
trial witnesses in the criminal case ‘might be deposed. in that civil case. In/Doe v. Indyke, on the
other hand, discovery: was just: beginning, and. if discovery: were to have proceeded, multiple
witnesses or-potential witnesses at’the criminal trial would likely have been subjéct to deposition.
‘That concern, among others, raised a significant risk-that procecding with the civil:matter would
adverscly affect the ongoing criminal prosccution against the: defendant. Morcover, the interests
of judicial, economy and the public interest.in enforcement. of the criminal law were served, bya.
stay in the Doe case’ because, the outcome of the criminal, case could resolve disputed issues in the
Doe case. Such concerns are not present in:Giiffre v. Maxwell.
