1. Applicable Law

The Second Circuit has rejected the position that evidence of government charging
decisions is. never admissible by a criminal defendant. Wnitéd States. White, 692 F.3d 235,'246
(2d Cir. 2012) (“We hold ... that the government’s charging decisions may"be proper subjects for
cross-examination. and argument if otherwise admissible.”’). ““Such‘an. all or nothing approach
undermines the longstanding principle that ‘the Constitution,guarantees criminal defendants a
meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.” Jd: (quoting Crane v. Kentucky, 476
U.S. 683, 690 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted)). This is-particularly true when the
evidence “is central to the: defendant’s claim. of innocence.” Jd. (categorical. exclusion of
government: charging decisions “infringe[s] upon.a weighty. interest;of the: accused” and threatens
“the right of the aceused to require the prosecution’s case to survive:the crucible of meaningful
adversarial testing” (internal, citations omitted)).

In determining the admissibility of:such cvidenee, a court must evaluate its “relevance
and probative value.” /d. A court may not exclude evidence of government charging decisions
if itis relevant, admissible, and its probative value satisfies Rule 403. Jd. at 246-48. The
standard for relevance is “very low.” Jd. (quotitig United, States’, Al-Méayvad, 545 F.3d 139,
176 (2d Cir. 2008)). -Evidence is relevant'when “it has any tendency to make a fact more.or less
probable'than it would be without the cvidenec, and,the fact-is of consequence in determining ‘the

action.” Fed.:.R. Evid. 401. Morcover, Rule 403 “favors admissibility.” White, 692 F.3d at 247.
