had ‘waived the right to challenge § 2255 Jiability’ as. to victims ‘who did. not want to, scttle ‘their
claims, and contended that any such-victims “will have:to prove, among x other things, that they-are
victims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, ' ‘Lefkowitz again argued. that. the USAO' should.
not discuss the settlement process with the victims who were to be identified. as cligible for
settlement-under § 2255:

Ms. Villafania proposes that. cither she or:federal agents ‘will speak
with,the [victims] regarding x the settlement proccss, ‘We do.not'think
itis the government’s place to be co-counsel. to the [victims], nor
should the FBI be their: personal investigators. ‘Neither fedcral
agents nor anyone. from your Office should contact the [victims] ‘to
inform them. of the resolution of the case, including appointment of
‘the attorney representative and the scttlement process. .Not only
would that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but
Mr. ‘Epstein also will have no:control,over what is communicated, to
‘the [victims] at this most critical stage. We belicve it is essential
‘that'we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable, communication
‘to the [victims]. We further believe that communications between
‘your Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate
Rule 6(c)(2)(B) of the Federal. ‘Rules of Criminal,Proeedure. The.
‘powers of the federal grand jury should ‘not, cven. in appearance, be
‘utilized to advance the interests of a party to, a civil lawsuit."*’

Lefkowitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these-open issucs ‘with you during our 4:30 call
today.” 138
