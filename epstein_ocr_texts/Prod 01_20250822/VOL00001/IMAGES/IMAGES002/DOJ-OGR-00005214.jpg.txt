persistence” and “confirmation bias” are at work. Belief persistence occurs when an opinion
formed is resistant to change even when proven wrong. Confirmation bias occurs when an
individual forms an opinion early in the decision-making process and then evaluates new
information in a way that supports the earlier decision.' The jury questionnaire is the first
opportunity jurors have to tell the lawyers and the Court what they are thinking and, more
importantly, what influenced them to think that way.

Given the likelihood intense media scrutiny of this trial, it is critical to use both a robust
written jury questionnaire and individual sequestered voir dire to inquire about the extent to
which each potential juror has been exposed to pretrial publicity and to what extent each juror
has formed an opinion of Ms. Maxwell and Epstein

Because there is always the fear that a discussion of pretrial publicity in front of the entire
jury pool will contaminate those few jurors who have not been subjected to the publicity, a jury
questionnaire and individual voir dire in a case such as this is particularly warranted. If the Court
were to engage in public questioning of the venire panel en masse, answers could infect the
entire panel. Alternatively, concerns about a panel member’s unanticipated answer may render
the questions too carefully worded to uncover the problem. Further, questions asked pose privacy
concerns that would require constant side bars. A questionnaire can solve some, but not all, of
these issues.

Individual sequestered voir dire would encourage jurors to answer questions more
completely and more honestly because the jurors would not be influenced by (or influence) the
answers given by fellow jurors or fear embarrassment in giving an honest response. Jurors avoid
the pressure to give “right” or socially acceptable answers in front of a large group or to parrot
