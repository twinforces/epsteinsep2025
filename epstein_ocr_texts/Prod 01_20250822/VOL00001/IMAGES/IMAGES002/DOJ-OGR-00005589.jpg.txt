E.. The Government’s Alleged Motives Are Irrelevant

The defense, claims.it.is proper to cast-aspersions onthe Government’s alleged.motives. for
prosecuting the defendant, and they claim they should be ‘permitted to. advance theories that
Epstein’s death motivated,the“timing of the charges” in this ease. (Def. Opp. at 42). The defense
concédes, that they have not éstablished a vindictive or selective prosecution.claim. (/d.). That is.
because they have no legitimate theory based on the Government’s supposed motives. But the
defense is not permitted to dircet: this argument: to the jury’ simply because they lack’ a basis to
make that. argument to' the Court. (See Gov’t Mot. at 34-35 (“The Second ‘Circuit .has explained
that claims of purported government misconduct, must. be ‘directed. to the court rather than jury.”
(quoting United States ¥. Regan, 1.03 F.3d.1.072, 1082 (2d Cir. 1997)))).

As the Government:said :in its motions, the defense is free to argue that Epstein is guilty
and, the defendant. is innocent. (/d. at 35-36). They ‘are ‘not ‘free, however, to argue that—
ifréspective. of guilt of inhocence—the defendant is being. prosecuted because Epstein is dead.
Certainly, the defense could not make that.argument:absent.any evidence, and no: agent—including
the Florida and New York case. agents=can. offer hearsay’ testimony. about ‘why: they’ think:
prosecutors charged or did not:charge certain. individuals at certain times. And ‘to be clear,, the
agents. would testify that this case was charged promptly after the: Government. was in.a. position

to:prove the defendant’s guilt.
