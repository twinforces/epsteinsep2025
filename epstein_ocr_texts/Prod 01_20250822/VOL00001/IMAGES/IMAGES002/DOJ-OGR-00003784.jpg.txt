B. There is no good faith.

The rebuttal to government’s good faith claim is simple: There can be no good faith
when the government willfully and intentionally misleads the court into authorizing its search.
As the United States Supreme Court held in United States v. Leon,

Suppression . . . remains an appropriate remedy if the magistrate or judge in issuing

a warrant was misled by information in an affidavit that the affiant knew was false

or would have known was false except for his reckless disregard of the truth.

468 U.S. 897, 923 (1984).

Here, as explained in Maxwell’s due process motion to suppress and the reply in support
thereof, the government misled Chief Judge McMahon to modify the Giuffre Protective Order
and authorize the subpoena to Boies Schiller. The good faith doctrine does not apply when the
government acts in objective bad faith.

C. The government’s inevitable discovery doctrine fails.

There are several reasons the government’s inevitable discovery argument fails.

First, the inevitable discovery doctrine is an exception to the Fourth Amendment’s
exclusionary rule. United States v. Stokes, 733 F.3d 438, 442—43 (2d Cir. 2013) (reversing
district court’s denial of motion to suppress, which was based on “the inevitable discovery
doctrine, an exception to the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule”). The doctrine has no
applicability when a court exercises its inherent or supervisory authority to suppress evidence
obtained through deliberate government misconduct. The exercise of that authority is meant to
vindicate the dignity of the Court and to deter improper governmental conduct. See United States
v. Cortina, 630 F.2d 1207, 1216 (7th Cir. 1980) (“The need for deterrence of illegal conduct is,
in one sense, greater here than [elsewhere], for [the government’s] offense was committed within
the sanctity of the court itself.”).
