Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 307 Filed 06/25/21 Page3of21

Following entry of the protective order, Maxwell testified in two depositions in the civil
case. The parties designated the depositions as confidential under the protective order. Counts
five and six of the S1 superseding indictment in this case (and counts seven and eight of the S2

depositions.

of New York formally opened its investigation into Epstein on November 30, 2018, following a

prosecutors working on the fledgling investigation. There is no indication that she was involved
in the decision to begin the investigation into Epstein in 2018.

About two months later, the Government served a grand jury subpoena on BSF seeking
to obtain documents for its investigation of Epstein. BSF informed the Government that many of
the requested documents fell under the protective order. The Government then applied for an ex
parte order modifying the protective order to allow BSF to comply with the subpoena. The
Government made a second, similar application in connection with a protective order in a
different case.

International Telephone & Telegraph Corp., 594 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979), governed the
Government’s application. Martindell held that a party should not provide documents subject to
