proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of third parties referenced
in the documents. These redactions are thus consistent with similar, tailored redactions permitted
by the Court in this case to protect the privacy interests of third parties. Accordingly, the
Government respectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions.
The Government has conferred with defense counsel and counsel from BSF, both of whom
indicated that they take no position on the Government’s redaction requests.
Respectfully submitted,
AUDREY STRAUSS
