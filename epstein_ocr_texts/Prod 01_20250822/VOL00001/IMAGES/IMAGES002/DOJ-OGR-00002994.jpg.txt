773 F.3d 138, 145 (4th Cir. 2014) (“[A]pplying [an] extended limitations period to claims that
were unexpired at the time of its enactment does not give rise to an impermissible retroactive effect
under Landgraf.”’).

The Second Circuit has considered in three cases whether retroactive statutes of limitation
are permissible under Landgraf. In Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist., the Second
Circuit held that a new statute shortening the filing period for a civil claim applied retroactively.
In reaching that conclusion, the Court noted that “Landgraf and other cases countenance treating
statutes of limitations differently from statutory provisions that affect substantive rights,” because
statutes of limitations regulate secondary, and not primary conduct. Vernon, 49 F.3d. at 890-91.
In In re Enterprise Mortgage Acceptance Co., 391 F.3d 401 (2d Cir. 2004), the Second Circuit
held that applying an extended statute of limitations retroactively created impermissible retroactive
effects. Yet in that case, it was critical to the Court’s analysis that—unlike here—the statute
revived claims that were previously time-barred. /d. at 410 (“In our view, the resurrection of
previously time-barred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect.”’).

In Weingarten, the Second Circuit considered, but did not ultimately reach, the issue of
whether Section 3283 applies retroactively.'® In discussing the second step of Landgraf, the Court
observed: “Courts have routinely recognized a difference between revoking a vested statute of
limitations defense and extending a filing period for live claims.” /d. at 57 (collecting cases).
Moreover, in an opinion by Judge Learned Hand, the Second Circuit explained why extending an
active criminal statute of limitations does not offend any concept of fairness:

Certainly it is one thing to revive a prosecution already dead, and
another to give it a longer lease of life. The question turns upon how
‘© The First Circuit has similarly considered this issue in the context of an ineffective assistance of
counsel claim and declined to reach the issue of whether Section 3283 applies retroactively. United
States v. Miller, 911 F.3d 638, 644 (1st Cir. 2018).
