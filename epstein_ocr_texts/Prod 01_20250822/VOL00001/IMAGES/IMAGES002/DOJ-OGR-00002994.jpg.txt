773 F.3d. 138, 145 (4th Cir. 2014).(“[A]pplying [an] extended. limitations period. to claims that.
were tnexpiréd at'the time of:its enactiient does not give risé to an‘impermissiblé retroactive effect:
under. Landgraf:”).

The Second Circuit has considered. in three, cases: whether retroactive: statutes of limitation,
are permissible under Landgraf. In Vernon ¥. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist. the Second.
Circuit held that a new’ statute: shortening the ‘filing’ period for a, civil claim, applied. retroactively.
In reaching that conclusion, the Court noted that; ““Landgraf'and other cases, countenance treating’
statutes of limitations differently:from statutory: provisions that affect substantive rights,” because
statutes of limitations regulate secondary, and.not primary conduct. Vernon, 49 F.3d. at.890-91.
In Jn re Enterprise. Mortgage Acceptance Co... 391, E.3d,401 (2d Cir. 2004), the Second Circuit.
held:that applying an extended statute:of limitations:rctroactively created impermissible:retroactive
effects. Yet in that case, it was critical to the Court’s. analysis that—unlike here—the statute:
revived. claims that were previously ‘time-barred. /d. at 410 (“In our View, ‘the. resurrection of
previously time-barred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect.”).

In. Weingarien, the Second ‘Circuit considered, but did not ultimately reach, the issue of
whether Section 3283: applics retroactively. 16 Th discussing the second step of Lundgraf, the Court
observed: “Courts have routinely recognized a difference between,revoking a vested. statute of
limitations defense and extending a filing period for live claims.” /d. at 57 (collecting cases).
Moreover, in.an opinion by Judge: Learned. Hand, the: Second. Circuit. explained.why extending an.
active criminal statute of limitations does not:offend,any concept of fairness:

Certainly it is One thing to revive a prosecution alrcady dead, and
another to give it a longer Icase of life. The question.turns upon how

16 The First Circuit. has similarly considered’this issuc in.the:context of an ineffective assistance of
counsel. claim and declined to reach the issuc:of whether Section 3283.applicsretroactively. United
States v. Miller, 9.1, F.3d 638, 644 (1st:Cir. 2018).
