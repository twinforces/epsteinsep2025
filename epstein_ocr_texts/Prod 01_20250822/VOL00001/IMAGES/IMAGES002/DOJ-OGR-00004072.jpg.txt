Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 261 Filed 05/03/21 Page8of9 8
L4N3MAXC Arraignment

1 THE COURT: You may.

2 (Counsel conferring)

3 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I would just note, given the

4 volume, we would certainly make a first production seven weeks
5 out from trial. But as is typical in preparing for trials,

6 especially trials that involve so much material, there may be

7 rolling productions after those seven weeks. And as is typical
8 with trials in this district, it is possible there may be

9 supplemental motions in limine after the date that the parties
10 have proposed for motions in limine in this case.

11 We would absolutely make our best efforts to meet the
12 seven-week deadline as opposed to the six-week deadline, but I
13 did want to be candid with the Court about our estimations of
14 how quickly we'll be able to complete those disclosures

15 thoroughly and carefully.

16 THE COURT: Okay. I mean, I'm likely to adopt the

17 seven weeks, given that, and urge the government to do what it
18 needs to do to be ready for that. And to the extent that there
19 is some additional supplementation that has to be done after
20 that date, we can consider that. But the government's
2l proposing six weeks. I think we're coming to agreement on
22 seven weeks. So, there is a lot to do for everyone, and we'll
23 get it done.
24 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: Counsel, is there anything else I can
