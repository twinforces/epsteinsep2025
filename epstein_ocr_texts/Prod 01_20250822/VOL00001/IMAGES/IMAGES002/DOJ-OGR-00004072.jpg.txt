L4N3MAXC Arraignment

THE COURT: You may.

(Counsel. conferring)

MS. COMEY: Your Honor, I wotild just note, given ‘the
vglume, we would certainly make a first production. seven weeks

out from trial. But as 48 typical in preparing for trials,

especially trials that involve so much material, there may be

rolling productions after 'those seven weéks. And ds is typical

with trials in this district, it is possible there may be

supplemental motions in Jim ine after the date that the pa reiées
have proposed for motions in limine in. this case,

We would absélutély. tiake our best efforts to mest the

seven-week, deadline as opposed to ‘the six-week, deadline, but I
did want to be Candid with the Court about our estimations of
how quickly we'll be able to complete those disclosures
thoroughly and carefully.

THE COURT: Okay. I mean, I'm likely to adopt the

seven weeks, given that, and urge the government to do what it

needs. ‘to do to be wmeady for that. And to 'the extent that there

1s some additional supplementation that has to be doné after
that date, we can consider that. But the government"s
proposing six weeks. I think we're coming to agreemént on
seven weeks. So, there is a lot. to do for everyone, and we'll
get it done.

MS. COMEY: Thank. ‘you, your Honor.

THE COURT: Counsel; is there anything else I can
