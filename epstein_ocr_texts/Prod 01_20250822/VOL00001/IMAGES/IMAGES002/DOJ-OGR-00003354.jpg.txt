his USAO: colleagues viewed Epstein’ S “attemptto exert influence through his choice of counsel as as
“ham-fisted” and “clumsy.”

Sloman: told OPR. that although ‘he: became. aware that Louric was fricnds with Guy Lewis
colleagues and any of. Epstein’s S. attorncys, but that in n any ‘event his attitude roparding cases
involving former colleagues “was that we would give them process, but'we didn’t:pull any: ‘punches
with them.” In Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with. defense counsel, did not.“chanige the
equation” because as AUSAs, he and his: colleagues: were motivated by:what they perccived.to be
best forthe case,

Louric told OPR that hispreexisting.associations with Epstcin’s attorneys “didn’t influence
anything.” Notably, at the outset of the Epstein case, Lourie. sought guidance, from. the USAO’s
Professional. Responsibility: ‘Officer about the propricty of his role as ‘a. supervisor. in. the:
investigation, because of his acquaintance with Lewis and long- time: friendship with, Lewis’s law:

Officer’s adviec’ as an indication. that he was alcrt; to his ethical responsibilitics regarding’
relationships with defense counsel, including avoiding the appearance ofa conflict.of intérest.

Lefkowitz. On.scveral occasions, when directly appealed to by Lefkowitz or Starr, he dirécted.
them to address their communications, to Villafana, Sloman, and other subordinatés. After his
October 12, 2007 breakfast mecting with Lefkowitz, Acosta immediately communicated. with.
Sloman, about, thcir-conversation. In late 2008, when Acosta anticipated. |caving the USAO and.
was considering pursuing employment with Kirkland.& ‘Ellis, he recognized the conflict of interest:
and instructed Sloman. to stop copying him. on .cmails relating to the Epstcin matter: On Acosta’s
behalf, the USAO’s Professional, Responsibility Officer sought and obtained. formal Department.
approval:of Acosta’s recusal from the case based .on the fact that he had “begun to discuss possible
employment” with, Kirkland & Ellis. These actions support Acosta’s assertion. that he was
cognizant of his ethical responsibilities concerning relationships with, defense counscl.?"*
