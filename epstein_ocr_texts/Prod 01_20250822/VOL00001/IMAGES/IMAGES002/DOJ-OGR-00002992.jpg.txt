concerns entirely separate from extending the statute of limitations for live claims, which is what:
Congress did here. Critically—and.as discussed.in. greater detail below—there is no Ex Post Facto
Clause issuc in. this ease, because the statute of limitations for Counts, One through Four had not;

Accepting the defendant’s argument would ‘undermine Congress’s: plain. purpose in.
extending the limitations period. In. 1990, '2003,.and :2006, Congress cxtended—=and ‘ultimately’
abolished—the: statute of limitations to ensure that prosccutors::could seck justice. :for child sex.
abuse victims who come forward or identify their abuscrs after adclay. Applying the 2003 statute

only prospectively subverts that ‘purpose: by exempting all. past. offenders. According ‘to the

'! Moreover, the:fact that Congress considered, but ultimately omitted, retroactivity language:docs
not end the Landgraf ‘inquiry, as the defendant suggests. Indeed, Landgraf itself makes this:clear,

In that case, the statute atissue had a predecessor, which:contained a.rctroactivity provision. That:
version ‘was, vetoed by the President, and the final version of the statute omitted the retroactivity’
provision. As the Supreme Court explained, “[t]he. omission. of ‘the .claborate. retroactivity’
provision. of the:'1990 bill—which was. by no means the: only: source of political controversy over
that Icgislation—is | not:dispositive because it docs not‘tell us precisely where the compromisc ‘was
struck in the 1991 Act.” Landgraf, 51,1 U:S. at 256. Indeed, “i]t [was] entirely possible—indced,

highly probable=that, because it: was ‘unable to resolve the retroactivity issuc ‘with the clarity’ of
the 1990 legislation, Congress viewed ‘the matter as an Open issue to be resolved. by’ the courts”
Id. at 261.

'S “Minor Vietim-1 and Minor Victim-2. were both, younger than 25. in 2003, when. Congress
extended the limitations ‘period. Minor Victim-3 was ‘not, but. this docs not: alfer the inquiry,
because'the Indictment docs not, contain, any counts that ‘relate to Minor Victim-3 alone. Instéad,
she is one of:multiple victims of the conspiracics: charged in Counts One and Three. The inclusion.
‘of the overt acts relating to ‘Minor Victim-3 in. an otherwise: timely conspiracy count does not
render that. count ‘untimely. To the contrary, for conspiracy counts, the Government. is. only
required.to prove that one overtact in-furtherance ofthe: conspiracy occurred within, the limitations
‘period. United States v. Ben Zvi, 242: F.3d 89, 97 (2d Cir: 2001). Thus, the defendant is incorrect:
to assert that the government is “barred” from. prosecuting the defendant for any offense against’
Minor’Victim-3. (Def. Mot..2 at 10, n.3). Instead, there is no:statute.of limitations issuc here so
long: as the jury is properly instructed at:trial that it must find. at least one overt act: within, the:
limitations period—i.c., one overt;act that docs not relate to Minor Victim-3.
