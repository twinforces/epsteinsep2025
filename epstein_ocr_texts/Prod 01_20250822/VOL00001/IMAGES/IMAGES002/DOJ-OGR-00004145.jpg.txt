“ongoing criminal investigation” into Maxwell, and they withheld from discovery 57 separate
documents, invoking the “law enforcement privilege.” Ex. P.’

In late November 2018 and early December 2018—just two months before AUSA
ME filed the ex parte request before Judge McMahon seeking modification of the civil
Protective Order entered by Judge Sweet—AUSA [gg shared with AUSA gg, as
well as one other member of the trial team and the heads of the Public Corruption Unit,
everything she learned from her contacts with Giuffre’s attorneys. Ex. N.

AUSA J gave AUSA J and his colleagues: (1) nine pages of detailed,
hand-written notes from the February 29 meeting; (2) the emails she received from Giuffre’s
attorneys; and (3) all the documents provided to her by Giuffre’s attorneys. Jd. Some of what she
gave AUSA included material Boies Schiller attorneys designated a short time later
as “confidential” under Judge Sweet’s Protective Order, including flight records and Palm Beach
Police Department Records.

AUSA [ took an active role in gathering these materials from AUSA ggg.
Copying AUSA yg. AUSA QR had emailed AUSA ggg on December 5, 2018,
to obtain all the records of the February 29 meeting with Giuffre’s attorneys. /d. at 1. In that
email, AUSA J also asked AUSA J whether, after February 29, she met “again
with [Peter Skinner] or anyone else.” Jd.

’ Two other aspects to the privilege log are notable: (a) In the Giuffre litigation, Boies Schiller
did not produce its emails with the U.S. Attorney’s Office to Maxwell, despite the fact that they were
directly responsive to a Request for Production of Documents Maxwell served just a couple of weeks
after those emails were sent; and (b) Peter Skinner, the Boies Schiller attorney at the AUSA yyy
meeting who also sent emails to AUSA gg after the meeting, Ex. L, is not even listed on the
privilege log, though the log purports to reflect a// email communications about the “ongoing criminal
investigation” that Boies Schiller had tried to initiate just a couple of weeks earlier.
