until aftcr Epstein, completed his sentence, but:that: Krischer would oppose such a.pctition, “if it is
in the ‘agreement.”'”? On November, 16, 2007, ‘the case agents met with Belohlavek and ‘asked if
the State Attorney’s Office would oppose a request. that Epstcin be granted work release.
Belohlavek was noncommittal, and when the agents asked ‘that. she include language in the state’s
plea agreement prohibiting .Epstcin. from. participating ‘in work: release, she responded that she
would. have to discuss the issue with, the State Attorney: rk0 ‘Krischer later told OPR, that: work:
release was “within, the control of the Sheriff's Office, not my office.” ‘The state’s plea agreement.
with Epstein did not,address the issuc’ of work’ release.

The day after Epstein entered | his June 30, 2008 plea, Villafaria and her immediate
Villafana, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and. will be laced on
‘work: release,” -a statement. that; contradicted the information the case agents, had been given by’ a,
jail supervisor the previous November, as well. as statements made by defense attorney Jack
Goldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was. entered, ‘when. he “specifically told
[Villafatia] that [Epstein] would. not get work.:release.” Villafafia alerted, the: Sheriff's Office
official that, although Epstein told the court, during his’ olca proceeding that. he had worked “every,
day” for.a, ‘couple of years” at the “Florida, Science Foundation,” ‘that entity did not even, exist:
until November 2007.""! Morcover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Elorida
Science Fourdation” ‘was the office. of Epstcin’s attorney Jack Goldberger. Villafania and her
supervisor asked. that:the Sheriff's Office: notify the USAO. if Epstein. applied. for work release.

Acosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia, was trying’to ensure that Epstein did not get.
work release, and, he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained. that the USAO
expeeted Epstcin would be “treated just like: everyone else,” but'that, as shown by “our subsequent.
communications with the [S]tate [A]ttorncy’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein. on.work release “was not
what our office envisioned.”

In August 2008, Villafana spoke with defense attorney Black about ensuring Epstéin’s
compliance with the NPA, and raised the issue. of work release. Villafana later téported to. Acosta,
and. Sloman that ‘Black: assured her he ‘had “reminded. the team that . . . 18:months IN JAIL: is:a.
material term of the agrecment.”

The USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October 10,
2008, less.than three-and-a-half months after Epstein. entered, his guilty plea, the Palm, Beach.
Sheriff's Office placed. him .into the work. release: program, permitting him. to leave'the Stockade:
