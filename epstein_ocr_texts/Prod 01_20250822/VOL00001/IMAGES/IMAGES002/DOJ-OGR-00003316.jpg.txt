until after Epstein completed his sentence, but that Krischer would oppose such a petition “if it is
in the agreement.”!”? On November 16, 2007, the case agents met with Belohlavek and asked if
the State Attorney’s Office would oppose a request that Epstein be granted work release.
Belohlavek was noncommittal, and when the agents asked that she include language in the state’s
plea agreement prohibiting Epstein from participating in work release, she responded that she
would have to discuss the issue with the State Attorney.'®° Krischer later told OPR that work
release was “within the control of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” The state’s plea agreement
with Epstein did not address the issue of work release.

The day after Epstein entered his June 30, 2008 plea, Villafafia and her immediate
supervisor met with a Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office official to discuss work release. According to
Villafafia, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and will be placed on
work release,” a statement that contradicted the information the case agents had been given by a
jail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense attorney Jack
Goldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea was entered, when he “specifically told
[Villafafia] that [Epstein] would nor get work release.” Villafafia alerted the Sheriff's Office
official that although Epstein told the court during his plea proceeding that he had worked “every
day” for a “couple of years” at the “Florida Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist
until November 2007.'®! Moreover, the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida
Science Foundation” was the office of Epstein’s attorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia and her
supervisor asked that the Sheriffs Office notify the USAO if Epstein applied for work release.

Acosta told OPR that he was aware Villafafia was trying to ensure that Epstein did not get
work release, and he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained that the USAO
expected Epstein would be “treated just like everyone else,” but that, as shown by “our subsequent
communications with the [S]tate [A]ttorney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein on work release “was not
what our office envisioned.”

In August 2008, Villafafia spoke with defense attorney Black about ensuring Epstein’s
compliance with the NPA, and raised the issue of work release. Villafafia later reported to Acosta
and Sloman that Black assured her he had “reminded the team that . . . 18 months IN JAIL is a
material term of the agreement.”

The USAO never received notice of Epstein’s work release application. On October 10,
2008, less than three-and-a-half months after Epstein entered his guilty plea, the Palm Beach
Sheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permitting him to leave the Stockade
17? According to Sloman, Krischer explained that even without registration Epstein would be “treated” as a “sex
offender” and that “just like any other sex offender, he can petition the court for work release.”
18D In the November 16, 2007 email, on which she copied Acosta, Villafafia also indicated that she was
“reviewing all of the statutes” to determine whether there was any impediment to a state judge granting Epstein work
release. In a subsequent email, the FBI case agents informed Villafafia that they had also spoken with a “jail
supervisor,” who advised them that although Epstein, as a sexual offender, would not qualify for work release, the
judge could nevertheless order him placed on work release if he was sentenced to a year or less of incarceration.

181 During the plea hearing, Epstein told the court he was “President” of the Florida Science Foundation, it had
been in existence for 15 years, and he worked there “every day.” Plea Hearing Transcript at 27-29.
