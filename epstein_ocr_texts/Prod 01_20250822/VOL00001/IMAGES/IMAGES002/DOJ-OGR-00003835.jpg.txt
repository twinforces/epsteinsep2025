The Indictment against Ms. Maxwell registcrs'a 98.on the.opacity chart: Instead of two
alleged “victims,” the indictment here has different categories with three people’ being identified
as “Minor Victims,” even though they'are not minors, Additionally, an unknown number of
unexplained categorics of unidentificd human beings appear in the Indictment: “multiple minor

gitls,” “victims,” “mirior victims,” “minor victims describéd_herein,

some of Epstein’s minor
victims,” and “multiple minor victims.” It is a mystery if the government claims that these
alleged people are the same, part of the alleged crime, or'surplusage: Multiple “among other,
thing” and “means and methods” alleged acts are bandied about in‘the indictment such as:
assisted, facilitated,.contribuicd, recruit, groom, befriend; spending ‘time, bcing present, help, etc:
This Indictment:is subject: to, considerable interpretation and manipulation. Ms. Maxwell. cannot
prepare a defense wiihout knowing who her accusers are and whether they are limited: the
alleged. “Minor Victims” or the restof the universe.

“Second,” thie government télics.on the general proposition that “Courts in the Second
Circuit have consistently: upheld indictments containing a.range of-tiine rather ‘than a specific
date.” Resp. at 154. Again, the cited cases arc casily distinguishable..Kidd involved a date-range
-ending in the year of indictment. Morcover, the quoted gencral. language from Kidd, 386 F. Supp.
3d 364, 369, is incomplete. The'court in Kidd explains the range it'is referring to:by the
following reference: “See United States v. Nersesian, 824 F.2d 1294, 1323 (2d Cir. 1987)
(holding that ‘on or about Juric. 1984’ put a defendant on notice for potential crimes in July: or
carly August of 1984 ‘because the [Government is not:required to prove the cxact date, if'a:date
reasonably near is established’).” Jd. The government fails to include this. language because it is

inapposite to the suggestion that there is anything “routine” about .a date range beginning 27
