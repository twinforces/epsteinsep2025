—~ year after her arrest for allegedly luting victims into Jeffrey Epstein’s underage sex
trafficking trap. sf
Maxwell, 59, walked stiffly into the Manhattan federal courtroom sporting a blue jail
uniform. She had gray roots showing in her shoulder-length black hair. The British
socialite, worth more than $20 million, chatted with her defense attorneys and stared
