interests of the victims who provided those materials to their attorneys, the victims who are
depicted in those photographs, the third parties who are referenced in the journal entries, and the
third parties who are depicted in those photographs. The Government does not seek any redactions
of Exhibit 2 to the Motion. With respect to Exhibits 3 and 4 to the Motion, the Government
respectfully submits that limited redactions are appropriate to protect the privacy interests of
victims who have not identified themselves on the record in this case and of third parties referenced
in the Motion.

Simultaneously with the filing of this letter, the Government is submitting to the Court
under seal its proposed redactions to the Motion, Exhibit 1, Exhibit 3, and Exhibit 4. The
Government’s proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second
Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although the
Motion and Exhibits are judicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the
proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of victims—including
two victims who have not identified themselves on the record in this case and who have not
publicly identified themselves as victims referenced in the Indictment in this case—and third
parties referenced in the documents. The Court has accepted other filings under seal or in redacted
form in this case to protect such privacy interests. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 168, 232, 284, 290). The
Government notes that it does not seek to redact the names and identifying information of
individuals who have previously been mentioned by name without redaction in public filings in
this case. Rather, the Government only seeks to redact the names and identifying information of
victims and third parties who have not previously been referenced in public filings in this case.
Similarly, the Government seeks to redact photographs and documents that have not previously
been filed publicly in this case and which constitute the personal property of victims and third
