Government has acknowledged. ‘In other words, there will be no:dispute attrial that Minor Victim-
2 didnot write about. the defendant in, her diary."

The cases the defendant:cites are inapposite. For instance, in United.States v. Cheung Kin
Ping, 555 F.2d, 1069 (2d.Cir. 1977), the partics Icarned that a cooperating witness kept a diary,
which ‘was largely written. in, Chinese, while the witness was still on cross-cxamination. Jd. at.
1078. The witness turned over-his diary, but aftcr observing that the: “defense was cxamining his
diary, . ... he requested that this not be done.” Jd. While the’partics were discussing how to review
the diary; including for Brady: material, the diary’was returned to the'witness. It was only given to
the defense: for examination after “roughly: five days” in the ‘witness’s possession. Jd. at. 1079.
Accordingly, in that case, a.diary: that had:never been evaluated for Brady. matcrial=or' any other
matcrial—was ‘taken from a. witness in the middle of the witness’s cross-cxamination,, then.
returned. to him for five days. The Second Circuit found that.those events “created.a serious risk,
that significant, material. would. be destroyed, or tampered. with.” Jd. Here, in contrast, the diary
contains. no ‘relevant matcrial—in fact, that is the defendant’s very thesis. See also White: v.
MeKinley, 519 F.3d 806, 814 (8th, Cir. 2008): (explaining, in a § 1983 case, that the plaintiff had.
alleged bad faith by‘stating:that'a law enforcement officer ina child molestation. case. “deliberately
steer[cd] the investigation to benefit his love interest,” in part by “fail[ing] to preserye'the alleged.
victim’s diary:which didnot. corroborate’ the molestation.allegations,” which in turn.“deprived [the
defendant] of his right to:a fair trial, in part, because he could. not. testify about the diary: without.

waiving his right. not. to testify”); United States v. Rios, No. 88 Cr, 186, 1989 WL 9289, at *2

' For similar reasons, the entire diary, full of Minor Vicitm-2’s personal and:unrelated information,
would.not be admissible at,trial. See Nixon, 418 U.S..700 (requiring that a Rule 17(¢) subpoena.
target “admissib[Ic]” evidenec).
