Amendment's self-incrimination clause “is not only a protection against conviction and
prosecution but a:safeguard of conscience and human dignity and freedom of expression
as'well.” Ullmann v. United States, 350. U.S. 422, 445 (1956) (Douglas, J., dissenting).
We recently discussed ‘the centrality of the privilege against compulsory self-
incrimination in the American concept of ordered liberty. in Commonwealth v. Taylor, 230
A.3d 1050 (Pa. 2020). There, we noted that certain rights, such as those enshrined in
the Fifth Amendment, are among those privileges “whose: exercise a State may not
condition by the exaction of a price.” /d. at 1064 (quoting Garrity v. New Jersey, 385:U:S.
493, 500 (1967)). To ensure that these fundamental ‘freedoms are “scrupulously
observed,” we emphasized that “itis the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional
rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon,” id. at 1063-64
(quoting Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 635 (1886)), and that “the Fifth Amendment:
is to be “broad|ly] constru[ed] in favor of the right which it'was intended to secure.” Jd. at
1064 (quoting Counselman v. Hitchcock, 142 U.S. 547, 562 (1892), Boyd, 116 U.S. at
635, and Quinn v.. United Statés, 349 U.S.155, 162 (1955)). We stressed that: “[t]he value
of constitutional privileges is largely destroyed if persons.can be penalized for relying on
them.” /d..at 1064 (quoting Grunewald v: United States, 353 U.S. 391, 425 (1957) (Black,

J., concurring).2°
The right against compulsory self-incrimination accompanies a person wherever
he goes, no matter the legal proceeding in which he participates, unless and until “the

potential exposure to criminal punishment;no longer exists.” Taylor, 230 A.3d at,1065. It,

26 -‘To that end, the application of the privilege against :self-incrimination is not limited
to criminal matters. Its availability “does not turn upon the type of proceeding in which its
protection is invoked, but upon the nature of the statement or admission and the exposure
which it invites.” /d. (quoting Application of Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 49 (1967)). “The privilege
may; for:example, be claimed in a civil or administrative proceeding, if the statement is or
may be inculpatory.” Gault, 387 U.S. at.49.
