Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 212 Filed 04/16/21 Page6of20

Ghislaine Maxwell moves under the Fourth Amendment, Martindell v. Int'l Tel. & Tel.
Corp., 594 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979), and the Fifth Amendment, to suppress all evidence the
government obtained from a grand jury subpoena it issued to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP and to
dismiss Counts Five and Six, which are the fruits of that unlawful subpoena.

Factual Background

The facts relevant to this Motion are described in Maxwell’s Pretrial Motion No. 3 and

the Reply in Support Thereof.
Argument
I. The Government’s violation of the Fourth Amendment requires suppression.

The government does not defend the overbreadth of its subpoena, or even respond to
Maxwell’s argument. Resp. at 82-95. The government also does not deny that the subpoena
effected both a search and a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. /d.

Instead, the government argues that (1) Maxwell has no standing to challenge the
subpoena; (2) the government acted in good faith; and (3) the government inevitably would have
come to possess the 90,000-sum pages of material it obtained from Boies Schiller.

The facts and law belie the government’s claims.

A, Maxwell has standing.

The government’s standing argument boils down to this: Maxwell cannot challenge the
search because the material was in the possession of a third party and Maxwell lacked a
reasonable expectation of privacy. Resp. at 84—86. This argument fails.

Abundant authority holds that when confidential material is in the possession of a third-
party, a defendant has standing to challenge a grand jury subpoena of that material. Matter of
