Factual Background

The facts:relevant to: this Motion are-described in Maxwell’s' Pretrial-Motion No. 3 and

the Reply in Support Thereof.
Argument
I. The Government’s violation of the Fourth Amendment requires suppression.

The governiient doesnot defend’the overbreadth of its subpoena, or ¢ven:tespond to
Maxwell’s argument. Resp. at.82-95. The government also does not deny. that the subpocna,
effected both a scarch and a‘seizure under the.Fourth Amendment. /d:

Instead, the government argues that (1). Maxwell has no standing to challenge the
subpoena; (2) the government acted in good faith; and (3) the government, inevitably. would ‘have
come-to possess the 90,000-sum pages of material it obtained.from Boies Schiller.

The facts'and law belic the: government's claims.

As. Maxwell has standing.

The government’s standing argument boils. down to this: Maxwell cannot challenge the:
search becatise the material was:in the possession of a ‘third party and Maxwell lacked a
reasonable:expectation of privacy. Resp. al 84-86. This argument fails.

Abundant authority holds that when confidential material is in the possession of a third-
party, a defendant has standing to challenge a grand jury subpoena of that material. Master of
