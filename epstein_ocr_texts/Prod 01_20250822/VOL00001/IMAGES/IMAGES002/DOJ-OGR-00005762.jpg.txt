Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document394_ Filed 10/29/21 Page 6of9

the “jury will convict for crimes other than, those charged—or that, uncertain of guilt, it will
convict anyway because a bad person deserves punishment.” See id. at 181 (quoting United
States v..Moccia,'681. F:2d:61, 63 (1st'Cir. 1982) (Breyer, J.)) (discussing propensity evidence).
A rape allegation. is‘also highly emotional and inflammatory, much more so ‘than the
actual, conduet charged :in this case, (sexualized massages). “Evidenec shall be excluded as
unduly prejudicial when, it is ‘more inflammatory than.the charged crime.” United States v.
Midyett, 603, F. Supp. 2d.450, 456 (E.D-N-Y. 2009) (quoting United States v. Livoti, 196 F.3d
322,326 (2d Cir. 1999)); cf? United States v. Abu-Jihaad, 630 F.3d 102,133 (2d Cir. 2010)
(affirming admission of evidence under Rule 403 when it was “no more inflammatory than the
charges alleged:in the indictment”); Wired States.¥. Roldan-Zapdta, 916 F.2d. 795,804 (2d Cir.
1990) (affirming admission. of evidence that “did not involve conduct.any morc: sensational. or

disturbing than,the crimes, with, which [the defendant] was charged’’).

The allegation that Mr. Epstcin.allegedly raped Accuser-l, (or-anyone clse) will also
confuse the issues at trial and mislead the jury. The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein
raped. Accuser=1. And Ms. Maxwell. is not accused of conspiring to entice, or transport-minors
across state lines. so Mr. Epstein could allegedly rape them. Again, the alleged conspiracy in this
case is limited.to securing “sexualized massages” for Mr. Epstein. If jurors hear an allegation
about an alleged rape by Mr. Epstein, that.¢vidence will confuse and misléad them, in addition to
suggesting that they convict Ms. Maxwell.on.an improper-and highly emotional basis. See United
States v. Stein, 521, F. Supp: 24.266, 273. (S.D.N:Y . 2007) (excluding other-act evidenec ina,
conspiracy case under Rule 403 because of the “risk that this evidence’would confuse. the issues,

‘cause'undue delay; and’be used for an-improper purpose”).
