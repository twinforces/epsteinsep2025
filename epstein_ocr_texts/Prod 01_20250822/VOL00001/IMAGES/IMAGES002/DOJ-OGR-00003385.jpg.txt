the defendant faced decades in prison for, sexual, crimes against minors with such an, insignificant:
term of incarceration, and made, numerous other concessions to the defense. As OPR‘has sct forth.
in. substantial detail inthis Report, OPR did. not find cvidence to support allegations that the
prosécutors sought to, benefit Epstein, at the expense of the victims. Instead, ‘the. résult.can more

was involved 'to,a. greater cxtent and made more decisions, than he did in a typical. case. Lourie
told, OPR that.it.was “unusual ‘to have a U.S. Attorney get involved with. this level. of detail.”
Menchel:told. ORR, “I know we would have spoken aboutthis case a lot, okay? And.I’m sure with,
Jeff'as well, and there were conversations --.a mecting, that... had, with. Maric and. Andy as well.”

Acosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as
