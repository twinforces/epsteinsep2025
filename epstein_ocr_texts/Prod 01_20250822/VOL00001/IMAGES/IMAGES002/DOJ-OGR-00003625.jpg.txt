12.97% Hispanic: Thus, the decision to not draw: a proper random sample accounts for 0.68% of.
the absolute disparity between. the actual ‘master jury wheel and a random sample master jury
wheel. for African Americans and 0.82% of:the absolute ‘disparity for,Hispanics.

8. Based.on the geocoding of the master jury wheel, it 1s evident that the percentage of
African. Americans and Hispanics of the actual, White Plains master jury wheel is similar to ‘the:

jury wheel is impacted. by a.clerical error in.transcribing the individual’s mailing address. This
clerical error affected, every county except Westchester. ‘However, the impact of this clerical
error on,the, absolute differérice between the:master jury'wheel and ‘the qualified. jury wheel for
the African American percentage is negligible, and the error actually reduced-the absolute
difference between the’master jury wheel and the qualified jury wheel for African Americans and
Hispanics.

10. In sum, as (i) the voter registration lists and the master jury‘wheel created from these’
lists reasonably. mirror the representation of the community (an absolute disparity equal to orless
than. 1.25%), but (ii) because African.Americans and Hispanics were less likely to respond to the
questionnaire used to determine ifthe potential juror was qualified, and/or (111) because African
Americans and Hispanics who responded Were: less likely'to be ‘found, qualified, and/or

excused, the absolute disparity. between the, White: Plains qualified jury: wheel and. the White,
