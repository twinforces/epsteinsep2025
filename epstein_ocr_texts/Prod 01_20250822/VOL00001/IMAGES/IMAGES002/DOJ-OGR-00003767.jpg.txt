Ghislaine-Maxwell respectfully;submits this Reply:Memorandum.in Support of her
Motion to Dismiss the Superseding Indictment:as Jt Was Obtained. in Violation. of the Sixth
Amendinent (“Motion”).

In. its opposition ““Opp.”) to the Motion, the government:does not dispute that if the
White Plains jury ‘pool is compared to the. eligible juror population of either'the Southern District
of New. York or'the more racially-diverse:counties from which jurors are drawn for the
Marihattan courthouse (the “Manhattan. Counties”!)—the jurors who will also be'weighing the
éviderice. at her trial—Black atid-Hispanic jurors are significantly underrepresented. According
to the government’s own expert: “The:Manhattan and.the Southern, District communities are
significantly more African American and Hispanic’than the White Plains community. Thus, []
the White Plains master jury wheel . . . will not-be representative ofthe: Manhattan or the
Southern District community with respect;to the percent African, American and, Hispanic.” ‘Opp.

Moreover, the government concedes that Black and-Hispanic jurors constitute
“distinctive” groups for purposes of the three-part.analysis prescribed in. Juren v. Missouri, 439

drawn ‘from a:fair cross-section of the community. Opp. 205. And the government does not.
assert that attainment of a fair cross-section.would. have been incompatible with a significant
state interest, as is necessary to overcome’a prima facie showing of a violation. Duren, 439.U.S.

' The government tikes issuc-with Ms. Maxwell's use of the:terms “Manhattan. Division” and “White Plains
Division” in.her opening bricf,,on.the ground that the: Southern District:is:notdivided.into: “divisions” ‘by statute.
Although the Second. Circuit:has‘used:the term “division?:in a.similar:context, see, e.g, Wanited States ve Jackman,
46 F.3d. 1240, 1247 .@d Gir. 1995) (referring:to. “Hartford Division”), Ms. Maxwell will-usethe terms “Manhattan
