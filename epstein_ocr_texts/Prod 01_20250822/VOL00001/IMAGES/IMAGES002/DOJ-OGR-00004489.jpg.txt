Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 192 of 349

With regard to ‘her comment about “avoid[ing] the press,” Villafafia.told-OPR that her goal
was to protect the anonymity of the victims. She:'said ‘that; the case was far: more ‘likely to be
covered. by the Palm Beach press, which had already written articles about: Epstein, than‘in Miami,
and “if [the victims] ‘wanted to attend [the plea, hearing], I wanted, them to be able to go into the
courthouse without their faces being: splashed all over the: newspaper.”

In.cvaluating the emails, OPR reviewed allthe email exchanges between, Villafania, as well
as Sloman and, Acosta, and Lefkowitz and other defense counsel, including the portions redacted
from the ‘publicly released emails (except fora ‘few-to.or ‘from Acosta, copics of which. OPR did
not locate ‘in the USAO records).. OPR ‘also considered. the emails in the broader context of
Villafafia’s ovcrall, conduct during the ‘federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,
as well,as witness and subject interviews, establishes that, Villafatia consistently advocated in favor
of prosecuting Epstein and ‘worked for months, toward. ‘that goal. She repeatedly pressed her:
supervisors for permission to indict Epstein and-made 'numcrous cfforts to expand the scope of the
case. She opposed mectings with. the defense team, and nearly: withdrew. from the case because:
her supervisors agreed. to those mectings. Villafafia objected to the: decision. to resolve the ‘case
through :a. guilty plea. in:state court, and she cngaged ‘in, a lengthy and heated email exchange with
Menchel, about. that subject. ‘When. she was. assigned the: task: of creating’ an, agreement; to effect.
that resolution, Villafafia fought hard during the:cnsuing ‘negotiations to hold the USAO’s position
despite defense counsel’s aggressive tactics.

OPR. also considered, statements of her supervisors regarding her interactions with defense
counsel. Sloman, in'‘particular, told, OPR that reports that Villafafia, “was. soft on Epstein. . .
couldn’t have: been further froni the truth.” ‘Sloman added 'that Villafania “did her best.to implement.
the décisions. that were made. and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie similarlytold OPR ‘that.
‘when he read the district. court’ s February: 2019 opinion, in. the CVRA, litigation and the emails
winds t up taking iton the chin for being so nice to them. ‘When T know the whole: time she was ‘the
one:who wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA'who assisted Villafafia on the investigation
told, OPR “everything that [Villafana] did . . . was, as far as 1 could tell, [ ] completely pro
prosecution.”

Because the emails. in question were publicly disclosed, without context and without other
information showing Villafafia’s consistent cfforts to prosecute Epstein and to assist victims, a.
‘public narrative developed that Villafana colluded, with defense counsel to, benefit Epstein. at the
expense of the victims. After thoroughly reviewing all of the available evidence, OPR finds that.
narrative to be: inaccurate. The USAO’ s and. Villafafia’s. interactions with the victims can be:
criticized, as OPR ‘does in several respects in this Report, but the evidence is clear that-any missteps
Villafafia may fayem made in her interactions with vietins or r their attorneys v were not, made for the
about Epsteitt s victims. Before the NPA: Was. Sioned, ‘she raised to hot supervisors: the is Issué ‘of
consulting. with victims, and after ‘the NPA was Signed, she drafted {etters to notify victims
appear. The draft letters, led, defense counsel to argue: to ‘Department management that Villafaia
and. Sloman committed ‘professional misconduct by: “threaten[ing] to send. a highly improper and
unusual ‘victim notification letter’ to all” of the listed’victims. Given'the-full. context of Villafatia’s
conduct throughout.her tenure on:the case, 'OPR concludes that her explanations for her emails are:
