very scrious offense. Ms. Maxwell. observed three guards going through the Redweld, reading
‘papers and. pages of the ‘notcbook, dividing ‘papers into two:stacks, and,leaving the room with the
papers. The licutcnant took the papers out'of Ms. Maxwell’s sight. Ms. Maxwell asked the
guards: what ‘documents were: being x taken; the guards refused to respond. ‘While Ms. Maxwell
could not'sce with, specificity which documents’were:scized.and removed :to another room, she
does know that, documents contained in the folders and reviewed, by the guards were’ subject to
the ‘protective order, attorney-client:privileged communication, and defense work-product.

Guards: confronted Ms. Maxwell:and stated in‘sum.and substance:

We want vou to know-that what you did was a very-serious infraction. It was so! serious
that.it.is worthy of an-ineident, report and. a. disciplinary. lihas been decided this time you
will FeCceive a eaution..

Intimidation and Humiliation Off-Camera

After the confiscation of herpapers, Ms.. Maxwell requested ‘and, was given‘permission. to
‘use the bathroom. But-unlike! any‘other occasion, the guard. team, leader:stood knee’ to kncee'with
(Ms. Maxwell while.Ms. Maxwell. sat on the commode in the small arca containing one toilet and.
a sink. In addition to denying Ms. Maxwell any. privacy, the guard.confronted her in a:confined
space off-camera. | | |

Although Ms. Maxwell was ultimately. ‘informed. that. she ‘would not.:receive a disciplinary’
infraction for the incident, being falscly accused. of “a very serious offense” and. having a guard
standing over her while. she-used:the commode caused Ms. Maxwell:to feel intimidated and
humiliated.

A.Further Chill on Attorney-Client Communication, Confidentiality,
And Capacity to Prepare for Trial

Being falscly accused of an:infraction, being threatened with. discipline, and-having her
‘Icgal papers confiscated has caused ‘Ms. ‘Maxwell to. feel heightened insecurity under‘the control
of her officious handlers: Further, this, incident:has put a chill on, attorney-client communication
because Ms. Maxwell'no longer feels that she can bring legal materials to legal conferences. At:
the in-person legal conferenee on Sunday, Ms. Maxwell specifically chose not'to. bring
documents that if confiscated and reviewed by MDC staff:would compromise her defense.
‘Documents :scized.on Saturday were given to. Ms. Saffian, but:it'is unknown whether any’ scized.
documents were'retained or copied by the MDC. The-documents returned.to Ms. Saffian, had
been sent as “legal. mail” to. Ms. Maxwell by. other counsel sometime prior to the Saturday. visit
and had:ficver been possessed, by me or Ms. Saffian.

Ms. Maxwell’s:reaction and. concerns are: well-founded. The guards took undue
advantage of her. If they believed. that-counsel had. given ‘documents to Ms. Maxwell for her
retention, they should haye: addressed the issuc in,the‘presence of counsel. The, conduct of which
both Ms. Maxwell and, counsel have been accused did not happen; and the conduct on'the part of
