very serious offense. Ms. Maxwell observed three guards going through the Redweld, reading
papers and pages of the notebook, dividing papers into two stacks, and leaving the room with the
papers. The lieutenant took the papers out of Ms. Maxwell’s sight. Ms. Maxwell asked the
guards what documents were being taken; the guards refused to respond. While Ms. Maxwell
could not see with specificity which documents were seized and removed to another room, she
does know that documents contained in the folders and reviewed by the guards were subject to
the protective order, attorney-client privileged communication, and defense work-product.

Guards confronted Ms. Maxwell and stated in sum and substance:

We want you to know that what you did was a very serious infraction. It was so serious

that it is worthy of an incident report and a disciplinary. It has been decided this time you

will receive a caution.
Intimidation and Humiliation Off-Camera

After the confiscation of her papers, Ms. Maxwell requested and was given permission to
use the bathroom. But unlike any other occasion, the guard team leader stood knee to knee with
Ms. Maxwell while Ms. Maxwell sat on the commode in the small area containing one toilet and
a sink. In addition to denying Ms. Maxwell any privacy, the guard confronted her in a confined
space off-camera.

Although Ms. Maxwell was ultimately informed that she would not receive a disciplinary
infraction for the incident, being falsely accused of “‘a very serious offense” and having a guard
standing over her while she used the commode caused Ms. Maxwell to feel intimidated and
humiliated.

A Further Chill on Attorney-Client Communication, Confidentiality,
And Capacity to Prepare for Trial

Being falsely accused of an infraction, being threatened with discipline, and having her
legal papers confiscated has caused Ms. Maxwell to feel heightened insecurity under the control
of her officious handlers. Further, this incident has put a chill on attorney-client communication
because Ms. Maxwell no longer feels that she can bring legal materials to legal conferences. At
the in-person legal conference on Sunday, Ms. Maxwell specifically chose not to bring
documents that if confiscated and reviewed by MDC staff would compromise her defense.
Documents seized on Saturday were given to Ms. Saffian, but it is unknown whether any seized
documents were retained or copied by the MDC. The documents returned to Ms. Saffian had
been sent as “legal mail” to Ms. Maxwell by other counsel sometime prior to the Saturday visit
and had never been possessed by me or Ms. Saffian.

Ms. Maxwell’s reaction and concerns are well-founded. The guards took undue
advantage of her. If they believed that counsel had given documents to Ms. Maxwell for her
retention, they should have addressed the issue in the presence of counsel. The conduct of which
both Ms. Maxwell and counsel have been accused did not happen; and the conduct on the part of
the guards was reprehensible.
