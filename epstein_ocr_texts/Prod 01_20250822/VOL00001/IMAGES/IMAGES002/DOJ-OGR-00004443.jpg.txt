CHAPTER TWO
PART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS
I. OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

OPR finds professional misconduct when an attorney intentionally violates or acts in
reckless disregard of a known, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule of professional
conduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an attorney has engaged in
professional misconduct, OPR uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to make factual
findings.

An attorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard when the attorney (1) engages
in conduct with the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously
prohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knowing its natural or probable consequence, and that
consequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An attorney acts
in reckless disregard of an obligation or standard when (1) the attorney knows or should know,
based on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of an
obligation or standard; (2) the attorney knows or should know, based on his or her experience and
the unambiguous applicability of the obligation or standard, that the attorney’s conduct involves a
substantial likelihood that he or she will violate, or cause a violation of, the obligation or standard;
and (3) the attorney nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under
all the circumstances. Thus, an attorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when it represents
a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that an objectively reasonable attorney would
observe in the same situation.

If OPR determines that an attorney did not engage in professional misconduct, OPR
determines whether the attorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,
made a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An attorney exercises poor
judgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that
is in marked contrast to the action that the Department may reasonably expect an attorney
exercising good judgment to take. Poor judgment differs from professional misconduct in that an
attorney may act inappropriately and thus exhibit poor judgment even though he or she may not
have violated or acted in reckless disregard of a clear obligation or standard. In addition, an
attorney may exhibit poor judgment even though an obligation or standard at issue is not
sufficiently clear and unambiguous to support a professional misconduct finding. A mistake, on
the other hand, results from an excusable human error despite an attorney’s exercise of reasonable
care under the circumstances.

An attorney who makes a good faith attempt to ascertain the obligations and standards
imposed on the attorney and to comply with them in a given situation does not commit professional
misconduct. Evidence that an attorney made a good faith attempt to ascertain and comply with
the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to, the fact that the attorney
reviewed materials that define or discuss one or more potentially applicable obligations and
standards, consulted with a supervisor or ethics advisor, notified the tribunal or the attorney
representing a party or person with adverse interests of an intended course of conduct, or took
