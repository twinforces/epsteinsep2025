to determine’ the meaning that.a defendant assigns to a:specific question.” Id; see, e.g. United
States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 287, 307 (2d Cir. 2018).

A narrow’ exception. arises when. language in.a question is. so “fundamentally ambiguous”
that .a, Court can conclude, as. a ‘matter of law, that a perjury count cannot stand. Lighic, 782 F.2d,
at 375. A question. is “fundamentally ambiguous” when, “it'is not a phrase with a. meaning about
‘understanding by a questioner and answercr‘unless it. were defined at the time it. were sought and
offered as testimony.” Jd! at 375 (internal quotation-:marks omitted). In such a case, the “answers
associated. with the questions posed. may be insufficient asa matter of law to support the perjury
conviction.” United States \. Markiewicz, 978 E.2d, 786, 808 (2d Cir. 1992) (quoting Lightc, 782
F.2d at 375). For instance, in Lighte, a.case involving post-conviction. appellate:review, the Court.

Farmer, 137 F.3d 1265, 1269 (10th Cir. 1998)). A defendant cannot demonstrate fundamental.
ambiguity simply by showing that. words used in a question are ‘amenable’ to multiple meanings,
or that an answer“‘might generate a number of different. interpretations.” Light@, 782.F.2d at 375;
United States'v. Strohm, 671 F.3d..1173, 1178 (10th. Cir. 2011) (“Simply plumbing a. question. for
post hoe ambiguity will not. defeat ‘a, perjury conviction where, the evidenec demonstrates the:
