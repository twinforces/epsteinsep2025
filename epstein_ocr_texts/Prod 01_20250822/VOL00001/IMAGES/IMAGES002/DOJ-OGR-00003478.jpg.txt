Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 302 of 348

not plead guilty in, October 2007 as the: USAO expccted, it.was a, “very open question” whether
the case. would go to trial, and,Acosta:thought that “‘where there 1s, no legal, requirement[,] [t]here:
has to be discretion to judge how much you can tell the victims, and when.”

Epstcin’s. attorneys’ conduct: during the period between the: signing of the ‘NPA, and,
Epstein’s entry of his state guilty“pleas illustrated the risk:that: Acosta, Sloman, and. Villafafia. all,
identified. As Epstein’s counsel deposed victims related to the state court: criminal, charges and.
civil cases against Epstein, counsel suggested that: the victims were ‘motivated ‘to, testify against:
Epstein. by the government’s promises of financial gain. For éxample, during a February 20, 2008
state deposition. of a‘victim,, defense counsel asked her whether the federal prosccutors or FBI
agents told her'that she was: entitled to:reecive money from Epstein. 35. In her 2017 declaration i in,
the CVRA litigation, Villafafia identified that. line of questioning ‘as a motivating factor in the
government’s decision. to stop notifying the victims ‘about: the potential for 18 U.S.C. § 2255

On June 27, 2008, the Friday before Epstcin’s Monday, June 30, 2008 state court guilty’
plea hearing, Villafafia contacted Edwards to inform him about,that: upcoming hearing. ‘Villafafia.
‘told OPR. she “was not; given authorization to contact’? any: victim’s attorney other than Edwards
about the scheduled state plea hearing. °° In-his 2017 affidavit prepared forthe CVRA litigation,
Edwards ‘stated that ‘Villafafia “gave the impression that.she was caught off-guard herself that.
Epstein. was. pleading guilty or that this event was happening at all.”

Edwards said.in a 2016 court.filing'that Villafafia told him only:that.““Epstein:was pleading
guilty. to, staté solicitation of prostitution. charges involving, other victims—not Mr. Edward’s
clicnits nor any: of the fedcrally-identificd victims.” Villafafia stated. in. her 2017 declaration that
she “never’told Attorney Edwards that the state charges involved. ‘other'victims,” and neither the
state ‘court.charging instrument nor the factual proffer limited the procurement. of prostitution,
charge to ‘a,speeific victim.” Villafafia, told OPR she “strongly encouraged [Edwards] ‘and his
clicnts to attend” the plea hearing but “could not be 'moreex/plicit” because she was:not “authorized.
by the Office to disclose the terms of the NPA.” Jf his 2017 affidavit, Edwards acknowledged
that “Villafafia did cxpress that. this hearing was important, but never. told: me why she: felt that
way.” Edwards claimed that Villafafia’s failure to: inform,him that the ‘ ‘guilty pleas in state court:
would bring an, end to the possibility of federal ‘prosecution pursuant to the plea agreement”
resulted. in his, clients, not attending the hearing. Edwards, himself was out of town and:not able to

BS. As previously-noted, the defense used Florida criminal-procedure to depose potential :federal y, ‘ictims to learn,

information concerning the federal. iny estigation ,cven, though, those individuals ‘were not sinvolyed inthe state
prosecution; For examples ina March 2008 email, Villafafiarinformed her managers that she spoke to. ay ictim who
had received a -subpoena;* ‘issued in connection with:the state criminal, casey which, as, you-know;:doesn’t involve most;
of ‘the: Victims Im;:our, case (including the girl who was subpeenaed)* Villafafia further observed that’ because Epstein,
is “going to plead to;the solicitation.of adults for prostitution.charge [in. state court}; [the-act of.subpocnaing'the victim]
seems to’be a-clear effort to find out about our case through; the state cases

46 Villafafia’s, June 30, 2008 ‘handwritten ‘notes: reflect that, at the time of Epstein’s state. court guilty: plea,

Villafaiia was aware of ‘the identities of a, least five other attorneys srepresenting Epstein’s victims. In, her. written,
response, to: OPR, Villafafia stated, “I sequested permission to make oral. notifications ‘to the victims regarding the
upcoming’ change of plea, but:the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state inv estigator,

and Jeff Sloman asked’PBPD Cc hict, Reiterto-assist.” On Saturday; June 28; 2008, Villataiia emailed Sloman to inform,

himthat PBPD Chief Reiter “is going to:notify victims about the plea: Sloman: replied, * ‘Good.”
