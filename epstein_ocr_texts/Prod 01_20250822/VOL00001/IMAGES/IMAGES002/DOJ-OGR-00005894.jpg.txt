Cioffi (1976) interpreted Freud as using the concept of seduction to refer
only to nonviolent sexual assaults, writing “. . . he duly reported that he had
discovered the specific cause of psychoneurotic disorder: A passive sexual expe-
rience before puberty. In other words, a seduction” (p. 275). Cioffi’s (1976) quo-
tations of Freud in the same article support this interpretation: “Freud later
assigned to his patients in phrases like: ‘hysterics trace back their symptoms to
fictitious traumas’—or patients ‘ascribe their symptoms to passive sexual expe-
riences in early childhood’” (p. 277). Even here, however, what constitutes a
“passive sexual experience” is unclear, as it could mean the offender did not use
violence, that the child did not resist, or that the child was not an active
participant.
Archaic Usage #2: The Child as Seducer
A second archaic usage of “seduction” is to refer to the child’s tempting of the
offender. This is diametrically opposed to our current thinking about child sexual
abuse in its suggestion that it is the child who is at fault, as in these examples:

e “... [A] most striking feature was that these children were distin-
guished as unusually charming and attractive in their outward person-
alities. Thus, it is not remarkable that frequently we considered the
possibility that the child might have been the actual seducer rather
than the one innocently seduced” (Bender & Blau, 1937, p. 514).

e “The majority of pedophiles are harmless individuals and their victims
are usually known to be aggressive and seductive children” (Revitch
& Weiss, 1962, p. 78).

e “Tn many [cases] it was highly probable that the child had used his
charm in the role of seducer rather than that he had been the innocent
one who had been seduced .. .” (Bender & Grugett, 1952, p. 826).

e “Abraham (1907) and Bender and Blau (1937) have commented on
how charming and seductive these children can be” (Rosenfeld,
Nadelson, Krieger, & Backman, 1977, p. 332).

Three examples of authors attempting to remedy this archaic view are as
follows:

e “.,, Although there may be a different quality to a seduction than to an
attack, it must be remembered that even a seductive child cannot have
full adult comprehension of the act she is courting and cannot be
viewed as responsible in this area” (Lipton & Roth, 1969, p. 859).
