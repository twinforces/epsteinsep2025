Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 190 of 348

OPR. asked. Villafafia. about these emails and about the tenor of ‘her interactions with,
Lefkowitz during the NPA negotiations and with. other defense attorneys generally. ‘“Villafafia.
acknowledged. that. their tone was collegial, and collaborative; and explained that: gencrally, the
tone: of' these ‘emails :reflected her personality and her conimitment to. complete the. task: her
supervisors had. assigned. to her: .

[I]f you were to pull all:my c-mails on,cvery case, you, would ‘find
‘that; that is how’ I communicate with. people. I’m.a.Minnesota girl,
and I prefer not'to be confrontational until J have to be. And I can
be when I need to be. But: my instructions from: my Supervisors ¥ ‘were

given “that task, the best way to ‘complete them was to reach the
agreement and, keeping ‘in mind. the terms that .. . our office had
agrecd to, and, do, that.in.a way that is civil. So... although ‘my
language ‘in the: kind of introductory or prefatory: communications
‘with Mr. :Lefkowitz. was casual and was fricndly, when you look. at
the ferms and when ‘he would come back fo'‘me asking for changes,
my response’ was always, “No, Iwill not:make’that: change.”

Villafaia denied. any intention to.keep the'victims-uninformed about the NPA or to provide
an.improper benefit.for Epstein, and she: explained the context of the emails in question. The email.
in which Villafafia.expressed, reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and. all
of the other persons that we could charge” was written in.response'to a defense:proposal to include
‘in the federal plea agrécment the partics were then, considering a promise by the government, not.
to ‘prosceute Epstcin’s. assistants and. other employees. ‘Lefkowitz had proposed. ‘that. the plea.
agreement state, .“Epstcin’s fulfilling the terms and.conditions of'the Agreement also precludes the
initiation of any and all ‘criminal, charges which. might ‘otherwise in, the future be: brought against
[four named female assistants] or any. cmployce of [a specific Epstcin-owned corporate entity] for
‘any: criminal charge that ariscs out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia.told OPR that.
the USAO was not intending 'to charge Epstcin’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who
could be charged,.and thus did. not oppose the request not to prosecute third. partics.. However,
Villafafia was concerned that an. overly detailed: federal plea agreement would prompt the court to
require the government to provide further information about. the uncharged. conduet, which might
lead Epstcin to claim, the government; breached the agreement. by providing information, to the
court not directly connected,to'the charges to which.hé'was pleading guilty. Villafafia’was not.the
only one'to. express concern about how deeply’ a federal court :might' probe the facts, and. whether
such probing would interfere with. the viability of.a plea. agreement. In.an. earlier email, Lourie
had suggested. charging Epstein. by complaint. to allow the USAO more flexibility: in ‘plea.
negotiations and,avoid the problem that a court:might‘not accept.a'plea.to a conspiracy charge’ that:
required. dismissal of numcrous substantive counts.

As to Villafafia’s offer to:mect with Lefkowitz “offcampus” to.rcsolve outstanding issucs
in, the NPA negotiation, she: explained. to OPR that she believed a. face-to-face mecting, at a.

“neutral” location—with “‘all‘the:neeessary decision makers present or ‘on eall’”’— might facilitate
complction of the! negotiations, which had dragged on:for some time.
