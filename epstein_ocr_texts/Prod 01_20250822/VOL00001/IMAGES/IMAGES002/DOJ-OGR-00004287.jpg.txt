Ii. Prosecuting Ms. Maxwell on Counts Five and Six Would Violate Her Rights. Under
the Double. Jeopardy Clause.

Prosecuting Ms. Maxwell. on Counts Five and'Six would.also violate:her rights under the

Double Jeopardy Clause. The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall “be subject
for the same offence to be twice put.in jeopardy‘of life or limb.” U.S. Const!, Amend. V. The
Clause protects criminal defendants against “a:second prosecution for the same offense after
acquittal,” “a. second prosecution for the same! offense after conviction,” and “multiple
punishinients :for the Saine offense.” United States v. Lopez, 356 F.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 2004)
(quoting North Carolina v. Pearce, 395 US. 711; 717 1.969) overruled on other grounds by
Alabama v.. Smith, 490 U.S. '794.(1989)).. The Supreme. Court:first established the-principle that
the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against multiple punishments for the same: offense almost

cFiminal from being twice pinished. for the same. offense. as from

béing twice triéd for it.
