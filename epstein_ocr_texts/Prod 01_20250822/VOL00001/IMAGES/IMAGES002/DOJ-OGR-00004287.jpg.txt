I. Prosecuting Ms. Maxwell on Counts Five and Six Would Violate Her Rights Under
the Double Jeopardy Clause.

Prosecuting Ms. Maxwell on Counts Five and Six would also violate her rights under the
Double Jeopardy Clause. The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that no person shall “be subject
for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const., Amend. V. The
Clause protects criminal defendants against “a second prosecution for the same offense after
acquittal,” “a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction,” and “multiple
punishments for the same offense.” United States v. Lopez, 356 F.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 2004)

Alabama v. Smith, 490 U.S. 794 (1989)). The Supreme Court first established the principle that
the Double Jeopardy Clause protects against multiple punishments for the same offense almost
150 years ago in Ex Parte Lange, 85 U.S. (18 Wall.) 163 (1873), and it is equally important as
the protection against a successive prosecution for the same offense.

punishment is proposed in the same court, on the same facts, for
the same statutory offense.

... (Tyhe Constitution was designed as much to prevent the
criminal from being twice punished for the same offense as from
being twice tried for it.
