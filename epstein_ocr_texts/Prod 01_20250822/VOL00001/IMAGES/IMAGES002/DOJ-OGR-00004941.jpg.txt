“An examination, of Second Circuit case law:réveals the following factors are relevant
‘when determining whether a party has reasonably relied.on the protective order: (1) thé scope of
the. protective oid (2) the lariguage ofthe order itself; (3)'the level.o f inquiry the court
undertook before granting the order; and (4) the nature of reliance on the order.” In-re Ethylene
Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Antitrust Litig., 255 F.R.D. 308, 318 (D, Conn. 2009).
The-first factor—the scope of the Protective Order—favors granting the Government’s
application for modification. As discussed, the Protective Order was “a broad blanket order,
stipulated to bythe parties, which afforded the parties the discretion to. designate whatever. they
‘produced as ‘confidential.”” Nielsen.Co. (U.S.), LEC v. Success Sys, Inc. 112. F.Supp. 3d 83,
120 (S.D:N.¥: 2015). Blanket pretrial, protective orders, drafted by the patties atid “so ordered”
‘by the court, até common: This case was no exception. “A’broad.protective order is less likely
to elicit reliance ‘because: it is more difficult to show a-party reasonably relied on a blanket order
in producing documents or submitting to.a deposition.”” Jd. (quotitig EPDM,,255.F.R.D. at 319).
The second factor—the language of the Protective Order itself—similarly weighs in favor
of modification. The Protective Order provided that:confidential. information: could be used at
‘trial. (Protective Order, 1f 4, 13.) As the Second.Circuit-has tepeatedly held, a temporary or
limiting provision in a protective order undercuts a finding of reasonable reliance, because from
the outset there was the very real possibility that-material produced in discovery ‘would.end up in
the public record. See, e.g:, Agent Orange, 821 F.2d at 147. The:very fact that material would
have to be unsealed for trial:indercuts a ‘finding of:reliance.
Additionally, where:material contained in couit filings. is concerned, any expectation of
corifidentiality’ is necessarily grounded on the court’s decision: whether to grant the motion to seal

(presumably after weighing the nécessary factor)—nor reliance on.the protective order. And
