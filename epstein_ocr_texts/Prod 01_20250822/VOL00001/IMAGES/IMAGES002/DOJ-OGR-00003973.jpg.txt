government witness in this case. Presumably, BSF is in communication with the government and
knows which of their clients will testify. This narrowing language was offered to BSF but
rejected during the Court ordered conferral. As to the rest of the items, BSF’s boiler-plate
arguments fail for the reasons discussed below.

Requests 1-5

BSF argues that Requests 1-5, communications between BSF and the government about
Ms. Maxwell, are “overbroad and non-specific.” To advance this argument BSF carefully
ignores the actual language of Requests 1-5 which are specific as to date and limited by the
identified individuals and subject matter. Request 1 is for communications between BSF and the
United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY’”’) starting in 2015
about Ms. Maxwell including the meeting that former SDNY-AUSA-turned-BSF lawyer Peter
Skinner (and others) had with then AUSA 3. Request 2 similarly narrowly
requests communications regarding A , an alleged witness against Maxwell being
promoted by BSF to the government. Requests 3, 4, and 5 are for communications between BSF
and lawyers Brad Edwards, Stanley Pottinger, and Paul Cassell about any meeting with the
USAO-SDNY concerning Ghislaine Maxwell or 3.

This is no fishing expedition. The government admits that there were, in fact, meetings
and communications between these individuals and the USAO-SDNY about Ms. Maxwell and
es. Vc know that gg had at least one in-person meeting (and possibly
another) and that she communicated by email and telephone with Mr. Pottinger about yy
ME Who was being proffered to the government as a witness against Ms. Maxwell.

As these requests are narrowly limited by time, subject matter, and participants, it is
disingenuous to argue that they fall into the disfavored “any and all” document subpoenas. In
