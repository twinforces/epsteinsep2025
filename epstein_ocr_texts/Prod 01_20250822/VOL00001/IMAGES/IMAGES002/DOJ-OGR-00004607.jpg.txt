Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 310 of 349
CONCLUSION

In November 2018, the Miami Herald published an extensive investigative report about
state and federal criminal investigations initiated more than 12 years earlier into allegations that
Jeffrey Epstein, a wealthy financier with residences in Florida, New York, and other United States
and foreign locations, had coerced girls into engaging in sexual activity with him at his Palm
Beach, Florida estate. The Miami Herald reported that in 2007, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern
District of Florida, R. Alexander Acosta, entered into an “extraordinary” deal with Epstein that
permitted Epstein to avoid federal prosecution and a potentially lengthy prison sentence by
pleading guilty in state court to “two prostitution charges,” immunized from prosecution Epstein’s
co-conspirators, and concealed from Epstein’s victims the terms of the NPA.

Following the Miami Herald’s report, and after receiving a Congressional request to
investigate, OPR initiated an investigation into the allegations that prosecutors in the USAO
improperly resolved the federal investigation into the criminal conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by
negotiating and executing the NPA. OPR subsequently included in its investigation allegations
stemming from judicial criticism of the government’s conduct relating to federal prosecutors’ and
law enforcement agents’ interactions with Epstein’s victims. In July 2008, a victim, later joined
by a second victim, filed in federal court in the Southern District of Florida an emergency petition
for enforcement of her rights under the CVRA. In February 2019, the district court found that the
government violated the CVRA by failing to advise victims about its intention to enter into the
NPA. The court also found that letters the government sent to victims after the NPA was signed,
describing the investigation as ongoing, were misleading.

During the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands
of records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department of Justice components. The records
included emails, letters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected and reviewed
materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein, including sealed pleadings,
grand jury transcripts, and grand jury audio recordings; examined extensive publicly available
information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and other court records; and reviewed media
reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books relating to the Epstein case. OPR conducted
more than 60 interviews of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI
administrative personnel; current and former USAO staff and attorneys; current and former
Department attorneys and senior managers; and the former State Attorney and Assistant State
Attorney in charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed or received written
information from several victims and attorneys representing victims concerning victim contacts
with the USAO and federal law enforcement.

OPR identified the following five former USAO attorneys as subjects of its investigation
based on information indicating that each of them was involved in the decision to resolve the case
through the NPA or in the negotiations leading to the agreement: former U.S. Attorney
R. Alexander Acosta, and former AUSAs Jeffrey H. Sloman, Matthew I. Menchel, Andrew C.
Lourie, and Ann Marie C. Villafafia. Each subject submitted written responses detailing their
involvement in the federal investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and
decisions relating to victim notification and consultation. OPR conducted extensive interviews of
all five subjects. The subjects also submitted comments on OPR’s draft report.
