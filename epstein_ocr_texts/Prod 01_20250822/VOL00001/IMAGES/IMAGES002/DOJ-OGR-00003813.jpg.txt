1 suggests that the agreements are privileged, as plaintiff

2 argues. She has refused to identify when these individuals

3 began their representations, the nature of the representations.
4 THE COURT: There is a little confusion here, at least
5 in my mind, as to what we are talking about. I certainly

6 understand the two gentlemen whose applications I have just

7 dealt with and the third person, who I take it is affiliated

8 with the Boies firm.

9 Obviously, over time the plaintiff has probably

10 conferred with other lawyers. But who cares? Let's assume she
Le has talked to 20 more lawyers. You want all those retainers?
i That doesn't make any sense. What is the universe we are
13 talking about?
14 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, I certainly understand all
15 of the members of the Boies firm that currently represent her.
16 The third individual, if I understand correctly, is a gentleman
cy by the name of Stan Pottinger. He is a lawyer of some renown.
18 He is also an author of best-selling books. He is listed quite
a We. frequently on plaintiff's privilege log as being part and
20 parcel of advice being given to her on, quote/unquote, media
a issues.
22. THE COURT: That is one.
23 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, there are other persons
24 listed on their privilege log. Many are listed as counsel for
25 plaintiff, but others are listed. Attorney giving advice to
