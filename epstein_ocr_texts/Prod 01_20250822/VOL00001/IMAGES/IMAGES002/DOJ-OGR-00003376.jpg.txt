Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 200 of 348

The sexual offender registration provision is yet another example of how Acosta’s decision
to create an unorthodox mechanism that relied on state procedures to resolve the federal
investigation led to unanticipated consequences benefitting Epstein. Acosta told OPR that one of
the core aspects of the NPA was the requirement that Epstein plead guilty to a state charge
requiring registration as a sexual offender. He cited it as a provision that he insisted on from the
beginning and from which he never wavered. However, the USAO failed to anticipate certain
factors that affected the sexual offender registration requirement in other states where Epstein had
a residence. In selecting the conduct for the factual basis for the crime requiring sexual offender
registration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at least 16 at the time of her
interactions with Epstein, even though Epstein also had sexual contact with a 14-year old victim.
The victim’s age made a difference, as the age of consent in New Mexico, where Epstein had a
residence, was 16; therefore, Epstein was not required to register in that state. As a 2006 letter
from defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Attorney’s Office made clear, the defense team had
thoroughly researched the details and ramifications of Florida’s sexual offender registration
requirement; OPR did not find evidence indicating similar research and consideration by the
USAO.

Finally, Acosta was well aware that the PBPD brought the case to the FBI’s attention
because of a concern that the State Attorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense
counsel. Villafafia told OPR that she informed both Acosta and Sloman of this when she met with
them at the start of the federal investigation. Although Acosta did not remember the meeting with
Villafafia, he repeatedly told OPR during his interview that he was aware that the PBPD was
dissatisfied with the State Attorney’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before the NPA was
signed, moreover, additional information came to light that suggested the State Attorney’s Office
was predisposed to manipulating the process in Epstein’s favor. Specifically, during the
September 12, 2007 meeting, at the state prosecutor’s suggestion, the USAO team agreed, with
Acosta’s subsequent approval, to permit Epstein to plead guilty to one state charge of solicitation
of minors to engage in prostitution, rather than the three charges the USAO had originally
specified. The state prosecutor assured Lourie that the selected charge would require Epstein to
register as a sexual offender. Shortly thereafter, the USAO was told by defense counsel that despite
the assurances made to Lourie, the state prosecutor had advised Epstein—incorrectly, it turned
out—that a plea to that particular offense would not require him to register as a sexual offender.
Yet, despite this evidence, which at least suggested that the state authorities should not have been
considered to be a reliable partner in enforcing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision about
proceeding with a process that depended completely on state authorities for its successful
execution.

OPR finds that Acosta was reasonably aware of the facts and circumstances presented by
this case. He stated that he engaged in discussions about various aspects of the case with Sloman
and Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation of the legal and evidentiary issues and for
their assessment of trial issues. Acosta was copied on many substantive emails, reviewed and
revised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yet, rather than focusing on whether
the state’s prosecution was sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, Acosta
focused on achieving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the state ’s interest, as defined in
part by the state’s indictment, by using the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of
