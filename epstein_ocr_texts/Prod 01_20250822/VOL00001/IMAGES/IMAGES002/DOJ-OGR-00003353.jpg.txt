Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 177 of 348

[O]ne of the issues in the case was the . . . defense’s ability to
describe the case or characterize the case as being legally complex.
It was not as legally complex as they made it out to be. But because
they were able to convince members of our office that it was
somehow extremely novel and legally complex, the issue became
who was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And
because of that, the legal prowess, if you will, of the attorneys [ ]
[became] something to consider.
I think that the ability of Alan Dershowitz and Ken Starr and Jay
Lefkowitz to convince Alex Acosta that I didn’t know what I was
talking [about] also, all came into play. So I think there were a
number of factors and it all came together.

Although Villafafia was critical of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she
conceded that the defense team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout
the case, Epstein’s attorneys prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing
nuanced legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous federal criminal statutes,
and the evidence relevant to those statutes, but it is not unusual or unreasonable for prosecutors to
carefully consider well-crafted legal arguments from defense counsel.

There is little question that Epstein’s extensive team of attorneys was able to obtain
negotiated benefits for Epstein—although the USAO never wavered from its three core
requirements, it did agree to a reduction in prison time from its original offer, and it granted Epstein
certain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’s wealth provided him with skilled,
experienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with
attorneys who knew how to obtain Department review of a USAO matter, thereby delaying
undesired outcomes for as long as possible.**? Despite Epstein’s evident intentions, however, OPR
did not find evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA or its terms resulted from the subjects’
relationships with the attorneys he had selected to represent him.

Zs The Subjects Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel
Did Not Influence Their Actions

Acosta, Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie each asserted that Epstein’s choice of counsel did
not affect his handling of the case. Menchel told OPR that once in private practice, former
colleagues often became adversaries. In Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were
useful because they afforded a defense attorney initial credibility and an insight into the issues a
prosecutor would likely view as areas of concern, which enabled the defense attorney to “tailor”
arguments in a way that would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told
OPR, however, that these advantages did not “move the needle in any major way,” and he
“reject[ed] the notion” that anyone in the USAO had been “swayed” because of preexisting
223 As Chief Reiter later observed in his deposition testimony, “[T]he Epstein case was an instance of a many
million dollars defense and what it can accomplish.”
