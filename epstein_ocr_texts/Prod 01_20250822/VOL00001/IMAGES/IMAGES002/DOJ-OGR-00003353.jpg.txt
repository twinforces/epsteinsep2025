Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 177 of 348

[O]nce of the issues in the ‘case’was the . . . defense’s' ability to
describe the case or characterize the case ‘as being legally complex..
It was notas legally complex.as they*made it out;to, be. But because
they were able to, convince members of our office ‘that. it ‘was
somchow. extremely: novel and legally complex, the i issuc became
who ‘was likely to: succecd. in, arguing these legal, issues. And
because of that, the legal prowess, if you. will, of the attorneys [ ]
[became] something | to consider.

I think that the ability of Alan Dershowitz and. Ken Starr and. Jay
Lefkowitz to convince Alex. Acosta that | didn’t know ‘what I ‘was:
talking [about] also, all came into play. So 1 think. there were a
number of factors:and it all came together.

Although ‘Villafafia. was critical. of Acosta’s consideration of the defense arguments, she
conceded that.the defense team’s, tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly; throughout:
the case, Epstein’s attorneys prepared lengthy memoranda. analyzing the evidence and arguing
nuanced legal. points :concerning federalism, the clements of numcrous federal criminal statutes,
and. the evidence relevant to those:statutes, but itis not unusual. or- unreasonable for prosecutors to
carefully consider'well-craftcd.lcgal arguments from defense counsel.

Theré is little question ‘that’ Epstein’s extensive team of attorneys was able 'to obtain
negotiated benefits for Epstcin—although the USAO' never wavered from its three core
requirements, it:did. agree:toa.reduction.in.prison time:from its original.offer, and it:granted Epstein.
certain other concessions during the negotiations. Epstein’ s wealth provided, him. with skilled,
expericneed negotiators who continually sought various incremental, concessions, and with,
attorncys who knew’ how to. obtain Department ‘review of a USAO ‘matter, thereby. delaying
‘undesired outcomes for-as long:as'possible. 223 Despite Epstcin’s cvident.intentions, however, OPR.
did: not find. evidence warranting a conclusion that the NPA. or: its: terms resulted fromthe subjects?

2. The Subjects. Asserted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel.
Did. Not Influence Their Actions.

Acosta, Menchel, Sloman, and. Couric cach asserted. that. Epstein’ s choice of counsel did.
not: affect: his ‘handling of the case. Menchcl, told OPR that once: in private practice, former:
colleagues often. becanic adversaries. In Mérichel’s ‘view, such ‘preexisting: relationships were
useful because they afforded a defense attorney initial credibility and. an insight into. the issues a,
prosecutor, would. likely view as areas of concern, which. cnabled. the defense attorney to “tailor”
arguments: ina. way that. would maximize their persuasive impact on the USAO. Menchel told
OPR, however, ‘that; these advantages did. not. “move the ‘needle in any major way,” and, he
“reject[ed] the notion” ‘that. anyone in the USAO had. been “swayed” because of preexisting’

As Chief Reiter latersobserved in-his deposition testimony; “[T]he Epstein case; was.an instance: ofa many.
