Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

On May 11, 2021, the Court informed the parties that it set a tentative trial date for
November 29, 2021. The Court accordingly requested a jury trial for that date pursuant to the
COVID rules for centralized jury trial scheduling in the district. The Clerk’s Office has now
confirmed that a jury trial in this case has been scheduled to commence on November 29, 2021.
This is a firm trial date. When the information is available, the Court will provide courtroom
location and public access information by separate order.

Due to space limitations resulting from the SDNY COVID protocols, the Clerk’s Office
has also provided the following dates for administering a juror questionnaire and conducting voir
dire: November 4, 5, and 12 (questionnaire), and November 16-19 (voir dire). The Court
intends to use a streamlined questionnaire as much as feasible given all relevant circumstances.
The parties shall bear this in mind when they discuss and jointly propose a questionnaire and voir
dire on the schedule outlined below.

In light of the firm dates discussed above, it is hereby ORDERED that the parties appear
for a telephone conference to discuss jury selection matters on October 21, 2021 at 12:00 P.M.
Dial-in information for the parties and for public access will be provided when it is available by
separate order.
