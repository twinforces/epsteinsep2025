an investigation into the matter and would review the USAO’s decision to resolve the federal
investigation of Epstein through the NPA.*®

After the district court issued its ruling in the CVRA litigation, on February 21, 2019, OPR
included within the scope of its investigation an examination of the government’s conduct that
formed the basis for the court’s findings that the USAO violated the CVRA in failing to afford
victims a reasonable right to confer with the government about the NPA before the agreement was
signed and that the government affirmatively misled victims about the status of the federal
investigation.

During the course of its investigation, OPR obtained and reviewed hundreds of thousands
of records from the USAO, the FBI, and other Department components, including the Office of
the Deputy Attorney General, the Criminal Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys.
The records included emails, letters, memoranda, and investigative materials. OPR also collected
and reviewed materials relating to the state investigation and prosecution of Epstein. OPR also
examined extensive publicly available information, including depositions, pleadings, orders, and
other court records, and reviewed media reports and interviews, articles, podcasts, and books
relating to the Epstein case.

In addition to this extensive documentary review, OPR conducted more than 60 interviews
of witnesses, including the FBI case agents, their supervisors, and FBI administrative personnel;
current and former USAO staff and attorneys; current and former Department attorneys and senior
managers, including a former Deputy Attorney General and a former Assistant Attorney General
for the Criminal Division; and the former State Attorney and former Assistant State Attorney in
charge of the state investigation of Epstein. OPR also interviewed several victims and attorneys
representing victims, and reviewed written submissions from victims, concerning victim contacts
with the USAO and the FBI.

OPR identified former U.S. Attorney Acosta, three former USAO supervisors, and the
AUSA as subjects of its investigation based on preliminary information indicating that each of
them was involved in the decision to resolve the case through the NPA or in the negotiations
leading to the agreement. OPR deems a current or former Department attorney to be a subject of
its investigation when the individual’s conduct is within the scope of OPR’s review and may result
in a finding of professional misconduct. OPR reviewed prior public statements made by Acosta
and another subject. All five subjects cooperated fully with OPR’s investigation. OPR requested
that all of the subjects provide written responses detailing their involvement in the federal
investigation of Epstein, the drafting and execution of the NPA, and decisions relating to victim
notification and consultation. OPR received and reviewed written responses from all of the
subjects, and subsequently conducted extensive interviews of each subject under oath and before
a court reporter. Each subject was represented by counsel and had access to relevant
contemporaneous documents before the subject’s OPR interview. The subjects reviewed and
provided comments on their respective interview transcripts and on OPR’s draft report. OPR
6 The federal government was closed from December 22, 2018, to January 25, 2019. After initiating its
investigation, OPR also subsequently received other letters from U.S. Senators and Representatives inquiring into the
status of the OPR investigation.
