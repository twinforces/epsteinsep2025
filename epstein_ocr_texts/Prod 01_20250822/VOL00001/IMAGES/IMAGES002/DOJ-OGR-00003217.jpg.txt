told OPR that Epstein’s local counsel brought attorney Alan Dershowitz to see Krischer and the
Assistant State Attorney, but Dershowitz was “overly aggressive” and threatened, “We’re going
to destroy your witnesses; don’t go to court because we’re going to destroy those girls.” According
to Krischer, Dershowitz so “tainted the waters” that Epstein also hired local attorney Jack
Goldberger, with whom Krischer had “a working relationship.” Because the husband of the
Assistant State Attorney was Goldberger’s law partner, Belohlavek recused the Assistant State
Attorney to remove “even the appearance of any kind of conflict” of interest, and Belohlavek took
over the case. Goldberger, together with Gerald Lefcourt, a nationally known New York criminal
defense attorney also representing Epstein, then directed their efforts at Belohlavek and Krischer
to dissuade the office from prosecuting Epstein, largely by attacking the credibility of the victim
witnesses.

Meanwhile, the State Attorney’s Office took the unusual step of preparing to present the
case to a grand jury. Krischer told OPR that under state law as it existed until changed in 2016,
his office prosecuted minors as young as 14 for prostitution.!° The possibility that Epstein’s
victims themselves could have been prosecuted caused “great consternation within the office,” and
according to Krischer, resulted in the decision to put the case before the grand jury.'' Belohlavek
told OPR that her office took the allegations against Epstein “seriously, because . . . it was an
organized scheme to involve young girls by offering them money. And I wouldn’t say that we...
thought they were prostitutes . . . [but] I think there was solicitation.”” However, she said, although
Epstein’s “behavior was reprehensible, . . . I’m limited by . . . the state statutes as to what I can
charge.” Krischer told OPR, “There were so many issues involving the victim-witnesses that to
my mind, in consultation with my [prosecutors], the only way to achieve, to my mind, real justice
was to present the case to the grand jury and not to direct-file” criminal charges against Epstein.

C. Florida State Procedure for Bringing Criminal Charges

Federal criminal procedure requires that a felony charge—that is, any charge punishable
by imprisonment for one year or more—be brought by a grand jury unless waived by a defendant.”
Under Florida law, however, a grand jury is required to bring criminal charges only in a death
penalty case.'? For all other cases, a State Attorney has concurrent authority to file criminal
charges by means of a document called an “information” or to seek a grand jury indictment.
Although Florida criminal cases are routinely charged by information, state grand juries are often
utilized in sensitive or high-profile cases, such as those involving allegations of wrongdoing by
public officials.'* Florida grand jury proceedings are subject to strict secrecy rules that, among
10 Belohlavek told OPR that prostitution was a misdemeanor charge, and she did not handle misdemeanors.
A Because the Florida Department of Law Enforcement investigation into the State Attorney’s Office’s
handling of the Epstein case was pending at the time OPR interviewed Krischer, he declined to further explain to OPR
his office’s prosecutive decisions.
