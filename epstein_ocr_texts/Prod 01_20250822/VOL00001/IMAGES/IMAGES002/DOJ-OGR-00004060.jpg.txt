Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN),
Dear Judge Nathan:

MDC Legal:persists in:falscly accusing Ms. Maxwell’s counsel of violating MDC
Brooklyn’s Icgal, visit procedures. This allegation, is reckless, false, and defamatory. At notime
did counsel provide documents to Ms. Maxwell for her:retention that did not originate ftom, Ms.
Maxwell. The April 29" letter from MDC Legal states that. "supervisory staff: . ‘reviewed video
surveillance footage" but:notably docs not.state the: contents of that’video surveillance. The fact
that MDC Legal does not:claim to have reviewed the video or:report the contents of the-video
footage speaks volumes. .

Further and contrary to MDC’s. Ictter,. MDC staff did in fact “seize and-retain” Ms.
Maxwell’s, confidential legal. docunicnts aftér the legal visit on-April 24". While most of'those
documents were returned to.Ms. Maxwell, other.documents, which.:the: MDG concedes were:
“confiscated,” ‘were not returned to ‘her but rather given to:her counsel the next day. As
previously stated, documents returned to Ms.’ Maxwell’s counsel was “legal mail” which had
been, sent to Ms. Maxwell, some time prior to April 24". Counsel did not bring those documents
into the. facility.

The MDC admits, and. flouts the: fact, that guards read:Ms. Maxwell’s confidential
‘materials. ‘This is no small matter. Ms. Maxwell is working tirelessly to review and discuss’with
her attorneys literally millions of pages of documents. Detcrioration.of her confidential

communications with her attorneys docs not-produce a. fair and just trial.

We press our request that the Court direct the MDC to provide Ms. Maxwell’s counsel
‘with a copy of the video ‘recording.

Very. truly yours,

BOBBIG. STERNHEIM.
