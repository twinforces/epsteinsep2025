jury subpoena at issue in‘Request 8; she thus contends that the absence of the documents in that
‘production suggests coordination. between the Government and. BSE. Other than'through
conclusory speculation, she: fails to.cxplain-how the contents of those letters may be relevant to
her theory of preexisting coordination. between the Government and/BSF. ‘Furthermore, 'to the
extent Maxwell. argucs:that'the. Governmentimay have the documents and has, refused to. produce
them in, contravention, of Bradv or Giglio, the argument is little more than an,attempt to
circumvent: the discovery processes that are in place. The production. of Giglio material has not.
yet happened, and so any claim that the Government has failed. to produce these documents
consistent with, its Giglio obligations is premature. Furthermore, as sct forth in the Opinion &
Order resolving some of Maxwell’s pre-trial motions, the Government has represented iin good,
faith that it is cognizant of its Brady obligations and that it has complied.and will continue to
comply with them. ‘This Court knows well that the Government has not.always lived/up to'those
obligations in évery‘case. But nothing has transpired ‘that provides any reason to doubt the good

faith representations that‘have been madc to. the Court by the AUSAs appearing here. ‘Insum,

none of Maxwell’s thcorics justify production. of these documents ‘under the Rule 1.7(c) process.

Request 12, which secks “any” submission to the Epstein Victims’ Compensation
Program made by BSF, fails under the relevance prong of the Nixon standard. The request.sccks
“any” submission madé by BSF to, the EVCP. In. its reply brief, BSF represents that Maxwell
‘offered to narrow this request:to just those:matcrials submitted on behalf of victims who
‘ultimately testify in:this ‘action.

The request’s failure to satisfy'the.Nixon standard is in part-duc to its relative lack of
specificity, ‘for even, if Maxwell had established the relevance of some evidence ‘captured by this

request, she plainly has not. demonstrated the relevance of all materials submitted to the EVCP.
