a. proposal regarding the special, master’s responsibilitics, along with a. draft letter, to:send to the:
‘special master explaining the procedure, for selecting an attorney representative.

Lefkowitz objected to this proposal ina Ictterto Villafana, pointing out that the NPA. did.
not. provide: for ‘the appointment of a ‘special master. More importantly, Lefkowitz used the
discussion of the special master as an, opening to press:for other altcrations to the language of the
NPA or, at least, to its interpretation. Focusing on:the attorney representative, Lefkowitz: argued.
‘that the attorncy’s role should be vicwed.as limited to negotiating settlements and thatthe attorney’
was precluded from filing lawsuits on behalf off victims who could :not :reach, a negotiated
scttlement:with Epstein. Lefkowitz proposed:

[T]he selected attorney should.cvaluate'the:claims of cach.identificd
individual, ‘negotiate. a total fund: amount ‘with Mr. Epstcin, then
distribute the monics based on the strength of cach case. For those
identified ‘individuals: who elect not to settle with. Mr. Epstein, they
under §. 2255 ¢ as 5 contemplated by [the NPA] and. therefore may: ‘not
continue’ to be represented by: the selected attorney.

Lefkowitz also objected to Villafaiia’s. draft letter to the special ‘master, ‘asserting that it was
essential for the defense to. participate in, crafting a. “mutually acceptable communication” to the.
victims. Going further, Lefkowitz claimed that. any: contact between the USAO and. the victims
about: the § 2255 provision would violate the agreement’s confidentiality’ provision. Lefkowitz
admonished the government. not, to contact the victiiis “to. inform them of the resolution. of the
case, including [the] appointment. of the sclected attorney and:the settlement process.”

Villafafia, forwarded, Lefkowitz’s. letter to Sloman, complaining that the defense
interpretation of the § 2255 proecdure violated the clear language of the NPA and asking; “Can I
‘please just indict. him [Epstein]?” Days later; Sanchez emailed, Sloman, and then sent a ‘follow-up
letter, asking:that'Sloman “help resolve” the issuc regarding the attorncy'representative’s role, and
arguing x that-Epstein-had never intended by signing the NPA to promise to pay-fees for the:victims”

her views. on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman. responded, “I suggest that you. communicate your
proposal back’ to [Sanchez]. The more ‘voices’ they hear the ‘more: ‘wedges they. try: to, drive
betWecn.us.” Villafafia agrced, noting that “[t]here-are-so many of them overthere, Tam afraid’'we
are getting triple-teamed.”!>°

Villafafia, sent; Sanchez: a. letter, regarding the roles of the ‘special master and attorney.
‘representative. The next-day, October’ 10, 2007, Lefkowitz sent a six-page letter to Acosta, asia
“follow up ‘to. olf conversation, yesterday,” expressing, “scious disagreements” with. Villafafia’s
vicw of the: Process for v. victims toclaim.§ 2255 damages under. the NPA. Lefkowitz reiterated the
