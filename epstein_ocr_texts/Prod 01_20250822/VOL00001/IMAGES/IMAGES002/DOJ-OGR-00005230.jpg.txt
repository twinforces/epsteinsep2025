counsel. They compromise her right to prépate her defense and deprive her of her constitutional.
right'to effective assistance of counsel.

Ms. Maxwell has been in, custody for over 15 months without. access to the evidence the.
Government intends.to introduce at.trial. The Court established a deadline: of October 11 for
those and other materials to be disclosed. Late in.the evening of October 11, the Government
produced to counsel approximately 14,000! pages of single-spaced witness materials, as well.as
numerous exhibits and. its purported 404(b) Notice and Co-Conspirator Notice. But the
‘Government refused to hand-dcliver those materials to MDC as they haverwith previous
productions in this‘case. Because the MDE will:not accept hard drives from defense counsel but
‘will. from the Government, counsel provided hard-drives to: the Government a week in advance
of October 11 and requested that; it;hand deliver the hard drive to MDC on, October 11, the day’ of
‘Court-ordered ‘disclosure. The: government denicd this request, choosing instead.to send. the hard
drive via FedEx.

Tracking information confirms that the MDC received. the hard, drive on October 12. On
October. 13, counsel informed.the Government:that-Ms..Maxwell still had. not:reccived the hard
drive and emailed, MDC ‘Legal. Again:this morning, counsel emailed; MDC Legal regarding ‘the
failure to provide Ms. Maxwell with the hard drive containing 3500 material. The MDC. has.
failed to respond. Ms. Maxwell did.not reccive'the hard.drive until late this morning.

It-is: imperative that-the Court-intervene. As'we approach trial, it is, cver more ‘imperative.
that critical trial documents and Jencks Act and.Gig/io material be given to Ms..Maxwell
promptly upon. delivery to the institution. Based-on the MDC’s inefficiency and mishandling of

legal mail, I have no confidence MDC is capable of fulfilling its responsibilities and every reason

' ‘There appear to be approximately‘8,000:pages of testifying witness materials, and another 6,000:single-
spaced:pages of newly”produced “non-testifying witness” materials, the bulk.of which appears
‘exculpatory.
