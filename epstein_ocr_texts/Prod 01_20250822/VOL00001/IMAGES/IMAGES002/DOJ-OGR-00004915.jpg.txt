Xj3qigra SEALED
f 1 everything will be filed under seal, and it will be "In Re
| 2 Grand Jury," you know, the usual, and it will have the
3 treatment that "In Re Grand Jury" materials get, and everything
4 will be filed under seal. But that way I at least have a place
5 to put this, okay?
6 MR. ROSSMILLER: I appreciate that, your Honor. I
7 think we had expected that had the order been either granted or
8 denied, that consistent with our usual All Writs application,
9 that it would have then been identified with a number, but
10 frankly, I'm not in the clerk's office, so --
11 THE COURT: Okay. But it has to have one, and I'm
12 particularly acutely desirous of making sure that this is filed
( | 13 under a docket number with this court because I am concerned
14 about the way everything has happened to date, given the Second
15 Circuit's kind of, it seems to me, obvious displeasure with the
16 fact that this whole thing has been litigated under seal. So
17 grand jury material, absolutely. But let's be sure that there
18 is a docket, you know, that we don't have something that's off
19 the radar screen.
20 MR. ROSSMILLER: Totally understood, your Honor, and I
21 appreciate that, and we're grateful to the Court for that.
22 THE COURT:. Great. Okay. And you'll get your answer
23 by early next week. I have to go to the annual meeting of the
24 chief district judges.
& 25 MR. ROSSMILLER: I don't envy the Court that.
