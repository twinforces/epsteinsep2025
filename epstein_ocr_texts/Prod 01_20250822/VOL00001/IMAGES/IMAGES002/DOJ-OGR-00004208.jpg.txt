Weighing these factors, there is no basis for permitting more than the presumptive ten
deposition limit. First, as highlighted by the motion, the information purportedly sought is
cumulative and duplicative. By way of example, Plaintiff has already deposed Johanna Sjoberg
(a former Epstein employee), Juan Alessi (a former Epstein employee), and David Rodgers*
(former Epstein Pilot). She further seeks to depose Maria Alessi and Jo Fontanella (former
Epstein household employees), as well as Dana Bums and Emmy Taylor (identified as assistants
to Ms. Maxwell or Mr. Epstein). The information Plaintiff claims each of the witnesses may
have is identical to that of each other — what they observed while working for Epstein. Plaintiff
goes so far as to state that Maria Alessi’s deposition is expected to “corroborate” the
observations of her husband’s.

Plaintiff admits that the purpose in seeking the additional depositions is “obtaining
witnesses, like Ms. Sjoberg, who can corroborate that [Plaintiff] is telling the truth.” Yet, Ms.

Similarly, the expected deposition testimony of former Palm Beach Detective Joe
Recarey and former Palm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter are duplicative of each other.

* Mr. Rodgers deposition, held last Friday and requiring a separate trip to Florida for Colorado counsel after the
scheduled court hearing on Thursday, served simply to authenticate flight logs. There are far more convenient, less
burdensome, and less expensive methods by which such information could have been obtained, such as a verifying
affidavit, yet Plaintiff chose to unnecessarily burden counsel, the witness and counsel for the witness with a 3 hour
deposition to accomplish the same end.
