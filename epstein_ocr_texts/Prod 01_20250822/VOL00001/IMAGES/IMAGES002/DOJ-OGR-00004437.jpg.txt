‘Dershowitz, Lefkowitz and Starr.”'”” In, that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he

reecived communications. from Dershowitz, Starr, and Lefkowitz, who “all. sought'to make peace”
‘with him; Acosta referred to it:as “‘aproud moment.”

On July 7,.2008, an Epstein victim. filed an emergency petition against the ‘Department, in,
federal court: in Miami, alleging violation, of her rights under the CVRA; a‘sccond ‘victim joined.

B. Epstein Is Placed on Work-Release

A. few days after Epstcin’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was
incarcerated at the low-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county:
prisoners.were usually housed. She:also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff's Office, Epstein,
was cligible for work release. Although the USAO. had made clear that it expected. Epstein to be
inéarcerated '24 hours’ a. day, every’ day, the subject. of work release had not’ been addressed
explicitly: during the NPA negotiations, and. the. NPA itself was:silent'on the issue. Epstcin’s
acceptance into the work: relcasc program, as' a, convicted sexual offender was scen, by many as
another special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allow Epstein. into the work
release program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriffs Office, OPR did not. investigate whether:
any state, county, or Sheriff's ‘Office ‘rules were violated. OPR. did examine ‘the USAO’s
consideration of work release.’ prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent-unsuccessful cfforts to
ensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.

The first. specific reference to work release was made wecks ‘after the NPA. was signed,
when Lefkowitz: asserted, in. his October 23, 2007 Ictter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s
Sentence does not explicitly violate the terms. of the [NPA] he is cntitled to. any’ type of Sentence
available to him, including but not limited to gain time:and work:rclease.”

In’ November 2007, Sloman had. an.cxchange of letters with Lefkowitz about the USAO’s
understanding that Epstein had agreed to sérve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”
pointing-out that the NPA “clearly indicates:that!Mr. Epstein.is to be. incarcerated.” Sloman noted
that Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allow individuals registered. as sexual.
‘offenders to participate in work: rclcase, and thus Epstein would.not be:cligible for a work release
program. Sloman concluded that-the USAO “is putting’you on notice that:it intends to make certain,
that Mr: Epstein ‘is ‘treated. no better and no ‘worse than anyone clse’ convicted of the same
offense,” aid that if Epstein were ‘to be granted. work release, the USAO would “investigate. the
reasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstcin’s: case. alTR

However, also in, November, State,Attorney Krischer told Sloman,that Epstein was, in fact,
cligible'to petition for work release because his sexual. offender registration would nottake place
