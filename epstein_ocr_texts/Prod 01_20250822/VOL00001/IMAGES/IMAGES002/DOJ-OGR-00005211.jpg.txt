tried, convicted, and condemned in the court of public opinion. Based on widespread coverage of
her extraordinary and miserable conditions of pretrial detention, unsworn “jurors” likely believe
sentence has already been imposed. The pretrial publicity and publications are far too extensive
to list. As of this writing, a simple Internet search by Google yields the following:

= Ghislaine Maxwell: “about 4,590,000 results (0.77 seconds)”

« Jeffrey Epstein: “about 25,800,000 results (0.87 seconds)”
Neither Ms. Maxwell nor her undersigned defense team has ever spoken to the media and have
not contributed to the polluting effect of this unprecedented coverage.

In addition, there have been numerous books, podcasts, and documentaries published and
broadcast about Ms. Maxwell, Epstein, and the allegations in this case. The following is just a
small sample of recent publications concerning Ms. Maxwell:
