Sophia-
Your-accusation is inaccurate as is the information reported to you by:your staff, Nothing in Ms: Maxwell ‘s legal papers was:given to
her by me-or by Leah:Saffian, Esq: Both Ms: Saffian and dispute these ‘allegations in the strongest terms:

Today; Ms: Saffian and I'met-with Ghislaine Maxwell for a:scheduled legal visit: under the gaze of 5 guards and a portable camera
recording ‘audio and video:

After the legal'visit concluded and Ms: Saffian and | left the visiting area; guards accused Ms. Maxwell of possessing documents
obtained from:counsel: The guards;seized confidential documents. from her: including documents she had previously received in legal
mail delivered tothe: MDC and given | to her by MDC: staff: After:seizing, “highly confidential”: documents (subject to‘a protective | order
that your’staff is:not:authorized to review) and work:product; the guards. began reading the documents.and have not returned them to
Ms. Maxwell:

At no time did the:guards; who were.assiduously watching and filming the:legal conference; bring ‘any concern:to my attention; so it is
quite telling thatyyou have: been contacted when counsel:are told:that legal staff are unavailable during the weekend.

No:documents were given to Ms.

Maxwell for her: retention. Demand is hereby made for.an immediate identification of the documents you claim:were not in Ms:
Maxwell's possession upon entering the legal visiting area in advance-of the arrival’of counsel. a.list-of all guards present:during the
visit; and'a copy ofthe: video recording:

Please immediately return the confiscated legal documents to Ms. Maxwell. They are her documents, notimine- The confiscation of
these.documents has deprived Ms: Maxwell of-her'time, and seriously impaired her ability:to review legal documents and prepare for
an, upcoming trial; adding to an already difficult situation.

This matter is being reported to:the Court and legal action will be initiated.

Regarding tomorrow- Ihave, recieved 15:different:confirmations:and cancellations regarding the-scheduled visit for tomorrow; which
will be.attended by Ms. ‘Saffian alone.

lam sorting through these:emails:to:determine what time period is permitted for tomorrow's visit,
