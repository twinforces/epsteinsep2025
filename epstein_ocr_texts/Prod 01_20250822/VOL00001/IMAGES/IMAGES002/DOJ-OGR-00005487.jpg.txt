choosing to be admitted, in any quantity or as to any topic. That's not the law. Because a
number of foundational prerequisites must be satisfied prior to determining that any given "prior
statement" is admissible, the government's request for a pre-trial ruling on prior consistent
statements calls for an inappropriate advisory opinion. Not one of the cases cited by the
government in its Motion concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility of a prior consistent
statement, and with good reason. If the government had wanted the Court to rule pretrial on the
admissibility of prior consistent statements, it could have told the Court exactly which statements
they will seek to admit, the circumstances of those prior statements, whether they are in fact
consistent with specific anticipated trial testimony, and whether the other foundational
prerequisites, including Rule 403, will be satisfied and how. Having failed to provide the Court
with these particulars, the government's motion in /imine should be denied.

A. The 2014 Amendments Did Not Change the Grounds for Which Prior

Consistent Statements May Be Admitted

First, the 2014 Amendments were not nearly as ground-breaking as the Motion suggests.
The Amendments did not, contrary to the government's implication, change the grounds for
admissibility of prior consistent statements. See Mot. at 17-18. According to the Advisory
Committee Notes:

“The [2014] amendment does not change the traditional and well-accepted limits

on bringing prior consistent statements before the factfinder for credibility

purposes. It does not allow impermissible bolstering of a witness.... The amendment

does not make any consistent statement admissible that was not admissible

previously — the only difference is that prior consistent statements otherwise

admissible for rehabilitation are now admissible substantively as well.”

As the government correctly notes, prior to 2014 the Second Circuit, like many other
circuits, admitted prior consistent statements "outside of the context of Rule 801(d)(1)(B) in
order to rehabilitate a witness after certain attacks on credibility." Mot. at 18 (citing United
States v. Pierre, 781 F.2d 329, 333 (2d Cir. 1986)). The effect of the 2014 Amendment then, as
