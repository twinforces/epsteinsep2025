choosing to be admitted, in any quantity or as to any topic. That's‘not the law. Because a,
niumber of foundational. prerequisites must be satisfied prior to, determining that. any. given. "prior
statement" is admissible, the government's request for a pre-trial-ruling on prior consistent
‘statements calls for an-inappropriate ‘advisory opinion. Not one ofthe cases:cited by the
government in its Motion, concerned a pretrial ruling as to the admissibility‘of a-prior consistent

As the. government correctly’ notes, prior to 2014 the Second-:Circuit, like many other
circuits, admitted prior consistent:statements "outside of the context of Rule 801(d)(1)(B) in
order to rchabilitate ‘a witness after certain attacks on credibility." Mot. at 18 (citing United,
