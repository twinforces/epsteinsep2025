Jane Doe #3’s and Jane Doe #4’s participation is also directly relevant to the discovery
disputes currently pending in this case. The Government has raised various relevancy objections
to the documents that Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 are attempting to obtain. The current
victims have responded by explaining how these documents are relevant, including explaining
how these documents might bear on the way in which Epstein used his powerful political and
social connections to secure a favorable plea deal, as well as provide proof of the Government’s
motive to deliberately fail to investigate certain aspects of the victims’ claims in an effort to
maintain the secrecy of the facts and resolve the case without the victims’ knowledge. See, e.g.,

DE 266 at 6-10. Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4’s participation will help prove the relevancy of
these requests, as well as the need for those requests.

One clear example is Request for Production No. 8, which seeks documents regarding
Epstein’s lobbying efforts to persuade the Government to give him a more favorable plea
arrangement and/or non-prosecution agreement, including efforts on his behalf by Prince
Andrew and former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz. Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2
have alleged these materials are needed to prove their allegations that, after Epstein signed the
non-prosecution agreement, his performance was delayed while he used his significant social and
political connections to lobby the Justice Department to obtain a more favorable plea deal. See,

e.g., DE 225 at 7-8 (discussing DE 48 at 16-18). Jane Doe #3 has directly person knowledge of
Epstein’s connection with some of these powerful! people and thus how Epstein might have used
them to secure favorable treatment.

Adding two new victims to this case will not delay any of the proceedings. They will
simply join in motions that the current victims were going to file in any event. For example, the
