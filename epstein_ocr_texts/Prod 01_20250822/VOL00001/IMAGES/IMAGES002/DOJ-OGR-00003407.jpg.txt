Chief wanted to know if the victims had been consulted about the deal.”?! Sloman forwarded this
email to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman responded to her email by telephone, possibly
after he had spoken to Acosta, and stated, “[Y]ou can’t do that now.” Villafafia did not recall
Sloman explaining at the time the reason for that instruction.

Villafafia told OPR that shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[WJe’ve
been advised that . . . pre-charge resolutions do not require victim notification.” Sloman did not
recall any discussions, before the NPA was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with
them regarding the potential resolution of the case. Sloman told OPR that he “did not think that
we had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seek
approval from victims to resolve a case. We did have an obligation to notify them of the resolution
in... filed cases.” Sloman said that no one other than Villafafia raised the notification issue, and
because the USAO envisioned a state court resolution of the matter, Sloman “did not think that we
had to consult with victims prior to entering into the NPA.” Lourie told OPR that he had no
memory of Villafafia being directed not to speak to the victims about the NPA.”” Similarly, the
attorney who assumed Lourie’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned to his detail in the
Department told OPR that he did not recall any discussions regarding victim notification and he
“assumed that was being handled.”?”°

Acosta did not recall the September 6, 2007 email, but told OPR that “there is no
requirement to notify [the victims], because it’s not a plea, it’s deferring in favor of a state
prosecution.” Acosta told OPR that he could not recall any “pre-NPA discussions” regarding
victim notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not to consult with the
victims before entering into the NPA.””* Ultimately, Acosta acknowledged to OPR, “[C]learly,
given the way it’s played out, it may have been much better if we had [consulted with the victims].”

CEOS Chief Oosterbaan told OPR that he disagreed with the USAO’s stance that the
CVRA did not require pre-charge victim consultation, but in his view the USAO “posture” was
not “an abuse of discretion” or “an ethical issue,” but rather reflected a “serious and legitimate
22) Villafafia told OPR that she referred to Oosterbaan in the email because “he was the head of CEOS and
because I think they were tired of hearing me nag them [to notify the victims].” As previously noted, Villafafia’s
statement that victim approval had to be obtained was incorrect. Even when applicable, the CVRA only requires
consultation with victims, not their approval of a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafafia’s comments concerning the
pre-charge application of the USAO’s CVRA obligation to consult with the victims appear at odds with her statement
to OPR that the CVRA applied to the USAO only after a defendant was charged and that she did not intend to activate
the USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent letters to victims in August 2006.

282 Lourie noted that during this period, he had left Florida and was no longer the supervising AUSA in the
office, but was “help[ing] [] out” from offsite because he had “historical knowledge” of the case.
i The AUSA who for a time served as Villafafia’s co-counsel on the Epstein investigation similarly did not
“know anything about” discussions in the USAO regarding the need to inform victims of the likely disposition of the
case. The AUSA stated that he stopped working on the case “months earlier” and that he “didn’t have anything to do
with the [NPA] negotiations.”
204 Villafafia told OPR that she was not aware of any “improper pressure or promise made to [Acosta] in order
to .. . instruct [her] not to make disclosures to the victim[s].”
