email, to Acosta. Villafafia recalled that Sloman, responded to her email by telephone, possibly:
aftcr he had spoken to Acosta, and ‘stated, “[Y]ou, can?t. do that.now.” ‘Villafafia did not: recall
Sloman explaining at the time, the reason forthat instruction.

Villafafia told.OPR. that shortly before the: NPA was signed, Sloman told her, “[W]e’ve
been, advised ‘that; ... . pre-charge resolutions do not require: victim notification.” Sloman did not:
recall.any discussions, before the NPA :was signed, about contacting the victims or conferring with.
them ‘regarding the ‘potential resolution of the case. Sloman told. OPR. that he “did not think,that'
we had to consult with victims. prior to entcring into the NPA,” and “we did not have to seck.
approval.from. victims to resolve a case., We did:have an obligation, to:;notify them of the resolution,
in... filed cases.” Sloman:said that no’ one other than Villafafia raised the: notification issue, and.
because the USAO envisioned. a. state court: ‘resolution of the: matter, r, Sloman “did hot ‘think that: we

memory of Villafana being. directed» not to 9 speak to thes victims: about the: NPA. 292 Similarly, ‘the:

attorney who assumed Louric’s supervisory duties after Lourie transitioned. to his detail in. the:
Department told OPR that he did not recall any. discussions. regarding victim ‘notification and, he
“assumed that was being handled.”°”>

Acosta did snot :recall the September 6, 2007 .cmiail, but told OPR. that “there is ro
requirement to notify [the:victims], because. it’s not a plea, ‘it’s deferring’ in favor. of a state
prosccution.” ,Acosta told OPR. that: he could not recall, any: “pre-NPA. discussions” regarding
victim, notification or any particular concern that factored into the decision not-to consult, with the
victims before entering’ into the NPA.*’+ Ultimately, Acosta acknowledged 'to OPR, “[C]learly,
given the way it’s played out, it may have becn-much better if we had [consulted with the victims].”

CEOS Chief. Oosterbaan. told OPR. that he disagreed. ‘with the USAO’s ‘stance that the:
CVRA did ‘not require: pre- ~charge victim consultation, but in his view. the USAO. “posture” was
not. ‘an. abuse! of discretion” or “an. ethical issue,” but rather ‘reflected..a “scrious and legitimate

al. Villataia told OPR that she ‘referred. to Oosterbaan ‘in’ the emiail. because! “She was the head of CEOS and.
because I. think they were tired ‘of hearing ‘me ‘nag, them [to ‘notify the victinis].” As prev iously noted, Villafana’s
‘statement that ‘victim: approval ‘had. to be obtained was incorrect. Even’ when applicable, the EVRA. only requires
consultation with victinis, not‘their: approval. of.a plea agreement. Moreover, Villafaiia’s comments concerning’ the
pre- -charge application.of the USAO"s CVRA.obligation to consult with.the v ictims: appear at odds with her statement:
to-OPR that the CVRA applied to’the USAO. only after a. defendant was charged arid that She did:not:intend to activate
the USAO’s CVRA obligations when she sent letters to victims in.August.2006.

292.

Lourie ‘noted that during this ‘period, he had. left Florida and. was ‘no longer’ the: supervising’ AUSA, in, the

office, but was “help[ing] [] out” from.offsite becuse he had “historical know ledge” “of the case,
798 The AUSA:who for a time served as Villafafia®s, co-counsel, on. the Epstein investigation, similarly did not;
“know anything about” discussions in‘the USAO-regarding ther need to inform: victims of ‘the’ likely disposition of the
case. The AUSA stated that: he ici stopped working on.the case “months earlier and that'he “didn’t have anything:to, do
with the [NPA]: negotiations.”

294 Villafafia told'OPR that she was not aware of:any* "improper pressure or promise made: to [Acosta] :in order:
to:.. cinstruct [her] not'to make disclosures to the vietim[s].”
