B. “CPU's,” “Zip'CD’s,” “CD’s,” and “Flash Cards”

The search. warrant inventory identifies numerous electronic storage devices as. having
been, scized. However, no actual, inventory of the alleged contents of these drives appears to have:

C. Photos

The inventory also lists the seizure of “Photos.” Many of the photos are ‘not identified.
