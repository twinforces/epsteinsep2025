Toussie to the Landgraf analysis, see United States v. Gentile, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649, 655 (D.N.J.
2017), and that case, which did not concern Section 3283, relied extensively on a pre-Landgraf
opinion requiring a clear statement of congressional intent in favor of retroactivity. See id. at 655
(citing United States v. Richardson, 512 F.2d 105 (3d Cir. 1975)). That clear-statement rule is
inconsistent with the analysis required by Landgraf step two. See Nader, 425 F. Supp. 3d at 631
(rejecting an identical argument relying on Toussie and Gentile).

The defendant asks this Court to break new ground and become the first court to hold that
Section 3283 applies only prospectively. The Court should reject this invitation. For the reasons
set forth above, the weight of authority holds that Section 3283 applies retroactively, in keeping
with Congress’s express intent to expand prosecutions of individuals who sexually exploit
children. The Indictment is timely, and the motion should be denied.

C. The Defendant’s Crimes Involved the Sexual Abuse of Minors

The defendant next argues that Section 3283 does not apply at all, and she asks the Court
to conclude that the crimes of sexual abuse alleged in the Indictment did not involve sexual abuse.
Her argument runs contrary to both the case law and common sense. Her motion is meritless and
should be denied.

By its terms, Section 3283 applies to any “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse,
or kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years.” 18 U.S.C. § 3283. As discussed above, when
the statute was first enacted, it was located at 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k). The definition of the term
“sexual abuse” is located in a neighboring provision within that same section:

For purposes of this section . . . the term ‘sexual abuse’ includes the
employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement, or coercion
of a child to engage in, or assist another person to engage in, sexually
