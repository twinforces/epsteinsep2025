anticipated witnesses available . . . ten days before trial. There is no need to depart from the
customary rule in this district of disclosure shortly before trial.”); United States v. Seabrook, No.
10 Cr. 87 (DAB), 2010 WL 5174353, at *4(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 14, 2010) (“The Government represents
to the Court that it is aware of its Brady, Giglio, Jencks Act, and 404(b) obligations and will
comply with them in a timely fashion, as appropriate. Based on the Government's representations,
and on the current posture of this case, the Court expects that the Government will comply timely
with all of its obligations under Brady, Giglio, the Jencks Act, and Rule 404(b), and does not find
a need to order compliance at this time.” (internal citation omitted)); Russo, 483 F. Supp. 2d at 308
(“Here the government has represented that it intends to produce Giglio material no later than the
Friday of the week before a witness is scheduled to testify at trial, in accordance with its usual
practice. To the extent that the government’s disclosure in this case proves unusually voluminous
or complex, the government has in good-faith represented that it intends to
produce Giglio material sufficiently in advance of their witnesses’ testimony so as to avoid any
delay in trial. At the time of those disclosures, to the extent that Defendants feel that additional
time is necessary given the volume or complexity of the materials provided, the Court will
consider applications to continue or recall witnesses. It is unnecessary, however, to
order early disclosure at this time.”); United States v. Canter, 338 F. Supp. 2d 460, 461-62
(S.D.N.Y. 2004) (denying analogous motion and noting that “[i]t has been the practice of this
Court and of other courts in this district to require that the Government produce these materials a
few days before the start of trial”). Because the Government has committed to providing the
defense with Giglio material multiple weeks in advance of trial, which is ample time for the
defense to prepare its cross-examination of the Government’s witnesses, this motion should be
denied.
