Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 2 of 34
related to the newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies
Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her
motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further expedite
discovery.

The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its reasoning on the
pages that follow:

e Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts based on a non-prosecution agreement between
Jeffrey Epstein and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. The Court
concludes that the agreement does not apply in this District or to the charged offenses.

6 Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts as untimely. The Court concludes that the
Government brought the charges within the statute of limitations and did not unfairly
delay in bringing them.

® Maxwell moves to dismiss the Mann Act counts because they are too vague, or in the
alternative to require the Government to describe the charges in greater detail. The
Court concludes that the charges are specific enough.

e Maxwell moves to dismiss the perjury counts because, in her view, her testimony
responded to ambiguous questioning and was not material. The Court concludes that
these issues are best left for the jury.

® Maxwell moves to sever the perjury counts from the Mann Act counts so that they can
proceed in a separate trial. The Court concludes that severance is appropriate and will
try the perjury counts separately.

e Maxwell moves to strike language from the indictment that she believes is superfluous
and to dismiss conspiracy counts she believes are redundant. The Court concludes that
these motions are premature before trial.

e Maxwell moves to compel the Government to immediately disclose certain categories
of evidence. The Court concludes that she is not entitled to do so, but the Court will
order Maxwell and the Government to confer on a discovery schedule.

® Maxwell moves to dismiss all counts because a grand jury in White Plains, rather than
Manhattan, returned the S1 superseding indictment. Because a jury in Manhattan
returned the S2 superseding indictment, the motion appears moot.
