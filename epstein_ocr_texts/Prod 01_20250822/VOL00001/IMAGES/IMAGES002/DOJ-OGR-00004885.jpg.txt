to remedy any misperception or to stop Cosby from openly and detrimentally relying upon
that decision. In light of these circumstances, the subsequent decision by successor
D.A:s to prosecute Cosby violated Cosby's due process rights. No other conclusion
comports with the principles of due process and fundamental fairness to which all aspects
of our criminal justice system must adhere.28

Having identified a due process violation here, we must ascertain the remedy to

reserved for remedying an injured party ‘to a fully consummated agreement, such as an
agreed-upon and executed plea bargain. Commonwealth v. Spence, 627 A.2d 1176,
1184 (Pa. 1993). “Specific performance’ is a traditional contract remedy that is available
when monetary damages are inadequate.” Martinez, 147,A.3d at 532 (citing BLACK's LAw
DICTIONARY 1425 (8th ed. 2004) (defining “specific performance” as, inter alia, “a court-

monetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate’).

that the remedy does not: naturally flow. to. someone under these circumstances as an
equity and fundamental fairness command it. See Scotland, at 614 F.2d at 365 (stating
that, if “the defendant:detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm
from this induced reliance implicates due process guarantees”); see also Commonwealth

v. Mebane, 58 .A.3d 1243 (Pa. Super. 2012) (upholding trial court ruling that, fundamental
