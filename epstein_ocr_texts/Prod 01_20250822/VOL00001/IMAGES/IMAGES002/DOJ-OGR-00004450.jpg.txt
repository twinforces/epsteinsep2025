The Ashcroft Memo dirceted. that, “in. all federal cascs, federal. prosecutors must. ‘charge
and ‘pursue the mostiscrious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by:the: facts of
the case,” execpt as authorized by an Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or designated,
supervisory authority in.certain articulated. limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Mcmo cautioned.
that a charge is not“readily provable” if the prosecutor, harbors 4,g00d faith doubt, based on cithcr
the law-or the evidence, as to the government’ s ability to prove the charge at: trial The Ashcroft
‘Memo explains that. the: “basic: policy” “ “requires fedcral prosccutors to: char
charges that, are determined.to be’ ‘readily. provable” and would yield the: most substantial seatence
