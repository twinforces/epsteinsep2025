Likewise, he did not recall the specific statement, “[i]n Pennsylvania we
charged people for criminal conduct. We don’t charge people with making
a mistake or doing something foolish;” however, he indicated that it is a true
statement.

As part of the 2005 investigation, [Cosby] gave a full statement to law
enforcement and his Pennsylvania and New York homes were searched.
[Cosby] was accompanied by counsel and did not invoke the Fifth
Amendment at any time during the statement. After [Cosby's] interview,
Ms. Constand was interviewed a second time. Mr. Castor never personally
met with Ms. Constand. Following that interview of Ms. Constand, Mr.
Castor spoke to [Cosby’s] attorney Walter M. Phillips, Jr. Mr. Phillips told
Mr. Castor that during the year between the assault and the report, Ms.
Constand had multiple phone contacts with [Cosby]. Mr. Phillips was also
concerned that Ms. Constand had recorded phone calls with [Cosby]. Mr.
Phillips told Mr. Castor that if he obtained the phone records and the
recorded calls he would conclude that Ms. Constand and her mother were
attempting was to get money from [Cosby] so they would not go to the
police. While he did not necessarily agree with the conclusions Mr. Phillips
thought would be drawn from the records, Mr. Castor directed the police to
obtain the records. Mr. Castor’s recollection was that there was an
“inordinate number of [phone] contacts” between [Cosby] and Ms. Constand
after the assault. He also confirmed the existence of at least two “wire
interceptions,” which he did not believe would be admissible.
As part of the 2005 investigation, allegations made by other women were
also investigated. Mr. Castor delegated that investigation to Ms. Ferman.
He testified that he determined that, in his opinion, these allegations were
unreliable.
Following approximately one month of investigation, Mr. Castor concluded
that “there was insufficient credible and admissible evidenced upon which
any charge against Mr. Cosby related to the Constand incident could be
proven beyond a reasonable doubt.” He testified that he could either leave
the case open at that point or definitively close the case to allow a civil case.
He did not believe there was a chance that the criminal case could get any
better. He believed Ms. Constand’s actions created a credibility issue that
could not be overcome.
Mr. Castor further indicated, “Mr. Phillips never agreed to anything in
exchange for Mr. Cosby not being prosecuted.” Mr. Castor testified that he
told Mr. Philips of his legal assessment and then told Ms. Ferman of the
analysis and directed her to contact Constand’s attorneys. He testified that
she was to contact the attorneys to let them know that “Cosby was not going
to be prosecuted and that the purpose for that was that | wanted to create
