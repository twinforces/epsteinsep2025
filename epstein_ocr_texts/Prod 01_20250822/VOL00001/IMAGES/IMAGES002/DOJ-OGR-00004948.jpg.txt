destroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—
that caused the Government to proceed via subpoena [to Boies Schiller] and its related |
Application.” (Gov’t Letter Br. at 5.) |
To be sure, the convenience of having potentially incriminating testimony readily |
available does not in and of itself rise to the level of an extraordinary circumstance. In )
Martindell itself, for example, the Second Circuit found no extraordinary circumstance because |
“the Government, by discharging the grand jury investigating the matters in connection with |
which the Government sought the witnesses’ deposition transcripts, apparently chose not to use |
grand jury investigative processes to obtain their testimony.” 594 F.2d at 296 n.5, Therefore, |
the mere unavailability of the information was not extraordinary. Similarly, in Nosik v. Singe, 40 |
F.3d 592 (2d Cir. 1994), the Circuit again declined to find that the Government had made a :
showing of extraordinary circumstance, explaining, “[T]he possibility that [an individual] might |
one day invoke the Fifth Amendment at her criminal trial does not automatically create for |
prosecutors a compelling need for the testimony that [the individual] might have given [in the |
civil proceeding]... [.] Prosecutors often make do without the testimony of a defendant.” Jd. at |
595-96 (citing Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296). |
Here, however, the extraordinary amount of publicity surrounding all aspects of what I |
will call the Epstein matter does create practical limitations to the grand jury’s ability to secure |
certain information with the secrecy it requires to conduct an appropriately thorough and |
thoughtful investigation. Moreover, it does not appear to this Court that we are in a situation in |
which the Government seeks information merely to “ascertain the truth of much of what it has |
independently discovered.” Minpeco, 832 F.2d at 743. This is not a case, like United States v. :
Oshatz, 700 F. Supp. 696, 703 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), where the Government was trolling for evidence
