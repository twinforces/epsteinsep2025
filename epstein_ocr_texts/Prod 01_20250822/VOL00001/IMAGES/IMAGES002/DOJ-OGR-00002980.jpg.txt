respects from, those underlying contract law, the district court. concluded. that. “third-party:
beneficiaries. have no contractual right to. enforce plea agreements.” /d. at *3-4. The court:
reasoned, “[t]he right to.cnforce'a plea deal docs not.cxist. for its own:sake; rather, it is‘a:means to
achieve fairness.in’plea, bargaining.” /d.‘at*4. That:is because a defendant-has the right to enforce
his plea agrecment, and. “enforcement by ‘third parties adds nothing to protecting the deferdant’s
right.” Jd. The same holds true here.

In support of her claim that she has, standing to cnforee the NPA, the defendant:rclics upon
three district court decisions, nonce of which analyzed:the threshold:question of whether third party:
standing concepts from contract law apply to plea agreements., In Uinifed States v. Florida West
Intl Airways, Iné.,853.F. Supp..2d 1209, 1228 (S.D. Fla. 2012), the:district court:applied the third,
party beneficiary doctrine to a former airline: cmployce: based. on.a prior plea agreement with the:
airline that immunized, among others, current and former employees of the airline and, its
subsidiarics. In.its.analysis, however, the court applied the doctrine without'analyzing the question.
of whether third. party beneficiary standing ‘principles apply: to plea agreements. Jd. For similar
reasons, the defendant’s reliance on United States v. El-Sadigy 133 F.Supp. 2d 600, 608-09 (N.D.
‘Ohio 2001) is:misplaced. Inthat:case, the court.permitted.a third party to invoke a’plea-agreement,
but it did not analyze or address whether third party standing rules apply to’plea. agreements. Jd.
Likewise, in Wnited States v. CEW Const. Cé., 583 F. Supp. 197, 203 (D:S.C. 1984), the court:
applicd the third.party beneficiary doctrine, but relied solely on.contracts treatises for support, and.
did not analyze, whether that; doctrine: should be applicd to plea, agreements.

In. any event, even if thitd party bencficiarics, had standing to enforce federal ‘plea.
agreements, the defendant: has failed. to establish that she is-a'third party: beneficiary of the NPA.

In order to establish that she: has cnforecable rights under'the NPA, the defendant must; show’ that:
