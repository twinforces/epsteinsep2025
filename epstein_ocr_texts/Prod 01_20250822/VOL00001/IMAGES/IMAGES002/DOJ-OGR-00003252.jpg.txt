‘was reached, but he believed that Acosta made t the decision, based « on 1 recommendations from.
Menchel, Louric, and Villafafia. He opined to OPR that the decision was likely based on an
assessment by Menchel and Lourié ofthe. litigation risks, presented by’ the, easc.*" ‘Sloman added.
that he did not.know: how. a two-ycar sentence might have:rclated to specific charges or to cither
state or federal sentencing guidclines. Louric likewise told OPR.he:did not recall how the two-year
term was decided. upon, or by: whom, but. he speculated, that it‘:may have been, presented. by the
defense as the most Epstcin would accept, and that the decision, would have been reached. by’
Acosta following “extended consideration, réscarch, and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,
Menchel, Lourie, and. Villafafa.®

Menchel told OPR that he did not recall discussing a. two-year plea deal with Acosta or
‘who reached the decision. that two years was an appropriate.sentence. Menchcl. also told OPR,
however, that he recalled believing that if the USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,
Epstein. would -have felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would. have chosen to take
the case to trial. Menchel recalled believing there-was a real-risk that thc USAO might losc:at trial,
and. in:so doing, might cause more frauma fo the victims, particularly thosc ‘who were ‘reluctant to
testify: Menchel told,OPR that he did ‘not belicve'that; anyone at the'time looked at two years “as
a fair result.in terms of the conduct. | think that. was not. the issue. The issue was whether or not:
if We. took: this cas¢ to trial, would We risk losing éverything,” and “if We . . felt we could have
‘gottcn ‘more: time, we would have, without having to press it to the trial.”

Acosta told OPR that “I had. decided and, endorsed” the two-year resolution “at some:
point,” and that it resulted from “back and forth” discussion “over the coursé of some days or a.
week ortwo.” As:hoted carlicr inthis Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’S role in this case:mercly
as a “backstop” to the state’s prosecution, which.he explained:to OPR was “a.polite way.of saying[,
‘Jencouraging, the: state to do.a little bit more.["]”*? Acosta,'said that he understood. two years’
imprisonment!to have represented the sentence Epstein faced under one of the original. charges the
PBPD was considering at. the outset of the state investigation.“+ Acosta. also told OPR ‘that: he

the attorney forthe governnient has a continuing, obligation to assist the court in’
its determination-of the:sentence' to be imposed. The prosecutor'must be familiar.
with the guidelines generally and.with. the specific g guideline: ‘Provisions applicable
to his or her case. In discharging these duties, the attorney forthe government
should ... . endeavor to ensure the accuracy and completeness of the information
upon which, the sentencing decisions will be based.

1 Th Slonian?sview. Menchel and Lourie were “two of'the finest tial lawyers” inthe USAO.

#2 Lourie noted that Sloman and. Menchel, were “two extraordinarily: experienced ‘people sin [Acosta’s] front;
office: who had tried -.. . gobs, and.gobs.of cases.”

8 In: commenting on’ OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s: attorney asserted.:that-OPR’s:use. of. Acosta’s quote, “‘a little
bit more,” “unfairly: minimized” Acosta’s and,the USAO’s efforts to achieve. justice in this: case. Acosta’s attorney:
also asserted. that the phrase was * “clearly soft- spoken, understatement,” that the terms obtained were, * “substantially
more oncrous than.the state’s alternative resolution,” ‘and that-Acosta, was “clearly declining:the inyitation,to:take; the
State to task and soft-pedaling:an obvious-distinction.”

4 OPR. examined. this ‘assertion, and was unable! to verify that the! proposed. two-year. term. of imprisonment
corresponded with. the charges:that:the PBPD considered at the outset. of.the state investigation.or with the: charge in,
