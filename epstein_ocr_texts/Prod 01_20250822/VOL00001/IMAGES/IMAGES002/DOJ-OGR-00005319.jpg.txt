to have fo come back, at all for the in-person questioning in this case and.exactly what date and.
tine you. would be obliged to be here.

Once: that in-person questioning is completed, :some of that group will be asked. to return.
for the last; step in;the jury selection, and ‘some of that last group will be sclected'to serve on;the
six weeks. We'will of course not sit.on federal holidays, including Christmas Eve and Christmas
and. New. Year’s Eve and New Yecar’s. Day. The questionnaire will.cxplain:the estimated
schedule more fully-and you will get.to that. in‘a:moment.

But first, | want to tell you a little bit:about the case. As I nientioned, this is a criminal
case: The charges against the Defendant are sct forth in.an indictment. An.indictment is a
formal ‘method of accusing somcone ofa crime. It is not-cvidence of any kind. It is the:
Government’s burden, at‘trial to establish a:defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

This case is brought bythe United States Attorney’s Office: for the: Southern District of,
New'York against Ghislaine Maxwell. The indictment against.Ms. Maxwell alleges that she
conspired with and aided.and abetted Jeffrey.Epstcin to entice minor females to travel to engage
in criminal sexual activity, to transport, minors to engage ‘in criminal sexual activity,.and to
engage in sex trafficking of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has ‘pled:not guilty to.all charges. Ms.
Maxwell is.presumed. innocent, and. before :she can. be found guilty on any charge, the jury must
find that the Government has'proven, cach, clement of that: crime beyond,a, reasonable, doubt.

Now, as some. of'you:may have alrcady figured out, there. is, going to, be significant press,
coverage of this trial. Some'of you may have:already’heard about:this casein the media, and that

is OK. But:from this‘moment. on, | instruct you, that. you are not:to read or watch.or listen to
