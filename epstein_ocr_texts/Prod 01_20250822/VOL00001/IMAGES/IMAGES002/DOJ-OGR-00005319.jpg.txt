to have to come back at all for the in-person questioning in this case and exactly what date and
time you would be obliged to be here.

Once that in-person questioning is completed, some of that group will be asked to return
for the last step in the jury selection, and some of that last group will be selected to serve on the
jury.

The trial in this case will begin on November 29 and we expect it to last approximately
six weeks. We will of course not sit on federal holidays, including Christmas Eve and Christmas
and New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. The questionnaire will explain the estimated
schedule more fully and you will get to that in a moment.

But first, I want to tell you a little bit about the case. As I mentioned, this is a criminal
case. The charges against the Defendant are set forth in an indictment. An indictment is a
formal method of accusing someone of a crime. It is not evidence of any kind. It is the
Government’s burden at trial to establish a defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

This case is brought by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of
New York against Ghislaine Maxwell. The indictment against Ms. Maxwell alleges that she
conspired with and aided and abetted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage
in criminal sexual activity, to transport minors to engage in criminal sexual activity, and to
engage in sex trafficking of a minor. Ms. Maxwell has pled not guilty to all charges. Ms.
Maxwell is presumed innocent, and before she can be found guilty on any charge, the jury must
find that the Government has proven each element of that crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

Now, as some of you may have already figured out, there is going to be significant press
coverage of this trial. Some of you may have already heard about this case in the media, and that
is OK. But from this moment on, I instruct you that you are not to read or watch or listen to
