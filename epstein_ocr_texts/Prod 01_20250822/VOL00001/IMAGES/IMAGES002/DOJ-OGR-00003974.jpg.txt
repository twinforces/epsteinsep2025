fact, none of the requests contains the words “any” or “all” because they are specifically limited
to communications between BSF and the USAO-SDNY about Ms. Maxwell and gg
and communications between BSF and their co-counsel in the Giuffre v. Maxwell matter about
those known meetings. BSF tries to cobble an “any or all” argument together by picking the
word “any” from the definition section of the subpoena identifying the two entities, BSF and the
USAO-SDNY, and attaching it to the word “all” from a separate paragraph defining
“communication.” Of course, absent these definitions, BSF would be complaining that the
subpoena was vague because it failed to define either the entities involved or what was meant by
“communication.”

Significantly, BSF already identified some of the communications between itself and the
government. According to its so called “Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre’s Revised Supplemental
Privilege Log Dated April 29, 2016,” BSF refused to produce as privileged “approx. 57”

Attorneys have had with any local, state or federal law enforcement agent or agency, whether in
the United States or any other country, whether in Your capacity as a purported victim, witness,
or perpetrator of any criminal activity, and whether as a juvenile or as an adult, including without
limitation:

a. the date of any such Communication;

b. the form of any such Communication, whether oral or written and if written, the format

of any such Communication;

c. the identities of all persons involved in the Communication, including the identity of

the law enforcement agency with whom the agent is or was affiliated;

d. the case number associated with any such Communication;

e. the subject matter of any such Communication;

f. the disposition of any case associated with any such Communication, irrespective of

whether the matter was sealed, expunged or later dismissed.”
