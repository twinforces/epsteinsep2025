As the Court is aware, this is the defendant's fourth
felony conviction for narcotics offense, and we agree with the

probation office that a guidelines séntence would be

appropriate in this case.

THE COURT: Thank, ‘you. very much.

Mr, Donaldson, have you reviewed the! presentence
report?

MR, DONALDSON: Yes, I have, your Honor,

THE COURT: Hadvé ‘you Gone over it with Ms. Days?

MR, DONALDSON: Several times, your Honor.

THE COURT: I will hear you 6n séntencing, sit.

MR. DONALDSON: Thank, you, very much, ‘your Honor.
As the Court. is aware, the Céurt. read thé PSR, a8 wé
all did, and the guideline range that. came back from the PSR

was 63 to 78 months, similar to what we agreed to in our plea

agreement. The probation department, recommended 63 months of

inéaréeration:

We ane recommending -- requesting that the Court
sentence Ms. Day to 60 months, approximately three months below
what, the probation, department is recommending and which would
be the statutéry minimum.

In oun writing to the Court, we tried to provide ‘the
Céurt. a background of Ms. Days and, we hope, sone indication of
why we believe 60. months is appropriate, rather than 63 months

or rather than. a guidelines sentence.
