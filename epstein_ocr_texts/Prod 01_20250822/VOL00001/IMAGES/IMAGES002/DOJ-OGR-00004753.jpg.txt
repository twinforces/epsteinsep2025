Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document300_ Filed 06/15/21 Page 10 of 32 6
L4TPDAYS

1 As the Court is aware, this is the defendant's fourth
2 felony conviction for narcotics offense, and we agree with the
3 probation office that a guidelines sentence would be

4 appropriate in this case.

S THE COURT: Thank you very much.

6 Mr. Donaldson, have you reviewed the presentence

7 report?

8 MR. DONALDSON: Yes, I have, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: Have you gone over it with Ms. Days?

10 MR. DONALDSON: Several times, your Honor.

11 THE COURT: I will hear you on sentencing, sir.

12 MR. DONALDSON: Thank you very much, your Honor.

13 As the Court is aware, the Court read the PSR, as we
14 all did, and the guideline range that came back from the PSR

15 was 63 to 78 months, similar to what we agreed to in our plea
16 agreement. The probation department recommended 63 months of
17 incarceration.

18 We are recommending -- requesting that the Court

19 sentence Ms. Day to 60 months, approximately three months below
20 what the probation department is recommending and which would
21 be the statutory minimum.
22 In our writing to the Court, we tried to provide the
23 Court a background of Ms. Days and, we hope, some indication of
24 why we believe 60 months is appropriate, rather than 63 months
25 or rather than a guidelines sentence.
