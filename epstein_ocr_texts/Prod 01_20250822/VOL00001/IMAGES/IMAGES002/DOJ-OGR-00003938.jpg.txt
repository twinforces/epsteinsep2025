Re: United States Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Response to Dkt. No. 227, Government’s April 21,2021 Letter re: Ms. Maxwell’s
Motions to Suppress

Dear Judge Nathan:

We write in response to the government’s Ictter about Ms. Maxwell*s pending motions
to suppress. and request for evidentiary hearing (Dkt. No. 227), and this Court’s order stating
an. intent to, defer résolution of those motions and’that request until after the trial on the non-
perjury counts. (Dkt. No. 2311)..Although we appreciate the need.to streamline the: pretrial
process and the desire to cfficiently:resolve the pending disputes, we do not agree that the
government’s Ictter' provides, an adequate basis to defer resolution of Ms. Maxwell’s:motions.
We understand. the: Court’s desire to: maintain the status: quo relating to: the defense:motions,
but. the government’s response gives Ms. Maxwell no confidenec that; the government shares
this understanding. Indeed, the. government’s‘vague assurances are insufficient:to safeguard
Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights, to guarantee the government. will not benefit from its
unconstitutional conduct, and’to ensure that Ms. Maxwell’s is not deprived of duc ‘process
through the introduction. and use of evidence:that itselfwas obtained in violation of duc

process.
