If disclosure of the witness and. cxhibit:lists were by themselves sufficient to give Ms.
Maxwell notice of the specific: co-conspirator'statements the government intends’to admit at trial,
this Court:would not have separately ordered the government to ‘disclose “co-conspirator
statements.” Jd. But-that’s not. what the ‘Court did.

‘of alleged.co-conspirator statements, The Supreme Court’s decision, in Bourjaily v. United States
requires the Court.to determine, by. a’preponderance of the evidence, whether statements, of a co=
conspirator are admissible under Rule 80:1(d)(2)(E). 483 U.S. 17:1,175-76 (1.987). In-making this
determination, the Court must, find.that a, conspiracy existed, that its members included the
deéclarant,and the party against whom the statement is offered, and, that.the statement was made
during the course of and. in furtherance ofithe conspiracy. Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at.175.

Ifthe government does not disclose what co-conspirator statements it intends to offer, as
this Court already ordered the government to do by October Ll, then: Ms. Maxwell will be unable
to. file a motion in, limine by October 18 challenging the admissibility ‘of the co-conspirator
statements ‘and thereby put-the government fo its burden of proof and cnsure this Court; is able to
discharge its gatekeeping function. See Bourjaily, 483 U.S. at 175-76. Although:the government
may-not wish to give Ms. Maxwell the required. notice, this Court’has already. entered its order.

The government’s letter offers no reason, much less a compelling reason, for'this Court to
reconsider its order. The government has not even attempted to identify “controlling law or
factual, matters. which, it;belicves the court overlooked and,that might:reasonably be expected to
alter the court’s decision.” Berger, 188 F. Supp. 2d.at'328-39. And that’s because ‘the, Court’

didn’t overlook,anything. The parties bricfed this: issue in their joint-letter regarding pretrial.
