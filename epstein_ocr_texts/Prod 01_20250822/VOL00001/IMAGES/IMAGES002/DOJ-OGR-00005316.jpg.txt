34. What are your hobbies, major interests, recreational pastimes, and leisure-time activities?

35. Have you ever followed a criminal case in the media? If so, what case?

36. Are you a member of any clubs or organizations to which you contribute time or money?

FINAL QUESTION

37. I have tried to direct your attention in these questions and through the questionnaire you
filled out to possible reasons why you might not be able to sit as a fair and impartial juror.
Apart from any prior question, do you have the slightest doubt in your mind, for any reason
whatsoever, that you will be able to serve conscientiously, fairly, and impartially in this
case and to render a true and just verdict without fear, favor, sympathy, or prejudice, and
according to the law as it will be explained?
