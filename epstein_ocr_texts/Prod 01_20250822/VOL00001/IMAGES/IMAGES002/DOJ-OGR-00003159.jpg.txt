establish a prima facie violation of the fair cross-section requirement: (1) the excluded group is
“distinctive”; (2) “representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair
and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community;” and (3) the
“underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.”

C. Discussion

The Government’s decision to seek an indictment of the defendant from a grand jury sitting
in White Plains was entirely appropriate and consistent with the Constitution, the JSSA, and the
SDNY local rules. The defendant’s claims to the contrary rest on a faulty premise: That a
defendant who is likely to be tried in the Manhattan courthouse must be indicted by a grand jury
sitting in that same courthouse. That is not the law. See Section XI.C.1, infra.

That foundational error is fatal to the defendant’s fair cross-section claim. When the proper
comparators are considered—the White Plains Master (or Qualified) Wheels to the voting age
population of the counties from which juries in White Plains are drawn, rather than the defendant’s
apples-to-oranges comparison of the White Plains Qualified Jury Wheel to the population of the
Manhattan “Division”’—the defendant fails to establish unfair underrepresentation under the
second prong of the Duren test. Moreover, the defendant has not established that any disparity
resulted from systemic exclusion of a particular group. Accordingly, the motion should be denied.
