establish a. prima facic violation of the fair cross-section. requirement: (1) the excluded, group is
“distinctive”; (2) “representation. of this group ‘in'véenires from which jurics are sélected is not fair
and. reasonable: in. relation to the number of such persons in the community;” and (3) the
“underrepresentation is due: to'systematic exclusion of the group in'the jury-selection process.”

C. _ Discussion

The Government's decision to seck an indictment of the defendant from.a, grand jury’ sitting’
‘in White Plains was entircly: appropriate and. consistent with. the Constitution, the JSSA, and the:
‘SDNY local rules. The defendant’s claims to the contrary rest, on a faulty premise: That a.
defendant, who, is likely to be triéd:in the Manhattan. courthouse must, be indictéd by a grand jury’
sitting.in that same courthouse. ‘That is not‘the law. See:Section XLC.L, infra.

That foundational crror is.fatal'to the defendant’s fair cross-section claim. When the‘proper:
comparators. are: considcred—the. White Plains Master (or Qualified) Wheels to the voting. age
population of the counties from,which juries in, White Plains:are-drawn, rather than the defendant’s
apples-to-oranges comparison of the ‘White Plains Qualified Jury Whcel to the population of the
Manhattan. “Division”—the defendant fails to ‘establish unfair underrepresentation. under the
second prong of the Duren test. Morcover, the defendant has not.cstablished that, any’ disparity’
resulted:from systemic exclusion ofa particular group. Accordingly; the:motion should. be denied.

1. The Defendant ‘Was Properly Indicted by a Grand Jury Sitting in
White Plains

At. the heart of ‘the defendant’s fair cross-section claim is her contention. that the

Government secking an indictment from a grand jury: sitting in White Plains—which'was the only.
