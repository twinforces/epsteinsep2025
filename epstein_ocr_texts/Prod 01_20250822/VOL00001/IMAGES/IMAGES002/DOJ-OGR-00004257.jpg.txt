“premature” because the defense had not yet decided whether to call the expert and explaining that
“Talllowing [the] defendant to defer the provision of such discovery until a final determination
regarding whether or not [to] put an expert witness on the stand would seem to frustrate” the goal
of allowing the Government a fair opportunity to prepare). The Government further notes that the
defense’s proposed disclosure date would not provide sufficient time for the Government to locate
a rebuttal expert if appropriate or to provide notice of that rebuttal expert to the defense. Because
experts are typically not available on a matter of weeks’ notice, it cannot be the case that the
defense will wait to review Jencks Act materials before contacting and retaining experts; there is
no basis for delaying disclosure of this information to the Government, particularly given the delay
this will cause to resolving any potential Daubert issues before trial.

In addition, the Government proposes that the defense provide a proposed witness list and
witness statements, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.2, and disclosures pursuant
to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(b)(1)(A) and 16(b)(1)(B) by November 1, 2021, or 4
weeks in advance of trial. This deadline will provide the defense with ample time to determine
what, if any, defense witnesses may testify at trial. This deadline will also permit the Government
adequate time to review these materials and raise any appropriate objections or motions in advance
of trial.
