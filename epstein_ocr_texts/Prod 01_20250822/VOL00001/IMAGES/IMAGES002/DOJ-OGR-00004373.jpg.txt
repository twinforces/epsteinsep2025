Villafafia, Menchel, left the mecting after almost no discussion, leaving Villafafia “shocked and.
stunned.”

Menchcl told OPR. that he. did not recall the July 26, 2007 mecting. Noncthcless, he
strongly disputed Villafana’ s. description of events, asserting that it would. have been. “directly at
leave without discussion, “Acosta told OPR that. he had “decided and ‘endorsed: this resolution at
some point,” but: he did ‘not recall. being aware that Menchel, was going to announce the decision,
at the July26 niecting; in addition, although. Acosta did nottrccall the circumstances of. Menchel’s
relaying of that decision, he said it “would-have been consistent-with” his: decision for Menchel to
do so, ‘Neither Sloman. nor Louric recalled. the mecting. The FBI casc agent: recalled attending a.
mecting at the USAO in Miami, with her co-case agent, and. supervisors, together with, Villafafia,
Lourie (by: telephone), Menchel, and.Sloman, at’ which they discussed how: to proeced with the
Epstein case. According ‘to the case agent, at this mecting the FBI insisted that, Epstein be:
registered for life as.a sexual. offender, and.the:co-case agent advocated. for'waiting until the court
had. ruled on the USAO’s. ability to obtain: Epstcin’s computer equipment.

Regardless of cxactly’ how Acosta’s decision. regarding the two-year ‘term was
communicated, to Villafaha and. the FBI agents, and regardless of ‘who initially proposed the
specific term, ‘the record shows: that Acosta ultimately ‘made: the ‘decision. to offer Epstein a
resolution that included.a two-year term of. imprisonment, as he acknowledged. 1

Villafafia asserted. that she was not: consulted about the: specific two-ycar term before the
decision was made.” Villafafia told OPR. that she had: worked. hard-to develop a strong case, and.

did not ask for an explanation because she accepted his statement that it was Acosta’s decision.
Villafaita described.the proposal as “random,” and.told OPR, “[WJe’re all [sentencing] guidelines
