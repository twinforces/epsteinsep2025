Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 22 of 34

Ata minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a
question was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of.a full factual record at
trial. See, ¢.g., United States: v..Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 808 (2d Cir. 1992). The evidence: at.
trial may shed further light on, whether the questions:posed. were objectively ambiguous in
context or Whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In.any event, the Court has, closely
‘considered cach of'the categorics of questions that: Maxwell argues are ambiguous. ‘None ofthe
alleged. ambiguitics Maxwell identifics rise’to, the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The
context of the questions ‘and answers, in.conjunction-with the Government’s. evidence, could Icad
a:reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are
questions for the jury in.all but the most, extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s
role on the limited pretrial ‘record.

B. A:reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material.

Maxwell.also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of'the.
allegedly: false statements were material;to the defamation action. Ina civil deposition, a
statement is ‘material if it has,a natural tendency to influcnee the court or if'a. truthful answer
might:reasonably Icad to the: discovery:of admissible evidence. United States-v. Gaudin, 515
US. 506,509. (1995); United States v.-Kross, 14 F.3d.75.1, 753-54 (2d Cir. 1994). Like knowing
falsity, materiality is an element of the offense and,thus ordinarily must: be “decided. by the jury,
not the court.” Johnson v. United States, 520.U.S. 461, 465 (1997). Onily:the most. extraordinary

The ‘charged.statements do not fall, within this narrow exception. Maxwell contends that:
