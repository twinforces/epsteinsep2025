Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 22 of 34

At a minimum, Maxwell’s motion is premature. Courts typically evaluate whether a
question was fundamentally ambiguous only after the development of a full factual record at
trial. See, e.g., United States v. Markiewicz, 978 F.2d 786, 808 (2d Cir. 1992). The evidence at
trial may shed further light on whether the questions posed were objectively ambiguous in
context or whether Maxwell subjectively understood them. In any event, the Court has closely
considered each of the categories of questions that Maxwell argues are ambiguous. None of the
alleged ambiguities Maxwell identifies rise to the level supporting dismissal of the charges. The
context of the questions and answers, in conjunction with the Government’s evidence, could lead
a reasonable juror to conclude that the statements were perjurious. Truth and falsity are
questions for the jury in all but the most extreme cases. The Court declines to usurp the jury’s
role on the limited pretrial record.

B. A reasonable juror could conclude that Maxwell’s statements were material

Maxwell also argues that the perjury counts should be dismissed because none of the
allegedly false statements were material to the defamation action. Ina civil deposition, a
statement is material if it has a natural tendency to influence the court or if a truthful answer
might reasonably lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. United States v. Gaudin, 515
U.S. 506, 509 (1995); United States v. Kross, 14 F.3d 751, 753-54 (2d Cir. 1994). Like knowing
falsity, materiality is an element of the offense and thus ordinarily must be “decided by the jury,
not the court.” Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 465 (1997). Only the most extraordinary
circumstances justify departure from this general rule. United States v. Forde, 740 F. Supp. 2d
406, 412 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (citing Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 522-23).

The charged statements do not fall within this narrow exception. Maxwell contends that
the questions did not relate to the sex trafficking and sexual abuse allegations at the center of the
