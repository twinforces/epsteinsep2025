victims deserve to: be: treated. with, fairness and respect, and to be conferred ‘with on the criminal.
case, not just because the CV.RA ‘requires it, but because: it’s the right: thing'to:do.” During oral
argument.on January. 16, 2020, the government. apologized. for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:

The issue is whether. or not the office was fully transparent. with
Ms. Wild about what.it is that was going:on with .respect:toithe NPA,
and they made a mistake in. causing her to belicve that the case:was
ongoing ‘when in fact. the NPA had been signed. The government
should have communicated in a straightforward and transparent way
with.Ms. Wild, and forthat, we are genuinely sorry.°?

On April.1.4, 2020, a divided pancl, ofthe Court-of Appeals for the Eleventh-Circuit denied,
Wild’s petition for a writ. of mandamus, concluding’ that “the CVRA does not:apply: before: the
commencement of criminal :proccedings—and-thus, on the facts. of this casé, docs not*provide the
petitioner. here with any judicially enforccable rights. 394 The court conducted a thorough analysis
‘of the language of the statute, the legislative history, and ‘previous: court decisions. The court
distinguished Jn re Dean as “dictum” consisting of a.“three-sentence discussion . _ devoid of any’
analysis of the :;CVRA’s text, history, or structural ‘underpinnings.” The court noted. that. its
interpretation. of the CVRA. was consistént with. the Department’s 2010 OLE opinion concerning,
victim standing under the CVRA.and the Department's efforts in “implementing regulations.”
Finally, the: court raised separation of powers concerns with Wild’s (and the dissenting judge’s)
‘interpretation, of victim, standing under the CVRA, ‘noting that such an, interpretation would.
interfere with;prosecutorial. diserction.

Nevertheless, ‘the, court was. highly critical. ofthe government’s conduct in ‘the. underlying,
case, stating that the government * ‘[s]eemingly . . defer[red] to Epstcin’s lawyers” regarding
information it: provided:victims about the NPA. and that its “efforts seem to: have g graduated. from,
passive nondisclosure to (or at Icast.close to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded.that.
although:it-“scems, obvious” that the government “should have consulted :with:petitioner (and. other
victims) before 'négotiating and executing Epstcin’s NPA,” the court could, not.conclude that the
government'was obligated to do-so. In.addition, the dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly
worded. opinion asserting that:the majority’s statutory interprctation was “contorted” because the

“plain and unambiguous text of the CVRA does not. include [a] post-indictment temporal.
restriction.”

On May 5, 2020, Wild filed.a-petition ‘for rehearing en banc. On August'7, 2020, the court
‘granted, the petition for achearing,en hance and vacated ‘the panel’ 's. opinion; as of the date of this
Report, a’bricfing schedule ‘has been, issucd and. oral, argument is sct for December 3, 2020.
