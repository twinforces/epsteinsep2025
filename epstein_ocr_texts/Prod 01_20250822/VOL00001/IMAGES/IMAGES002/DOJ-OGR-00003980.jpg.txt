Requests 9-1]
Requests 9, 10, and 1 1lseck evidence for inspection in. advance of trial. A. subpoena issued
pursuant to Rule 17(c)(1) “may ‘order the witness to produce: designated “books, papers,

3599 5

documents, data, or other objects” 'so long as they are “evidentiary.” Bowman Dairy Co..v:
United Statés, 341 U.S. 214, 219:(1951). Rule 17(e)(1) further provides. that “[t]he court may
direct the witness to: produce'the designated items in, court before trial or before they are to be
offered in evidence.” When the items, arrive, the court may permit the ‘partics and their attorneys
to inspect all. orpart of them. .Jd.

The Rule operates to “expedite the trial’ by providing a,time and place’before trial for
the inspection of subpocnaéd materials,” rather than.“provide a meanis of:discovery. for criminal
cases.” United States v..Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 698-99 (1974) (citing Bowman Dairy, 341 U.S. at
220)) (emphasis added). Here, ’Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena strictly adheres to that which Rule 17
allows: production of admittedly relevant and admissible, items of evidence in advance of trial.
Item 9, the:journal, purports to be an account of alleged-victim 2’s intcractions with Epstcin that

form the basis of multiple counts in,the indictment. It 1s, exculpatory: because the journal, contains
no reference to. Ms. Maxwell. Partial-pages of the journal:were produced in. civil litigation
against Epstcin, not to ‘help Ms. Maxwell. Inspection. of the entire journal is ‘necessary. to
establish whether the journal. is authentic and, complete and'whether or not: spoliation has
occurred. This examination requires the services of.a qualified. forensic document examiner.and
cannot-be performed:in the middle of trial without a significant disruption in‘the proceedings.

from Epstcin and Ms. Maxwell, BSF’s argument:that:the journal is irrelevant or inadmissible is
