Requests 9-11

Requests 9, 10, and 11seek evidence for inspection in advance of trial. A subpoena issued
pursuant to Rule 17(c)(1) “may order the witness to produce designated ‘books, papers,
documents, data, or other objects’” so long as they are “evidentiary.” Bowman Dairy Co. v.
United States, 341 U.S. 214, 219 (1951). Rule 17(c)(1) further provides that “[t]he court may
direct the witness to produce the designated items in court before trial or before they are to be
offered in evidence.” When the items arrive, the court may permit the parties and their attorneys
to inspect all or part of them. Jd.

The Rule operates to “expedite the trial by providing a time and place before trial for
the inspection of subpoenaed materials,” rather than “provide a means of discovery for criminal
cases.” United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 698-99 (1974) (citing Bowman Dairy, 341 US. at
220)) (emphasis added). Here, Ms. Maxwell’s subpoena strictly adheres to that which Rule 17
allows: production of admittedly relevant and admissible items of evidence in advance of trial.
Item 9, the journal, purports to be an account of alleged victim 2’s interactions with Epstein that
form the basis of multiple counts in the indictment. It is exculpatory because the journal contains
no reference to Ms. Maxwell. Partial pages of the journal were produced in civil litigation
against Epstein, not to help Ms. Maxwell. Inspection of the entire journal is necessary to
establish whether the journal is authentic and complete and whether or not spoliation has
occurred. This examination requires the services of a qualified forensic document examiner and
cannot be performed in the middle of trial without a significant disruption in the proceedings.
Given that alleged victim 2 placed the document in issue when she was trying to collect money
from Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, BSF’s argument that the journal is irrelevant or inadmissible is
