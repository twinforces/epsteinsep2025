Individual voir dire is appropriate and’within the court’s discretion ‘in cases like this
where the potential jurypool has been ‘exposed to extensive pretrial.publicity and may harbor.
‘prejudice against the defendant, and where’ the allegations touch on, issues that ‘are potentially
inflammatory. Sce Stewart, 433 F.3d.at 303; see also Wnitéd States ¥. Rahman,189 F.3d 88, 122
(2d Cir. 1999). ‘Using individual voir dire, in addition to.a juror questionnaire, ‘is necessary in
‘this case (i)'to expose potential biases by maximizing’ the likelihood that;members of the venire
‘will. respond honestly to. questions, and (ii)'to avoid. contaminating unbiased. members of the
‘venire ‘when, other. members disclose prior knowledge of: prejudicial information or blurt out a
‘prejudicial remark. As the Supreme Court has stated:
It: may sometimes be necessary to question. on, Voir dire. prospective
jurors individually or in. small. groups, both to ‘maximize. the
likelihood. that members of the venire will respond. honestly to
questions concerning bias, and to avoid. contaminating unbiased
members of the venire when other’ members: disclose ‘prior
knowledge of prejudicial. information.
