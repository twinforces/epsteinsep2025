Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 342 Filed 10/13/21 Page5of17
Individual voir dire is appropriate and within the court’s discretion in cases like this
where the potential jury pool has been exposed to extensive pretrial publicity and may harbor
prejudice against the defendant, and where the allegations touch on issues that are potentially
inflammatory. See Stewart, 433 F.3d at 303; see also United States v. Rahman,189 F.3d 88, 122
(2d Cir. 1999). Using individual voir dire, in addition to a juror questionnaire, is necessary in
this case (1) to expose potential biases by maximizing the likelihood that members of the venire
will respond honestly to questions, and (ii) to avoid contaminating unbiased members of the
venire when other members disclose prior knowledge of prejudicial information or blurt out a
prejudicial remark. As the Supreme Court has stated:
It may sometimes be necessary to question on voir dire prospective
jurors individually or in small groups, both to maximize the
likelihood that members of the venire will respond honestly to
questions conceming bias, and to avoid contaminating unbiased
members of the venire when other members disclose prior
knowledge of prejudicial information.

This followed closely on the heels of an avalanche of media reports preceding and following

Epstein’s arrest in July 2019 and following his death in August 2019. A tsunami of reporting in
every conceivable form — newspapers, magazines, books, television, radio, video streaming

services, podcasts, social media platforms — has broadcast this case locally, nationally, and

globally. Without a doubt, and without any credible evidentiary basis, Ms. Maxwell has been
