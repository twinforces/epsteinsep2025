Defense Expert Disclosures

The government's proposal that Ms. Maxwell disclose any expert testimony eight
weeks in advance of trial, prior even to the prosecution's disclosure of the 3500/Jencks Act
materials or government exhibits, puts the proverbial cart before the horse. All proposed
opinion testimony must be "relevant to the task at hand.” Daubert v. Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, 509 U.S. 579, 597 (1993). To be reliable, the proposed expert must have,
inter alia, "applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.” United States
v. Williams, 506 F.3d 151, 160 (2d Cir. 2007) (emphasis supplied, citations omitted). Any
defense expert that relates to the testimony of the accusers or 404(b) witnesses cannot possibly
be disclosed before Ms. Maxwell has even been provided access to that testimony.

To illustrate the point, one need look only at the government's expert disclosure. The
proposed testimony for the government's expert, although purportedly not based on a review
of the facts of this case, nevertheless appears to have been crafted by the government with full
knowledge of the accusers’ specific allegations. For example, the government proffers that
their expert will testify that "minor victims ... may not identify themselves as victims of abuse
while it is ongoing, and may not recognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood."
Clearly, the accusers must have represented facts to support these contentions or else there
would be no grounds to admit this "blind" expert opinion testimony. Ms. Maxwell cannot be
expected to hire experts and divine what would be relevant to this case before she is provided
the statements by these accusers, whose credibility will be the central question for the jury in
this case.

The Court originally ordered the defense expert disclosures four weeks before trial and
