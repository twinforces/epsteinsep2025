statements cannot, as a matter of law, support a perjury conviction. She has failed to do so, and
her motion should be denied.

1. April 2016 Deposition

At the April 2016 deposition, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant about how Giuffre
came to Epstein’s home (Ex. 10 at 14:9-17:4), whether hired massage therapists engaged in sexual
activity with Epstein (id. at 51:13-55:16), and the defendant’s knowledge of Epstein’s Florida

me, I will not be trapped.’’), 138:6 (“Define relationship.”), 244:22-23 (“You are not asking me a
good question, sorry.’’).

defendant brought women to Epstein, which the defendant resisted by observing that she hired
“people across the board” to “work for Jeffrey.” (Ud. at 245:7-18). Guiuffre’s counsel asked
whether any minors worked as exercise instructors or masseuses at Epstein’s home, and the
defendant testified that they were all adults except for Giuffre, who she acknowledged at least
claimed to have been seventeen. (/d. at 246:18-251:12). Giuffre’s counsel then asked questions
about whether Epstein had a “sexual preference for underage minors,” which drew objections from
