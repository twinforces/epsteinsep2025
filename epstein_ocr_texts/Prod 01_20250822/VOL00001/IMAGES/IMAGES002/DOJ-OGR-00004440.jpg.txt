release program:

It appears that, since ‘Day. 1, Goldberger and ‘Krisher [sie]... . have
been scheming to.get:Epstein out on'work release. For example, the
indictment incorrectly’ charges Epstein, for an offense that would
have made.him incligible for work release if it had been charged
correctly:, (Remember that Krisher [sic] also-went along with. ‘letting
us. believe that Epstein was. pleading to a registrable offense when
Epstcin’s folks and Krisher [sic] belicved that . .. the offense was
not :registrable;) Krisher [sic] and. Goldberger also. told ‘us. that
Epstcin would. be: housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not. the
Stockade, but he: would not-have: been cligible for work: release if at
the jail... .

As part, of his work. release, Epstein has hired, off-duty’ Sheriff's
deputies to provide him. with “protection.” It appears. that he is
paying between. $3000. and. $41.00. per-weck for this service, despite
thework release rules barring anyone ftom:the Sheriff’s Office-(and
‘the Sheriff's, Office itself) from, having “‘any business transactions.
‘with ‘inmates . ... while they:are in the custody or supervision of the
Sheriff... .””

Villafafia added that she and-her immediate supervisor belicved, thatthe USAO “should not budge
on the 24-hour-a-day incarecration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafaria also
pointed out'that:two victims had brought suit.against:the USAO “for:failing to keep them informed

about’ the. investigation,” and the office had “an obligation to inform all ‘of the ‘victims ‘upon.
Epstein’s release.”

On December 11, 2008, Villafafia. wrote to the: Corrections ‘Division, of the Palm. Beach.
County Sheriff's Office.to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not:cligible for:work’release
and ‘to alert. the Sheriffs Office that Epstcin’s, work release application. contained several
inaccuracies and. omitted ‘relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstcin’s application.
