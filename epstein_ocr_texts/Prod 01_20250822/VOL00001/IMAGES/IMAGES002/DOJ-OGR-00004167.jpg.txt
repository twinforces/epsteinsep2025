Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 285 Filed 05/20/21 Page 32 of 34

The government of course does not suggest that any of its agents, such as AUSA
BEE. Would be willing to provide an affidavit to Maxwell or otherwise speak with defense
counsel absent compulsion from this Court. Indeed, the government conspicuously did not attach
to its Response any affidavits about its interactions with Boies Schiller.

It’s plain, therefore, that this Court should hold an evidentiary hearing and effectuate
Maxwell’s constitutional right to compulsory process because that is the only way to get to the
truth.??

Conclusion

For these reasons, as well as those given in the Motion, this Court should: (1) suppress all
evidence the government obtained from Boies Schiller and any other evidence derived
therefrom; or (2) suppress the April and July 2016 depositions and all evidence derived
therefrom; and (3) dismiss Counts Five and Six. Maxwell requests an evidentiary hearing on this
Motion.

» Tf this Court concludes an affidavit is required before it holds a hearing, Maxwell requests
leave, as she did in her Motion, to attempt to obtain such an affidavit. But if, as is likely, none of the
participants—e.g., AUSA gg, AUSA , Boies, Edwards, Skinner, Pottinger—voluntarily
provides an affidavit, Maxwell invokes her constitutional right to compulsory process and this Court’s
authority to compel testimony in support of her defense. U.S. CONST. amend. VI.
