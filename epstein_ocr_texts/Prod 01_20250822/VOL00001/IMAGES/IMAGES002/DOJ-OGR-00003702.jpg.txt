(PGG), 2014 WL 3057917, at.*3 (S.D:N.Y: July 7, 2014) (collecting cases). The Court therefore
denies. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous counts without prejudice.
‘VIII. The parties shall negotiate all remaining disclosures

Maxwell, moves'to compel the Government to produce certain, documents'she belicves it
has in.its possession and has failed'to produce. She.also secks accelerated disclosure of the
Government’s ‘witness list, Jencks Act.material, Brady and.Giglio material, co-conspirator
statements, and Rule 404(b) material. Based. on the: Governments response in bricfing and
letters the partics have since submitted.to the Court, it appears that most ofthese requests have
been overtaken by events. Accordingly, although the Court concludes that. Maxwell ‘is not,
entitled, to, expedite'this discovery based on. the arguments in her:motion papers, the Court will
require the: parties to confer on.an overall schedule.for all remaining pretrial. disclosures.

A. The Court accepts, the Government’s representations that it has. disclosed ‘all
Brady and Giglio. Material

The Supreme Court’s decisions in.Bradyv.. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1.963) and Giglio. y.
United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972): require the Government to disclose, to defendants certain.
evidence that will aid their-defense. Brady requires. disclosure of exeulpatory*evidenec. Under
Giglio, the Government has a.duty to'produce “not only cxculpatory:material, but also
information that could be used to impeach a.key government:witness.” United States 'v. Coppa,
267 F.3d 132, 135-(2d Cir. 2001) (citing Giglio, 405 U.S. at 154). Asa general rule, “Brady and
its progeny do‘not require immediate disclosure of all exculpatory and impeachment:material,
upon request by a defendant.” Jd. at.146. “[A]s long as a defendant possessés Brady evidence 'in
time for its effective:use, the government has.not deprived. the defendant of due process of law

‘simply because it did not produce the evidenee sooner.” Jd, at 144.
