contacts with Boies Schiller on the topic of Epstein any more than he shared the contacts on the
topic of Maxwell—he simply denied any contacts had occurred, something that is demonstrably
false.

Whether Boies Schiller “pitched” a prosecution of Epstein only or of Epstein and
Maxwell as a duo, AUSA JJ misled Judge McMahon by denying there was any “pitch”
whatsoever.

III. The Materiality of the Government’s False Statements.

The government halfheartedly suggests that “there is no reason to believe that a
description of the February 2016 meeting would have been material to Chief Judge McMahon’s
analysis of whether she was facing a ‘Chemical Bank kind of situation.’”” Resp. at 91. Hardly. In
fact, there is every reason to believe Judge McMahon would have refused to authorize the
subpoena if AUSA gg had not so misled her.

How do we know? Because Judge McMahon said so—at least twice.

Judge McMahon first made this clear by haling AUSA gg back in for one and
only one reason: To ask him about the contacts between Boies Schiller and his office before
November 2018. So crucial was this question to Judge McMahon’s decision that the transcript of
the AUSA J sccond appearance before her is just three pages long. Mot. Ex. E.

Judge McMahon made her thinking even clearer in her written order authorizing the
subpoena. Mot. Ex. G. On page 12 of her opinion, when attempting to reconcile Chemical Bank
with Martindell,”° Judge McMahon found that “nothing in the record suggests that the
Government’s investigation in this case was occasioned by Boies Schiller—a point to which I
will return later in this opinion.” Mot. Ex. G, p 12.
