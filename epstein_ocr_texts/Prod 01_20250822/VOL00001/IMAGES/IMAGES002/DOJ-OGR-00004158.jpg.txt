contacts with Boies Schiller on.the topic of Epstein, any‘more than he.shared.the contaets on.the’
topic of Maxwell—he simply denied any contacts had occurred, something that is demonstrably
‘false.

Whether, Boies, Schiller “pitched” a‘prosecution.of Epstein, only or of Epstein and
Maxwell.as.a duo, AUSA[—___] misled Judge McMahon. by denying there was any “pitch”
whatsoever,

Ill, The Materiality of the Government's False Statements.

The government:halfheartedly. suggests that “there is ‘no reason to believe that a
description. of the February 2016 meeting would.have been material to Chief Judge McMahon’s
analysis of whether:she was facing a ‘Chemical Bank kind of situation.” Resp. at 91. Hardly. In
fact, there. is everi: reason to believe Judge McMahon would have refused to authorize the
subpoena if AUSA[-—______] had not so misled-her.

How’ do'we know? Because Judge McMahon. said so—at least twice.

Judge McMahon first made'this clear by:haling AUSA[—___] back.in. for one and
‘only one
November 2018. So, crucial was this question to Judge: McMahon’s decision that the transcript of
the AUSA[_________] second appearance before her is just three pages long. Mot. Ex. E.

Judge McMahon made her thinking even clearer in her written, order authorizing the:
subpoena. Mot. Ex. G. On page. 12 of her opinion, when attempting to reconcile Chemical Bank
with Martindell,?° Judge McMahon. found that “nothing in. the record suggests that the
Government’s investigation.in this:case'was occasioned by Boies Schiller—a point-to. which. |

will:return later in this opinion.” Mot. Ex. G, p 12.
