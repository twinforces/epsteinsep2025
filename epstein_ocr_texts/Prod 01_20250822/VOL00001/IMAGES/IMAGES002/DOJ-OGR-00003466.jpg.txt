Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 290 of 348

the’ “the ¢ case’ Was: open. it’s never. r been, shut. down.”

OPR found:no evidence'that the FBI’s victim letters were drafted with the intent'to. mislead.
the victims about the: status of the fedcral investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language:
generated by the VNS was generic template language in-use nationwide at the time and identical,
to ‘that; contained, in, standard. form notification. letters the FBI generated and, distributed. from,
August. 2006 through the 2007 signing of the NPA.*!* Newertheless, the FBI’s letters omitted
important information about the status of the: casé because they failed to notify the victims that a
federal prosecution would. go forward -only if Epstein failed to fulfill his obligations ‘under. an.
agrecment he had reached ‘with the USAO. ‘Victims: receiving the FBI’s Ictter would logically
conclude that the federal, government ‘was continuing to gather evidence to support a. federal
prosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the CVRA litigation that.her ‘ ‘understanding of
this Ictter was that [her] case was still being investigated and the FBI and.prosecutors were moving
forward on the:Federal. prosecution. of Epstein. for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the
fact that the USAO had agreed to.end its federal investigation in September 2007 eventually came
to light, the statement inthe subsequent.lctters contributed,to victims’ and the public’s.conclusions
that the government had purposefully kept victims in the dark.

In:sum,. OPR concludes that the statement in. the FBI victim. Ictters that the matter was
“currently under investigation:” was not falsc because the USAO and the FBI did continue to
investigate and. prepare fora prosecution, of Epstein. ‘The letters, however, risked misleading the
victims, ‘and contributed to victim frustration and confusion, because the letters did not. provide:
important information. that ‘would have advised victims of the actual status of the investigation.
Nonetheless, OPR. fouind no. evidence that Villafafia:or her supervisors participated in drafting,
those letters or were: aware of the content.of the FBI’s letters until. the Department gathered them.
‘for production in the CVRA litigation. The use ‘of FBI form ‘letters that gave: incomplete
‘information about the status of the investigation demonstrated ‘a. lack: of coordination, between the
federal ‘agencics ‘responsible for communicating’ with Epstcin’s victims and. showed. a lack’ of
attention. to and, oversight regarding Communication ‘with victims. Despite the fact that the case:
was:no longer on:the typical path. for:resolving federal investigations, form Ictters continued to be:
sent. without any review by prosccutors. or the case agents to determine: whether the information.
provided to the victims was appropriate under the circumstances.*!®

ad The-Department of Justice Inspector General’s, Audit Report of the, Department?s Victim Notification System,
indicates that letters the FBI system g generated :in 2006 contained stock: language for the:notification events, of “Initial
(Inyestigative /Agency)” and, “Under Iny estigation™ and letters generated 1 in: 2008, contained stock language for the
notification; events of ‘“Advice-of Victims Rights (Inv ests gativ ey? ‘and “Under Inv estigation.”

wns After Epstein entered his guilty pleas, the FBI. sent a similar form letter requesting “assistance and,
cooperation. while we are investigating the case” to thetwo-victims living outside the’ United States.
