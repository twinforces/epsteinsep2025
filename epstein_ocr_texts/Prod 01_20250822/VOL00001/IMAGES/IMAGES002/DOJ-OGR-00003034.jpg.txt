exercise its discretion to grant the Government’s application.” (/d. at 22). The Court further
concluded that “[t]he Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary circumstances,
which would entitle it to modification in any event.” (/d.). She also noted that “while in other

order, which itself prohibited further dissemination, and not including any other materials
associated with the Government’s application—with Boies Schiller. The relevant order was
