of: the “strategies” for. dealing with the victims’ fear was “to keep ‘them off the stand,” and he
generally remembered. discussions about resolving’ the Epstcin case in a way: that protected the
victims’ identities. In. addition, the CEOS Trial Attorney ‘who bricfly worked ‘with Villafafa on.
the case after the NPA. was signed told OPR. that :in her meetings ‘with some of. the victims, she:
formed the 1 impression that they were not.interested in, the prosecution, going forward. The CEOS
Trial, Attorney told OPR. that “[the victims] ‘would. have testified,” but. would. have required.an
extensive amount. of “victim ‘management” because! they ‘were “deeply embarrassed” about:
‘potentially being labeled, as Prostitutes. The CEOS. Trial Attorney also told 'OPR that “there were
obvious'weaknesses ‘in the case,” from an evidentiary perspective. ak

The contemporancous records also reflect discussions of, or references to, various legal
and factual issues or other concerns about the case. For example, in, an carly email to Menchcl,
Lourie noted that two key issues raised. by Villafafia’s proposed, charges were whether'the USAO
could prove. that Epstein. traveled. for the purpose of engaging’ in sex. acts, and. the fact that.some:
minor victims. had:told Epstein.they were:18. He later opined.to Acosta and Menchel that “there
is some’ risk: on some of the:statutes. [proposcd.in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum] as this is
uncharted territory to some degree:” In,his July 5,.2007 email-to Villafafia,’Menchcel, cited Acosta’s
and. Sloman’s “concerms about taking this case because of [the P]etit.policy and a number of Icgal
issues” and. Acosta’s concerns about’ “hurting Projeéet Safe Childhood.” Defense counsel raised
myriad legal.and factual challenges in-their voluminous Ictters to the USAO. Defense:submissions
attacked. the Icgal theorics for a, federal, ‘prosecution and detailed factors that’ could have
undermined, victims’ credibility, including victim statements favorable, to Epstcin, and evidence of
victim. drug and. alcohol ‘use, as well as the fact; that.some ‘victims ‘recruited other: victims and.
purportedly lied to Epstein, about their ages.

Acosta, also: recalled that: although his “team” had. expressed ‘concern, about. the “trial
Issucs,” his own, focus. had been. on. “the legal. side of things.” Notably, during his prior tenure: as
the Assistant Attorney General. in, charge of the: Department’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta. had.
been. involved..in. efforts to address scx trafficking. He told OPR. that one ofthe “background
issucs” that the Civil Rights Division addressed ‘under his. leadership, and which. influenced his
view of. the Epstein case, was the: distinction, ‘between. sex: trafficking and ‘solicitation. of'
prostitution. Specifically, he was concemed about avoiding the creation. of potentially unfavorable
federal preecdent:on the point of delineation between prostitution, which was traditionally. a matter:
of state Conecrn, and scx trafficking, ‘which remained a.developing area, of ‘federal ‘interest ‘in
2007.7!

alt In an.affidavit filed in-the CVRA litigation, the co-case agent: noted that in carly 2007, when ‘he located, a;
victim living, outside of the United States, she claimed only: to * “know: ‘Jeffrey. “Epstein,” and. stated ‘that she “moved,
away to, distance herself from this situation, * and “asked that [the agent] not bother ‘her-with this agains

ak In.April 2007, a‘victim who was represented by.an attorney paid. by Epstein participated ‘in a‘video-recorded.,
interview-with the FBI, with-her: attorney and-his inv estigator present. ‘This victiny denied being involved ing or being
avictim of,eriminal activ ‘ity. Later; the;victim obtained:new counsel_and joined the CVRA litigation:as * “Jane,Doe #2."
aly Inchis March.20, 201 | letter, addressed “To whom.it:may-concern,” and’published online in Zhe. Daily: Beust,
Acosta described “a’year-long assault on.the: prosecution and the prosecutors” by, “an.army, of legal superstars.” ‘Most
‘of the allegations madeiagainst the’prosecutors occurred. .after'the NPA. was signed:and.certainly ‘after Acosta.approved.,
