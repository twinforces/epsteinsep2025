as part of the very act charged, or, at least, proof of that act.” Quinones, 511 F.3d at 309 (internal

Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) allows for the admission of uncharged crimes, wrongs, or
other acts for purposes other than proving criminal propensity, “such as proving motive,
opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of
accident.” Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). The Second Circuit “has long adopted an ‘inclusionary’ approach
to the admission of uncharged crime evidence, under which evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, or
acts is admissible for any purpose other than to show a defendant’s criminal propensity.” United
States v. Paulino, 445 F.3d 211, 221 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where the
defendant claims her conduct has an innocent explanation, the admission of such evidence of other
acts is particularly appropriate. See, e.g., United States v. Zackson, 12 F.3d 1178, 1182 (2d Cir.
1993) (“Where a defendant claims that his conduct has an innocent explanation, prior act evidence
is generally admissible to prove that the defendant acted with the state of mind necessary to commit
the offense charged.”). Where evidence is offered for a proper purpose under Rule 404(b), it may
only be excluded if the probative value of the evidence is “substantially outweighed” by the danger
of unfair prejudice. /d. at 1182; see Fed. R. Evid. 403.

Until December 1, 2020, the Government was required to provide “reasonable notice of
the general nature of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial.” Fed. R. Evid.
404(b)(2)(A) (2011). On December 1, 2020, the rule was amended (the “2020 Amendments”) to
require the Government to also “articulate in the notice the permitted purpose for which the
prosecutor intends to offer the evidence and the reasoning that supports the purpose.” Fed. R.
