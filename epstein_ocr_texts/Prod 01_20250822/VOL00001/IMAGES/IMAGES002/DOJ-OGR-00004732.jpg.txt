(2d Cir. 2001) (prosecution must produce Giglio material “in time for its effective use at trial”).
Impeachment material simply does not warrant immediate disclosure. See, e.g., United States v.
Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 701 (1974) (“Generally, the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is
insufficient to require its production in advance of trial.”); United States v. Campo Flores, No. 15
Cr. 765 (PAC), 2016 WL 5946472, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 12, 2016) (“The Government has
represented that it will make impeachment material relating to its anticipated witnesses available

disclosure shortly before trial.”).

Although not essential to the timing analysis here, the Government notes that the defense
motion overstates the significance of the particular statements Minor Victim-4 made during the
USAO-SDFL’s investigation. The Government understands from its more recent interviews with
Minor Victim-4, the notes of which the Government will produce to the defense as part of Minor
Victim-4’s Giglio and Jencks Act material, that she was not asked any questions about the
defendant during her only interview in connection with the USAO-SDFL’s investigation, which
focused instead on Epstein and another of Epstein’s employees. Notably, though, when Minor
Victim-4 was deposed in connection with a civil lawsuit after she was interviewed during the
USAO-SDFL’s investigation but more than a decade before the defendant was indicted in this
case, Minor Victim-4 affirmatively stated that the defendant was one of the individuals who
scheduled her massage appointments with Epstein. Minor Victim-4 was not asked any follow-up
questions about the defendant during that deposition, but her prior consistent statement regarding
the defendant’s involvement in scheduling her massages severely undercuts the defense’s
suggestion that Minor Victim-4 entirely fabricated the defendant’s role in Epstein’s scheme after
the defendant was indicted in 2020. The Government fully intends to provide the defense with all
