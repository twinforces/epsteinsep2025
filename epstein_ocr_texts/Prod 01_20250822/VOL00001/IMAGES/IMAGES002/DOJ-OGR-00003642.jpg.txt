42. While the issues raised by Mr. Martin are valid, he never actually measures their
impact to determine if they meaningfully impact the demographics of the qualified jury wheel. If
he had done so, as I actually did and report above, he would have found the issues about which
he raises concerns explain relatively little of the absolute disparity in the representation of
African American and Hispanic individuals between the qualified jury wheel and the
community.

43. Mr. Martin’s declaration expends much effort in defining populations of persons in
the community who are not or cannot be in the master jury wheel (7.e., reason 2 above). This is
of little value. The issue is only whether and to what extent they are different, what is causing
them to be different, and to what extent it causes them to be different. Thus, the issue is not
whether someone is left out. For example, clearly persons in the community in 2020 who were
too young to register to vote on November 2016, or persons who moved into the area after
November 2016 are not on the November 1, 2016 voter registration lists. However, the issue is
not who is on the current voter registration list but was not on the November 1, 2016 voter
registration list. Rather, the question is what is causing the difference between the qualified jury
wheel—that is based on the November 1, 2016 voter population—and the benchmark for the
community—which is based on the 5-year ACS. Persons who move into White Plains are also
not in the benchmark computation. If we are to update the voter registration lists to match the
current community benchmarks (an impossible task) we would also need to update the
community benchmark. Mr. Martin presents the difference in the wheels based on the November
2016 voter registration lists and the benchmark based on the community demographics between
2014 and 2018. The relevant question is what factors cause the difference he presents, and to
what extent these factors cause the absolute disparity between the community benchmark and the
