comparator is the jury eligible population, of the five counties from, which the White Plains’Master
Wheel is. drawn.

The American Community Survey (“ACS”) 2018 data indicate that the jury cligible
population, for. the White Plains countics in.2018 was 12.45% Black: or African-American and,
14.12% Hispanic of Latino.” (See Siskin.Aff. at.f 19; see also Martin-Aff. at ¥ 21).

Once the:relevant comparators are defined, an,additional threshold question.is'the:statistical,
method by:which. to: compare 'them. Courts have applicd different approaches over time, such. as
the statistical. decision theory, the comparative disparity:thcory, and the absolute disparitythcory..
See Rioux, 97 F.3d.at 655. Although no method is perfect, see Berghuis vs Smith, 559 U.S. 314,
329 (2010), the Sécond Circuit has made clear that the comparative disparity theory is disfavored,
and. strongly suggested that the absolute ‘disparity theory is'gencrally appropriate, see Rioux, 97
F.3d at 655-56; sce‘also United States 'v:. Barnes, 520 F. Supp. 24/5 1.0,.514 (S-D.N.Y.. 2007) (“[T]Jhe
absolute disparity approach, is the ‘primary approach used in. this Cireuit.”).

The “absolute disparity” approach,measures the absolute numerical difference between the
distinctive group’s, representation in'the community. ‘population, andthe’ group’ s, representation ‘in,
the relevant jury pool. See. Rioux, 97 F.3d at 655; United States v. Barlow, 732 F. Supp..2d 1, 30-
31 (E.D.N.Y. 2010), aff'd 479 F. App’x, 372, 373 (2d Cir, 2012). For example, if Blacks
‘represented, 10% of the community population but,only 2% of the relevant jury‘pool, the “absolute
disparity” would. be 8%.

There ‘is no specific numerical threshold that. constitutes unacceptable disparity under, the

“absolute disparity” method. “[P]erfcetly proportional representation is not required, since no
