I. SUPPRESSION OF THE EXHIBITS IS CONTRARY TO WELL-
ESTABLISHED SECOND CIRCUIT LAW

At this point, everyone associated with this litigation knows the definition of a “judicial
document.” In this Circuit, “there is a presumption in favor of public inspection and copying of
any item entered into evidence at a public session of a trial.” Application of Nat'l Broad. Co.,
Inc., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. 1980). Moreover, after “the evidence has become known to the
members of the public, including representatives of the press, through their attendance at a public
session of court, it would take the most extraordinary circumstances to justify restrictions on the
opportunity of those not physically in attendance at the courtroom to see and hear the evidence,
when it is in a form that readily permits sight and sound reproduction.” /d. Where the requested
documents were introduced at trial, the strong weight to be accorded the public right of access to
judicial documents was largely derived from the role those documents played in determining
litigants' substantive rights -- conduct at the heart of Article III -- and from the need for public
monitoring of that conduct. United States v. Graham, 257 F.3d 143, 151 (2d Cir. 2001).

Suppression of any exhibit that contains an accuser’s name in this case is doubly
problematic -- many of the anticipated exhibits are “judicial documents” from other proceedings
that have previously been made public or documents already accessible by the public. There is
nothing confidential about the exhibits and neither the exhibits nor the names of the witnesses
should be redacted or suppressed.

Il. PRE-TRIAL RULING ON “PRIOR CONSISTENT STATEMENTS”

INAPPROPRIATE

The government seeks a pre-trial ruling that certain unspecified "prior consistent
statements" of the accusers will be admissible at trial if the defense "challenges the credibility of
the testimony" of the accusers in some unspecified way. Mot. at 17. Under the government's
apparent view, any credibility challenge will permit any prior statement of the government's
