(Ex. 11 at 112:17-113:12).

The defendant argues that these questions were fundamentally ambiguous because the
deposition elsewhere discussed both sexual and professional massages. It was unclear, she
explains, what kind of massage the questioner meant. (Def. Mot. 4 at 17.) The defendant’s
argument is, yet again, misguided. This line of questioning used broad language, and at no point
during this set of questions did Giuffre’s counsel suggest that the questions were limited to sexual
or professional massages. Cf Lighte, 782 F.2d at 376 (concluding that the word “you” was
ambiguous when the prior two questions asked about the defendant “as an individual” and then
switched “without indication” to the defendant “as trustee”). The defendant’s answers were
unequivocal, with no expressions of confusion or internal contradictions. Cf Markiewicz, 978
F.2d at 809 (explaining that a question was ambiguous as to whether it asked about the deponent’s
personal or professional capacities, in light of the deponent’s confusion in the next questions). A
properly instructed jury could conclude that the defendant meant what she said: she never gave
anyone a massage, including Epstein and Minor Victim-2.
