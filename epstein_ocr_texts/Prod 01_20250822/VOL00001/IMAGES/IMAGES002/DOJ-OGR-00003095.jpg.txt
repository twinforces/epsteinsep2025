Q. I will ask that. question if you want, but I was focusing on, people
other than.Mr. Epstcin:right now.

A. I don’t give massages.

Q. Let's just. tic that.down. It is your testimony that. you’ve never
given anybody ‘a, massage?

A. Thavé not giveri.anyone a massage.
Q. You. never gave ‘Mr. Epstein, a massage, is that your testimony?
A. That ‘is my‘testimony.
Q. You. never gave [Minor Victim-2] a massage is: your testimony?
A. I never gave [Minor Victim-2] a:massage.
(Ex. Vat 112:17-113212).

The ‘defendant. argues that these: questions. were fundamentally ambiguous because the
deposition, elsewhere: discussed, both, sexual, and, professional massages. ‘Jt was unclear, she:
explains, what kind of massage. the questioner meant. (Def. Mot. 4 at 17.) The. defendant’s
argument is, yct again, misguided. This line: of questioning ‘used’broad. language, and at no point:
during this set of questions did:Giuffre’s counsel suggest'that:the questions'were limited to sexual
or. professional massages. Cf. Lighte, 782. F.2d at 376 (concluding that the word. “you” was
ambiguous when the prior two questions asked. about the defendant. “as. an. individual” and, then
switched “without: indication” to the. defendant “as trustec”). The. defendant’s answers were
uncquivocal, with no expressions of confusion or internal contradictions. Gf Markiewics, 978
F.2d at 809 (explaining that.a, question was ‘ambiguous as to whether it}asked about'the deponent’s
personal or professional capacitics, in light. of the deponent’s confusion in the next questions). A,
properly: instructed. jury could. conclude that: the defendant meant ‘what she: said: she never gave

anyone’ a massage, including Epstein and.Minor Victim-2.
