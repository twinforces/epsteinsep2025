and by logic that you are correct, will you have the strength of your convictions to adhere to your
decision, notwithstanding the fact that all the other jurors disagree with you?

of any reason why you would not be satisfied to have his or her case tried by someone in your
frame of mind or with the attitudes and beliefs that you hold?
