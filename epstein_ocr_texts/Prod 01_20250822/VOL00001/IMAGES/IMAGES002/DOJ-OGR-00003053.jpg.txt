Second, the Government did not misrepresent the extent of its knowledge of the contents
of Boies Schiller’s files. As the Government correctly represented to the court, the Government
had “either little or no additional information than the Court does in terms of what materials there
are [and] who was deposed.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. D at 17). In support of her argument, Maxwell
cites again to the Daily News Article, which reports that “after Maxwell’s two depositions, David
Boies himself apparently approached the government in the summer of 2016, asking ‘if the
Southern District would consider charging Maxwell with perjury’” (Def. Mot. 3 at 8). But the
Government has uncovered no evidence that such a meeting ever occurred. AUSA-1 does not
recall ever speaking with or meeting David Boies in her life. (Ex. 4 at 4). Moreover, AUSA-1
does not recall being asked if the USAO-SDNY would consider charging Maxwell with perjury
(id. at 5), and while notes of the February 2016 meeting refer to the existence of depositions
generally, there can be no question Chief Judge McMahon appreciated the Government’s general
understanding that such transcripts would be part of the civil litigation file. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at
21). Simply put, there is no evidence that the Government had any significant knowledge of the
contents of Boies Schiller’s files, or that the Government’s representations to Chief Judge
McMahon were incorrect.

In sum, Maxwell has failed to put forth any evidence that the Government misled Chief
Judge McMahon, and as such, the good faith exception applies. To the contrary, the record before
the Court demonstrates that the Government directly responded to Chief Judge McMahon’s
question and accurately described the contacts between Boies Schiller and the USAO-SDNY in
connection with the investigation, the Government’s lack of knowledge of the contents of that file,
and the fact that no protected materials had been produced in violation of the protective order.
