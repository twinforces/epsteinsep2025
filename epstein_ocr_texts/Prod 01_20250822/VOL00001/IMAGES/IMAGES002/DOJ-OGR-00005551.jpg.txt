something lil like whether: the. attorneys.a are “asking SDNY’ tor re- -do the Florida investigation
because AK. was trying to understand, what the attorneys were proposing: was it looking
at the same conduct that ‘was investigated in.Florida ‘and mishandled, or was it: looking at
different: conduct and possibly ongoing, conduct? ,AK recalls: asking’ questions to clarify.
that. point.
e© AK js'sure one of the things she asked would have been;venue oriented to‘understand.
what the attorneys. were describing and. what:the: conduct was. AK would not have
resporided to a. question asking about why AK. wouldn’t just open an investigation.
‘Purpose of the mecting was for AK.to understand what;the attorneys were trying to
convey, not for AK:to make any representation, about her thoughts or-what she was going
to do.
© ‘Brad Edwards’s book suggcsting:that.the: AUSA isecmed. “confident that a. case would be:
brought” does not seem accurate to AK. AK did not intend to give-such an impression
during the:mecting. That decision isnot one for AK to:makealone, in. any event.
© AK docs not recall any: mention.that:the:number of victims.in NY far exceeded the:
number in Florida.
é Brad Edwards’s description:of wanting a case agairist Epstcin is, consistent‘with AK’s
recollection that the focus was on Epstein.
6 JIfanyone called AK, She docs not remember*that, ard. she would nothave mentioned the
comity shown to other USAOs around the country.
é .AK does not recall anyone ever approaching her to.ask if SDNY would consider charging
Maxwell with perjury: - : —
© AK has. vague'memory that the attorneys called or emailed, AK at.some point,
and. told her-that there had been 'n depositions, presumably by'¢ ‘contact t from 0 one c of
‘way. or the other if any’ rof the. aitorneys referenced the possibility of ‘perjury.
© AK recalls thinking that a perjury investigation would have the same challenges.
AK. recalls‘thinking in-her mind that if the: depositions were about the underlying
conduct'that.had all. ofthe issues that: gave. AK pause after the mecting (length of
‘time: that; had passed, sense there must. have been.a reason. SDFL resolved the case
the way. ‘they, did) were not.alleviated. by ‘a-pery ury- -based. prosecution.
o AK. does not:recall.cver knowing anything about the:substance of the depositions
and docs not.remember anyone. sending her. a. deposition transcript:
© AK doés notzremember who had been deposed or ‘who might have been. the:
subject. of a-possible perjury investigation.
o No investigation ‘into perjury was ‘ever opened.
© AK took no further action. re Epstein after calling Sean, Watson.
o Though there may be emails or calls AK cannot remember, she knows that she
took no action. after the call to, Sean. Watson. Part ofthe reason AK: felt horrible
‘when reading’the. Miami Herald.article ‘was, because AK. took'no'action after
calling Scan, Watson.
