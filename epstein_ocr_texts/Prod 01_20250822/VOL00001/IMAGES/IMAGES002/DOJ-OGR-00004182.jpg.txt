e LP directed AK to “they will'send me affidavits and depositions” on, page'8 of AK’s
notes and asked. if AK-recalls what that line refers to and. whether‘the: attorneys sent.AK
any such materials.

© AK does not recall'what.that line refers fo.

© AK.does nof recall if the attorneys. sent-her any’ such matcrials after the mecting.

o AK does not believe the attorneys provided her any:matcrials during the mecting.

o AK. has.a vague memory that the attorneys sent her something by email, but'docs,
not:recall what. it. was.

2 One ofthe emails. LP sent to AK was an email from Skinner to AK the
evening of February 29,.2016 after the mecting sending AK documents.
AK. does ‘not remember the particular documents she reecived. AK. does
not-recall receiving any. additional, documents.

e AK remembers the mention. of several people, including Ghislaine Maxwell as cither:in
the context. of who had benefited from the; Florida;NPA. or’who the! people were’ that. had
worked for or helped:Epstein. AK. doesn’t recall much specifics about Maxwell.
Maxwell was not a focus of the mecting.

° AK-does not:recall, the attorneys saying anything about. what charges the office could.
bring. Related to that, AK-recalls:asking questions to understand. what.kind of charges
they were proposing because it was not clear. The attorneys did not present. particular
statutes that: might be pursued.

° Ak recalls trying to understand what.prior statements of Virginia Roberts existed, in the
context of assessing how much. of.a record there already was. AK recalls that the
information,about civil lawsuits came ‘up when AK. asked-the attorneys what record-there:
was of Roberts’s statements about Epstein, cither in:the:context of the Florida case or
otherwise.

© -AK’s notes don’t jog AK’s memory of what she Icarned about; Virginia, Roberts’s
prior statements.

o AK does remember that:there:was some: civil litigation, including CVRA
litigation and some other civil.case, and not just involving Virginia, but also civil,
litigation involving other potential'witness or'witnesses. AK’s takeaway was that
there was a, large and:potentially complicated record of civil litigation, that would
have to be at:some point:parsed. through. in assessing, what.any potential witness
had said. ‘It wasn’t only that'there, was civil, litigation involving Virginia, but there
was also, some person in Europe involved. in litigation. AK. felt/this was a
situation where there would be'a lot of material to gather and read. before talking
to witnesses.

° AK-doesn’t remember being told.any specific allegations victims had made against,
Maxwell. AK. gencrally remembers Maxwell. being mentioned as someone:who had.
worked. for Epstein.

6 Notes reflect. that Maxwell ‘was, “head recruiter,” but. AK does not: recall that
description being attributed.to any’particular witness
