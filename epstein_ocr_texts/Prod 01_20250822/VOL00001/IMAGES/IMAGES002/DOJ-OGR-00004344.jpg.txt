4. ‘Late July 2006: The State Indicts Epstein, and, the USAO Moves
Forward. with a Federal Investigation

Several days, after Villafafia spoke ‘with Acosta and Sloman, on July 19, 2006, Assistant’
State Attorney Belohlavek ‘presented thecase: to the state grand jury. *3 Krischer told OPR that
“the whole'thing” was put beforethe g grand jury, According'to:a statement made at the time’by the
State Attorney’s Office spokesman, the:grand jury was presented with.a.list of charges from highest.
‘to lowest, without.a. recommendation by’the’ prosecutor, and deliberated. with the-prosecutor out of
the room.?? Thestate. grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstcin with one count'of felony’
solicitation: of prostitution, in.violation of Florida Statute § 796.07, a felony understate law-because
it alleged three or: more instances of solicitation. °5 The.indictment did not: identify the person, or
persons solicited-and made no:mention of the fact that Epstein had:solicited minors.°° OnJuly 23,
2006, Epstcin self-surrendered. to be arrested on the indictment, but ‘was not detained, and the
charges weére:made:public.

Villafafia told OPR, that she:decided:to move forward with,the federal, investigation, at‘that
point, because she believed. the State Attorncy’s Office would ‘permit. Epstein to enter a. plea to a.
reduced :misdemeanor:charge and.that once he entered.a guilty*plea, the Department’s Petite:policy’
‘might preclude: a federal ‘prosecution.”’ ‘Villafafiia told ‘OPR that at, the fime, she “definitely
belicved that we were ‘going to proceed ‘to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ... we: had
sufficient. evidence.” . - .

af Villafana and the.FBI obtained and-exaniined records ofthe state grand:jury proceeding, and.Louric reviewed
them. ‘Because the grand jury records:have'not been ordered released:publicly, OPR does:not:discuss their. substance
‘in.-this.Report.

a Larry Keller, “Police say lawyer tried. to discredit teenage. girls.” Palm Bedch Post. July 29, 2006, citing’
‘statement by: State Attomney’s Office spokesman, ‘Michael Edmondson,

28 Indictment in Sidte vi. Epsrein, 2006CF9454AXX. (July 19,2006), attached as Exhibit ‘1 to this Report.

26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the I st: day’ ‘of August [2004] and October’311; 2005,
[Epstein] did solicit; induce, entice, or procure: another: ‘to. commit prostitution lowdness,, onassignation, on three
or more occasions.” The 1'S-month time; frame and lack of detail regarding’ the place; or-manner‘of the offense made
‘its impossible’ to: ‘identity from:the charging document-which, victim orvictims served as the’basis forthe charge inthe
state indictment, Belohlavek,explained to.OPR:that the char ge did:notlist specific victims so that she could go, forward,
atitrial with-whichever-victim or victims: might be available and Ww illing to testify at:that time.

37 The:Pctite policy is.a setof guidclines.used by federal. prosecutors when-considering whether to pursue federal
charges,for.defendants previously prosecuted for state-orlocal.offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit'the federal
‘government from prosecuting defendants who ‘have. been-charged, acquitted, or;convicted on state charges based. on
the same. criminal:conduct. ‘The Supreme. Court’has repeatedly-upheld the long-standing principle that:the prohibition
against double jeopardy docs.not:apply'to, prosecutions’ brought by: different sovereigns. See, e:g., Gamble v. United
States; 587 US. , 139 S.. Ct. 1960, 1966-67 (2019) (and. cases cited. therein); Abbate.s, United States, 359° US.

187,195 (1959) (and, cases’ cited therein); and United States v: Lanza, 260U. S. 377. 382 (1922). Noncetheless;. to
better: promote the, efficient: use of; criminal justice resources; the Department dev “eloped policies in 1959 and 1960 to
guide federal prosecutors in, the use of their ‘charging discretion. See ‘Chapter Two, Part Two, Section IEA.2, for a.
more detailed discussion of the Petite;policy.
