proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of third parties referenced
in the documents. These redactions are thus consistent with similar, tailored redactions permitted
by the Court in this case to protect the privacy interests of third parties. Accordingly, the
Government respectfully requests that the Court adopt the proposed redactions.
The Government has conferred with defense counsel and counsel from BSF, both of whom
indicated that they take no position on the Government’s redaction requests.
Respectfully submitted,

The Court grants the Government’s redaction requests. Its conclusion is
guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the
4/23/21 Court must: (1) determine whether the documents in question are “judicial
documents;” (11) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access
Vie to the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against the
‘ presumption of access. Jd. at 119-20.
cone USDJ. The Court concludes that these are judicial documents and that the First
Amendment and common law presumptions of access attach. But in
balancing competing considerations against the presumption of access, the
Court finds that the specific arguments the Government has put forward in
this letter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties
referenced in the documents, favor the narrowly tailored redactions. See
United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995).
The Defendant and Boies Schiller are hereby ORDERED to docket the
respective documents with the Government's proposed redactions by April
23, 2021.
SO ORDERED.
