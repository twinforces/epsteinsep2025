OPR. determined that none of the subjects was responsible for communications: sent to
certain, victims: after the NPA. was signed that described the case as “under investigation” and. that
failed to inform them. of the’ NPA. ‘The letters were 'sent by an FBI administrative employee who
‘was not-dircetly involved in the ‘investigation, incorporated standard form, language ‘used by the
FBI when communicating with victims, and were not’ drafted or reviewed. by ‘the. subjects.
Morcover, the statement that the matter was “under investigation” was not ‘false. because the
government: in fact continued. to investigate the case in. anticipation that Epstein, ‘would not: fulfill,
the terms of the NPA. However, the Ictters risked.mislcading the victims and contributed to victim
frustration, and. confusion by: failing to ‘provide ‘important ‘information. about the status of the

After ‘the NPA, was signed, Acosta. clected.'to defer 'to the State Attorney the, decision,
