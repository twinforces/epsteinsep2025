rather, has evinced a general intention to “cast ‘a. wide net to ensnare
as ‘many offenses against: children, as possible.”

Schneider, 801 F.3d.at 197 (quoting United States v.. Dodge, 597 F.3d.1347, 1355! (1. 1th-Cir. 20.10)
(en, bane)); see Weingurten, 865 F.3d. at. 59 n.10. (distinguishing Bridges because the “essential
ingredient” test. there “cffectuated Corigréss’s specific intent to limit the WSLA?’s extended,
limitations period to only a.few. offenses,” while “Congress had:the opposite: intention.for Section.
3283"): see‘also Vickers, 2014 WL 1838255, at; *1.1-12,(“[T]he defendant argues that the charged.
offense does not “involve” the sexual abusé of a.child, as reflectéd in the clements of the offense.
Defendant’s argument is illogical and clearly misinterprets the ‘use: of the term, ‘involving’ in,
section 3283.”).

Although the Second Circuit has not‘yet reached this issuc, it examined this question in.
Weingarten Vv» United States, in. the context. of a claim. for ineffective assistance of counsel.
Weingarten, 865 F.3d at ‘58-60. Rejecting the claim, the Second Circuit observed that none of the
criteria. for applying, the categorical approach. are met.in.the context-of Section 3283. Jd. The
categorical approach—which. focuses on the elements of the offense—is. generally only used. in,
prior conviction. /d, at 59.. In. such,a context, a court. attempting to'examine the ‘facts ofthe prior
conviction to determine the present. punishment. or immigration consequences ‘would. encounter
logistical. and. constitutional. obstacles. Jd. (noting an. Apprendi. problem. and. “daunting ‘practical.
difficulties and:potential, unfairness”). None of those concerns is present here, where the relevant.
facts ‘will be proved at trial.

The Weingarten court.also specifically rejected the argument Maxwell now. asserts: that
the words “offense involving” require a. categorical approach. “[T]hat Congress used, the word.

‘involving’ ‘in. § 3283 does not :‘ficcessarily ‘mean it intended to ‘trigger the categorical approach.
