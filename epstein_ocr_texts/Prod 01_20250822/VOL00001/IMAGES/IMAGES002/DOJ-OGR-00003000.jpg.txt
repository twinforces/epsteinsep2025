rather, has evinced a general intention to “cast a wide net to ensnare
as many offenses against children as possible.”
Schneider, 801 F.3d at 197 (quoting United States v. Dodge, 597 F.3d 1347, 1355 (11th Cir. 2010)
(en banc)); see Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 n.10 (distinguishing Bridges because the “essential
ingredient” test there “effectuated Congress’s specific intent to limit the WSLA’s extended
limitations period to only a few offenses,” while “Congress had the opposite intention for Section
3283”); see also Vickers, 2014 WL 1838255, at *11-12 (“[T]he defendant argues that the charged
offense does not “involve” the sexual abuse of a child, as reflected in the elements of the offense.
Defendant’s argument is illogical and clearly misinterprets the use of the term ‘involving’ in
section 3283.”).

Although the Second Circuit has not yet reached this issue, it examined this question in
Weingarten v. United States, in the context of a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.
Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58-60. Rejecting the claim, the Second Circuit observed that none of the
criteria for applying the categorical approach are met in the context of Section 3283. Jd. The
categorical approach—which focuses on the elements of the offense—is generally only used in
settings like sentencing and immigration, where a court is asked to evaluate the conduct from a
prior conviction. /d. at 59. In such a context, a court attempting to examine the facts of the prior
conviction to determine the present punishment or immigration consequences would encounter
logistical and constitutional obstacles. /d. (noting an Apprendi problem and “daunting practical
difficulties and potential unfairness”). None of those concerns is present here, where the relevant
facts will be proved at trial.

The Weingarten court also specifically rejected the argument Maxwell now asserts: that
the words “offense involving” require a categorical approach. “[T]hat Congress used the word
‘involving’ in § 3283 does not necessarily mean it intended to trigger the categorical approach.
