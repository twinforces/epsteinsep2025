Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 213 Filed 04/16/21 Page2of8

The government continues to stonewall Ms. Maxwell’s requests for clarity about what it
claims she did to justify her continued incarceration and prosecution. Although the government
has dumped thousands of pages of irrelevant discovery from inapplicable time periods on Ms.
Maxwell and her counsel, it refuses to provide the most basic information about the allegations
in Counts One through Four: who, what, when, and how. Because Counts One through Four of
the superseding indictment (“Indictment”) lack the basic factual information necessary for Ms.
Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any meaningful
discovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to answer Ms.
Maxwell’s requests for particularity.

I. The Indictment Lacks the Necessary Specificity

The government attempts to justify some of the Indictment’s deficiencies, e.g., lack of
names and dates, through citation to obviously inapplicable cases.

“First,” the government offers United States v. Stringer, 730 F.3d 120, 124 (2d Cir.
2013), for the proposition that “the use of pseudonyms to refer to minor victims of the charged
conduct does not warrant dismissal of the indictment.” Resp. at 153. The government fails to
point out, however, that Stringer was a fraud case in which the conduct was alleged to have
occurred over a 7-month period. The indictment was brought within a few years, not decades, of
the alleged crime, and the identity of the two people whose names were used in connection with
the fraud “had been revealed in the documents disclosed by the government a year” before trial.
Id. at 123.

United States v. Kidd, 386 F. Supp. 3d 364, 367 (S.D.N.Y. 2019), is equally
unpersuasive. Kidd was indicted in 2018 for crimes alleged to have occurred as late as 2018.
The case involved two alleged victims and the government produced sufficient discovery to
obviate the need for a bill of particulars. /d. at 368, 370.
