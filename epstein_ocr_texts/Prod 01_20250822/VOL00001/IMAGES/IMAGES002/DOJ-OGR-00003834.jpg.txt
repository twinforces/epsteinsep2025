Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document213  Filed.04/16/21 Page 2of8

The government continues to:stonewall Ms. Maxwell’s requests for clarity about what it
claims she did to justify her continued incarceration:and prosecution. Although the government
has dumped .thousands of pages of irrelevant discovery from inapplicable. time peridéds on Ms.
Maxwell and.her counsel, it refuses to provide’the most basic information about the allegations
in Counts One through Four: who, what, when, and how., ‘Because.Cotnts One through Four of
the'superseding indictment (“Indictment”) lack the basic factual information necessary for’ Ms.
Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide-any meaningful
discovery, the Court should cither dismiss these counts or direct the government.to answer Ms.
Maxwell’s requests for particularily.

I. The Indictment Lacks the Necessary Specificity:

The goverfiment attempts to justify some of the Indictment’s deficiencies, c:g., lack of
names and dates, through citationto obviously inapplicable cascs.

“First,” the government offers United.Siates v: Stringer, 730 F.3d 120, 124:\(2d Cir:
2013), for the proposition that “the tise of psetidonyms to refer to ‘minor victims of the charged

.conduct.docs not warrant dismissal, of the:indictment.” Resp. at 153. The-government fails to
point out, however, that Siringer was a ‘fraud case in which the conduct was alleged to have
occurred. over a.7-month.period. The indictment was brought within a few years, not decades, of
the-alleged crime, .and.the identity of the two people whose names werc'used in‘connection with
the fraud “had been tevedled in the documents disclosed by’the governtient a ‘year’ before trial.
Td. at 123.

United States v: Kidd, 386 F. Supp: 3d 364, 367 (S.D:N.Y: 2019), is equally’
unpersuasive.. Kidd was indicted in 2018 for crimes alleged to: have. occurred as late as 2018.
The case involved two alleged victims:and the government produccd sufficient discovery, to

obviate the necd for‘a bill: of particulars. Jd. at 368;370.
