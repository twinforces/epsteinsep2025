Menchel’s replyemail, began with a rebuke:

Both'the tone and substance of your ¢mail are totally inappropriate
and, in-combination with othcr:matters in the past, it seriously alls
your judgment into question.

As you. well know, the US: Attorney has not even. decided whether,
to go forward ‘with a prosecution.in this matter, thus you should have
respected his position. before chigaging in plea negotiations.

Along that,same line; despite whatever contrary representations you
made'to the agents in:this matter, it was made-clear to you bythe US
Attorney and the First Assistant from the time when ‘you were ‘first
authorized. to investigate Mr. Epstein thatthe. office had concerns

about taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and.a:number.of

by anyone to seck:‘an. indictment in,this case.°°

to resolve the matter. As you arc also 'well aware, the only reason
why this office even agreed. to look ‘into the Epstein matter in the
first instance was because of concerns that-the State had‘not done.an
adequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As ‘you and. the
agents conceded, .had Epstein been. convicted of a felony: that
resulted in a jail:sentence and. sex: offender status, ncither the FBI
nor our office ever would have intereeded. You, should. also know
that my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with ‘the US
Attorncy’s full knowledge. Had Lilly:Sanchez expressed. interest: in
pursuing this avenue firther, I certainly would have raised it with.all
the interested. individuals in-this case, including you and. the agents.
