used hidden cameras in his New’York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed

individual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section.
and. Office of Enforcement: Operations about ‘the appropriate legal. steps to obtain the computer’
equipment, Villafafia described. her plan in an,.cmail ‘to Menchel. She. asked Menchel ‘for any’
comments.or concerns, but OPR didnot find.an email:response from-him, and Menchcl told. OPR.
that he:did not recall Villafafia’s cfforts to obtain the computer equipment.

requiring production of the computer:equipment by a particular date. In-her cmail-to. Villafafia on.
June ‘29, 2007, Sanchez requested.a two-weck extension, indicating that she hoped. a “state-based.
resolution” to the casc would.seon be reached.” Villafafia-advised her supervisors of the request,
and-responded.to Sanchez that she “would like'to get'the computer:cquipment as soon as possible.”
