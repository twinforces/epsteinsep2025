investigation. ‘Because the state indictment:and information, appearced:to pertain to: far fewer than,
the total victims identified in either the state or the ‘federal investigation, and no one: at: the USAO
‘was certain ‘which. victims were. covered by’ the state charges, it should have been apparent to
Acosta that without advance planning between the USAO and the State Attorncy’s, Office, there
was a substantial risk that. most: of the ‘victims: identificd.:in. the: federal investigation. would not
reccive notice of the hearing. “25 Notification.tothe broadest possible number of identified victims
could only‘have been successful if there was appropriate communication between the USAO. and.
‘the state prosecutors, communication that: had ‘previously been lacking regarding other significant.
issucs. relating 'to Epstein. Villafafia. and. Slomian’s hastily arranged. effort to. enlist in. the
notification-process. PBPD Chicf Reiter, who likely played little:role in complying with the state’s
victimnotification obligations in a typical case, was not an-adequate substitute for careful planning
‘and, coordination with the State: Attorney’s Office.*?°

Even if the State Attorney’s ‘Office had notified.all of the identificd-victims of the upcoming
plea hearing, there'was no guarantee that such notification would have included ‘information that.
the state plea was resolving:not just the state’s investigation.of Epstein, but the federal investigation.
as well., The State Attorney was not obligated. by state statutes to inform the’victims of the’ status
of the federal investigation, and. there was little ‘reason to assume, ‘Krischer, or one of his.'staff,
would voluntarily do so, thereby putting the State Attorney’s Office in the position. of fielding:
victim: ‘questions, and concers about the outéonic. Furthermore, as both:the USAO and the defense
had differing views as to who could lawfully participate in the state plea. hearing, there is: no
indication, that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia took: steps to confirm, that, if victims appeared, they:
could actually participate in:the:state: court proceeding when.they were! not victims of the charged,

crimes. 427

‘Through counsel, Acosta. asserted. to OPR. that because Villafafia and. Sloman both. told.
OPR that. they believed. that state: officials would notify: the: victims, “OPR. identified no reason,
why. Secretary Acosta, should have distrusted his team:on these points.” Acosta?s counsel. further:

47 Although Villafafia’s. notes indicate that: she researched Florida. Statutes §§:960:001 and.921.143 when she
‘drafted.unsent letters to victims:in November and December‘2007 inviting.themrto participate in-the state plea ‘hearing

to: speak at a:defendant’s sentencing or to: submit a statement only to, they, ictims of the crime:for which the:defendant:
