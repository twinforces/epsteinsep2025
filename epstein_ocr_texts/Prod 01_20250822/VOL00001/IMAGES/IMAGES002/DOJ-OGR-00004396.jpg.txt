we go that route, ‘would ‘you intend to make the deferred [s/¢] prosccution. agreement public?”
Villafatia replied that whilc’a, federal, plea, agreement would be part of the court file and publicly
accessible, the NPA “would not be made ‘public or filed with. the Court, but it would remain part:
of our case. file. It probablywould be subject 'to a FOIA [Frecdom of Information Act] request,

but it is not something that. we. would distribute without compulsory process. »tl6 “Willafatia told
OPR that she belicyed. Epstcin did not want the NPA, to be:made:public because he “did not want
people to belicve him to have committed.a-variety of crimes.” As she explaincd.to OPR, Villafafia.
believed the NPA. did not.nced to be disclosed in its entirety, but. she anticipated notifying the
wictims about'the NPA provisions relating to their ability to:recover damages.

E, The Parties Appear to Reach Agreement. on a,Plea'to Federal. Charges

Negotiations continued the next day, Tuesday, September 18, 2007. Responding to
Villafafia’s revised draft of the NPA, Lefkowitz suggested that Epstcin plead to one federal charge
with a 12-month,sentence,. followed by one yearof supervised release with a requirement:for home
détention and two:years of state probation, with. the first six months of the state sentence to be:
served ‘under community control. Villafafia replicd, “I know: that. the U.S. Attorney. will not go
below 18 months of: prison/jail. time (and I would strongly oppose the suggestion).” Shortly
thereafter, Villafafia emailed. Acosta, Lourie, and the incoming West Palm/Beach:manager:

Hi.all — 1 think that‘we may be near the end. of our negotiations with
Mr. Epstein, and not because ‘we have reached a:resolution. As. I
mentioned. yesterday, -I spent about 12 hours over ‘the weckend
drafting Informations, changing ‘plea. agreements, and ‘writing
factual ‘proffers. |] was supposed to ‘reecive'a, draft agreement from
them ‘yesterday, which never arrived. At that ‘time, they were
leaning towards ‘pleading only to state: charges and doing all of the
time.in state custody. - . .

Late last ‘night I talked to Jay Lefkowitz who asked about ‘Epstein
pleading to two ‘twelve-month federal charges with half of his jail
time being spent'in home confinement pursuant to. the guidelines. 1
told him. that. I had no objection. to that approach but, in.the interest
of'full disclosure, I'did not believe that'Mr. Epstcin would’be cligible
because ‘he will, not’ be in, Zone A, or ‘B.''? This. morning’ Jay
Lefkowitz called aid said that was correct buts if we could get

eligible,

My response: have him plead to two separate Informations. On, the.
first one.he gets 12. months’ imprisonment.and on the:second he gets
