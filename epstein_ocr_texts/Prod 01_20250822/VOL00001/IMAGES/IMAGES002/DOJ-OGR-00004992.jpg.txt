LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA
third parties accessed the Zoom room used by Ms. Maxwell and counsel. This breach was
reported to, and I believe witnessed by, MDC staff, including an MDC technician named Leon
who is tasked with dealing with Ms. Maxwell’s electronics issues.

By email dated August 12" to MDC Legal, with government counsel copied, I reported
that this purported breach severely impacts confidential privileged attorney-client
communication and is especially concerning in this high-profile case. I requested that the VTC
revert to the original WebEx platform controlled by defense counsel.

In an email response, dated August 13", MDC Legal stated:

There was a miscommunication on our end internally. There was no

breach. The address provided was a very secure line, however, it was

already one being used. We are creating a line as secure as possible.

We are hoping for this to be complete by the 9:30 scheduled call, but I

cannot confirm it will be ready by then.

On August 16", I again emailed MDC Legal, with government counsel copied,
requesting clarification as to why the VTC is still not proceeding, as it did not on Friday, and
renewed my request that VTCs be reinstated on defense counsel’s WebEx platform because the
substituted Zoom platform is not secure and seems to have caused cancellation of Ms. Maxwell’s
VTCs. I also informed MDC Legal, with government counsel copied, that during my in-person
visit with Ms. Maxwell on Saturday, August 14", both Ms. Maxwell and I were told we could
not pass documents. This restriction frustrated and affected the productivity of a four-hour visit.

In a reply email later that day, MDC Legal stated:

Please understand this is not a simple process and may take a few days.

With that said you have had access to your client via telephone.

Additionally, as you have had weekend visit on weekend with Ms. Maxwell,

we can gladly arrange for the same on any day moving forward.

As far as your weekend legal visit- the staff who did not allow the

passing of legal documents have been informed of the appropriate

instructions.

The restrictions placed on Ms. Maxwell, including limiting the quantity of legal
documents she may bring to the VTC room or day room and the prohibition on review of
documents during in-person legal conferences- coupled with problems with conducting
confidential legal conference VTCs - has limited Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial. Legal
calls do not suffice because we cannot share documents. For example, Ms. Maxwell received
new discovery today and yet again a significant amount is not viewable on the hardware and
software provided by the government. Because we cannot share documents, that discovery
remains unviewable by Ms. Maxwell. Further, ongoing delays in bringing Ms. Maxwell to the
day room continue, which reduces the time she is permitted to work on her case and limitations
