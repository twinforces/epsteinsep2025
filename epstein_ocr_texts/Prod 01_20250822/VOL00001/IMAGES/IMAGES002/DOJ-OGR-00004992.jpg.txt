LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C: STERNHEIA\

reported to, and I believe: witnessed by. A MDC: staff, including an MDC: technician named Leon.
who. is tasked with, dcaling:with Ms, Maxwell’s clectronics issues.

By email dated.August 12" fo MDC Legal, with government. counsel copied, I reported
that this purported. breach severely impacts confidential. privileged attorney-clicnt
‘communication and ‘is especially concerning in-this high-profile case. I requested.that-the VTC.
revert to the original WebEx platform.controlled. by ‘defense counsel.

Tn an email response, dated August. 13", MDC Legal. stated:

There was a miscommunication .on our end. internally. ‘There ‘was, io
breach. The:address provided was a very secure: linc, however, it was
already one’being used. “Weare creating a line as secure as possible.

We are hoping ‘for this to be complete by the 9:30 scheduled. call, but I
cannot confirm. it; wall be ready: by then.

On August: 16", 1 again emailed MDC Legal, with. government counscl.copicd,
requesting clarification as to: why the VTE is still not- proceeding, as it did not.on Friday, and
renewed my request that VTCs'be reinstated on, defense :counsel’s WebEx: platform because the
substituted Zoom ‘platform. is not. secure and scems, to have caused cancellation of Ms. Maxwell’s
VTCs. also informed MDC Legal, with government.counsel copicd, that during my ‘in-person
visit‘with Ms. Maxwell on Saturday, August 14", both Ms. Maxwell and I were told:we could
not pass ‘documents. This restriction frustrated.and affected. the productivity ofa four-hour: visit.

Ina reply email later that day, MDC. Legal stated:

Please"understand this is not.a simple process and may take a few days.
With that said you have had access to-your client via telephone.
Additionally, as‘you_have had-weckend visit:on weekend with Ms. Maxwell,
we can gladly. arrange for the same ‘on any day moving forward.

passing: sof iowal de Jocuments: have been informed ofthe © appropriate
instructions.

The restrictions'placed, on Ms. Maxwell, including limiting the: quantity of legal
‘documents she may bring to the VTC. room.or day room and the ‘prohibition on-review of
documents during in-person Icgal. conferehces- coupled ‘with problems with. coriducting
confidential. legal conference VTGs - has limited Ms. Maxwell’s ability to prepare for trial. Legal
calls do not suffice because:we cannot share documents. For example, Ms: ‘Maxwell received
new discovery today. and yct.again,a significant amount is not. viewable on the hardware and
software ‘provided by the government. Because we cannot: share documents, that: discovery.
remains‘unvicwable by Ms. Maxwell. Further, ongoing delays in. bringing Ms. Maxwell to ‘the.
day room continue, which reduces the time she is permitted to work on-her. case and limitations
