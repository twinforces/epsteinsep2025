On July:24,'2006, Villafania. alerted: Sloman, who informed.Acosta, that the State:Attorney’s
Office:had charged and arrested Epstein.”* °* Onthat'same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach:formally
opened. the case, assigning the casc agent: and, later, a co-casc: agent, to investigate it. Villafafia,
told Sloman that the FBI agents “are, getting copies ofall of the evidence and ‘we are going to
revicw cverything at [the] EBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her: target date for filing fedcral
charges: against Epstein was August 25, 2006. Acosta cmailed Sloman, asking: whether it was

“appropriate to ‘approach [State Attomey Krischer] and give him a heads up re where’ we ‘might.
go?” Sloman replied, “No for fear'that it will be leaked straight to Epstcin.”??

Although Lourie Icarned ofthe case at this point from-Sloman, and eventually took a more
active role in supervising the investigation, ‘Villafafia ‘continucd. to. ‘update, Acosta.and Sloman.
directly on the progress of the case.°” Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach, had.
little involvement. in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her
emails to. Sloman, Menchcl, and Louric: without copying her immediate supervisor. In the
immediate supervisor’s view, however, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the. “authority” for the
case, which the immediate supervisor regarded as. “highly unusual.”*!

By late August: 2006, Villafafia,and the FBI had identified several. additional ‘victims and.
obtained “some flight, ‘manifests, telephone: messages, and. cell phone records that, show the:
communication. and. travel. in interstate commerce” by Epstcin and his associates. Villafafia
reported.to her supervisors that the State Attorncy’s Office would not: provide transcripts from the
state grand juryvoluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chicf Reiter “to convince’ him to
relinquish. ‘the. evidence to the EBI. Villafafia also told. her supervisors that she expected, “a
number of fights” over her document, demands, and that some parti¢s were refusing to comply’
“after having, contact with Epstein or his attorneys.”

Villafafia’s reference: to anticipated, “fights” and. lack of compliance led Sloman. to ask.
whether she was referring to the victims. Villafana responded. that the problems did not involve:
victims, but rather a. former employce of Epstein and sonic. business entities that had objected to
document demands as overly burderisome. ‘Villafatia explaiticd ‘to ‘Sloman and Lourie that. some
victims were “scared. and/or embarrassed,” and ‘some had been intimidated by the defense, but
“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken,so far has been, willing'to:tell her’story.” ‘Villafaiia.

ak On the same day; Slonian cmailed-Louric, whoni Villafafia had not‘yet bricfed about the case, noting that:

Operation.Leap Year was “a highly:sensitive case involving, some Palm Beach rich guy.”
2 During his OPR :iftérvicw, Sloman did not recall what he meant by'this. reniark, but speculated that it was
likely:that“Swe didii*t teustithe Palit Beach State Attorney's Office,” atid;that he believed there may, ‘have bech “sone
type of relationship between Soficbodyin the [State Attorney's Office] andthe défengestéam”

and Acosta on: August 23, 200: . Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you,and Alex: [Acosta] want her, updating: you on: the

case? Sloman responded, ‘At ‘this, point, ‘T.don’t really-care. If,Alex says something then,FIl tellher to justerun it

through: you guys:”
