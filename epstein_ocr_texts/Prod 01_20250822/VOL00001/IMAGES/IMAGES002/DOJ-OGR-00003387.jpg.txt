Similarly, inthe’ critical ‘month of September, the NPA and ‘plea negotiations intensified and the
NPA evolved ‘significantly, with the USAO. having ‘to consider multiple. different options as. key’
provisions were continuously’ added. ‘or modified ‘while Villafafia. pressed to meet her late-
September deadline., Although, Louric was involved ‘with the negotiations during this ‘period, he
was at the same time transitioning not only to a‘new job but, to. one in Washington, 'D.C., and was
traveling between the two locations. Sloman'was on. vacation. in the weck preceding’ the signing,
when many significant.changes were madeé'to the agreement, and he did-not participate. in drafting
or. reviewing-the NPA before it was signed. Accordingly,, during the key negotiation:period fora

of the case and full ownership of the decisions that were’being made. Villafafia certainly felt that.
during the negotiations, she’was only implementing decisions.made’by Acosta. Acosta, however,
told:‘OPR that when revicwing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this for the policy concerns. Did

Acosta accepted several terms with little apparent discussion. or consideration of the ramifications.

The USAO’s agrccment not to prosecute * “any potential. €o-conspirators” is. a. notable
example. As previously noted, the: only written discussion about the: term that OPR. found was
Villafafia’s email to ‘Lourie and the incoming West Palm. ‘Beach. manager, with copies to her
co-counsel and direct, supervisor, ‘stating that she did not. believe’ the provision “hurts us,” and.
neither Acosta, Louric, nor Villafafa-recalled any: further discussion about the provision. Although
OPR did ‘not find evidence showing that Acosta, Louric, or Villafafia intended, the scope of the:

precluded the USAO. from: prosecuting anyone who engaged with Epstein in-his criminal. conduct,
within, the: limitations. set. by the ‘overall agreement. This. broad prosecution declination would.
likely be unwise inmost cases but'in, this case in ‘particular, the USAO did not have a'sufficient.
investigative basis from which it,could conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no
other individuals ‘who should. be hcld accountable along ‘with Epstein. or that evidence might not
be developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise: not. to prosecute unidentified. third,
