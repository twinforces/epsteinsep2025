inflammatory and prejudicial statement or questions by the defense. The Court should not indulge
the defense’s effort to get these inflammatory arguments in front of the jury before the Court can
rule on this issue.

I. The Court Should Not Allow the Defense to Suggest to the Jury That The Defendant
Prevailed Against the Minor Victims in Litigation
The fact that the defendant “prevailed” in litigation, for purposes of awarding a small
amount of costs, is irrelevant. That litigation resolved through a voluntary dismissal in connection
with a settlement. To be sure, the defendant is a prevailing party as part of the cost-shifting statute,
and so her current counsel sought a total of aa. presumably in part for the purpose of making
this improper argument at trial. (See Def. Opp. at 57-59). But any suggestion that the defendant
“prevailed” can only confuse the jury into thinking that the Court adjudicated the substance of
claims in the defendant’s favor. That never occurred. If the defense is permitted to elicit this
testimony, the Government will need to explain the relevant legal principles to the jury, showing
them that—contrary to the defendant’s position—to a lay person, this is a technicality, and the
litigation terminated with a settlement. (See id. at 58). Even if there were marginal probative
value in a civil case, it would deeply confuse the jury to suggest that the defendant prevailed
substantively, and would require a mini-trial on the meaning of a prevailing party in civil litigation.
See Fed. R. Evid. 403.
