v. Kaloyeros, et al., 16 Cr. 776 (VEC); United States v. Percoco, et al., 16 Cr. 776 (VEC); cf. Oct.
12, 2021 Tr. at 7:14-8:1, United States v. Parnas, 19 Cr. 725 (JPO) (denying defense’s request for
a second day of jury selection to allow time for background research on potential jurors; no juror
questionnaire used). Here, the time between the administration of the jury questionnaire, oral voir
dire, and the start of trial is significantly more extended in light of, among other things, COVID-
19 precautions.

As the Court has noted, the purpose of the jury questionnaire process is to streamline
challenges for cause. Juror identities are not necessary for that process. The Government submits
that having identifying information for jurors for weeks in advance of selection would be unusual,
and is not necessary, because “the purpose of the voir dire is to ascertain disqualifications, not to
afford individual analysis in depth to permit a party to choose a jury that fits into some mold that
he believes appropriate for his case.” United States v. Barnes, 604 F.2d 121, 138 (2d Cir. 1979)
(citations omitted). For similar reasons, the Government respectfully requests that peremptory
challenges be exercised at the conclusion of voir dire and not on November 29, 2021, the day that
trial is scheduled to commence.

Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court clarify for the parties
when during the jury selection process the parties will be provided with the names of prospective
jurors.
