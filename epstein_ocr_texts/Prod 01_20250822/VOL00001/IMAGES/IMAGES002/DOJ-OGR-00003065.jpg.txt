a. Applicable Law

The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person . . . shall be
deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law ... .” The Due Process Clause
“protects individuals against two types of government action.” Martinez v. McAleenan, 385 F.
Supp. 3d 349, 356 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). Procedural due process “ensures that government cannot

(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).

As to substantive due process, the Supreme Court is “always . . . reluctant to expand the
concept of substantive due process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this
unchartered area are scarce and open-ended.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720
(1997) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Because of this reluctance, the Supreme
Court held in Graham vy. Connor, 490 U.S. 386 (1989), “that where a particular Amendment
provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of
