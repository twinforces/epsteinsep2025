evidentiary details of its case’” (quoting United States v. Biaggi, 675 F. Supp. 790, 810 (S.D.N.Y.
1987)).

A bill of particulars should not be misused to compel the Government to disclose “the
manner in which it will attempt to prove the charges, the precise manner in which the defendant
committed the crime charged, or a preview of the Government’s evidence or legal theories.”
Mitlof, 165 F. Supp. 2d at 569; see also Torres, 901 F.2d at 234 (“Acquisition of evidentiary detail
is not the function of the bill of particulars.’” (quoting Hemphill v. United States, 392 F.2d 45, 49
(8th Cir. 1968))). The “‘wheres, whens and with whoms’” are “beyond the scope of a bill of
particulars.” Mitlof, 165 F. Supp. 2d at 569 (citing Torres, 901 F.2d at 233-34; Jimenez, 824 F.
Supp. 351, 363 (S.D.N.Y. 1993)); see also, e.g., United States v. D’Amico, 734 F. Supp. 2d 321,
335 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (“‘A bill of particulars is not a general investigative tool, a discovery device
or ameans to compel the government to disclose evidence or witnesses to be offered prior to trial.’”
(quoting United States v. Gibson, 175 F. Supp. 2d 532, 537 (S.D.N.Y. 2001))); United States v.
Bellomo, 263 F. Supp. 2d 561, 580 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (“A bill of particulars is not designed to:
obtain the government’s evidence; restrict the government’s evidence prior to trial; assist the
defendant’s investigation; obtain the precise way in which the government intends to prove its
case; interpret its evidence for the defendant, or disclose its legal theory.”); United States v. Henry,
861 F. Supp. 1190, 1197 (S.D.N.Y. 1994) (“This instrument should not function to disclose
evidence, witnesses, and legal theories to be offered by the Government at trial or as a general
investigative tool for the defense.”’).

There are good reasons why bills of particulars are warranted only where the allegations in
