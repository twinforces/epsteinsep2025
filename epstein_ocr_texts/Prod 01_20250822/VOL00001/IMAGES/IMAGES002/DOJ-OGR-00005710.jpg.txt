Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 389 Filed 10/29/21 Page9of11
among the co-conspirators to cover up their crime after its commission) (discussing Grunewald
v. United States, 353 U.S. 391, 401-02, 404 & n.16 (1957)).

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, and consistent with its prior ruling on severance, the Court
should exclude from evidence any statements made by Ms. Maxwell at her 2016 civil
depositions and any other evidence related to the severed perjury counts. The Court should
further redact from the superseding indictment the perjury counts ({/f/ 28-31) and the allegations
that Ms. Maxwell provided false statements at her depositions to “conceal” her involvement in
Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes (fj 2 (second sentence), 10). See Marcus Schloss, 710 F. Supp. 944 at
950 (redacting portions of indictment referring to precluded allegations of obstruction).
