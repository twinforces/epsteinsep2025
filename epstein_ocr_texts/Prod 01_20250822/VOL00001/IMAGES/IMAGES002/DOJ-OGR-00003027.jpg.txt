Schiller. (Def. Mem. 3, Ex. E at 2-3). The USAO-SDNY ‘first contactéd.Boies Schiller about its
investigation on.or about’December 18,.2018. Shortly thereafter, in or about December or January

The Government ‘notes that. as of March, 7, 20.16, one week after AUSA=1’s February 29,
20.16 meeting with the attorncys when she reccived.these documents, Maxwell had only produced,
two.emails in response to Giuffre’s discovery:requests. (See 15'Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 43 at

also does not. beli¢ve she ever received any such discovery materials. (Ex. 4 at 6):
