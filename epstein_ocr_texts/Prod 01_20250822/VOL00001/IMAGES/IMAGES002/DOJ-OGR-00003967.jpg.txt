Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Response to DKt. No. 227. Goverriment’s April 21, 2021 Létter te Ms. Maxwell’s
Motions to Suppress

Dear Judge Nathan:

We write in response to the government’s letter about Ms. Maxwell’s pending motions
to. suppress and.request for evidentiary hearing (Dkt. No. 227), and this Court’s order stating
an intent to defer resolution of those motions and that request until after the trial on the non-
perjury counts (Dkt. No. 231)..Although we appreciate the need to streamline the pretrial
process and the desire to efficiently resolve the pending disputes, we do not agree that’ the
We understand the Court’s desire to maintain the statis. quo relating to the defense: motions,
but the government’s response:gives Ms. Maxwell no confidence that the government shares.
this understanding. Indeed, the government’s vague assurances are insufficient to safeguard
Ms. Maxwell’s constitutional rights, to guarantee the government will not benefit from its.
unconstitutional conduct, and to ensure that Ms. Maxwell’s is not deprived of due process
through the.introduction and use of evidence that itself was obtained in violation of due

process.
