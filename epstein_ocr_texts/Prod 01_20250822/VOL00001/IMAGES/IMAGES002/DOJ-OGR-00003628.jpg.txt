systematic differences in the populations of those who register to vote by race or ethnicity. That
is, if African Americans or Hispanics are less likely (or more likely) to register to vote, then the
selection from the voter lists would be expected to underrepresent (or overrepresent) African
Americans and Hispanics to the extent that the likelihood of not registering to vote differs among
the demographic groups.

15. Since jurors are always anticipated to be needed for future trials, at least once a year,
persons on the master jury wheel are selected for possible jury duty via simple random sampling.
Those randomly selected are sent questionnaires to determine their qualifications to sit as a juror.
The names of persons who complete and return the questionnaire and are found to be qualified as
jurors are placed on the qualified jury wheel from which jurors are selected, unless they are
granted an exclusion from jury service. If the demographics of the master jury wheel and
qualified juror wheel differ, it is because of demographic differences in the population of those
who return the questionnaire and/or are found to be qualified and/or excused.°

B. Analyzing If There is a Difference in the Demographics of the White Plains

Qualified Jury Wheel and the Demographics of the White Plains Community.

16. The only statistic we actually know that will allow us to assess the difference between
the demographics of the White Plains qualified jury wheel and the comparable demographics of
the White Plains community is the racial and ethnic make-up of the qualified jury wheel.

17. Based on the actual potential jurors’ responses concerning their race and ethnicity, the
White Plains qualified jury wheel is 8.76% African American and 10.48% Hispanic.
® Some small increase or decrease in the representation of African Americans and Hispanics
would be expected to occur by chance, but this is unlikely to have any meaningful impact of the
absolute disparity for African Americans and Hispanics.
