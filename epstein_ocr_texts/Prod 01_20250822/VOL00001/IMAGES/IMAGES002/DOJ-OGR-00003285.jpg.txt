registration “based ¢ on, the facts alleged i in this. case . “simply docs not: makes sense:” ‘In the: event.
that Acosta.did:not agree to their'proposed.charges, Lefkowitz offered as.an.altcrnative “to stipulate
that the state offense” would “constitute a-prior sexual, offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist.
sentencing” should Epstcin:cver again: commit a federal sex ‘offense against-minors. As Lefkowitz
further argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty: of recidivist
sentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflcet, that, carly that afternoon, Acosta,
Lourie, and Villafafia discussed. the matter in a conference call.

Lefkowitz also'sent a revised-version-of the NPA to Villafafia that omitted identification of
the charge'to which Epstcin would plead,guilty, Later that.day, Lefkowitz emailed Acosta:

I got-a call from. [MJarie who said ‘you had. rejected. our ‘proposal.
Does that mean you are:not éven preparcd.to. have [Epstcin] commit

now to. plead to the registcrable offense near rthe end of his 18:month
for that charge? | thought that was s exactly what you "proposed
[F]riday:(although you'wanted, but were not able; to do it with:some
kind.of federal charge).

But that still, gives you a_registerable sex offense, 30 months total,
and 18 in jail.

How can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring ‘that. [E]pstein is
not unduly endangered in jail?

Acosta responded, “I do not mean to’be difficult, but our negotiations must take place: with, the:
AUSAs assigned to ‘the! case.” Acosta added. that he had ‘spoken. with Lourie :and. Villafafia, and.
they had. “discretion to. proceed, as they’ belicve just and appropriate.” Acosta copied. Villafafia,
and she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”

L. The, Defense Adds a Confidentiality. Clause.

Throughout ‘that Sunday cyening, Lefkowitz ‘had numerous. email exchanges with,
Villafafia, and apparently. a,confercnce call with Louric (who was, returning to Washington, D.C.)
and Villafafia. ‘Later that évening, .Lefkowit7 sent Villafaria a new version. of the NPA that, forthe
first time, included a. confidentiality term:

It is the intention, of the ‘parties, to this Agreement that it not ‘be
disseminated or disclosed execpt pursuant to court order. Jn the
event the Government must disclose this Agreement in response ‘to.
a request pursuant to the Freedom. of Information Act, the
Government agrecs to provide Epstein. notice: before the disclosure
of this Agreement.

After making additional. revisions, Villafafia sent, this NPA. to Acosta and, Lourie as the
“final” version, asking Acosta to. let. her know‘what he thought of it. Among-her:revisions, she:
changed. the confidentiality provision to the: following:
