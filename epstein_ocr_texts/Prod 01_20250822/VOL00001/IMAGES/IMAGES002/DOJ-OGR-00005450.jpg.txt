scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various

investigative steps taken by the agents, including but not limited to testimony about

regulations or reveal confidential sources, classified information, trade secrets, ongoing
investigations, or investigatory techniques. (28 C.F.R. § 16.26(b)).

If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please do not hesitate to contact
me.

Sincerely,
