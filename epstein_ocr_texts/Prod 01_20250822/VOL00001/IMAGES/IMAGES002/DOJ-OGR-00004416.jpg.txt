Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 119 of 349

On October 22, 2007, Sloman responded to the issues Lefkowitz had raised, rejecting some
defense proposals but agreeing to modify certain language in the proposed addendum to “satisfy
your concern.”!4° Noting that the addendum and a revised letter to the special master were
attached, Sloman ended by stating, “[T]his needs to be concluded. Alex and I believe that this is
as far as we can go. Therefore, please advise me whether we have a deal no later than COB
tomorrow... .”

Nonetheless, the next day, Lefkowitz sent Acosta a three-page letter reiterating the Epstein
team’s disagreements with the USAO’s interpretation of the NPA. Lefkowitz noted, however, that
Epstein had “every intention of honoring the terms of [the NPA] in good faith,” and that the defense
letter was not intended to be “a rescission or withdrawal from the terms of the [NPA].” Lefkowitz
added:

I also want to thank you for the commitment you made to me during
our October 12 meeting in which you promised genuine finality with
regard to this matter, and assured me that your Office would not
intervene with the State Attorney’s Office regarding this matter; or
contact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or
potential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this matter;
and that neither your Office nor the [FBI] would intervene regarding
the sentence Mr. Epstein receives pursuant to a plea with the State,
so long as that sentence does not violate state law. Indeed, so long
as Mr. Epstein’s sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the
Agreement, he is entitled to any type of sentence available to him,
including but not limited to gain time and work release.

Sloman forwarded the letter to Villafafia, commenting, “Wait [until] you see this one.”
Villafafia replied:

Welcome to my world. I love the way that they want to interpret

this agreement.

It also looks like they are planning to ask for and receive a sentence

far lower than the one we agreed to. Has anyone talked to Barry

[Krischer] about this? Maybe this is the real reason for the delay in

entering the guilty plea? We also have to contact the victims to tell

[them] about the outcome of the case and to advise them than an

attorney will be contacting them regarding possible claims against

Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do that, it may be a violation of the Florida

Bar Rules for the selected attorney to “cold call” the girls.
146 The defense raised issues concerning the attorney representative, the statutory limit on damages, and
inclusion of certain victims.
