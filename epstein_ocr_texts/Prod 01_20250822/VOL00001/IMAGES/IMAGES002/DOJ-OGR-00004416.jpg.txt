intervene with the State Attorney’s Office regarding this matter; or
contact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses, or
potential civil claimants arid their réspective: counsel in this matter?
and that neither your Office:nor the [FBI] would intervene:regarding
the sentence Mr. Epstein. receives pursuant. to a plea with the State,
so long as that. sentence does not, violate state law.. Indecd,. so long
as Mr. Epstcin’s. sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the.
Agreement, he is entitled to any type of sentérice available to him,
including but-not limited to gain time.and work release.

Villafafia replied:

Welcome to my’world. I lové the ‘way’ that they: want to. interpret
this agreement.

It also: looks like-they are planning to ask for and reccive-a sentence
far lower than. the one we agreed. to. Has anyone talked. to Barry
[Krischer] about.this? Maybe this is the real. reason, for the delay in
entering the guilty plea? ‘We also have to contact the victims to tell
[them] about the outcome ofthe casé and ‘to advise them ‘than an
attorney will be contacting them. regarding possible claims against
Mr. Epstein. If we don’t-do that, itsmay be a violation of the:Florida
Bar Rules for the selected attorncy to “cold call” the girls.

6 The defense. raised issues’ concerning the attorney representative, the statutory limit on,;damages, and.

inclusion of, certain NV ictims:
