Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Court is receipt of the parties’ letters regarding the jury questionnaire and voir dire.
See Dkt. Nos. 372, 373, 375.

The Court will provide counsel the corresponding list of juror names and assigned juror
numbers on November 16 at the commencement of voir dire. The placeholder for the juror
information sheet in the Court’s draft questionnaire refers to the information sheet required by
the Jury Department. See Dkt. No. 365. The information sheet will be removed and collected by
the Jury Department from the packet before the parties’ review of the questionnaires.

The Court is still considering the logistics of when peremptory strikes will be exercised,
but the Court anticipates peremptory strikes will be exercised on November 29. Assuming so, the
swearing in of the jury, preliminary instructions, and opening statements would commence
immediately following the simultaneous (via submission of lists) exercise of peremptory
challenges.

SO ORDERED.
