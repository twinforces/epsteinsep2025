motivated’ byi improper: factors, Acosta had, the ‘ ‘plenary authority” under federal law. and under: the
USAM to resolve'the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed.in detail below,
OPR did. not find. eVidenee .cstablishing. ‘that’ Acosta, or the othér Subjects, ‘were motivated or
influeneed by i improper considerations: Because. no clear and ame standard Fequired
state, OPR does not, find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision. to decline to initiate a federal
prosecution of Epstein.

B. No ‘Clear and. Unambiguous Standard. Precluded. Acosta’s Use of. a
Non-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein

OPR. found no ‘statute or Department policy that was violated by’ Acosta’s decision to
resolve, the federal inveatiganion of epsen through a Smon-proseeution agreement.

a. ‘non- prosecution agreement. or a related and ‘similar mechanism, a » deferred, prosceution
agreement. United Siates v. Fokker Servs. BoV.; 818: F.3d.733.(D-€.:Cir. 2016). These agreements
“afford.a middle-ground option to the prosecution, when, for example, it believes that a criminal
conviction may be difficult to obtain. or may: result.in unwanted collateral consequences: for a
defendant or third ‘partics, but: also belicvcs that the defendant should not evade accountability
altogether.” Jd. at'738., As with all, prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a ‘case
through a‘non-prosccution.agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement ‘ ‘resides: fundamentally’
with the Exccutive” branch. Jd. at.741.

OPR. found no clear and‘unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the-use of a.non-
prosecution, agreement in the circumstances presented in’Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically’
authorized and. provided guidance regarding non-prosccution agreements or deferred prosecution
agreements madé in.cxchange for a person’s timely. cooperation when such cooperation would put.
the person in potential criminal. jcopardy' and ‘when. alternatives, to, full immunity (such as
testimonial-immunity) were:“impossible or impracticable: ” USAM § 9-27.600 (comment). 05 ‘The:

“cooperation” contemplated. was cooperation. ‘in, the criminal investigation. or prosecution of
another’person. In certain, circumstances, government.attorneys were required to obtain approval
fromthe appropriate Assistant Attorncy General before entering into, a non-prosccution agreement.
in. éxchange, for cooperation.

Epstcin, however, was not-providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the
USAM. was silent ‘as to whether ‘a, ‘prosecutor could use a non-prosccution, agreement in,
circumstances other than in, ¢xchange for cooperation in the investigation or ‘prosccution of
another. Notably, although. the USAM ‘provided. guidance and. approval. requirements in cases
involving, cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit-the use of.a:non-prosccution.agreement in other
situations. Accordingly, OPR concludes thatthe USAM did.not establish a clear and-unambiguous
obligation prohibiting Acosta from, cnding the federal, investigation, through a. non-prosccution,

208 USAM! §' 9-27.650 required. that non-prosecution agreements: ‘in exchange; for ‘cooperation be fully
memorialized in writing Although this:requirement was:not applicable for the reasons given.above; the NPA complied.
by fully memorializing: the terms of the agreement.
