impartial juror in this case? [If Yes/Unsure question privately.]

The Charges

This is a criminal case. The defendant on trial, Ghislaine Maxwell, has been charged with
the commission of federal crimes in an Indictment filed by a grand jury sitting in this District.

The Indictment is not evidence. It simply contains the charges that the Government is
required to prove to the satisfaction of the trial jury beyond a reasonable doubt. The charges were
summarized in the questionnaire you all filled out. The Indictment alleges that Ghislaine Maxwell
conspired with and aided and abetted Jeffrey Epstein to entice minor females to travel to engage
in illegal sex acts, transported a minor female to engage in criminal sexual activity, and engaged
in sex trafficking of a minor.

I will summarize the charges again briefly in this case in order to determine whether there
is anything about the nature of this case that may make it difficult or inappropriate for any of you
to serve on the jury.

The Indictment in this case contains six counts or charges:

e Count One of the Indictment charges that, from at least in or about 1994, up to and
including in or about 2004, Ghislaine Maxwell, the defendant, conspired with others to
entice minors to travel in interstate and foreign commerce to engage in sexual activity for
which a person can be charged with a criminal offense.

e Count Two charges that, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including in or about
1997, Ghislaine Maxwell enticed a minor to travel in interstate and foreign commerce to
engage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense, and
aided and abetted the same.

e Count Three charges that, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including in or about
2004, Ghislaine Maxwell conspired with others to transport minors in interstate and foreign
commerce to engage in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal
offense.

e Count Four charges that, from at least in or about 1994, up to and including in or about
1997, Ghislaine Maxwell transported minors in interstate and foreign commerce to engage
in sexual activity for which a person can be charged with a criminal offense, and aided and
abetted the same.
