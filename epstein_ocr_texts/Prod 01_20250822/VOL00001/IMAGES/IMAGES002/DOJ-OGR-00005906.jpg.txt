Sexual, grooming of children ‘295

that: offenders who. abused, boys showed. a. preference for interacting at the child’s level, and
incest: offenders ‘tended to -raise. the victim’s status: to that of an adult, while offenders who
abused girls were more ‘concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that
consutiite grooming: the child take two different forms—physical. and ‘psychological.

Ph sical: grooming involves; the gradual, sexualization: of: the. relationship between the
offender ‘and the victim (Berliner & Conte, 1990). Psychological grooming is used to. achieve
this inéréased. Sexudlization. At first, the offender may justify the séxual ‘béhaviour' through
providing the child with his, version of sex: education, which states, that: sex between children
and ‘adults’ is: acceptable: and. that the offender has ‘a:responsibility to ‘trairy the ;child. for later
life: (Berliner & Conte, 1990; Leberg, 1997), Thé abuser builds the child’s, trust (Christiansen
& Blake; 1990; ‘Leberg, 1997; Wyre, 1987; cited, in Howitt, ‘1995; van Dam, :2001); makes
‘him. or. her feel good (Warner, 2000): ‘and ther starts to violate boundari¢s (Christiansen &
Blake, 1.990; van Dam, 2001). This may ‘involve intentionally. entering the bedroom while the
child or young person is undressed), or ‘getting dressed together and exposing himself to the
child.

Offenders often desensitize a child to touch by ‘beginning with non-sexual touching such
as tickling or. stroking the child’s head. ‘Gonversation may also: become more! sexual.
Alternatively; offeridérs may conflise victims by. coritinuing to. talk to the child. about. a
positive unrelated:issue while:they begin touching the, child sexually (Leberg, 1997). The;child
may have no! idea that something inappropriate is happening. The ‘aim:is to progress to’ sexual
touching, ‘first on 'top of clothes and later under of without clothes (Berliner & Conte, 1990;
Christiansen & Blake; 1990; ‘Leberg, 1997; van, Dam, 2001). Thus; ‘the: intention. is ‘to make
the child compliant. with the ‘offender’s sexual. demands and. overcome the child’s resistance
(Finkelhor, 1984; Leberg, 1997; Warner, 2000).

‘In. addition to using psychological grooming to inerease. .complianec,, it is ‘also used ‘to
avoid: disclosure. Children are groomed to'want-to be around thé adult who.is grooming them
(Wolf; 1985). Offenders need:to maintain ‘the child’s cooperation: and secrecy: to achieve this.
One way, that the ‘offender does this is by isolating the ‘child‘and alienating them from others
(Warner, 2000). Leberg (1997) ‘refers to ‘this’ factor as Something: separate ‘from grooming,
others (c.g. van Dam, 2001) consider it to‘be part of the. grooming process. Isolating the.child
creates. a barrier which. prevents the child from Having: a confidant in. whom. to disclose
(Warner, 2000); In addition, ‘the. keeping of seerets ‘acts: as. a source of further isolation
(Lerner; 1993; cited in van ‘Dam; 2001). Children are very good ‘at keeping: secrets when
asked to. Péters. (19911, cited in. Ceci & Brack, 1993) found that 82% of children in: his study
delayed ‘or did not report: an‘event that they had, witnessed, because: the thief'in, the scenario
asked them not to tell:anyone. The’thiefiin this scenario was‘a stranger, to-whom the children
had ‘no loyalty, and. so it is likely that children would;be even, more likely to protect
and loved ‘adult.

Further strategies ‘used by offenders to maintain the: child’s compliance include issuing
threats. and. bribes (Berliner & (Conte, 1990; Christiansen, & Blake, 1990). Bribes, may take
the: form, of: material ‘gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake; 1990). In. addition,
offenders are’ ‘skilled, at ‘using childrén’s natural. vulnerabilities. ‘against theny. For instance,
children. very often have a strong desire to protect ‘their parents. When the. offender informs
them that their ‘parents: would be very hurt if ‘they, found out what they had been doing,
children. may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, 1990). Offerders may also. demonstrate their’
potential for, violence through, violence towards: others, ‘c.g: other tamily members: Thereby.
offenders reinforce the message that ‘they will enact ‘their, threats’ about. hurting’ the: child
and/of the child’s. family.,
