defendant, in 2003, Congress wanted.to ensure that. every ‘perpetrator who abused a, minor in the
future was subject to prosecution for the lifetinic of the minor; but,Congress simultancously was
content to let all. previous perpetrators avoid prosecution whenever their victims turned. twenty-
five. No such intent is manifest.in citherthe text or in Senator Lcahy’s statement.

The reach, of Section 3283 is clear. Because Congress has expressly extended the statute
and. apply. the statute as, Congress intended. In the alternative, however, the statute is—=at worst—=
ambiguous. Ifthe Court takes that. view, it should proceed to’ Landgraf step two.

2. The 2003 Amendment Satisfies Step Two of Landgraf

If the: Court were:to determine that the legislative intent behind, Séction. 3283 is ambiguous,
the inquiry then, extends to the second step of the Landgraf analysis, which cxamines. the
retroactive cffects of the statute: As. the Supreme ‘Court explained in Landgraf, “[a] statute docs

(quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280). Applying Section.3283 here would, have:tione of those
effects. Maxwell’s rights, liabilities, and duties were: governed bythe substantive criminal statutes

liability, ‘the, same, rights, and the same incentives to.retain éviderice. A statute ¢xtending that

period attaches no new’ legal consequences; rather, it preserves the status quo. Therefore, the

‘statute docs not. operate “retrospectively” within. the meaning of Landeraf. See Cruz v. Maypa,
