As to the remaining photographs that are outside the Government’s possession, because
the defendant has copies of those photographs, the originals are not a proper subject of a Rule 17
subpoena. Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in the Government’s letter, Request 11 should
otherwise be denied.
Respectfully submitted,
AUDREY STRAUSS
