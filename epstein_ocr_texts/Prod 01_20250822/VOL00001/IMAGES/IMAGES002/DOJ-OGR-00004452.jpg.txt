the prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted and
sentenced under the new indictment. The state court of appeals rejected Hayes’s challenge to his
conviction, concluding that the prosecutor’s decision to indict on more serious charges was a
legitimate use of available leverage in the plea-bargaining process. Hayes filed for review of his
conviction and sentence in federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court level, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that the prosecutor’s conduct constituted
impermissible vindictive prosecution.

The Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance
of the basic legitimacy of plea bargaining necessarily implies rejection of any notion that a guilty
plea is involuntary in a constitutional sense simply because it is the end result of the bargaining
process.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to believe a crime has been
committed, “the decision whether or not to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a
grand jury, rests entirely in his discretion.” Id. at 364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that
selectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is not improper unless based upon an unjustifiable
standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. Jd.

These principles were reiterated in Wayte v. United States, 470 U.S. 598 (1985), a case
involving the government’s policy of prosecuting only those individuals who reported themselves
as having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed
that the self-reported non-registrants were “vocal” opponents of the registration program who were
being punished for the exercise of their First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court rejected this
argument, stating that the government has “broad discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and
that the limits of that discretion are reached only when the prosecutor’s decision is based on an
unjustifiable standard. /d. at 607-08. Because the passive enforcement policy was not intended to
have a discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.

In Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409 (1976), the Supreme Court considered whether a state
prosecutor acting within the scope of his duties could be sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation
of the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others
had unlawfully conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that “in initiating a
prosecution and in presenting the State’s case,” conduct that is “intimately associated with the
judicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed absolute immunity from a civil suit
for damages. /d. at 430-31. In Harrington v. Almy, 977 F.2d 37 (1st Cir. 1992), the court applied
Imbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not to prosecute. The court noted that “given the
availability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important that
symmetrical protection be available for the decision not to charge.” Jd. at 41 (emphasis in
original).

Finally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821 (1985), the
Supreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to undertake an enforcement action is not
reviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 500-706.
