Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21. Page 155 of 349

the prosecutor indicted him on more serious charges. Hayes was thereafter convicted. and.
‘sentenced under the new indictment. The state: court of appeals rejected, Hayes’ s challenge to his
conviction, concluding that. the: prosccutor’s decision, to indict: on more scrious charges was a.
legitimate. use. of. available leverage. in ‘the. plea-bargaining process. Hayes. filed for review of his
conviction and s sentence.‘in federal court, and although. Hayes lost. at the: district court level, the

impermissible vindictive prosecution.

The Supreme Court.reversed the Sixth Cireuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acecptanec
‘of the basic: legitimacy of plea. bargaining necessarily implies ‘rejection. of any notion that a guilty
plea is involuntary: i in.a.constitutional sense simply because it is the: end. result of the bargaining:
process.” Jd. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause to belicve a.crime has. been,
committed, “the decision whether: or not: to prosecute, and what charge to file or bring before a,
grand jury; rests entirely in his discretion.” Jd. at.364 (emphasis added). The Court explained that.
sclectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is: not.improper unless based. upon an‘unjustifiable
standard such as race, religion, or other arbitrary classification. ./d.

These principles were reiterated in Wavie v. United States, 470 US. 598 (1985), .a.case
involving’ the government’s:policy of prosecuting only those individuals who, reported themselves
as having failed to register with the Sclective Service system. The petitioner in Wayte claimed
that the self-reported non-registrants:were “vocal”.opponents.of the registration program who were
being punished. for the exercise of their First Amendment. rights. The Supreme Court rejected this
argument, stating that the government has “broad, discretion” in deciding whom to prosecute, and,
that the limits of that diseretion are reached only when the Prosecutor's decision is based. on an

havea discriminatory effect, the claim of selective prosecution failed.

Tn.Imblerv:. Pachiman, 424 U.S. 409 (1976), the Supreme Court considered whether.a-state
prosccutor acting’within the scope of his dutics could be sued ‘under 42.U.S.C. § 1983, for violation,
of the defendant’s constitutional rights when the defendant alleged ‘that.the. prosecutor and others
had. unlawfully: ‘conspired to charge and convict him. The Court held that. “in initiating. a.
prosccution and in, presenting the State’s case,” conduct that jis “intimately associated with the:
judicial phase of the criminal process,” the’ prosecutor enjoyed. absolute immunity from a-civil suit.
for damages. Jd. at 430-31. In Harrington v.. Almy, 977 F.2d 37:(1st:Cir. 1992), the court. applied,
Imbler to a challenge to a prosecutor’s decision. not to prosecute. The court:rioted that “given the
availability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes cven more important ‘that
symmetrical. protection be available for the decision :not to charge.” Jd. at 41 (emphasis in.
original).

Finally, in an analogous area of the law, in Heckler ¥. Chaney,.470 U.S. 82:1 (1985), the
‘Supreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision not to ‘undertake an.cnforcement.action ‘is not.
reviewable under the federal Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 500-706.
