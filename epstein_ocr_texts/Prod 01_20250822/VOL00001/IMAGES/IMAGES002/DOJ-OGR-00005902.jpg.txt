Sexual, grooming of children 291

_Despite Ward and Siegert, presenting their Pathways Model a as a 2 comprehensive theory of
process: In a. . comprehensive theory it it is; necessary to consider: the whole j journey from initial
onset'to;the offence and beyond. Ina similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &
DiClemente, 1982),of change considers:not only the action stage,.where’the overt:behaviourzis
charigéd, bur'also the preécontemplation, contemplation, preparationand maintenance: stages, a
theory. of sexual, offending against children needs ‘to consider the whole journey: .As
demonstrated, ‘above;. it is necessary that theories of: aetiology are: coherent: with the
phenomenon they. are attempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending
it is.important that sexual grooming: is also. factored. into the eanation, because it is, part of the
sexual offending phenomenon. Oft § (1984) Pré-condition
Model has:taken. this: approach:

Offence: process

In addition to the; Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, 1984) there:.is one other. model. that
considers the ,offence process’ of} sexual ‘offending. “This is' the Descriptive Model jof the
Offenee ‘Chain (Ward, Louden, Hiidson & Marshall, 1995). Ward. &t. al’s model provides a
much moredetailed account of the offence process | than the Pre-condition. Model. While little
evidence; has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model; Ward. ct. al. used a

grounded. theory approach ‘and ‘developed their ‘model directly ‘from offenders’ experiences.
They identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one ‘relates. ‘to the offender’s

‘background, factors, including ‘their perception of themselves anid ‘their life ae the beginning
of the. offence ‘chain. and whether these factors caused positive; or negative aftect: Stage: two
describes: ‘distal planning of access: to their victim; this: could take the form: ‘of'implicit,, or
explicit planning? or chance. Contact. with the victim takes place. in. stage three. Stage four:
involves Cognitive ‘restructuring, which will result ‘iit either positive Or negative affect. ‘Stage
five. entails proximal planning,. which would cither ‘be selfttocused, victim=focused -or a

mutual-focus.. This: leads: to: stage; six; and. the sexual joffence;, which, is ‘followed by’ further:

cognitive restructuring at.stage seven. This results:in negative.or positive evaluation and future
resolutions regarding conunued.oftending at stage cight. This resolution will. bere to 0 either: avoid
future offending of ‘to persist in an abusive pattetn. Stage il , of: these
resolutions on the offender’s, life.

‘Tt is‘important to, consider how. sexual ‘grooming fits into; and facilitates, ‘the: offence
process, as ‘this understanding:'is likely: to aid the ‘management of offenders and potential
offendérs by identifying the offence: process pridr t6 aii sexual offence taking place. In
addition, it is reasonable:to suggest that motivations not static but could be; affected by later
stages of the ‘grooming and offence process, ¢-g: cognitive distortions developed. later ‘in the
process could. serve: to! reinforce: prior motivation ‘resulting. in ‘am entrenched. deviant sexual
intérest. This' may. prove valuable’to treatment, programmes ¢fforts of reducing motivation 'to
offend.

The grooming process

The current ‘review has identified, three types: of sexual grooming present in the literature
self-grooming; grooming the environment ‘and significant others: and grooming the child.
Each’ of these will be discussed to explore current: understanding of. sexual. grooming.
Uiiderstanding of'the groéming process. and an, ability"to identify sexual. grooming behaviour
