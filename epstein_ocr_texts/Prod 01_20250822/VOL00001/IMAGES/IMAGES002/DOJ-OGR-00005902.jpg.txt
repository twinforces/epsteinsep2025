Sexual grooming of children 291

Despite Ward and Siegert presenting their Pathways Model as a comprehensive theory of
sexual offending, it still only considers aetiology and no consideration is given to the offence
process. In a comprehensive theory it is necessary to consider the whole journey from initial
onset to the offence and beyond. In a similar way that the Transtheoretical Model (Prochaska &
DiClemente, 1982) of change considers not only the action stage, where the overt behaviour is
changed, but also the precontemplation, contemplation, preparation and maintenance stages, a
theory of sexual offending against children needs to consider the whole journey. As
demonstrated above, it is necessary that theories of aetiology are coherent with the
phenomenon they are attempting to explain. While endeavouring to explain sexual offending
it is important that sexual grooming is also factored into the equation, because it is part of the
sexual offending phenomenon. Of the above theories, only Finkelhor’s (1984) Pre-condition
Model has taken this approach.

Offence process

In addition to the Pre-condition Model (Finkelhor, 1984) there is one other model that
considers the offence process of sexual offending. This is the Descriptive Model of the
Offence Chain (Ward, Louden, Hudson & Marshall, 1995). Ward et al.’s model provides a
much more detailed account of the offence process than the Pre-condition Model. While little
evidence has been found to support Finkelhor’s Pre-condition Model, Ward et al. used a
grounded theory approach and developed their model directly from offenders’ experiences.
They identified nine stages of the offence chain. Stage one relates to the offender’s
background factors, including their perception of themselves and their life at the beginning
of the offence chain and whether these factors caused positive or negative affect. Stage two
describes distal planning of access to their victim; this could take the form of implicit, or
explicit planning or chance. Contact with the victim takes place in stage three. Stage four
involves cognitive restructuring, which will result in either positive or negative affect. Stage
five entails proximal planning, which would either be self-focused, victim-focused or a
mutual-focus. This leads to stage six and the sexual offence, which is followed by further
cognitive restructuring at stage seven. This results in negative or positive evaluation and future
resolutions regarding continued offending at stage eight. This resolution will be to either avoid
future offending or to persist in an abusive pattern. Stage nine depicts the impact of these
resolutions on the offender’s life.

It is important to consider how sexual grooming fits into, and facilitates, the offence
process, as this understanding is likely to aid the management of offenders and potential
offenders by identifying the offence process prior to an sexual offence taking place. In
addition, it is reasonable to suggest that motivation is not static but could be affected by later
stages of the grooming and offence process, e.g. cognitive distortions developed later in the
process could serve to reinforce prior motivation resulting in an entrenched deviant sexual
interest. This may prove valuable to treatment programmes efforts of reducing motivation to
offend.

The grooming process

The current review has identified three types of sexual grooming present in the literature—

self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child.

Each of these will be discussed to explore current understanding of sexual grooming.
