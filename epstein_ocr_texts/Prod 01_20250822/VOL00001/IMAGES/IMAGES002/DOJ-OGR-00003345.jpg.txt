2 The Subjects Asserted. That They: Were Motivated by ‘Reasonable
Strategic and, Policy Considerations, Not Improper Influences

In. addition to: reviewing’ the documentary’ evidence, OPR questioned the five ‘subject.
attorneys, all of whom denied. being personally influenced by Epstein’s wealth. or'status in making:
decisions :regarding the investigation, in. the decision to ‘resolve the case: through an NPA, or in.
negotiating the NPA. Villafafia, in particular, was concerned from the outset of the federal
investigation that Epstein. might, try to employ against. the USAO the same pressure that. she
understood, had been used with the State Attorney’s Office, and she proactively took steps to
counter’ Epstcin’s possible influence by meeting with. Acosta and, Sloman to sensitize them to
Epstein’s tactics. Both Acosta and Sloman.told OPR:that'the USAO had handled cases involving
wealthy, high-profile defendants before, including the Abramoff case. .Acosta. told OPR, “(Wc:
tried to treat t [the: ease] fairly, not looking: at. «how wealthy i is he, but alsoun not saying. we cnged | to
believe" ‘it’ S. appropriate. to 20, aftcr somebody’ because of their status. one’ way or ‘the other.” Lourie
told, OPR. that Epstcin’s status may have: g generated | more “front. office” involvement in. the case,
but it did-not affect the outeome,, and. Sloman “emphatically disagree[d]” with the suggestion: that
the USAO’s handling:of the casc had been affected-by Epstein’ s wealth or influential connections.
Other witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony ‘on this point, including the FBI case agents,
who told OPR that-no one ever communicated to them that they ‘should treat; Epstein differently
because of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told OPR that he aid not. ‘tecall anyone at the USAO

and rnflucnec.

OPR takes note: of. but; does not consider dispositive the absence of any affirmative
evidence ‘that the subjects were acting from improper motivations or their denial of such
motivations. Of more significance, and as. discussed more fully below, was the fact ‘that.
contemporancous records support the subjects” assertions that the: decision to pursuc a pre- -charge
resolution, was bascd on ‘various casc- -specific legal and ‘factual considerations.2'* OPR. also

Inthe pre-NPA Ietter, to the USAO,.counsel:recited a:litany-of Epstein’s: ‘pur ported good deeds and charitable
works, ‘including. a trip Epstein: took to. Africa with former President: Clinton-to raise awareness of, AIDS, and counsel,
also noted, that ‘the former President; had been, quoted by New York Magazine. describing Epstein, as “ta committed,

OPR. also considered that all five subjects provided generally consistent explanations regarding the! factors
that.influenced.Acosta‘s decision-to resolve:the federalinvestigation through the: NPA. Sloman, :Menchel, Louric,‘and
