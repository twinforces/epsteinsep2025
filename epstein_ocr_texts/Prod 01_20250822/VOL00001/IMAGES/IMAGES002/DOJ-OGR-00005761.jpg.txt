Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document394_ Filed 10/29/21 Page5of9

Under the Federal Rules, relevant. evidence ‘is generally admissible while irrelevant
evidence 1s categorically inadmissible. Fed. R. Evid. 401,402. Evidence is:relevant if ittends to
make a fact.of consequence to the.action more or.less probable than it would. be without:the
evidence. Fed..R. Evid. 401. In-turn, relevant-evidence must be exeluded, when, its probative
value is substantially outweighed by‘a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing ‘the. issues,,
misleading the jury,’undue delay; wasting time, ‘or necdlessly“presenting ‘cumulative: evidence.
Fed: R. Evid. 403.

Here, testimony:that Mr. Epstcin. allegedly raped Accuser- (or anyone elsc):is irrelevant
tothe charged offenses. See Fed. R. Evid. 401. The indictment docs not, allege that Mr. Epstcin
‘raped, anyone. And Accusér-] has ‘never alleged that Ms. Maxwell knew about or-participated, in
an.alleged rape. Because the conspiracy charged. in the indictment is limited:to enticement and.
transportation, of minors across state lincs.to provide Mr. Epstein with, sexualized:massages, there
is no argument that Accuser-1’s:rape. allegation is rclevant:to, the charged ‘conspiracy. It (and. any
‘other allegation of rape by anyone else) therefore must'be excluded. Fed. R. ‘Evid. 402.

Even if a rape allegation. had some relevance; Rule 403 would still require its exclusion
because the minimal probative value of the evidence is: substantially outweighed. by the danger of
unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading the jury. Fed..R. Evid. 403. Evidence is
unfairlyprejudicial when it has an “undue tendency to suggest decision on an:improper basis,
commonly, though not:necessarily, an emotional one.” Old Chief'v.. United States, 519. U.S. 172,
180 (1997).

Here, any allegation that Mr. Epstein raped.Accuser | (or anyone clsc) will suggest tothe.
jury that it should convict Ms. Maxwell based.on;Mr. 'Epstein’s alleged. conduct and not the

offenses ‘with which she has been charged. Admission of this evidence poses.a. serious risk’ that:
