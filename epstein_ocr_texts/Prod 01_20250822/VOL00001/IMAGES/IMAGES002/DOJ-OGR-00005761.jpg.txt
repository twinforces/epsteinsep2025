Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 394 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page5of9

Under the Federal Rules, relevant evidence is generally admissible while irrelevant
evidence is categorically inadmissible. Fed. R. Evid. 401, 402. Evidence is relevant if it tends to
make a fact of consequence to the action more or less probable than it would be without the
evidence. Fed. R. Evid. 401. In turn, relevant evidence must be excluded when its probative
value is substantially outweighed by a danger of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues,
misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.
Fed. R. Evid. 403.

Here, testimony that Mr. Epstein allegedly raped Accuser-1 (or anyone else) is irrelevant
to the charged offenses. See Fed. R. Evid. 401. The indictment does not allege that Mr. Epstein
raped anyone. And Accuser-1 has never alleged that Ms. Maxwell knew about or participated in
an alleged rape. Because the conspiracy charged in the indictment is limited to enticement and
transportation of minors across state lines to provide Mr. Epstein with sexualized massages, there
is no argument that Accuser-1’s rape allegation is relevant to the charged conspiracy. It (and any
other allegation of rape by anyone else) therefore must be excluded. Fed. R. Evid. 402.

Even if a rape allegation had some relevance, Rule 403 would still require its exclusion
because the minimal probative value of the evidence is substantially outweighed by the danger of
unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, and misleading the jury. Fed. R. Evid. 403. Evidence is
unfairly prejudicial when it has an “undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis,
commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.” Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172,
180 (1997).

Here, any allegation that Mr. Epstein raped Accuser-1 (or anyone else) will suggest to the
jury that it should convict Ms. Maxwell based on Mr. Epstein’s alleged conduct and not the
offenses with which she has been charged. Admission of this evidence poses a serious risk that
