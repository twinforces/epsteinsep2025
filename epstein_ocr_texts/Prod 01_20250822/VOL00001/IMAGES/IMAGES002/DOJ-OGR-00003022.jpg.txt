A. Factual Background

The defendant’s motion is, at its core, premised on a false factual, narrative. The defendant.
alleges,’bascd'on a New York Daily News article, that Boies Schillerand the Government: colluded.
starting in at lcast carly 20.1.6 ‘with the “precise[] design[]” of having the defendant: “charged. with,
perjury.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 10). In. particular, she claims that Boies Schiller met with the:
Government in February 2016, urged the Government to open an investigation of Epstcin and.
Maxwell, told the Government ‘what wasin its files, and ‘met, with the Government. again in the
summer of 2016 to ask if it would. consider charging the defendant with. perjury after her two
depositions. (/d. at 2,8).

That is not.so. While a now former Assistant United States Attorney (“AUSA-1”):met

with a lawyer from Boies Schiller and two other attorneys about Epstein in, February 2016, that:

mecting was not focused on the defendant, and AUSA=1 did ‘not participate in a second mecting:
with those attorneys. Morcover,, that February 2016 mecting pre-dated the depositions that gave:
rise fo the’ perjury counts in the Indictment, which, itself was obtained. more than. four ycars
thercafter.*° The Indictment was instead. the product of an. investigation that was not opened until
late 2018 and. that-had nothing,to do with.a meeting that. had taken place nearly three years carlier
with.an AUSA who played no part in'the decision. to open, the 20:18 ‘investigation and similarly
played:no part in the 2018 investigation itself.
1. The Civil Lawsuit against Maxwell
In.or about September 2015, Giuffre,:represented. by Boies, Schiller, filed.a civil defamation

lawsuit against Maxwell in. the Southern District of' New York. (See. 15:Civ. 7433; (LAP), Dkt.

26"Whilc, as discussed. hercin, the Government has uncovered ‘evidenec of.a phone call. from. onc:
of the attorneys, ‘Stan Pottinger, to AUSA-] in carly May 2016, AUSA-1 has no specific memory
of that call, ‘nor did AUSA-1 provide any notes or records ofthat call to'the team. working:on the
instant. investigation.
