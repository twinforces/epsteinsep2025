Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 88 of 239

A. Factual Background

The defendant’s motion is, at its core, premised on a false factual narrative. The defendant
alleges, based on a New York Daily News article, that Boies Schiller and the Government colluded
starting in at least early 2016 with the “precise[] design[]” of having the defendant “charged with
perjury.” (Def. Mot. 3 at 10). In particular, she claims that Boies Schiller met with the
Government in February 2016, urged the Government to open an investigation of Epstein and
Maxwell, told the Government what was in its files, and met with the Government again in the
summer of 2016 to ask if it would consider charging the defendant with perjury after her two
depositions. (/d. at 2, 8).

That is not so. While a now former Assistant United States Attorney (““AUSA-1”) met
with a lawyer from Boies Schiller and two other attorneys about Epstein in February 2016, that
meeting was not focused on the defendant, and AUSA-1 did not participate in a second meeting
with those attorneys. Moreover, that February 2016 meeting pre-dated the depositions that gave
rise to the perjury counts in the Indictment, which itself was obtained more than four years
thereafter.° The Indictment was instead the product of an investigation that was not opened until
late 2018 and that had nothing to do with a meeting that had taken place nearly three years earlier
with an AUSA who played no part in the decision to open the 2018 investigation and similarly
played no part in the 2018 investigation itself.

1. The Civil Lawsuit against Maxwell

In or about September 2015, Giuffre, represented by Boies Schiller, filed a civil defamation
lawsuit against Maxwell in the Southern District of New York. (See 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt.
°6 While, as discussed herein, the Government has uncovered evidence of a phone call from one
of the attorneys, Stan Pottinger, to AUSA-1 in early May 2016, AUSA-1 has no specific memory
of that call, nor did AUSA-1 provide any notes or records of that call to the team working on the
instant investigation.
