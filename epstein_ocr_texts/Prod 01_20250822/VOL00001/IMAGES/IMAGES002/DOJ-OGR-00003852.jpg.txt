standard to redact the portions of pages 129 to 134 of the Government’s omnibus
memorandum of law and Exhibit 11 that refer to language that is contained in the publicly-
filed Indictment in this case. The information in the Indictment is part of the public record
and, therefore, has a deeply diminished privacy interest. The Government does not
understand any legal basis for sealing the information again. The Government does not object
to the remaining proposed redactions to pages 129 to 134 of the Government’s brief, which
were the redactions originally proposed by the Government. The Government does not object
to the redactions proposed by the defense to Exhibit 11 (with the exception of the language
quoted in the Indictment).
Respectfully submitted,
Laura A. Menninger ad
