percentage points less African American than the estimated percent in the community and 1.15
percentage points less Hispanic than the estimated percent in the community.

29. While the demographics of the master jury wheel are similar to those of community,
they are not identical. Looking at the list of reasons above, the difference between the voter
registration lists and the community could be caused by reason 1| and/or by reason 2 or by reason
3, which explain why differences in the voter registration lists and a randomly drawn master jury
wheel from the voter lists may occur. Alternatively, the difference may be caused by reason 4
and/or reason 5 and/or reason 6 which explain why differences between the master jury wheel
and voter lists may occur.

30. Focusing initially on the difference between a randomly drawn master jury wheel and
the voter registration file, one possible cause (reason 3) is due to chance in randomly selecting
from the voter registration lists. While possible, it is highly unlikely to be a meaningful cause of
the disparity. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random sample drawn from the
voter registration lists. Given the size of the sample drawn, the representation on the master jury
wheel should almost perfectly mirror the demographics of the voter registration lists. It is highly
likely that chance variation would only result in at most a 0.001 difference between the master
jury wheel and the voter registration lists in their demographic characteristics. Hence, the
difference between the community and a randomly drawn sample from the voter registration lists
must be almost exclusively because of differences between the voter registration lists and the
community (reasons 1 and 2). As shown herein, the voter registration lists are a good source
from which to pick a wheel that is representative of the community benchmarks for African
Americans and Hispanics. The absolute disparity between a randomly drawn master jury wheel
from the voter registration lists is only 0.57% for African Americans and 0.33% for Hispanics.
