claiming that the USAO-SDFL made promises that were not contained in the NPA. Nor has she
pointed to anything in the extensive record of either the OPR investigation or the civil litigation
surrounding the NPA that would suggest that the NPA applies to this District, or to the crimes in
the Indictment, or to Maxwell. In the absence of any such evidence—and in the face of substantial
contrary evidence gathered in the civil litigation and OPR investigation—the Court has no
obligation to conduct a hearing.

For similar reasons, the defendant’s motion for discovery should be denied. To the extent
the defendant seeks discovery under Rule 16, she has failed to meet her burden. A defendant
seeking discovery under Rule 16 “must make a prima facie showing of materiality and must offer
more than the conclusory allegation that the requested evidence is material.” United States v.
Urena, 989 F. Supp. 2d 253, 261 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citations omitted). Here, the defendant has
offered nothing more than her conjecture that some unspecified evidence might exist. The motion
should be denied.

I. The Indictment Is Timely

Counts One through Four are timely charged because the applicable limitations period, 18
U.S.C. § 3283 (2003), permits prosecution for offenses “involving the sexual or physical abuse...
of a child” at any time “during the life of the child,” and each of the victims identified in the
Indictment remains alive. Maxwell contends that Section 3283 should not be applied to conduct
that predated its amendment in 2003 (Def. Mot. 2), but that argument is contrary to the text of the
statute, Congress’s clear intent when extending the statute of limitations, and the decisions of other
circuits and district courts in this Circuit. In effect, the defendant’s motion asks this Court to break
new ground, and become the first court to hold that Section 3283 applies only prospectively.
