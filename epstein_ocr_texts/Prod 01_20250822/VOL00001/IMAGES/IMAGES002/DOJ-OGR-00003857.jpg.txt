believe that the information sought is in the possession of the government. Accordingly, it is
not, as theorized by the government, “Giglio or 3500” material. Letter, p. 5. Thus, there is no
“cognizable interest” in “controlling the timing of disclosures,” id., because under the
government’s “willful blindness” policy there would be nothing to disclose.

The final “interest” advanced by the government is in “its own communications.” For
support, the government cites United States v. Carton, No. 17 CR 680 (CM), 2018 WL
5818107, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 19, 2018). Letter, p. 5. However, the communications at issue
in Carton were “Carton’s own communications with the Sports and Entertainment Company,”
not government communications. /d. The government does not explain how third-party
subpoenas would implicate “its own communications,” which it fails to define. None of Ms.
Maxwell’s subpoenas seek government work product or internal communications between
government employees, and the government has no legitimate interest in suppressing third-
party communications.!

But even if the government’s own communications were at issue, the government has
waived any privilege it may have otherwise asserted. In response to Ms. Maxwell’s motions to
suppress, the government voluntarily disclosed and attached several internal emails between
its attorneys. This disclosure (partial though it may be)’ is a waiver of any privilege. See
United States v. Gangi, 1 F. Supp. 2d 256, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 1998) (holding that “privileged
' The government notes, in footnote 1 that it might have standing if asked by a witness or third
party. That has not happened. Indeed, the witnesses at issue, unlike most, have the full force
of Boies Schiller Flexner LLP standing behind them.

? It is not at all clear (and the government has not asserted) that the emails it attached to its
response are all the relevant emails on the issues raised by Ms. Maxwell’s motions. Because
the government’s communications are at issue, and because the government voluntarily
produced some of those communications, Ms. Maxwell has a due process right to all the
relevant communications.
