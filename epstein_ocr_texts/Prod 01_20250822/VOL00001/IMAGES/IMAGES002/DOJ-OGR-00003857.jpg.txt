belicve that the information sought is in. the possession of the government. Accordingly, it is
not, as theorized by the government, “Gig/io-or 3500” material. Letter, p. 5. Thus, there:is no
“cognizable interest?” ‘in. “controlling’the timing of disclosures,” id., because, under the
government’s “willful blindness” policy there would be nothing to disclose.

The final “interest” advanced by the government is in, “its own communications.” For
support, the government: cites, United States v. Carton, No. 17 CR 680 (CM); 2018 WL
‘in Carfon were “Carton’s own communications with the Sports and Entertainment Company,”
not government communications. /d. The government, docs not explain how third-party
subpoenas would implicate “its own.communications,”*which. it fails to define. None of Ms.
Maxwell’s subpoenas seck government work;product or internal, communications between
party communications. ;

But even if the government’s own communications ‘were at ‘issue, the government: has
waived any‘privilege it may. have otherwise. asserted. In response to Ms. Maxwell’s motions to
suppress, the government:voluntarily disclosed and attached several internal emails between,
its attorneys. This disclosure (partial though it may be)? is a waiver of any privilege. See:

United States v.. Gangi, | F. Supp. 2d 256,.263 (S.D.N-Y.. 1998) (holding that “privileged.

' The government notes, in:footnote. ||. thatit.might’have standing if asked by: a witness.or third
party. That has not happened. ‘Indeed, the witnesses ‘at issuc, unlike most, have the full force:
of Boies Schiller Flexner: LLP ‘standing behind them.

“Tt is not at all:clear (and the government.has not asserted) thatthe emails: it attached to its
response are all the relevant emails on the issucs raiscd’by Ms. Maxwell’s motions. Because
the government’s communications arc at.issue, and. because the government. voluntarily
produced some’ of those communications, Ms. Maxwell has a due ‘process, right to all the.
relevant conimunications.
