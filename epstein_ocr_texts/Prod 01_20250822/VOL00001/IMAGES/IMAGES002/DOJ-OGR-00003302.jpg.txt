4. Acosta Attempts to Revise the NPA. § 2255 Language concerning.
Monetary Damages, but the Defense. Does Not Accept It

Acosta undertook, to respond to defense counsel’s continuing concern. about' the § 2255
provision. He: sent. to Deputy Assistant. Attorney Gencral Sigal. Mandclker language that. he:
proposed including in a revision to the: NPA’s § 2255 implementation section. Mandelker
forwarded.the: language'to her-counterpart:in, the Civil Division, who responded to Mandelker and.
Acosta that he did not have “any. insight” fo offer. On December 19, 2007, after Acosta and.
Sloman had. a phone conversation. with Starr and Lefkowitz, Acosta sentto Sanchez! a letter
proposing to: resolve “our disagreements over interprctation[]” by replacing the cxisting language:
‘of the NPA relating to § 2255 with a provision that would.read:

Any ‘person, ‘who ‘while a. minor, ‘was a. victim, ofa. violation of an
offense enumerated in, Title 18, United States Code, Scetion ‘2255,
will have the same rights to proceed under Section 2255 as she
would ‘have had, if’ Mr. ‘Epstein, [had] ‘been tricd. federally: and
convicted. of an enumerated offense. For purposes of implementing
this ‘paragraph, the United. States shall provide Mr: Epstein’s
attorneys ‘with a list. of individuals ‘whom it was prepared, to,
name... as victims of.an cnumeérated offense by:Mr. Epstein. Any
judicial authority interpreting this provision, including any authority
determining which evidentiary: burdens if' any a plaintiff must mect,
shall consider that it is the intent. of the parties to place ‘these
identified victims in, the same position as they would have been had
Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No moré; no less.

Acosta also.noted that he-had resisted his: prosecutors’ urging to declare the NPA. breached by the:
defense delays.'*’

Lefkowitz responded by Ictter a few days later, suggesting that.Acosta’s proposal. raised
“several troubling questions” and that “the: problem. arises from. the incongruity that exists when.
attempting to fit a federal civil remedies statute into‘a-criminal plea, agreement.” !** Ina.follow-up
letter'to Acosta, to'address. the USAO’s concern, that; Epstcin was ‘intentionally delaying the entry’
of his guilty plea, Lefkowitz: asserted. that “any impediment to the résolution at'issuc is a direct:
cause ofthe disagrecinients between the partics,” and. that defeiise counsel had “at all times made
and. will continue to make sincere cfforts to resolve and finalize: issucs as expeditiously: as
possible.”

Acosta told OPR that despite this assurance from defense counsel, he was “increasingly
frustrated” by Epstein’s desiré to-take an “1:1th-hour-appeal” to the Department so soon before the
189 ; As described in. detail in Chapter Three, Acosta’s December, 19; 2007 letter-also addressed defense objections
to:notifying the-victims about the NPA:and the state plea.
ASR After Starr and‘Lefkowitz had another conv. ersation with, Acosta and Sloman, ‘Lefkowitz sent a second letter
to: Acosta:reiterating:concerns with the; §. 2255: provision, sand. asserting'that’the provision was “inherently flawed_and,
becoming truly. unmanageable.” In.the end, ‘the defense team rejected Acosta’s December, 19;.2007. NPA:modification,
letter:
