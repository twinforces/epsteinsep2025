Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 334 Filed 08/13/21 Page9of10
no other theory of relevance (including that the materials are exculpatory or otherwise relate to
the criminal charges at issue), and on this independent basis, the requests fail.

Request 8 seeks “all” photographs, diaries, journals, or other documentary evidence
obtained from “any” person who has accused Maxwell. The request, another fishing expedition,
is plainly unjustified under the Nixon test. The first problem relates to specificity. As above, the
words “all” and “any” do not “evince specificity.” United States v. Tagliaferro, No. 19-CR-472
(PAC), 2021 WL 980004, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 2021). Here, Maxwell does not attempt to
narrow the request and instead seeks a// materials obtained from any person who has accused
Maxwell—at any point, without any limitations. Nixon requires greater specificity. See Nixon,
418 U.S. at 698-70. In addition, the requests fail because Maxwell has not established the
relevance of all of those materials. Under Rule 17(c), the moving party must show that all of the
requested material is relevant. Cf United States v. Pena, No. 15-CR-551 (AJN), 2016 WL
8735699, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 12, 2016). Clearly, the request seeks materials related to people
who are not referenced in the Indictment. Maxwell has not made any kind of showing why those
materials are relevant to the criminal charges she faces in this case. Thus, the request is
improper.

Request 9 seeks the same evidence as the third request in the proposed subpoena to
Subpoena Recipient-2. For the reasons discussed above, that request fails.

Finally, Request 10 seeks EVCP materials. As discussed above, the only plausible theory
of relevance for those materials is impeachment, and as such Maxwell has not established the
relevance of those materials for purposes of the Nixon analysis.

In sum, none of the requests contained in these two subpoenas satisfy the Nixon factors.
As a result, the requests are DENIED in full.
