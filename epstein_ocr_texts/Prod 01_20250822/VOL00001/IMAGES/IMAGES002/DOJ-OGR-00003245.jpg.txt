on the defense team believes that the federal investigation in this
matter has been for show.

Nor are your arguments that I have violated the Ashcroft memo, the
USAM or any other policy well taken. As Chief of the Criminal
Division, I am the person designated by the US Attorney to exercise
appropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are
appropriate and consistent with the Ashcroft memo and the USAM
— not you.

As for your statement that my concerns about this case hurting
Project Safe Childhood are unfounded, I made it clear to you that
those concerns were voiced by the US Attorney.®’ Whether or not
you are correct, matters of policy are always within his purview and
any decisions in that area ultimately rest with him.

Finally, you may not dictate the dates and people you will meet with
about this or any other case. If the U.S. Attorney or the First
Assistant desire to meet with you, they will let you know. Nor will
I direct Epstein’s lawyers to communicate only with you. If you
want to work major cases in the district you must understand and
accept the fact that there is a chain of command — something you
disregard with great regularity.

Villafafia acknowledged to OPR that as Criminal Division Chief, Menchel had authority to
deviate from the Ashcroft Memo requiring that guilty pleas be to the most serious readily provable
offense. She disagreed, however, with his representation about her initial meeting with Acosta
and Sloman regarding the Epstein investigation, noting that Menchel had not been at that
meeting. Villafafia told OPR that no one had communicated to her the “concerns” Menchel
mentioned, and she had not been given an opportunity to respond to those concerns.”

A week later, Villafafia replied to Menchel’s email, reiterating her concerns about the
process and that filing charges against Epstein was not moving forward:

Hi Matt -- My trial is over, so I now have [ ] time to focus back on

this case and our e-mail exchange. There are several points in your
6? Neither Menchel nor Villafafia could recall for OPR to what concerns they were referring. In commenting
on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney noted that Acosta’s concerns were “the possibility that bringing a case with
serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of
trafficking laws and result in an aggregate greater harm to trafficking victims.”
ob Menchel confirmed to OPR that he was not involved in the decision to initiate the federal investigation.
69 Villafafia characterized Menchel’s email as “meant to intimidate” and told OPR that she felt “put in [her]
place” by him. She perceived that Menchel was making it clear that she should not “jump the chain of command.”
Menchel, however, asserted to OPR that Villafafia had a “history of resisting supervisory authority” that warranted.
