Division ‘forwarded. to Roth the prior defense: submissions, describing them as’ “an ‘enormous
amount-of material” regarding the Epstcin matter. On June 3, :2008, Sloman sent:to Roth a.lengthy.
letter:from Sloman.to'the Deputy’ Attorney. General, recounting in detail the history of negotiations
with Epstcin’s counsel. culminating in. the NPA, and addressing. Epstein’s. claims of professional.
misconduct: Among the documents submitted with:the letter were the prosecution memorandum,

ene. of the: ‘proposed charging documents, and the NPA with its addendum and Acosta’s
December 19,2007 Ictter to Sanchez.

AS the. revicw was ongoing in the Office ofthe Deputy Attorney General, State Attorney
Krischer:mentioned.to the: USAO’s West Palm.Beach. manager that.Krischer and-Epstein’s local
defense attorney Jack: Goldberger had arrived at a resolution of Epstcin’s case that would involve:
a.90-day jail term, but Krischer provided no further information. Upon, learning of this, Villafafia.
wrote to her immediate: supervisor: “Please tell:me that. you. are joking, Maybe we should throw’
him [Epstein] .a‘partyand tell him'we are sorry to have bothered him.” Villafafia.and her immediate
supervisor later had phone and email. cxchanges with Krischer and.with Epstcin’s local counscl to
insist that the state plea comply: with the terms of:the NPA, or “we will:considcer it a breach. of the:
agreement.and procced. accordingly.”'”!

Deputy Attorncy General. Filip told OPR he had never heard, of Epstein. before récciving:
Starr’s letter. Following the office’s standard. protocol, Starr’s letter-was handled by John Roth,
an. expericneed. senior. federal prosecutor who had. served. some years before as an. AUSA..in the
USAO. ‘Roth also told.OPR that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR.
that he did:not conduct.an independent ‘investigation, interview witnesses, or mect with Epstcin’s.
counsel, and ‘instead, limited his review to ‘written materials submitted by Epstcin’s attorneys and.
by Sloman.to the Deputy Attomey' General’s office, as.well as materials that the defense team and.
the USAO had previously provided. to CEOS and. the: Criminal Division front office, and. that
CEOS furnished to him. Roth discussed the matter with, two:scnior staff colleagues, as well as
with the Deputy Attorney General, who also reviewed the ‘submissions.

Roth. told. OPR that it was. his understanding that Epstcin had reneged on the NPA, and
because :he believed:the NPA was.a.“dead Ictter,” he didnot review: the terms of the agreement or
ratify it posthoc. On the other hand, Deputy Attorney Gencral Filip told OPR. he understood. that:
the NPA was still in effect and that Epstein was trying to undermine'the:federal jurisdictional, basis.
for the agreement. Apart from addressing Epstein’s federalism. arguments, however, Deputy’
Attorney Gencral Filip did not' belicvé it was the “mission” “of the Office of the Deputy Attorney
Gencral.to ‘review the Epstein. case de novo‘or to examine. the NPA’s terms or determine whether
the NPA.reached.the “right balance” between state and fedcral, ‘punishment. He: told OPR, “We
heard.an appeal. . . . [Epstein] wanted.a. meeting to argue for relicf.. We didn’t give him a. meeting
and we. didnt give: him [any] relict.” Deputy. Attorney General Filip told OPR that ‘no one in, his
office who looked at Epstcin’s arguments “felt that it'was a sympathetic; appeal.” In particular, he
told OPR. that defense counsel’s: argument ‘that there was no: basis for a federal. prosecution. was
“ludicrous,” and. the assertion that the USAO’s investigation .of Epstcin:was politically motivated,
“just. seemed, unscrious.”

a7. Villafafia ‘urged Sloman, “Someone really :needs'to talk to'Barry.”
