four Rule 1'7(¢)(3) subpoenas in a séaled. opinion. dated August 13,2021, and. the Court. ordered.
defense counscl.to inform:the Court:whether they seck any scaling or redactions. (Dkt. No. 3.18).
The defense has responded that'they seck.no redactions, and that they believe the burden: to justify
any redactions is on-the Government: (Dkt. No. 323).

Opinion and Order, the Government is unable to propose or justify any redactions. For instance,

counsel, ‘who have informed the Government that they are unable to —provide a copy of those:

documents absent: further order.of this Court. Accordingly, the Government moves for a limited.
