That They “Try to Work It Out”

In ‘the: late afternoon. of. _ Wednesday. September 19, 2007, Villafafia expressed her

agreement to Louric ‘and thei incoming West Palm Beach manager, ‘identifying all of the provisions
she had “specifically discussed with [the defense team] and rejected, that they have re-inserted into
the agreement.” (Emphasis ‘in original): Villafafia opined, “This is NOT good faith negotiations.”
Lourie :responded.that he would “reach outto Alex’ to discuss.”

Louric immediately emailed Acosta the following:

I looked atthe latest draft from Jay [Lefkowitz] and I:must agree
with. Maric. Based on:my:-own. conversations with. him, his: draft:is
out of left ficld. He claims to. orally agree to our terms.and ‘then
sends ‘us a document that is the opposite. I suggest we simply. tell
him that: his counter offer ‘is rejected and. that we; intend to move
forward with our case.

Acosta replied:

Why’ don’t we just:call him. Tell him.

L. ‘You.agrec, and then change things.

2. ‘That's ‘not acceptable, and is in bad. faith. Stop it or we'll
indict.

3. Try to work it out.

It scems that. we are; close, and it[’]s worth trying to, overcome what
has to, be painfully’. . . annoying negotiating tactics.

[t]his ‘negotiation was a‘pain, but if'it was the'right position, the fact

‘that you've, got. annoying, counsel onthe other side doesn’t. it make
it less ofa right. position. You.tcll them stop being annoying, you
‘try to'work it out, and if not, then-you. indict.

In-response to Acosta’s instruction, Lourie responded, “Ok will.do.” He.also, forwarded to
Acosta ‘the, latest version, of the USAO draft “hybrid” plea. agreement that ‘Villafafia had. sent' to

Lefkowitz the previous day, which Louric: had: requested and obtained. from Villafafia. carlicr that.
