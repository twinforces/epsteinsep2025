1 MS. McCAWLEY: I think we are on the same page.

2 THE COURT: I think talking about the earlier period.
3 MS. McCAWLEY: Prior to Epstein, no, no, she doesn't

4 have a claim with respect to that.

5 THE COURT: Anything else?

6 MS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, I just want to point out

V again that our production -- you asked us to complete that. We
8 have gone through and run over 200 search terms. We have

9 produced all of those communications she has had with all of

10 those individuals. The things that we have not produced are

Le the criminal investigation records. I know your Honor is going
i to address that. I would like to be very clear there.
13 The point there is that she has said in the motion to
14 stay papers that she filed Tuesday that she needs to have that
LS information so she can decide whether she is going to be

16 asserting her Fifth Amendment privilege. Truthful testimony

cy shouldn't have to be crafted, your Honor. She shouldn't need
18 to know what agency is investigating her in order to decide

a We. whether or not she is going to be asserting her Fifth Amendment
20 privilege.
Al We do have with us, your Honor, for an in camera
22 submission, if you would like it. That is the way that courts
23. have dealt with this issue in the past. When there is a claim
24 from an agency that the disclosure of that investigation could
25 harm the investigation, we can submit that to you for in camera
