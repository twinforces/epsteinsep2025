4. -FRPC 4-8:4 — Conduct 'Prejudicial'to the Administration of Justice

ERPG 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall-riot engage in conduct.involving dishonesty, fraud,
deccit, or misrepresentation.

FRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from, engaging in conduct in connection with. the practice
of law that. is prejudicial to the administration, of justice..

In.dVorida, Bar v. Frederick,, 756 So..2d 79, 87 (Fla..2000), the court noted that FRPC
4-8.4(d) is. not. limited. to conduct. that, occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can. be applied to
“conduct in:connection.with the practice of law.” In.Jlorida Barve Shankman, 41 So. 3d 166, 172
(Fla.2010), forcxample, an attorney’s continuous hiring'and firing of firms to assist.in:the client’s
‘matter resulted ‘in delayed, resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC, 4-8.4(d). due
tothe. delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the Clicnt. 701,

20 OPR. also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities: of,a Prosecutor. Nothing-in the text of that: rule,
however, was relevant;to the issues;addressed.in this Report: A:comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes;that Florida has,
adopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of: Criminal Justice Relating to the; Prosecution Function.

These “standards,” however, are not binding rules of conduct but rather ‘Proy. ide, guidance:to prosecutors. Indeed, the
ABA has: expressly stated that these: standards “fare not intended to serve:as the basis for the imposition of: professional
discipline, tovercate substantive or procedural. rights:for accused orconvicted persons; to create. a.standard.of care, for
civil liability; or to serve asa predicate for.amotion'to suppress evidencesor dismiss:a charge.” OPR does’not consider:

the ABA: standards as binding onthe conduct of. Department prosecutors.
