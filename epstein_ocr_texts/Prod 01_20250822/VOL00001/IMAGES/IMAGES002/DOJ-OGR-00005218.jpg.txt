into account the fact that it 1s the partics, rather than the Court, who
have'a. full grasp of the nuances and the strength and'weaknesses of
the case... Expericiice indicates that in, the majority of situations
questioning’ by counsel would be more likely:to fulfill this need [for
information upon which to ‘base the intelligent ‘exercise of
peremptory challenges] than an exclusive cxamination in ‘general
terms by the trial Court.
United States v. [ble, 630.F.2d 389, 395 (Sth Cir. 1980).

‘significant possibility of prejudice, the cursory’ questioning by the ‘court’was not:enough.”). A
district court; is required, under Davis, to determine; what: cach, juror may’ have heard or read.and
how it may have affected his attitude toward the trial, and whether any juror’s: impartiality had
been destroyed. Jd; see also Silverthorne v. United States, 400 F.2d 627, 638 (9th Cir. 1968)
