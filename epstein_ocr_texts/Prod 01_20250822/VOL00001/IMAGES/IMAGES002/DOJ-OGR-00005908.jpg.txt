Sexual, grooming of children 297

Towards ‘a. new definition of sexual ‘grooming. of children.

The definitions of sexual grooming presented, at the start of this review do not reflect the
complexity of: the ‘sexual ‘grooming’ of children, ‘which is' demonstrated ‘in ‘the previous

grooming, while still/being casy't6 understand. We propose thé following:
