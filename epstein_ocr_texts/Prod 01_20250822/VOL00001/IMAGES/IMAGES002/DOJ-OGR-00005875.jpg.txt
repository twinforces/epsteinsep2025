Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse 963
which makes the definitional and measurement process even more complex
as each of these stages must be delineated and validly measured, and this
must be done with the proposed sequencing as well. For example, Wyre’s
(1987) proposed stages for intrafamilial abuse involved 13 separate steps,
the first 10 of which according to the author can be identified as groom-
ing behaviors. As Howitt (1995) pointed out, this account of the abuse cycle
makes it “appear a relatively short-term and repetitive process” (p. 85), which
certainly is not representative of all cases of child sexual abuse.

GROOMING AS A DEVIANT PROCESS
Part of the difficulty in identifying and clarifying a useful definition of groom-
ing is the fact that many behaviors used by perpetrators appear quite similar
to behaviors seen in normal adult-child relationships. Buying gifts for chil-
dren or taking them on private outings obviously are not always precursors
to sexual abuse. Using the male sports world as an example, Hartill (2009)
wrote that “in preparing for the abuse, the perpetrator is able to use such
‘disinhibiting’ techniques through drawing on practices and discourses that
are, to varying degrees, a normative feature within many, if not all, male
sports contexts” (p. 239). Obviously part of the reason for this similarity to
normative behavior is that the potential abuser does not want to be detected
and thus wants to disguise what he is setting out to accomplish. In addition,
it must be recognized that not all sexual offenders use grooming techniques.
Groth, Hobson, and Gary (1982) differentiated between “child molesters”
and “child rapists.” Part of this distinction for these authors stems from their
observation that child molesters use a grooming process on their victims,
whereas child rapists do not, as their assaults occur suddenly. These authors
also pointed out that child molesters are much more common than child
rapists. Alternatively, some authors seem to construe grooming behaviors
as mirroring behaviors seen in dating relationships between two consenting
adults. For example, Herman (1981) wrote that sexually abusive fathers make
an attempt to “court” their daughters by giving them flowers or presents (e.g.,
expensive jewelry or lingerie).
THE PREVALENCE OF GROOMING
Because the definition of grooming varies from study to study, currently there
is no way to know precisely how prevalent grooming is because each study
employs some variant of the definition. Nevertheless, there have been several
empirical studies conducted with child molesters to determine what specific
methods they frequently use to choose their victims, initiate the abuse, and
keep their victims from disclosing. Other researchers have chosen to focus
