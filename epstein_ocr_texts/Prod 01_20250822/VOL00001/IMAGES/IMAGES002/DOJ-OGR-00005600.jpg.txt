Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 384 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page6of12
rejected by the Court which ordered disclosure at the same time as the government's witness list,
Rule 404(b) notice, exhibits, and 3500 materials no later than October 11, 2021, so that the
Defense would not be surprised at trial and because of “the need for the parties to litigate co-
conspirator issues in advance of trial....”” Dkt. 335 at 3.

The government seized multiple electronic devices, including computers and servers
from alleged co-conspirator Epstein. These devices contain hundreds of thousands of statements
spanning decades. The emails on the devices are to and from many other individuals. Many of
the emails are cryptic, subject to interpretation, and appear to be outside of the scope of either
conspiracy alleged in the S2 Indictment. It is impossible for Ms. Maxwell to identify any
statement that she may need to litigate in advance of trial and, even if she wanted to do so, any
attempt would be futile because the government could avoid any issue by simply picking some
other statement. Absent pre-trial identification of any alleged co-conspirator statement, Ms.
Maxwell will be forced to, during trial, object to any proffered statement, request a recess,
identify whether the purported statement was actually produced in discovery, and at some point,
litigate the admissibility of the statement. Of course, this is precisely what the Court’s Order was
intended to avoid.

Given the amount of discourse over this topic, the government must understand what the
Court ordered it to disclose. It has chosen, however, to avoid and violate the Court’s Order by
attempting to overstuff an already full sandbag by ignoring both the plain language and spirit of
the Order mandating disclosure. Instead of simply disclosing the purported statements the
government has directed Ms. Maxwell back to the hundreds of thousands of “statements”
produced or to be produced in the case.
