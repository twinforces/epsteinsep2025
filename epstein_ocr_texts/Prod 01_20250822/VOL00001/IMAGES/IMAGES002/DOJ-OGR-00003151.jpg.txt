the court and defense counsel that it recognizes and has complied with its disclosure obligations
under Brady,’ defendants’ request for immediate or otherwise early
production of Brady materials is denied.” (internal citation omitted) (quoting United States v.
Perez, 940 F. Supp. 540, 553 (S.D.N. Y.1996))); Gallo, 1999 WL 9848, at *8 (denying defendant’s
motion to compel production of purported Brady material based on Government’s representations
that “it is aware of its obligations under Brady .. . and will produce any Brady material to the
defense well before trial”); United States v. Campo Flores, No. 15 Cr. 765 (PAC), 2016 WL
5946472, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 12, 2016) (“The Government represents that it is aware of its
obligation under Brady; that it has complied; and will continue to comply. That is sufficient to

extensive efforts to review its files for any material warranting disclosure, and its commitment to
continue meeting its disclosure obligations, the motion should be denied.

For similar reasons, the motion for disclosure of Giglio material should be denied as
premature. The Government is fully aware of its obligation to disclose impeachment material, is

such material several weeks in advance of trial. As noted above, that is consistent with governing
law in this Circuit, and the defendant cites no authority for the proposition that she is entitled to
such material as much as four months in advance of trial. Courts in this Circuit have repeatedly
refused to compel disclosure of impeachment or Giglio material well in advance of trial, and the
defense has provided no particularized basis for even earlier disclosure here. See United States v.
Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 701 (1974) (“Generally, the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is
insufficient to require its production in advance of trial.”); Campo Flores, 2016 WL 5946472, at
