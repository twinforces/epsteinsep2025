resolution. of the case to ensure Epstein’s ‘victims were given an opportunity’ to attend the ‘plea.
hearing, ‘and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstcin’s crimes, presented a. glaring contrast:
with Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstcin’s attorneys, which. included. the ‘unusual
courtesy of allowing them to-preview and respond to the USAQ’s draft victim notifications. This
contrast added to the:victims’ pereeption that: they: had been treated -unfairly, a view’ shared. by the
public.

Nothing in. the documentary record suggests that..Acosta, thought through the issuc. of
determining which. victims would be notified by the staté, or that he'took any steps to ensure that
all ofthe: known federal-victims reccived. information about the state plea. hearing: Instead, as with.
his decision, to resolve the ‘federal investigation through a state-based. resolution, Acosta.cxercised.
poor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation, and the victims,
but. also. failed. fo consider the full consequences of those decisions or what. was needed. to
implement them. Acosta’s’failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility
for. making: notifications entirely to the State Attorney’ 's discretion reflected poorly on:the USAO
and, the: Department as.a whole. It left. victims in the dark about an important proceeding that
resolved the federal investigation, an:investigation about which,the' USAO had communicated with
victims for months. It also ultimately ercated the misimpression:that;the; Department-intentionally.
sought,to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state:
proceéding. Acosta failéd'to ensure that victims. were afforded an. opportunity'to attend a hearing,
that was related.to their own cases and. thus failed. to ensure: that: victims: were treated. with.
forthrightness and dignity.

ORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN.

WHICH SHE DESCRIBED. THE CASE AS. “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID

From September:24, 2007, when the NPA ‘was signed, ‘until. after Epstcin’s Junc 30,2008
State court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three
victims that. the g government, had signed a an NPA and that, if. Epstein ‘complied with ‘its terms, the:
interacted wrth several. victims and. their attorneys ‘and, Villafana contacted victims’ attomey
Bradley Edwards to encourage him to attend the state court: plea. hearing, but she did. not: inform.
wictims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal. investigation.

As described in Part One of this: chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and.
co-case ‘agent began notifying victims about the NPA.**” .A fter-speaking to three victims, however,
the. FBI case’ agent b beeame concerned. that. informing 3 the victims: s about the NPA and the monetary

Mr. Epstein for money,’ and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it-was right.” The case

0 Although Wild: disputed that she was informed of the:resolution ofthe federal case, the case agent’s email to
