the government claims, it would not have precluded even the SDFL from bringing charges
arising out of Accuser-2’s allegations of conduct in the 1990s. The government cannot seriously
make such an argument.

Even the vague contours of the limitations on Epstein’s immunity, however, are absent
from the co-conspirator immunity provision. And while the government claims it would be
“exceedingly strange” to interpret the co-conspirator immunity provision more broadly than
Epstein’s immunity provision (Opp. 16), as explained in Part II above, such an interpretation is
entirely consistent with the government’s focus on Epstein vis-a-vis potential co-conspirators. It
would be “exceedingly strange,” however, for a federal prosecutor who intended to limit co-
conspirator immunity to specific conduct or specific offenses to omit such limitations from the
text of an immunity provision in a non-prosecution agreement.

Unable to explain the absence of such limiting language, the government resorts to the
reductio ad absurdum argument that unless the Court writes into the NPA the language the
government now wishes had been included in 2007, Ms. Maxwell can claim that “she is immune
from prosecution for any federal crime, during any time period, anywhere, in the United States.”
Opp. 3 (emphasis in original). Ms. Maxwell makes no such argument, and a faithful
interpretation of the NPA leads to no such conclusion. Ms. Maxwell contends only that a
provision that immunizes “potential co-conspirators of Epstein” precludes their prosecution for
conduct allegedly done in conspiracy with Epstetn—conduct that even the United States
Attorney for this District has characterized as a “prequel” to offenses by Epstein that the NPA
undisputedly immunizes. See, e.g., Dienst, J., Valiquette, J., Winter, T., and Fitzpatrick, S.
