offers no reasonable alternative interpretation.

Unlike: Annabi.and its progeny; the NPA here:contains: significant evidence of the:parties’
intent to apply the co-conspirator immunity’ provision, outside the SDFL. "While the: provision,
grariting immunity to Epstein himself expressly limits his immunity to prosecutions. “in this,
District,” NPA. at 2, the co-conspirator. immunity provision contains no:such limitation.

Inc., 821 F.3d 297, 309 (2d Cir, 2016); seeralso Collins v. Univ. of Notre Dame Du Lac, 929 F.3d
830, 841 (7th Gir. 201.9) (noting “common, if not automatic presumption” that.“when parties to:

2007) (same). Thus,’the appropriate inference:here is that:the parties intended to limit Epstein’s:
immunity, but not immunity’ for potential co-conspirators, to prosecutions in‘the Southern
District! of Florida (“SDFL’).

The ‘government offers no.reasonable alternative explanation. for the contrasting language
in‘the two provisions. Instead, it: argues that: because’ the parties limited:Epstein’s immunity. to
thé SDEL, they. must have meant to limit co-conspirators’ iminunity to 'thé SDFL- as well, but
must have forgotten. to include the appropriate language. This argument—that the use of
different language in parallel provisions. compels an. inference that /dentical, rather than. different’

meanings, are:intended—turns fundamental contract interpretation on its head. See, e.g., Bank of

reasonable understanding:of:the parties as to the terms of:the agreement.” Cnited States v. Gonzalez, 93 FP. App’x
