‘of the: state’s victim, interviews and. partial, transcripts provided by defense counsel. 36 Villafana.
also pursued. other investigative steps, which, included working with the FBI to locate an cxpert:
‘witness ‘to to testify; about the effect of'sexual, abuse on: victims. She also continued collecting: s records
activity. On ‘several occasions, Villafafia ‘sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable
national. expertise in, child exploitation, cases, about. legal :issues' relating to the: case, such, as
whether charges she was considering required proof that the-defendant knew a,minor victim’s age.

USAO procedures generally required that a proposed, indictment be accompanied by a.
prosccution memorandum from the AUSA. handling: x-the case. The prosecution memorandum was
expected to explain the:factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and.address any: significant
procedural, factual, and Icgal issucs of which the AUSA. was aware; ‘witness-rclated, issues;
expected defenses; and sentencing issucs. Routine: prosecutions, could be. approved by lower-level
supervisors, but.in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and.
approval. by the: Criminal Division. Chicf, the FAUSA, or even.the U.S. Attorney.

Accordingly, Villafafia. drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum, directed to Acosta,
Sloman, Menchel, (who had replaced. Sloman as the USAO’s, Criminal Division Chief theprevious
October, when Sloman became'the FAUSA), Lourie, and her immediate supervisor, dated. May 1,
2007, supporting a proposed:60-count indictment that charged Epstein with various federal crimes
relating to sexual. conduct with.and trafficking of:minors. The: ‘prosccution memorandum. sct forth.
legal. issues and potential defenses relating to cach, proposed. charge; explained. why certain. other
‘statutes were rejected as proposed charges; described the evidence supporting cach. count and,
potential. evidentiary issues; and ‘addressed the viability and credibility of cach of the victims who
were. expected to testify at-trial.

Villafafia’s immediate ‘supervisor told OPR. that she read the prosccution memorandum,
had. only a few ‘small edits to the indictment, and advised Lourie that she approved. of it. The:
immediate supervisor told OPR. that-she viewed the case as ‘prosecutable, but recognized that the
case ‘Was. sempre and ‘that. Villafaiia would need, co-counsel.

proposed indictment “ ‘were > very ‘thorough and contained a ‘lot of hard, work, ” but: that he wanted to
employ’ a different ‘strategy for charging the casc, focusing ‘initially. only on the ‘victims ‘that:
presented, “the toughest cases” for Epstein— meaning those about whom Epstein had riot already’
raised credibility:issucs to use ‘in cross-cxamination. .Louric told OPR that although. he had some:
‘concerns’ .about the casc—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on, certain, legal, issucs
and. the eredibility challenges ‘some of the victims would. face—he did. not.sec those concerns as
insurmountable. and was gencrally-in favor of going forward:with the prosecution.

Although indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach. office usually: did ‘not ‘require:
approval, in Miami, in, this’ case, Lourie understood. that * ‘[b]ecause there was front: office
involvement from the g get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go

February 20; 2007, and thereafter furnished the transcripts.
