hearsay. See id. at 246 (majority op.) (charging decisions proper subjects for cross-examination
only “if otherwise admissible”); Hill, 2014 WL 198813, at *1-2 (precluding cross examination of
agent regarding district attorney’s charging decision as inadmissible hearsay).

The Government’s prior charging decisions and the bases for them are irrelevant,
hearsay, and disruptive to the trial. They should not be admitted.

B. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Length of And

Investigative Steps Taken During Current or Prior Investigations

For similar reasons, the defense should be precluded from offering evidence or arguing to
the jury about the investigative steps taken during the Florida Investigations or this Office’s
investigation, including the duration of those investigations.

1. Applicable Law

It is settled law that the jury should “base its decision on the evidence or lack of evidence
that had been presented at trial.” United States v. Saldarriaga, 204 F.3d 50, 52 (2d Cir. 2000)
(per curiam). The Government’s “failure to utilize some particular technique or techniques does
not tend to show that a defendant is not guilty of the crime with which he has been charged.” Jd.
at 53; see, e.g., United States v. Ngono, 801 F. App’x 19, 24 (2d Cir. 2020) (summary order)
(“We have held that a district court does not commit error in instructing the jury that the
Government has no legal obligation to use any particular investigative technique in preparing its
case.”). While a defendant “may comment on the failure of proof in the record, such as the
absence of forensic evidence in the form of voice, handwriting, or fingerprint analysis,” such
comment becomes improper when it encompasses the further argument that “the government had
failed to undertake to procure such evidence.” United States v. Londono, 175 F. App’x 370, 375
