“While the Constitution guarantees a fair trial through the Due Process Clauses . . . it defines the
basic elements of a fair trial largely through the several provisions of the Sixth Amendment.’”
Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617, 633 (1989) (citations omitted). “The
right of an accused in a criminal trial to due process is, in essence, the right to a fair opportunity
to defend against the State’s accusations. The rights to confront and cross-examine witnesses and
to call witnesses in one's own behalf have long been recognized as essential to due process.”
Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 294 (1973). And as noted, the defendant cites no legal
authority supporting the proposition that the Government’s actions during its investigation have
somehow deprived her of a fair trial or otherwise violated her due process rights. In short, none
of Maxwell’s allegations of misconduct rises to the level of a due process violation.

Dismissal of Counts Five and Six of the Indictment would be all the more unwarranted
here, where there was no outrageous Government misconduct and where the defendant cannot
show that the Government’s behavior prejudiced her defense or legal representation. Similarly,
because there was no misconduct by the Government, there is no basis to suppress the evidence
obtained pursuant to the subpoena. The defendant’s motion—unsupported by the law and the
facts—must be denied.

Suppression

Court should decline the defendant’s invitation to exercise this sparingly used power.

implement a remedy for violation of recognized rights, to preserve judicial integrity by ensuring
that a conviction rests on appropriate considerations validly before a jury, and finally, as a remedy
