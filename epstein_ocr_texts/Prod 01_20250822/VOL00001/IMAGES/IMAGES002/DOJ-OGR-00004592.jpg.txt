contact PBPD Chiet Reiter about 1 notifying the victims, and on, 1 June 28, 2008, she. reported back,
to Sloman that Reiter: “is going to notify’ victims about the plea.4!* Villafafia recalled. that she
sent Reiter a list’ ofthe girls, identificd as victims during the federal. investigation, and Reiter said
he: would “contact as: many’ as he could.” The contemporancous records do not show how many
or'which victims, ifany, Reiter contacted, and:no victims’were present, inthe courtroom. No victim,
who provided information, to OPR, cither in. person or through her attorney, recalled receiving
notice of the plea hearing from federal o or state officials. At the time ¢ Epstein. pled eu in state
notified about the proceeding. Accordingly, Villafana, who-w was: present. in the courtroom for the:
hearing, had.no knowledge:to whom-Belohlavek-referred when she told. the court that the victims
were “in agreement'with the terms of this plea.”*'°

OPR. considered whether Acosta’s decision to. defer to the State Attorney’s Office the
decision.to notify victims ofthe scheduled date for Epstein’ siplea hearing x constituted: professional
misconduct. OPR. could not. conclude that the CVRA. or VRRA provisions in. question, requiring
notice of any public procecding ‘involving the crime.against.the’victim or that.the victim. is entitled.
to attend, unambiguously required fedcral. prosecutors to notify victims of state court proceedings.
Furthermore, as discussed previously,,OLC had, issued guidance. Stating that ‘the CVRA did not.
apply‘to. cases in which no. federal. charges had been. filed. 0 "Moreover, the Section. of the VRRA.
requiring, notice: of court proceedings thatthe victim. is “entitled to attend” referred. specifically to
procecdings under.42°U:S.C. § 10606(b)(4),. which, at the: time of the Epstein case, had become
part-of the CVRA (18 U:S:C. § 3771 (a)(2)).7"

federal investigation. of the state plea hearing, OPR concludes that his decision to defer to the State:
Attorney the decision, to notify: victims of the state’s:plea hearing and the responsibility for doing
‘so did not.constitute professional misconduet.*”*

SL Sloman.replied, “Good.” In-her-written-response to OPR, Villafafa. stated, “T requested permission.to'make

oral notifications to the’ victims regarding the-upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that'victin notification.
could only come ‘froni astate investigator, and Jeff:Sloman.asked PBPD Chicf Reiter to assist.”
