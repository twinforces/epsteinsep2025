motions, the suppression motions overlap in fact and argument, and accordingly, the Government
responds to both motions in this section.

As set forth herein, the defendant’s suppression motions challenging a judicially approved
grand jury subpoena should be denied without a hearing for multiple reasons. As an initial matter,
the defendant’s claim that the Government “circumvented” Martindell fails because the
Government issued a valid grand jury subpoena, sought judicial authorization to permit
compliance with the subpoena, and obtained materials from Boies Schiller that otherwise would
have been covered by the relevant protective order only after receiving such authorization. In any
event, even if the Government’s motion did not satisfy Martindell, Martindell provides no basis
to suppress evidence, and the defendant cites no authority in support of that request. Second, the
defendant’s claim that the subpoena was a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth
Amendment fails because she has not established standing to challenge a judicially approved grand
jury subpoena issued to a third party, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful. Even if she
had standing, her claim still fails because suppression would be improper under the good faith
exception and the inevitable discovery doctrine. Third, the defendant’s claim that the subpoena
violated her Fifth Amendment rights fails because, among other things, such a violation requires
coercion and state action. Fourth, the defendant’s claim that the Government violated the Due
Process Clause is meritless, as the Government’s conduct was not, by any reasonable definition,
outrageous or conscience shocking. And finally, the defendant’s request for a hearing should be
denied because she has proffered no admissible evidence to support her accusations of Government
misconduct; instead, she relies entirely on an anonymously sourced article that, as detailed herein,
she cites to describe certain events that simply did not occur.

Accordingly, the defendant’s suppression motions should be denied.
