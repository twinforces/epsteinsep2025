(N:D.N.Y: Feb. 6, 1989) (reaching the unremarkable result: that an, “undercover agent’s diary” is
“not. discoverable in and of itself” except “to the cxtent-that this diary contains” Brady material).
Alternatively, the defendant states that she needs to inspect the “entire journal” to
“establish, whether the journal, is authentic and complete and whether or not. spoilation ‘has
occurred.” (4/2/21 Letter from. Def, ‘Dkt. No. 244 at 9). “This examination,” she continues,
“requires. the:services of a. qualified forensic document examiner.” (/d.). This argument. lacks
merit. The defendant’s bare: assertion that. authenticity might somchow bein, doubt is hardly: a.
sufficiently detailed explanation. of relevance and admissibility’ to justify a subpocna fora minor
victim’s personal journal. The defendant docs not identify any’‘basis: for doubting the authenticity
of the. documents, which the ‘Government expects that. Minor Victim-2. will, be able to properly’
authenticate at. trial. Nor docs the defendant identify what kind of examiner she. intends: to usc,
what kind of examination will ‘occur, or how that examination ‘might, bear on the journal's
authenticity. See Wei, 252: F. Supp. 3d at 253 (explaining that.the “items sought cannot:mercly be
potentially relevant.or admissible. Rather, they must be: shown to be relevant. and. admissible at.
the time: the subpoena'is sought.” (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also United States v.
Skelos, No. 15-CR-31,7 (KMW), 2018 WL 2254538, at *2 (S.D.N-Y. May 17, 2018), aff'd, 988
F.3d 645 (2d Cir, 202.1) (“[A] criminal subpoena should not: be used as ‘a discovery device,’ but:

instead should be used only‘as,‘a‘mechanism for obtaining specific admissible evidence.’” (quoting

“Conclusory. statements,” like the defendant’s here, are “insufficient to satisfy the Nixon

requirements.” Barnes, 2008 WL 9359654, at:*3.°

“In addition to the explicit bases identified in her letter on the subpoena and. described, above,
elsewhere the, defendant has made: clear that.she secks the diary for impeachment purposes. (See"
