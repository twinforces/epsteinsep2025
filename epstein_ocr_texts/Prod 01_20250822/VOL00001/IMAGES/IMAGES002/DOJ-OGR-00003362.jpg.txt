2. The Evidence Does Not Establish That Acosta Negotiated a Deal
Favorable to Epstein over Breakfast: with Defense Counsel

OPR. separatély considered. the circumstances of one specific mecting, that has. bech. the
subject: of media. attention and Public criticism. The: Miami Her ald? November. 20. 18 reporting on.
defense counsel "Tay Lefkowitz arranged, to ‘have with Acosta at the West Palm ‘Beach Marriott
hotel. According to the. Miami Herald article, “a,deal'was struck” at-the meeting to allow Epstein
to serve “just 13 months’ in the county’ jail. in exchange for ‘the. shuttering of the federal
investigation, and. Acosta also agreed. to * ‘conceal” the full extent of Epstcin’s crimes from. the
victims and the public. 234 Although public criticism of the mecting, has focused.on the fact. that:
the mecting occurred ‘in,a-hotel far from Acosta’s Miami, office, the evidence shows that Acosta.
‘traveled. to West. Palm Beach on October 1.1 fora press event and stayed overnight. at the hotel,
near the USAO*s West Palm. Beach office; because at: midday on October 12: he was ‘to speak at.
the Palm. Beach. County Bench Bar Conference. After carefully considering the evidence
surrounding the break fast:meeting,-including contemporancous. email.communications and. witness
accounts, OPR concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or make any significant.
coneessions relating to it, during or as a result: of the October breakfast: meeting.

Epstein and his attorneys: signed. the NPA on September 24, 2007—more than two wecks
before the October 12 breakfast mecting. The signed. NPA contained. all of the key: provisions
resulting’ from. the preeeding wecks. of ‘negotiations between the partics, and despite’ a. later
addendum and ongoing disputes ‘about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those:
key ‘provisions ‘remained in place: thereafter. Acosta told OPR ‘that throughout ‘the negotiations
with the defense, he sought.thrcee goals: dy Epstcin’s. guilty ‘plea. in state. court to an. offense
requiring registration asa sexual. offender; (2)a sentence ‘of il imprisonment; and, 3)a mechanism,
USAO" 'S original plea offer i in 1 Menchell S August 3 2007 ‘letter: expressed, a’ ‘non- n-negotiable”
demand. that: Epstcin agree to a two-year term of 1 imprisonment, and the final. NPA: required only’
an, 18-month sentence, but the deeision:to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 to, 18
months was ‘made well before.Acosta’s breakfast. mecting with. ‘counscl. The NPA signed on.
September 24, 2007, required. 18 months’ incarceration, ‘sexual. offender registration, and. a.
mechanism for the victims to obtain monetary damages from’ ‘Epstein, and OPR found. that these
terms‘were not abandoned or materially. altcred after the breakfast mecting.

At the time of Acosta’s October breakfast :mecting with Lefkowitz, two issues: involving
the NPA were in. dispute. Neither.of those issues was ultimately: resolved in.a way’ that. materially
changced.the key'provisions of the NPA. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO'sought.to change
the mechanism for appointing’ an attorney’ representative for the victims. This, USAO-initiated
request. had ‘prompted. discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA. Sloman. sent. the text of a.
proposed:NPA.addendum to Lefkowitz.on October 1.1, 2007.°** Although:OPR found no decisive:
