No. 138 at 2 n.2. Again, however, the Defendant does not explain why Maria Farmer’s
engagement letter with BSF is relevant to support this proposition or is otherwise relevant to the
motion. The Defendant’s conclusory arguments that the engagement letters between BSF and the
Farmers are relevant to something other impeachment are unpersuasive and demonstrate that she
cannot clear Nixon’s relevance hurdle as to Requests 6 and 7.
Ill. Request 8: Grand Jury Subpoena to BSF

Request 8 fails for the same reason that Requests 1 and 2 fail. If the Defendant is entitled
to this information, then she must obtain it from the Government. And if she is not entitled to this
information, she cannot use Rule 17 to circumvent Rule 16’s limitations. See supra Part I.C.

IV. Request 9: Annie Farmer’s Journal®

As to the Defendant’s request for an original copy of Annie Farmer’s entire journal from
when she was a teenager, the Defendant contends that the journal is exculpatory because the
relevant passages do not mention the Defendant—but this is information that she already has, and
she does not explain why she needs the entire journal prior to trial if she already has the allegedly
exculpatory information in the journal. The Defendant already has copies of all of the relevant
pages of the journal. She does not explain why she needs to inspect the entire journal “to establish
whether the journal is authentic and complete and whether or not spoliation has occurred.” Resp.

the journal was inculpatory, and thus she sought to examine the authenticity of the pages containing
allegations against her, but she contends it is instead exculpatory. If the Defendant seriously
contends that the journal is relevant because it is exculpatory, and that it is exculpatory because
° BSF also points the Court to the objections that Ms. Farmer has herself posed in response
to the Defendant’s proposed Rule 17 subpoena to her, in which the Defendant requests the same
journal from Ms. Farmer.
