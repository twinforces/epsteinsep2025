Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document397 Filed 10/29/21 Page 65 of 84

As set forth in Counts Five and Six of the Indictment, Minor Victim-4 was trafficked by
the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein from approximately 2001 to 2004. (Indictment {[f[ 22-27).
During that time, Minor Victim-4 personally interacted with the defendant—for instance, the
defendant paid Minor Victim-4 following Minor Victim-4’s sexual encounters with Epstein. (/d.
25(a)).

In 2007, Minor Victim-4 was interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. In that
interview, she described meeting “an older lady with short black hair and an unknown accent”—a
description that is consistent with the defendant’s appearance—at her first meeting with Epstein.
In a. Minor Victim-4 was deposed, during which she explained that she sometimes called the
house to get work, and she would talk to an employee or “Maxwell.” Later in the deposition, she
added that the same employee or “Maxwell” would contact her when Epstein wanted her to come.

This Office first interviewed Minor Victim-4 in July 2020. During that meeting, Minor
Victim-4 spoke about her many interactions with the defendant. She did so again at the
Government’s meetings with her in August 2020, and at multiple meetings in January 2021.

The Government met Minor Victim-4 again in June 2021 for several meetings. During one
of those meetings, the Government showed Minor Victim-4 a photo book containing 20 photos.
The Government asked Minor Victim-4 to review each photograph in the book and to indicate
whether she recognized anyone in the book. The Government explained that just because someone
is in the book, it does not mean that Minor Victim-4 knowns that person or that the person is in
trouble. The Government instructed Minor Victim-4 just to let the Government know if she
recognized anyone.
