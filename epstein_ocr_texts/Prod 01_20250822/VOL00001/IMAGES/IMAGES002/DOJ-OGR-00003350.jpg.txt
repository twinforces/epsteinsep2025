Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 174 of 348

The USAO might: have been. able: to: surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy issues
presented, by a.federal ‘prosecution of Epstein. Villafana.,. in, particular, believed she could. have
prevailed had she taken. the case to trial, and even after the NPA ‘was negotiated, she repeatedly’
recommended declaring, Epstein. in, breach and. proceeding with. an. indictment, because she
coritinued. to have confidence: in. the case.*** Oosterbaan and others also believed. that the:
government’ would suceccd at trial. Furthermore, the’victims were not a uniform, group. Some of'
them ‘were aftaid. of testifying or having their identitics made public; others wanted Epstein
prosecuted, but even among those; itis not clear how many’ expressed a:willingness to testify ata,
trial; and still others provided, information. favorable to Epstein. In the end, Acosta assumed.
responsibility for deciding how to resolve the. Epstein investigation and weighing the risks and
benefits ofa. trial. versus those of a ‘pre- -charge disposition. ‘His:dctermination. that.a. pre-charge
disposition was appropriate ‘was not unreasonable under the: circumstances.

Although evidentiary. and witness issucs explain. the subject supervisors’ concerns about.
winning a potential trial and why the USAO would have sought some: sort of. pre-charge:
disposition, they do:not fully explain. why Acosta decided. to pursue a state based resolution as
opposed.to a traditional federal plea,agreement. OPR. did not.find in the contemporancous:records
‘a:memorandum, or other memorialization. of the reasoning underlying Acosta’s. decision to offer a.
state-based :resolution or the terms offered to the defense on July 31, 2007.

According to.Acosta, “In 2006,:it would have been extremely unusual for any United States
Attorney’ s Office to become involved in a state solicitationcase, even one involving undcrage
teens,” because solicitation was “the, provinee of state: prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR. that he:
developed. * ‘a | preference for deferring. to the state” to “make it clear that [the USAO was] not
the sake of the larger human trafficking issuc.” > Acosta also told OPR that. it was his. dinderstanding
that the PBPD would..not ‘have brought. the case to federal, investigators if the State Attorney’s
Office had pursued a sanction against Epstein that included. jail time: ‘and sexual offender:
registration. Acosta’vicwed the) USAO’s role ‘in the case as limited to ‘preventing the “manifest:
injustice” ‘that, 'in Acosta’s view, would have resulted from. the state’s original plea proposal.
Acosta acknowledged.that if the investigation had. begun inthe federal. system, he would not have
viewed the terms: sct out in, the NPA. as a. satisfactory: result, but it was adequate to jserve as a.
“backstop” to the state’s prosceution, which he described as “a polite way of saying[,
‘Jencouraging the state to do’a, little bit:more:[”]” In sum, Acosta, told OPR that the Epstcin case:
layin. “uncharted territory,” there was no certainty that the USAO would prevail if it went to trial,
and a potentially“unfavorable outeomic had to be,“weighed against a certain, plea’with registration,
that would :make:sure that the:public knew that this person.was.a scx offender.”

Acosta, told OPR that he discussed the case primarily with Sloman, and Menchel, ‘and both.
told:OPR that whilé they did ‘not share Acosta’s ‘federalism concémis, they recalled that Acosta had.

‘the terms offeredto, the defense on: July 31,2007. Therefore; any-allegations,against the-prosecutors could not haye
playedia significant; role in -Acosta’s decisions: as reflected:in the-term,sheet:

2 Sloman told OPR that Villafafia “always believed inthe case.”
