1 mouth, and I just think, for some reason, I was going to be

2 brought back to the SHU again.

i) I've been incarcerated since August 2019, and I never

5 over 75 days. MCC and MDC are the most degrading and

7 memories forever, but these memories are my motivation to stay

10 apologize to you, and I want to take full responsibility for my
11 actions. I am guilty. I am guilty for the crimes committed,
12 but through this experience, I've matured. I recognize my
13 values, and I promise to live my life with integrity.

14 I'm asking you to please give me a chance to do
15 something with my life. In life, you come across so many
16 challenges, but the truth will always persevere. Everything I
17 suffered, everything I shared in this horrific place will be a
18 reminder and strength to me to do the right thing. My
19 incarceration has been very painful.
20 I have suffered tremendously, and I'm still suffering.
21 Your Honor, I have not been outside since February 2020. I
22 don't see the sun. I don't feel the rain. I don't feel the
23 snow. We are locked in here all day. That is one of the
24 rights that we are supposed to have, to even be able to go out
25 for rec, but I have not been outside since February 2020. I
