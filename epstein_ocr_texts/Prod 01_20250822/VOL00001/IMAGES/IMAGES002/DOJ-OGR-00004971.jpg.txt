A legal battle is also brewing over a 2016 meeting — first revealed by the Daily News —
between Manhattan federal prosecutors and attorneys for Epstein accusers. Sources
told the Daily News that the victims’ lawyers urged the office to open an investigation
of Epstein and Maxwell. But the request went nowhere.

Maxwell now cites that meeting as evidence that prosecutors and victims’ lawyers were
improperly in cahoots. Manhattan federal prosecutors say they opened an investigation
of Epstein and Maxwell in response to investigative reporting by the Miami Herald in
late 2018. Sources familiar with the meetings said victims’ lawyers were frustrated by
prosecutors’ failure to take action following the outreach — rebutting Maxwell’s claims
of collusion.
