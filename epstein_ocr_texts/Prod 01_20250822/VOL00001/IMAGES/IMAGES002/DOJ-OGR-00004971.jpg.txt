Williams/for New York Daily News)

Maxwell now cites that meeting as evidence that prosecutors and victims’ lawyers were
improperly in cahoots..Manhattan federal, prosecutors say they opened an investigation
of Epstein and Maxwell in response to investigative reporting by the Miami Herald in

of collusion.
