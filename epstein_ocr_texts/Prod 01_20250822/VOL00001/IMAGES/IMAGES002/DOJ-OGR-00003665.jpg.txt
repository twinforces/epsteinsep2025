the expanded statute of limitations for child sex, abuse crimes. See Opp. Mem. 24 (quoting
‘Crime:Control Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101=647, tit. II, § 225(a), 104 Stat. 4789, 4798. (codified
at 18. U.S.C. § 3509(k) (1.990)). In 1990, “the only existing limitations period to-which:the
language could ‘have referred was.the [five-year] default limit-set forth in [18 U.S.C. § 3282].”
Mille¥, 911 F.3d.at 644. That is:the logical reading of the saiiie provision heré.

The government: cannot prevail. on.step one. If step one is not resolved in Ms. .Maxwell’s:

Even if the Landgraf inquiry’were to proceed. to the second 'step—whether retroactive:

United States > Scharton, 285 U.S. 518,522 (1932)). But nothing in Landgraf, a,civil case;
purports.to limit-that principle, lét.alone abrogate it:

The government asserts that no. court has held that retroactively extending a filing period.
‘for live charges is.a’presumptively impermissible retroactive effect under, Landgraf (Opp. 35),
but that is not so. In United States. ¥. Gentilé, 235 F. Supp. 3d 649 (D.N.J..20.17), the-court held
that it would-be impermissible to retroactively:extend.a statute of limitations for live charges
“absent, clear legislative intent” to apply the expanded limitations retroactively. Jd. at:655. In
doing so, ‘the court read. Landgraf in conjunction not.only with Zoussie but also with.Aughes
