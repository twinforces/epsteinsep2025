v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 463 (1996) (“[S]lo long as the prosecutor has probable cause to
believe that the accused committed an offense defined by statute, the decision whether or not to
prosecute . . . generally rests entirely in [the prosecutor’s] discretion.” (internal quotation marks
omitted)). Defendants are permitted to challenge the motives for a prosecution by seeking
dismissal of an indictment due to vindictive or selective prosecution. See, e.g., United States v.
Avenatti, 433 F. Supp. 3d 552, 558, 562-64, 576 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2020) (denying vindictive
and selective prosecution claims). Such challenges, however, are issues “for the court rather
than for the jury.” United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d 127, 167 (2d Cir. 2011) (quoting Regan,
103 F.3d at 1082); see Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(3)(A)(iv) (listing, among pretrial motions, “a
defect in instituting the prosecution, including . . . selective or vindictive prosecution’’).
Accordingly, courts have sustained objections or precluded defendants from arguing to the jury
about the Government’s motives. See Farhane, 634 F.3d. at 166-67 (affirming a sustained
objection to a defense closing argument that “the government had targeted him for prosecution
based on his religion”); United States v. Duncan, No. 18 Cr. 289 (SHS), 2019 WL 2210663, at
*3 (S.D.N.Y. May 22, 2019) (“[T]o the extent Locust seeks to highlight the fact that he was not a
target of the investigation to suggest that the government’s true targets were the doctors and
lawyers allegedly involved in the conspiracy and to draw attention to their absence from this
case, the Court has already ruled that such argument is improper.”).

The defense is free to argue that the defendant is not guilty. However, offering evidence
or argument to claim the Government is prosecuting the defendant because Epstein is dead, as a
scapegoat for Epstein, or for any other improper motive, is impermissible—and untrue. The
