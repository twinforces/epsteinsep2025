vs Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 463 (1996) (“[S]o long ‘as the prosceutor has probable cause fo
belicve that the accused committed an. offense. defined, by statute, the decision ‘whether or not, to
prosecute:. . . generally rests entirely in [the prosecutor’s] ‘diserction.” (internal. quotation marks
omitted)). Defendants: ‘are permitted to challenge ‘the motives for a prosecution by seeking
dismissal of an indictment duc to vindictive or selective prosecution. See, e.g., United States ¥.
Avenatti, 433 F., Supp. 3d 552, 558, 562-64, 576 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15, 2020) (denying vindictive

objection ‘to a defense closing argument that “the government had targeted him. ‘for prosecution,
based on his religion”); United States vy. Duncan, No. 18 ‘Cr. 289 (SHS), 2019 WL 2210663, at
*3:(S.D.N.Y.May 22, 2019) (“[T]Jo. the extent Locust seeks to highlight the fact; that; he was not a.
target of the investigation to suggest that the government’s true: targets were the doctors and
lawyers allegedly involved in the conspiracy and to draw’ attention to their absence from this
casc, the Court has already ruled that such argument. is improper.”).

The defense is free to argue that the: defendant is not guilty. However, offering evidence:
or argument. to claim the Government is prosecuting the defendant. because Epstein. is dead, ‘asa,
