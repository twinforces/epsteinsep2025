interactions with the defendant and Epstein at Epstein’s various properties. See, e.g., Indictment
§{ 7(a) (“MAXWELL subsequently interacted with Minor Victim-1 on multiple occasions at
Epstein’s residences.”). Accordingly, a rational juror, after hearing the evidence, could find that
the question called for the names of minors that the defendant interacted with at any of Jeffrey
Epstein’s properties, that the defendant answered that she was aware of no such minors other than
Giuffre, and therefore that her answer was false. And even if the defendant identifies some
plausible ambiguity—and she has not—the terms in this question are ones “with a meaning about
which [people] of ordinary intellect could agree,” and therefore are not fundamentally ambiguous.

The defendant points out that, in response to an earlier question asking her to list the
underage girls she “met and brought” to Epstein’s house, she said that she could not do so. (Def.
Mot. 4 at 12-13). She argues that the charged question was “improper” because it asked her to
generate a list “from events that had happened nearly two decades previously.” (/d.). Her
unpersuasive after-the-fact efforts to justify her answer provide no basis to keep this question from
the jury. As noted above, the transcript makes clear (and a jury could find) that when the defendant
did not understand or could not answer a question, she said so. To the extent the defendant is
arguing that her answer was literally true, a reasonable jury could find otherwise. In this respect,
the Government notes, among other things, that in response to the earlier question, the defendant
said that she could not make a list not because she could not remember events from that long ago
but “because that list -- it never happened that I can think of.” (Ex. 10 at 382:4-13) (emphasis
added). And in response to the charged question, the defendant said that she “was not aware of
anybody” under 18—that is, the list would be empty. See Forde, 740 F. Supp. 2d at 413 (“Olivieri,
if truly confused, could also have asked for clarification. Instead he replied with a strong
