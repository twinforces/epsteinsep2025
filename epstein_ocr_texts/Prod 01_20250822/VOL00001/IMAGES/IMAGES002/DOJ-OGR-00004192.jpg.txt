Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 285-4 Filed 05/20/21 Page3of3
Epstein when she was 16 years old. Epstein apparently had dozens of victims, and it’s
not clear if/when his criminal conduct stopped. The facts are complicated, there are
several related civil cases, and Epstein entered into a non-pros with the SDFL USAO in
2007 that is limited but obviously something to take into account.
All that said, there are aspects of the facts here that are intriguing and I'd like to talk it
over with you. I’m free next week Tuesday afternoon and all day Wednesday. Do you
have time to meet then?
Thanks,
