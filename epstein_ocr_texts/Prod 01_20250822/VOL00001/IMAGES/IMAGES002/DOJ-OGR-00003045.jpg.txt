ii. Discussion

Maxwell cannot assert a Fourth Amendment claim because she had no legitimate
expectation of privacy in the deposition transcripts or other materials she designated as confidential
under the protective order. The materials were held by a third party law firm that represented her
adversary in the civil suit. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743-44 (“a person has no legitimate expectation
of privacy in information he voluntarily turns over to third parties”); Miller, 425 U.S. at 443 (no
legitimate expectation of privacy in materials held by a third party “even if the information is
revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose”); Carpenter, 138 S. Ct.
at 2220 (“We do not disturb the application of Smith and Miller ...”). Maxwell cites no authority
for the proposition that she has standing to challenge a judicially approved grand jury subpoena
directed at a third party law firm, because there is none.

Maxwell points to the fact that the materials were designated as confidential under the
protective order, but that reliance is misplaced. (Def. Mot. 11 at 6-8). Martindell by its own terms
contemplates the modification of a protective order in a civil action. See, e.g., Andover Data
Servs., 876 F.2d at 1083 (“It is well-settled here and elsewhere . . . that a Rule 26(c) protective
order may be overturned or modified based on a finding of improvidence, extraordinary
circumstances or compelling need.”). And with respect to the specific protective order at issue,
Chief Judge McMahon found that because the order “plainly gives the court the power to enter an
order compelling disclosure to anyone—law enforcement included—Maxwell could not
reasonably have relied on the absence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield
anything she said or produced from a grand jury’s scrutiny.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 18-19); see
also Def. Mot. 3, Ex. A at § 5 (“CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION|] shall not, without the
consent of the party producing it or further Order of the Court, be disclosed[.]”) (internal quotation
