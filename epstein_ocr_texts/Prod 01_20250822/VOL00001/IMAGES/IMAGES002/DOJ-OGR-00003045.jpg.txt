ii. Discussion.

Maxwell. cannot assert a Fourth Amendment claim because she had no, legitimate
expectation-of privacy inthe:deposition transcripts or other materials she designated as confidential
‘under the protective order. The materials were held’by a third party’ law firm: that;represented her
adversary in.the civil suit. See Smith, 442 U.S. at 743-44 (“a person has no legitimate éxpectation.
‘of privacy: in information, he voluntarily’turns: over to third parties”); Miller, 425 U.S. at.443 (no
legitimate expectation of privacy in. matcrials held by. a third party “cven if the information is
revealed on the assumption that it will be used:only: for a limited. purpose”); Carpenter, 138 S. Ct.
at 2220 (“We do not disturb the application. of Smith and,Miller . ..”). Maxwell cites no authority
for the: proposition that she: has. standing to challenge a judicially approved grand jury subpoena
directed at a third. party law firm, because there is none.

Maxwell. points to the fact that the matcrials were designated as confidential under the
protective order, but that relianee is:misplaced. (Def. Mot. 1:1.at.6-8). Martindéll by its own terms
‘contemplates: the modification ofa protective order in,a civil action. See, e.g., Andover Data
Servs.5 876 F.2d at. 1083: (“Itis ‘well-settled here and. elsewhere... . that.a Rule 26(c) protective
order may be overturned. or ‘modified. based on a finding of. improvidencc, extraordinary:
circumstanees or compelling need.”). And. with respect to the specific protective order at. issue,
Chief Judge McMahon found.that because'the order “plainly gives the court.the:power'to enter an
order compelling disclosure to anyonc—law .enforcement included—Maxwell. could not.
reasonably have ‘relicd, on the absenee of automatic. permission, for such disclosure ‘to shield,
anything she. said or produced from a. grand, jury’s scrutiny.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. Gat..18-19); see

consent. of the party producing itor fiirther Order of the-Court; be disclosed[.]”) (internal quotation
