that the office had. “completed a: thorough. review” of the USAO’s. handling of the: Epstein, matter
and. did ‘not believe intervention. by the Deputy..Attorney’ General was ‘warranted in view’ of the
“considerable diséréetion” vested by the..Depattment in. U.S. Attorneys. He, added, “Even if’ we
‘were to substitute our judgment for that.of the: U.S..Attorncy; we belicve:that federal. prosecution.
‘of this case is appropriate.”

Xs JUNE. 2008 — JUNE 2009: EPSTEIN ENTERS HIS PLEAS AND SERVES HIS

On Friday, June: 27, 2008, 'Villafafia renewed her requests to Epstein’s local attorneys
Goldberger and Black for a copy: of the state plea, agreement; reached with, the State Attorncy’s
Office, noting that, their failure to ‘provide it was a material breach of the NPA. After recciving
and reviewing the:plea agreement form, which was. not 'yetsigned, Villafafia sent another letter to
Goldberger. and.Black, informing themthat'the proposed: sentencing provision:did:not comply with.
the requirements of the:NPA. Specifically, as written, the plea-agreement called. for a sentence of
12 months in “the Palm Beach County Detention Facility,” followed. consecutively by “1:8 months
‘Community::!Control” ‘with ‘a, special condition that the defendant. serve “the first. }6 months [of
community. control] in. the Palm Beach County Detention Eacility:’ Villafafia objected to the
community : ‘control. provision, reminding Goldberger.and Black that the NPA required. Epstcin to

“make a binding recommendation of cightcen, months imprisonment, which means confinement
twenty-four hours a-day at the County. Jail.” In a subsequent email to Sloman, Villafafia:recounted.
that she had, spoken, about the issue with, Goldberger, who “swore? that.Epstcin. would. be in,
custody 24-hours-a-day during the community confinement. portion of his sentence.” Villafania.
added:that' Goldberger “let it slip:that/Epstcin. would not. be. at the jail, he would.be at the stockade

. Since we specifically ‘discussed this at the: meeting with [the State Attorney] months ago that
Epstein, would ‘be at [the jail], this certainly violates the spirit: of the [NPA] agrecment.”!”
Villafafia told Sloman, “[S]omething smells. very bad.”

a The! Main Detention Center for’Palm/Beach County is.a facility housing maximum, medium, and‘minimum,
custody adult males, as well ‘as juvenile! and special. population. ‘male ‘and female inmates. See
