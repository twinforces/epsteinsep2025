Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 364 _ Filed 10/22/21 Page2of3
o Lists for questionnaires completed on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court
via email by November 7.
o Lists for questionnaires completed on November 12 will be due to the Court via
email by November 13.
o If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November 15 at 9:30 a.m.
to resolve any disputes.

e Voir dire will proceed on November 16-19. The Court will conduct one-on-one voir dire
with each prospective juror in the presence of the parties and with public access to the
proceeding. At the conference, both sides indicated the potential need for additional
procedures during voir dire under certain circumstances. See Transcript at 10-11. As
the Court indicated, it will consider proposed narrowly tailored measures that may be
necessary during voir dire on a case-by-case basis. See id. at 12.

e The Court will decide in due course whether the exercise of peremptory strikes will
proceed on November 19 or November 29.

The Court implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this case has
gamered, the nature of the charges, and the District’s COVID-19 protocols. These procedures are
carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties and prospective jurors in light
of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor, impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the
First Amendment right to public access of criminal proceedings.

Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday’s conference, the request to seal the
parties’ proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the Court’s draft questionnaire and voir dire
until after jury selection is completed is denied. Although the Court has and will continue to
implement tailored measures to ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos.
