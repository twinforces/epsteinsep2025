Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 382 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page 35 of 69

Finally, admissibility of the:number and type of prior consistent statements still is guided.
by Rules 401 and 403, including whether'the prior consistent statements are reliable; cumulative,
or. unfairly prejudicial; the Court may choose to exclude prior consistent statements when the
quantity ‘and type of prior consistent statements form, the bulk, of the government's case rather.
than‘the. trial testimony of the witnesses. ome ¥. United States,'513 U.S. 150, 165.(1995) (“If
every implicit: charge; that.a witness’ in-court testimony. results from. recent: fabrication or
improper influence or motive, the whole emphasis of thetrial could shift to: the out-of-court
‘statements, not the in-court.oncs."); Wright & Miller, supra, § 6754 ("The danger of substantive
‘usé of the prior statement remains on the'unfair prejudice side of the Iedger."). "One thing the
courts all agree on. is that there:is ‘no rule admitting w// prior consistent:statements:simply to
bolster the credibility of'a witness." Jd. (emphasis. supplicd).

As 'to introduction of these prior consistent statements through other witnesses, the
Sccond Circuit is clear'that."where the declarant.has already testified and-the prior consistent
statement: is ‘proffered through the testimony of anothcr witness, the Rulc's, ‘subject to cross-
examination" requirement is satisfied if the opposing’ party: is. not.denied the opportunity to recall
the declarant to the stand for cross-cxamination, concerning the statement." United States v.
Caraéappa, 614 F.3d 30, 39 (2d Cir. 2010). Thus, if the government clicits. prior consistent
statements from third-party witnesses, then.they will be: obliged to make the:declarant-Accuser
available for recall to be subjected.to cross examination concerning those, statements.

In.sum, the Court's rulings regarding admissibility of prior consistent statements can only
‘come at thetime the government proffers them, explains the purpose for-which,they are offered.

(whether under subpart: (1) or (it) of Rule .801(d)(1)(B)) and clears the other evidentiary. hurdles
