upcoming performance in Miami, Florida. Constand called the representative back and
recorded the call. The representative asked for certain details about Constand and her
mother so that he could book flights and hotel rooms for them. Constand declined the

located. The case was assigned to Sergeant Richard Schaeffer, who worked in tandem
