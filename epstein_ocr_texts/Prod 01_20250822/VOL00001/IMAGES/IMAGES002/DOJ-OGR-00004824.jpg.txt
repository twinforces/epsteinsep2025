defects in the case, that the case could not be won and that | was going to

make a public statement that we were not going to charge Mr. Cosby.

| told him that | was making it as the sovereign Commonwealth of

Pennsylvania and, in my legal opinion, that meant that Mr. Cosby would not

be allowed to take the Fifth Amendment in the subsequent civil suit that

Andrea Constand’s lawyers had told us they wanted to bring.

[Attorney] Phillips agreed with me that that is, in fact, the law of

Pennsylvania and of the United States and agreed that if Cosby was

subpoenaed, he would be required to testify.

But those two things were not connected one to the other. Mr. Cosby was

not getting prosecuted at all ever as far as | was concerned. And my belief

was that, as the Commonwealth and the representative of the sovereign,

that | had the power to make such a statement and that, by doing so, as a

matter of law Mr. Cosby would be unable to assert the Fifth Amendment in

a civil deposition.

[Attorney] Phillips, a lawyer of vastly more experience even than me—and

| had 20 years on the job by that point—agreed with my legal assessment.

And he said that he would communicate that to the lawyers who were

representing Mr. Cosby in the pending civil suit.

Id. at 64-66. Recalling his thought process at the time, the former district attorney further
emphasized that it was “absolutely” his intent to remove “for all time” the possibility of
prosecution, because “the ability to take the Fifth Amendment is also for all time removed.”
Id. at 67.

Consistent with his discussion with Attorney Phillips, D.A. Castor issued another
press release, this time informing the public that he had decided not to prosecute Cosby.
The press release stated, in full:

Montgomery County District Attorney Bruce L. Castor, Jr. has announced

that a joint investigation by his office and the Cheltenham Township Police

Department into allegations against actor and comic Bill Cosby is

concluded. Cosby maintains a residence in Cheltenham Township,

Montgomery County.

A 31 year old female, a former employee of the Athletic Department of

Temple University complained to detectives that Cosby touched her

inappropriately during a visit to his home in January of 2004. The woman

reported the allegation to police in her native Canada on January 13, 2005.
