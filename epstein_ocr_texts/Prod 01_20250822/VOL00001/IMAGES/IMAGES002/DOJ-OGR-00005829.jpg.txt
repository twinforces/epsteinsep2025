No. S1 06 Cr. 34 (JFK), 2007 WL 1288597, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. May 1, 2007) (citing United States v.
Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. 1992)); United States v. Van Putten, No. 04 Cr. 803 (PKL),

crimes for which the defendant is on trial; and (3) has probative value which is not substantially
outweighed by any unfair prejudicial effect. See Zackson, 12 F.3d at 1182. If requested, such
evidence must be admitted with limiting instructions to the jury. See United States v. Edwards,
342 F.3d 168, 176 (2d Cir. 2003). The Second Circuit “ha[s] adopted an inclusionary approach to

other than to attempt to demonstrate the defendant’s criminal propensity.” /d. (internal quotation
