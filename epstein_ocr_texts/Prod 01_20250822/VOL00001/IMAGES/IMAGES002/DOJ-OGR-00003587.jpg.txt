1 G Maxwell - Confidential
2 lots of different types of people. In terms
3 of whatever -- very small part of my job,
4 Jeffrey enjoyed getting massages. I think
5 that 1s something we can all agree in this
6 room and within the context of that, very
7 infrequently I would go to spas and myself
8 happily receive a professional nonsexual
go massage from a man and/or from a woman and if
10 that massage was something that I thought was
11 something that was good, I would ask if that
12 man or woman would come back and does home
Lae visits. If that person said that they did,
14 they would sometimes come, from time to time,
15 not always, come back to the house to perform
16 a nonsexual professional male or female
17 massage.
18 QO. Were any of the exercise
19 instructors you hired under the age of 18?
Pele) A. Again, I don't hire, we've already
21 established that I don't hire people. I
22 interview people to see if they are competent
23 in the job that they do and/or whether they
24 are someone who seemed that they can do home
25 visits.
