Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 160 of 239
The defendant, therefore, argues that the questioner asked whether a logically impossible
event occurred or will occur at some point over the course of a millennium. But the defendant’s
professed confusion—which again was not raised during the deposition itself—ignores the plain
and obvious context of the question, which did not refer to a time period far exceeding the human
life span, and was not limited to only the times in which the defendant was in the act of having sex
with Epstein. Plainly, a jury could find that the defendant correctly understood the question when
she answered it in July 2016, and that she ascribed a natural meaning to the words used in the
questions, and not the tortured illogical meaning she now assigns to those questions: whether,
during the course of her relationship with Epstein, she was aware of anyone other than herself
having sexual relations with Epstein. The Government expects its evidence to show that she was.
See, e.g., Indictment § 1 (stating that the defendant “assisted, facilitated, and contributed to”
Epstein’s sexual abuse of minors). At a minimum, the defendant’s answers were not “literally true
under any conceivable interpretation of the questions.” Lighte, 782 F.2d at 374. And the
defendant’s professed confusion now and proposed illogical reading of the questions in the instant
motion does not render them fundamentally ambiguous. See Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d at 1221 (“A
defense to a charge of perjury may not be established by isolating a statement from context, giving
it in this manner a meaning entirely different from that which it has when the testimony is
considered as a whole.”). Accordingly, a jury should be permitted to determine what meaning the
defendant ascribed to those questions and whether her answers were in fact false.
Finally, the defendant answered the following questions:

Q. Did you ever give a massage to anyone other than Mr. Epstein at

any of Mr. Epstein's properties?

A. First of all, I never said I gave Mr. Epstein a massage.
