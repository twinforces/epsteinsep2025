Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document204 Filed 04/16/21 Page 160 of 239

The defendant, therefore, argues that the’ questioner asked. whether a logically impossible
event occurred or will occur at some point over the coursé of a millennium. But the deferdant’s
professed. confusion—which. again was not raised during the deposition itself—ignores. the plain.
and obvious context of the question, which did not refer'to a time period:far cxeceding the human,
life span,:and Was not'limited'to only’the times in-‘which the defendant'was. in the act of having sex
she answered. it. in. July 201.6, and that; she ascribed a ‘natural meaning to, the words used. in. the
questions, and not the ‘tortured ‘illogical meaning she now assigns to those questions: whether,
during the course of her ‘relationship with, Epstein, she was. aware of anyone other than herself
having sexual relations with Epstcin. The Government ¢xpects its evidence to show that she'was.
See, e.g., Indictment 4/1 (stating that. the: defendant “assisted, facilitated, and ‘contributed to”
Epstein’s sexual abuse of'minors).. At a minimum, the defendant’s.answers were:not “literally true
under. any ‘conccivable. interpretation. of' the questions.” Lighté, 782, F.2d at. 374. .And the
motion, does ‘not ‘render them, fundamentally ambiguous. See Bonacorsa, 528 F.2d at. 1221 (“A.
defenseto a charge of perjury may:not be established by isolating a statement from context, giving
it ‘in, this manner .a, meaning entirely different from that which ‘it. has when, the testimony’ is
considered as a'whole.”). Accordingly, a:jury should be permitted to determine’ what:meaning the
defendant.ascribed. to those questions and. whcther-her answers'were:in fact: false.

Finally, the defendant ‘answered the following questions:

Q. Did you ever give a massage'to anyone other than Mr. Epstcin at
any of Mr. Epstcin's: propertics?

A, First ofvall, 1 never said I gave Mr. Epstein ‘a. massage.
