A. Can you repeat the question?

MR. PAGLIUCA: Same objection.

A. No.

Q. Other than yourself and the blond and brunette that you have
identified as having been involved in three-way. sexual activities,

with whom ‘did Mr. Epstein have sexual activities?

Po

A. I wasn't aware that he was having sexual activities with anyone
when I was ‘with him other than myself.

Q. I want to be sure that I’m clear. Is it your testimony that in. the
1990s and:2000s, you were not aware that Mr. Epstein was having
sexual activities with anyone other than yourselfiand the blond and
brunette on those few occasions when they were involved with you?
A. That is my testimony, that is correct.

The defendant primarily argues that her-answers were literally true. In the defendant’s.
telling,. the phrase “[w]hen I was with him,” refers not to the duration of the defendant’s:
relationship with Epstein, but instead to only those moments when she was in the act of having sex:
with Epstein and either the blond or brunetté identified. above. (Def. Mot.4at16).[ |
Lo And in any event,
she further argues, because’ the question asked the defendant about the 1990s and 2000s, it

therefore covered any “‘sexual activities” spanning more:than a millennium.” (Jd. at 16-17).
