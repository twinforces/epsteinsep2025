(“A general assertion that certain material ‘might contain exculpatory information’ is insufficient
to prevail against a motion to quash under Rule 17(c).”). BSF has no duty to cull through broad
sets of documents to determine whether any Brady materials might exist and whether those
materials would be relevant and admissible when the Defendant has failed to meet her burden of
satisfying Nixon’s requirements.

Similarly, the Defendant, likely realizing that she has no viable argument as to the
relevance of all of the EVC Material, argues that even if the EVCP Material was relevant only to
impeachment, impeachment evidence is discoverable in advance of trial. Resp. Ltr. at 13. This is
a mischaracterization of the law. Each of the cases the Defendant cites relates to the Government's
obligations under Brady and Giglio. See Poventud v. City of New York, No. 07 CIV. 3998 DAB,
2015 WL 1062186, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 9, 2015) (civil § 1983 case in which criminal defendant
contended that government violated Brady obligations); United States v. Petrillo, 821 F.2d 85, 90
(2d Cir. 1987) (affirming denial of a motion for a new trial based on government’s failure to
produce Brady and Jencks Act materials); Grant v. Alldredge, 498 F.2d 376, 383 (2d Cir. 1974)
(vacating judgment of conviction based on Brady violation by government); U.S. ex rel. Meers v.
Wilkins, 326 F.2d 135, 136 (2d Cir. 1964) (affirming grant of habeas corpus petition based on
Brady violation by government). Not one of the cases that the Defendant cites concerns a Rule 17
subpoena to a nonparty because it is well-settled law that a criminal defendant may not use a Rule
17 subpoena to obtain potential impeachment evidence from a nonparty. Pena, 2016 WL 8735699,
at *2 (Nathan, J.) (“Rule 17(c) subpoenas may not issue prior to trial to obtain materials usable
only to impeach.”).

For all of the foregoing reasons, the Defendant’s motion to authorize service of the
Subpoena on BSF should be denied.
