(“A general assertion that certain material ‘might contain exculpatory. information’ is insufficient:
to prevail against .a motion to. quash ‘under Rule. 17(c).”). BSF has no duty’ to cull through. broad.
scts of documents to determine whether any Brady materials might cxist and. whether those
materials would be relevant.and admissible when the Defendant has failed to meet. her burden. of
satisfying Nixon's requirements.

Similarly, the ‘Defendant, likely ‘realizing that she has no viable argument. as to. the
relevance of all of the EVC. Material, argues that even if the EVCP Material was relevant only to
impeachment, impeachment evidence is discoverable:in advance ofttrial. Resp. Ltr. at.13. ‘This. is:
‘a-mischaractcrization of the law. Each of the-cases the Defendant cites relates to the Government's
obligations under Brady and Giglio. See Poventid v. City of New York, No. 07 CIV. 3998 DAB,
contended ‘that.government violated Brady obligations); United Stutes'v. Petrillo, 821,.F.2d,85, 90
(2d Cir: 1.987) (affirming denial. of a. motion ‘for a new trial. bascd on government’s ‘failure to
produce Brady. and Jencks Act. materials); Grant v. Alldredge, 498 F.2d. 376, 383 (2d. Cir. 1974)
(vacating judgment of conviction based. on Brady violation by government); US: ex rel, Meers v.
Wilkins, 326 F.2d 135, 136:(2d Cir. 1964) (affirming grant of habeas corpus petition. based on
Brady-.violation by government). Not one of the cases that the Defendant cites concerns ‘a.Rule 17
Subpocnia to a nonparty because it is: well-scttled law that. a criminal defendant.may:not use a Rule
17 subpocna to. obtain potential impceachment:evidenee from.a-nonparty. Pena, 2016 WL8735699,
at *2 (Nathan, J.) (“Rule 1’7(c) subpoenas ‘may not, issuc ‘prior to trial ‘to obtain, materials usable
only to impeach.”).

For all of the foregoing reasons, the ‘Defendant’s motion to authorize service of the

Subpocna.on BSF should be denied.
