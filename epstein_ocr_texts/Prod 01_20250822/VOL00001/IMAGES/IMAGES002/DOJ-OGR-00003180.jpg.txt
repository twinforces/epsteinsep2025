Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 4 of 348
NPA required Epstein to plead guilty in state court to the then-pending state indictment against
him and to an additional criminal information charging him with a state offense that would require
him to register as a sexual offender—specifically, procurement of minors to engage in prostitution,
in violation of Florida Statute § 796.03. The NPA required Epstein to make a binding
recommendation that the state court sentence him to serve 18 months in the county jail followed
by 12 months of community control (home detention or “house arrest”). The NPA also included
provisions designed to facilitate the victims’ recovery of monetary damages from Epstein. In
exchange, the USAO agreed to end its investigation of Epstein and to forgo federal prosecution in
the Southern District of Florida of him, four named co-conspirators, and “any potential
co-conspirators.” Victims were not informed of, or consulted about, a potential state resolution or
the NPA prior to its signing.

The signing of the NPA did not immediately lead to Epstein’s guilty plea and incarceration,
however. For the next nine months, Epstein deployed his extensive team of prominent attorneys
to try to change the terms that his team had negotiated and he had approved, while simultaneously
seeking to invalidate the entire NPA by persuading senior Department officials that there was no
federal interest at issue and the matter should be left to the discretion of state law enforcement
officials. Through repeated communications with the USAO and senior Department officials,
defense counsel fought the government’s interpretation of the NPA’s terms. They also sought and
obtained review by the Department’s Criminal Division and then the Office of the Deputy Attorney
General, primarily on the issue of federal jurisdiction over what the defense insisted was “a
quintessentially state matter.” After reviewing submissions by the defense and the USAO, on
June 23, 2008, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General informed defense counsel that the
Deputy Attorney General would not intervene in the matter. Only then did Epstein agree to fulfill
his obligation under the NPA, and on June 30, 2008, he appeared in state court and pled guilty to
the pending state indictment charging felony solicitation of prostitution and, pursuant to the NPA,
to a criminal information charging him with procurement of minors to engage in prostitution.
Upon the joint request of the defendant and the state prosecutor, and consistent with the NPA, the
court immediately sentenced Epstein to consecutive terms of 12 months’ incarceration on the
solicitation charge and 6 months’ incarceration on the procurement charge, followed by 12 months
of community control. Epstein began serving the sentence that day, in a minimum-security Palm
Beach County facility. A copy of the NPA was filed under seal with the state court.

On July 7, 2008, a victim, identified as “Jane Doe,” filed in federal court in the Southern
District of Florida an emergency petition alleging that the government violated the Crime Victims’
Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, when it resolved the federal investigation of Epstein
without consulting with victims, and secking enforcement of her CVRA rights.” In responding to
the petition, the government, represented by the USAO, revealed the existence of the NPA, but did
not produce it to the petitioners until the court directed it to be turned over subject to a protective
order; the NPA itself remained under seal in the federal district court. After the initial filings and
hearings, the CVRA case was dormant for almost two years while the petitioners pursued civil
cases against Epstein.

the litigation as “Jane Doe 2.”
