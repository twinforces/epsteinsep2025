agreement bind the Western District of Pennsylvania and bar it from charging the same offenses
in a subsequent prosecution? The Court held that it did:

We hold, therefore, that when a United States Attorney negotiates

and contracts on behalf of “the United States” or “the

Government” in a plea agreement for specific crimes, that attorney

speaks for and binds all of his or her fellow United States

Attorneys with respect to those same crimes and those same

defendants.
Id. at 550 (emphasis added); see also United States v. Van Thournout, 100 F.3d 590, 594 (8th
Cir. 1996) (“Absent an express limitation, any promises made by an Assistant United States

the bargain struck in the NPA, which Epstein fully performed and from which Accuser-4
benefitted. In sum, the USAO-SDNY is trying to prosecute Ms. Maxwell in Counts Five and Six
for the identical charges that were resolved by the NPA. In these circumstances, Annabi and its
