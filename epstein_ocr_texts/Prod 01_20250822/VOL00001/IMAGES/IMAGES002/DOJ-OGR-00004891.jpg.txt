constitutional right, was compelled to participate in a civil case after losing that right,
testified against his own interests, weakened his position there and ultimately settled the
case for a large sum of money, was tried twice in criminal court, was convicted, and has
served several years in prison. All of this started with D.A. Castor’s compulsion of Cosby’s
reliance upon a public proclamation that Cosby would not be prosecuted. The CDO’s
remedy for all of this would include subjecting Cosby to a third criminal trial. That is no
remedy at all. Rather, it is an approach that would place Cosby nowhere near where he
was before the due process violation took root.

There is only one remedy that can completely restore Cosby to the status quo ante.
He must be discharged, and any future prosecution on these particular charges must be
barred. We do not dispute that this remedy is both severe and rare. But it is warranted
here, indeed compelled. The CDO would shun this remedy because (at least in part) it
might thwart the “public interest in having the guilty brought to book.”*4 It cannot be
gainsaid that society holds a strong interest in the prosecution of crimes. It is also true
that no such interest, however important, ever can eclipse society’s interest in ensuring
that the constitutional rights of the people are vindicated. Society’s interest in prosecution
does not displace the remedy due to constitutionally aggrieved persons.
IV. Conclusion
We do not question the discretion that is vested in prosecutors “over whether
charges should be brought in any given case.” Stipetich, 652 A.2d at 1295. We will not
undermine a prosecutor’s “general and widely recognized power to conduct criminal
litigation and prosecutions on behalf of the Commonwealth, and to decide whether and
when to prosecute, and whether and when to continue or discontinue a case.” /d. (quoting
#4 See CDO (quoting Blue, 384 U.S. at 255).
