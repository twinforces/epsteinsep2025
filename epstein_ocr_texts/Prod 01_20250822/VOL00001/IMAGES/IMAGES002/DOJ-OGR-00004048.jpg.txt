Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell

‘Dear Judge Nathan:

The MDC letter, datéd April 28, 2021, submitted in résponseé to the Court?s memo-
‘endorsed. order to show ‘cause (Dkt. 249), fails to address the concerns raised.in my: April 26"
letter. The Court should summarily: deny the MDC’s request and require it to respond to the:
specifics in the Court’s order.

The claim that “[d]uring:Ms. Maxwell’s Icgal-wisit, staff'noted she'was in reccipt of
documents that were handed to her by the attorncys” docs:not justify. the confiscation and.review
of Ms. Maxwell’s confidential legal documents. Any documents which “Ms. Maxwell. was in,
reccipt” were documents that Ms. Maxwell brought to the visiting room. Counsel did. not hand to
‘Ms. Maxwell any: documents that-did not. originate ‘ftom Ms. Maxwell. Further, it'was after Ms.
Maxwell called, counsel to réport that her documents were scizéd and counsel, in turn, infornied
Ms. Maxwell that a.complaint would be made that MDE staff contacted. legal counsel.

Once again, the Court.is provided second-hand information from the MDC. Ms.
Papapetru, was not; present during the Iegal visit, does not:claim to have reviewed the video
recording ofthe legal visit, and failed to provide. any helpful, or reliable information (cither by
way of an.affidavit or declaration ‘ora copy of the recording) to rebut'the claims: before the
‘Court..A.reeycled:reporting of the g guards” inaccurate observation is an-inadequate response to a
significant problem. The’ MDC has failed to offer any legitimate, fact-based explanation, for
violation of Ms. Maxwell’s:6" Amendment rights. The Court should disregard the MDC’s.
response arid order the relief requested, on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.

Considering the MDC’s attempt to cast the conduct of its staff in.a positive light while:
casting’ aspersions on Ms. Maxwell and.counscl, we:request that the Court direct that the guards
responsible ‘for the inappropriate 'scizure: be summoned to ‘Court ‘and.a copy ofthe video
recording be provided to defense counsel.
