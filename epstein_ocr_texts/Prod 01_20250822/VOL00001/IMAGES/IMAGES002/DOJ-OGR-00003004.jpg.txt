Rieco, 549 F.24.264,.272 (2d,Cir. 1977). The’burdenis so heavy that it is rarcly met, by a defendant.
See DeMichele'v. Greéenbiirgh Cent® Sch. Dist. No. 7, 167 F.3d ‘784, 790-911, (2d Cir. 1999)
(“[W]hile the [Supreme] Court: may not. have shut the door. firmly on a ‘contention that at some
point the ‘Duc Proeess Clause ‘forecloses prosecution of a claim, because itis too old, at most the
door is barely ajar.”).

Substantial prejudice: is just that—substantial, actual, non-spcculative prejudice. See’
United. States v. Birney, 686 F.2d.1.02, 105-06 (2d Cir. 1982) (a defendant’s “proof of prejudice
must be definite and not speculative”); see, also United States:v. Henderson, 337 F.3d 914, 920
(7th, Cir. 2003) (prejudice sufficient to warrant dismissal, for pre-indictment delay must be “actual
and substantial” and “specific, concrete, and, supported by evidence”). Prejudice in this context:
refers to “actual prejudice to the defendant’s right to a. fair trial.” United States v. Elsbery, 602
F.2d 1054, 1059 (2d ‘Cir. 1979). “The mere, loss of witnesses or evidence, without. more, is
insufficient. Claims of loss:of: memory resulting from the passage, of time. have been held to be
insufficient to ‘warrant dismissal of' an, indictment on duc process grounds. See United States vy.
Wright, 343 F.3d 849, 860 (6th Cir. 2003); Henderson, 337 F.3d.at-919-20. Morcover, even:when
a.claim of prejudice:is based upon the complete loss of a-witness’s testimony. or other evidence; a.
defendant. nevertheless must show: how that. testimony or evidence would ‘have affected the
outcome or’ otherwise have assisted, the case. See United States’y. Gilbert, 266 F.3d 1180, 1187
(9th Cir. 2001) (defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim rejected. due'to failure to show “how the
testimony from [three absent] witnesses would have benefitted his case”); United States’v. Spears,
159 F.3d. 1081, 1085, (7th Cir. 1999) (“[A] defendant must do more than show that a. particular
witness is ‘unavailable and. that the witness’ testimony would ‘have helped. the defense.."He must:

also show: that: the witness would have testified, withstood, cross-cxamination, and ‘that: the jury’
