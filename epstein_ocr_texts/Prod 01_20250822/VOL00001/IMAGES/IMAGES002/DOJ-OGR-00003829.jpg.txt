1 that by fax this afternoon, will they be able to attend the

2 deposition tomorrow?

3 THE COURT: I would think so, if I think those are

4 adequate representations and so on. The statement from a

5 mediator doesn't mean anything to me. Something that has a

6 court sign to it. That I understand. But the mediator saying
7 that it's settled doesn't work for me.

8 MR. CASSELL: Your Honor, maybe Mr. Edwards could

9 briefly explain Florida procedure. The case has been

10 dismissed, but it does not require a Court's signature.

Le Mr. Edwards can elaborate more fully on that.

i MR. EDWARDS: Sure. If I may. There are two ways in
13 which a case can be dismissed in Florida. One is by way of a
14 court order. The other is by way of a stipulation. That is
LS what was done. There was a stipulation of dismissal signed by
16 both parties, that being the plaintiff and the defendants and
TZ counsel, that has been done and that was dismissed.

18 THE COURT: That's filed in the case.

a We. MR. EDWARDS: That's filed in the case and filed in
20 the court.
ZA. THE COURT: Do you have a copy of that?
22 MR. EDWARDS: I can get a copy of it immediately.
23. THE COURT: Give it to the defense. If they have any
24 problems, they will let me know. That sounds all right to me.
25 What do I know about Florida except that it's flat and hot.
