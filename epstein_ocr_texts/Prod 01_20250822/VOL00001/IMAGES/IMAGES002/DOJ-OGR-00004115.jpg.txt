would provide the defense with the identities of the victims eight weeks before trial, on May 17,
2021, assuming trial were to begin as scheduled on July 12, 2021. (Dkt. No. 229, 250). If the
Court were to schedule trial to begin on November 29, 2021, in order to address the three-week
adjournment that the Government is seeking, the Government would intend to provide the defense
with the identities of the victims referenced in the S2 Indictment eleven weeks before trial. The
Government understands that the defense objects to the Government’s proposal and requests that
the information be provided on May 17, 2021, which would be approximately six months in

Finally, the Government respectfully requests that the Court exclude time under the Speedy
Trial Act through the date on which trial will proceed on Counts One through Six of Indictment

indictment, including materials related to non-testifying witnesses and the Government’s expert
witness; to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make
and review additional pretrial disclosures, including proposed exhibits, proposed witness lists, and
witness statements; and to allow adequate time for the parties to prepare for trial. Accordingly,
the Government respectfully submits that the exclusion of time is in the interests of justice pursuant
to 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7). The Government has consulted with defense counsel, who consents to
the exclusion of time, but only through November 8, 2021. In view of the defendant’s previous
proposal ofa January 2022 trial date, however, the Government respectfully submits that exclusion
of time through November 29, 2021 is warranted here and consistent with the factors set forth in
the Speedy Trial Act. For the reasons noted above, the Government respectfully submits that the
