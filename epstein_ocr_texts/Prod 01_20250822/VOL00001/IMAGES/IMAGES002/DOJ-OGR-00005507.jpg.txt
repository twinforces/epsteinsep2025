1. Ee (Accuser 4) will testify that a (Accuser 5)
"recruited" her. Mot. at 38. How? What will RE: that TE ai to her?
Is it, "I am here to 'recruit you' to a sex abuse ring founded by Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine

outside the presence of Ghislaine Maxwell. So mere observation would not tell x
what she saw was "sexual abuse" unless J also said something about her age, and any
statement by J about her age at the time would be offered for the truth. Qa
