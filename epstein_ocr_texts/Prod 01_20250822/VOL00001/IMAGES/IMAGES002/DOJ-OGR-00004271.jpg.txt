[_, facilitated her'sexual, abuse, and itwas[ Jor Epstein,himself—not

Ms. Maxwell=who purportedly called her to schedule massage appointments, sent her gifts, and
encouraged.her to recruit .other young females to provide massages to.Epstein. Indeed, even.
after interviewing Accuser-4, the USAO-SDFL never found “any specific evidence against” Ms.
Maxwell related.to thé subject :of their investigation and:thus, déterminéd she was not a target of
the Florida Investi gation.”

Epstein, himself, was never:charged with.federal crimes in connection with:the Florida,
Investigation:[_____._ Instead, Epstein entered into a’ Non-Prosecution Agreement
(“NPA”).in order to “resolve globally” his own, criminal exposure and to immunize[_] and
any other “potential co-conspirators.”* As part'of the: NPA, Epstein. agreed ‘to plead guilty'to.
state prostitution offenses and register as a federal sex. offender. He.also agreed, in a-novel
arrangement, to pay for'attorneys to represent his:victims.incivil lawsuits against him and to
waive, his tight to contést' damages up, to an. agreed-upon settlernent amount. Accusér-4 'took ‘full
advantage of the NPA; she received. both the benefit of experienced counsel and[ —__to
resolve’ her:claims ‘against. Epstein, and,his “potential co-conspirators.”

Now, over 13 years later, AccuSer-4 has. surfaced again, except this. time with apparently:
brand-new allegations against/Ms. Maxwell. Seemingly unconcemed with the gaping
‘inconsistency in Accuser-4’s prior (and near contemporaneous) recollections, the government
has added two new counts :charging Ms. Maxwell. with.sex trafficking offenses under 18 U.S.C. §

1.591 (Counts. Five and. Six), and. has dramatically expanded, the timeframe of the Mann Act:

"Ex A (Dep’ ‘cof Justice, Office. of Professional Responsibility, Investigation: ‘into. the:U.S: Attorney’ s Office for the
Southern.District:of Florida’s Resolution ofits 2006:2008' Federal Criminal Jny estigation of Jeffrey: Epstein and Its,
Tnteractions with Victims: :during: the Inv ‘estigation, ‘November 2020) (; “OPR: Report” ) at 1.67 (internal quotations
