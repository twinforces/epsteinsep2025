Note

1. The data on which Figure 1 is based are derived from year-by-year searches
of Google Scholar for the combination of the terms “child sexual abuse” and
“srooming,” excluding citations and patents. One should not assume that the
underlying database is complete or that all the publications included in the count
use “grooming” in this way or represent peer-reviewed literature, as newsletters,
government reports, books, and other documents also make their way into such
searches. Nonetheless, the graph gives an adequate representation of the growing
use of the term “grooming” for this purpose.
