Walder, 347 U.S. at 65.

Accordingly, the Court need not resolve the pending suppression motions, because the
Government does not intend to use these materials in its case-in-chief. However, to the extent the
defendant puts these materials at issue at trial either through the defense case or cross-examination,
the Government reserves its right to use these materials, for example, to cross-examine the
defendant, or to offer prior consistent statements of witnesses, should it be appropriate to do so.
In addition, the Government further reserves its right to use these materials at trial for any purpose
that would be permissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, even assuming these materials
were suppressed.

Respectfully submitted,
