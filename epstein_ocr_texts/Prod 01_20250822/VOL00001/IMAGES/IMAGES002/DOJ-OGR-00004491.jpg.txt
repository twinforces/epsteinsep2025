Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 194 of 349
Villafafia had raised (defense counsel’s attempt to insert an immigration waiver into the
agreement), but Lourie did not comment on the provision promising not to prosecute co-
conspirators or ask Villafafia to explain why she believed the provision did not harm the
government’s interests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafafia asked Lourie for
“TaJny other thoughts,” but there is no indication that he provided further input. OPR found no
document that suggested Villafafia and Lourie discussed the provision further, or that the other
individuals who were copied on Villafafia’s email referencing the provision—her immediate
supervisor, the supervisor designated to succeed Lourie as manager of the West Palm Beach office,
and Villafafia’s co-counsel—commented on or had substantive discussions about it. Villafafia told
OPR that because none of the three supervisors responded to her observation that the non-
prosecution provision “doesn’t hurt us,” Villafafia assumed that they agreed with her assessment.

Villafafia told OPR that she could not recall a conversation specifically about the provision
agreeing not to prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally that
defense counsel told her Epstein wanted “to make sure that he’s the only one who takes the blame
for what happened.” Villafafia told OPR that she and her colleagues believed Epstein’s conduct
was his own “dirty little secret.” Villafafia said that press coverage at the time of Epstein’s 2006
arrest did not allege that any of his famous contacts participated in Epstein’s illicit activity and that
none of the victims interviewed by the case agents before the NPA was signed told the investigators
about sexual activity with any of Epstein’s well-known contacts about whom allegations arose
many years later.”** Villafafia acknowledged that investigators were aware of Epstein’s longtime
relationship with a close female friend who was a well-known socialite, but, according to
Villafafia, in 2007, they “didn’t have any specific evidence against her.”*°? Accordingly, Villafafia
believed that the only “co-conspirators” of Epstein who would benefit from the provision were the
four female assistants identified by name.”*° Villafafia also told OPR that the focus of the USAO’s
investigation was Epstein, and the office was not inclined to prosecute his four assistants if he
entered a plea.”4! Because Villafafia was unaware of anyone else who could or would be charged,
she perceived no reason to object to a provision promising not to prosecute other, unspecified
“co-conspirators.” Villafafia told OPR that given her understanding of the facts at that time, it did
not occur to her that the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be used to protect any
of Epstein’s influential associates.

Lourie, who was transitioning to his detail at the Department’s Criminal Division at the
time Villafafia forwarded to him the draft NPA containing the non-prosecution provision, told OPR
that he did not know how the provision developed and did not recall any discussions about it.
238 Villafafia told OPR that “none of . . . the victims that we spoke with ever talked about any other men being
involved in abusing them. It was only Jeffrey Epstein.”

29 The FBI had interviewed one victim who implicated the female friend in Epstein’s conduct, but the conduct
involving the then minor did not occur in Florida.

AAO The FBI had learned that one of Epstein’s female assistants had engaged in sexual activity with at least one
girl in Epstein’s presence; this assistant was one of the named individuals for whom the defense sought the
government’s agreement not to prosecute from the outset. Villafafia explained to OPR that this individual was herself
believed to also have been at one time a victim.

24l Villafafia told OPR that the USAO had decided that girls who recruited other girls would not be prosecuted.
