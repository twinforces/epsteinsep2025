instructed, “Don’t talk to [the'‘victims]. Don’t tell them ‘what’s, happening;” but: she was not told
why'she should not speak:to:the victims, and, she could not recall who gave her this instruction. In,
a. subsequent OPR.:interview, Villafafia recalled that when she raiscd the: issue: of notification.
during x the meeting, she was: told, “Plea. negotiations are confidential. You-can’t disclose them.”2*
Villafafia remained-uncertain who g gave her this instruction, but belicved.it:may have been Acosta.

Neither Acosta, Sloman, ‘nor.Menehel reealléd a mecting at which Villafana ‘was, directed
not to notify the: victims. Acosta‘told OPR that the decision whether. to: solicit the victims’ view
“is: something [that] I think, was the focus of the trial team and not something that I was focused.
on at lcast at this time,” and. he did not.“recall discussions about victim, notification until after the
NPA ‘was signed.” Sloman, also told OPR that: he did not recall a meeting at which victim.
notification was discussed. Mencheél wrote in his résponsé to OPR, “I have no recollection of any’
discussions or.decisions regarding whetherthe USAO should:notify victims-of its intention to enter
into a.pre-charge disposition. of the Epstein matter.” Furthermore, Menchel. told OPR.he could not
think: of a, reason. why the issuc of victim notification would have arisen before he Icft the USAO,

have: been “premature” to consider‘notification.””*

3. September 6, 2007: Villafana. Informs Sloman, Who Informs Acosta,
of Oosterbaan’s Opinion That Consultation with Victims Was
Required.

On ‘September 6, 2007, in.a lengthy cmail. to 'Sloman responding to, his question. about the
government’s then-pending offer to the defense, Villafafia raised the victim. consultation issuc,
advising: that, “the agents and. have:not reached out to the victims to get their approval, which. as
[CEOS Chief Oosterbaan] ‘politely reminded ‘me, 1s, required under, the Jaw” and that “the [PBPD]

ARK Villataha could,not reéall the specific. date of the mecting. but Merichel left the USAO on August 3. 2007.
28, Villafafiaalso recalled ‘Menchel raising: a-concern, that “telling: them, about the negotiations could cause
‘victims to exaggerate their storics because-of their desire to obtain damages from.Epstein:”

290 In commenting. on OPR’s draft report. Menchel’s counsel reiterated. his, contention, that Villafafia’s claim
about a ‘meeting. involving. Menchel. in which she. was instructed. not to consult with ‘victims was inaccurate and,
inconsistent:with otherevidence. OPR carefully considered’the :;comments but.did.not conclude. that the evidence to
which Menchel’s attorney’pointed necessarily:refuted Villafafia’s;assertion.that she had received an instruction from
a supervisor not to inform:victims about: the plea negotiations. ‘However, :it 1s also true that OPR.did. not ‘find any:
reference in, the emails and other documents dated before the NPA, was signed to a meeting at which victim
consultation was: discussed jor to: a. specific instruction not to: consult with the victims. This:is one‘of several, events
about which Menchel. and ‘Villatafia, disagreedy but given. OPR’s conclusion ‘that the Department did ‘not: require
prosceutors: to: consult. with victims before charges were brought, OPR. does not. reach, a conclusion regarding the
alleged meeting and:instruction.
