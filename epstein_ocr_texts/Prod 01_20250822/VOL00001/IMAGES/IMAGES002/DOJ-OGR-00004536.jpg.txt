On October 12, 2007, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form:notice letter to a, victim,
‘the case agents had: ‘interviewed two days earlier. This Ictter'was,identical'to the VNS form notice
letter the FBI. Victim Specialist sent ‘to.other victims before the NPA. Was signed, describing the
case as: “under investigation” and requesting the: victim’s “patience.” The Ictter listed the cight,
CVRA rights, but made .no-mention, of the NPA, or the § 2255 provision. ‘Villafafia told OPR. she:
was unaware the FBI sent the Ictter, but ‘she knew “there were efforts to:make sure that we had.
identified all victims of the crimes underinvestigation.” In:response’ to, OPR’s questions about-the
accuracy ofthe EBI lettcr’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafana told.
OPR that, the NPA.required, Epstein. to enter a plea. by October 26, 2008, and “at this point we
werent. actively looking, for additional charges,” but “the: investigation. wasn’t ‘technically
suspended, until he completed. all the terms .of the NPA.”

D. The USAO Informs. the Defense That Jt Intends, to Notify Victims by Letter
about. Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal
Investigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification, Plan

In anticipation of Epstcin’s: state court:plea, Villafafia reported. on’November 11.6, ‘2007, to
Acosta, Sloman, ‘and other supervisors that: she had, learned, ‘from: FBI agents who met with,
Assistant State’ Attorney: Belohlavek; that the State} Attorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify’
wictims of the state plea hearing.

[Belohlavek] would still like‘us to do the victim, notifications. The
State does not, have a.procedure (like ‘we do federally) where, the
Court.has to ‘provide a ‘separate room. for'victims who-want to'attend
judicial proceedings, so 1 do not know’ how many ‘victims will
actually want to. be:present*""

Belohlavek told, OPR. that she did not. recall the conversation. referenced, by the: FBI nor any
coordination between her office and federal officials to, contact or notify victims about: Epstcin’s
State plea hearing.

On November 19, 2007, Villafafia decided that to. avoid any: misconduct accusations: from,
the defense about. the information given to victims, she “would. put the victim, notification ‘in
writing.” She provided Sloman‘with a draft victim:notification letter, in; which among other'things,

Alo Not all the individuals interviewed qualified, for inclusion, on, the victim list: For example, one’ ‘would not

cooperate with;investigators; a second claimed:to have simply massaged Epstein, with:no sexual, activ ity; and_a third,
claimed she had no-contact with:Epstein.,

al. Villafaiia told OPR that she: understood ‘the state: took the position that because “there: was cither:only one or

two victims inyolved:in their case.they “could not do: victim notifications to alljof the:victims:”
