B. Applicable Law

“Although the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure grant the Court authority to strike
surplusage from an indictment, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 7(d), ‘[i]t has long been the policy of courts
within the Southern District to refrain from tampering with indictments.’” United States v. Bin
Laden, 91 F. Supp. 2d 600, 621 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (quoting United States v. Jimenez, 824 F. Supp.
351, 369 (S.D.N.Y. 1993)). “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be granted only
where the challenged allegations are ‘not relevant to the crime charged and are inflammatory or
prejudicial.’” United States v. Scarpa, 913 F.2d 993, 1013 (2d Cir. 1990) (quoting United States
v. Napolitano, 552 F. Supp. 465, 480 (S.D.N.Y. 1982)). ““[I]f evidence of the allegation is
admissible and relevant to the charge, then regardless of how prejudicial the language is, it may
not be stricken.’” /d. (brackets in original) (quoting United States v. DePalma, 461 F. Supp. 778,
797 (S.D.N.Y. 1978)); see also United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d 91, 99 (2d Cir. 2001). “This
standard is an exacting one, and only rarely is alleged surplusage stricken from an indictment.”
