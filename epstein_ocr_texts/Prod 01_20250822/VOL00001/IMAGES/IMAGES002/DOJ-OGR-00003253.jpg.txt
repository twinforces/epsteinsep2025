E. Villafaiia Drafts a “Term Sheet” Listing the Requirements of a Potential
Agreement. with the Defense

A meeting with defense counsel was scheduled for Tuesday, July 31, 2007. Villafafia told.
OPR that between July’ 26 and July 30,2007, she had “some sort. of discussion” with. her
supervisors that ‘resulted, in her creation of a “term sheet” identifying the proposed terms for
resolving the ‘federal ‘investigation through state charges. Sometime during that.period, Villafana
left a voicemail message for Menchel. ‘During their OPR interviews, neither. Villafafia nor
Menchel. could. recall what. Villafafia.‘said ‘in, that message.., On, July 30, 2007,, Menchel emailed.
Villafaria:

I received your voicemail. this morning. I don’t sce. any reason to
change our approach. ‘I think: telling them that unless ‘the state
resolves this ‘ina way that, appropriately’vindicates our interests and
the interests of the victims, we will, seck, [federal charges] conveys
that, we are sérious. While Lilly [Sanchez] has represented in the
past ‘that’ this ‘would likely not happen, I never conveyed it in. quite
these terms before. In. any: cvent, this is‘the course: of'action that the
US Attorney fecls comfortable taking at-this juncture.

before:scen or heard.of'a:non- prosccution:agreement and that:it was a concept“completcly foreign”
toher.** Villafafia:told OPR that the idea of styling the two-ycar state plea.agreement with-Epstein,

the, state:indictment. OPR considered various potential state. charges involving various: numbers of'vietims and found,
no, obvious:reasonable state sentencing guidelines calculation,.that-would have resulted in a'two-year sentence.

RS Deferred prosecution:and.non-prosecution.agreements were standard, though infrequently-used, vehicles for
resolving certain:federal criminal cases against corporate entities. A-2008 Departmental. memorandum explained:

The terms: “deferred. prosecution. agreement” and “non-prosecution agreement”
have oftem been. used loosely. ‘by’ prosecutors, defense counsel, ‘courts and
commentators., .As the terms arecused.in these/Principles [of Federal Prosecution
of. ‘Business Organizations], a deferred prosecution’ agreement. is typically
predicated‘upon the filing:of a.formal charging document by. the government, and
the: agreement tis: filed with the appropriate ‘court. In the inon-prosecution
agreement context, formal ‘charges.are ‘not filed.and. the agreements maintained
by ‘the! parties ‘rather than being filed. witha court. Clear.and. consistent use: of
these'terms: will cnable’the Department'to more effectively identify ‘and share best
practices’ and to track the7use of: such‘agreements., These Principles do: not apply
