Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document397 Filed 10/29/21 Page 74 of 84

First, the defendant moves to exclude Government Exhibit 52, which it says was obtained
by the Government “as part of discovery in Guiffre v. Maxwell civil litigation . . . with no
explanation about its origin.” (Def. Mot. 7 at 1). The defendant misidentifies the exhibit.
Government Exhibit 52 is a physical contact book belonging to the defendant. The records
attached by the defense as Exhibit 1 appear to be a scan of Government Exhibit 52 that was
produced in discovery in Giuffre v. Maxwell. But the Government will not offer that scan at trial.
It will offer the physical book itself, along with scans taken by the Government of the physical
book. A witness with personal knowledge of the physical book is expected to testify to its
authenticity.

The defendant takes issue with the history of the Government’s acquisition of Government
Exhibit 52. The defendant is correct that the Government came into custody of this exhibit after a
former employee of Jeffrey Epstein attempted to sell it to a civil lawyer suing Epstein. (/d.). The
defense calls this “particularly troubling” (Def. Mot. 7 at 2), but that argument is misplaced. How
the Government acquired the exhibit goes, if anything, to its weight and not its admissibility. Ifa
witness can identify the exhibit based on its contents, that is sufficient to pass the relatively low
bar for authentication of evidence.” See Al Farekh, 810 F. App’x at 24-25.

Finally, the defendant argues that the contents of Government Exhibit 52 are hearsay
because they are not a business record. (Def. Mot. 7 at 4-6). The exhibit is separately admissible
not for the truth of the matters asserted therein (such as the accuracy of the contact information for
victims), but to establish that the defendant kept contact information for relevant individuals at
trial, including victims. The exhibit has evidentiary value in showing that the defendant
