Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 280 Filed 05/14/21 Page2of2
Page 2
The parties seek this extension in order to permit continuation of productive discussions

that the parties have already initiated regarding the pretrial schedule. The parties conferred
yesterday for approximately 45 minutes by telephone on that topic. Although the conversation
was productive, there remain multiple points of disagreement. The requested extension will permit
the parties to consider each otherâ€™s proposals as to certain deadlines, and to further confer with the
aim of minimizing the points of disagreement that will need to be resolved by the Court.

Respectfully submitted,

AUDREY STRAUSS

United States Attorney
