regarding the four victims in‘the S2. Indictment. As.a result, the Government ¢xpects that trial on.
the ‘non-perjury counts can’be completed. within approximately three to four weeks. |

Because the S2 Indictment was returned ‘more: than’three months in advarice of the July. 12,
2021. trial date, the defense’s reliance on. United States 'v. Guzman, 754 F.2d. 482, 486 (2d. Cir.
1985) to'supportits, request for an adjournment is entirely misplaced. In Guzman, the district court:
ordered the defendant to stand trial one day after the return of a superscding indictment that
‘expanded the scope of the charged. conspiracy by an additional two’ycars. That is plainly’ not the:
case here, because the S2 Indictment ‘was, returned on March 29,2021, more’ than, three ‘months
‘beforestrial. Indeed, it is:telling thatthe defense cites no case in which the Second Circuit-has held
that a district court lacks the discretion, to conduct a trial, three months after a, superseding
indictment.has been filed. Any such decision.would.be surprising, given that the Specdy Trial Act:
expressly contemplates trial commencing “within seventy days ‘from the filing date (and making
public) of the information, or indictment, or ‘from ‘the date the defendant has. ‘appeared, before:'a,
judicial. officcr of the court in which. such. charge ‘is periding, whichever date last occurs.” 18
USC. §3161(c)(1). ‘Incother words, the defense has more:than sufficient time to prepare for trial.

between, the return of the $2 Indictment and July. 1.2, 2021.

' The defense misleadingly:suggested.in its April ‘15,2021 Ictter and again in:its most:recent Ictter
that the Government; has. doubled, its trial ‘estimate: from:two to ‘four wecks. (See Dkt. No. 202 at:
7). As notéd in its April 9; 2021 letter, however; the Government initially estiniated,that its case-
in-chicf would last approximately'two 'wecks aiid suggested that the Court reserve three, weeks in.
total for the trial, to include jury selection. and. the defense case. (See Dkt. No. 199 at 4). The
Government has now: added only one weck to that-prediction, estimating that its: case-in-chicf may’
Jast-up to'three wecks and-proposing that the Court reserve four wecks in total. fortrial. Although,
‘this, prediction includes an estimate of any anticipated cross-examination and defense case, the
Government, of course, cannot. bé certain. how long stich defense presentations will take during,
trial. Morcover, given. that the parties have. consented ‘to the ‘use ‘of jury questionnaires, the:
Government’s hope i is that their use will expedite jury sclection in, order to‘preserve as many: days
as possible for the trial beginning on July 12, 2021.
