dismiss those charges improperly asks the Court to adjudicate her guilt. It is for the jury to decide
whether the defendant committed perjury, and the motion should be denied. Sixth, the crimes in
the indictment should be tried together, as all six counts of the indictment are logically connected
and provable through overlapping evidence. The Court should not sever this case, and thereby
require victims of child sexual abuse to testify at multiple trials. Seventh, the Indictment
indisputably alleges each element of every offense charged and provides the defendant with ample
notice of the charges against her. Eighth, the Indictment is properly pled and there is no basis to
strike any portion of it as surplusage. Ninth, the defense motion to dismiss one of the conspiracy
charges as multiplicitous is premature. Tenth, the defendant is not entitled to a bill of particulars
or any of the other early disclosures she seeks. Finally, the use of a grand jury sitting in White
Plains to return the Indictment in this case was entirely proper.
