Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in connection with the Court’s Order dated
August 27, 2021 (Dkt. No. 330). The parties have conferred, in accordance with the Court’s Order,
and submit the enclosed joint proposed juror questionnaire and joint proposed voir dire. Where
the parties disagree in the enclosed documents, the parties have so indicated and included the basis
for the objections. In particular, the text proposed by the defense to which the Government objects
is in green with specific objections in comment bubbles. The text proposed by the Government to
which the defense objects is in purple with specific objections in comment bubbles.

The defense respectfully requests that the joint proposed juror questionnaire and joint
proposed voir dire be filed under seal to avoid media coverage that may prejudice the jury selection
process. The Government consents to the defense’s request.
