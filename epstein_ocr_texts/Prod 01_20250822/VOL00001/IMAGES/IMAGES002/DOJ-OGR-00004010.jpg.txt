I. Requests 6 and 7: Engagement Letters

The Defendant provides no explanation at all as to how engagement agreements between
BSF and Annie and Maria Farmer would be relevant and admissible at trial, and thus cannot clear
the Nixon hurdles. She states in a conclusory manner that “[t]he scope and dates of these
engagements are relevant to Ms. Maxwell’s pending motions” and that “these agreements are
exculpatory evidence.” Resp. Ltr. at 8. But it is entirely unclear how the fact that the Farmers are
represented by BSF and the dates of the engagement letter could possibly be exculpatory, and the
Defendant does not attempt to explain that proposition.

Nor are the engagement letters relevant to any of the Defendant’s pretrial motions. The
Defendant’s motions to suppress appear to be based on a theory that the Government improperly
obtained evidence from BSF while it was representing Virginia Giuffre (not the Farmers) in
Giuffre v. Maxwell. ECF Nos. 134, 140. The only relevance of Annie Farmer to the Defendant’s
motion for dismissal based on pre-indictment delay appears to be based on Maxwell’s statement
that Ms. Farmer was interviewed by the FBI in 2006. ECF No. 138 at 2. But the Defendant has
not explained how an engagement letter between Annie Farmer and BSF is of any consequence to
her theory. The Defendant also points out in her motion for dismissal based on pre-indictment
delay that Annie Farmer may have cooperated with the Government in the criminal investigation
of her abuser—an unremarkable proposition. /d. at 18. Not only is it unclear how this theory
supports the Defendant’s arguments about pre-indictment delay, but the Defendant again has not
explained how an engagement letter with BSF is relevant to this theory.

As to Maria Farmer, she is only relevant to the motion for dismissal based on
pre-indictment delay insofar as the Defendant argues that the Government knew about the
allegations against the Defendant when Maria Farmer reported them to the NYPD years ago. ECF
