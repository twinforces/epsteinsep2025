that, . although the holding » conflicted with the 2005 Guidelines, the‘ ‘court? S opinion makes § sense.”

Déan involved. a federal prosécution arising, from, a 2005 explosion at an. oil refinery
operated by BP Products North “America, Ine. (BP) that Killed 15 people and injured more than.
notifying ‘the victims. “The sovernmeat: filed a: ‘sealed, motion, alerting the district court to ‘the
potential. plea and claiming that; consultation with. all the victims was impractical and that.such
notification, could result in.media coverage that would undermine the plea negotiations. The court
then. entered. an. order prohibiting the: government from notifying the victims: of the pending plea
agreement’ until afterit had’been signed: ‘by the parties. Thereafter, the government filed a criminal
‘information, the government.and BP’ signed the'plea‘agreement, and.the g government mailed-notices
of the ‘plea. hearing to the victims informing them of their right to be heard. ‘One‘month later, 12
wictims asked. the Court to, reject the plea because it. was entered, into in violation. of their rights
under. the CVRA. The district court denied their motion, but concluded that the CVRA rights to
confer with. the prosecutor.in the case: and,to be: treated. with. fairness and respect. for the victim’s
dignity’ and. privacy. vested’ prior to the ‘initiation, of charges.**° The district. court, noted. that the
legislative history reflected a, view that “the right'to confer was intended to be broad,” ‘as well. as
being a “niechanism[]” to ¢nsure. that victims were'treated ‘with fairness.

In.denying the victims relief, the Fifth Circuit:nevertheless concluded. that the district court
“failed:to accord the victims the rights conferred by the CVRA. 346 In particular, the Fifth Circuit:
cited the district court’s. acknowledgement that: “‘[t]here are clearly ‘rights under the CVRA ‘that.
apply before any prosccution is underway.” The Fifth Circuit also noted that: such consultation.
was hot “an. infringement” ‘on the governmicnt’s independent prosecutorial diserction, but “it is
only a requirement that the government ‘confer :in some reasonable way ‘with. the ‘victims before
ultimately cxercising its broad discretion.” In. the: wake of the Dean opinion, two, Department
components wrote separate memoranda to the Solicitor General with opposing views concerning
whether the:CVRA right to confer with the;prosecution vests:priorto the initiation of a.prosecution.

According to an affidavit ‘filed in the CVRA litigation by her attorney, Bradley Edwards,
Wild retained Edwards in June 2008 to represent her “because she was ‘unableto get anyonc from.
the [USAQ] to tell her what was actually going on with the federal criminal case against Jeffrey
Epstein.”>4” ‘Villafafia told OPR that Wild. did ‘not contact her directly and.she was not aware of
