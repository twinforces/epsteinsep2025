Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document317 Filed 08/13/21 Page 11 o0f14

VI. No bill of particulars is warranted.

Maxwell nioves for'a bill of:particulars as to counts five and six. Fedéral Rule of
Criminal Proecdure 7 requires that an. indictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite written
‘statement of the essential, facts constituting the offense charged[.]” The, indictment must be:
Specific cnough to inform the defendant’ of the charges and allow the defendant'to plead double.
jcopardy’ in a later, prosecution based. on,the: same events. See Wnited States v, Stavroulakis, 952
F.2d 686, 693 (2d:Cir. 1992). “Under this test, an, indictment need do little more than to track the
language of the statute charged.and state the time and place (in approximate:terms) of the alleged
crime.” United States. v. Tramunti, $13 F.2d.1087, 1113 (2d Cir. 1975).

“Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits a defendant to seck.a bill
of particulars in order. to identify‘with sufficient particularity ‘the nature of the charge pending,
against.him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for'trial, ‘to prevent surprise, ‘and to interpose
a:plea.of double jeopardy should.he be prosceuted a.sccond time for the same offense.” Wnited
States: vy. Bortnovsky, 820 F .2d.572, 574 (2d Cir. 1987). “The purpose of a, bill of ‘particulars jis to
supplement:the’ allegations in the indictment: when necessary. to (1) enable the defendant.to
prepare his defense, (2) avoid unfair-surprise:to the defendant at-trial,, and (3) preclude:a second
prosecution of the same offense.” United States v. Mandell, 710'F.. Supp. 2d 368, 384 (S:D.N:Y.
2010)). On. the other hand, 'the Court. must.balanee these interests against the harm to, the
Government from restricting, its proof at trial. See United States ‘v..Rajaratnam, No. 09-cr-1184
(RJH), 2010: WL 2788168, at *I (S.D.N.Y. Jul. 13, 201.0);

In. her previous motions, Maxwell argued that the Mann Act counts in the indictment
should-be dismissed for lack of specificity or that, in the alternative, the Court should compel the

Government to:submit a bill of particulars providing greater detail of the charges. Maxwell.
