VI. _No bill of particulars is warranted

Maxwell moves for a bill of particulars as to counts five and six. Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 7 requires that an indictment contain “a plain, concise, and definite written
statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged|.|” The indictment must be
specific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allow the defendant to plead double
jeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events. See United States v. Stavroulakis, 952
F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. 1992). “Under this test, an indictment need do little more than to track the
language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in approximate terms) of the alleged
crime.” United States. v. Tramunti, 513 F.2d 1087, 1113 (2d Cir. 1975).

“Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits a defendant to seek a bill
of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity the nature of the charge pending
against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to prevent surprise, and to interpose
a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second time for the same offense.” United
States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. 1987). “The purpose of a bill of particulars is to
supplement the allegations in the indictment when necessary to (1) enable the defendant to
prepare his defense, (2) avoid unfair surprise to the defendant at trial, and (3) preclude a second
prosecution of the same offense.” United States v. Mandell, 710 F. Supp. 2d 368, 384 (S.D.N.Y.
2010)). On the other hand, the Court must balance these interests against the harm to the
Government from restricting its proof at trial. See United States v. Rajaratnam, No. 09-cr-1184
(RJH), 2010 WL 2788168, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Jul. 13, 2010).

In her previous motions, Maxwell argued that the Mann Act counts in the indictment
should be dismissed for lack of specificity or that, in the alternative, the Court should compel the
Government to submit a bill of particulars providing greater detail of the charges. Maxwell
