Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21. Page 312 of 349

principles ‘was: too expansive, hhis ‘view ‘of the federal. interest in ‘prosecuting Epstein. was too
narrow, and_ his understanding of. the state system was.too imperfect to justify the decision to use:
the NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta, assumed a. significant: role in reviewing’ and. drafting the
NPA and:the other thie subjects. who, were supervisors left the USAO, were-transitioning to other
jobs, or were absent at critical junctures, Acosta should have ensured:more effective coordination.
and communication during the negotiations and before approving x the final NPA. The NPA. was a.
unique resolution, and. one that requircd. greater oversight and.supervision than Acosta provided.

OPR. further concludes that none, of the subject attorneys committed professional
misconduct ‘with respect. to: the government’s interactions: with. victims. The subjects did not
intentionally or recklessly" violate a clear and unambiguous duty under the CVRA; by entering, into
the NPA. without consulting with, victims, because the USAO. resolved the Epstein investigation
‘without a ‘federal criminal charge. Significantly, at the time the NPA:was, signed, the Department:
did ‘not interpret CVRA rights to attach unléss and until. federal. charges had been. filed, and. the
federal :courts had :not ‘established. a. clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA. before
criminal-charges were brought. :In addition, OPR did not find evidence that the:lack of.consultation.
was for the purpose of silencing victims. ‘Nonetheless, the lack of consultation’ was part of a scrics
of government interactions with, victims that ultimately led ‘to public and court :condemnation, of
the government’s ‘treatnient of the victims, reflected poorly on the Department as. a ‘whole, and. is
contradictory to the Department’s. mission to minimize the frustration and confusion ‘that ‘victims.
‘of a‘crime endure: 7

OPR determined, that none: of the subjcets was responsible, for communications sent. to
certain. victims after'the NPA. was signed that described, the case as “under investigation” and, that.
failed to inform them,of'the NPA. The letters were sent by an FBI administrative employee who
‘was not. directly involved.in the ‘investigation,, incorporated standard. form. language: ‘used by the
FBI when communicating ‘with victims, and were: not: drafted or revicwed. by: the subjects.
Morcover,. the ‘statement. that. the matter was “under investigation” was not false because the
government: in fact continued to investigate the case in, anticipation that Epstein’ would. not. fulfill
the terms of the NPA. However, the letters risked:misl¢ading the victims anid contributed to victim
frustration. and. confusion by: failing to provide :important ‘information. about the status ‘of ‘the
investigation. The letters also demonstrated.a ‘lack of coordination between. the federal agencics
responsible for communicating with Epstein’s victims and showed. a lack ‘of attention, to and.
oversight regarding communieation with. victims.

After the NPA. was signed, Acosta. elected. to defer to the State Attorney the decision.
whether to notify victims about the:state’s plea hearing pursuant to'the statc’s.own: victim’s. rights
requirements. Although Acosta’s decision was within his authority and. did, not constitute
professional ‘misconduct, OPR. coneludes that. Acosta, exercised poor judgment when he failed to
make cértain that the state intended. to, and would notify victims identified through ‘the federal
investigation about the state plea-hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about an important’
proceeding that resolved the federal. investigation, an. investigation about which, the USAO had.
‘communicated. with victims for months. ‘It also ultimately created. the misimpression, that: the:
Department ‘intentionally sought to silence the victims. Acosta failed to ensure’that; victims. were
made aware of a court proceeding’ that-was, related to their own cases, and. thus he failed to censure
that Victims Were treated ‘with forthrightness and dignity.
