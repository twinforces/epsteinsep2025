and then followed the directives it reecived.37

Most critically, however, ‘even. if the Government’s .motion did not satisfy Martindell,
Maxwell offers no ‘legal authority for the proposition, that suppression is the proper remedy.**
Indeed, rioné of the Second Circuit’ cases. applying Martindell contémplaté suppression. as a.
remedy. See, e.g. In re Grand. Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. 19, 1991, 945 F.2d at
1224 (remanding for findings “on whether the protective order ‘was improvidently’ granted or:
whether the government-had made a:showing of'execptional.circumstances or.a-compelling:need”);
Palmieri, 779 F 2d at 862 (reversing district:court’s modification of protective:orders where district.
court. did not make an “express finding’ of improwidence, extraordinary circumstances, or

compelling need and. “remand[ing] for further proceedings ‘consistent. with.this opinion”).

*” Maxwell asks this Court to ‘review and reverse Chief Judge MeMahon’s exercise of her
discretion, in modifying the protective order, because 'she disagrees, with Chief Judge McMahon’s
analysis of the: Martindell factors. Although Chief Judge McMahon’s order modifying the civil
protective. ordér ‘was not entered. or the civil docket, that order, along with the Governinent’s
application. and related matcrials, were: produced.to the defense on or about.August 12, 2020. As
a. result, Maxwell ‘could have sought review of. Chicf Judge McMahon’s ‘order, in, the: Second.
Cireuit. See Fed. R.App..P. 4(a)(6). Maxwell asks ‘this ‘Court to second-guess, a cocqual district:
court’s decision to, modify. a protective order: Putting aside the question. of whether this Court.
even. has the authority to do so, it should in any event’ decline. Maxwell’s, invitation to. act as. a.
reviewing court to Chief Judge: MeMahon’s decision, which was made in her “sound discretion.”

38 To the: extent that: Maxwell secks suppression. of documents created prior ‘to the entry’ of the
‘protective ordér (or created after its entry but not, subject. to its protections), that aspect of her
motion. should. be denied. .A. significant amount of the materials provided in.:response to ‘the:
subpoena included such pre-cxisting documents not created.in-reliance ona: ‘protective order, which.
do ‘not trigger the Martindell presumption ‘in the Sccond. Circuit, see TheStreet. com, 273 F.3d at.
234-235; Davis, 702 F.2d at 422. Maxwell’s arguments also do not extend to transcripts of other
individuals’ depositions, who were not partics to the-protéctive order.
