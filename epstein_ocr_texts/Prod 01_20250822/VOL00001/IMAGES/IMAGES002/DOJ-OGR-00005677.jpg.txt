allege’three' distinct, episodes of alleged sexual abuse, in. three different. locations, involving three
separate accusers. The allegations of Accuser-3. stand. on their own and,are not “inextricably’
intertwined” with-the allegations of Accuser-1..or Accuscr-2, nor do'they stem.from “the same
series of:transactions.” In fact, they have no bearing on or connection'to those allegations
whatsoever. Because. Accuser-3’s allegations are conceptually’ distinct, they’ are also not
“necessary to ‘complete the story” of the charged conspiracics. See Cummings, 60 F. Supp. 3d at
438 (defendant’s prior crack arrests and firearms conviction, not sufficiently: connected to
underlying conspiracy: to distribute crack and possessing fircarms to: be admissible); Townsend,
2007 WL 1288597, at.*2 (defendant’s prior narcotics and firearm transactions with the same
confidential. informant not.“inextricably intertwined” with the charged:fiarcotics conspiracy, even
though the conduct'was “gencrally similar'to the conduct underlying the offenses charged in the
indictment?’); Whited.States 'v; Mahaffv, 477 FE. Supp..2d.560, 566 (E:D.N.Y. 2007) vacated. in
parton other grounds 285 Fed. App’x.797 (2d. Cir. 2008) (similar prior financial érime, not
inextricably’ linked to the charged. crime where prior act “was a:separatc, disercte offense that
may be conceptually scgregated from. the charged offenses without impairing the jury’s ability: to
understand the ‘facts underlying the schemes alleged in:the indictment”), Nektaloy, 325 F. Supp.
2d at 369-70 (prior similar moncy laundering transactions between defendant and. cooperating
witness not “inextricably intertwined” with the charged moncy laundering offense or “necessary
to complete the story” of the charged.conspiracy (emphasis in original)).

The fact that the government included Accuser-3’s allegations in'the $2: Indictment: is of
no consequence. Although Rule 404(b) typically governs the admissibility of “other acts” that

‘under the mistaken belief that Accuser-3, was a minor’when she chgaged in sex acts ‘with Epstein:
