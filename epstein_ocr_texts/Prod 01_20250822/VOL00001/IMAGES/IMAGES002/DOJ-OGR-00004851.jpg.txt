the assault as a consensual encounter.” /d. “Furthermore,” the court opined, “Ms.
Constand did not report the assault until approximately one year later, further supporting
the Commonwealth’s need for the evidence.” /d. at 110. With regard to the prejudicial
impact of the evidence, the court suggested that it had sufficiently mitigated any potential
prejudice when it limited the number of witnesses who could testify. (at the second trial)
to just five of the nineteen witnesses that the Commonwealth requested. /d. The court
noted that it found all nineteen witness’ testimony to be relevant and admissible, but
limited the number to five so: as to mitigate the prejudice to Cosby. The court added that
it gave cautionary instructions on the permissible Use of this evidence, designed so as to
limit its prejudicial impact. /d..at 110-11.

Finally; the trial court rejected Cosby’s challenge to the admissibility of the contents
of his deposition testimony to thé:extent that it concerned his use of Quaaludes in:decades
past. The:court opined that Cosby's “own words about his usé and knowledge of drugs
with a depressant effect was relevant to show his intent and motive in giving a depressant
to [] Constand.” /d. at115. Because the evidence demonstrated Cosby's knowledge of
the effects of drugs such as Quaaludes, the court reasoned, Cosby “either knew
[Constand] was unconscious, or recklessly disregarded the risk that she could be.” /d.
As with the Rule 404(b) witnesses, the court found that any prejudicial effect of this
evidence was mitigated by the court's cautionary instructions. /d. Accordingly, the court
trial opined that: all of the Rule 404(b) evidence was admissible.

At the conclusion of a second jury trial, Cosby was convicted on all three counts of
aggravated indecent assault. Following the denial of a number of post-trial motions, the
trial court deemed Cosby to be a “sexually violent predator” pursuant to the then-
applicable version of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (‘SORNA"), 42
Pa.C.S. §§ 9799:.10-9799.41. The trial court then'sentenced Cosby to three to ten years
