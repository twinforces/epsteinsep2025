Chemical’ Bank, 154 F.R.D. at. 94 (describing such, materials a “technological. trade ‘secrets,
currently. sensitive customer lists, or contemporarily sensitive competitive ‘information, which
could. benefit :rivals”). Rather, the Government seeks materials that relate to. among the: gravest:
criminal. offenses it investigates—the Sexual éxploitation of minors—which materials, if revealed,
would.tend.to:ineulpate and/or embarrass. some paitics to the Proteetive Order. ‘Indeed, by the very’
terms of the: Protective Order, the confidential. matcrials appear to be of the category for which.
“[a]voiding: cmbarrassment . . . is not by itself a valid reason for courts to uphold confidentiality:
as ‘against:a legitimate law enforeement need. for the information.” /d.; see also Prot. Order at; 2
(designating as “confidential” information “whose ‘public release would violate common Jaw and
Statutory privacy'interests”). “Aside from, those restrictions [laid down by the Fourth. or Fifth,
Amendment or applicable: statutes], hiding possible criminal violations: from law enforcement.
authorities is hardly'a ground for judicial protection of'confidentiality.” Chemical Bank, \SF.R.D.
at 94.

Finally, this is unlike a ¢asé in Which. the contours of the civil litigation are publicly
apparent.. Cf Subpoena Duces Tecum, 945 F.2d at. 1223, (noting that a “lengthy: report” of. the
bankruptcy, examination in that case “was made available to the public”). In Subpoena Duces
Tecum, for example, not only. was the government:apparently unconcerned-with,the confidentiality
of the ¢g grand j jury investigation, but. the government; knew from a lengthy public report ‘precisely’
what it: might.replicate through a grand jury:investigation. /d.. Not so with respect to the Litigation,
which resulted:in no'such report, no trial, and limited public: filings..

For all of these reasons, and for the reasons sct forth in the Application, the Government.
respectfully requests that the Court grant;the, Application.

Respectfully: submitted,
