Indictment. before determining whether the plain-statement rule of Annabi applies. Annabi, the
defendant, suggests, creates a three-part schema for analyzing the relationship between. newly
charged. offenses and. carlicr plea agreements: if the: offense: is not covered by the plea agreement,
the agreement is irrelevant; if the offense is covered by the agreement but;different! from. acount:
“resolved” when that agreement was entered, the Anndbi tulc:applics; and.if:theoffense is. identical.
to a “resolved” count, Annabi is silent. (Def. Mot. at 13-14). Nothing in.Annabi comes close to
articulating this,unusual. and confusing ‘rule. Instead, ‘the language the defendant points to in.
Annabi. simply addressed—and rejected—the defendants’ effort to distinguish-precedent.. Indeed,
nothing about the reasoning of Annahi turned on whether the new case charged.the’ same offenses
that were at. issucin ‘the original plea agrecnient or'other offenses that:might:still be covered by the:
plea agreement.

Morcover,-the eases ‘in, which;the Second. Circuit:has applied Amnabi provide no support to
the defendant’s theory. Like Annabi itsclf, those cases .cvaluate, the text and. history of ‘plea.
agrecments to determine the scope: of the immunity provided. by those agreements, including ‘by:
application, of the affirmative appearance rule. Sée; &e., United: States v. Prisco, 391 F. App’x
920, 921 (2d.Cir. 20.10) (summary-order) (“In the absence of any: language in the New: Jerscy-plea
agrecment to suggcst-otherwise,.and with no compelling reason to infer any‘intent fo the contrary,
we décline to extend the New Jersey plea agreement beyond its clearly. stated terms.” (citation

omitted)); United. States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x. 268, 270. (2d Cir. 2004).(““Thus,. we conclude:

The defense motion uses the phrase “exact same” when asserting that: this rule exists; but ‘it-is
unclear what preciscly. that means because itis not a legal term of art, and there are: of Course
complicated :considerations when examining the similarity or differences between. charges,, as
Double Jeopardy:Clause jurisprudence: illustrates. The defendant’s motion does not offer a mode
of analysis | for this nuanced 1 issuc, but i in any event the Court need not. resolve the: question of
