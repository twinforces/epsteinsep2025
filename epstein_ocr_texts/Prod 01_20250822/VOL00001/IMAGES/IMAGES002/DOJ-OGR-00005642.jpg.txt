Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 386 Filed 10/29/21 Page 18 of 24

Finally, Rocchio’s second. opinion is inadmissible under Rules 704: and 403. It’s
inadmissible undér Rule 704 because it amounts to an. opinion that the alleged victims in this
case are'testifying truthfully. The credibility of the accusers, however, isa question for the jury
to decide. It-is not‘properly the subject of an expert opinion.

Roechio’s proposed testimony also Violates Rule 403, because :it-risks jutors accepting
her “expert” opinion as gospel at the expense oftheir duty to.cvaluate the evidence and-to come
‘to'their own independent judgment. And because ¢xpert: opinion testimony’ can. be both
“powerful” and “misleading,” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 595, the balance: weighs in favor of exclusion
when the predicate for the opinion—grooming—is itself unreliable and not-helpful to the jury.

C. Opinion 3: Repeated exploitation and abuse can increase the likelihood of

victimization later in life and can result:in. long-term traumatic and
psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in the context of
complex trauma.

Rocchio’s third opinion—that:repeated ‘exploitation.and abuse can increase the likelihood
of victimization, later in, life. and can result in long-term,traumatic.and psychological
consequences, especially when it occurs in:the. context of complex:tratima—has nothing todo
with this case. It is irrelevant and-unfairly prejudicial.

This case is about onc'thing: Whether the government:.can prove each. of the clements of
the indicted offenses beyond.a reasonable doubt. See. United States v. Garcia, 413 F.3d 201,215
(2d Cir. 2005) (“[TJhe jury’s singular:responsibility to decide from the evidence admitted. at trial
Whether the government. has carried its burden of proof beyond.a reasonable doubt.”’). That is‘the
‘only thing the:jury will be asked.to decide, and it’s a decision that has nothing to do with the
“long-term traumatic ‘and, psychological consequences” of alleged abuse. Rocchio’s opinions on,
those eonseqtiences ate irrélevant'urder Rule, 401 and 402, they will not assist the tricé of fact iti

deciding the case, Fed. R. Evid. 702.
