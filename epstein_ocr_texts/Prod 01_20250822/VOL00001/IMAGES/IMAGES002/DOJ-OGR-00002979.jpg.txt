limitations. As the defendant’s motion recognizes, the: Second ‘Circuit has emphasized, that plea.
agreements differ ‘from commercial. contracts in meaningful respects. (Def. Mot. | at 30 (citing:
United States v. Feldman, 939.F.3d 182,189 (2d. Cir. 2019) (“[W]hile the district court’s. analysis
might. have: been. compelling with respect to a contract. ‘arising out of commercial, negotiations.
among private partics, we belicve the court did not correetly apply’ the standards. that govern the
agreements are significantly’ different: from commercial contracts.”))). Accordingly, although the
third party: beneficiary doctrine isa tenct of contract law, :its application toplca. agreements under
federal law is a, separate question.

The defendant. correctly. notes that plea agreements may. address leniency for third. partics.
(Def. Mot. | at 15). However, it docs not:nccessarily follow that.a third party may enforce such a
promise. ‘Indced, ‘itis, far from.:clear that, under federal law, a third, party may’ cnforee a,'plea,
agreement. At least one court’ in this Circuit has noted the absence of authority that a-third party
has standing, to ‘enforce another individual’s plea agreement. See Santobello v. United States, No.
94 Cr. ‘119 (RPP), 1998 WL 113950, at: *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 1998) (“Even if Santobello could
establish the ‘existence of plea agreements: between the. Government and. his: co-defendants, there
is, little known authority that would. allow ‘him, to enforce the agreements as a. third. party
beneficiary.”) (citing United States v.. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 36-37 (1st.Cir. 1991)).

Following this logic, at Icast one court has concluded that third. partics lack standing to
enforee plea agreements. In United States v. Mariamma: Viju, the defendant claimed. that. the
‘Government had entered. into a plea. agreement’ with. her husband, ‘under which. the Government’
had promised not to prosecute her. 'No. 18 Cr.'240, 2016 WL 107841, at *1 (N:D. Tex. Jan. 11,

2016). ‘Observing that. the principles governing interpretation of:plcea agreements diverge in many’
