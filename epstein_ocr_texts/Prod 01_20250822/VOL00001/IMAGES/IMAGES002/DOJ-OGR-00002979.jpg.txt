limitations. As the defendant’s motion recognizes, the Second Circuit has emphasized that plea
agreements differ from commercial contracts in meaningful respects. (Def. Mot. 1 at 30 (citing
United States v. Feldman, 939 F.3d 182, 189 (2d Cir. 2019) (“[W]hile the district court’s analysis
might have been compelling with respect to a contract arising out of commercial negotiations
among private parties, we believe the court did not correctly apply the standards that govern the
interpretation of plea agreements with the government. We have long recognized that plea
agreements are significantly different from commercial contracts.”))). Accordingly, although the
third party beneficiary doctrine is a tenet of contract law, its application to plea agreements under
federal law is a separate question.

The defendant correctly notes that plea agreements may address leniency for third parties.
(Def. Mot. 1 at 15). However, it does not necessarily follow that a third party may enforce such a
promise. Indeed, it is far from clear that, under federal law, a third party may enforce a plea
agreement. At least one court in this Circuit has noted the absence of authority that a third party
has standing to enforce another individual’s plea agreement. See Santobello v. United States, No.
94 Cr. 119 (RPP), 1998 WL 113950, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 13, 1998) (“Even if Santobello could
establish the existence of plea agreements between the Government and his co-defendants, there
is little known authority that would allow him to enforce the agreements as a third party
beneficiary.”) (citing United States v. Lopez, 944 F.2d 33, 36-37 (1st Cir. 1991)).

Following this logic, at least one court has concluded that third parties lack standing to
enforce plea agreements. In United States v. Mariamma Viju, the defendant claimed that the
Government had entered into a plea agreement with her husband, under which the Government
had promised not to prosecute her. No. 15 Cr. 240, 2016 WL 107841, at *1 (N.D. Tex. Jan. 11,
2016). Observing that the principles governing interpretation of plea agreements diverge in many
