the USAO’s interpretation of the agreement: and. “the use of Section, 2255.” The: Starr and.
Lefkowitz letter asserted ‘it: was.“wholly inappropriate” forthe USAO to send the*proposed victim,
notification, letter “under any circumstances,” and “strongly ‘urg[ed]” Acosta ‘to, withhold the
notification. letter until. after the defense ‘was, able “to discuss ‘this matter with Assistant’ Attorney
Gencral-Fisher.”

The following day, Sloman, sent a Ictter'to Lefkowitz, with copics.to Acosta, and Villafaria,
asscrting thatthe VRRA obligated the government. to notify victims of the 18. U.S.C. § 2255
proceedings as “other rclicf” ‘to which. they were entitled. Sloman. also stated that the VRRA.
obligated theg government to provide the victims with information concerning ‘restitution to: which.
mey may be entitled. and. “the ¢ ear Hest Possible” notice of the status of the: investigation, the ‘filing

allowing Mr. Epstein to plead. to ‘a. state - offense. “The victims
identified through the federal investigation should be appropriatcly
informed,.and our Non-Prosecution Agreement docs not require the
US. Attorney’s Office to forego [sic] its legal obligations. >!"

‘Sloman also addressed. the defense objection, to advising the’ victims to contact Villafafia. or the
FBI .case agent with questions or conecrns: “Again, federal law. requires that victims, have the
‘réasonable right to..confer with. the attorney for the Government in this case.’” Sloman advised,
the defense: “The three victims who ‘were notificd prior to your objection had. questions. directed
to:Mr. Epstcin?s punishment, not-the:civil litigation. Those questions arc appropriately directed to
law enforcement.”

Along with this letter, Sloman forwardéd to Lefkowitz for comment.a revised, draft victim
notification. letter that was substantially similar to the prior draft. provided to ‘the: defense. The:
letter stated. that. “the federal. investigation. of Jeffrey Epstein. has been completed,” Epstein would.
plead guilty. in state court, the’partics would:recommend 18 months of imprisonment at sentencing,
and Epstein would. compensate victims for damage claims brought under 18 U.S.C. '§ 2255. The
letter-provided specific information. concerning the upcoming change of-plea hearing:

As I mentioned. above, as part. of the resolution. of the: federal
investigation, Mr. Epstein has agreed toplead. guilty fo state charges..
Mr. Epstein’s, change of ‘plea, 'and sentencing will, occur on
December 14,2007, at _a.im., before Judge Sandra K. McSorley;

ald See-42 US.C. § 1,0607(¢)CL)(B) and.(c)(3)-
als Emphasis: in-original. Sloman also, stated that the USAO did not seck to; “federalize™ a state plea, but *
simply informing the victims of their rights: ‘Villafafa, informed OPR that Sloman approved and signed the ietter,
but she was the; ‘primary author of ‘the document. OPR notes ‘that Villafaia was the principal author of most:
correspondence i in the‘Epstein case, .and.that: following the signing of: the NPA, regardless of whether the letter went:
out with her, Sloman’ s; or Acosta’s’ signature, the three attorneys-reviewed and edited drafts of most correspondence
before a.final version was-sent to the defense.
