The government also improperly stretches the scope of the alleged conspiracies in a
failing attempt to make its allegations regarding Accuser-3 fit within those charges. For
example, the government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s alleged role in purported lawful sexual
activity involving Epstein and Accuser-3 in England is “evidence of the defendant’s agreements
with Epstein to identify minor girls to entice and transport for purposes of illegal sex acts.”
(Opp. 162.) But the Indictment does not allege that Ms. Maxwell conspired with Epstein to
“entice” minor girls to commit illegal sex acts, let alone to “identify minor girls” for such an
enticement. Nor could it, since mere “enticement” to commit illegal sex acts is insufficient to
establish a Mann Act violation. The alleged conspiracies were conspiracies to entice or cause
minors to travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sex acts, and the Indictment does not allege
that Accuser-3 ever traveled or engaged in illegal sex acts.

The government commits a similar Freudian slip in its attempt to distinguish United
States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp. 2d 14 (D.D.C. 1998), when it states that “the allegations regarding
[Accuser-3] involve conduct that falls within the heartland of the conspiracy: grooming a minor
girl to engage in sex acts with Jeffrey Epstein.” Opp. 164 n.59. The “heartland of the
conspiracy” is actual or contemplated interstate travel of minor girls to engage in unlawful
sexual acts with Epstein, which the government cannot establish with respect to Accuser-3. The
government’s opposition repeatedly treats interstate travel, the linchpin of federal court
Jurisdiction over the alleged conduct and the necessary object of the conspiracies alleged, as a
throwaway element of its case.

In short, neither the allegations regarding Accuser-3 nor the government’s proffer
establish an intent that Accuser-3 (i) engage in “illegal sex acts” or (11) travel while a minor. The
