The government also improperly stretches the scope of the alleged. conspiracies in,a
failing attempt to: make its allegations regarding Accuser-3 fit within those charges. For
example, the government asserts that Ms. Maxwell’s alleged role in purported lawful sexual.
activity involving Epstein and Accuser-3 in’England is “evidence of the defendant’s agreements

sexual acts with Epstein, which.the government cannot establish. with.respect'to Accuser-3, The:
government's opposition repeatedly ‘treats, interstate travel, the linchpin of federal court.

In short; neither the allegations regarding Accuser-3 nor the government’s proffer
