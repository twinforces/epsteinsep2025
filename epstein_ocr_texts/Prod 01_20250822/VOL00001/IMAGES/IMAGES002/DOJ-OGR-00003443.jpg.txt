F. 2010 - 2011: Department and, Congressional Actions Regarding.
Interpretation of the: CVRA.

In conncction with.the Department’s 2010 cffort to:update its 2005 Guidelines, the Office
‘of the Deputy Attorney General convened a Victim of Crimes Working Group that asked OLC to
revisit-its 2005 preliminary review concerning the definition. of “crime victim” under the CVRA.
and-solicited input concerning the issuc:from Department.componcnts and federal law enforcement.
agencies. In. response, OLC issued a December 17, 2010 opinion entitled, Zhe Availability of
Crime Victims’ Rights Under the Crime. Victims’ Rights Act of 2004. Based on the CVRA’s
language, aclevant case law, and memoranda opinions. from Department. components, OLC
reaffirmed its 2005 conclusion that CVRA:rights do not-vest until.a criminal charge ‘has been filed.
(by complaint, information, or indictment) and, the rights ccase to be: available if “all charges ‘are
dismissed, citheér voluntarily or On, the merits (or if the [g]overnment.declifies to bring ‘formal
charges. after the filing of'a complaint).”>™*

After OL€ issued. its opinion, the Department.revised the.2005 Guidelines in October201],
but didnot change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did, not vest until after, criminal,
charges, were filed. The 201.1 revision did, however, add. language concerning victim.consultation
before,a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where. plea negotiations occur before. a case has
been. brought, Department ‘policy is that this should include: reasonable consultation prior. to. the:
filing ofa charging instrument with the court. 37 The use of the word “should” in, the 2011)
Guidelines ‘indicates that “personnel are expected to take the action . . . unless there is an.
appropriate, articulable reason not. fo do so.”3*° Nevertheless, the required consultation “may be
general ‘in nature” and “docs not have to be specific to a particular plea offer.°3"! The revisions
also specificd that. AUSAS.were to ensure that victims had.a right to be reasonably heard at plea
proceedings.*™” .

On ‘November: 2,201.1, U.S. Senator Jon. Kyl, a co-sponsor of the CVRA, sent.a letter to
Attorney General Eric. Holder, arguing: that the 2011 Guidelines revisions ‘“conflict[éd] quite
clearly with:the CVRA’s plain. language” because the 2011 Guidclines:did.“not extend any rights
to victims until charges have been filed.» The Department’s response emphasized. that. the
