National Enquirer on the details of its published interview with Cosby, and that Attorney
Schmitt negotiated a term of the settlement agreement with Constand that required her
assurance that she would not cooperate with any future criminal investigation. Thus, the
Commonwealth argued, and the Superior Court agreed, that “[i]Jt was not necessary for
the trial court to specifically state that it rejected .. . Schmitt’s testimony, as it is patently
obvious that his testimony belies his claim that there was some ‘promise’ from [Mr.] Castor
not to prosecute.” /d. (quoting Commonwealth’s Superior Court Brief at 136-37). The
Superior Court agreed that “the evidence was entirely inconsistent with [Cosby's] alleged
reliance on Mr. Castor’s promise in choosing not to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege
in the civil suit.” /d. at 413-14.

For the same reasons, the Superior Court rejected Cosby’s claim that the trial court
erred in failing to suppress his deposition testimony due to the immunity that he
purportedly should have enjoyed. The court opined that Cosby’s suppression argument
was “contingent upon his claim that Mr. Castor unilaterally immunized [Cosby] from
criminal prosecution, which we have already rejected.” /d. at 414. The panel
distinguished all of the precedents upon which Cosby relied, including this Court’s
decision in Commonwealth v. Stipetich, 652 A.2d 1294 (Pa. 1995).

In Stipetich, Pittsburgh police personnel had promised George and Heidi Stipetich
that, if they answered questions about the source of the drugs found in their home, no
charges would be filed against them. After the Stipetiches fulfilled their part of the
agreement, prosecutors charged them anyway. /d. at 1294-95. The trial court granted
the Stipetiches’ motion to dismiss the charges on the basis of the police promise. /d. at
1295. This Court ultimately held that the Pittsburgh police department had no authority
to bind the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office to a non-prosecution agreement.
Id. However, this Court opined:
