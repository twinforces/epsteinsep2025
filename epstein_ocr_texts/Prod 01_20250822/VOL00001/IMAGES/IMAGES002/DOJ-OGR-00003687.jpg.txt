Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 13 of 34

Based, on the 'statute’s text, context, and history, the Court follows Weingarten and,
concludes that'the appropriate inquiry is whether the charged.offenses involved the sexual abuse
of a minor on-the facts alleged. in this case. There:is no question. that'they did. The Court thus
concludes that § 3283 governs the limitations period forthe charges ‘here.

2. The.2003 amendment to the statute of limitations applies to these offenses

Maxwell next contends that because the charged. conduct took place before the
PROTECT Act’s enactment, that:statute did. not lengthen the statute of limitations applicable’ to
her alleged offenses. Here:too, the Second. Circuit has:provided. guidance in its. decision in
Weingarten. Although the court did not provide a definitive answer there, it explained that the
wicw Maxwell now takes conflicts with established,principles of:retroactivity anid the decisions
‘of at least two other circuit courts. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at'58 & n.8; see Cruz v. Maypa, 773:
F.3d 138, 145 (4th Cir. 2014): Wnited. States v., Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d,920, 924 (9th. Cir.
2006).

The Supreme Court has set out a two-step framework to determine whether a federal
statute ‘applies to past conduct. See Landgraf'v. UST Film Prodiicts, 511 U.S. 244,:280:(1994).
‘Courts look first to the language of the statutc. If the statute states that it applics to past conduct,
courts must so apply.it., Weingarten, 865 F.3d.at,54.. Otherwise, the statute applies to past.
conduct:unless doing: so would create impermissible retroactive effects. Jd.

The Court begins with.Landgraf’s first. step. ‘To assess.a statute’s meaning here, courts
must consider the text of the statute along with. other indicia of congressional ‘intent, including
the statute’s history and structure. See Enter. Mortg: Acceptance Co., LLC, Séc. Litig. v. Enter.

Mortg. Acceptance Go., 39) F.3d 401, 406 (2d:Cir. 2004).
