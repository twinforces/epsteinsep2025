Lourie described the promise not to ‘prosecute “potential, co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told.
OPR that'he did not-_ know why it:was.included,in.the:agreement, but added that it; would be “unlike
me if.] read that. language’to just.lcave it in thercvunless, | thought:it;was somchow helpful.” Lourie
posited that victims who recruited. other underage: girls ‘to provide. massages ‘for. Epstein.
“theoretically” could have been charged.as co-conspirators. He told OPR that when he saw’ the
provision, he: may have: understood the: reference: to ‘unnamed “co- conspirators” as “a message to
any victims that, had recruited ‘other ‘victims that.there was no intent to charge them.”

Acosta did not recall any’ discussions about the on-prosécution provision. But' he, told.
OPR that Epstcin:was always * “the focus” of the federal investigation, and he would ‘have viewed
the federal, interests as ‘vindicated as long as ‘Epstein, was required. to face “meaningful,
consequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR. that when he reviewed. the draft. NPA, “[t]o the
extent I reviewed this, co-conspirator‘provision, I can speculate’ that: my thinking would. have been

lesser. involved [individuals], is not the: focus of this.” Acosta also told’OPR that he assumed
Villafatia.and Lourie: had. considered. the provision. and. decided that it was appropriate. Finally,
‘Sloman, whowas not ‘involved in negotiating the NPA, told-OPR. that in retrospect, he understood.
the non-prosceution, provision. was designed, to protect Epstcin’s -four ‘assistants, and. it. “never

This ‘broad provision, promising not: ‘to prosccute * “any potential co-conspirators” is
troubling and, as discussed-more fully later in this Report, OPR.did not find evidence showing that.
