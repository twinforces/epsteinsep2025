Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document204 Filed 04/16/21 Page 176 of 239

“such evidence might lead to evidence . . . which would justify forfeiture”)., The jury, need. not.
decide the outcome of the defamation. case in order to evaluate whether truthful answers were
capable .of influencing the decisionmaker ‘or. could reasonably have led, to the discovery of
admissible evidence.*4

Finally, the defendant argues ‘that’ severanée is appropriate. because including the perjury
‘counts “will necessarily: introduce intothe'trial the issue of Ms. Maxwell’s credibility.” (Def. Mot.
Sat.13). That-is truc'‘anytime:perjury. or false statements counts, are joincd'with other offenses, yet.
joining’ perjury: or false statements. counts to the substantive: crimes they concern is the rule, not
the exception. And. more generally, the “adverse effect of being tried, for two crimes rather than
one” is not prejudice. Werner, 620 F.2d.at.929.

Trying the perjury counts with. the.Mann. Act counts they concern. makes eminent. sense.
Doing so. greatly advanecs judicial efficiency by avoiding'the:nced. for two trials at’ which the same:
evidence would-be presented, including testimony fromthe same Victims. Just'as, the counts are
liberal joinder'principles behind Rulc 8, the defendant identifics at most only “generalized claim[s]
of prejudice,” Rivera, 546 F.3d at 254, that can be cured. by:.an appropriate limiting instruction.

‘She thus falls far short of mecting her heavy burden, and. her motion:should’be denied.

“The defendant relatedly suggests that ‘her counscl, from, the defamation suit may: have: to testify:
regarding the perjury counts, denying her counsel of her choice, She has:not:identified what factual
issue they might testify.to and why it must.come from.one of the lawyers ‘who represented her on,
both that case: dnd. this one. The Government totes, in this réspeet, that. three of the deferidant’s
attorneys.in this.case had:no involvement in-the civil suit. Even.if'such testimony were necessary.
by onc: of the defendant’s lawyers, it would :only disqualify the firm. if that lawyer is called “ona
significant issue’ other than on. behalf of the client, and, it is apparent that. the testimony may: be
prejudicial;to'the client.” N-Y.'R.P.C..3.7(b); see generally Murray v. Met. Life Ins. Co., 583 F3d,
173,.177-80 (2d Cir. 2009) (discussing the advocate-witness rule).
