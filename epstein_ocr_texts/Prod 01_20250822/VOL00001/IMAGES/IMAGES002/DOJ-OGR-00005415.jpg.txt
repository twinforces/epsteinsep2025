Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 380 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page 22 of 54
investigation into Epstein and his co-conspirators, leading to a 2019 indictment against Epstein
and a 2020 indictment against the defendant.

The defense has indicated that it will seek to make the prior investigations and charging
decisions the subject of testimony at this trial. For example, the defense has notified the
Government that it seeks to call FBI case agents from these investigations to testify “concerning
the scope, timeline, and resolution of the investigation, as well as the various investigative steps
taken by the agents, including by not limited to testimony about numerous witness interviews
they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, [and] documents they obtained by subpoena.”
(See Exhibit A). In their voir dire motion, the defense stated that they expect “Epstein’s arrests
and prior convictions for sexual misconduct, allegations of his sexual misconduct of minors over
the course of two decades, and his untimely death awaiting his federal trial will be front and
center” at this trial. (Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 342 at 2).

The Court should preclude any evidence and argument about (1) charging decisions in
criminal investigations of Epstein and his co-conspirators, and possible reasons for those
decisions, and (2) the investigative steps taken during the current and prior investigations,
including the length of those investigations. The Government’s charging decisions are squarely
within its discretion and not a probative topic on which the jury should speculate, and the
Government has no obligation to use any particular investigative technique. The Court should
not permit evidence on these subjects, which would create an irrelevant sideshow that would
significantly delay this trial and confuse the jury. Similarly, the Court should not permit the
defense to call FBI case agents in order to introduce evidence about those topics.
