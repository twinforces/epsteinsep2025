IV. Preclusion of the Purported. Statements is the Only Appropriate Remedy

Fed. .R: Crim. P.. 1:6(d)(2)(C) provides that if-a, party ‘fails to comply with the Court’s
orders regulating discovery the Court may’ prohibit that party ‘from introducing the undisclosed

A. district court’s decision to impose a Rule 16(d)(2) sanction forthe: violation. of.a.
discovery order, and thus its -choicé of sanction, is,a matter Committed to the Court's sound
discretion. In, exercising its discretion, the district court must-weigh several factors, including the
reasons for'the government’s delay’ in affording the required discovery, the extent of prejudice, if
any, the: defendant has: suffered because of. the delay, and the ‘feasibility of'curing such prejudice
by granting a,continuanee. Unifed States v, Wicker, 848 F.2d. 1059, 1060 (1 0th Cir. 1988).

The Supreme Court's decision in /av/orv. [Mindis, 484 U.S. 400 (1988) is instructive.
Taylor involved the exclusion. of a:witness of whom the defense had known but failed to
disclose. The defendant challenged, the trial court's exclusion of the witness as a sanction, forthe:
discovery violation, alleging that it Violated his. right to present witnesses ‘under ‘the Sixth
Amendment’s compulsory process clause. In determining, whether a preclusion, sanction is
appropriate, the Court mandated that.a trial court. excercise its discretion. by balancing a.
defendant’s fundamental. right “to offer the testimony: of witnesses in his favor” against
countervailing public interests., /d. at 414. These ‘interests include’ [t]he integrity of the adversary
‘process, Which depends both on.the:presentation. of reliable evidence and the rejection. of
unrcliable evidence, the interest in-the fair. and.cfficient administration. of justice, and. the:
potential’prejudice to the truth-determining function of the trial’process.” Jd: at 414-15. The trial.
court may also consider the willfulness of the Violation, the simplicity of compliance ‘with the
discovery obligation, and whether some unfair tactical, advantage‘has been sought. See id. at

415-17. Considering these factors, the Court‘upheld the éxclusion ofthe defendant’s witness.
