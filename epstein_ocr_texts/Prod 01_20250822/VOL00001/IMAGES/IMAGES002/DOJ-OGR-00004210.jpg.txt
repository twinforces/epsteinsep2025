“circumstances.” See Complaint. Ms. Maxwell denied the allegations made stating they were
“untrue” and “obvious lies.” Plaintiff claims these statements are defamatory because she has
been called a “liar.”

“A public figure claiming defamation under New York law must establish that ‘the
statements ... complain[ed] of were (1) of and concerning [the plaintiff], (2) likely to be
understood as defamatory by the ordinary person, (3) false, and (4) published with actual
malice.’” Biro v. Conde Nast, 963 F. Supp. 2d 255, 276 (S.D.N.Y. 2013), aff'd, 807 F.3d 541
(2d Cir. 2015), and aff'd, 622 F. App'x 67 (2d Cir. 2015).

If Ms. Maxwell’s statements are essentially true — Plaintiff lied — Plaintiff cannot
establish her claim, and it is an absolute defense.” Further, if Plaintiff cannot prove actual malice
by Ms. Maxwell, her claim fails. See Contemporary Mission, Inc. v. New York Times Co., 842
F.2d 612, 621 (2d Cir. 1988) (limited purpose public figure must establish by clear and
convincing evidence that the defendant published the alleged defamatory statement with actual
malice, “that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was
false or not”) (quoting New York Times, 376 U.S. 241, 280 (1964)). That is, Plaintiff must prove
that Ms. Maxwell permitted the publication of the statement knowing it to be untrue.

None of the witnesses identified are listed as having discoverable information regarding
any of the elements of this claim. None is claimed to have direct knowledge to confirm the truth
of Plaintiff's claims about what happened ‘fo her, that the acts she claims she participated in
> There is only one public statement that existed on January 2, 2015 to which Ms. Maxwell was responding in the
statement by her press agent. The document is the Joinder Motion filed in the Crime Victims’ Rights Act case on
behalf of Plaintiff by her attorneys, Bradley Edwards and Paul Cassell. Menninger Decl., Ex. A, p. 4. The very first
line describing Jane Doe #3 Circumstances is false, I (tread: “In 1999, Jane Doe #3 was
approached by Ghislaine Maxwell,” and continuing that “Maxwell persuaded Jane Doe # 3 (who was only fifteen

cas old) to come to Epstein's mansion” Is

evidence” can overcome the fact that Ms. Maxwell’s statement was correct and that statements in the Joinder
Motion were untrue.
