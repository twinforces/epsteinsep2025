would.be impractical because the Governnient would necd.to prove conduct beyond the elements
‘of the offense. It: may be true:that:this approach. requires the Government to prove some
additional. facts, but ‘any statutc-of-limitations, defense presents ‘factual, issues (including, at-least,
when the alleged conduct.took place). This.is:not a Serious. practical:problem and. does. not
justify setting aside the:statute’s language and.apparent:purpose.

Maxwell relies, primarily on.Bridges vy. United States, 346 U.S. 209 (1.953), to urge this
‘Court to cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme Court in Bridges addressed.a statute:that extended
the ‘limitations period for defrauding the United.States during the Second World’ War. In:that
case, the Supreme Court first.concluded. that making false statcnients at an immigration hearing
was not subject to the extended limitations period because it lacked any-pecuniary clement as
required. by the:statute. Jd: at 22.1. Then, as an‘altcrnative basis for its holding, it explained, that:
the offense did not require. fraud as an, “essential ingredient.” Jd. at 222. It-reached that
conclusion. in large part’because the statute’s legislative history made clear'that:Congress
intended it to apply. only to.a narrow: class of war frauds causing pecuniary. loss. Jd. at 216.

As the Second Circuit.explained :in Weingarten, Congress had.the opposite intent in the
enacting in the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d.at,59 & n, 10. “In passing. recent statutes
‘related. to child sex abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations period, Congress
‘evinced a.gencral. intention to ““cast.a wide net to cnsnare:as many:offenses against children as
possible?” /d..at-60 (quoting Schneider, 801 F.3d at 196 (quoting United States vy. Dodge, 597
F.3d 1347, 1355 (l1th.Cir. 201.0) (en bane))). The primary’ basis. for Bridges’ holding—
legislative history:supporting a narrow interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the:

statute’s:plan meaning and its Icgislative history. suggest: it should. apply. more broadly.
