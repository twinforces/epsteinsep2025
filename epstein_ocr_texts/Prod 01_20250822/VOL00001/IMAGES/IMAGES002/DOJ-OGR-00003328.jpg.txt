Sentencing y Guidelines, and: ‘the’ PROTECT Act “in their charging, case c disposition, and: senteneing
practices.”!°

The Ashcroft Memo dirceted. that, “in. all federal cascs, federal. prosecutors must. ‘charge
and ‘pursue the mostiscrious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by:the: facts of
the case,” execpt as authorized by an Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or designated,
supervisory authority in.certain articulated. limited circumstances. The Ashcroft. Mcmo cautioned.
that a charge is not“readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a. 00d faith doubt, based on cither
the law-or the evidence, as to the g government’ s ability to prove the charge at: trial The Ashcroft
‘Memo explains that. the: “basic: policy” “ “requires federal prosccutors to: char
charges that, are determined. to’ be ‘readily. provable” and would yield the: most substantial sentence
‘under the Sentencing’ Guidelines.

The policy set forth:six exceptions, including a catch-all exception. that permits a prosecutor
to:decline to pursuc readily provable charges “in other exceptional, circumstances” with,the written,
or otherwise documented approval ofan, Assistant Attorncy General,'U.S. Attorney, or “designated.
supervisory attorney.” As examples of circumstances, ‘in ‘which such. declination, would be
appropriate, the Ashcroft. Memo cités to, situations in which a U.S. Attorney’s Office: is
“particularly: over-burdened,” ‘the: trial. is. expected. to: be of exceptionally long duration, and
proceeding to trial would. significantly reduce the: total. number of cases the office could resolve.
The Ashcroft. Memo specifically notes that. “[cJharges ‘may be declined . . . pursuant. to.a, plea.
agreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established, by the Memo.

On January 28, 2005, Deputy. Attorney: General James: Comey; issued. a memorandum.

entitled. “Department Policies and Procedures Conceming Sentencing.” That. memorandum,
provable offenses,” wind defined that term: as the offenses that would’ “generate the mostsubstantial
sentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any’
statutorily required consecutive sentence.

Importantly, although the Ashcroft and ‘Comey memoranda. limit an individual, line:
prosccutor’s. ability to decline “readily provable” charges in'thcir entirety, no such ‘restriction is
placed ‘upon. the U.S. Attorneys, who retained Ocha to approve: exceptions to > the pole. In

198 The; Ashcroft'Memo' was:issued before the Supreme Gourt decided. Giited States v: Booker, 543 U.S. 220
(2005), which struck.down the provision-of the:federal sentencing statute that:required federal districtjudges to impose
a sentence within the. applicable. Federal. Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were:'the product of:
the United, States Sentencing ‘Commission, which was -created ‘by ‘the Sentencing Reform: Act of 1984. The
Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to’ End-the’ Exploitation. of Children. Today (PROTECT) Act of 2003, Pub.
L.108-21, 117 Stat. 650, was directed at prev enting child abuse. It included. a variety of provisions designed. to
improve: the iny estigation. and prosecution: of violent‘crimes:against.children. Among other thingsythe PROTECT Act:
prov ided for specific: sentencing ‘considerations for certain. sex-related offenses, such. as ‘those. involving multiple
oceasions of prohibited ‘sexual conduct or ‘those involving ‘material with depictions of violence, or with, specified
numbers:of images.
