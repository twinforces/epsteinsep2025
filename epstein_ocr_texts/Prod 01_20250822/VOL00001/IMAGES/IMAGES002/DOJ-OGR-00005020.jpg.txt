The government’s objection is, in substance, a motion to reconsider. “There is ‘no
specific rule, either in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or in this district’s local criminal
rules that provide for reconsideration of a ruling in a criminal matter.’” United States v.
Okparaeke, No. 17-CR-225 (NSR), 2019 WL 4233427, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 6, 2019) (quoting
United States v. Cartagena, No. 10 Cr. 222-2, 2012 WL 2958175, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. July 20,
2012)). Even so, courts have discretion to reconsider prior rulings in criminal cases when the
moving party can point to “controlling law or factual matters which it believes the court
overlooked and that might reasonably be expected to alter the court’s decision.” United States v.
Berger, 188 F. Supp. 2d 307, 328-39 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).

But “[t]he standard for granting a motion for reconsideration ‘is strict.’” Farmer v.
United States, No. 12-CR-758/15-cv-6287 (AJN), 2017 WL 3448014, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 10,
2017) (quoting Analytical Surveys, Inc. v. Tonga Partners, L.P., 684 F.3d 36, 52 (2d Cir. 2012)).
That’s because “[r]econsideration of a court’s previous order is an ‘extraordinary remedy to be
employed in the interests of finality and conservation of scarce judicial resources.’” Montanile v.
Nat’l Broad. Co., 216 F. Supp. 2d 341, 342 (S.D.N.Y. 2002).

The government cannot show extraordinary circumstances here. The government twice
had notice of Ms. Maxwell’s request for disclosure, and the government twice chose not to
object. The government cannot use a motion to reconsider to save itself from the consequences
of its deliberate decisions. “[A] losing party” is not permitted to “examin[e] a decision and then
plug[] in the gaps of a lost motion with additional matters.” Berger, 188 F. Supp. 2d at 339.
Because that is exactly what the government is attempting to do, this Court should deny the
government’s request. Ms. Maxwell is entitled to the disclosure this Court ordered.
