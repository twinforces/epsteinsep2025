Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293 _ Filed 05/25/21 Page 10 of 32
(Dkt. 207 at 6 (quoting NPA)). The Court has further concluded that the NPA’s co-conspirator
provision covers “any involvement of [Ms.] Maxwell” in any of these same three categories of
offenses. (/d. at 7). There can be no serious dispute that the sex trafficking offenses charged in
Counts Five and Six were investigated as part of the Florida Investigation and fall squarely
within the three categories of immunized offenses that are covered by the NPA. Moreover,
because Counts Five and Six are based on the exact same allegations from the very same accuser
that were previously investigated and presented to the grand jury as part of the Florida
Investigation, Annabi and its progeny do not apply and the NPA is binding on the USAO-SDNY
as to these offenses. Accordingly, Counts Five and Six must be dismissed. Moreover, because
Counts One and Three incorporate the same conduct from Counts Five and Six for which Ms.
Maxwell cannot be prosecuted under the NPA, they must also be dismissed.

A. Counts Five and Six Allege the Same Offenses that Were Part of the Florida

Investigation and Are Covered by the Plain Terms of the NPA.

The plain terms of the NPA preclude Ms. Maxwell’s prosecution on Counts Five and Six
because they allege conduct that falls within the date range specified in the NPA and charge
specifically enumerated offenses that were part of the Florida Investigation. Count Five alleges
that “[f]rom at least in or about 2001 up to and including in or about 2004,” Ms. Maxwell
conspired with Epstein to violate 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a), the law prohibiting sex trafficking of
minors. (S2 Indictment {J 22-25). Count Six alleges that during the same time period, Ms.
Maxwell committed a substantive violation of the same statute. (/d. J] 26-27). The NPA bars
prosecution for Ms. Maxwell’s involvement in “any offenses that may have been committed by
Epstein against the United States from in or around 2001 through in or around September 2007
including five enumerated offenses.” (Dkt. 207 at 6 (internal quotations omitted); see also id. at
