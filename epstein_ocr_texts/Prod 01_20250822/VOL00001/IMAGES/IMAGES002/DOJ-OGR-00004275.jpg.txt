(Dkt. 207 at.6 (quoting NPA)). The Court/has further concluded that the NPA’s co-conspirator
provision.covers “any involvement.of [Ms.].Maxwell” in any of these same-three. categories of
offenses. (/d..at'7). There can.be no serious dispute:that:the sex:trafficking; offenses. charged in
Counts Five and Six were investigated as part of the Florida. Investigation and. fall squarely
within the three categoriés of immunized-offenses;that are, covered by the NPA. Moréover,
because Counts Five and Six: are based on. the exact same allegations from.the very same accuser
that were’ previously investigated,and presented'to the grand jury as part: of the Florida
Investigation, Annabi and its;progeny do not apply and the NPA is binding on the, USAO-SDNY
as to these offenses. Accordingly, Counts Five and Six must be dismissed. Moreover, because
Counts One,and Three incorporate the same. conduct from, Counts Five and Six for which Ms..
Maxwell, cannot be-prosecuted under the NPA, they must also be dismissed.

minors. (S2 Indictment [4] 22-25). Count Six alleges that during the same time period, MS.
Maxwell, committed a, substantive violation of the same statute. (/d. [4 26-27). The NPA. bars
prosecution for Ms., Maxwell's involvement in “any offenses that may have been committed. by.
Epstein.against the United States from in or around 2001 through in.or. around September 2007
