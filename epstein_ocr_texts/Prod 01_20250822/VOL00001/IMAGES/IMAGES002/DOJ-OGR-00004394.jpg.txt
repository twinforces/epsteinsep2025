evidence of.a violation, of the agreement. ‘Epstcin and. his counscl
agree'that. the computers that are:currently under [legalprocess] will
be safeguarded in their current condition by’ Epstcin’s counsel or
their agents until the terms. and conditions. of the Agreement are
fulfilled.

Later that: day, Villafana-sent Lefkowitz a.lengthy email to convey two options, Couric had.
suggested: “the original proposal” for,a:state plea but with.an agreement for‘an.18-month sentence,
or. pleas, to state, charges, and. two. federal obstruction-of-justice charges. ‘Villafafia also told.
Lefkowitz she was: willing to ask Acosta again.to approve:a federal plea to.a five-ycar conspiracy
with a Rule: 1:1(c) binding recommendation for:a. 20-month sentence. Villafafia. explained:

As to timing, it‘is my’ understanding that Mr. Epstcin nceds to be
sentenced in the state. after He is sentenced .in thé federal. casé, but
not that. he needs to plead guilty and be sentenced after serving his
fedcral,time. Andy:recommended that some of the timing issucs’be
addressed, only in the state agreement, so that it isn’t obvious to the
judge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction, for prison
purposes.

With regard.to: prosecution, of individuals other than Epstein, Villafafia. suggested standard.
federal plea agreement, language regarding the’ resolution, of <all criminal, liability, “and. 1 will
mention “co-conspirators,” but; | ;would:prefer not to highlight for the judge’ all of the other crimes
and all of the other persons ‘that we could charge.” Villafana’told OPR that, she was. willing to
include a non-prosccution. provision. for Epstcin’s co-conspirators, who at:the time she understood
to be the four women-named in the: ‘proposed agreement, because the‘ USAO was not interested in.
‘prosecuting those individuals if Epstein entered, a plea. Villafafia. told. OPR, “[WJec considered.
Epstcin.to be the top of the food chain, and we:wouldn’t have been interested.in ‘prosecuting anyone
else.” She did not: consider the possibility that. Epstcin mrght be trying to protect other; unnamed
individuals, and iio one, including the EBI case agents, raised that conecrn. Villafana, also told.
‘OPR that her reference to“all of the other-crimes and all of the other persons that we:could.charge”
related to her concern, that if the plea agreement contained information about uncharged. conduct,
the court. might. ask for more information about that conduct and. inquire why it had not been,
charged, and if the, government: provided such. information, Epstcin’s attorneys might. claim, the
agreement was breached. |

With regard.to immigration, Villafafia told OPR thatthe’ USAO generally did:not take any:
position in plea agreements on immigration,issues, and.that.in-this casc, there was.no evidence that.
cither of the: two assistants ‘who were forcign nationals had committed fraud in connection. with,
theit immigration paperwork, “and I think thatthcy were both:in status. So:there/wasn’t'any reason,

IS OPR understood Villafafia’s:concern to be that if the: governmentivere: required to: respond. to-a'court’s inquiry

into: additional facts,. Epstein would-object’that the; government was’trying:to cast him.in a negative light insorder, to
influence the court to impose a sentence greater than the agreed-upon term.
