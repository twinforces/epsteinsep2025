or another substantive constitutional provision, supplies a standard, for the suppression of
evidence, courts must follow that standard, not. invent their own. See Pavner, 447 US. at. 735.

Maxwell. has not established.a violation. of due process or. justified the exercise of the
Court’s inherent; supervisory authority:. Not-cvery misstep by the Government during ‘a, criminal,
investigation justifies suppressing relevant cviderice. The Supreme Court has. repeatedly
‘explained that the exclusionary rule weighs the interest in deterring investigatory misconduct
against. the truth-secking function. of the judicial process. That balance “do[es] not.change:
‘because a court has elected:to analyze the. question-under the supervisory: power instead of’ some
other constitutional provision. Jd. at'736. Due process provides an independent basis to suppress
evidence only when. the Government, engages in conduct that is “fundamentally unfair or
shocking to our‘traditional scnsc of justicc”.or is “so outragcous that common notions of fairness
and decency would be offended were judicial processes invoked:to obtain a conviction against:
the accused.” United States v. Schmidt, 105 F.3d.82, 91 (2d Cir. :1997) (internal, quotation marks,
omitted). “Ordinarily:such, official misconduct.must involve cither coercion,or violation of the
defendant’s person.” /d.\(citations omitted). This,case involves, neither. Omitting information
about communications with BSF ycars:carlicr falls well. short ofthe. sort of extreme misconduct.
supporting suppression as.a, matter of duc process.

To the extent.Maxwell asks'the Court'to engage in.a freéwhecling exercise of its inherent.
supervisory power instead, the Court declines to.do so. To begin. with, suppression. under a.
courts supervisory authority is only appropriate, if.at-all, when the Government has engaged in,
“willful disobedience, of law.” Payner, 447 U.S. at 735 1.7 (emphasis added). Maxwell all but
‘concedes that’the present.record does not.show willful:misconduct, contending instcad that it

“doesn’t matter” whether the prosccutor knew his ‘statements to Judge McMahon were:
