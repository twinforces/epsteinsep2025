involved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman, then. dirccted her to have the ‘case:
agents make the victim,notifications.

Accordingly, Villafana directed the case agents to “mect with the victims to provide them.
with information-regarding the'terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion-of the federal.investigation.”
The case agent told OPR, “[T]here was a. discussion that Maric and | had as
to... how we would tell:them, and-what.we would.tell them, and what:that. was | don’t recall, but:
itv was, the terms of the agreement. ” Villafatia, believed, that: if “victims ‘were ‘properly notified of
the terms [ofthe NPA] that applicd:to them, regarding their, right to seck damages. from. [Epstein],
and he paid those: damages, that. the rest | of the [NPA] doesn’ t need to: be: disclosed. ” Villafaiia
change of: plea [hearing], but that. date: had. not yet been: set by state authorities at, the 1 time the first.
victims were notified. [by. the FBI].” Villafafia, told OPR. that it: was her: belief that because’ the
USAO had. agreed toa confidentiality clause, the government could not: disclose the NPA ‘to the:
general public, but victims could be informed. “because. by its: terms they: needed. to. be told. what.
the agreement was about.” Villafafia told. OPR-that: no one in-her. supervisory chain. expressed. a
concern. that if victims learned of'the’NPA, they-would.try to prevent Epstein.from entering a plea.

Within a-week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that. vc ‘partics had
reached a deal to resolve the: Epstein case. For example, on. October 1, 2007, the:
New York Post reported. that. Epstein “has. agreed fo’ plead guilty to soliciting underage prostitutes
at his Florida mansion. in.a.deal, that will ‘send him. to prison, for about I'8 months,” ‘and. noted. that.
Epstein would plead. guilty in state court and that “the: feds have agreed to.drop their probe into
possible federal criminal,violations. in.cxchange for the guilty*plea.to, the new state charge. 23301

The case agent recalled informing'some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and.
“we would.not be pursuing’ this federally.” In.October 2007, for example, the, case agents met with.
victim. Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosccution Agreement.”
According to thé cas¢ agent, during that mecting, the case-agents told Wild “that.an agreement had
been. reached, Mr. Epstein. was going to plead guilty to two state: charges, and. there would not be
a. federal, prosceution.”*"" However, :in a. declaration filed. in 2015 in, the .CVRA litigation, Wild.
described ‘the conversation, differently:

[T]he agents. cxplained ‘that-Epstcin. was also being charged:in State
court and.:may plea [sic] to:state charges 1 related to some of his other
