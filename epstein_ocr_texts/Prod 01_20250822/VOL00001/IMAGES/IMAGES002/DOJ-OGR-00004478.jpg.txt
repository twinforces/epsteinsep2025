Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 181 of 349

Menchel told OPR. that when, he and Sanchez were in the USAO, they had. a social
relationship, which.ineluded, in 2003, “a,handful of dates ov.cr’a.period of two to'three weeks. We
decided that . ... this ‘was probably’ best. not to pursuc, and we mutually agreed to not-do that.”?"°
Apait from. that, he stated they°were “close” and “hung. out,” atid he asserted that this'‘was known.
‘in the office at the time. Menchel said.:that-his: ‘relationship’ ‘with Sanchez “changed dramatically”
when she left:the-office for private: practice, and that by: the time he‘became involved in,the Epstein,
‘investigation, he‘had dated and married his wife, and his contact'with Sanchez would “most likely”
have been at office events and when she attended his wedding.**” Menchel added, “[T]hat was
three and. a half years [prior] for.a'very bricf-period of time, and.I don’t think I gave ita moment’s
thought.”

When. asked. by OPR about the basis. for the decision to‘make an offer of a two-year term
of incarecration, Menchcl said that. he did. not: recall discussions about the two-ycar offer'and did.
not recall how the office arrived at that figure. In:response to OPR’s question, Menchel stated that.
his relationship with Sanchez did “[nJot at-all” affect his handling of the Epstein case. Morcover,
Menchel. asserted that the contemporancous documentary record. supports a.conclusion that it was
Acosta, not Menchel, who made’the decision to resolve the case with the’two-year term.

OPR carefully considéred.the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements
to OPR :from Menchcel, 'Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta, and. concludes that there is:no evidence
supporting the suggestion. that the plea was instigated by Menchel.as.a. favor to defense counsel.
The USAO’s first ‘plea overture to defense counsel, which, took: place sometime before June’ 26,
2007, occurred, when ‘Menchel.'spoke with. Sanchez about the: possibility of resolving the federal
case with. a, state plea. that required jail time and scxual offender registration. According to the
email, “[i]t was a :non-starter” for'the. defense. In. the lengthy email exchange with, Villafama. in.
carly July‘2007, Menchcl.told her that. his discussion with Sanchez about a state-based resolution.
‘was made. with Acosta’s “full. .knowledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling: OPR, that:
although, he, did not remember:a. specific. conversation with, Menchel. concerning, a state-based.
resolution, he:-was certain Menchel would not-have discussed this potential resolution'with defense
counsel. “without having discussed it with me.?°"* Moreover, the defense did not immediately:
