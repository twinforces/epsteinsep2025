Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 98 of 239
Bank, of course, as noted above, the subpoena recipient produced materials to a prosecutor in
direct violation of the relevant protective order, without seeking a modification of the protective
order and without any court authorization to do so. 154 F.R.D. at 93. Moreover, in that case, the
District Attorney seemingly opened its investigation and issued the subpoena in direct response to
information provided by the subpoena recipient who was then a party to civil litigation. /d.

The Government responded to Chief Judge McMahon by explaining its contacts with Boies
Schiller in connection with the instant (and only) investigation it had opened on Epstein, that is,
the investigation prompted by, and opened following, public reporting on Epstein in November
2018. In particular, the Government explained that the USAO-SDNY opened an investigation
first, on either November 30, 2018 or December 3, 2018, and then made contact with Boies Schiller
shortly thereafter. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. E at 2-3). In this respect, the Government further explained
that the USAO-SDNY, after opening the investigation, had endeavored to identify counsel who
represented victims or witnesses in public filings or media reports, which included Boies Schiller,
noting that “[w]ith respect to Boies Schiller in particular, we quickly came to learn during the
investigation that they had at the time either active or recently completed civil litigation” and
indicated that the USAO-SDNY intended to make document requests. (/d.). The Government
also noted that, unlike in Chemical Bank, here Boies Schiller had informed the Government that it
would be unable to comply with the subpoena in light of the protective order. (/d. (noting that
Boies Schiller “generally advised us that they believed there was a protective order that would
govern at least some of the materials, and that is why we ultimately made the application to the
Court.”)).
