Il. APPLICABLE. STANDARDS OF CONDUCT
A. The United States Attorneys’ Manual

Among its many ‘provisions, the United. States Attorneys? Manual (USAM) includes
gencral statements of principles that summarize. appropriate considerations. to. be weighed, and.
desirable practices to be followed, by: federal prosceutors when discharging, their prosecutorial
responsibilitics.'*" The goal of the USAM is to promote “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial.
authority. and contribute to the fair, evenhanded administration, of the Federal criminal laws,” and.
to promote public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions will be made “rationally and
objectively‘on the:merits of'cach case.” USAM §-9-27.001. .

Because the USAM is designed. to assist in structuring’ the decision-making ''process, of
government. attorneys, many: of its, principles arc cast. in gencral terms, with a, view’ to providing:
guidance rather than:mandating results. //.5 see also USAM § 9-27.120, comment (“It is. expected
that cach Federal prosccutor will be g guided by: ‘these:principles:in carrying out. his/her criminal law:
enforcement responsibilities ... . However, it is not intended.that reference'to these principles will
require a, particular prosecutorial decision i in any given casc.”); USAM § 9-27.110, comment.
(“Under the Federal criminal justice system, the prosccutor has'wide latitude in.determining when,
whom, how, and. ¢ven. whether to prosécute: for apparent’ violations. of Federal criminal law.”).
However, USAM. § .9-27.130 provides that AUSAs who depart from the principles of federal
prosccution articulated in. the USAM may’be subject to.internal ‘discipline. In.particular, USAM
§ 9-27.130 states that. cach'U.S. Attorney should establish internal office’ procedures to ensure that.
proseeutorial decisions a are, e made at; an appropriate level. of responsibility: and are consistent, it wath,
set forth i in. the USAM are followed by fornediall action, including the imposition. of disciplinary
sanctions when warranted. and ‘deemed appropriate.

U.S. Attorneys have “plenary authority’ with, regard, to federal criminal, matters” ‘and may.
modify or depart from the principles sct forth in the USAM as decmed.necessary'in'the interest of
fair atid. cffective law cnforcement' Within. their:individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.001,
9.27-140. Thc USAM provisions are supplemented. by: the: Department’s Criminal Resource
Manual, which provides additional guidance relating. to. the conduct of federal, criminal
prosecutions.

1. USAM Provisions Relating to the Initiation. and Declination of a.
Federal Prosecution

Federal prosecutors do not-open a case on every matter'referred’to them. USAM § 9-2.020
explicitly authorizes a U.S. Attorney “to decline ‘prosecution in. any. case referred directly to

189. In.2018, the USAM was:revised and:reissued.as the Justice Manual. ‘In. assessing the subjects* conduct, OPR.
relies upon: the standards of conduct in effectiat:the time of the events in issue. Accordingly; unless-otherwise noted,
citations in.this Report are;to the; 1997. edition of the USAM, as:revised throughJanuary. 2007.
