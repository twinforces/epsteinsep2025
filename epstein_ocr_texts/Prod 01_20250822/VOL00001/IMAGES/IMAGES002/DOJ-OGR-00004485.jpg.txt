proof that this led to the breakfast meeting, email exchanges between Lefkowitz and Acosta show
that it was under discussion at the time they were scheduling the meeting. Shortly after the
breakfast meeting, Sloman, in Miami, sent an email to Lefkowitz (copying Acosta and Villafajia),
noting that he “just got off the phone with Alex” and offering a slightly revised portion of the
addendum relating to the mechanism for selection of the attorney representative. Sloman later
clarified for Villafafia that “Jay’s suggested revision has been rejected.”

A second area of continuing negotiation arose from the defense claim that Epstein’s
obligation under the NPA to pay the attorney representative’s fees did not obligate him to pay the
fees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Although this was at odds with the USAO’s
interpretation of the provision, the USAO and defense counsel reached agreement and clarified the
provision in the NPA addendum that was finalized several weeks after the October breakfast
meeting. Although the revised provision was to Epstein’s advantage, the revision concerned
attorney’s fees and did not materially impede the victims’ ability to seek damages from Epstein
under § 2255. The fact that the negotiations continued after the breakfast meeting indicates that
Acosta did not make promises at the meeting that resolved the issue.

OPR found limited contemporaneous evidence concerning the discussion between Acosta
and Lefkowitz. In a letter sent to Acosta on October 23, 2007, two weeks after the breakfast
meeting, Lefkowitz represented that Acosta made three significant concessions during the meeting.
Specifically, Lefkowitz claimed that Acosta had agreed (1) not to intervene with the State
Attorney’s Office’s handling of the case, (2) not to contact any of the victim-witnesses or their
counsel, and (3) not to intervene regarding the sentence Epstein received. Acosta told OPR that
he did not remember the breakfast meeting and did not recall making the commitments defense
counsel attributed to him. Acosta also told OPR that Lefkowitz was not a reliable narrator of
events, and on several occasions in written communications had inaccurately and misleadingly
characterized conversations he had with Acosta.

Of more significance for OPR’s evaluation was a contemporaneous document—an
October 25, 2007 draft response to Lefkowitz’s letter, which Sloman drafted, and Acosta reviewed
and edited for signature by Sloman—that disputed Lefkowitz’s claims. The draft letter stated:

I specifically want to clarify one of the items that I believe was
inaccurate in that October 23rd letter. Your letter claimed that this
Office
would not intervene with the State Attorney’s Office
regarding this matter; or contact any of the identified
individuals, potential witnesses, or potential civil
claimants and their respective counsel in this matter;
and neither your Office nor the [FBI] would
intervene regarding the sentence Mr. Epstein
receives pursuant to a plea with the State, so long as
that sentence does not violate state law.

As we discussed and, hopefully, clarified, and as the United States
Attorney previously explained in an earlier conference call, such a
