Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 389 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page7ofi1

Second, any evidence of alleged false statements, whether it is introduced as direct
evidence of the perjury counts or as evidence of a purported effort to “conceal” the other crimes
charged in the superseding indictment, would substantially prejudice Ms. Maxwell and would
jeopardize her right to a fair trial for the same reasons the Court identified in its severance ruling.
Allowing the jury to consider evidence related to the perjury counts “would introduce unrelated
allegations of sexual abuse, which would potentially expose the jury to evidence that might
otherwise not be admissible . . . [and] to a wider swath of information regarding civil litigation
against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct.” /d. at 24. This would present
“a significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find
guilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so.” Jd. Further, allowing the introduction
of this evidence would “likely to require disqualification of at least one of Maxwell’s attorneys
from participating as an advocate on her behalf,” which would “implicate[] [Ms.] Maxwell’s
Sixth Amendment right to be represented by the counsel of her choice” and would significantly
prejudice her right to a fair trial. /d. at 24-25. Introducing evidence related to the perjury counts
as evidence of alleged concealment, or for any purpose, would present these same problems and
should not be allowed.

Third, as the Court recognized in its prior ruling, fully litigating the perjury charges—
which would be necessary if the government were allowed to introduce the allegedly false
deposition statements to show concealment—would result in a distracting and time-intensive
side-show at trial that will confuse the jury with legal and factual issues that are far afield from
the “narrower issues” that pertain to the other charged offenses. /d. at 25-26. This would
frustrate the goal of a fair and efficient trial on the remaining charges. /d. at 26. For the same
reasons, whatever probative value (if any) this evidence may have related to the other charged
