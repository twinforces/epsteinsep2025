prosecution, not.the Double: Jeopardy Clause. .And, as described. above, the NPA presents no
barrier. Accordingly, the defendant’s, motion to dismiss Counts Five and, Six ‘should. be denied.
TH. Counts Five and Six Are Timely

Counts Five and Six, are timely’ charged because the applicable limitations ‘period, 18
U'S.G. § 3283: (2003), permits prosecution for-offenses, “involving the’ sexual or:physical abuse. . .
of a-child” at any time “during the life of the:child,” and the victim. identified in Counts Five and
Six of the ‘$2 Indictment.remains alive. The-crimes alleged:in, Counts Five and Six’plainly involved.
the séxual. abuse of minors, meaning the § 3283, limitations ‘period applics to both charges. See S2
Indictment 4 9(d) (discussing the sexual. abuse of Minor Victim-4).

*'In her previous motions, the defendant argued that. Counts,One through Four were ‘untimely,
claiming that.§ 3283. cantiot be applied retroactively. The Court:rejectéd this argument. (Apr. Op.
at 13-16 (analyzing the applicability of § 3283: to: pre-2003 conduct under Landgraf'v. UST Film
Products, 51.1. US. 244, 280. (1.994))). In ‘her ‘current: motion, the:defendant docs not appear to
assert retroactivity arguments with respect to Counts Five:and Six.. Nor could she. Because:Counts
Five.and Six involve conduct up to and ‘including 2004, application, of the: 2003 amendment: to
§ 3283. does not:require the Court to engage in a retroactivity analysis.
