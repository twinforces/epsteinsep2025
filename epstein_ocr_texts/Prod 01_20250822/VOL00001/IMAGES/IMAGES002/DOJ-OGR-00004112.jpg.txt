Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s Order dated
May 3, 2021, which directed the parties to meet and confer and jointly propose a trial start date.
(Dkt. No. 266). The parties have met and conferred in accordance with the Order. Although both
parties seek a trial date in November, the parties have not reached agreement on the particular start
date in that month.

The Government respectfully requests that the trial start on November 29, 2021. The
Government understands that the earliest defense counsel can begin the trial is November 8, 2021
and that is defense counsel’s preferred trial start date. Defense counsel has indicated that it would
consider starting on November 15, 2021 as an accommodation to the Government, but no later.
Defense counsel has informed the Government that they are available through the end of 2021.!

' Defense counsel has informed the Government that one of the defendant’s attorneys has a civil
trial scheduled for December 13, 2021, but indicated that the attorney will request that the trial
date be moved.
