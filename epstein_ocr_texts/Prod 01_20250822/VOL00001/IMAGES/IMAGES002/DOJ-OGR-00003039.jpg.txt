At'the same time, in.Martindell, the: court noted that “[t]he reliance of a private party: upon.
protection of pre-existing documents from.disclosure to'the Government; would normally be more
difficult to justify than that of a ‘witness. who would, absent the protective order, have invoked his
privilege and given no testimony at.all.” Jd. at 297 n.8; see:also United States v. Davis, 702 F.2d.
418, 422-23 (2d Cir. 1.983) (finding Martindell inapplicable and affirming enforcement of.a. grand.

violations of the criminal law; and to effectuate: such investigations it may compcl.the production.
of documentary cvidenee or ‘the testimony of witnesses, as it deems necessary.” Jd. at’ 421-22
(citing Witited States 2. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 343 (1974)). “Wide latitude in gathering evidence
