Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document206 Filed 04/16/21 Page 8.of 22

As'Ms. Maxwell’s opening:memorandum (“Mem.”) has. demonstrated, proper application.
of Landgraf prohibits-retroactive application of the 2003 Amendment. Congressional intent
could not be:clearer; Gongress. considered.and expressly rejected.a provision that would have:

retroactively.” ‘Senator Léahy, Ambér Législation, Cong. Rec. 149:50, $5147 (2003). The Gourt
need look no further, Such an unambiguous expression of congressional intent establishes
conclusively‘that the,2003 Amendment is, not retroactive:

The government argues that. Congress” ‘explicit rejection ofa retroactivity provision. is not
probative, because according'to Senator Leahy’s floor, statement, the decision; was grounded in,
