outside the sentencing and immigration context :in which, the “necessarily entails” approach has
been:rejected, it. fails to offer any. ” Nor does the. government respond to: the case law cited by’
Ms. Maxwell in-which:courts have: interpreted “offense involving” language in.a venue statute,
which has nothing ‘to do with sentencing, immigration, or prior convictions, to refer'to the
élements ofthe offense. See, 6.¢., United States v.. Morgan, 393 F.3d 192, 198 (D.C. Cir. 2004)
(“The most natural reading of § 3237(a) J 2. is to construe ‘any offense involving’ by reference to
the e/ements of the offense. at. issue.”) (emphasis in. original); United States ‘y. Avo, 801,F. Supp.
2d 1323, 1331 (S.D. Ala. 201.1) (“The Eleventh, Circuit has employed the second paragraph of
charged.”). The arbitrary limitations the government seeks to impose on the “necessarily entails”
approach. simply do not.exist.

The Supreme Court’s opinion in Nijhawan v. Holder; 557 U.S. 29 (2009)—the only

provision at-issue referred to “an,offense that .. . involves fraud or deceit. im which the loss to the
victint oF victims exceeds $10;000°" S57 U.S. at 32 (quoting 8: U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i))
(emphasis added.by:Court). The issue’before the Court was not whether the statute required
“fraud or deceit” to be.an element.of the underlying offense, but whether'the referenced
monetary threshold was required to be: an element. The Gourt held that it was not, reasoning that

“[t]he words ‘in which’ (which:modify ‘offense”) can.refer to the conduct involved ‘in’ the

” According:to the government, the ostensible rationale :for, the“necessarily entails” approach—avoiding the need
for courts'to examine the: facts of:prior convictions—is not:present in-the § 3283; context: But a:fact-based approach
poses a different practical obstacle:in the:statute-of limitations context: Under‘a fact-based.approach here, for.
example, .in order to-obtain the: benefit of the:expanded limitations period, the government would. be:required to:
prove:conduct (i.¢., sexualabuse) thatis not an’element of an offense: a jury would be required to find not only that:
Ms. Maxwell committed the:offenses with which she is charged but.also that-her‘offenses “involve|| ... the sexual
or physical:abuse .. ofa child”; and only-after‘the jury: has returned its verdict would it be-known which. statutciof
limitations—$: 3283 ‘or the default: provision.under $ (3282—applies to‘this prosecution.
