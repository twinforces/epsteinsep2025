based on the allegedly exculpatory. information. that. it contains (because she already. has. ‘that.

potential impeachment material goes beyond. the ‘permissible bounds, of a Rule 1'7 subpoena. See:
Nixon, 418 U.S. at 701. (Generally, the need for evidence to impeach witnesses is insufficient to
require its production in advanec of trial.”). And if the Defendant does not seck the: remainder of
thie journal passages for impeachment; she does not-explain how'they would otherwise be: relevant:
and admissible: at: trial. The Court should not: require: production of the entire journal—which
contains personal, private information about Ms. Farmer when she was a minor—if Defendant, is
unable to derionstrate that’ the overbroad Request micets the relevance and. admissibility

Civil Procédure than under Rule. 17(¢), courts have refused to, order disclosure of an. entire. diary’
‘or,journal when the: journal. contains personal or sensitive entries. and the party secking disclosure
‘cannot. demonstrate that anything relevant has been withheld. See, e.g. , Dubay 'y:, King, No. 3:17-
