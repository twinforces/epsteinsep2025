for the court's cvaluation, ‘merely going through the form of obtaining jurors’ assurances of
‘impartiality: is insufficient [to test that.impartiality]”) (citation. omitted).

Reséarch indicates that expansive voir dire yields greater revelations of juror bias; and in-depth

attorney-conducted voir dire combined with individual. sequestered. voir dire clicits greater
