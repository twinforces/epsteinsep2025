To increase the likelihood that any hidden prejudices of the jurors will be uncovered, to
accomplish the goal of exercising sensitive and intelligent peremptory challenges, and to ensure
that a fair and impartial jury is empaneled in this case, counsel should be given an opportunity to
individually examine prospective jurors.

Individual sequestered voir dire conducted jointly by counsel and the Court has a variety
of benefits. It invites a conversation rather than posing an interrogation. It eliminates the pressure
on jurors to provide socially desirable or acceptable answers in a group setting, reduces
conformity pressures that can diminish candor, and removes the risk of other jurors being
influenced by statements made during group voir dire that enable them to either stay on the jury
or be removed for cause. It increases juror comfort, minimizes the anxiety of public speaking,
encourages candor, and promotes honesty.

Furthermore, questioning conducted exclusively by the Court further hampers the ability
to uncover important information about jurors because it places jurors in a subordinate position

between the humble layperson and the honorable judicial officer exalted high above the venire.
Research indicates that expansive voir dire yields greater revelations of juror bias;? and in-depth
attorney-conducted voir dire combined with individual sequestered voir dire elicits greater
