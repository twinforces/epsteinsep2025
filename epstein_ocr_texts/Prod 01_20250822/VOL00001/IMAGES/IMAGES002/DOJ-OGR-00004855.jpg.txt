agreed with the trial court’s statement that the significance of the age of a prior bad act is
“inversely proportional” tothe. similarity between the prior bad act and the facts underlying
the charged offense. /d. (quoting Commonwealth v: Aikens, 990 A.2d 1181, 1185 (Pa.
Super. 2010)). Although the panel recognized the significant lag in time between the
events in question, it relied upon the similarities as found by’ the trial court to conclude

argument that Cosby's familiarity with Quaaludes was. suggestive of his mens rea,
inasmuch as it was “highly probative of ‘the circumstances known to him for purposes of
determining whether he acted with the requisite mens rea for the offense of aggravated
indecent assault—recklessness.” /d. (quoting Pa.R.E. 404(b)(2)). Moreover, Cosby’s
