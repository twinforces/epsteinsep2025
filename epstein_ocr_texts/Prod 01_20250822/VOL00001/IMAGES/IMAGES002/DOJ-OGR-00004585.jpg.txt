I, LETTERS SENT TO VICTIMS. BY THE FBI WERE NOT.-FALSE STATEMENTS

BUT RISKED MISLEADING VICTIMS ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE
FEDERAL INVESTIGATION

After the NPA was signed on September 24, 2007,, Villafafia, and,'the FBI separately.
communicated, with, numerous. victims and. victims?’ attorneys; both in. person and through letters.
Apait ‘from three victims who likely: were informed. in October or November 2007 about a.
resolution ending'the federal investigation, victims were:not informed about the NPA or even more
generally that the USAO had. agreed to end its federal, criminal investigation of Epstein if he pled.
guilty to state charges ‘until after Epstcim entered his guilty plea, in June: 2008. ‘Despite. the
government’s agreement on September 24, 2007, to end. its federal investigation upon Epstcin’s
compliance ‘with the terms of the NPA, the EBI sent'to Victims in October 2007, January’ 2008, aiid
May 2008, letters stating that the: case was “currently under investigation.” Tn ‘its. February 21,
believe that federal prosecution was still.a possibility” and that “i]t w was a “material omission. for
the Government to suggest:-to the victims that/they have paticnce relative to an investigation about.
which it had. already bound itself not.to, prosecute.?4"”

In, the discussions throughout this: section, OPR, examines the goyernment’s course: of
conduct: with victims after the NPA was signed. As sct forth in the’previous subsection, OPR did
not find evidence supporting a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia acted ‘with the intent to
silencé victims. Norictheless, after examining the full scope and context of the government’s
intcractions'with victims, OPR -concludes:that the government’s inconsistent:messages concerning:
the federal investigation led to victims fecling, confused and jill-treated by the government.

In.this section, OPR examines ‘and discusses lctters sent-to'victims by the FBI that were the
subject.of the district, court’s ‘findings. OPR:found, no évidence that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafafia.
was aware ofthe content of the letters until.the USAO reccived them from.the FBI for production.
for the CVRA litigation. OPR. determined that the January .1.0, 2008 and. May 30, 2008 Ictters that
the district court determined-to be misleading, : as well.as the October 1:2, 2007 Ictter OPR located.
during its investigation, were “standard form letter[s]” sent by the FBL’s Victim, Specialist. As
noted. previously'in. this Report, after the NPA was signed, Villafafa and'the FBI agents continucd.,
to conduct. their investigation in anticipation that Epstein would breach the NPA; absent such. 4.

408 Villatafia; ‘told OPR-that she recalled speaking to several victims along with, FBI agents’before the NPA. was
signed and. “ask[ing] them-how they-wanted the case to be resolved." EBI interview reports indicate that; Villafafia,
waspresent with,FBI agents for, some ofthe interviews occurring well:in advance of the NPA negotiations. See. 2005
Guidelines, Art: IV. 1°B.2.¢ qd) (consultations may be Jimited-to gathering ‘information, from victims and conveying
only. nonsensitive data and public information). ‘However, Villafafia did not meet:with all.of the victims;identified in,
the federal inv estigation, including-the EVRA litigation, petitioners, and the, government conceded during the EVRA,
litigation, that:it: entered into:the NPA without conferring with the’ petitioners. Doe; 359.F. Supp. 3d at i218.
