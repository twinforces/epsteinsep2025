Re:  United.States-v. Ghislaine. Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (ASN)
Rule 1.7 Subpoena to Boies Schiller Flexner LLP

Dear Judge Nathan:

Twrite on-bchalftof Boies Schiller Flexner LLP (“BSF”) in further support of its.objections
Rule 17(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure (the “Subpoena”).! As the Defendant’s
response: makes clear, she secks. to serve a-Rule 17 subpoena on BSF because she is dissatisfied.
with the Government’s discovery efforts thus far. Thus, she is using’ Rule I'7 to.attempt. to obtain.
discovery that she has becn unable to obtain. from the Government under Rule 16 and Brady,
including discovery that is subject to.a pending motion before the Court. This is an.improper‘use:
of a. Rule 17 subpoena. If the: Defendant: believes, that the Government has not fulfilled its
discovery: obligations: under Rule 16, Brady, or Giglio, she: must. address that issue with the
Government and. the Court rather than serving overbroad. and burdensome subpoenas on third

partics. And ifthe Defendant.is not.entitled’to the discovery she secks ‘from the Government, then

\ The Defendant:refers to‘BSF’s objections as a “motion to quash,” but.the Court has not-yet'

granted Defendant’s, motion ‘to authorize the Subpoena to BSF. -BSF ‘thus requests that the
Defendant’s motion to authorize the Subpoena be: denied.
