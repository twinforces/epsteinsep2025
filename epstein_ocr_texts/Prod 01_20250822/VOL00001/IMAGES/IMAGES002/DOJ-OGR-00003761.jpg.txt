II. The Government Failed to Meet its Burden of Establishing the Two Alleged
Conspiracies Are Distinct:

To guard against the “well recognized danger” that prosecutors can casily “draft
indictments that allege what appear to be separate conspiracies but may actually be parts of an
overall conspiracy,” where a defendant.“‘makes.a non-frivolous showing that two indictments in.
fact charge-orily one.conspiracy; the burden shifts to the prosecution to show; by a
preponderance-of the evidence, that:there are in-fact two distinct. conspiracies.” Uniled States v.
Lopez, 356 F.3d 463, 467 (2d Cir. 2004) (citing United Statés-v. DelVeéchio, 800 F.2d 21, 22 (2d
Cir. 1986)). As demonstrated in Ms.’ Maxwell’s moving papers, application of the Korfant
operation, overt.acts, geography, objectives, and interdependence. Mot. at.2. The government has.
failed to proffer-any evidence tothe contrary; and Ms. Maxwell’s.Motion-should be deemed
confessed.

For the reasons stated in Ms, Maxwell’s origirial-Motion.and this Reply, she:requiests that
the:Court enter an. order requiring: the government to elect the conspiracy charge it-intends to
prosecute arid dismiss the remaining’ count.
