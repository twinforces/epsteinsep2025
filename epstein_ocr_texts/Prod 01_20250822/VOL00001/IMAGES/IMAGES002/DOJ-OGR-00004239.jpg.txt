Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 287 Filed 05/20/21 Page 12 of 16

Finally, the government’s offer to provide Jencks Act and Giglio information for its
testifying witnesses “as much as four weeks” before trial is insufficient. (Opp. 184). Certain of
the Accusers and (we suspect) many of the government’s anticipated witnesses have made
numerous statements about the events in question, either in the context of civil litigation, or to
the media, or in other public fora. The defense will have to carefully analyze and compare any
prior statements or impeachment material that the government discloses against the witness’s
numerous public statements. This process will be time-consuming, but essential to Ms.
Maxwell’s preparation for trial.°

The Court has already acknowledged that the defense will need substantial time to
evaluate and investigate materials related to potential witnesses in this case, and has ordered the
government, over its objection, to produce certain Rule 16 materials related to non-testifying
witnesses by March 12, 2021—four months in advance of trial—“‘to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial.” (Dkt. 73). For the reasons set forth above, the Court should order
the production of all of the requested materials by March 22, 2021.

Wil. The Court Should Grant Ms. Maxwell’s Request for Production and Inspection of

Documents.

Ms. Maxwell’s opening brief identified several redacted or incomplete documents that
were produced in discovery, and documents that were omitted from discovery, that are subject to
disclosure pursuant to the government’s Brady obligations. (Dkt. 148 at 7-10). The government
represents that it has reviewed the documents and they do not contain any Brady material apart
from one statement that the government now discloses in its opposition, or that it is under no
> The government has offered to provide any co-conspirator statements it intends to introduce at trial at the same
time that it provides its Jencks Act disclosures. (Opp. 192). The defense requests that these statements be provided
on the same accelerated timeline set forth above to provide sufficient time in the event that a pretrial hearing is
necessary to determine their admissibility.
