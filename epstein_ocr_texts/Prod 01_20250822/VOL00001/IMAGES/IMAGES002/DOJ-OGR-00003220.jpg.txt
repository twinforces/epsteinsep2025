On May. 23, 2006, Villafatia prepared, the paperwork to open.a USAO case file. Villafatia.
told. OPR ‘that. several aspcets of ‘the. Gase.:implicated federal interests and potentially merited. a.
federal prosecution: (1) the victimization. of minors through the use: of facilities of interstate:
‘commerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of'victims involved; (3) the possibility that:
Epstein, had, been. producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the
computer equipment: from his 'residence); and (4) the ‘possibility. that. improper: political, pressure
had affected ‘the. State. Attorney’ Office’s, handling of the casc. The investigation was named
“ ‘Operation. Leap Y-car” because the state: investigation had identified approximatcly: 29 girls as
victims ‘of Epstcin’s conduct.”

Because ‘Villafafia. was, not familiar with ‘Epstein, she researched his background. and,
learned that he “took:'a,scorched carth approach” to litigation. ‘Villafafia'was aware. that Epstcin.
had hired multiple lawyers ‘to interact with the State Attorneys Office. in.an.cffort' to derail. the
state case, and she believed he would likely do the same in. conncetion with. any federal
investigation.

Therefore, Villafafia arranged. to :mect with U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey
Sloman, who at the time.was'the.Criminal Division Chicf.~" Villafafia told OPR that she had never’
before:asked to mect with “executive management” about:initiating a casc, but the allegations:that.
Epstein, had improperly influenced. the State Attorney’s Office greatly troubled her. “Villafafia.
explained to OPR that. she wantcd.to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the
Epstein. investigation. Jn addition, she viewed. Sloman as a fricnd, in'whom she had particular
confidence. At this point, although Villafafia*s immediate supervisor was aware of the: case,
Villafana did. not.inform Andrew: Louric, who:was then. in :charge of the West.Palm Beach office
and. her second-line: supervisor, about the:matter. or that she:was bricfing Acosta and. Sloman.

Villafafia, met with Acosta ‘and Sloman in. Miami on July. 14, 2006. She told‘OPR that at:
the meeting, she informed.them that.the PBPD had idéntificd:a group of girls who had. provided to
