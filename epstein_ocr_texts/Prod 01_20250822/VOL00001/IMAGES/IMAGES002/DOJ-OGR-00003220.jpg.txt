2. May 2006: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a Case File

On May 23, 2006, Villafafia prepared the paperwork to open a USAO case file. Villafafia
told OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a
federal prosecution: (1) the victimization of minors through the use of facilities of interstate
commerce (the telephone and airports); (2) the number of victims involved; (3) the possibility that
Epstein had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by the removal of the
computer equipment from his residence); and (4) the possibility that improper political pressure
had affected the State Attorney Office’s handling of the case. The investigation was named
“Operation Leap Year” because the state investigation had identified approximately 29 girls as
victims of Epstein’s conduct.”°

Villafafia told OPR that from the outset of the federal investigation, she understood that
the case would require a great deal of time and effort given the number of potential victims and
Epstein’s financial resources. Nonetheless, Villafafia was willing to put in the effort and believed
that the FBI was similarly committed to the case. Villafafia discussed the case with her immediate
supervisor, who also “thought it would be a good case” and approved it to be opened within the
USAO’s file management system, and on May 23, 2006, it was formally initiated.

3. July 14, 2006: Villafaiia Informs Acosta and Sloman about the Case

Because Villafafia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background and
learned that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation. Villafafia was aware that Epstein
had hired multiple lawyers to interact with the State Attorney’s Office in an effort to derail the
state case, and she believed he would likely do the same in connection with any federal
investigation.

Therefore, Villafafia arranged to meet with U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey
Sloman, who at the time was the Criminal Division Chief.”! Villafafia told OPR that she had never
before asked to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that
Epstein had improperly influenced the State Attorney’s Office greatly troubled her. Villafafia
explained to OPR that she wanted to ensure that her senior supervisors were “on board” with the
Epstein investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman as a friend, in whom she had particular
confidence. At this point, although Villafafia’s immediate supervisor was aware of the case,
Villafafia did not inform Andrew Lourie, who was then in charge of the West Palm Beach office
and her second-line supervisor, about the matter or that she was briefing Acosta and Sloman.

Villafafia met with Acosta and Sloman in Miami on July 14, 2006. She told OPR that at
the meeting, she informed them that the PBPD had identified a group of girls who had provided to
70 Villafafia opened “Operation Leap Year” during the same month in which the Department launched its
“Project Safe Childhood” initiative, and Acosta designated Villafafia to serve as the USAO’s Project Safe Childhood
coordinator.

21 Although Acosta had been formally nominated to the U.S. Attorney position on June 9, he was not confirmed
by the Senate until August 3, 2006, and was not sworn in until October 2006. In September 2006, Acosta announced
the appointments of Sloman as FAUSA and Matthew Menchel as Chief of the USAO’s Criminal Division, and they
assumed their respective new offices in October 2006.
