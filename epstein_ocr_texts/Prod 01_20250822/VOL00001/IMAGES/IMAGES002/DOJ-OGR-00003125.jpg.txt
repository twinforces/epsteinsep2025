Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document204 Filed 04/16/21 Page 191 of 239

Accordingly, overt acts that may, on their own, be untimely can nevertheless serve as. direct.
evidence of the existence of'a.charged conspiracy. Sée, ¢:g., United. States v. Benissi, 216 FE. Supp.
2d 299, 301-07, 309 (S.D.N.¥.. 2002) (admitting evidence of otherwise untimely acts during
conspiracy trial); cf. United States ‘v. Mareus, 628 F.3d 36, 43 (2d Cir. 2010) (declining to vacate
a-conViction on a statute with, only prospective application when, “the Government presented. post-
‘enactment. evidence sufficient to satisfy the elements” in, addition to ‘evidence of relevant pre-
enactment-conduct). Evidence regarding’Minor Victim-3 ‘is thus admissible to prove'the existence
of the conspiracy, 'cven 1f.a conviction:could not. be: supported based on her experiences alone.*”
The Government, agrees ‘with the defendant that. Minor Victim-3 turned 25 before 2003
and, asa result, a substantive count. based exclusively on conduct. involving Minor Victim-3, is
time-barred. .As discussed. above, however, the: conduct involving Minor Victim-1. and. Minor
Victim-2 alleged in. the Indictment is timely.. Thus, if the jury concludes ‘that; the conspiracies
cxistéd, involved cithér. Minor Victim-1 or Minor Victim-2, and included at' least oné overt act as
to:cither’Minor Victim-], or Minor’Victim- 2, then-Counts One. and Three are not'time-barred. See
Salmonese,; 352 F.3d at 614. Morcover, and‘so,as to cnsure that: any. count of conviction is based

‘on timely: conduct, the Government would have:no objection to an appropriate: instruction from.

°° Asa fallback:argument, the defense cites United States v. Hsia, 24 F. Supp..2d.14 (D.D.C, 1998),
in-which,a District Judge concluded. that alleged overt acts involving conecalment or “cover-ups”
were not obviously within the ‘scope of the charged conspiracy to, defraud the United States by’
impairing and impeding the Immigration. and Naturalization Service. Jd. at 20, 24-26. Although,
the Court denicd the motion to strike the alleged surplusage, it ordered the: prosccution.to, provide
a. bill of particulars regarding the alleged acts of concealment. Jd. at 26,33. The case is readily:
distinguishable because’ the alleged surplusage in Hsia, involved a completely different type of
conduct=obstruction=than that, charged in the indictment=fraud. Here, by contrast, the
allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 irivolve conduct: that ‘falls ‘within. the heartland, of the
conspiracy: grooming a minor girl to engage in sex acts'with Jeffrey Epstein. Morcover, ‘in both.
the Indictment and in this memorandum, ‘the Government has: provided extensive: detail regarding
Minor Victim-3’s anticipated, testimony, which avoids any’ concern, that, the: defendant will be
surprised, at trial, which, was the animating concern'in Hsia. See id: at 33. As such, this motion,
docs ‘not offer'a basis for a bill of particulars.
