court, modified. the protective order and issued a 26page’ decision. The Government, acted jin
reasonable reliance on'the district court’s decision.

The defendant-argues that the Government misled the Court when it “claimed not to know:
what was in Boies Schiller’s file, and,that Boies Schiller}had no:role in instigating the investigation,
of Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 11 at 1). The defendant’s claims are both. factually inaccurate aid

First, the Government:did not mislead Chicf Judge McMahon about:its, contacts with Boies
Schiller. As an initial :matter, .Maxwell’s argument is premised solely on. her useof selective
snippets from a lone Daily News Article that, is premised, in meaningful ‘part, on anonymous
sourcés and hearsay. As the factual background set. forth above—which is corroborated. by notes
and. correspondence produced. alongside this brief—makes clear, David. Boics and-Boies Schiller
played, no role in initiating, Iet alone “‘fomenting” the Government’s. investigation. That:
investigation Was opened morc than two and.a half years, afterthe last.known contact between any’
lawyer associated. with any civil counsel for Giuffre and, in any event, was initially focused on.
Epstein, not this defendant. As detailed above, the USAO-SDNY opened the instant. investigation.
‘in. late November 2018 shortly after the.Miami Herald published a:scries of articles :about Epstein.
AUSA-1 was not involved. in that. decision, which in‘any event had nothing to do with a meeting

that had taken place nearly three years:prior” (Ex. 4 at'6).

3? Maxwell repeatedly claims that: Boics Schiller urged AUSA=1 to open ‘an. investigation. of
Epstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at'8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside
from the above-referenced. media report, is incorrect. While AUSA-1I did mect. with the three
attorncys in. February’ 2016, she understood the attorneys 'to be focused..on Epstein, and.:not on.
Epstein and Maxwell, as. a “duo.” (Ex. 4:at ‘1, 4). The presentation.to AUSA-1 focused on urging
‘an. investigation, into Epstein with only passing references to Maxwell. Simply’ put, the pitch was.
to investigate Epstein, not, Maxwell.
