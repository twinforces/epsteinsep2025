Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 116 of 239
court modified the protective order and issued a 26-page decision. The Government acted in
reasonable reliance on the district court’s decision.

The defendant argues that the Government misled the Court when it “claimed not to know
what was in Boies Schiller’s file and that Boies Schiller had no role in instigating the investigation
of Maxwell.” (Def. Mot. 11 at 1). The defendant’s claims are both factually inaccurate and
meritless.

First, the Government did not mislead Chief Judge McMahon about its contacts with Boies
Schiller. As an initial matter, Maxwell’s argument is premised solely on her use of selective
snippets from a lone Daily News Article that is premised, in meaningful part, on anonymous
sources and hearsay. As the factual background set forth above—which is corroborated by notes
and correspondence produced alongside this brief—makes clear, David Boies and Boies Schiller
played no role in initiating, let alone “fomenting” the Government’s investigation. That
investigation was opened more than two and a half years after the last known contact between any
lawyer associated with any civil counsel for Giuffre and, in any event, was initially focused on
Epstein, not this defendant. As detailed above, the USAO-SDNY opened the instant investigation
in late November 2018 shortly after the Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein.
AUSA-1 was not involved in that decision, which in any event had nothing to do with a meeting
that had taken place nearly three years prior.*? (Ex. 4 at 6).
°° Maxwell repeatedly claims that Boies Schiller urged AUSA-1 to open an investigation of
Epstein and Maxwell, (Def. Mot. 3 at 8), but that allegation, which is supported by nothing aside
from the above-referenced media report, is incorrect. While AUSA-1 did meet with the three
attorneys in February 2016, she understood the attorneys to be focused on Epstein, and not on
Epstein and Maxwell as a “duo.” (Ex. 4 at 1, 4). The presentation to AUSA-1 focused on urging
an investigation into Epstein with only passing references to Maxwell. Simply put, the pitch was
to investigate Epstein, not Maxwell.
