obligated to.amend her prior Ietter to. victims to correet the reference to 'the December letter.3”

Accordingly, the September letter contained no information’ about the: parties’ intent; in,
implementing’ 18 U.S.C. § 2255, but ‘merely’ referred to the NPA language concerning Epstcin’s
waiver of his ‘right to ‘contest liability under ‘the. provision. In addition, the September letter

represent'the victims in their 18°U:S.C. § 2255 litigation, against Epstein, and Epstcin’s agreement
to’pay the attorney. representative’s fecs arising out, of such litigation. The letter also clarified that.
Epstcin’s agrecment:to, pay foriattorncys’ fees did not.cxtend to contested litigation against him.

would like to review the Agreement, please let 'me know, and I will
forward a:copy. of the Protective Order for her signature.

that the [NPA] is.available'to them: upon.request and: ‘doing so is:in.conflict with. the: confidentiality
provisions of the [NPA].” In.rcsponse, and in consultation with USAO management, Villafaiia.
revised the paragraph, as ‘follows:

In. addition, there has been litigation between. the United. States and
two other victims regarding the disclosure of the entire agreement
between the United States and. Mr. Epstcin. [The attorney. sclected
by. the special:master] can provide further guidance on this issue, or.
if ‘you seléct. another attorney to represent: ‘you, that attorney can
review the Court’s order in the [CVRA litigation].
