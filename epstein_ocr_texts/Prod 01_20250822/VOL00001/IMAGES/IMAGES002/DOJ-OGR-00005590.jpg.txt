F. The Court Should Preclude Challenges to the Credibility of Individuals Who Are Not

Witnesses at Trial

The defendant does not appear to dispute the Government’s statement of the law: the
credibility of individuals who are neither witnesses nor hearsay declarants is not at issue and cannot
be challenged. (Def. Opp. at 43-45). The motion should therefore be granted.

The defense’s primary response is that they are not sure what statements will be elicited
and the non-hearsay bases for such statements. Of course, the defense has had the Government’s
witness list and Jencks Act material for more than two weeks. Those materials make clear that the
Government does not intend to elicit hearsay statements from Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-
6. And the defense has failed to point to any such evidence. To give one example, to the extent
the Government offers a school record related to Minor Victim-5 as a business record (see id. at
45 (citing GX 781-83)), that record would not constitute a statement by Minor Victim-5 offered
for the truth of the matter asserted.

Insofar as the defense’s point is that the Government might open the door to challenging
the credibility of an individual by offering that individual’s hearsay statement for the truth of the
matter asserted, the Government agrees. But if the Government does not open the door, the
credibility of Minor Victim-5 and Minor Victim-6 are not at issue. And the defense cannot
challenge the credibility of these individuals—in opening statements or otherwise—unless and
until the defense seeks a ruling from the Court that the Government has opened the door.

G. Evidence or Argument About the Minor Victims’ Consent is Categorically

Inadmissible

The defendant is charged with enticement of a minor, transporting a minor, sex trafficking
of a minor, and conspiracy to commit those offenses. (See Indictment [J 11-27). None of those
