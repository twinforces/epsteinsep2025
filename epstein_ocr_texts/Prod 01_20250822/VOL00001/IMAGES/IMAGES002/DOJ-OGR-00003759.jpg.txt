Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 210 Filed 04/16/21 Page2of6

The government does not dispute that Counts 1 and 3 charge Ms. Maxwell with the same
crime, conspiracy in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, nor that the charges are based on identical
facts. Effectively conceding that the counts are multiplicitious, the government argues that the
motion is “premature,” focusing only on the jeopardy problem that would occur if Ms. Maxwell
were convicted on both counts at trial and ignoring the prejudice to Ms. Maxwell attendant to the
overcharging. The government argues that the Court should defer ruling on this motion until
“after the completion of trial” which will “ensure” a full factual record. Resp. at 172. The
government is wrong.

The Court can, and should, grant this Motion, direct the government to elect which of the
conspiracy charges it will prosecute, and dismiss the other. The identical facts are plainly alleged
in the superseding indictment (“Indictment”), and the government has presented no factual
distinction in its response. Accordingly, no additional record is necessary and very clear
authority exists supporting the relief requested by Ms. Maxwell, dismissal of one of the
multiplicitous counts. “District courts presented with what are recognized before or during trial
to be multiplicitous indictments will avoid any problem by requiring the prosecution to elect
between counts charged rather than by merging the counts at sentencing.” United States v.
Polizzi, 257 F.R.D. 33, 36-37 (E.D.N.Y. 2009). The Court should order such an election and
dismissal here.

I. The Motion is Not Premature, and the Court has Discretion to Direct Election
and Dismissal Pretrial

The government’s “prematurity” argument is misplaced. Pursuant to Federal Rule of
Criminal Procedure 12(b)(3)(B)(ii), a defendant is required to raise arguments based
on defects in the indictment, including “charging the same offense in more than one count
(multiplicity),” by pretrial motion “if the basis for the motion is then reasonably available and the
