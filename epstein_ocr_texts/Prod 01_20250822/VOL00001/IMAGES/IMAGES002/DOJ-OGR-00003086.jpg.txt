the victims specified in.the Indictment about sexualized massages the victims provided.to Epstein,
conduct that.obviously predated. the:deposition. See Indictment} 7(a), (€). In. context, and, with an
understanding of the Government’s other evidence, a-rational juror could readily conclude:that the
question “did Jeffrey Epstcin have a.scheme to recruit underage girls. for sexual massages . . . [i]f
ambiguity was not. “fundamental.” Cf Lriumph Capital Grp. Inc., 237 F. App’x at 628
(concluding that: an answer about. “this arrangement” was not: fundamentally ambiguous).

Nor is there: any: basis to dismiss the: count. now based on the defendant’s. professed
confusion.or denial of knowledge of the scheme’s existence. A.defendant:may, commit perjury by’
falsely denying memory or knowledge of an event. See, ¢.g., United States. Albértis 568 F.2d.
740 F. Supp: 2d, at 410-11. ‘Viewing the: question..and answer “‘in,'the context of‘ the line of
questioning. as a “whole,” ‘the. defendant “consistently denicd” kiiowlcdge of Epstcin’s. scheme,
Markiewicz, 978 F.2d at.81,0, and.a jury’ could conclude that the “question was not fundamentally:
ambiguous=and. thus, that [the defendant], understanding the question, lied.” See Sampson, 898
F.3d at 307; cf Indictment 49 4(c) 11(c)-(d),, 17(c)-(d) (discussing use of massage.as part of the
‘sexual abuse scheme).

Second, later in.the: deposition, Giuffre’s counsel asked the defendant a scries of questions
in. an attempt to identify other underage: girls that the: defendant met and brought to Epstein.
Specifically:

Q. Can you list for me all the. girls that you have met and brought'to
Jeffrey Epstein’s house:that-were under the age of 18?
