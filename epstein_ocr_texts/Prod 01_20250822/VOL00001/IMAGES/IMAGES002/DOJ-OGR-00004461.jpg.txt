agreement that did not require Epstein’s cooperation nor did the USAM require Acosta to obtain
Departmental approval before doing so.

C. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any Clear and

Unambiguous Standards

Although Acosta, as U.S. Attorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a
non-prosecution agreement that deferred prosecution to the state, OPR also considered whether a
clear and unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.
Specifically, OPR examined Acosta’s decision to permit Epstein to resolve the federal
investigation by pleading guilty to state charges of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution
and solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding recommendation for an 18-month sentence of
incarceration. Because, as noted above, OPR found no clear guidance applicable to non-
prosecution agreements not involving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating
to plea offers to assess the propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence requirements. OPR also
examined the provision declining to prosecute Epstein’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”
to determine whether that provision violated Departmental policy regarding grants of immunity.
Finally, OPR considered whether there was a clear and unambiguous obligation under the
Department’s policy regarding the deportation of criminal aliens, which would have required
further action to be taken against the two Epstein assistants who were foreign nationals.

After considering the applicable rules and policies, OPR finds that Acosta’s decision to
resolve the federal investigation through the NPA did not violate any clear and unambiguous
standards and that Acosta had the authority to resolve the federal investigation through a state plea
and through the terms that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did not commit
professional misconduct in developing, negotiating, or approving the NPA, nor did the other
subjects who implemented his decisions with respect to the resolution.”

1. Acosta Had Authority to Approve an Agreement That Required
Epstein to Plead to Offenses Resulting in an 18-Month Term of
Incarceration

Federal prosecutors have discretion to resolve a pending case or investigation through a
plea agreement, including a plea that calls for the imposition of a specific, predetermined sentence.
USAM §8§ 9-27.330, 9-27.400; see also Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1).
206 OPR also considered whether Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or Villafafia failed to comply with
professional ethics standards requiring that attorneys exercise competence and diligence in their representation of a
client. Attorneys have a duty to provide competent, diligent representation to their clients, which generally requires
the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation reasonably necessary for the representation. See, e.g., FRPC
4-1.1, 4-1.3. The requirement of diligence obligates an attorney to exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but
does not require the attorney “to press for every advantage that might be realized for a client.” See FRPC 4-1.3
(comment). Although OPR criticizes certain decisions made during the USAO’s investigation of Epstein, those
decisions, even if flawed, did not violate the standard requiring the exercise of competence or diligence. The subjects
exhibited sufficient knowledge, skill, preparation, thoroughness, and zeal during the federal investigation and the NPA
negotiations to satisfy the general standards established by the professional responsibility rules. An attorney may
attain a flawed result but still exercise sufficient competence and diligence throughout the representation to meet the
requirements of the standard.
