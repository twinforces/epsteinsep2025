° She “persuaded” Giuffre to go to Epstein’s mansion “in a fashion very similar to the
manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators coerced dozens of other
children.” Id.

° Ms. Maxwell “appreciated the immunity” she acquired under Epstein’s plea

media obtained copies of the motion, printed the “lurid” details in tabloid news publications, and
sought comment from Ms. Maxwell, Professor Dershowitz and others.
