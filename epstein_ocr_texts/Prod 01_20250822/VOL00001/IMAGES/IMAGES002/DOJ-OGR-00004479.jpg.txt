accept the two-ycar proposal, when it. was made, but instead. continucd to: press for a'sentence of
home confinement, suggesting that the defense had not. requested ‘the two-ycar'term.as a favor and,
did. not ‘view. it as such. The defense had previously:rejected the state’s offer of a sentence of
probation, and there is’ no, indication. in the contémporancous records that Epstein. viewed any jail
sentence favorably and certainly'that did:not appear to be:the view’of the defense:team ‘in-the: carly.
stages of the negotiations.

As discussed below, after extensive questioning of the subjects about the basis forthe two-
year offer, and a thorough review of the documentary record, OPR ‘was, unable ‘to detérniine the
reasoning: underlying the. decision. to offer two years as ‘the term of incarccration, as opposed. to
any other term of: years. Nonetheless, OPR concludes from the evidence that: Acosta was aware of
and, approved the initial, offer to the defense, which included the two-year term of incarceration.
The only evidence suggesting that:-the offer of two’ years stemmed from an improper‘motivation of
Méenchel’s was a single second-hand, statement in an email. drafted. many. 'ycars later. Sloman, the:
purported declarant, told:OPR that:he could not recall whether he:made‘the statement, but.he:firmly.
disputed that the cmail accurately reflected. cither the:.reason for the two-year proposal or his
understanding of that. reason. Villafafia herself could. remember little about. the critical,
conversation. with, Sloman, including whether she: had recorded. accurately what Sloman, had ‘said.
Given the lack’ of afiy corroborating ¢vidence, and.'the evidence showing Epstein’s Vigorous
resistance to the proposal, OPR. concludes. that there.:is no evidence. to. support the statement’ in.
Villafafia’s 2018 email that Menchel ‘had extended a two-ycar. plea deal as a favor ‘to one: of
Epstcin’s attorneys.

1. The Evidence Shows That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet. with
Epstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic Considerations

Although pre-indictment negotiations are: typical in white-collar:criminal cases. involving
financial.crimes, witnesses told OPR that pre-charge meetings with:defense counsel are: infrequent
‘in'sex offense'cases. Asthe lead.prosccutor, Villafatia:vchemently opposed meeting with Epstein’s
attorneys. and, voiced her concerns to her supervisors, but was overruled by them. In Villafafia’s
view, the significance of the carly mectings granted to the defense team''was that, but for those
mectings, the USAO Would not have offered the disposition | Sct forth in. the July 3:1, 2007 “term,
shect” and, :morcover, “that term-shect would never have been offered:to anyone. else.”

OPR’s investigation established that while‘the defense attorncys.persistently contacted the
subjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively. few’ in-person ‘mectings
actually occurred with the USAO personnel. involved in. the matter. As shown. in the charton the
