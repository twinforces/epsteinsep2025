prejudice. Maxwell, 2021 WL 1518675, at *14. In the instant motion, Maxwell similarly argues
that count five of the S2 indictment, the sex trafficking conspiracy charge, is duplicative of either
counts one or three. Maxwell’s motion is denied without prejudice for the reasons stated in the
Court’s April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order.

V. The Government’s delay in bringing the charges did not violate due process

Maxwell also renews her motion to dismiss the S2 indictment based on alleged improper
pretrial delay. In its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, the Court denied Maxwell’s motion,
concluding that her efforts to show actual and substantial prejudice fell far short of the “stringent
standard” necessary to prevail on such a claim. Maxwell, 2021 WL 1518675, at *9. Maxwell’s
motion to dismiss the S2 on these grounds fails for the same reasons. As before, nothing in the
record indicates that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart
Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. However, it is sufficient to conclude that Maxwell does
not make the strong showing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim. Maxwell
contends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests because
potential witnesses have died, others have forgotten, and records have been lost or destroyed. It
is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference in her case.

The Court thus again concludes for the reasons stated in the April 16, 2021 Opinion &
Order, that Maxwell has failed to establish actual prejudice from the Government’s delay in
bringing charges. She may renew her motion if the factual record at trial shows otherwise. On
the present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due process bars the charges
here.
