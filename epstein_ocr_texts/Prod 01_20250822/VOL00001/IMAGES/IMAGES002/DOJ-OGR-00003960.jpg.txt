Indeed, as the Court noted in its April. ‘16, 2021 Opinion, OPR. thoroughly investigated the
circumstances of the negotiation of the NPA and issucd extensive: findings from. its investigation.
Nothing ‘in the OPR report supports. the defendant’s assertion. that the NPA bars this prosecution.
(April 16, 2021 Opinion, Dkt. No. 207 at 5-6 (“Maxwell has already received access to. an.
unusually large amount of'information about:the NPA’s:negotiation history: in the formof the OPR.
report, and.yct identifies no evidence: that the Department; of Justice made. any’ :promises, not.
contained in the NPA.”); at 8 (‘No:record evidence suggests that prosecutors: promised anything:
beyond what-was spelled out.in-writing.”)). The Government does not intend,to seck any. additional,
‘materials from other offices or agencies relating'to the NPA, and.the Court has alréady denied the
defense’s request for discovery relating to the NPA.

Respectfully submitted,
