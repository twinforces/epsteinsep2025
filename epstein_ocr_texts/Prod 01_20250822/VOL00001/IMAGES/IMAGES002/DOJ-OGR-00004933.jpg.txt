need. Here such a showing was amply demonstrated. To have refused access to these records in |
the face of a subpoena from a grand jury would have been an abuse of discretion.” Jd. at 423. |
I will, therefore, consider the Government’s application. |
B. The Martindell Standard Applies |
Ordinarily, “Where there has been reasonable reliance by a party or deponent, a District |
Court should not modify a protective order granted under Rule 26(c).” S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, |
273 F.3d 222, 229 (2d Cir, 2001). However, the Second Circuit established a limited exception |
to this rule in Martindell v. International Tel. and Tel. Corp., 594 F.2d 291 (2d Cir. 1979). |
Martindell arose after the Government made an informal, telephonic request to the |
district court in a stockholder derivative suit for access to deposition transcripts, which were )
subject to a protective order and which the Government planned to use in a criminal |
investigation. Jd. at 293. The district court denied the Government’s request to modify the |
protective order to enable it to access the transcripts. Jd. Affirming the lower court, the Second |
Circuit reasoned that, when the Government moves to modify a protective order, it is especially
appropriate to require a higher showing, because the Government both (i) possesses |
extraordinary police powers that it can use to obtain the information in other ways, and
(ii) typically seeks the information “in the context of a public investigation in which the assertion |
of a privilege might be of critical importance.” In re Agent Orange Prod. Liab. Litig., 104 |
F.R.D. 559, 570 (E.D.N.Y. 1985), aff'd, 821 F.2d 139 (2d Cir. 1987) (citing Martindell, 594 F.2d |
at 295). The court concluded, “After balancing the interests at stake, we are satisfied that, absent |
a showing of improvidence in the grant of a Rule 26(c) protective order or some extraordinary |
circumstance or compelling need, none of which appear here, a witness should be entitled to rely |
upon the enforceability of a protective order against any third parties, including the Government, |
