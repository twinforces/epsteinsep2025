G4LMGIUC

1 years and years ago. The recent doctors we have disclosed they
2 have noticed for deposition.

3 THE COURT: What else?

4 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, with respect to the

5 employment and education records, as you heard plaintiff say,

6 she has disclosed, quote/unquote, what she has. Under local

7 rule 33.3, we are allowed to ask for the names of witnesses

8 with knowledge at the outset of the case, and they might be

9 custodians of records. We asked her who have been your

10 employers. She won't tell us who her employers have been. She
Le has just gone through her computer and say if I have an

12 employment record I'll give it to you, but I am not going to
13 tell you who her employers were.
14 THE COURT: She will.

LS MS. MENNINGER: Same thing with the education records.
16 We asked her to list where she had gone to school and tell us
V7 where it is. She won't do it. Those are the things where my
18 skepticism arises from.

19 Largely, to the extent your Honor has ordered the
20 production of whatever materials, criminal investigation
21 materials that were not to be submitted in camera, those were
22 the ones that involved plaintiff's statements, we would like
23 the other materials that they have brought with them today to
24 give to your Honor that do not encompass their client's
25 statements to law enforcement.
