defendant under the Double Jeopardy Clause. Whatever Epstein’s rights and obligations were
under the NPA, including his obligation to plead guilty to two state solicitation offenses, the NPA
is simply an agreement between Epstein and the USAO-SDFL. The USAO-SDFL’s agreement to
decline to prosecute other offenses is not an adjudication of any facts that goes to the merits of
those offenses. Nor could it be: neither Epstein nor the defendant was charged with those offenses,
and the NPA was never put before a judge who could engage in fact-finding or even so-order the
agreement. There is no sense in which the defendant risked conviction or was ever in genuine
jeopardy. See Dionisio, 503 F.3d at 84.

This point is only underscored by United States v. Cambindo Valencia, 609 F.2d 603 (2d

Jesus and, “as part of his plea bargaining agreement, the dismissal of charges against” Rosalinda.
Id. at 637. The two were later charged as part of another cocaine conspiracy. Jd. at 607. The
defendants argued that the new prosecution violated the Double Jeopardy Clause as to both of
them, and the plea agreement as to Rosalinda. /d. at 637. The Second Circuit remanded for the
district court to reconsider its decision in light of its other holdings narrowing the charged
conspiracy. It added that “[i]f Jesus’s earlier plea is found to bar prosecution of him because of
double jeopardy, since concededly the plea included an agreement to drop the charges against
Rosalinda, the instant prosecution of Rosalinda will also be barred.” /d. at 638. That is, if double
jeopardy barred re-prosecution of Jesus, the prosecution of Rosalinda was barred because of the
plea agreement. Accordingly, when the district court later dismissed the count against Jesus on
double jeopardy grounds, it dismissed the count against Rosalinda “because of the government’s
