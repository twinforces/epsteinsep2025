Mr. Markus has made multiple ‘statements to: the media in, the past few months,” ‘On ‘May:
11, 202.1, the Government; emailed ‘the defendant’s counsel of record in this case ‘and. expressed.
concern.about Mr. Markus’s statements, citing’Local Rule 23.1. Defense counsel did not. respond.

Most recently, on June 30, 2021, Mr. Markus authored an Op-Ed. in the New York Daily
News.? The Op-Ed compared the defendant to Bill Cosby and. argued that this ‘case should. be
dismissed,in,the wake of Mr. Cosby’s release‘from’prison. The Op-Ed.claims that.Jeffrey Epstein’s
non-prosccution. agreement is binding ‘in this District, but: that. “[t]he trial court; just like the trial
court and intermediate appellate court.in Cosby’s case, has. agreed to let the g government out of its
deal.” The-Op-Ed further claims that this case is“cxtremely. weak” and asscrts'that.“[a] jury should
reject those flimsy and stale charges.” The Op-Ed. also identifies: Mr. Markus as “Maxwell’s
appellate counsel.” Other news outlets have subsequently issued articles regarding the Op-Ed."

B. [Relief.Is Warranted Under Local Rule 23.1

person would ¢ expect. to ereate ‘ ‘a substantial likelihood that such dissemination will interfere with
a. fair trial or otherwise prejudice the duc administration of justice.” SDNY Local Rule 23.1 (a).
The Rule further ‘provides, in 'relévant part, that, statements of “opinion.as to the accuséd’s guilt or
innocence or. as to the merits of the case: or the evidence: in the case” are among: those that
“presumptively:involve:a substantial. likelihood. that their public dissemination: will interfere: with.
a.fair trial or otherwise prejudice the duc administration of justice.” SDNY Local, Rule 23.1(d)(7).
The Rule: applics.to all statements made by lawyers “in connection with pending or imminent:
criminal litigation with which. they are associated.” SDNY Local Rule 23.1(a). Furthermore, the
Rule provides ‘that’ the Court. “may :issuc a special, order governing such. matters as éxtrajudicial.
statements by partics and witnesses likely to interfere with the rights of the accused to a fair trial.
by an, impartial jury ... 2” SDNY Local Rule 23.1 (h).

Mr. Markus,‘is plainly. governed by’ Local, Rule 23.1, because he is not only. “associated”
with this. criminal case, but, he is also counsel of record in, the defendant’s appeals in connection.
with this matter. Mr. Markus’ s comments to. the ™media—most ceregiously, the Op- Ed— were

of this case, but they’ did ‘SO ina a ‘manner designed to appeal directly-to the ‘pool of potential jurors
