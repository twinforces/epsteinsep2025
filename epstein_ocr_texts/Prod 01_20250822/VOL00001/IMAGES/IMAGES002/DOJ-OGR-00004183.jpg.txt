‘Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE, Document 285-2 Filed 05/20/21. Page 4 of 7

° AK’s recollection is that,the attorneys did, not-make any suggestions regarding what
investigative steps SDNY: should take. ‘The:attorneys did.not suggest that SDNY: usc

civil lawsuits aS a. means to conduct a criminal, investigation.

e Discussion of-Epstcin’s conduct expanded beyond Virginia Roberts. Attorneys described
the conduct as involving many or several other girls. There was moré detail provided
about Virginia Roberts: S experiences but there. was a. broader, discussion, about, Epstein’ S
Virginia w was:no longer ‘avolved.

e AK’s understanding was not thatthe attorneys were hoping SDNY ‘would investigate ‘or,
charge anyone other. than Epstein. The mecting was focused on Epstein. ‘There was:
mention of other people who had helped. him over'time, including ait individual who was
in Europe and, potentially was asource of evidenee against Epstein. ‘The thrust: of the
discussion,was about building’a case against‘Epstein. The other individuals were:
mentioned. or described as part of telling the story, or as: potential sources of information.

e AK.does not remember cxactly‘what she said at the end.of the mecting, but she knows
her practice was that in every § such meeting she has ever-had, she has thanked the people
office would do about ‘the: information: that was. provided,

o AK absolutely did not-tell the attorncys that an investigation would be opened.

Events after February 29, 2016 'mceeting:

e After the February 29, 2016 :mecting, AK emailed.Dan.Stcin (Chiefof Criminal Division
at the time). Had a'meeting in his office. AK discussed'with Stein what,the lawyers had

gave “AK. some _ pause ‘because she had other « occasions s where civil litigants have,
decided. to, report,something to the USAO because'they think it:will help, them in
‘their'civil case. AK.mentioned that to Stein.

o ‘Discusscd.the length of'time that had passed; wasn’t clear there was any’ ongoing
conduct; USAO SDFL is.a reputable USAO with skilled.FBI agents, and AK’s
assumption was that however they concluded. theircase probably reflected
something about;the strength, of the case. or'some issuc ‘that existed.

o One thing that leaned in favor of'taking: action’was that one of the lawyers (Stan
or Brad) said. that FBI agents in Florida case were:not happy with-the result:and
how the case'was resolved. That concerned AK. because experienced. FBI agents
in this area-usually, in. AK’s expericnec, make collaborative: decisions with the
USAO.

o AK & Stein decided (don’ trecall who came up with idea) that AK.would:rcach.
out to Sean Watson (head of FBI C-20.at'the, time) and ask him to contact Miami
FBI agents to ask’ if they“ in fact: were unhappy‘with the outcome and felt like
justice had not. been served.

° After the mecting with Stein, AK. called Sean Watson.and relayed the summary of this
and asked him,to reach out'to the Miami agents who were on the Epstein ‘case. AK,asked
