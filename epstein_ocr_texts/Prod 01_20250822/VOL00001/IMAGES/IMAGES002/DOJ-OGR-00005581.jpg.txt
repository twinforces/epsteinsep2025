particular set of circumstances, and none address evidentiary rulings. Instead, these cases concern
Brady errors involving the withholding of exculpatory information, such as a statement in which
a witness at trial stated that he “did not see the perpetrator’s face,” Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d 1034,
1036 (Sth Cir. 1985), or evidence pointing toward an alternative perpetrator, Bowen v. Maynard,
799 F.2d 593, 612 (10th Cir. 1986). See also Kyles, 514 U.S. at 445-46 (confidential informant
“essential to [the Government’s] investigation” made statements “replete with inconsistencies”).
In addition to the obvious exculpatory value of this information, the courts explained that it would
be used to “attack[] the reliability of the investigation.” Kyles, 514 U.S. at 446.

The defense would rest a pile of irrelevant evidence on this slender reed. In their view,
from the principle that the defense can attack the “thoroughness” of an investigation, they may
elicit any information aimed at explaining—and attacking—the decisionmaking of the agents and
prosecutors involved in a case. Kyles, the case chiefly cited by the defense, is about whether the
“prosecution improperly withheld evidence that, had it been disclosed, would have ‘raised
opportunities to attack the thoroughness and even the good faith of the investigation.’ Kyles
provides no guidance about what evidence must be admitted at trial or what lines of questioning
must be permitted to ensure a meaningful opportunity to cross-examine adverse witnesses,”
Watson v. Greene, 640 F.3d 501, 512 n.11 (2d Cir. 2011) (emphasis added, alteration in original,
citation omitted), nor do the other cases.

Even if the cases cited by the defense spoke directly to this context, and not the limits of
Brady material, they still would not reach so far. For instance, in Bowen, the Tenth Circuit found
that if the defense had been provided information about the alternative perpetrator, they could have
