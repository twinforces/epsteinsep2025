in Support Thereof.

Ill. The Government’s violation of the Fifth Amendment requires suppression.

The government offers three responses to Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment argument. None
is persuasive.

The government’s first response is to deny any state action. Resp. at 99-100. But as even
the government admits, a private party, like Boies Schiller, is deemed to be an agent of the state

the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the State.” Resp. at 99 (quoting United States v.
Stein, 541 F.3d 130, 146 (2d Cir. 2008)). Here, based on the record of the government’s contacts
with Boies Schiller in the months before and after Maxwell’s depositions, there is at least a
genuine question of fact as to the government’s role in encouraging Boies Schiller.

We know that the government contemplated a perjury prosecution of Maxwell, as seen in
the government’s newly-disclosed notes from the meeting. Reply ISO Mot. to Suppress, Ex. K, p

Indeed, the contemporaneous notes of the February 29 meeting show that Boies Schiller
promised to send the government “depositions,” Reply ISO Mot. to Suppress, Ex. J, p 8, and
David Boies later complained about his frustration that the government had not yet charged
