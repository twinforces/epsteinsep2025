Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document395_ Filed 10/29/21 Page4of9

Ghislaine 'Maxwell moves in limine to preclude reference fo the accusers as “victims” or
to'the accusers as “victims” or “minor victims.” Instcad, all trial. participants, including the
Court, should refer to all persons by their individual. names.

Under thé United States Constitution, Ms. Maxwell:is presumed intidcent unless the
government'proves all, clements of the alleged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. 'U:S., Const.
amend. V;./n re Winship, 397 US. 358, 364 (1970). The presumption of innocence has deep:
historical roots and.is.a core tenct of criminal. law: “The principle that there isa presumption of
innocence in, favor of the accused. is the undoubted. law, axiomatic and clementary, and its
enforcement lics at the ‘foundation of the administration of our'criminal law.” Coffin’. United
States, 156 U.S. 432, 453 (1895) (looking to Deuteronomy and the.law of Athens, Sparta, and
Rome for carly versions, of the, presumption. of innocenee).

In some criminal cases, the partics agreethat’ an aécusér'was:the victim of 4.crime. When,
for example, a:person is stabbed ‘or shot, there: is no ‘dispute that the person was a. victim ‘of
something. /:.2:, Jackson v., Staté, 600 A.2d 21; 24 (Del. 1991) (stating, on appeal, from.a rape
conviction, that “[t]he. term ‘victim? is used appropriately: during trial:when there is:no ‘doubt that
‘a.crime was. committed and. simply the identity ofthe perpetrator is in issuc.”)..

This is not onc: of thosé cases. Rather; Ms. Maxwell denies that.she victimized anyone.
And.there:is ample evidence to support her defense. Thejury ultimately will-have to:decide
whether the government.has proven that these: accusers arein fact “victims” or “minor victims.”
In advance of the jury's verdict, any reference to the accusers by those. terms necessarily conveys.
the'speaker’s opinion that a.crime in fact: occurred and that:the accusers are credible. Conveying,

such a-personal belicf biases the jury against Ms. Maxwell, impliés a belicf in the truthfulness of
