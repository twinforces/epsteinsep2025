Falter. United, States 23 F.2d,420, 425-26 (2d Cir. 1928). The distinction between statutes that.
revive expired prosccutions.and those that extend, existing limitations periods has deep :roots in.
established jurisprudence. It:is well-settled that the Ex Post Facto Clause prohibits laws that:revive
time-barred prosecutions, but permits laws, that retroactively extend limitations ‘periods. Stogner
v. California, 539'U.S,. 607, 632. (2003) (holding that the Ex: Post ‘Facto Clause: does not “prevent:
‘the State from, extending time limits for . . .:prosecutions, not: yet time barred.”); United Siates v.
Morgan, 113.F.3d.1230, 1997 WL 268712, at *7 (2d Cir. 1997) (unpublished opinion) (“The long-
standing rule in this circuit. is that Congress has the power to extend. the period of limitations
without running afoul of the é¢ post facto clausé, provided the original period has ‘not already’
run.”) (citing, Falter, 23 F.3d at. 425-26). And. other circuits have emphasized. this distinction in.
the :context-of Section, 3283. Leo Sune Chief, 438 F.3d, at 922-25; Jeffries, 405 F.3d 685.

Read ‘together, the Second Circuit’s decisions. in Weingarten, Vernon, J:nterprise, and
Falter establish that Congress may’ retroactively: extend. the limitations ‘period for, still-viable
prosecutions. That is precisely what.has occurred here, because the charges'in the Indictment were
still timely when. the:.2003 amendment extended the limitations period. .As a ‘result, applying
‘Section 3283 in this: case’ docs not create impermissible retroactive effects. Therefore; step two of
Landgraf is satisfied, atid Séction. 3283 applies retroactively.

Resisting this conclusion, the defendant asserts that, in the criminal. context, Landgraf’s
second step provides protections beyond ‘the Ex, Post Facto Clause. ‘But that is not the law. See’
