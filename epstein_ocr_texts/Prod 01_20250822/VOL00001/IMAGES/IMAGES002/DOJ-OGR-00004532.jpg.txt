involved in such notifications. According to Villafafia, Sloman, then. dirccted her to have the ‘case:
agents make the victim,notifications.

Accordingly, Villafana dirceted the case agents to “mect with the victims to provide them.
with information-regarding the'terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion-of the federal.investigation.”
The case agent told OPR, “(T]here was a discussion that Maric and 1 had as
to... how we would tell:them, and-what.we would tell them, and what'that.was I don’t recall, but:
itv was, the terms of the agreement. ” Villafatia, believed, that: if “victims ‘were ‘properly notified of
the terms [ofthe NPA] that applicd:to them, regarding their, right to seck damages. from. [Epstein],
and he paid those: damages, that. the rest | of the [NPA] doesn’ t need to: be: disclosed. ” Villafaiia
change of: plea [hearing], but that. date: had. not yet been; set by state authorities at the time the first.
victims were notified. [by. the FBI].” Villafafia, told OPR. that it: was her' belief that because’ the
USAO had. agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not: disclose the NPA ‘to the:
general public, but victims could be informed. “because. by its: terms they: needed. to. be told. what.
the agreement was about.” Villafafia told. OPR-that: no one in-her. supervisory chain. cxpressed.a
concern that if victims learned of the’NPA, they-would.try to prevent Epstein.from entering a plea.

Within a-week after the NPA was signed, news media began reporting that. vc ‘partics had
reached a deal to resolve the: Epstein case. For example, on. October 1, 2007, the:
New York Post reported. that. Epstein “has. agreed to plead guilty to:soliciting underage prostitutes
at his Florida mansion. in.a.deal, that will ‘send him. to prison, for about I'8 months,” ‘and. noted. that.
Epstein would plead. guilty in state Court and that “the feds have agreed to.drop their probe into
possible federal criminal violations iti.cxchange ‘for the guilty*pleato the new state charge.”?"!

The case agent recalled informing'some victims that “there was an agreement reached” and.
“we would.not be pursuing’ this federally.” In.October, 2007, for example, the, case agents met with.
victim. Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the main terms of the Non-Prosccution Agrecment’”
According to thé cas¢ agent, during that mecting, the case-agents told Wild “that.an agreement had
been. reached, Mr. Epstein. was going to plead guilty to two state: charges, and. there would not be
a. federal, prosceution.”*"" However, :in a. declaration filed. in 2015 in, the. CVRA litigation, Wild.
described ‘the conversation; differently:

[T]he agents. explained that.Epstcin was also being chargéd.in State
court and.:may plea [sic] to:state charges 1 related to some of his other
