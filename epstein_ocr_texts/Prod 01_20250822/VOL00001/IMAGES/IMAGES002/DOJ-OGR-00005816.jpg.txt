Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document397 Filed 10/29/21 Page 33 of 84
Instead, the Government will seek to offer Dr. Rocchio’s testimony as background in this case.
“Daubert instructs that vigorous cross-examination and the presentation of contrary evidence are
the central tools available to an adversary who wishes to debunk an expert’s testimony.” Randall,
19 Cr. 131 (PAE), Dkt. No. 335 at 37 (internal quotation marks omitted) (citing Daubert, 509 U.S.
at 594-595). Thus, to the extent the defendant wishes to cast doubt on the applicability of Dr.
Rocchio’s background testimony, she is free to do so through cross-examination or by offering
contrary evidence. As discussed above, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony is relevant to helping the jury
understand key issues in the case, like why the Minor Victims may have returned to the defendant
and Epstein without being physically forced to do so, and why they delayed disclosure.

Dr. Rocchio’s testimony.

Government provided notice under Rule 404(b) in the alternative. That same day, the Government
provided the defense with iii. along with copies of all other marked Government
