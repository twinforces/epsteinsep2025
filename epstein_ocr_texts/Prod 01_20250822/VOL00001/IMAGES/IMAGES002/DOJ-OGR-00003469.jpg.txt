Thereafter, in his Deeember 19, 2007 lettcr to defense:counscl, mainly: addressing other
‘matters, Acosta. informed the: defense: that: the USAO would.defer'to'the State:Attorney’s diserction,
the responsibility for notifying victims about; Epstcin’s state:plea hearing:

I understand thatthe defense objects to the victims being given
notice of [the] time and-place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]
sentencing hearing. I, have ‘reviewed the proposed victim
notification Icttcr and.the statute. I would note that:the United States
‘provided the draft letter ‘to the defense asa courtesy. In addition,
First.Assistant United States Attorney Sloman already incorporated
in the letter several cdits that‘had’bcen requested by defense. counsel.
l agree that, Section, 3771. ‘applies tonotice of proecedings and results
of investigations of federal crimes ‘as opposcd to, the state:crime. We
intend to,provide victiinis with notice of the fedéral resolution, as
required bylaw. We will defer to the diseretion ofthe State. Attorney
regarding, whether he wishes to provide victims: with.notice of the
state proceedings, although we will provide him with the
information necessary: to-do so if he wishes.

(Emphasis added.)

Acosta.told OPR that he “would not, have sent this [letter] without‘running it by [Sloman],
if not other individuals in,the office.” Acosta explained. that; it was “not: for’me to direct the State
Attorney, or for our office to, direct the State Attorney’s Office on its obligations with. respect to
the state outcome.” .Acosta acknowledged that.the USAO initially had:concerns about'the state’s
handling of the case, but he told. OPR, “that doesn’t mean that they will. not fulfill whatever
obligation they have. Let’s not assume. . .. that the State Attorney’s office is full of bad actors.”
Sloman, initially believed that “the victims were, going’ tobe, notified. at some level, especially
because they had ‘restitution-rights under [§] 2255”; but his expectations changed after “there was
an. agreement made ‘that we'were going to. allow ‘the state, sitice it Was going to. be a state cas¢, to
decide how the victims were going to be notified. »417 Sloman told.OPR he had been.‘ “proceeding
under the belict that: we ‘were going’ to notify the victims,” even though, “this was not a federal
case,” but-once the NPA. “looked like it was. going'to fall apart, the USAO “had concerns that if
we gla]ve' them, the victim. notification Ictter'. . . and.the deal. fell. apart; then. the victims would be
instantly impeached bythe provision that youre. entitled to monctary compensation.”

OPR. could not determine whether the State Attorney’s: Office notified. any victims jin,
advance ofthe June 30, 2008 state plea hearing.. Krischer'told OPR that the State Attorney’s Office
had. a‘robust; and. effective victim notification :process and staff, but he was not ‘aware of whether:
or how it’was used in the Epstein. ease. Belohlavek told OPR ‘that. she, could. not’ recall whether
vietims ‘were notified of’ the hearing nor ‘whether the state law. required notification for the

417 Sloman, stated :in ‘his June 3, 2008 letter to: Deputy Attorney: General Filip that Acosta made the decision
together with the; ‘Department’ s Criminal Division Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mandelker. Acosta did consult:
with Mandelker, about the §: 2255’ civil damages recov cry process, but neither Acosta nor ‘Mandelker ‘recalled
discussing, the issue of-victim notifications and OPR.found no other-documentation indicating that Mandelker played
a role in'the deferral decision.
