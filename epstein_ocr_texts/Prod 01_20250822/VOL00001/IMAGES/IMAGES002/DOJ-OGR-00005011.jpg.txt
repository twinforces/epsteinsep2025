Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully:submits this letter pursuant to the Court’s Order dated August

Detention, Center (“MDC”) and ‘to file a response to the defense’s letter dated August 18,2021
(Dkt. No. 319). The Government has conferred. with, legal counsel atthe MDC, and this Ictter is
based on information provided 'to, the Government during that conferral.

As the Court. is aware, over the past several months, the defendant has: been provided with.
counsel has assured the Government that no MDC staff members have interfered ‘with, recorded,
‘or. otherwise listened to the defendant’s V.TC meetings with counsel.

Previously, ‘the defendant’s VTC sessions with. counsel were conducted. over a WebEx
connection generated by defense counsel. Recently, however, the. MDG determined that the “use
‘ofa VIC connection generated outside of the Burcau of.Prisons (“BOP”) system. posed a security
threat and could more casily be accessed by third-parties than'a, VTC. connection, generated by: the
BOP itself. In order to address that security concern, the MDC provided its own BOP-gencrated

VTC virtual room for the defendant and her attorneys to use.
