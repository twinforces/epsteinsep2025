Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter pursuant to the Court’s Order dated August
19, 2021 (Dkt. No. 321) directing the Government to confer with legal counsel at the Metropolitan
Detention Center (“MDC”) and to file a response to the defense’s letter dated August 18, 2021
(Dkt. No. 319). The Government has conferred with legal counsel at the MDC, and this letter is
based on information provided to the Government during that conferral.

As the Court is aware, over the past several months, the defendant has been provided with
five hours of video-teleconference (“WTC”) calls with her attorneys every weekday. MDC legal
counsel has assured the Government that no MDC staff members have interfered with, recorded,
or otherwise listened to the defendant’s VTC meetings with counsel.

Previously, the defendant’s VTC sessions with counsel were conducted over a WebEx
connection generated by defense counsel. Recently, however, the MDC determined that the use
of a VTC connection generated outside of the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”) system posed a security
threat and could more easily be accessed by third parties than a VTC connection generated by the
BOP itself. In order to address that security concern, the MDC provided its own BOP-generated
VTC virtual room for the defendant and her attorneys to use.
