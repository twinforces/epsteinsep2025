Interactions between a prosecutor and a criminal defendant, including
circumstances where the latter seeks enforcement of some promise or assurance made

precepts of contract law, which inform the due process inquiry. The applicability of
contract law to aspects of the criminal law has been recognized by the Supreme Court of
the United States, see Puckett v. United States, 556 U.S. 129, 137 (2009), by the United

aggrieved party must prove that: (1) the promisor acted in a manner that he or she should

action; (2) the aggrieved party actually took such action; and (3) an injustice would result
if the assurance that induced the action was not enforced. See Crouse v. Cyclops Indus.,
745 A.2d 606, 610 (Pa. 2000).

In Martinez, we reexamined the enforceability of terms of plea agreements made
by prosecutors pertaining to the applicability of sexual offender registration obligations.
There, three defendants entered into plea bargains with the Commonwealth, each of
which was formulated in a way that either limited or eliminated the defendantsâ€™ obligations
under the then-applicable sexual offender registration statute. Martinez, 147 A.3d at 521-
22. However, after some time, our General Assembly enacted the first version of SORNA,
which fundamentally altered the registration and reporting obligations of sexual offenders,
including those of the three offenders in Martinez. Each defendant was notified by the
