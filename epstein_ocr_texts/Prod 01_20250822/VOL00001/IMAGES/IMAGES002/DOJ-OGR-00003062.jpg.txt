The defendant’s claim that her-act of:production privilege-was somchow violated similarly

Boyd, 116.U.S. at.634-35). In dnre Grand Airy Suibpoéna Diuces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, 1992, the
‘Second Circuit ruled that the Fifth.Amendment does not.protect the contents of private papers:that
are not. business documents, and. also noted. that “[s]everal aspects of the Boyd decision, did. not
endure.” ‘1 F.3d at.90 (citing Fisher v. United States, 425, U.S. 391 (1976)).

Further, the Fifth-Amendment docs not protect against being compelled to speak: and then.

government:misconduct, that testimony:may still-be used to prosecute. that defendant for-perjury.”
United States v. Olivieri, T40 F, Supp. 2d 423, 425 (S.D:NLY. 2010) (citing: United States y.
Remington, 208 F.2d.567 (2d Cir. 1953); United States v. Winter, 348 F.2d,204 (2d. Cir. 1965)):
see.also United States v. Wong, 43.1 U.S. 174, 180 (1.977) (“[P]erjury:is not a permissible: way of
objecting to the Government’s questions. ... . Indeed, even if the Government could, on pain of
criminal. sanctions, compel an answer ‘to its incriminating questions, a citizen is ‘riot at. liberty to
answer falscly.”); Bryson v. United States, 396 U.S. 64, 72, 90 (1.969) (rejecting challenge to false
‘statement’ prosecution; “[I]t cannot; be thought;that'as a general principle of. ourlaw a citizen.has a.
privilege ‘to answer fraudulently a question that the Government should not. have asked. .. A,
citizen, may decline to answer the question, or answer it honestly, but he cannot: with impunity:

knowingly and ‘willfully. answer'with a, falschood.”).
