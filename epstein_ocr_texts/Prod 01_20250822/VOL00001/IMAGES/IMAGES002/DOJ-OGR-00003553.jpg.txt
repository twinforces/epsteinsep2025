Sccond, any-presumption.against modification ofa protective order'is unreasonable where,
as here, the: protective order is on its face temporary or limited. Such protective orders “that :are
on their face temporary or limited may not justify reliance by the partics [and] in. such.
cireumstanccs reliance ‘may, be unreasonable.” S.C. vu. TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d 222, 230-31 (2d.
Cir. 2001). “Whereva litigant or deponent could. not reasonably have relicd on the continuation, of
a. protective order”’—for example, where such. an. order’ was limited.'to the: pretrial stages of
litigation a court. may’ ‘properly permit modification,of the order.” Jd. (citing Jn re “Agent
Orange” Prod. Liab. Litig. , 821°F.2d 139, 147:(2d Cir. 1987)), seevalso Allen. City of New York,
420 F.Supp.2d.295, 301 (S.D.N-Y..2006) (Mag..J. Gorenstein) (analyzing the differently- situated.
interests. of civil litigants ‘but ‘where, as here, the relevant; protective: order ‘specified, that’a, party.
could object: to the designation of a document as confidential, and ‘was, also temporary or limited

original) (citing Inve Agent Orange, 821 F.3d.at 147) (additional, citations omitted). ‘Here, the
parties in the Litigation ‘explicitly. contemplated, the public: disclosure of such information at, ‘trial,

In. this case, where the Protective Order is limited bya its terms to only the ‘pretrial stages
the victims of the suspected. crimes: being investigated have indicated a. willingness to voluntarily
comply with the Subpoena, the “sound discretion ‘of [this] court,” 7AeStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 231,
militates overwhelmingly toward, limited, narrow modification of the Protective Order to’ ‘permit
compliance ‘with the Subpocna.” This is consistent with the grand jury’s “wide ranging authority

that the proposed orden accompanying the Application. provides no additional execption or
modification. to the: Protective Order as to the recipient of the subpoena other than the narrow,
limited. ability to comply with grand jury process. The Protective Order will remain otherwise
intact and fully enforecable.
