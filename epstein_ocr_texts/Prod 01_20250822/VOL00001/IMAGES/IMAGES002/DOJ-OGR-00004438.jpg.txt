until aftcr Epstein, completed his sentence, but:that: Krischer would oppose such a.pctition, “if it is

release was “within, the control of the Sheriff’s Office, not my office.” ‘The state’s plea agreement.

The day after Epstein entered | his June 30, 2008 plea, Villafaria and her immediate
Villafana, the official told them, “Epstein would be eligible for work release and. will be laced on
work: release,” “a statement. that; contradicted the information the case agents, had been given by:a.
jail supervisor the previous November, as well as statements made by defense attorney Jack
Goldberger to Villafafia just days before the plea ‘was. entered, ‘when. he “specifically told
[Villafatia] that [Epstein] would..7o0t get work.:release.” Villafafia alerted, the: Sheriff's Office
official that, although Epstein told the court, during his’ olca procecding that he had worked “every,
day” for a ‘couple of years” at the “Florida, Science Foundation,” that entity did, not even, exist:

work’ release, and, he would ‘not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained, that the USAO
expected Epstcin would be “treated just like, everyone else,” but'that, as shown by “our subsequent.
communications with the [S]tate [A]ttorney’s [O]ffice,” having Epstein. on-work release “was not
what our office envisioned.”

and, Sloman that -Black: assured her he ‘had “reminded. the team that . . . 18:months IN JAIL: isa.
material term:of the agreement.”
