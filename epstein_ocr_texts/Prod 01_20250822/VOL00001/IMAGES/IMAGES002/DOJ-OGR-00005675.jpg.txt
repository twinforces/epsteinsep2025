II. Evidence Related. to Accuser-3:Is Not'Proof of the Charged Conspiracies

Accuser-3’s, allegations, Which. pertain, only to the Mann Act conspiracies charged :in
Counts One and Three of the $2 Indictment, are irrelevant to the charged conspiracies and do not
offer any ‘proof supporting those charges. ‘The S2. Indictment-alleges that Ms. Maxwell conspired
with Epstein to (i) violate 18 U.S.C. § 2422(a), with the objective of enticing one‘or more:
individuals to travel in interstate and foreign, commerce for the purpose of engaging in-unlawful
sexual activity (S2 Indictment 49) 11-12); and, (ii). violate: 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with ‘the objective
of transporting, an individual under age 18 withthe intent'that:the individual. engage in unlawful
sexual, activity (id: 49, 17-18). As an, overt aet in furtherance of these conspiracies, ‘the:
government alleges 'that.Ms. Maxwell “cnéouraged [Accuscr-3] to provide massages to Epstein
in, London, England, knowing ‘that‘Epstein intended to sexwally abuse [Accuser-3] during. those:
massages.” Jd. 49) 13(d),19(d) (emphasis added). The Indictment further alleges that Epstein
“sexually abused” Accuser-3../d.. ¥ 9c.

There is no cogent basis for the government to assert. that.Accuscr=3’s allegations are
direct evidence of the charged conspiracies. The object. of the alleged conspiracies was to entice
or cause ‘one or more minors to travel in. interstate or. forcign.commerce in. order to engage in
unlawful sexual activity. The government: concedes that Accuser-3 (1) was not a:minor under:
U.K. law*when. she allegedly engaged in. séx, acts with Epstein in.London, (2) cannot establish,
that she was invited to travel to: the United. States when she was ‘under the age: of 18, and (3)
cannot establish that; she was a'minor when she’ allegedly. engaged in sex’ acts with Epstein in, the
United States. See Gov’t Mem. in.Opp. to Def.’s. Pretrial. Motions (Dkt. 204): at 158-59, 162-163:
& nn.57-58. Accuser-3 will therefore not provide-any proof that Ms.’ Maxwell “furthered” an,
alleged conspiracy to cause minors to travel for the purpose of engaging ‘in wnlawftil sexual

activity: Accordingly, the conduct she alleges is not “within the scope ofthe conspiracy” and.
