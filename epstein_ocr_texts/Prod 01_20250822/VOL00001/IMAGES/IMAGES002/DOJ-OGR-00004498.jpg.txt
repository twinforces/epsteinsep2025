The sexual-offender registration provision, is yct another cxample-of how Acosta’s decision,
to create. an unorthodox mechanism that relicd. on state procedures to resolve the federal
investigation lcd to unanticipated conscquences benefitting Epstcin. Acosta told:OPR that one of
the Core aspeets of the NPA. was the :requirement ‘that Epstein. plead guilty to a state charge
requiring registration as.a-scxual offender. He cited it as aprovision that he: insisted on:from the
beginning and from which he never wavered. However, the USAO failed to anticipate certain,
factors that.affected the sexual offender registration. requirement in other states where Epstein had.
aresidenee. Tn selecting the conduct for the factual, basis for the crime ‘requiring sexual, offender:
registration, the state chose conduct involving a victim who was at. least ‘16 at. the time of her
‘interactions with Epstein, cven though Epstein also had sexual contact'with.a 14- -year old victim.
The victim’s age made a difference, as the age: of consent in. New Mexico, where: Epstein had.a
residence, was. 16; therefore, Epstein. was ‘not ‘required, to register in that.state. As a 2006 Ictter
from:defense counsel Lefcourt to the State Attorney’s, Office made clear, the defense ‘team, had,
thoroughly réscarched the details and ‘ramifications of Florida’s sexual. offender registration
requirement; OPR. did not find. evidence indicating similar rescarch and consideration by the

Finally,. Acosta, was. well aware that the PBP-D brought the case to the FBI’s attention,
because of a concern that: the State Attorney’s Office had succumbed to “pressure” from defense
counsel. Villafaia.told OPR that she informed both.Acosta.and Sloman.of this‘whén.she met with.
them at the start.of the federal investigation. Although Acosta. did not-remember the mecting with.
Villafafia, he repeatedly told OPR. during his intervicw that he was aware: that the PBPD. was
dissatisfied with the State Attorncy’s Office’s handling of the case. Shortly before'the NPA was
signed, morcover, additional information. came to light that suggested the State Attorney’s Office
was predisposed to manipulating. ‘the. ‘proccss’ in Epstein? s favor. Specifically, during the
September ‘12, 2007 mecting, at the. state ‘prosccutor’s suggestion, the USAO. team agreed, with.
Acosta’s subsequent approval, to permit. Epstein to plead. guilty to‘one state charge of solicitation.
of ‘minors to engage: in, prostitution, ‘rather than the three charges the USAO had originally:
‘specificd. The state: prosecutor assured, Lourie, that the selected. charge would, require Epstein, to
register'as asexual offender. Shortly thercafter, the USAO was told by defense:counscel that.despite
the assurances made ‘to Loutic, the state. prosceutor had. advised Epstcin—incorrectly, it turned
out—that.a plea to that particular offense would. nor require: him'to register as a scxual offender.
Yet, despite this evidence, which, atleast: suggested that the state authorities should not have been,
considered, to be a reliable partner. ‘in, enforeing the NPA, Acosta did not alter his decision, about:
proceeding with a ‘process ‘that: depended. completely: on. ‘state authorities: for: its successful
execution.

OPR. finds that Acosta ‘was reasonably aware ‘of the facts' and. circumstances: presented: by:
this case. He stated that he engaged iin, discussions. about various aspects of the case with, Sloman,
and Menchel, and relied upon them for their evaluation, of the Icgal.and. evidentiary issues and for:
their assessment of trial issucs. Acosta Was copicd on. many substantive cmails, reviewed and
revised drafts of the NPA, and approved the final agreement. Yct, rather than. focusing on whether
the state’s prosccution was; sufficient to satisfy the federal interest in. prosecuting Epstein, Acosta.
focused on achicving the minimum outcome necessary to satisfy the s/ufe’s interest, as defined in,
part: by the state’s indictment, by using’ the threat of a federal prosecution to dictate the terms of
