he is comfortable before proceeding.” Menchel told Villafafia he had “trouble understanding” why
she was in a “rush” “given how long this case has been pending.”

OPR questioned Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta about the timeline for reviewing
the prosecution memorandum and the proposed charges. Acosta and Menchel believed Villafafia’s
timeline was unrealistic from the start. Acosta told OPR that Villafafia was “very hard charging,”
but her timeline for filing charges in the case was “really, really fast.” Menchel described Villafafia
as “out over her skis a little bit” and “ahead of” Acosta in terms of his analysis of the case.*
Menchel said it was clear to him that Acosta “was going to be the one making the call” about
whether to go forward with charges, and Acosta needed more time to make a decision. Menchel
told OPR, “This [was] not a case [we were] going to review in two weeks and make a decision
on.” Sloman told OPR that although he did not conduct a “granular review” of the proposed
charges, he believed Menchel and Lourie had done so and “obviously” had concluded that “the
facts and the law didn’t suggest that the right thing to do was to automatically indict.” Lourie told
OPR that he believed “the case was moving ahead.”

Villafafia continued to seek direction from her managers. On May 15, 2007, she emailed
Sloman, noting that “[i]t seemed from our discussion yesterday that pestering Alex [Acosta] will
not do any good. Am I right about that?” Sloman responded, “Yes.” On May 21, 2007, three
weeks after submitting the prosecution memorandum, Villafafia emailed Sloman and Menchel
asking for “a sense of the direction where we are headed-i.e., approval of an indictment something
like the current draft, a complaint to allow for pre-indictment negotiations, an indictment
drastically different from the current draft?” Sloman responded only, “Taken care of.’

D. Defense Counsel Seek a Meeting with Senior USAO Managers, which

Villafatia Opposes

Meanwhile, Epstein’s defense counsel continued to seek additional information about the
federal investigation and a meeting with senior USAO managers, including Acosta. In a May 10,
2007 email to Menchel, Lourie reported that Epstein’s attorneys “want me to tell them the statutes
aa Villafafia explained to OPR that the “rush” related to her concern that Epstein was continuing to abuse girls:
“Tn terms of the issue of why the hurry, because child sex offenders don’t stop until they’re behind bars. That was our
time concern.” Menchel, however, told OPR that he did not recall Villafafia offering this explanation to him. OPR
notes that in their respective statements to OPR and in their comments on OPR’s draft report, Menchel and Villafafia
expressed contradictory accounts or interpretations of certain events. When it was necessary for OPR to resolve those
conflicts in order to reach its findings and conclusions, OPR considered the extensive documentary record and the
testimony of other subjects and witnesses, to the extent available.

a Sloman similarly recalled that Menchel thought Villafafia was “ahead of where the office was internally” and
that caused “discontent” between Villafafia and Menchel. Villafafia was not the only one, however, who was surprised
that the indictment was not approved immediately. The case agent told OPR that it seemed “everything changed”
after Villafafia submitted the prosecution memorandum, and the momentum towards an indictment abated. Villafafia’s
immediate supervisor told OPR that from her perspective, it appeared “Miami didn’t want the case prosecuted.”
However, Menchel rebuked Villafafia in his July 5, 2007 email to her for having “led the agents to believe that [filing
charges in] this matter was a foregone conclusion.”

46 Sloman could not recall during his OPR interview what he meant by this remark, but he speculated that he
had spoken to Menchel, and Menchel was going to take care of it.
