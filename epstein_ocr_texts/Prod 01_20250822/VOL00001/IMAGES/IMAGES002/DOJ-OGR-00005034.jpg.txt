improper to issuc a.Rule'17(c) subpoena where the sole ‘relevance of the requested:materials is
impeachment. There is no ‘plausible claim that inspection of the original photographs is
warranted, and to the extent that Maxwell secks the photographs in ‘order. to disprove their
authenticity (and challenge any potential testimony that might be ‘advanecd at trial), the request. is
entirely speculative. Even assuming that impeachment. could permissibly establish relevance, the
argument ‘fails because Maxwell does: not :yet’know the scope of the victim’s testimony ‘or
whether it will implicate the photographs.

Finally, the request for:matcrials related:to the Epstein. Victim Compensation Fund :is
denicd.for substantially the same reasons the Court.articulated ‘in its April, 27, 2021 Opinion. See
Dkt. No. 252, April 27, 20211. Op., at:6-8. Here, too, Maxwell has failed.to establish the
materials’ relevance. The bricfing makes clear that Maxwell seeks these documents for mere
impeachment:purposes,, which, again. docs. not warrant issuance or enforcement of a Rule: 17(c)
subpocna. Furthermore, to the extent that Maxwell hinges her theory of relevance on the
possibility: that these documents may contain some exculpatory evidence, the request is entirely
speculative. The “mere hope?” that.documents might:produce some: degree of exculpatory’
evidence is also insufficient. See. United States v. Rich, No. S 83-CR-579 (SWK),, 1984 WL 845,
at *3.(S.D.N.Y..Scpt.’7, 1984). Maxwell‘has proffered no plausible basis why these materials
might, be exculpatory beyond her’thcory that they will help her undermine the potential witness’s
eredibility:

In.sum, for the reasons. stated, by the Court:in its April 27, 2021 and June 2,,.2021 orders,

the request for authorization of a.Rule.1.7(c) subpoena to Subpocna Recipicnt-1 is DENIED.
