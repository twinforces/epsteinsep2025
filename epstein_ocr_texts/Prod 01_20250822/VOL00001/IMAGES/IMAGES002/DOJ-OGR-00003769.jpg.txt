which effectuates the Sixth Amendment right to a fair cross-section, notes that the relevant
“community” is “the community in the district or division wherein the court convenes.” 28
U.S.C. § 1861. Here, that is either the Manhattan Counties or the Southern District, as this Court
is not “convening” in White Plains.

Even United States v. Bahna, 68 F.3d 19 (2d Cir. 1995), on which the government
heavily relies, recognizes this: “Each [court] selects grand and petit juries pursuant to a plan. . .
and, as a general rule, selections are made from the area surrounding the courthouse where the
case is to be tried.” Id. at 23 (emphases added). The government points to the Second Circuit’s
statement that “[w]here a jury venire is drawn from a properly designated division, we look to
that division to see whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of
minorities.” Opp. 201 (quoting Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24) (emphasis added by government). But the
defendant in Bahna was tried on Long Island before a jury “from the ‘Long Island Division’ jury
wheel.” 68 F.3d at 23. He initially sought to have a jury “culled only from Kings, Queens and
Richmond Counties” —1.e., from somewhere other than the place of trial. /d. at 26. Ms.
Maxwell seeks precisely the opposite.

The government thus quotes the Second Circuit’s statement in Bahna out of context,
because Bahna was based on the very premise lacking here: a jury “drawn from a properly
designated division.” /d. at 24. Unlike the Long Island Division in Bahna, White Plains was not
“properly designated” to indict Ms. Maxwell.

While the government claims that “it is common for cases to be indicted by grand juries
sitting in the White Plains courthouse and tried in the Manhattan courthouse”—an assertion that
has no bearing on the lawfulness of such a practice, particularly if not objected to—it cites just
six such cases in the last 17 years. Opp. 195. The far more typical practice of using a grand jury
