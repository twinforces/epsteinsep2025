the CVRA litigation and in,more recent media. reports, ‘victims. ‘complained that ‘they were not’
informed. about. the: government’s intention to end its investigation of Epstein. because: the

VICTIMS.

During the CVRA litigation, the,government acknowledged that the USAO did:not consult:
with ‘victims about. the government’s intention to cnter:into the NPA. Jn ‘its February’21, 2019

finding. as part of its investigation into the USAOQ’s handling’ of the Epstein case, and examined.
whether, ‘before the: NPA, was signed on September 24,2007, federal prosecutors were obligated.
‘to consult with victims, under'the CVRA, and if'so, whether any of the subject. attorncys=A costa,
