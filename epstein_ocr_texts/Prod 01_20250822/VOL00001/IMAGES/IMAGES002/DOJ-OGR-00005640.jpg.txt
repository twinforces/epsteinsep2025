4. Roccio’s grooming opinions are substantially more prejudicial than
probative.

Rocchio’s proposed testimony is also, inadmissiblé under Rule 403. For one'thing, it’will
“radically:simplify” an otherwise complex case. See Vnited.States:v. Burns, No. 07 CR. 556,
2009 WE 361.7448, at;*5 (N.D. Ill. Oct. 27, 2009) (criticizing the “grooming theory” in inthe
context of'a sentencing guidelines calculation). As the Court explained in United States v. Burns,
Rocchio’s “grooming theory” can “foist a damning'telcology on a.scries of actions cach ‘of which
might.have been motivated by:a.varicty of chds or no ends atall ..... radically simplifyi[ng] the
mess of.. . competing ‘feclings, urges, and:needs over the course of'[a] relationship:into the neat
dichotomy of victim, and:predator.” Jd. See Gonyer, 2012. WL 3043020, at * 3 (to describe the
so-called “attributes of a sexual predator” is to “invite the jury to.so label a defendant” a sexual
predator).

For another'thing, her, testimony “runs the:risk, of creating a false sense: of expert:
infallibility in.an atca of testimony that has:not been:subjected:to scientific serutiny.” Gover,
2012 WL 3043020, at: * 3.(citing Raymond, 700'F.Supp.2d at 150 (“a toxic mixture of purported
expertise and common sense”)). This is particularly: true given the Supreme Court’s, recognition
that “[c]xpert evidence can be both powerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in
evaluating it.” Daubert, 509. U.S. at598.

Were there any doubt.about the reliability or relevance of Rocchio’s grooming opinions,

which there isn’t, the Court should. still. exclude:her. testimony under. Rule 403.
