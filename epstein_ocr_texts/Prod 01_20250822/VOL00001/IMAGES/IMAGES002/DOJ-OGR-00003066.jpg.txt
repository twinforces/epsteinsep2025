government behavior, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of substantive due
process, must be the guide for analyzing these claims.” County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S.
833, 842 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted); Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 272 (1993)
(“[t]he protections of substantive due process have for the most part been accorded to matters
relating to marriage, family, procreation, and the right to bodily integrity.”).

The defendant bears the “‘very heavy’ burden of establishing a due process violation.”
United States v. Walters, 910 F.3d 11, 27 (2d Cir. 2018). “To succeed on a claim that the
government’s conduct in pursuit of evidence violates a defendant’s Fifth Amendment due process
rights, the government’s method of acquiring the evidence must be so egregious that it ‘shocks the
conscience.”” United States v. Loera, 333 F. Supp. 3d 172, 184 (E.D.N.Y. 2018) (internal

or shocking to our traditional sense of justice, or conduct that is ‘so outrageous’ that common
notions of fairness and decency would be offended were judicial processes invoked to obtain a
conviction against the accused.” United States v. Schmidt, 105 F.3d 82, 91 (2d Cir. 1997) (internal
quotation marks and citations omitted). “Such outrageous or conscience shocking behavior
involves egregious invasions of individual rights, or coercion.” United States v. Coke, No. 07 Cr.
971 (RPP), 2011 WL 3738969, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 22, 2011) (internal quotation marks and
citations omitted). The Second Circuit has explained:

The paradigm examples of conscience-shocking conduct are
egregious invasions of individual rights. See, e.g., Rochin, 342 U.S.
at 172, 72 S. Ct. 205 (breaking into suspect’s bedroom, forcibly
attempting to pull capsules from his throat, and pumping his
stomach without his consent). Especially in view of the courts’
well-established deference to the Government’s choice of
investigatory methods, see United States v. Myers, 692 F.2d 823,
843 (2d Cir. 1982), the burden of establishing outrageous
