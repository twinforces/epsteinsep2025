1 enforce the confidentiality appropriately.

2 Now, with those preliminary thoughts in mind I am

3 going to deny the motion at this time because I know that there
4 is a statement, some kind of a statement from the mediator in

5 the Florida action. When I get a piece of paper that says the
6 Florida action is dismissed, a court order or whatever, then

7 this motion can be renewed.

8 Also, I want an affidavit from the two lawyers that

9 there is no matter in which they are personally involved, that
10 they are making no claim, there is no claims, there is no

Le litigation in which they are involved. The reason I say that
12 is that I would not grant the application for a pro hac status
13 to a party in this or a related litigation. If I get those
14 affidavits and the statement about the closure of the Florida
LS case in which they are a party, then the application can be

16 renewed and at that point I would be probably inclined, unless
cy something else comes up or unless the defense tells me

18 something that I don't now know, I would grant the application
a We. that brings us to the order itself and the meaning of the
20 order. I think active in the litigation is the key phrase.
21 The plaintiff has listed the people that she considers would be
22 appropriate and it's these two gentleman and I think one other
23. person, and that's fine. That is the definition.
24 However, I'm also going to ask the parties to agree
25 upon an order that would expand the confidentiality agreement
