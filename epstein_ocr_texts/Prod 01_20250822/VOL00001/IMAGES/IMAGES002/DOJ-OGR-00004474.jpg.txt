reconsider the:provision., Acosta-could.certainly:have modified.or climinated.the provision entirely’
iffhis ‘motivation was to benefit Epstcin or Epstcin’s. attorneys.

Second, Epstein himself was ‘not satisfied with the NPA. lmméediately after signing the
agreement, he sought to have the: Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement. in. the
inyestigation inappropriate. In, addition to repeatedly:attacking the NPA. in his submissions to the:
Department, Epstein added,'to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of
misconduct. and improper bias on the ‘part: of specific: USAO personnel. Epstcin’s dissatisfaction,
with the NPA, and his personal. attacks, on, individual :prosceutors. involved in. negotiating the
agreement, appear inconsistent:witha:conclusion that the subjects. designed the NPA for Epstcin’s
benefit.

D. OPR Doés Not Find That:the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense
Counsel, Decisions: to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors
Established That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided.
Improper Benefits to Epstein.

In.cvaluating the:subjcets” conduct,:OPR considered various other factors featured in media,
aécounts. to show that the subjcets. provided improper bencfits to Epstein or which purportedly

improper motivation. ;

1. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended. Any:
‘Improper Benefit to. Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships
with His Attorneys

Epstein’s, wealth enabled him, to, hire ‘multiple attorneys who: had ‘precxisting personal
connections, to, some of ‘the, government attorneys itivelved in. his case, :in ‘the, State Attorney’s
Office, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the attomeys Epstein. selected
to represent him, a reasonable: inference: can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring attorneys
with, relationships to the prosecutors. would be beneficial to him. One of the first attorneys who
contacted the USAO on Epstcin’s behalf' was Guy’ Lewis, a. former AUSA. in and U.S. Attorney’
for the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked. for Lewis, and Lourié was
close friends with oneof Lewis’s law partners. Epstcin also retained Lilly.Ann Sanchez, a former
AUSA who had been Menchel:’s deputy and. with. whom ‘he had socialized. ‘Later, when Epstein.
was ‘sccking Acosta’s ‘personal involvement .in, the case, Epstein hired.“Kenneth Starr and. Jay:
Lefkowitz, prominent attorneys. from, Kirkland & Ellis with, whom Acosta, was acquainted from,
his previous employment with that. firm.

Villafafia. told. OPR. that she believed. Acosta. “was influenced. by the stature of Epstcin’s
attorncys.” Critically, however, other. than the information,regarding: Menchel that is discussed jin,
the ‘following ‘subsection, neither ‘Villafafia.:nor any of the, other ‘individuals OPR. intervicwed.
identified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended. an
improper favor or benefit ‘to Epstein. because of a persorial relationship with, defensé courisel (oF
for. any: other improper reason). Villafafia explained how, in her view, the “legal prowess” of
Epstein’s attorneys had an, impact on the case:
