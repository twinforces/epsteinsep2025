reconsider the provision. Acosta could certainly have modified or eliminated the provision entirely
if his motivation was to benefit Epstein or Epstein’s attorneys.

Second, Epstein himself was not satisfied with the NPA. Immediately after signing the
agreement, he sought to have the Department nullify it by declaring federal involvement in the
investigation inappropriate. In addition to repeatedly attacking the NPA in his submissions to the
Department, Epstein added to his evidentiary challenges and federalism claims allegations of
misconduct and improper bias on the part of specific USAO personnel. Epstein’s dissatisfaction
with the NPA, and his personal attacks on individual prosecutors involved in negotiating the
agreement, appear inconsistent with a conclusion that the subjects designed the NPA for Epstein’s
benefit.

D. OPR Does Not Find That the Subjects’ Preexisting Relationships with Defense

Counsel, Decisions to Meet with Defense Counsel, and Other Factors
Established That the Subjects Acted from Improper Influences or Provided
Improper Benefits to Epstein

In evaluating the subjects’ conduct, OPR considered various other factors featured in media
accounts to show that the subjects provided improper benefits to Epstein or which purportedly
suggested that the subjects acted from improper influences. OPR examined these factors but did
not find that they supported a finding that the subjects were influenced by favoritism, bias, or other
improper motivation.

1. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects Extended Any
Improper Benefit to Epstein because of Their Preexisting Relationships
with His Attorneys

Epstein’s wealth enabled him to hire multiple attorneys who had preexisting personal
connections to some of the government attorneys involved in his case, in the State Attorney’s
Office, in the USAO, and elsewhere in the Department. Based on the attorneys Epstein selected
to represent him, a reasonable inference can be drawn that Epstein believed that hiring attorneys
with relationships to the prosecutors would be beneficial to him. One of the first attorneys who
contacted the USAO on Epstein’s behalf was Guy Lewis, a former AUSA in and U.S. Attorney
for the Southern District of Florida. Villafafia and Lourie had worked for Lewis, and Lourie was
close friends with one of Lewis’s law partners. Epstein also retained Lilly Ann Sanchez, a former
AUSA who had been Menchel’s deputy and with whom he had socialized. Later, when Epstein
was seeking Acosta’s personal involvement in the case, Epstein hired Kenneth Starr and Jay
Lefkowitz, prominent attorneys from Kirkland & Ellis with whom Acosta was acquainted from
his previous employment with that firm.

Villafafia told OPR that she believed Acosta “was influenced by the stature of Epstein’s
attorneys.” Critically, however, other than the information regarding Menchel that is discussed in
the following subsection, neither Villafafia nor any of the other individuals OPR interviewed
identified any specific evidence suggesting that Acosta, or any of the other subjects, extended an
improper favor or benefit to Epstein because of a personal relationship with defense counsel (or
for any other improper reason). Villafafia explained how, in her view, the “legal prowess” of
Epstein’s attorneys had an impact on the case:
