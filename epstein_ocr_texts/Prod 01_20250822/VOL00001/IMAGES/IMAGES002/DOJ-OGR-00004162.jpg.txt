Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 285 Filed 05/20/21 Page 27 of 34

Maxwell had a due process right to notice and an opportunity to be heard on the
government’s request to modify the Protective Order and issue a subpoena to Boies Schiller.
Mot. Ex. A, §] 14 (permitting modification of the Protective Order only “for good cause shown
following notice to all parties and an opportunity to be heard”); Mot. Ex. H (Judge Netburn
denying the government’s ex parte request to modify the Jane Doe 43 Protective Order in part
because the government was attempting to deprive Maxwell of notice and an opportunity to be

government violated these rights when it secured an ex parte modification of the Protective
Order based on materially false statements to Judge McMahon. In resisting any sanction for its
misconduct, and in denying that Maxwell should even be afforded a hearing, the government
asks this Court to “condon|[e] a fraud perpetrated upon it.” See Cortina, 630 F.2d at 1214.

Protective Order if AUSA |g had been candid about Boies Schiller’s role in initiating
the investigation. As Judge McMahon put it, “the only thing on which Maxwell . . . might
reasonably have relied is that Giuffre or her lawyers” would not approach prosecutors and
“foment the Government’s investigation.” Mot. Ex. G, p 21. I. That is, in fact, exactly what
happened. As in Cortina, the modification of the Protective Order “never should have taken
place.” Jd. When, as here, a prosecutor—from the public corruption unit no less—misrepresents
