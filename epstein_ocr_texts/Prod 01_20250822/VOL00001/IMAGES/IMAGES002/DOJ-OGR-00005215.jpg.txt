to ask jurors if they or a family member have ever been a victim of sexual abuse—a question that
most jurors will not be inclined to answer in public. In a case that has received media attention or

the odds of obtaining a fair jury. The paradox is that a larger panel can mean that jurors are even

this, q questionnaire alone is insufficient.

specific (e.g., harassment, molestation, unwanted sexual contact, sexual assault, rape, domestic
