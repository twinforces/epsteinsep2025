Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document388 Filed 10/29/21 Page 8of14

Maxwell, did-not Icave the country, or make plans to'leave the country, at-any point in the year
that clapsed, between Epstein’s arrest and, hér own. arrest. Moreover, the government, can. offertio
proof to counter the evidence proffered. by Ms. Maxwell.in her bail:submission and. instead relies
on its vague and.unsubstantiated “belief” that these actions reveal. Ms. Maxwell’s intent to cvade
law enforcement. See 12/18/2020 Gov't Mem. if Opp. to Def?s, Renewed Mot. for Release. (Dkt.
100) at 21 (“[T]here is still reason to believe that the defendant was hiding not:just from. the
press, but:also ‘from law enforcement.”). Any evidence or argument regarding’Ms. Maxwell’s
purported “flight” or consciousness of guilt lacks. any: factual foundation.and would be highly:

prejudicial. It should therefore be exeluded.*

ARGUMENT
I. Applicable Law:

“[I]t is widely acknowledged that evidence of flight or related conduct:is ‘only
marginally probative as to the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence.’” United States v. Myers, 550
F.2d 1036, 1049 (5" Cir: '1977) (quoting United States v. Robinson, 475 F.2d 376, 384 (D.C. Cir,
1973)). While flight.can, in some circumstances, evidence consciousness of guilt, “a satisfactory:
factual predicate must exist from which, the jury can infer consciousness of guilt from flight”
before such. evidence may properly be admitted. 4/-Sudawi, 432. F.3d,at:424 (citations omitted).
“Since flight. cvidence ‘can. be powerful, the requirement of a sufficient factual predicate ‘ensures
that the evidence is probative ina, legal sense: and protects the defendant against the possibility of
the jury drawing unsupported. inferences from. otherwise innocuous behavior.” Jd. (quoting

United States v. Amuso, '2\ F.3d 1251, 1260 (2d.Cir. 1994).

+In its Opinion.and.Order. denying Ms: Maxwell's second bail.application, the Court did not resolve whether Ms:
Maxwell's conduct after the arrest of Jeffrey:Epstein. was designed’ to protect herself from: the pressor evade.law
‘enforcement. See 12/28/2020 Op. and Order (Dkt. 106) at ‘19. We. submit that:itwas clearly'the former. Atthe:very
‘least, there is no :foundation-for the government to assert the latter.
