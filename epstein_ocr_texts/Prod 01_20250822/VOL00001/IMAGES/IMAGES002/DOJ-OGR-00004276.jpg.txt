Epstein from 2001 to 2007”)). Thus, the time period alleged in both Counts Five and Six falls
squarely within the date range covered by the NPA for which Ms. Maxwell is immunized.
Moreover, 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) is one of the five enumerated offenses in the NPA. (Ex. B at 2 of
7). As such, Counts Five and Six are clearly offenses covered by the NPA.

Ms. Maxwell also cannot be prosecuted on Counts Five and Six because they are based
on the exact same allegations that were already thoroughly investigated by the Palm Beach FBI
and USAO-SDFL and were presented to a grand jury in the Southern District of Florida in
connection with the Florida Investigation. The allegations underlying Counts Five and Six (and
the expanded date range for Counts One and Three) come from a single accuser—Accuser-4—
who alleges that Epstein sexually abused her from approximately 2001-2004 and that Ms.
Maxwell allegedly facilitated that abuse. (S2 Indictment 9] 9d, 22-27). Based on our review of
the prior statements of non-testifying witnesses, which the government only recently produced to
the defense on April 13, 2021, we know that FBI Special Acn | ii
interviewed the person we believe to be Accuser-4 in connection with the Florida Investigation.
(Ex. C at 22:1-17).* We also know that Special Agen ii presented her allegations—
the very same allegations that form the basis for Counts Five and Six—to the grand jury in the
Southern District of Florida in support of a proposed 60-count federal indictment of Jeffrey
Epstein ee. (/d. at 22:17-31:6). The indictment included a conspiracy count and a
substantive count alleging a sex trafficking offense involving Accuser-4. (/d. at 28:3-15
(Accuser-4’s allegations formed the basis for “Overt Acts One through 18” and Count Two of
the proposed indictment charging Epstein LF with “procur[ing] [Accuser-4] to
“ Exhibit C is a transcript of the March 18, 2008 grand jury testimony of Special Agen the lead case
agent in charge of the Florida Investigation, in which she summarizes her interview of Accuser-4 and other related
evidence.
