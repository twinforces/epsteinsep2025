IV. In the Alternative, the Court Should Preclude the Government and Accuser-3 from

Representing that Accuser-3 Was a “Minor,” or that She Was “Sexually Abused”

by Epstein, and Give the Jury an Appropriate Limiting Instruction

If the Court determines that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is admissible, either as
direct evidence of the charged conspiracies or as 404(b) evidence, the Court should (1) preclude
the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as a “minor” or asserting that she was
a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the government and Accuser-3 from
representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein, and (3) give the jury an
appropriate limiting instruction related to Accuser-3’s testimony.

The government concedes that Accuser-3 alleges that she was 17 years old and above the
age of consent in the U.K. when she purportedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein in London.
The government further concedes that Accuser-3 cannot establish that she was under the age of
18 when she alleges that she first traveled to the United States and engaged in sex acts with
Epstein at his residences. Accuser-3 was therefore not a minor under the laws of the relevant
jurisdictions when the alleged sex acts and the alleged international travel took place. It follows
that the Court should not permit the government or Accuser-3 to refer to herself as a “minor” or
claim that she was a minor when she allegedly engaged in sex acts with Epstein.

Similarly, the Court should not permit the government and Accuser-3 to assert that she
was “sexually abused” by Epstein. The phrase “sexual abuse” connotes criminal activity, even
though the alleged conduct was lawful. See Esquivel-Quintana v. Sessions, 137 8S. Ct. 1562, 1569
(2017) (‘Sexual abuse of a minor,’ the Government accordingly contends, ‘most naturally connotes
conduct that (1) is egal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger than 18
years old.’”) (quoting government’s brief) (emphases added). Notwithstanding Accuser-3’s
“subjective experience” of these incidents, the use of the phrase “sexual abuse” should not be
allowed because it will mislead the jury into thinking that Accuser-3 engaged in “criminal sexual
