Please let us know your client's decision by no later than August 17. I have conferred
with U.S. Attorney Acosta who has asked me to communicate that the two-year term of
incarceration is a non-negotiable minimum to vindicate a federal interest, and, at this time,
he is not inclined to meet with counsel for Mr. Epstein.
Sincerely,
R. Alexander Acosta
United States Attorney

Menchel told OPR that in his view, the two-year sentence established a “floor” for
negotiations and if Epstein rejected the offer, subsequent offers would require him to accept more
jail time rather than less. Menchel told OPR that the USAO was “leaving our options open” by
retaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him
into a federal penitentiary.” The letter’s deadline of August 17, 2007, for acceptance of the
government’s offer was intended to accommodate Villafafia’s request that the deadline provide
her with enough time to go to New York, pursue investigative steps involving two of Epstein’s
assistants, do witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if
Epstein rejected the deal. Menchel told OPR he considered August 17 to be a firm deadline: “[I]f
you tell someone they have two weeks, it should be two weeks.” Menchel signed and sent the
letter on Friday, August 3, 2007, which was his last day at the USAO before joining a private law
firm.”

The following Monday, August 6, 2007, Villafafia contacted Menchel by email at his new
firm to inquire whether the letter to Epstein’s counsel had gone out on Friday. Villafafia explained
92 Menchel told OPR that the timing of the letter to Sanchez was a “total coincidence,” and had nothing to do
with his impending departure from the USAO.
