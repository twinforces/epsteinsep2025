Menchel told OPR that iin. his view, the two-year senterice. established, a. “floor” for
negotiations and if Epstein-rejected the offer, subsequent offers would. require him to:acecpt more
jail time rather than.|css. Menchel told OPR. that the USAO was “leaving our options: open” by
retaining the option of a federal plea because he thought the defense was “trying . . . to get him
into a federal. penitentiary.” The letter’s deadline of August. 17, 2007, for acceptance of ‘the
government’s offer was intended to, accommiodate Villafafia’s request, that the deadline provide:
her with cnough time to go to New York, pursuc investigative steps. involving two. of Epstcin’s
assistants, do witness interviews, and take additional. legal. steps to obtain Epstein’s computers if
Epstein,rejected the deal. ‘Menchel told OPR. he considered August 17 to be:a firm deadline: “[I]f
you tell someone they have, two weeks, it should be ‘two wecks.” Menchel signed. and. sent: the
letter‘ on Friday, August 3, 2007, which was his last.day at the USAO before joining a private’ law’

firm.”

firm,to inquire:whether the Ietter'to ‘Epstein’ s counscl,had g gone:out on.Friday. Villafana explained,
