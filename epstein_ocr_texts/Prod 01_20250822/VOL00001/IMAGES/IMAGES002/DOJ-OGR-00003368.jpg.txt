entitled. to: significant weight, and.OPR. credits them. OPR ‘finds, therefore, that the: emails jin,
question do ‘not themselves establish, that Villafafia, (or.any other subject) acted to improperly:
benefit Epstcin, was motivated. by: favoritism, or other improper influences, or sought to silence
victims.

G. The Evidence: Does Not Establish That Acosta, Lourie, or Villafana Agreed, to
the NPA’s Provision Promising Not to _Prosecute “Potential, Co-conspirators”
in Order to Protect Any’ of Epstein’s Political, Celebrity, or Other Influential
Associates:

OPR. examined the decision by the subjects ‘who negotiated the NPA—Villafafia, Lourie,
and Acosta—to include, in;the agreement.a, provision in, which,the USAO agreed, not 'to prosecute
“any potential, co-conspirators of Epstein,” in addition to four ‘named individuals, to determine
whether that provision resulted ‘from the subjects” improper favoritism. towards Epstein ‘or. an.
improper effort to:shicld from: prosecution any of Epstein’ 's known associates. Other than-various
drafts of the NPA. and of a federal plea, agreement, OPR, found. little: in the contemporaneous
records mentioning 'the provision. and nothing indicating that.the subjects discussed or debated.it—
or even gave it. much consideration. Drafts of the NPA and of the federal ‘plea, agreement show’
that the final broad language promising not to‘prosccute “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein”
evolved from a:more:narrow provision-sought.by the.defensc. ‘The-provision.expanded.as Villafafia
and defense counsel. exchanged drafts of, first, a proposed. federal plea agreement and, then, of the
NPA, with apparently little analysis and no substantive discussion within, the USAO about, the
provision.237

As the NPA drafting ‘process ‘concluded, Villafana, circulated to Louric and. another
supervisor a draft. that contained ‘the :non-prosccution. provision, telling Louric it:was “some of
[defense counsel’s] requested language regarding ‘promiscs not to prosecute other pcople,” and.
commenting only, “I don’t think it;hurts.us.” In.a reply email, Lourie responded;to another issue:

287 As set forth:in OPR’s factual: discussion, carly: in the:negotiations over a.federal plea agreement, the defense

sought..a non- prosecution provision applicable to: ‘only. four female named assistants of Epstein and to unnamed
employees: of one of his companies. Villafafia initially countered with * “standard language” referring to unnamed.

“co-conspirators” so as to:av oid * ‘highlight[ing] for. the judge. all:of the other crimes-and_all of the; other persons that:
we; could ‘charge:” Nonctheless, drafts of the NPA. sent. by Lefkowitz: after, Villafafia’s email continued to include
language referring to the four: named assistants and. unnamed employees. Villataiia, however, internally: circulated
drafts ofa federal plea agreement that:included language stating, * “This agreement: resolv ros the federal'criminal liability
of the defendant and any co- conspirators | in the Southern District of Florida growing out of any criminal conduct’ by:
those:persens known, to the [USAO].as of the: date; of-this pleasagreement?” The federal-plea agreement draft revised,
by 1 Lourie and,Acosta on September 20; 2007, included that language: ‘When.the defense-team reverted tonegotiation,
of state charges,, Villafafia. advised them, * “Tn.the context ofa: non-prosecution agreement, the [USAO] ‘may. be more
willing to be specific, about not pursuing charges against others“ The; next day, Lefkowitz sent a revised.draft: NPA,
referring: to the four;named. assistants, “any employee™ of the named company: and.“tany-unnamed co- conspirators for
any er iminal,char ge that ar ises outof the ongoing federal:iny. ‘estigation.* The language was finally:revised by Villafafia,
to prohibit ‘prosecution, of “any; potential, co-conspirators of Epstein, including ' but: not limited to, [the four named,
assistants].”

In commenting on'OPR’s draft report Villafafia’s ‘counsel and Lourie both noted ‘that the, non: prosecution
prov ision.could bind only the USAO, and Lourie further opined thatit-w as limited to certain specified, federal charges
and a time-limited scope of'conduct. Although the non- prosecution: provision in the NPA did not.explicitly contain
such limitations, those limitations were inéluded.in other parts of the:agreement:
