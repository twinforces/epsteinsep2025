Mr. Codttes, but she redd Somé books by Mr. Coates. She rédad a
few books -by Mr. Baldwin. So those are fantastic hooks to
read. The fact that she's reading those books and
participating in discussing the tepics and the subject matters
of those book's méans a lot.

It can take weeks to talk about why, but those books.
and, books, like that, when ‘you read ‘them and you talk about
them, you discuss. them, it opens your mind up and it takes you
away from the Criminality dnd more to ‘thought processing and
understanding how life really works. So I thought these were
very amportant.

She also has significant community support. Her
mother is in Suppdért 6f == albeit, very ill, but still
supportive. Her brother is, her aunts are, her uncle is. L

believe some other péedple, maybe 6ne 6r two, are 6n the line

right. mew. But she does have that family support, and I think,

and I'm suré will assist Her, whén she géts réleaséed, to ensure
that, she doesn't come back, to court.

Finally, and this is most important == nét mést
important but very important to me. This Coyvyid-L9 lockdown,
and she é6vén participated ih the 6théer lockdown regarding a
pagticular inmate. MCC, over the last 18, 19 months, have been
nothing short. of == TIT mean, I'll say ait on the record == I
think it*s been inhumane.

I don't think. our society is being as just as it is.
