1 Mr. Coates, but she read some books by Mr. Coates. She read a
2 few books by Mr. Baldwin. So those are fantastic books to

3 read. The fact that she's reading those books and

4 participating in discussing the topics and the subject matters
5 of those books means a lot.

6 It can take weeks to talk about why, but those books

7 and books like that, when you read them and you talk about

8 them, you discuss them, it opens your mind up and it takes you
9 away from the criminality and more to thought processing and

10 understanding how life really works. So I thought those were
11 very important.

12 She also has significant community support. Her

13 mother is in support of -- albeit, very ill, but still

14 supportive. Her brother is, her aunts are, her uncle is. I

15 believe some other people, maybe one or two, are on the line

16 right now. But she does have that family support, and I think
17 and I'm sure will assist her, when she gets released, to ensure
18 that she doesn't come back to court.

19 Finally, and this is most important -- not most
20 important but very important to me. This Covid-19 lockdown,
21 and she even participated in the other lockdown regarding a
22 particular inmate. MCC, over the last 18, 19 months, have been
23 nothing short of -- I mean, I'll say it on the record -- I
24 think it's been inhumane.
25 I don't think our society is being as just as it is.
