Is the government seeking forfeiture?
MR. CHIUCHIGLO: No, your Honor,

THE COURT: Ms. Days, youre reqiired to pay $100 in
court costs. That will be taken out of your prison wages. at
the rate of $25 per calendar quarter, or 50 percent of ‘your
gross. monthly earnings if you're in a Unicor grade ‘one through
four ‘progrdm..

I should interrupt myself to say that Ms. Days has
done two very daditirablé things. First of all, she's
accomplished a pretty impressive record, under pandemic
circumstances, Of Coursework; and, second, she has completed
this Court's Focus Forward program, run by our pretrial
divisioh, and I'm a big fan of that program. It was started 6n
my watch, and I'm a big supporter of that. program.

I'm glad, Ms. Days, that. they let you into the
program, and I'm preud of you for having completed the program.
I believe that. it is 6ne 6f the best tools that yd6u will Have
going forward.

Mr. Donaldson, did you have any recommendatidn fdr
place of incarceration?

MR. DONALDSON: Yes, your Honor. We are asking for as
near to New York City as possible, and I would say that one
very near, but. that has problems Soriétimies; so I say the
nearest one to New York City as possible. I'm sure, hopefully,
at some point, Tiff will start getting some family visits so
