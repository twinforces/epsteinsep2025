1 Is the government seeking forfeiture?

2 MR. CHIUCHIOLO: No, your Honor.

3 THE COURT: Ms. Days, you're required to pay $100 in

4 court costs. That will be taken out of your prison wages at

5 the rate of $25 per calendar quarter, or 50 percent of your

6 gross monthly earnings if you're in a Unicor grade one through
7 four program.

8 I should interrupt myself to say that Ms. Days has

9 done two very admirable things. First of all, she's

10 accomplished a pretty impressive record, under pandemic

11 circumstances, of coursework; and, second, she has completed

12 this Court's Focus Forward program, run by our pretrial

13 division, and I'm a big fan of that program. It was started on
14 my watch, and I'm a big supporter of that program.

15 I'm glad, Ms. Days, that they let you into the

16 program, and I'm proud of you for having completed the program.
17 I believe that it is one of the best tools that you will have
18 going forward.

19 Mr. Donaldson, did you have any recommendation for
20 place of incarceration?
21 MR. DONALDSON: Yes, your Honor. We are asking for as
22 near to New York City as possible, and I would say that one
23 very near, but that has problems sometimes; so I say the
24 nearest one to New York City as possible. I'm sure, hopefully,
25 at some point, Tiff will start getting some family visits so
