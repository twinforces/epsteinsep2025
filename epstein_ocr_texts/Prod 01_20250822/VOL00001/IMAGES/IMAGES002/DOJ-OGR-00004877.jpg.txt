When we review the statement in its full context, it is clear that, when D.A. Castor
announced that he “will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” the decision to
which he was referring was his decision not to comment publicly “on the details of his
[charging] decision for fear that his opinions and analysis might be given undue weight
by jurors in any contemplated civil action.” The entire paragraph addresses the district
attorney’s concern that he might inadvertently taint a potential civil jury pool by making
public remarks about the credibility of the likely parties in that highly anticipated case.
Then-D.A. Castor expressly stated that he could change his mind on that decision only.
Nothing in this paragraph pertains to his decision not to prosecute Cosby. The trial court’s
conclusion is belied by a plain reading of the entire passage.

Our inquiry does not end there. D.A. Castor’s press release, without more, does
not necessarily create a due process entitlement. Rather, the due process implications
arise because Cosby detrimentally relied upon the Commonwealth’s decision, which was
the district attorney’s ultimate intent in issuing the press release. There was no evidence
of record indicating that D.A. Castor intended anything other than to induce Cosby’s
reliance. Indeed, the most patent and obvious evidence of Cosby’s reliance was his
counseled decision to testify in four depositions in Constand’s civil case without ever
invoking his Fifth Amendment rights.

States via incorporation though the Fourteenth Amendment, commands that “[n]o person

as an indispensable rampart between that government and the governed. The Fifth
