Epstein? Ss -counsel|to challenpe'portions ofthe NPA. ‘Acosta’ S ‘letter concluded: |

Although it happens rarely, | do not’ mind this, Office’s, decision
being appealed to Washington, and have previously directed our
with, the. option of appealing. our 1 decisions. ‘Indeed, although. | am
confident. in our prosecutors’ cvidenee and Icgal. analysis, |
nonetheless directed them to:consult with:the subject matter: ‘experts
in [CEOS] to. confirm our interpretation of the law before approving
their [charges]. I am thus surprised to read a. letter addressed. to
Department;Headquarters that raises issues that. cither have not’ been
raised ‘with this Office previously or that; have been raised,,and in
fact:résolved, in ‘your'clicnt’s ‘favor.

Agreement. “The AUSAS who: have been negotiating with defense
counsel have for some time complained. to me ‘regarding the tactics
‘used. by the defense: team. It appears to, them. that as soon as
resolution is.:reached on one issuc, defense ‘counsel finds.-ways to
challenge the resolution. collaterally. My response:thus far has been
that. defense counsel is doing its job to vigorously represent, the
clicnt. That said, there must be:closure, on. this matter. Some in our
Office are deeply concerned, that défense counsel will continue. to,
mount collateral. challenges to provisions of the Agreement, even
after Mr. Epstein. has: entered ‘his g guilty plea and thus: rendered the
agreement difficult, if not: impossible, to ‘unwind.

T would reiterate that.it isnot theintention of this Office ever to force
the hand of a defendant. to enter into an agreement against, his
wishes: Your clicnt has the right'to procced to trial. Although time
is of the essence . . . I. am directing’ our prosccutors ‘not. to, issuc
‘victim notification letters until, this Friday’. . . to poe you ‘with
‘time to. review: these options with your client. . We expect a
‘written decision by [December 7, 2007] at: 5 p.m., indicating

whether the defense team. wishes to reaffirm, or to unwind, the
Aegrcemient.

Acosta explained to OPR.that he: did not.view his Ictter as “inviting” Departmental:review,
but ‘he believed. the: ‘Department., had ‘the “right” te address Epstein’s ‘concerns. Moreover, the
USAO’s only option at, that time’was to declare Epstein in breach of the NPA, which, would have
prompted litigation as to'whether Epstein was,'in fact,in breach. Acosta noted that. defense counsel
repeatedly proclaimed Epstein’s intent ‘to abide by the agreement, making any USAO effort. to
declare him. in breach. more: difficult. In fact, the day after recciving Acosta’s Ictter, Starr and
Lefkowitz responded .to.Acosta:(with copics to Sloman.and Assitant.Attorncy‘Gencral.Fisher) that
