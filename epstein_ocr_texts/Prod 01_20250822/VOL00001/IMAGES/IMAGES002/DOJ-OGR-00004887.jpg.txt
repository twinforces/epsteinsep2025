This remedy is insufficient here, for a number of reasons. First, as noted, the
remedy statement ‘was dicta, and is not the law in Pennsylvania. Second, the
circumstances that led to the suggestion of that remedy are markedly different than those

conversely, the non-prosecution decision was made by the elected District Attorney of
Montgomery County, whose public announcement of that decision was fully within his
