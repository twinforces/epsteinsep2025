Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 336 Filed 09/07/21 Page 2 of 10

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell makes this second ex parte and in camera motion for the
Court to enter an Order authorizing her counsel to issue additional subpoenas under Federal Rule
of Criminal Procedure 17(c). The legal and factual grounds for this second motion are largely
identical to those set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s first ex parte and in camera motion (“First Motion”)
for issuance of a subpoena to the law firm Boies, Schiller and Flexner LLP (“BSF”), filed with
the Court on February 21, 2021, and Ms. Maxwell expressly incorporates that First Motion by
reference. Because additional subpoenas are necessary for (a) her pending pre-trial motions, and
(b) in order to examine certain physical pieces of evidence in advance of trial in order to
adequately prepare for trial, she hereby sets forth additional facts and argument pursuant to
United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 699-700 (1974), to justify these additional subpoenas.

As with her First Motion, she makes this motion ex parte for the “strong policy reasons in
favor of an ex parte” process and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and
trial strategy to demonstrate compliance with the specificity, relevance, and admissibility
requirements of a Fed. R. Crim. P. 17 subpoena. United States v. Reyes, 162 F.R.D. 468, 470
(S.D.N.Y. 1995).
