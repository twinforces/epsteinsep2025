Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
On April 21, 2021, the Court’s Chambers received a letter from counsel for a non-party
requesting assurances as to privacy protections for his client in any filings or proceedings in this
case. The letter requests anonymity on behalf of the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime.
After receiving the letter, the Court forwarded it to the parties and required the Government to
respond to counsel, which it has done. The Court will take no further action based on the April
21, 2021 letter but will file it under seal to protect the privacy interests of the non-party asserting
that interest.
The Government is requested to forward this order to counsel for the non-party.
SO ORDERED. Ak
