Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page:303 of 348

attend the hearing: In, his affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here'was no: possible way:] could have
believed that this state plea could affect:the federal, investigation, or the rights of my: clients in‘ that:
federal investigation.”

In. Wild, the Eleventh. Circuit. panel stated that the: government ‘ “sccmingly” deferred to
Epstcin’s attorneys’ requests not to: notify the victims about the NPA, and that: in. sending’ the:
January and/May 2008 FBI Ictters, the government’s efforts “scem'to have g graduated from:passive
nondisclosure to (or at least close fo) active misrepresentation.”*"’ Although both the appellate
court:and district court focused on.the FBI’s Ictters forwhich OPR concludes that neither Villafana,
Sloman, nor Acosta. was s responsible, OPR considered the courts” analyses ‘in evaluating, whether
February, 1, 2008, and. to “Edwards, were’ » misleading, "Therefore, OPR ‘considered "whether
Villafafia’s statements that the matter-was “under i investigation” and her failure to inform all of the
victims whom she interviewed or Edwards about 'the NPA violated, FRPC. 4-4.1(a), 4-8.4(¢); or
4-8:4(d).

FRPC 4-4.1(a) prohibits an. attorney from, “knowingly ‘mak[ing] a false statement of
material fare or law toa. third person” during’ the representation. of.a.clicnt. The FRPC defines
“knowingly” as s “denot[ing] actual knowledge of the fact in question” and, states that such
knowledge may be “inferred from. circumstances.°*** The comment to FRPC 4-4.1 states that

“[ml]isrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or omissions that.
are the cquivalent. of affirmative false statements.” The comment references FRPC 4-8.4 “[flor
dishonest conduet that does not amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.1(a), Rule 4-8.4(c)
requires evidence that the attorney knew the statement in. question. was ‘false. Under’ FRPC
4-8.4(c), the intent. requirement: can, be satisfied. “mercly by showing that ‘the, conduct’ was
deliberate or knowing” ‘and the “motive: underlying the lawyer’s conduct is not determinative;
instead.the issue is'whether he or she:purposefully acted, 239 Th FF ceinberg, the court concluded that
the prosecutor violated (FRPC 4-41, and, 4-8.4(c) and, (d) by deliberately making untruthful
statements ‘to. a defense attorncy, despite cvidence that the prosecutor intended. to help: the
defendant by making the statements." Th this ‘case, Villafatia was fully-aware ofthe signed: NPA.
when she. interviewed the victims: on January: 31 and February |, 2008, and when. she. ‘spoke: to
Edwards on the telephone, but she did not inform them: specifically of the signed. NPA. The
question is whether this omission amounted to a knowing false statement or misrepresentation.

One difficulty is, determining ‘what Villafafia actually said during conversations ‘that
participants were:asked.to recall many years later. With respect to three: of the victims whom she:

interviewed jin January: and. February 2008, Villafafia. contended that she discussed.the agreement:
with them, even if she did not, specifically refer to it‘as the NPA or discuss all of its terms, and.as
