Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 219 of 239

Seventh, the defendant seeks a proffer of all co-conspirator statements that the Government
intends to offer at trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E). (Def. Mot. 10 at 13-
14). In making this motion, the defense cites authority confirming that co-conspirator statements
may be admitted at trial on a conditional basis without the need for any pretrial consideration of
their admissibility. See United States v. Tracy, 12 F.3d 1186, 1199 (2d Cir. 1993) (“The decision
as to whether the four prerequisites have been met, like all other preliminary questions of
admissibility, is to be made by the court. If the government succeeds in persuading the court that
the conditionally admitted coconspirator statements were made during and in furtherance of a
conspiracy of which both the declarant and the defendant were members, the statements are
allowed to go to the jury. If the court is not so persuaded, it either should instruct the jury to
disregard the statements, or, if those statements were ‘so large a proportion of the proof as to render
a cautionary instruction of doubtful utility,’ should declare a mistrial.” (internal citations omitted)
(quoting United States v. Geaney, 417 F.2d 1116, 1120 (2d Cir. 1969))). Indeed, the Second
Circuit has rejected the suggestion that non-exculpatory co-conspirator statements are discoverable
under Rule 16 or by any means other than the Jencks Act. See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 284-87
(2d Cir. 1987) (issuing a writ of mandamus reversing District Court’s order directing the
Government “to produce all oral statement made by the defendants and coconspirators that the
Government planned to offer at trial as admissions of a defendant” under Fed. R. Evid. 801).
Consistent with the Government’s intention to produce Jencks Act material several weeks in
advance of trial, the defense will receive notice of any co-conspirator statements that the
Government may seek to introduce through witness statements with sufficient time to raise any
objections with the Court. Accordingly, this motion should be denied
