Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204. Filed 04/16/21 Page 219 of 239

Seventh, the defendant:sccks a proffer ofall co-conspirator:statements that the Government.
intends to offer at’ trial pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E). (Def. Mot. 10, at 13-
14). In making this motion, the defense cites authority confirming that co-conspirator statements
may. be admitted ‘at trial on a conditional. basis without the nced ‘for any pretrial, considcration, of
theit admissibility. See United States’ ¥. Lacy, 12 F.3d 1186, 1199 (2d Cir. 1993) (“The deeision,
as to whether the four ‘prerequisites have been. met, ‘like all, other preliminary questions of
admissibility, is to be made by the court. Ifthe government: succecds ‘in persuading the court that.
the ‘conditionally admitted coconspirator statements were ‘made: during and. in furthcrance of a
conspiracy of which. both the declarant. and the defendant. were members, the ‘statements are
allowed, to go 'to the jury. If the court is not.so persuaded, it cither should. instruct the jury’ to
‘disregard the statements, or, if those:statements were ‘so large a proportion.of the proof-as to render
‘a, cautionary ‘instruction, of doubtful utility,’ should declare a.mistrial.” (internal citations omitted)
(quoting United States. ¥. Gedney, 417 F.2d. 11:16, 1120 (2d Git. 1969))). Indeed, the Sécond.
Circuit has rejected the suggestion that:non-cxculpatory co-conspirator statements are discoverable
‘under Rule ‘16 or by any’ means other than'the Jencks Act. See Jnie U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 284-87
(2d Cir. 1987) (issuing a ‘writ of mandamus reversing District Court’s: ‘order. directing ‘the:
Government “to produce all oral statement. made by the defendants and. coconspirators that. the
Government planned to offer at''trial as admissions of a defendant” under Fed. R. Evid. 801).
Consistent with the Government’s intention to produce Jencks. Act material. several. weeks in.
advanee of. trial, the defense will reecive notice, of ‘any co-conspirator statements, ‘that; the

‘objections with the Court. Accordingly, this motion,should be denied.
