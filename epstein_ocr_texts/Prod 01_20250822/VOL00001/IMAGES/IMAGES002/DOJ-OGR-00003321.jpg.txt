PART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS

I. OPR’S ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

OPR. finds professional misconduct when ‘an. attorney intentionally violates or acts: in,
reckless. disregard. of a known, unambiguous obligation. imposéd by law, rule: of professional
conduct, or Department regulation or policy. In determining whether an attorncy‘has cngaged in,
professional misconduct, OPR. uses the preponderance of the evidence standard to:make factual
findings.

An attorney intentionally violates an obligation or standard. when ‘the attorney (1); engages
in, conduct with, the purpose of obtaining a result that the obligation, or standard unambiguously
prohibits; or (2) engages in conduct knowing its natural. or probable: consequence, and that
‘consequence is a result that the obligation or standard unambiguously prohibits. An attorney acts
in. reckless disregard of an obligation, or standard when (1): the attorney knows or should ‘know,
based on his or her experience and the unambiguous nature of the obligation or standard, of ‘an
obligation or standard; (2) the attorney knows or should know, based. on his or het.cxpericrice and
the unambiguous applicability: of the obligation or standard, thatthe attorney’s conduct involves.a.
substantial: likelihood that he:or she-will violate, or-cause.a violation, of, the obligation. or, standard;
and (3) the attorney. nonetheless engages in the conduct, which is objectively unreasonable under
all the circumstances. Thus, an attorney’s disregard ofan obligation. is reckless when. it:represents
a gross deviation from ‘the standard, of conduct: that. an objectively reasonable attorney ‘would,
observe inthe same Situation.

If OPR. determines that an, attorney did not, engage ‘in, professional ‘misconduct, OPR
determines whether the: attorney exercised poor judgment, engaged in other inappropriate conduct,
made a mistake, or acted appropriately under all the circumstances. An attorney exercises poor
judgment ‘when, faced with altcinative, courses of action, he. or Shé chooses, a course of action:that.
is in marked contrast to the: action that the Department may reasonably expect an | attomey
attorney may act {inappropriately and thus cxhibit poor judgment ¢ even, n though’ he or she | may ‘not
have violated or acted in.‘reckless disregard ofa clear obligation or standard. In. addition, an
attorney may cxhibit poor judgment cven ‘though. an. obligation or standard. at. issuc is not.
sufficiently clear:and unambiguous: to support a professional. misconduct finding. A. mistake, on.
the other ‘hand, results from an excusable human crror despite an attorney’s exercise: of reasonable
care under the circumstances.

An attorney who makes a good faith attempt to. ascertain the obligations and. standards
‘imposed on.the attorney and to comply:with them.in:a-given.situation.docs not.commit professional.
misconduct, ‘Evidence that an, attorney made a good faith attempt to ascertain and comply: with,
the obligations and.standards imposed can ‘include, but is:not limited:to, the fact that the attorney
reviewed materials that. define or discuss, one or more ‘potentially applicable obligations and.
standards, consulted, with. a supervisor or ethics advisor, ‘notified.’the tribunal or the attorney’
representing ‘a. party or person with adverse interests ofan intended. course of conduct, or took:
