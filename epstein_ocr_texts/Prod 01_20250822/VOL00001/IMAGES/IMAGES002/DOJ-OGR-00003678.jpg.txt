A. The non-prosecution ‘agreement does not bind the U.S. Attorney ‘for the
Southern District of New York

United States Attorneys speak: for the United States. When a U.S..Attorney:makes a
promise as’part of a plea bargain, both contract principles.and due process require the federal
government'to fulfill it. See Santobello'v. New. Yorks 404.0.S. 257, 262 (1971): United. States: ¥
Ready, 82.F.3d.55.1, 558 (2d Cir. 1996). The:question here:is not whether the U.S. Attorney :for
the Southern,Distriet of Florida had. the power to'bind the U.S. Attorney for the, Southern District.
of New York. The question is'whether the'tctms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Cireuit
preecdent and:principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that:they: didnot.

In United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: “A. plea agreement: binds only. the
office of the United. States Attorney for the district in-which theplea is entered unless it.
affirmatively. appears that the agreement, contemplates a ‘broader restriction.” 771 F.2d,670, 672
(2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam). This is something akin.to,a clear statement.rule. Single-district plea
agreements are the:norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the: rare exception. Applying
Annabi, pancls, of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent‘to depart from.
this ordinary‘ practice from.an agrecment’s use of phrases like “the. government” or “the United
States.” United States v. Salameh, 152 F 3d 88, 120 (2d Cir, 1998) (per curiam); United Staies v.
Gonzalez, 93 F.App’x.268; 270 (2d. Cir: 2004). Those are common shorthand. A plea
agreement necd not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States Attorney for Such-
and-Such District?’ in, every. instance to make clear that it-applics only in the district where
signed.

Maxwell. asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA
dealing with co-conspirators does not.cxpressly. state'that; it’binds. U.S. Attorneys in other

districts. It docs not expressly state. that it applies in. other districts. The relevant. language, in.
