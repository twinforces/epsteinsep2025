The law is clear that a district court’s supervisory authority doesnot extend to suppressing.
evidenee absent some violation of the Constitution or'other governing law. See. Payner, 447 US.
at 737 (holding ‘that: “the supervisory power does not.cxtend” to “disregard[ing] the considered.
limitations of the law it is charged with enforcing”); United States v. Anderson, 772 F.3d 969, 976
(2d Cir. 2014) (same); United States, ¥. Jennings, 960.F.2d 1488, 1491 (9th Cir. 1992) (“Absent a.

appreciate the district court’s frustration at carcless government representations: that may impact:
‘the integrity of judicial, decisions, especially’ proffcrs in support of ev. parte applications ‘that. an
adversary has no opportunity to dispute[,]” but. finding that the: district court erred. in suppressing:
evidence by-invoking its inherent authority); Coke,.201:1 WL.3738969, at *6 (declining to exercise
its supervisory powers to suppress ‘wiretap cvidencé and fitiditig defendant “has no Fourth
Amendment right, and.the novel ‘substantive duc: process right. he asks ‘this Court to create cannot.
be described as, a recognized right.” (internal, citations omitted)).
