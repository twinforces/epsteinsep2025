Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 138 of 239

The law is clear that a district court’s supervisory authority does not extend to suppressing
evidence absent some violation of the Constitution or other governing law. See Payner, 447 U.S.
at 737 (holding that “the supervisory power does not extend” to “disregard[ing] the considered
limitations of the law it is charged with enforcing”); United States v. Anderson, 772 F.3d 969, 976
(2d Cir. 2014) (same); United States v. Jennings, 960 F.2d 1488, 1491 (9th Cir. 1992) (“Absent a
violation of a recognized right under the Constitution, a statute, or a procedural rule, a district court
is not entitled to exclude evidence as a sanction against government practices disapproved of by
the court.”). The requirements established by the Supreme Court and the Second Circuit for
suppressing evidence would have little effect if district courts were free to disregard them and
suppress evidence by invoking their supervisory authority. Consistent with that principle, and
given that this power is “sparingly exercised,” Lambus, 897 F.3d at 401, (emphasis in original),
this Court should not elect to do so here where the defendant has not established a violation of her
Fourth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, or due process rights. See, e.g., id. at 401-02 (“We can
appreciate the district court’s frustration at careless government representations that may impact
the integrity of judicial decisions, especially proffers in support of ex parte applications that an
adversary has no opportunity to dispute[,]” but finding that the district court erred in suppressing
evidence by invoking its inherent authority); Coke, 2011 WL 3738969, at *6 (declining to exercise
its supervisory powers to suppress wiretap evidence and finding defendant “has no Fourth
Amendment right, and the novel substantive due process right he asks this Court to create cannot
be described as a recognized right.” (internal citations omitted)).

6. The Defendant Is Not Entitled to a Hearing

The defendant argues that if the Court is “disinclined” to grant the extraordinary relief of

suppression she seeks, she is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to probe the Government’s
