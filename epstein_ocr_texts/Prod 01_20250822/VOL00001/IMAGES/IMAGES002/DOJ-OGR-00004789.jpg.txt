Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 307 Filed 06/25/21 Page5of21

‘Second Circuit later held that the court in the civil. case withheld. far too many documents. from,
‘public ‘view and ordered that many of them be madé publicly available. Brown v. Maxwell, 929
F.3d 41, 53 (2d Cir. 2019). Much. of what the Government obtained through its. subpoena,
including the bulk of the deposition, transcripts Maxwell now sccks to suppress, have since been.
unsealed by court order in the civil case. See Ginffre, No. 15-cv-7433, Dkt. Nos. 1137, 1212.
Th. Discussion,

Maxwell objects both to the Government obtaining documents covered by’ the protective
order and:to the Government’s:conduct in doing so. She contends that she agreed to testify in the

civil case orily because of the protective order, and:thus that the Government’s use of her

deposition testimony against her would violate her right.against. compelled self-incrimination.
She contends that she: had a reasonable expectation of privacy in. the documents covered by the
protective order, and thus that;the Government should not have'been able, to obtain them. without.
and violated:her due:process rights: by:misleading Judge MeMahon about:the Government’s prior
communications with BSF.

The Court finds that none ofthese arguments support suppression of evidence or,justify
an evidentiary hearing. The Court begins with. Maxwell’s claim that the Government violated.
her right against compelled self+incrimination by obtaining her deposition. testimony from. the
civil case. Jt next turns to-her claim.that the: Government violated her right against unreasonable
searches and,scizures. Finally, it‘addresses. Maxwell’s claim, that the Government misled, Judge

MeMahon. in secking modificationof the protective order in the carlicr civil case.
