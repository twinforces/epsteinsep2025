told OPR that the USAO. had “no, standardized way. to, do any’ victim. notifications ‘prior to” the
filing of federal. charges, and therefore Villafana did. not. use. a template. or VWNS-generated letter

The letters contained contact ‘information, for Villafafia, the FBI case agent, ‘and the
Department’ s, Office for Victims of Crime 'in Washington, D.C., and itemized the CVRA rights.
The USAO letters described.the case as “under investigation” and stated that the victim would be
notified “Lif anyone 1S charged i in connection with the investigation. ” the lctters stated ‘that, in.
potential restitution ‘from the perpetrator, and that, upon: request, the g sovernment ‘would. provide ‘a.

the CVRA litigation, Villafafia, stated that she and the: investigative team.‘ ‘adopted, an approach. of
providing more notice and.assistance'to potential victims than the CVRA may. have required, even
before'the circumstances of those individuals had been ‘fully investigated.and before any charging
decisions had‘been made.?*”
