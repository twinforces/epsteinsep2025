‘its. entirety, rcads.as follows: “the United States also agrees that it:will not-institute any criminal
charges against any-potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Dkt. No. 142-1 at‘S. Under Aniabi,
Salameh, and Gonzalez, a.statement that “the United. States” agrees not. to prosecute implies no
restriction on prosecutions in, other districts.

Two provisions,of the. NPA refer specifically to prosecution.in the Southern District of
Florida, The first states that the U.S. Attorney forthe Southern District of Florida-will defer
““prosccution. in this District” if Epstein. complics with the agreement. Dkt. No. 142-1, at.2. ‘The
second states that-no prosecution “will be instituted :in this District, and. the charges: against
Epstein if any, will be dismissed” after he fulfills the agreement’s conditions. ‘Maxwell contends
that the lack of similar language in. the co-conspirator provision must mean. that it.lacks any
‘gcographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects thatthe NPA’s:scope was expressly
limited-to the Southern District:of Florida. Itis not plausible—lIct.alone “affirmatively
apparent”, Annabi, 771 F.2d. at 672,—that the paitics intended to drastically expand the
agrecment’s geographic. scope in the single sentence: on,the:prosecution of co-conspirators
without clearly'so saying.

Without an. affirmative statement in the NPA’s text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation
history. Under Sccond Circuit precedent she may. offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA.
States v. Russo, 801. F.2d.624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986). She alleges that officials in.the:U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District. of Florida sought and. obtained. approval for the NPA
from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General. and communicated ‘with attoriicys. in other

been‘minimal. Maxwell has, already received access to,an unusually large amount of information
