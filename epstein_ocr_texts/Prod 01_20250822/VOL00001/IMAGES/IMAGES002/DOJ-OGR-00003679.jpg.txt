Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page5of34
its entirety, reads as follows: “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any criminal
charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Dkt. No. 142-1 at 5. Under Annabi,
Salameh, and Gonzalez, a statement that “the United States” agrees not to prosecute implies no
restriction on prosecutions in other districts.

Two provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution in the Southern District of
Florida. The first states that the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida will defer
“prosecution in this District” if Epstein complies with the agreement. Dkt. No. 142-1 at 2. The
second states that no prosecution “will be instituted in this District, and the charges against
Epstein if any, will be dismissed” after he fulfills the agreement’s conditions. Maxwell contends
that the lack of similar language in the co-conspirator provision must mean that it lacks any
geographical limitation. If anything, that language reflects that the NPA’s scope was expressly
limited to the Southern District of Florida. It is not plausible—let alone “affirmatively
apparent”, Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672,— that the parties intended to drastically expand the
agreement’s geographic scope in the single sentence on the prosecution of co-conspirators
without clearly so saying.

Without an affirmative statement in the NPA’s text, Maxwell turns to its negotiation
history. Under Second Circuit precedent she may offer evidence that negotiations of the NPA
between the defendant and the prosecutors included a promise to bind other districts. See United
States v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986). She alleges that officials in the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida sought and obtained approval for the NPA
from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and communicated with attorneys in other
districts. Any involvement of attorneys outside the Southern District of Florida appears to have
been minimal. Maxwell has already received access to an unusually large amount of information
