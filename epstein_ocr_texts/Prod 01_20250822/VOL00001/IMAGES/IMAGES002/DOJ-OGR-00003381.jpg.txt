before reaching: plea agreements ¢ or that nroseeutars cannot reasonably ‘determine’ that: reaching a:
resolution is more beneficial than continuing 'to litigate evidentiary‘issues. Every'case is different:
and must be, judged on its. own. facts. Th this. case, however, given the unorthodox nature. of the
statc-bascd.-resolution, the fact that Acosta’s decision.to:pursuce it:sct-the case on a'wholly different.
track than, what had. been, originally’ contemplated. by his’ experienced: staff, the:nature and. scope of
Epstcin’s criminal conduct, the circumstances.:surrounding the removal of the computers. from,
Epstein’s residence, and the ‘potential for obtaining evidence revealing scrious, additional criminal
conduct, Acosta had.a responsibility to cnsuré that he'was fully informed. about the: consequences
of pursing the course of'action that he proposed and particularly: about the consequences flowing:
from the cxpress terms of the NPA. (In deciding to resolve the case: pre-charge, Acosta lost: sight
of the bigger ‘picture that the investigation was not completed and viable leads remained to be
pursued. The decision to forgo the: government’s, efforts to obtain the computer, evidence,'and to
‘pursue significant investigative steps should have: been, made only after careful consideration of
all the. costs and. benefits..of the proposed action. OPR. did not find evidence that Acosta. fully
considered the costs of ending the: investigation. prematurely.” i

C. OPR. Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of
Incarceration, That It Was Tied to Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It
Satisfied the Federal Interest:in the Prosecution

The heart. of the controversy.:surrounding the Epstein case is the apparent. undue leniency:
afforded him coneerning his sentence. After offering a, deal, that. required, a “non-negotiable”
24-month térm of incarceration, Acosta agréed to resolve it for an 18-month term of incarceration,
knowing:that’ gain time. would reduce it ‘further, and indeed, Epstein, served ‘only 13. months.
Epstein. ultimately did not scrve even. that minimal. sentence incarcerated 0 on.a full-time: basis
sentence. As. ‘Lourie told OPR, * “[E]verything else that ‘happened to [Epstein] i Is. s exactly what
should, have happened to him. ... He had to pay’a. lot of moncy. He had. to register as a sex
offender,” but “in the perfeet world, [Epstein] would-have served more time in jail.”

Duc to the’passage of time and.the subjects’ inability to recall, many details of'the relevant
events, OPR,was unable to develop a. clear’ understanding of how ‘the original ‘two-year sentence
requirement was developed or by‘whom. Two'possibilitics were articulated during OPR’s subject.
interviews: (1) the two ‘years represented the sentence Epstein ‘would, have received had ‘he pled
guilty’ to an. unspecified charge originally: contemplated by the state; or (2) the two years
represented. the sentence the USAO determined Epstein, would be willing: to accept, thus avoiding
the need. for‘a.trial. As.to the former: possibility, Acosta.told. OPR that his “best understanding” of
the two-ycar proposal was, that. it correlated to “onc of the original. state charges.” He claborated,

ass!

a In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s attorney objected.to OPR’s conclusion that Acosta knew or
should-have known.about'the litigation. regarding the computers and that he should’have given greater. consideration
to: pursuing: the computers: before: the; NPA. was signed. Acosta’s attorney. asserted ‘that Acosta was not involved in,
that: level of * “granularity”: that his***small thoughts’ edits” ‘on.the NPA were limited.and focused on, policy; and that
it-was: appropriate: for him to: rely on. his-staffto raise any. issues-of concern'to him. For the reasons stated above, OPR.
nonetheless concludes: that: having dev ‘cloped a, unique; resolution, to a federal. inv estigation,. ‘Acosta ‘had. a greater

obligation to understand and consider what.the USAO:was giving-up and the-appropriateness of doing'so.
