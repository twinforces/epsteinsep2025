Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse 967

Knoll (2010) found that while a teacher is using bribery to gain the
trust of a victim, typically conversation about sexual matters with the stu-
dent is also starting to emerge. Physical contact is then gradually increased.
Furthermore, Gallagher (2000) found that in cases where “entrapment”
behaviors were reported, 43% of perpetrators initiated physical contact with
the child and 17% behaved in a sexual manner with the child.

Furthermore, differences between genders of the victim have also been
noted in the sexual desensitization type of grooming. Spiegel (2003) noted
that the use of pornography to sexually desensitize children is more common
with male victims than with female victims.

Boundary Violations

Berliner and Conte (1990) found that 70% of children reported that their
abusers “accidentally” came into their bedroom or bathroom while they were
undressing; 61% indicated that their abusers “accidentally” touched their pri-
vate parts; 61% said that their abusers did not respect their privacy or let
them close doors; 61% reported that their abusers “accidentally” showed
their naked body to them; 57% indicated that their abusers would purposely
do things with the child that involved physical contact; 48% said that their
abusers made sexual comments about the child’s body or clothing; 44%
reported that their abusers asked them to do things that involved physical
contact; 30% said that their abusers would inspect the child’s body “to see
how it was developing”; 30% indicated that their abusers “taught sex educa-
tion” by showing pornographic pictures and touching the child’s body; 26%
reported that their abusers told the child about sexual things he had previ-
ously done; and 22% indicated that their abusers put lotion or ointment on
the child when they were alone but said he was doing nothing wrong.

According to Christiansen and Blake’s (1990) stages of grooming in
father—daughter incest, the last step involves the father violating his daugh-
ter’s boundaries. In particular, fathers may insist on bathing their daughters
and do not allow other family members to do this. These baths frequently
involve inappropriate sexual behavior. Fathers also insist on dressing their
daughters or on watching them get dressed. In addition, fathers will tend
to watch the child use the bathroom. Finally, perpetrating fathers will have
sexually explicit conversations with the daughter to further desensitize them.
Grooming the Child’s Environment
Elliott and colleagues (1995) found that 20% of the offenders in their sam-
ple admitted they gained the trust of the child’s family with the purpose of
abusing the child. Forty-eight percent isolated their victims through babysit-
ting. Furthermore, Knoll (2010) found that a teacher can also manipulate the
