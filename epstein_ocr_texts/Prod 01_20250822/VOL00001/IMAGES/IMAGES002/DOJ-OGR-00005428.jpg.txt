value of such evidence is substantially outweighed by the unfair prejudice: to the Government.

charges. against the defendant:

The Second. Circuit has explained that.claims of purported government misconduct. must:
be “directed to the court. rather than, jury.” United States v. Regan, 103, F.3d 1072, 1082 (2d Cir.
1997). Allegations concerning the government’s conduct are “ultimately separate from the issuc
of [a defendant’s] factual guilt” and concern an, alleged “defect in. the’ institution of the
prosecution.” /d. (internal quotation ‘marks omitted). Accordingly, district, courts routinely and,
correctly preclude defendants. from.raising these arguments at trial. See id. (“[W]e agree:with the
district court’s decision. to‘resolve for itself whether the government’s. conduct was lawful and to
prevent. Regan from. presenting evidence on. that subject.”);, Wnited. States v. Stewart, No. 03 Cr.

717 (MGC), 2004 ‘WL 1.13506, at *1 (S:D:N°Y. Jan..26, 2004) (granting motion. to preclude the:

defendant from “presenting arguments or evidence that would invite the jury fo question the
Government’s motives in. investigating and indicting” the defendant), aff’d. and remanded, 433

This extends to. claims challenging the-motives of a prosécution. In. géricral, “the decision
as to whcther to ‘prosecute gencrally rests within the broad discretion ofthe ‘prosecutor, and a
prosccutor’s. pretrial, charging decision is. presumed lcgitimate.” United States 'vi Sanders, 2.11,
