her of the crimes charged in, the Indictment. ,A’bill, of particulars is therefore necessary to
prevent, unfair surprise at.trial and'to allow:Ms. Maxwell to adequately‘prepare her defense.

It is also critical-that-Ms. Maxwell receive accelerated disclosure:of the government's
witness list, Jencks Act material, Bradv/Giglio material, Rule 404(b) evidence, and any co-
conspirator statements. The government'predictably‘argués that theré is nothing unusual about
the circumstances of Ms. Maxwell’s case that would justify a, deviation. from.customary
production, deadlines for the materials she requests. But Ms. Maxwell’s.case is not a:typical case
and presents. unique circumstances 'that warrant thé relief’she. seeks. The Indictment alleges.
vague conduct that is: over'25 years old.and involves: conduct that allegedly:took place over a,
four-year, period in multiple locations across the country’ and in, at: least. one foretgn, jurisdiction.
Any. relevant documents that may still exist-will take time to. retrieve. The investigation. of
witness statements and any Rule 404(b) evidence will similarly take significant time and
potentially also involve ‘foreign travel. and depositions under Rule. 1.5 of the Federal, Rules of
‘Criminal Procedure. For these:reasons, and the others set: forth below, the Court.should order the
production, of these materials by March 22, 2021.”

Ms. Maxwell has.also provided specific reasons Supporting her requests for. the
production and.inspection, of certain FBI reports and, other documents, suchas a complete copy
of the handwritten, diary, which are‘not included ‘in'the discovery. There is ample-evidence to:
conclude that these: documents :contain material inconsistencies in the prior statements of key
government: witnesses, as well as other exculpatory information for Ms. Maxwell. The Court

should therefore ordér the governnient to produce them.

"Ms. Maxwelloriginally requested that the government produce the requested witness materials by March 12, 2021
(Dkt. 148'at 15, 17), the same: deadline:as the Court imposed onthe government:to:produce documents:related to,
certain non-testifying witnesses. (Dkt. 73).. Because the:Court granted-Ms.. Maxwell’s.request to extend. the filing:
deadline forthe reply:motions by: 10 days ‘from March.S, 202] to March ‘15,.2021,;we have moved forward:our
requested deadlinesfor the;production:of witness materials by: 10 :days to’March'22, 2021.
