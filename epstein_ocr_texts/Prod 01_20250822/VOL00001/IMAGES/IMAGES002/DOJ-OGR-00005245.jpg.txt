Assistant United States Attorneys

Southern District of New York

Cc: Defense Counsel (By ECF)
Based on the information in this letter, the Court will not enter the Defendant's requested order.
See Dkt. No. 346. However, it is the Court's firm expectation that a defendant in a pre-trial
posture like Ms. Maxwell will in most circumstances receive legal mail within approximately
1 business day. Going forward, if another delay occurs, the Defendant may renew the request
for a specific order requiring delivery within that time frame. With this understanding and in
light of the unusually early pre-trial disclosure schedule set by the Court, the Court remains
confident that Ms. Maxwell and her attorneys are fully able to prepare for trial. This resolves
Dkt. No. 346. SO ORDERED.
