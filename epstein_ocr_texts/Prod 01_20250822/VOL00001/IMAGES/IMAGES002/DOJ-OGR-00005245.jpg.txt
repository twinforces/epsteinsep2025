Ce: ‘Defense Counsel, (By ECF)

Based on the information in-this Ictter, the Court will not enter the Defendant's requested order.
See Dkt. No. 346. However, it is the Court's firm expectation that .a defendant in a-pre-trial
posture like Ms. Maxwell will in most.cireumstances reccive legal mail within approximately:

1 business day. Going forward, if another délay occurs, the Defendant may renew the request

for a:specific order requiring delivery within that time frame. With this understanding and jin.
light of the unusually carly pré-trial. disclosure schedule set, by the Court, the Court remains

Dkt. No. 346. SO ORDERED.
