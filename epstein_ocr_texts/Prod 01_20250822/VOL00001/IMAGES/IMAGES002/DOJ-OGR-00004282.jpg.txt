Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document293 Filed 05/25/21 Page 17 of 32

Southern District, of New. York indictment because they arose out of “the same conspiratorial
agreement that, underlay the charges dismissed ‘in‘the Eastern District.” Jd. at 672.

The ‘Second Circuit rejected:this argument finding that, as a general rule; a’plea
agreement only binds the prosecutor’s office that entered into the agreement, unless it
“affirmatively appéars. that the agreément' contemplatés a broader restriction.” /d. However, the
Court highlighted the apparent anomaly of this rule, noting that an.agreement with “the
Government” to dismiss counts of an indictment “might be thought to bar the United States from
reprosécuting the dismisséd charges in any judicial district unless the agreement expressly limits
the‘scope of the agreement to the district in which: the dismissed charges are initially: brought.”
/d. The’Court further explained that: application, of the: “affirmative appearance” rule'was:
nevertheless. appropriate. because it had not been. presented with. a situation where the counts in.
the second prosecution were identical, to the dismissed. counts. ,//. Although the defendants had
argued that’the charges in Counts One and Three of the SDNY indictment “result[ed] from the
same: conspiratorial agreement” as'the dismissed counts in-the: EDNY indictment, the: Court
found that the SDNY charges covered conduct “extending more‘than two years beyond ‘the date
of the period. covéred by the dismisséd charges,” are 'weré theréfore “not-the, same as the charges.
that were dismissed.” /d. As aresult, the Court found that the default rule could be applied in.
that case. Jd. (“[T]he new charges are: sufficiently distinct: at: least/to. warrant: application of the
... Tulé concerning construction of plea agreements.”).

Annabi, therefore, did not hold that-the “affirmative appearance” tule of construction
applies in cases, like this one, where one federal district has agreed that “the United States” will
abandon certain. offenses: as part ofa negotiated agreement, and then.a second federal district

later seeks to charge'those very same offenses based,on the: exact same’ conduct. By its own,
