Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293 Filed 05/25/21 Page17 of 32
Southern District of New York indictment because they arose out of “the same conspiratorial
agreement that underlay the charges dismissed in the Eastern District.” Jd. at 672.

The Second Circuit rejected this argument finding that, as a general rule, a plea
agreement only binds the prosecutor’s office that entered into the agreement, unless it
“affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. However, the
Court highlighted the apparent anomaly of this rule, noting that an agreement with “the
Government” to dismiss counts of an indictment “might be thought to bar the United States from
reprosecuting the dismissed charges in any judicial district unless the agreement expressly limits
the scope of the agreement to the district in which the dismissed charges are initially brought.”
Id. The Court further explained that application of the “affirmative appearance” rule was
nevertheless appropriate because it had not been presented with a situation where the counts in
the second prosecution were identical to the dismissed counts. /d. Although the defendants had
argued that the charges in Counts One and Three of the SDNY indictment “result[ed] from the
same conspiratorial agreement” as the dismissed counts in the EDNY indictment, the Court
found that the SDNY charges covered conduct “extending more than two years beyond the date
of the period covered by the dismissed charges,” are were therefore “not the same as the charges
that were dismissed.” /d. As a result, the Court found that the default rule could be applied in
that case. /d. (“[T]he new charges are sufficiently distinct at least to warrant application of the
... rule concerning construction of plea agreements.”).

Annabi, therefore, did not hold that the “affirmative appearance” rule of construction
applies in cases, like this one, where one federal district has agreed that “the United States” will
abandon certain offenses as part of a negotiated agreement, and then a second federal district
later seeks to charge those very same offenses based on the exact same conduct. By its own
