to: prosecute all of Epstcin’s co-conspirators. These: factors: are: analyzed in the following
discussions throughout this Section of the Report.

As a threshold matter, OPR’s investigation of the subjects’ decisions, and actions. in. the
Epstcin.matter- uncovered no evidence:of corruption such.as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or
personal. consideration. In addition, OPR, examined the extensive contemporancous documentary:
record, interviewed. witnesses, and, questioned ‘the subject. attorneys. The evidenee shows three
sets of issucs influcneced Acosta’s decision to resolve the case through the NPA. The first=of.
main Conéerh to Acosta—involved considerations, of federalism. and. deference to state authority.
‘The second arose from. an. assessment. by Acosta’s ‘scnior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and
Lourie—that the: case carried substantial litigation risks, including. both witness issucs and. what:
some viewed. as ‘a novel application of certain, federal statutes fo the facts of. the Epstein, case.°""
The third ‘was,.Acosta’s aim of obtaining a greater measure of justice for victims of Epstcin’s
conduct: and for the community. than that-proposed by the state.

Although the NPA and the process for reaching, it can be criticized, as OPR. docs, OPR did.
not find. evidence supporting a. conclusion. that. the subjects were’ motivated. by a desire’ to benefit.
Epstein. for personal. gain or because of other improper: considerations, such as Epstcin’s wealth,
Status, or associations. That is fot to sdy that Epstein :reccived no benefit, from his enormous
wealth. He: was able to hire nationally. known attorneys who had. prestige, skill, and ‘extensive:
‘experience in federal and, state:criminal law:and in.conducting negotiations. He had the resources
to finance an aggressive approach to the case that,included. the preparation of multiple written
‘submissions reflecting cxtensive: research. and analysis, as. well. as multiple in-person, mectings
involving x several of his attorneys and, USAO personnel. He assembled,a defense team well'versed.,
in. the USAO and the Department, with the knowledge to mancuver through the Department’s
various levels and offices, a process: unknown to many: criminal. defense attorneys and. infrequently
prominent. attorneys i 1S snot unusual. i in 1 criminal: cases involving « corporations and ‘their officers 0 or:
certain other white collar: defendants, but itis not-so typical ‘for defendants charged ‘with sex crimes
or violent offenses. Nonctheless, while récognizing that Epstcin’s wealth played a role in, the
‘outcome because: he was sable to: hire skilled and assertive attorncys, OPR concludes ‘that. the:
subjects were not motivated.to resolve the federal, investigation to Epstcin’s bencfit: by improper
factors.

A. OPR.Found No: Evidence of Criminal Corruption, Such as Bribery; Gratuity,
or Illegal Political or Personal Consideration

Some public criticism, of the USAO’s handling of ‘the Epstein matter implied, that ‘the:
subjects’ decisions or actions may have been motivated by criminal corruption, although. no
Specific information substantiating such. implications was identified. Throughout its investigation,

208 Sloman.asserted throughout his OPR interview: that ‘he did ‘not:participate in substantive discussions about!
the, Epstein inv estigation before, the NPA. was: signed, and his attorney.ar gued in.his comments on OPR’s draft:report:
that: OPR: should not attribute to Sloman. any input in, Acosta’s decisions about how-to resolve; the; case. ‘However;
Sloman was'included in numerous emails:discussing the merits-of and:issues relating’ tothe investigations. participated
in: meetings with the. defense team, .and;,according,to,Acostay was one. of.the senior managers whom Acosta consulted

in. determining how. to:resolve the: Epsteinzi inv: ‘estigation.
