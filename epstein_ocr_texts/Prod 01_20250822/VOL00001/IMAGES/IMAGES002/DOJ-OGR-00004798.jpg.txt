misleading. Dkt. No. 134, at 14. In any event, the Court is not without guidance on when a
prosecutor’s misrepresentation requires a court to suppress evidence. Precedent requires courts
to adhere to the standards governing analogous Fourth Amendment claims when asked to
suppress evidence under their inherent authority. See Lambus, 897 F.3d at 401-02.

The Supreme Court has set out a clear standard governing when a misrepresentation to a
magistrate in a warrant affidavit justifies suppression of evidence obtained as a result. See
Franks v. Delaware, 438 U.S. 154 (1978). That standard requires more than an inadvertent
misstatement. “To suppress evidence obtained pursuant to an affidavit containing erroneous
information, the defendant must show that: (1) the claimed inaccuracies or omissions are the
result of the affiant’s deliberate falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth; and (2) the alleged
falsehoods or omissions were necessary to the issuing judge’s probable cause finding.” United
States v. Canfield, 212 F.3d 713, 717-18 (2d Cir. 2000) (cleaned up). The Supreme Court’s
decision in Franks forecloses the argument that all misstatements to a court—even all intentional
misstatements—necessarily require suppression. A defendant cannot circumvent this standard
by couching the same arguments in due process or the court’s inherent authority instead. See
Payner, 447 U.S. at 736.

Franks also defines the standard governing when a defendant is entitled to an evidentiary
hearing on a motion to suppress based on the Government’s misrepresentation to a court. To
justify an evidentiary hearing, a defendant must make a “substantial preliminary showing” of a
deliberately or recklessly false statement and that the alleged false statement was necessary to the
court’s decision. Franks, 438 U.S. at 155. “Allegations of negligence or innocent mistake are
insufficient.” /d. at 171.
