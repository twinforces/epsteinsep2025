LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI GC: STERNHEIA

During a recent sentencing ‘in which defense counsel described. deplorable conditions at the
MCC, Judge McMahon acknowledged. that the defendant had. been subjected to conditions as
“disgusting, inhuman as anything'l’ve heard. about any Colombian prison, but more’ so because
‘we’re supposed to be better'than that.’ United States v. Tiffany Days, 19 Cr.'619. (CM),
Sentencing, Transcript at 19 (annexed as Exhibit A.): Addressing both the MCC and the MDC,
Judge McMahon boldly. stated:

[T]here is no. excuse for the conditions in those two institutions. . .. [Detainees]

shouldn't suffer ‘for the incompetence. of the. United ‘States Department of Justice

and its subsidiary-agency, the Bureau of Prisons. I will:do what.I can:to bring your

situation to the pcople who, if they give a damn, might-do something.
Exhibit A at-20.

Numerous complaints have been. brought to the Court’s attention regarding recurring,
problematic conditions atthe: MDC. and over-management of Ms. Maxwell. ‘Little if anything
has bech. done té improve Ms. Maxwell’s conditions; arid ‘the govérnment’s‘updates tothe. Court
embolden,the MDE to maintain, the: status quo. The ever-changing rules are negatively: impacting
‘Ms. Maxwell’s, ability to:prepare for trial and are interfering with privileged. attorney-client
‘communication. The: hyper-surveillance of Ms. Maxwell and counsel. during legal visits is highly:
‘inappropriate and, invasive. At a-minimum, this should not be sanctioned by the Court.

Very truly yours,

BOBBI C. STERNHEIM.

‘ec? Counsel ‘for both. pattics
