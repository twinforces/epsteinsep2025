assistanee when it interferes In certain ways ‘with the ability of counsel to make independent
‘decisions about.how to conduct'the defense.”).

If the court were to.act outside its statutory authority and.compel defense counsel to
disclose defense:material-prematurely, then Ms. Maxwell’s Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights
would. be endangered. While the aims of judicial. cconomy.and efficiency may be served by
ordering the defense to disclose, prospective witnesses, such policy goals, however laudable,
carinot.trump fundamental. libertics. “Inthe administration:of criminal justice, courts must
carefully: guard against dilution of the principle that guilt is to: be established’ by probative:
evidence and beyond .a reasonable doubt.” /:s/elle,; 425 U.S. at: 503.

III. Procedural Rules Aside, the Government Must Timely Disclose Any Brady and

Giglio Material.

Brady and.its progeny impose upon.-the, government broad duties of disclosure. See Brady
v. Maryland, 373 US. 83, 87 (1.963) (“the suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable
‘to an’ accused ‘upon‘request violates duc:process where the evidence’ is ‘material cither to guilt. or
to:punishment”); United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985) (defining materiality);
Strickler v.‘Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 28 1-82 (1999) (same); Giglio v; United States, 405'U.S. 150,
154 (1972) (government has duty'to disclose:material. affecting reliability of government
witnesses).

The court’s authority, or lack-thereof, to order disclosures, under Rules 1.6'and_ 26.2 does
not affect'the, defendant’s right to Brady material. “It.is, of course, a fundamental axiom of
American_law, rooted in our‘history as a.people:and requiring no citations to. authority, that the

requirements of the Constitution prevail. over:a. statute in the event of a conflict.” Coppa, 267
