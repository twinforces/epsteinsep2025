2016 deposition transcript. (See 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 1077). Maxwell appealed Judge
Preska’s order, arguing that the court abused its discretion in ordering the unsealing of the
deposition materials and that Maxwell’s interests outweighed the public’s interests in access to the
materials. Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 20-2413 (2d Cir.), (Dkt. No. 140-1 at 2). On October 19, 2020,
the Second Circuit found that Judge Preska “correctly held that the deposition materials are judicial
documents to which the presumption of public access attaches, and did not abuse its discretion in
rejecting Maxwell’s meritless arguments that her interests superseded the presumption of access.”
(Id. at 3).

On October 22, 2020, Maxwell’s April 2016 deposition was publicly filed. (See 15 Civ.
7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 1137-13).

On January 27, 2021, a redacted version of Maxwell’s July 2016 deposition was publicly
filed. (See 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No. 1201-14). On February 11, 2021, another version of the
July 2016 deposition was publicly filed with fewer redactions. (See 15 Civ. 7433 (LAP), Dkt. No.
1212-1).
