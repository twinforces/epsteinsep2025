D. The Parties Continue to Negotiate but Primarily Focus ona Potential Plea, to
Federal. Charges

During the remainder. of September, Villafafia:conducted plea:negotiations and drafted the
final NPA, mainly with.Epstein attorney Jay Lefkowitz. Tn a: September . 13, 2007 email to CEOS
Chief Oosterbaan, Villafafia reported that. the plea negotiations. were “getting fast and furious.”
She said ‘thatthe defense wanted to establish.a “victim’s fund” through which Epstcin could‘make
‘payments to. the victiiis, rather than having the victims file individual. § 2255, court actions for
damages, which she speculated was “to keep ‘this stuff out ofthe public [c]ourt files.”

According to the email documentation, by Friday, September 14, 2007, the partics had.
moved. toward.a. “hybrid” federal plea agreement, incorporating a plea ‘to, state charges, which
would, allow Epstein. to serve his sentence for all the charges concurrently in a. federal prison.
Villafania informed Acosta, Sloman, Louric, and.other collcagues that negotiations with.Lefkowitz
had. resulted. in a tentative agreement for. Epstein to plead to two federal charges: harassment to
prevent.a. witness from reporting a crime (18 U.S.C. § 1512(d)(2), which was then a one-year
misdemeanor), and, ‘simple assault on, an, airplane (18 U.S.C. §113(a)(5), a six-month,
misdemeanor). Villafaha reported that Lefkowitz “put in a pitch for only’ 12: months, ‘put in.a.
pitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a. 20-month:recommendation, and ‘we decided that we would
be:stuck. with the 18 months.”

Later'that day, Villafafia-sent to Lefkowitz a draft “hybrid” plea agreement-andinformation,
mirroring the. agreement in principle she had described to her supervisors, but:which she noted had.
“not! yet been. blessed” by them. The agreement provided ‘that. Epstein ‘would. plead guilty to. the
two federal. charges: for: which. the ‘partics would jointly recommend that he be sentenced. to the
‘statutory;maximum penalty: of 18 months’ imprisonment.followed by 2 years of supervised | release,
and, that he would also plead. guilty to the state registrable offense of procurement of minors to
engage in ‘prostitution, for which, Epstein, and the State! Attorney’s Office would make a joint,
binding. recommendation that he be sentenced to serve at Icast.20 months in.prison ‘followed by 10
months of community:control.(home.confinement). Although not:specificd in-the-draft:agreement,
the negotiations evidently expected the federal and.state terms would run: concurrently. In addition.
to payment of restitution, Epstein would not. oppose jurisdiction or victim, status for any of the
victims identified, in the ‘federal inyvestigation—at that point 'specificd as numbering 40—who
clécted. to, file suit, for'damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255. A guardian. ad litém would. be appointed.
to communicate. with:the. defens¢ on the victims" behalf

Lourie, however, quickly made clear that-he was not in favor of the proposal. In response
to Villafafia’s cmail dbout.the ‘potential federal charges, ‘but after Villafafia sent'the proposal to
Lefkowitz, Lourie: told, her; “The assault: [charge] sounds like a stretch and factually [is] sort of
silly!" Lourie also told Sloman, Acosta, and another supervisor that he did. not “like the assault
charge” and belicved that it would not “go:smooth-with every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we
need[,] Ict?s find a different. charge.” On Saturday, Scptember 15, 2007, Villafafia. emailed.
Lefkowitz, using her personal,cmail. address, reporting that she had ‘ ‘gotten some:ncgative reaction,

a. The charge: was to be based:on “an incident in, whichEpstein ‘put. great:pressure”. . . on [one of his female

assistants] to call the girls to: set up appointments!”
