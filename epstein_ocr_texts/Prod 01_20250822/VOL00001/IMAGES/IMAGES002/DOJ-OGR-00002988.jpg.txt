denied, 546 U.S. 1007 (2005)); United States v. Brown, 800 F. App’x 455, 461 (9th Cir. 2020)
(“Because Congress evinced a clear intent to extend the statute of limitations for these types of
crimes in its amendments, and because there is no ex post facto problem here, the prosecution was
timely.”), cert. denied, No. 20-5064, -- S.Ct. -- , 2021 WL 78235 (Jan. 11, 2021); United States v.
Pierre-Louis, No. 16 Cr. 541 (CM), 2018 WL 4043140, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018) (denying
motion to dismiss child exploitation charges as time-barred) (““Defendant’s argument rests on the
erroneous premise that the law requires the defendant to have committed the charged offense after
the effective date of the extension of the statute of limitations for the charge to not be time-barred.

425 F. Supp. 3d 619, 624-30 (E.D. Va. 2019) (holding that the 2003 amendment of Section 3283
applies to pre-enactment conduct).

Co. Sec. Litig. (“Enterprise”), 391 F.3d 401, 405-06 (2d Cir. 2004)). However, “when a statute
