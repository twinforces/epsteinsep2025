that come within the national investigation and prosecution priorities established
by the Department are more likely to satisfy this requirement than other matters.

(2) The prior prosecution must have left the substantial federal interest “demonstrably
unvindicated.” In general, the Department presumes that a prior prosecution has
vindicated federal interests, but that presumption may be overcome in certain
circumstances. As relevant here, the presumption may be overcome when the
choice of charges in the prior prosecution was based on factors such as
incompetence, corruption, intimidation, or undue influence. The presumption may
be overcome even when the prior prosecution resulted in a conviction, if the prior
sentence was “manifestly inadequate in light of the federal interest involved and a
substantially enhanced sentence—including forfeiture and restitution as well as
imprisonment and fines—is available through the contemplated federal
prosecution.”

(3) The government must believe that the defendant’s conduct constitutes a federal
offense, and that the admissible evidence probably will be sufficient to obtain and
sustain a conviction.

However, the satisfaction of the prerequisites does not require a prosecutor to proceed with a
federal investigation or charges nor is the Department required to approve the proposed
prosecution.

The Petite policy cautions that whenever a matter involves overlapping federal and state
jurisdiction, federal prosecutors should consult with their state counterparts “to determine the most
appropriate single forum in which to proceed to satisfy the substantial federal and state interests
involved.” If a substantial question arises as to whether the Petite policy applies to a particular
prosecution, the prosecutor should submit the matter to the appropriate Assistant Attorney General
for resolution. Prior approval from the appropriate Assistant Attorney General must be obtained
before bringing a prosecution governed by this policy.

3. USAM Provisions Relating to Plea Agreements

Federal prosecutors have discretion to resolve an investigation or pending case through a
plea agreement. USAM §§ 9-27.330; 9-27.400. Negotiated pleas are also explicitly sanctioned
by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1).!°3 Regardless of whether the plea agreement is
offered pre-charge or post-charge, the prosecutor’s plea bargaining “must honestly reflect the
totality and seriousness of the defendant’s conduct.” USAM § 9-27.400, comment.!°4 The
importance of selecting a charge that reflects the seriousness of the conduct is echoed in USAM
§ 9-27.430, which directs the prosecutor to require a defendant to plead to an offense that
represents the most serious readily provable charge consistent with the nature and extent of the
128 As previously noted, Rule 11(c)(1)(C) permits the parties to agree to resolve the case in exchange for a
specific sentence, subject to the court’s acceptance of the agreement.

194 See also USAM § 9-27.300 (“Once the decision to prosecute has been made, the attorney for the government
should charge . . . the most serious offense that is consistent with the nature of the defendant’s conduct, and that is
likely to result in a sustainable conviction.”).
