20-CR-330 (AJN)
Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell seeks an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to Rule
17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. As detailed in the subpoena and Maxwell’s
moving papers, she seeks authorization to serve a subpoena to the law firm of Boies, Schiller and
Flexner LLP. BSF has filed a letter in opposition to the subpoena request. Additionally, the
Government submitted a letter requesting that it be given notice of all pending and future
subpoenas applications, an opportunity to challenge them, and copies of any documents
produced. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies Maxwell’s motion as to Requests 1
through 8 and Request 12 and reserves judgment on Requests 9 through 11. The Court also
denies the Government’s requests, though it will direct the Government to notify the Court of its
views as to Requests 9 through 11.

I. Legal Standard

Rule 17(c) permits subpoenas ordering the production of “books, papers, documents,
data, or other objects.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). When the subpoena seeks the production of
personal or confidential information about a victim, it may be served on a third party only by
court order. Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).
