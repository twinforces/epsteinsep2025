certain potentially relevant materials, to'the extent they’ existed, from.a United States Attorney’s
Office in Georgia, which consist of a small amount of'witness statements.

With respect. to the SDFL file, based on an, initial review,’ the Government. has. not.
identified. any materials that would be subject. to disclosure under Rule 16. This is unsurprising:
because: discoverable :matcrials such. as subpoena ‘returns and search warrant materials appear to
have: been. maintained, in ‘the ‘FBI ‘Florida Office’s file. Although the Government: did. identify
‘materials that are broadly related to the NPA, the Government has not. identified, any items ‘that:
would.constitute.Brady material. The Government is continuing to:review the SDFL file for Giglio
and Jeneks Act material. And of course, to the extent; the Government identifies potential. Brady
material or material. discoverable under Rule 16 that is not duplicative of prior productions, it will.

promptly producc it.

' In.the:fall of.2020, SDFL: agreed to:provide SDNY with a copy:of all-of its files relating, to Jeffrey:
Epstein, so that SDNY could review: those ‘files for disclosures. Those files:consist of 28 boxes,

which contain, material relating both to the investigation of Epstcin and a civil lawsuit: filed by
victims challenging the NPA.'‘under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act. The ‘Government hired ‘a,
vendor to scanthe. files in. these boxes, but'technical. difficultics with that ‘vendor-prevented those
scans from being loaded :into:'a document review: platform. until several wecks: ago. Before those
scans were loaded intothe document:review platform, the Government conducted an initial review
of the scans in their native form.
