2. ‘Leading to the Meeting with Defense Counsel, Investigative Steps Are:
Postponed, and the Defense Continues 'to Oppose Villafaiia’s Efforts to

On August 8, 2007, Villafafia.informed Acosta that she had. spoken. with. Oosterbaan, who
was willing to join.a'‘mecting with the defense; although, he could not do so in, person ‘until after
August 21, he was willing’to participate by phone in, order “to stay firm on. our August J,7th,
deéadlitic.” Villafana also reiterated, that she wanted to contact. Epstcin’s assistants in New York
and 'to interview some of Epstcin’s colleagues and former employces there. Noting that “there was
some concern. about. [taking the proposed Investigative: steps] while we are trying to negotiate a
plea,” Villafafia. asked Acosta. for.g guidance. Lourie also emailed. Acosta.and: Sloman, _ asking: that:
the USAO “stick to our deadline if possible.” ‘Lourie: pointed, out: that CEOS “has no approval
authority” and opined. it was “a. bit..extreme to allow: the defense! to kecp arguing this [casc] to
different agencics.” .Acosta. replied, “This 'will end up [at the Department] anyhow, if'we don’t.
mect with:them. I’d rather keep it-here. Brin[g]ing [the Chief of’ CEOS] in-visibly docs so. If our
deadline has:to slip a bit... it’s worth.it.”

As a.result, the investigative steps were postponed. On August. 10,2007, Villafafia.emailed,
Louric¢: inquiring whether shé could “still go ahead” with the New York trip and whether'she could,
oppose Black’s: request to ‘stay: the. litigation concerning the government’s efforts ‘to ‘obtain.
Epstein’s computer ‘equipment: until after Acosta’s mecting, with the:defense team. Villafafia was
reluctant.to delay, the litigation and reported. to ‘Lourie that. agents recently had ‘interviewed. a girl
who began:sccing Epstein at age 14 and. who was photographed in the nude'by an Epstein.assistant.
On.August 13, 2007, Villafafia advised, Black that the USAO was not-willing to agree to a stay of
the litigation. However, Saiichez' reached out to. Loutie.on August’ 22, 2007, and obtained his
agreement to a joint-request for a stay-until the:weck after Acosta’s:meeting with defense ‘counsel,
which was scheduled for September, 7, ‘2007.

Villafafia told, OPR. that, in. her opinion, the defense cfforts to, put off ‘the litigation
coneeming,.the computers was “further.cvidence of the importance of [this] evidence.” 7 Villafafia.
suspected the: computers contained evidence ‘that: “would ‘have put this case completely to bed.”

”6 In-context, Acosta appeared to mean:that-although he was.not concerned about'the Department: reviewing the

NPA or its ‘terms, he did have concerns that: the Department would decide the USAO should not haye accepted the
case’because of a‘lackof federal interest-and:might direct the USAO to-end.its;involvement in.the matter:
