Defense counsel’s ‘investigative cfforts should commence promptly and should.

explore appropriate avenues ‘that. reasonably’ might Icad to information relevant to

the merits. of the matter; consequences of the criminal proceedings, and ‘potential

dispositions and penalties. Although investigation -will. vary depending on ‘the.

circumstances, it should always be shaped. by what is in the: client’s best: interests,

after consultation with the client. Defense counsel’s investigation, of the merits of

the criminal charges should include cfforts to secure relevant information. in. ‘the:

possession of'the prosecution, law enforeement, authoritics, and others, as well. as

independent :investigation. Counsel’s. investigation should. also iriclude. evaluation

of the prosecution’s evidence (including, possible re-testing .or re-evaluation of:

physical, forensic, and cxpert evidence) and consideration, of inconsistencies,

potential avenues ‘of impeachment of prosecution, witnesses, and other: ‘possible
suspects and alternative theories that the evidence may raise.

Most significantly, because the government: expressly represented in;their*prior
commiunications to the, Court’ and to counsel that they’would not be, secking to introduce
‘evidence from, the 2000s (apart from the perjury counts), counsel for, Ms. Maxwell has already
‘undertaken.a review'of the discovery. focused on the 1990s, and the allegations inthe S1
indictment. Now that the government has. complctely: abandoned that-position and extended the
conspiracy to include a.time frame up to,2004, Ms. Maxwell and. her counsel, must. re-review: the
discovery she has already painstakingly reviewed, to, comb ‘for evidence related, to, the new time

period.

E. Continuing problems with the government’s, evidence production require
additional time

In. addition. to the “new” 20,000 pages of exculpatory evidence not-yct provided.to Ms.
Maxwell, defense counsel. and:Ms. Maxwell have encountered. significant obstaeles in/the revicw
of the discovery produced prior to April.13". The production made to Ms. ‘Maxwell at the MDC
‘contains hundreds or thousands of missing Batcs-numbers. Morcover, because the'time period

of the 2000s is now relevant-to the trial, Ms. Maxwell ‘and her counsel must now carefully review.
