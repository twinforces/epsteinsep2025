Defense counsel’s investigative efforts should commence promptly and should

explore appropriate avenues that reasonably might lead to information relevant to

the merits of the matter, consequences of the criminal proceedings, and potential

dispositions and penalties. Although investigation will vary depending on the

circumstances, it should always be shaped by what is in the client’s best interests,

after consultation with the client. Defense counsel’s investigation of the merits of

the criminal charges should include efforts to secure relevant information in the

possession of the prosecution, law enforcement authorities, and others, as well as

independent investigation. Counsel’s investigation should also include evaluation

of the prosecution’s evidence (including possible re-testing or re-evaluation of

physical, forensic, and expert evidence) and consideration of inconsistencies,

potential avenues of impeachment of prosecution witnesses, and other possible
suspects and alternative theories that the evidence may raise.

discovery she has already painstakingly reviewed to comb for evidence related to the new time
period.

E. Continuing problems with the government’s evidence production require

additional time

In addition to the “new” 20,000 pages of exculpatory evidence not yet provided to Ms.
Maxwell, defense counsel and Ms. Maxwell have encountered significant obstacles in the review
of the discovery produced prior to April 13". The production made to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC
contains hundreds or thousands of missing Bates-numbers. Moreover, because the time period
of the 2000s is now relevant to the trial, Ms. Maxwell and her counsel must now carefully review
