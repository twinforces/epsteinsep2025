Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:
Tam writing in response to your April 26, 2021, Order seeking information regarding an
alleged incident involving Ghislaine Maxwell, Register No. 02879-509, at the Metropolitan
Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York (MDC Brooklyn) as relayed by her counsel in an April
26, 2021, letter.
Pursuant to MDC Brooklyn policy, Institutional Supplement BRO-5267.09A, Inmate Visiting
Correctional Services, inmates may carry legal materials to the visiting area which pertain to their
current case. Visiting Room Officers inspect the legal materials for contraband. Inmates are not
permitted to carry out any items other than those they were allowed to be take into the Visiting
Room. Visiting Room Officers monitor inmate visits and if they become aware of any articles
passed between the inmate and the visitors, or “if there is any reasonable basis to suspect
materials are being passed between inmates and visitors, the Visiting Room Officer may examine
the item(s).”
Legal staft is responsible for assigning inmates and their attorneys to particular room.
However, this is subject to change by the Visiting Room Officer, who is ultimately responsible
for room and seating assignments. MDC Brooklyn sets forth these rules in Admissions and
Orientation Handbook, which is given to each inmate upon admission to the institution.
