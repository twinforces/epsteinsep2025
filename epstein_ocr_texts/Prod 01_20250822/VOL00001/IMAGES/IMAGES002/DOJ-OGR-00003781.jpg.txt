investigation firm). “The governing rule in:these circumstances is;that:the possessor-of the
claimed privilege or rightmay intervene to assert it.” Jd: (quoting Appeal of Hughés, 633 F.2d
282, 288 (3d:Cir, 1980)). See also US Bank Nat. Ass*n v. PHE Variable Ins. Co.,.No. 12:CIV:.
6811. CM JCF; 2012 WL 5395249, at*2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 5, 2012) (“A party [has] standing to
challenge’. .... a Subpoena. served.on a-non-party ... . [when] the moving party assert[s] some right
or privilege personal to it, such as an interest in proprictary; confidential information that would.
be disclosed. or’an. interest in maintaining a privilege that‘would be breached by disclosure.”
(citing cases)). In turn, in determining whether there:is standing, “[c}ourts should consider:
whether the.information itself is private, confidential, privileged, or highly sensitive; and not the

In. UnitedStates vy. Lavender, the Second. Circuit held that while a defendant could not.
file an.interlocutory appeal of the district court’s denial of his motion to quash a-third-party
subpoena, he was “free to raise his Fourth Amendment claims via motions to suppress... . .” 583.
F.2d '630,.632.(2d Cir. 1978). Since: Maxwell never. had-notice of the subpocna.to Boies. Schiller,
she is doing here exactly what Lavender allows: filing a:motion to.suppréss.

To be sure, if the government were right—that the mere fact of a third-party’s possession,
of property climinates a ‘defendant’s standing—then Carpenter'v. United States would have
come out differently, since the-defendant’s-historical cell-sit¢ location. information. was in the.
possession of MetroPCS and Sprint. 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2212 (2018). But the United States:
Supreme Court rejected application. of the third-party doctrine for two reasons, as this Court

should here.
