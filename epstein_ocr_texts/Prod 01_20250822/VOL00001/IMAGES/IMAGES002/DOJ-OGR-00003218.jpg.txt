deposition:

This was a casc that I felt absolutcly:needed the.attention of the State
Attorney’s Office, that: needed to be prosecuted i in, state court. It’s
not gencrally something | that’s prosecuted ‘in a federal court. And I
knew that it didn’t ‘really matter what the facts were in. this case, it
was'pretty clear to:me that Mr. Krischer did. not want, to prosecute
this ‘case:

On May’ 1, '2006,.Reiter submitted.to Krischer probable cause affidavits and ‘a case filing
package relating to ‘Epstein, oneof his personal, assistants, and.a, young local; woman,whom.Epstein,
first’ victimized and then‘used_to recruit other girls. In his transmittal letter, which’ was later'made:
public, Reiter criticized. Krischer, noting that he found the State.Attornicy’s Office’s “treatment of
these: cases [to be] highly unusual.”'® Reiter-urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course ‘that.
your office’s handling of this matter has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from.
