evidence can be both powerful and quite misleading because of the difficulty in evaluating it,”?
and for all the other reasons given below, this Court should preclude Rocchio from testifying.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The government has endorsed Rocchio as an expert witness. EXHIBIT 1. Although the
government says that Rocchio is a “clinical instructor of psychiatry and human behavior,” the
government’s notice does not say in what specialty it proposes this Court endorse her. /d. at 1-3.

Instead, the government broadly asserts that Rocchio has “treated patients with trauma,
including sexual trauma in childhood and adolescence,” has “received specialized training in
traumatic stress, sexual abuse, and clinical and forensic psychology,” and has “written,
presented, and taught about the assessment and treatment of trauma, among other topics.” /d. at
1-2.

According to the government, Rocchio intends to testify on the following topics:

Individuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted by perpetrators of

sexual abuse. Sexual abuse of minors frequently occurs through the use of

manipulation or coercion in the context of an established relationship that is

developed over time, rather than through the use of forcible rape. Minor victims are

often subject to a strategic pattern of behaviors, often called grooming, that can take

a variety of forms and function to render the victims vulnerable to abuse, to obscure

the nature of the abuse, and to build trust and attachment with their abuser. The

relationship of trust and attachment can prevent victims from being aware that what

they are experiencing is abuse and can prevent disclosure. Minor victims therefore

may not identify themselves as victims of abuse while it is ongoing, and may not

recognize the consequences of that abuse until adulthood. Repeated exploitation

and abuse can increase the likelihood of victimization later in life and can result in

long-term traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it occurs in

the context of complex trauma. The presence of other individuals can facilitate the

sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is also expected to testify that nondisclosure,

incremental disclosure, and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for

a variety of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive events

is impacted by a number of factors, including the circumstances surrounding the

trauma. Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated any specific victim in this case, and the
