Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:
The Court has received an exchange of letters that pertain to an incident that took place
on April 24, 2021. Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258, 259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms.
Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her lawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by
providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an in-person attorney-client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms.
Maxwell’s lawyers categorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against
MDC staff based on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates
no views as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of either
side’s allegations. This Court’s obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure that the
defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in confidential attorney-
client communications, and prepare for trial.
Mindful of that obligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After
receiving the defense’s first letter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to show cause
why the Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted in
part defense counsel’s original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to certain
questions about the April 24, 2021 incident and the procedures in place to ensure the
confidentiality of Ms. Maxwell’s lawyer-client communications. Dkt. No. 255. Defense
