that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was motivated by such concerns,’
Congress nonetheless chose to address those concerns by eliminating the retroactivity provision
altogether, rather than simply modifying it to prohibit the revival of time-barred charges. If
Congress had intended to distinguish between live charges and time-barred charges, it could
easily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent
that the 2003 Amendment not be applied retroactively. The Court may not override that clear
intent merely because doing so may have been a broader measure than necessary to address the
concerns Senator Leahy articulated.”

The government also contends that heeding Congress’ specific intent not to make the
2003 Amendment retroactive would “undermine Congress’s plain purpose” in enacting it—i.e.,
to extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could seek justice for child sex abuse
victims who come forward or identify their abusers after a delay.” See Opp. 31. But statutory
amendments, by nature, are designed to remedy perceived deficiencies in existing law, and thus a
decision not to apply any amendment retroactively will typically limit, or “undermine,” the
effectuation of that purpose. For that reason, as the Supreme Court acknowledged in Landgraf,
an amendment’s purpose is immaterial to a retroactivity analysis:
"While Senator Leahy’s floor statement confirms that Congress’ rejection of the retroactivity provision was
intentional, his statement as to why the provision was rejected cannot be ascribed to other members of Congress.
* The government implicitly asks the Court to disregard the voluminous authority emphasizing the significant weight
to be given congressional consideration and explicit rejection of a proposed statutory provision (see Mem. 7-8),
relying solely on the Supreme Court’s treatment in Landgraf of an omission from the comprehensive Civil Rights
Act of 1991 of an “elaborate retroactivity provision” that had been included in a vetoed civil rights bill passed by a
prior Congress. See Opp. 31 n.14 (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 256). That omission is not analogous. There was
no indication in Landgraf that Congress had even considered, let alone rejected, such a provision in the legislation it
ultimately enacted. Moreover, the provision from the prior Congress’ bill was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply
prescribe retroactivity, as the provision stricken from the 2003 Amendment would have done, but assigned a series
of different effective dates to different subsections. Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 255 n.8. The absence of such a detailed
scheme from subsequent legislation, passed by a subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably interpreted as a clear
reflection of congressional intent regarding retroactivity, and there is no indication in the opinion that any party
argued otherwise.
