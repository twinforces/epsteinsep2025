that Congress’ rejection, of the retroactivity provision, was motivated by:such.concerns, '
Congress nonetheless chose-to, address those concerns by eliminating’the retroactivity provision
altogether, rather'than simply modifying it to prohibit. the revival of-time-barred charges. If
Congress had, intended, to distinguish between live charges and;time-barred charges, it;could
easily have done so. Its decision to drop the provision completely demonstrates a clear intent
that the 2003 Amendment nor'be applied retroactively. The:Court may:not override that clear.
intent merely because doing so may have’ been'a. broader measure‘than necessary: to address the.
concerms Senator Leahy aiticulated.”

The government also ‘contends that heeding Congress” specific intent not to make the
2003.Amendment retroactive would “undermine ‘Congress’s:plain:purpose” in enacting it=/.e.,
to'extend the limitations period “to ensure that prosecutors could. seek justice for. child sex abuse:
victims who come. forward or identify their abusers after a delay: See Opp: 31. But statutory
ameéndivients, by‘natiire, are designed 'to remedy percéived deficiéncies in. existing law; and thus.a
decision.not to apply wny-amendment retroactively will. typically limit, or “undermine,” the
effectuation. of that purpose. For that reason,.as the Supreme Court. acknowledged in Landgraf,

an. amendinent’s. purpose is imimaterial-to a.retroactivity-anal ysis:

' While ‘Senator:Leahy’s: floor statement confirms that Congress’ ‘rejection.of the-retroactivity provision.was:
intentional, his‘statement as:to wiathe provision was:rejected.cannot:be ascribed.to other; members of Congress.

° The government implicitly asks*the Court'to disregard the voluminous authority. emphasizing the significant weight
‘to. be piven congressional. consideration and explicit:rejection-of a, proposed statutory provision:(see Mem. 7-8),
relying solely onthe Supreme Court’s treatment in-andgraf ofan omission from.the comprehensive Civil'Rights
Act of 9911 of an.“claborate retroactivity:provision” that had been included.:in a.vetoed-civil rights bill-passed’by’a
prior. Congress. See Opp. '3.L.14 (quoting Landgraf, 511 US. at 256). Thatomission.s not analogous... Thereswas
no indication in-Zandgraf that Congress had. even considered, let:alone rejected, such a.provision.in the:legislation.it
ultimately enacted. ‘Moreover, the provision-fronythe prior Congress’ bill:;was indeed “elaborate”: it did not simply’
prescribe:retroactivily;.as the provision stricken from the 2003.Amendment:would have done, but assigned a. series
of different effective: dates’to different subsections. Eandgraf, 5.1 US. at 255 n.8. The absenceof such a detailed.
scheme from. subsequent legislation, passed. by, a, subsequent Congress, could not be reasonably. interpreted as.a clear
reflection:of congressional intent regarding:retroactivity;:and.there is no indication-in the:opinion that any:party
argued otherwise.
