Martindell, the: district court opined. that had. the Government obtained judicial relief to issuc: an.
uncontested. subpoena, for documents—precisely the scenario here—such relief would be
appropriate. Chemical Bank, 154 F.R:D. at 94.

Second, any-presumption:against:modification of'a.protective order is unreasonable where,
as here, the: protective order is on its face temporary or limited. Such protective: orders * “that are
on their face temporary or limited may not, justify reliance by the parties [and] in such
circumstances reliance maybe unreasonable:” S-ELC. v. TheSireet.com, 273 F 3d 222, 230-31 (2d,
Cir. 2001). “Where:a litigant or deponent could not reasonably have relied on the continuation of
a. protective order”’—for example, where such. an, order ‘was limited ‘to ‘the pretrial Stages. of'
litigation—* a court.may properly permit modification..of the order.” Jd. (citing,./n re “Agent
Orange?’ Prod, Liab, Litig., 82). F.2d 139,147 (2d.Cir. 1987)); see: also Allen v. City of New York,
420 F:Supp:2d.295, 301 (S:D.N.-Y.. 2006) (Mag. J. Gorenstein): (analyzing the. differently- situated
interests of civil litigants but ‘where, as here, the relevant: protective order specified, that..a, party’

onits face). In-such.a:case, “‘[w]hether to lifttor modify.a protective orderiis a decision: committed
to the sound discretion, of the: trial court.” JAeStreet.com, 273 ‘F.3d. at: 23'] (modification in,
original) (citing Jn re Agent Orange, 821 F.3d. at 147) (additional, citations omitted). ‘Here, the
parties in the Litigation explicitly. contemplated the public: disclosure of such information at: ‘trial

described. above. See Prot. Order.at.5 (“This Protective Order.:shall have no force and effect. on.
the usc of any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION at trial in.this matter.”). The partics could not
have—as, for example, they ‘might, in, a ‘bankruptcy proceeding such, as in Subpoena Duces

In. this, case, Where. the Protective Order is, limited by its terms to only the pretrial stages
of the civil litigation, no confidential business :information appears to be at issue, and counsel. for
the ‘victims of the: suspected. crimes being investigated ‘have indicated a. willingness to ‘voluntarily:
comply with the Subpoena, the “sound discretion of [this] court,” TheStreet.com, 273 F.3d at 231,

to:inquire:into:suspected violations of:the criminal.law; and to effectuate such. investigations it:may.

powers, of the grand jury: are not unlimited and.are subject. to the ‘supervision. of a, judge; the

the protections and restrictions sct forth in. Fed. R. Grim. P. 6(c), and further notes and emphasizes
that the proposed orden accompanying the Application. provides no additional execption or
modification. to the: Protective Order as to the recipient of the subpoena other than the narrow,
limited. ability to comply with grand jury process. The Protective Order will remain otherwise
intact and fully enforecable.
