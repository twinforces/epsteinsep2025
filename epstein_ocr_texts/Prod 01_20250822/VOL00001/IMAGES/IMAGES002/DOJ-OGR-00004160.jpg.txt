IV. The Remedy for the Government’s Misconduct.

A. Pursuant to its Inherent Power, this Court Should Suppress the Evidence
Obtained from Boies Schiller and Dismiss Counts, Five and Six, which are
the Fruits of that Evidence.

This Court-has inherent authority-to regulate the administration. of criminal. justice among
the parties. McNabb v. United. States, 318 U.S. 332, 340 (1943). “Judges have an, obligation. to
exercise supervision over the administration of criminal justice in federal courts, a responsibility:
that ‘implies the duty of establishing and maintaining civilized standards of procedure and
evidence.” Wnited States v. Ming Ile, 94 F.3d 782, 789 (2d Cir. 1.996) (quoting McNabb, 318
US. at 340). As the Supreme Court held in. United States v..Payner, “Federal. courts: may use.
their supervisory: power in, some'circumstances to exclude. evidence taken, from the defendant by
‘willful disobedience of law.” 447 U.S. 727, 735 (1980) (quoting McNabb, 318 U.S. at 345)
(citing Elkins v., United States, 364 U.S..206, 223.(1960);, Rea 'v: United States, 350 U.S. 214,
216-17 (1956); Hampton 'v. United States, 425 U.S.484, 495 (1976) (Powell, J., concurring in,
judgment)). A court'should invoke its supervisory power of'suppréssion when. “there has been.a
fraud upon the ‘court: in addition to a, violation of the defendant’s rights.” United States v.
Cortina; 630. F.2d 1207, 12.16 (7th, Cir, 1980).

In. United States y. Cortina, a magistrate issued a scarch warrant based ‘upon. an affidavit
subscribed. by. FBIAgent:Linda Stewart, which, itself was’ based.on.the reports and investigation
of FBI Agent William Brown. /d. at.1208. Unbeknownst'to Agent Stewart, Agent Brown’s
Second. Circuit in Brown-y., Maxwell held:a few:months after Judge McMahon’s ruling that Maxwell. had,
reasonably’ relied on the Protective Order’s ‘guarantee of confidentiality in substantial:part, and it; therefore
redacted sua sponte. from.the summary judgment material those “deposition responses concerning
‘intimate‘matters where the questions were likely only’ permitted—=and the responses only compelled=:
because of a strong, expectation of continued confidentiality. 929 F.3d 4, 48, n.22 (2d. Cir. 2019) (citing
Fed. R. Giv. P. 5.2). So, t6o,/ has Jud&e Preska redacted Substantial material from, thé décuments she has

released-on.remand from the Second Circuit, again reflecting that,Maxwell reasonably relied on the
‘Protective Order.
