Department had made its “best efforts in thousands of federal and District of Columbia cases to
assert, support, and defend crime victims’ rights.” The response also referenced OLC’s December
2010 opinion concluding that CVRA rights apply when criminal proceedings are initiated, noting
that “the new AG Guidelines go further and provide that Department prosecutors should make
reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about, prospective
plea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a charging instrument with the court.”**

In 2015, Congress amended the CVRA, and added the following two rights:

(9) The right to be informed in a timely manner of any plea bargain
or deferred prosecution agreement.

(10) The right to be informed of the rights under this section and the
services described in section 503(c) of the Victims’ Rights and
Restitution Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 10607(c)) and provided contact
information for the Office of the Victims’ Rights Ombudsman of the
Department of Justice.

G. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status

While the CVRA litigation was pending in the Southern District of Florida, numerous
federal civil suits against Epstein, brought in the same district, were transferred to the same judge
as “related cases,” as a matter of judicial economy pursuant to the Local Rules. As the parties
agreed on settlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed.*** Several of the victims who had
settled their civil cases filed a pleading in the CVRA litigation asking the court to “maintain their
anonymity” and not “further disseminate[]” their identities to the CVRA petitioners.**°

In the CVRA case, the petitioners claimed that the government violated their CVRA rights
to confer by (1) negotiating and signing the NPA without victim input; (2) sending letters to the
victims claiming that the matter was “under investigation” after the NPA was already signed; and
(3) not properly informing the victims that the state plea would also resolve the federal
investigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged that the government violated their CVRA right
to be treated with fairness by concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right
to reasonable notice by concealing that the state court proceeding impacted the enforcement of the
NPA and resolved the federal investigation.

During the litigation, the USAO argued that (1) the victims had no right to notice or
conferral about the NPA because the CVRA rights did not apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s
383 157 Cong. Rec. $7359-02 (2011) (Kyl letter and Department response).
a8e Epstein also resolved some county court civil cases during this time period as well. In addition, numerous
other cases were resolved outside of formal litigation. For example, one attorney told OPR that he resolved 16 victim
cases, but did not file all cases with the court. Court data indicate that the attorney filed only 3 of the 16 cases he said
he resolved.
