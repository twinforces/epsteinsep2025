G. The CVRA Litigation Proceedings and Current Status

While the CVRA. litigation was pending iin the. Southern. District’ of Florida, numerous
ea civil suits against Epstein, brought inthe. same district, were transferred to the same judge
“related cases,” as a matter of judicial. cconomy pursuant ‘to 'the Local Rules. As the partics
aereed ‘on settlements in those civil cases, they were dismissed. 384 Several of the victims who had.
settled their civil cases. filed. a pleading in. the CVRA litigation ‘asking the ‘court to “maintain, their:
anonymity” and. notfurther disseminate[]” their identitics to’ the CVRA petitioners.**

In:the CVRA. case, the petitioners claimed that the 'g government violated their CVRA rights
to. confer’ by: (1) negotiating and. signing the NPA. without: victim, input; (2) sending letters to the:
victims claiming that the mattcr was “under investigation” after the NPA was already: signed; and.
(3). not: properly informing the ‘victims ‘that. the state ‘plea, would also, resolve the federal
investigation. In addition, the petitioners alleged, that, the government. violated, their CVRA right
to'be treated with. fairness by:concealing the NPA ‘negotiation and also violated their CVRA right
to.reasonable: notice by concealing that the state court. proceeding, impacted the enforcement of the
NPA and resolved.the federal investigation.

During the litigation, the USAO argucd, that. (1) the: victims had no, right, to notice or
conferral about'the. NPA because the CVRA rights. did not'apply pre-charge; (2) the government’s

aR Epstein also, resolved some county-court.civil cases, during this time period as well. In-addition, numerous
other ‘cases were:resolved outside of:formal: litigation: For examples -oneattorney told OPR, that, he:resoly ed 16 victim,
cases. but did:notzfile;all cases-with the-court. Court data indicate: thatthe attorney: filed. only 3 3 of the 16 cases;he; said,

‘he: resolved.
