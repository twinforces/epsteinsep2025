Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page /7 of 34

Dkt. No. 142-1 at 2. The NPA makes clear that the covered charges are those relating to
and deriving from a specific investigation of conduct that occurred between 2001 and 2007.

Maxwell contends that the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any limitation on the
offenses covered. The Court disagrees with this improbable interpretation. The phrase
“potential co-conspirator” means nothing without answering the question “co-conspirator in
what?” The most natural reading of the co-conspirator provision is that it covers those who
conspired with Epstein in the offenses covered by the NPA for their involvement in those
offenses. Thus, it would cover any involvement of Maxwell in offenses committed by Epstein
from 2001 to 2007, other offenses that were the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office
investigation, and any offenses that arose from the related grand jury investigation.

The Court has no trouble concluding that the perjury counts are not covered by the NPA.
Those charges do not relate to conduct in which Maxwell conspired with Epstein and stem from
depositions in 2016, more than eight years after Epstein signed the NPA. Maxwell now
concedes as much, though her motion sought to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment in its
entirety, perjury counts and all.

The Mann Act counts, too, fall comfortably outside the NPA’s scope. The S1
superseding indictment charges conduct occurring exclusively between 1994 and 1997, some
four years before the period covered by the Southern District of Florida investigation and the
NPA. The NPA does not purport to immunize Epstein from liability for crimes committed
before the period that was the subject of the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office investigation.
Maxwell’s protection is no broader. The Court thus concludes that the NPA does not cover the
offenses charged in the S1 superseding indictment.
