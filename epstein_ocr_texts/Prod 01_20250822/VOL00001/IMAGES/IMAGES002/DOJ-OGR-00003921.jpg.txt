Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

Pursuant to the Court’s Opinion and Order, dated April 16, 2021 (Dkt. 207), we write to
inform the Court that the defense agrees that Ms. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the $1 superseding
indictment on the grounds that it was returned by a grand jury sitting at the White Plains
courthouse (Dkt. 125) is now moot in light of the fact that a grand jury sitting in Manhattan
returned the S2 superseding indictment.

- — —— Sincerely,

The motion to dismiss the $1 superseding indictment on

the grounds that it was returned by a grand jury sitting at

the White Plains courthouse (Dkt. No. 125) is DENIED /s/ Christian Everdell

as moot. SO ORDERED. Christian R. Everdell
