defendant, which is a non-invasive machine scan, to check for any secreted contraband. MDC
staff also search the defendant’s cell for contraband approximately once per day. Finally, as
discussed in detail in the Government’s May 5, 2021 letter (Dkt. No. 270), MDC staff conduct
wellness checks on the defendant every fifteen minutes at night to confirm that the defendant is
breathing. The MDC continues to be of the view that all of these searches are necessary for the
safety of the institution and the defendant, including for the reasons detailed in the Government’s
May 5, 2021 letter.
