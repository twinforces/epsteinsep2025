Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 385 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page10of12
Indictment. It is hard to imagine how
MEE is “direct evidence" of a conspiracy to transport, entice or traffic minors for sexual
abuse.

As to the witness referenced in the Letter, the Letter makes clear that the witness worked
for Mr. Epstein from ggg, after the conclusion of the charged conspiracy in 2004. Given the
timing of her stated employment, it also begs the question how her testimony, reference to
unspecified documents or scheduling of unspecified massages, "among other things," could be
direct evidence of a conspiracy that ended a year earlier.

But because Ms. Maxwell has had insufficient time to investigate these newly-disclosed
materials, she is unable to file a motion challenging their admissibility at this ime. yy

EES As to the newly disclosed
witness, the Government produced on October 12, 2021 approximately 400 pages of interview
reports, notes, documents, and other materials related to that witness. Ms. Maxwell is unable to
review, investigate, or rebut the admissibility of all of the referenced materials by the October
18, 2021 due date for motions in /imine, and requests an additional two weeks to file her brief
addressing the proffered 404(b) evidence.

CONCLUSION

The Government has been on notice of the amendments to Rule 404(b) since at least
January 25, 2021. See Dkt. 146 at 10.! The Government was prepared to disclose their Rule
' Indeed, the Government argued in their response to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions that certain evidence
pertaining to Accuser-3 would be admissible under Rule 404(b); yet the deadline to provide Notice of an
intent to offer that evidence at trial under the rule has come and gone. See Dkt. 204 at 165-169. Ms.
Maxwell today moves separately to exclude the evidence pertaining to Accuser-3.
