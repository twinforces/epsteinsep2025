Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 254 _ Filed 04/29/21 Page2of2

On Saturday, April 24, 2021, Ms. Maxwell had a scheduled legal visit with her legal counsel.
During legal visits, attorneys may refer to and hand legal documents to their clients, so long as
the documents are returned to the attorneys’ possession at the conclusion of the visit. During
Ms. Maxwell’s legal visit, staff noted that she was in receipt of documents that were handed to
her by the attorneys. Upon completion of the legal visit, the Visiting Room Officer notified the

supervisor that Ms. Maxwell was in receipt of documents that were handed to her by her
attorneys. Pursuant to Institutional Supplement BRO-5267.09A, Inmate Visiting Correctional
Services, the supervisory staff were notified and identified the documents that staff referred to.
Ms. Maxwell was returned to her housing unit and Legal staff were notified.

I informed the supervisor to place the documents in an envelope, date and secure the
envelope. I advised the supervisor to return the envelope to Ms. Maxwell’s attorneys on Sunday,
April 25, 2021, when they returned for another legal visit with Ms. Maxwell, and to tell the
attorneys to place in the envelope and any future documents for Ms. Maxwell in one of the legal
depository boxes in the lobby of the East and West buildings of MDC Brooklyn.

In addition, staff acted appropriate when Ms. Maxwell was escorted to the restroom. Pursuant
to MDC Brooklyn policy, Institutional Supplement BRO-5267.09A, Inmate Visiting Correctional
Services, inmates who use the Visiting Room restroom are escorted by staft and remain under
stafPs constant supervision.

We respectfully request Your Honor deny defense counsel’s proposed order. Please let us
know if the Court requires any additional information, which we will be happy to provide.
Respectfully submitted,
