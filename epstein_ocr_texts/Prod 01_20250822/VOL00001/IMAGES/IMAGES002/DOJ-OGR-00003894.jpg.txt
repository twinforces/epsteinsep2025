cannot be resolved in the government’s favor on this record, and the plain language of the NPA
cannot be disregarded without discovery and an evidentiary hearing.

The government argues that Ms. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing
because she has not submitted affidavits, and that she is not entitled to discovery because she has
offered only “conjecture.” Opp. 22. But unlike the cases the government cites, Ms. Maxwell has
submitted evidence far more powerful than an affidavit claiming an oral agreement: she has
submitted the NPA itself, which, on its face, bars her prosecution. See Feldman, 939 F.3d at
184, 190 (hearing based on oral representations made to defendant); United States v. Aleman,
286 F.3d 86, 91 (2d Cir. 2002) (granting hearing where defendant submitted attorney affidavits
alleging oral agreement); United States v. Sattar, 272 F. Supp. 2d 348, 383 (S.D.N.Y. 2003)
(same). Ms. Maxwell’s contention that the plain language of the NPA reflects the parties’ intent
is not “conjecture,” and the Court cannot find to the contrary without hearing evidence—
evidence that we anticipate would confirm that the parties intended the NPA to mean exactly
what it says and that it bars the prosecution of Ms. Maxwell, but is unavailable to Ms. Maxwell
without discovery.'°
"Tn addition, unlike the defendants in the cases the government cites, Ms. Maxwell was a nonparty to the NPA, and
her attorneys thus have neither firsthand knowledge of the parties’ intent nor access to evidence regarding the
parties’ intent. While the government points out that Ms. Maxwell has not submitted an affidavit from Epstein’s
counsel, defense counsel notes that it has made several unsuccessful attempts to obtain information from Jay
Lefkowitz, the attorney who was principally involved in negotiating the language of the NPA on Epstein’s behalf.
