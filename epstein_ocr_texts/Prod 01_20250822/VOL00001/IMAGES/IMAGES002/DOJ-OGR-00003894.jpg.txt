‘cannot. be resolved. in the government’s favor on. this record, and the plain language ‘of the NPA:
cannot, be disregarded without discovery and an evidentiary hearing.

The government argues that-Ms. Maxwell is not entitled to.an evidentiary hearing
because she has not submitted affidavits, and-that-she is not:entitled to discovery because she has
offered only “conjecture.” Opp. 22. But unlike the cases the governnient cites, Ms. Maxwell has
submitted. evidence far more powerful than.an affidavit claiming an.oral. agreement: she’has
submitted:the NPA itself, which, on its face, bars her prosecution. See Feldman, 939 F.3d at
184, 190 (hearing baséd on. oral represéntations madé'to defendant); United States.¥. Aleman,
286 F.3d 86, 91. (2d Cir, 2002):(granting hearing where defendant submitted attorney’ affidavits
alleging oral agreement); United States vy. Sattar; 272. F. Supp. 2d'348, 383 (S.D.N-Y..2003):
