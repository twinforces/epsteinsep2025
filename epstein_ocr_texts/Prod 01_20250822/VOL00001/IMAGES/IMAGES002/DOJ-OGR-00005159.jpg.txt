Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 336-4 Filed 09/07/21 Page 4 of 22
AO 89B (07/16) Subpoena to Produce Documents, Information, or Objects in a Criminal Case (Page 3)
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 17 (c), (d), (e), and (g) (Effective 12/1/08)
(c) Producing Documents and Objects.
(1) In General. A subpoena may order the witness to produce any books, papers, documents, data, or other objects the subpoena
designates. The court may direct the witness to produce the designated items in court before trial or before they are to be offered in
evidence. When the items arrive, the court may permit the parties and their attorneys to inspect all or part of them.
(2) Quashing or Modifying the Subpoena. On motion made promptly, the court may quash or modify the subpoena if compliance
would be unreasonable or oppressive.
(3) Subpoena for Personal or Confidential Information About a Victim. After a complaint, indictment, or information is filed, a
subpoena requiring the production of personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court
order. Before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that
the victim can move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object.
(d) Service. A marshal, a deputy marshal, or any nonparty who is at least 18 years old may serve a subpoena. The server must deliver a copy
of the subpoena to the witness and must tender to the witness one day’s witness-attendance fee and the legal mileage allowance. The server
need not tender the attendance fee or mileage allowance when the United States, a federal officer, or a federal agency has requested the
subpoena.
(e) Place of Service.
(1) In the United States. A subpoena requiring a witness to attend a hearing or trial may be served at any place within the United
States.
(2) Ina Foreign Country. If the witness is in a foreign country, 28 U.S.C. § 1783 governs the subpoena's service.
(g) Contempt. The court (other than a magistrate judge) may hold in contempt a witness who, without adequate excuse, disobeys a subpoena
issued by a federal court in that district. A magistrate judge may hold in contempt a witness who, without adequate excuse, disobeys a
subpoena issued by that magistrate judge as provided in 28 U.S.C. § 636(e).
