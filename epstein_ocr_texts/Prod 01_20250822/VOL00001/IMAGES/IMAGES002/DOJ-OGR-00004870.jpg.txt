rather than on contract law principles. Government of Virgin Islands v. Scotland, 614
F.2d 360 (3d Cir. 1980), is instructive. In that case, the parties had reached a tentative,
preliminary plea agreement. But before the defendant could formally enter the plea, the
prosecutor attempted to add another term to the deal. /d. at 361-62. The defendant
rejected the new term and sought specific performance of the original, unconsummated
agreement. /d. The district court denied his request. The Circuit Court of Appeals
affirmed, holding that, because the agreement was not formalized and accepted by the
court, the defendant was not entitled to specific performance under a contract law theory.
Id. at 362. The appellate court noted that, absent detrimental reliance upon the
prosecutor's offer, a defendant’s due process rights were sufficiently safeguarded by his
right to a jury trial. /d. at 365. The court cautioned, however, that, by contrast, when a
“defendant detrimentally relies on the government’s promise, the resulting harm from this
induced reliance implicates due process guarantees.” /d.24

Considered together, these authorities obligate courts to hold prosecutors to their
word, to enforce promises, to ensure that defendants’ decisions are made with a full
understanding of the circumstances, and to prevent fraudulent inducements of waivers of
one or more constitutional rights. Prosecutors can be bound by their assurances or
decisions under principles of contract law or by application of the fundamental fairness
considerations that inform and undergird the due process of law. The law is clear that,
based upon their unique role in the criminal justice system, prosecutors generally are
bound by their assurances, particularly when defendants rely to their detriment upon
those guarantees.

22 Ultimately, the court did not grant the defendant relief under a theory of detrimental
reliance because there was “no claim in this case of such reliance.” Scotland, 614 F.2d
at 365.
