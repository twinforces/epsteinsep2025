letters to victims sent after the NPA was signed were not misleading in, stating-that:the matter was
“under investigation” because the government, continued to investigate given, its uncertainty that:
Epstein'would:plead guilty; and (3) Villafafia,contacted the petitioners’ attorncy-prior'to Epstcin’s
State ‘plea. to advisé him of the hearing. ‘Nonetheless, Villafafia told OPR ‘that, While there were
valid ‘reasons: for the g government’s position that CVRA rights do not.apply: pre-charge, “[T]his. is:
a.casc where | felt we should have done: more than ‘what ‘was Icgally: required. Iwas obviously:

preparcd.to:spend.as much time, energy and cffort necessary:to mect:with, cach and:every [victim]:

Over ‘the, course of the litigation, the district court made various rulings interpreting the
provisions of the CVRA, including the court’s key: conclusion. that victim CVRA. rights “attach.
before the Government: ‘brings: formal. charges against a defendant.” The court also held that:
(1). “the CVRA authorizes the rescission or ‘reopening’ of a prosecutorial agreement, including a.
non-prosccution agreement, reached in violation of a‘prosecutor’s, conferral obligations under the
statute’: (2) the CVRA authorizes the setting aside of pre-charge prosecutorial agreements”;
(3) the CVRA’s “reasonable: right to confer” “extends to the pre-charge ‘state of criminal
investigations and proceedings”; (4) the: alleged, federal. sex crimes committed by Epstein. render
the Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and. (5), “questions pertaining to [the] cquitable
defense[s] are’properly ‘left for resolution. after development of: a, full evidentiaryrecord.”

On February .21,,.2019, the district court granted. the petitioners’ Motion. for. Partial.
Summary Judgment, ruling that “once:the Government failed. to advise the victims about its
‘intention to enter into the NPA, a violation of the CVRA. occurred.” The government did not.
dispute the fact: that: it did, not: confer with the petitioners. prior to signing ‘the NPA, andthe court.
concluded. that, ““[a]t.a bare minimum, the CVRA ‘required, the Government 'to inform Petitioners
that it intended'to enter into.an agreement not'to:prosecute Epstein.” The.court found that the post-
NPA Ictters the g government sent to victims, describing the Investigation as ongoing “misled the:
omission, for ‘the Government to suggest. to the victims ‘that they have patience ‘relative to an
investigation about-which it-had already bound itself not to prosecute.”2*°

The ‘court relied. on Dean. and..BP Products to support its holding and. noted that the
government’s action with respect to the NPA was especially troubling because, unlike a ‘plea.
agreement. for which the victims could voice objection, at.a sentencing hearing, “[o]nccan NPA is
entcred ‘into: without: notice, the matter is closed and the victims, have no opportunity’ to, be heard.
regarding any aspect. of the case.” The court.also highlighted. the inequity of the USAO?s failure
to: communicate with the victims whilc:it.simultancously: engaged in “lengthy negotiations” with.
Epstein’s counsel. and. assured the: defense that: the NPA would. not be “made public or filed with.
the Court.”

Although the USAO: defended, its actions by citing the 2005 Guidelines for the:
Department’ $ position ‘that. CVRA rights do not.attach until after a defendant.is charged, the court.
was “not! persuaded that the © [Guidelines were the basis for the Government’ S decision to withhold.

86 The court did not:resolve the factual, question. as to whether. the victims: were given adequate notice. of.

Epstein’s state court plea hearing.
