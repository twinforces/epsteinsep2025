1 The criminal investigation. Any materials that the

2 plaintiff has with respect to any criminal investigations will
3 be turned over except for any statements made by the plaintiff
4 to law enforcement authority and those statements, if there are
5 such, will be submitted in camera, and I will review them.

6 I hope that clears up our problems. Tell me if I have
7 failed in my effort to do so. Yes, ma'am.

8 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, two quick things, I think.
9 With respect to medical records, we also certainly believe that
10 the period from the time the statement was made in January 2015
Le until the present, because she has claimed emotional distress
12 from that defamation --
13 THE COURT: Sure, yes.
14 MS. MENNINGER: The problem is, we have asked through
LS interrogatory what were the names of the medical providers

16 because they have not disclosed who her medical providers were.
cy So there is no way for us to tell whether the records in fact
18 have been sought from and produced with respect to each of

a We. those medical providers. I will say that other records in the
20 possession of plaintiff lists other doctors who they have not
21. asked for records from or releases.
22 THE COURT: Let's see if we can clear that up.
23 MS. McCAWLEY: We have disclosed the names. She has
24 those names. We have also disclosed records, the more recent
25 records. We have not contested that.
