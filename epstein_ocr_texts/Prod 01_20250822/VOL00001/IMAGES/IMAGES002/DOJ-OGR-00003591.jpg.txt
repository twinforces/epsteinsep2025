2 agree to that?
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Objection to the
4 form and foundation.
5 Q. Are they under the age of 18?
6 A. We already established that you can
7 be a masseuse in Florida at age 17. That
8 does not make it inappropriate.
oD A. I'm not saying appropriate or
10 inappropriate. I'm just asking if there were
11 any exercise instructors that were under the
12 age of 18.
13 A. I am not aware if anybody was but I
14 don't want to full out and say you oh she
15 said, we already established you can be a 17
16 year old masseuse and have it not be
17 something that is not appropriate. So when
18 you say that and then you go, well, you come
19 back and say something, now we can establish
pols that Virginia was 17 but you can be a 17 year
cal old legal masseuse, but I am not aware to
Ze your point.
23 O Who were the other 17 year old
24 masseuses that you were aware of?
25 A. T am not aware of any.
