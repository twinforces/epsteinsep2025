activity” with Epstein. That, in turn, may cause the jury to improperly convict Ms. Maxwell
based on a false assumption.

Finally, the Court should give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction to ensure that
the jury understands that the alleged conduct was not unlawful and does not consider it as
improper propensity evidence. If Accuser-3 is allowed to testify that she engaged in sex acts
with Epstein in London when she was 17, as the government has proffered, the jury will almost
certainly assume that the alleged conduct was unlawful, as it would be in certain U.S. states, and
that the testimony is being offered to prove that Epstein and Accuser-3 engaged in “illegal sexual
activity” in London. Accordingly, if Accuser-3 is allowed to testify, we request that the Court
give the jury a limiting instruction containing the following points:

e The legal age of consent for sexual activity in the United Kingdom
is 16 years old. That was also the legal age of consent from 1994-
1995, when Accuser-3 alleges she engaged in sex acts with Jeffrey
Epstein in London when she was 17 years old.

e The alleged conduct that Accuser-3 has described in her testimony
was therefore not illegal. If you find that these incidents took place,
I instruct you that this sexual activity cannot be considered “illegal”
or “criminal” or “unlawful” for purposes of the crimes charged in
the indictment.

If the Court determines that Accuser-3’s testimony may be admitted as 404(b) evidence,
Ms. Maxwell further requests that the Court also give the jury an appropriate propensity
instruction. See Dolney, 2005 WL 2129169, at *2 (“In the absence of such a limiting instruction,
there exists a legitimate concern that the jury might misapply [the] evidence to conclude that if
the defendants engaged in criminal conduct prior to the charged conspiracy, then the conduct at
issue in these charges must also be criminal.”).
