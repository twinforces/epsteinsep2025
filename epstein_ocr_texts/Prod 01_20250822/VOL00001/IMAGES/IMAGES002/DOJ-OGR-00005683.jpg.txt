activity” with Epstein. ‘That, in turn, may cause the jury to improperly convict. Ms. Maxwell
based on a false assumption.

Finally, the Court should give the:jury an. appropriate: limiting instruction.to cnsure:that.
the jury understands that the: alleged conduct; was not-unlawful and. docs. not consider it as
improper propensity evidence. If Accuscr-3 is allowed to testify that she engaged in sex. acts
with Epstcin in London;when, she'was' 1,7, as the government has proffered, the jury will almost
certainly assume that. the alleged conduct; was unlawful, as it would be. in certain U.S. states, and
that the testimony is being offered to prove that.Epstein and Accuscr-3 engaged in “illegal sexual
activity” in London. Accordingly, if, Accuser-3 is allowed to testify, we request that. the: Court.
give the jury. a limiting instruction containing the following points:

0 The legal. age of consent for sexual, activity in. the United, Kingdom
is 16'yéars old. That. was also the legal age of consent’ from.'1994-
1995, when, Accuser-3 alleges she engaged. in sex acts with Jeffrey
Epstein in-London.when.she was 17 years old.

e The alleged conduct that Accuscr-3:has described in her testimony:
‘was therefore not illegal. Ifyou find that these incidents took place,
l instruct:you that this sexual activity. cannot. be considered “illegal”
or “criminal” or “unlawful” ‘for purposes of the crimes charged in’
‘the indictment.

Ifthe Court determines that.Accuser-3’s testimony may be admitted as 404(b) evidence,
Ms. Maxwell further requests that'the Court also give'the jury.an, appropriate. propensity
instruction. ‘See Doliey, 2005 WL 2129169, at.*2 (“In the absence of such a. limiting instruction,
there ‘exists a ‘legitimate concern that the jury might misapply [the] evidence to conclude that if
the defendants engaged:in criminal conduct:prior to the charged conspiracy, then the conduct at

issuc in these charges. must.also be:criminal.”).
