conspirator statements when. they are not: produced. until after the dm /imine. deadline. has
passed.

District judges in this Circuit routinely order the government to disclose the identities
of alleged co-conspirators in advance of trial. to offset the "risk of surprise to: the defendant,”
especially if "there are a large: number of co-conspirators. and.'a. long-running conspiracy.”
Séé, é.g., United States v. Akhavan, $3 20-cr-188. (JSR), 2020 WL.2555333 at *2 (S.D.N-Y.
May 24, 2020).° In Akhavan, invelving only: a. three-year conspiracy, Judge: Rakoff
determined the “complex scrics of events over a number of years" warranted a bill. of
particulars disclosing the names of the: alleged co-conspirators. See also United States -v.
Barnes, 158 F.3d.662, 666 (2d Cir. 1998). Unlike Akhavan, here the government has made
no showing: that disclosure of the namés of unindicted co-conspirators would jeopardize its
ongoing ‘investigation. into events that-happened a quarter of a century ago.

The defense anticipates interposing ‘significant objections to introduction of any
‘purported co-conspirator statements. (whether through. witness testimony or documentary

of any unindicted co- conspirator); United. States v. Bin Laden, 92 F. Supp. 24.225, 241 (S.D-N.Y.

2¢ S:. Embassies in E. Afi, 552 F.3d.93 (2d Cir.

2008) (“conspiracies ‘alleged ‘here v were “quite ‘long-running (nearly ten years, and allegedly:
ongoing) and ‘involved a, large: number of co-conspirators (at: lcast. 20 individuals)....We are
sympathetic, therefore, with. the magnitude of defense counsel's burden in trying to decipher the
identities. of ‘alleged co-conspirators. A bill of:particulars revealing the names: of all persons whom.
the Government will claim at trial were-unindicted co-conspirators might, therefore, be: necessary:
to’prevent prejudicial surprise at,trial.").
