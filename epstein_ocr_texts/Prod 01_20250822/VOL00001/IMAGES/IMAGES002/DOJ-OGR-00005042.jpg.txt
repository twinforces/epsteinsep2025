Government from restricting its proof at trial.’ Dkt. No. 320 at 3. The Government provides no
explanation for this purported harm and none is apparent to the Court. Thus, the Court finds that
this concern alone does not outweigh the risk of surprise to the Defendant in this case or the need
for the parties to litigate co-conspirator issues in advance of trial to ensure the absence of delay.
In light of the interests discussed above and consistent with other courts that have required
disclosure of co-conspirator identities to the defense, the Court will require the Government to
disclose the identities of any unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the
conspiracies charged in the S2 indictment whom the Government intends to refer to at trial.

Accordingly, the Court ORDERS that at the same time that the Government discloses
Jencks Act material, the Government shall also disclose to the defense the identities of any
unnamed co-conspirators who allegedly participated in the conspiracies charged in the S2
indictment to whom the Government will refer at trial. The Government is FURTHER
ORDERED to disclose a// co-conspirator statements it intends to offer at trial no later than
October 11, as consistent with this Court’s scheduling order. Dkt. No. 297 at 1.

SO ORDERED.
