opposition to these meetings, but we are simply looking at this case
as a violent crime prosecution involving stiff penalties rather than as
a white collar or public corruption case where the parties can
amicably work out a light sentence.”

With respect to the “policy reasons” that Lefcourt wants to discuss,
those were already raised in his letter (which is part of the indictment
package) and during his meeting with Andy and myself. Those
reasons are: (1) he wants the Petit [sic] policy to trump our ability
to prosecute Epstein, (2) this shouldn’t be a federal offense, and
(3) the victims were willing participants so the crime shouldn’t be
prosecuted at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those
arguments will be persuasive, a meeting will not be beneficial to the
prosecution, it will only benefit the defense. With respect to
Lefcourt’s promised legal analysis, that also has already been
provided. The only way to get additional analysis is to expose to the
defense the other charges that we are considering. In my opinion
this would seriously undermine the prosecution.

The defense is anxious to have a meeting in order to delay the
investigation/prosecution, to find out more about our investigation,
and to use political pressure to stop the investigation.

I have no control over the Office’s decisions regarding whether to
meet with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case
will be disclosed. However, if you all do decide to go forward with
these meetings in a way that is detrimental to the investigation, then
I will have to ask to have the case reassigned to an AUSA who is in
agreement with the handling of the case.

After receiving this draft, the immediate supervisor cautioned Villafafia, “Let’s talk before
this is sent, please.”°° Villafafia told OPR that the supervisor counseled Villafafia not to send the
email to Sloman or Menchel because Villafafia could be viewed as insubordinate. She also told
Villafafia that if Villafafia did not stay with the case, “the case would go away” and Epstein “would
never serve a day in jail.”

Villafafia told OPR that at that point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file
charges against Epstein despite agreeing to accommodate the defense request for meetings. She
also told OPR, on the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going down the same path that
the State Attorney’s Office had gone down.” Villafafia believed the purpose of the defense request
a In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Menchel’s counsel noted Menchel’s view that the nature of a
defendant’s crimes and potential penalty does not affect whether prosecutors are willing to meet with defense counsel
to discuss the merits of a case.

50 The immediate supervisor recalled telling Villafafia that she and Villafafia were “not driving the ship,” and
once “the bosses” made the decision, “there’s nothing else you can do.”
