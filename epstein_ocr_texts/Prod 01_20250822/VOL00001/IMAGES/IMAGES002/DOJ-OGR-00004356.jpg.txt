opposition to these:meetings, but we:are simply looking at this: case
as‘a;,violent crime ‘prosecution involving stiff penaltics rather than.as.
a ‘white collar or ‘public corruption case ‘where the partics can
amicably work’ out a light sentence.”

With respect to the “policy: reasons” that Lefcourt wants to: discuss,
those were:already raised.in,his letter (which.is;part of the indictment
‘package) and. during’ his meeting ‘with Andy’ and myself. Those
reasons are? (1) he wants’ the Petit’ [sic] ‘policy to trump ‘our ability
‘to. prosccute: Epstein, (2) this: shouldn’t be a federal offense, and
(3) the victims ‘were ‘willing participants so: the crime: shouldn’t ‘be
‘prosecuted at all. Unless the Office thinks that any of those
arguments will be:persuasive, a mecting will not-be beneficial. to the
‘prosecution, it will only benefit the défense. With ‘respect. ‘to
Lefcourt’s promised Icgal. analysis, that also has already been
provided. The: only way to get. additional analysis is to expose to the
defense the other charges that we are-considering. In my opinion
‘this would. seriously’undermine the prosecution.

The defense. is: anxious to have a mecting ‘in order to delay the
investigation/prosccution, to find. out more about our investigation,
and to. use:political:pressure to stop the investigation.

| have ‘tio control over the Office’s decisions régarding whether to,
mect-with the defense or to whom the facts and analysis of the case
‘will be disclosed. However, if you.all do decide to'go forward with
these meetings in,.a’way ‘that.is detrimental to the: investigation, then
I will-have to'ask to have the case reassigned to an AUSA. who is in
agreement ‘with the handling of the case.

After recciving this draft, the immediate:supervisor cautioned. Villafafia, “Lct’s talk before
this'is sent, please.”*” ‘Villafafia told, OPR that, the supervisor counseled Villafafia not to:send the
email, to Sloman, or: Menchel ‘because Villafafia could, be viewed as insubordinate. She also told.
Villafana thatif Villafafia did-not stay with the case, “the case would.go away” and. Epstein “would,
never sérvée.a day’in jail.”

Villafafia, told OPR. that, at that. point in time, she believed the USAO was preparing to file
charges against. Epstein despite agrecing to accommodate ‘the defense request. for mectings. She:
also told'OPR, on. the other hand, that she feared the USAO was “going down the same path that.
the State Attorney’s Office had gone down.” Villafafia belicved the purpose of the defense request

9, In, commenting on, OPR*s draft) report, Menchel*s counsel, noted Menchel’s view that: the ‘nature of a;
defendant’s crimes and potential penalty:does not affectiwhether prosecutors,are willing to meet-with defense counsel,
‘to discuss the-merits ofa case.

%0 The:immediate supervisor reealled telling Villafafiathat she and, Villafafia were: “not driving the ship,” and,
onee“the bosses*:made the decision, “there’s: nothing else you.can do?”
