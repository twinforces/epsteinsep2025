same tribunal. See Erick G. Luna, Avoiding A “Carnival Atmosphere”: Trial Court Discretion
and the Advocate—Witness Rule, 18 Whittier L.Rev. 447, 451 (1997). Among the multitude of
rationales for the rule, rarely, if ever, will a lawyer be able to effectively serve as an advocate
and give testimony:

A lawyer who intermingles the functions of advocate and witness diminishes his

effectiveness in both roles. The client's case is subject to the criticism that it is

being presented through the testimony of an obviously interested witness who on

that account is subject to impeachment, and, of equal importance, the lawyer is

placed in the unseemly position of arguing his own credibility to the jury.
Williams v. Dist. Ct., El Paso Cty., 700 P.2d 549, 553 (Colo. 1985).°

Counsel for Ms. Maxwell (“Colorado Counsel”) have direct, relevant, testimony
applicable to the facts and circumstances surrounding the allegations in Counts Five and Six, the
questions, the objections, and the lack of materiality of these questions. Testimony from
Colorado Counsel would likely include their knowledge about the many false statements made
by Giuffre and the actions of her lawyers including discovery abuses. But operating in a dual
capacity, lawyer and witness, would create confusion, subject Ms. Maxwell’s lawyers to cross-
examination, and potentially constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Moreover, courts in this
Circuit do not allow attorneys to function in this dual role, even if the defendant is willing. See
United States v. Cunningham, 672 F.2d 1064, 1074 (2d Cir. 1982) (disqualification of trial
counsel “required” as a result of “their participation in the events underlying” one of the
charges); United States v. Gotti, 771 F. Supp. 552, 565 (E.D.N.Y. 1991) (disqualifying trial
counsel and noting that “[i]t is difficult to comprehend how |the lawyers] could present a defense
against this charge without becoming unsworn witnesses”). Here, the government suggests that

®° Drafters of the ABA Model Rules recommend similar rationales for the rule; but the drafters
also mention the opposing party's interest, noting that combining the roles of advocate and witness can
prejudice the opposing party as well as involve a conflict of interest between the lawyer and client. See
Annotated Model Rules of Prof'l Conduct, R. 3.7 cmt. 1.
