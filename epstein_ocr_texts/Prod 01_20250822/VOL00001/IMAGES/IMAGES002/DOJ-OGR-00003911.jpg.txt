and thé Advocalé. Witness Rilé, 18 Whittier L.Rev. 447, 451 (1997). Among the multitude of
rationales for the rule, rarcly, if ever, will.a.lawyer beiable'to effectively sérve as an advocate
and give testimony:
A lawyer who intermingles the functions of advocate and. witness diminishes his
effectiveness in both roles. The client's. case :is subject to the criticism that it is
being presented. through the testimony of an, obviously-interested:witness who on:
that account is, subject to: impeachment, and, of equal importance, the lawyer. is
placed in the unseemly position of arguing his-own credibility to the jury.
Williams. v.. Dist. Ct, £1 Paso-Cty., 700-P.2d 549, 553.(Colo. 1985).6
Counsel for Ms. Maxwell. (“Colorado Counsel”) have direct, relevant, testimony:
applicable to. the facts and circumstances surrounding the allegations.in Cotints Five and Six, the
questions, the objections,-and the lack. of materiality of these questions. Testimony from
Colorado Counsel would likely include their knowledge about:the many false statements made:
by.Giufifre and the actions of her lawyers including discovery abuses. But operating in a dual
capacity, lawyer dnd witness, would create confusion, subject Ms: Maxwell’s.lawyers to cross-
‘examination, and potentially constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Morcover, courts in this
Circuit do not allow. attorneys to function in. this dual:role, even if the defendant is willing. See
United States v.. Cunningham, 672.F.2d 1064, 1074 (2d Cir. 1982) (disqualification of trial

® Drafters.of'the ABA.Model Rules:recommend similar rationales for the:rule; but the drafters:
also menition the: ‘Opposing party's interest, noting that combining the:roles of. advocate and Witiiess cant
