Schiller Flexner LLP.

As noted:in the Government’s, Ictter, the Government: has. produced. to'the defense copics
of the photographs sought’ in Request 1.1. (Dkt. No. 269 at 8). The. Government has now’
determined that, for a subset. of the photographs requested by the defendant, the Government:
previously. provided the defense with scanned. images of this ‘subset of photographs from. the FBI
Florida file. The original photographs are currently in the FBI’s possession. Accordingly, because
some of the original photographs are currently ‘in, the Prosecution Tcam’s ‘possession, the
Government will. niake them available: to'the defendant for inspection upon request. Request. 1]

is therefore moot.as to'those photographs.
