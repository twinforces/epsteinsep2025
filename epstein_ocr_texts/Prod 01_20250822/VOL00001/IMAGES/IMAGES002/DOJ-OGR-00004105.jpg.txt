Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter to supplement its letter of May 4, 2021
(Dkt. No. 269) regarding Requests 9 through 11 of the defendant’s requested subpoena to Boies
Schiller Flexner LLP.

As noted in the Government’s letter, the Government has produced to the defense copies
of the photographs sought in Request 11. (Dkt. No. 269 at 8). The Government has now
determined that, for a subset of the photographs requested by the defendant, the Government
previously provided the defense with scanned images of this subset of photographs from the FBI
Florida file. The original photographs are currently in the FBI’s possession. Accordingly, because
some of the original photographs are currently in the Prosecution Team’s possession, the
Government will make them available to the defendant for inspection upon request. Request 11
is therefore moot as to those photographs.
