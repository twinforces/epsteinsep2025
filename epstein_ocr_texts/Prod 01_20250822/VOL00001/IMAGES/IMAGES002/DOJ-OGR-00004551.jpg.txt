prosecutors and did not recall learning any information about Epstein’s guilty plea until after the
plea was entered on June 30, 2008.

When asked whether she was concerned that her statements would mislead the victims,
Villafafia told OPR:

From my perspective we were conducting an investigation and it

was an investigation that was going to lead to an indictment. You

know, I was interviewing witnesses, I was issuing [legal

process],... I was doing all [these] things to take the case to a

federal indictment and a federal trial. So to me, saying to a victim

the case is now back under investigation is perfectly accurate.

4. February — March 2008: Villafaiia Takes Additional Steps to Prepare
for a Prosecution of Epstein, Arranges for Pro Bono Attorneys for
Victims, and Cautions about Continued Delay

In February 2008, Villafafia revised the prosecution memorandum and supplemental
memorandum. Villafafia removed some victims known to Epstein from the PBPD investigation
and others subject to impeachment as a result of civil suits they filed against Epstein, added newly
discovered victims, and made changes to the proposed indictment.

While the defense appealed the USAO’s decision to prosecute Epstein to higher levels of
the Department, Villafafia sought help for victims whom defense investigators were harassing and
attempting to subpoena for depositions as part of Epstein’s defense in civil lawsuits that some
victims had brought against him, as well as purportedly in connection with the state criminal case.
Villafafia reported to her supervisors that she was able to locate a “national crime victims service
organization” to provide attorneys for the victims, and the FBI Victim Specialist contacted some
victims to provide contact information for the attorneys.*4! During this period, an attorney from
the victims service organization was able to help Courtney Wild avoid an improper deposition.
Villafafia also informed her supervisors, including Sloman, that “one of the victims tried to commit
suicide last week,” and advocated aggressively for a resolution to the case: “I just can’t stress
enough how important it is for these girls to have a resolution in this case. The ‘please be patient’
answer is really wearing thin, especially when Epstein’s group is still on the attack while we are
forced to wait on the sidelines.”

3. March — April 2008: Villafaiia Continues to Prepare for Filing Federal
Charges

Villafafia continued to revise the proposed charges by adding new victims and by removing
others who had filed civil suits against Epstein. Villafafia also prepared search warrants for digital

of the pro bono counsel and explained that her “job as a Victim Specialist is to ensure that victims[] of a Federal crime
are afforded their rights, information and resource referral.”
