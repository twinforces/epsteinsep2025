Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 307 Filed 06/25/21 Page 6of21

A. The Government did not violate Maxwell’s right against self-incrimination

The Fifth Amendment.provideés that.“[n]o person... . shall be: compelled ‘in any criminal
case to be a witness against himsclf.” U.S. Const. amend. 'V. “The [Supreme] Court has-held.
repeatedly that the Fifth,Amendment is limited to’prohibiting the use of “physical or moral
compulsion’ exerted on. the person asserting the privilege.” /isher v. United States, 425, US.
391, 397 (1976) (quoting Perlman.y. United States, 247 U.S. 7, 15'((1918)). ‘It docs not prohibit
‘the:Government from using a defendant’s voluntary’ statements in a subsequent. criminal
prosccution.

To establish a violation of the right against. compelled sclf-incrimination, Maxwell, must,
“demonstrate the existence of three elements: 1.) compulsion, 2) a'téestimonial communication,
and.3) the incriminating nature of that. communication.” Jn-re: Grand Jury Subpoena, 826 F.2d
1166, 1.168 (2d Cir. (1987). Maxwell contends:that;the Government; violated her right against.
compelled self-incrimination by obtaining copies, of her deposition.transcripts from herearlicr
civil case. She acknowledges that she could.have, but did. not, invoke her Fifth, Amendment
rights to avoid providing incriminating testimony... See;. e.g, Pillsbury Co. v.-Gonboy, 459 U.S.
248, 263-24 & n.24.(1983). However, she contends that she testified only because she believed
the protective order in that case would.prevent the Government from obtaining her testimony and
using itin a subsequent, criminal. case against. her.

Second Circuit. precedent expressly forecloses. Maxwell’s argument. “A ‘Rule:26(c)
protective order, no matter how’ broad its reach, ‘provides no guarantee ‘that compelled testimony
will:not somchow find its'way into the government’s hands for Use. ina subsequent eriminal
prosceution.” Andover Data Servs: v. Stat: Labulating Corp:, 876 F.2d.1080, 1083. (2d Cir.

1989). As the Second Circuit has explained, a. civil ‘protective order may (as here) be overturned
