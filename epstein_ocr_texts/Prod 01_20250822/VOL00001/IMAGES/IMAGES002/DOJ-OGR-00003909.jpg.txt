e The Giifjre v: Maxwell litigation specifically, including:
e ‘The circlimstances surrounding the deposition.
e ‘The nature and character of the Giuffre’s lawyers including ‘their unethical
behavior.
e The. discovery abuses by Giuffre’s lawyers.
0 ‘Why, in the context of this, defamation case, the questions being posed, now. the
‘subject of the Perjury Counts,were not material including:
