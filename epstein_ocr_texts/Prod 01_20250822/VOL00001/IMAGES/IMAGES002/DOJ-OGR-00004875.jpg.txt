attempts. to explain or characterize his actions are largely immaterial. The answer to our

Castor’s patent intent to. induce Cosby’s reliance upon the non-prosecution decision.

In January and February of 2005, then-D.A. Castor led an investigation into
Constand’s allegations. When that investigation concluded, Mr. Castor decided that ‘the
case was saddled with deficiencies. such that proving Cosby’s guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt ‘was unlikely, if not impossible. For those reasons, D.A. Castor decided not to
prosecute Cosby.. To announce his decision, the district attorney elected to issue a signed
press rélease—an uncommon tactic in the ‘typical case, but not necessarily’ so in cases
of high public: profile or interest.

In that press statement, D.A. Castor explained the extent and nature of the
investigation and the legal rules and principles that he considered. He then announced
that he was declining to prosecute Cosby. The decision was hot conditioned in any way,
shape; orform. D.A. Castor.did not:say that he would re-evaluate this decision at a future
date, that the investigation would continue, or that his decision was: subject to being
overturned by any future district attorney.

There is nothing from a reasonable observer's perspective to suggest that the
decision was anything but permanent. The trial court found contrary indicia in the latter
portion of the press release, where Mr. Castor “cautioned all parties to this matter that
[District Attorney Castor] will reconsider this decision should the need arise,” Press

Release, 2/17/2005; N.T.. 2/2/2016, Exh. D-4. The trial court’s narrow interpretation of

induce a defendant to forfeit.a constitutional right, and where the defendant has relied
‘upon that decision to his detriment. The dissent’s approach would turn a blind eye to the
reality of such inducements. Due process does not.
