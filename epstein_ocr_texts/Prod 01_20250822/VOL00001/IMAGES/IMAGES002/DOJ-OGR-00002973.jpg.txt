OPR that “he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and ‘had no involvement with it.’
OPR Report at 64 n. 105.’

Beyond this, the OPR Report and the record in the civil case note contacts with Main
Justice about the NPA, but only after the NPA was negotiated, drafted, and signed. In the civil
case, the district court detailed the history of the plea negotiations—and noted that, after the NPA
was signed, Epstein’s counsel appealed to officials in Washington, D.C., hoping to avoid
enforcement of the NPA’s requirement that Epstein plead guilty to state offenses, as the agreement
required. Doe J v. United States, 359 F. Supp. 3d 1201, 1212-13 (S.D. Fla. 2019). As the district
court noted, that appeal was rejected. /d. at 1213.

In particular, and following the execution of the NPA, the report reflects that the USAO-
SDFL contacted the CEOS Chief in connection with a letter from Epstein’s counsel, Kenneth Starr,
protesting about complying with certain parts of the NPA. OPR Report at 95. According to the
report:

At the same time, at [USAO-SDFL supervisor] Lourie’s request,
Villafafia sent the NPA and its addendum to Lourie and Oosterbaan.
Oosterbaan responded to Lourie that he was “not thrilled” about the
NPA; described Epstein’s conduct as unusually “egregious,”
particularly because of its serial nature; and observed that the NPA
was “pretty advantageous for the defendant and not all that helpful
to the victims.” He opined, however, that the Assistant Attorney
General would not and should not consider or address the NPA
“other than to say that she agrees with it.’ During her OPR
interview, [Assistant Attorney General] Fisher did not recall reading
Starr’s letter or discussing it with Oosterbaan, but believed the
comment about her “agree[ing] with it” referred to a federal
prosecution of Epstein, which she believed was appropriate. She
told OPR, however, that she “played no role in” the NPA and did
not review or approve the agreement either before or after it was
signed.
7 The OPR Report further reflects that, at the time, a supervisor at the USAO-SDFL noted the
CEOS had “no approval authority.” OPR Report at 60.
