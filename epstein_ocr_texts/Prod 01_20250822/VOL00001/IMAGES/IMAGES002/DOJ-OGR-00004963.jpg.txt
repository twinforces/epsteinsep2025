Court. Dkt. No..314.. ‘Rule 23.1 is not,so superficial, nor casily circumvented., Nothing in the
rule limits :its application to lawyers who have formally ‘noticéd an appearance. To, the contrary;
as the text throughout the rule:makes clear, :it-applics. to statements made by lawyers (and. others)
“associated” with. “pending or imminent. criminal litigation.” S-D:N.¥. Local Criminal Rule

op-ed discussing his opinion of the merits of this case, These facts mean that the public, which
includes potential jurors, may perceive Mr. Markus as an. authoritative source of information
Mr. Markus. is therefore ORDERED to comply with Local, Criminal Rule, 23...

The Government docs not ask'the, Court'to discipline. Mr. Markus based on his. op-ed and
the Court declines to.consider'whether. it violated Rule 23.1 given the potential lack: of clarity.
