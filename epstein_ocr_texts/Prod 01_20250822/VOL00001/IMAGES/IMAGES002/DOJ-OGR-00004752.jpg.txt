15 sentencing. Do you understand that?

16 THE DEFENDANT: Yes.

17 THE COURT: All right. Has the government reviewed

18 the presentence report?

19 MR. CHIUCHIOLO: Yes, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: Any additions, deletions or corrections?

22 THE COURT: Does the government wish to be heard on
23 sentencing?

25 on its sentencing submission, which the Court has reviewed.
