government. (Dkt. 207 at 9-13). Ms. Maxwell nevertheless preserves her argument and reasserts
it with respect to Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment.

As it existed in 2004, the federal sex trafficking statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1591, charged in
Counts Five and Six of the $2 Indictment provided that “[w]hoever knowingly ... recruits,
entices, harbors, transports, provides, or obtains by any means a person ... knowing that ... the
person has not attained the age of 18 years and will be caused to engage in a commercial sex act”
is guilty of acrime.” 18 U.S.C. § 1591(a) (2004). Because the statute uses the phrase “will be
caused” before the phrase “to engage in a commercial sex act,” it is not necessary for the
commercial sex act to take place for the crime to be complete. See United States v. Garcia-
Gonzalez, 714 F.3d 306, 312 (5" Cir. 2013) (“The future verb tense of the phrase ‘will be
caused’—which precedes ‘to engage in a commercial sex act’”—indicates that a sex act does not
have to occur to satisfy the elements of the child-sex-trafficking offense.”). For the reasons
already set forth in Ms. Maxwell’s previous motion, the statute of limitations in 18 U.S.C. §
3283 does not govern 18 U.S.C. § 1591 because the offense does not “necessarily entail” the
sexual abuse of a minor and therefore is not an “offense involving” such conduct. Counts Five
and Six must therefore be dismissed.

IV. The Court Should Dismiss Count Five and Either Count One or Count Three as

Multiplicitous.

Count Five must also be dismissed along with either Count One or Count Three as
multiplicitous. In her previous motions, Ms. Maxwell argued that the Court should dismiss
either Count One or Count Three of the $1 Indictment as multiplicitous because they charged the
same conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. § 371. (Dkt. 122, 210). Count Five of the S2 Indictment
charges Ms. Maxwell with yet another § 371 conspiracy from 2001-2004 based on the
allegations of Accuser-4. (S2 Indictment 9 22-25). These same allegations are fully
