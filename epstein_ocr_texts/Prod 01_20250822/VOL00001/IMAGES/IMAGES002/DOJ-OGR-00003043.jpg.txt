De Maxwell’s Fourth Amendment Claim Fails

Maxwell’s Fourth Amendment motion is premised on a wholly unsupported expansion of
the law. Because Maxwell lacked a privacy interest in the files of a third party law firm who
represented her adversary in civil litigation, and because the subpoena was entirely lawful, she
cannot make out a Fourth Amendment violation. Moreover, even if Maxwell had standing to assert
this claim, it would nonetheless fail because the Government relied in good faith on a judicial order
permitting compliance with its subpoena.

i. Applicable Law

The Fourth Amendment protects the “right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.” U.S. Const. amend IV.
“The basic purpose of this Amendment . . . is to safeguard the privacy and security of individuals
against arbitrary invasions by governmental officials.” Carpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct.

‘Fourth Amendment rights are personal rights . . . [that] may not be vicariously asserted.’” United

(1978)). Accordingly, a defendant’s Fourth Amendment rights “are violated only when the
challenged conduct invaded his legitimate expectation of privacy rather than that of a third party.”
United States v. Payner, 447 U.S. 727, 731 (1980) (emphasis in original); see also United States
v. Villegas, 899 F.2d 1324, 1333 (2d Cir. 1990). Ultimately, the Fourth Amendment inquiry is
“whether [a] defendant has established a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched.”
United States v. Chuang, 897 F.2d 646, 649 (2d Cir. 1990) (citations omitted). This threshold
question involves two separate inquiries: (1) whether a defendant has demonstrated a subjective
