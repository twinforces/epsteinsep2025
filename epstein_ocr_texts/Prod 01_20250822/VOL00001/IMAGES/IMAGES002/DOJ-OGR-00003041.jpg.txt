public interest” which resulted in the Government convening a grand jury to investigate a serious
crime. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22-23). The Court also noted that because the investigation was not
publicly known, “the ordinary exercise of grand jury power [i.e., to subpoena witnesses to testify
and to produce documents] . . . would implicate and invite the very risk of disclosure—and the
possibility of alerting potential criminal targets that they are under investigation, causing them to
destroy evidence, flee from prosecution, or otherwise seriously jeopardize the Investigation—that
caused the Government to proceed via subpoena [to Boies Schiller] and its related Application.”
(id. at 23-24). The Court further noted that the “Government’s interest is bolstered” as the request
was made by a grand jury that had issued a “subpoena for the production of documents as part of
an ongoing investigation.” (/d. at 25). In support of her argument, the defendant cites Palmieri
where the Second Circuit, applying Martindell, reversed the district court’s decision granting the
state Attorney General’s motion to intervene to modify sealing orders. (Def. Mot. 11 at 14).
Maxwell’s reliance on Palmieri is of no avail. There, the Second Circuit held that the district court
erred by not expressly finding that the state had shown improvidence, extraordinary circumstances,
or compelling need before modifying the sealing orders in a civil case. Palmieri, 779 F.2d at 862,
866. By contrast, here Chief Judge McMahon made this explicit finding.

Judge Netburn, on the other hand, rejected the Government’s arguments for exceptional
circumstances and compelling need as “unpersuasive” under the Martindell standard. (Def. Mot.
3, Ex. H at 6). Maxwell argues that Judge Netburn was “exactly right” in her analysis of whether
exceptional circumstances existed, but ignores the fact that Chief Judge McMahon made contrary
findings on this point. That two neutral judicial officers were presented with the facts, analyzed
the law, and reached varying conclusions based on different findings shows that there are
guardrails in place to ensure compliance with Martindell. In other words, the Government in no
