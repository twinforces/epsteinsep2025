crime. (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. Gat 22-23). The Court also-noted that because the investigation was not:
publicly known, “the: ordinary exercise: of grand jury power [i.¢., to subpoena witnesses to testify
and. to produce documents] ... . would implicate and, invite the: very risk of disclosure—and ‘the:

exceptional. circumstances existed, but ignores the fact that Chicf Judge McMahon made contrary
findings on'this point. ‘That.two neutral judicial officers were presented with the facts, analyzed.
