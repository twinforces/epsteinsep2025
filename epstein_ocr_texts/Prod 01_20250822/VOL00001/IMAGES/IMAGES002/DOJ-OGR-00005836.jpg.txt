because evidence was “pertinent to whether he used, the internet in an. attempt to engage in sexual
conduct: with” putative'victim).

The defense argues that. this testimony will be unfairly prejudicial to ‘the defendant. See
Fed. R.’Evid. 403. According to the defense, iff Minor Victim-3 ‘testifies. that she had sex’ witha,
“much older man:when.she was ‘1.7 years old” or'that.she was sexually abused, the jury will assume
that Epstein, engaged in illegal conduct, which will, somehow prejudice the defendant. (Def. Mot.
4 at, 13). The Court. should ‘not. assume that the jury will speculate about ‘principles, of United.
Kingdom law:and apply them totthis case. The Court will properly instruct'the jury‘on the elements
of the offenses charged ‘in, the Indictment and. the evidence that the jury can—and, cannot—
consider. Those instructions will tiot ask the jury to consider or:pass upon any aspéct: of United,
Kingdom law, which will. not be: in evidence: at trial. And in any event, as discussed in the:
Government’s opposition,to' the defendant’s pretrial, motion ‘to strike references to Minor Victim-
3 in the Indictment, evidence, regarding Minor Vietim-3’s,experictices ‘with the defendant and
2. The risk of unfair‘prejudice is therefore minimal.

In. the: alternative, the. defense secks three: rulings: (1) precluding the: Government from.
referring to Minor Victim-3 asa “minor,” (2) precluding the Government, and ‘Minor Vietim-3
from representitig that she was “sexually abused” by Epstcin, ard (3) giving:a limiting ‘instruction
about. United Kingdom law. The'defense’s :requested rulings are not. grounded in law or:reason.

First, the defense:claims that:Minor Victim-3 should not be referred to as.a,“‘minor” because

she was above the age of consent inthe relevant jurisdictions at' the times she had sexual. contact.
