Epstein massages that were sexual in nature, and that Epstein had used “various types of pressure”
to avoid prosecution by the state, including hiring attorneys who had personal connections to the
State Attorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal in speaking to Acosta and Sloman at the outset
of the federal investigation was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely
employ. Villafafia explained, “When you have a case that you know people are going to be getting
calls about . . . you just want to make sure that they know about it so they don’t get .. . a call from
out of the blue.” According to Villafafia, she told Acosta and Sloman that the FBI was willing to
put the necessary resources into the case, and she was willing to put in the time, but she “didn’t
want to get to the end and have [the] same situation occur” with a federal prosecution as had
occurred with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to them that I expected
the case would be time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the FBI’s
resources if the Office would just back down to pressure at the end.” According to Villafafia,
Acosta and Sloman promised that “if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” In a later
email to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafafia recounted that she spoke with Acosta and
Sloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state prosecution can happen to a federal
prosecution if the U.S. Attorney isn’t on board,” but Acosta and Sloman had given her “the green
light” to go forward with the Epstein investigation.

Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR that they did not recall the July 2006 meeting with
Villafafia. Each told OPR that at the time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not
previously heard of Epstein.”

Acosta told OPR that he understood from the outset that the case involved a wealthy man
who was “doing sordid things” with girls, and that it “seemed a reasonable matter to pursue”
federally. Epstein’s wealth and status did not raise any concern for him, because, as Acosta told
OPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the
federal interest he perceived at the time to be implicated by the case, Acosta responded, “the
exploitation of girls or minor females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view that she had been given a
“sreen light” to proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR that he would not likely have
explicitly told Villafafia to “go spend your time” on the case; rather, his practice would have been
simply to acknowledge the information she shared about the case and confirm that a federal
investigation “sound[ed] reasonable.”

Sloman told OPR that he could not recall what he initially knew about the Epstein
investigation, other than that he had a basic understanding that the State Attorney’s Office had
“abdicated their responsibility” to investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,
Sloman did not recall with specificity Villafafia’s concern about Epstein’s team pressuring the
State Attorney’s Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect
the USAO, noting that as of July 2006, the USAO had recently prosecuted wealthy and politically
connected lobbyist Jack Abramoff.

22 Lourie told OPR that when he first heard about the Leap Year investigation, he likewise was unaware of
Epstein. On July 24, 2006, Villafafia emailed to Sloman a link to a Palm Beach Post article that described Epstein as
a “Manhattan money manager” and “part-time Palm Beacher who has socialized with Donald Trump, Bill Clinton and
Kevin Spacey.” Sloman forwarded the article to Acosta.
