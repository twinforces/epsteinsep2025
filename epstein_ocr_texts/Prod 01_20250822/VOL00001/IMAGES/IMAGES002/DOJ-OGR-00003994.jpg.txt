Counsel for Ms. Maxwell, immediately upon receipt, began reviewing the material which
consists of various statements, transcripts, interviews, and background information related to 225
individuals who live in different parts of the United States and the world. Generally, the
witnesses fall into several categories: alleged Epstein victims, former Epstein employees,
potential targets of the Epstein investigation, or percipient witnesses. There are two good reasons
that these witnesses will not be government trial witnesses: they say things that help Ms.
Maxwell or are patently unbelievable.

This review is just begun, ongoing, and not nearly finished. Although the government
“produced” the materials to defense counsel on April 13, 2021, as of today’s date, Ms. Maxwell
still has not yet received this discovery and has not been able to review it personally and with her
counsel. The government has represented that it sent a CD with the materials to the MDC the
same it was produced to defense counsel. Defense counsel also delivered a hard drive to the
government on April 13, 2021 to load the materials so that Ms. Maxwell could review the
materials on the laptop, which does not have a CD drive. Ms. Maxwell has received neither.

The government claimed that the hard-drive took several days to load, and that it currently is
somewhere in the mailroom at MDC. With less than 90 days before trial, the inability for Ms.
Maxwell to review more than 20,000 pages of largely exculpatory material presents a significant
impediment to her trial preparation.

Defense counsel anticipate that simply reading the material and discussing it with Ms.
Maxwell (who still does not have the information) will take will take weeks. Ms. Maxwell’s lack
of access to the information (actual and logistical) combined with the age of the allegations and
Maxwell lacked knowledge of Epstein’s sex trafficking scheme, were only produced to her
counsel (and not her) on April 13, 2021. As the Brady order specifies, continuance is a remedy.
