Counsel for Ms., Maxwell, immediately upon receipt, began reviewing the material which,
consists of various statenients, transcripts, interviews, and. background. information related to 225
individuals-who live in different parts of:the United.States and.the world. ‘Generally, the
witnesses fall into several categories: alleged Epstein. victims, former Epstcin employces,
potential,targets ofthe Epstcin investigation, or percipicnt witnesses. There are two good reasons,
Maxwell or are patently unbelievable.

This revicw is just. begun,, ongoing, and not nearly’ finished. Although the government
“produced” the materials to defense counscl,on April 13, 2021, as of today’s datc,’Ms. Maxwell
still has not’yet reccived.this discovery and.has not been able to review it personally and, with her
‘counsel. The government has represented that it sent a‘'CD ‘with the materials to the: MDC the:
same: It'was produced. to defense counsel. ‘Defense counsel also delivered, a hard drive to the
government on.April 13, 2021-to load the materials so that Ms. Maxwell could:revicw the
materials on,the: laptop, ‘which does not have a.CD drive. Ms. Maxwell has received ncither.

The government. claimed that the hard-drive took’ several days to load, and. that it: currently is
somewhere in.the mailroom at MDC. With less:than 90 days before trial, the inability for Ms.
Maxwell. fo review more than 20,000 pages of largely exculpatory material, presents a:significant
impediment'to her'trial preparation.

Defense counscl.anticipate that:simply reading the material and discussing, it with-Ms.
Maxwell (who still does not have the information) will take will take wecks.. Ms. Maxwell’s lack
of access to the information (actual, and logistical) combined with the age of the allegations and

Maxwell lacked. knowledge of Epstein’s sex trafficking ‘scheme, were only’produced to her
counsel (and:rot her) on. April 13, 2021. As the Brady order specifies, continuance is a remedy.
