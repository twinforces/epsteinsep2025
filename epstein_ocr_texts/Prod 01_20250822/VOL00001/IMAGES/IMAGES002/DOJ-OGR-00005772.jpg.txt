Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 395 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page /7of9

In view of this special role, “The prosecutor should not argue in terms of counsel’s
personal opinion, and should not imply special or secret knowledge of the truth or of witness
credibility.” ABA Criminal Justice Standards, Prosecution Function, Standard 3-6.8, Closing
Arguments to the Trier of Fact (4th ed. 2017). To do otherwise poses two distinct dangers:

such comments can convey the impression that evidence not present to the jury, but

known to the prosecutor, supports the charges against the defendant and can thus

jeopardize the defendant’s right to be tried solely on the basis of the evidence
presented to the jury; and the prosecutor’s opinion carries with it the imprimatur of

the Government and may induce the jury to trust the Government’s judgment rather

than its own view of the evidence.

United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 18-19 (1985). When the government uses the term “victim,”
however, it improperly vouches for the credibility of the accusers. E.g., Devey, 138 P.3d at 95.

It is even more important for the Court to refrain from referring to the accusers as
“victims” or “minor victims.” This Court serves as the neutral arbiter of the law. And

it is a matter of common knowledge that jurors hang tenaciously upon remarks

made by the court during the progress of the trial, and if, perchance, they are

enabled to discover the views of the court regarding the effect of a witness’
testimony or the merits of the case, they almost invariably follow them.
State v. Philpot, 66 N.W. 730, 732 (lowa 1896). Thus,

A judicial reference to the jury that a complaining witness is a ‘victim’ implicitly

tells the jury that the judge believes that a crime has been committed. For a judge

to communicate to the jury that witnesses were victimized, in a case where the

defense is that the conduct about which the complaining witness testifies never

occurred, prejudices that defendant unfairly.
Fritzinger v. State, 10 A.3d 603, 610 (Del. 2010).

There is a final reason no trial participant should refer to the accusers as “minor victims.”
Several charges in this case require proof that Ms. Maxwell knew the accusers were less than
eighteen years old at the time of the alleged conduct. Referring to the accusers as “minor
victims” not only supposes the accusers were victims at all, but it also conveys the speaker’s
belief that Ms. Maxwell knew they were “minors.” In this other way, referring to the accusers as
