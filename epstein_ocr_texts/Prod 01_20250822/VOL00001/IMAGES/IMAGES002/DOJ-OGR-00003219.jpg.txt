charge. Villafafia suggested meeting with the PBPD, ‘but the case agent explained that before:
formally presenting the case'to the FBI, the: PBPD wanted.to sce how the State Attorncy’s Office
decided to charge! Epstein.

1. The ‘PBPD Presents the Matter to the FBI and the USAO:

In. May 2006, the lead Detective: handling the state’s investigation met with Villafafia and,
the FBI case agent ‘to summarize ‘for them the information. léarned during: the state’s
investigation. 8 At the time, neither Villafana nor the case. agent had. heard of Epstcin-or had any’
knowledge of his: background.

According to Villafana, during this:mecting, the Detective expressed coneern that“pressure
had been. brought, to bear on . . . Krischer by Epstcin’s attorneys,” and he and. Chicf Reiter were
concerned ‘the, state, would charge Epstein, with only a:misdemeanor or:not at all. 9 The Detective
explained ‘that. the defense: had ‘hired private: investigators to trail Reiter and the: Detective, had.
raised:claims of-various impropricties' ‘by'the police, and, in the view‘of the PBPD, had orchestrated.
the removal of the Assistant State Attorncy initially assigned, to handle the matter, who was viewed,
as an aggressive prosccutor, by hiring a defense attorney: whose. relationship with the Assistant
State Attorncy‘ereated a conflict of:interest forthe prosecutor. Further, given the missing. computer
equipment and. surveillance camera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstcin may: have been.
“tipped off” in advance about the scarch warrant.

During the meeting, Villafafia revicwed the U.S. Code! to sce what. federal. charges could.
be brought against Epstein. She focused. on, 18 U.S.C. §§ 2422 (enticcment of minors into
prostitution. or other illegal sexual activity and use ofa facility: of interstate or forcign commerce
to: persuade: or inducc.a. minor to engage: in ‘prostitution ‘or other illegal sexual, activity) and 2423
(travel for purposes of engaging in illegal sexual conduct). As. they. discussed these charges, the
Detective told Villafafia, that; Epstein and his assistants had. traveled. out: of the Palm’ Beach
International Airport on. Epstcin’s private airplane, and flight logs sonictimes referred to
passengers. as “female” without a:name ‘or age,;which.the Detective suspected might be:references
to-underage girls. However, the Detective acknowledged that he was unable to confirm. that:
suspicion.and.did not have firm evidence indicating that Epstcin had.transported any girls interstate
or internationally. Nevertheless, Villafana belicved Epstcin could’be prosecuted federally, in part:
because of his own interstate and international travel to the Southern District of Florida to abuse:
girls. Villafafia discusséd with 'the.Deteetive and the case agent'the.additional investigation.necded
to prove violations of the federal. statutes she: had. identified. She told them. that :if the evidence
supported. it, the case could be prosecuted federally, but she: assured them, that opening a federal
investigation would not preclude the State Attorney’s Office from, charging Epstein ‘should. it:
choose to do:so.

Ik The-Detective: died in May;2018,
1 In his 2009 ‘deposition, Reiter testified that:after/he referred the Epstein matter'to the FBI, a Townsof Palm

Beachcofficial approached. Reiterand criticized his referral of the investigation to the FBI, telling Reiter thatthe victims
wereynot believable and “Palm‘Beach solves its:own:problems:”
