where we. are:in the ease.

First, |';wanted to address the. comment about' jumping ‘the chain of
command. .After’that. concern was. brought to my attention. several
months: ago, | have tried. very: hard. to be cognizant: of the chain of
command.... If there is.a particularinstance of violating the chain
of command that you. would like to discuss, | would be happy to.

The statement that, I have ‘not réspected. Alex’s ‘position regarding:
the prosceution of the casc demonstrates ‘why ‘you, hear the
frustration in the tonc:of: my c-mail. For two and.a. half months J
have been, asking: about what that position is. I have asked ‘for
direction, on, whether ‘to revise the indictment, whether there are
other issucs that Alex. wants addressed.'prior to deciding, whether
there, is additional investigation that needs. to be done, etc. Noric of
that direction has been forthcoming, so'l-am left with... . victims,

and agents’ all. demanding to: know why’ we: aren’t presenting an
indictment. Perhaps that lack: of direction is through no fault of

FBI was willing to invest the money, but I didn’t-want to get to the
end and. then, have the Office be intimidated by: the high-powered
lawyers. I-was assured that that would not happen. Now] feel like
there is.a glass, cciling that prevents me from. moving forward ‘while
evidence suggests that. Epstein is continuing to engage in. this
criminal behavior. Additionally, the FBI. has identified. two more
victims. If the case is not going to go forward, J think jit:is unfair to
give hope’ to more girls.

As ‘far as promising the FBI that an indictment was a foregoric
conclusion, I don’t know of any case in the Office where. an
investigation. has. been. opened with the plan. NOT to indict. And I
have ‘never presented an indictment package that has resulted in a
declination. | didn’t treat ‘this case any differently. I worked with
the agents to gather the evidence, and | prepared an. indictment
package, that' I béelicve establishes probable cause.'that..a. series of
crimes have: been committed. More importantly, | believe there ‘is
