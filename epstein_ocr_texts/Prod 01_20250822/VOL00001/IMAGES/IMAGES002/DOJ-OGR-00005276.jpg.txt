Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 364 _ Filed 10/22/21 Page3of3
28, 81, 95, 99, 101, 232, 241, 284, 301, 315, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the
proposed and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435
F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court’s planned individual voir dire process is designed to
carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial media. As noted
at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court’s consideration, any
appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors related to this case and
upcoming trial.

SO ORDERED.
