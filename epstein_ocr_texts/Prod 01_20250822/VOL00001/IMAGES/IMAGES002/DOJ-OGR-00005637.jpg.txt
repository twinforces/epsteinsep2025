“frequently occurs” are not reliable, because she does not explain how these conclusions were

This is exactly why the Court in United States v. Raymond excluded grooming testimony
in a prosecution for transporting a minor across state lines with the intent of engaging in illegal
sexual activity. In that case, the expert (Ken Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who
prefer younger child victims are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents to gain their
trust and obtain increased access to the potential victim” and that “[iJn my experience, many
valid claims of child sexual molestation, especially those by compliant child victims, involve the
delayed disclosures, inconsistencies, varying accounts, exaggerations, and lies often associated
with false allegations.” 700 F. Supp. 2d. at 148. The Court excluded this testimony as unreliable,
explaining:

Nowhere does Lanning cite an objective benchmark for these frequencies or

comparisons. What is “more likely”? Fifty-one percent? How many is “many”?

How few is “some”? What is the error rate for Lanning’s behavioral

generalizations? Can Lanning’s opinions be tested or challenged in any objective

sense? Nowhere do I see any discussion of false positives. How many cases has

Lanning found where people who possess all the characteristics he describes

nevertheless turn out to be innocent or where victims who behave as he describes

turns out to be lying? Has he even looked for such examples? For all I can tell, that

number may be more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases he says that he

has investigated where a defendant turned out to be guilty or where a victim turned

out to be telling the truth. And are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?

For example, Lanning describes what the “grooming or seduction process usually

consists of.” But what if a defendant fails to do one of the things that Lanning’s

child molester would usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he

must therefore not have been grooming a child?

Id. at 148-49 (citations and footnote omitted). This Court should apply the teachings of Raymond
to this case.
