excluding the testimony of.a defense ‘witness as. a sanction for counsel’s (1) noncompliance with a.
discovery ‘rule that réquired ‘notice of intention to call the witness, and (ii) misléading the: court.
concerning his knowledge of the witness’s. whereabouts. The Supreme Court. found, the discovery
violation was “both willful and. blatant.” /d/. at 416. Vavlordoes not support the defense’s position.
The defense, citing Vas/or, accuses, the Government of willfully violating the Court’s September
3, 2021 Order. (See ‘Def. Mot. | at 6-7; seeid. at 3 (accusing the Government. of “attempting to
overstuff an already’ full sandbag”)).. The Government.did no such thing. The Government has
simply read. the word. “disclose” to mean. “disclose,” consistent with. the uniform practice in. this
District. The defense’s accusations are’bascless and offensive.

The defense has all of the co-conspirator statements the Government plans to use at trial.
They-have these records “unusually carly”—seven weeks before:trial. (Endorsed Letter at 3, Dkt.
No. 353); The defense also‘knows the identities of the limited;number of co-conspirators to whom,
the Government may refer at trial, a highly unusual circumstance, that makes the defense’s task:
‘even, easier. And they are ‘free 'to litigate the admissibility of any such statement during‘trial. The
Government has complied with its obligations, and the defense is fully equipped. to prepare for:
trial. The Court should deny the motion.

Vv. There is No Basis to Suppress Minor Victim-4’s Identification of the Defendant:

The défendant claims ‘that, Minor Victim-4’s identification. of her was unduly suggestive
and. should. be suppressed. (Def. Mot. 9). That.argument. finds support.in.ncither fact nor law.
Minor Victim-4 knew the defendant:personally, and she: has consistently described, the defendant.
for decades. ‘The. identification’was not. suggestive, andthe, motion should be, denied.
