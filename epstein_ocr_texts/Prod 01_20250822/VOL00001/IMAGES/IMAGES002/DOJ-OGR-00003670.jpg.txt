‘commission of the offense of, conviction, rather than.to the elements of the offense.” Jd. at 39
(emphasis added by:Court).. Because $ 3283 contains no such modification to the words “offense
involving,” Nijhawan is entirely consistent not.only with the Supreme Court.cases that interpret
“offense involving” language as referring ‘to elements ofthe offense, but also with a-similar
interpretation of the language as it appears in § 3283. 10

The Eighth.Circuit’s opinion. in United States'v. Coutentos, 65.1 F 3d 809 (8th Cir. 2011),
squares perfectly with this approach. In Coufentos, the court held that §.3283:did‘not apply'to a
chargé of possession. of child pornography, even;though. the facts of the casé:involved conduct
that went beyond, the elements of child:pornography and, according to the court, constituted
Sexual abuse. 651 F.3d.at:81.7. The government’s attempt to distinguish, Covientos on the
ground that “this. case does not involve the possession. of child pornography” (Opp. 411) misses
the point: In,determining whether § 3283. applied, the court did not consider evidence of actual.
sexual. abuse and instéad confined its focuis 'to the elements. of the, offense of'possession of' child.
requires the Court here to look only to the elements of § 2422(a) and § 2423(a), and to disregard
allegations. of conduct beyond those elements.

Finally, the government attempts to distinguish, Bridges, in;which the Supreme Court
used the equivalent of a “necessarily entails” approach specifically with respect'to, a statute of
limitations, and argues that-Bridges is an.outlier based on its legislative history. But'the

government fails to identify'a single statute of limitations ofher than § 3283 in which a, fact-

language is “equally. consistent with applying a fact-based-approach.” Opp. 39-40 (quoting Weingarten,. 865. F.3d at
60 nl 1). ‘However, Weingarten. relied exclusively, omAijhawan for that proposition; like the government, itcited no
casezin which a, fact-based approach‘had.been-used.to apply.an “offense involving” statute other than. $°3283. Invany.
