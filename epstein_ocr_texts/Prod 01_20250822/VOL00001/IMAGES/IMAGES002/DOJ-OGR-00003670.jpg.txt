commission of the offense of conviction, rather than to the elements of the offense.” /d. at 39
(emphasis added by Court). Because § 3283 contains no such modification to the words “offense
involving,” Nijhawan is entirely consistent not only with the Supreme Court cases that interpret
“offense involving” language as referring to elements of the offense, but also with a similar
interpretation of the language as it appears in § 3283.'°

The Eighth Circuit’s opinion in United States v. Coutentos, 651 F.3d 809 (8th Cir. 2011),
squares perfectly with this approach. In Coutentos, the court held that § 3283 did not apply to a
charge of possession of child pornography, even though the facts of the case involved conduct
that went beyond the elements of child pornography and, according to the court, constituted
sexual abuse. 651 F.3d at 817. The government’s attempt to distinguish Coutentos on the
ground that “this case does not involve the possession of child pornography” (Opp. 41) misses
the point: In determining whether § 3283 applied, the court did not consider evidence of actual
sexual abuse and instead confined its focus to the elements of the offense of possession of child
pomography. In other words, it used the “necessarily entails” approach. Similarly, § 3283
requires the Court here to look only to the elements of § 2422(a) and § 2423(a), and to disregard
allegations of conduct beyond those elements.

Finally, the government attempts to distinguish Bridges, in which the Supreme Court
used the equivalent of a “necessarily entails” approach specifically with respect to a statute of
limitations, and argues that Bridges is an outlier based on its legislative history. But the
government fails to identify a single statute of limitations other than § 3283 in which a fact-

° The government cites the Second Circuit’s statement in a footnote in Weingarten that the “offense involving”

language is “equally consistent with applying a fact-based approach.” Opp. 39-40 (quoting Weingarten, 865 F.3d at
60 n.11). However, Weingarten relied exclusively on Nijhawan for that proposition; like the government, it cited no
case in which a fact-based approach had been used to apply an “offense involving” statute other than § 3283. In any
event, the Second Circuit did not hold that a fact-based approach applies to § 3283; it held only, in the context of an
ineffective assistance claim, that it was “not obvious” which approach applies. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 60.
