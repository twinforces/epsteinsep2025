Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 212 Filed 04/16/21 Page 8.of 20

First, the Court:reco gnized that

[(]here is a world of difference between the: limited types of personal information.

addressed in.Smith-and Miller and.the exhaustive chronicle of location information

casually collected by wireless carriers today. The Government ‘thus is not asking

for.a straightforward application.of the third-party doctrine, but instead a significant

extension,of it to a distinct category of information.

Id. 82219. Sccond, the Court concluded that in “in.no meaningful sense” did Carpenter.
voluntarily “assume the risk” of “turning: over a comprehensive dossier of his physical,
movements.” Jd. at 2220.

The same logic applies here. There’is “world. of difference between. the limited types of
personal, information addressed in.Smith ‘and Miller and the exhaustive” and personal details
about Maxwell that are:contained in Boies Schiller’s 90,000 pages of confidential material.
These details include, for example; information about Maxwell’s sexual partners, sexual habits,
‘finances, and much,:much more..

Moreover, “it no meaningful sense” did Maxwell voluntarily shaté:this information with
Boies Schiller: Giuffre:sued’Maxwell, not:the. other way around. And the defamation: claim (the
only claim, Giuffre ever asseried against’Maxwell,-who did not file a.counterclaim) had nothing
to do with much of the confidential information Maxwell was foiced, over objection, to provide:
Maxwell’s motion to dismiss the perjury. counts for lack of materiality:and her motion for
severance, and the replies in.support. thereof, explain.this in more detail. Maxwell. Pre-Trial Mot.
Nos. 4 & 5.

But'the point is this: The defamation case should have been exiremely narrow; but Boies
Schiller ‘transformed it into something: much broader—a proxy prosecution of Epstein and
Maxwell for allegedly trafficking and abusing: Giuffre, which then:compelled Maxwell, over.
objection, to answer irrelevant and highly prejudicial personal. questions. None of it was

voluntary.
