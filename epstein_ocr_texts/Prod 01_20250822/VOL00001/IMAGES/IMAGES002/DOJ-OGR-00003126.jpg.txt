Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 192 of 239
the Court informing the jury that, to convict on any conspiracy count, it must find at least one overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy that occurred within the statute of limitations. See Benussi,
216 F. Supp. 2d at 309 (describing a similar jury instruction provided for a conspiracy containing
some allegations that were time-barred and others that were timely).

Second, the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 in the Indictment are no more
inflammatory or prejudicial than those describing the experiences of Minor Victim-1 and Minor
Victim-2. The references to “sexual abuse” accurately describe Minor Victim-3’s experience of
sex acts with Epstein as traumatic, exploitative, and abusive, and she will testify to that effect at
trial. Moreover, because these acts were committed in furtherance of the criminal conspiracies
charged in the Indictment, it is neither misleading nor prejudicial to imply that this activity
involved illegal conduct. More to the point, because evidence regarding Minor Victim-3 “‘is
admissible and relevant to the charge[s]” contained in Counts One and Three of the Indictment,
the language describing Minor Victim-3’s experiences in the Indictment “may not be stricken”
“regardless of how prejudicial the language is... .” Scarpa, 913 F.2d at 1013 (quoting DePalma,
461 F. Supp. at 797).

Finally, even if Minor Victim-3’s experiences did not constitute direct evidence of the
crimes charged—which they do—this same evidence will also be admissible pursuant to Rule
404(b) to prove the defendant’s knowledge, intent, and modus operandi. Federal Rule of Evidence
404(b) provides, in pertinent part:

Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not admissible to prove
a person’s character in order to show that on a particular occasion
the person acted in accordance with the character. This evidence
may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive,
opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence
of mistake, or lack of accident.
