the Court informing the jury that,to convict,on any:conspiracy count, it'must find.at least one overt.
act in furtherance of the conspiracy that occurred within the statute. of limitations. See Benirssi,
216 F. Supp. 2d.at 309 (describing a similar jury instruction provided. for a conspiracy containing
some. allegations’ that; were time-barred and, others that were timely).

Second, the allegations regarding Minor Victim-3 if thé Indictiment are, no. more
inflammatory or prejudicial, than those describing the experiences of Minor Victim-] and Minor
Victim-2. The ‘references, to “sexual abuse” accurately’ describe Minor Victim-3’s cxpericnce of
scx acts: with. Epstein ‘as traumatic, ‘exploitative, and. abusive, and she will testify to that cffect at.
trial. Morcover, because these acts were committed in furtherance of the criminal, conspiracies
charged, in the: Indictment, it is neither ‘misleading nor prejudicial to imply that this activity’
involved illegal conduct. More to the point, because .cvidenee regarding, Minor Victim-3 “is

admissible and, relevant; to'the charge[s]” contained ‘in, Counts One ‘and. Three of the, Indictment,

the language deseribing Minor Victim-3’s expericnees in ‘the, Indictment “may not be. stricken”
“regardless of how-prejudicial the language is... .” Scarpau,913 F.2d at 1013 (quoting, DePalma,
461 F. Supp. at: 797).

Finally, even if Minor Victim-3’s: experiences:.did not constitute direct. evidence of the
crimes charged—which they do—this same evidence’ will also be admissible pursuant fo Rule
404(b) to ‘prove the defendant’s knowledge, intent, and mods Operandi. Federal Rule of Evidence
404(b) provides, in.pertinent part:

Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or‘act is not:admissible to prove.
a ‘person’s character in order to show that on, a ‘particular occasion
‘the person. acted in accordance With the character. This,.cvidence
may: be admissible for another purpose, such as proving':motive,

opportunity; intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence
of ‘mistake, or lack of accident.
