Notice to those who use this form to request a subpoena
Before requesting and serving a subpoena pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c), the party seeking the subpoena is advised to
consult the rules of practice of the court in which the criminal proceeding is pending to determine whether any local rules
or orders establish requirements in connection with the issuance of such a subpoena. If no local rules or orders govern
practice under Rule 17(c), counsel should ask the assigned judge whether the court regulates practice under Rule 17(c) to
1) require prior judicial approval for the issuance of the subpoena, either on notice or ex parte; 2) specify where the
documents must be returned (e.g., to the court clerk, the chambers of the assigned judge, or counselâ€™s office); and 3)
require that counsel who receives produced documents provide them to opposing counsel absent a disclosure obligation
under Fed. R. Crim. P. 16.
Please note that Rule 17(c) (attached) provides that a subpoena for the production of certain information about a victim
may not be issued unless first approved by separate court order.
