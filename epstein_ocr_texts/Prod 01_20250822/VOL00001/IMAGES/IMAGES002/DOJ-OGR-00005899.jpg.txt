weaknesses of these definitions are discussed in turn below. First, O’Connell defines sexual
grooming as:

A course of conduct enacted by a suspected paedophile, which would give a reasonable

person cause for concern that any meeting with a child arising from the conduct would be

for unlawful purposes. (O’Connell, 2003, p. 6)

Second, Howitt suggests that:

Grooming ...is the steps taken by paedophiles to “entrap” their victims and is in

someways analogous to adult courtship. (Howitt, 1995, p. 176)

These two definitions are problematic, because they both refer to the term paedophile. Most
sexual offenders who target child victims use sexual grooming, not just those classified as
paedophiles. The term “paedophile” is a very specific clinical diagnosis, clearly not applicable
to all offenders, and the association of grooming behaviour with paedophilia may prevent
some offenders from acknowledging their own grooming behaviours. In addition, people
known to the offender may not identify the grooming behaviour because they do not consider
the individual to fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception of a paedophile is
littered with stereotypes that they are “dirty old men” or strangers; these perceptions may
affect an individual’s judgement of whether the behaviour they have observed is grooming.
These misperceptions distract from the truth that most victims know their abuser. It is
important that the wording of a definition does not thwart the identification of sexual
grooming and the subsequent prevention or ending of abuse.

Furthermore, the phrase “a course of conduct” requires subsequent definition.
Additional problems include reference to “a reasonable person” and “cause for concern’’.
Although legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ambiguous to the lay reader and
hence they are open to misinterpretation and confusion. These definitions are confusing, at
best, and at worst they reinforce the myth that strangers are the biggest risk to children.
Consequently, this ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual
grooming behaviours.

Gillespie (2002) provides the third definition:

The process by which a child is befriended by a would-be abuser in an attempt to gain the

child’s confidence and trust, enabling them to get the child to acquiesce to abusive

activity. It is frequently a pre-requisite for an abuser to gain access to a child. (Gillespie,

2002, p. 411; based on van Dam, 2001)

This definition avoids the use of the term paedophile. It also provides some clarity about the
purpose of sexual grooming behaviour and identifies some of the stages that it involves. This
appears to be the most appropriate published definition to date. Further evaluation of this
definition will follow consideration of previous literature and current understanding about
sexual grooming.

Prevalence

Canter, Hughes and Kirby (1998) provide evidence for the prevalence of the sexual grooming
phenomenon. They used Small Space Analysis on a behaviour matrix of the interaction
between 97 incarcerated child sex offenders and their victims. They identified three distinct
behaviour repertoires of offender—victim interaction. The different types of offender—victim
interaction acknowledged were aggressive, which was identifiable by the use of extreme
