weaknesses of these definitions are discussed. in. turn. bélow. First, ‘O’ Connell. défines sexual
A course of conduct enacted by a suspected ‘paedophile, which would give a reasonable
‘person cause for’concern that'any. meeting with a:child arising, from the conduct would be
‘for ‘unlawful ‘purposes. (O’Connell, :2003, p. 6)

Grooming ......is: the steps ‘taken by paedophiles: to “entrap” their, victims and. is in
someways analogous to adult courtship. (Howitt, 1995, p. ‘176)

These two definitions are:problematic, because they both refer’ to ‘the term pacdophile, Most,
sexual offenders who target child victims, use; sexual grooming, not. just those; classified as
paedophiles. The term “paedophile” ‘is a very specific clinical ‘diagnosis, clearly not applicable
to all. offenders, and the association. of grooming, behaviour ‘with pacdophilid may prevent
some Offenders. from acknowledging ‘their own gfoomifig behaviours. In addition, people
known:to the o fender :may:not identify-the grooming behaviour because they donot consider
the individual to; fit their image of a “paedophile”. The public perception, of a pacdophile ‘is
littered with. stereotypes that ‘they ‘are “dirty old. men” or strangers; ‘these perceptions may’
affect ‘an: individtial’s judgement of whether ‘the. behaviowt they havé observed is grooming.
These misperceptions distract from ‘the truth that most victims ‘know their abuser. It ‘is
important ‘that the wording ‘of a definition. does: not thwart the: identification of sexual
grooming and ‘the subsequent prevention or ‘ending of ‘abuse.

‘Furthermore, the. phrase “a course. of. conduct” requires. subsequenr definition.
Additiotial pro include: reference to “a reasonable person” and, “cause 'for concern”,
Although legal precedent defines these phrases, they are ‘ambiguous to the: lay reader and
‘hence; they’ are; open to; misinterpretation, and confusion. These definitions are, confusing; at,
‘best, and.‘at: worst:.they ‘reinforce the myth that ‘strangers are ‘the: biggest ‘risk to children.
Conseqtiently, this. ambiguity may hinder the identification of the full range of sexual
grooming behaviours.

Gillespie, (2002). provides the third ‘definition:

“‘The'process' by which a.child is’ befriended by a’ would-be abuser in/an attempt'to gain. the
child’s' Confidénce and. ‘trust, enabling them to get the child to. acquiesée to abusive
activity: Tt.is frequently ‘a pre-requisite for.an abuser to gain access. to:a child. (Gillespie,
2002; p. 411; based on van Dam, '200T)

This definition avoids the ‘use ofthe. term paedophile. Ir also ‘provides some. clarity:about the
(purpose of séxual. grooming behaviour and identifies some: of the stages that it involves. This
appears. to be the most appropriate published definition to date: Further evaluation. of this
definition will follow consideration, of previous literature and current understanding about,
sexual grooming,,

Prevalence

Canter, Hughes and.Kirby (1998) provide evidence forthe:prevalence.of the sexual grooming
phenomenon. They ‘used. Small Space Analysis on a behayiour matrix of the, interaction
between 97 incarcerated child sex offenders ‘and. their victims. They ‘identified ‘three: distinct
behaviour:repertoires of offender: ‘victim interaction. ‘The different types of offender: «victim
interaction acknowledged Were: aggressive, which Was idénufiable bY The tise of extreme
