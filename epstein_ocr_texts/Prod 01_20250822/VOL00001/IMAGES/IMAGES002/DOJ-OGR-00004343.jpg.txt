to avoid prosecution by the state, ‘including hiring attorneys who had sersonal 0 connections to the
State Attorney. Villafafia said that part of her goal. in speaking’to, Acosta and Sloman at the outsct.
of the federal investigation, Was to, sensitize them.to the tactics Epstein’s legal team would likely’
employ. Villafana explained, “When you have a case that you. know people are going to be getting
calls about:. . . you just-want to make'surc that they’ know about it so they don’t get... . a-call from,
out of the blue: ” According to Villafafia, she told. Acosta and Sloman that, the FBI was willing to
put.the necessary’ resources into the case, and she was willing’ to ‘put ‘in the time, but. she “didn’t.
want ‘to gct to the end, and have [the] same situation occur’ ‘with a. federal prosecution as had,
occurred with the state. She told OPR, “I: remember specifically saying to them that I expected
the case would be:time and resource-intensive and I did not want to invest the time and the: FBI's
resources if the Office would just. back, down. to pressure ‘at the end.” According to Villafafia,

Acosta and, Sloman promised that “if the evidenec jis there,:-we will prosecute the case.” In,a later
email to, Lourie and.her immediate: supervisor, Villafana recounted that she spoke with. Acosta and,
Sloman because she,“knew that Wwhat'has happened to:the state prosccution can happen.to a federal

OPR, the USAO had prosecuted “lots.of influential folks.” When asked by OPR to articulate the
federal interest he perecived at the time tobe implicated by’ the: case, Acosta responded, “the:
exploitation of girls or minor ‘females.” ‘Regarding Villafafia’s, view that she had been. given, a:
“green light” to: proceed with the investigation, Acosta toldOPR ‘that: he would not: likely: have
explicitly*told Villafana.to, “go spend ‘your time” on. the case; rather, his practice’would have been.
simply to. acknowledge the information she shared about:the case and. confirm ‘that <a. federal

Sloman. told, OPR. that he could not: recall what. he initially knew. about ‘the Epstcin,
investigation, other than, that he had a basic understanding, that the, State Attorney's Office had
“abdicated. their responsibility” to jnvesigare a and prosecute Epstein. | In. his OPR. interview,
‘State Attorney’ s Office, “but. he said hie v ‘was. never - concerned that political p pressure would affect
