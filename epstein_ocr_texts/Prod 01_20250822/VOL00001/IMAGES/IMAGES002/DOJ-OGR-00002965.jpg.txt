an. evidentiary hearing.

A. The NPA Does Not Bind the Southern District of New York

AS an initial.matter, the NPA is not énforcéable inthis District. To the contrary, it is black-
letter ‘Jaw: in this Circuit that:a. plea agreement: in. one district: does not apply elsewhere, in, the
absence of express indications not ‘present here. Indeed, the Second. Circuit has considered and
rejected the exact arguments the defendant advances in-her:motion. The defendant’s motion is
without any: basis in the law and should. be denied.

It is well settled in.the: Sccond.Circuit that “a'plea agreement in one: U.S. Attorney's office
docs ‘not, unless otherwise stated, bind. another.” United States v..Prisco, 391.F. App’x.920, 921
(2d Cir. 2010) (citing United, States’v.. Annabi, 771.F.2d 670, 672.(2d. Cir. 1985) (per: curiam) (A,
plea agrécment' binds only the office of the United States Attorncy'for the district in Which:the.plea.
is entered'unless it affirmatively appears that the agrcement:contemplates'a broader restriction.”));
United. States v. Salameh, 152..F.3d,88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998). This Circuit: “presumes a,narrow’
reading:of the boundaries of'a plea agrecment.unless.a defendant can affirmatively: cstablish:that a
more-expansive interpretation was contemplated.” United States v. Laskow, 688 F. Supp.85.1,. 854
(E.D‘N.Y. 1988) (citing Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672), aff'd, 867 F.2d. 1425 (2d Cir. 1988)(¢bl.). To
mect this burden, a. defendant must establish that cither the text of the agreement or the:
“negotiations between defendant and prosecutor” indicate a promise'to bind other districts.. United
States Vv. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986). For'the, reasons set forth below, the defendant’

districts.
