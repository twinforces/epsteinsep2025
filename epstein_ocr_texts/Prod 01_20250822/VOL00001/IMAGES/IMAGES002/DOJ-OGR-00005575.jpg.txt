private rather than public,” which avoids “catering” to “sensational” interests. (Gov’t Mot. at 16
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995); United States v. Cohen, 366
F. Supp. 3d 612, 626-627 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted)).
This limited sealing request is significantly protective of the interests of the Minor Victims, who
were sexually abused as minors, and minimally burdensome to the public. See Paris, 2007 WL
1484974, at *2 (concluding that the interest in protecting victim identities outweighs the public
interest in access to information because “the public and press will be able to hear the Jane Does’
and Minors’ testimony in full’); cf. 18 U.S.C. § 3509 (d)(2) (permitting any papers that disclose
the name of a child to be filed under seal without the necessity of a court order). !”

Although the defense argues that this request is “contrary to well-established Second
Circuit Law” (Def. Opp. at 23), the cases it cites concern the strong presumption in favor of access
associated with public dissemination of records that are already shared publicly at trial. See United
States v. Graham, 257 F.3d 143, 149 (2d Cir. 2001); Application of National Broadcasting Co.,
635 F.2d 945, 951-52 (2d Cir. 1980). Both cases also recognize that no such presumption applies
for evidence submitted under seal, “because with respect to that item of evidence, the session of
court was not public.” Graham, 257 F.3d at 149 (quoting Application of National Broadcasting
Co., 635 F.2d at 952 n.4). Here, the Government is not seeking a limitation on information shared
in open court, so these cases are inapposite.

To the extent the defense wishes to make arguments about particular exhibits, (see Def. Opp. at
22-23), the Government is happy to address that on a document-by-document basis at trial.
