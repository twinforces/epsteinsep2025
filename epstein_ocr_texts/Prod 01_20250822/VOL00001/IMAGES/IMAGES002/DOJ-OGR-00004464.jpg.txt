3. The NPA Did Not Violate Department: Policy Relating 'to Deportation
of Criminal Aliens

During ‘the. negotiations, the USAO rejceted a defensc-offered provision prohibiting the
USAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing], or in any way encourag[ing] immigration. authorities to
institute immigration, ‘proccedings” against: two female assistants. However, OPR. considered.
whether the April, 28, 1995 memorandum imposed any. obligation on the USAO ‘to prosecute
Epstein’s two female assistants: who were known. to be forcign nationals=as Villafafia, urged in
her prosceution memorandum—and thus trigger their:removal, of conversely, whether it'preeluded
the USAO from. agrecing not to prosccute: them as part of.a negotiated resolution. OPR :-found

nothing in the policy that: created a.clear and unambiguous standard in ‘either regard,

The Attorney. General’s April 28, 1995 memorandum regarding “Deportation. of Criminal
Alicns” directed federal, prosécutors to beéome involved actively and directly in the process of
removing 3 criminal alicns: from the United States, ‘and, along: 3 with USAM §.9- 73. 520, Provided that.

Villafafia—was influenced by corruption, bias, or other improper 1 motive, such as'Epstcin’s wealth,
‘status, or, ‘political, associations, to include terms in the NPA, that. were ‘favorable to Epstein, or
