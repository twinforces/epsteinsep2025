‘ To Be Filed Under Seal
Shortly after the oral argument, the Court of Appeals issued an unusual order, giving the |
parties to the appeal ten days to explain why all papers submitted in connection with Maxwell’s |
unsuccessful motion for summary judgment should not immediately be unsealed. (18-2868, Dkt. |

As part of that investigation, the Government issued a subpoena to Boies Schiller

On February 5, 2019, the Government made an ex parte, in camera application to Judge |
Sweet under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), seeking to relieve Boies Schiller from the |
