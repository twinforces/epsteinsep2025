a 1 but of course this is fine for you to disclose this information |
2 to the government based on the validly issued grand jury |
3 subpoena, I think for the same type of reasons that the Court |
4 is describing. |
5 THE COURT: Okay. So let me see what other million |
6 questions that I have. |
7 It's a general subpoena. Did you take them for all |
8 discovery materials? I mean, everything that's in Boies |
9 Schiller's files, other than privileged documents, which of |
10 course you don't exclude from your subpoena but presumably they |
11 will exclude from their production. But it's literally |
12 everything. So remember, I know very little about the Maxwell :
f 13 case, both because it wasn't my case and, to the shock of |
14 nearly. everyone that I talk to, we're all too busy to worry |
15 about some litigation that's being handled by somebody else; :
16 and second, it seems to have been litigated entirely under seal |
47 so how could I have found out anything about it. Everything I |
18 know about this case I learned from reading about the Second

19 Circuit argument. Literally, everything.
20 So what assurance do I have that so broad a grand jury |
21 subpoena -- given that I have these competing interests between |
22 the terms of the protective order and the government's interest |
23 in conducting an investigation, what assurance do I have that |
24 you need all that stuff, that that's all somehow going to be |
25 relevant to your investigation? That is a concern from me |
