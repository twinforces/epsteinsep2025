names, but given the-government’s recent harbinger of a superseding indictment; likely to
attempt to fix some of these problems,-Ms. Maxwell is wasting time and moncy playing *whack-
a-mole with this Indictment.
II. This Indictment Does Not Satisfy Minimal Notice Requirements
In Hamling v.. United-States, 418°U.S. 87;.117-18 (1974), the United. States Supreme
Court explained the circumstances in which an indictment simply setting forth the offense in the
words of the statute may not suffice:

Our prior cases indicate that an indiciment is sufficient if it, first, contains ‘the
elements: a the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant, of the

nequittal ¢ or conviction. in bar of future prosecutions for the same. offense. It is
generally sufficient ‘that: an indictment set ‘forth the offense in the words of the
statute ‘itself, as long as those words of themselves fully, direcily, and. expressly,
without any uncertainty or ambiguity, sct forth all the clements necessary to:
constitute the offence intended to be punished. Undoubtedly the. language of the
statute may be used in the. gencral ‘description of an offence, ‘but:it must: be.
accompanied with, such a statement of the facts. and circumstances as ‘will inform
the accused of the specific: offence, coming under the gencral description, with
which [she] is charged... (cleaned up).

2? x3

The government has failed to provide'an indictment that “directly,” “expressly,” and “without
uncertainty or ambiguity” ‘scts ‘forth the allegations against her. The alleged facts are’vague and.
illusory and:no meaningful discovery has becn-provided. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot
adequately defend herself, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments'to the United States
Constitution.

Because Counts One:through.Four of the Indictrtient: lack. the basic factual: information.
necessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government.refuses to provide any
meaningful-discovery, the Court should cither distniss these.counts or direct the government-to

answer Ms. Maxwell’s requests: for particularity.
