names, but given the government’s recent harbinger of a superseding indictment, likely to
attempt to fix some of these problems, Ms. Maxwell is wasting time and money playing whack-
a-mole with this Indictment.

II. This Indictment Does Not Satisfy Minimal Notice Requirements

In Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 117-18 (1974), the United States Supreme
Court explained the circumstances in which an indictment simply setting forth the offense in the
words of the statute may not suffice:

Our prior cases indicate that an indictment is sufficient if it, first, contains the

elements of the offense charged and fairly informs a defendant of the

charge against which [s]he must defend, and, second, enables [her] to plead an
acquittal or conviction in bar of future prosecutions for the same offense. It is
generally sufficient that an indictment set forth the offense in the words of the
statute itself, as long as those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly,
without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to
constitute the offence intended to be punished. Undoubtedly the language of the
statute may be used in the general description of an offence, but it must be
accompanied with such a statement of the facts and circumstances as will inform

the accused of the specific offence, coming under the general description, with

which [she] is charged. (cleaned up).

The government has failed to provide an indictment that “directly,” “expressly,” and “without
uncertainty or ambiguity” sets forth the allegations against her. The alleged facts are vague and
illusory and no meaningful discovery has been provided. Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell cannot
adequately defend herself, in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States
Constitution.

CONCLUSION

Because Counts One through Four of the Indictment lack the basic factual information
necessary for Ms. Maxwell to prepare her defense, and the government refuses to provide any
meaningful discovery, the Court should either dismiss these counts or direct the government to
answer Ms. Maxwell’s requests for particularity.
