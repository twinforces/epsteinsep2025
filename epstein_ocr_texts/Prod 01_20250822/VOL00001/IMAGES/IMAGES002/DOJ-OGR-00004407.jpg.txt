Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 293-1 Filed 05/25/21 Page 110 of 349
Lefkowitz set forth arguments similar to those Sanchez had presented to Lourie, as to why
registration “based on the facts alleged in this case . . . simply does not make sense.” In the event
that Acosta did not agree to their proposed charges, Lefkowitz offered as an alternative “to stipulate
that the state offense” would “constitute a prior sexual offense for purposes of enhanced recidivist
sentencing” should Epstein ever again commit a federal sex offense against minors. As Lefkowitz
further argued, “By accepting this option, you would be substituting the certainty of recidivist
sentencing for the humiliation of registration.” Emails reflect that, early that afternoon, Acosta,
Lourie, and Villafafia discussed the matter in a conference call.

Lefkowitz also sent a revised version of the NPA to Villafafia that omitted identification of
the charge to which Epstein would plead guilty. Later that day, Lefkowitz emailed Acosta:

I got a call from [M]arie who said you had rejected our proposal.

Does that mean you are not even prepared to have [Epstein] commit

now to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his 18 month

sentence and then be sentenced to 12 month[s] community control

for that charge? I thought that was exactly what you proposed

[F]riday (although you wanted, but were not able, to do it with some

kind of federal charge).

But that still gives you a registerable sex offense, 30 months total,

and 18 in jail.

How can that not satisfy you—while still ensuring that [E]pstein is

not unduly endangered in jail?
Acosta responded, “I do not mean to be difficult, but our negotiations must take place with the
AUSAs assigned to the case.” Acosta added that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafafia, and
they had “discretion to proceed as they believe just and appropriate.” Acosta copied Villafafia,
and she emailed Acosta to thank him “for the support.”

L. The Defense Adds a Confidentiality Clause

Throughout that Sunday evening, Lefkowitz had numerous email exchanges with
Villafafia, and apparently a conference call with Lourie (who was returning to Washington, D.C.)
and Villafafia. Later that evening, Lefkowitz sent Villafafia a new version of the NPA that, for the
first time, included a confidentiality term:

It is the intention of the parties to this Agreement that it not be
disseminated or disclosed except pursuant to court order. In the
event the Government must disclose this Agreement in response to
a request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the
Government agrees to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure
of this Agreement.

After making additional revisions, Villafafia sent this NPA to Acosta and Lourie as the
“final” version, asking Acosta to let her know what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she
changed the confidentiality provision to the following:
