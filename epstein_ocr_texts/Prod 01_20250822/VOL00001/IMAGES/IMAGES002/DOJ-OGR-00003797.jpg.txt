INTRODUCTION

Ms. Maxwell, through counsel, requests, pursuant to Rules 37( a) and 26(c) of the
Federal Rules of Civil Procedure that the Court enter an order requiring Plaintiff to either
disclose any purported ongoing criminal investigations and any alleged supporting documents or
enter an order staying these proceedings pending the resolution of the purported “on-going
criminal investigations [sic]”. In support of this motion, Ms. Maxwell states:

interest privilege and other applicable privileges.” Jd. at 4. According to Plaintiff, she “can
immediately provide clear evidence to this Court of how [the purportedly ongoing] investigation
would be impaired...” /d. at 11. Further, Plaintiff refers to “the law enforcement inquiry that is
currently underway,” id., representing to the Court that, in fact, there is an active investigation
regarding Ms. Maxwell.

Ms. Maxwell is not aware of any such investigation. Indeed, a review of the now more

suspect in any of the activity which resulted in any prosecution of Mr. Epstein. Counsel for Ms.
Maxwell have attempted to learn about any investigation by contacting Assistant United States
Attorney A. Marie Villafana, the Government lawyer handling the VRA litigation that Plaintiff
