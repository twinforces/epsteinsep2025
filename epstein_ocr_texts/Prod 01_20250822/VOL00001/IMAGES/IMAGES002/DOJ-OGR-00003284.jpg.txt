deadline looming, defense counsel pressed hard to climinate the sexual, offender requirement. On
Saturday, September 22, 2007, 'Sanchez'sent a serics of.cmails to Louric. In the first, she provided
details from a press report.about a Florida public official who the previous day had pled guilty: to
child sex abuse: charges and ‘was'sentenecd to a term of probation. She: noted ‘that: she ‘ ‘spoke. to
[M]att, [Menchel]” and asked Louric to call.her. Two hours latershe sent Louric'a second, lengthy
email, ‘strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against.
registration [as a sexual. offender] in this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that there had been
a.“miscommunication” during the September 12,,2007:mceeting, and that “we. only agreed to the
solicitation. with. minors because: we believed and [Krischer] and [Belohlavek] confirmed it was
NOT registrable.” Sanchez complained that lifetime ‘sexual, offender registration, was a, “life
sentence” that was, “uncalled for,” “docs.not make, sense,” and, was. “inappropriate” ‘to’ impose
“simply: [because] ‘the FBI wants it in rewurn for all there ie efforts. ” _ She: listed, numerous
sexual. offenses; the lack: of any danger of vovidivism: the case . with which he could be “tracked”
without registcring; and-that.it'would’be “virtually impossible to comply” with four separate state
registration requirements. A few minutes later, Sanchez sent Lefcourt’s phone numberto Lourie
“in-case youwant to speak’to, him directly.”

In another. email. sent less than. two hours later, Sanchez told Lourie she was writing, again.
result of a misunderstanding ata meeting.” “She stated that. Epstein’s S. attorneys ‘had * ‘consistently
emphasized their goal of 18:months in,a. federal. camp” and “[c¢]veryone knew that a. registerable
offense precluded” a. camp designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore it would have been wholly’
‘inconsistent with that primary goal of [Epstcin’s] safety to lightly: concede to registration at that
mecting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing a life sentence on. him is not something anyone will
eventually be proud of. Please reconsider and help me get.a fairresult.”

Lourie respondéd to nore of the Sanchez: emails, but he:did reach out to Acosta for a-:phone
conversation. By email late that night, at 10:26 p.m.,, Lefkowitz asked Louric to phone him.

The next day, Lefkowitz emailed. Acosta—with. copies to Sloman, Lourie, and. Villafatia—
‘to “follow. up on. our:conversation Friday,” asking Acosta again to reconsider the requirement. that:
Epstcin-plead’to a-registrable offense. Lefkowitz wrote that. there:had been.a “misunderstanding”
at the September 112, 2007 mecting:

Before the meeting, Mr. ‘Krischer and Ms. Belohlavck, a sex
prosecutor for' 13 years, told ‘us that solicitation, of 'a:minor . . . is not
arégisterable offense. However, as it turned out, [it] 1s-a registcrable
offense: and. our discussion at the meeting was based ‘on a. mistaken
assumption. We suggest that Mr. Epstein. enter two pleas—onc to
the Indictment.and a:sccond.to a non-registcrable charge.
