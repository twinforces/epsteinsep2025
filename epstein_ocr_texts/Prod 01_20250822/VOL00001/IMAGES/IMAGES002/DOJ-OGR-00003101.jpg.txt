J.) (permitting joinder of defendants under Rule 8(b)).

In the event that properly joined counts “appear[] to prejudice a defendant or the
government,” Rule 14(a) permits a court to “order separate trials of counts . . . or provide any other
relief that justice requires.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 14(a). “[I]n order to prevail” on a Rule 14 motion,

Sampson, 385 F.3d 183, 190 (2d Cir. 2004) (quoting Werner, 620 F.2d at 928). The defendant

United States v. Gracesqui, No. 10 Cr. 74 (PKC), 2015 WL 5231168, at *4 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 8,
2015), aff'd, 730 F. App’x 25 (2d Cir. 2018) (citing Page for the proposition that Zafiro applies
