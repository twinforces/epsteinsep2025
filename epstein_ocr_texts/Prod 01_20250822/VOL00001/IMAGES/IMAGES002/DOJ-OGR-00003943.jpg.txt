Re: United States'v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr.,330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:
April, 20, 202.1, which permitted the Government: an opportunity to submit a response, to the
defense:‘request for an adjournment of trial.in. the above-referenced case. (Dkt. No. 221). As
previewed, in its April. 9, 2021, letter (Dkt, No. 199), the Government. strenuously opposes any.
adjournment of the July ‘12, 202:1 trial date inthis case. ‘Given both the recently. granted severance
and the:Government’s intention.to present a streamlined.case focused.primarily on.the:experiences
of four victims, ‘trial on the ‘non-perjury counts in indictment. S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) (the “S2
Indietment”) ‘will. not be materially lengthened by 'the. addition, of new charges. As previously’
noted, the Government has made and ‘will continue to make significant efforts to. ensure that the:
defense, is able to prepare for trial.as scheduled. Morcover; delay. of the trial would ‘prejudice the
victims in this:casc, multiple ‘of whom. oppose any adjournment. Should the Court nevertheless

grant. the defense’s request for an adjournment, however, the Government respectfully requests

that trial be scheduled for March 2022 'to ensure continuity of Government counsel at trial.
