First Assistant District Attorney Kevin R. Steele’! was present during the initial stages of
the newly-revived investigation and participated in early discussions with Cosby’s new
lawyers, Brian J. McMonagle, Esquire, and Patrick J. O'Conner, Esquire.

On September 23, 2015, upon learning that D.A. Ferman had reopened the case,
former D.A. Castor sent her an email, to which he attached his February 17, 2005 press
release, stating the following:

Dear Risa,

| certainly know better than to believe what | read in the newspaper, and |

have witnessed first hand your legal acumen. So you almost certainly know

this already. |’m writing to you just in case you might have forgotten what

we did with Cosby back in 2005. Attached is my opinion from then.

Once we decided that the chances of prevailing in a criminal case were too

remote to make an arrest, | concluded that the best way to achieve justice

was to create an atmosphere where [Constand] would have the best chance

of prevailing in a civil suit against Cosby. With the agreement of [Attorney]

Phillips and [Constand’s] lawyers, | wrote the attached as the ONLY

comment | would make while the civil case was pending. Again, with the

agreement of the defense lawyer and [Constand’s] lawyers, | intentionally

and specifically bound the Commonwealth that there would be no state

prosecution of Cosby in order to remove from him the ability to claim his

Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination, thus forcing him to

sit for a deposition under oath. [Attorney Phillips] was speaking for Cosby’s

side at the time, but he was in contact with Cosby’s civil lawyers who did

not deal with me directly that | recall. | only discovered today that [Attorney

Phillips] had died. But those lawyers representing [Constand] civilly, whose

names | did not remember until | saw them in recent media accounts, were

part of this agreement because they wanted to make Cosby testify. |

believed at the time that they thought making him testify would solidify their

civil case, but the only way to do that was for us (the Commonwealth) to

promise not to prosecute him. So in effect, that is what | did. | never made

an important decision without discussing it with you during your tenure as

First Assistant.

Knowing the above, | can see no possibility that Cosby’s deposition could

be used in a state criminal case, because | would have to testify as to what

happened, and the deposition would be subject to suppression. | cannot
" Mr. Steele has since been elected District Attorney of Montgomery County.
