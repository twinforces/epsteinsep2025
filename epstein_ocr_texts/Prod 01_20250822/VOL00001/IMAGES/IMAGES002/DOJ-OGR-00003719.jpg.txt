Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page11of16

The government complains that Ms. Maxwell has not cited any cases where a perjury
count was dismissed pretrial for “fundamental ambiguity.” Resp. 120. Of course, the government
must know that myriad examples exist. United States v. Cicalese, 863 F. Supp. 2d 231, 236—37
(E.D.N.Y. 2012), is instructive:

Succinctly, the prosecutor did not fulfill her obligation to “pin the witness down to

the specific object of [her] inquiry.” Bronston, 409 U.S. at 360. Any number of

straightforward follow-up questions could have clarified the object of inquiry. For

example, in addition to the “attempt” question mentioned earlier, the government

could have cured the ambiguity by supplying the date, time or location of the target

meeting, focusing Cicalese's attention on the specific events at

issue. See Razzaia, 370 F.Supp. at 578-79. Left naked, the government's imprecise

question did not meet the standard set in Bronston. It cannot provide a jury with

a sufficient basis to reasonably conclude that Cicalese willfully lied by answering

as he did. Jd. at 579. Asking simple follow-up questions could have resolved the

imprecision and fulfilled the government's obligation under Bronston. Whether by

strategy or inadvertence, the government did not do so.
The Court granted Cicalese's motion to dismiss the charges against him. /d. at 232.

Similarly, in United States v. Landau, 737 F. Supp. 778 (S.D.N.Y. 1990), the court
dismissed a perjury indictment, holding “the context of all the preceding questions and Landau's
grand jury testimony as a whole, the prosecutor's questions here are fundamentally ambiguous
and cannot as a matter of law to support a perjury conviction. Landau's motion is therefore
granted and the indictment is dismissed.” /d. at 784-85 (emphasis added). The same is true
here. In the context of the questions preceding the selectively quoted testimony in Counts Five
and Six and the transcripts as a whole, the selected questions were fundamentally ambiguous.

In United States v. Manapat, 928 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir.1991), the Eleventh Circuit
affirmed an acquittal on the grounds of fundamental ambiguity as a result of the content of the
form that was the basis of the prosecution. There, the defendant applied for an Airman Medical
Certificate to the Federal Aviation Administration. The application included a section entitled
“Medical History” that contained twenty-four questions regarding “conditions.” The first twenty-
