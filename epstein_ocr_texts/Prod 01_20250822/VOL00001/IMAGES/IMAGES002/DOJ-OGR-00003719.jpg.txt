Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 208 Filed 04/16/21 Page 11o0f16

The government complains that Ms. Maxwell has:-not cited any cases where a perjury
count was dismissed pretrial for“fundamental ambiguity.” Resp: 120. Of course, the government
must know that inytiad examples exist. United Siates v: Cicalese, 863 F. Supp: 2d 231, 236-37
(E:D:N.Y. 2012), is instructive:

Succinctly, the:prosecutor did not fulfill her obligation to “pin.the witness down to

the specific object of [her] inquiry.” Bronston, 409 U:S. at 360: Any number of

straightforward follow-up-questions could have clarified the object of inquiry. For

example; in:addition to the “attempt” question mentioned carlicr, the government
could. have:cured the ambiguity by supplying ‘the. date, tie or location of the target
meeting, foctising. ‘Cicalese's attention on the. specific events at
issuc. See: Razzaia, 370.F Supp. at.578-79. Left naked, the g government's imprecise
question. did not mect the standard :set in Bronston. It cannot: provide a jury: with
a-sufficient basis. to-reasonably conclude that Cicalese willfully lied by. answering

as. he: did. /d. at 579. Asking ‘simple follow-up questions could have resolved the

imprecision and fulfilled:the. government's obligation under, Bronsion. Whether. by’

strategy or inadvertence, the government did not doso.
The-Court.granted Cicalese's motion to dismiss the charges against him. Jd. at 232.

Similarly, in United Slates v. Landati, 737 E. Supp. 778 (S:D.N.Y. 1990), the court
dismiss¢d.a perjury indictment, holding “the context of all the preceding questions and Landau's
grand jury testimony as a whole, the prosecutor's questions. here are fundamentally ambiguous:
and cannot as.a matter’ of law to support a perjury conviction. Landati's motion.is therefore
granted and.the indictment is dismissed.” Jd. at 784-85 (emphasis added). The same jis true
here. In:the context of the questions preceding the selectively quoted testimony in Counts.Five
and Six and the transcripts as a whole, ‘the selected. questions: were ‘fundamentally ambiguous.

In. United States v: Manapat, 928 F.2d 1097 (11th Cir.199.1); the Eleventh Circuit
affirmed :an acquittal on the grounds of fundamental ambiguity.as a result of the:content of the:
form that was the basis of the prosecution. There, the defendant applied for-an Airman Medical.

Certificate to the Federal| Aviation. Administration. The application included a section-cntitled

“Medical History” that contained twenty-four questions regarding “conditions.” The first twenty-
