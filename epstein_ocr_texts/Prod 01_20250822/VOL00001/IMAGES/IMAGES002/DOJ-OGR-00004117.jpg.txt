Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
$220 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear. Judge Nathan:

We write in response’to the government’s May 10,2021 Ictter to the: Court.regarding the
trial start date. This Court ordered that the partics meet and. confer regarding a trial. start date and
to:"agree to: the carliest-possible trial date this fall and to seck, adjustments to ‘other schedules in
order to facilitate an-carly’ fall trial start date." (Dkt. 266,at:3). [Defense counsel attempted to
‘confer with:the government in.good faithto finda mutually acceptable date. We sent several
emails to counsel stating our reliance on our April 22d submission, (Dkt. 246) where we specified
our conflicts and the justification for'our request. By contrast, and despite ourrequests for
clarification, the government failed to provide any details to justify its requestto delay the trial
start‘to November 29, 2021.. Instead, the government:filed.a lengthy submission. to the Court,
complete. with, case. law citations, at 8°12 p.m., a few hours before the deadline for the “joint

letter.” Moreover, the government also audaciously sccks by way of their joint Ictter regarding

the trial date to're-litigate the schedule this Court.has already. crafted after hearing’ from the
partics both on submissions and. in person, without even the courtesy of a motion for.
reconsideration:on that schedule.

For the reasons previously detailed in our April 22d letter'to, the Court, defense counsel’s
carlicst possible — and preferred. — trial start date:is November. 8". As the Court is aware, Judge

‘Furman moved my October 4" trial, to March, clearing the way-for this trial:to start on Noveniber
