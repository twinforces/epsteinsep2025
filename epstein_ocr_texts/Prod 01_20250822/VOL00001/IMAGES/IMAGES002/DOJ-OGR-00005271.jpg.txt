Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 362 Filed 10/20/21 Page3of4
Post, No. 92-301, 1992 WL 233354, at *2 (D.D.C. July 23, 1992); Copley Press, Inc. v. Superior
Court, 228 Cal. App. 3d 77, 89 (1991).

The presumption of openness that attaches to voir dire—including juror questionnaires—
“may be overcome only by an overriding interest based on findings that closure is essential to
preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest.’” Shkreli, 260 F. Supp. 3d at
260 (quoting Press—Enter. Co., 464 U.S. at 510). “Where the overriding interest to be protected
is the defendant’s right to a fair trial, the court must make specific findings that ‘there is a
substantial probability that the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced by publicity that
closure would prevent and, second, reasonable alternatives to closure cannot adequately protect
the defendant’s fair trial rights.’” /d. (quoting ABC, Inc. v. Stewart, 360 F.3d 90, 98-99 (2d Cir.
2004)). “The Second Circuit has explained that the party seeking to restrict press access bears a
‘heavy’ burden.” /d. (quoting Stewart, 360 F.3d at 106).

Here, the defense manifestly fails to carry its “heavy burden.” /d. The defendant’s request
to seal provides the Court with no basis on which to make the specific factual findings required to
conceal voir dire, including the parties’ joint juror questionnaire, from the public. Stewart, 360
F.3d at 98. In an effort to justify the defendant’s request, the Letter speculates that “media
coverage may prejudice the jury selection process.” Letter 1. Such conclusory speculation cannot
overcome the deeply rooted presumption of openness applicable to voir dire. Accordingly, the
Court should order the parties to file the proposed juror questionnaire and proposed voir dire on
the public docket.
