Past, No. 92-301, 1992, WL 233354, at.*2 (D.D.C. July 23, 1992); Copley Press, Ine. v. Superior
Court, 228. Cal. App. 3d°77,, 89 (1991).

The presumption of openness that attaches to voir dire—including juror questionnaires—:
“may. be overcome only’ by: am overriding interest based on.findings that. closure is,:essential to
preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored toserve that interest.’” Shkreli, 260.F. Supp. 3d at.
260 (quoting Press—Enter. Co., 464 U.S. at 510). “Where' the overriding interest to: be protected
is the defendant’s right, to a fair trial, ‘the court must ‘make specific. findings that’ ‘there ‘is a.
substantial probability that:the defendant’s right to a fair trial will be prejudiced ’by-publicity that
closure: would, prevent and, ‘second, reasonable alternatives to: closure cannot. adequately: protect:

the defendant’s fair trial. rights.”” /d. (quoting ABC, dnc. ¥. Stewart, 360.F.3d 90, 98-99 (2d Cir.

‘heavy’ burden.” Jd. (quoting Stewart; 360: F.3d at..1.06).

to seal provides the Court with no basis ‘on which, to make the specific factual findings required to
conceal voir dire, including’ the parties’ joint juror questionnaire, from the public. S/éwarr, 360
F.3d at 98. Jn an. effort to. justify the defendant’s request, the Letter speculates: that “media
coverage muy prejudice’ the jury selection process.” Letter 1. Such.conclusory'speculation :cannot.
overcome the deeply rooted presumption of openness applicable to voir dire. Accordingly, the
Court should. order the parties to file the proposed. juror questionnaire and ‘proposed voir dire on,
the public docket:
