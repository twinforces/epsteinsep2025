Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 266 Filed 05/03/21 Page3of3
this case, any adjournment runs the risk of precluding some attorneys from being able to
participate and/or requiring them to seek adjustments to schedules in other matters. And,
importantly, any victims and the public more broadly have a strong interest in trial proceeding
without undue delay. It is the Court’s obligation to ensure that the case proceed to that trial as
expeditiously as possible, taking into account the interests of justice and all relevant
circumstances. See 18 U.S.C. §3161(h)(7)(A); 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(7).

Having balanced all of the factors outlined above, the Court concludes that the interests
of justice justify granting a short continuance. The Court deems an adjournment until fall 2021
to be reasonable. Such an adjournment would plainly give the defense team sufficient time to
prepare for trial in light of the additional charges contained in the S2 indictment while also
ensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay. No additional delay is necessary or in the
interests of justice.

The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and by May 10, 2021, they shall
jointly propose a trial start date for the Court to request of the Clerk’s Office (as is required by
COVID protocols). The Court urges counsel to agree to the earliest possible date this fall and to
seek adjustments to other schedules in order to facilitate an early fall trial start date. The parties
shall also discuss and propose any adjustments necessary to the pre-trial schedule in place. Dkt.
No. 250. The Government may move in the letter for any requested exclusion of time under the
Speedy Trial Act.

SO ORDERED.
