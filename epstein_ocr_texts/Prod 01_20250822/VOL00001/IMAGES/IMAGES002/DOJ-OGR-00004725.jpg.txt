her interests or would have ‘made a, “substantial difference’ in, her case. (/d, at 17). In her‘current.
motion, the defendant. offers ‘tio additional. factual claims in. support of her argument. that the
passage .of time has prejudiced. her defense. She: instead :refers the: Court. back to her prior
hypothetical, vague, and conclusory claims of prejudice that do not withstand ‘scrutiny. The
deféndant-has not remotely carriéd-her “heavy burden” of proof: Corniclle, 1.71 F.3d.at'752. Her
renewed complaints are insufficient to'warrant dismissal of charges based upon, pre-indictment
delay. and.accordingly; the motion, should. be denied.

Because the defendant has failed to establish prejudice, the Court need not:address: the:
defendant’s specious arguments that. the Governments purpose in any’ alleged pre-indictment.
delay ‘was improper or designed 'to gain any'sort of tactical advantage. See United States v., Pierre-
Louis, No. 16 Cr. 541. (CM),.2018 WL 4043140, at *5 (S.D.N-Y. Aug. 9, 2018). In.any.event, in.
denying the defendant’s ‘pre-trial motions. filed in January, the Court. noted, the absence of
“evidence, ‘that’ ‘the, Government’s delay in bringing thesé charges was designed. ‘to. thwart
Maxwell’s ability to :prepare.a defense.” (Apr. Op. at 17). That.remains truc.

The defendant argues that; the “S2 Indictment only’ compounds [the excessive pre=
indictment. delay] issues by charging’ additional. offenses: based on alleged. conduct that the
government, has known, about since in or about 2007, which it, added. for tactical reasons to shore
up. its casé against, Ms. Maxwell’ (Def. Mot. at 22). The defendant’s argument: that the
Government acted in bad faith—to the extent she is making such an. argument—is based on no
evidence, whatsoever, and for, good reason: it is not truc.

As the ‘Government has:previously‘explainied (S¢e.Dkt. No. 199), the Government obtained.
the $2. Indictment—which added counts relating to the defendant’s abuse of an additional, minor

victim, Minor: Victim-4=based on ‘new. evidence that was not available to the :Government at the
