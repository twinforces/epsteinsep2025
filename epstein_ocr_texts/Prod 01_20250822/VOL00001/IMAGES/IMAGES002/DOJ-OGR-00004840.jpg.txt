assaulted at Cosby’s home in Cheltenham, then | thought they could go ahead with the
prosecution of that other case with some other Victim, so:long as they realized they could
not use ‘the Constand deposition and anything derived therefrom.” /d.

As noted, the trial court denied the motion, finding that ‘then-D.A. Castor never, in
fact, reached. an agreement with Cosby, or even promised Cosby ‘that the Commonwealth
considered the interaction between ‘the former district attorney and Cosby to be an
incomplete and unauthorized contemplation: of transactional immunity. The trial court
found no authority for the “proposition that a prosecutor may unilaterally confer
transactional immunity through a declaration as the sovereign.” /d. Rather, the court
noted, such immunity can be conferred only upon strict compliance with Pennsylvania’s

immunity statute, which is codified at 42 Pa.C.S. § 5947." Per the terms of the statute,

4 The immunity statute provides; in relevant part:
(a) General rule.--Immunity orders shall be available under this section in
all proceedings before:

necessary tothe public interest; and

(2) a witness. has refused or is likely to. refuse: to testify or provide
other information on ‘the basis of his privilege against self-
incrimination.
