Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 300 _ Filed 06/15/21 Page 7 of 32 3
L4TPDAYS
1 statutory maximum of 40 years' imprisonment, a minimum term of
2 four years to a maximum term of lifetime supervised release, a
3 maximum fine of $5 million, and a $100 special assessment.
4 In connection with this matter, I have received and
5 reviewed the presentence sentence investigation report prepared
6 by United States Probation Officer Sandra Vella Garcia. It was
7 filed with the Court on October 15, 2020. I have a letter on
8 the stationery of the United States Attorney's Office dated
9 March 27, 2020. That looks to me like the plea agreement. So
10 I have a copy of the plea agreement. I have a memo dated
11 April 22nd, 2021, on the stationery of the United States
12 Attorney's Office, which is in the nature of a sentencing
13 memorandum from the government. I have a sentencing memorandum
14 filed on April 21st, 2021 from Mr. Donaldson.
15 Aside from the waiver, which we'll talk about in one
16 minute, is there anything else I should have seen in writing
17 prior to today's proceeding? I should note that
18 Mr. Donaldson's memorandum has, I believe, some attachments to
19 it. No, it doesn't. It does not. That's the other one.
20 Okay.
21 Is there anything else I should have seen in writing
22 prior to today's proceeding from the government?
23 MR. CHIUCHIOLO: Not from the government, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: From the defense?
25 MR. DONALDSON: No, I don't believe so, your Honor.
