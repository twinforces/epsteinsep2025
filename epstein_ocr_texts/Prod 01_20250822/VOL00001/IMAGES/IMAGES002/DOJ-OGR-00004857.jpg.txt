Superior Court concluded that it could “ascertain no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s
determination that [Cosby] was not immune from prosecution, because Mr. Castor failed
to seek or obtain an immunity order pursuant to Section 5947.” /d. at 412. “Only a court
order conveying such immunity is legally binding in this Commonwealth.” /d.

granted by a court order, and where no court order granting him immunity existed.” /d. at
413.

The Superior Court further opined that there was “virtually no evidence in the

did so testify), it emphasized the Commonwealth’s argument that Attorney Schmitt
allowed Cosby to give a statement to the police during the initial investigation, that Cosby
did not incriminate himself at that point, that Attorney Schmitt further negotiated with the
