Government’s conversations with the defense, the Government requests that the Court seat only
jurors with availability beyond the Christmas holiday.

Defense Position: The defense anticipates it will present a defense case, which it currently
estimates will last approximately two weeks. That estimate may change after the defense has had
an opportunity to review the Government's witness and exhibit lists which were made available to
defense counsel last night after the close of business.” Additionally, as a general matter, the defense
believes that the length of cross-examination is determined by the scope of the direct examination,
not its length.

Joint Position: Accordingly, the parties jointly request that the Court seat only jurors with
availability beyond the Christmas holiday.

Respectfully submitted,

DAMIAN WILLIAMS

United States Attorney

2 Ms. Maxwell has not yet been provided a copy of the Government's late-night disclosures because the Government
was unwilling to hand-deliver a copy of their disclosures to MDC on the due date. The Government has informed
defense counsel that that Ms. Maxwell may receive the materials some time later this week via mail. After the
defendant has had an opportunity to review the disclosures and confer with counsel, the defense can update the Court
with any anticipated changes to its defense-case projections.
