8h. Ms. Maxwell's other trial counsel are committed to un-moveable trials in September and
October. We have provided all the details concerning those conflicts and sought, as the Court
directed, to move other conflicting dates. Considering Ms. Maxwell’s extended period of
detention, and its deleterious effect on her health and well-being, we cannot agree to a date far

In response to our efforts to meet and confer, the only date the government offered was
November 29". When asked to explain with details similar to those conveyed by defense
counsel, the government replied at 6:00 p.m. this evening simply that November 29" was

other assigned AUSAs have been involved from the very beginning of this investigation and
have actively participated in all of the interviews together. They were joined as often as not by
yet a fourth AUSA who previously was assigned to this case and who still works in their office.
Notably the government does not claim that the three remaining assistants are unfamiliar with the
facts or law of the case, nor that they are not competent trial counsel.

Second, the government points to a “potential” conflict of one witness who reportedly is
unavailable (for unknown reasons) for nearly two months — all of October through to
