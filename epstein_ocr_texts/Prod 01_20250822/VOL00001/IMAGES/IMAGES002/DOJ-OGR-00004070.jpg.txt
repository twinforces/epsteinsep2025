L4N3MAXC Arraignment

1 that agreed-upon motion in limine schedule, frankly, is

2 dependent on the various disclosure dates that the defense has
3 requested. And I wasn't sure that that was specific enough in
4 the submission that we made. But, we don't think it's tenable
5 to stick to the motion in limine schedule based on the

6 government's proposed disclosures.

7 THE COURT: Youtre essentially seeking four weeks from
8 disclosure to briefing on in limine.

9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Exactly.

10 THE COURT: And the government's proposing to give you
11 two weeks.

12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Correct. And it's less for the

13 exhibits, because we only have, under the government's

14 proposal, three days to respond with any motions in limine to
15 exhibits. So, that's the difference that I wanted the Court to
16 be aware of.

17 THE COURT: I do see that. Thank you.

18 Ms. Comey, there will undoubtedly be briefing.

19 Counsel needs time to review whatever the volume of that
20 material will be, the Court needs time to resolve the motions.
21 Is the government amenable to eight weeks for that disclosure?
22 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, the reason we've proposed 45
23 days is because, assuming the trial goes forward on July 12 as
24 scheduled, the government wants to make sure that we have time
25 to be careful and thorough in reviewing our files and making
