B. Subpoena Recipient-2

The proposed subpoena to Subpoena Recipient-2 contains four requests. The first seeks
any contingent fee and engagement agreements between Subpoena Recipient-2 and any
attorneys; the second seeks an envelope that allegedly has Epstein’s and Maxwell’s “touch
DNA”; the third seeks certain physical evidence, including photographs, old diaries, and
telephone books; and the fourth seeks EVCP materials. The first and fourth requests fail for the
same reasons as discussed above; their only plausible theory of relevance is impeachment, which
places them outside the proper scope of Rule 17(c).

The second and third requests are plainly sought for impeachment purposes. Indeed,
Maxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks production of the envelope in order to “disprove”
claims that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial if called to testify. Beyond a conclusory
assertion regarding Subpoena Recipient-2, however, Maxwell does not make any effort to
identify which claims she seeks to disprove. Nor does she explain why the envelope, or any
information derived from its inspection, is relevant to the criminal charges she is facing. At
most, that is, she seeks the envelope in order to impeach any testimony that Subpoena Recipient-
2 might have if called to testify. The request is speculative and clearly beyond the proper scope
of Rule 17(c).

The third request, for vast amounts of physical evidence that Subpoena Recipient-2
showed or produced to Subpoena Recipient-3, fails for two reasons. The first is relevance; as
above, Maxwell’s briefing makes clear that she seeks to examine the evidence in order to prepare
to rebut any testimony that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial (or any evidence
introduced through Subpoena Recipient-2). Here, too, the request seeks to impeach Subpoena
Recipient-2’s potential testimony. That is insufficient. Other than that, Maxwell makes no effort
