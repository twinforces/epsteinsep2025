B. Subpoena Recipient-2

The ‘proposed. subpocna to Subpocna Reécipient-2 contains four réquésts. The first. secks
any contingent fee and.cngagement agreements between. Subpoena Recipient-2 and any
attorneys; the: second, secks. an ‘envelope that allegedly has ‘Epstein”s and Maxwell’s “touch,
DNA”: the thifd sécks certain physical evidence, including photographs, old. diariés, and
telephone books; and the fourth secks EVCP materials. The:first and. fourth-requests fail :for the
same reasons as discussed above; their:only plausible theory: of:relevance is, impeachment, ‘which
places them:outside the proper scope of Rule 17(c).

The second and third requests are plainly sought. for: impeachment purposes. Indeed,
Maxwell’s bricfing makes clear that she sécks production. of the envelope in order to “disprove”
claims that Subpoena Recipient-2 might make at trial if called:to testify. ‘Beyond.a conclusory

‘assertion regarding Subpoena, Recipient-2, however, Maxwell does not make, any effort to

information derived. from its inspection, is relevant to the criminal charges she:is facing. At
most, that: is, she secks, the envelope in-order.to impeach any testimony. that Subpoena Recipient-
2 might have :ifcalled to testify. The request is speculative:and clearly’ beyond.the proper:scope
of Rule 17(c).

The third, request, for'vast amounts of physical evidence that. Subpoena Recipicnt-2
showed. or-produced.to Subpoena Recipient-3, fails fortwo reasons. The first is.relevance; as
above, Maxwell’s bricfing makes clear that she seeks to examine the evidenec in, order to prepare
to rebut aniy*testiniony that Subpocna Recipicnt-2. might make at trial, (or any evidence,

Recipicnt-2"s potential testimony. That is insufficient. Other than that, Maxwell:makes no effort
