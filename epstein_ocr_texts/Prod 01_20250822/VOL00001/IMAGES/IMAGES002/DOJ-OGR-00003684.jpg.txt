for example; it ‘is possible to transport'a. minor with, intent,to engage in criminal sexual activity
and not ‘follow through with the planned.sexual abuse, and so sexual. abuse is not.an essential
ingredient of the offense. Maxwell makes the:same argument for the enticement and related
conspiracy charges.

This, approach is analogous. to thé “categorical approach” employed. by courts to evaluate
prior convictions for immigration, and sentencing purposes. See: Lavlor v. United States, 495
US. 575, 602:(1990).. Generally: speaking; the “categorical approach” requires that courts “look
‘only to the statutory definitions—i.c., the elements” of the relevant offense to.determine if the:
provision.applics. “and not-to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.
United States, 570 U.S. 254, 261 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whether a statute
requires a ‘categorical or case-specific approach ‘is a question of statutory interpretation. To
determine whether ‘Congress used the word “offense” in a statute to refer to ‘an. offense in the
abstract or to the facts’ of cach, individual, casc, the Court:must cxamine the Statute’s “text,
context, and history.” United States v: Davis, 139'S. Ct, 2319, 2327 (2019).

Though it has not.authoritatively‘scttled the question, the Second Circuit has strongly
suggested.that Maxwell’s- approach is the wrong one. In Weingarten. v. United States, 865 F.3d
48, 58-60 (2d Cir. 2017), the Second. Circuit. discussed at length how the text, context, and.
history of § 3283 show'that Congress intendéd courts to apply the statute using a.cas¢-specific
approach. The Third. Circuit:rcached the:same conclusion. in United States -v.. Schneider, 801
F.3d 186, 196 (3d Cir. 2015).

The Court sces no reason-to depait from the reasoning in. Weingarten. First, “[t]hie
Supreme Court’s modern categorical approach jurisprudence is confined to the post-conviction

contexts of criminal, sentencing and immigration deportation cases.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 58.
