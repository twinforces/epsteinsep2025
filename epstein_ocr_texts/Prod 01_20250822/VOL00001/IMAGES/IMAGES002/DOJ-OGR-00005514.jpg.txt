Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 382 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page 59 of 69
Because nothing requires Ms. Maxwell to advise the government in advance of the
evidence she intends to admit at trial or why that evidence is relevant, this Court should deny the
government’s motion. If Ms. Maxwell’s attorneys have a good-faith belief that evidence will be

admissible, they can refer to that evidence in opening statement. ABA Criminal Justice
Standards, Defense Function, Standard 4-7.5(b) Opening Statement at Trial (“Defense counsel’s
opening statement at trial should be confined to a fair statement of the case from defense
counsel’s perspective, and discussion of evidence that defense counsel reasonably believes in
good faith will be available, offered, and admitted.”). When the defense offers evidence, the
government can make any objections it thinks are appropriate, and this Court can rule on the
objections in context. See United States v. Rounds, No. 10-CR-239S (1)(2)(3), 2015 WL
5918372, at *1 (W.D.N.Y. Oct. 9, 2015) (“Without hearing the evidence in context, this Court
cannot enter a blanket pretrial ruling. The government’s motion in /imine is therefore denied as
premature, without prejudice to the government raising this issue at an appropriate time during
trial.”).

Abuse -- Without Ms. Maxwell's Knowledge or Participation — May Be
Relevant to Existence of Conspiracy or Knowledge of Its Illegal Objectives.

The government seeks to exclude evidence that "many victims who were sexually abused
by Epstein...did not have personal interactions or dealings with the defendant, including during
the time period of the charged conspiracy." Mot. at 42. The government characterizes this
evidence as "good acts" of Ms. Maxwell (id. at 41-42); they are neither "good," nor Ms.
Maxwell's "acts." Rather, relying on inapposite cases, the government seeks to exclude as
"propensity" evidence the fact that Mr. Epstein sexually abused minors (other than the specified
Accusers) without Ms. Maxwell's knowledge and involvement. The government conveniently
overlooks that:
