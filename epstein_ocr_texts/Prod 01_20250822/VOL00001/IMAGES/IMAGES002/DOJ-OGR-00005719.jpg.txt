Here, the:putatively proffered documents were at the heart: of Mr. 'Rodrigucz's bribery: and.
obstruction scheme. The documents apparently did not surface until, 2009, decades, after the
claims here, years after the alleged. conspiracy, and five-ycars after Mr. Rodriguez was no longer
working for Mr. Epstein. The documents contain an-unexplained:notation, “P.B., 2004-2005” the
only potential (hearsay) date referenced in the docunients. There is no, evidence to suggest that.
these: documents were created.or maintained. by:Ms. Maxwell. -Indced, there: is :no evidence to
‘suggest;that these documents were created, or‘maintained by’ anyone. It.is entirely*probable that
whatewver'the documents are:they Were. manipulated or manufactured by: Mr. Rodriguez in.an
‘effort'to get a. $50,000 payday. United States v. Rodriguez, Case’ No. 9:09-mj-08308-LRJ, ECF
