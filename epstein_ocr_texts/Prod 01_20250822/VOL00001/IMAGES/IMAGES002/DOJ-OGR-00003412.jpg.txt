B. October 2007: Defense Attorneys Object 'to Government Victim Notifications

While the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that. notifying the victims about:
the resolution, of the case might haye:‘on a potential trial, defense counsel, also: raised concerns
about'what the victims could’be told about'the: NPA. As discussed. in. Chapter, Two, after the NPA,
‘was signed on September: 24, 2007, the USAO proposed ‘using a special master to sclect the
attorncy representative for the’victims, which led 'to, further discussions about the § 2255 provision.
On. October 5, 2007, “when defense  atromey Lefkowitz sent Villafana a letter responding t ‘to: the

ny

case” because such communications would * ‘violate: the confidentiality of the agreement” and
would. ‘prevent, Epstcin ‘from having control. over “what is. communicated to the identified,
individuals at this most critical. stage.” Lefkowitz followed. this communication with an. October
10,2007 letter to Acosta, arguing x that “[n]cither. federal agents:nor anyone from your Office:should.
contact the identified individuals to inform, them of the resolution of the case.”*"° Rather,
Lefkowitz wanted to “participate in.crafting a mutually acecptable communication to the identified,
individuals.”

them regarding possible claims against.Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do
‘that, it may be:a violation. of the Florida. Bar Rules for the :sclected
attorney to ‘cold. call’ the girls,

As discussed. in greater-detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2007, Lefkowitz sent: Acosta
a Ictter stating that Epstein expected to enter a. guilty plea in state: court.on. November 20, 2007,

305, The Professional. Responsibility Officer told OPR:that’he did not recall the case agent contacting him,about;
victim notification; nor did-he recall being involved in the Epstein matter, before the CVRA litigation was instituted,
in, July 2008 and ‘he: was assigned to handle the ‘litigation. Villafafa, told OI R, ‘that: they: consulted the Professional,
Responsibility Officer over the telephone, the call, took :no ‘more; than. “five: minutes,” and ‘the ‘Professional,

Responsibility-Officer, had no ether expesure'to the-case and thus, “*wouldn’t have [any] context forit:
