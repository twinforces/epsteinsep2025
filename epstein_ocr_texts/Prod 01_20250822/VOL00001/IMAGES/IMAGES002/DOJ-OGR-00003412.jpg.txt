for [victims] to enhance their stories” and that the defense would try to have Villafafia or the case
agents removed from the case.

Both the lead case agent and Villafafia told OPR that after the FBI raised with Villafafia
the concern that notifying the victims would create potential impeachment material in the event of
a breach and subsequent trial, they contacted the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer for
advice.  Villafafia recalled that during a brief telephone consultation, the Professional
Responsibility Officer advised her and the case agent that “it’s not really that big a concern, but if
you’re concerned about it then you should stop making the notification.”° In her 2017 CVRA
declaration, the case agent stated that after conferring with the USAO, the case agents stopped
notifying victims about the NPA.

B. October 2007: Defense Attorneys Object to Government Victim Notifications

While the case agents and Villafafia considered the impact that notifying the victims about
the resolution of the case might have on a potential trial, defense counsel also raised concerns
about what the victims could be told about the NPA. As discussed in Chapter Two, after the NPA
was signed on September 24, 2007, the USAO proposed using a special master to select the
attorney representative for the victims, which led to further discussions about the § 2255 provision.
On October 5, 2007, when defense attorney Lefkowitz sent Villafafia a letter responding to the
USAO’s proposal to use a special master, he cautioned that “neither federal agents nor anyone
from your Office should contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the
case” because such communications would “violate the confidentiality of the agreement” and
would prevent Epstein from having control over “what is communicated to the identified
individuals at this most critical stage.” Lefkowitz followed this communication with an October
10, 2007 letter to Acosta, arguing that “[n]either federal agents nor anyone from your Office should
contact the identified individuals to inform them of the resolution of the case.”*°° Rather,
Lefkowitz wanted to “participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication to the identified
individuals.”

On October 23, 2007, Villafafia raised the issue of victim notification with Sloman, stating:

Wealso have to contact the victims to tell [them] about the outcome
of the case and to advise them that an attorney will be contacting
them regarding possible claims against Mr. Epstein. If we don’t do
that, it may be a violation of the Florida Bar Rules for the selected
attorney to ‘cold call’ the girls.

As discussed in greater detail in Chapter Two, on October 23, 2007, Lefkowitz sent Acosta
a letter stating that Epstein expected to enter a guilty plea in state court on November 20, 2007,
a0 The Professional Responsibility Officer told OPR that he did not recall the case agent contacting him about
victim notification, nor did he recall being involved in the Epstein matter before the CVRA litigation was instituted
in July 2008 and he was assigned to handle the litigation. Villafafia told OPR that they consulted the Professional
Responsibility Officer over the telephone, the call took no more than “five minutes,” and the Professional
Responsibility Officer had no other exposure to the case and thus “wouldn’t have [any] context for it.”

306 Lefkowitz also argued that direct contact with the victims could violate grand jury secrecy rules.
