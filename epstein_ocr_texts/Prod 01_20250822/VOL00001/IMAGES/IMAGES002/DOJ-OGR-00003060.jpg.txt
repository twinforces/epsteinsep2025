behavior by a private party seeking to secure evidence against a defendant does not make that
evidence inadmissible.” Connelly, 479 U.S. at 166.

This does not mean that only action undertaken directly by the Government may violate
the Fifth Amendment (or another right). In certain circumstances, a private entity may be deemed
to be acting as a government agent. See United States v. Stein, 541 F.3d 130, 146 (2d Cir. 2008)
(“Actions of a private entity are attributable to the State if there is a sufficiently close nexus
between the State and the challenged action of the entity so that the action of the latter may be
fairly treated as that of the State itself.” (internal quotation marks and ellipsis omitted)).

However, this standard “‘is not satisfied when the state merely approves of or acquiesces in
the initiatives of the private entity, or when an entity is merely subject to governmental regulation.”

that a non-government entity chooses to cooperate with a government investigation or has its own
parallel investigation. See id. at 150. Non-government action is attributable to the government
“only when it can be said that the State is responsible for the specific conduct of which the
[defendant] complains.” Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004 (1982) (emphasis in original).
“Such responsibility is normally found when the State ‘has exercised coercive power or has
provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the choice must in law be
deemed to be that of the State.’” Stein, 541 F.3d at 147 (quoting Blum, 457 US. at 1004); see also
Flagg v. Yonkers Sav. & Loan Ass’n, 396 F.3d 178, 187 (2d Cir. 2005).

b. Discussion

As an initial matter, the defendant’s Fifth Amendment claim fails because she has not
demonstrated state action. Boies Schiller is not an agent of the Government and has not been at
any time during the course of the Government’s investigation, including when it initiated the civil
