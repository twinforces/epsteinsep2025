charges, alleging that the statements are proof of an effort by Ms. Maxwell to “conceal” her
involvement in facilitating the sexual abuse of Jeffrey Epstein. See S2 Superseding Indictment
(Dkt. 187) JJ 2 (second sentence), 10. For these same reasons discussed in the Court’s severance
ruling, and for the reasons set forth below, the government should not be allowed to introduce at
trial the deposition statements or any evidence related to the severed perjury counts for this
purpose or for any other purpose. Furthermore, the Court should redact from the superseding
indictment the two perjury counts and the allegations concerning Ms. Maxwell’s alleged effort to
“conceal” her conduct. See id. | 2 (second sentence), 10, 28-31.

ARGUMENT

I. The Court Should Exclude Evidence Related to the Perjury Counts and Redact

Those Allegations from the Superseding Indictment

Consistent with its prior ruling, the Court should exclude any evidence related to the
severed perjury counts to prove a purported attempt by Ms. Maxwell to “conceal” her
involvement in the other offenses charged in the superseding indictment. First, the alleged false
deposition statements would have no probative value as evidence of concealment unless the
government could establish that the statements were, in fact, false — an allegation that Ms.
Maxwell vigorously disputes. As the Court noted in its severance opinion, the issue of whether
the deposition statements were false or truthful, as Ms. Maxwell maintains, is “a critical element
of the perjury counts” that would need to be resolved by the jury. 4/16/2021 Op. and Order (Dkt.
207) at 24. The government therefore could not introduce Ms. Maxwell’s deposition statements
as evidence of concealment without litigating the core factual and legal issues at the heart of the
perjury counts. Allowing the government to do so would entirely defeat the purpose of severing
the perjury counts in the first place.
