The Court: Should Exclude Evidence Related to the Perjury Counts and Redact

Consistent with its prior ruling, the Court should exclude any evidenee related to the:
severed perjury counts to. prove a purported attempt by Ms. Maxwell to “conecal” her
involvement in,the other offenses charged in the superseding. indictment. ‘First, the alleged. false
deposition statements, would have no probative valuc.as evidence of conecalment. unless the
government could establish.that.the statementswere, in fact,, false — an allegation.that.Ms.
Maxwell, vigorously. disputes., As the Court noted.in, its severance opinion, the issue of whether
the deposition statements were: false. or truthful, as Ms. Maxwell maintains, is “a critical elerient’
‘of the perjury counts” that would.necd to be resolved. by the jury. 4/16/2021, Op. and.Order (Dkt.
207) 'at 24. The government therefore could;not introduce Ms. Maxwell’s. deposition ‘statements
as evidence. of concealment without litigating ‘the, core. factual and Icgal issucs atthe heart’ of the
perjury counts. Allowing the government'to do so would entirely defcat'the purpose of severing

‘the ‘perjury counts inthe first place’.
