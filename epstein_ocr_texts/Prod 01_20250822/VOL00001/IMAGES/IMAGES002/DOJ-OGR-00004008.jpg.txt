Requests themselves. Resp. Lir. at 7. In Requests 3 through 5, the Defendant seeks al/
communications between. BSF and its co-counsel in.a civil litigation against, Maxwell. (Ginffie v.
Maxwell, 15-ev-07433-LAP) “between 2015 and the date of this subpoena about any meeting with
the United States Attorney concerning Ghislaine Maxwell or[7——SS—S—=id-””- Certainly, some
of these communications, if they cxist, may ‘fall under the work, product umbrella if they were
internal discussions with.co-counscl. Morcover, BSF and its :co-counscl, have a common. interest:
protection in theit communications. The Defendant’s overbroad Requests make: it impossible for
BSF to determine how: many: responsive communications would be protected and why. Again, it
is the Defendant’s burden to demonstrate that. all of the communications she: secks would be
relevant and admissible,.and it:is not BSF’s burden to review. broad:swaths of material to determine

what the Defendant is entitled. to under Rule 17.

Cc. Communications Between BSF ‘and. the Government: Are Procurable from’ the
Government.

Even if Requests | through 5 could overcome Nixon’s three hurdles, however, Requests ‘1
and. 2 would. still fail to the extent, that, they ask for. communications with the Government, which.
the Defendant can procure from the Government. The Defendant admits. that the Government has
the communications she is seeking, but.complains that the Government “has failed to produce, or
even look for these communications and.Ms. Maxwell has no other means'to obtain them.” Resp.
Ltr. at 8. Infact, this dispute is currently pending before'the Court—the Defendant filed a Motion
for a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures in which she seeks an, order compelling the
Government to disclose the very communications. with BSF she secks in the Subpocna and. to
immediately disclose all. Brady and Giglio materials. ECF Nos. 148, 148-5 (motion requesting

documents relating to the Defendant’s two motions to suppress evidenee obtained from what.
