Requests themselves. Resp. Ltr. at 7. In Requests 3 through 5, the Defendant seeks all
communications between BSF and its co-counsel in a civil litigation against Maxwell (Giuffre v.
Maxwell, 15-cv-07433-LAP) “between 2015 and the date of this subpoena about any meeting with

of these communications, if they exist, may fall under the work product umbrella if they were
internal discussions with co-counsel. Moreover, BSF and its co-counsel have a common interest

what the Defendant is entitled to under Rule 17.

the Defendant can procure from the Government. The Defendant admits that the Government has
the communications she is seeking, but complains that the Government “has failed to produce, or
even look for these communications and Ms. Maxwell has no other means to obtain them.” Resp.
Ltr. at 8. In fact, this dispute is currently pending before the Court—the Defendant filed a Motion
for a Bill of Particulars and Pretrial Disclosures in which she seeks an order compelling the
Government to disclose the very communications with BSF she seeks in the Subpoena and to
immediately disclose all Brady and Giglio materials. ECF Nos. 148, 148-5 (motion requesting
