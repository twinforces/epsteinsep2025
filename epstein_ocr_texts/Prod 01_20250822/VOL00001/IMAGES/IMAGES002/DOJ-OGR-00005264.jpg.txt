Re:  United.States’v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr.'330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits its motions in, limine, which, the Government, is
submitting to the Court under seal by email with proposed redactions. The Government’s proposed.
redactions are consistent with the: three-part. test. articulated. by the Second ‘Circuit in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d_1,10. (2d, Cir. 2006): Although. the Government’s motions in
limine ate judicial documents, subject’ to the eommon..law ‘presumption. of acecss, the proposed
redactions are narrowly tailored to protect'the privacy interests of victims—including-victims who
have not. identified themselves on. the record in, this case and who have not: publicly. tdentified
themselves.as victims referenced.in the Indictment in-this casc—and third parties referenced in.the
document.

In addition, the Government sccks redaction of Séction X at least until the conclusion. of
trial. Additional justification. for this. scaling request is located in footnote 11 on page 49 of the

Government’s ‘motions in. imine:
