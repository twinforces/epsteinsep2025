Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits its motions in limine, which the Government is
submitting to the Court under seal by email with proposed redactions. The Government’s proposed
redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although the Government’s motions in
limine are judicial documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the proposed
redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of victims—including victims who
have not identified themselves on the record in this case and who have not publicly identified
themselves as victims referenced in the Indictment in this case—and third parties referenced in the
document.

In addition, the Government seeks redaction of Section X at least until the conclusion of
trial. Additional justification for this sealing request is located in footnote 11 on page 49 of the
Government’s motions in limine.
