search, warrant was executed. on that property, the computer cquipment associated with. those
cameras had. been removed. Villafafia,.knew who had, possession, of the computer ‘equipment.
Surveillance images might have shown ‘the ‘victims’ ‘visits, and photographic. cvidence of. their
Appearaiice. at the time. of their encounters with Epstein could have countered the anticipated
argument ‘that Epstein ‘was. unaware these girls were minors. The surveillance: vidco might have
shown additional victims the investigators had. not. yct identified, Such. i images could have been,
powerful visual evidence of the ‘large number of girls Epsteinvictimized.and the frequency of their
visits to his home; ‘potentially: persuasive proof toa. jury that. this, was not a ‘simple “solicitation”

case.

to record his sexual: encounters, and one victim ‘told avents that Epstein’ 'S assistani-photovraphed
her in’the nude. Based on. this evidence, and experience in. other sex cases involving minors,
Villafafia and several other witnesses opined. to OPR. that the computers might have contained
child pornography. Morcover, Epstein. lived a multi-state: lifestyle; it was reasonable'to assume
that he:may have transmitted, still images or videos taken at/his Florida residence over the internet.
to be accessed while at one of his other homes or while traveling: The interstate transmission, of
child pornography was.a,scparate, and. scrious, federal crime that.could have changed. the entire
complexion of the case against Epstein. 33. Villafafia told OPR, “[I]fthe evidence kad been. What’
we suspected. it was . . . [i]t would have put this case completely to bed. It also would. have:
completely defeated all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”

Because she recognized the:potential significance of this evidence, Villafana attempted to
obtain. the missing computers. After Villafafa lcarned that an, individual associated with. oné of
Epstcin’s attorneys had. possession. of the computer equipment that was removed from Epstcin’s
home, 'she consulted with Department subject matter experts to determine how best to: obtain the
evidence. Following the: advice 'she ‘received and after notifying her supervisors, Villafatia. took:
legal steps to obtain the computer equipment.

Epstein’s. team. sought to postpone compliance with the USAO"’s demand for the:
equipment. In‘late June 2007, defense-attorncy Sanchez, requested an extension of time:to: comply;
in. informing Sloman, Menchel, and ‘Lourie: of the request, Villafafia stressed that “we want to get.
the computer equipment that was removed from Epstcin’s home prior to the state scarch, warrant:
as Soon as possible.” She,agreed to cxtend the date ‘for producing the coniputer.cquipment by onc
week. until July 17, 2007. ‘On. that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the :computer
‘equipment. That’ litigation, was still. pending at the: end. of July, when _ Acosta. decided to resolve

283 18-U.S.C- § 2251 (a) provides, in, pertinent parts,
