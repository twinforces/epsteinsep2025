prosccutors. As the Court has explained above, this is:consistent with the Second. Circuit’s
Statement, that.a protective order “provides no guarantee that, [evidence] will not.somchow find,
its. way into the government’s hands for. use in.a. subsequent criminal prosecution.” Andover, 876
F.2d at 1083. Judge McMahon further reasoned that Maxwell could, only have:reasonably relicd
on the protective. order insofar as it prohibited. BSF ‘from fomenting an. investigation. against her
with confidential documents. If Judge MeMahon-had known of the: 201.6 meeting, it is:
arguable=albeit-far from, certain=that.she might have instead:concluded that: BSF breached.
Maxwell’s reasonable reliance interests.

But.Judge’ McMahon also held that the Government had. shown extraordinary
circumstances justifying éx parte modification. of the-protéctive order. She observed that
modification. of the:protective order would serve a “significant public interest” and.that the:
Government had,demonstrated good cause to obtain the sought.materials through a grand jury:
subpocna without alerting potential targets of its, criminal investigation. Extraordinary
circumstances or compelling nced provide:a sufficient, independent basis to modify a protective
order under Martinde/l notwithstanding the parties” reasonable ‘reliance on, that: order: See
Minpeco S.A. v: Conticommodity Servs., Inc.,. 832. F.2d.739, 742 (2d Cir. 1987) (citing

Martindell, 594: F.2d at.296). Thus, even assuming that the Government should.have told Judge

material to her analysis of Maxwell’s reasonable reliance on the protective order, Judge
McMahon would still have granted;the Government?s application. ‘Because the Government’s
alleged misrepresentation Was not necessary’to Judge McMahon’s ruling, it cannot. support

suppression under franks.
