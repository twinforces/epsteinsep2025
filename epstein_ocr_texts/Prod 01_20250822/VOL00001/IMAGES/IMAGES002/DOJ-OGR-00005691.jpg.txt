Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 388 Filed 10/29/21 Page 4of14

Ghislaine Maxwell respectfully moves iin. limine, pursuant.to United States v. Al-Sudawi,
432 F.3d 419 (2d. Cir. 2005) and, Federal Rule of Evidence 403, to exclude évidencc:of Ms.
Maxwell’s supposed “flight” following the arrest.of Jeffrey Epstein and to preclude the:
government; from arguing to 'the jury that Ms. Maxwell was hiding from, or evading law

period. is proof of ‘consciousness of guilt.

As Ms. Maxwell explained in her bail applications, her decision to remove herself from.
public view after Epstein’s arrest.was emphatically for for the purpose of evading detection by
law enforcement, but: instead was an. cffort to protect-herself'and-her. family members from an.
onslaught of intrusive media attention, and threats of physical violence. Ms. Maxwell’s‘position,
Maxwell's security: guard'who explained the circumstances of her arrest. Furthermore, Ms.
Maxwell remained. in the United States continuously-after Epstcin’s arrest, was:in regular. contact
with the prosecutors through her attorneys, and. never once demonstrated. an intent to flee the
country. The government has ‘not established, and/will not be. able to establish at trial, a
sufficient factual. predicate.of flight from which. the jury can infer consciousness of guilt under
controlling precedent. See Al-Sudawi, 432 F.3d ‘at 424-25. Allowing the government;to
introduce cvidenec of MS. Maxwell’s actions prior to, and at the time. of, her arrest to ‘prove
consciousness of guilt would mislead the jury and’would invite them, to draw: speculative and
unsupported inferences in the face of contrary’ factual evidence. Such evidence, and argument.

would be unfairly prejudicial ‘to Ms. Maxwell and ‘would, lead'to a:mini trial on the issuc of flight
