The decision.not'to inform. victims and their. attorneys about the existence of the NPA gave
victims and.the:public-the:misimpression, that the government‘had colluded with’Epstcin’s counsel
to keep the agreement secret from the: victims. Morcover, ‘the lack of openness about 'the NPA,
gave the impression that:the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in. resolving the matter and
‘undercut' ‘public. confidence inthe legitimacy of the resulting;plea agreement. The overall.result of

Although ‘OPR ‘credits Villafafia’ S statements ‘that ‘she ‘wanted to go ‘beyond her obligations i in
dealing ‘with ‘victims, the end. result ‘nonetheless ‘was that communications with ‘victims were not-
‘prioritized by the USAO. In part.this was duc to the fact that interactions with victims are generally
handled by: staff in the USAO and the EBI who are trained and. have expertise in. dealing with.
victims and. other witnesses. However, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also
contributed to the ‘problems. The government, as it ultimately acknowledged ‘in, the CVRA.
litigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and_unified,
fashion.

OPR. recognizes that the: Epstein :investigation occurred. soon after ‘the passage of the
CVRA. Inthe ycars'since, the Department’s prosecutors and.personnel’have become more familiar

inconsistent.and confusing communications from the separate’ cntitics. In certain cases, such as the
Epstein, ‘casc, prosecutors may’ nced to provide more. oversight. when, multiple, ‘Dépaitment
components are communicating with victims to avoid providing :confusing and contradictory
