grooming and the prevention of future abuse (by perhaps a comparison with
a no treatment contro). Another important issue is to investigate what sort
of training programs or materials need to be developed so that a wide vari-
ety of professionals can faithfully implement the definition and proposed
assessment methods.

CONCLUSIONS

Currently there is no consensus regarding how to define grooming. In addi-
tion, there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or
is occurring. The field possesses an insufficient amount of knowledge about
key issues such as the interrater reliability of these judgments or the error
rates of these judgments including the frequency of false negatives or false
positives. Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that
ought to be used in forensic settings as it does not meet some of the cri-
teria in the Daubert standard. The Daubert standard indicates that in court
an expert witness may only testify if (a) “the expert’s scientific, technical,
or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the
evidence or to determine a fact in issue; (b) the testimony is based on suffi-
cient facts or data; (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and
methods; and (d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and meth-
ods to the facts of the case” (Rule 702: Testimony by expert witness). Right
now it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles and
methods” to define and detect grooming.

We propose a definition of grooming that involves two parts: (a) inap-
propriate behavior on the part of the adult and (b) sound arguments that this
inappropriate behavior functions to increase the probability of future sexual
abuse. We then provide exemplars of this kind of inappropriate behavior.
Future research on grooming would be more useful to the field if data were
collected using a single, clear definition such as the one we have proposed.
This would provide a basis for data to be easily aggregated and better under-
stood, which could lead to the admissibility of grooming evidence in forensic
settings. Furthermore, we are currently working to develop valid psycho-
metric instruments with known reliability and validity to assess grooming
according to this standard.
