As the Court is aware, the charges in this case arose from an investigation opened in 2018
and conducted by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York
(“SDNY”), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) New York Office, and the New York
Police Department (“NYPD”; collectively, the “Prosecution Team”). (Dkt. No. 63 at 1). The
Government has obtained the full investigative file from the FBI’s Palm Beach Resident Agency
(the “FBI Florida Office”), which conducted a separate investigation and prosecution of Jeffrey
Epstein between 2005 and 2010 (the “FBI Florida File”), and whose file also contained the
investigative file for the Palm Beach Police Department (“PBPD”) related to that same
investigation (the “Florida Investigation”). The Government has reviewed and produced all Rule
16 materials, including potential Brady material, contained within the Prosecution Team’s Files,
including the FBI Florida File and the PBPD file. The Government has not identified anything
within the files of the Prosecution Team, the FBI Florida File, or the PBPD file that constitutes
Brady material with respect to the NPA.

C. The Government’s Collection and Review of Other Agencies’ Files

On October 7, 2020, the Government submitted a letter to the Court setting forth its plan

(Dkt. No. 63). Although Second Circuit law did not require the Government to do so because
those other agencies were not part of the Prosecution Team, the Government endeavored to collect
and review certain of those materials as part of its commitment to go above and beyond its
disclosure obligations. (/d. at 4). In particular, the Government noted its intention to collect: (1)
