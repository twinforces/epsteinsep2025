Prospective jurors may also have a strong reaction to the sensitive nature of the charges
and some of the evidence that to be adduced at trial. Epstein’s arrests and prior conviction for
sexual misconduct, allegations of his sexual misconduct of minors over the course of two

Maxwell’s upcoming trial.

The standard voir dire typically conducted by the Court is insufficient for this case and
will be redundant to questions posed in the proposed jury questionnaire. A written questionnaire
coupled with sequestered voir dire of individual prospective jurors and limited open-ended
questioning by counsel will assist the Court and parties in determining whether prospective
jurors have developed prejudicial preconceptions regarding this case, Ms. Maxwell, and Epstein
due to this intense media coverage and pretrial publications and broadcasts.
