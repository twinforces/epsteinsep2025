Williams, 467 U.S. 431,446 (1984); United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922 (1984). The Court.
agrees that, at the very least, the cxception to the exclusionary rule for inevitable discovery
applics to the documents. that have since been. unsealed and. made public in.the:civil case. But
because the Court: finds. no violation of the Fourth Amendment, it-concludes that none of the:
documents should be suppressed.

sanction, for governmental misconduct. She contends that:cven an inadvertent misstatement:to, a
court requires suppression-of evidence obtained as.a result. She further secks:an evidentiary
hearing to explore whether any-misrepresentation. by. the Government in that, hearing was
intentional.

The Supreme Court has recognized:that. federal courts have:a limited ‘inherent authority-to

also cautioned that: courts must ‘exercise this power with restraint. Jd. Thus, “the court should
not exercise its inherent or supervisory: power ‘as a substitute. for Fourth Amendment
jurisprudence.”” United States v..Lambus, 897 F.3d.368, 401 (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting United
