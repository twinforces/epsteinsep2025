L4N3MAXC Arraignment

1 reiterate, federal law prohibits the recording or

2 rebroadcasting of this proceeding. Failure to comply could

3 result in being held in contempt of court.

4 The third preliminary matter, this is our first

5 conference since Congress amended Federal Rule of Criminal

6 Procedure 5(f). Pursuant to that amendment, I am required at
7 this conference to remind the prosecution of its obligation

8 under Brady v. Maryland and related cases to disclose to the

9 defense all information, whether admissible or not, that is

10 favorable to the defendant, material either to guilt or to

11 punishment, and known to the prosecution. The prosecution must
12 make good-faith efforts to disclose such information to the

13 defense as soon as reasonably possible. Failure to do so may
14 result in any number of consequences including a continuance,
15 sanctions, dismissal, or vacatur of a conviction.

16 I have entered a written order describing more fully
17 these obligations and the possible consequences of failing to
18 meet them, and I direct the prosecution to review and comply
19 with that order.
20 Ms. Comey, does the prosecution confirm that it
21 understands its obligations and either has fulfilled or will
22 fulfill them?
23 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: With that I'll turn to the arraignment.
25 Ms. Maxwell, have you received a copy of the S2, the
