and:must “do so at least 14 days before trial unless the court, for.good cause, sets'a different'time.”
Fed. R. Evid. 412(c)(1)(B) (emphasis added). This language plainly gives the: Court authority: to
seta “different” time; not. necessarily a “later” time, to, require the defense to file a Rule 412
motion. See, e.g:, Order, United States v..Andrews,.No. 19 Cr..13'1 (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 29, 2020)
(Dkt. No; 287) (setting a Rule 412.deadline of February 13,2020, fora March 9, 2020 trial); Order,
United States vy. Rivera, No. 19 Gr. 131 (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2020) (Dkt. No. 384). (setting a.
Rule:4.12. deadline of October 15, 2020, for a November.9, 2020 trial); United States v. Dupigny,
18 Cr. 528 (JMF) (S.D-NVY. Oct. 23, 2019) (Dkt. No. 202) (requiring a “finalized proffer of
evidence” ‘the defense sought to admit under Rule 412 by December 6, 2019, in advarice of a
January 13, 2020 trial); Wnited States v. Backman, 817 F.3d 662, 669-70 (9th. Cir. 2016)
(concluding that district court did not abuse its diserction when sctting Rule 41.2 deadline more
than. 14 days before trial.and denying request to:amend.the motion less than 14 days before trial);
United States v. Valenzuela, No. Cr. 07-11,2008 WL 2824958, at, #4 n.12 (C.D. Cal. July 21,
2008) (Good, causé cxists to advance the deadline for filing a Rule: 412(c):motion by cleven. days
‘given'the complex nature of the action and the:volume of evidence that will. likely be presented.at
trial.”); see also Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, 23 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid. § 5377 (2d.
ed. 2020) (explaining that the text of Rule 412(c)(1)(B) “suggests that the court might.require'that.
the motion,be filed carlicr than, 14 days before:trial or might permit the:motion to be brought later,
including during trial.”). Accordingly, the:Government respectfully: submits that the express terms
of Rule 412 contemplate that the Court:can.sct an.carlicr bricfing schedule.

A deadline more than two wecks in advance of trial is consistent:with the’ Rule’s procedural
requirements. Before admitting evidence under Rule 412, the Court “must conduct, an ‘in Camera

hearing and give the victim and parties a right to attend.and be heard.” Fed. R. Evid. 4.12(c)(2).
