Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 315 _ Filed 07/30/21 Page3of3
provides illustrative examples of statements that “presumptively involve a substantial likelihood
that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise prejudice the due
administration of justice within the meaning of the rule.” S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23(d).

Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated with the pending case are now
clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the purview of Local Criminal Rule 23.1. Indeed,
the above concerns do not apply only to Mr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that
“counsel[,] agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses” must take care to “protect
the Defendant’s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury.” Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant
that criminal matters heading toward trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All
those associated with this case must act to ensure the case is tried solely in court or else they risk
being deemed responsible for any trial delay or for undermining the integrity of the upcoming
trial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.1(h). In addition to the impact it could have on this
matter, failure to comply could also result in attorney discipline. /d. Rule 23.1(i).

SO ORDERED.
