in her view, the Government did not satisfy the requirements of Martindell, its attempt to modify
the protective order violated her due process rights. And because, she alleges, the Government
misrepresented facts to Judge McMahon, this Court should exercise its inherent authority to
suppress evidence as a sanction for governmental misconduct.

The Court is not persuaded. For the reasons set forth above, the Government’s
application for modification of the protective order did not violate Maxwell’s due process rights.
Due process does not categorically bar an ex parte modification to a protective order, and Judge
McMahon found that the Government had shown extraordinary circumstances to do so. To the
extent Maxwell seeks suppression based on an alleged misrepresentation to Judge McMahon, for
the reasons set forth above, she has not met the high bar for a due process violation or made the
required showing under Franks that would entitle her to an evidentiary hearing. Whether
Maxwell advances these arguments under Martindell or directly under due process, they do not
support suppression.
