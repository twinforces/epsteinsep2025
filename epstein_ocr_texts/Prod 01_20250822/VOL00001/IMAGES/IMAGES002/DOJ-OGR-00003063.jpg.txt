Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204. Filed 04/16/21 Page 129 of 239

Contrary tothe defendant’s argument (Def. Mot. 11 at 16), this ‘case is distinguishable from
United States ¥. Oshat=, 700 F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y.'1988). There, the defendant had. already been
indicted at the time: of: his. deposition. in a civil. case, “was reluctant. to be deposed. because of the:
pending indictment, and, he agreed. only’ after the partics. in the: civil, case, ‘stipulated that ‘the:
deposition would be sealed.” /d/. at 699-700. The court found that'the subpoenas for the deposition,
transcript were “unenforecable” because the “government has not argued that the protective order
‘was improvidently granted or that:there are some extraordinary circumstances, or:compelling necd,
in-view of the holding:in. Martindell.”? Td: at 701. The court found that.the protective-order served

described in Martindell, as the defendant. had already. been indicted at. the
tine of his deposition in a.civil case for almost :scven months; the défendant “consistently resisted,
the use.of his testimony :in the criminal.action. against him”; and the Government did not.seck the
deposition “to aid it‘in.a, criminal, investigation or grand. jury proceeding.” Jd: at: 700; see also
Botha». Don King Productions, Inc., Nd. 97 Civ. 7587 (JGK), 1998 WL 88745 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.
27, 1998) (noting importance of policy concerns of Martindell where Government ‘obtained. an,
indictment. against. witness “long before his deposition in. the civil action” ‘and. where federal
criminal. case remains pending after civil. action.:is resolved). Here, by contrast, Chief Judge:
McMahon, found that the “Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary
circumstances, which would entitle it to modification in any event.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22).
As she noted. in her opinion, the ‘situation. was distinct from Oshatz “where the Government was
trolling for evidence to use at a. trial, rather than sccking information as part of a, criminal,
investigation or grand jury proceeding.” (/d. at 24-25). As, Chief Judge McMahon alrcady

concluded, Oshaiz does not'warrant a. different result here.

Amendment. issués raised, by the:parties.”- Martindell, 594 F.2d at.297.
