Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 129 of 239

Contrary to the defendant’s argument (Def. Mot. 11 at 16), this case is distinguishable from
United States v. Oshatz, 700 F. Supp. 696 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). There, the defendant had already been
indicted at the time of his deposition in a civil case, “was reluctant to be deposed because of the
pending indictment, and he agreed only after the parties in the civil case stipulated that the
deposition would be sealed.” /d. at 699-700. The court found that the subpoenas for the deposition
transcript were “unenforceable” because the “government has not argued that the protective order
was improvidently granted or that there are some extraordinary circumstances or compelling need,
in view of the holding in Martindell.”* Id. at 701. The court found that the protective order served
the “‘vital function’” described in Martindell, as the defendant had already been indicted at the
time of his deposition in a civil case for almost seven months; the defendant “consistently resisted
the use of his testimony in the criminal action against him”; and the Government did not seek the
deposition “to aid it in a criminal investigation or grand jury proceeding.” Jd. at 700; see also
Botha v. Don King Productions, Inc., No. 97 Civ. 7587 (JGK), 1998 WL 88745 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.
27, 1998) (noting importance of policy concerns of Martindell where Government obtained an
indictment against witness “long before his deposition in the civil action” and where federal
criminal case remains pending after civil action is resolved). Here, by contrast, Chief Judge
McMahon found that the “Government has persuasively demonstrated extraordinary
circumstances, which would entitle it to modification in any event.” (Def. Mot. 3, Ex. G at 22).
As she noted in her opinion, the situation was distinct from Oshatz “where the Government was
trolling for evidence to use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal
investigation or grand jury proceeding.” (/d. at 24-25). As Chief Judge McMahon already
concluded, Oshatz does not warrant a different result here.
‘3 In Martindell, the Second Circuit explicitly deemed it “unnecessary for us to decide the Fifth
Amendment issues raised by the parties.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 297.
