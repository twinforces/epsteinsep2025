when prosecutors have ‘uscd third parties as leverage: in plea negotiations. Numerous courts have
made clear, however, that a plea ‘is ‘not ‘invalid ‘when. entered under an ‘agreement that ‘ineludes a.
promise of Icniency towards a third party or‘in response to a prosccutor’s threat to prosecute'a.third
party if-a plea is not'cntered. See, e.g., Winited States ¥. Marquez, 909: F.2d 738, 741-42 (2d Cir.
1990) (rejecting claim that plea ‘was involuntary: because of pressure Placed upon.a defendant ‘by
aed guilty); “Mar lin V. “Kemp, 760 F. 2d, 1244, 1248 é Ith, Cir. 1985), (in order to satisfy, “heavy
burden” of establishing'that the government.had not acted. “in good. faith,” a defendant challenging
voluntariness of his plea on grounds that, the prosecutor had, threatened, to bring charges against.
the defendant’s pregnant wife had to establish. that government lacked. probable cause to belicve:
the defendant’s wife had committed a crime at the:time it: threatened to charge her); Stinson v.

State, 839 So, 2d.906, 909. (Fla. App: 2003) (“In cases *s involving . a promise ‘not to prosecute ‘a.
third. party, the g government must act in. good ‘faith . ... [and] must. have probable cause 'to charge
the third. party.”).

The second. context: concerns situations in. which courts have enforced prosecutors’
promises of leniency to third parties. ‘For example, in.Stafe v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d 944 (Fla. App.
1.997), .as consideration, for'the defendant’s guilty plea, the prosecutor agreed and, announeed. in,
open court that the: government ‘would dismiss charges against‘the defendant’s ‘nicce and nephew,
who had all been, charged as.a result of the. same incident. When the state reneged and attempted
to prosecute the niece and nephew, the trial. court dismissed the charges against them, and.the:state
appealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law
principles, the nicee and ‘nephew were third-party. beneficiarics of the plea agreement and were
therefore entitled to enforce it.

Apart from. -voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts -have not. suggested. that a
prosccutor’s promise: not: to prosecute a, third. party amounts to an, inappropriate exercise of
prosecutorial diseretion.
