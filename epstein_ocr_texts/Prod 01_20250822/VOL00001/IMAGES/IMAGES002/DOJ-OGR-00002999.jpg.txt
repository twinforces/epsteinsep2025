Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 65 of 239
broad definition, courts have held that Section 3283 “does not require that an offense consist of a
sexual act between a defendant and a specific child,” Vickers, 2014 WL 1838255, at *11, but
instead reaches offenses involving the transportation of minors to engage in illegal sexual activity.
See Sensi, 2010 WL 2351484, at *2-3 (collecting cases interpreting the term “sexual abuse” to
encompass “all crimes that would logically relate to the common understanding of sexual abuse
even when found in chapters 110 (‘Sexual Exploitation and Other Abuse of Children’) and 117
(‘Transportation of Illegal Sexual Activity and Related Crimes’) of title 18”); Schneider, 801 F.3d
at 196-97 (holding that Section 3283 applied to defendant convicted of traveling with the purpose
of engaging in sex with a minor victim, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b)); Vickers, 2014 WL
1838255, at *11-12 (holding that violations of 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) were crimes involving sexual
abuse under Section 3283).

The defendant’s motion does not engage with these authorities at all. Instead, the defendant
asks the Court to apply an “essential ingredients” test, relying heavily upon the Supreme Court’s
decision in Bridges v. United States, 346 U.S. 209 (1953), which concerned the Wartime
Suspension of Limitations Act (“WSLA”). (Def. Mot. 2 at 12-14). But Bridges is inapposite,
since it concerned a statute “[t]he legislative history of [which] emphasize[d] the propriety of its
conservative interpretation” and “indicate[d] a purpose to suspend the general statute of limitations
only as to” certain narrowly defined offenses. Bridges, 346 U.S. at 216. There is no corresponding
indication that Congress intended the “essential ingredients” test to apply to Section 3283. As the
Third Circuit has explained in rejecting an identical argument:

While Bridges did adopt an “essential ingredient” test, the
limitations-extending statute at issue was a narrowly drafted
exception specifically intended to target frauds related to war
procurement. Unlike the WSLA, § 3283 has no such restrictive
language or legislative history suggesting congressional intent to
limit its application to a specific subset of circumstances. Congress,
