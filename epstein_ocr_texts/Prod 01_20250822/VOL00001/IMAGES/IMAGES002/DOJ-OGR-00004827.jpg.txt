Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 310-1 Filed 07/02/21 Page 15 of 80

At deposition, Cosby testified that he developed a romantic interest in Constand
as soon as he met her, but did not reveal his feelings. He acknowledged that he always
initiated the in-person meetings and visits to his home. He also stated that he engaged
in consensual sexual activity with Constand on three occasions, including the January
2004 incident.

Throughout the depositions, Cosby identified the pills that he provided to Constand
