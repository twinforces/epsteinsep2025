IV. The perjury charges are legally tenable
her answers to’ questions in,a. deposition in a civil case. She contends that these charges are
legally: deficient because the questions posed were fundamentally ambiguous and the questions
‘were not-matcrial to the subject of the deposition. The Court concludes that the charges are
legally tenable.and Maxwell’s defenses are appropriately left to the jury.

The applicable perjury statute imposes criminal penaltics on anyone who “in any
proceeding before or ancillary to any court... knowingly makes any:false material. declaration.”

proceédiiig in Which the defendant offered it.

A. ‘The questions posed. were not too ambiguous to support a perjury: charge

The requirement of knowing falsity. requires that a witness believe that their testimony is
false. United States vy. Lighte, 782. F.2d 367, 372: (2d Cir. 1986). As.a general matter, “[a] jury is
best. equipped to determine the ‘meaning that.a, defendant assigns to a:specific question.” /d.
Courts have acknowledged.a narrow exception for questions that are so fundamentally
ambiguous or. imprecise that. the answer to them. cannot legally’be false. Jd. at. 372,375; seealso
United States v., Wolfson, 437 F.2d, 862, 878 (2d Cir. 1970). A question is fundamentally
ambiguous only if reasonable people. could not agree. on. its meaning in, context: Light, 782 F.2d
at 375. The existence of some arguable ambiguity docs not foreclose a perjury:charge: against a

‘witness ‘who understood the question.
