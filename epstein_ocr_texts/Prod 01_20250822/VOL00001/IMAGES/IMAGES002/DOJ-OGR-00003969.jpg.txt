Ogiins, 921 F.2d.442, 447 (2d Cir. 1990) (The government bears the burden of proving that
the taint [of an.illegal.search] has been.alleviated.”)). Like a-Kustigar hearing, “the
government: bears ‘the heavy burden of proving that all of the evidence it:proposes to use was
derived from légitimate. independent sources.’” See Wnited States, Vv. Allen, 864 F.3d 63, 91. (2d
Cir. 2017) (quoting Kastigar y. Wnited States, 406 U.S. 441, 453, 461-62 (1972) (holding that
‘use and derivative use immunity provides protection “from.the‘use of compelled testimony, as
well.as ‘evidence derived. dircetly.and indirectly therefrom,” and reversing conviction for Fifth.
Amendment violation)). “[C]onelusory. denials [of taint] arc: insufficient as a mattcr of law to
sustain the prosccution’s burden. of proof.”./d. at 94.

The government’s April. 21 letter, with-its vague and conclusory assurances, thus
offers no reason to postpone consideration of. Ms. Maxwell’s motions to ‘suppress.

The government's purported rescrvation.of rights is also ‘without merit. Initially; it is
not at,all clear what the government means when.it says it might “use relevant materials from
this set for any purpose permissible under the Rules of Evidence.” (Dkt. No. 227, p 2). But if
the government means that :it-intends to use the suppression:matcrial. for impeachment
purposes, that is all the more: reason. to hold an evidentiary hearing now and to resolve Ms.
Maxwell’s ‘motions before trial on the non-perjury’ counts..

There are at.least'two reasons why. First, while:the constitution in certain.
circumstances ‘allows the government. to use unconstitutionally-obtained evidence for.
impeachment. purposes, e.g., Harris 1. New York, 401 U.S. 222, 223-24 (1971) (statements
secured in violation of Miranda are admissible for impeachment, purposcs if voluntary), the
constitution forbids admission of evidence for a/l purposes ifthe government’s. conduct

violated due:process, ¢.g.,.New Jersey v..Portash, 440 U.S. 450,459 (1.979) (due:process:
