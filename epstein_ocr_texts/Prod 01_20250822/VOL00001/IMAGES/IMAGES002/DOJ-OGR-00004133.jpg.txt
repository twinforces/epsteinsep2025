After reviewing the defense’s letter and exhibits, the Government respectfully submits that

Exhibits A and B should be filed under seal. This proposal is consistent with the three-part test
articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.
2006). Although the defense’s letter and exhibits are judicial documents subject to the common
law presumption of access, sealing the exhibits—each of which is only one page—is narrowly
tailored to protect the privacy interests of a victim and third party implicated in the documents.
The Court has accepted other exhibits under seal or in redacted form in this case to protect such
privacy interests. (See, e.g., Dkt. No. 168, 232).

Respectfully submitted,

AUDREY STRAUSS
