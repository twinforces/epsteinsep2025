Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document285 Filed 05/20/21 Page 14 of 34

But in her 2021 interview, AUSA gg mostly disclaimed a memory of what happened
in 2016. Ex. K. The phrases “does not recall,” “does not remember,” or some similar expression
of lack of memory appear at least thirty-two times in the notes of the government’s 2021 call
with AUSA x. Jd.

Many of AUSA J disclaimers, however, are simply not credible. For example,
AUSA | claimed not to “have an independent memory of the Giuffre v. Maxwell
[defamation] lawsuit being mentioned” during the meeting, id. at 1, even though her notes are
replete with references to the lawsuit, Ex. J. After reviewing her notes, AUSA ggg denied
that they refreshed her memory. Ex. K, p 1.

AUSA J similarly denied remembering whether Giuffre’s attorneys ever provided
her with documents, id. at 6, despite the email from Peter Skinner just hours after the February
29 meeting providing AUSA ggg with numerous documents, Ex. L, p 1-2, and despite the
fact that AUSA [J in 2018 personally delivered those documents to AUSA 3x
AUSA J. and one member of the prosecution team in this case, Ex. N, p 1 (12/6/2018
Email to AUSA J: “Just went through my files and found a folder w/ the notes I took
and the documents they brought me. Want to come by?”).

When AUSA id claim to remember what transpired, her memory was often
inconsistent with the contemporaneous evidence. Take just one example. “To [her] knowledge,”
AUSA [J said, she did “not receive[] any discovery materials from any civil case.” Ex. K, p
6. That is not correct. The government admits that AUSA J received from Giuffre’s
attorneys, and turned over to AUSA | and others in the office, including flight records
and Palm Beach Police Department Records. Resp. at 66 & n.2. Both of these documents were
produced in discovery in the civil case.
