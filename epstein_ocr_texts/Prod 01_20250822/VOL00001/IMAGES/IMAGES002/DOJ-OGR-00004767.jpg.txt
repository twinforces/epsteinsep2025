1 The fact that you haven't been out for a year is a

2 result of the pandemic. Nobody's been out for a year.

3 Nobody's had visitors. People have gotten locked up all over

4 the country in the SHU when they've gotten sick, and you had

5 the great misfortune to not only to get Covid but to get Covid
6 in the earliest days, when we didn't know what we were doing.

7 And that being so, I think you've suffered triply as a result.
8 But there is no excuse for the conditions in those two
9 institutions. There is no excuse for the serial leadership

10 that does not allow the office of warden to take control and

11 get control of those facilities, that they just cycle through,
12 most of them at the end of their careers, and it is unfair and
13 unjust. You shouldn't have to suffer for the incompetence of
14 the United States Department of Justice and its subsidiary

15 agency, the Bureau of Prisons.

16 I will do what I can to bring your situation to the

17 people who, if they give a damn, might do something.

18 You have committed a serious crime under circumstances
19 that were particularly difficult for me to swallow what was
20 done and everything, but I am convinced that no good would be
21 served by keeping you incarcerated for one minute more than I
22 am required to do by law. And so I conclude that a mandatory
23 minimum sentence of 60 months is hardly any different from the
24 guidelines lower end sentence of 63 months. It is sufficient
25 but not greater than necessary to punish you for your sins.
