The fact that you, haven't béén otit for a ‘year is, 4
result. of the pandemic. Nobody's. been. ‘out for a year,
Nobody's had wisitors.  Péoplé have gotten, locked up all over
the country in the SHU when they've getten sick, and you had
the gréat misfortune to not only to get Covid but to get Covid
in. the earliest days,. when. we didn't know what we! were doing,,
And, that! béing so, I think, you've suffered triply ds a result.

But there is mo excuse for the conditions in those two
institutions. There is no excuse for ‘the serial leadership
that does not. allow the office of warden to take control and
get control of thdése facilitiés, that. they just cyéle throéugh,
most of them at the end of their careers, and it is unfair and
unjust. You shouldn't have to suffer for the ihcémpetence of
the United States Department of Justice and, its subsidiary
agency, the Buréau of Prisons.

I will do what I, can to bring youn situation to the
peoplé who, if they give a damn, might do something.

you have committed a Serious crime under circumstances
that were particularly difficult for mé t6 Swallow what was
done and everything, but I am convinced, that no good would be
served by keeping you incarcerated for oné minute more than I
am required to do by law. And so I conclude that a mandatory

minimum séntence 6f 60 months is Hardly any different from the

guidelines lower end sentence of 63 months. It is sufficient,

but not greater than necessary to punish you for your sins.
