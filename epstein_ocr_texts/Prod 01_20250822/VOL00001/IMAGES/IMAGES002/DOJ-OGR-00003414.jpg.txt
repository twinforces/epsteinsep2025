Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 238 of 348
NPA.*!° The FBI reports of the victim interviews do not mention the NPA or indicate that the
victims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafafia acknowledged
that she and the case agents did not tell any of the “new” post-NPA-signing victims about the
agreement because “at that point we believed that the NPA was never going to be performed and
that we were in fact going to be [charging] Mr. Epstein.”

On October 12, 2007, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice letter to a victim
the case agents had interviewed two days earlier. This letter was identical to the VNS form notice
letter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other victims before the NPA was signed, describing the
case as “under investigation” and requesting the victim’s “patience.” The letter listed the eight
CVRA rights, but made no mention of the NPA or the § 2255 provision. Villafafia told OPR she
was unaware the FBI sent the letter, but she knew “there were efforts to make sure that we had
identified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’s questions about the
accuracy of the FBI letter’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafafia told
OPR that the NPA required Epstein to enter a plea by October 26, 2008, and “at this point we
weren’t actively looking for additional charges,” but “the investigation wasn’t technically
suspended until he completed all the terms of the NPA.”

D. The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims by Letter
about Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal
Investigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan

In anticipation of Epstein’s state court plea, Villafafia reported on November 16, 2007, to
Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors that she had learned, from FBI agents who met with
Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek, that the State Attorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify
victims of the state plea hearing.

[Belohlavek] would still like us to do the victim notifications. The

State does not have a procedure (like we do federally) where the

Court has to provide a separate room for victims who want to attend

judicial proceedings, so I do not know how many victims will

actually want to be present.>!!
Belohlavek told OPR that she did not recall the conversation referenced by the FBI nor any
coordination between her office and federal officials to contact or notify victims about Epstein’s
state plea hearing.

On November 19, 2007, Villafafia decided that to avoid any misconduct accusations from
the defense about the information given to victims, she “would put the victim notification in
writing.” She provided Sloman with a draft victim notification letter, in which among other things,
319 Not all the individuals interviewed qualified for inclusion on the victim list. For example, one would not
cooperate with investigators; a second claimed to have simply massaged Epstein with no sexual activity; and a third
claimed she had no contact with Epstein.

311 Villafafia told OPR that she understood the state took the position that because “there was either only one or
two victims involved in their case,” they “could not do victim notifications to all of the victims.”
