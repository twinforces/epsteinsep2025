NPA." The FBIreports of the victim, interviews do. not mention the NPA, or indicate that the:
victims were asked for their input; regarding 'the resolution, of the case. Villafafia, acknowledged.
that she and the: ease agents, did r not tell any’ of the, “new" Post: NEA Signing Victims about the

that we were in fact going, to be [charying] ‘Mr. Epstein.”

On October 12, 2007, the FBI Victim Specialist sent a VNS form notice letter to a victim.
the case agents had: ‘interviewed two days earlier. This letter’'was,identical'to the VNS form notice
letter the FBI Vietim Specialist sent to,.other victims before the NPA. Was signed, describing the
case as “under investigation” and requesting the: victim’s “patience.” The Ictter listed the cight,
CYRA rights, but made no mention. of the NPA, or the § 2255 provision. ‘Villafafia told OPR. she:
was unaware the FBI'sent the letter, but ‘she knew “there were efforts to:make sure that we had.
identified all victims of the crimes under‘investigation.” In-response’to, OPR’s questions about-the
accuracy of the FBI lettcr’s characterization of the case as “under investigation,” Villafana told,
OPR that, the NPA. required, Epstein. to enter a plea. by. October 26, 2008, and “at this point ‘we
weren’t. actively looking, for additional charges,” but “the investigation. wasn’t ‘technically
suspended, until he completed, all the terms of the NPA.”

D. The USAO Informs, the Defense That It Intends. to Notify Victims by Letter
about: Epstein’s State Plea Hearing and the Resolution of the Federal
Investigation, but the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification Plan

In anticipation of Epstcin’s state court:plea, Villafafia reported. on;November 11.6, ‘2007, to
Acosta, Sloman, ‘and other supervisors that: she had, learned, from FBI agents who met: with,
Assistant; State, Attorney: Belohlavek, that the State Attorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify’
victims of the state plea hearing.

[Belohlavek] would still likeus to do the victim, notifications. The
State-does not, have: a procedure (like we do federally) where. the
Court.has to provide a ‘separate room. for'victims who:want to attend
judicial -proceedings,. so 1 do not know’ how :many victims will
actually want to. be:present.*"'

Belohlavek told, OPR. that she did not. recall the conversation. referenced, by the: FBI nor any
coordination between her office and federal officials to, contact or notify victims about: Epstcin’s
State plea hearing.

On November 19, 2007, Villafafia decided that to. avoid any: misconduct accusations: from,
the defense about. the information given to victims, she “would. put the victim, notification ‘in
writing.” She provided:Sloman'with a draft victim.notification letter, in;which among other'things,

Alo Not all the individuals interviewed qualified, for inclusion, on, the victim list: For example, one would not;

cooperate with;investigators; a second claimed:to have simply massaged Epstein: with:no sexual activity; and,a third.
claimed she had no-contact with:Epstein.,

al. Villatafia’ told OPR that she: understood ‘the state: took the position that because “there: was cither:only one or

two victims inyolved:in their case,they “could not do: victim notifications to. alljof the;victims.”
