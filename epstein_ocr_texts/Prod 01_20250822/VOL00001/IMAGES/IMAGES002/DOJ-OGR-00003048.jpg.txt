omitted)). “As the rule seeks to deter future Fourth Amendment violations, the Supreme Court
advises district courts to only suppress evidence where it serves such a purpose.” United States v.
Williams, No. 10 Cr. 622 (ADS), 2018 WL 4623017, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2018) (internal
quotation marks and citations omitted). ““‘[T]he exclusionary rule is not an individual right and
applies only where it results in appreciable deterrence.” United States v. Eldred, 933 F.3d 110,
118 (2d Cir. 2019) (quoting Herring v. United States, 555 U.S. 135, 141 (2009)); see also Herring,
555 U.S. at 144 (concluding that “[t]o trigger the exclusionary rule, police conduct must be
sufficiently deliberate that exclusion can meaningfully deter it, and sufficiently culpable that such
deterrence is worth the price paid by the justice system.”). Asa result, exclusion should be a “last
resort” rather than a “first impulse.” United States v. Rosa, 626 F.3d 56, 64 (2d Cir. 2010) (internal
quotation marks and citation omitted). The exclusionary rule should be used only where law
enforcement “‘exhibit[s] deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent disregard for Fourth
Amendment rights.”” United States v. Raymonda, 780 F.3d 105, 117-18 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting
United States v. Stokes, 733 F.3d 438, 443 (2d Cir. 2013)); see also United States v. Green, 981
F.3d 945, 957 (11th Cir. 2020) (“It follows that when officers act with ‘an objectively reasonable
good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful’—1.e., by acting in reasonable reliance on a warrant,
statute, or court order—the exclusionary rule does not apply because there is little, if any,
deterrence benefit in such circumstances.” (citations omitted)).

In the context of search warrants, suppression will generally not be warranted where the
evidence at issue was “obtained in objectively reasonable reliance on a subsequently invalidated
search warrant.” United States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 922 (1984). Asa result, although the burden
is on the Government to establish good faith, “[s]earches pursuant to a warrant will rarely require
any deep inquiry into reasonableness, for a warrant issued by a magistrate normally suffices to
