himself as well. Assuming that a person validly possesses the right to refrain from giving
evidence against himself, he may invoke that right “at any time.” See Miranda v: Arizona,
384 U.S. 436, 473 (1966); Commonwealth v. Dulaney, 295 A.2d 328, 330 (Pa. 1972).
The fact that Cosby did not assert any’ right' to: remain silent to the police or while sitting
for the depositions is of no moment. Had his right to remain silent not been removed by
D.A. Castor’s decision, Cosby. would have been at liberty to invoke that right at will. That:

potential exposure to. criminal punishment no longer exist{ed].” /d. at 1065. Cosby could
not invoke that which he no longer possessed, given the Commonwealth’s assurances
that he faced no risk of prosecution. Not:only did D.A. Castor’s unconditional decision
not to prosecute Cosby strip Cosby of a fundamental constitutional right, but, because he
was forced to testify, Cosby provided Constand’s civil attorneys with evidence of Cosby's
past use of drugs to facilitate his sexual exploits. Undoubtedly, this information hindered
Cosby's. ability to defend against the civil action, and led to'a settlement for a significant
amount, of money.. We are left with no doubt that Cosby relied to his detriment upon the

district attorney’s decision not to prosecute him. The question then becomes whether
