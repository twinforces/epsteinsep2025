Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 15 of 34

Weingarten, 865 F.3d at.54. Congress enacted. the limitations provision.of the PROTECT Act
because it found'the prior statute of liniitations was “inadequate in. many cases.” H.R. Conf.
Rep. ‘No. 108-63, at ‘54. (2003). For example, a person who abducted. and raped a child could:not
be'prosceuted beyond this extended limit—even.if DNA matching conclusively identified him. as
the perpetrator one day after the:victim turned 25.” Jd.

‘Maxwell makes no argument based.on the:statute’s text. Instead, she contends that
because the House version of the bill included an, express retroactivity provision absent; from.its
final form, the Court.should infer. that Congress did:not intend the statute to apply to past
conduct. However, the legislative history makes clear that Congress abandoned the retroactivity
‘provision.in the House: bill only because it: would. have produced unconstitutional results. The
Supreme Court has explained. that.a law that revives a time-barred prosecution. violates the Ex
Post;Faeto Clause of the Constitution, but a. law that extends. an un-expired statute of limitations
docs not. St6gner ¥. California, 539 U.S. 607, 632-33 (2003). Senator Leahy, who co-
sponsored the PROTECT Act, expressed concerns in a.committee report that the proposed.
retroactivity ‘provision was, “of doubtful constitutionality” because it “would have revived the
government’s authority: to prosecute crimes that were previously time-barred.” 149 Cong. Ree.
$5137, $5147 (Apr. 10, 2003) (statement. of Scn. Leahy).. Congress ‘removed, the provision
shortly thereafter forthis reason. The removal of the éxpress retroactivity provision shows only
that Congress intended to limit the RROTECT Act to its constitutional applications, including
past conduct—like Maxwell’s—on,which,the statute of limitations had not yct expired.

Both-the text and history of the PROTECT. Act’s. amendment'to § 3283 reflect that it

applics Maxwell’s: conduct charged ‘in the $1, superseding' indictment. The Court could stop here.
