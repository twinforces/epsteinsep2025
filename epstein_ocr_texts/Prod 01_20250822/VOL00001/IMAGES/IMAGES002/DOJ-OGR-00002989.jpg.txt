1. The'2003 Amendment Satisfies Step One of Landgraf

At. step one of the Landgraf analysis, the, question.is whcetherCongress has, ‘expressly’
prescribed the statute’s proper reach.” .Landgraf, 51:1 U.S. at 280. When evaluating Congress’s
intentat step one of the Landgraf inquiry, the Sccond. Circuit, has considered. both the text of the
statute and, the legislative history. /nterprise; 391 F.3d.at 406-08. In. this case, the: amended.
versions of Section 3283 evinee Congress’s express intent'to extend the statute of limitations. The

Claims 'that’were live in 2003 were, at: the time, subjéct*to the then-cxisting statute of limitations,
which ran until ‘the victims reached the age of 25. Whenever that statutc.of limitations ran, it would.
“otherwise. preclude prosecution.” Instead, that statute of limitations was. replaced by the,,2003
amendment.

The Eighth, and Ninth Circuits have’both held that Congress intended to extend the statute
of limitations for live claims of sexual abuse. In United States v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d. 682 (8" Cir.
2005), the Eighth Circuit reasoned. that “both. the title and wording of § 3509(k) indicate that
Congress intended by it to extend. the general statute of ‘limitations. . . . § 3509(k) was later
‘recodified at § 3283 and continucd.to extend the statiite of limitations in child abuse cases.” Jd. at:
