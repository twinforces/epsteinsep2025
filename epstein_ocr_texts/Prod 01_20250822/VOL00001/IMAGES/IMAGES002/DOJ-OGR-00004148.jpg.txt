for defamation for denying she had.trafficked ‘and abused Giuffre—were focused only on Epstein
and not:on Maxwell.

Despite. AUSA [—______] contemporancous notes showing ‘that the: meeting very much
concerned,Maxwell, the government.now claims that; “the pitch;was to investigate Epstein, not:
Maxwell,” and that the discussion. included only “passing references:to Maxwell.” Resp. at 89
n.39, The government bases this argument exclusively on, a phone call prosecutors: conducted.
with AUSA[____] on February 11, 2021, five years after the February 29 mecting actually took
place. .Ex..K. This: Court should reject the government’s revisionist history.

The best evidence. of what happened, on February 29, 201:6—at least the best: evidence the.
government’ has produced so ‘far—is AUSA[-____] contemporancous.notes.* Ex. J; Abdellv.
2006) (denying motion.to. quash third-party.'‘subpoena; because “contemporaneous statements of

instcad.to rely on AUSA[__] 2021 recollection of what happened, Resp. at 62=66, 89 &

"It appears the. government:does not actually want to know anything: beyond what:AUSA |
remembers (or-doesn’ t:temember) of 2016. All the, government did ‘in response to.Maxwell’s Motion was
telephone AUSAT The government apparently: (1), did'not-search-its system. for any-and all ‘emails:
from, to, or about David, Boies, Sigrid McCawley; Stan-Pottinger, Brad Edwards, or Peter Skinner; and,
(2) did not interview anyone other than, AUSA[___], such as the other attendees ofthe mecting
(Pottinger, Edwards, and. Skinner), or any ofthe other AUSAs whom AUSAC—_] talked:to aboutzher
contacts with Gitffre’s attorneys.

Most conspicuous, of course, is thé government's failure to interview AUSA[___] Or secure

an affidavit from him. If this Court: docs’not.grant!Maxwell’s Motion on the papers, only: an evidenuary:
hearing can-address these issues.
