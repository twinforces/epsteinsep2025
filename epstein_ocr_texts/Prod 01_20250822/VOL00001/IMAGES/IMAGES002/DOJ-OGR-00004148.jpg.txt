for defamation for denying she had trafficked and abused Giuffre—were focused only on Epstein
and not on Maxwell.

Despite AUSA JJ contemporancous notes showing that the meeting very much
concerned Maxwell, the government now claims that “the pitch was to investigate Epstein, not
Maxwell,” and that the discussion included only “passing references to Maxwell.” Resp. at 89
n.39. The government bases this argument exc/usively on a phone call prosecutors conducted
with AUSA J On February 11, 2021, five years after the February 29 meeting actually took
place. Ex. K. This Court should reject the government’s revisionist history.

The best evidence of what happened on February 29, 2016—at least the best evidence the
government has produced so far—is AUSA J contemporaneous notes.® Ex. J.; Abdell v.
City of New York, No. 05 CIV. 8453 KMK JCF, 2006 WL 2664313, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 14,
2006) (denying motion to quash third-party subpoena because “contemporaneous statements of
witnesses constitute best evidence”). Although the government attached these notes to its
Response, Resp. Ex. 5, the government does not rely on them as part of its argument, choosing
instead to rely on AUSA J 2021 recollection of what happened, Resp. at 62-66, 89 &
n.39, 92 (citing Ex. 4).

* It appears the government does not actually want to know anything beyond what AUSA yg
remembers (or doesn’t remember) of 2016. All the government did in response to Maxwell’s Motion was
telephone AUSA JY The government apparently: (1) did not search its system for any and all emails
from, to, or about David Boies, Sigrid McCawley, Stan Pottinger, Brad Edwards, or Peter Skinner; and
(2) did not interview anyone other than AUSA gg, such as the other attendees of the meeting
(Pottinger, Edwards, and Skinner), or any of the other AUSAs whom AUSA ggg talked to about her
contacts with Giuffre’s attorneys.

Most conspicuous, of course, is the government’s failure to interview AUSA J or secure
an affidavit from him. If this Court does not grant Maxwell’s Motion on the papers, only an evidentiary
hearing can address these issues.
