Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we will be filing our Omnibus Reply
Memorandum in Support of Ms. Maxwell’s Supplemental Pretrial Motions Relating to the S2
Superseding Indictment.

The reply memorandum contains Confidential Information produced in discovery that is
governed by paragraph 15 of the Protective Order (Dkt. 36). Accordingly, pursuant to our prior
practice, we will not file the reply memorandum on the public docket until we are instructed to
do so by the Court. Instead, we will submit the reply memorandum by email to the Court and the
government under seal—pursuant to Rule 2(B) of the Court’s individual rules of criminal
practice—to give the government the opportunity to propose and justify any redactions it deems
necessary.

Please contact us with any questions. Your consideration is greatly appreciated.

Respectfully submitted,
/s/ Christian R. Everdell
