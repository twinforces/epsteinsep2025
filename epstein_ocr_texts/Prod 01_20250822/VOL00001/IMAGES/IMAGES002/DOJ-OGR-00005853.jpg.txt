there are several similar quality photos in the book. (See Ex. A, photos a). In any event,
these highly conclusory statements fall well short of transforming the careful confirmatory
identification used in this case into an unduly suggestive procedure. The motion to suppress should
be denied on this basis, and the identification should be admitted at trial, where the defendant will
have a full opportunity to contest the persuasiveness of that evidence through cross-examination
and attorney argument. See Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at 973 (where there has been no showing
of suggestiveness, “any question as to the reliability of the [identification] goes to the weight of
the evidence, not its admissibility”).

Even if the “confirmatory identification” procedure was impermissibly suggestive as the
defendant claims, which it was not, Minor Victim-4’s identification had clear independent
reliability because Minor Victim-4 stated that she knew the defendant by name from previous
interactions. For example, in Wiggins v. Greiner, the Second Circuit declined to address a disputed
question about a confirmatory identification’s suggestiveness because the independent basis for
the in-court identification was so clear. See Wiggins, 132 F. App’x 861, 864-66 (2d Cir. 2005)
