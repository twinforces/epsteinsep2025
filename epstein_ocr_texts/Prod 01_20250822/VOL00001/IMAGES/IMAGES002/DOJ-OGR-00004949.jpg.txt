to use at a trial, rather than seeking information as part of a criminal investigation or grand jury

proceeding. See also Botha y. Don King Productions, Inc., No. 97-cv-7587, 1998 WL 88745, at
*3 (S.D.N.Y. Feb, 27, 1998) (“[I]he Government may not use its ‘awesome’ investigative |
powers to seek modification of a protective order merely to compare the fruits of . . . discovery |
in a civil action with the results of a prosecutorial investigation in a cdinaital action.”). |
Additionally, the Government is not on a fishing expedition, merely hoping to inspect the |
protected materials for possible use in a future criminal investigation. In Martindell, 594 F.2d at |
296, the Second Circuit concluded that the purported public interest in obtaining all relevant |
evidence was less than compelling in view of the Government’s subpoena power. Here, |
however, a grand jury that is presently conducting an investigation has issued a subpoena for the |
production of documents as part of an ongoing investigation. The Government’s interest is |
;
bolstered when the request is made by a grand jury, rather than informally by the United States |
Attorney. See, e.g., Ia re Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Oct. 29, 1992, 1 F.3d 87, 94 |
n.4 (2d Cir. 1993). The Government’s application is therefore based on more than a desire to |
“exploit[] . . . the fruits of private litigation.” Martindell, 594 F.2d at 296. And the fact that the |
request comes from a grand jury, whose proceedings are by law conducted in secret, Jn re :
Petition of Craig, 131 F.3d 99, 101 (2d Cir. 1997), gives Maxwell the degree of protection that |
could reasonably be expected in the context of a criminal investigation. 2
Finally, while in other circumstances the breadth of the subpoena might be troubling, |
here the Government is in no position to narrow its request, because the Giuffre Action was |
litigated entirely almost under seal. Cf Grand Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated Apr. 19, |
1991, 945 F.2d at 1223 (noting that a “lengthy report” of the bankruptcy examination, which |
included deposition excerpts, “was made available to the public”). The fact that the Second |
