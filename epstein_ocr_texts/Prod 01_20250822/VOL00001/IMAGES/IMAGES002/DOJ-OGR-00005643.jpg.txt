Rather, Rocchio’s testimony will serve only‘to inflame and passions and.cmotions of the
jury, prejudicing Ms. Maxwell, and. to, distract and:mislead, the jury. from its constitutional
obligation of holding the: government to its burden of proof. See United States v. Figueroa, 618
F.2d 934, 943 (2d ‘Cir. 1980).(evidence is unfairly ‘prejudicial. “when. it tends to have ‘some

abuse of minors=is not:properly.admitted as expert opinion. Such an. opinion is not: based on
“scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge.” Fed. R. Evid.'702. It is. “basically . . . [a]
general pronouncement[]” that.““coincide[s] with common sense.” Unifed,States v» Serna, 799

909, 9.14 n.'5 (2d.Cir. 1.993). Expert. testimony like:this is not:admissible because it concerns “lay
matters which’ a jury is. capable of understanding and, deciding without'the: expert’s help.”
