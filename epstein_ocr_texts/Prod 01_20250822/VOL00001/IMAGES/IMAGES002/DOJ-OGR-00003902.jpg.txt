Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 224 Filed 04/20/21 Page5of17

Counts 5 and 6, “the Perjury Counts,” are improperly joined with Counts 1-4, the “Mann
Act Counts.” For the reasons stated in Ms. Maxwell’s original Motion and this Reply, the Court
should sever the Perjury Counts and grant a separate trial on these charges.

ARGUMENT
I. The Counts Are Improperly Joined.

Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure permits joinder of offenses only
when they “are of the same or similar character, or are based on the same act or transaction, or
are connected with or constitute parts of a common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a).
“Joinder is proper where the same evidence may be used to prove each count,” United States v.
Blakney, 941 F.2d 114, 116 (2d Cir.1991), or if the counts have a “sufficient logical
connection,” United States v. Ruiz, 894 F.2d 501, 505 (2d Cir.1990).

The government’s justifications for this ill-conceived superseding indictment
(Indictment) demonstrate either fundamental misunderstandings or deliberate misrepresentations
about the law and facts related to these allegations. The Perjury Counts allegedly occurred 22
years after the Mann Act Counts, during a defamation action concerning not whether Accuser-1
had sex with Jeffrey Epstein or Accusers-2 or 3 got a “massage,” but whether the fantastical
statements made by Virginia Giuffre in 20/5 were “obvious lies.” Those wild, now known to be
false, claims included her assertion that she had been sexually trafficked to Alan Dershowitz
among other famous celebrities and politicians, and her age at the time of the claimed trafficking.
The counts, collectively, are thus illogically and artificially connected and do not depend on the
“same evidence” but rather would allow the introduction of improper, irrelevant, and prejudicial
evidence not otherwise admissible.
