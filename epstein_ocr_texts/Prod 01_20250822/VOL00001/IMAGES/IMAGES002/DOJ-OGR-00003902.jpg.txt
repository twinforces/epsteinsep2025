Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 224 Filed 04/20/21 Page 5of17

Counts 5: and:6, “the Perjury.Counts,” are improperly joined.with Counts 1-4, the “Mann.
Act Counts.” For the reasons stated in.Ms. Maxwell’s origitial Motion and this Reply, the Court
should sever the Perjury Counts:and grant a.separate trial.on thesé charges.

ARGUMENT
I. The Counts Are Improperly Joined.

Rule 8(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal_Procedure’permits joinder of offenses only
when ‘they “are-of the same or similar character, or are based.on the saine. actor transaction, or
are connecied-with or constitute’ parts of a.common scheme or plan.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 8(a).
“Joinder is proper where the same evidence may be used to prove cach count,” United States v.
Blakney, 941, F.2d 114,. 116 (2d Cir.1991), or if the counts-have a “sifficient logical
connection,” United States v. Ruiz, 894 F.2d.501, 505. (2d Cir.1990).

The government’s justifications for this ill-conceived superseding indictment
(Indictment) demonstrate. cither fundamental. misunderstandings or deliberate -misrepresentations.
about the law and facis.related to these dllegations., The Perjury Counts allegedly occurred 22
years after tie Mann Act Counts, during 4 defamation action concerning not whether Accuser-1.
had sex: with:Jeffrey Epstein,or Accusers-2 or 3 gota. “massage,” but whether ‘the fantastical
statements made by Virginia.Giuffre iv 2075 were “obvious lics.” Those wild, now known to be
false, claims included her assertion that she had been sexually trafficked.to Alan.Dershowitz
among other famous celebrities and politicians, and her age atthe time of the claimed trafficking.

‘The counts, collectively; are thus illogically and artificially:connected and do not depend on the
“same evidence” but rather would allow the introduction-of- improper; irrelevant, and prejudicial

evidence not:otherwise admissible.
