With respect to Attorney-1’s inbox, the Government previewed in its October 7, 2020 letter
that it planned to review the inbox—which is voluminous’—using search terms to identify witness
statements and Giglio material. Those search terms did not include search terms relevant to the
NPA, and the Government has not searched Attorney-1’s inbox for communications relating to the
NPA. Instead, because the Government obtained these materials with an eye towards identifying
any additional witness statements or Giglio material that might not otherwise be contained in the
FBI Florida File, the Government ran search terms specific to this case, focusing on the names of
victims, Government witnesses, and Ghislaine Maxwell. The Government’s review of the emails
responsive to its search terms remains ongoing, and the Government will produce any non-
duplicative documents that warrant disclosure. The Government expects this to be a limited set of
documents that will be produced along with other Jencks Act and Giglio material. Of course,
should the Government identify any exculpatory material during this review, including with
respect to the NPA, it will promptly produce such material.

As the foregoing illustrates, the Government has taken an expansive approach to discovery
and is close to completing its review of files from other agencies for Jencks Act and Giglio
material. Thus far, the Government has not identified potential Brady material with respect to the
NPA during its review. To the extent the Government identifies potential Brady material with
respect to the NPA, that is, material that supports Maxwell’s reading of the NPA as discussed
above, or any other exculpatory material, the Government will promptly produce it. However,
> More specifically, it appears that OPR obtained an entire snapshot of Attorney-1’s inbox,
spanning several years, and encompassing all of Attorney-1’s emails during that time period. In
other words, the inbox is not specific to the Epstein investigation, and it contains a high volume of
communications relating to other cases and other internal SDFL matters. The snapshot provided
by OPR contains emails and their attachments, both inbound and outbound, totaling more than
300,000 documents.
