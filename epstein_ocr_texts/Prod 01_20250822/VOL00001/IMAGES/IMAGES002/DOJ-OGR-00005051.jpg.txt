process and because she is providing detail regarding her investigative and trial strategy to
demonstrate compliance with the specificity, relevance, and.admissibility requirements of a Rule
17(c) subpoena. United States v. Reyes, 162 F.R.D. 468, 470 (S.D-N-Y. 1995).

defendant’s counsel). Once delivered to counsel's office, the materials are not automatically
required to, be shared with the government. Whether they are: required to be shared is. determined
by other applicable: rules, ¢:g., Federal Rule. of Criminal Procedure 16(b).

As with her First. Motion, she makes‘this motion. ex parte for the “strong policy. reasons in.
favor of:an ex parte” process and because she is:providing, detail regarding her investigative and

trial strategy to demonstrate compliance with. the specificity, relevance, and.admissibility
