IV. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY’S
DISCRETION WHETHER TO. NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S. STATE
COURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A:CLEAR OR UNAMBIGUOUS
STANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA. EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY

As set forth in the factual discussion, within a few:wecks of the NPA’s signing, it became
clear that' the defense. team disagreed. with, and strongly objected to, the. government’s plaii to
inform victims of their ability to recover monctary damages from Epstein, ‘under the 18 U.S.C.
§: 2255 provision of, the (NPA, and about Epstein’ s state court plea hearing. The, USAO initially
including ‘the 8 2055, provision, and ‘Epstein’s S change of plea hearing: and. sentencing, sO that.
victims Who wanted to attérid could do so.

In November and..December 2007, Epstein’s attorneys challenged. the USAO’s position
regarding victim, notification. ‘Ultimately, Acosta made two distinet decisions concerning victim
notifications. Consistent with.Acosta’s concerns ‘about. intruding into, state actions, Acosta.elected.
to defer to state authoritics ‘the decision whether to notify victims about the state’s plea hearing
pursuant to the state’s own. victim’s rights requirements. .Acosta.also determined that the USAO
would. notify: victims about thcir.cligibility to obtain monetary damages.from Epstein under § 2255,
a. decision, that was implemented. by: letters sent.to victims after Epstein, entered ‘his state ‘pleas.
This, decision, which postponed notification,of the NPA until.after Epstein.entered his guilty’pleas,
‘was based, at lcast in.:part, on Villafafia’s and the case agents’ strategic concerns relating to
preserving the victims’ credibility: and is discussed further in. Section. V, below.

In this section, OPR. analyzes Acosta’s decision. to defer to. the state the responsibility for
notifying victims of. Epstein’ s plea hearing and;sentencing. OPR concludes that neither the CVRA,
nor the VRRA required, the government to notify victims of the state proeceding’ and. therefore
Acosta did:not violate any statutes or Department policy by deferring to'the. discretion, of the State
Attorney whether to notify-victims of Epstcin’s state guilty: pleas: and sentencing: However, OPR.
also: concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment because: by failing to: ensure that the state:
‘intended to and would. notify victims of the federal, investigation, he failed to treat ‘victims
forthrightly’ and. with. the sensitivity expected by the Department. Through. counsel, Acosta,
“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion and argued that OPR unfairly applied a standard,
“never before: expected of any U.S. Attorney.” OPR. addresses: Acosta’s criticisms ‘in. the:
‘discussion below.

A. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the. State Attorney’s Discretion Whether to
Notify Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any:
Clear or Unambiguous Standard

In November 2007, Villafatia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct.
concerning’ her interactions ‘with the victims by: preparing a written. notice to ‘victims informing’
them of the:résolution of the federal casc.and of their €ligibility for monetary damages, and inviting
them to appear. at the state:plea hearing. Villafafia:and Sloman.cxchanged edits of the draft letter
and, at Sloman’s instruction, she: provided the draft to defense: attorney Lefkowitz, who, in turn,
