2. Discussion

After a roughly two-year investigation during which the Palm Beach FBI interviewed

dozens of alleged victims of Epstein—none of whom implicated Ms. Maxwell, including

a: USAO-SDFL did not charge Ms. Maxwell. Instead, the USAO-SDFL
charged Epstein yy x. whom i 2c accused of facilitating Epstein’s
alleged sex trafficking. The fact tha a: implicated J and only later
implicated Ms. Maxwell is directly relevant to the credibility of gy and the
government’s acceptance of her later testimony against Ms. Maxwell in 2020, which forms the
basis of the sex trafficking offenses charged in Counts Five and Six of the 82 Indictment. See
United States v. Borrero, No. 13 Cr. 58 (KBF), 2013 WL 6020773, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 1,
2013) (government’s decision to charge two different people for the same crime on two different
occasions based on the testimony of the same cooperating witness is relevant “to the witness’s
credibility” and “the government’s view of the [witness’s] credibility”).

Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment charge Ms. Maxwell with conspiracy to
commit sex trafficking and a substantive sex trafficking offense for allegedly recruiting or
obtaining a engage in commercial sex acts with Epstein. See S2 Ind. (Dkt.
187) 4] 22-27. But in her first and only interview with the Palm Beach FBI on August 7, 2007,
4 The government relegates its discussion of White to a footnote in its Applicable Law section, even
though it is the controlling Second Circuit precedent on this issue. See Gov’t Mot.at 23 n.8. Instead, the
government cites several cases that were decided before White rejected the categorical approach to
precluding evidence of prior charging decisions. See id. at 22-23 (citing United States v. Boyle, No. 08
Cr. 523 (CM), 2009 WL 5178525 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 23, 2009); United States v. Rodriguez, 582 F. Supp. 2d
486 (S.D.N.Y. 2008); and United States v. Carneglia, No. 08 Cr. 76 (JBW), 2009 WL 185725 (E.D.N.Y.
Jan. 27, 2009). The Court should give these cases little or no weight.
