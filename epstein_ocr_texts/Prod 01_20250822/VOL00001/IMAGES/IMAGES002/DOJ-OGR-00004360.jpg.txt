damages.°>> During a two-month period, the subject attorneys were involved to varying degrees in
converting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in the NPA signed by Epstein on
September 24, 2007. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally able to explain to OPR both
the larger goals and the case-related factors they likely considered during the process of
conceptualizing, negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. However, the contemporaneous emails
and other records do not reflect all of the conversations among the decision makers, and their
deliberative and decision-making process is therefore not entirely clear. In particular, Menchel
and Acosta had offices located near each other and likely spoke in person about the case, but
neither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could not determine all of the
facts surrounding the development of the two-year state plea resolution or the NPA.

In the following account, OPR discusses the initial key decision to resolve the federal
investigation through state, rather than federal, charges, and sets forth many of the numerous
communications that reflect the negotiations between the parties that led to the final NPA. OPR
questioned each of the subjects about how the decision was reached to pursue a state resolution,
and OPR includes below the subjects’ explanations. The subjects’ memories of particular
conversations about this topic were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus
emerged that there were overlapping concerns about the viability of the legal theories, the
willingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the
case that had been developed at that time, and the uncertainty about the USAO’s ability to prevail
at trial and through appeal. In addition, Acosta was concerned about usurping the state’s authority
to prosecute a case involving an offense that was traditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based
on this evidence, OPR concludes that Acosta may well have formulated the initial plan to resolve
the matter through a state plea. In any event, Acosta acknowledged to OPR that, at a minimum,
he approved of the concept of a state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations
and the evidence against Epstein as set forth in Villafafia’s prosecution memorandum.
Furthermore, Acosta approved of the final terms of the NPA.

A. June — July 2007: The USAO Proposes a State Plea Resolution, which the

Defense Rejects

A few days after the June 26, 2007 meeting, Sanchez emailed Villafafia, advising her that
Epstein’s defense team would submit additional material to the USAO by July 11, 2007, and hoped
“to be able to reach a state-based resolution shortly thereafter.”** In a July 3, 2007 email, Villafafia
told Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, and her immediate supervisor that she intended to initiate plea
discussions by inviting Sanchez “to discuss a resolution of the federal investigation that could
» State laws require that a person convicted of specified sexual offenses register in a database intended to allow
law enforcement and the public to know the whereabouts of sexual offenders after release from punitive custody, and,
in some cases, to restrict such individuals’ movements and activities. The Florida Sexual Offender/Predator Registry
is administered by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act
of 2006 established a comprehensive, national sex offender registration system called the Sex Offender Registration
and Notification Act (SORNA), to close potential gaps and loopholes that existed under prior laws and to strengthen
the nationwide network of sex offender registrations.

56 In this email, Sanchez also requested a two-week extension of time for compliance with the USAO’s demands
for records, which included a demand for the computer equipment that had been taken from Epstein’s residence before
the October 2005 state search warrant and that Villafafia had been requesting from the defense since late 2006.
