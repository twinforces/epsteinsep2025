damages.** During a:'two-month, period, the'subject:attorneys were involved to varying degrees in
converting ‘the broad outline into specific: terms, resulting in the NPA. signed by Epstein, on,
September:24, 2007. The subjects, including Acosta, were generally. able to explain'to, OPR beth.
the larger goals afd. the. casc-related factors they likely considered during, the. ‘proccss of
conceptualizing,: negotiating, and finalizing this resolution. However,the: contemporancous emails
and other records do not reflect:.all of the: conversations among’ the ‘decision, makers, and. their
deliberative and decision- -making process is therefore’ not. entirely clear. In’ particular, Menchel,
and, Acosta had. offices located near cach other and. likely’ spoke in. person about: the case, but.
neither had,a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, OPR could. not determine all. of the:
facts surrounding the devclopment-of the two-ycar state plea resolution or the NPA.

In. the following account, OPR discusses the ‘initial key decision to resolve the federal
investigation through state, rather than. federal, charges, ‘and scts forth many’ of the numcrous
communications that reflect the negotiations between the partics that led. to the final NPA. OPR
questioned. cach ‘of the: subjects: about. how: the: decision ‘was: reached. to pursuc.a state resolution,
and. OPR includes below: the subjects’ explanations. The :subjects” ‘memories of particular
conversations about this topic. were unclear, but, from their statements to OPR, a general consensus
emerged ‘that; there were overlapping concerns. about: the viability of the legal theories, the
willingness of the victims to testify, the impact of a trial on the victims, the overall strength of the:
casc that had been developed at'that.time,. and the uncertainty about: the USAO’s. ability to:prevail
at trial.and through appeal. dn addition, Acosta was: concerned: about: usurping | x the state” S: authority
on this evidence, ‘OPR ‘concludes that. Acosta: may well have formulated. the initial plan, to ‘resolve
the matter through a'state ‘plea. In any event, Acosta acknowledged to OPR that, at a minimum,
he approved. of the concept ofa state-based resolution after being made aware of the allegations
and. the: evidence against Epstein as sct. forth :in Villafafia’s: prosecution memorandum.
Furthermore, Acosta.approved of the final terms of the NRA.
