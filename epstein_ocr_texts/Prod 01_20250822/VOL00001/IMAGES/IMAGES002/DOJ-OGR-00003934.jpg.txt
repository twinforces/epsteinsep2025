The:Court grants the Government's proposed redaction,and,sealing‘requests: This
conclusioiy is guided by the'thtec-part test.dfticulated’by:the Second Circuit:ii,
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435. F.3d 11.0; (2d Cir. 2006). Under this ‘test,
the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question are “judicial
documents:” (ii) ‘assess the weightof the common, law presumption:of access to the
imaterials; and (iii) balance competing:considerations against the presuinption of
access. Jd. at 119-20.

The:Court concludes that these are‘judicial, documents and.thatthe First Amendment
and coinition-law presumptions of access attach. Invbalanicing competing:
considerations.against the presumption:of access, however,;the Court:finds thatthe
specific:arguments:the Government-has put forward:in this letter, including the*need
to‘protect the privacy interests. of third.parties.and alleged victims, favor the: narrowly
tailored redactioiis. See United,States-v: Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050, (2d Cir. 1995).

The:Government’s:Ietter-does:not:discuss Exhibit-L of-Reply 'Brief'6. By April-23,
2021, the parties shall cither:propose redactions to Exhibit L of Reply Bricf 6, which
was originally filed under seal, orthey shall indiéate:to the, Court that they séck-nio
redactions and file it on EGF.,
