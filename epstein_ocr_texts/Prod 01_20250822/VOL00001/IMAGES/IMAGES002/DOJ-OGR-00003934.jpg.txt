The Court grants the Government’s proposed redaction and sealing requests. This
conclusion is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test,
the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question are “judicial
documents;” (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the
materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of
access. Jd. at 119-20.
The Court concludes that these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment
and common law presumptions of access attach. In balancing competing
considerations against the presumption of access, however, the Court finds that the
specific arguments the Government has put forward in this letter, including the need
to protect the privacy interests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrowly
tailored redactions. See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995).
The Government’s letter does not discuss Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6. By April 23,
2021, the parties shall either propose redactions to Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6, which
was originally filed under seal, or they shall indicate to the Court that they seek no
redactions and file it on ECF.
SO ORDERED.
