testimony in advance of the motion in limine deadline. The Government
understands that the defense seeks to provide expert notice by June 14, 2021, but
such a belated disclosure would not allow adequate time in advance of trial to brief
any motions regarding the admissibility of such testimony. Additionally, the
defense’s proposed disclosure date would not provide sufficient time for the
Government to locate a rebuttal expert if appropriate and provide notice of that
rebuttal expert to the defense.

e The Government would propose that the defense provide a proposed witness list
and witness statements, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.2, by
June 11,2021. This deadline will provide the defense with ample time to determine
what, if any, defense witnesses may testify at trial. This deadline will also permit
the Government adequate time to review these materials and raise any appropriate
objections or motions in advance of trial.

e The Government would propose that the defense be required to provide disclosures
pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(b)(1)(A) and 16(b)(1)(B) by
June 11, 2021, which is the same date by which the Government seeks to produce
its proposed exhibit list and marked exhibits. Such reciprocal disclosure will ensure
that the Government has adequate time to review the defense’s proposed trial
exhibits and to raise any appropriate objections in advance of trial.

In addition, the Government notes that it has already begun producing non-testifying
witness statements, the bulk of which were produced on April 13, 2021. The Government will
continue to produce any additional non-testifying witness statements on a rolling basis as it
continues to review its files for such materials.
