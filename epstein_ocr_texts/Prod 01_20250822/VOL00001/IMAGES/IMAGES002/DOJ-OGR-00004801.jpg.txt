communications between BSF and the Government related to Epstein or Maxwell. But an
equally plausible understanding of the phrase “‘on the subject of your investigation” is “related to
the investigation itself.” That interpretation is all the more reasonable in context, because
Chemical Bank involved communications between a party subject to a protective order and
prosecutors during a pending criminal investigation. See Chemical Bank, 154 F.R.D. at 93. It
was not unreasonable for the prosecutor to assume that Judge McMahon was concerned with
those sorts of communications, not communications years earlier that did not lead to a criminal
investigation. The Government has represented that its present investigation into Epstein (and
later Maxwell) began only following publication of the Miami Herald exposé in 2018. Maxwell
has made no substantial preliminary showing to the contrary.

The Court also concludes that Maxwell has made no substantial preliminary showing that
Judge McMahon would have denied the Government’s application to modify the protective order
if she knew about the 2016 communications. Materiality under Franks requires more than that a
fact be important. It allows suppression only if “the allegedly false statement is necessary” to
the court’s finding. Franks, 438 U.S. at 156 (emphasis added). If Judge McMahon would still
have ruled that the Government was entitled to ex parte modification of the protective order even
after setting aside the Government’s alleged misrepresentation, then Maxwell is not entitled to
suppression. Judge McMahon’s opinion reflects that she would have.

Judge McMahon’s ruling rested on two independent grounds. Analyzing the
Government’s application under Martindell, she first held that Maxwell could not have
reasonably relied on the protective order to keep the Government from obtaining documents
produced during the civil litigation. Judge McMahon reasoned that a civil litigant ordinarily may
not rely on a protective order subject to modification to keep evidence out of the hands of
