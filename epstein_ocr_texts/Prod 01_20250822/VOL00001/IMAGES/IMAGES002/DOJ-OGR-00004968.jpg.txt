Maxwell says she’s being held in solitary confinement in the jail on the Sunset Park
waterfront. Jail staff shine a light in her cell every 15 minutes overnight, preventing her
from sleeping, she says. The food is often inedible and the water is filthy, her attorneys
claim. She claims she’s lost weight and her hair is falling out. An MDC staffer allegedly
abused her in one encounter, the details of which have not been revealed.
