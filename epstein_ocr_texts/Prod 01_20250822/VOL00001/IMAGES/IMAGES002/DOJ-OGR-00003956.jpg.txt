to those other agency files in an October 7, 2020 letter, (Dkt. 63), and restates certain information
here in order to provide context for what, and how the Government has reviewed files for material
related to the NPA.

In sum, the Government has not identified any materials within its possession that would
constitute potential Brady material with respect to the NPA, that is, “exculpatory evidence” as to
which “there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the
result of the proceeding would have been different.” Youngblood v. West Virginia, 547 U.S. 867,
870 (2006). With this definition in mind, the Government would view any evidence that the NPA
was intended to (1) bind other U.S. Attorneys in other districts; or (11) cover Maxwell specifically,
as “evidence supporting Maxwell’s interpretation of the NPA” that it would be required to disclose.
(See April 16, 2021 Opinion, Dkt. No. 207, at 8, 3-7 (discussing the bases for Maxwell’s motion
under the NPA)). As set forth in more detail below, the Government has not identified any such
evidence in its possession.

The Government does not, however, view any other materials that are simply re/ated to the
NPA as materials it is required to disclose in this case, either under Rule 16 or Brady.
Nevertheless, and as the Court recognized, the defendant already has access to a large swath of
information that the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility (“OPR’’)
compiled as a result of their thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding the
negotiation of the NPA, and the Government has not sought to, nor would it be obligated to, redo
OPR’s work. (Dkt. No. 207, at 8 (noting the “extensive OPR report” and that “No record evidence
suggests that prosecutors promised Epstein anything beyond what was spelled out in writing.”’).
In the interest of clarity, the Government sets forth below a description of the materials it has
compiled and reviewed, and will continue to review, for potential Brady material in this case, while
