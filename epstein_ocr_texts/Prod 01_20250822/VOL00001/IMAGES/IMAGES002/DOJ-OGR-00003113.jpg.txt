is the “specification of what statements are alleged to be false, and in what:respect they are false,
in. charges of criminal falsity,” as well as “the subject matter of the congressional inquiry” for
charges:.of “refusal to answer questions in a congressional inquiry.” /d. at 125-26 (citing, inter
alia, Russell’v. United States, 369 U.S. 749 (1962)). Similarly, “where an indictment charges, a.
erime that depends. in. turn. on. violation of’ another statute, the indictment’ must identify ‘the

absent.some affirmative indication that additional specificity. is required, when charging a particular
statute, there:is no basis to conclude that an indictment:nced contain:more than the elements. of the
offense ‘and the approximate time ‘and place of: the alleged violation. See Wev, 201.7 WL.237651.
at *5 (declining to “depart from the usual. sufficiciicy framework” where, defendant “cites. iio
authority” suggesting that the statutes at issue ‘fall into the narrow’ exception to: the general. rule:
when considering motion to dismiss for lack of specificity,).

against her, the Indictment. casily satisfies the standard. for sufficiency. ‘Tellingly, the defendant
does not claim that any of these counts fails'to allege an essential. clement or to track the language
ofthe relevant statute. Not could she, asthe face of the lindictment fiot orily cofitains cach. and.
every essential clement of the crimes’ charged, but also: goes beyond the basic requirements for

pleading cach, charge by. providing additional factual background. Instead, the defendant baldly’
