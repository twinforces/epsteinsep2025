almost always be a disconnect between the estimate of the demographics of the community and
the demographics of the master jury wheel, simply because there will be a disconnect between
the timing of the two estimates. Regardless of whether one believes the appropriate point in time
to define the comparable community population should be as of November 1, 2016 or some date
thereafter, the best available data to estimate the demographics of the community is the 5-year
2018 ACS.

19. Using the ACS data concerning the population of U.S. citizens at least 18 years of age
residing in the counties comprising White Plains, the racial and ethnic representation is 12.45%
African American and 14.12% Hispanic.

20. Comparing the demographics of the White Plains community to the demographics of
the qualified jury wheel, we find that the African American representation in the community is
3.69 percentage points higher than their representation on the qualified jury wheel (12.45%-
8.76%) and the Hispanic representation in the community is 3.64 percentage points higher than
their representation on the qualified jury wheel (14.12%-10.48%).

21. Whether this difference is practically significant or legally meaningful is a decision
for the Court. To aid the Court in its determination, I have estimated the impact of the various
causes for these differences.

C. Determining and Measuring the Causes of the Difference Between the
Demographics of the Qualified Jury Wheel and the Estimate of the Demographics of
the Community of Which the Qualified Jury Wheel is Supposed to be
Representative.

22. As discussed above, the first step in the process of creating the qualified jury wheel is
to re-create the master jury wheel. The master jury wheel is supposed to be a simple random
sample from the registered voter lists of the counties making up White Plains. After selecting
potential jurors for the master jury wheel, simple random samples of the potential jurors are
