submissions as evidence of flight. Ms. Maxwell supported her position with letters from her
spouse and other friends and family members, as well as an affidavit from a witness to the
circumstances of her arrest, all of which corroborated Ms. Maxwell’s explanation that she took
these measures to protect herself and her family from the press and others who would seek to
harm them. These facts categorically do not support an inference that Ms. Maxwell intended to
flee.

The Second Circuit’s analysis in A/-Sadawi is instructive. In Al-Sadawi, the defendant’s
wife attempted to obtain expedited U.S. passports for herself and the defendant and purchased
airline tickets for the two of them (but not their four children) to fly to Egypt two-and-a-half
months after the defendant’s co-conspirator was arrested. 432 F.3d at 423. The trial court
allowed the government to introduce this evidence to show the defendant’s intent to flee and to
argue that it was proof of consciousness of guilt. /d. at 424. The Second Circuit disagreed and
highlighted several flaws in the government’s theory. First, Al-Sadawi had a valid Egyptian
passport and could have traveled at any point up to the time of his arrest. Jd. Second, “he had
known for at least six months” that he was under government surveillance and that he had been
directly implicated in the subject of the government’s investigation, but “did nothing consistent
with an intention to flee.” /d. at 424-25. Third, when Al-Sadawi was arrested an hour before the
flight was scheduled to depart, there was no evidence that he intended to board the flight — he
had not packed his bags, he did not have the tickets in his possession, and he had not left for the
airport. /d. at 425. The circuit court noted that the facts “differ[ed] sharply” from those of
United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam), where the court found the
jury could properly infer consciousness of guilt from evidence that the defendant fled the country
one day after the crime was committed. A/-Sadawi, 432 F.3d at 425 (citing Salameh, 152 F.3d at
