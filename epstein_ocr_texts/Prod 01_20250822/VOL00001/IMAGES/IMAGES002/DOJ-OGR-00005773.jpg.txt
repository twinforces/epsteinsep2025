Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 395 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page 8of9
“minor victims” deprives Ms. Maxwell of the presumption of innocence and lessens the
government’s burden of proof. U.S. Const. amends. V, VI.

CONCLUSION

This Court should enter an order precluding all trial participants from referring to the
accusers as “victims” or “minor victims.” At trial, all persons should be referred to by their
individual names.
