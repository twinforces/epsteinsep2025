Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 196 of 348

successful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolve the case without adequately’
addressing’ ways.in, which.'a, federal case potentially could have been. strengthened, such ‘as, by
obtaining Epstein’s: ‘missing’ computer'cquipment. Finally; a lack of coordination within.the USAO
compounded Acosta’s. flawed reasoning and resulted in insufficient oversight over the process, of
drafting the: NPA, a unique document. that required more detailed attention and review than. it
reccived. These: problems ‘were, moreover, entirely avoidable ‘because federal prosccution, and.

potentially’ a federal plea, agreement, existed as viable’ alternatives to the NPA resolution.

In. évaluating, Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and taker into account. the ‘fact that’
some of Epstein’ s conduct.known-today was not.known in 2007 and that other:circumstances have
‘changed. in, the interim, including some yictims’ willingness to: testify: OPR has also: evaluated.
Acosta’s decisions in a “framework that recognizes and allows for decisions that,are made in good.
faith, even if the decision in. question, may. not have Icd to: the “best” result that potentially could.
have been obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all of the available evidence and ‘the totality’
of the then-cxisting circumstances, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor.judgment in that he
chose an action.or courscof action that was in.marked.contrast:to that which the:Department: would.
reasonably expect, of an attorney exercising good judgment.

A. Acosta °s, Decision to Resolve: the Federal Investigation through a State Plea

Significant Disadvantages of : a State-Based Resolution —

The Department formulated ‘the Petite policy 'in response ‘to a Serics. of Supreme Court.
opinions holding that.the Constitution does not deny state and federal g governments the power to
prosecute: for the same:act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about the:‘ ‘potential for. abuse in.
arule permitting duplicate prosecutions,” the Department:voluntarily: adopted: apolicyof declining
to bring a federal ;prosecution following‘a,completed state: prosecution for the same conduct, except:
‘when ‘necessary ’to.advance a compelling federal interest. See Rinaldi'v. United States, 434 USS.
at 28. On its face, the Petite policy applies to federal ‘prosecutions that follow completed State
prosccutions.. USAM. § 9-2.03:1. (“This policy applics: whenever. there has: been.a prior state .
prosecution resulting in an acquittal, a.conviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement,
or a dismissal or other termination, of the case on the merits after jcopardy has attached.”). When
a,state investigation. or prosecution is still pending; the policy docs not apply: Indeed, even when
a state ‘prosecution has:resulted in a:decision on the ‘merits, the policy. permits a subsequent federal
prosecution when three substantive: prerequisites are satisficd: a “substantial federal interest”
exists, “the result in, the prior state prosccution. was manifestly inadequate in light of the federal.
interest involved,” and there is. sufficient admissible evidence to obtain and sustain a conviction
on’ federal charges. The policy also docs not apply when. “the prior prosecution involved only a.
minor-part ofthe contemplated federal charges.”

No one with whom OPR.:spoke: disputed thatthe federal. government had a substantial
interest in,prosecuting Epstcin.. ‘In her prosecution memorandum, Villafafia.identificd.five federal
statutes that: Epstein had, potentially violated. ‘The CEOS Chief described. Villafaiia’s assessment.
of these: statutes as “exhaustive,” and he concurred. with. her analysis of their applicability. to, the:
facts ofthe case. Epstein’s crimes involved ‘the sexual, exploitation. of children, interstate travel,
and. the use ofa facility of :interstate commerce, all of which. were areas. of. federal. concern.
