Reasons 4.and 5

31. The.actual selection of the master jury wheel was ‘not a simple random sample from
the November 1,.2016 voter registration lists.'* Reasons.4 and 5 delineate why the selection.
from, the voter registration, list'was not.a simple random,sample. The impaets of this. can, easily
been. if the sample had been a simple random:sample. The difference thus measures the impact
of not.drawing a simple random. sample. For reason 4, the ‘prorating issue, ‘we can, exactly.
measure‘the impact by: simply:weighting upward the selections from the overlapping counties so
that they ‘represent. 1/3 of the registered. voters ‘in those counties, as do the actual selections for
the non-overlapping counties, and then seeing what effect it has onthe percent African. American
and Hispanic. To address:reason 5, the:sample frame issue, in order to determine:the
demographics of a random:master jury wheel, if they had been considered, we need;to know two
not considered, and two, we need to know what'the percent African American, and Hispanic:is
among those inactive,voters. While] have the counts of ‘inactive'voters ‘in each county;
unfortunately, [;was not supplied with, nor do I-have access to names.and addresses necessary to
determine’the extent, to which the demographic characteristics of inactive and active'registered
voters aré different. This inforination is available only for Dutchess county. Therefore,
precisely ‘determining the characteristics.of a. sample: frame including the inactive voters can. only
be: done for Dutchess. county, where such,data-exists. ‘However, if, we assume that:the relative

difference (percent change in. percent African American or Hispanic) in thepercent.A frican

'? A simple random, sample is one ‘in, which:the sample frame is unbiased, and each element: in the
frame has'an, equal:probability of'selection.
