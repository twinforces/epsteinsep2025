an item is not, discoverable under Rule ‘16, a:party cannot make it discoverable simply by
subpocnaing it-undér Rule 17. United Statés'v. Barnes, No. S9 04-CR-186, (SCR), 2008 WL
9359654, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 2, 2008).

To determine whether issuance of the subpocna,is appropriate, the Court considers the
factors articulated in United States v:. Nixén, 418 U.S. at 699-700. In Nixon, the Supreme Court
‘explained that in,order to require production,prior to:trial, the moving: party must show: (1) that
the documents are evidentiary and‘rclevant; (2) that: they are not otherwise '‘procurable reasonably’
‘in advance of trial by exercise of duc diligence; (3) that the party cannot properly prepare for
trial without such production and, inspection in advance of trial and that the failure to obtain such
inspection:may tend unreasonably to-delay the'trial: and (4) that.the application 1s madeé in good
faith and isnot intended as a'gencral ‘fishing expedition.’ /d. at.698-700. To clear that hurdle,
the Court considers (1) relevancy, (2) admissibility, and,(3) ‘specificity. /d. at. 700.
