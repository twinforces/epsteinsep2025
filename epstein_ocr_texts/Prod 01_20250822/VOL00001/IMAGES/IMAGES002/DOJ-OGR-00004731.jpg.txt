Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 295 Filed 05/25/21 Page 24 of 26

Given the information,the:defendantialready has from the Indictment:and discovery, any additional
detail would essentially serve as early Jéricks Act production. The discovery’ gives the defense
ample information. to assist in its :investigation, and given the defense’s apparent ability to
understand who Minor Victim-4 is from, the ‘productions, (see, e:g., Def. Mot. at 3, 7-9, 24-25),
there is.no real concern'that.the defense:will'waste cfforts conducting any such investigation before

recciving Jencks Act material.’ Accordingly, and.:consistent with the Court’s prior ruling on.a.

similar issuc inthis case, the motion, foria. bill, of particulars should be denied.

VII. Minor Victim-4’s Prior Statements Constitute Giglio and Jencks Act Material,
Which ‘Do Not Warrant Immediate Disclosure

The defendant. moves for the immediate disclosure of any prior inconsistent statement
made by Minor Victimi-4. In.otherwords, the defens¢.sécks inimediate: production of impeachment:
material for this particular witness under Giglio. As the Government has alrcady noted jn. prior
briefing, it is aware of its. disclosure obligations and ‘intends to produce Giglio material for all.of
its, witnesses, including. Minor Victim-4, at least Six*wecks in advance ofttrial. Consistent withthe
practice: in, this ‘District, the Court: has ‘previously ‘concluded. that such time is sufficient for the
defense; to prepare for'trial and make use of any impeachment material. (See Apr. Op. at 30).

The Government. agrecs that any: prior statement in. which. Minor. Victim-4: discussed her
interactions with, Epstein, but. omitted mention, of the defendant, must be disclosed to the defense
in advanceof trial. Contrary to the defense’s assertion, however, such:prior'statenients are classic
impeachment material ‘that. need. only be produced sufficiently in advance:of trial to permit the

defense adequate time'to make use of them. See Wnited. States’v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 144, 146

” Although Minor ‘Victim-4’s identity is clear from the discovery, and the defendant’s motion.
makes. clear that. she strongly suspects. Minor Victim-4’s identity, there'is. no basis at this time to
require'the Government to'turn over the names ofits: witnesses, ‘including its victim-witnesses. in,
advance of its Jencks Act production, which is customary in this District.
