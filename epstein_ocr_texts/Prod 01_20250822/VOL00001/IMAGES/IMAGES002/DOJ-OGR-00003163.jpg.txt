Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 204 _ Filed 04/16/21 Page 229 of 239

Because the defendant has no right to insist that either the grand or petit jury be drawn from
any particular geographic area within the Southern District, she is wrong to assert that her fair
cross-section claim must be analyzed against the geographic location in which the offense was
committed or the trial is expected to occur. Rather, “[w]here a jury venire is drawn from a properly
designated division, we look to that division to see whether there has been any unlawful or
unconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Bahna, 68 F.3d at 24 (emphasis added). Here,
consistent with the SDNY Grand Jury Plan, the venire for the grand jury that indicted the defendant
was drawn from the voter lists of the following counties: Westchester, Putnam, Rockland, Orange,
Sullivan, and Dutchess. That is undoubtedly a “properly designated division” pursuant to the
JSSA. As noted, the Southern District is not divided into “divisions” by statute. See 28 U.S.C.
§ 112(b). For purposes of the JSSA, district courts in such undivided districts have the authority
to determine “divisions” comprised of “counties, parishes, or similar political subdivisions
surrounding the places where court is held.” 28 U.S.C. § 1869(e). Accordingly, while the SDNY
Jury Plan neither creates nor ever uses the term “White Plains Division” or “Manhattan Division,”
it contemplates Master Jury Wheels drawn from two geographic areas that satisfy the definition of
“division” under the JSSA. Thus, in evaluating the defendant’s fair cross-section claim, this Court
must “look to that division” —the counties from which the White Plains Master Wheel is drawn—
“to see whether there has been any unlawful or unconstitutional treatment of minorities.” Bahna,
68 F.3d at 24 (emphasis added).

In the face of this authority, the defendant cites only two district court cases for the
proposition that “community” for purposes of a fair cross-section claim is “widely understood to
mean the district or division where the trial will be held.” (Def. Mot. 9 at 5 (emphasis added)
(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). Not only is the authority cited non-binding, but
