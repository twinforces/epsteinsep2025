Because the defendant has'no right.to:insist that cither the grand.or petit. jury be drawn from
any particular geographic: arca. within the Southern District, she is wrong: to assert ‘that: her fair
cross-section. claim. must be analyzed against the:geographic: location in which the offense: was
committed.or the'trial is expected to oceur.. Rather, “[w]here a jury:venire is drawn.from a properly

proposition that “community” for purposes of a fair cross-section claim is “widely-understood to
