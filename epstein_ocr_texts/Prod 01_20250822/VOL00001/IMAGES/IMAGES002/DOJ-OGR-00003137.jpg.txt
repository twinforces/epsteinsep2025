(denying bill of particulars request in stock fraud case where indictment was fifteen pages long
and substantial discovery had been provided).

Although the Government cannot provide “mountains of documents to defense counsel”
as a substitute for a bill of particulars where one would otherwise be required, see Bortnovsky, 820
F.2d at 575, the provision of voluminous discovery in combination with some guidance about what
is most relevant can vitiate a need for further particulars, see, e.g., United States v. Mandell, 710
F. Supp. 2d 368, 385 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (denying request for particularization of alleged
misrepresentations where the indictment was thirty-four pages long and Government had provided
voluminous, organized discovery). In no event should volume of discovery alone warrant a bill of
particulars; “[w]hile [a] [c]ourt may sympathize with counsel’s task of reviewing a large quantity
of materials that continue to be produced,” that concern is addressed by granting the defense
sufficient time in which to conduct the review in advance of trial. See United States v. Levy, No.
11 Cr. 62 (PAC), 2013 WL 664712, at *13 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2013).

A bill of particulars would undoubtedly be helpful to the defense in any case. But “the law
does not impose upon the Government an obligation to preview its case or expose its legal
theories,” United States v. Leonelli, 428 F. Supp. 880, 882 (S.D.N.Y. 1977), and therefore “[t]he
ultimate test must be whether the information sought is necessary, not whether it is helpful.”

2014 WL 4243657, at *2 (“The purpose of a bill of particulars is to ensure that a defendant has the
information necessary to prepare a defense, not to turn over all information that would aid the
defendant.”); United States v. Rittweger, 259 F. Supp. 2d 275, 292-93 (S.D.N.Y. 2003) (denying
bill of particulars request as “‘an impermissible attempt to compel the Government to provide the
