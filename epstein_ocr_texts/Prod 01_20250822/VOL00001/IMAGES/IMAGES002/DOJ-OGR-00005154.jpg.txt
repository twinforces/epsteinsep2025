Claimants, the Administrator will institute all necessary measures to prevent payment of fraudulent
claims, including taking steps to verify claims and analyze submissions for inconsistencies,
irregularities or duplication.

provided in the Claim Form is true and accurate to the best of the Claimant’s knowledge, and that the
Claimant understands that false statements or claims made in connection with such submission may
result in fines, imprisonment and/or any other remedy available by law. Claims that appear to be
potentially fraudulent or to contain information known by the Claimant to be false when made will be
forwarded to federal, state or local law enforcement agencies and/or the appropriate Office of the
District Attorney and/or United States Attorney’s Office for possible investigation and prosecution.

2) Administering the Program and other Program-related work; and
3) Reports to law enforcement where appropriate, related to potentially fraudulent claims.

alleges she was trafficked or sexually abused. The Estate has agreed that no information obtained
solely through the Program will be disclosed publicly or used by the Estate in defending itself from any
claim, regardless of forum. The Program’s files are not available for inspection, review or copying by
the Estate or the Claimant or her representatives during or after the Program, and all pertinent
