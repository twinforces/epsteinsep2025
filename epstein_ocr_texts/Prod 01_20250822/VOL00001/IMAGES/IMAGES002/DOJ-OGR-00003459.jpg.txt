and consider victims’ views about, prospective plea negotiations.*”* The “prosecution stage”
began when charges were filed and continued through all post-sentencing legal proceedings.*””

At the time the parties signed the NPA in September 2007, few courts had addressed victim
standing under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in New York and South Carolina had ruled that
standing attached only upon the filing of federal charges.*°’ Two cases relied upon by the court
in its February 2019 opinion—Dean and its underlying district court opinion, BP Products—were
decided after the NPA was signed.

The CVRA litigation and proposed federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this
Report—show that the interpretation of victim standing under the CVRA continues to be a matter
of debate.**! In a November 21, 2019 letter to Attorney General William Barr, a Congressional
Representative stated that she had recently introduced legislation specifically to “[c]larify that
victims of federal crimes have the right to confer with the Government and be informed about key
pre-charging developments in a case, such as . . . non-prosecution agreements.”*° The CVRA
litigation arising from the Epstein case shows the lack of clarity regarding when CVRA rights
apply: the district court concluded that CVRA rights applied pre-charge, but a sharply divided
panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals came to a contrary conclusion, a decision that has
now been vacated while the entire court hears the case en banc.

Because the Supreme Court had not addressed the issue of when CVRA rights apply, the
lower courts had reached divergent conclusions, and the Department had concluded that CVRA
rights did not apply pre-charge, OPR concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims
before signing the NPA did not constitute professional misconduct because at that time, the CVRA
did not clearly and unambiguously require prosecutors to consult with victims before the filing of
federal criminal charges.*

for purposes of the CVRA until the government has filed criminal charges); United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d

403 Violations of an unambiguous obligation concerning victims’ rights could result in a violation of the rules of
professional responsibility. For example, in Attorney Griev. Comm’n of Md. v. Smith, 109 A.3d 1184 (Md. 2015), the
Court of Appeals of Maryland concluded that a prosecutor’s failure to provide any notice to the minor victim’s foster
family about the resolution of a sex abuse case during the ten months the prosecutor was responsible for the matter
was a “consistent failure” amounting to “gross negligence in the discharge of the prosecutorial function” that deprived
the victim of his rights under the Maryland Constitution. The court found violations of Maryland Rules of Professional
