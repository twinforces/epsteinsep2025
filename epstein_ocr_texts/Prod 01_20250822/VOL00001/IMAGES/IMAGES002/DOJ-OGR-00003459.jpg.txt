began-when. charges were filed and, continued through all. post-senteneing legal proceedings.

Atthe/time the partics signed.the NPA in:September 2007, few courts hiad addressed victim,
standing under the CVRA. Notably, district courts in.New York and:South.Carolina had.ruled that
standing attached. only: upon the filing of federal charges. 00 Two cases relied ' upon by’the court:
in. its February 20.19 opinion—Dean and its.underlying district court opinion, BP. Products'—were:
decided ‘after the NPA was, signed.

The CVRA litigation and:proposced federal legislation—both pending as of the date of this
Report—show that the interpretation, of victim standing‘under the CVRA continues’ to be a matter
of debate.*"' In a Novemiber,21, 2019 Ictter. to Attorney General William Barr, a’‘Congressional.
Representative stated. that. she had recently. introduced Icgislation, specifically to, “[c]larify: that.
victims of fedcral.crimes. have the right to confer with:the Government.and be informed. about key
pre-charging developments 1 in. a. case, such as:. . . non-prosccution agrecments. 40 The CVRA.
litigation arising’ from the Epstein. case ‘shows the lack of clarity regarding ‘when, CVRA. rights
apply: the district.court. concluded that. CVRA rights applicd pre-charge, but.a sharply divided.
panel of the Eleventh:Circuit:Court of Appeals came to a contrary'conclusion, a decision, that: has
now been vacated while the entire court hears the case en bane.

Because the Supreme Court had not addressed. the issuc of when CVRA, rights apply; the
lower courts had reached. divergent conclusions, and the’ Department had concluded, that CVRA,
rights did. not apply’ pre-charge, OPR. concludes that the subjects’ failure to consult with victims
before:signing the NPA did ‘not constitute professional misconduct because at that'time, the CVRA
did not:clearly and-unambiguously:require prosecutors to: consult with victims before the: filing of
federal criminal charges. 403
