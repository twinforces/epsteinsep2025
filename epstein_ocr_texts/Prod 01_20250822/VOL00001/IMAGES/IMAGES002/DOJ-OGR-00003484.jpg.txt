to: be paid to. the FBI’s communications to ensure that the victims were receiving accurate and.
timely information. that. was. consistent with the status of the case ‘and with, the USAO’s
communications with victims. 7?”

The decision.not'to inform. victims and their. attorneys about the existence of the NPA gave
victims and.the:public-the:misimpression, that the government‘had colluded with’Epstcin’s counsel
to keep the agreement secret from the: victims. Morcover, the lack of openness about ‘the NPA,
gave the impression that:the USAO lacked sensitivity for the victims in. resolving the matter and
‘undercut' ‘public. confidence inthe legitimacy of the resulting;plea agreement. The overall.result of
the subjects®:anomalous handling of this casc left at least some of the victims fecling ignored and
frustrated, ‘failed to. promote their healing process, and resulted in extensive public criticism.
Although OPR credits Villafafia’s statements that, she wanted to ‘go beyond. her obligations i in,
dealing ‘with victims, the end. result ‘nonetheless ‘was that communications with ‘victims were not-
‘prioritized by the USAO. In part.this was duc to the fact that interactions with victims are generally
handled by: staff in the USAO and the EBI who are trained and. have:expertise in. dealing with.
victims and. other witnesses. However, decisions made by Acosta, Sloman, and Villafafia also
contributed to the ‘problems. The government, as it ultimately acknowledged ‘in, the CVRA.
litigation, could have, and should have, engaged with the victims in a more transparent and_unified,
fashion.

OPR. recognizes that the: Epstein :investigation occurred. soon after ‘the passage of the
CVRA. Inthe ycars'since, the Department’s prosecutors and.personnel’have become more familiar
with i its $ provisions. OPR encourages | the, Department é asa ‘whole't ‘to’ o'take: the issues discussed above
ensute that. itt the futuire, Department attorneys” actions. promote victim. inclusion whenever
possible. Aas For example, although | the: division of responsibility between the: FBI and. the USAO
failed to consider ‘hat | in a case se involving 2 a. pre we-charge: ‘disposition, the victims v were receiving
inconsistent,and confusing communications from the separate entities. In, certain cases, such as the
Epstein, casc, prosecutors may’ nced ‘to provide more. oversight. when, multiple, ‘Dépaitment
components are communicating with victims to avoid providing :confusing and. contradictory
messages.

independent of the NPA provision. OPR, also fotes. ‘that: inj
périitted:the government’ bilitate the victinis through theii t, t
while the UVSAO We concerning potential iitipeachiient was not uiredsonable..modre extensive eonsideration of this
case-agent’s co is might have led the prosecutors to conclude that the. tisk; of the information ‘being: ‘used. to
significantly: damage ‘the crédibility-of the victims.Avas low.

Hy In addition, to the EBI letters: previously discussed, another example of:the:inconsistent communication, can,

‘be:seen in, letters that;were to be sent after, Epstein: entered, his guilty plea to two victims residing in,forcign-countrics.
Although ‘OPR: was unable to confirm that;the two victims: actually reecived the Jetters. it appears from, the-records
‘OPR:reviewed that the: government: intended to: prov. ide them, with a.standard EBL etter | stating thatithe case was under
