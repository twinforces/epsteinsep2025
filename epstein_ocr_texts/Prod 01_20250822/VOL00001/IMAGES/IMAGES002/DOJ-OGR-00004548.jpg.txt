Be Villafaiia, the FBI, and the CEOS Trial Attorney Interview Victims

As Villafafia resumed organizing the case for charging and trial, the FBI case agent
provided Villafafia with a list of “the 19 identified victims we are planning on using in” the federal
charges and noted that she and her co-case agent wanted to further evaluate some additional
victims.*°° In Washington, D.C., CEOS assigned a Trial Attorney to the Epstein case in order to
bring expertise and “a national perspective” to the matter.*+!

On January 18, 2008, one attorney representing a victim and her family contacted Sloman
by telephone, stating that he planned to file civil litigation against Epstein on behalf of his clients,
who were “frustrated with the lack of progress in the state’s investigation” of Epstein. The attorney
asked Sloman if the USAO “could file criminal charges even though the state was looking into the
matter,” but Sloman declined to answer his questions concerning the investigation.**” In late
January, the New York Post reported that the attorney’s clients had filed a $50 million civil suit
against Epstein in Florida and that “Epstein is expected to be sentenced to 18 months in prison
when he pleads guilty in March to a single charge of soliciting an underage prostitute.”**°

Between January 31, 2008, and May 28, 2008, the FBI, with the prosecutors, interviewed
additional victims and reinterviewed several who had been interviewed before the NPA was
signed.*** In late January 2008, as Villafafia and the CEOS Trial Attorney prepared to participate
330 The case agent also informed Villafafia that she expected to ask for legal process soon in order to obtain
additional information.
a1 The CEOS Trial Attorney told OPR that she was under the impression that she was brought in to help prepare
for the trial because the “plea had fallen through.”

A82 Because Sloman and the attorney were former legal practice partners, Sloman reported the interaction to
Acosta, and the USAO reported the incident to OPR shortly thereafter. OPR reviewed the matter as an inquiry and
determined that no further action was warranted.

334 An FBI interview report from May 28, 2008, indicates that one victim “believes Epstein should be prosecuted
for his actions.”
