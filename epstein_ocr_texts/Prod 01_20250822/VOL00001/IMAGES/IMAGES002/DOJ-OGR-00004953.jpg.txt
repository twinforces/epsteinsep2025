indictment” which provided the narrative for Ms. Strauss’s choreographed press conference. Ms.
Strauss exceeded the text of the indictment and went off-script, as did members of law
enforcement involved in the investigation whom Ms. Strauss invited to speak. Collectively,
these members of the government, who were directly involved in the investigation and
prosecution of this case, purposely villainized Ms. Maxwell and gave the accusers — the
individuals who will testify before a jury — the imprimatur of credibility. The press conference
was the government’s unbridled opportunity to deliver an extrajudicial opening statement in the
court of public opinion and the media has followed its lead ever since.

Similarly, counsel for undisclosed Accusers 1 to 4 have made numerous public
statements without any reprisal or public reprimand by the government. They have participated
in countless podcasts, documentaries, and other media and print publications espousing personal
opinions regarding Ms. Maxwell's "guilt or innocence" and the "merits of the case," commenting
on her "character and reputation," the "possibility of a plea of guilty to the offense charged or a
lesser offense," and continually jeopardizing her right to a fair trial.”

Undersigned counsel wrote to the government expressing concern about a particular
counsel's public remarks as that counsel has (we believe) previously represented one of the
accusers. The government responded that "[t]o our knowledge, [that lawyer] does not represent
any of the witnesses the Government expects to call at trial in this case. Because this individual
does not represent any witnesses in this case, we do not see a need to raise this issue with the
Court." Now, the government asserts that the Court needs to know about a lawyer who is not
* Ms. Maxwell previously brought to the Court's attention violations of Local Crim. R. 23.1 by David
Boies, Esq. and his law partner, Sigrid McCawley, Esq., each having filed a notice of appearance as
intervenors for accusers, as well as Bradley Edwards, Esq. (See Dkt. 27 at 4.) Many of their public and
incendiary comments occurred after this Court "warn[ed] counsel and agents for the parties and counsel
for potential witnesses that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the fact of
violations of any relevant rules." (Dkt. 28) (July 23, 2020).
