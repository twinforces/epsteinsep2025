selected from a different county. Thus, Cosby’s jury was selected from residents of
Allegheny County, and trial commenced. On June 17, 2017, after seven days of
deliberation, the jury announced that it could not reach a unanimous verdict. The trial
court dismissed the jury and declared a mistrial.

Ahead of the second trial, the Commonwealth filed a motion seeking to introduce
the testimony of a number of additional women who offered to testify about Cosby’s prior
acts of sexual abuse. Generally, the women averred that, in the 1980s, each had an
encounter with Cosby that involved either alcohol, drugs, or both, that each became
intoxicated or incapacitated after consuming those substances, and that Cosby engaged
in some type of unwanted sexual contact with each of them while they were unable to
resist. The dates of the conduct that formed the basis of these allegations ranged from
1982 to 1989, approximately fifteen to twenty-two years before the incident involving
Constand. Again, Cosby opposed the motion. Following oral argument, and despite
there being no change in circumstances other than the first jury’s inability to reach a
unanimous verdict, the trial court granted the Commonwealth’s motion in part, increasing
the number of prior bad acts witnesses allowed at trial from one to five. The selection of
the five witnesses from a pool of at least nineteen women was left entirely to the
Commonwealth.

The Commonwealth selected, and introduced testimony at Cosby’s second trial
from, the following women:

Reno, Nevada. During that year, a friend invited her to a party that, unbeknownst to her,
was being held at a temporary residence used by Cosby in Reno. At the time, Baker-
Kinney was twenty-four years old; Cosby was forty-five. When Baker-Kinney arrived at
the residence, she realized that there actually was no party, at least as she understood
