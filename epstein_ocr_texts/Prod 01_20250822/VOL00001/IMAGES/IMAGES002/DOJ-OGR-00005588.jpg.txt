the investigation is irrelevant); and (3) the charging decisions of those investigations (id. at 39
(stating that.a, special agent.“had first-hand, knowledge that.[the defendant] was not.charged in the
‘proposed. SDEL ‘indictment, because she presented. the indictment:to'the grand jury.”). The defense
has also remained entirely silent as. to-whether they intend to ‘call. the: case: agents to testify as
“summary witnesses... to place before the jury sweeping conclusions about. the Florida.
Investigations orthis one.” (Govt Mot. at.33).

“explore[s]” the “scope and progress of the Investigations” (Def. Opp. at 41), the defense should.
have:to identify for the Court the evidence relevant.to the defendant’s guilt or:innocenec that they:
