B. The Automated Victim Notification System

Both, the FBI and the USAO manage contacts: with, crime victims through the ‘Victim,
Notification System (VNS), ‘an. automated, system, maintained by the Exceutive Office for United,
States, Attorneys. The 2005 Guidelines mandated that “victim. contact. information ‘and notice: to
victims of cvents,. . . shall, absent exceptional ‘citéumstances (such. as Cases involving juvenile, oF
foreign victims), be conducted. and. maintained using VNS.” The VNS.:is separate: from agency
‘case Management. systems maintained by the FBI and. the USAO. Both. the FBI.and the: USAO
use the VNS fo generate form ‘letters to victims ‘at various points in the Investigation and the
prosecution of a criminal, casc. Although, cach form, Ictter can be augmented to add some limited
individual matter-specifie content, 'the letters Contain. specific. language concerning the ‘purpose of
the contact that cannot be removed (such asthe arrest of the defendant or the: scheduling of a
sentencing ‘hearing).’

In the ‘usual course of a criminal case, the FBI collects victim contact information. during’
the investigation stage, which it:stores inits.casemanagement:system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist.
exports ‘the victim. information data from. the FBI’s :case. management system into the VNS
databasc. Victim information stored.in.the VNS is linked to the investigation’s VWNS case number.
At the time of the Epstcin investigation, the FBI’s Victim:Specialist could usethe' VNS to generate
seven different; form, notification. letters: (1) initial, notification; (2) cas¢ is under investigation;
(3) arrest, of the defendant; (4) declination. of prosecution; (5). other; (6). advice of victim. rights;
and (7) investigation. closed.

After a charging documenthas been filed.and the “prosecution, stage” begins, the USAO’s
Victim Witness Specialist.assumes ‘responsibility for victim notification.” ‘The USAO imports.
data from its Case management system into, the VNS and links to the: previously loaded FBI VNS
data. The, USAO’S Victim Witness Specialist uses, the VNS to gencrate form. letters providing
notice of.case events, such.as charges filed; an arraignment; a proposed:plea. agreement, change of
plea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings,

final.pdf The 2008 audit identified concernswith the VN: templates, including that “VNS users « ~ cannot alter'the

formatito ensure that:it;fits with'the specific case for whichit:is being sent, ‘and many users had noted ‘that: “information,
in: notifications’ became confusing-and.sometimes contradictory when, ‘various types ofnotifications were combined in,
the same letter:”
