BE {be photographic identification procedure used was the functional

ARGUMENT

A defendant's right to due process includes the right not to be the object of suggestive
police identification procedures that create “a very substantial likelihood of irreparable
misidentification.” Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968); accord Neil v. Biggers,
409 U.S. 188, 198 (1972); see also Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 106 n.9, 114 (1977). This
principle applies both to show-ups, see, e.g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293 (1967), and to
photographic identifications. Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968).
