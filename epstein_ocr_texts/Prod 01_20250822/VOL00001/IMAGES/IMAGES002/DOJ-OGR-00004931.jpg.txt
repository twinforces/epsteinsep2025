by motion to quash or modify the subpoena . . . or to seek permissive intervention in the private
action.”) (internal quotations omitted); but see Palmieri v. State of N.Y., 779 F.2d 861, 862 (2d

Cir. 1985) (considering appeal where the New York State Attorney General, rather than the :
subject of the subpoena, was the moving party). |
During the conference, the Government was not able to explain why it, rather than Boies |
Schiller, made the application, Boies Schiller is perfectly capable of protecting its own interests.
The law firm’s failure to seek for itself permission to respond to the subpoena seems particularly |
mysterious in light of the fact that it has filed papers on behalf of Giuffre, in both the district and |
appellate proceedings, supporting the intervenors’ applications to unseal the entire record, See, |
e.g., Br. for Pl.-Appellee Virginia L. Giuffre, Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 18-2868 (2d Cir. Dec. 27, |
2018), ECF No. 83 at 1 (“Ms. Giuffre . . . is now prepared to have the world see what the record
contains.”). I suppose that Boies Schiller might not want to seem too cooperative with the |
~ Government, especially if it is concerned about ending up as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging |
breach of contract if it has failed to return or destroy the Confidential Materials in its possession. |
See Aioi Nissay Dowa Ins. Co. v. ProSight Specialty Mgmt. Co., No. 12-cv-3274, 2012 WL |
3583176, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2012). But that does not strike this Court as a reason for the |
Government to carry the firm’s water—the moreso because Judge Sweet ruled some months |
before he died that the intervenors’ appeals in Giuffre meant the lawsuit had not “concluded,” ,
and so had postponed the day when that contractual obligation kicked in. (15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |
967 at 6.)
a This ruling came in response to a motion by Maxwell to compel Giuffre’s compliance with the document
destruction provision. It argued that Giuffre’s obligations thereunder were triggered at the time of settlement. (15- :
mm Dkt. Nos. 957.) Judge Sweet denied that motion in light of the pending appeals. (15-cv-7433, Dkt. No. |
