indictment. Given Epstein’s continucd insistence that federal, charges: were not appropriate and.
defense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time: Epstein would. spend ‘in, jail, it; is
questionable ‘whether Epstein. would have acecpted such a:plea. offer; but. the USAO did ‘not even
extend ‘the, offer to determine what his response to. it would be.

Weighed against-possible lossat'trial'were some:elcar advantages'to a negotiated resolution,
that ensured a conviction, including sexual offender, registration and the opportunity to establish a.
mechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern
about intruding on the state’s authority, led him.to. the conclusion. that.a two-ycar state plea.would
be sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel. told OPR, “I don’t. believe: anybody at the:
time that this resolution, was‘entered Into. was looking at the: two years as a fair result in terms of'
the conduct. |] think that. was not the issue. ‘The issue was whether or‘not if we took this case to
‘trial, would'we risk losing everything?”

During the course of'negotiations.over a potential federal-plea, the USAO agreed.to accept.
a.plea for an 18-month,sentencc, a reduction of six:months fromthe original * ‘non-negotiable’ two-
year'term. The subjects did. not’have a clear memory of why this reduction was madc., 'Villafafia.
attributed it-to a conversation. between, Acosta and Lefkowitz; but.Acosta.attributed it'to,a decision
made during the negotiating process by Villafafa and. Lourie, telling OPR that. he understood. his
attorneys: needed flexibility: to:reach.a final deal with. Epstein.

OPR. found no contemporancous documents showing the ‘basis. for the two-year term.
Despite’ extensive subject. interviews and revicw. of thousands of contemporancous, records, OPR.
was unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year 'term. of incarcération. or why that
term,,as opposed to other possible and Iengthicr terms, ‘was: settled on for the initial offer. The:
term was not ticd. to statutory or guidclines. sentences for potential federal. charges or,.as far as
OPR. could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO- ‘initially: informed.the
defense that 'the two-year, term, was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforee that position, and,
rather than a “floor” for ‘negotiations, it; became. a. “cciling” that:was further reduced during the
negotiations. OPR. was unable 'to find atiy evidence indicating that the term. of. iricarceration ‘was
tied either to the. federal interest in secking a just sentence ¢ fora serial. sexual offender, or: to. other
crimes. “Instead, as previously “noted, it “appears “that. “Acosta ‘primarily considered only. a.
punishment ‘that: was somewhat more than that; to ‘which the state had agreed. As a result, the
USAO had. little room. to: mancuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to
enforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of :incarccration.
that was not. much more: than what the: state:/had initially sought and. which. was. significantly
disproportionate’ to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.

In.sum, it is evident:that Acosta’s desire to ‘resolve the federal case against Epstein led him
to:arrive at a target term of:incarccration. that met his own. goal of serving as a “backstop” to the:
state, but that otherwise was untcthered to any:articulable, reasonable basis. ‘In asscssing the case
only through, the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta. failed to consider the need. for
‘a, punishment. commensurate with, the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct;and the federal. interest in,
addressing it:
