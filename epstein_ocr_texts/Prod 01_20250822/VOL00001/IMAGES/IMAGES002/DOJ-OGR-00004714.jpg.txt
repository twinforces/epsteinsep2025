district bringing the second, prosecution. charges. offenses different from the offenses resolved. by.
the ‘plea. agreement in the first prosecution.” (Def. Mot. at 11) (cmphasis in. original). The
defendant is wrong. Annabi contains no such exception, and the-Government is not.aware of any
court: in this. Circuit;to apply ‘such,a, rule.

In. Annabi, the Sccond Circuit. articulated a, universal ‘principle for interpreting whether a.

plea agreement is binding outside the district where: it ‘was executed. Annabi explained that,

although.it “might be thought” that.a U.S. Attorney’s Office’s agreement which:provided that:“‘the
Government’ will :dismiss:counts of an.indictment” would bind the United States :in every judicial.

has already concluded that, under Annubi, there is no affirmative appearance that the NPA binds
entitics aside from the USAO-SDEL.

The defendant now claims that when. the Government brings charges. that are similar to
those contained in.a plea agreement, Annabi is silent, and that the ‘Court is therefore ‘free 'to apply
the opposite presumption, namely, that the ‘plea. agreement :is universally’ ‘binding on the
Government. The defendant’s argument rests exclusively on the phrase “identical,tothe-dismissed.
