also pursued. other investigative steps, which, included working with the FBI to locate an cxpert:
‘witness ‘to to testify; about the effect of'sexual, abuse on: victims. » She also continued d collecting s records
activity. On ‘several occasions, Villafafia ‘sought guidance from CEOS, which had considerable
national. expertise in, child exploitation, cases, about. legal issucs: rclating’ to the case, such, as
whether charges she was considering:required proof that the defendant knew :a:minor victim’s age.

USAO procedures generally required that a proposed. indictment be accompanied. by a.
prosecution memorandum from the AUSA. handling: the case. The prosccution memorandum was
expected to explain the factual and legal bases for the proposed charges and.address any: significant
procedural, factual, and Icgal issues of which the AUSA. was aware; ‘witness:related, ‘issucs;
expected defenses; and sentencing issucs. Routine: prosecutions, could be approved by lower-level
supervisors, but.in high-profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might require review and.
approval. by the: Criminal Division. Chicf, the FAUSA, or even. the U.S. Attorney.

Accordingly, Villafafia. drafted an 82-page prosecution memorandum, directed, to Acosta,
Sloman, Menchel, (who had replaced. Sloman as the USAO’s, Criminal Division Chief theprevious
October, when Sloman became'the FAUSA), Lourie, and. her imnicdiate supervisor, dated May 1,

relating to sexual. conduct with.and trafficking of:minors. The: ‘prosecution memorandum:sct forth.
legal. issues and potential defenses relating to cach, proposed. charge; explained. why certain. other

had. only a few ‘small edits to the indictment, and advised Louric that she approved. of it. The:
immediate supervisor told OPR. that: she viewed the case as prosecutable, but recognized that the
case ‘Was. sempre and ‘that. Villafaiia would need, co-counsel.

proposed indictment “ ‘were > very ‘thorough and contained a ‘lot of hard, work, ” but: that he wanted to
employ’ a different strategy for charging the case, focusing initially. only on the ‘victims ‘that.
presented, “the toughest cases” for Epstein— meaning those about whom Epstein. had, riot already’
raised credibility:issucs to use ‘in cross-examination. .Louric told OPR that although. the had some:
concerns about the casc—particularly the government’s ability to prevail on, certain, legal, issues
and. the credibility challenges ‘some of the victims would. face—he did. not.sec those coneerns as
insurmountable and ‘was gencrally“in favor of going forward with the prosecution.

Although ‘indictments coming out of the West Palm Beach office ‘usually did not:require:
approval, in. ‘Miami, in, this’ case, Lourie understood. that “[b]ecause there was front. ‘office
involvement from the g get-go,” he would not be the one making the final decision whether to go
