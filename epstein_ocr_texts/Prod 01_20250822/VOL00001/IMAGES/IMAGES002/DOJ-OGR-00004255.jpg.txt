v. Cole, 19 Cr. 869 (ER), Dkt. No. 23 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 18, 2020) (contemplating 3500 material four
weeks before trial in complex accounting fraud case); United States v. Carton, 17 Cr. 680 (CM),
Dkt. No. 66 (S.D.N.Y. July 10, 2018) (3500 material one month before securities fraud trial). The
defense’s request for yet earlier disclosure is unfounded and reflects a significant—and
unwarranted—departure from the practices in this District.

Consistent with the Government’s previously stated position (Dkt. No. 204 at 192), it is
entirely appropriate for defense counsel to receive notice of any co-conspirator statements through
Jencks Act materials and marked exhibits. This is because the Government only intends to
introduce co-conspirator statements either through the testimony of witnesses, which will be
previewed in the Jencks Act material, or in the exhibits, which will be marked before trial. As the
Government has previously noted, the Second Circuit has rejected the notion that non-exculpatory
co-conspirator statements are discoverable by Rule 16 or by any other means other than the Jencks
Act. See In re U.S., 834 F.2d 283, 284-87 (2d Cir. 1987) (issuing a writ of mandamus reversing
District Court’s order directing the Government “to produce all oral statements made by the
defendants and coconspirators that the Government planned to offer at trial as admissions of a
defendant” under Fed. R. Evid. 801). The cases cited by the defense all involved orders granting
bills of particulars requiring the Government to provide a list of all alleged coconspirators. They
did not involve orders directing separate notice of coconspirator statements that the Government
may introduce at trial. Indeed, the Government is unaware of any case in which such particularized
notice distinct from the production of Jencks Act and marked exhibits has been ordered, and the
defense cites none. This Court has already denied the defendant’s motion for a bill of particulars
for Counts One through Four (see Dkt. No. 207 at 19), and the Government has separately
submitted its opposition to the defendant’s supplemental motion for a bill of particulars.
