8..Cole, 19 Cr. 869 (ER),.Dkt. No..23 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 18,.2020) (contemplating 3500 material. four
weeks before trial.in complex accounting fraud, case); United States v. Garton, 17 Cr. 680 (CM),
Dkt. No. 66 (S.D.N.Y. July 10, 2018).(3500 material one month before securitics fraud 'trial). The
‘defense’s request for yet carlicr disclosure is unfounded and reflects a significant—and.
‘unwarranted—departure from,the practices in this ‘District.

Consistent with ‘the, Governiment’s previously stated position, (Dkt. No.'204 at 192), iit is
‘entirely appropriate for defense counsel to ,reccive notice of any’co-conspirator statements through.
Jencks Act materials and marked exhibits. This is because the Government. only. intends to
introduce co-conspirator ‘statements cither through. the testimony: ‘of witnesses, ‘which. ‘will be
previewed in the Jencks Act material, or in the exhibits, which will be marked before trial. As the
Government has:previously noted, the Sécond Circuit has rejected the notion that non-cxculpatory’
co-conspirator statements are:discoverable:by Rule 16 or by any.other means other than.the Jencks
Act. See dn re U.S. , 834 F.2d 283, 284-87 (2d Cir. 1.987) (issuing a, writ of. mandamus reversing
District: Court?s order dirécting the Governnient “to ‘produce all. oral statements 'made by the
defendants and coconspirators. that the Government. planned. to offer at trial as admissions of a
defendant” under, Fed; R. Evid.'801). ‘The cases.cited by the defense all involved, orders granting
bills of ‘particulars requiring the Government to, provide a list of all alleged coconspirators. They
may‘introducce at trial. Indeed, the Government is'unaware of any'case‘in which such:particularized
notice distinct from the production. of. Jencks Act and. marked exhibits has been. ordered, and ‘the:
defense cites none. This Court has already denied, the defendant’s motion for a, bill of particulars
for Counts One through Four (s¢e Dkt. No. 207 at. 19), and the Government has scparately

submitted .its opposition to the defendant’s supplemental motion -for a bill of particulars.
