Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document385 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page11of12
404(b) Notice by May 28, a date that was extended to October 11 after the continuance of the
trial. Dkt. 229 at 3. The failure to comply with the requirements of the Rule has deprived Ms.
Maxwell of the opportunity to litigate the issues on the timetable set by the Court. There is thus
no "good cause" for extending the Government's ability to do so. This Court should exclude any
evidence the government seeks belatedly to offer pursuant to Rule 404(b), or, alternatively
should the Court find good cause for the failure of notice, grant Ms. Maxwell additional time to
respond. As far as admissibility of the evidence referenced in the Letter as "direct evidence‚Äù of
the charged crimes, Ms. Maxwell seeks leave to file such a Motion within two weeks.
