absence of automatic permission for such disclosure to shield anything she said or produced trom
a grand jury’s scrutiny.. As the court:reasoned in.EPDM, 255 F.R.D. at 321, language stating that
‘the party receiving designated confidential information “shall not use or disclose the information
except. .. by such ofders.as may be issued by the Court during 'the course of this litigation” did
“not lend itself to:reasonable reliance that [the Protective Order] will afford perthanent secrecy.”
Sée also Liugosch v. Pyramid:Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 126 (2d Cir. 2006), where, in view
of a provision that said, “This Confidentiality Order shall not,prevent-anyone from. applying to
‘the Court for‘relief therefrom,” the. Second. Circuit held, “Given this provision, it is. difficult to
see how the defendants can ‘reasonably argue that they. produced documents in reliance ‘on the
fact that. the documents would always be kept secret.”

Third, there is no: evidence before me indicating that the court undertook:ainy. sort of
detailed itiquity prior to entering the Protective Order. (Hrg. Tr.;.15-cv-7433, Dkt. No., 66 at

to designate discovery materials as confidential, with:virtually no. oversight unless those
‘materials were to be filed with the court—in which.¢asé a motion for sealing had to be:made.°

435 (S.D.N.Y. 1988) (declining to-enforce protective order where “the protective order did not

adjudicate the appropriateness of confidentiality: as to particular items of discovery”). The fact

5 “The question about a-protective order, of course there should.be:a protective order‘in'this case. You.are
good. lawyers, and you have been around this'track.more times’ than I have and so-you can-prepare consensually:a
‘better protective order than I’can, and I urge-you to do that. And,.in fact, I will give you two weeks to-do that.
Shoiild'you fail, you.can present whatever'materials you wish to me and I: will decide what the protective order is
going to be. That’s‘not’a good idea because you know the case better than I do, obviously, and so. [ urge-you to.
resolve it: by your litigation: skills and-not:leave‘it up to the ignorant district-court: judge who:doesn’t really: get into
