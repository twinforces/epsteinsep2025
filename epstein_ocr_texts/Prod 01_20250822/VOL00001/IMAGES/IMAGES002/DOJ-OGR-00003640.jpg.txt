randomly selected and sent questionnaires, they are less likely to return the questionnaire, and/or
they are more likely to be found not qualified as a juror when they return the questionnaire,
and/or they are more likely to be excused when found qualified, and, hence, African Americans
and Hispanics are less likely to be moved from the master jury wheel onto the qualified jury
wheel (reason 7). As a result of this, the percent of African Americans on the qualified jury
wheel is 2.58 percentage points lower and the percent of Hispanics is 2.59 percentage points
lower. This accounts for all of the absolute difference between the qualified jury wheel and
master jury wheel and 69.9% of the absolute difference between the qualified jury wheel and the
community for African Americans and 71.2% for Hispanics.

38. The summary of the results of the analysis of the impact of the various causes on the
difference between the qualified jury wheel and the community are presented in the table below.
