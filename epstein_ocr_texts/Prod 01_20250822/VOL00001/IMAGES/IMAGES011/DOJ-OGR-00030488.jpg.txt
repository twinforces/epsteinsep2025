II. ‘Since the Meeting on February 16, 2006 When Misdemeanor Charges Were Initially
discussed, the State’s Case has Gotten Considerably Weaker

At the February 16, 2006 meeting, you suggested the Office was investigating a felony
and you indicated you would consider pleading it down to a misdemeanor. As you are aware,
since then much has happened which makes the alleged case considerably weaker and
undermines the credibility of the witnesses upon which it was based. Indeed as you already
know the following information has come to light severely damaging the reliability of the
witnesses: (i) *~ “____... - background, including a history of theft, confessions and repeated
denials of stealing from employers and customers, lying about her age, sexual promiscuity, and
prostitution; (ii) ~ “,- _-.__" __ boastful admission of drug use, underage drinking, sexual
activity, shoplifting, wild exaggeration of her income (at least $250,000), representing herself
naked on a website and as 17 years old, then 16, then 15, only changing it to her truthful age,
coincidentally four days before the last scheduled grand jury. In addition, as you have
acknowledged, she was found in an inappropriate place in Georgia after the police were called
when she ran away from home. This is separate and apart from the Florida police report
presented to you, detailing her being dropped off by the local drug dealer at 5:45 a.m., only two
days after returning to West Palm Beach, and being described by the officer as clearly on drugs;
and (iii) both of Saige’s parents’ criminal history of fraud.

In stark contrast to this is the fact that, as we indicated at the meeting, the client has
passed both a rigorous lie detector test, conducted by the most highly qualified expert we could
find, one whose reputation is beyond reproach, and provided you copies of two psycho-sexual
evaluations prepared by experts that you have agreed are well-recognized and accepted by the
State.
