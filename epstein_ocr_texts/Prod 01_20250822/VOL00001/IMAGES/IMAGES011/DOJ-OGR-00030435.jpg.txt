Community College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a
wealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein’s
plan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence
or soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring
one or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally
sought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who
would be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per “massage” session - and
who were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of
improper saa were made. This was an important element of Epstein’s plan.

13. Epstein’s plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival at
Epstein’s mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein’s assistant,
who gathered the girl’s personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen
would then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition
to other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and inthe -
bedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter
wearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and
direct the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more lewd, lascivious and
sexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl’s vagina with a vibrator.

14. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to
give Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein’s mansion
in Palm Beach. Jane was introduced.to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room
with the massage table. She was alone in the room when Epstein arrived wearing only a towel. He
