Case 9:08-cv-80119-KAM Document305 Entered on FLSD Docket 09/17/2009 Page 4 of 8
14, Any suggestion that the chance “visual” between Mr. Epstein and Jane Doe No. 4
was “pre-planned” would be absurd, disingenuous and false. The undersigned counsel went out
of his way to make certain Mr. Epstein would not be in the building after the time the deposition
was sef to begin. Had the Plaintiff and her counsel been in the deposition room at the appointed
time, no visual contact would have occurred. )
15. It is possible that Plaintiff’s counsel, by filing their motion for protective order on

- would not go forward unless the undersigned agreed to exclude Mr. Epstein from the deposition, |
were not prepared and/or did not want to proceed with the deposition. |
16. The unilateral termination of the deposition was unnecessary, inappropriate and a
. substantial waste of attomey time and the costs related to the deposition (court reporter and.
. videographer). (See Affidavit of Robert D. Critton, Jr., Mark T. Luttier and Deposition |
Transcript, Exhibits 6, 7, and 8 respectively). |
7. Had the “visual” been premeditated, the cancellation of the deposition may have .
been justified, however, under these circumstances, it was grandstanding and improper. In that |

she filed a lawsuit, this brief visual encounter from a distance should not have resulted in the |
unilateral cancellation of her deposition. :
18. The costs associated with the court reporter and videographer total $428.80. See |
Exhibit 9. | 3
Memorandum of Law In support of Motion :
