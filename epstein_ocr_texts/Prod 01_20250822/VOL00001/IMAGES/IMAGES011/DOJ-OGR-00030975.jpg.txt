12 21 9) 2005 [Go] I'm so depressed. I'm leaving for FSU on Jan. 5. I'm
packing up Will's and my room soon and it's making
me depressed thinking about it. It's going to be so
weird not having my best friend with me. I don't
want to be without him but it doesn't seem like I
have a choice. I'm really sad, and a little scared to
go. Have you been through this situation? How did u
deal with it? Write me a message please. I'm feeling
20 different emotions and I have no idea how to deal
with it.
