Virginia says she met Andrew for a second time around Easter 2001 at Epstein’s Manhattan mansion.
‘When | got to the mansion, | was told, “Get ready. You are meeting someone in the office” — which is
what they called the library. Andrew was sitting there in a big leather armchair.
Ghislaine had just given him a present, a big toy that was his Spitting Image puppet. ‘He was smiling ear-
to-ear. He locked like a kid whose parents were taking him to Disney World.
A beautiful girl called Johanna Sjoberg who worked for Jeffrey was sitting on Andrew's knee. Ghislaine
guided me over to Andrew and | think he recognised me, though | don’t know if he remembered my
name.

Organiser: Ghislaine Maxwell looks on as Andrew put his arm around Virginia. Robert
Maxwell's daughter invited her to work as Epstein's personal masseuse soon after her
15th birthday —
We kissed on the cheek and Ghislaine placed me on his other knee.’ Johanna spoke to The Mail on
Sunday three years ago about this incident, which took place when she was 21.
