: Andrew needs to be investigated and if found guilty of impropriety banished as Persona non Grata. He will lose his right as
fourth in line to the throne and all the benefits that come with that, including his extravagant and worthless lifestyle being
funded by public money.

[ was truly disgusted having read this article. Although sadly not surprised, | wonder why people idolize any kind of celebrity or
other such "influential" people, most of whom seem to surround themselves with depraved “friends” & whom can turn a blind
eye to anything where status, fame & wealth are concerned {seemingly typical of our “anything goes” society where everything
is justifiable), That aside, | am more disgusted that out of the 24 comments on this article so far, people are either talking about
what a pretty piece of tot she is, how she should have basically kept her mouth shut, how we can't be judged by the actions of
our friends, whether the royal family has any validity (as if it ever had a clean past}, & most astonishingly arguments about
whether Fergie has more right to 4 royal wedding invite than Andrew! Absolutely disgusting, looking forward to further
comments on her weight, whether she looks good for her age, & scrutiny over whether she’s had any work dene soon.
