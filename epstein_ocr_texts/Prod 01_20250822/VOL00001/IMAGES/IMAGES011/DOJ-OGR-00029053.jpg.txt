Police claim that his donations to politicians and his ‘dream team’ of influential lawyers deterred
prosecutors from bringing more serious charges of sex-trafficking. The deal certainly kept the names of a
lot of Epstein’s famous friends out of an embarrassing court case.
However, an unusual part of the agreement was that Epstein’s alleged victims were allowed to bring civil
proceedings against him.
He has so far made 17 out-of-court settlements, and some cases are ongoing. One of these girls was to
have been a key witness for the prosecution had the case gone to trial. She was just 15 years old when
she was drawn into Epstein’s exploitative world in 1998.
In her civil writ against him, under the pseudonym Jane Doe 102’ she alleged that her duties included
being ‘sexually exploited by Epstein’s adult male peers including royalty’.
