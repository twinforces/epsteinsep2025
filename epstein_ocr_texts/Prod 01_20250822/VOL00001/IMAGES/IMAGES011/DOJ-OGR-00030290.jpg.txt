In seeking to prevent the Defendant from being present in the room where the Plaintiffs
are being deposed, Plaintiffs generally rely on treatise material from Wright & Miller, 8 Federal . ,
Practice & Procedure Civ.2d, §2041, and cases cited therein. The case of Gaella vy. Onassis, 487
| F.2d 986; at 997 (2d Cir, 1973), cited by Plaintiffs, makes clear that the exclusion of a party from |
a deposition “should be ordered rarely indeed.” Unlike the Gaella case, there is no showing by 2
each of the Plaintiffs that there has been any conduct by Epstein, in rightfully defending the
actions filed against him, reflecting “an iepressible intent to continue ... harassment” of any
Plaintiff or a complete disregard of the judicial process, i.e. prior alleged conduct versus any
action/conduct displayed in this or other cases that would justify extraordinary relief. There is :
absolutely no basis in the record to indicate that Epstein will act other than properly and with the |
proper decorum at the depositions of the Plaintiffs and abide in all respects with the No-Contact |
Order. |
Wherefore, Epstein respectfully requests that this Court enter an order denying Plaintiffs’ |
. Motion for Protective Order, provide that Epstein is permitted to attend the depositions of the .
Plaintiffs that have asserted claims against him in the related matters, and for such other and |
7 further relief as this court deems just and propez. :
