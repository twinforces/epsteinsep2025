Re: Jeffrey Epstein .
Dear Mr. Krischer:
] write to you to confirm our meeting with Lanna on June 14, 2006. It is our hope
that in light of the recent developments in this case which we have set forth in our letter
of June 5, 2006, our meetings, and herein, in particular the fact that there is no sex
alleged, this case can be disposed of with, at most, an informal agreement, or more
appropriately, no charges being filed at all.
As you know, it was only at the June 1, 2006 meeting, after eight months of
investigation, that you and I both learned, for the very first time, and I believe to our
collective disbelief, that the allegation of the girl did not raise the slightest hint of actual
sex. Up until that point, we had all been laboring under the assumption this girl had
alleged multiple sexual! encounters with my client. In fact, as you are aware, it was with
this in mind that we hired George Slattery, a highly respected polygraph expert, who
unequivocally confirmed our client’s long held position both that there was no sex and
that the girl clearly stated she was 18 years old. Since, we now know with certainty that
there are in fact no allegations of sex, and no sex occurred between my client and this
girl, I would ask you to consider your previous statements to the effect that you would not
bring a "touching case" — NO sex, NO charge — in fashioning an appropriate resolution to
this matter.
As we have discussed many times, the girl’s credibility is highly questionable and
has been severely undermined by her actions over the past few months in: (1) repeatedly
changing her age on her web page (first 17, then 16, then 15) and posting graphic nude
and suggestive photographs of herself; (2) boasting about shoplifting, underage drinking,
