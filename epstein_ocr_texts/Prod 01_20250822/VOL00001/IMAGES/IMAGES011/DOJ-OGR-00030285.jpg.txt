the plaintiffs either directly or indirectly. However, there is no prohibition against Mr. Epstein’s
attendance at a deposition where, as is reflected in the order, the communication will be made to
| the plaintiff solely through defense counsel with one or more of plaintiffs’ counsel of record
. present in the room in a videotaped deposition. Obviously, any inappropriate contact or
communication will certainly be flagged by the attorneys in attendance. As such, Plaintiffs
| really have the cart before the horse in this instance (i.e., nothing prevents Epstein from attending
these depositions and, to the extent Plaintiffs believe that something improper occurs at any )
deposition, only then can that circumstance be addressed by a motion such as the instant one.)
44. Next, Plaintiffs, Jane Does 2-8, attempt to use the Affidavit of Dr. Kliman for |
| every motion for protective order/objection filed to date. This also includes the two most recent |
motions, which attempt te prevent Defendant’s investigators from doing their job, such that the :
Defendant and his attorneys can defend the claims asserted in these cases. Plaintiffs lose sight of 2
the fact that the court, in discussing the Non-Prosecution Agreement, inquired as to whether |
Epstein and his counsel could fully defend the case, which included discovery and investigation. |
All plaintiffs’ counsel and the USAO responded in the affirmative. In fact, Plaintiffs universally :
agreed at the June 12, 2009 hearing on Defendant’s Motion to Stay that regular discovery could |
proceed. See Composite Exhibit “4” at pages 26-30 & 33-34. For instance, the court asked :
Plaintiffs’ attorneys the following questions: |
The Court: [] So again, I just want to make sure that if the cases go forward and :
if Mr. Epstein defends the case as someone ordinarily would defend a case being
prosecuted against him or her, that that in and of itself is not going to cause himto .
be subject to criminal prosecution? ee, A, p.26). |
- ‘The Court: You agree he should be able to take the ordinary steps that 2 .
defendant in a civil action can take and not be concerned about having to be
prosecuted? (Ex. “A,” p.27).
