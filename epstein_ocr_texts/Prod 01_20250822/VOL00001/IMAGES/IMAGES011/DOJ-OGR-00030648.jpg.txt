bed. On one occasion Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a car for the same girl
he brought the roses to, so that she could drive her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the
girl always needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez produced a green folder which contained documents,
and a note with Mr. Epstein's stationary with direction to deliver a bucket of roses to Royal Palm Beach High
School after AH high school drama performance. Also in that same note was direction to rent a car for AH and
direction to extend the rental contract.
During the course of the investigation, subpoenas were obtained for cell phone and home phone records
from several victims and witnesses along with the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen. An analysis of these
records was conducted which found numerous telephone calls were made between Sarah Kellen and the victims.
These records indicate the dates the calls were made are consistent with the dates and times they
victims/witnesses stated they were contacted. Specifically, The phone records showed Kellen called Haley
Robson during the exact times and dates when victim SG advised the incident occurred. Kellen also coordinated
the encounters with AH, AD, ___.__.., [Beale ands | _ during the time frame the girls
stated they occurred.
Pursuant to a lawful subpoena I obtained Epstein’s private plane records for 2005 from Jet Aviation.
The plane records show arrival and departure of Epstein’s plane at Palm Beach International airport. These |
records were compared to the cell phone records of Sarah Kellen This comparison found that all the phone calls |
Kellen made to Robson and the victims were made in the days just prior to their arrival or during the time Epstein |
was in Palm Beach. .
Jeffrey Epstein, who at the time of these incidents was fifty one years of age, did have vaginal intercourse
either with his penis or digitally with AH, ML, CL and — _..., who were minors at the time this occurred, and
who at the time of the incident was fifty two years of age, did use a vibrator on the external vaginal area of SG, a
fourteen year old minor. Therefore, as Sarah Kellen coordinated and aided in the recruitment of minors to
frequent Epstein’s house so that sexual services were provided to Epstein, scheduled the said minors to return to
the work for Epstein, secured their appointments for the purpose of sexual activity and lewd and lascivious acts
and arranged the bedroom for said minors, there is sufficient probable cause to charge Sarah Kellen with four
counts of Principal in the 1* degree Unlawful Sexual Activity with a Minor, in violation of Florida State Statute
794.05(1) , a second degree felony and there is sufficient probable cause to charge her with Lewd and
Lascivious Molestation, in violation of Florida State Statute 800.04 (5), a second degree felony.
The foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed State of Florida
before me this 1° day of May, 2006 by County of Palm Beach
Det Joe Recarey, who is personally known to me. |}
