. “A prosecutor has to look ,
at it in a much broader fash-

spokesman said last week.
Epstein hired Harvard
law Professor Alan Der-
showitz when.he became
aware he was under investi-
_ gation, and Dershowitz gave
prosecutors information that
some of the alleged victims
had spoke of using alcohol
and marijuana on a popular
Web sife, according to a Palm
Beach police report.
Prosecutors typically
consider two things in decid-
ing whether to charge some-
body with sex-related offens-
e§ against minors — whether
there is sufficient evidence
and whether there is a public
interest in doing so, Dekle
said.
