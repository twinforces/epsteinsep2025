Re: Jeffrey Epstein
Dear Ms, Belohlavek: |
As a follow up to our meeting of June 1, 2006, held in an attempt to resolve this matter, i
we write to address the following issues which have arisen: (1) the risk, were the client to plead
to aggravated assault in Florida, that he might be subject to sex-offender registration statutes in {
other jurisdictions, now or in the future; (2) the nature of the charge of felony “aggravated |
assault with intent to commit a felony,” and how it does not reflect the allegations herein; and, (3) i
whether a felony conviction itself is justified based on the available evidence. }
At the outset of our June 1, 2006 meeting, we were mindful that an understanding had }
been reached with prior counsel. It was reached, however, with the clear and joint understanding
that the client would not be subjected to sex offender registration requirements in any state or :
foreign jurisdiction, Moreover, the limited time provided did not allow for an opportunity to
conduct an even cursory investigation or research into the ramifications. Were any charge to be
brought, having now learned of the serious danger a plea to felony aggravated assault presents
with regard to sex offender registration, coupled with the facts presented at our meeting and
outlined below, we strongly believe that a plea to misdemeanor solicitation is the more
appropriate resolution. As we discussed, this could include an agreed upon allocution, as we are
mindful of your concern about labeling the girls “prostitutes.” In this regard, as we discussed, the
Jaw and relevant statute are clear that the complaining witness need not be a “prostitute” in order
to satisfy the elements of the offense.
