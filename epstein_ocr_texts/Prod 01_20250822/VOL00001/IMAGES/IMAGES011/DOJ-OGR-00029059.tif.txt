| threw my arms around him and gave him a peck on the cheek.’ They flew to Paris, then Spain, then
Tangier.
| Finally, they went to London. ‘After we landed, we drove straight to Ghislaine's house,’ says Virginia. ‘]
| was given a small upstairs bedroom. The following morning, Ghislaine came in.
|
She was chirpy and jumped on the bed saying, “Get up, sleepyhead. You've got a big day. We've got to
| go shopping. You need a dress as you're going to dance with a Prince tonight.”
‘She said | needed to be “smiley” and bubbly because he was the Queen's son.
Ghislaine and | went to Burberry, where she bought me a £5,000 bag, and to a few other designer stores
| where we bought a couple of dresses, a pair of embroidered jeans and a pink singlet, perfume and make-
up.
We got back to Ghislaine’s house at around 4pm and ! ran straight upstairs to shower and dress.
When | went downstairs, Ghislaine and Jeffrey were in the lounge. There was a knock at the door.
Ghislaine led Andrew in and we kissed each other on the cheek. ‘Ghislaine served tea from a porcelain
pot and biscuits. She knew Sarah Ferguson and they talked fondly about Andrew’s daughters.
Then Ghislaine asked Andrew how old he thought | was and he guessed 17 and they all laughed.
Ghislaine made a joke that | was getting too ald for Jeffrey.
She said, “He'll scon have to trade her in.” It was widely known that he liked young girls.’ The four of
them went out to dinner and on to Tramp nightclub where, she says, Andrew danced with her.
‘After about an hour-and-a-half, we drove back to Ghislaine’s.
All of us went upstairs and | asked Jeffrey to snap a picture of me with the Prince. | wanted something to
show my Mom. Ghislaine and Jeffrey left us after that, and later Andrew left.
‘In the morning, Ghislaine said, “You did well. He had fun”. We flew straight back to the States.’ The Mail
on Sunday has confirmed that the tycoon’s jet flew to Paris on March 6, 2001, continuing to Granada,
Tangier and London, before returning to New York.
On the last leg of the trip, Virginia was paid about $15,000 (£9,400) by Epstein. ‘it was amazing money,
more than I’d ever made on a trip with him before.
He didn't say there was any special reason, but | felt like I'd done everything he wanted. He was very
pleased.’
| took eight pills a day to help me forget what I had
to do. It made me calm.
There is no suggestion that there was any sexual contact between Virginia and Andrew, or that Andrew
knew that Epstein paid her to have sex with his friends.
However, the Prince must have been aware of Epstein’s conviction when he stayed with him in New York
in December.
