FS.A. §§ 943.0435, 784.021. However, the offense of sexual battery is on the list, as well as the
charge of lewd and lascivious behavior, so there is no assurance that, in the future, a Florida
prosecutor or court will not take the position that, where the aggravated assault is combined with |
what some states have labeled a “sexually motivated intent” registration is required. |

Moreover, as you indicated at our meeting, there is no guarantee that the Florida
legislature will not expand the category of persons subject to Megan’s law, and expressly make
persons convicted of aggravated assault subject to the law, especially where the felony the actor
had the intent to commit is a sexual offense, and the victim is a minor. The trend today is
towards expansion, not contraction, of these kinds of statutes, and as you noted, Florida will be
no exception. See, e.g., “Sex Offenders; No More Escaping Registration,” 36 McGeorge L. Rev
822 2005 (Over the last twenty years expanded registration requirements, enhanced penalties for
failure to register, and public notification provisions have enlarged the scope of sex offender
registration laws); see news articles of just this past week infra describing many of the
proscriptions being adopted around the nation. And, the ex post facto clause stands as no
significant bar. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84 (2003) (upholding Alaska Sex Offender
Registration Act against a challenge that its application to persons whose offenses were
committed prior to its enactment would violate the ex post facto clause). If this trend continues,
as it likely will, the client will almost certainly be subject to sex offender registration.

Even if the client is not and will never be subject to registration requirements under
Florida’s laws, a plea to aggravated assault under the circumstances of this case could subject
him to Megan’s Law requirements in other jurisdictions. Thus, if the client pleads guilty to the
proposed aggravated assault charge, there is a grave risk that under existing state and Virgin
Islands law — quite apart from future expansion or expansive construction of those laws — he will
be subject to sex offender registration requirements and/or criminal exposure for failure to
register. There is an even graver risk still that there will be future expansion of the statutes or |
expansive construction of them that will mean he is covered or arguably so. See, e.g., Cherry
Hill Sex Offender Ordinance Upheld, Courier Post, June 1, 2006, at

_ This article discusses a decision handed down by a municipal court judge in New Jersey during the course
of our meeting. That decision upheld a zoning restriction on sex offenders living within 2500 feet of schools, parks,
playgrounds, public libraries, or day care centers. While other jurisdictions’ zoning laws currently restrict such
individuals from living within 1000 feet of these institutions, were they to follow the lead of Cherry Hill, New Jersey,
the client would most certainly be faced with the added burdens of selling his residences and moving in order to be in
compliance with the law.
