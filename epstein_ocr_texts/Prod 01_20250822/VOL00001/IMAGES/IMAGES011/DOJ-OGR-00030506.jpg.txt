Dear Lanna:
Guy has asked me to provide you with the research on why it makes a difference whether Mr.
Epstein pleads “nolo contendere” or “guilty”. As you can see from the enclosed statute, a plea of

| “nolo contendere” is not admissible as an “admission against interest” in a subsequent civil case.
A plea of guilty — even a so-called “best interest” plea of guilty — is admissible. That is the only
real legal difference. If you need anything further, please do not hesitate to call me or Guy.
Sincerely,
Enclosure: FL ST § 90.410
