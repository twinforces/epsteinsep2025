As the UK’s special representative for international trade, the Duke of York holds an important position,
requiring sound judgement and widespread respect.
But those qualities have been thrown into question since photographs of Prince Andrew with his
billionaire financier friend Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted child-sex offender who was jailed for 18 months for
soliciting underage prostitutes, appeared last weekend.
Today, however, even more serious doubts are cast on his suitability after a woman at the centre of the
Epstein case revealed to The Mail on Sunday that she had, as a 17-year-old employed by Epstein, been
flown across the world to be introduced to the Prince.
