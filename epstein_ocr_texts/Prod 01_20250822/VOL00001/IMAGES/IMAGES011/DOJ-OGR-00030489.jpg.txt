Iv. Conclusion
Under the circumstances of this case a plea to felony aggravated assault is both
unwarranted and presents a grave risk the client will be brandished a sex offender, bearing the
attendant burdens inherent with that classification. In light of this, and the credibility issues
presented by the complaining witnesses, combined with the clientâ€™s two psycho-sexual
evaluations and lie detector tests, we believe that at the very most, a misdemeanor plea to
solicitation is appropriate.
