{ __reeeby declare: .
I am employed by MetroPCS Inc. and. have been designated as Custodian of Records with responsibility for
* MetroPCS’ compliance with the subpoena duces tecum, search warrant or eourt order.

The attached records are true copies of all the records described in the legal process (subpoena, search warrant, or
court order). I personally have conducted or supervised compliance by MetroPCS with the subpoena duces tecum,
search warrant or court order. ;
The records are either call detail or subscriber records, employee records, or other wireless records, depending upon
the legal process (subpoena duces tecum, search warrant, or court order) request. ,
The subscriber records were prepared by MetroPCS personnel in the ordinary course of business at or near the time
of the act, condition, or event. Account information is entered into the MetroPCS Billing System where the data is
stored. The Custodian of Records retrieves the stored data from the MetroPCS Billing System via billing software

; for compliance purposes.

: ” MetroPCS allows its.customers’ unlimited use of their services and therefore does not need call detail records for
billing purposes. Call detail records are maintained solely for the purpose of complying with legal processes as

' mandated by CALEA. MetroPCS selected Verisign to store call detail records for the purpose of complying with
legal processes as mandated by CALEA. Verisign is a secure third-party provider and is an active consultant to
federal agencies and the Office of Homeland Security.
Call detail is recorded at the MetroPCS switch at the time of the event. MetroPCS makes it a regular business
practice to have the records stored for the purpose of meeting requirements for assisting government agencies with
lawful subpoena requests for subscriber records. The call detail is electronically transmitted to Verisign where: the
data is stored. Verisign provides a static IP address through a dedicated secure circuit for retrieval of these records. .
The call detail files are maintained for approximately 6 months deperfding on size and quantity, after which
they are automatically purged. ,
Ki Certification of No Records: That a thorough search of our files revealed no documents, records or other)
materials called for in the subpoena. r the time period requested.*
C Requested call detail records existed at one time but all or some of the records have since been purged.
I declare, under penalty of perjury, that the foregoing is true and correct.
