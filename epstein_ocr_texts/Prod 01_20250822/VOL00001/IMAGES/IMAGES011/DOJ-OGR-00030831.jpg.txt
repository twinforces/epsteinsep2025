Damn... I just read about your near fatal
accident. Glad you're alright and unscaved. It's
close calls like that that make us thank god.
I'm not very religious myself, but try and do
the right thing. I was driving down south once
on 95 and this tour bus almost tipped over on
us so I know how you feel. The least that
driver could have done was stopped, but at
least you didn't hit anything and are OK.
