employment and then again, intruding upon her mother.

8. Additionally, during this same time period yet another adult male came to Jane
Does’ employment and represented himself as an “attorney” who needed to contract her. Upon
information and belief that person was also an agent of Mr. Epstein’s.

9. It can only be concluded that Epstein and/or his counsel are purposefully
attempting to harass Jane Doe and her mother. These actions are nothing more than a continuous
insult to injury upon a young girl who has already been emotionally scarred for life.

WHEREFORE, Jane Doe, by and through Jane Doe’s mother and natural guardian,
hereby move the Court for a Protective Order prohibiting Jeffrey Epstein and/or his counsel from

| continuous and systematic harassment.

{ HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was furnished by
Facsimile and U. S. Mail, postage prepaid, this 4 day of February 2008 to all counsel on the
attached service list.
