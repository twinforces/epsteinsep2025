zombies and puppies

Current mood: @ content

hey,

halloween was so much fun! will and i ended up
going to a party. our makeup was awesome. i only
have one pic of us up right now but i'll soon have
more. the one i have up is of us after the make-up
had been on for hours,......it started to peel off in the
pic but i think it still looks awesome. also, we found
a red pitbull puppy a few days ago. i wrote a bulletin
about her but i forgot to add that she is soooo0o
good with children. i have an 18 month old living
with me and she is just soooo nice to him. she loves
to play with him and has not shown one sign of
agression. even with another dog that is bigger than
her, a cat and a baby constantly bothering her. i
want to keep her soooo bad, | just can't tho.
someone please take her!!!!!! and provide her with a
good home!!!!! thank u. <3. Â°
