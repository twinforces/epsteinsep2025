Robson Jeff would be in, in a minute. Jeff entered the bedroom wearing only a towel. He removed the towel
and laid nude on the massage table. He laid on the table onto his stomach and picked a massage oil for Robson
to rub on him. During the massage, Robson stated “He tried to touch me and I stopped him.” I asked how he
tried to touch her. Robson stated that Epstein grabbed her buttocks and she felt uncomfortable. Robson told
Epstein, I’1l massage you but I don’t want to be touched. Robson stated she performed the massage naked. At
