Iv ~— Conclusion
Under the circumstances of this case a plea to felony aggravated assault is both |
unwarranted and presents a grave risk the client will be brandished a sex offender, bearing the
attendant burdens inherent with that classification. In light of this, and the credibility issues
presented by the complaining witnesses, combined with the client’s two psycho-scxual |
evaluations and lie detector tests, we believe that at the very most, a misdemeanor plea to
solicitation is appropriate.
