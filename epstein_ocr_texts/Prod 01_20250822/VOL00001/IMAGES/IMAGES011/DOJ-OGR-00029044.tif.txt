Marcinkova became a member of the household and is alleged to have participated in the sexual contact with
underage girls.
Epstein quickly got wind of the investigation, and progress an the case got messy very quickly. He hired a squad of
lawyers and private investigators and dispatched influential friends to pressure the police into backing off. Instead,
local detectives pressed on and brought the matter to the attention of the FBI. The detectives asked their federal
colleagues whether the fact that some victims appeared fo have traveled out of state on Epstein’s planes-—plus the
use of interstate phone service to arrange assignations—might be violations of the federal 2000 Trafficking Victims
Protection Act, which carries a minimum sentence of 20 years. (Florida enacted the federal TVPA in 2002.)
So when State Attorney Barry Krischer, who also ran Florida’s Crimes Against Children Unit, proved reluctant fo
mount @ vigorous prosecution of Epstein, saying the local victims were not credible witnesses, Chief Reiter wrote the
attorney a letier complaining of the state’s “highly unusual” conduct and asking him to remove himself from the case.
He did not, and the evidence his office presented to a state grand jury produced only a single count of soliciting
prostitution. (Krischer has since refired and would not comment for this article.} The day after that indictment was
Teturned, Reiter was relieved to have the FBI step in and take over the investigation.
The detaiis that eventually emerged were often shocking and occasionally bizarre. For Epstein's birthday one year,
according to allegations in a civil suit, he was presented with three 12-year-old girls from France, who were molested
then flown back io Eurepe the next day. These same civil complaints allege that young girls from South America,
Europe, and the farmer Soviet republics, few of whom spoke English, were recruifed for Esptein’s sexual pleasure.
According to a former bookkeeper, a number of the girls worked for MC2, the modeling agency owned by Jean Luc
Brunel, a longtime acquaintance and frequent guest of Epstein’s. Brunel received $1 million from the billionaire around .
the time he started the agency.
The non-prosecution agreement executed between Epstein and the Department of Justice states that Epstein and four
members of his staff were investigated for “knowingly, in affecting interstate and foreign commerce, recruiting enticing
and obtaining by any means a person, knowing that person has not yet obtained the age of 18 years and would be
caused fo engage in commercial sex act"—that is, child sex trafficking. Yet the agreement allowed Epstein to plead
guilty to only two lower-level state crimes, soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor child for prostitution.
Although the police investigation was officially closed, Chief Reiter tried to stay abreast of the federal case against
Epstein. He was particularly concerned that Epstein be registered as a sex offender, which was part of the final deal,
and that a fund be set up to compensate his victims—which was not, although Epstein agreed fo bankroll their civil
lawsuits. Attorney Dershowitz says Epstein’s agreement ta pay attorney fees for the victims and agree to civil damage
claims—without admitting guilt—amounted to “extortion under threat of criminal prosecution.”
But exactly which crimes did the Department of Justice threaten to prosecute? The Daily Beast has learned that there
were several earlier versions of the U.S Attorney's charges, including a 53-page indictment that, had he been
convicted, could have tanded Epstein in prison for 20 years. Brad Edwards, attorney for seven of the victims, confirms
the existence of an earlier draft of the non-prosecution agreement, officially under seal, in which it appears that

Epstein “committed, at some point, to a 10-year federal sentence.” But in the end Epstein’s legal team refused that

| deal and threatened to proceed to trial. And that's where the question of whether the case was “winnable” before a
jury again came into play, according to a source in the U.S Attorney's Office, which shared the state attorney's view

that the prosecution was far from a slam dunk.

For one, it was clear from the start that Epstein would spare no legal expense and that his team of veteran fawyers,

whose cases ranged from O.J. Simpson to the investigation of Clinton’s relationship with an intern, would play rough.

| Wien the Paim Beach police started to identify victims, according to Detective Joe Recarey's report, Dershowitz

| began sending the detective Facebook and MySpace posts to demonstrate that some of these girls were no angels. .

: Reiter's deposition also states that he heard from local private investigators that Dershowitz had launched background

| checks on both the police chief and Det. Recarey. Dershowitz denies all of that. According to Reiter, both he and

| Recarey also became aware that they were under surveillance for several months, without knowing whe ordered It.
