BEAST Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free
by Conchita Sarnoff
ERO THIS SKIP THAT BAe ese ERC
| Hedge fund mogul Jeffrey Epstein became a free man Wednesday, five years after he was first
accused of sexually abusing underage girls. After months of reporting, The Daily Beast’s
Conchita Sarnoff reveals exclusive details of the investigation and the legal wrangling that saved
him from a long prison term. She reports:
* Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein’s “special treatment” and gave The Daily Beast an
exclusive look at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation.
* Earlier versions of the U.S attorney’s charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have
landed Epstein in prison for 20 years.
«Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former
Soviet republics, including three 12-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift.
* The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein's private jets, which would be
evidence of sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was
convicted of,
* Epstein’s attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered
private investigators to follow and intimidate the victims’ families; one even posed as a police officer.
« Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he “would have instructed the
Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.”
Film director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of
privilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm Beach,
which has been even less arduous than Polanski’s time at a Swiss ski chalet.
During Epstein's term of “house arrest,” he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private
Caribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor—13 months in the Palm
Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has settled more than a dozen
lawsuits brought by the underage girts who were recruited to perform “massages” at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven
victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an
amount that will hardiy dent Epstein’s $2 billion net worth.
With that, the known viclims of Epstein's sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is
closed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of the U.S. and
may weil follow Polanski into a luxurious exile.
