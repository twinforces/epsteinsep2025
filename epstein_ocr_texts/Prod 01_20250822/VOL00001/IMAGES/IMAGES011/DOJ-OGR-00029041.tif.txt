Aviv. (The remaining 15 percent is owned by his partner, Jeff Fuller.) Brunel has been observed as a house guest at
Epstein’s Palm Beach home and may well have had contact with him also in New York, where Epstein owns a lavish
home—the city’s largest private residence—and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an apartmeni on elegant Ave. Fach.

CBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated MC2 for a 60 Minutes broadcast several years ago, is quated in Michael
Gross’ book about the modeling industry, Bad and Beautiful. Pyes told the author that Brunel “ranks among the
sleaziest people in the fashion industry. We're talking about a conveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls
were not only harassed but molested.” Now The Daily Beast has learned that Epstein had made a $1 million wire
transfer to Brunel's offshore bank account in September 2004, just as he was setting up MC2. Whether this was a gift
or a loan or a backdoor investment in the new venture is unknown. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving
evidence in the Epstein investigation, Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked in April af

charged.} .
An American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young and very beautiful; many
were from Eastern Europe and spoke little English. A former bookkeeper in the agency’s Miami office, who also
arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein’s private
jets.
Pilot logs obtained in the civil suits show that some of the named plaintiffs were on the flight manifests. Other times,
the pilot would just list the other passengers plus "female."
