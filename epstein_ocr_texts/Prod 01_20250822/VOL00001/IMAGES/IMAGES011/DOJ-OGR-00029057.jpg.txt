[t started when Epstein called Virginia at the Palm Beach apartment he had rented for her.
She recalls: ‘He said, “I've got a good friend and | need you to fly to the island to
entertain him, massage him and make him feel how you make me fee!.”

‘The way it usually worked was I’d be sent to meet a man on the private island Jeffrey owned in the

They included a well-known businessman (whose pregnant wife was asleep in the next recom), a world-
renowned scientist, a respected liberal politician and a foreign head of state.
None appeared to think the arrangement was unusual. Virginia says there were many other girls in
Epstein’s circle and that she was paid extra money to help recruit them.
