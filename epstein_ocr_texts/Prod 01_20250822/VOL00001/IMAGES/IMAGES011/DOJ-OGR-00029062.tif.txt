monthly payment, a percentage of his income.’
This, finally, was a wake-up call to Virginia and she began to see the way in which she had been
groomed.
‘It was a smack in the face,’ she says. ‘I finally realised this wasn’t ever going to be a real relationship but
| knew if | refused, I’d be thrown back on the streets. So | said, “I’m too young. | want to get my massage
credentials, then maybe we'll do it’.’
The tycoon took her at her word and, for her 19th birthday in August 2002, flew her to Thailand where he
enrolled her in a massage course.

| Shortly after arriving there, she met an Australian martial arts expert called Robert. They fell in love and,

| just ten days later, married in a Buddhist ceremony.

‘| called Jeffrey and told him I'd fallen madly in love,’ Virginia says. ‘I was hoping he’d be delighted. But

| he said, “Have a nice life,” and hung up on me.’ The couple now have two sons, aged five and four, and a
daughter who recently turned one.
‘The first few months after | married Robert were the worst,’ she says. ‘I couldn’t bring myself to tell him
much. No man wants to know his wife has been traded out.

| ‘] felt very alone. | was having panic attacks and seeing a psychiairist and was on anti-depressants.

| ' Virginia was beginning to put her Epstein days behind her when, three years ago, she was phoned by
the FBI.
‘They said they had found photos of me at Jeffrey's Palm Beach house,’ she says. [Epstein had] hidden
cameras watching me the entire time even when [| was in the bathroom. | was so embarrassed.
‘| told the FBI that my true purpose was sexual. They told me everything he did was illegal because | was
under age.’ (The age of consent in Florida is 18).
‘They said that if it had to go to trial, they'd need me because Id lived with him and that made me a key
witness. | was very afraid, because he had so much power, but eventually | agreed to testify.
| was glad he'd finally been found out. He shouldn't be hurting other girls. Following Epstein’s arrest,
investigators are believed to have found a list of men’s names on his computer and asked him whether
they had been ‘treated’ to sexual encounters with his menage of minors.
‘He took the Fifth Amendment, refusing to answer, indicating that if he were to answer the question, it
could be incriminating,’ a source told The Mail on Sunday.
Epstein struck a deal resulting in what commentators characterised as a ‘slap on the wrist’ for him, and
ended up serving 13 months of his sentence, much of it in a liberal work-release programme Lawyer Brad
Edwards, who represented several of Epstein’s victims, said: ‘Rather than punish him the way they would
an average Joe, they sent a clear message that with enough money and power and influence, the system
can be bought.’
Virginia was spared her the humiliation of having to go before a jury, and has kept her feelings bottled up
until last weekend's photograph of Andrew with Epstein triggered distressing memories.
