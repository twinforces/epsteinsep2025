only to be a young woman of slight build and soft demeanor. The following is an excerpt
=. from the investigator’s report detailing her extremely short but none the less pungent -
statements;
“11.21.2005, my partner, Steve Kiraly, and I traveled to Orange Park
; (Jacksonville), Florida, in order to attempt to interview... “__ ____i. The purpose of
having two people present was to act as witnesses as to whatever might have been said by
** ** "* during the course of our interview. ~~ ‘l lives with her 18 year old boyfriend,
. William, and his mother and boyfriend at 2768 Kiowa Avenue, Orange Park, FL. At
_ approximately 6:30pm Hall arrived home. We waited about 10 minutes and approached
: the residence. I knocked on the door and a woman, who I now know as Mary Parker,
~ answered the door. I told her that we would like to speak with ** “er ™, She said
there was no *" "~~ “there. I said there must be because her Jeep was parked out
front. She then said; “I’m sorry, you mean .__.:” and I said yes. ** then came to the
door. The following conversation took place.

[Riley] .’"___, my name is Bill Riley (as I handed her my business card) and this is my
partner Steve Kiraly. We are investigators from Miami working on behalf of Jeffrey
Epstein.

{ °*_.] I don’t talk to fucking cops and I’m not talking to you.

[Riley] “~_.:, we’re not cops.

[** ] You need to leave. Get the fuck off my property, leave now.

. [Riley] ** «, there is no need to be hostile. We are not cops. We are just trying to learn
the truth. .
[** ] Get the fuck off my property. What, you’re still standing here?
[Riley] We’re leaving but we don’t understand why you’re so hostile.
[| —-.-] You have no right to be here. I moved. All that shit is behind me in another
world so get the fuck out of here. a, 2:

3 ‘* _ goes back inside the house and Mary Parker came outside on the porch
[Riley] Ma’am we’re not being hostile. We’re here just to learn the truth.
[Parker] Look, *" . is a good girl and she left down there. We’re trying to sort things
out now and hire her an attorney.
[Riley] I understand but we’re not the bad guys and we’re not cops.
[Parker] Okay, but she doesn’t want to talk with you and you really have no right being
here on my property this time of night.
[Riley] I’m sorry we’re here at-6:45pm but your son, Will, told us we could come back.
[Parker] He doesn’t own this property.
“* _ came back outside
'** 2] You’re still here, get the fuck out. I’m calling the cops if you do not leave.
[Riley] -_--.:, we’re talking with Mary and yes, we’re leaving, but all we wanted was to
learn the truth from you about what knowledge you may or may not have.”
As you can gather from this, we believe her to be the source of your concern.
Our other, but we believe, less likely alternative source for the potential
misunderstanding could be a close friend of Miss ~~ “*s named © —.-, ——._ , who goes
by the more outlandish self chosen moniker and complete web name of‘ °° _ Fucking
—_... , whose web page I also enclose.
