GREENE Reported By: MELNICHOK, THOMAS C. 11/12/03
Entered By.: GREENE, LINDA C. 11/12/03
On 10/08/03, Officer Weiss advised me that he had located Juan
Alessi, the vehicle parked in parking space #6, at the Towers
Condominium. Officer Weiss further advised that Alessi's
vehicle was a Ford Explorer, dark in color, bearing Florida tag
/ U72UGL.
On 10/13/03, I was advised by Sgt. Trylch that Epstein had met
with Alessi and had reached an agreement to pay back the money
taken and subject Epstein did not wish to prosecute at this time.
I was also advised that Det. Dawson had interviewed Alessi and
had obtained a full confession on the theft of the money but had
denied taking the Glock hand gun.
In previous conversations, Epstein was not sure of the location
of the hand gun but believed it had possibly been between the
books behind his desk. The surveillance video does not show
Alessi taking the hand gun and Alessi denies taking the gun.
On 10/15/03, at 1400 hours, I faxed the affidavit of prosecution
to Epstein asking that he complete the document indicating that
he does not wish to prosecute and fax it back to me along with
mailing the original back to me for my case file.
At 1500 hours, Det. Recarey removed the video surveillance
equipment from Epstein's residence located at 358 El Brillo.
Several attempts to obtain the affidavit of prosecution
indicated that Epstein did not wish to prosecute were met
with no response from his staff. It should be noted that
Epstein had personally met with Capt. Elmer Gudger and at
that time advised he no longer wished to prosecute Juan
Alessi for the burglary and theft from his residence.
| ATTN POLICE CLERKS: Please show a full recovery of the U.S.
Currency. Please do not show the Glock hand gun as stolen.
