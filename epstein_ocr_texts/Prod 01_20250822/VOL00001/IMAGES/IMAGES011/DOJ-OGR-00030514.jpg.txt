Dear Mr. Fronstin:

This is to notify you that certain matters suggesting possible criminal conduct on the part
of your client, Jeffrey Epstein, will be presented for consideration by the current session of the
Palm Beach County Grand Jury. You and your client are invited to appear before the Grand
Jury in the Palm Beach County Courthouse on March 7, 2006 at 9:00 AM, or as soon
thereafter as they are able to hear you.

The invitation is extended to provide an opportunity for your client to present any
personal testimony you may think proper. You should understand, however, that anything your
client testifies to may be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution.

In the event you and your client wish to present evidence or testimony of other
witnesses you must submit a written list of names and addresses of potential witnesses by
February 16, 2006 and make them available by February 21, 2006 for a sworn statement at
the State Attorney's Office. Copies of potential physical evidence must be supplied by
February 16, 2006. Keep in mind that only evidence that is relevant to the incident will
be presented to the Grand Jury.

This invitation to your client is not an offer of immunity nor is it an effort to compel your
client to participate in the Grand Jury proceedings in any way. Any participation on his part
must be entirely voluntary, and a decision not to participate cannot be used to raise an
unfavorable presumption against your client.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Sin fely, f UY, Vy,
