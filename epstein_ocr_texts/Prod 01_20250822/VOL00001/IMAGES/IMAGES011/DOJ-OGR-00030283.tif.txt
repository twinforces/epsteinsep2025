a 4, On Angust 27, 2009, the undersigned counsel sent a letter to sounsel for Jane Doe ,
No. 4 conceming her deposition and the scheduling of same on the above date. See Exhibit *2”. |
5. _No response was received until counsel for Jane Doe No. 4 called on September |

8, 2009, approximately. eight days prior to the scheduled deposition, to indicate that they now |

had an objection and would be filing a motion for protective order seeking to prevent Epstein

| from attending the deposition. Once again, Plaintiffs are attempting to stifle this litigation :

oo through their own delay tactics during discovery. Plaintiffs wish not only to attempt to force -
Epstein to trial without any meaningful discovery, but now wish to ban Epstein from any

depositions, thereby preventing him from assisting his attorneys in his very own defense. What’s :

. next — will Plaintiffs seek to prevent Epstein from attending any of the trials that result from the . |
lawsuits Jane Does 2-8 have initiated? Plaintiffs sce multions of dollars in damages, both | |

compensatory and punitive, against Defendant.

6. Defendant is filing this emergency motion and his immediate response to the |
motion for protective order to guarantee his right fo be present and assist counsel in deposing not |

only Jane Doe No. 4, but other plaintiffs and witnesses in these cases. To hold otherwise would :

| | violate Epstein’s due process rights to defend the very allegations Plaintiffs have alleged against |

| him. Does a Defendant not have a right to be present at depositions or other court proceedings to |
. — OO ‘assist counsel with the defense of his case? Does a Defendant, no matter what the charges or the :
allegations, have full and. unbridled access to the court system and the proceedings it governs,
