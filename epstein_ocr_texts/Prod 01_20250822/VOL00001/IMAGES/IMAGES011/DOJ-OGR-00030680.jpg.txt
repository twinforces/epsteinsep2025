September 2004, she was approached by Haley Robson for a chance to make money. YL was friends with
associates of Robson and knew the same people. YL had been previously told by her friends from Royal Palm

They drove to the end of the street and entered a large driveway. They entered the kitchen area of the house and
met with Epstein. YL was introduced to Jeff Epstein. Robson led YL upstairs to the main bedroom area and
set up the room with a massage table and set out the oils. YL stated that while going up the stairs and into the
bedroom she observed numerous photographs of naked young girls. Robson dimmed the lights and turned on
soft music. Robson exited the room and Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel. Epstein picked oils and
