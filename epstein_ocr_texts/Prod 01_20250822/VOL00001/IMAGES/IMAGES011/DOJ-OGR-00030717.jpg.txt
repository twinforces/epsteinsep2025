during the female on female intercourse and provide oral sex to both AH and Marcinkova. This occurred during
the time AH was sixteen years of age.

AH advised this continued to escalate during two years. The routine became familiar to AH. Epstein’s
assistant Sarah would telephone her every time Epstein was in the Town of Palm Beach and would place
appointments for her to visit and work for Epstein. Each time something new was introduced, additional monies
were produced and offered for AH to allow the acts to happen. AH consented to perform all these acts but was .
adamant that there was an understanding with Epstein that no vaginal penetration would occur with his penis. AH
explained that Epstein's penis was deformed. AH explained that his penis was oval shaped. AH claimed when

_ Epstein's penis was erect, it was thick toward the bottom but was thin and small toward the head portion. AH
called Epstein’s penis “egg-shaped.” AH stated Epstein would photograph Marcinkova and her naked and
having sex and proudly display the photographs within the home. AH stated during one visit to Epstein’s house
in which she provided a massage to Epstein, his:female friend, Nada Marcinkova, was also present. AH
provided the massage in which Marcinkova and her would fondle each others breasts and kiss for Epstein to
enjoy. Towards the end of this massage, Epstein grabbed AH and turned her over onto her stomach on the
massage table and forcibly inserted his penis into her vagina. AH stated Epstein began to pump his penis in her
vagina. AH became upset over this. She said her head was being held against the table forcibly, as he continued
to pump inside her. She screamed “No!” and Epstein stopped. She told him that she did not want to have his
penis inside of her. Epstein did not ejaculate inside of her and apologized for his actions and subsequently paid
her a thousand dollars for that visit. AH stated she knows he still displays her photographs through out the house.
