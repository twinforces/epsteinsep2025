Re: Epstein matter
Dear Detective Recarey:
I am sending you this letter in response to the serious concern you raised at our
meeting regarding an alleged claim that one of our investigators had misrepresented
himself as a police officer and in fact had actually attempted to impersonate you. As I
told you neither I nor my client would evér tolerate any such conduct on the part of our
investigators. With that in mind, I immediately began an inquiry of our staff, and believe
that the contemporaneous notes taken by our investigator, while attempting to interview
"uw aaeeey Will provide the necessary explanation for your thoroughly justified
consternation. It will also, I believe, provide a more troublesome and telling illustration
of her character. At our meeting, you may recall, -I-also advised you that our
investigation had discovered at least one of her web sites and I am enclosing some |
examples. You will note that she, herself, has chosen to go by the nickname of “pimp ~
juice” and the site goes on to detail, including photos, her apparent fascination with
marijuana. This will come as no surprise to you as I’m sure you are already aware of her
recent Palm Beach arrest for both possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia.
The following raw notes were taken by investigators (one who suffers from a
quite distinct speech impediment, making, therefore, a truly innocent claim of
impersonation virtually impossible). Both of them have many years experience in
conducting defense investigations and debriefing witnesses. They are both well versed in
the law and extremely sensitive to any potential allegations of wrongdoing especially
from witnesses who may have their own agendas. In this instance, they were instructed
to take ~~ * “statement verbatim because we feared that she, an accomplished
drama student, might try to mislead them as successfully as she had misled others. They
were instructed to ask detailed questions to further elucidate her previous
pronouncements regarding the extreme lengths she'would go to as she put it “to be rich,
no, I mean really, really rich”. But as you will read, they never got a chance to ask even a
single question, and could not for a moment be thought of, as attempting to misrepresent '
themselves as police officers. In fact even though, they are both well prepared and
seasoned investigators, they were quite shocked at the overwhelming, non-stop barrage of
profanity being hurled at them at a furious pace and volume from what initially appeared
