See betees | Damn... I just read about your near fatal
oe pe accident. Glad you're alright and unscaved. It's
ar ae close calls like that that make us thank god.
Bice ha I'm not very religious myself, but try and do
AS the right thing. I was driving down south once
m}on 95 and this tour bus almost tipped over on
Hee} US So I know how you feel. The least that
| driver could have done was stopped, but at
least you didn't hit anything and are OK.
