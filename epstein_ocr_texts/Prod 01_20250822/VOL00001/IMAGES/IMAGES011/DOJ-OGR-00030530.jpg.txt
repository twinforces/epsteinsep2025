Re: Jeff Epstein
Third Party Attorney Fee Payment
Dear Ms. Belohlavek:
As you know ! represent Mr. Jeff Epstein. Mr. Epstein’s house manager,
Yanush Banasiak, was asked to speak with your office regarding the matter
that | represent Mr. Epstein on. In anticipation of Mr. Banasiak’s meeting
with your office he decided to retain legal counsel. Yesterday, he met with
and retained, attorney Michael Salnick, who will be attending Mr.
Banasiak’s statement in your office today at 1:30 p.m.
Since your questioning of Mr. Banasiak concerns information that he may
have that arises out of his employment with Mr. Epstein, Mr. Epstein will be
paying Mr. Banasiak’s attorneys fees. | felt it important to notify you of this
third party attorney fee payment structure and confirm that you have no
objection. Mr. Epstein would like to wire the payment for Mr. Salnick’s
representation to Mr. Salnick as soon as possible. Therefore, | would
appreciate your getting back to me today on this issue.
Very truly yours,
GPF/mw
