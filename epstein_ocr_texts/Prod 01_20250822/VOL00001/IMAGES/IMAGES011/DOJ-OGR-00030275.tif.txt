a to watch the deposition and assist counsel, from a video feed, :
lf. Completely unbeknownst and unexpected by anyone, apparently the Plaintiff and
her attorney(s) were at the front door where Mr. Epstein was intending to exit. Upon seeing two |
women, one who might be the Plaintiff, Mr. Epstein immediately made a left tum and exited ,
through a separate set of doors fo the garage atea. See affidavit of Jeffrey Epstein and Igor
Zinoviev, Exhibit 4 and 5, respectively. |
12. The entire incident was completely unknown to the undersigned and Mr. Luttier

place in that Mr. Epstein and his client saw one another, she was upset and therefore the a
deposifion was cancelled from his perspective. |
