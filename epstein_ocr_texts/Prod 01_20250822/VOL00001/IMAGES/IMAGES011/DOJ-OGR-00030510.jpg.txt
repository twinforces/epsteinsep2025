Re: Jeffrey Epstein
Dear Daliah:
Pursuant to our recent conversation and my correspondence of January

of record for Mr. Epstein. Additionally, | am clarifying that Mr. Alan
Dershowitz is also counsel for Mr. Epstein.
Currently, the structure of our representation is that | will be the one in
communication with you, Lanna Belohlavek and Detective Recarey
regarding the investigation and prosecution of this matter. Mr. Dershowitz
remains involved however, at this point, | do not anticipate him contacting
you, Ms. Belohlavek or Detective Recarey to discuss any issue relevant to
this investigation. | will notify you if this structure changes.
Please call me if you have any questions or concerns about Mr. Epsteinâ€™s
representation. Additionally, | anticipate hearing back from you on
Thursday regarding the opportunity for me to meet with you and Lanna
prior to this case being presented to the Grand Jury.
