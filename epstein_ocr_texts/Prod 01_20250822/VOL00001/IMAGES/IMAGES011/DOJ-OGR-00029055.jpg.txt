. _, Prince Andrew and girl, 17, who sex offender friend flew to Britain to meet him | Mail On... Page 6 of 17 :
| Doe 102 has agreed to waive her anonymity and tell for the first time her deeply disturbing story. :
|
Her real name is Virginia Roberts and she now lives in Australia, where she is a happily married mother
| of three.
Over the course of a week during which she spoke at length te The Mail on Sunday, she appeared :
| sometimes vulnerable, and sometimes steely, but always quietly resolute and consistent.
| Revisiting events from a past that she had hoped she had left behind, Virginia occasionally buried her i
| face in her hands, .

|
Some recollections — and, for reasons of taste, not all the details can be included here — caused her to |
flush with shame. ‘I'm telling you things that even my husband didn’t know,’ she said.
|
Virginia, who has undergone counselling te try to come to terms with her past, is honest about her
initiation into Epstein’s depraved world. |
|
She was a troubled teenager, whose slender figure, delicate complexion, hesitant voice and soulful blue |
eyes made her look young for her years.
Born in Sacramento, California, in August 1983, Virginia spent her early years on a small ranch on the
West Coast of America.
This seemingly idyllic childhood ended when she was sexually molested by a man close to her family.
The fallout from that fed to her parents temporarily splitting up. Blaming herself, Virginia began to get into
trouble Aged 11, she was sent to live with an aunt but repeatedly ran away.
Living on the streets, she was beaten up and slept with at least two older men in return for food. ‘Twas a
paedophile’s dream, she says.
Three years jater, she was reunited with her family and started a new life with her father who had moved
to Palm Beach,
Florida, where he was maintenance manager at Donald Trump’s country club, Mar-a-Lago.
|
Virginia got a part-time job as a changing room assistant -which is where, soon after her 15th birthday, |
she met Ghislaine Maxwell, who invited her to work as Epstein’s personal masseuse.
‘l was wearing my uniform — a white miniskirt and a skin-tight white polo top - when I was approached by |
Ghislaine,’ Virginia says.
I
‘| told her | wanted to become a masseuse and she said she worked for a very wealthy gentleman who
was looking for a travelling masseuse.
I'd get training and be paid well.'Virginia’s father gave his blessing, believing his daughter was being
handed the opportunity to learn a skill and to work for a wealthy and respectable employer. :
He drove her to Epstein’s pink mansion on the Palm Beach waterfront — he also owns a nine-storey home
in New York, the city’s biggest private residence; a 7,500-acre ranch called ‘Zorro’ in New Mexico and
Little Saint James, a private 70- acre atoll in the US Virgin Islands. :
