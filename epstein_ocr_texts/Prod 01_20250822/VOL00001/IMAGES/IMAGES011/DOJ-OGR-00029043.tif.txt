; But the question remains: Did Epstein'’s wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; Prince Andrew;
former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and former Treasury Secretary Larry
Summers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—aliow him to receive only a slap on the
wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year sentence? Was he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hitting
lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among
them—toc escape equal justice?
Michael Reiter, the former Palm Beach police chief, certainly thinks so. He gave The Daily Beast exclusive access to
the transcript of his nine-hour deposition for the victims’ civil suits, in which he explained how the case against Epstein
was minimized by the State Attorney's Office, then bargained down by the U.S. Department of Justice, all in an
atmosphere of hardball legal tactics and social pressures so intense that Reiter became estranged from several
colleagues. At the time, Reiter, who retired in 2009 and now runs his own security firm, objected both to Epstein’s plea
agreement and to the flexible terms of his incarceration in the county jail rather than state prison. Asked during the
deposition whether he thought Epstein received special treatment, he answered “yes.”
In March 2065, Reiter's department, acting on a complaint from the Florida parents of a 14-year-old girl, launched an
investigation that would eventually uncover a pattern of predatory behavior stretching back years and spanning
several continents, knowingly enabled by Epstein’s associates and employees. Two or three times a day, whenever
Epstein was in Palm Beach, a teenage girl woutd be brought to the mansion on El Brillo Way. (“The younger the
better,” he instructed Haley Robson, a focal teenager whe was paid to bring other girls to the house, and who
declared, on a police tape, that she was “like a Heidi Fleiss,” the infamous California madam.) Advised that she would
be giving a “massage,” the girl was then pressured to remove her clothes, submit to fondling and a large vibrator, and
sometimes lured into more invasive sexual contact. Each girl was paid $200 or more, depending on how far things
went, by house manager Alfredo Rodriguez, who was instructed always to have $2,000 cash on hand.
The Palm Beach Potice Department identified 17 local girls who had contact with Epstein before the age of consent;
the youngest was 14, and many were younger than 16. And that was just at one of Epstein’s many hames around the
world—he also owns property in New York, Santa Fe, Paris, London, and the Caribbean. Subsequent investigation by
ihe FBI, reaching as far back as 2001, indentified roughly 40 victims, not counting Nadia Marcinkova, whom Epstein
referred to as his “Yugoslavian sex slave” because he had imported her from the Balkans at age 14. Now 24,
