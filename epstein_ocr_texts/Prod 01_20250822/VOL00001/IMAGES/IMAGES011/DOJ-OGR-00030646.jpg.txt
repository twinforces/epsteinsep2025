to model lingerie for a wealthy Palm Beacher. CL was taken to Epstein’s house located on El BrilloWay. Miller
introduced CL to Jeffrey Epstein. Epstein had his personal chef prepare dinner for CL and Miller. At the
conclusion of dinner, Miller and Epstein brought CL upstairs into a master bedroom area. CL observed a large
massage table with a sheet on it. Epstein entered through a door and exited wearing only a towel. Miller
informed CL that they were going to provide a massage on Epstein. CL asked why were they doing this instead
of modeling lingerie. Miller explained to CL that this was his routine and to rub his calves and feet. Epstein had
told CL to get comfortable. CL removed her pants and blouse. CL stated she stayed only in panties as she did
not wear a bra that evening. CL stated while rubbing his calves and feet, Epstein turned over onto his back.
Epstein told CL to rub his chest and rub his nipples. CL stated that as she started rubbing his chest, Epstein
began masturbating himself. Epstein touched her breasts and stroked her vagina with his fingers. Epstein
continued to masturbate himself as he stroked her vagina. Epstein ejaculated on his towel and paid CL $200.00
for the massage. Epstein told CL that if she told anyone what happened at his house that bad things could
happen. CL and Miller were brought home by Epstein’s houseman and CL was afraid that Epstein knew where
she lived. CL stated that several days later she received a telephone call from Sarah Kellen who coordinated for
CL to return to “work.” CL returned to the house and was brought to Epstein’s bedroom area by Sarah who
prepared the room for the massage. Epstein entered the room wearing only a towel. Epstein had CL remove her
clothing and provide the massage naked. CL began rubbing his feet and calves and Epstein turned over onto his
back. Epstein rubbed her vagina with his fingers. Epstein began to masturbate himself with an upwards and
downward motion on his penis. Epstein continued to touch her vagina with one hand and masturbate with the
other hand. Once Epstein ejaculated onto the towel he was wearing, the massage was over. CL was paid
$200.00 for the massage. Epstein again told CL not to speak of what happened at his house or bad things would
happen. CL wanted to notify authorities however she was afraid of what would happen to either her or her
family.

During the course of the investigation, several subjects were identified as a potential witness/victim
through information obtained during the trash pulls, physical surveillance and telephone message books retrieved
from the search warrant. While conducting research on the subjects, I discovered that the females were age
eighteen or older. Interviews were conducted on the consenting adults whose statements provided the same
massage routine when they went to “work” for Epstein. The females would be notified by Sarah Kellen, and
made appointments for the females to “work” for Epstein. The females would come to Epstein’s house and were
led upstairs, through a stairwell from the kitchen area, by Sarah Kellen to Epstein’s bedroom. Epstein would then
enter the room wearing only a towel, and ask them to get comfortable. The females would then provide the
massage naked as Epstein would either touch their vaginas with his fingers and/or utilize the massager/vibrator on
The foregoing instrument was sworn to or affirmed State of Florida
