Honorable Analisa Torres

United States District Court Judge

Southern District of New York

500 Pearl Street

New York, NY 10007

Re: US v. Tova Noel, et al
Docket # 19 cr. 830 (AT)
Order to Release Firearm and any other Property

Dear Judge Torres:

On January 3, 2022, the Court filed the fully executed Nolle Prosequi Order formally

terminating the prosecution and dismissing all criminal charges in the above

referenced criminal action. In November of 2019, Ms. Tova Noel was released with

conditions. One of the conditions required the surrender of her firearm to the New

York City Police Department (NYPD). As required, Ms. Noel promptly surrendered

her firearm to the 44 Precinct of the NYPD in the Bronx.

On January 4, 2022, Ms. Noel went to the 44th Precinct to retrieve her firearm with

a copy of the Nolle Prosequi Order. She was referred to the NYPD property clerk’s

office located in the basement of the Bronx Criminal Court. The NYPD property clerk

was presented with the Nolle Prosequi Order, however, the property clerk refused to

release the firearm. The NYPD property clerk indicated that they would only release

the firearm pursuant to a court order.

Attached is a proposed order mandating the release of Ms. Noel’s firearm and any

other property that was surrendered as a condition of release. I have spoken with

the Government regarding this application, and they have no objection. Thank you

for your thoughtful consideration.

Sincerely,

FOY & SEPLOWITZ LLC
