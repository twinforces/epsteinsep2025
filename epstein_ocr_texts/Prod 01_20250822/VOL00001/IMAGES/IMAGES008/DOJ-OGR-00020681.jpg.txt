10/31/2021 400 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motion under
Federal Rule of Evidence 412, Dkt. No. 378, and the Defendant's motion in limine to
exclude under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), Dkt. No. 386. The issues raised in the two
motions overlap significantly. The Court is required under Federal Rule of Evidence 412
to conduct an in camera hearing. Fed. R. Evid. 412 ("Before admitting evidence under
this rule, the court must conduct an in camera hearing and give the victim and parties a
right to attend and be heard. Unless the court orders otherwise, the motion, related
materials, and the record of the hearing must remain under seal.). In addition, the Court
has determined it will conduct a Daubert hearing with respect to the Defendant's motion
under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Because of the overlap in the substance of the
motions, the Court will conduct the two proceedings back to back. The Court previously
set a tentative date for the Rule 412 Motion hearing as November 5, 2021. Dkt. No. 354.
The Court is prepared to proceed with both hearings on that date. Alternatively, the
proceedings could be held on either the afternoon of November 9 or the afternoon of
November 10. The Government shall confer with its proposed expert regarding
availability for the Daubert hearing as well as with alleged victims who wish to attend
and be heard at the Rule 412 Motion hearing. After doing so, the parties shall confer with
each other as to availability. On or before November 2, 2021, the parties shall jointly file
a letter with the Court indicating whether the parties request that the hearings be held on
November 5, 9, or 10. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 10/31/2021)

11/01/2021 401 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' proposed
redactions to the parties' motions in limine, responses in opposition, replies in support,
and related exhibits. As the Court indicated at today's conference, some of the partiesâ€™
proposed redactions are overbroad considering the three-part test articulated by the
Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). In
