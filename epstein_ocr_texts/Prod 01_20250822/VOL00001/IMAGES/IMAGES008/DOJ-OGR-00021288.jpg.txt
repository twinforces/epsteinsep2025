a proposal. regarding the: special :master’s :responsibilities, along witha draft letter-to send, to the
Special.master explaining’ the procedure for selecting an.attorney representative:

Lefkowitz objected to this proposal ina letter to Villafana, pointing out that the NPA did.
not provide: for the ‘appointment ‘of ‘a ‘special ° ‘master. More importantly, Lefkowitz used the:
discussion:of:the special master as an opening to press for other alterations to the language of the:
NPA or: at: least, to its interpr etation. Focusing on the attorney representative, Lefkowitz argued
that the attorney’s role-should be:viewed.as limited,to negotiating settlements and that:the:attorney
was precluded, from. filing lawsuits on behalf of victinis who could not, reach, a negotiated
settlement with:Epstein. Lefkowitz proposed:

[T]heselected attorney should evaluate the.claims of:cach identified.
‘individual, negotiate .a, total fund. amount with Mr. Epstein, then.
identified. individuals who elect not to settle with Mr: Epstein, they:
may ‘proceed on theirown, but by doing so,'they would not be suing
under § ‘2255 as contemplated by [the NPA] and therefore may not.
continue to be represented by'the selected: attorney.

Lefkowit7 also: objected to Villafana’s draft letter to the special master, assciting that it was.
essential for the defense to participate ‘in. crafting a “mutually acceptable communication” to the:
victims. Going, further, Lefkowitz claimed that: any contact, between the USAO and the victims
about the §:.2255 provision would. violate the agreement’s confidentiality provision. Lefkowitz,
admonished ‘the government :not to contact ‘the victims “to inform them of the resolution of the:
cas¢, including [the] appointment of the ‘selected attorney andthe settlement process.”

Villafana forwarded Lefkeivitz’s letter to Sloman, complaining, that the defense:
interpretation of: the $2255 procedure:violated. the clear language: of the NPA ‘and asking, “Can I.
please justiindict him [Epstein]?” Days later, Sanchez emailed, Sloman, and then sent a follow-up
letter, asking'that Sloman help resolve” the issue regarding the attorney representative’s role, and
arguing that:Epstein had:never intended by signing the NPA to:promise to:pay fees for the-victims?
civil, lawsuits in.the:event a settlement-could-not be‘reached. When Villafana explained to Sloman
her, views on Sanchez’s arguments, Sloman responded, “I suggest that: you communicate. your:
proposal Back to [Sanchez]. The more: ‘voices’ they hear the niore wedges they try to drive
between-us.” Villafatia agreed, noting that “[t]here are so many-of them over 'there,.I.am afraid:we
are getting triple-teamed. 136

Villafana senti Sanchez a letter regarding the roles of the Special master ahd. attorney
representative. The next day, October’ 10, 2007, Lefkowitz sent.a six-page letter to. Acosta, asa.
“follow. up: to our conversation ‘yesterday,” expressing “serious disagreements” with Villafatia’s
view of the’process for victims to clainy §: 2255 damages under the NPA. Lefkowitz.reiterated the.
defense ‘position. that. the attorney representative’s role: was ‘meant to be limited to negotiating,
settlements forthe victims, ‘rather than pursuing litigation. Lefkowitz claimed ‘that:a-requirement:

36 Villafaiia-also- alerted Sloman that a-néwspaperswas ‘reporting that defense coutisel was writing a letter to-

Acostaasking for.reconsideration of the requirement that Epstein register-as.a sexual offender. Villafatia commented,
“Itappears they don tunderstand ‘that a signed contracts’ binding.”
