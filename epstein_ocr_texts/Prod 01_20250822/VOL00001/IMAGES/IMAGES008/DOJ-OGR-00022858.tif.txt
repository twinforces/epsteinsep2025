1 TODD BLANCHE: No, I understand.
2 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Okay. Thank you. I
3 just want to be clear that I'm not trying to be cute
4 or anything.
5 But -- and I did look for masseuses, I --
6 I did. I went to spas and if I met somebody who said
7 she was a masseuse, I did not check their
8 credentials. And of course, if she was attractive, I
9 did introduce her, yes.
10 If I met friends who were interested, he
11 was constantly asking me for -- to meet new and
12 interesting people. I did -- I did do that.
13 At the time, I viewed it as -- well, first
14 of all, part of my job, I think, or part of my
15 responsibility, if you were, to introduce -- because
16 it wasn't just women. If I met somebody who was
17 interesting, like Murray Gell-Mann or who I thought
18 he would like, I did that. So it's not exclusively,
19 but he did. And I did do that.
20 TODD BLANCHE: So -- but then -- so I want
21 to layer on top of what you just said, what we talked
22 about yesterday more, but a little bit today already,
23 which is everybody that was around him besides you,
24 like his friends.
25 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Right.
