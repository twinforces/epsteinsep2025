Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page73 of 113.

2. The District Court’s application, of § 3283 creates “impermissible
retroactive effects” without authorization from Congress

Even. if the text and legislative history of § 3283 were unclear, Landgraf’s
“presumption, against statutory retroactivity” would foreclose retroactive operation
of this statute at step two. 511 U.S. at 293. Because “retroactive application
[must] be avoided ‘absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result,”
which. is: lacking here, the District Court’s retroactive application. of § 3283 must
be reversed. Enterprise, 391 F.3d at 410 (quoting Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280).

Were this Court to hold otherwise, it would. stand in conflict with the Third
Circuit. In US. v. Richardson, 512 ‘F:2d 105 (3d Cir. 1975), the Third Circuit
rejected the retroactive application of a. criminal statute of limitations, citing both a.
general presumption. against retroactivity similar to. what the Supreme Court'would
later echo in, Landgraf, and the more specific canon. in, favor of repose articulated
in. Joussie. See Richardson, 512.F.2d at 106.

Although Richardson, was decided before Landgraf, courts continue to
follow its holding that criminal statutes of limitations are presumed not to apply
retroactively, even as 'to conduct.'that fell within the limitations period and. could
have been prosecuted at the time of enactment. See U.S. v. Gentile, 235 F.Supp.3d
at 655-56 (holding that expansion of securities fraud,statute of limitations didnot
apply retrospectively although. the limitations period in his case had not. yet: expired

when, statute was ‘expanded); U.S. v. Schneider, C.A. No. 10-29, 2010. WL
