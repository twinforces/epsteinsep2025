with one of Epstein’s defense attorneys about it. Sloman told OPR during his interview that he
“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The documentary evidence confirms that he had at
least some contemporaneous knowledge of the issue—when asked by Villafafia whether to put off
a September 12, 2007 hearing on the litigation, he told her to do so. Finally, as noted previously,
the FBI co-case agent proposed at a meeting with USAO personnel that the USAO wait until the
litigation was resolved before pursuing plea negotiations.

Contemporaneous records show that Acosta was likely aware before the NPA was signed
of the USAO’s efforts to obtain custody of Epstein’s computers and that after the NPA was signed,
he was informed about the use of legal process for obtaining the computer equipment. The NPA
itself provides that “the federal . . . investigation will be suspended, and all pending [legal process]
will be held in abeyance,” that Epstein will withdraw his “motion to intervene and to quash certain
[legal process],” and, further, that the parties would “maintain . . . evidence subject to [legal
process] that have been issued, and including certain computer equipment, inviolate” until the
NPA’s terms had been fully satisfied, at which point the legal process would be “deemed
withdrawn.” (Emphasis added.) Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final draft suggest that he
gave it a close read, and OPR expects that Acosta would not have approved the agreement without
understanding what legal process his office was agreeing to withdraw, or why the only type of
evidence specified was “certain computer equipment.” In addition, Acosta told OPR that he
worked closely with Sloman and Menchel, consulted with them, and relied on their counsel about
the case. Among other things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about the law and the
evidentiary issues presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that
Sloman made the decision to postpone the hearing concerning the USAO’s efforts to obtain the
computer equipment without consulting Acosta, once Acosta reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was
on notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning Epstein’s missing computer
equipment.

Villafafia knew where the computers were; litigation over the demand for the equipment
was already underway; there was good reason to believe the computers contained relevant—and
potentially critical—information; and it was clear Epstein did not want the contents of his
computers disclosed. Nothing in the available record reveals that the USAO benefitted from
abandoning pursuit of this evidence when they did, or that there was any significant consideration
of the costs and benefits of forgoing the litigation to obtain production of the computers.?”4
Instead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to abandon its efforts to obtain evidence that
could have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation with a state
guilty plea or led to additional significant federal charges. By agreeing to postpone the litigation,
the USAO gave away leverage that might have caused the defense to come to an agreement much
earlier and on terms more favorable to the government. The USAO ultimately agreed to a term in
the NPA that permanently ended the government’s ability to obtain possible evidence of significant
crimes and did so with apparently little serious consideration of the potential cost.
2s4 If the USAO had significant concerns about its likelihood of prevailing, postponing the litigation to use it as
leverage in the negotiations might have been strategically reasonable. Lourie suggested in his response to his interview
transcript that the court might have precluded production of the computers. However, OPR saw no evidence indicating
that Villafafia or her supervisors were concerned that the court would do so, and Villafafia had consulted with the
Department’s subject matter experts before initiating her action to obtain the equipment.
