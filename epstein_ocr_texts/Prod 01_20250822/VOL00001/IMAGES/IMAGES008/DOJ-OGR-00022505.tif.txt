1 TODD BLANCHE: Did you -- well, you talk
2 about entourage flying, right now we're talking about
3 to the island. Did you observe any sexual, I was
4 going to say misconduct, but any sexual -- any sex at
5 all whatsoever on the plane?
6 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Never on the plane,
7 no.
8 TODD BLANCHE: Was there a part of the
9 plane that was closed off from others where
10 Mr. Epstein could go and get a massage or whatever?
11 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Yeah. Okay. So
12 that's a good question. So there were two planes.
13 So you had the -- there was a Gulfstream, and that's
14 open plan. So anything -- I mean, there was a sofa
15 that turned into a bed. And he did sleep on that.
16 And then -- but in the Boeing, which he
17 flew on a lot, there was -- his area could be closed
18 off with a door. And behind that door there would
19 be -- there was a bedroom and an office. So if that
20 door was shut, you wouldn't see it.
21 TODD BLANCHE: But do you -- so if you
22 never -- so -- but you never observed Mr. Epstein
23 engaging in sex or getting a massage with somebody --
24 with whether the masseuse was not clothed on the
25 plane?
