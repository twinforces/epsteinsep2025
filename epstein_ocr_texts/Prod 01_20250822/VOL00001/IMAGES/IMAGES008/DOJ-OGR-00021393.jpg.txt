OLG concluded that because the CVRA. defines, ““‘crime:victim’ as a “person directly and
proximately haftied. by. the coninission of a Fedéral offense,’ . . ; the definition of victii is thus
tethered to: the identification. of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event that occurs with. the filing, ofa
cottiplaint:” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated'that;the CVRA codifies
the: “rights of crime: victims in. the: Federal. judicial system?” ‘and a. complaint. “commences. the:
‘judicial process’ and places an offense within the ‘judicial system,” the legislature must have:
intended for CVRA.rights to commence upon the filing of a complaint.

OLE also found. that the: language of the CVRA rights supported its Interpretation. For
example, the:first right grants a victim protection.from“theaccused,”:not.a suspect. Additionally,
the second, third, and ‘fourth rights refer’to “victim notification, and access to, public:procecdings
‘involving, release, plea, sentencing or ‘parole—none of which. commence prior to the filing of'a
complaint:”
