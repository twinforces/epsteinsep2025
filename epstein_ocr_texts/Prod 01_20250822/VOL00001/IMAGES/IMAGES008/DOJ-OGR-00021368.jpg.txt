Lourie described the. promise. not to: prosecute “potential. co-conspirators” as “unusual,” and told.
OPR. that he did not. know’ why it was included in the agreciment, but. addéd that itwould be “unlike
mecif [read that language to just leave it in-there unless J thought it was:somchow- helpful. ” Lourie:
posited that Victims who recruited other underage girls. to ‘provide inassages for Epstein.

“theoretically” could. have been charged.as co-conspirators. He told OPR. that when he ‘saw the

provision, he inay have Understood the reference ‘to ‘unnhained “co-conspirators” as “a message 'to
any victims that had-recruited other victims that:there was ‘no. intent to: charge them.”

Acosta, did. not ‘recall. any discussions’ about. the non- “pr osecution provision. But. he told.
OPR. that Epstein. was: always “the focus” of the federal. inv. estigation, and. he: would have:viewed
the. federal interests as vindicated. as long’ as. Epstein was required. to face. “meaningful.
consequences” for his actions. Acosta told OPR. that when. he reviewed the draft NPA, “[t]o the.
extent [ reviewed this co-conspirator provision; I cai speculate thatmy thinking*would have been.
the: focus. is on. Epstein[|] ..... going to jail. Whether some of his employees go. to jail, or other,
lesser involved [individuals], is not. the focus of this.” Acosta also told .OPR that! he adsstiined.
Villafatia and Lourie had considered the: provision ‘and decided. that it was appropriate. ‘Finally,
Sloman, whorwas not:involved in:negotiating the NPA, told OPR. that in retrospect, he-understood.
the: non; prosecution’ ‘provision, was designed to 'protect. Epstein’s four assistants, and. it “never
dawned” on him that it-was intended to shield anyone else.

This broad ‘provision. promising not to prosecute: “any: potential. cO- -conspirators” is
troubling-and, as discussed more fully'later in.this Report, OPR. did:not-findevidence showing-that!
the: subjects gave careful. consideration to the ‘potential. scope of the provision or whether. it was.
warranted, given that the investigation had been curtailed and the USAO lacked complete
information regarding possible co- ‘onspirators. Villafaria. precipitously revised a more narrow
provision sought by-the defense. Given ‘its evolution. from a provision sought by, the defense, it:
appears unlikely | to have been designed.to protect. the victims, ‘and there:is no indication that at.the.
time, the subjects: believed:that was the: purpose.. However, the USAO had not indicated interest:
in prosecuting anyone other than the four ‘named female assistants, and OPR found no ‘record
‘indicating that.Epstein had, expressed. concern about the:prosecutive fate of anyone other:than the
‘four assistants and ‘unnaried. employees: of a; specific Epstein. company. Accordingly,. OPR.
concludes that the evidence does :not.show. that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafafia: agreed to the :non-
prosecution provision to protect. any of Epstcin’s political, celebrity, or other influential,
associates.**?
