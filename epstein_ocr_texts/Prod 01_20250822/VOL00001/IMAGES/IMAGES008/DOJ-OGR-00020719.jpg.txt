04/01/2022 653 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court concludes that Juror 50
testified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his prior
sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not deliberate.
The Court further concludes that Juror 50 harbored no bias toward the Defendant and
could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new trial under
McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 33
is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the presentence investigation
report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby excludes time under the Speedy
Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(A), from today's date through April 22, 2022. The
Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting this exclusion from speedy trial
computations outweigh the interests of the public and the Defendant in a speedy trial on
these counts because the pending post-trial motions affect the scheduling considerations
set forth in the Government's January 10, 2022 letter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant
consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 650. The Court will rule on the Defendant's
remaining post-verdict motions in due course. Sentencing remains scheduled for June 28,
2022. This resolves docket numbers 613, 614, 642, 650, and 651. (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 4/1/2022) (See ORDER set forth) (ap) (Entered: 04/01/2022)

04/26/2022 656 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter
regarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.
No. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that advancing
the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their sentencing
submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing submission
schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly, the Court
ORDERS the following schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2022 - First PSR disclosure;
May 31, 2022 - Defendant objections due; June 6, 2022 - Government response due; June
