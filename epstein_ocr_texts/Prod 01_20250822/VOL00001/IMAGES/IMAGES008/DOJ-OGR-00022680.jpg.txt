asking ime, I believe started in the 2000s.

TODD BLANCHE: In the 2000 time period?

GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Yeah. 2000.

TODD BLANCHE: Why do you -- why: do you
think --

‘GHISLAINE MAXWELL: 2000.

TODD BLANCHE: Like what -- what in your
mind makes you think that that's the time that it —
started?

GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I think because. in
December of 2001, he met POVINSEAGWION And I
think POUREDAGUION was responsible for thatin
its entirety.

And the reason I believe that, so this --

‘she ++ she was'a sélf-confessed having been sexually
abused as a young girl, and was trained -- her words:
I'm quoting now, not mine: in all the.arts of

whatever that is, the sex-program by a man called Ron
Eppinger, who was her pimp from when she was 14, I
believe, or 15, I don't know.

And in her book describes him training her
to be.what-every. man’ wants in‘all its manners,
fellatio and everything else. I believe that then
what happened was that he met her, and she came as.a
itiassetise to his house, in December of 2001 is when I

think it'started.:

Now, what their.relationship was or what
happened with them in that early period of time, I
cannot say. What I can say is that he liked her and.
she started to travel-with him at that time period.

I beliéve -- I know, then, what happened
was that she:-- when she first started to see him or
first came into his orbit-as his masseuse or
whatever, she was engaged to be married and wearing
an engagement ring, and was living with her fianc?..

She broké up after a'few months,:with her
fianc?, and took up with the local.drug dealer. So.
let's say after four. or five months of --.in the time
period when she was seeing Epstein, let's say we're
now May, June of 2002 or is it 2000. I can't
remember,

From whenever she hits the -- whatever
that is if that's 2000: I think it's 2000. I'm
sorry. I think it's when she met him. December of
2000. So -- so’then you go through -- I don't
remember. You'll have to:look.

TODD BLANCHE: Okay. I'm not'holding you
to exact dates. I'm-not --

trying to -- I'm giving the --

TODD'BLANCHE: -- I] appreciate:
GHISLAINE: MAXWELL: ‘So then I think -- so
she:-~ she takes up with the local drug dealer and

-she becomes druggie, druggie.. Like, you know, how
druggies -+ well, maybe you.don't. Live with a lot

in Tallahassée.. They. become even more unreliable:

‘than normal.

And at some point, she's now working

‘somewhere else. He stopped seeing her, because he
‘doesn't like people who do drugs. And] think that
‘not seeing: her lasted five’or six-months. And in

that period of time, she got arrested for theft, and
she had a warrant out for het attest:

Now, this I've pieced together because
this piece J didn't know. She then called-Epstein
to,-- to have help:avoiding the warrant for her:

arrest, and he sent her to Thailand to get a massage
‘therapy license. This is the bit that I guess: This

is the bit that I extrapolated.
In the period of time from when she came
back to when she left, he. asked her. to replace

herself'as his masseuse or whatever -- whatever she

was doing, and she brought the first replacement for

-her., That would've been one-of the accusers in:my

‘case, I think, would've. been POY NSDASUUTON

TODD BLANCHE: So before her --:

LEAH SAFFIAN:. Tony Figueroa.

GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Toni Figueroa is her

‘boyfriend..

TODD .BLANCHE: Before.her --'so‘now going.
back in thie'90s. You don't believe that'Mr: Epstein
was abusing ‘masseuses?

DAVID:-MARKUS: Underage?

TODD BLANCHE: Or over age? [ mean, I
‘think -- well, I'm using abuse in the broadest sense
of word; because I'm assuming that you ~ you --

‘you ---you'-- you -- you said that you have no idea

of the year. ~ you-- you always assumed the masseuses.

“were over age; right?

GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I did.
TODD. BLANCHE: So when I'm talking about

-abuse; I'm even talking about an:adult masseuse who

their clothes, told they're not going to get paid if
