noted that the:revised.charges involved 19 victims, so the defense:proposal for a.15-month-sentence
amounted to less.than.one month per victim: Villafaria requested that “whatever'the U.S. Attorney”
decides: to do,” the: agreement with Epstein should.“follow.... . a version of my written non-

prosecution agrécinent” in. ofder ‘to “avoid aiy state shenanigans and.. ... keep the défense on a,
strict timeline.”

Later that day, Villafana circulated, to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called fora,
20-month. jail. sentence to ‘be followed ‘by 10, months of’ home confinement. This redrafted NPA.
contained. a provision that specified, “With credit, for ‘gain time, Epstein shall serve’ at, least.
17. months: in.a state: correctional. institution.”!"4 Acosta reviewed the revised NPA. and amended
it to. include a staternent-clarifying that it;was Epstein’s. obligation “to: undertake discussions. with.
the State of Florida'to.ensure.compliance with.these:procedures:” Villafania sent:her version.of the:
revised NPA to: Lefcourt: that afternoon and. forwarded Acosta’s proposed. change to, him the
‘following: day,, after she: learned of it.

On, September 1,1, 2007,-the court contacted Villafana to inquire whether the USAO' would.
be prepared ‘to proceed with the litigation. concerning the. computers the following, day. At
Sloman’s direction, Villafafia-asked'the court to delay ‘the > hearing, and the: court: rescheduled it:for:
the: following week, At. the same time, anticipating that. plea negotiations would. fail, Villafatia
circulated .a, revised, iAdicterit to heF -co-counsél. and Oosterbaan, secking theif feedback before

told him. she ‘was “still shooting, for 9/25” to bring charges, asstiming the defense declined. the:
USAO’s offer. Oosterbaan. responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I ‘suppose it’s

“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 30-month ‘sentence, split 20 in jail, and. 10 in,
‘community: control,” and agree: that.the: girls are: Victims: for purposes of damages. ‘Wealso put in.

B. September 12, 2007: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State

Although the USAO and. defense counsel had been. discussing resolving the federal.
Investigation with a plea to state char ges,, there is.no evidence that the USAO involved the State
Attornéy’s Office in those discussions until September 12,2007. On that day, Lourie, Villafana,
and another USAO. supervisor who would be replacing Lourie: as ‘manager of the: USAO?s West
Palin Beach office, and Epstein attorneys Lefkowitz, Lefeourt, and Goldberger met with State:
Attorney Barry Krischer ‘and Assistant State Attorney. Lanna, Belohlavek: Other than Villafana,
few. of the:participants had any memory. of, the meeting or the results ofit. The available evidence
indicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the mecting.
