noted that the revised charges involved 19 victims, so the defense proposal for a 15-month sentence
amounted to less than one month per victim. Villafafia requested that “whatever the U.S. Attorney
decides to do,” the agreement with Epstein should “follow ... a version of my written non-
prosecution agreement” in order to “avoid any state shenanigans and .. . keep the defense on a
strict timeline.”

Later that day, Villafafia circulated to Acosta and Sloman a revised NPA that called for a
20-month jail sentence to be followed by 10 months of home confinement. This redrafted NPA
contained a provision that specified, “With credit for gain time, Epstein shall serve at least
17 months in a state correctional institution.”'°* Acosta reviewed the revised NPA and amended
it to include a statement clarifying that it was Epstein’s obligation “to undertake discussions with
the State of Florida to ensure compliance with these procedures.” Villafafia sent her version of the
revised NPA to Lefcourt that afternoon and forwarded Acosta’s proposed change to him the
following day, after she learned of it.

On September 11, 2007, the court contacted Villafafia to inquire whether the USAO would
be prepared to proceed with the litigation concerning the computers the following day. At
Sloman’s direction, Villafafia asked the court to delay the hearing, and the court rescheduled it for
the following week. At the same time, anticipating that plea negotiations would fail, Villafafia
circulated a revised indictment to her co-counsel and Oosterbaan, seeking their feedback before
sending it “through the chain of command.” Villafafia also sent Oosterbaan the revised NPA and
told him she was “still shooting for 9/25” to bring charges, assuming the defense declined the
USAO’s offer. Oosterbaan responded, “The counter-offering is unfortunate, but I suppose it’s
understandable.” !°°

That afternoon, Lourie asked Villafafia, “What is our latest offer?” Villafafia responded,
“Plead to the three specified [state] charges, a 30-month sentence, split 20 in jail and 10 in
‘community control,’ and agree that the girls are victims for purposes of damages. We also put in
deadlines for a plea and sentencing date.”

B. September 12, 2007: The USAO and Defense Counsel Meet with the State

Attorney

Although the USAO and defense counsel had been discussing resolving the federal
investigation with a plea to state charges, there is no evidence that the USAO involved the State
Attorney’s Office in those discussions until September 12, 2007. On that day, Lourie, Villafafia,
and another USAO supervisor who would be replacing Lourie as manager of the USAO’s West
Palm Beach office, and Epstein attorneys Lefkowitz, Lefcourt, and Goldberger met with State
Attorney Barry Krischer and Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek. Other than Villafafia,
few of the participants had any memory of the meeting or the results of it. The available evidence
indicates that the USAO made additional concessions during the meeting.

10 Through “gain time,” Florida inmates can earn a reduction in their sentence for good behavior.
105 Oosterbaan told OPR that he did not recall having read the NPA at this juncture and “had no involvement
with it.”
