‘initiate a federal prosecution. of Epstein was within the scope of ‘his; authority, and. OPR. did, not:
‘find evidence that: his decision was based on cottuption. of other impermissible considerations,
such as Epstein’s wealth, status, or. associations. Evidence shows that Acosta resisted defense
efforts ‘to have the. ihatter retuthed ‘to the state for whatever ‘result. state authorities deeried
appropriate, and he: ‘refused. to eliminate the incarceration and. sexual offender registration
requiremerits., OPR did not find evidence establishing that. Acosta’s. “break fast-mecting” with one
of Epstein’ s:defense counsel:in October:2007 led tothe. NPA, which-had been signed weeks earlier,
or to any other significant ‘decision that ‘benefited Epstein. The contemporancous records: show:
that USAO managers’ concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and’the impact of a trial on
the-victims led them to-prefer'a. pre-charge resolution.and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper
role of the federal governinent in, prosecuting solicitation, crimes resulted. in, his preference for a,
state-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR. does.:not find that Acosta engaged. in professional.
misconduct by’ resolving: the federal, investigation of, Epstein. i in, the way he did or that ‘the other
subjects committed: ‘professional misconduct through: their implementation. of Acosta’s decisions:

Nevertheless, ORR. ‘concludes that: Acosta’s. decision. to ‘resolve the federal investigation
through the NPA. constitutes ‘poor judgment. Although. ‘this decision was within the scope of.
Acosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not.find that it resulted. front improper factors, the: NPA.
was a. flawed.mechanism for satisfying:the federal interest.that.caused the: government to open. its:
investigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’ '§ role: In, prosecuting, Epstein.
was limited by. principles of federalism,-under which the: independent authority of:the state should
be recognized, and the federal responsibility in this situation was ‘to serve as a “backstop” to: state
authorities: by encouraging: them. to do more. However, Acosta failed to: consider the difficulties
inherent in a resolution that:relied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had
no authority; he resolved. the federal investigation before significant investigative steps were:
completed: and he agréed to, several ‘unusual, and, problematic. terms in the NPA without the
consideration ‘required under ‘the ‘circumstances. In. sum, A’costa’s application. of federalism.
principles Was too expansive, his View of the federal interesti-in. prosecuting Epstein was too
narrow, ‘and his understanding of the: state. system was too imperfect: to justify the decision, to use
the NPA. Furthermore, because. Acosta assumed. a significant:role in reviewing and drafting the:
NPA and the other'three: subjects who were:supervisors left the USAO, were‘transitioning’to other
jobs, or:were absent at critical junctures,.Acosta should.have: ensured more effective coordination,
and communication during the negotiations: and before approving’ ‘the final NPA., The NPA ‘was a.
unique resolution, and.one that required-greater oversight and, supervision.than. Acosta provided.

B. _ Findings and. Conclusions. Relating to the Government’s Interactions with,
Victims

OPR. further concludes that none: of; the subject attorneys committed professional.
misconduct with respect tothe governiment’s interactions with victitiis. The subjects did not-have
a clear ‘and unambiguous duty‘under the CVRA. to: consult with victims before entering into the:
NPA. because the. USAO resolved ‘the Epstcii investigation ‘without; a federal. criminal
charge. Significantly, at the time. the NPA was signed, the Department did not interpret CVRA.
rights, to attach, ‘inless and until federal charges had, been filed, and the federal courts: had not!
established a clear and unambiguous standard applying the CVRA before criminal charges. were
brought. In.addition, OPR did not find. evidence ‘that.the lack of consultation was forthe purpose
of silencing victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was part. of a series of government.
