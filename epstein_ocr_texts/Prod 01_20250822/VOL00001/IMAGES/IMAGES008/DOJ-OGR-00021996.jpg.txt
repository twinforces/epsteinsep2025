Re: State of NY v Michael Thomas, et al.
Docket No.: 1:19-cr-00830
Adjournment Request

Dear Hon. Judge Torres:

Pursuant to the Court’s request, I am making a written request that the April 20, 2020
trial date be adjourned for at least 6 months. Firstly, the government in this matter sent out
discovery on or about December 31, 2019. It was received in my office over the holiday break
when no one was working. Thereafter, there was an issue with me being able to access the drive
containing all of the information proffered by the government because we were given the wrong
password by the government. Accordingly, I have had only about two weeks to review the
voluminous discovery provided.

The discovery ostensibly contains approximately 25,000 documents and hundreds of
hours of video footage. In order to effectively represent my client, I will need at least an
additional 60 days to review the discovery and discuss it with my client. Thereafter, I will still
need to conduct an investigation based on the information and witness statements detailed in the
discovery. Such an undertaking will take at the minimum another 60 days. As the Court can see,
it will take me 90 days or more before I am in a position to know what additional discovery may
be needed or what motions are appropriate. Additionally, this timeline doesn’t even account for
issues regarding subpoenas, requests for additional discovery and attempting to locate witnesses
or hire experts.
