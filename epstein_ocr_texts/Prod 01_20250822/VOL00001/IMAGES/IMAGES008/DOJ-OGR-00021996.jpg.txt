‘Re: State of NYv Michael Thomas, et al.
Docket.No.: 1:19-cr-00830:
Adjournment Request

Dear Hon. Judge Torres:

Pursuant. to the Court’s request, I am :making a ‘written request that ‘the April 20, 2020
trial date be adjourned for at Icast 6 months.. Firstly, the government ‘in. this matter ‘sent. out.
‘discovery on or about. December 3:1, 201.9. It was received in my office over the: holiday break
when :no ofic was, Working. Thereafter, there was an. issue with me being able to access the drive
containing all of the information proffered. by the government because we were given the wrong’
password ‘by the ‘government. Accordingly, I have ‘had only about, two wecks ‘to ‘review the
voluminous discovery provided.

The discovery ostensibly contains. approximately 25,000 documents and hundreds of
hours, of video, footage. In order to effectively represent my client, I ‘will, need. at Icast. ain,
additional 60 days to review’ the discovery: and. discuss it. with my: clicnt. Thereafter, Iwill still
need. to conduct. an, investigation. based. on the information and witness. statements. detailed. in the
‘discovery. Such an,undertaking will. take at the minimum. another 60. days. A's the Court can sec,
it ‘will, take me 90, days or more before J am in a ‘position to. know’what additional discovery may’
be needed or what: motions are appropriate. Additionally, ‘this ‘timeline doesn’t even account for:
‘1ssucs regarding subpoenas, requests for additional discovery’ and attempting to locate witnesses
‘or hire experts.
