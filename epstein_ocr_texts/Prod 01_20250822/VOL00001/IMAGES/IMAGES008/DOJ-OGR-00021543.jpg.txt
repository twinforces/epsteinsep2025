The. Court concludes that the Defendant:has:not made a showing, that any. pre-hearing
discovery is appropriate, and.the: request to.engage in an. intrusive fishing expedition. is denied.
C.. The Court will'release Juror 50’s questionnaire
questionnaire to counsel, but that the document otherwise remain under’seal.to protect, his
supposed privacy interest. See Dkt. No.. 596 at-5 nol, The Defendant-opposes both the unsealing
and releasing the questionnaire to counsel; arguing that “advance. disclosure .... will
undoubt[edly] color Juror No. 50’s testimony and.allow him to place himself inthe best! possible
posture.” Maxwell. Br: at:53. "The Government. argues that there:is no: legitimate interest in
limiting Juror 50’s access and. opposes maintaining the questionnaire under seal. Gov. Br. at.42:
see.also Dkt. No. 594.

The. Court will provide Juror 50 a.copy of his completed questionnaire. Unlike the
parties’ ‘proposed questions, Juror 50’s: access:to his.completed questionnaire—the answers to
which-he wrote—will not undermine'the integrity of the inquiry. The Defendant’s concern that
advance disclosure: may somehow. taint Juror. 50’s testimony is unfounded. See United States. v.
McCoy etal., No, 14-CR-6181 (EAW), Dkt. No. 329; at.15 (W.D.N-Y¥. June 2, 2017) (providing
the jury questionnaire to juror’s counsel. in advance of the hearing), Rather, delaying disclosure
until the hearing would ‘needlessly delay the fact-finding process.

Moreover, the Court-coneludes thatthe presumption of access’ dictates that the
queStionnaire must be docketed., Juror.50’s and the Defendant’s request:thatthe questionnaire
remain.séaléd is governed by the three-part test articulated: bythe Second Circuit in. Lugosch v.
Pyramid Go. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 1:10. (2d Cir. 2006). See Dkt. No. ‘596 at.2 (outlining. the

test). First, the jury questionnaire:easily. qualifies as:a judicial document. .It:is;a‘key exhibit:to
