proposed redactions by April 23, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
Nathan on 4/23/2021) (nl) (Entered: 04/23/2021)

04/23/2021 242 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 22, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell filed
her response to the Court's April 21, 2021 Order, Dkt. No. 221, under temporary seal with
proposed redactions. The proposed redactions are GRANTED. The Court's conclusion is
guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co.
of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (11) assess the weight of the
common law presumption of access to the materials; and (111) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. The Court concludes that
these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law
presumptions of access attach. In balancing competing considerations against the
presumption of access, however, the Court finds that the proposed redactions are
narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of defense lawyersâ€™ clients in other
matters and to allow defense counsel to comply with their professional obligations under
the rules of professional conduct. The Defendant is ORDERED to docket the redacted
version of her letter by April 23, 2021. The Defendant is further ORDERED to docket the
basis for the redaction request, originally sent by email, on ECF by April 23, 2021. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/23/2021) (nl) (Entered: 04/23/2021)
