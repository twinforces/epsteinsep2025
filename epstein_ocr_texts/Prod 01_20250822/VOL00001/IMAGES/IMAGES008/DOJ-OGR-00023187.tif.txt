been concerned about policy and federalism issues.””! Sloman told OPR that although he did not
remember specific conversations, he generally recalled that Acosta had been “sensitive to” Petite
policy and federalism concerns, which Sloman described as whether the USAO was “overstepping
our bounds by taking what is a traditional state case that was in the State Attorney’s Office that
was resolved by the State Attorney’s Office at some level.” During his OPR interview, Menchel
remembered that Acosta approached the case from “a broader policy perspective” and was worried
about “the impact that taking the case in federally may have on . . . other programs,” although
Menchel did not recall specifically what those programs were.

C. Other Significant Factors Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion That the

Subjects’ Actions Were Motivated by Improper Influences

OPR considered additional aspects of the Epstein case that were inconsistent with a
suggestion that Acosta’s decision to offer the July 31, 2007 terms was driven by corruption, a
desire to provide an improper benefit to Epstein, or other improper influences.

First, OPR considered highly significant the fact that if Acosta’s primary motivation was
to benefit Epstein, he had an option even more favorable to Epstein available to him. The NPA
required Epstein to serve time in jail and register as a sexual offender, and provided a mechanism
for the victims to seek monetary damages—outcomes unlikely if the matter had been abandoned
and sent back to the state for whatever result state authorities deemed appropriate. Epstein’s
attorneys had vehemently argued to the USAO that there was no federal interest in the investigation
and that his conduct was exclusively a matter of state concern. If the USAO had declined to
intervene in the case, as Epstein’s counsel repeatedly and strongly argued it should, the state would
have meted out the sole punishment for his behavior. Under the state’s original plan, Epstein likely
would have received a sentence of probation. Menchel described such a result as a mere “slap on
the wrist,” with “no jail time, no felony sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] no
restitution for the victims.” Instead of acceding to Epstein’s proposal, however, the USAO devised
a resolution of the federal investigation that, although widely criticized as inadequate to address
the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct, nevertheless penalized Epstein more than a guilty plea to the
state’s original charge, standing alone, would have done. Acosta’s affirmative decision to
intervene and to compel a more stringent and just resolution than the state had proposed, rather
than exercising his discretion to quietly decline prosecution, is strong circumstantial evidence that
he was not acting for the purpose of benefiting Epstein.*”” Similarly, despite defense counsel’s
repeated requests to eliminate the sexual offender registration requirement, Acosta refused to
221 Sloman stated that although Acosta “was sensitive to [P]etite policy concerns, federalism concerns, . . . | was
not.” Menchel commented, “I don’t think it would have been a concern of mine.”

222 Menchel also pointed out during his OPR interview that Acosta was Republican and “had nothing to gain”
by showing favoritism to Epstein, who had been portrayed in the media as “this big Democratic donor.” Villafafia
recounted for OPR an exchange between the USAO team and a defense attorney who argued in one meeting that—

we were prosecuting [Epstein] because he was Jewish. We then pointed out that

a number of members of [the USAO] chain of command were Jewish. Then he

said, well we’re prosecuting him because he was a Democrat. And again, we

pointed out that a number of us were Democrats. So then it went to, we were

prosecuting him because he was wealthy. ... That one didn’t work so well.
