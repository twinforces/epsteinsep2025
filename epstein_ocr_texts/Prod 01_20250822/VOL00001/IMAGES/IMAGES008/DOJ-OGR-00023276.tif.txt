18 U.S.C. § 2255 and again listing the 32 “individuals whom the United States was prepared to
name as victims of an enumerated offense.” 7”! The same day, Villafafia sent Goldberger a second
letter, noting that the defense would receive copies of all victim notifications on a rolling basis.

Villafafia informed her managers that the FBI case agents would reach out by telephone to
the listed victims who were unrepresented, to inform them that the case was resolved and to
confirm their addresses for notification by mail. With regard to the content of the telephone calls,
Villafafia proposed the following language to the case agents:

We are calling to inform you about the resolution of the Epstein
investigation and to thank you for your help.

Mr. Epstein pled guilty to one child sex offense that will require him
to register as a sex offender for life and received a sentence of 18
months imprisonment followed by one year of home confinement.
Mr. Epstein also made a concession regarding the payment of
restitution.

All of these terms are set out in a letter that AUSA Villafafia is going
to send out. Do you have a lawyer? Get name or address. If not[,]
where do you want [the] letter sent? If you have questions when
you receive the letter, please understand that we cannot provide
legal advice but the lawyers at the following victim rghts
organizations are able to help you at no cost to you. (Provide names
and phone numbers)

Also ask about counseling and let them know that counseling is still
available even though the investigation is closed.

On July 21, 2008, Villafafia sent the letter to the 11 unrepresented victims whose addresses
the FBI had by that time confirmed. Villafafia provided Epstein’s defense counsel with a copy of
the letter sent to each victim, directly or though counsel (with the mailing addresses redacted).

D. July — August 2008: The FBI Sends the Victim Notification Letter to Victims

Residing Outside of the United States

While attempting to locate and contact the unrepresented victims, the FBI obtained contact
information for two victims residing outside of the United States. On July 23 and August 8, 2008,
respectively, the FBI Victim Specialist transmitted an automated VNS form notification letter to
each victim through the FBI representative at the U.S diplomatic mission for each country. This
371 A month later, in an August 18, 2008 letter to the USAO, the defense sought to limit the government’s victim
list to those victims who were identified before the September 24, 2007 execution of the NPA. Villafafia also raised
with Acosta, Sloman, and other supervisors the question whether the USAO had developed sufficient evidence to
include new victims it had identified since creation of the July 2008 list and whether Jane Doe #2, who had previously
given a statement in support of Epstein, should be added back to the list. Ultimately, Villafafia sent the defense a
letter confirming that the government’s July 10, 2008 victim list was “the final list.”
