[M]y:expectation of what.was going [to] happen at.the:plea was that.
it would_be like.a federal plea where there’ would be a‘factual proffer:
that.was read, and. where: the judge would ask if'there were any
Victinns present who wanted to be heard, arid that at that pointiif Brad.
Edwards’ ‘wanted. to address: the court. or ‘if ‘his clients wanted. to
addiess' the court, they would be given.the opportunity to: do so?"

‘Sloman told OPR-that he did.not recall directing Villafafia to ‘contact anyone: about:the:plea.

believed ‘the: state would notify: the victims ofthe “all-encompassing plea” resolving the federal.
case “ard: [the ‘victims would] have ‘an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.”
Nevertheless, Acosta did not-know whether the state victims. overlapped ‘with the federal victims
or whether the USAO “shared, that list with them.” ‘Villafanta told OPR that she and. Acosta,

communication between.the’ USAO and the State Attorney’s Office, and although she ‘discussed :a

fulfill ‘that obligation, and even as another failsafe, (the Victiins]
would be notified. of... the restitution-:mechanism that we had. set.
Up on, their-behalf.
