MéSQOmax 1

MR.» EVERDELL: No, your Honor. We rest on the papers.

‘THE COURT: I thank you counsel for your thorough
briefing. I am prepareoa to rule.

The defendant raises, four objections to the
calculation of the guiceline range ‘containea in the PSR. AS we
oiscussed, first, she argues I must apply the 2003 guidelines
rather than the 2CC4 guidelinés. Beyond that, she objects to
the application of three sentencing enhancements. The
gevernment's sole objection to the calculation of. the
guidelines is that Virginia Roberts ana Melissa shoula be

consiaerea victims. So I will adaress the defense objections

ano then the government's object:Lons:.

I begin, by determining which of the Guideline manuals
apply. Gérérally, a Senténéing court applies thé versién of
the guidelines in effect on the cate that the defendant 1s
sentencea. 18 U.S.C. Section 3553(a) (4) 4A) (ii). But the
EX Post Facto Clausé is ‘violatea if a oefenoant is sentencea
under Guidelines issued after she's committed her offense and

the new Guidelines provide a higher sentencing range than the

‘version in place at the tume of the offense. That"s the

principle of a casé calleéa Peugh v. United States, 569 U.S. 530

(2013). In that case; a ‘sentencing court must. -- in the ‘case
of a higher range at the time of sentencing than in place at

the time of the offense, in that ¢ase thé séntencing Court. must.

apply the guidelines in effect when the offense was committed.
