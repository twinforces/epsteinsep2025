Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Pageds of 113
USI Film Prod., 511 U.S. 244 (1994). Rather, such offenses could only have been
governed by the 1994 version of § 3283, pursuant to which the statute of
limitations expired once Defendant’s accusers turned 25 years old. And it is
undisputed that Defendant’s accusers were all women above the age of 25 when
the Government charged her in 2020.

For these reasons, Appellant’s convictions under Counts Three and Four
must be vacated.

A. Section 3283 Does Not Apply to the Mann Act Violations (Counts Three
and Four)

Under Counts Three and Four, the Government charged Defendant with
substantive and conspiracy violations of the Mann Act, 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a), more
than 15 years after the fact. To accomplish this, the Government relies on § 3283’s
extension of the limitations period. But by its text, § 3283 applies only to
“offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child.” 18
U.S.C. § 3283. Transportation of a minor or conspiracy to transport in violation of
§ 2423(a) is not such an offense, so Counts Three and Four must be dismissed.

At first blush, it may seem counterintuitive to assert that Counts Three and
Four do not allege “offense[s] involving the sexual ... abuse ... of a child.” But
longstanding legal precedent dictates a narrower application of § 3283. The
Supreme Court has frequently adopted a “categorical approach” (or “essential
ingredient” test) when interpreting a statute’s references to other offenses or
