request a continuance or object to Jane’s testimony until the charging conference suggests that
she was not unfairly surprised. See Kaplan, 490 F.3d at 130. Accordingly, there is no indication
in the record that the evidence adduced at trial unfairly surprised or prejudiced the Defendant.

Finally, the Defendant argues that Jane’s testimony resulted in the “ultimate prejudice”
because it led to the jury improperly convicting her on three of the four Mann Act counts.
Maxwell Br. at 18. For the same reasons noted above, the Defendant was not prejudiced by the
Court’s response to the jury note because the ambiguous note did not reveal that the jury
improperly convicted the Defendant of the Mann Act counts. Moreover, as explained above, the
Defendant’s request for a limiting instruction in the jury charge and a supplemental instruction
following the ambiguous jury note was unnecessary. While Kate’s and Annie’s limiting
instructions were appropriate at the time of their testimony when the jury had not yet been
instructed on the meaning of “illegal sexual activity,” it was unnecessary and potentially
confusing to repeat them again in the context of the charge. At that point, the charge made clear
to the jury that only a violation of New York law could form the predicate for the Mann Act
counts—not New Mexico law. In sum, the Defendant has not shown that she suffered
“substantial prejudice” meriting the vacatur of the Mann Act counts.

IV. The Court denies the Defendant’s pre-indictment delay claim.

Last, the Defendant argues, as she did in two pretrial motions, that all of her convictions
should be vacated because of the Government’s allegedly excessive and prejudicial delay in
prosecuting the Defendant. As this Court previously explained, because “‘the statute of
limitations is ‘the primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges,”’” the
Defendant must satisfy a stringent two-part test. Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 316 (quoting
United States v. Cornielle, 171 F.3d 748, 751 (2d Cir. 1999)). The Defendant “must show both
