ANALISA TORRES, District Judge:

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated substantial changes in the Court’s
trial schedule in order to ensure that jury trials can be conducted safely and practically.
Moreover, on April 20, 2020, the Honorable Colleen McMahon, Chief Judge, ordered that “the
conduct of jury trials in this district be and hereby is suspended until further order of the court.”
In re: Coronavirus/COVID-19 Pandemic (Suspension of Jury Trials as a Result of Covid-19 and
the Limitation of Court Operations), 20 Misc. 197, ECF No. 1 at 2 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 20, 2020).
The Chief Judge further ordered that time be excluded for all criminal trials under the Speedy
Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), from April 27, 2020 to June 15, 2020, noting that “[t]he
[c]ourt may further extend the period of exclusion as circumstances may warrant.” In re:
Coronavirus/COVID-19 Pandemic (Extension of Time Under the Speedy Trial Act), 20 Misc.
196, ECF No. 1 9 6(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 20, 2020). Accordingly, the trial in this action scheduled to
commence on June 22, 2020, is ADJOURNED to January 4, 2021.

It is ORDERED that the time between June 22, 2020 and January 4, 2021 is excluded
under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), in the interests of justice. The Court
finds that the ends of justice served by granting the exclusion outweigh the best interests of the
public and Defendants in a speedy trial, because such an extension is necessary to efficiently
administer the Court’s docket consistent with public safety, and because it will allow the parties
to prepare for trial and to discuss potential pretrial disposition.

It is further ORDERED that the parties shall appear for a status conference on
September 9, 2020, at 1:00 p.m., in Courtroom 15D of the United States Courthouse, 500 Pearl
Street, New York, New York.

SO ORDERED.
