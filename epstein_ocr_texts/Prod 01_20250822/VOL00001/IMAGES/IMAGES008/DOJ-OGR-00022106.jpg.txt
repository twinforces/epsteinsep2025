Re: State of NY v Michael Thomas, et al.
Docket No.: 1:19-cr-00830
Request To Appear Remotely

Dear Hon. Judge Torres:

As you are aware, our firm represents the defendant, Michael Thomas, in the above-
captioned matter. We are scheduled for a hearing on September 9, 2020. Given the current
pandemic, I am not sure if the Court is allowing in-person hearings; however, I am requesting to
appear remotely due to the circumstances surrounding COVID-19. Due to my health, I am
unfortunately high risk and believe that it is in my best interest to appear remotely.

In light of the foregoing, I respectfully request the Court to allow my appearance via
video or telephone.

Respectfully yours,

/s/ Montell Figgins
