1 for some reason, then it's going to create a conflict.

2 THE COURT: You will not be starting a week later. We
3 are starting on the 8th of June.

4 MR. FOY: Okay. Here is the issue. The government

5 has represented to you that this is just about a 14-hour

6 period. I suspect that, when the trial comes around, that the
7 only thing that won't come up during the trial is the 14-hour

8 period, right? Because it's not as if we are not here because
9 of other things having nothing to do with the defendants in

10 this case, and the working conditions at MCC are directly

11 related to why things happened in that 14-hour period. The

12 years of conduct, the culture of the institution, the failures
13 in security measures beyond counts.

14 We have been provided with three videos of the 192

15 that exist. In the SHU there are nine video cameras. Only one
16 has been produced, and it shows almost nothing. And why that
17 is, the circumstances, what it means, is relevant.

18 So maybe it will be a one-week trial. That's

19 possible. But what I am trying to avoid is some type of
20 conflict that we can see now that -- you know, because, you
21 know, I understand professional obligations, but if I had to
22 choose between family and my professional obligations, it's --
23 THE COURT: All right. Well, counsel, I am directing
24 that you be here on June 8 to start trial.
25 MR. FOY: I will be here.
