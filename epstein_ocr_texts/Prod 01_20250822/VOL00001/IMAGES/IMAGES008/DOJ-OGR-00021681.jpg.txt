Maxwell also ‘points. to. the NPA provision stating
that, “Epstein seeks to resolve globally his state and.
federal criminal liability.” (A.175). Based on that.
statement, Maxwell, argues that. Epstein’s purpose in.
negotiating the NPA was,.to“obtain a global resolution
that ‘would, among other things, provide maximum.
protection for any alleged co-conspirators.” (Br.34).
But the cited provision, only says that’ Epstein sought.
to ‘resolve “his” liability, not anyone else’s. Further-

Dkt.142, Ex. .F at 2). This point only highlights the par-
ties’ understanding at, all times that their negotiations
merely’ bound the USAO-SDFL, and not’ the entire fed-
eral government.
