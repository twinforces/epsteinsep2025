testimony as “self-serving” and “rehearsed.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 7, 10, Dkt. No. 649.
Juror 50 certainly appeared prepared to answer the Court’s questions, but that is consistent with
what any good counsel would have recommended he do. It is unremarkable that Juror 50 would
have reflected on his experience in anticipation of testifying under oath and was prepared for
anticipated questions. The Court did not detect in Juror 50’s responses any fabrication or
improper rehearsal of a false narrative. Cf Singh v. Barr, 823 F. App’x 10, 12 (2d Cir. 2020)
(summary order) (declining to discount a witness’s testimony as “rehearsed” where that witness

several lines of questioning, tested exactly this component of Juror 50’s testimony and is
satisfied by his answers. The Court first observed to Juror 50 that throughout the questionnaire,
he “appeared to have followed the instructions.” Hearing Tr. at 19. When asked how he
correctly followed the instructions elsewhere, Juror 50 explained, as he had previously in his
testimony, that for questions appearing earlier in the questionnaire, he “was still . . . in focus”
and so more able to respond accurately. /d. That focus waned, he explained, in reading later
questions, including Question 48.

Additionally, the Court observed that many questions were structured like Question 48,
asking jurors both about their personal experience and providing options to check for “yes self,
