‘in FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafatia informed CEOS Ghief Oosterbaan:that:she:
anticipated the victims “would be concérned about the status’ of the case.”

‘On, January 31, 2008, Villafana, the CEOS Trial. Attorney, and the FBI interviewed.three
victims, including Wild. Prior to the interview, Wild had. received the EBI’s January. 10, 2008
|ctter stating that‘the case: was under investigation; however, according 'to the case agent, Wild and.
two other victims had also been told: bythe FBI, in October 2007, that the case had.been resolved.
In-her 2015 GVRA-case declaration, Wild ‘stated that. after receiving the EBI letter, she believed
that ‘the: FBI was investigating the case, and. she was not-told “about, any: [NPA] or any potential.
resolution. of the federal criminal investigation. I was cooperating in. If. had been. told of afn.
NPA]; would have objected.” In Villafana’s 2017 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafana,
recalled. interviewing ‘Wild .on. January 311, 2008, along: with EBI. agents, and. Villafatia told OPR.
she “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there-were atrial.” Villafana recalled

Wild responding that she “hoped. Epstein. would be ‘prosecuted. and. that she was. willing ‘to
testifye7>

After the first:three victim.interviews on. January 31, 2008, Villafana described for Acosta.
and Sloman, the toll that the case. had taken on two of the. victims:

One girl broke down sobbing. So that we. had. to stop ‘the interview
twice... she said she was having nightmares: about: Epstein coming
after her and she started to ‘break’ down, again so Wwe stopped the
‘Interview.

The second, girl... . was'very upset about the 18 month deal she: had.
read about.in the paper.*** She said.that 18 months was nothing and
that:she had heard that the girls could. get restitution, but she’ would.
rather not get any money and. have Epstein spend a. significant time
in jail?

Villatfanaclosed the.email by. requesting that.Acosta.and Sloman attend the interviews with victims:

scheduled. for the following day,, but neither did so.*** Acosta told OPR. that it. “wasn’t typical”

The FBI:report of the interview. did-notreflect a.discussion.of Wild’s.intentions..
