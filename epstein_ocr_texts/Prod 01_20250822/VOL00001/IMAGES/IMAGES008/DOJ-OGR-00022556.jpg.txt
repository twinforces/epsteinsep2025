1 TODD BLANCHE: We're repeat -- we're now
2 being a little repetitive, but you're confident that
3 before you met Mr. Epstein, he didn't know your
4 father, and so there's no -- he wouldn't have done
5 business with your father's companies in the '80s
6 either.
7 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Absolutely not. I'm a
8 hundred percent sure of that. I never met him. I
9 never saw him. I never heard his name. No.
10 Nothing.
11 TODD BLANCHE: So there's been a lot of
1? conversations about whether Mr. Epstein maintained,
13 like, a list of people, like a book of famous people
14 that he knew. Like a, it's called a black book or a
15 client list or a list.
16 Did you know of the existence of any such
17 list?
18 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: There is no list.
19 We'll start with that. The genesis of that story, I
20 can actually trace for you from its absolute
21 inception, if that is what you're interested in.
22 TODD BLANCHE: It is.
23 DAVID MARKUS: Well, first, you know, to
24 be short, there is no list, there's no client list.
25 Nothing like that.
