Defendants. ORDER

ANALISA TORRES, District Judge:

On November 19, 2019, Defendant Michael Thomas was charged with one count of
conspiring to defraud the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and three counts of
making false statements with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or
proper administration of a matter within the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United
States in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001(a)(3). ECF No. 1. The indictment alleges that Thomas,
in his capacity as a correctional officer at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (the “MCC”),
along with another officer, co-Defendant Tova Noel, submitted several false “count slips” on the
night of August 9, 2019 and the morning of August 10, 2019, certifying that he conducted counts
of the inmates he was supervising in the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”), even though he
did not conduct those counts. Jd. §§ 16, 30, 36, 38, 40. During that time period, one of the
inmates in the SHU—Jeffrey Epstemm—hanged himself in his cell. Jd. §§ 1, 26-27.

the trial scheduled to begin on January 4, 2021. Motion, ECF No. 33. Thomas seeks three
