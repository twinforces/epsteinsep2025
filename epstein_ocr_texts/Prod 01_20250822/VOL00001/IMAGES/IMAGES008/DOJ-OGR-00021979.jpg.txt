1 THE COURT: When do you expect the protective order to
2 be in place?

i) MS. DONALESKI: Your Honor, we'll provide a draft to

4 defense counsel within the next day, and then depending on how
5 long it takes for them to comment on it and the parties to

6 reach a resolution, we'll provide it to the Court as

7 expeditiously as possible, so it's my hope that that can happen
8 within a week.

9 THE COURT: All right. By the end of December,
10 discovery should have been produced. Is that correct?
11 MS. DONALESKI: That's fine, your Honor.
12 THE COURT: It's not voluminous, is it?
13 MS. DONALESKI: Your Honor, it will consist of
14 hundreds of hours of video recording, so in that aspect it will
15 be voluminous, but the paper records, the bank records will not
16 be voluminous.
17 THE COURT: All right. It doesn't seem that you would
18 need more than a month to review the discovery so that by the
19 end of January, you should have made decisions as to whether
20 you're going to be filing motions. Correct?
al MR. FIGGINS: Your Honor, if I may?
22 I also know that there's an ongoing inspector
23 general's report. I don't have any idea as to the time frame,
24 if and when that's going to be completed. I do believe that
25 there would be some pertinent information, relevant information
