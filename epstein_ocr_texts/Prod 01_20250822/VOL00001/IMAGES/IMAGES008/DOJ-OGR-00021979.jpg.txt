be in place?

MS. DONALESKI: Your Honor, we'll provide a draft to
defense counsel within the next day, and then depending on how
long it takes, for ‘them to Gomment on it and the parties to
reach a resolution, we'll provide it to the Court as
expeditiously ds possible, so it's my hope that that can happen
within. a week.,

THE COURT! All right. By thé end of Décembér,
discovery should have: been. produced. Is that correct?

MS. DONALESKI; That.'s fine, your Honor.

THE COURT: It's mot voluminous, 1s it?

MS. DONALESKI: Your Honér, it will Gonsist 6f
hundreds of hours of video recording, so in that aspect it will
be voluminous, but the paper records, the bank records will n6t
be voluminous.

THE GOURT: All right. It dé6esn't séem that. you would
need more than, a month to meview the discovery so that by the

you're going to be filing motaons. Cornrect?
