1 THE COURT: Would you like me to read the indictment

2 to you in open court?

3 DEFENDANT THOMAS: No, your Honor.

4 THE COURT: How do you plead to the charges?

5) DEFENDANT THOMAS: Not guilty, your Honor.

6 THE COURT: Thank you. Be seated.

7 Have the parties discussed an appropriate bail

8 package?

9 MR. ROOS: Yes, your Honor.

10 THE COURT: Shall we begin with Ms. Noel?

11 MR. ROOS: Certainly, your Honor. I actually think

12 the bail packages are nearly identical with the exception of

13 one or two conditions that are set forth in the pretrial

14 services report, so maybe I'll first give your Honor all of the
15 conditions that are the same for each of the defendants and I
16 will note the variation at the end.

17 For both defendants, it's $100,000 bond, secured by

18 two financially responsible persons and their own signature;

19 pretrial supervision, as directed; surrender of travel
20 documents, and no new applications; no contact with
21 codefendants; surrender of firearms.
22 For travel restrictions, for Defendant Thomas, it will
23 be Southern District of New York, Eastern District of New York,
24 and the District of New Jersey.
25 And for Defendant Noel, it will be Southern District
