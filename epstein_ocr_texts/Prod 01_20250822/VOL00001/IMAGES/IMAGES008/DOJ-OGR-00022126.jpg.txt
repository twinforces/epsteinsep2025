Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document55 Filed 05/25/21 Page2of3

The foregoing obligations are continuing ones and apply to materials that become known to
the Government in the future. These obligations also apply to information that is otherwise subject to
disclosure regardless of whether the Government credits it.

In the event the Government believes that a disclosure under this Order would compromise
witness safety, victim rights, national security, a sensitive law-enforcement technique, or any other
substantial government interest, it may apply to the Court for a modification of its obligations, which
may include in camera review or withholding or subjecting to a protective order all or part of the
information otherwise subject to disclosure.”

For purposes of this Order, the Government has an affirmative obligation to seek all
information subject to disclosure under this Order from all current or former federal, state, and local
prosecutors, law enforcement officers, and other officers who have participated in the prosecution, or
investigation that led to the prosecution, of the offense or offenses with which the defendant is
charged.

If the Government fails to comply with this Order, the Court, in addition to ordering
production of the information, may:

(1) specify the terms and conditions of such production;

(2) grant a continuance;

(3) impose evidentiary sanctions;

(4) impose contempt or other sanctions on any lawyer responsible for violations of the

Government’s disclosure obligations, or refer the matter to disciplinary authorities;

(5) dismiss charges before trial or vacate a conviction after trial or a guilty plea; or
> The Classified Information Procedures Act sets forth separate procedures to be followed in the
event that the Government believes matters relating to classified information may arise in connection
with the prosecution. See 18 U.S.C. app. 3 § 1 et seq.
