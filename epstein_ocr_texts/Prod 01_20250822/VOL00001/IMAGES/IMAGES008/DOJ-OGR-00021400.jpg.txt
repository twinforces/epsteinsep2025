&«. USAO and FBI Letters Are Hand Delivered

The FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its :notifications “at the time that we ‘met.
[with] the gitls:’ The case, agent-recalled:thatishe hand delivered the USAO letters. and FBI letters.
to some victims following in-person ‘interviews, and in the instances when she did-not. provide a
victim with a letter, she:provided.an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights:information similar-to
that set forth. in, the FBI letters.°°” The: co-case agent ‘also recalled that he may have delivered “a
few” letters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR.that she: mailed some: FBI jetters to
victims and she provided. some FBI letters’to:the case agent for hand-delivery.,

Nevertheless, the case agent told OPR that. she “did not sit there and go throtigh every
right” with the’victims. She: stated, however, “[I]n the beginning whether it'was through [the EBL
Victim. Specialist] giving-the letter, me giving, a. letter, the pamphlet, I’believed that the girls.knew:
that they were: victims ‘and had rights, ‘and they had.a resource, [the FBI’ Victim Specialist], that.
they-could call forthat.” "The EBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected,
the FBI Victim Specialist with each'victim, the Victim Specialist-handled the victims” “rights and
resources.”

“everyone whom ‘the agents have' spoken, with, so. far has been willing to tell her story. Getting
them to:tell their stories in front. of a jury: at trial.may’ be much harder.” Between. August 2006 and
September: 24, 2007, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed, 22 victims. On.
a few occasions, Villafaita.met.with victims together with the FBI. Villafaiia’s May: 1,'2007 draft
indictment included substantive ctiiies against niultiple victims, and Villafana described the
circumstances of cach of their encounters with.Epstein in. her‘prosecution. memorandum.

‘There is some evidence indicating that, during interviews, some of the victims expressed to:
the: FBI case agents and Villafafa concerns about participating in. a federal. trial. of Epstein, and
those discussions touched.upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired-outcome
of the investigation. Before the USAO entered ‘into: the: NPA, ‘however, no. one from. the.

aso ‘The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving letters to ‘the. girls when we would-talk to- them. at. . . the.
conclusion, or. ...if.didn’thave, the filecon,me[;];Chad-pamphlets in my car, or :made; sure. [the victims: had contact;
‘information forthe: FBI*s' Vietim Specialist].””
