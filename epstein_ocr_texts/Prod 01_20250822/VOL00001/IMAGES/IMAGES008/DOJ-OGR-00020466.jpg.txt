Case 22-1426, Document 1-2, 07/08/2022, 3344417, Page80 of 91
exhibits and the sealing of Court Exhibit 4. The Court concludes that the proposed
redactions are consistent with the three—part test articulated by the Second Circuit in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006), and narrowly
tailored. The redactions serve the purpose of protecting the anonymity of jurors and of
victim—witnesses subject to the Court's anonymity order. With respect to Court Exhibit
4, rather than seal the entire document, the Court has redacted the information that
would potentially identify the victim—witness who testified pursuant to the Court's
anonymity order. Unredacted copies of the Court Exhibits will be filed under seal.

02/11/2022 | 596 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties’ letters
addressing the Defendant's request to temporarily seal her motion for a new trial and
accompanying exhibits, and the Governments response in opposition and
accompanying exhibits. See Dkt. Nos. 590, 594, 595. Several media organizations
have also filed letters seeking unsealing. The Court is also in receipt of Juror 50's
motion to intervene. Both the Government and the Defendant oppose intervention. The
Defendant seeks to strike or, in the alternative, seal Juror 50's motion. For the reasons
outlined more fully below, the Court rules as follows. First, the Defendant's motion to
temporarily seal in their entirety all documents related to the motion for a new trial is
DENIED. Any sealing of judicial documents must be narrowly tailored to serve
competing interests. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 2/11/22)(Gw) (Entered:
