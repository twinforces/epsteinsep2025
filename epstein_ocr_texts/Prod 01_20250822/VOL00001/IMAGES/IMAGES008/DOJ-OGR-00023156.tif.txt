cooperation.'®© When Villafafia spoke with attorneys in the Eastern District of New York,
however, an AUSA there told Villafafia that “[t]hey had never heard of” Epstein, and he had not
cooperated with the Bear Stearns case.'8’ During her OPR interview, Villafafia told OPR that to
her knowledge, the rumor of Epstein’s cooperation was “completely false.”

Villafafia and the USAO continued to monitor Epstein’s compliance with the terms of the
NPA. In August 2009, Villafafia alerted her supervisors that Epstein was in apparent violation of
his home detention—he had been spotted walking on the beach, and when stopped by the police,
he claimed that he was walking “to work” at an office nearly eight miles from his home. Villafafia
passed this information along to the Palm Beach County probation office.'®* By letter dated
September 1, 2009, Black wrote to Sloman seeking the USAO’s agreement to transfer supervision
of the community control phase of Epstein’s sentence to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein
maintained his “primary residence.” In response, Villafafia notified Black that the USAO opposed
such a request and would view it as a violation of the NPA. Three months later, Sloman met with
Dershowitz and, among other issues, informed him that the USAO opposed early termination of
Epstein’s community control supervision and would object to a request to transfer Epstein’s
supervision to the U.S. Virgin Islands.

After serving his year on home detention in Florida, Epstein completed his sentence on
July 21, 2010.

187 The New York AUSA had emailed Villafafia, “We’re the prosecutors in [the Bear Stearns case].... We
saw the below article from the New York Post and wanted to ask you about this defendant, Epstein, who we had never
heard of until this morning. We’ve since learned that he is pretty unsavory.” Villafafia reported to Sloman and other
supervisors that she “just got off the phone with the prosecutors from the Bear Stearns case in [the Eastern District of]
New York. They had seen the NY Post article that claimed that Epstein got such a low sentence because he was
cooperating with the feds on the Bear Stearns prosecution. They had never heard of him.” In a second email, she
confirmed, “There has been absolutely no cooperation here or in New York, from what they told me.”
188 Black later wrote a letter to Villafafia claiming that Epstein had “specific authorization to walk to work,” the
distance between his home and office was “less than three miles,” and when the matter was “fully investigated,”
Epstein was found to be in “total compliance” with the requirements of his sentence.
