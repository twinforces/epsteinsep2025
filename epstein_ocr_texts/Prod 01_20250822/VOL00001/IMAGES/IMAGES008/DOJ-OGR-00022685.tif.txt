13. when you ask me about massages, I want to be clear. 13. denied that. I couldn't imagine that he would but I
14 I generally -- what I think of that is 14 think looking back now, that -- I did not. But I
15 somebody on a massage table, but other people might 15 _ started to suspect that he was not faithful. Seems
16 think of it as something different. You know, you 16 ludicrous but that's what I thought.
17 could have someone rubbing his feet or his shoulder. 17 TODD BLANCHE: But if -- look, 1f -- if
