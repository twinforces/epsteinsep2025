1 So I'll take any requests beyond simply saying, I

2 received your note. I refer you to instruction number 21 on

3 page 28. Please consider carefully the full instruction.

4 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

8 THE COURT: Mr. Everdell?

6 MR. EVERDELL: That's fine, your Honor.

7 THE COURT: Okay. I'll do that. And then —- well,

8 let me write it, and then we'll send it back, and then we'll

9 discuss —— because we have to bring them in to dismiss them.
10 So I received your note. I refer you to instruction
11 number 21 on page 28. Please consider the entirety of the

12 instruction.

13 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.

14 THE COURT: Okay.

15 MR. EVERDELL: Without waiving our prior objection.
16 THE COURT: Understood.

17 All right. While Ms. Williams is handing that to the
18 CSO, for extending deliberation times going forward.

19 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
20 We've considered the matter. And the government's
21 view is that is within the Court's discretion certainly to set
22 a schedule for jury deliberations. Given the circumstances, we
23 agree that it's prudent to advise the jury that, barring any
24 scheduling complications, they should expect an extended day
25 tomorrow.
