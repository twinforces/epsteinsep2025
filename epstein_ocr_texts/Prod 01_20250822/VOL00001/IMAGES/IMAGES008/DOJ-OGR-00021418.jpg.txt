review the appropriateness of the potential federal charges and the government’s “unprecedentedly
expansive interpretation” of 18 U.S.C. § 2255.

In a December 19, 2007 response to the defense team, Acosta offered to revise two
paragraphs in the NPA to resolve “disagreements” with the defense and to clarify that the parties
intended Epstein’s § 2255 liability to “place these identified victims in the same position as they
would have been had Mr. Epstein been convicted at trial. No more; no less.” Acosta also advised
that although the USAO intended to notify the victims of the resolution of the federal investigation,
the USAO would leave to the State Attorney the decision whether to notify victims about the state
proceedings:

I understand that the defense objects to the victims being given
notice of [the] time and place of Mr. Epstein’s state court sentencing
hearing. I have reviewed the proposed victim notification letter and
the statute. I would note that the United States provided the draft
letter to the defense as a courtesy. In addition, First Assistant United
States Attorney Sloman already incorporated in the letter several
edits that had been requested by defense counsel. I agree that [the
CVRA] applies to notice of proceedings and results of investigations
of federal crimes as opposed to the state crime. We intend to provide
victims with notice of the federal resolution, as required by law. We
will defer to the discretion of the State Attorney regarding whether
he wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings,
although we will provide him with the information necessary to do
so if he wishes.

Acosta told OPR that he “would not have sent this letter without running it by [Sloman], if
not other individuals in the office,” and records show he sent a draft to Sloman and Villafafia.
Acosta explained to OPR that he was not concerned about deferring to Krischer on the issue of
whether to notify the victims of the state proceedings because he did not view it as his role, or the
role of the USAO, “to direct the State Attorney’s Office on its obligations with respect to the state
outcome.”3”? Acosta further explained to OPR that despite the USAO’s initial concerns about the
State Attorney’s Office’s handling of the Epstein case, he did not believe it was appropriate to
question that office’s ability to “fulfill whatever obligation they have,” and he added, “Let’s not
assume... that the State Attorney’s Office is full of bad actors.” Acosta told OPR that it was his
understanding “that the victims would be aware of what was happening in the state court and have
an opportunity to speak up at the state court hearing.” Acosta also told OPR that the state would
B28 Sloman’s handwritten notes from a December 21, 2007 telephone conference indicate that Acosta asked the
defense, “Are there concerns re: 3771 lang[uage],” to which Lefkowitz replied, “The state should have their own
mechanism.” At the time of the Epstein matter, under the Florida Constitution, upon request, victims were afforded
the “right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of, and to be present at” a defendant’s plea and sentencing. Fla.
Const. art. I, § 16(b)(6). Similarly, pursuant to state statute, “Law enforcement personnel shall ensure” that victims
are given information about “[t]he stages in the criminal or juvenile justice process which are of significance to the
victim[.]” Fla. Stat. § 960.001(1)(a) (2007). Victims were also entitled to submit an oral or written impact statement.
Fla. Stat. § 960.001(1)k) (2007). Moreover, “in a case in which the victim is a minor child,” the guardian or family
of the victim must be consulted by the state attorney “in order to obtain the views of the victim or family about the
disposition of any criminal or juvenile case” including plea agreements. Fla. Stat. § 960.001(1)(g) (2007).
