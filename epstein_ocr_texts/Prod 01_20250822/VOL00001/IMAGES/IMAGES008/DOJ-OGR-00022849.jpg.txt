1 TODD BLANCHE: So it wasn't --
2 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: But maybe --
3 TODD BLANCHE: -- your -- it wasn't your
4 job --
5 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: No.
6 TODD BLANCHE: -- on a regular math --
7 basis to pay the masseuse. So if there was a
8 masseuse seven days a week, it wasn't expected that
9 seven days a week you would be the one handing them
10 money?
11 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I -- mostly I would
12 not. I'm not saying I never did it, because that
13 wouldn't be true. But it was not my job to pay them.
14 I mostly recall he would either pay them himself, he
15 would have money or the houseman, and I think some of
16 them would have probably received checks.
17 TODD BLANCHE: And so just picking up on
18 what Mr. Markus was just asking you, did you
19 participate in sexual activity with him with a
20 masseuse, like at the same time?
21 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: No.
22 TODD BLANCHE: And so the testi- -- I
23 don't know if there's testimony, but the women who
24 have said that that happened, categorically, that's
25 not true?
