171 F.3d 748, 751 (2d Cir. 1999) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307,
322 (1971)). There is a strong presumption that an indictment filed within the statute of
limitations is valid. To prevail on a claim that pre-indictment delay violates due process, a
defendant must show both that the Government intentionally delayed bringing charges for an
improper purpose and that the delay seriously damaged the defendant’s ability defend against the
charges. See id. This is a stringent standard. “Thus, while the [Supreme] Court may not have
shut the door firmly on a contention that at some point the Due Process Clause forecloses
prosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most the door is barely ajar.” DeMichele v.
Greenburgh Cent. Sch. Dist. No. 7, 167 F.3d 784, 790-91 (2d Cir. 1999).

The Court sees no evidence that the Government’s delay in bringing these charges was
designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense. However, it is enough to say that
Maxwell does not make the strong showing of prejudice required to support this sort of claim.
Maxwell contends that the Government’s delay in bringing charges has prejudiced her interests
because potential witnesses have died, others have forgotten, and records have been lost or
destroyed. It is highly speculative that any of these factors would make a substantial difference
in her case.

Maxwell first points to several potential witnesses who have passed away. These include
Jeffrey Epstein and his mother, one individual Maxwell believes worked with one of the alleged
victims in this case, and a police detective who investigated Epstein in Florida. She contends
they all would have provided exculpatory testimony were they alive today. Courts have
generally found that vague assertions that a deceased witness might have provided favorable
testimony do not justify dismissing an indictment for delay. See, e.g., United States v. Scala, 388
F. Supp. 2d 396, 399-400 (S.D.N.Y. 2005). The Court agrees with this approach. Maxwell
