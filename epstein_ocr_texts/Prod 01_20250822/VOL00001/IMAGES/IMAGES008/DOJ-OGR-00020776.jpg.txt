171 F.3d 748, 7511, (2d Cir. 1999) (cleaned up) (quoting United States v., Marion, 404 U.S. 307,
322 (1971)). There is a strong:presumption that an:indictment filed-within.the statute of?
‘limitations is valid. ‘To prevail on a claim that pre-indictment:delay violates due:process, a
defendant must:show both that the Government intentionally delayed.bringing charges ‘for an
‘improper purpose. and that the delay: seriously damaged.the, defendant’s ability: defend against the
shut‘the: door:firmly on a. contention that at some point ‘the: Due Process Clause: forecloses:
prosecution of a claim because it is too old, at most ‘the: door.is barely ajar.” DeMichele v.
Greenburgh Cent: Sch. Dist. No. 7, 1.67 F.3d.784,. 790-91 (2d Cir. 1999).

designed to: thwart:Maxwell’s ability to ‘prepare a. defense. However, it is enough to say that
‘Maxwell does-not make the strong showing of prejudice required to support'this sort of claim.
‘Maxwell contends that the Government's delay-in brin ging charges has prej udiced:her interests
because potential witnesses’ have died, others have forgotten, and.records have been lost or.
destroyed. Itas-highly’speculative that any ‘of-these:factors would:make a substantial-difference:
‘In-her case.

Maxwell first points to several:potential. witnesses who-have’passed away. These include
J effrey ‘Epstein and-his mother, one-individual. Maxwell believes worked with. one of thealleged
‘victims-in this case, and a‘police detective: who' investigated Epstein-in Florida. She: contends
generally found-that vague assertions thatia-deceased witness might have provided favorable
testimony do not justify dismissing an, indictment for, delay.. See. e.g., United.States v: Scala, 388

F. Supp. 2d 396, 399-400 (S.D.N-Y..2005). The Court agrees with this approach. ‘Maxwell
