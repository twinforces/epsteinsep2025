1 relationship; close, friendly?
2 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: My personal?
3 TODD BLANCHE: Yes.
4 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Not that close, but
5 friendly enough. I mean, you know.
6 TODD BLANCHE: How was Jeffrey Epstein's
7 relationship with his brother Mark from what you
8 observed?
9 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I mean, they were
10 brotherly, but I think that -- I don't know. I dontt
11 know. They had periods when they were closer and
12 then when they weren't. I think sometimes Epstein
13 found his brother irritating.
14 TODD BLANCHE: And I think I know the
15 answers, given what you just said about Bill Barr,
16 but did you ever hear any -- from Mr. Epstein or
17 anybody else -- that Bill Barr had any role in
18 Mr. Epstein getting a good plea deal in Florida, or
19 any role in that process with Mr. Acosta?
20 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I never heard that.
21 TODD BLANCHE: I think you said this in an
22 interview, but if I'm wrong forgive me. Do you have
23 a view of Mr. Epstein of whether he committed suicide
24 or whether something else happened?
25 DAVID MARKUS: Can we take a break?
