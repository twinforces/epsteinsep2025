‘Case 22-1426; Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page?. of 35:

Ms. Maxwell relies on herarguments in her principal Appellant’s Brief, Points

ILand IV, and supplements her arguments in. Points I, III,,and V herein.

Ms. Maxwell argues that she is a third-party beneficiary of the non-
prosecution. agreement (hereinafter, “NPA”) and, as such, has standing to enforce
the'co-conspirator immunity provision. which, by. its terms, barred this prosecution.
Altematively, the District.Court’s reliance.on U.S. ¥. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670 (2d.Cir.
1985) to resolve perceived ambiguities was. an error and the District Court should
have ordered.a hearing.

Ms. Maxwell further argues that the District Court’s findings ‘and conclusions
concerning Juror 50 were an abuse of discretion, in three respects: (1) Juror 50’s
explanations for his false answers to a juror questionnaire were incredible on. their
face; (2) Juror 50’s concealed traumatic experience as.a ‘victim. of childhood sexual
abuse under circumstances analogous to the experiences of the Government
witnesses, if known. during voir dire, would, have provided a valid basis for a:
challenge for cause; and (3) the Court abandoned its obligation. to ascertain not
merely the juror’s credibility, but also the validity ofa challenge for cause, when it

unduly narrowed the scope of its‘examination of Juror 50.at the post-trial hearing.
