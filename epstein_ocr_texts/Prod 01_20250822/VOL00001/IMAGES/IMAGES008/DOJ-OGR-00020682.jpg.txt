particular, for the reasons stated at today's conference, the Court denies the Government's
request to redact section ten of the Government's motion in limine. See Dkt. No. 380. The
Court will also not permit redactions pertaining to the general description of evidence or
anticipated testimony as such redactions are unnecessary to protect the privacy interests
of the individuals implicated. Accordingly, the parties must propose more tailored
redactions consistent with the Court's discussion at today's conference. The parties are
ORDERED to submit the proposals to the Court via email by November 4, 2021. In order
to facilitate the Court's review of the requests, the Court requires the parties to submit the
proposed redactions as a single document and with the proposed redactions highlighted.
The Defendant's proposed redactions should be highlighted in one color, and the
Government's a different color. The Court will rule on the proposed redactions
expeditiously. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 11/1/2021)(bw)
