‘intentionally :concealing, information from them and ‘was part ofa series, of: interactions with.
victims that. led'to condemnation of the governinent’s treatinent-of victiins.

VI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND
WITH. SENSITIVITY WHEN IT’ FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS
WITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE
FEDERAL INVESTIGATION

Although OPR. does not conclude that any of the subjects committed professional.
misconduct, cither. by failing to consult with the victims: before the: NPA was signed or in
interactions afterwards, OPR’s findings, are not an endorsement of the government’s course of
action.. The government’s interactions with. victims confused and. frustrated many. of the victims,
particularly. the two CVRA petitioners and. the two-victims who had unsuccessfully attempted.to
join in'the CVRA litigation. Asa ‘result, the victims’ and. the: public’s perception.of the matter is
that the:prosecutors worked with Epstein’s attorneys:to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It:
1S unfortunate, and. appears fundanientally: unfair to the victims; ‘that: Acosta. and, Sloman (after:
Menchel. and. Lourie departed) took the ‘unusual. step: of deciding to vet the: USAO. victim.
notification letters with the defense: after the NPA. was signed, but failed to go: beyond the
requirements of the:CVRA or the 2005 Guidelines:to consult with the.victims before the: NPA was
signed. This result is contre ary to the. _Department’s intent; as Set forth if the 2005 Guidelines, ‘that:
Department employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion. that victims of crime:
endure in its Wake.” When considering:the entirety of the governmient’s interactions,with victims,
OPR. concludes that. victims were: not treated with the: forthrightness and sensitivity.ex pected by
the Departinent.

Wild’s criticisms of the: government’s conduct were: based on. interactions ‘that are similar
to and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein, victims and
that demonstrate ar overall lack.of. sensitivity to the victims bythe government. Wild experienced
a Series: of confusing and inconsistent communications inher interactions with Villafana and the
case agents. Wild received. Villafaita’s letter in June .2007 stating. inaccurately that she was :a
federal ‘victin éntitléd to CVRA +ighits. She, was ifiterviewed bythe EBI in, Augtist-2007 but was
not told that a potential outcome was a state: plea. ‘Shortly after the September 24, 2007 signing of
the NPA, the EBI contacted. her-to inform her of the resolution of the fedéral case. Nonetheless,
on, January 10,, 2008, ‘the FBI sent. her a victims’ rights letter indicating ‘that. the case was under’
investigation and. ‘that, some: of her CVRA rights may not apply. until. after the defendant. was
the FBLagents, and told Wild that the.case-was under investigation, but.did not specifically: mention.
the NPA, although she nay have mentioned a. possible resolution. In mid-June 2008, ‘when.
Edwards contacted Villafaiia on. Wild’s ‘behalf, Villafatia informed, him that: the case was: under
investigation but did. not: mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s Junie 30, 2008 state court plea,

us OPR ‘notes that, ‘similar to ‘Villafafia, Sloman. interacted with a. victim's ‘attomey. during. the time: period
between the: signiig of the. NPA.aiid -Epstein's state. guilty plea. In January:2008, Sloman éceived a.teléphone call
‘trom ‘his; former law partner. who represented, one of the victims and, who,,asked, Sloman whether the federal.
goverment cotild bring charges against Epstein. ‘Sloman, concerned about: the potential ‘for conflict of. interest:
allegations due*to-his: prior business: relations with ‘the, attorney, refused to-answer ‘any questions regarding: Epstein.
Because.Slomaitretused to’provide.any “information, OPR found no basis*for finding that'Sloman misled ‘the: attomey:
