agreement. I know that Andy promised Chief Reiter an update when
a resolution was achieved. ... [The West Palm Beach manager] is
calling, but [he] knows not to tell Chief Reiter about the money
issue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and
the amount of time that has been agreed to. [He] also is telling Chief
Reiter not to disclose the outcome to anyone.

OPR questioned Villafafia about this email. She explained that she generally kept
confidential the terms of the resolution of any case. She understood that “the way that the [Epstein]
case was resolved” needed to remain confidential, but the victims could be informed about what
happened because by the NPA’s terms, they needed to know what the agreement was about.

Villafafia emailed the West Palm Beach manager, asking him to tell PBPD Chief Reiter
“the good news” but “leave out the part about damages,” and explained that she wanted to meet
with the victims herself to explain how the damages provision would work. Villafafia also told
him that Lourie had asked that Reiter share information about the NPA only with the PBPD
Detective who had led the state investigation of Epstein.'’’ Villafafia forwarded to Acosta, Lourie,
and the West Palm Beach manager Lefkowitz’s email asking that the USAO try to keep the NPA
from becoming public. Acosta responded that the agreement “already binds us not to make public
except as required by law under [the Freedom of Information Act],” and asked, “[W]hat more does
he want?” Villafafia replied, “My guess is that if we tell anyone else (like the police chief or FBI
or the girls), that we ask them not to disclose.” Soon thereafter, Acosta emailed Lourie, Villafafia,
and the West Palm Beach manager to set up a call to discuss “who we tell and how much,” adding,
“Nice job with a difficult negotiation.”

The final NPA, as signed by Epstein, his attorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez, and Villafafia,
contained the following pertinent provisions:

Charges: Epstein would plead guilty to the pending Palm Beach County indictment,

plus one count of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, a
registrable offense.

Sentence: The parties would make a joint, binding recommendation for a 30-month
sentence divided as follows: consecutive terms of 12 months and 6 months
in the county jail, without opportunity for withholding adjudication or
sentencing and without community control or probation, followed by
12 months of community control, consecutive. !°°

Damages: As long as the identified victims proceeded exclusively under 18 U.S.C.
§ 2255, Epstein would not contest federal court jurisdiction or the victims’
status as victims. The USAO would provide to Epstein a list of individuals

129 The West Palm Beach manager told OPR that he called Chief Reiter, who was “fine” with the outcome.
10 Withholding adjudication or sentencing referred to a special sentence in which the judge orders probation
but does not formally convict the defendant of a criminal offense. See Fla. Stat. § 948.01 (2007).
