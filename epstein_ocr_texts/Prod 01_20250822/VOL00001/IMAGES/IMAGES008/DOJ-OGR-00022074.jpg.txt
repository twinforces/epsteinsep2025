1. Applicable Law

A. Brady & Giglio

The Government has an obligation under the Due Process Clause to make a timely
disclosure of any exculpatory or impeaching evidence that is material and in its possession. See
Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963); Giglio v. United States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972); see also
United States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 139-40 (2d Cir. 2001). Evidence is “material” in this sense
only if “its suppression undermines confidence in the outcome ofa trial.” United States v. Bagley,
473 U.S. 667, 678 (1985). “The rationale underlying Brady is not to supply a defendant with all
the evidence in the Government’s possession which might conceivably assist the preparation of
his defense, but to assure that the defendant will not be denied access to exculpatory evidence only
known to the Government.” United States v. LeRoy, 687 F.2d 610, 619 (2d Cir. 1982) (citing
United States v. Ruggiero, 472 F.2d 599, 604 (2d Cir. 1973)).

Impeachment evidence is material only “where the witness at issue supplied the only
evidence linking the defendant(s) to the crime, or where the likely impact on the witness’s
credibility would have undermined a critical element of the prosecution’s case.” United States v.
Payne, 63 F.3d 1200, 1210 (2d Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
Similarly, “where the undisclosed evidence merely furnishes an additional basis on which to
challenge a witness whose credibility has already been shown to be questionable or is subject to
extensive attack by reason of other evidence, the undisclosed evidence may properly be viewed as
cumulative, and hence not material.” United States v. Persico, 645 F.3d 85, 111 (2d Cir. 2011)
(citing cases). With regard to the timing of disclosing material under Giglio, the Second Circuit,
in Coppa, rejected the argument that such material should be disclosed when defendants make a
