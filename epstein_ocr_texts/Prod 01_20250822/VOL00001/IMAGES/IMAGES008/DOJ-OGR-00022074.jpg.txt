ARGUMENT
I. Applicable Law

A. Brady & Giglio

The Government: has, an. obligation ‘under the: Duc Process Clause to make’ a. timely’
disclosure of:any exculpatory or impeaching evidence that. is material. and in its possession. See
United States ¥. ‘Goppas 267 F.3d 132, 139-40 (2d.Cir. 2001). Evidence is “material” in this sense
only if “its suppression undermines confidence in:the outcome:of atrial.” Wnited States v: Bagley,
473. U.S. 667, 678 (1985). “The rationale underlying Brady.is not to supply a defendant with, all.
the evidence in, the Government’s possession, Which might conceivably’ assist the preparation of

Payne, 63 F.3d 1200, 121.0 (2d. Cir. 1995) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
Similarly, “where the ‘uridisclosed. evidenee ‘merely ‘furnishes’ an, additional basis on ‘which to
challenge: a ‘witness whose credibility ‘has already been shown to be questionable or is subject to
extensive attack by*reason of other evidence; the undisclosed evidence may. properly be viewed.as
cumulative, and hence not. material.” United States v.. Persico, 645. F.3d 85, 11.1. (2d Gir. 2011)
(citing cases). With regard to the timing of disclosing material under Giglio, the Second, Circuit,

in Coppa, rejected the argument that such material should. be :discloséd when defendants make a.
