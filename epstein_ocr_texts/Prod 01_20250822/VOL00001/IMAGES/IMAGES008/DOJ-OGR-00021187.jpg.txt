‘Interactions with victims:that.ultimately led ‘to public and.court.condemnation ofthe government’s
treatment of the victims, teflected poor ly on'the Department as a ‘whole, and is contradictory to the
Department’s: mission.to:minimize.the frustration and.confusion.that.victims of a crime endure.

OPR. determined. that none ‘of the subjects was ‘responsible for communications ‘sent. to
certain victims after the NPA was signed:that described the case:as’“under investigation” and. that:
failed’to: inform them, of the NPA. The letters sere sent by an FBI administrative employee who
was not directly involved in. the investigation, incorporated. standard, form, language. used ‘by the
FBI when communicating with, victims, and were not. drafted or reviewed, by the subjects.
Morcover, the statement that the matter was “under investigation” was not false because the:
government in fact continued to, investigate the case in anticipation that Epstein. would not fulfill,
the terms of the. NBA. However, the letters risked misleading the: victims:and contributed to:victim
‘frustration. and confusioi by. failing to provide important: inforiatioi about the status of the
investigation. The: letters ‘also demonstrated. a. lack: of coordination. between the: federal ‘agencies
responsible ‘for communicating with Epstein’s Victiins and showed a lack of attention to, and.
oversight regarding communication with. victims.

After the NPA. was signed, Acosta, clected to defer to the: State Attorney ‘the decision.
whether. to notify: victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant'to the state’s own victim’s rights
requirements. Although Acosta’s. decision was within his authority and did not; constitute
professional. misconduct, ORR. concludes that Acosta exercised. poor judgment when he failed to
make certain that the state intended, to; and would. notify Victims identified through. the federal.
investigation about the state:plea hearing.. His decision.left victims uninformed about:an important.
proceeding thatitesolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO. had.
communicated with victims for months. It-also ultimately created ‘the misimpression. that. the:
Department intentionally sought:to silence. the victims. Acosta failed to ensure:that:victims were:
made aware of a court proceeding that was related to their own cases, and.thus he failed:to ‘ensure:
that victims were treated: with forthrightness and dignity:.

OPR concludes that:the decision.to postpone notifying victims about the terms ofthe NPA.
after it was Signed and the omission, of information, about the NPA. during Victim interviews, and.
conversations with. victims’ attorneys in. 2008 do not constitute professional misconduct.
Contempoéranedts récords show that these actions were based on sti atégic concerns abotit creating
impeachment evidence that. Epstein’s victims had financial motives to make claims against. him,
evidence that could be used against victims at.a trial, and were not: for the purpose: of silencing,
victims. Nonetheless, the: failure! to reevaluate ‘the strategy prior to interviews of victims and

discussions: with victims’ attorneys occurring in 2008. led.'to interactions, that contributed ‘to
victims’ feelings thatthe government: was intentionally. concealing information from them.

After examining the full scope and-context of the goveriment’s interactions with victims,
OPR. concludes that the: government’s lack .of transparency and. its inconsistent messages Iced ‘to
Victis feeling conftised and ill-treated by the government; gave victims and. thé public the
misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel to keep: the NPA secret.
from the:victims; and-undereut public confidence inthe legitimacy of the resulting agreement. The
‘overall, result of the subjects” anomalous handling of this case understandably left. many victims
fecling:ignored:and frustrated and resulted in. extensive public:criticism. In sum, OPR.concludes
