various iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”**° Villafafia explained to OPR her reference
to the victims:

[M]y concern was that [Menchel] was violating the CVRA which

requires the attorneys for the government, which[] includes me[,] to

confer with the victims, and the [VRRA], which requires the agents

to keep the victims apprised of what’s happening with the case. So

in essence, I felt like he was exposing both myself and the agents to

allegations of not abiding by our obligations by engaging in these

plea negotiations without letting us know about it.7°°

In his reply to Villafafia’s email, and after noting that he found her email “totally
inappropriate,” Menchel denied that he had violated any Departmental policy, and he noted that
“Ta]s Chief of the Criminal Division, I am the person designated by the U.S. Attorney to exercise
appropriate discretion in deciding whether certain pleas are appropriate and consistent with”
Departmental policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafafia
responded, “[R]aising concerns about the forgotten voices of victims in this case should not be
classified as a lapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in this case . . . is the victims.”
Menchel told OPR that he did not view his conversation with Sanchez as a plea offer,
asserted that he was not obligated to consult with victims during preliminary settlement
negotiations, and noted that he left the USAO before the NPA was fully negotiated or signed.
Menchel told OPR that “you have discussions . . . with [the] defense all the time, and the notion
that even just having a general discussion is something that must be vetted with victims . . . is not
even ... in the same universe as to how I think about this.” Menchel also observed that on the
very day that Villafafia criticized him for engaging in settlement negotiations without consulting
her, the FBI, or the victims, Villafafia had herself sent an email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the
possibility of a federal resolution of Mr. Epstein’s case that could run concurrently with any state
resolution,” without having spoken to the victims about her proposal.7°”
285 Villafafia told OPR that “some victims, I felt strongly, would have objected to [a state-only disposition].”
Villafaiia stated to OPR that at the time Menchel engaged in such negotiations, he would only have been aware of the
victim information contained in her prosecution memorandum, which included information about the “effects on the
victims” but did not likely contain information as to “how they would like the case resolved.” Villafafia asserted that
Menchel “never reached out to any of the victims to find out what their position would be.” Menchel told OPR that
the allegations in Villafafia’s email that he violated the Ashcroft Memo, USAM, and the CVRA were “way out of line
in terms of what the law is and the policies are.”
286 As discussed, the Department’s position at the time was that the CVRA did not apply before charges were
filed against a defendant.
287 In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Villafafia’s counsel asserted that her email to Sanchez was intended
only to determine whether Epstein was interested in opening plea negotiations.
