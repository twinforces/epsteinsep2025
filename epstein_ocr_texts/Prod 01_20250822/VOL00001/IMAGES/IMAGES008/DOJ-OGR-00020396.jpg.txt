07/21/2020 | 27 | LETTER MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from Jeffrey S. Pagliuca
dated July 21, 2020 re: Local Criminal Rule 23.1 . Document filed by Ghislaine
Maxwell. (Pagliuca, Jeffrey) (Entered: 07/21/2020)

07/23/2020 | 28 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Defense has moved for an order "prohibiting
the Government, its agents and counsel for witnesses from making extrajudicial
statements concerning this case." Dkt. No. 27 at 1. The Court firmly expects that
counsel for all involved parties will exercise great care to ensure compliance with this
Court's local rules, including Local Criminal Rule 23.1, and the rules of professional
responsibility. In light of this clear expectation, the Court does not believe that further
action is needed at this time to protect the Defendant's right to a fair trial by an
impartial jury. Accordingly, it denies the Defendant's motion without prejudice. But
the Court warns counsel and agents for the parties and counsel for potential witnesses
that going forward it will not hesitate to take appropriate action in the face of
violations of any relevant rules. The Court will ensure strict compliance with those
rules and will ensure that the Defendant's right to a fair trial will be safeguarded.
