investigation.“ > _ Media Teports in. mid “2009 suggested Epstein ‘was; released from | his state:

District of ‘New York involving Epstein’ Ss: former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafania
was notified by the. AUSAS handling the ivatter that they “had never heard of” Epstein and,he was
providing: “absolutely no cooperation: to the: government. In 2011, Villafata reported to: senior
colleagues, that “this is utban.inyth. The EBI and I looked into ‘this and de not’ béelieve'that any of:
itis true.” Villafana told OPR that the: rumor that. Epstein-had cooperated with the case in New
York.was “completely-false:? Acosta'told‘OPR that:he did not have any information.about Epstein
cooperating ‘in a financial, investigation or relating. to media ‘reports that Epstein had. been, an,
“intelligence: asset.?4

In. addition to the: ‘contemporancous record attesting that Epstein. was: not a cooperating.
‘witness:in a federal:matter; OPR found: no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a. cooperating
witness or. “intelligence “asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s
ifvestigation—belicved that to, be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a
basis. OPR did not find ‘any reference to Epstein’ 'S purported ‘cooperation, or even ‘a suggestion
that he had assisted in.a.different:matter, in any‘of'the numerous communications sent by defense
counsel to the USAO' and the Department. It-is highly unlikely that-defense counsel would have
omitted any:reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had.existed.

Accordingly, OPR. concludes that none of the: subjects of OPR’s investigation provided
Epstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness, ih an unrelated ‘federal.
investigation, and OPR. found no: evidence ‘establishing that: Epstein had. received benefits .for
coopération:in.any matter.

V. ACOSTA. EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY ‘RESOLVING THE. FEDERAL
INVESTIGATION THROUGH THE: NPA

Although ‘OPR finds that none ofthe subjects committed professional. misconduct! in, this,
matter, OPR. concludes ‘that. Acosta exercised. poor judgment when, he: agreed. to end, the federal.
investigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed.application of Petite policy principles to this case:
federal investigation.through an. NPA. that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to
manipulate the conditions of his’ sentence to his own advantage. The NPA relicd on, state
authorities:to implement its key-terms, leading to.an:absence of control. by:federal. authorities over
the:process. Although the prosecutors. considered certain events that they addressed inthe NPA,
such as gain time: and. community. control,:many other key issues were not, such as: work release:
and mechanisms for iinplementing the § 2255: Provision. Important; provisions, such as promising
not to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were: added. with little discussion. ‘or.consideration.
by ‘the prosecutors. Th addition, although ‘theré were evidentiary and legal challenges to a

a See, eg; Julie, K. Brown; “Perversion, of Justice: How a; future Trump, Cabinet member vaye a serial sex,

abuser the deal of'a lifetime,”” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2018.

aa ‘Whei! OPR. asked Aosta about-his apparent équivoecation during: his 2019 préss conference, di answering a.

media question: about whether he;had’knowledge. of Epstein’being.an.“intelligence, asset? Acosta stated toeOPR that:
“the answerisino.” Acosta was madefaware that OPR. could use a.classitied setting:to discuss’ intelligence:information.
