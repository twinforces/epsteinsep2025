Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024, 3636586, Page18 of 51
immunity by “the United States” is to be construed against the defendant—binding
just one USAO rather than the Government as a whole, “unless it affirmatively
appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 771 F.2d at 672.
Annabi did not explain or acknowledge its departure from this longstanding doctrine.

This Court has been exceedingly reluctant, until now, to affirm a conviction
on the force of Annabi’s reasoning. Previous decisions from this Court that cited
Annabi have done so essentially in dictum (as in cases involving unambiguous plea
agreements, which do not require resort to Annabi’s canon of construction),° or for
points unrelated to whether an agreement with one USAO will bind another,°® or—
in one case—in an unpublished decision that provided too little information to clarify
whether the plea agreement as a whole was ambiguous.’

Annabi’s analytical faults support limiting application of the rule. Cf Egbert
