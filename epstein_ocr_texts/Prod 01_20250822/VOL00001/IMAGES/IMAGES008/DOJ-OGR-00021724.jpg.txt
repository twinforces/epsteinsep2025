Case 22-1426, Document 79;.06/29/2023, 3536060, Page?7 of 93

Juror 50: credibly testified at the hearing that he was.
able to put aside his experience of sexual abuse and
judge the evidence fairly. This is not the sort of “ex-
treme situation that call[s] for mandatory removal.”

and sex trafficking, and despite his own. credible testi-
mony’ under the penalty of perjury, establishing that’

nor should it be.” (A.346-47).

Finally, Maxwell suggests that Judge Nathan
abused her discretion by. precluding. defense counsel.
from questioning Juror 50, and pr ecluding 1 inquiry into
Juror 50's “statements to journalists.’ (Br. 70). As to

tent to which'‘the parties may‘ participate in question-
