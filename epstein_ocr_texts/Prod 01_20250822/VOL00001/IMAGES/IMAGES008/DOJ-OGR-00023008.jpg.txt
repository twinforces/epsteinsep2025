investigate, litigate, or provide legal advice.? OPR also has jurisdiction to investigate allegations
of misconduct against Department law enforcement agents when they relate to a Department
attorney’s alleged professional misconduct.

In its investigations, OPR determines whether a clear and unambiguous standard governs
the challenged conduct and whether a subject attorney violated that standard. Department
attorneys are subject to various legal obligations and professional standards in the performance of
their duties, including the Constitution, statutes, standards of conduct imposed by attorney
licensing authorities, and Department regulations and policies. OPR finds misconduct when it
concludes by a preponderance of the evidence that a subject attorney violated such a standard
intentionally or recklessly. Pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework, when OPR concludes that
(1) no clear and unambiguous standard governs the conduct in question or (2) the subject did not
intentionally or recklessly violate the standard that governs the conduct, then it concludes that the
subject’s conduct does not constitute professional misconduct. In some cases, OPR may conclude
that a subject attorney’s conduct does not satisfy the elements necessary for a professional
misconduct finding, but that the circumstances warrant another finding. In such cases, OPR may
conclude that a subject attorney exercised poor judgment, made a mistake, or otherwise acted
inappropriately under the circumstances. OPR may also determine that the subject attorney’s
conduct was appropriate under the circumstances. !°
IV. ISSUES CONSIDERED

In this investigation, OPR considered two distinct sets of allegations. The first relates to
the negotiation, execution, and implementation of the NPA. The second relates to the USAO’s
interactions with Epstein’s victims and adherence to the requirements of the CVRA. The two sets
of issues are described below and are analyzed separately in this Report.

A. The Negotiation, Execution, and Implementation of the NPA

In evaluating whether any of the subjects committed professional misconduct, OPR
considered whether any of the NPA’s provisions violated a clear or unambiguous statute,
professional responsibility rule or standard, or Department regulation or policy. In particular, OPR
considered whether the NPA violated standards relating to (1) charging decisions, (2) declination
of criminal charges, (3) deferred or non-prosecution agreements, (4) plea agreements, (5) grants
2 28 C.F.R. § 0.39a(a)(1). OPR has authority to investigate the professional conduct of attorneys occurring
during their employment by the Department, regardless of whether the attorney left the Department before or during
OPR’s investigation. Over its 45-year history, OPR has routinely investigated the conduct of former Department
attorneys. Although former Department attorneys cannot be disciplined by the Department, OPR’s determination that
a former Department attorney violated state rules of professional conduct for attorneys could result in a referral to an
appropriate state attorney disciplinary authority. Furthermore, findings resulting from investigations of the conduct
of Department attorneys, even former employees, may assist Department managers in supervising future cases.

10 In some instances, OPR declines to open an investigation based upon a review of the initial complaint or after
a preliminary inquiry into the matter. In December 2010, one of the attorneys representing victims in the CVRA
litigation raised allegations that Epstein may have exerted improper influence over the federal criminal investigation
and that the USAO had deceived the victims of Epstein’s crimes about the existence of the NPA. Pursuant to its
standard policy, OPR declined to open an investigation into those allegations at that time in deference to the
then-pending CVRA litigation.
