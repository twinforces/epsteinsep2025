07/07/2020 10 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing in
this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers will
email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others may
access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited capacity of the
internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate by video. Co-
counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed of the
proceeding by calling a dial-in number, which the Court will provide in advance of the
proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public interest in this case, a
video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for viewing in the Jury Assembly
Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York,
NY. Due to social distancing requirements, seating will be extremely limited; when
capacity is reached no additional persons will be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID-19
Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who appears at any $.D.N.Y. courthouse must
complete a questionnaire on the date of the proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse.
All visitors must also have their temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse.
Please see the instructions, attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will
save time and effort upon entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements
established by the questionnaire and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be
allowed to enter the courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be
worn at all times. Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID-19 protocols that have
been adopted by the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no
exceptions. As discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible,
discuss the Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant
prior to the proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the
form (either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20-MC-174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24 hours
prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is unable to
obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct an inquiry at
the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the Court to add the
Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. ยง 3771(c)(1), the Government
must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and accorded, the
rights provided to them in that section. This includes [t]he right to reasonable, accurate,
and timely notice of any public court proceeding... involving the crime or of any release...
of the accused and "[t]he right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the
district court involving release." Id. ยง 3771(a)(2), (4). The Court will inquire with the
