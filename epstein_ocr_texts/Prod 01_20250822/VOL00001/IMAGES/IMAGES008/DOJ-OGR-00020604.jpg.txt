Case 22-1426, Document 40, 01/12/2023, 3451920, Page3 of 4
deadline of January 30, 2023, is the difficulty we have had communicating with our client who
is incarcerated in Tallahassee, Florida, with limited phone access.

8. We have been working diligently on this case and have identified several issues
that we believe merit appellate review. However, there is still considerable work to be done. We
find that we need an additional month beyond the current deadline to complete this important
work responsibly.

9, We believe that the above represents extraordinary circumstances that justify the
relief sought. Denial of this application would cause irreparable harm to our client.

10. Assistant United States Attorney Andrew Rohrbach informed me today that
Respondent United States Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York does not
object to the Court granting our motion for an additional one-month extension of time to file
Appellant’s brief.

11. | Werespectfully request that the Court extend our time to file our brief to February
28, 2023. We are cognizant that the Court warned that “[flurther extensions of time will be
disfavored.” For this reason, we request only the additional time that we believe is absolutely
necessary in order to effectively represent our client.

WHEREFORE, it is respectfully requested that this Court issue an Order granting
Appellant’s motion in its entirety, and for such other and further relief as this Court deems just
and proper.

Dated: January 12, 2023
New York, New York Respectfully Submitted,
