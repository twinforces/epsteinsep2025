preparing a “short” charging document “with only ‘clean’ victims that they have not dirtied up
already.””°° The fact that Lourie apparently used information gleaned from the defense about the
victims’ credibility to formulate his charging recommendation supported his statements to OPR
that such meetings were, in his experience, a useful source of information that could be factored
into the government’s charging strategy.

The two February 2007 Villafafia/Lourie-level meetings focused on witness issues and
claims of misconduct by state investigators, but in late May 2007, defense attorneys requested
another meeting—this time with higher-level supervisors Menchel and Sloman—to make a
presentation concerning legal deficiencies in a potential federal prosecution. The request was
granted after Lourie recommended to Menchel and Sloman that “[i]t would probably be helpful to
us... to hear their legal arguments in case we have missed something.” The requested meeting
took place on June 26, 2007. Before the meeting, at Menchel’s direction, Villafafia provided to
the defense a list of statutes the USAO was considering as the basis for federal charges. Defense
counsel used that information to prepare a 19-page letter, submitted to the USAO the day before
the June 26 meeting, as “an overview” of the defense position. In an email to his colleagues,
Lourie evaluated the defense submission, noting its weaker and stronger arguments. A
contemporaneous email indicates that Menchel, Lourie, and Villafafia viewed the meeting itself as
primarily a “listening session.””*! After the meeting, Epstein’s team submitted a second lengthy
letter to the USAO detailing Epstein’s “federalism” arguments that the USAO should let the state
handle the matter.

Menchel apparently scheduled the next meeting with defense counsel, on July 31, 2007, to
facilitate the USAO’s presentation to the defense team of the “term sheet” describing the proposed
terms of a non-prosecution agreement.

By early August, after the Kirkland & Ellis attorneys—Starr and Lefkowitz—joined the
defense team, Acosta believed they would likely “go to DC on the case, on the grounds. . . that I
have not met with them.” A meeting with the defense team was eventually scheduled for
September 7, 2007, when Acosta, Sloman, Villafafia, and Oosterbaan met with Starr, Lefkowitz,
and Sanchez. In an email to Sloman, Acosta explained that he intended to meet with the defense,
with Oosterbaan participating, “to discuss general legal policy only.” In another email to Sloman
and Lourie, Acosta explained, “This will end up [in the Department] anyhow, if we don’t meet
with them. I’d rather keep it here. Bringing [the CEOS Chief] in visibly does so. If our deadline
has to slip a bit to do that, it’s worth it.”” Acosta told OPR that the meeting “was not a negotiation,”
but a chance for the defense to present their federalism arguments. Acosta said that he had already
decided how he wanted to resolve the case, and “[t]he September meeting did not alter or shift our
position.”

230 Lourie also recommended that the initial charging document “should contain only the victims they have
nothing on at all.”

231 During her OPR interview, the FBI case agent recalled that defense counsel asked questions about the
government’s case, including the number of victims and the type of sexual contact involved, and that during a break
in the meeting, she engaged in a “discussion” with Menchel about providing this information to the defense. She did
not recall specifics of the discussion, however.
