C. Juror No. 50’s False Responses Deprived Ms. Maxwell of her
Constitutional Right to a Trial by an Impartial Jury
1. Juror 50 Did Not Truthfully Answer Material Questions During Voir

Dire

Juror No. 50’s answers to Questions 25 ,48, and 49 were indisputably false.
Juror Questionnaire at A289

At the hearing, Juror No. 50 admitted that he gave multiple false answers
during voir dire which resulted in the concealment of his experience as a victim of
child sexual abuse but denied that his misstatements were intentional. Of some 50
questions, only questions that would have revealed his sexual abuse history were
answered incorrectly. Juror 50 denied that he had ever been a victim of a crime
because he was thinking about other types of crime and because his “healing
process” meant that he did not consider himself a victim (#25); denied that he was
the victim of sexual abuse because he was distracted and misread the question
(#48); and denied that he had a family member who had been accused of a crime
because he did not think of his step-brother who sexually abused him as family
(#49). A268-270.
