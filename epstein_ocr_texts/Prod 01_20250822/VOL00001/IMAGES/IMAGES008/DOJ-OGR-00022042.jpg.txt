“favorable” under Brady and must be disclosed by the government. Jd. at 676-77; see also Giglio
v. United States, 405 U.S. 150, 154-55 (1972); In re Sealed Case No. 99-3096 (Brady
Obligations), 185 F.3d 887, 892 (D.C. Cir. 1999). Moreover, the defense is already in possession
of witness statements that one or both of the defendants in this indictment may have conducted
rounds or inmate counts on August 10, 2019. Accordingly, there is a logical assumption that
there might be additional exculpatory statements contained in the Inspector General’s report or
certain internal reports maintained by the BOP internal affairs division or other government
agencies that were conducting a contemporaneous investigation with FBI.

The prosecution must produce to the defense not only all favorable evidence that is
admissible, but also all evidence “that is likely to lead to favorable evidence that would be
admissible.” Safavian, 233 at 17 (quoting United States v. Sudikoff, 36 F. Supp. 2d 1196, 1198-
99 (C.D,Cal, 1999)). Just as with Rule 16 disclosure, the government must interpret its Brady
obligations broadly. “Where doubt exists as to the usefulness of the evidence to the defendant,
the government must resolve all such doubts in favor of full disclosure.” fd. (citing United States
v. Paxson, 861 F.2d 730, 737 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Without question, the Brady disclosure
obligation is broader than Rule 16 because it requires production not just of documents, but also
of information known to the government that has been documented in some fashion.

. In Safavian, the court explained the materiality standard under Brady that applies to
pretrial discovery: .
[T]he government must always produce any potentially

exculpatory or otherwise favorable evidence without regard to how
the withholding of such evidence might be viewed-- with the
benefit of hindsight--as affecting the outcome of the trial. The
question before trial is not whether the government thinks that
disclosure of the information or evidence it is considering
withholding might change the outcome of the trial going forward,
but whether the evidence is favorable and therefore must be
disclosed.
