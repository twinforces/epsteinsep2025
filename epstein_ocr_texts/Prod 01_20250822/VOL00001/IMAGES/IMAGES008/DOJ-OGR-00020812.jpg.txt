Case 22-1426, Document 57_02/28/2023, 3475900, Page194 of 208
renewed motion for substantially the same reasons set forth in its April 16 opinion. The Court
will proceed to briefly explain why neither the new charges in the S2 superseding indictment nor
the supplemental authority Maxwell cites change the Court’s conclusion that the NPA does not
bar the charges against her.

As the Court explained in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order, the Second Circuit held in
United States v. Annabi that “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States
Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the
agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 771 F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam).
The Second Circuit’s opinion in Annabi is clear, and that court has followed it steadfastly since.
See, e.g., United States v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004); United States v.
Brown, No. 99-1230(L), 2002 WL 34244994, at *2 (2d Cir. Apr. 26, 2002); United States v.
Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam); United States v. Rivera, 844 F.2d 916,
923 (2d Cir. 1988). The Second Circuit has held that language nearly identical to that in
Epstein’s NPA is not enough to overcome the presumption in favor of single-district plea
agreements. See Salameh, 152 F.3d at 120. Adhering to this binding authority, this Court thus
concluded (and continues to conclude) that the NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney’s Office for
the Southern District of New York. It thus provides Maxwell no defense in this case even if it
would otherwise cover the conduct charged in the new counts in the S2 superseding indictment.

Maxwell advances two new arguments for why the Court should depart from this
reasoning—the first in her renewed motion and the second in a letter of supplemental authority.
See Dkt. Nos. 293, 310. In her renewed motion, she contends that Annabi contains an exception
for out-of-district prosecutions for charges that are “identical to the dismissed charges.” And in
the letter of supplemental authority, she contends that the opinion of the Pennsylvania Supreme
