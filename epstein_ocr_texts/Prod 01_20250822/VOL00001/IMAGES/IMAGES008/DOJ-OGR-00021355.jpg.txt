accept the two-year proposal when it was made, but instead. continued. to press :fora sentence of:
home confinement, suggesting that the defense had ‘not requested the two-year term.as a;favor and
did not view it.as such. The defense had. previously rejected. the state’s offer..of a sentence of
probation, and there iso indication if the contemporaneous records that: Epsteii viewed any jail,
sentence favorably and certainly that didnot appear to be'the view of. the: defense team: in-the carly.

As discussed below, afterextensive questioning of the subjects about the basis:for the two-
year offer, and.a thorough ‘review of the documentary record, OPR. was unable to determine the
reasoning under lying the decision. to offer two years as: the term. of incarceration, :as: opposed. to
any other’ terin.of years: Nonetheless, OPR- concludes from the evidence that-Acostaswas.aware of.
and approved the initial offer to the defense, which ‘included the two- -year term of. incarceration.
The only evidence suggesting that'the offerof two years.stemmied froin aii. improper motivation. of.
Menchel’s.was a single second-hand statement.in.an email drafted. many years later. Sloman, the:
purported declarant, told OPR. that he:could not-recall whether he made-the statement, but-he firmly
disputed ‘that the email. accurately reflected. cither. the reason for the two-year ‘proposal. or his
understanding. of that reason. Villafafia herself could remember little: about ‘the critical.
Given. the lack of any. corroborating: evidence, and. the evidence: showing Epstein’s vigorous
resistance to the proposal, OPR. concludes ‘that: there is no evidence ‘to: support, the statement in,
Villafaiia’s 2018 ‘email. that. Menchel. had extended atwo- -year plea deal as a favor to one of
Epstein’s attorneys.

E. The Evidence Does Not Establish That the Subjects’ Meetings with, Defense
Counsel Were Improper Benefits to Epstein

OPR considered whether decisions by. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie ‘to meet with.
defense counsel while & possible: char ges | were under consideration or during | the ‘period a after the

toward.o or the provision of 2 an. impr oper benefit to the: ‘Epstein defense team.

‘1. The Evidence Shows That the Subjects’ Decisions to Meet with
Epstein’s Legal Team Were Warranted by Strategic:‘Considerations.

Although pre- -indictment: negotiations are typical. i in. white-collar criminal cases involving,
financial crimes, Witnesses told‘OPR that: pre-charge mectings with defense counsel. are infrequent!
in sex:offense:cases. .As the:lead prosecutor, Villafana vehemently opposed.-mecting with Epstein’s
attorneys and:voiced her concerns to her stipervisors, but was overruled by them. In, Villafana’s
view, ‘the significance of the carly meetings granted ‘to: the defense: team, was ‘that, but for those:
mectings, the USAO would.not have offered the disposition set forth in the July. 31, 2007 “term.

OPR’s inv estigation. established that while the defense attorneys persistently. contacted the
subjects through emails, correspondence, and phone calls, relatively few in- -person mectings
actually occurred with the USAO personnel invelved in the matter, As show. in the chart on, the
following page, while the case was ‘under federal investigation. and. before the: NPA was signed,
the subject. supervisors’ and: defense cotinsel. had five substantive ‘nectings abotit the -case—
