10 count. Do I have that right?

11 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.

12 THE COURT: All right. Thank you.

13 I want to thank counsel. As I indicated, I do thank
14 the victims who made statements in writing or orally and their
15 counsel who supported them in that endeavor. I thank counsel
16 for Ms. Maxwell and counsel for the government.

17 We are adjourned.
