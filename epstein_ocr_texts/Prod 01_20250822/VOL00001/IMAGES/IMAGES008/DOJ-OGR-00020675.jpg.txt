10/15/2021 353. | ENDORSED LETTER as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan
from Counsels of record for the Government dated 10/15/21 re: Government response to
Order of The Court dated 10/15/21 (Dkt No. 348). ENDORSEMENT: Based on the
information in this letter the Court will not enter the Defendant's requested order. See
Dkt. 346. However, it is the Court's firm expectation that a defendant in a pre-trial posture
like Ms. Maxwell will in most circumstances receive legal mail within approximately 1
business day. Going forward, if another delay occurs, the Defendant may renew the
request for a specific order requiring delivery within the time frame. With this
understanding and in light of the unusually early pre-trial disclosure schedule set by the
Court, the Court remains confident that Ms. Maxwell and her attorneys are fully able to
prepare for trial. This resolves Dkt. No. 346. SO Ordered.. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
Nathan on 10/15/21)Gm) (Entered: 10/15/2021)
