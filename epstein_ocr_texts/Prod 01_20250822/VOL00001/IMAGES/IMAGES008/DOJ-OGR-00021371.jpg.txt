Notably, in the early 2000s, the Department had begun pursuing specific initiatives to combat child
sex trafficking, including Project Safe Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the
PROTECT Act. Acosta himself told OPR that the exploitation of minors was “‘an important federal
interest,” which in Epstein’s case was compounded by the “‘sordidness” of the acts involved and
the number of victims.

It is also clear that because the state case against Epstein was still pending and had not
reached a conviction, acquittal, or other decision on the merits, the Petite policy did not apply and
certainly did not preclude a federal prosecution of Epstein. He had been charged with one state
charge of solicitation to prostitution on three occasions, involving one or more other persons
without regard to age—a charge that would have addressed only a scant portion of the conduct
under federal investigation. Acosta acknowledged to OPR that the Petite policy “on its face” did
not apply. Moreover, the State Attorney did not challenge the federal government’s assumption
of prosecutorial responsibility, and despite having obtained an indictment, held back on proceeding
with the state prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these
circumstances, the USAO was free to proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication
of the federal interest in prosecuting a man who traveled interstate repeatedly to prey upon minors.
The federal government was uniquely positioned to fully investigate the conduct of an individual
who engaged in repeated criminal conduct in Florida but who also traveled extensively and had
residences outside of Florida. Even if the Petite policy had applied, OPR has little doubt that the
USAO could have obtained authorization from the Department to proceed with a prosecution under
the circumstances of this case.”4°

Despite the undeniable federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact that the Petite policy
did not apply, and the State Attorney’s willingness to hold the state prosecution in abeyance
pending the federal government’s assumption of the case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s
role in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.”“° In essence, Acosta believed
that a federal prosecution would have interfered improperly with the state’s authority. He
explained his reasoning to OPR:

245 In 2008, the Office of Enforcement Operations, the office charged with reviewing Petite policy waiver
requests, opined that even if the Petite policy applied with respect to the victims of the indicted state charges, it would
not apply to federal prosecution of charges relating to any other victim. The office also noted that if other factors
existed, such as use of the internet to contact victims, those factors might warrant a waiver of the policy, if it did apply.
aus In commenting on OPR’s draft report, Acosta’s counsel argued that OPR inappropriately bifurcated Acosta’s
concerns from those of the other subjects. However, OPR’s investigation made clear that, although Acosta shared his
subordinates’ concerns about the strength of the case, victim-witness credibility, and the novelty of some legal
theories, he alone focused on federalism issues. Acosta’s counsel also asserted that OPR “misunderstands and
devalues Secretary Acosta’s very real and legitimate interest in the development of human trafficking laws,” and
counsel further noted Acosta’s concerns that “bringing a case with serious evidentiary challenges pressing novel legal
issues could result in an outcome that set back the development of trafficking laws and resulted in an aggregate greater
harm to trafficking victims.” Although OPR carefully considered counsel’s arguments and agrees that it was
appropriate to consider any implications the proposed prosecution of Epstein might have for the Department’s anti-
trafficking efforts, OPR does not believe that those concerns warranted resolving the matter through the NPA, which,
for the reasons discussed in this Section, failed to satisfy the federal interest and allowed Epstein to manipulate the
state system to his benefit.
