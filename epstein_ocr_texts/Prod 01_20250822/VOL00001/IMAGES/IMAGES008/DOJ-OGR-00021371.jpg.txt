Notably, inthe early 2000s, the. Department.had begun pursuing specific initiatives:to combat child.
Sex trafficking, including Project Safe. Childhood, and Congress had then recently passed the
PROTECT Act. Acosta himself told-OPR that the: exploitation. of'minors-was “an. important: federal.
interest,” which in Epstein’s case was: compounded by the “sordidiess” of the acts itivolved and
the:number of: victims.

It is also clear that: because the state case against: Epstein, was still pending :and had not
reached.a conviction, acquittal, or other decision on the merits, the.Petite policy.did not apply and
certainly did not: preclude a federal. prosecution of Epstein. He had. been charged. with, one state
charge’ of solicitation. to prostitution. on. three occasions, involving one or ‘more other persons
‘without regard, to age—a charge. that would ‘have. addressed ‘only. a; Scant portion of the. conduct
under federal’ investigation. Acosta acknowledged to OPR that the ‘Petite policy ** ‘on its face” did
not apply. Moreover; the State Attorney did. not.challenge the federal governmerit’s assuniption.
‘of prosecutorial responsibility, and despite havingobtained.an:indictment,-held.back.on proceeding,
With, the state, prosecution in deference to the federal government’s involvement. In these
circumstances, the: USAO. was free:to’proceed with a prosecution sufficient to ensure vindication
of the:federal:interest:in prosecuting a:man,who traveled.interstate repeatedly to. prey upon minors.
The: federal, government. was uniquely: positioned. to fully investigate: the conduct, of an individual.
who engaged ‘in. repeated. criminal ‘conduct ‘in Florida ‘but who also traveled extensively and. had.
residences outside of Florida. Even, if the Petite: policy had applied, OPR.has little doubt that the
USAO could have:obtained authorization.from.the Department :to proceed with a prosecution.under:
the circumstances of this case.22>

Despite the tindeniablé federal interest in prosecuting Epstein, the fact thatthe Petite policy
did not apply, and. the: State Attorney’ s willingness to hold. the: state. prosecution, in abeyance:
pending the federal government’s-assumption ofthe case, Acosta viewed the federal government’s
role.in prosecuting Epstein as limited by principles of federalism.?** In‘essence, Acosta believed.
that a federal prosecution. would. have ‘interfered. improperly with the state’s. authority. He
explained his reasoning to OPR:

theories, he alone: focused on federalism issues. Acosta's counsel, also asserted. that ‘OPR: “misunderstands. and,
‘devalues Secretary. Acosta’s very‘real ‘and legitimate interest ‘in, the development of human. trafficking laws,” and
