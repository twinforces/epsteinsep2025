anything’ she wanted” without the necessity of legal process. Lewis asked ‘to meet with Villafaiia
and Sloman to discuss the Epstein investigation, but Villafana declined.

Shortly'thereafter, Lilly Ann Sanchez, a:former AUSA, contacted. Sloman and advised.him.
that she also represented. Epstein. Sanchez was employed by the USAO from 2000 to September
2005 and.had been.a_Deputy Chief-ofthe USAO’s Major Grimes section.at the time Menchel was
the Chief. According to Sloman’s contemporaneous email recounting the conversation, when.
Sanchez:indicated:to-him that his:participation in. Lewis’s call-with Villafafia led the defense team.
to beli¢ve'that,the matter had been “elevated’*within the USAO, Sloan tried to “disabuse” her:of
that notion. Sanchez said that Epstein." ‘wanted to be as transparent. and. cooperative as: possible”
in working with the USAO. Despite’ the fact;that: Lewis: had already’ made contact with the USAO
on. Epstein’ s:bchalf, Sanchez sentia letter to Villafaiia.on:November 1'5,,2006, in.which she asserted
that she and Gerald Lefeourt were representing Epstein and.asked’ that'the’ USAO ditect all contact
or ‘communications about. Epstein to them. In response, V illafafia requested. that. the defense
provide doctiments and information pertinent tothe federal investigation, includiigthe-doctinents
and information that. Epstein. had ‘previously. provided. to the State: Attorney’s Office, and.

“computers, ‘hard drives, CPUs. [computer processing units], and anyother computer media”
removed. from Epstein’s home before the PBPD executed: its search warrant. in, October 2005. In
January: 2007, Sanchez: contacted, Villafatia. to:schedule a meeting, but Villafaha responded that:
she wanted to receive and review the documents before scheduling a meeting with Sanchez.

Jininediatély:after receiving Villafana’s response, Sanchez bypassed. Villafata and phoned.
Lourie, with.whom she:had worked.vhen she;was an.AUSA, to press for. a‘mecting. ‘Lourie agreed.
to ineet with Sanchez and. Lefcourt. Louitie explained to: Villafania that Sanchez was concerned.
that federal charges were “imminent,” wanted to meet with the USAO and. “make 'a pitch,” and
promised that. once: given.the opportunity to do so, if the USAO “wanted.to interview Epstein, that.
would be a possibility.” Villafana told Lourie ‘that Sanchez had not yet provided. the documents
she had promised, and Villafafia wanted “the documents not‘the pitch.” Lourie explained to OPR,
ners ‘that, it-was his practice to grant, mectings to defense counsel; he considered ‘it* ‘good for:

* to learn.the:defense theories ofa case and believed that “information.is: power.” Lourie further
oxtail that learning what infortnation the defense viewed as. ‘important could help the USAO
form its strategy: and.determine which. counts relating to which victims should be char ged. Lourie:
also. believed. that as a general matter, prosccutors should grant defense requests ‘to -‘inake aa;
presentation, because “ [pJart of [the] process is: for them to believe they are heard.” In addition:to
agrecing to a mécting, Lourie sent. Sanchez a narrowed. doctiment request, which responded ‘to
Sanchez’s complaint that the USAO’s earlier ‘request. was’ overbroad. but. which retained the:
demand tor the computer-related items:removed:trom.Epstein’s honie. The méeting-was.schedtled,
USAO by January'25, 2007.

Villafatia did not agree. with Lourie’s ‘decision:to meet*with Sanchez and Lefcourt. Indeed,
two days after Lourie agteed to the necting, Villafana alerted hitn that she had. spoken again with,
Sanchez.and learned that Epstein was not going to'provide.the:requested documents. As Villafana
told Loufie, “I just gct-to listen to, the pitch and. hear about how the girls are liars and. drugusers.”
She told. OPR.that.in her view, “it was way too carly to have a:meeting,” she.already knew what.
the:defense would say, and’she could not.sce‘how:a mecting, would benefit'the:federal investigation.
She explained. to Lourie the: basis for her objections tothe meeting, but. Lourie: “vehemently”
