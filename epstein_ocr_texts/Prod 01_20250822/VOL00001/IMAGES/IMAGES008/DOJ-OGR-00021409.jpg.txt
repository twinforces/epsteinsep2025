for federal:char ges against: me. ‘Idid.not get the opportunity to meet.

of confer with the: prosecuting attorneys about aty potential federal
deal that related to me ‘or'the crimes committed against me.

My understanding of ‘the agents’ explanation was that: the federal
investigation would continue. [also understood that:my. own case
would move forward ‘towards prosecution of Epstein.

Jn, addition, the case. agent spoke to: two other Victims and relayed, their reactions ‘to
Villafafia in.an.email:

Jane Doe #14 asked:ime why: [Epstein] was’ receiving such, a. lite [.s7é]
jail sentence and Jane Doe #13 has asked for our Victim Witness
coordinator to get, in touch with her so she. can reecive some much
needed [p]rofessional counseling. ‘Other. than that, their response
was. filled with cinotion and grateful to the Federal authorities for’
pursuing justice and-not giving up.*”*

expressed’ “a sense of-relie oe Counsel for “Jane Doe’ #13” told OPR that: while his ‘client recailied
mecting with | the EBLon.a number of occasions, she-did not:reeall receiving any information about
Epstein’ S guilty’ plea. In a letter to OPR,,“Jane: Doe-#14’s” attorney stated that although. her’client
recalled. speaking with an FBI agent, she’ was not told about the NPA. of inforined ‘that: Epstein.
would not face.federal. char ges.in exchange for his state court plea.

After meeting with these three victims, the: FBI case agent became.-conecerned that, if
Epstein, breached the NPA and ‘the case went-to federal trial, the defense could use the victims’
knowledge: of the NPA’s monetary damages‘ provision. as a basis to impeach the victims. 304 ‘The
case agent explained, to OPR that: she became * ‘uncomfortable” talking ‘to the victims about the:
damages provision, and ‘that.-as the: lead. investigator, “if we did end up going to trial... [if]
Mr. Epstein: breached this: that I-would ‘be on. the stand” testifying: that “I. told every one of these:
girls that they: could.sue Mr. Epstein. for" money, and I] was ‘not comfortable with that, /didn’tthink’
‘it was right.”

Similarly, the co-case agent told.OPR, “[T]hat’s why we went. back to Marie [Villafana]
and said, we’re not, comfortable now’ putting this out-there ..... because ..... it?s likely that [the case:
agent] and I_are going to have to take the stand if it, went to trial, and ihis could.be a. problem.”
