Th. contrast to a, constructive amendment, “[a] vatiance occurs when the, charging terms of
‘the indictment are:left-unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves, facts:materially different from
‘those alleged,in the:indictment.” Jd. at 20 (cleaned:up):
Court Exhibit#1'5 indicates thatthe jury is ‘considering a conviction on the:substantive
‘transportation offense charged:in Count Four based-on.Jane’s alleged’travel.to-and from.New
‘Mexico and. sexual-activity: that:purportedly took:place;while.she:was. there. That is not-what the
indictment alleges. Count Four. alleges that Ms. Maxwell “arranged for [Jane] to’be ‘transported
from d:lorida ‘to. New: York, New Yorkon multipleoccasions: with the intention:that [Jane] would
engage in.one or more sex acts with. Jefirey Epstein, in violution.of New. York.Penal Law, Section:
130:55." $2 Ind. 421. (emphasis added). As such, a conviction on Count Four, must be based on
evidence that Ms. Maxwell intended Jane to travel from.Florida to New. York, :and while in. New
‘York, engage in one.or.more'sex.acts‘that'Violated Section 130.55 of the New’ Y.ork:Penal Law.
The government has’ represented to the Court on.numerous occasions that Ms. Maxwell-cannot be:
convicted on any of the four’Mann Act counts, including, Count Four, without proof ofian intent to
‘violate New Y.ork law. That:excludes any conduct that may have occurred in‘New Mexico.
‘Indeed, in.the discussion. about:Court Exhibit# 15, the government stressed this point:

The only illegal ‘sexual activity identified in the entirety of the jury charge is a

statute.in New York, There cdnnot be any risk of confusion on, that Score. This

‘particular charge reminds’ the jury ‘of. that and. includes’ that language as ‘well. .Lhe

jury has nov bee charged about any laws in. New: Mexico: So. there cait't be any

risk-of confusion for exactly that reason.

Tr. 3.140: 0-1.6 (emphasis added).
