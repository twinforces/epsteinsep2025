Case 22-1426, Document 121-2, 12/02/2024, 3637741, Page14 of 26

Indictment. The District Court therefore correctly denied Maxwell’s

motion without an evidentiary hearing.
2. The Indictment. Is Timely

Maxwell argues that Counts Three and. Four of the Indictment
are untimely because they do not fall within the scope of offenses
involving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and
thereby do not fall within the extended statute of limitations provided
by § 3283."9 Separately, Maxwell contends that the Government cannot
apply ‘the 2003 amendment to § 3283 that extended the statute of
limitations.to those offenses that were committed before the enactment
into law of the provision. On both points, we disagree and hold that
the District Court correctly denied, Maxwell’s motions to. dismiss the
charges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to

dismiss .an indictment.and. the application of a statute,of limitations.”

First, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses
involving the sexual abuse of minors. The ‘District Court ‘properly
applied Weingarten v. United States.*! In Weingarten, we explained that

Congress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a. case-specific

W418 U.S.C. § 3283. provides: “Injo statute of: limitations: that would. otherwise. preclude
prosecution for an offense involving the sexual, or, physical. abuse; or kidnaping; of a child
under the age of 18 years shall preclude such'prosecution during the life of the: child, or. for

ten-yéai's after the.offensé, whichever is longer.”
