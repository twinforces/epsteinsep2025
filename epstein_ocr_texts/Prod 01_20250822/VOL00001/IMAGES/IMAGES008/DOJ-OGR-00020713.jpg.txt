02/24/2022 607 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's proposed
redactions revised in response to this Court's order. See Dkt. Nos. 605, 606. The Court
has reviewed the proposed redactions and concludes that they are in accordance with its
prior orders. See Dkt. Nos. 596, 605. The narrowly tailored redactions further the
important interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror

justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing and specific
factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly reported in the
press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming hearing. Dkt. No.
596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. 14 Cr. 6181 (EAW), Dkt. No. 312 (text
order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2017); id. Dkt. No. 329 at 38-39; Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior
Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464 U.S. 501, 511-12 (1984)). Accordingly, the parties are
ORDERED to docket the redacted briefs, accompanying exhibits, and their January 13
