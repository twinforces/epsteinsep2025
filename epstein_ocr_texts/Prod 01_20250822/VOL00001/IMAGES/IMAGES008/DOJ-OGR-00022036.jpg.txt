in uncovering admissible evidence, aiding ‘witness ‘preparation, cotroborating testimony, or
assisting impeachment or rebuttal.” United States v. Marshall, 132 F.3d ‘63, 68 (D.C. Cir. 1998)
(quoting United Statés v. Lloyd, 992 F.2d 348, 351 (DiC. Cir. 1993)) (internal. quotation marks
omitted). Courts. have interpreted. the scope: of Rule 16 (a)(1)(E)(i) broadly to ensure that
defendants such as Mr. Thomias have a fair opportutiity to. prepare for trial. United States v.
Poindexter, 727 F. Supp. 1470, 1473 (D.D.C. 1989) (“The:lariguage and. the spirit of the Rule are

defendant has attached an excerpt from a union committee meeting that: was: held. merely 3 days
before Jeffrey Bpstein died at MCC on August 10, 2019. The attached memorandum
