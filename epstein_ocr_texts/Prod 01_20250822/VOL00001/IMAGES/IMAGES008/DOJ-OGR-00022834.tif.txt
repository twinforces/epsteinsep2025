1 I'm not saying that Mr. Epstein did not do
2 those things. I'm not casting those -- I'm not going
3 to say -- I don't feel comfortable saying that today,
4 given what I now know to be true. So I am not here
5 to defend him.
6 But what I can say is that I did not
7 participate in that activity. And --
8 TODD BLANCHE: So let's divide this into
9 two areas. Maybe there's more, but we'll start with
10 two areas. One is there was testimony and there's
11 certainly been depositions and public statements,
12 that some of these young women had conversations with
13 you about their age.
14 So, for example, conversations about the
15 fact that they were in high school or conversations
16 about the fact that they wanted to go to college one
17 day, which would necessarily mean -- well, not
18 necessarily, but would be more likely to mean that
19 they were in high school when they talked to you
20 about that.
21 And so, were there times -- were there
22 women that you knew were underage? And I say that
23 because that's different than whether they were
24 sexually abused in any way by Mr. Epstein, just
25 merely their age and going to give him a massage?
