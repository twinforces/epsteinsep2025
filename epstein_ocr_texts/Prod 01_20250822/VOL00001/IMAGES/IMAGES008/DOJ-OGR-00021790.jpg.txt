Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell,
Docket No. 22-1426
Argument date: March 12, 2023

Dear Ms. Wolfe:

The Government. respectfully submits this letter, pursuant to Federal Rule of
Appellate Procedure 28(j), to inform this Court. of. United States v. Watkins, 940 F.3d
152 (2d Cir. 2019).

In Watkins, this Court explained that the portion of the Bail Reform Act, 18
UIS.C, § 3142(f)(1)(B), that required a detention. hearing for “any felony .. . that in-
volves a minor, victim . ..” permits a court. to conduct a’ “conduct: “specific: inquiry in.
sider the actual conduct ‘underlying the arrestee’s char zed offense.” 940 F.3d at 165,
167. Because that phrase “refers to a ‘minor victim,” it. “suggest[s] factual details
surrounding the charged conduct.” Id. at 166. The Court.also noted the absence of a
textual trigger for the categorical approach like “that has as an element.” Id. at 166
n.70. The Court further explained that its conclusion ‘was reinforced by legislative
history, namely, the inclusion of Section 3142(f)(1)(E) in.a statute intended to “afford,
‘minor victims. of crime the greatest degree of protection.” Id. at 166.

The Court: contrasted Section 31:42(f)(1)(E) with another portion of the Act that
contains the word. “involves” but requires use of the categorical approach, because
that text “refers, variously, to.a“crime,’ an ‘offense,’ and a “felony,” indicating an em-
phasis on the nature of the legal charge rather than “factual. details.” Id. (quoting 18
U.S.C. § 3182(f)(1) (discussing “a case that involves... a crime of violence . . .”); see
id. at, 162-65.
