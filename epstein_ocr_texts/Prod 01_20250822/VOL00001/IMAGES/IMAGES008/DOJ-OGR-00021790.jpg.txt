Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell,
Docket No. 22-1426
Argument date: March 12, 2023
Dear Ms. Wolfe:

The Government respectfully submits this letter, pursuant to Federal Rule of
Appellate Procedure 28(), to inform this Court of United States v. Watkins, 940 F.3d
152 (2d Cir. 2019).

In Watkins, this Court explained that the portion of the Bail Reform Act, 18
U.S.C. § 3142()(1)(E), that required a detention hearing for “any felony .. . that in-
volves a minor victim ... .” permits a court to conduct a “conduct-specific inquiry in
which the judicial officer may look beyond the elements of the charged offense to con-
sider the actual conduct underlying the arrestee’s charged offense.” 940 F.3d at 165,
167. Because that phrase “refers to a ‘minor victim,” it “suggest[s] factual details
surrounding the charged conduct.” Id. at 166. The Court also noted the absence of a
textual trigger for the categorical approach like “that has as an element.” Id. at 166
n.70. The Court further explained that its conclusion was reinforced by legislative
history, namely, the inclusion of Section 3142(f)(1)(E) in a statute intended to “afford
minor victims of crime the greatest degree of protection.” Id. at 166.

The Court contrasted Section 3142(f)(1)(E) with another portion of the Act that
contains the word “involves” but requires use of the categorical approach, because
that text “refers, variously, to a ‘crime, an ‘offense, and a ‘felony,” indicating an em-
phasis on the nature of the legal charge rather than “factual details.” Id. (quoting 18
U.S.C. § 3182(f)(1) (discussing “a case that involves ...a crime of violence . . .”); see
id. at 162-65.
