1 material to sentencing or not, I am prepared to address it.
2 So I believe the first -- what I see as your first
3 continued objection is to paragraph 22.
4 MR. EVERDELL: I'm just getting my submissions.
5 Yes, that's correct, your Honor.
6 THE COURT: I overrule the objection. I do credit
7 Juan Alessi's testimony that the defendant identified and
8 targeted Virginia after seeing her in the Mar-a-Lago parking
9 lot. The defendant also worked with Epstein to identify and
10 target Jane.
11 Paragraph three I see three objections to this
12 paragraph. Is that a continuing objection, Mr. Everdell?
L3 MR. EVERDELL: Paragraph three, your Honor?
14 THE COURT: 23. I apologize.
15 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor.
16 THE COURT: I overrule the objection. The first
17 objection is regarding the conclusion that Ms. Maxwell was the
18 author of the essay in the paragraph. I overrule the objection
19 because a reasonable inference supported by the trial evidence
20 is that the defendant authored the essay. Metadata indicated
a1 that the computer was registered to "GMax" and the document was
22 saved under the user name "Ghislaine."
23 The second objection is to the assertion that Epstein
24 transferred Ms. Maxwell approximately $23 million during the
25 conspiracy. I overrule that objection. Bank statements
