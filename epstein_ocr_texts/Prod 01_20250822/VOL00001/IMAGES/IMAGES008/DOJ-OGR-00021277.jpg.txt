charging Epstein ona federal conspiracy charge, and if he Tefused 1 to plead t to > that offense,

Belohlavek: and ‘informed. her:

Our :deadline is Monday evening for a signed agreement and
attaignment. in the federal system. At this time, things. don’t look.
promising anyway, but.E will keep’ you posted. In their jatest draft,

they changed. what ‘they agreed to plead to in the. state froin,
solicitation of minors for prostitution (a registrable offense) to
forcing adults into prostitution (a noi-régistrable, offense). We will
not budge on.this issue; so it is looking unlikely that‘we will. reachéa
mutually acceptable agreement. Ifthat:changes, [will let:you know.

Acosta sent:Lourie “[s Jome thoughts” about the USAO. version.of the proposed “hybrid”
federal plea agreement he had received from, Lourie the évenirig before, commenting’ that:“it:seems.
very: ‘straightfor ward” and “we are not changing our ‘standard charging language” for the

Please ‘try to incorporate: his suggestions, change the signature block. to your ‘name and. send _as
final to Jay.” Lourie also noted to Acosta and Villatana that he believed the defense would want.
to:go back to the initial. offer of a state plea with a:non-prosecution agreement. When Villafatia

him-on, September: I’7, 2007, would, control.

20 The USAO had ‘standard ‘federal plea agreement language, frony which this: “hybrid” plea agreement had.

substantially diverged:
Il The ‘standard. procedure ‘was ‘for documents; such as ‘plea ‘agreements ‘to’ be: signed: by an AUSA under the:
namé ofthe. U:S. Attorticy.. In his OPR interview, Acosta. further explained that warited to give “the: trial. téam”.an
opportunity to-voice any objections because. “if it’s, something, they don*t-feel comfortable: with we .; shouldn’*t:go.
forwatdwith it.”
