Government also produced 3500 material for every individual.interviewed during the investigation.
in. December, nearly four months in advance of trial.

“Whether or not: to adjourn a trial. date is, traditionally within ‘the discretion of the trial
judge.” United States v. SCopo, 861 F.2d 339, 344 (2d Cir. 1988) (internal quotations omitted).
While ‘there “is:no. mechanical test with respect to requests for a:continuance or adjournment,”
United: Mates v, Al F awads, 116 F, Supp: 3d 194, 210 (S.D.N. Y. 2015), the Second Circuit has
delay: i 1S “of a short (or at Teast. fixed duration); (2) ihe sought: -after evidence is specified with
‘particularity; (3) the proposed evidence is. critical to the défense; and (4) the defendant has not
been.dilatory. Jd. at 2:11. (summarizing considerations found in United States v. White, 324 F.3d
814, 814-16 (2d. Cir. 1963)).

None of the circumstances, identified in A/ /awauz necessitate the lengthy ‘adjournment.
requested, by the defendants. The Government’s casé-in-chief turns on a bricf, fourtéen-hour
window for'which the eviderice is limited and now available to the defendants. Moreover, even as
expanded. to include. all of the additional material. produced. as described. above, the: discovery in.
the instant: case is neither unusually yoluminous nor complex, and the defendants provide no
specific reasons why the review of the materials requires. a six-month adjournment.

Nor doés the necd to file pre-trial motions and interview witnesses support such. an
adjournment. ‘—Thomas’s counsel has indicated that he: intends to file a:motion to dismiss the:
indictment, while Nocl*s counsel states that he has not been. able:to determine what motions to file:
pending his review of the discovery. Noel’s counsel, however, identifies:no reason to believe-such.
a. review Is, likely to result: in, the identification..of any potential pre-trial, motions: ‘as counsel, is
aware; the Government did not. obtain any search warrants as part of its investigation, nor did the:
defendants. make. ‘post-arrest, statements that the Government ‘would. seck to introduce into
evidence. As such, there is no evidence for the defendants to scck to suppress. As for the motion.
to dismiss, ‘which does not depend.on a.review of the discovery, counsel for Thomas identifics no
reason why: ‘such.a, motion could not be made in’ short order.

Finally, with. respcet ‘to the need ‘to interview ‘witnesses, as noted, above, the Government’
has -already: produced all. of the witness ‘statements in its possession, almost all of them. on.
December 31,:201 9, nearly four months‘before trial. As'the Court.is well-aware, such, productions
of witness statements are typically made only weeks before trial is scheduled.to begin. As. such,
the Government’s carly production.of those matcrials=giving the: defendants months. of additional
tinic. to review’ thosé statements and take any. potential investigation steps based, upon. them—
cannot. possibly merit'a lengthy pos(ponement of the trial date.
