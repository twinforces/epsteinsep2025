12/07/2020 | 91 | LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from Bobbi C.
Sternheim dated 12/07/2020 re: Response to MDC Report to Court re: conditions
(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 12/07/2020)

12/08/2020 92 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 4, 2020, the Court received a letter
from MDC legal counsel responding to the concerns that the Defendant raised in her
November 24, 2020 letter. See Dkt. Nos. 75, 88; see also Dkt. No. 78. The Defendant
responded to the MDC legal counsel's letter on December 7, 2020, reiterating her
request that the Court summon Warden Heriberto Tellez to personally respond to
questions from the Court regarding the Defendant's conditions of confinement. See
Dkt. No. 91. Having carefully reviewed the parties' submissions, along with the MDC
legal counsel's December 4, 2020 letter, the Court DENIES the Defendant's request to
summon the Warden to personally appear and respond to questions. This resolves Dkt.
No. 75. Notwithstanding this, as originally provided in Dkt. No. 49, the Government
shall continue to submit written status updates detailing any material changes to the
conditions of Ms. Maxwell's confinement, with particular emphasis on her access to
legal materials, including legal mail and email, and her ability to communicate with
defense counsel. The updates shall also include information on the frequency of
searches of the Defendant. The Court hereby ORDERS the Government to submit
these written updates every 60 days. Furthermore, the Government shall take all
necessary steps to ensure that the Defendant continues to receive adequate access to
her legal materials and her ability to communicate with defense counsel. (Signed by
Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/8/2020) (ap) (Entered: 12/08/2020)

12/14/2020 95 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine
Maxwell filed her renewed application for bail under seal with proposed redactions, in
accordance with this Court's December 7, 2020 Order, see Dkt. No. 89. The
Government did not file any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions. After
due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions. The
Court's decision to adopt those redactions is guided by the threeâ€”part test articulated
by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.
2006). Under this test, the Court must: (1) determine whether the documents in
question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law
presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations
