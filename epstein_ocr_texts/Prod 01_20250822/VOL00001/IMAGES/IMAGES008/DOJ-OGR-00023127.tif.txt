that Epstein pay the victims’ legal fees incurred from contested litigation would “trigger profound
ethical problems,” in that the attorney representative would have an incentive to reject settlement
offers in order to incur more fees. In addition, Lefkowitz rejected Villafafia’s view that Epstein
had waived the right to challenge § 2255 liability as to victims who did not want to settle their
claims, and contended that any such victims “will have to prove, among other things, that they are
victims under the enumerated statutes.” Finally, Lefkowitz again argued that the USAO should
not discuss the settlement process with the victims who were to be identified as eligible for
settlement under § 2255:
Ms. Villafafia proposes that either she or federal agents will speak
with the [victims] regarding the settlement process. We do not think
it is the government’s place to be co-counsel to the [victims], nor
should the FBI be their personal investigators. Neither federal
agents nor anyone from your Office should contact the [victims] to
inform them of the resolution of the case, including appointment of
the attorney representative and the settlement process. Not only
would that violate the confidentiality of the Agreement, but
Mr. Epstein also will have no control over what is communicated to
the [victims] at this most critical stage. We believe it is essential
that we participate in crafting a mutually acceptable communication
to the [victims]. We further believe that communications between
your Office or your case agents and the [victims] might well violate
Rule 6(e)(2)(B) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The
powers of the federal grand jury should not, even in appearance, be
utilized to advance the interests of a party to a civil lawsuit.!3”
Lefkowitz concluded, “I look forward to resolving these open issues with you during our 4:30 call
today.” 8
Villafafia was at that time on sick leave, and Sloman and Acosta exchanged emails about
crafting an addendum to the NPA to address the method of appointing an attorney representative
and to articulate the representative’s duties. The next day, October 11, 2007, Sloman exchanged
emails with Lefkowitz about the text of a proposed addendum.
B. October 12, 2007: Acosta and Defense Attorney Lefkowitz Meet for Breakfast
On the morning after his scheduled afternoon phone call with Lefkowitz, Acosta exchanged
emails with Lefkowitz, arranging to meet for breakfast the following day, on October 12, 2007, at
a Marriott hotel in West Palm Beach. Contemporaneous records show that Acosta was previously
scheduled to be in West Palm Beach for a press event on October 11 and to speak at the Palm
Beach County Bench Bar conference the following midday, and that he stayed overnight at the
Marriott.
By Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2)(B) relates to secrecy of federal grand jury matters.
18 OPR did not locate any emails indicating what happened on the call.
