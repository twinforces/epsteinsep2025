04/16/2021 205 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On March 15, 2021, the Defendant filed under seal her
reply briefs to the Government memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pre-
trial motions. She filed the briefs, along with the corresponding exhibits, temporarily
under seal in order to permit the Government and the Court to review certain proposed
redactions. Of the twelve reply briefs, Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 did not
contain any redaction or sealing requests. Reply Briefs 1, 3, 5, 6, and 10 contain limited
proposed redactions. Reply Briefs 3, 6, and 10 also contain exhibits that the Defendant
proposes be filed under seal. As set forth in the Defendant's cover letter, the premise of
the proposed redactions is that the materials were produced in discovery and subject to
the protective order that has been entered in this case. The mere existence of a
confidentiality agreement or a protective order covering judicial documents is insufficient
to overcome the presumption of access. See Aioi Nissay Dowa Ins. Co. v. Prosight
Specialty Mgmt. Co., Inc., 12-cv-3274 (JPO), 2012 WL 3583176, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Aug.
21, 2012). And the Court did not receive specific requests or justifications to redact or
seal any of the materials. The Defendant is ORDERED to docket Reply Briefs 2, 4, 7, 8,
9, 11, and 12 on ECF today, as she did not propose any redactions to these and the
Government has not voiced any opposition to these being filed without redactions. If
either side is seeking these or any other redactions to the remaining reply briefs, they
must file a letter indicating the redactions they request and providing specific
justifications for the sealing requests or redactions, in line with the principles set forth in
Lugosch. By April 20, 2021, the parties shall confer and submit a letter informing the
Court whether any redactions are being sought. If no redactions are being sought, the
Defendant is ORDERED to docket the remaining reply briefs on ECF by April 20, 2021.

04/16/2021 207 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2020, a grand jury returned a six-
count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier Jeffrey
Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around 1994 to 1997. The Government filed
a first (S1) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which contained only small,
ministerial corrections. The S1 superseding indictment included two counts of enticement
