Government as to the extent of those efforts. So that appropriate logistical arrangements
can be made, the Government shall inform the Court by email within 24 hours in advance
of the proceeding if any alleged victim wishes to be heard on the question of detention
pending trial. Finally, the time between the Defendant's arrest and July 6, 2020 is
excluded under the Speedy Trial Act due to the delay involved in transferring the
Defendant from another district. See 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(1)(F). And the Court further
excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act from today through July 14, 2020. Due to the
logistical issues involved in conducting a remote proceeding, the Court finds "that the
ends of justice served by [this exclusion] outweigh the best interest of the public and the
defendant in a speedy trial." 18 U.S.C. ยง 3161(h)(7)(A). The exclusion is also supported.
by the need for the parties to discuss a potential protective order, which will facilitate the
timely production of discovery in a manner protective of the rights of third parties. See
Dkt. No. 5. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/7/2020)Gbo)
