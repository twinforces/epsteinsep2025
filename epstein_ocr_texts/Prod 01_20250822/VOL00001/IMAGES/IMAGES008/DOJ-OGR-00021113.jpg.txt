Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page66 of 113

U.S. v. Diehl, 775 F.3d 714 (Sth Cir. 2015) (Graves, J.); U.S. v. Coutentos, 651
F.3d 809 (8th Cir. 2011). In Coutentos, a jury found the defendant guilty on two
counts: sexual exploitation or attempted sexual exploitation of a minor to produce
child pornography (18 U.S.C. § 2251(a) and (d)) and possession or attempted
possession of child pornography (18 U.S.C. § 2252A(a)(5)(B) and (b)(2)). Both
counts were untimely unless § 3283 applied. As the Court’s recitation of the facts
made clear, the production and possession counts were based on the same
underlying conduct: the defendant’s abuse of his granddaughters to create child
pormography. See Coutentos, 651 F.3d at 813-14. Thus, in a factual sense, the
defendant’s possession clearly involved the sexual abuse of a child. Nevertheless,
the Eighth Circuit, while affirming the production conviction, vacated the
possession conviction on the ground that it was not an “offense involving the
sexual...abuse of a child” within the precise meaning of § 3283. The Court
considered the possession statute in the abstract, asked whether it necessarily
required proof of involvement in the sexual abuse of a child, and concluded that it
does not:

Does someone who merely possesses child pornography sexually

abuse the child portrayed in the images? No more than the offense of

possessing methamphetamine involves the act of producing it, does

the offense of child pornography involve the sexual abuse of a child.

That a producer of child pornography will possess it at the time of the

abuse is insufficient to change our view that the offense of possessing

child pornography itself does not involve an act against a child, 1.e.,
