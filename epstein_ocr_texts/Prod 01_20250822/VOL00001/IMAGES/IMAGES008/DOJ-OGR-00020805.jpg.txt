IN RE:
INVESTIGATION OF
JEFFREY EPSTEIN
ADDENDUM TO THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT.
IT APPEARING that the parties seek to clarify certain provisions of page 4, paragraph 7
of the Non-Prosecution Agreement (hereinafter “paragraph 7”), that agreement is modified as
follows:
7A. The United States has the right to assign to an independent third-party the responsibility
for consulting with and, subject to the good faith approval of Epstein's counsel, selecting
the attorney representative for the individuals identified under the Agreement. If the
United States elects to assign this responsibility to an independent third-party, both the
United States and Epstein retain the right to make good faith objections to the attorney
representative suggested by the independent third-party prior to the final designation of
the attorney representative.
7B. The parties will jointly prepare a short written submission to the independent third-party
regarding the role of the attorney representative and regarding Epstein’s Agreement to
pay such attorney representative his or her regular customary hourly rate for representing
such victims subject to the provisions of paragraph C, infra,
7C. Pursuant to additional paragraph 7A, Epstein has agreed to pay the fees of the attorney
representative selected by the independent third party. This provision, however, shall not
obligate Epstein to pay the fees and costs of contested litigation filed against him. Thus,
if after consideration of potential settlements, an attomey representative elects to file a
contested lawsuit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. s 2255 or elects to pursue any other contested
remedy, the paragraph 7 obligation of the Agreement to pay the costs of the attorney
representative, as opposed to any statutory or other obligations to pay reasonable
attorneys fees and costs such as those contained in s 2255 to bear the costs of the attorney
representative, shall cease.
