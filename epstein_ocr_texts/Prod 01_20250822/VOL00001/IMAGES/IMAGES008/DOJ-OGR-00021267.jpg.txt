having directly with Alex. Acosta, and Alex. Acosta agreed to 18
‘months..

Villafana further explained:to OPR:

‘Regarding, going from 24 months to 20 months, .recall.a discussion.
that-24 inonths of:federal time was teally20 months  after‘gain tite,
so Epstein:should be allowed to plead to 20 months” in. the state.
Epstcin’s counsel represented. that. he wouldn’t get: gain, time like
that-in the: [s]tate, and. somcone above me agreed. ‘Later, of course,
Alex’to-agree that'Epstein should-be allowed.to carn gain time:in the
[s]tate, so the 20 months:in.the state‘became at least 1.7 months.

Regarding, going from 20 months® to 18 months,.. ... this:came. from.
a negotiation between Epstein’s counsel and Andy or Alex, where
the federal statutory max could only be 24 or 18, so 18 was:agreed.
to. I also recall that, after Epstein’s counsel. decided. that they
wanted to proceed.with an NPA and only a state guilty plea, I asked.
Alex why we didn’t return to 20 months becatise;the reason whywe
went to 8 months was because that was the only way to:end up with
a federal:statutory. maximum."! a

However, a subsequent account of the ‘history..of negotiations with Epstcin’s attorneys,
drafted by Villafana for Acosta several weeks afterthe September 12, 2007 meeting with the State
Attorney’s Office, stated that “a significant.compromise™:reached at the meeting “was a:reduction.
ih the amountof jail’time — from [the originally: proposed] twenty-four months down, to eighteen.
months, which would be served at the Palm Beach County Jail rather than/a‘state prison facility.”
Acosta.also noted to‘OPR that Villafana was engaged.in.a “totigh negotiation,” and he was willing:
to allow her the discretion to reduce the amount of incarceration, time without hint “second-
guessing” her. Acosta acknowledged that he “clearly;approved it:at some point.”

‘Based. on this record,. ORR. could ‘not definitively determine when, how, or by: whom the.
decision was inade'to reduce the required term of imprisonment from 24 months’to 1:8 :months. It
‘is possible that the reduction was connected to Epstein’s effort.to. achievesa result.that would:allow
hii to serve his time, in a county facility; but it-imay also have-resulted ‘from the parties* attempts,
to reach: agreement ‘on. federal. charges that would-not-result.in.a. sentence: of incarceration greater
than what had been disetissed with respect to: state charges. In, the end, the evidence shows that!
Acosta-approved of a reduced. term of incarceration from 24 months to 18 months, and the USAO
understood at.the-time that the state gain time requirement would further-reduce the actual amount:
of time Epstein, would spend incarcerated.

do By “federal statutory*maximum,” Villafafa referred to ‘2-month.and.6-month misdemeanors.
