which. Villafatia:and Lourie believed :that the state had intentionally.failed to aggressively pursue’
a broade¢ State: indictinent.

‘One example illustrates this communication.gap. In,a. September 20,.2007 email to Lourie:
asking him to read the: latest version.of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement. (calling . for’
Epstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta ‘noted, “Idon’t typically. sign plea.
agreements.. We should-only go forward if the trial team, supports and. Signs this agreement: I.
didn’t even. sign.the public: corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not'be the first:”
(Emphasis' added.) In his email to Villafana, Lourie attached Acosta’s' cimail, and. instructed
Villafafia to * ‘change’ the: signature block to your name’ and ‘send. as final. to Jay [Lefkowitz].”
(Emphasis, added.) ‘Villafana raised rio objection to signing the, agrecient. Acosta’ told OPR that:
he wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to‘ ‘speak up and. let him.know” if they. did not feel.
comfortable with the agreement. Villafana, however, told OPR that she did not: understand ‘that:
she was being given an opportunity to. object to the: agreement; rather, she believed. Acosta wanted.
hef to:sign, it because he was taking an “arm’s length” approach and. signaling this “was ‘not his,
deal.” The: fact'that the top decision maker believed-he was. giving the: line. AUSA. an.opportunity
to reflect and stop the process if she ‘believed. the: deal was inappropriate, but the line. AUSA.
believed she was being ordered to sign the agreenient.because her boss wanted to distance himself,
from.the decision, reflects a serious communication-gap.

As another example, at one point, Villafana, frustrated. and concerned about.the decisions
being made concerning a possible:resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in-a.sternly worded,
rebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although. Menchel. told OPR that. he was not. prohibiting.
Villafana from speaking to Acosta, Villafana interpreted Menchel’s email to iniean that she could.
not seck.'a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made: his decision about a state
resolution.and the term of incarceration without:any direct.input.from Villafana. Acosta told OPR.
that he was unaware that Villafana had ‘sought ‘a‘mecting with hiny and he would have met. with,
her. if she had asked. him directly. OPR..did not find any written evidence of a meeting involving,
both, Acosta—the final decision maker—and. Villafana—the person, most knowledgeable about.the
facts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve:the case through state chargesyorto
offer'the two-year tern, and. Villafana said ‘she did hot have.any input into the decision: Although,
a U.S. Attorney is certainly not required to have: such direct input, and it.may be that Menchel.
presented what he believed. to be Villafana’s v ‘iews;, OPR. fotifid:no-evidence that Acosta was:awate
of Villafaiia’s strongviews about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”°°

Two logistical ‘problems hindered. effective communication. First, the. senior managers
‘involved. in the case—Acosta, ‘Sloman, and Menchel—had. offices located.:in Miami, ‘while: the:
offices ‘of the individuals inost familiar with facets of the case—Villafana and, to a lesser extent,
Lourie—were' located in West Palm:Beach. Consequently, Villafatia’s discussions with her senior

286 In her: 2017 Declaration: inthe CVRA, ‘litization: Villafaiia: stated that. given the ‘challenges ‘of obtaining
victims* cooperation-with.a-federal‘prosccution, “I believed.and.still belicve:that-a negotiated resolution of the matter
was in. the best interests: of the [USAO] and ‘the wietimys: asa Whole. The [USAO] ‘had. also weachéd that sanve
conclusion.” ‘Several subjects pointed ;to,this: statement as indicating that: Villafafia.in fact:supported the NPA. In.her
OPR interview, however, Villafaiia drew. a-distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that:
led to:what in, her-view was a.reasonable,outcome, which she; would haye:supported, and “this negotiated resolution” —
thatis, the NPA—which she:did not Support.
