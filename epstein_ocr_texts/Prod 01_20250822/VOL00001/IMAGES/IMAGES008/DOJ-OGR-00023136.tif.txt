the defense “[f]irst and foremost” reaffirmed the NPA and that Epstein “has no intention of
unwinding the agreement.”

On December 7, 2007—the deadline set by Acosta in his December 4, 2007 letter to Starr—
the defense transmitted to the USAO a one-sentence “Affirmation” of the NPA and its addendum,
signed by Epstein. !™4

F. Despite Affirming the NPA, Defense Counsel Intensify Their Challenges to It

and Accuse Villafaiia of Improper Conduct

1. December 7 and 11, 2007: Starr and Lefkowitz Send to Acosta Letters
and “Ethics Opinions” Complaining about the Federal Investigation
and Villafana

On the same day that the defense team sent Epstein’s “Affirmation” to the USAO, Starr
and Lefkowitz sent to Acosta two “independent ethics opinions’”—one authored by prominent
criminal defense attorney and former U.S. Attorney Joe Whitley, which assessed purported
improprieties in the federal investigation of Epstein, and the other, by a prominent retired federal
judge and former U.S. Attorney, arguing against the NPA’s use of the civil damages recovery
provision under 18 U.S.C. § 2255 “as a proxy for traditional criminal restitution.”

Days later, on December 11, 2007, Starr sent a letter to Acosta transmitting two lengthy
submissions authored by Lefkowitz presenting substantive challenges to the NPA and to the
“background and conduct of the investigation.” These submissions repeated arguments previously
raised by the defense but also asserted new issues. In one submission, 20 pages long, Lefkowitz
addressed the “improper involvement” of federal authorities in the investigation and criticized
Villafafia for a number of alleged improprieties, including having engaged in “unprecedented
federal overreaching” by seeking to prosecute Epstein federally, “insist[ing]” that the State
Attorney’s Office “charge Mr. Epstein with violations of law and recommend a sentence that are
significantly harsher than what the State deemed appropriate,” and requiring that Epstein plead
guilty to a registrable offense, a “harsh” condition that was “unwarranted.”!*

Lefkowitz also argued that the federal investigation relied upon a state investigation that
was “tainted” by the lead PBPD Detective’s misrepresentation of key facts in affidavits and
interview summaries, leading the USAO to make its charging decision based on flawed
information that “compromised the federal investigation.” Finally, Lefkowitz criticized federal
involvement in the state plea process as a violation of “the tenets of the Petite Policy.” Ina second,
13-page submission, Lefkowitz reiterated Epstein’s complaints about the § 2255 component of the
NPA, arguing, among other things, that federal prosecutors “should not be in the business of
helping alleged victims of state crimes secure civil financial settlements.”

14 The Affirmation read: “I, Jeffrey E. Epstein do hereby re-affirm the Non-Prosecution Agreement and
Addendum to same dated October 30, 2007.”
15 Villafafia sent Lefkowitz a five-page letter responding to the accusations made against her personally.
