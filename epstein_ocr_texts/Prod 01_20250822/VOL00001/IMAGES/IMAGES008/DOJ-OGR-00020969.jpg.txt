based on the purported. similarities. betweer his:personal history and, the issues at trial. Because,
‘these:arguments overlap, the Court:addresses implied and,inferred. bias together.?

“Implied bias” is “a,concept that is reserved. for ‘extreme situations,’ warranting a
conclusive presumption. of bias as a matter of law:” McCoy, 995 F.3d at 48.(internal quotations
omitted) (quoting Greer; 285 F.3d at: 172). Such’bias is “attributed to'a:prospective juror
regardless of actual:partiality”* because the law presumes that “‘an.average person in:the position
ofthe juror in controversy would. be prejudiced.” Jorres, 128 F.3d at 45 (citing United States v.
Wood, 299. U.S..123, 133 (1936)); see also, Haynes, 398 F.2d at.984. The category applies ‘to
“certain‘highly ‘limited situations where a juror. discloses a fact-that creates such a high risk of
‘partiality that the law: requires ‘the:judge'to excuse the juror for cause.” Torres, 128 F.3d at 41.
‘Namely, “jurors who are-related to the parties: or who were victims” or otherwise involved in the
alleged crime itself are impliedly biased. ./d. at 45; see also Greer, 285 F.3d.at 172.

‘On. the other. hand,. a finding of inferred bias is a determination:within the trial court’s
discretion. Greer, 285, F.3d.at 171: see also. McCoy, 995 F.3d at'49. “Bias may‘be ‘inferred:when
a.juror discloses ia-fact that bespeaks:a-risk:of partiality sufficiently significant to warrant
granting the trial judge discretion to excuse the:juror for. cause, but not so great'as to make
mandatory a presumption-of: bias.” Greer, 285 F.3d at 17.1. (quoting; /orres, 128 F.3d at 47)).
The inquiry.is whether the juror’s:responses at voir dire “permit ananference that the juror in
question would-not be able:to decide the:matter objectively.” Lorres, 128 F.3dat 47. Tftsuch
facts are clicited, “then, just as'in-the situation. of implicd-bias, the:juror’s statements as to‘his or.

cher ability to’be impartial become irrelevant.” Jd. Howewer, “a judge‘may—particularly when
