contemplates a broader restriction.”" And while Maxwell contends
that we'cannot apply: Annabi to ana greement.negotiated. and executed

Annabi, we conclude that the NPA did not: bar Maxwell's

by USAO-SDNY. There is nothing. in the NPA that-affirmatively shows

outside of this Circuit, we have previously done just:that.!" Applying

the NPA ‘isnot silent, the agreement's scope is expressly limited to the
Southern District of Florida. The NPA makes clear that if Epstein

fulfilled his obligations, he would no longerface charges in that district:

After timely fulfilling all the terms and conditions of the
Agreement, no prosecution for the offenses set out on. pages 1

United States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670,672 (2d Cir. 1985). We recognize that circtits have

been split on this issue for decades. See United States v. Harvey, 791 F.2d 294, 303 (4th Cir.

v. Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x:268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004) (summary order) (same, to agreement.entered
into: in the District of New -Mexico).. Nor does Annabi, as Maxwell contends, apply only

agreement. In. Annabi, this Court rejected an.interpretation of a. prior plea agreement that
réstéd_on the, Double Jeopardy: Clause, reasoning that evén.if the Doublé Jeopardy Clause
applied, ‘the ‘subsequent ‘charges were “sufficiently distinct” and. therefore fell outside the
Clause’s protections. Annabi, 77], F.2d at672.,This:Court did not, however, conclude'that-the
rule of construction ‘it announced depended. ‘on. the similarities between earlier and

subsequent charges:
