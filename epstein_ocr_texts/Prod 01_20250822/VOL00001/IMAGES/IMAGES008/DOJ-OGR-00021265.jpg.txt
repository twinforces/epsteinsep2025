Villafatatold OPR.that during the mecting, the group discussed the draft-NPA, but she did
not think they gave a copy to.Krischer and, Belohlavek: Neither Krischer nor Belohlavek expressed
concern. about ‘proceeding as the USAO was proposing. According to Villafaiia, Belohlavek:
explaitied. that a plea to the three state. counts identified in'the draft NPA would affect the state’s
sentencing guidelines, and that it would be better for. the: guidelines calculation if Epstein. pled.
@uilty to jst one of the thice Coutts, Villafana. recalled that When Belohlavek’ confirmed that!
Epstein. would be:required to register’as a sexual offender if he-pled.to any one of the three:charges,
Lourie, speaking for ‘the USAO, agreed to allow Epstein to enter his plea to just one state charge:
in addition to the pending state indictment, ‘and the defense attorneys selected the: charge of,
procurement, of minors to. engage ‘in, prostitution.!°° ‘Lourie, however, disputed, Villafatia’s,
recollection that: he ‘nvadé the final, decision,, stating ‘that-it was “illogical” to conclude: that, he had
the:authority to change the terms of:agreement-unilaterally.1"”

During the: mecting, defense counsel. raised concerns ‘about Epstein serving time ‘in state:
prison: ‘Villafana also: told OPR that Lourie, the other sipervisor, and she, made. clear during the
mecting that they expected-Epstein to be incarcerated.24 hours a day, ‘seven days a week, during,
the: ontirety of his sentence, and, they did. not: “Particular ly care’ "whether at was in a, State: or ‘local
facility, rather than. state prison, his sentence on ‘each char ‘ge could, ben no more e than 12 months, : so
that, for example, consecutive terms of 12 months and. 6 months—totaling: 18 imonths—could’ ‘be
served.in.the: county jail. Villafafia‘told OPR:

Our thing, was:incarceration.24-hours:a day. So during this mecting,
Treimeinber [the défense] talking about. .. a one year count followed,
by asix-month-count..... . that. [Epsiein] could serve ‘them back ‘to
back:but at the county jail, rather than having to go‘to a state:facility.
Butthen said, “Butif you do that, it’s still going to haye'to be'round.
the clock incarceration.” And Barry..Krischer said yes. And [he]
said ‘that. to avoid [Epstein being extorted while incarcerated], he
would be kept in solitary confinement.

Villafana did.:not recall whether she and. Lourie ‘agreed to: an. 18-month sentence during, that.
meeting, but she told OPR that in her view, allowing Epstein.to serve his sentence if, the county’
jail was not a “concession” because: he would be incarcerated regardless.,

Neither Lourie nor the other USAO supervisor present could:recall any substantive details
of the. September..12,:2007 meeting, and Krischer and Belohlavek'told OPR they did.not remember:
the.meeting at all. Krischer‘did; however, recall that he was “notoffended at.all” when-he learned
of the: ‘proposed federal resolution, requiring Epstein: to plead to both the pending state indictment
and an additional charge requiring sexual offender: registration, explaining to‘OPR that: Epstein

“was going, to: plead. guilty to. my indictment, we were: going to add.an. additional. charge, he was

“196 Later, ‘the: defense ‘would claim ‘that ‘they had ‘mistakenly understood. that: the selected. charge would not

‘involve sexual offender-registration.
10a Asnoted.below,a contemporancous email indicates:that:shortly.after the meeting, Louric and'Villafafia.spoke.
with Acosta and-Sloman, who: concurted withthe agreement.
