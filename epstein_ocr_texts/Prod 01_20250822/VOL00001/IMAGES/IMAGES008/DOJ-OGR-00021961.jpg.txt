1 You have the right to remain silent. You are not

2 required to make any statements. Even if you have already made
3 statements to the authorities, you need not make any further

4 statements. Any statements that you do make can be used

a against you.

6 You have the right to be released, either

7 conditionally or unconditionally, pending trial unless I find

8 that there are no conditions that would reasonably assure your
9 presence in court or the safety of the community.

10 You have the right to be represented by an attorney

11 during all court proceedings, including this one and during all
12 questioning by the authorities.

13 If you cannot afford an attorney, I will appoint one
14 to represent you. I understand that each of you has retained
15 private counsel. If at any point in time you run out of money
16 and you are unable to afford counsel, you can petition the

17 Court to appoint counsel at the government's expense and at no
18 cost to you.

19 You both have been charged in a six-count indictment,
20 and I will just state that I understand that Judge Torres has
21 referred this not just for presentment but also for
22 arraignment.
23 MR. ROOS: That's correct, your Honor.
24 THE COURT: The defendants have both been charged in a
25 six-count indictment.
