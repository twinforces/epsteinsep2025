not constitute “extraneous” information. Warger v.
Shauers, 574 U.S. 40, 51-52 (2014) (rejecting party’s
attempt to use the “extraneous” information exception
to establish that a juror should have been excluded un-
der McDonough based on his personal experiences).
POINT IV
The District Court’s Response to a Jury Note Did
Not Constructively Amend the Indictment

At all times the Government consistently argued
that Maxwell enticed and transported Jane to New
York with the intent that Jane engage in illegal sexual
activity, and that Maxwell conspired to do so regarding
Jane and the other victims. That is the issue Judge
Nathan instructed the jury to resolve, and that is the
criminal conduct charged in Counts Three and Four of
the Indictment. Accordingly, no constructive amend-
ment or variance occurred.
A. Relevant Facts

Counts Three and Four charged Maxwell with ar-
ranging for Jane’s transportation to New York with
the intent that Jane would engage in sex acts with Ep-
stein, in violation of New York state law, and with a
conspiracy to transport minors to New York for the
same purpose. (A.127-30). At trial, the Government
marshalled evidence that Maxwell transported Jane to
New York, and aided and abetted Epstein in doing so,
with the intent that Jane engage in sexual activity
there. That evidence included detailed testimony from
Jane about Epstein’s New York residence (Tr.316-19)
