Court has. considered both statutory ‘text ‘and legisla-
tive history. In re Enter. Mort. Acceptance Co. See.
Litig. (“Enterprise”); 891 F.3d 401, 406-08 (2d Cir.
2004). Here, the text and.history of Section.3283 estab-
lish that Congress intended to extend the time to bring
charges of.child sexual abuse in cases where the limi-
tations period had not yet expired.

‘Prior to 2003, any'child, sex abuse offense could be
prosecuted until the victim reached the age of 25 years,
at which, point the statute of limitations then, in effect
would bay prosecution. In the 2003 amendment, which.
was titled, “No Statute of Limitations for Child Abduc-
tion and Sex Crimes,” Pub. L. No. 1108-21, § 202,117
Stat. 660, Congress ‘explicitly provided that “[n]o stat-
ute of limitations that would otherwise precludé pros-
ecution for [such an offense] shall preclude such pros-
ecution. during the life of the child.” 18 U.S.C. § 3283.
(2003). The amendment.draws no distinction between
pre-enactment and ‘post-enactmént: conduct. Instead,
as Judge Nathan explained, by'stating that “no statute
of limitations that would otherwise preclude prosecu-
tion of these offenses will apply,” the amendment’s

“plain language unambiguously requires that it apply
to prosecutions for offenses committed before the date
of enactment.” (A.151). Thus, the breadth of the text:
shows that Congress ‘intended “to extend ‘the .... stat-
ute of limitations,” evén for pre-enactment conduct.
United States v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d. 682, 684 (8th Cir.
2005) (reaching same conclusion as to § 3283's prede-
cessor based. on similar “title and ... wording” of stat:
ute); cf. Enterpri ise, 391 F.3d at. 407 (describing, provi-
sion that “no limitation shall terminate the period
within. which. suit .may be filed” as example of statute
