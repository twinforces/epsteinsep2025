Tthink Jay: [Lefkowitz] «will try to:talk you out of a registrable
offense. Regardless of the merits of his.arguinent, in.order to get us
down. in time they. made..us:an offer that included. pleading to an.
offense against a minor (encouraging a minor into prostitution) and.
touted that we should. be: happy because: it was:registrable. For that.
reason. alone, I don’t think we should. consider allowing them to
‘come down. from their ‘own. offer, either on. this issue.or on time of
incarceration.

Letkowitz attempted to.reach Acosta that.night, but.Acosta directed Villafafia.to return the.
call; and told Lourie ‘that he did not-want to open “a backchannel” with defense. counsel. Lourie
instructed Villafana, “U.can.tell [JJay that [A]lex will-not agree’ to a:nonregistration.offense.”

On. the morning of Friday, September 211, 2007,, Villafana emailed Acosta informing him.
that “it: looks like-we will be [filing charges against] Mr. Epstein ‘on. Tuesday;” reporting that the
charging‘package' was being reviewed by’ the West.Palm Beach manager, and-asking if anyone in.
the: Miami office: needed ‘to review it. Villafaiia also alerted Lourie that she. had. spoken that
morning to Lefkowitz, who “was waffling” about, Epstein. pleading ‘to a'state charge that required.
sexual offender registration, and she noted that she would confer ‘with ‘Krischer and Belohlavek.
“to-nake sure the deferise doesn’t try to do af end tun.”

That same morning, Epstein attorney Sanchez; who. had not'’been involved in negotiations
for several weeks, emailed Sloman, advising, “[I] want to finalize the plea. deal, and.there ‘is only
‘one issue outstanding and [I] do not believe that UA lex: has read _all-the defense submissions ‘that:
would assist; in, his determination on this point. , » [U]pon resolution, we will be prepared’ to sign,
as soon as‘today.” From. his out-of-town vacation, Sloman. forwarded. the email. to Acosta, who
replied, “Enjo[y] vacation. Working with, [M]arie ‘on, this.”” Slotian -also’ ‘forwarded. Sanchez’s
email to. Lourie andasked, “Do you know. what: she’s: talking: about?” ‘Lourie responded that.
Sanchez“has not been in any negotiations. Don’t even.cngage with. yet another cook.”

J. The USAO Agrees Not to Criminally Charge:“Potential, Co-Conspirators”

Lefkowitz, in the mcantiine, sent Villafana.a revised draft NPA.that proposed.an 1.8-month.
sentence in the county jail, followed by 12 months of community control, and restored the
provision for a, trust fund for disbursement to an agreed-upon list; of individuals “who seek’
reimbursement by filing.‘suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255.” This. defense draft. retained the
provision promising ot to criminally’ charge Epstcin’s ‘four female assistants and ‘unnamed
employees of the: specific. Epstein-owned corporate: entity, but also. extended. the: provision: to “any
potential co-conspirators” for any criminal charge: arising from ‘the; ongoing federal ‘investigation.
This language: had evolved. from similar language that Villafana had included in the: USAQ’s
earlier proposed. draft: federal. plea. agreement.'*? Lefkowitz also again. included the: sentence:

[22

at ‘The language ii the CSAO*S dratt ‘federal plea agreement stated. “This aeréement resolves. the federal.
criminal, liability: of the defendant; and any co-conspirators im the Southern District ‘of Florida :growing. out-of any:
‘criminal-conduct-by ‘those’persons knowh.to the [USAO].... .”
