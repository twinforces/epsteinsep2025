that the Indictment relates to a 14-hour time period); count slips, thirty minute round forms, and
staffing rosters for the three-week period surrounding Epstein’s suicide; internal MCC phone
records; employee files and staffing history for Noel and Thomas; and a wide range of written
Bureau of Prison policies and regulations, among other documents and materials. In addition and
while not required by Rule 16, the Government produced months in advance of trial (and now,
approximately a year in advance of trial) statements for all of the witnesses interviewed during the
investigation. While the Government is not aware of any other information that warrants
disclosure, it will produce any such materials to the extent it becomes aware of them.

The Government is likewise aware of, and has complied with, its Brady and Giglio
obligations. The Government has already produced any evidence in its possession that is arguably
exculpatory or impeaching. To the extent Giglio material exists in notes of witness statements or
attorney proffers made on behalf of witnesses that have not already been produced, the
Government intends to comply with its obligations and will make such disclosures sufficiently in
advance of trial to be effectively used. Based on that representation alone, the defendant’s motion
should be denied. See United States v. Gonzalez, No. 19 Cr. 123-2 (NRB), 2020 WL 1809293, at
*5 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 9, 2020) (denying a motion to compel because the government “represented
that it had complied with and would continue to comply with its Brady and Rule 16 obligations);
United States v. Underwood, No. 04 Cr. 424 (RWS), 2005 WL 927012, at *1 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 21,
2005) (“The courts of this Circuit repeatedly have denied pretrial requests for discovery orders
pursuant to Brady where the government has made such good faith representations.”); United
States v. Perez, 940 F. Supp. 540, 553 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (denying defendant’s motion to compel
production of Brady based on Government’s representation that it was aware of and had complied
with Brady).
