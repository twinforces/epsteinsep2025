the government is in constructive possession of the materials where, as here, defendant has not

that forced the defendant to engage in conduct for which he is now being charged criminally,
and; 4) made in a manner which contains a possible discriminatory application of BOP policies
by [G]overnment prosecutors.” Motion at 7. But Thomas has not provided support for his
