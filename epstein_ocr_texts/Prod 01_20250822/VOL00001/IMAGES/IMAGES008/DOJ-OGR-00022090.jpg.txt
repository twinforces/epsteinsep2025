It: is also, deliberative ‘in, that; it. will likely make recommendations about: the; BOP, and. those
recommendations will be under.discussion'within the Office of the Inspector Gencral:prior to being:
finalized. and publicly announced., Internal deliberations are’ an important, tool, for agencies in.

‘understanding that those attorneys have not conducted ‘any additional ‘interviews, or otherwise
