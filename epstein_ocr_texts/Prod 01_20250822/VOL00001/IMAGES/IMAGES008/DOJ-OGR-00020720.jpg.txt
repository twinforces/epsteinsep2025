04/29/2022 657 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell....[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...
V. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's Rule 29
motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness testimony and
documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the Defendant's motion based
on constructive amendment or variance because the jury instructions, the Government's
evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core of criminality charged in the
Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any alleged variance. Further,
because the Government neither intentionally delayed its prosecution nor was the
Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the Defendant's motion based.
on pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant's motion as to
multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with Count
Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count
Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant's participation in
the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant's continuous coconspirator,
Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will
enter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing
date remains scheduled for June 28, 2022. The Court previously set a schedule for
sentencing submissions that remains in effect. Dkt. No. 656. This resolves Dkt. No. 599.
