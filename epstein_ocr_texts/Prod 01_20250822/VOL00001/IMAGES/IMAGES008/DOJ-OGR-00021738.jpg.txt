range of 188 to 235 months’ imprisonment, Judge Na-
than “failed to provide reasons for its upward vari-
ance.” (Br.84). Maxwell’s one-sentence argument is so
cursory and undeveloped that it should be deemed
waived. See United States v. Botti, 711 F.3d 299, 313
(2d Cir. 2018) (“It is a settled appellate rule that issues
adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied
by some effort at developed argumentation, are
deemed waived.”). In any event, Judge Nathan en-
gaged in a lengthy discussion of the sentencing factors
when imposing sentence, including Maxwell’s “pivotal
role” in “heinous and predatory” sexual abuse of minor
girls. (SA459). In describing the seriousness of the of-
fense, Judge Nathan found Maxwell’s crimes to be
both “extensive” and far-reaching” and concluded that
“the damage done to these young girls was incalcula-
ble,” as a result of “the painful, horrific, and lasting
impact of [the] trauma” they endured. (SA460). After
an extensive discussion of Maxwell’s horrifying crimes,
Judge Nathan explained that this conduct “demands a
substantial sentence that meets the scope of the con-
duct and the scope of the harm,” and that the sentence
must “send an unmistakable message” of general de-
terrence to “those who engage in and facilitate the sex-
ual abuse and trafficking of underage victims” that
“nobody is above the law.” (SA461). Accordingly, Judge
Nathan concluded that “a very serious, a very signifi-
cant sentence is necessary to achieve the purposes of
punishment” under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a). (SA462). This
discussion belies any claim that Judge Nathan inade-
quately explained the sentence.
