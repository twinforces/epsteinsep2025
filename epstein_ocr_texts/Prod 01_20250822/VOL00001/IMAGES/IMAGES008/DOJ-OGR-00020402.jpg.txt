instead proposing. redactions't6 both the. November 25th ahd November 30th letters.
‘The Government has indicated-that’it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt.'No, 80.
After. due consideration, the Court'will adopt the: ‘Defendant! 's proposed. redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is, guided. by the
thrée—part test articulated bythe Second :Circuit in, Lugosch v. Pyramid: Co; of
Onondaga, 435. F.3d 110 (2d Cir, 2006). Under this'test, the Court:must: (i) determine
«whether the documents in question are “judicial documents; :(ii) assess the-weight of
‘the common, law prestimption ofaccess to the materials; and (iii) balance. competing
considerations against the presumption of.access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factorstinclude but are not limited. to ‘the: danger. of i impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency’ and ‘the:privacy-interests of those-resisting:disclosure.™ Id. at 120
(quoting United States. v: Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050, (2d Cir, 1995) ("Amiodeo II")):
‘The proposed.redactions ‘satisfy’ this test. First, the Court finds that:the Defendant's
letter motions are "relev ant.to the: performance of the: judicial function and ‘useful in
the judicial process,” thereby qualifying as a "judicial. document” for purposes ofthe:
first clement of the Lugosch. test. United States. v. Amiodeo (“Amodco I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d.Cir. 1995). And. while the Court:assumes that the:common law’ presumption of
access attaches, in balancing, competing considerations against. the presumption of
access, the:Court finds that the ar guments.the Defendant: has’ put forthincluding, most.
notably, the privacy’ interests of the individuals referenced:in the letiersfavor her
‘proposed and tailored'redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to dockct the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For'the reasons outlined in:
‘the Goverhment's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt: No: 80; the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
‘interests referenced in.the Defendant's.Nov ember 25, 2020 letter, the Court will‘permit
the Defendant:to make her submission in writing and.to: propose narrowly: tailored
redactions. The parties are herecby:ORDERED to méet:and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion. for
‘release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by. Judge Alison J. Nathan on. 1:2/3/2020)(bw)
