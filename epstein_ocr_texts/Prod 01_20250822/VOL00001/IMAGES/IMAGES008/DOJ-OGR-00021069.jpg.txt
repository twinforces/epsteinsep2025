her to Epstein in New York and that, while there, Epstein held her hand and rubbed
her leg in a movie theater. She also testified that a few months later she visited
Epstein in New Mexico where she met Maxwell. There, she claimed that Maxwell
gave her a massage in which Maxwell massaged her pectoral muscles. Tr. 2085
