and judges may participate remotely. If an argument is remote, the parties will receive

business days prior to the scheduled date of argument. The Court will consider the motion or

settlement of the case, the fully-executed settlement must be reported immediately to the
Calendar Team, and a copy of it must be attached to the stipulation.
