11/19/2021 690 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Before the Court is
the Defendant's fourth motion in limine to "exclude evidence related to Accuser-3," to
whom the Court refers as Witness-3, on the grounds that the testimony is not direct
evidence of the charged conspiracies and is inadmissible under Federal Rules of Evidence
404(b) and 403. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court has twice heard argument related to this
motion, including argument at the November 10, 2021 in camera hearing that was sealed
pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 412. See generally Nov. 1, 2021 Transcript; Nov.
10, 2021 Transcript. At the November 1, 2021 hearing, the Court provided a brief
explanation of its current position based on the information then before it, but the Court
ultimately reserved ruling pending additional briefing. The Court is now in receipt of the
parties' additional briefing and accordingly is prepared to resolve the motion.(See
Footnote 1 on this Memorandum Opinion & Order). The Government now proffers that
the anticipated testimony of Witness-3 will describe how she met the Defendant and her
relationship with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein. In particular, Witness-3 is anticipated to
testify how Defendant introduced her to Mr. Epstein, how massages progressed to involve
sexual activity, and Ms. Maxwell's role in facilitating those massages. Based on all of the
information now before the Court, including a substantially more detailed proffer by the
Government as to the anticipated testimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3 (Nov. 5, 2021); see
also Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43, the Court concludes that some of the anticipated testimony
may serve as direct evidence of the Mann Act counts....[*** See this Memorandum
Opinion & Order ***]... The parties may submit any requested edits to the proposed
limiting instructions that are consistent with the Court's ruling or indicate that they have
