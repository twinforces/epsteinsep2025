was certain which victims were covered. by the state char ges, ‘it should. have been apparent to
Acosta; that without advance planning between the USAO and the State. Attorney’s. Office, there
‘was a substantial risk that. most. of the ‘victims ‘identified. in the federal. investigation would not
receive notice of the hearing. 425 Notification.to the broadest ‘possible, number of identified ‘victims
could only have been:successful if there was appropriate communication. between the: USAO and.
the state prosecutors, communication.that.had previously‘been lacking regarding other significant
issues relating to Epstein. Villafana. and. Sloman’s hastily arranged effort. to enlist in, the.
notification process PBPD Chief Reiter, who likely played.little role in complying:with the state’s
victiin notification: obligations 1 in;a. typical case, was not.an adequate'substitute'for careful planning

and coordination with the State:Attorney’s Office.*7

Even.ifthe State Attorney’s'Offiee had notified.all of the identified victims of the:upcoming,
plea hearing, there was, no, guaranteé-that such notification would _have included information that.
the:state plea was-resolving not just.the-state’s investigation of Epstein, but the federal investigation
as well. The State. Attorney-was not: obligated bystate statutes to inform.the victims ofthe status
of the federal investigation, and ‘there was little: reason to assume: Krischer,, or one: of his staff,
would voluntarily..do so, thereby. putting the State Attorney’s Office in,'the position of fielding;
victiin questions:and concerns about the outcome. Furthermore,.as both,the USAO and the defense
had differing views as to who could lawfully. participate in the state: plea hearing, there: is. no
indication that, Acosta, Sloman, or Villafana took steps to confirm, that, if victims appeared, they

could actually’ ‘participate : ‘in the'state court. proceeding when they were:not victims of the charged.

Through counsel, Acosta asserted. to-OPR that: because: Villafafia.and Sloman both ‘told.
OPR, that ‘they believed that. state officials would. notify the victims, “OPR identified no reason
