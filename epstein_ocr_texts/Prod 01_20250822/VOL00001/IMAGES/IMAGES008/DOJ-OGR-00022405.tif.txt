6 TODD BLANCHE: And while we're just --
7 with respect to your father, there have been multiple
8 questions about whether he worked for any
9 intelligence agency.
10 Do you have any knowledge about that?
11 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I think -- well
12 certainly my father had a background in intelligence
13 during -- because he was -- I believe he did in the
14 second World War. He was an intelli- -- a British
15 intelligence officer. I think that, my sort of
16 belief is that once you've been an intelligence
17 officer, you're kind of -- always; it doesn't mean
18 that you're formally employed.
19 So I don't think my dad in any formal
20 sense was, you know, employed by the -- any agency.
21 But when you are a very significant businessman and
22 politician, as my father was, you meet with people
23 over time and you, I guess trade business or ideas.
24 I think if -- if that would fall under
25 that definition, that's how I would give it.
