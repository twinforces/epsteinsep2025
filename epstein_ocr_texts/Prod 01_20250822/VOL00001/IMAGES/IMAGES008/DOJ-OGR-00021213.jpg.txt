and some of the victims as well, regularly recruited local high-school-age girls to give him
massages in his home that, in some cases, led to sexual activity.

Through their interviews with victims, the police learned more about Epstein’s conduct.
Some girls had only one encounter with Epstein, while others had many encounters with him. The
nature of the massages varied. According to victims, some girls remained fully clothed while they
massaged Epstein, some wore only their underwear, and some were fully nude. Victims stated
that during these massages, Epstein masturbated himself. Some victims alleged that he touched
them during the massage, usually fondling their breasts or touching their vaginas directly or
through their clothing. Some victims reported that Epstein used a vibrator to masturbate them, and
some stated that he digitally penetrated them. Some victims who stated that they saw him more
often alleged that Epstein engaged in oral and vaginal sex with them. According to one victim, an
Epstein female assistant participated, on at least one occasion, in sexual activity with the victim at
Epstein’s direction.’

Although the allegations varied in the specific details, for the most part they were consistent
in describing a general pattern of conduct by Epstein and several of his assistants. According to
the information provided to, and evidence gathered by, the PBPD, Epstein’s assistants scheduled
up to three massage appointments each day, often contacting the girls to make an appointment
while Epstein was en route to Palm Beach from one of his other residences. Typically, when a girl
arrived at Epstein’s home for a massage, she was taken upstairs to the master bedroom and
bathroom area by one of Epstein’s assistants, who set up a massage table and massage oils. When
the assistant left the room, Epstein entered, wearing only a robe or a towel. After removing his
clothing, Epstein lay face down and nude on the massage table, instructed the girl to remove her
clothing, and then explained to her how he wished her to perform the massage. During the
massage, Epstein masturbated himself, often while fondling the girl performing the massage.
When Epstein climaxed, the massage was over. Usually, Epstein paid the girl $200 for the
massage, and if she had not been to his home before, Epstein asked for her phone number to contact
her in the future. Epstein encouraged the girls who performed these massages to find other girls
interested in performing massages for him, and promised that if a girl brought a friend along to
perform a massage, each girl would receive $200. Several of the victims acknowledged to the
PBPD that they had recruited other girls on Epstein’s behalf.

The evidence regarding Epstein’s knowledge of the girls’ ages was mixed. Some girls who
recruited other girls reportedly instructed the new recruits to tell Epstein, if asked, that they were
over 18 years old. However, some girls informed the PBPD that they told Epstein their real ages.
Police were able to corroborate one girl’s report that Epstein sent flowers to her at her high school
after she performed ina school play. In addition, an employee of Epstein told the PBPD that some
of the females who came to Epstein’s residence appeared to be underage.

Epstein was aware of the PBPD investigation almost from the beginning. He retained local
criminal defense counsel, who in turn hired private investigators. In October 2005, the PBPD,
with the assistance of the State Attorney’s Office, obtained a search warrant for Epstein’s
residence. When police arrived at Epstein’s home on October 20, 2005, to execute the warrant,
7 According to the PBPD records, investigators obtained no allegations or evidence that any person other than
this female assistant participated in the sexual activity with the girls.
