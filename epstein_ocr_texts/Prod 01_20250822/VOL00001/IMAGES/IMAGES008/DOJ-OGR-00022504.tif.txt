2? masseuse for him in St. Thomas, because sometimes,
3 even though I say he would always travel with an
4 entourage, sometimes he didn't, and he wanted to have
5 a massage locally.
6 So I visited the mass- -- the spas that
7 were local in St. Thomas and in St. John. And if I
8 met someone, a man or a woman, actually, because it
9 was difficult to find somebody in St. Thomas, it's
10 not exactly, you know. So, and I did find a couple
11 of people who would come.
12 So that's how they came, because also it
13 was a schlep. So if you had somebody who came, it
14 would be -- you would have to, you know, boat ride
15 and you -- several hours. It wasn't just a -- it's
16 not like arriving with your massage table and stuff.
17 So there was that. So I did do that.
18 TODD BLANCHE: So did, over the years,
19 males also give massages to Mr. Epstein?
20 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Yes. I did say, I
21 don't think -- at the beginning, definitely. And I
22 would say towards sort of, again, late '90s, I don't
23 remember any men. They were at the beginning, I
24 think in that -- towards the late '90s, I cannot
25 think of any men. I only think of women.
