Sloman told OPR that he was “proceeding under the belief that we were going to notify [the
victims], even though it wasn’t a federal case. Whether we were required or not.” Sloman also
told OPR that while “we didn’t think that we had an obligation to send them victim notification
letters... I think... Marie and... the agents . . . were keeping the victims apprised at some
level.”

On December 7, 2007, Villafafia prepared letters containing the above information to be
sent to multiple victims and emailed Acosta and Sloman, requesting permission to send them.*!®
Sloman, however, had that day received a letter from Sanchez, advising that Epstein’s plea hearing
was scheduled for January 4, 2008, and requesting that the USAO “hold off’ sending the victim
notification letters until “we can further discuss the contents.” Also that day, Starr and Lefkowitz
submitted to Acosta the two lengthy “independent ethics opinions” supporting the defense
arguments against the federal investigation and the NPA’s use of 18 U.S.C. § 2255. Sloman
responded to Villafafia’s request with an email instructing her to “Hold the letter.”?!’ Sloman told
OPR that he “wanted to push the [victim notification] letter out,” but his instruction to Villafafia
was “the product of me speaking to somebody,” although he could not be definitive as to whom.
Sloman further told OPR that once the NPA “looked like it was going to fall apart,” the USAO
“had concerns that if we g[a]ve them the victim notification letter . .. and the deal fell apart, then
the victims would be instantly impeached by the provision that you’re entitled to monetary
compensation.”

On December 10, 2007, Villafafia contacted the attorney who at the time represented the
victim who later became CVRA petitioner “Jane Doe #2” to inform him that she “was preparing
victim notification letters.” In her 2017 declaration filed in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia noted
that she reached out to Jane Doe #2’s counsel, despite the fact that the USAO no longer considered
316 The FBI case agent had emailed Villafafia the day before stating, “The letter that is currently being revised
needs to take into account that several victims have never been notified by your office or mine.” The case agent also
stated, “I do not feel that [the defense] should have anything to do with the drafting or issuing of this letter. My
primary concern is that we meet our federal obligations to the victims in accordance with federal law.”

317 Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall asking Sloman for an explanation for not sending the letters; rather,
she “just remember[ed] putting them all in the Redweld and putting them in a drawer and being disgusted.”
