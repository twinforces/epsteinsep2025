alternative holding — “{a] further ground for [its] conclusion” —that, even. in
cases where “fraud” occurs, a categorical analysis precludes extending the WSLA
to prosecutions. for making false ‘statements. /d. at 221-22. And in.applying this
categorical approach, Bridges looked, not to the legislative history of the WSLA,
but to Scharton and Noveck: (which, involved.a different statute). See Bridges, 346
USS. at 222 (citing, infer alia, Scharton and Noveck).

interpretation should govern. See Smith v. Ciny of Jackson, Miss., 544 U.S. 228,
233 (2005); Wasser’v. New York State Off. of Vocational & Educational Servs.,

limitations for certain, terrorism offenses in, which, “‘he commission of stich offense

resulted in, or created a foreseeable risk of, death or serious bodily injury to
