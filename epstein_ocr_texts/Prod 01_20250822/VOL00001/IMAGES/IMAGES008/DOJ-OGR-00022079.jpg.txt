2. ‘Discussion

Thomas’s ‘motion, makes clear that. he ‘intends for his principal, defense at-trial to be that
‘irrespective of. his guilt or innocence. of the: false statements. charges—he: should. be acquitted
because the MCC was understaffed, Thomas was. overworked, ‘his supervisors did ‘not catch his
crime. in'the moment, and. falsification of count slips is rampant within ‘the BOP. (See, Mot. 3
(“staffing, issucs, staffing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP.
procedures go to the ‘heart. of his defense to the ‘government’s, criminal allegations”); ‘9 (“Mr.
Thomas will assert that the. rampant staffing shortages present at the MCE in-August of 2019 led.
tothe conduct for which'Mr. Thomas is now’ criminally charged.”)). Thomas has failed to mect
his burden in establishing’ the ‘matcriality of discovery about. these topics to preparing a. valid.
defense because the materials he secks.do not rebut the :merits of the criminal charges and instead
would. be impermissibly. used to encourage jury-nullification,

The purported, reasons for Thomias’s decision ‘to falsify count :slips—being: tired,
overworked, or understaffed—are not.a valid Icgal defense, and therefore evidence related to:those
Issucs is not relevant: ‘Put simply, were: the jury to find beyond'a, reasonable doubt ‘that; Thomas.
intentionally’ made. materially false. statements and d/so that did so while ‘tired. or overworked, it
would still be required.to.convict.him, See United.States y, Garr,424 F.3d 213,22] (2d Cir. 2005)
(holding that “it was ‘proper forthe: district. court to instruct: the. jury’that. it. had.a duty to find [the
defendant] guilty ifthe government proved beyond a reasonable doubtevery clement of the offense
with which he was charged” (internal citation omitted)).

None of Thoimias’s proffered excuses ‘relate to proving or rebutting the clements of a.
violation ‘of 18 U:S:C. § 1001 (a)(3) as they do not concern. whether a writing or.entry was false,
whether it was. material ‘to ‘a, matter‘within the jurisdiction of the: BOP, or whether he knowingly’
