Menchel told OPR that he: did not recall,the July 26, 2007 mecting. Nonetheless, he:

leave without discussion, Acosta told.OPR. that. he had “decided and endorsed. this ‘resolution, at:
some: © point, "but he didn not: t recall ‘being aware that. ‘Menchel was going to announce the decision
relaying of that decision, he said. it: “would have been consistent with” his decision. for Menchel. to
do so. Neither Sloman nor Lourie recalled the meeting. The. FBI case agent recalled, attending’ a,
meeting at the USAO in. Miami. with. her co-case ‘agent and supervisors, together ‘with Villafaiia,

to 24 months with this set of offenses.”*?
