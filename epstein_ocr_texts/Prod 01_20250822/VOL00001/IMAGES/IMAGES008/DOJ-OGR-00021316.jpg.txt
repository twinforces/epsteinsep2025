Florida law treated work release as part of confinement; and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s
Office had discretion to grant work release to any inmate. Black also claimed that Acosta
“recognized that Mr. Epstein might serve a portion of his sentence through the Work Release
Program” and pointed out that the December 6, 2007 draft victim notification letter sent to
Lefkowitz for review specifically referred to the victim’s right to be notified “if [Epstein] is
allowed to participate in a work release program.”

On December 3, 2008, in advance of a scheduled meeting with Black, Villafafia sent
Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior an email about Epstein’s participation in the work
release program:

It appears that, since Day 1, Goldberger and Krisher [sic] . . . have

been scheming to get Epstein out on work release. For example, the

indictment incorrectly charges Epstein for an offense that would

have made him ineligible for work release if it had been charged

correctly. (Remember that Krisher [sic] also went along with letting

us believe that Epstein was pleading to a registrable offense when

Epstein’s folks and Krisher [sic] believed that . . . the offense was

not registrable.) Krisher [sic] and Goldberger also told us that

Epstein would be housed at the Palm [Beach County] Jail, not the

Stockade, but he would not have been eligible for work release if at

the jail....

As part of his work release, Epstein has hired off-duty Sheriff's

deputies to provide him with “protection.” It appears that he is

paying between $3000 and $4100 per week for this service, despite

the work release rules barring anyone from the Sheriff’s Office (and

the Sheriff’s Office itself) from having “any business transactions

with inmates .. . while they are in the custody or supervision of the

Sheriff... .”
Villafafia added that she and her immediate supervisor believed that the USAO “should not budge
on the 24-hour-a-day incarceration” requirement. Referring to the CVRA litigation, Villafafia also
pointed out that two victims had brought suit against the USAO “for failing to keep them informed
about the investigation,” and the office had ‘“‘an obligation to inform all of the victims upon
Epstein’s release.”

On December 11, 2008, Villafafia wrote to the Corrections Division of the Palm Beach
County Sheriffs Office to express the USAO’s view that Epstein was not eligible for work release
and to alert the Sheriff's Office that Epstein’s work release application contained several
inaccuracies and omitted relevant information. Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s application
identified his place of employment as the “Florida Science Foundation,” and the telephone number
listed in the application for the “Florida Science Foundation” was the telephone number to the law
firm of Epstein’s attorney Jack Goldberger. Villafafia also noted that the individual identified in
the work release file as Epstein’s “supervisor” at the “Florida Science Foundation” had submitted
publicly available sworn filings to the Internal Revenue Service indicating that Epstein worked
only one hour per week and earned no compensation, but that same individual had represented to
