EXCLUSIVE: ARE ‘ITCHING  @ ‘
GET THEIR HANDS ON’ CHARLISE —
MUTTEN'S STEPDAD - BUT FRIEND INSISTS
Legal experts said that if David failed to disclose his past experiences before the jury deliberations, Maxwell could
have grounds to claim a mistrial and have her convictions quashed.
However, the question of whether a potential juror was a victim of sexual abuse or a relative or friend of a victim
was asked in the 50-question survey completed by each juror ahead of selection.
David said he went into the trial firmly believing that Maxwell was ‘innocent until proven guilty’ and viewing the
victims with a skeptical eye.
But, he said, ‘After all I've learned, she's just as guilty as Epstein. | don't want to call her a monster, but a predator is
the right word.
‘She knew what was happening. She knew what Epstein was doing and she allowed it to happen. She participated
in getting these girls comfortable so that he could have his way with them.
‘And, to me, them returning repeatedly for the money has nothing to do with anything because these girls were
minors, and it doesn't matter what incentivized them. It matters what happened to them.'
