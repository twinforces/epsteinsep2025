Defendant to file written answers to the following specific questions by 12:00 p.m. on
Thursday, April 22, 2021: 1. Does defense counsel continue to seek an adjournment of
the July 12th start date for trial on the non—perjury counts? 2. If the answer to question
1 is yes, what is the specific request being made as to length of adjournment? In
particular, is the request for a 90-day adjournment? An adjournment until January
2022? Or something else? The Court requires a specific request be made and justified
or it will not be considered. If Maxwell continues to seek an adjournment, the
Government may submit any response by 5:00 pm on April 22, 2021. The Court will
consider the submissions and resolve expeditiously. As noted, however, unless and
until an adjournment is specifically requested and granted, the parties shall assume that
the Court will request a jury selection date as close to July 12th as possible and shall
plan accordingly. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/20/2021)
