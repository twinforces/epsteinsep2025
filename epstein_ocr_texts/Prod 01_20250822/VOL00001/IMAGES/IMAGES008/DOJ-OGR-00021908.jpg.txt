INTRODUCTION
1. On or about August 10, 2019, TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL
THOMAS, the defendants, in dereliction of their duties as
correctional officers at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
(“MCC”), repeatediy failed to perform mandated counts of prisoners
under their watch in the MCC’s Special Housing Unit (“SHU”).
Instead, for substantial portions of their shifts, NOEL and THOMAS
sat at their desk, browsed the internet, and moved around the
common area of the SHU. To conceal their failure to perform their ;
duties, NORL and THOMAS repeatedly signed false certifications
attesting to having conducted multiple counts of inmates when, in
. truth and in fact, they never conducted such counts. As a result
of those false statements, the MCC believed prisoners in the SHU
were being regularly monitored and accounted for when, in fact, as
a result of the defendants’ conduct, no correctional officer
conducted any count or round of the SHU from approximately 10:30
