2, The Evidence Does Not Establish: That. Acosta Negotiated a Deal.
Favorable to Epstein over Breakfast:with Defense Counsel

‘OPR. separately ‘considered, the circumstances: of one specific meeting that has been. the:
subject of:media attention and-public criticism. The Miami _Herald’s November 2018 reporting on
the: Epstein: ‘investigation opened with an account. ofthe October 12, 2007 breakfast:meeting that:
defense counsel Jay Lefkowitz arranged ‘to: have with Acosta at’ the West, Palm, Beach Marriott:
hotel. According to the Miami Herald article, “a deal:was struck” at the: meeting to. allow Epstein.
to serve “just, 13 months” in. the county jail in exchange for the shuttering of ‘the federal,
investigation, and. Acosta also agreed to “conceal” the full. extent of Epstein’s crimes from. the:
victims andthe public. 2s Although. public criticism of the: meeting, ‘has. focused on, the ‘fact’ that:
the meeting occurred 1 in.a ‘hotel far from. Acosta’ Ss Miami office, the evidence shows that Acosta
near + the USAO’: S West Palm Beach office, ‘because: at ‘midday on October '2 heawas to speak a at
the Palin Beach, County Bench Barf Conference. After carefully considering the evidence
surrounding the breakfast meeting, including, contemporancous: ‘email communications and.witness
accounts, OPR ‘concludes that Acosta did not negotiate the NPA, or ‘make any significant.
Concessions relating to ‘it, during. or as a result of the: October breakfast-mecting.

Epstein and his attorneys signed'the NPA on.September 24, 2007—more than/two weeks
before the October 12 breakfast meeting. The signed ‘NPA contained. all of the key provisions
resulting. froim ‘the preceding weeks of negotiations between the :parties, ahd despite a later
addendum and ongoing disputes about interpreting the damages provision of the agreement, those
key provisions remained. in place. thereafter, Acosta told. OPR. that throughout the negotiations
with the defense, he. sought three goals: (1) Epstein’s guilty plea in, state ‘court. to an, offense.
requiring, registration .as:a sexual offender; (2) .a, sentence: of imprisonment; and 3) a mechanism.
through which victims could. obtain, monetary damages from, Epstein. As noted. previously, the:
USAO?’s original plea offer‘in Menchel’s August 3, 2007 letter expressed a “non-negotiable”
deniand. that Epstein agree to. a two-year term of: imprisonment, andthe final NPA ‘required, only
an ‘18-month.sentence, but.the:decision'to reduce the required term.of.imprisonment.from.24'to 18
months ‘was nade well before. Acosta’s' breakfast meeting with counsel. The NPA. signed on.
September 24, 2007, required, 18 ‘months’ incarceration, _sexual offender: registration, and ia

ferms were » notabandoned or materially altered after. the breakfast meeting,

Atthe time of Acosta’s October breakfast meeting with. Lefkowitz, ‘two: issues involving
the: NPA were in. dispute: Neither of those ‘issues was ultimately resolved:in.a way that materially
changed. the key. provisions of the NPA.. First, at Sloman’s instigation, the USAO sought to change
the: mechanism. for appointing an attorney representative for the victims. This USAO-initiated
request had prompted. discussions about an “addendum” to the NPA: Sloman. sent the text of a,
proposed'NPA addendum to Lefkowitz.on-October. 1.1,'2007.7** Although OPR found:no: decisive:
