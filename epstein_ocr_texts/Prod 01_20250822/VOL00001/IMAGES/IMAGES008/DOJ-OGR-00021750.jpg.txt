Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page of 35

Ms. Maxwell argues that the District Court’s sentence was in error because
(1) its four-point enhancement under USSG Section 3B1.1 lacked any support in the
record that Ms. Maxwell supervised another criminal participant; and (2) its
sentencing decision was predicated on a miscalculation of the applicable guideline
range for incarceration and fines in the first instance and a subsequent failure to
correct its error by either recalculating the sentence so as to comport with the proper
guideline range or provide reasons for its upward departure. 18 U.S.C. Section
3553(c)(2).

The conviction must be reversed and the indictment dismissed or, in the
alternative, the matter should be remanded for the appropriate hearings.

POINT I
(Point I in Appellant’s Principal Brief)

MS. MAXWELL IS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF A NON-
PROSECUTION AGREEMENT WHICH, BY ITS TERMS, BARRED THE
USAO-SDNY FROM PROSECUTING MS. MAXWELL FOR THESE
OFFENSES.

In this Circuit, while ordinarily any plea or non-prosecution agreement is
confined to enforcement in the district of origin, under U.S. v. Annabi, supra., there
is an exception wherein "it affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a
broader restriction," as is the case here. See Annabi at 672. This exception dictates
that the NPA be enforced to protect Ms. Maxwell as a third-party beneficiary to the
agreement from prosecution for these offenses. See U.S. v. Cambindo-Valencia, 609
