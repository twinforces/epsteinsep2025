sentence of incarceration, and‘the USAO-would considera pleathat-:differed from that:requirement:
a breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”

The: guilty plea Epstein entered.:in.state court in June 2008 was consistent with the dictates
ofthe NPA, and pursuant'to ‘that’plea, the court imposed a sentence of 18 months’ incarceration.
Epstein, however, applied. for and was. accepted into ‘the work ‘release, program, and:was able to
serve a, substantial ‘portion. of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did. not reference work,
release norsauthorize Epstein:to receive such benefits. during his tenure at the'Palm.Beach County:
Stockade. Moreover, Villafana received assurances from defense-counsel that Epstein would-serve
his entire sentence: of confinement “in custody.” ‘Responsibility for. the decision to afford Epstein,
work. release. privileges during his incarceration rested. with state officials, who had the sole
authority for administering the work:release: program..

October 12, 2007'breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz; OPR. found:nothing in the. record to suggest:
that the imecting ‘resulted: in a, material change to’ the NPA, affected, the sentence Epstein, served

F. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Attorney Lefkowitz. during the NPA
Negotiations Do Not Establish That Villafafia, or Other Subjects, Intended to:
Give Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or
Other Improper Influences

During the ‘CVRA. litigation,, the. petitioners obtaified. from, Epstein’s: attorney, and filed
under seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein. attorney Lefkowitz and Villafaiia
(and, others with Acosta and Sloman) during September-2007 when the NPA was, being finalized,
and thereafter. These ‘emails. had. been redacted ‘to delete most of ‘Lefkowitz’s side of the
comniunications, and conseqtiently they did not. reflect the. ‘full, contéxt of Villafana’s
communications to Lefkowitz. The redacted emails were: later unsealed. and. made ‘public over
Epstein’s objections.**° Media coverage pointed to the content:and.tone: of Villafatia’s emails as:
proof that Villafana and the USAO worked in concert. with Epstcin’s ‘attorneys ‘to: keep’ the:
“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails: in.
particular’ were cited as evidence of the USAO’s ‘improper favoritism towards Epstein. In one
example, Villafana'told Lefkowitz that.she was willing’to include in the NPA aprovision-agreeing,
not to-prosecute others, but would,” “prefer not to highlight: for'the judge all of the othercrimes and
