This culture of silence provided cover for Maxwell
and Epstein to sexually abuse young girls. In the early
phase of the conspiracy, between 1994 and 2001, Max-
well and Epstein identified vulnerable girls, typically
from single-mother households and difficult financial
circumstances. (Tr.295, 1178, 2051-52). Maxwell and
Epstein then isolated the girls, spending time with
them away from their family and friends. (Tr.296-99,
1175-82, 2069-70, 2077-79). During that time, they
groomed the girls through techniques such as giving
them gifts, pretending to be friends, and building
trust. (Tr.298-303, 348, 2079-81). Maxwell and Ep-
stein then normalized sexual situations and sexual
touching. (Tr.300-01, 2081-84). Finally, they transi-
tioned to sexual abuse, often through the pretext of
giving Epstein a massage. (Tr.306-15, 319-28, 1183-88,
2084-88).2

In the later phase of the scheme, from 2001 through
2004, Maxwell and Epstein developed a stream of girls
who recruited each other to visit Epstein at his Palm
Beach residence. (Tr.1518-25, 1543-46). Maxwell and
Epstein paid young girls hundreds of dollars in cash in

2 These techniques were the textbook methods of
child predators. At trial, Dr. Lisa Rocchio, an expert in
psychology with a specialized expertise in traumatic
stress and interpersonal violence, explained that chil-
dren are most frequently sexually abused through
grooming and coercion in the context of a relationship.
(Tr.713). Dr. Rocchio explained that abusers use a se-
ries of deceptive tactics to engage a child in sexual
abuse. (Tr.715-20).
