evidence. of, a violation ofthe agreement. Epstein. and, his counsel
agtec that'the computers that.are currently under, [legal process] will
be safeguarded in, their. current condition. by Epstein’ 's counsel. or
their agents until the ters and. conditions of the Agreement are
fulfilled.

Later that-day, Villafana sent Lefkowitz a lengthy email'to: convey two options Lourie had
suggested: “the original proposal” for a state plea’but.with.an agreement for:an 8-month sentence,
orpleas to state’ charges’ and ‘two federal obstruction- -of-justice charges.. Villafana also told.
Lefkowitz she was willing to:ask Acosta again. to: approveca. federal plea to a:five- ~year’ conspiracy
with a Rule 1.1 (c) binding recommendation for a 20-month sentence. Villafaiia explained:

As to timing, it is my understanding that. Mr. Epstein needs; to ‘be
‘sentenced in, the state after he is sentenced. in the: federal case, but.
not ‘that he needs: to plead guilty and’be sentenced after serving his
federal'time. Andy recommended that:some of the timing issues be
addressed only in. the state agreement, so that.it isn’t obvious to the
judge that we are trying to create federal jurisdiction for ‘prison,
purposes.

With regard to’prosecution of individuals other than. Epstein, Villafatia suggested standard.
federal plea agreement language regarding the::resolution of all criminal. liability, “and I will
mention “co-conspirators,” but] would prefer not‘to highlight. for the judge all of the: other crimes
and all. of the other persons that we could charge.” Villatajia told OPR, that she: was ‘willing to
include a non-pros¢cution provision for Epstein’s co-conspirators, who at the'tinte she understood
to be the four women.named in the proposed agreement, because:the USAO.was not interested in.
prosecuting’ those individuals if Epstein entered,a plea. Villafana told OPR, “[W]e considered
Epstein to bethe: top ofthe food chain, and.we wouldn’t}have been.interested.in. prosecuting anyone
else.” She did. not: consider the: possibility: that Epstein:imight be trying to ‘protect other, unnamed
‘individuals, and no.one, including the FBI case agents, raised that concern. Villafaiia also told.
OPR thatiher reference to“all of the other crimes and all:of the other persons that we, could charge”
related to her concern.that. ifthe plea agreement contained. information about-uncharged. conduct,
the court: tmight ask for moré ¢ information about that conduct and inquire way it had net t bee

agr eement.was: breached! 13

With regard to immigration, Villafaiia told-OPR that the USAO generally did-not take any
position in plea.agreements on.immigration issues, and that in’this case, ‘there was no evidence'that:
either of the two assistants: who were foreign: nationals: had. committed fraud. in connection. with
their immigration paperwork, “and [think that they were both in.status. So theresvasn’t any reason
