considered that the USAO’s most pivotal decisions—to resolve the case through an NPA requiring
Epstein to serve time in jail, register as a sexual offender, and provide monetary damages to
victims—had been made by July 31, 2007, when the USAO presented its “term sheet” to the
defense. This was before Acosta had ever met with defense counsel and when he had not indicated
any plans to do so. It also was well before Acosta’s October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting with
defense counsel Lefkowitz, which received strong public and media criticism. OPR also
considered significant the fact that although the USAO made numerous concessions in the course
of negotiating the final NPA, the USAO did not accede to the defense request that the USAO end
federal involvement altogether and return the matter to the state authorities to handle as they saw
fit, and the USAO refused to eliminate its requirement that Epstein register as a sexual offender,
despite a strong push by the defense that it do so.
3. Subject and Witness Interviews and Contemporaneous Records
Identified Case-Specific Considerations Relating to Evidence, Legal
Theories, Litigation Risk, and a Trial’s Potential Impact on Victims

Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie told OPR that they did not recall the specific content
of discussions about the challenges presented by a potential federal prosecution or reasons for
Acosta’s decision to resolve the federal investigation through the NPA, but they and Villafafia
identified for OPR several case-specific factors, unrelated to Epstein’s wealth or associations, that
either did or likely would have been included in those discussions and that OPR concludes likely
influenced Acosta’s decision-making. These considerations included assessment of the
evidentiary risks and the potential impact of a trial on the victims. For the most part, however,
these factors appear more aptly to pertain to the decision to resolve the case through a pre-charge
disposition, but do not directly explain why Acosta chose to resolve the federal investigation
through a guilty plea in state court. That decision appears to have stemmed from Acosta’s concerns
about intruding into an area he believed was traditionally handled by state law enforcement
authorities.

In a declaration submitted to the district court in 2017 in connection with the CVRA
litigation, Villafafia explained the USAO’s rationale for terminating the federal investigation
through the NPA:

Prior to the Office making its decision to direct me to engage in

negotiations with Epstein’s counsel, I discussed the strengths and

weaknesses of the case with members of the Office’s management,

and informed them that most of the victims had expressed

significant concerns about having their identities disclosed. ... It is

my understanding from these and other discussions that these

factors, that is, the various strengths and weaknesses of the case and

the various competing interests of the many different victims

(including the privacy concerns expressed by many), together with

the Office’s desire to obtain a guaranteed sentence of incarceration

for Epstein, the equivalent of uncontested restitution for the victims,
Acosta to improperly benefit Epstein or would have remained silent if they suspected that Acosta, or any of their
colleagues, was motivated by improper influences.
