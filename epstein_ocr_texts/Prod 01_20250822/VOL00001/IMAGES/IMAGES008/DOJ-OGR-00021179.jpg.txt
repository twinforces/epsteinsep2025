‘Soon.after he was incareerated,.Epstein applied for the. Palm.Beach County Sheriff's work:
release program, and the Sheriff approved his application. In, October 2008,, Epstein, began.
spending 12 ‘hours a day ‘purportedly working at the “Elorida Science Foundation,” ‘an entity
Epstein, had ‘recently: incorporated. that ‘was co-located at the West Palm Beach office of one: of
Epstein’s attorneys. Although the: NPA. specified ‘a. term of incarceration. of 18: months,. Epstein
received “gain time,” that is, time off for good: behavior, and he actually served less-than 13 inonths,
of‘incarceration. On July 22, 2009, Epstein: was released from custody. to:a.one-ycar term-of-home
detention as.a condition. of community control, and ‘he registered as a sexual offender with the:
Florida Department of Law Enforcement. After victims and-news media filed suit.in'Florida-courts
for release of the copy-of'the NPA-:that had'been:filed under‘seal in the state court file, a statejudge
in September 2009 ordered -it to be:made public.

By mid-2010, Epstein reportedly’ settled. multiple civil lawsuits: brought: against hith by
victims ‘seeking monctary. damages, including the two petitioners.in the CVRA litigation. During,
the CVRA litigation, the petitioners sought discovery from the USAO, which inade substantial.
document productions, filed lengthy privilege logs:in.supportof-its withholding: of-documents, and.
submitted declarations from the AUSA. and. the EBI case. agents who conducted. the federal.
investigation. The USAO opposed efforts to: unseal, various records,,as did Epstein, who: was
permitted. ‘to intervene:in the litigation with.:respect to certain issues. Nevertheless, the court:
ultimately: ordered, that substantial records relating to the USAO’s resolution of the Epstein case
be made:public.. During:the course of:the litigation, the: court made:numerous tulings interpreting,
the CVRA. After failed. efforts’ to:settle'the case, theparties” cross motions for'summary judgment
remained pending, for:more'than a year.

In, 2017, President Donald ‘Trump nominated Acosta to be Secretary of Labor. At his
March.2017 confirmation hearing, Acosta’was questioned only briefly about the Epstein.case.. On
April 1'7, 2017, the Senate confirmed Acosta’s appointment-as Labor Secretary..

In. the decade following his release from. incatceration, Epstein reportedly continued ‘to
settle: multiple civil suits brought by:many, but:not all, of his victims. Epstein was otherwise: able:
to resume his lavish lifestyle, largely avoiding the interest of the, press. On November 28, 2018,
however, the Miami Herald published ‘an extensive: investigative report. about state and federal.
criminal investigations initiated more than, 12 years earlier into, allegations: that Epstein had:cocreed,
girls ‘into engaging. in sexual, activity with him at his Palm Beach. estate.” The Mian Herald.
reported. that, in,2007, Acosta entered.into an‘“extraordinary” deal:with. Epstein i in, the form of the
NPA, which permitted Epstein to: avoid federal prosecution and ‘a potentially lengthy prison
sentence by pleading guilty in. state: court to “two ‘prostitution. charges:” According;to the Miami
Herald, the governinent also: immunized from, prosecution Epstcin’s co-conspirators and
concealed, from .Epstein’s victims the terms ‘of. the NPA. Through its reporting, which :included
intétviews of eight victims and. information. from ‘publicly available documents, ‘the :newspaper'
painted. a: ‘portrait of federal. and:state prosecutors who had: ignored serious criminal, conduct by a
wealthy'man with:powerful and politically connected friends by granting him.a “deal.of'a lifetime”
that allowed him both. to escape: significant punishment for his’ past conduct. and. to continuc ‘his.
