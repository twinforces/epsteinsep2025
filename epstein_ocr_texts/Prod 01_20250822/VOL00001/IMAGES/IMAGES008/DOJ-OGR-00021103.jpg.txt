Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Paged6 of 113
POINT II
ALL COUNTS ARE BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

For noncapital offenses such as those with which Appellant was charged, the
statute of limitations is five years. 18 U.S.C. § 3282(a). It is undisputed that a 5-
year limitations period would bar all charges brought against Defendant.

To escape the consequences of its delay in bringing these charges, the
Government hangs its hat on 18 U.S.C. § 3283. Section 3283 is a narrow
exception to the statute of limitations, but its application can expose a person to
criminal prosecution during the lifetime of anyone who accuses him or her of child
abuse or kidnapping. To guard against overreach, it is important to recall the well-
settled “principle that criminal limitations statutes are to be liberally interpreted in
favor of repose.” Toussie, 397 U.S. at 115 (quoting U.S. v. Scharton, 285 U.S. 518
(1926)). Indeed, the Government’s and District Court’s capacious reading of
§3283 would have wide-ranging ramifications in this Circuit—beyond Maxwell’s
case—if blessed by this Court.

Section 3283 provides that “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise
preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or
kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution
during the life of the child, or for ten years after the offense, whichever is longer.”
