By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that each of these terms is
material to this agreement and is supported by independent consideration and that a breach
of any one of these conditions allows the United States to elect to terminate the agreement
and to investigate and prosecute Epstein and any other individual or entity for any and all
federal offenses.

By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that he is aware of the fact that
the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that in all criminal
prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial. Epstein further
is aware that Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the Court
may dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint for unnecessary delay in presenting
a charge to the Grand Jury, filing an information, or in bringing a defendant to trial. Epstein
hereby requests that the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such
prosecution. Epstein agrees and consents that any delay from the date of this Agreement to
the date of initiation of prosecution, as provided for in the terms expressed herein, shall be
deemed to be a necessary delay at his own request, and he hereby waives any defense to such
prosecution on the ground that such delay operated to deny him rights under Rule 48(b) of
the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States to a speedy trial or to bar the prosecution by reason of the running of the statute
of limitations for a period of months equal to the period between the signing of this
agreement and the breach of this agreement as to those offenses that were the subject of the -
grand jury’s investigation. Epstein further asserts and certifies that he understands that the
Fifth Amendment and Rule 7(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide that all
felonies must be charged in an indictment presented to a grand jury. Epstein hereby agrees
and consents that, if a prosecution against him is instituted for any offense that was the
subject of the grand jury’s investigation, it may be by way of an Information signed and filed
by the United States Attorney, and hereby waives his right to be indicted by a grand jury as
to any such offense.
