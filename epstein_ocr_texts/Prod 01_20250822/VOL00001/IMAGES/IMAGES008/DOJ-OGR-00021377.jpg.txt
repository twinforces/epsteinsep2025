the: federal investigation in. exchange for. a plea in. state court to a, charge that carried a two-year
sentence. ‘The FBI co-case agent told. OPR that, in.a,imecting’to discuss. the resolution, at which,
the EBL was present, the. .co-case: agent specifically suggested that the. USAO wait ‘to pursue: a
resolution ‘until after the litigation was resolved, but this suggestion was “pushed under the rug”
without comment. Although the co-case: agent: could not reeall who was. present, the case agent.
recalled that Menchel led the meeting, which occtirred whiléthe litigation was Still pending:

‘Even.after the NPA-two-year'state plea resolution:was presented to the: defense, Villafafia
continued to press. ‘ahead to have the court resolwe'the issue concerning the defense production of
the: computer equipment. On. August 1.0, '2007,, she.asked Lourie for authorization. to oppose:
Epstein’s ¢fforts to.stay the litigation until after an anticipated mecting ‘between’ the USAO and the
defense, informing Lourie that a’victim. interviewed that week claimed she started secing Epstein
at-age 1-4 and had been photographed in the nude. A-few days later, Villafafia told defense counsel.
that she: had “conferred with the appropriate people, and we:are not. willing to agree to a stay.”
Defense counsel, then contacted Lourie, who agreed,.to: postpone the hearing: until, after the
upcoming :mecting with Acosta. After the mecting, ‘and when the: court sought to reschedule the:
hearing, Villafafia emailed, Sloman ‘to ask ‘if she: should “put. it off’; he replied, “Yes,” and. the:
hearing, was re-set for September 18,2007. As negotiations towards the: NPA progressed,
however, the hearing was:postponed indefinitely: Ultimately:the NPA itself put the issue-to: rest:
by. specifying that. all legal process would ‘be held in abeyance unless and. until Epstein, breached
the:agreement.

Villafana told OPR that she:had learned through law enforcement channels that the defense:
team had reviewed the contents of Epstein’s computers. She told,OPR that, in her'view, “the‘facti
that the defense: was trying desperately to put off the hearing ... . was further evidence. of the:
importance of the evidence.”

OPR questioned Acosta about the ‘decisions to initiate, and continue ‘with,, the NPA.
negotiations while ‘the litigation concerning ‘the computers was still pending, and to, agree. to
postpone the litigation rather. than. exhausting: all .cfforts: to: obtain. and review the computer’
evidenée. Acosta-told OPR that he had-no recollection of Villafana’s cffoits-to obtain the missing:
computers, but.:he believed that “there: was: a desire to move quickly as opposed. to slowly”

‘Menchel, Sloman, and Lourie also all. told OPR. that they did not. remember: Villafatia’s:
efforts to obtain the computers or recalled the ‘issue only “vaguely.” Menchel expressed surprise
to OPR. that: a prosecutor could. obtain “an. entire computer” through the method utilized. by
Villafana, telling: OPR,. “I had. not heard of that.” However, the contemporaneous records, show:
that Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie had cach ‘been aware in. 2007 of Villafaia’s efforts to obtain
Epstein’s missing computer equipinient.

Villafatia kept Menchel, in particular, well informed. of her efforts to obtain the computer
equipment. She sent to Menchel, or copied him on, several emails about, her plan, to obtain, the
computer equipment; specifically,, her emails on. May 18} .2007, July. 3, 2007, and July: 16, 2007,
all discussed herproposed steps. Villafana,told.OPR ‘that Lourie was inv volved in cat ‘ly discussions
about-her proposal to: obtain. the evidence. ‘Lourie also received Villafaiia’s July 1.6, ‘2007 email.
discussing the computer equipment:and the plaf to-obtain it, and on one-occasion he spoke directly
