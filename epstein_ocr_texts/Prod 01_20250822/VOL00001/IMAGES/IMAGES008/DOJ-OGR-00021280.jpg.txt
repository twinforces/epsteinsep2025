precluding the government:-from:requesting, initiating, or recommending ‘immigration proceedings
agaifst/the two assistants who were: foreign nationals.

At this: point, Lefkowitz again sought to speak: to Acosta, . who replied by email: cI am.
staff ‘by. allowing « inter locutor{ly’ appeals s¢ so to speak’ so I'd want [MJarie:c on n the. call ] rll have:
her set: something: up.”

Villafana sent: to Lefkowitz her own revised NPA, telling him.it was her “attempt at:
combining « our rthoughts,’ _ but it had not. “been Approv ed by the office yet” She inserted solicitation

plead guilty: proposed ‘a joint recommendation. for a 30- month sentence, ‘divided: ‘nto 18 months
in-the county jail and 12. months of community. control; and amended, the § 2255 provision.”

Villafana’s revision. retained. the provision suspending the inyestigatio on ‘and holding: all legal
process in. abeyance, and she incorporated, the non-prosecution. provision. while slightly altering it:
to apply to * ‘any. ‘potential co-conspirator of Epstein, including” the four named assistants, and
deleting mention. of ‘the :corporate entity employees. Finally, ‘Villafaia deleted. mention of.
immigr ation; proceedings, but. advised. in her transmittal email that “we have not-and don’t‘plan;to

ask immigration” proceedings to be initiated.!”4

Later that:day, Villafania‘alerted Lourie:(who had:arrived in-Florida from. Washington, D.C.
carly that afternoon) and the new. West Palm Beach manager (copying her first-line supervisor and.
‘cO- counsel) that: she had. ‘included language that. defense counsel had. requested * egarding
promises not to prosecute other:people,” and commented, “I don?t think:it hurts us.”” There is no
documentation, that Lourie, the West Palm Beach: manager, or-anyone ¢ls¢ expressed disagreement:
with Villafatia’ S assessment. _Rather, within. a few minutes, Villatatia re-sent ther email, adding,
Lourie responded, “Nov way. “We don’t put that sort of thing ina ‘aplea agreement.” Villafania replied
to Loutie; indicating she would. pass that. along to defense: counsel and. adding, “any other
thoughts?” When Lourie gave no further response, Villafaiia:informed defense counsel.that Lourie:
had réjectéd the proposed immigration language.

OPR questioned the subjects about the USA©’s agreement.not to prosecute “any. potential.
co- conspirators.” Lourie did. not:recall why the USAO agreed to it, but he speculated-that.he lett
that provision inthe NPA: because he'believed at:the'time that it:benefited'the government:in some:
way. In particular, Lourie conjectured that, ‘the prontise not. to prosecute “any potential,
co-conspirators” protected victims who had. recruited others and. thus ‘potentially were:
co-conspirators in Epstein’s scheme. Louric.also told.OPR, “bet the answer was that we weren’t;
going to.charge™Epstein’s accomplices, because.Acosta “didn’t reallywant fo charge‘Epstein” in

Ts Villafafia.noted that she/had, consulted with:a USAO employee;who was:a “former corporate counsel from a,
hospital” about the § 2255 language, ‘and ‘thought‘that the revised-language “addresses the concern about having’ an
unlimited number of-claimed victims. without.me;trying to bind girls who'ldo-not:represent.”

im Villafafia.gave‘OPR an:explanation similar to thatigiven,by‘the case;agents—that an ]@E Special. Agent had.
beet anvolved in the carlystagés of the federal investigation of Epstein, aiid Villafana believed theagent knew two of.
Epstein’s female assistants were-foreign-nationals and, would have acted appropriately’on ‘that:information; Villafana;
‘also Said that:the CSA O'generally didnot: gctinvolyed in-immigration issucs.
