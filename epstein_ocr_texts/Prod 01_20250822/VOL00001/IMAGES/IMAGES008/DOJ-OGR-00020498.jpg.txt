related civil litigation. The Government labors under many restrictions

(Signed by: Judge Alison.J./Nathan on 7/30/2020)(bw) (Entered: 07/3 1/2020)

‘MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have

asked for the Court to, enter a protective order. While they agree on mostiof the
language, two areas of dispute have emerged, First,. Ms. Maxwell secks language’
allowing her to- ‘publicly: reference: alleged: ‘victims or witnesses ‘who have spoken on

the public: record to:the media or in: ‘public ‘fora, or in. litigation:relating-to Ms. Maxwell

or Jeffrey. Epstein. Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential
Government witnesses and their counsel. from using discov ery materials for’any

‘purpose other than:preparing for the criminal trial. in:this action. The Government has
proposed contrary language. on both. ofthese, issues. For the following reasons, the

Court adopts the Government's proposed;protective order Under’ Federal Rule of
Criminal Rrocedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t- any time the court-may, for good.cause, deny,

‘restrict, or defer discovery: ‘or inspection, or:grantsother appropriate relief.” The good

Cause standard “requires, courts to balance several interests, including’ whether
dissemination of the discovery materials‘inflicts hazard‘to others... _ whether the
imposition. of the protective: order would prejudice:the defendant," ‘and "the public's

‘interest in-the information.” United, States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, ‘522

(S.D.N-¥:. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing

good.cause. Cf. Gambale:v. Deutsche Bank AG; 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004).
First, the Court finds:that the Government has met.its burden. of showing good.cause.
‘with regard to restricting the ability’ of Ms: Maxiwell:to publicly refererice ‘alleged.
‘victims and/witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this.

litigation. As a general matter, it:is'undisputed that there is a str ong and specific
interest in: ‘protecting the. privacy‘of alleged:victims and:witnesses in this: case that
Slipports sesteicting the: disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging
counsel, and others on ‘the defen: eteam from disclosing. or “disseminating ‘the identity
of'any-alleged.victim or ‘potential witness referenced:in | the discovery materials" ); see
also United States 'v. Corley, No. 13- ct-48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 15,'2016). ‘The Defense argues ‘this interest:is significantly diminished
for individuals who. have spoken’ on the public record about.Ms. Maxwell or Jetfrey

Epstein, because they have'voluntarily’ chosen:to identify themselves. But not all

accusations or‘public statements are equal. Deciding to participate’in or contribute toa
criminal inv estigation or prosecution: is'a far different-matter than simply making a

‘public statement "relating to” Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since. sucha

Statenient might have occured : ‘decades ago and .have-no, relevance to the. charges in

‘this case. These individuals still maintain, a: significant privacy interest that must be

safeguarded. The. exception the!Defense secks'is too broad and risks under: mining the

‘protections ‘ofthe priv acy of witnesses and alleged victims 'that.is ‘required by law. In

contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms. Maxwell to, publicly

reference individuals who have spoken, by: name on, the record in this case, ‘It/also

allows the Defensc'to ' 'referenc[e] the identities of individuals they’ believe:may: be
felevant!;. to. Potential Defense. Witnesses and their counsel diifing the course of the.

‘investigation and preparation of the defense case. at trial." Dkt. No, 33-1,.5. This

proposal adequately balances the-interests at stake. .And.as the Gov ernment's letter
notes, see Dkt. No. 33 at.4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception.to the.
protective order

Of'a Specific, investigative purpose, they can make applications to the
Court ona case— by- case: basis., Second, ‘restrictions on the ability. of potential,

‘witnesses and.thcir counsel. to ‘use:discov ery materials for purposes other than
‘preparing for trial. inthis case:are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented,

despite the fact'that'there have been many high-profile criminal, matters that had
including Rule
of the Federal:Rules of Criminal Procedure, the:Priv acy'Act of 1974, and other

‘policies of the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern
District of New York, all.of which the Court expeets.the Government to scrupulously

follow. Furthermore, ‘the Gover nment-indicates that it will likely only: provide potential.
witnesses with:materials that those-witnesses already have-in. their possession. See Dkt.

No. 33 at 6. Aid ofcourse, those/witnesses who do 'téstify'at trial Wwould.bé subject to

examination on the record as to what’materials were. ‘provided-or shown to them by the
Government. Nothing ‘in the-Defense!s papers explains how ‘its unprecedented

‘proposed restriction. is somehow : necessary: to ensure a fair-trial. For the foregoing
reasons, the Court; adopts the ‘Government's: proposed protective order, ‘which will be
