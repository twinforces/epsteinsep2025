Deputy Attorney General ‘Filip: told. OPR he ‘had ‘never heard of Epstein before: receiving,

an experienced, senior. federal prosecutor’ who had served. some years before: as ‘an .AUSA. in. the.
USAO. Roth also told OPR:that he had never before heard of Epstein. Roth explained to OPR.

General ‘to: review the Epstein. case de novo or to.examine'the NRA’s terms or determine: whether

and we didn’t give! ehim [any] relief” ‘Deputy Attorney General Filip told OPR.that.no one :in his
office who looked at-Epstein’s arguinents “felt-that it was a sympathetic: appeal: ” In particular; he
told OPR. that: defense counsel’s : argument: that there was no basis for a federal. prosecution was
“ludicrous,” and the assertion that the USAO’s. investigation, of Epstein was:politically motivated
“‘just-seemed unserious.”
