successful federal prosecution, Acosta prematurely decided to resolverthe case. withoutiadequately
addressing ways::in. which a federal case potentially could have been strengthened, such as: by
obtaining Epstein’ ‘S missing computer. equipment. Finally, a lack:of coordination within the USAO
coiipounded Acosta’s flawed reasoning and resulted in-insufficient oversight over the. process of,
‘drafting the NPA,.‘a. unique document. that required more detailed attention and. review, than it.
potentially a federal plea agreement, existed as viable. alternatives to the NPA resolution.

In evaluating Acosta’s conduct, OPR has considered and ‘taken into account the fact that:
some: of Epstein’s conduct:known today. was not:known.in 2007 and that other circumstances have
changed. in. the. interim, including ‘some. victims’ willingness. to ‘testify. OPR. has: also, evaluated
Acosta’s decisions in a framework that. recognizes and allows for decisionsthat:are made in. good
faith, even if the decision in question may fot have led.to the “best” result that-potentially could
have been. obtained. Nonetheless, after considering all. of the available evidence and the: totality
of the-then-existing. circumstances, ‘OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poorjtidgiient in that he

chosevan action or course of action that was‘in.marked.contrast to that which'the Department would.
reasonably, expect, of’an attorney exercising: good judgment.

A. _ Acosta’s Decision to: Resolve the Federal Investigation through a State ‘Plea.
under Terms Incorporated into the NPA Was, Based. on a Flawed. Application
‘of ‘the Petite Policy. and Federalism. Concerns, and Failed to Consider the
Significant Disadvantages of a State-Based Resolution

The: Department. formulated the. Petite policy. in. response to a series of Supreme Court:
opinions holding that'the Constitution does not deny state and federal, governments the-power'to
prosecute forthe same act. Responding to the Court’s concerns about:the “potential. for, abuse in.
a rule permitting duplicate: prosecutions,” “the Department voluntarily adopted a‘policy of declining:
to bri ing a federal: prosecution: following: a completed state:prosecution.for the same conduct, except
wheil necessary to advance a compelling’ federal interest. Sée Rinaldiv. United, States, 434. U.S.
at:28.. On. its face, the Petite policy applies: tofederal prosecutions that follow completed state:
prosectitions., USAM -§ 9-2.031 (This policy applies whenever there has been, a prior state.
prosecution resulting. i insan acquittal,,a conviction, including,one resulting from a plea agreement,
oradisinissal of othertetimination of the case on the ierits after jeopar ‘dy has.attached.”), Whei.
a state inv estigation’ or prosecution is still pending, the policy does not apply. Indeed, even when
a state prosecution.has:resulted in, a/decision, on-the merits, the policy permits a subsequent:federal.
prosecution when ‘three ‘substantive prerequisites are satisfied: a “substantial federal interest”
exists, “the result in the prior state prosecution. was manifestly inadequate in. light of*the federal.
interest. involved,” and there ‘is sufficient adniissible evidence to obtait and ‘sustain, a ‘conviction,
on, federal charges. The policy also does :not.apply when. “the prior prosecution ‘involved orlly..a
minor partof the contemplated federal charges.”

No oné with whom ‘OPR spoke disputed ‘that! the federal government had, a substantial.
interest-in prosecuting Epstein. In.her prosecution memorandum, Villafana identified five federal,
statutes that Epstein. ‘had potentially violated. The CEOS Chief described Villafatia?s assessment:
of these statutes as “exhaustive,” and. he: concurred with her analysis of their applicability to’ the.
facts of the case. Epstein’s crimes: involved the sexual exploitation of children, ‘interstate travel,
and the use of a facility of interstate commerce, all, of which were areas of federal concern.
