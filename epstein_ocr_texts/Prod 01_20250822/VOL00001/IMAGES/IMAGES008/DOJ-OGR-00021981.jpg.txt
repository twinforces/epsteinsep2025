1 MS. DONALESKI: That's fine for the government, your

2 Honor.

3 THE COURT: How long do you expect the trial to last?
4 MR. FOY: Your Honor, I would say it's fine. I mean,
5 as it looks right now, but based on some of the things I'm

6 anticipating, I don't know if that would be enough time and

7 maybe we want to wait and see, because I need to see the

8 discovery before I can say definitively that, yes, April 20 is
9 an appropriate date. But for now certainly that would be fair.
10 THE COURT: We're told that the discovery consists of
11 video and documents. I don't understand why you can't

12 anticipate whether you can go forward on the 20th.

13 MR. FOY: Because I haven't seen what those documents
14 are and what impact it might have on the defense of the case as
15 well as my thoughts on some additional documents that may go

16 beyond what they believe Rule 16 requires. I can imagine a

17 situation where we feel that there's more to be provided than
18 what the government provides. We're not there yet, so I'm not
19 suggesting that it's definitely going to be an issue, but I did
20 want to alert the Court early on of the possibility. But once
21 I get the discovery, I'll be in a position to say more
22 affirmatively.
23 THE COURT: What else are you expecting?
24 MR. FOY: You mean as far as discovery?
25 THE COURT: Youtre talking in vague terms about
