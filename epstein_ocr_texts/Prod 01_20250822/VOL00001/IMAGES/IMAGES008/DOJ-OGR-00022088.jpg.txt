Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 26 of 34

2d 1, 9 (D-D.C. 2006), required the prosccutors to obtain, records from, the: Office of the Vice
President and the Central Intelligence Agency, even though. those ‘parts of government did not.
participate in-the grand jury investigation, that-holding was.an outlicr, which has never been cited
by another court, and, the decision itself has never been cited in this Circuit.

Finally, évenfsuch materials had.any conceivable rélevance to the charges at hand (which,
as discussed above, they do not), asking the Government to conduct.a broad. canvassing of. the:
BOP’s records—ineluding searching databases located, out. of state, reviewing large quantitics of
documents, attempting to pull archived rceéords going. back as.:far as.2005, and parsing through.
attorncy work: product—would be inordinately time consuming and burdensome for attorneys for
the Government, which docs not. have custody‘of the files, is not familiar with. the files, and. knows
of no effective way to search-them. .It would, as the Circuit warned against in.Avellino, “condemn.
the prosecution of ‘criminal, cases to a state of paralysis.” 136 F.3d.at.255. Such.a result. is not.
legally required by Rule 16,.Brad\, or Giglio, and'therefore: Thomas’s motion should. be denied.

including purported staffing shortages atthe MCC. (Mot. 5,9-10). Forthe reasons set forth.above,
any: draft Inspector General. Report is not: discoverable; because the issues Thomas believes it will
discuss are not matcrial to the preparation. of'a valid. defense, see Part II.B,:and. the draft reports,
to'the extent they exist, are’protected.from disclosure by the deliberative’ process privilege. While
the prosecution. team has had no involvement in writing ‘the Inspector General Report, the
Government understands that those attorneys from. DOJ-OIG :responsible: for writing. the Report

have: not yet: completed a, draft, and do not anticipate completing the ‘Report in. the near‘term. As
