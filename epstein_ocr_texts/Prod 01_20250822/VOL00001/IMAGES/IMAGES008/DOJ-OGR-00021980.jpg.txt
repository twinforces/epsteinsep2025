1 in that report, so if we could get some -- if they have any

2 idea as to when that's going to conclude, I do believe that

3 that may have some impact in terms of information that we

4 desire to have as well as I do believe that we're also going to
5 be subpoenaing some documents as well. But I don't think we

6 would need more than the end of January, presumably, to have an
7 idea to convey to the Court where we are with respect to moving
8 forward with motions.

9 MS. DONALESKI: Your Honor, we'll provide the

10 discovery in our possession to the defendants by the end of

11 December. I don't know of a basis to hold up a criminal case
12 based on a DOJ inspector general report, and I don't have a

13 time line of when that will be completed.

14 MR. FOY: Your Honor, I agree that by the end of

15 January we should be in a position to assess what motions, if
16 any, will be necessary. We'll also be in a position to

17 determine whether there are any issues regard to discovery or
18 additional information at that point.

19 MR. FIGGINS: And your Honor —-—
20 THE COURT: One moment, please.
21 You'll return to court on January 30 at 11 a.m. -—-
22 that will be a control date -- and you'll let me know whether
23 you expect to file motions.
24 Now, with respect to a trial date, April 20.
25 MR. FIGGINS: That's fine for us.
