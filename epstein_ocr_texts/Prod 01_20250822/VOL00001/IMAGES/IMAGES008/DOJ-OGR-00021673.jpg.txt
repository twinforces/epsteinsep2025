ARGUMENT
POINT |
The District Court Correctly Concluded That
Jeffrey Epstein’s Non-Prosecution Agreement
Does Not Bar Maxwell’s Prosecution in the
Southern District of New York

In 2007, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern
District of Florida entered into a non-prosecution
agreement with Jeffrey Epstein. Maxwell argues that
this agreement, which neither she nor the U.S. Attor-
ney’s Office for the Southern District of New York
signed, nevertheless bars her prosecution in the
Southern District of New York in this case, and she
twice sought dismissal of the charges in the Indict-
ment on that ground. The District Court denied the
motions to dismiss, correctly recognizing that Max-
well’s argument is precluded by the text of the agree-
ment and this Court’s longstanding precedent. Accord-
ingly, this Court should affirm the denial of the mo-
tions to dismiss.
