sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault,
and that this experience would not affect their ability
to serve fairly and impartially as a juror in the case.
(A.344-45; Voir Dire Tr.18, 52, 200, 207, 259, 293, 532,
538-39, 635). Each confirmed that he or she could be
fair and impartial, and defense counsel did not move
to strike any these jurors for cause based on their answer
to Question 48. (A.345).

For instance, one juror said that she was “sexually
molested by an uncle when she was 12 or 18,” but that
would not affect her ability to be fair and impartial in
the case. (A.345). Another juror indicated that she had
recently “reported that a friend was being coerced and
sexually abused by a professor,” but confirmed that ex-
perience would not “in any way interfere with her abil-
ity to be fair and impartial” in this case. (/d.). Neither
the Government nor defense counsel challenged those
jurors for cause.

The parties then exercised their peremptory
strikes, and a jury was seated.

2. Juror 50

Juror 50 completed the questionnaire and was
questioned by Judge Nathan during voir dire. In his
questionnaire, Juror 50 repeatedly made clear that he
could be fair and impartial. In response to Question 13,

12 Twelve of the 58 qualified prospective jurors in-
dicated that a friend or family member had been a vic-
tim of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, or sexual as-
sault.
