‘with this Couit's December 7, 2020:Ordeér, sce, Dkt. No. 89. Thé Government did not file,
any opposition to the Defendant's proposed redactions..A fier due-consideration, ‘the Court
‘will adopt’ the: Defendant's proposed redactions. The Court's decision to adopt those
‘redactions is guided by the three-part testarticulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch.v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435. F.3d 110. (2d. Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must:
(1) determine whether ‘the documents ‘in question are, "judicial documents;” (11) assess ‘the
weight of the-common law presumption of aceess'to thematerials; and: (iii) balance

competing, considerations ‘against the presumption.of- access. Id. at 11.920. "Such

countervailing factors include but-arenot limited, to the danger ofampairing law
‘enforcement or, judicial efficiency’ and.'the privacy interests of those:resisting

disclosure: Id. at 120 (quoting ‘United States v. Amodco, 7, F3d. 1044, 1048 (2d
'Cit.1995) C"Atiiodéo II")). The; proposed redactions satisty this’ test. The'Court finds that
‘Defendant's letter:motions are “relevant to’ the performance of the judicial :function.and
‘useful in the judicial process,’ thereby qualifying asa "judicial, document" for purposes of
‘the. first clement ofthe Lugosch ‘test. United States-v. Amodco ("Amodeo I"), 44. F-3d

141, 145 :(2d.Cir. 1995)..And the Court also finds that the:common.law presumption.of:

access attaches. Id. at 146; séé also Nixon ¥. Warner Comme’ nis, Ine.; 435 U.S: 589, 602

(1978). Nevertheless, in balancing competing considerations against'the:presumption of

access, the Court finds that the redactions ‘are'narrowly tailored to: properly guard the:
privacy interests of thé individuals referenced in. the. Defendant's Submission and in the

corresponding exhibits The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to- docket the redacted

docuiments and, cor responding exhibits. (Signed, by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
