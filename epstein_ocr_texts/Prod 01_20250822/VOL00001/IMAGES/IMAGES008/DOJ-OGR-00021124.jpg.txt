2005). But neither decision cited Landgraf; purported to follow its two-step
framework; or examined §3283’s legislative history. Instead, both decisions simply
assumed that a criminal statute of limitations can be applied retroactively absent an
Ex Post Facto problem under Stogner. See Leo Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at 924;
Jeffries, 405 F.3d at 685. But see Richardson, supra.
C. Count Six is also barred by the Statute of Limitations

Count Six (2001-2004) charging §1591 is also time-barred because the 2003
amendment to §3283 cannot be applied retroactively under Landgraf for the
reasons stated above. In addition, $3299 cannot be applied retroactively. In 2006,
Congress enacted §3299 to eliminate the limitations period for §1591. But since
the sex trafficking in Count Six predates the enactment of §3299, Count Six is
time-barred unless the statute applies retroactively. Landgraf’s “presumption
against statutory retroactivity” forecloses retroactive operation of this statute at
step two as the Government has conceded elsewhere. 511 U.S. at 293. see U.S. v.
Schneider, C.A. No. 10-29, 2010 WL 3656027, at *1 n.1 (E.D. Pa. Sept. 15, 2010)
citing U.S. v. Richardson, 512 F.2d 105 (3d Cir. 1975). Accordingly, Count Six is
time-barred.
