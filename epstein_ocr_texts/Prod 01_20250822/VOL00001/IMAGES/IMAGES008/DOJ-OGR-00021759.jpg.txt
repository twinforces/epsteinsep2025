C. The Court’s Failure to Hold a Hearing on the Scope of the Non-
Prosecution.Agreement is an Error.

What is significant with regard. to 'this isstie is'the lack of a. sufficient record.
Given. that the District Court ignored the plain language of the co-conspirator clause
together with the corroborating evidence from the OPR that establishes that that
language was, changed to ‘remove, rather than add words of limitation, the District
Court’s decision, to apply Annabi’s rule of construction without a hearing was an.
from defense counsel.as to 'their'understanding of the agreement and, in.the absence
of such information, the District: Court was obligated to resolve any ambiguities in

favor of Ms. Maxwell.

The. Government argues that, based, upon. Annabi, there is no need for a

evidentiary hearings where the scope. of an.agreement is in dispute. The failure to
hold a hearing precluded Ms. Maxwell from offering evidence as to the intent and
understanding of defense counsel; as a result, the Court did, not construe the NPA
against the Government, as the law requires, but against Ms. Maxwell. See United

States v. Difeaux, 163 F.3d. 725, 728 (2d Cir. 1998). A reviewing court must read the
