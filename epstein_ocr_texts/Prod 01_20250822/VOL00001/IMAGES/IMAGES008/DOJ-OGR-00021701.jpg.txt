remained subject to indictment in 2007,
once the changes were made. A dead
charge was not resurrected, and the un-
derlying nature of [defendant’s] potential
criminal liability remained the same.
United States v. Piette, 45 F.4th 1142, 1161-62 (10th
Cir. 2022). The decisions of other Courts of Appeals are
in accord. Sure Chief, 438 F.3d at 922-25; Jeffries, 405
F.3d at 685.

Maxwell cites United States v. Richardson, 512
F.2d 105 (8d Cir. 1975), and two district court deci-
sions that are bound to follow it. (Br.58-59). But Rich-
ardson, which was decided before Landgraf, is “incon-
sistent with Landgraf.” United States v. Nader, 425 F.
Supp. 3d 619, 630 (E.D. Va. 2019). Specifically, Rich-
ardson focused on whether Congress expressed a
“clear intention” to overcome the presumption against
retroactivity, 512 F.2d at 106, without engaging in
Landgraf ’s second step, i.e., considering whether the
statute “would have retroactive effect,” Landgraf, 511
U.S. at 280. Moreover, unlike the 2003 amendment,
the statute at issue in Richardson did not expressly
provide that “[n]o statute of limitations that would
otherwise preclude prosecution” of the relevant offense
“shall preclude” prosecution under the terms of the
amended statute.

In sum, the statute of limitations for the charges in
the Indictment had not yet expired when the 20038
amendment to Section 3283 extended the limitations
period, and Judge Nathan correctly determined that
applying the 2003 amendment in this case does not
create impermissible retroactive effects. Therefore,
