promise equates to the imposition ofa gag order. Our Office cannot.
anid will not agree-to this.

It is the intent of this Office to treat.this matter like anyother case.

Acosta.told OPR. that this:was a polite: way of chastising Lefkowitz for mischaracterizing,
what Acosta said during the breakfast mecting. Although OPR could not find evidence that the
letter was sent'to Lefkowitz, OPR.nonctheless considers:it ‘persuasive evidence.that Acosta, shortly
after the breakfast: necting, disagreed with Lefkowitz’s description of their discussions and, had
discussed. those disagreements with. Sloman.

the: October: 23 letter, to determine whether evidence reflected ‘that. Acosta had. made them “during
the breakfast meeting. First, Lefkowitz claimed that Acosta, agreed during the breakfast mecting:
that he did not intend to ‘interfere with. the ‘state’s ‘handling of the case. Contemporaneous
documents show that-well before the breakfast. mecting, Acosta had expressed ’the view that-he did
not want to “dictate” actions to the State Attorney or. the state: court. For ‘example, during the NPA.
fiegotiations,. Acosta asked Villafana.to “soften” certain language that appeared to ‘require'the State
Attorney’s Office: or the state: court'to take specific actions, such-as-requiring that:Epstein enter‘his
guilty plea or report to begin serving his’ sentence by'a certain date. Although Acosta may have
made a statement during the breakfast meeting expressing his disinclination to interfere with the:
state’s ‘proceedings, ‘such a'statement: would. have ‘been a reiteration. of his prior position on. the:
subject, rather than any new concession.

Lefkowitz also claitied. in his October 23, 2007 letter that Acosta agreed notto contact any
of the victims or. potential witnesses: or their. counsel. For the reasons: discussed. more fully. in
Chapter Three, OPR coficludes thatthe decision. notte notify the Victims: about the NPA did. not
stem. from the breakfast. mecting, but ‘rather ‘reflected an: assessment of multiple issues. and.
considerations discussed. internally by the subjects who: participated in that decision: Acosta,

Finally, Letkowitz’s October 23 letter suggested that Acosta, had agreed. not'to intervene
regarding, the sentence: Epstein. received from. the state: court, and. it asserted. that Epstein was
“entitled to attytype of sentence available to him, including: but not limited to gain time: and work:
release.” Later communications between the USAO and defense counsel, however, show. clearly
that Acosta-did not abandon the NPA’S explicit sentencing provision., The NPA: fequited Epstein
to make ‘a joint recommendation with ‘the ‘State Attorney’s ‘Office: for an: 1.8-month jail. sentence,
although: the parties understood that he would receive the, saine “gain tine” benefits available to
all state: inmates. After the October breakfast. mecting, Sloman and. Villafafia, on, behalf. of, the.
USAO, repeatedly. made: clear that:it would holdEpstein to that requirement, and ‘the USAO also
subsequently insisted that Epstein was incligible for work release. For example, in.a November 5,
2007 letter, Sloman requested confirmation.from defense counsel that “Epstein. intends to abide’by
his agreement. to plead guilty to the specified:charges and to‘ntake a binding recommendation that
the: Court impose a sentence of £8 months of continuous confinement in.the. county. jail.” ‘Shortly
before Epstein entered his pleat in June: 2008, Villafana; wrote to the State Attorney’to remind him.
that the NPA ‘required Epstein to: plead in‘state court to an offense that required an .18-month.
