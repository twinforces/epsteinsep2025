03/09/2022 639 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. As indicated at yesterday's hearing, the Court has
docketed the unredacted copy of the Court's February 24, 2022, Opinion & Order, the
Government's proposed questions, the Defendant's proposed questions with limited.
redactions, the signed immunity order with limited redactions, and Hearing Exhibit 1.

questions are narrowly tailored to further the interest of protecting juror anonymity. The
Court will file the unredacted documents under seal. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 3/9/22)(jbo) (Entered: 03/09/2022)

03/10/2022 640 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Per the Court's instruction at the March 8 hearing, the
parties submitted revised redactions to their briefing on the Defendants motion for a new
trial. The Court rejects the Defendant's proposed redaction to page 8, lines 6-7 of her
reply because it is not necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity and
privacy. See Dkt. No. 607. The Court concludes that the remaining proposed redactions
are narrowly tailored to further the important interest of protecting juror anonymity and
privacy. Press-Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464 U.S. 501, 511-12
(1984). The parties are ORDERED to file the redacted briefs (with the above noted line
unredacted) on the docket on or before March 11, 2022. The Court will file the
unredacted briefs under seal. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/10/2022)qGw)
