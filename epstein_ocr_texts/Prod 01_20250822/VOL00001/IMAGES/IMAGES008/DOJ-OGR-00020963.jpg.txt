-yes friend.or‘family; or no.” Jd. at 15,.2:1. Gonsistent-with his explanation:that he skimmed the:
questionnaire, he testified thathe “did:not pick up on” that:pattern;when filling out the
questionnaire, id. at 15, and.read.only “the:ffiend or-family” and. “missed that *have;you,’ and,
‘then. *yes self? while:reading,” Question 48, id. at.2:1. And-when asked.a ‘follow-up question,.
Juror 50-said he;was not “surprised” ‘at the time, but only surprised “thinking:now” that the
questionnaire had asked about the sexual abuse history of friends and family’but not about a.
juror’s own sexual. abuse history. /d. at 21-22. The Court .finds that Juror 502s answers ‘to each

49'as‘he “flew through’*the questionnaire. Hearing Tr. at: 1 1—12. .At the hearing, ’he ‘initially.
stated that “No” was an accurate answer because; as the:Defendant notes, he'“never considered”
the stepbrother'to be a member of lis family. Jd. And. finally, when. asked whether, “[a]s [he]

“yes” because “by: law, by:marriage, that person. was: [his] ‘stepbrother.” Jd. at: 12-13. In.short, it
