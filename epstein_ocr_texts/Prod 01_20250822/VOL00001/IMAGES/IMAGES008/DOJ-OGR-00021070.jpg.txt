Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page23 of 113.

1. The NPA immunized Maxwell from prosecution, for all counts. Maxwell has:
standing to enforce the NPA as a. third-party beneficiary. The “potential co-
conspirators” provision. binds the USAO-SDNY by its express terms. Hence, the
canon of construction enunciated in United States:v. Annabi, 771. F.2d 670 (2d Cir.
1985), that’ “[a] plea agreement binds only the office of the United States Attorney
for the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the
agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” is. inapplicable here. /d. at 672.
But even if the immunity provision was ambiguous, which it is not, Annabi should.
not apply here because (1) the NPA originated ina district outside this circuit with.
different rules that should control;. (2). Annabi applies only if, the new charges are
sufficiently distinct and Count Six is not; (3) Annabi applies only where'there is ‘no
affirmative indication that the agreement was intended to ‘bind other districts and.
there were affirmative: indications. here; and (4) Annabi is a tiebreaking rule for
ambiguous agreements which, should be used only after an evidentiary hearing
determines the intent of the parties. Here, the court refused to grant discovery:or a.

hearing, on this issue.

2. The convictions are time-barred. Section 3283 does not extend the statute.of
limitations for violations of §. 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same, because, the

“sexual or physical abuse...of'a child” is nota necessary element of those offenses.
