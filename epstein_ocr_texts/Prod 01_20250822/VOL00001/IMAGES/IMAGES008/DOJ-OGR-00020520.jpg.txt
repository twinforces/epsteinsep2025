‘Proposed :Redactions. ENDORSEMENT: ‘The Court ‘grants the Government's
‘redaction. requests. Its conclusion.is guided by the three— part test articulated by: the
Second Circuit in Luigosch v:. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir, 2006).
‘Under'this fest, the Court, must: (i) determine whether ‘the documents in question.are:

"judicial. documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access
to the materials; and (iii)’balance competing considerations against.the presumption of
access. Id. at 11920. The, Court conclirdes:that these, are judicial doctimenits and that
the First Amendment and:common law presumptions of access attach. But:in,balancing
compcting considerations against.the presumption of access, the Court:finds that'the
specific arguments the Government:has: put forward in this letter, including theneed to
protect the j privacy interests of third partics-referenced in the documents, favor the
narrowly tailored.redactions. See"United States v. Amodco, 7.1 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d.
Cir. 1995). The Defendant and.Boies Schiller are:hereby' ORDERED to docket'the
