Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene
Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated April 23, 2021 re:
Proposed Redactions. ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants the Government's
redaction requests. Its conclusion is guided by the three—part test articulated by the
Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).
Under this test, the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question are
"judicial documents;" (11) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access
to the materials; and (111) balance competing considerations against the presumption of
access. Id. at 11920. The Court concludes that these are judicial documents and that
the First Amendment and common law presumptions of access attach. But in balancing
competing considerations against the presumption of access, the Court finds that the
specific arguments the Government has put forward in this letter, including the need to
protect the privacy interests of third parties referenced in the documents, favor the
narrowly tailored redactions. See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d
Cir. 1995). The Defendant and Boies Schiller are hereby ORDERED to docket the
respective documents with the Government's proposed redactions by April 23, 2021.
SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/23/2021) (Inl) (Entered:

04/23/2021 | 242 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 22, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
filed her response to the Court's April 21, 2021 Order, Dkt. No. 221, under temporary
seal with proposed redactions. The proposed redactions are GRANTED. The Court's
conclusion is guided by the three—part test articulated by the Second Circuit in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test,
the Court must: (i) determine whether the documents in question are "judicial
documents;" (ii) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the
materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against the presumption of
access. Id. at 11920. The Court concludes that these are judicial documents and that
the First Amendment and common law presumptions of access attach. In balancing
competing considerations against the presumption of access, however, the Court finds
that the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of
defense lawyers' clients in other matters and to allow defense counsel to comply with
their professional obligations under the rules of professional conduct. The Defendant is
ORDERED to docket the redacted version of her letter by April 23, 2021. The
Defendant is further ORDERED to docket the basis for the redaction request,
originally sent by email, on ECF by April 23, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge

2021 re: Response to Dkt. No. 227, Governments April 21, 2021 Letter re Ms.
Maxwell's Motions to Suppress. ENDORSEMENT: The Court agrees with the
position set forth in this letter that, unless the Government agrees to forgo any use of
the documents subject to the motions to suppress at trial on the non—perjury counts,
the Court must resolve those motions prior to that trial. The Court will resolve the
motions in due course. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
