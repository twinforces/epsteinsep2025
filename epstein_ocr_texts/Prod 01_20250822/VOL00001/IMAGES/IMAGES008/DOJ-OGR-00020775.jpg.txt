However, it also concludes that even if the statute were ambiguous, it would properly apply to
these charges.

At Lanfgraf’s second step, the Court asks whether application of the statute to past
conduct would have impermissible retroactive effects. “[A] statute has presumptively
impermissible retroactive effects when it ‘takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under
existing laws, or creates a new obligation, imposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in
respect to transactions or considerations already past.’” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 56 (quoting
Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 290). Thus, applying a new statute of limitations to previously time-
barred claims has an impermissible retroactive effect. Enter. Mortg. Acceptance Co., LLC, Sec.
Litig., 391 F.3d at 407. Applying it to conduct for which the statute of limitations has not yet
expired does not. Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. Sch. Dist., 49 F.3d 886, 890 (2d Cir. 1995).

Maxwell concedes that these offenses were within the statute of limitations when
Congress enacted the PROTECT Act. Thus, the Act did not deprive her of any vested rights.
Maxwell contends that it is unfair to allow the Government to prosecute her now for conduct that
occurred more than twenty years ago, but there is no dispute that Congress has the power to set a
lengthy limitations period or no limitations period at all. It has done so here, judging that the
difficulty of prosecuting these offenses and the harm they work on children outweighs a
defendant’s interest in repose. Maxwell’s fairness argument is a gripe with Congress’s policy
judgment, not an impermissibly retroactive application of the statute. The Court concludes that
§ 3283 allows her prosecution now.

B. The Government’s delay in bringing charges did not violate due process

“As the Supreme Court stated in United States v. Marion, the statute of limitations is ‘the
primary guarantee against bringing overly stale criminal charges.’” United States v. Cornielle,
