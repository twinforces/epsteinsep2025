critical role in those extreme cases where dissatisfied litigants may be tempted to harass or
tamper with jurors in an attempt to impeach the verdict. See Tanner, 483 U.S. at 120-21.

Finally, what is not at issue in resolving this motion is whether the Defendant would have
exercised a peremptory strike against this juror had he accurately disclosed his prior sexual
abuse. Although the Defendant argues in her pre-hearing briefing that she is also entitled to a
new trial because Juror 50’s failure to disclose his history denied her the opportunity to exercise
her peremptory challenges, that is not the law in federal court. Indeed, in making this argument
she cites only decisions that relied on New Jersey state law. Maxwell Br. at 46-47. But the rule
in New Jersey state courts is different than the rule that binds this Court. See State v. Scher, 650
A.2d 1012, 1019-20 (N.J. App. Div. 1994) (explaining that New Jersey’s “rule differs from its
federal counterpart” of McDenough). Under McDonough, a defendant seeking a new trial must
show that “a correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” 464
U.S. at 555-56 (emphasis added). A desire to “wipe the slate clean simply to recreate the
peremptory challenge process” is not enough. /d.; see also Shaoul, 41 F.3d at 816 (concluding
that a defendant failed to satisfy the second prong of McDonough where the defendant “may
certainly exclude such jurors by the use of peremptory challenges, but he has no basis for
arguing that a district court is required to sustain such a challenge for cause’). That difference
arises in part from the fact that “[uJnlike challenges for cause, peremptory strikes are not
constitutionally required.” Torres, 128 F.3d at 43 n.4.
