F.2d 670, 672 (2d Cir. 1985); accord, e.g., United States
v. Prisco, 391 F. App’x 920, 921 (2d Cir. 2010); United
States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998). The
requisite affirmative appearance may be established
by “an express statement” in the plea agreement, or it
may be “inferred from the negotiations between de-
fendant and prosecutor, as well as from statements at
the plea colloquy.” United States v. Russo, 801 F.2d
624, 626 (2d Cir. 1986).

This Court reviews de novo both the denial of a mo-
tion to dismiss an indictment and the interpretation of
a plea agreement. United States v. Montague, 67 F.4th
520, 527 (2d Cir. 2023); United States v. Padilla, 186
F.3d 136, 139 (2d Cir. 1999). This Court reviews for
abuse of discretion a district court’s denial of an evi-
dentiary hearing before ruling on a motion to dismiss.
United States v. Walters, 910 F.3d 11, 22, 28 (2d Cir.
2018); United States v. Greenberg, 835 F.3d 295, 305
(2d Cir. 2016).

C. Discussion

The District Court correctly rejected Maxwell’s ar-
gument that the NPA bars this prosecution. Maxwell
has no right to invoke the protections of the NPA be-
cause she is neither a party to nor a third-party bene-
ficiary of the agreement. But even if Maxwell had
standing under the NPA, it would not bar this prose-
cution because it was plainly intended to bind only the
USAO-SDFL. Thus, Judge Nathan rightly concluded
that under longstanding Second Circuit precedent, the
NPA does not bind USAO-SDNY. Accordingly, this
