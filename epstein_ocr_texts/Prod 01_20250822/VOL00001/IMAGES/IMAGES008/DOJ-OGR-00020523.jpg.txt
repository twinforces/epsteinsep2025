05/03/2021 | 264 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On April 21, 2021, the Court's Chambers received a
letter from counsel for a non—party requesting assurances as to privacy protections for
his client in any filings or proceedings in this case. The letter requests anonymity on
behalf of the client as an alleged victim of a sexual crime. After receiving the letter,
the Court forwarded it to the parties and required the Government to respond to
counsel, which it has done. The Court will take no further action based on the April 21,
2021 letter but will file it under seal to protect the privacy interests of the non—party
asserting that interest. The Government is requested to forward this order to counsel
for the non—party. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/3/21)Gjbo)
(Entered: 05/03/2021)

05/03/2021 | 265 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court has received an exchange of letters that
pertain to an incident that took place on April 24, 2021. Dkt. Nos. 248, 253, 254, 258,
259. Legal counsel for MDC, where Ms. Maxwell is detained pretrial, alleges that her
lawyers violated Bureau of Prisons rules by providing Ms. Maxwell materials at an
in-person attorney—client visit. Dkt. Nos. 254, 259. Ms. Maxwells lawyers
categorically deny the allegations and threaten separate legal action against MDC staff
based on the incident and the accusation. Dkt. Nos. 253, 258. The Court intimates no
views as to whether some other action or process is appropriate or proper in light of
either sides allegations. This Courts obligation in this case, and any other, is to ensure
that the defendant is given an opportunity to meet with her lawyers, engage in
confidential attorney—client communications, and prepare for trial. Mindful of that
obligation, the Court declines to take further action at this time. After receiving the
defenses first letter motion, the Court ordered MDC legal counsel to show cause why
the Court should not grant the requested relief. Dkt. No. 249. The Court then granted
in part defense counsels original request and ordered MDC legal counsel to respond to
certain questions about the April 24, 2021 incident and the procedures in place to
ensure the confidentiality of Ms. Maxwells lawyer-client communications. Dkt. No.
255. Defense counsels current application is that this Court order MDC to turn over
copies of video tapes of the in-person attorney—client visit. Dkt. No. 258. Those video
tapes must be preserved in light of defense counsels preservation letter. Dkt. No. 248,
Ex. C. If Ms. Maxwell or defense counsel are entitled to view or receive copies of
those materials as a matter of law, they should be provided. To the extent defense
counsel is seeking entitlement to those materials from this Court, that application is
denied. The Court has ensured and will continue to ensure that Ms. Maxwell has the
opportunity to meet meaningfully and confidentially with her lawyers in light of all
relevant circumstances and consistent with the treatment of all other detained inmates
in BOP custody. The isolated incident that took place on April 24, 2021, and the
