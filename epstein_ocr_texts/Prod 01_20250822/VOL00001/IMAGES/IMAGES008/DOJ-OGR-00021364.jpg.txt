OPR. asked Villafatia about these emails and about. the tenor. of her. interactions with.
Lefkowitz during the NPA negotiations. and with other. defense attorneys generally. Villafaia,
acknowledged. that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the.
tone of these emails reflected. her personality and her comimitmerit to complete ‘the task’ her
supervisors-had assigned to her:

[I]f'you were to pull all: my ¢-mails' on every case, ‘you. would find.
that:that is how. communicate with people. I’m. a Minnesota girl,

and IJ’prefer not;to: be confrontational until I have to be. And] can,
be when.Lneed.to be. But my instructions from.my supervisors were
to chgage in ‘these fegotiations and’to complete them. So I felt-that.
given. that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the
agreement: and, keeping in. mind the terms that... . our office had.
agreed to,, and do that ‘in.a way that. is civil. So. . although my.
language in, the kind of introductory of prefatoty ¢ communications
with Mr. Lefkowitz was ‘casual and was friendly, when you look at.
‘the. terms. and:when.he would come back to me‘asking: for changes,

my response was always, “No, will not make‘that. change.”

Villafana denied atiy:intention to.keep:the'victiins uninformed about.the NPA of to-provide
an improper benefit for‘Epstein, and she:explained the context of the emails in-question. ‘The.email.
in which Villafana expressed reluctance to “highlight for the jtidge all of the other crimes and all
of theother persons that we:could:charge” was written in:responsc to-a defense proposal:to include
in the federal plea agreement-the parties. Were then considering a promise by the. governinent not!
to prosecute Epstein’s assistants ‘and other employees. Lefkowitz had. proposed. that. the: plea
agreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the:terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the:
initiation of any and all criminal charges which, might otherwise in ‘the future be brought against.
[four named:female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-owned.corporate entity] for:
any criminal charge that. arises out of the ongoing federal, investigation.” Villafana’ told OPR that:
the USAO was:not ‘intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and. was:not aware of anyone else who
could be charged, and thus did. not: oppose the request: not: to prosecute third parties. However,
Villafaita was concerned that:an:over ‘ly ‘detailed federal. plea agreement’ would prompt the.court to
require the government to-provide further-information about the unchar ged. conduct, which might,
lead Epstein to:claim. the: government breached. the agreement by providing information to the.
court-not directly connected to-the charges'to which he was. pleading guilty. Villafafiaswas.not the
only one to express concern. about: how deeply a federal court:might probe' the facts, and:whether
stich probing Would interfere with the ‘viability of a plea agreement, In an, carlier eimail, Lourie
had ‘suggested charging Epstein by ‘complaint. to allow the USAO. more flexibility in plea.
negotiations and avoid the problem:that a court might:not accept a‘plea to a conspiracy. char ge that:
required. dismissal of numerous substantive ‘counts.

As to, Villafaria’s. offer to meet-with Lefkowitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding:issues
in the. NPA negotiation, she explained. to OPR. that she believed. a face-to-face meeting at a
“neutral” location—with “all thé necessary decision makers present or ‘on. call?’— might-facilitate:
completion of the: negotiations, which had.dragged on for some'time.
