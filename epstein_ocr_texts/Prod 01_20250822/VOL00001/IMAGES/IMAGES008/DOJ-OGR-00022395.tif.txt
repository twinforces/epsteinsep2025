1 I'm counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell.
2 MELISSA MADRIGAL: My name is
3 Melissa Madrigal and I'm counsel for Ghislaine
4 Maxwell.
5 TODD BLANCHE: Go ahead.
6 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: And I'm -- I'm
7 Ghislaine Maxwell.
8 TODD BLANCHE: Good morning, Ms. Maxwell.
i) How are you?
10 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Good morning,
11 Mr. Blanche.
12 TODD BLANCHE: Good. Okay. So before we
13 started recording, we met for a few minutes. I
14 introduced myself and we -- we've chatted and now
15 I've told you that we were going on the record. And
16 before we start asking questions, I know that you've
17 been given, by your lawyer, a copy of what's called a
18 proffer agreement.
19 And I just want to spend two minutes
20 making sure that you understand what -- what governs
21 our conversation today. The most important part of
22 this agreement is that this isn't a cooperation
23 agreement, meaning that by you meeting with us today,
24 we're really just meeting, I'm not promising to do
25 anything.
