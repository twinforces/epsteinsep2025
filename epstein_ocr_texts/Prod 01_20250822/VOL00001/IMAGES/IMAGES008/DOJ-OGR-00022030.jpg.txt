Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 33 Filed 04/09/20 Page 7 of 38
This refusal is perplexing and nonsensical because these same government prosecutors presented
the defendant with a consent to search document from the office of the Inspector General. (See
Exhibit C.)

This motion concerns the defense requests for production of documents regarding
important and essential issues in this case. Moreover, the public sphere is replete with
information that the Inspector General of the United States opened an investigation into the
circumstances surrounding the death of Iefitey Epstein. (See article attached as Exhibit D.)

| Additionally, it is undisputed that the Inspector General also conducted an extensive
investigation into inner workings of the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”). The United States Attorney
General, William Barr and the Acting Bureau of Prisons commissioner, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer
both made numerous public statements that the Inspector General was undertaking an in-depth
investigation into the Bureau of Prisons’ policies, procedures, staffing and criminal conduct as a
direct result of the death of Jeffrey Epstein at MCC on August 10, 2019. (See Exhibit D.) This
report is important because the defendant believes that this report will contain information that is
material and relevant to his defense. Moreover, it is the defendant’s assertion that staffing issues,
starfing shortages, supervisory lapses and the enforcement/interpretation of BOP procedures go
to the heart ofhis defense to the government’s criminal allegations.

The government’s response to Mr. Thomas’ discovery request was not detailed and
sunply made a blanket denial without giving Mr. Thomas the respect to state any legal
justification for the denial. Defendant, Thomas, therefore, brings this Motion to Compel, as to
the items originally requested by his counsel. |

Cc. The Inspector General’s Report and Any Other Reports, Documents,

and/or Memoranda Made by Other Federal Agencies Investigating the
Incident Surrounding the Death of Jeffrey Epstein Are Discoverable and
Must Be Produced
