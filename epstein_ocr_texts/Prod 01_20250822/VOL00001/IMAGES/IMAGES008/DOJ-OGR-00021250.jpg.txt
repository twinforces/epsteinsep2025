Sloman also‘told OPR.that he didnot know how. the decision to offer a‘two-year plea offer:
was réachéd, but. he believed that Acosta iiade the decision. based on. recomendations from,
Menchel, Lourie,, and Villatatva. He opined, to OPR. that. the. decision. was: likely: based om an.
assessment by Menchel and Lourie of the litigation risks preseiited by the case.“ Slomvati.added
that he did ‘not know. how a two-year sentence might have related to ‘specific. charges or. to cither
state of federal sentencing auidelines: Lotrie likewise;told OPR he-did-not-tecall how the two-year
term was decided. upon, or by whom, but he speculated that. it. may. have: been. presented ‘by the:
defense as the most. Epstein. would accept, and, that the decision would. have: been. reached, by:
Acosta. following, “extended. consideration,, ‘research, ‘and discussion,” among Acosta, Sloman,
Menchel, Lourie, and. Villafaiia.**

Menchel. told. OPR. that he did not :recall. discussing a. two-year plea deal with Acosta or
who teached the decision that two years was an appropriate setitence., Menchel. also told OPR,
however, that he: recalled: believing that ifthe USAO had filed the contemplated federal charges,
Epstein would, have ‘felt he had “nothing to lose” and “undoubtedly” would have chosen to ‘take
the:case'to trial. Menchel recalled. believing there: was:a real risk: that the USAO might lose at trial,
and i in SO; doing, might cause more trauma ‘to, o they victims, particular ly those who: were reluctant: to
a 2 fair result i in terms of ‘the conduct, ‘1 think. thaty was not the issue. Theis ‘issue ¢-was-whether ‘or r not
if we took this case ‘to ‘trial, would we risk losing: everything,” and “if we... . felt we could Have
gotten more time, we would:have, without having to:press itto theetrial.”

Acosta told OPR that “I.had decided. and endorsed” the: two-year resolution “at some:
point,” and ‘that! it: resulted ‘from “back and forth” discussion “over the course of some: days or a.
week-ortwo.” As noted-carlier in this Report, Acosta viewed the USAO’s role in:this case merely
as a “backstop” tothe state’s prosecution, which:he explained to OPR. was “a polite-way, of saying|,
. *Jencouraging the: state to do a little bit more.[’]” Acosta said ‘that. he understood ‘two: years’
‘imprisonment to have represented the:sentence’Epstein faced:under, one of theroriginal:charges the
PBPD was considering at. the outset of the state investigation.’ Acosta also told OPR that he

the.attormeyfor the government has a.continuing obligation to: assist the court ‘in.
its determimation of; the, sentence to be:imposed: The. prosecutor must:be familiar
with the. guidelines generally‘and with the:specific:g guideline provisions ‘applicable
‘to:his:or her case; In:dischare ‘ging these duties. ‘the attomey: for the government
should... . endeavor'to.cnsure the accuracy “and ‘completeness of: theinformation.
upon which the sentencing-decisions will'be'based.,

M1. ‘TnSlomants;view, Menchel and Lourie were “tworof:the-finest‘trial lawyers” in.the USAO:

8 Lourie noted, that Sloman. and Menchel ‘were “two extraordinarily. experienced, people; in [Acosta’s] front:
Officewwhe Had thiéd ..... gobs aiid vobs Gf caves”

S3 Inscommenting on.OPR*s drattzreport. Acosta’s allorney asserted that'OPR*s-use of Acosta’s quote, * “alittle
bit'more,” “unfairly:minimized” Acosta’s and:the USAG’s efforts to: achieve justice i in this‘case. Acosta’s:attorney’
‘also assértéd that the phrase way “clearly: soft-spoken tinderstatement?” that the terns Obtained were “substatitially’
more oncrous than the states alternative resolution,” :and that Acosta was “clearly*declining the invitation to take’the
State to task.and softepéedaling an-obtiows: distitiction.”

aos OPR, examined ‘this FtiGi aiid Was tnable to! Cerity’ that ‘the: proposed. IWo-year'térm of imprisonment:
corresponded with the charges: that the PBRD considered at, the outsetzof the state investigation‘or, with, thezcharge-in
