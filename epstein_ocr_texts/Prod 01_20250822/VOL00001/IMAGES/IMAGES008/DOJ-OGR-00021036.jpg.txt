said, I don"t neéd répétition of the drguments in ‘thé, papers,
out if there is any additional points you want to make, you're
welcome to.

MR., EVERDE:b: Your Honor, just ene point. I will be
orieéf. Thé goverfiment in its papers makes the argument that
the joackground comméntaéry can't oe relied upon as authdritative
because 1t. 1s not explanatory or interpretative of what the

guideline is. I think ‘that is incorrect.

IA!

t is not. simply a recitation of what Congress ‘was
considering. That. first. séntente or two which talks asout how
this guideline can only oe applied to offenders who represent a
continuing danger to the community is ‘interpretative of what
the guideline is. Zhe title of the guideline is repeat and
dangerous séx offenders. That expldahatory commentary éxplains
how ‘to interpret what. dangerous means: It means: someone who is
continuously dangerous to the community; not someone who's
never been accused of a crime in the 18 plus ‘years since the
crime in this case, and Has hever ‘oé6en accused of re-offending.
So I don"t agree with that. point. This is authoritative
guidance from the Sentencing Commission; and. the Court should
consider it as such. Thank you.

THE, COURT? MS. Moe, do you. want to respond?

MS» MOE: No, your Honor. We rest on our oriefing on
this issue, ‘out thank you.

THE COURT: Thank you, ‘Anything else?
