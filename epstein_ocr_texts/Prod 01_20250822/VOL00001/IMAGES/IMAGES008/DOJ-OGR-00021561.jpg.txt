preponderance that the information ‘contained in this paragraph
is. accurate.

Paragraph 83, so there was a revision here. I"m, not

previous objection was to the assertion that. the aefenoant is

Kesponsible for the victimization, of untold number of other

victims. The probation cépartméent adoptéo thé government "s

suggestion, revised, the paragraph to assert that the defenaant

is. nesponsible fer the victimization of additional minor

victims. To the extent there is a continuing objection, J

overrule it for the reasons stated regarding paragraphs 27 ana
28.

Paragraph 85 is an objection to the inclusion of

statement here. I believe that defense's ultimate position was

that with the réquéestéa réaaGtions, theéré wéré no objéctions té

her making a statement. Do I have that right?
