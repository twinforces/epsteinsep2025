Thereafter; in his December 19, 2007 letter to defense counsel. mainly: addressing. other:
inatters, Acosta inforiied the defense that the USAO would defer to the State Attorney’s discretion.
the:responsibility for notifying victims ‘about-Epstein’s state plea hearing:

notice: of [the] time and:place of Mr. Epstein’s state court [plea and]
‘sentencing hearing I) have ‘reviewed the proposed victim
notification letter and the statute. . would note thatthe United States
provided ‘the draft letter ‘to ‘the defense as a.courtesy. In addition,

First Assistant United States. Attorney Sloman already incorporated
in the letter several edits that had been requested by defense counsel:

I agree that Section 3771 applies to notice of proceedings and.results
of investigations of federal critnes a8 opposed.to'the staté-ctime. We
‘intend ‘to provide ‘victims with ‘notice: of: the federal resolution, as
required by law. We wilkdefer to the discretion of the State-Attornel:
regarding whether he wishes to provide. victims with notice of the
state’ proceedings, although we. will provide. him. with the

information. necessary fo do so. if he wishes.
(Emphasis. added.)

Acosta.told OPR. that he “would not have sent:this [letter] without running it-by [Sloman],
if not other individuals in:the office.” Acosta explained that it was “not forme to direct the State
Attorney, or for our office to direct the State Attorney’s Office: on its obligations with respect.to
the state outcome.” Acosta-acknowledged, that the USAO initially had concerns about the state’s
handling of the case, but he told OFR, “that doesn?t mean. that. they will not fulfill whatever
obligation, they have. Let's not assume... ..'that-the State Attorney’ § office is full of bad actors.”
Sloman initially believed that “the victims were! going: to be:notified. at some level, especially
because they had-restitution rights under [§] 2255": but his expectations. changed after “there was
an agreement made that we were going to allow the state, since it was going to be a state case, to
decide howthe Victims were going to be notified. “417 Sloman told.OPR he had been ‘proceeding,
under the belicf that we were going ‘to. notify the: victims,” even though. * ‘this was not.a ‘federal.
ease,” but once’the NPA “looked like it was going to, fall apart,” the USAO “had concerns thatiif
we g[a]ve them the victim: notification letter .... and’the deal, fell apart, then the victims would be:
‘instantly, impeached. bythe: provision, that: you? ‘re entitled:to monetary. compensation.”

OPR. could not determine. whether the State Attorney’s Office notified any victims: in
advance of the June:30, 2008 state-plea hearing. Krischer told OPR that'the State Attorney’ s:Office
‘had a robust and. effective victim notification process: and. staff, but he. was not aware ‘of:whether
or how ‘it was, sed in the. Epstein case. Belohlavek told OPR that she could ‘dt recall whether
victims ‘were notified. of the hearing nor whether the state ‘law required notification for the

Ale Slomaii stated in his June. 3, 2008 letter t6. Deputy Attorney General. Filip that Acosta. tade: the decision
‘together withthe Department's Criminal Division Deputy: Assistant Attorney, General Mandelker. Acosta did-consult:
with Mandélker about the § 2255 civil. damages recovery: process. but neither Acosta iér Mandelker recalled
discussing the issue of victim:notification, and OPR-:tound:no other, documentation indicating ‘that;Mandelker played,
a-role in the deferral decision.
