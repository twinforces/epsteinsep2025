12/09/2021 | 535 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Government
seeks to admit what has been identified as Government Exhibit 52 ("GX 52"), and
submit to the jury a redacted version of GX 52. The Defense objects to the admission
of GX 52 on authentication and hearsay grounds. The admissibility of the exhibit has
been the subject of pretrial motion in limine briefing and extensive supplemental
briefing. See Dkt. Nos. 390, 397, 398, 457, 476, 490. This includes supplemental
briefing received on December 8, 2021, after the authenticating witness, Mr. Juan
Alessi, underwent direct examination by the Government and voir dire by the Defense.
The Court reserved ruling on the exhibit, pending what was anticipated to be
additional testimony. Trial Tr. at 876. The Court now overrules the Defenses
objections. The parties are ORDERED to confer and propose a limiting instruction
consistent with this ruling on or before today, December 9, 2021, at 7:00 p.m. The
parties are FURTHER ORDERED to confer and prepare a stipulation that Government
Exhibits 52A, 52D, 52E, 52F, 52G, and 52H are true and correct photocopies of five
pages from GX 52. See Trial Tr. at 858. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
