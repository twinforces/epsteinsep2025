‘interviews he “wasn’t using [his] full:name,” which Juror ‘50. apparently understood:redueed the
chance:that:people. that knew him-would draw‘the, connection. /d. at-42. And, further, he,
explained that several friends that contacted ‘him after'the trial were;unaware of the trial
occurring, so he assumed his post-trial:media‘interviews would not-attract substantial attention.

Second, Juror 50 simultaneously acknowledged that because of his interviews, the, fact
‘that:he was abused:“would be a known-fact.in the world.” /d: at 24. He explained that he’had
‘made a conscious decision: in, favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter sitting on this trial for several
weeks and, secing the:victims:be brave enough to give their stories, [he] :felt” that’he:could too.
Id.yseealso.id. at 42.(“F'm.also not ashamed aboutit. It’s something:that:happened,. and it’s
something 'that is relatively common that happened to:multiple people throughout theworld.”).

‘Tn-short, Juror 50’s‘willin gness'to disclose. his sexual. abuse changed to'some. extent
between’November 4, 2021, and January 2022. ‘He. made.a conscious decision.to share the fact:
of his.sexual abuse:with a wider circle of people than-he had prior to. the time that he completed
‘the. questionnaire. At the: sametime, he presumed—in ‘hindsi ght, mistakenly—that his
interviews, given’without his lastname and predominantly to.international media:outlets, would
not be seen by his friends orfamily:in his life who, he believed, had-not followed the trial up to
that:point. That explanation. of‘partial public disclosure is further consistent'with the:fact that in
chis‘interviews he related. only: thezfaet that he’yhad- been ‘abused,:not any: details of what had
occurred. Juror:50°s wishful. thinking—or as the:Government suggests, naivety—with.respect to
his ‘post-trial interviews doesnot suggest’that:when he: completed-his questionnaire, -he intended
to'deceive. See Government:Post-Hearing'Br. at 10:n.4, Dkt. No. 648.

The! Court also asked-Juror:50 ‘about his social’media interaction with, Annie Farmer., On.
