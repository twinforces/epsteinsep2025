interviews he “wasn’t using [his] full name,” which Juror 50 apparently understood reduced the
chance that people that knew him would draw the connection. /d. at 42. And, further, he
explained that several friends that contacted him after the trial were unaware of the trial
occurring, so he assumed his post-trial media interviews would not attract substantial attention.

Second, Juror 50 simultaneously acknowledged that because of his interviews, the fact
that he was abused “would be a known fact in the world.” /d. at 24. He explained that he had
made a conscious decision in favor of disclosure because, “[a]fter sitting on this trial for several
weeks and seeing the victims be brave enough to give their stories, [he] felt” that he could too.
Id.; see also id. at 42 (‘Tm also not ashamed about it. It’s something that happened, and it’s

In short, Juror 50’s willingness to disclose his sexual abuse changed to some extent
between November 4, 2021, and January 2022. He made a conscious decision to share the fact
of his sexual abuse with a wider circle of people than he had prior to the time that he completed
the questionnaire. At the same time, he presumed—in hindsight, mistakenly—that his
interviews, given without his last name and predominantly to international media outlets, would
not be seen by his friends or family in his life who, he believed, had not followed the trial up to
that point. That explanation of partial public disclosure is further consistent with the fact that in
his interviews he related only the fact that he had been abused, not any details of what had
occurred. Juror 50’s wishful thinking—or as the Government suggests, naivety—with respect to
his post-trial interviews does not suggest that when he completed his questionnaire, he intended
to deceive. See Government Post-Hearing Br. at 10 n.4, Dkt. No. 648.

The Court also asked Juror 50 about his social media interaction with Annie Farmer. On
Twitter, Farmer shared an article that contained an interview with Juror 50 and she said that
