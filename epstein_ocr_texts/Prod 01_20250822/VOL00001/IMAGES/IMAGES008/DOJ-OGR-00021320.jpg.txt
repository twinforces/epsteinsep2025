H. APPLICABLE STANDARDS OF CONDUCT
A. ‘The United States Attorneys’ Manual

Among, its many provisions, the United States. Attorneys’ Manual (USAM) includes.
general statements of principles that: summarize appropriate considerations to ‘be weighed, and.
desirable practices to be followed, by federal. prosecutors when. discharging their prosecutorial,
responsibilities.!*” The: goal of the USAM is to. promote “the: reasoned, exercise of prosecutorial
authority | ‘and contribute to the fait, evenhanded ‘administration, of the Federal, criminal laws,” and
to promote:public confidence that important prosecutorial decisions, will be made.* ‘rationally and
objectively on the merits of cach case.” USAM § 9-27.001..

Because the, VSAM. is designed to a8sist in, Structuring thé decision-making process, of'
government attorneys, many..of its principles are: cast ‘in. gencral terms, with. a view to: providing,
guidance rather than mandating results. Jd.; see-ulso USAM § 9-27.120, comment:(“It is expected.
that cach Federal prosecutor'will be guided, by these: principles in carrying out his/her criminal law
enforcement responsibilities... .: However, itsis not intended that-reference to these:principles will,
require a ‘particular ‘prosecutorial decision in any given, case.”); USAM. § 9-27.110, comment:
(Under the Eederal:criminal justice system, the:prosecutor has: wide latitude i in.determining when,
whom, how, and ¢ven whether to prosecute for apparent. violations of Federal criminal law.”).
However, ‘USAM. § 927.130 provides that .AUSAs ‘who depart. from. the principles ‘of federal.
prosecution, articulated j in the USAM-iiiay be: subject: to internal. discipline. Tn particular; USAM.
§ 9-27.130 states that each U.S. Attorney:should establish internal office procedures: toensure‘that
prosectitorial decisions are, made atian appropriate level of responsibility and are consistent with
the principles. set forth in.the USAM, and.that serious, unjustified. departures from the principles
set forth in the USAM are followed by teiriedial action, including the imposition of disciplinary
sanctions when warranted and.deemed appropriate.

U.S. Attorneys have “plenary authority with regard to federal. criminal matters” and may
modify. or depart from the: principles. set forth-in the USAM-as deemed: necessary in the interest:of
fair and effective law enforcement; within thei? individual judicial districts. USAM §§ 9-2.001,
9.27-140. The USAM provisions are supplemented by. the. Department’s Criminal. Resource
Manual, ‘Which provides additional guidance, relating to the conduct of federal criminal,
prosecutions.
