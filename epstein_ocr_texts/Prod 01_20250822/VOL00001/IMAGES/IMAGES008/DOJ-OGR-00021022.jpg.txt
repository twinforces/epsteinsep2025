the Government’s investigation was relatively recent, e.g., Trial Tr. at 354 (Jane), 1245 (Kate),
1680-84 (Carolyn), suggesting that an earlier prosecution was not feasible.

Even on the first step of the inquiry, the Defendant has failed to demonstrate that she
suffered actual and substantial prejudice from delay. United States v. Pierre-Louis, No. 16 CR
541 (CM), 2018 WL 4043140, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 9, 2018). Substantial prejudice is a
stringent standard. The Defendant’s “proof of prejudice must be definite and not speculative.”
United States v. Birney, 686 F.2d 102, 105-06 (2d Cir. 1982). Actual prejudice “is commonly
demonstrated by the loss of documentary evidence or the unavailability of a key witness.”
Cornielle, 171 F.3d at 752. But “claims of mere loss of memory resulting from the passage of
time have been held to be insufficient.” Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL 4043140, at *4. And for any
evidence lost because of delay, the Defendant “must ‘demonstrate how (the loss of evidence) is
prejudicial’ to her.” Birney, 686 F.2d at 106 (quoting United States v. Mays, 549 F.2d 670, 677
(9th Cir. 1977)).

The Defendant identifies two major sets of lost evidence that, she says, demonstrate
actual prejudice to her defense at trial. First, she points to documentary evidence absent at trial:
(1) flight records, including passenger manifests and records from Epstein’s travel agent, that
may have been more detailed than the flight logs entered at trial; (2) financial documents,
including bank records and credit card records, which would have revealed more about the
Defendant’s receipt of funds from Epstein and could have been used to verify or disprove certain
dates; (3) a complete set of the Defendant’s phone records; and (4) Epstein’s property records for
both his New York and New Mexico residences. Second, the Defendant identifies four deceased
witnesses: Albert Pinto and Roger Salhi, architects that built and renovated Epstein’s residences
in Florida, New York, and New Mexico; Sally Markham, a property manager for Epstein in the
