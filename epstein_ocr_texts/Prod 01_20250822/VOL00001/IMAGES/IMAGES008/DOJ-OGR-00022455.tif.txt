5 falling out that they ultimately had?
6 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I think -- I wasn't
7 there and I don't know how it happened. I only know
8 what Les has said in the press.
9 TODD BLANCHE: So you only know about
10 their, you know, their falling out or whatever you
11 want to call it, from what you've kind of read, not
12 from any firsthand knowledge? You did -- you weren't
13 there, you weren't part of that?
14 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Correct.
15 TODD BLANCHE: Do you know somebody named
16 Steven Hoffenberg?
17 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Only from the press.
18 TODD BLANCHE: Okay. And so you don't
19 know anything about whatever business relationship
20 they may have had, Mr. Epstein --
21 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Never spoke about him,
22 never mentioned it. I -- I only learned about that,
23 whatever that is, even -- I don't even know what the
24 truth is of that story, from the press.
25 TODD BLANCHE: How about Leon Black?
