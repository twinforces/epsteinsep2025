current CEOS. Deputy. Chief told. OPR that it was primarily a “listening: session” with, Starr doing,
most of the:prescntation. Oosterbaan told OPR that he:recalled “some: back and forth” because the
defense team-:was saying “some outrageous things.” Both Oosterbaan andchis: Deputy Chief were
disturbed’that'the foriier CEOS. Principal, Deputy Chief, who had. been an.aggressive advocate ‘for

make sworn-statements at Epstein’ 'S sentencing; and

the purported. existence: of a “relationship” between Sloman, and ‘a
