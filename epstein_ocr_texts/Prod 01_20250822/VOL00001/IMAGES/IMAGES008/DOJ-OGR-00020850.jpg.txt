Constructive Amendment / Variance

First, without ‘further instruction, the jury could:convict!Ms. Maxwell based on a

eonstructive:amendment and/or prejudicial variance. from the S2 Indictment. The Court has
‘recently explained.the. law on construetiyve amendment and variance. “T.o-prevail on a‘constructive
amendment claim, ‘a.defendant must demonstrate that the terms of [an] ‘indictment are in efféct
altered by the:presentation:oftevidence and,jury instructions;which.so modify essential:elements of”
‘the offense charged that theretis.a,substantial likelihood that the defendantmay have been
convicted of an, offense: other-than,that:charged:in the indictment.” ‘United. States’v. Gross, No.15-
er-769 (AJN), 2017 WL 4685111, at *20 (S-/D-N-Y.. Oct. 18,2017) (cleaned.up). “Because the
doctrine of:constructive amendment protects a defendant’s Grand Jury Clause rights, a.
constructiveamendment constitutes a," per. se violation* of the:defendant’s constitutional rights—
Le: there.is:no:requirement that a defendant:make a specific showing ‘of prejudice.” Id. (quoting
United States v..D’Amelio, 683 F.3d.41.2, 417 :(2d-Cir. 2012).

Although the Second. Circuit has “consistently permitted significant flexibility” in how the
government proves the.crime alleged, the defendant:must be'“given notice of the-core.of
criminality to'be proven at'trial.” Jd: (cleaned.up). “[A]lthough an-indictment “drawn in general
‘terms’ mayarticulate a broad core of criminality, ‘an indictment that:is drawn in specificrterms
amay’be read.to specify: a narrower'sct of facts—such that the proof of completely distinct facts at
trial could lead. to'a‘constructive amendment.” Jd. (quoting United. States'v. Wozniak, 1.26 F.3d.

105, 109-10 (2d Cir. 1.997).
