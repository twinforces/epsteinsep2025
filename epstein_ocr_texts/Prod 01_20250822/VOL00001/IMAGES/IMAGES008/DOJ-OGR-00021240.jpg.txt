‘Menchel. could :not recall. who initially. suggested a state plea, but noted. to: OPR. that his:
own.“emails ... make clear that this course of.action was ultimately decided by Alex Acosta.” He
referenced, among, others, his. May 14, 2007 email. to Villafaiia informing her that Acosta was
deciding how he: warited to handle'the case. Menchel surmised. that a.state resolution accomplished
two things that.Acosta viewed. as important: first, it resolved. any Petite policy concerns, and.
second, it afforded more’flexibility in sentencing than a federal plea would. have.allowed. Menchel,
told. OPR. that: the: state: plea proposal did. not reflect any minimization of Epstein’s. conduct. and.
that any state :plea-would. have: been.to an. offense ‘that:required ‘sexual offender:registration. He
told-OPR, “I don’t think anybody. sat. around and.said, you know,.it’s not that big a deal. ‘That was
not the reaction:that:I think anybody’ ‘had from the-federal:side ofthis case.” Rather, Menchel:said,
“The concern was if we charge him. [as‘proposed], there’s ‘going to be a trial.”

2. July 2007: Villafatia and Menchel Disagrée about the Proposed State
Resolution

Villafatiatold OPR that she was angry when she‘received Menchel’s Julyemail explaining:
that he had proposed ‘to Sanchez. resolving the federal investigation through a state:plea. Jn.
Villafana’s view, the proposed ; state resolution “didn’t make any’sense’ “and. “didnot correspond”
to Department policy requiring, that a ‘plea offer reflect “the :most ‘serious readily provable
offense.” In her’ WIeW, a plea, to:a.state char’ que “obviously” ‘would not-satisty this. policy. Villafana,
also told OPR. that :in her view,, the: USAM. required the. USAO. to confer with. the: investigative.
agency about plea négotiations, and Villafaiia did-not believe the EBI;would_ be in favor ofa state:
plea. Villafatia ‘also believed. the CVRA required. attorneys for the government to::confer with.
Victiins before, making: a plea. offer, but the. Victiins had not been, consulted about this, proposal.
Villafana told. OPR, she: had. met with, some: of the: victims during the: course of the investigation
who had negative impressions of the State Attorney’s Office, and she’believed.that “sending:them.
back, to the State Attorney’s Office was not something” those victims would support..

SS This policy was sel forth-in-a September’ 22. 2003 memorandum from:then Atlormey General.John,Ashcroft
regarding: “Department Policy ‘Concerning Charging Criminal Offenses, Disposition. of Charges:, and. Sentencing”

(kiowin 3 as the “Asherolt Men 3), AV hich provided, an pertinentpart:

[Jn all, federal stiminal, ¢ cases, » federal prosecutors must: t charge and: ‘pursue: the

‘ in. “the. ‘limited. circumstances
described bele The itost scriots offense or Gticises are those that g generate: the
most substantial sentence: under the’ Sentencing Guidelines, unless’ a'‘mandator. y
minimum Sénténce or count requiring a. CONSECUTIVE. SeNIEHCE. Woiild Wenérate: a
longer, sentence. A-charge.is not“readily provable” ifthe prosecutor has a:zood,
‘faith doubt, for.legal-or-evidentiary reasons, as:to the Government's ability readily
to. prove a charge; at trial. Thus, charges. should, not: be: filed, simply: to, ‘exert

may: not ‘be: dismissed. except: ‘to: the extent: permitted [elsewhere in, this
Memorandum].
