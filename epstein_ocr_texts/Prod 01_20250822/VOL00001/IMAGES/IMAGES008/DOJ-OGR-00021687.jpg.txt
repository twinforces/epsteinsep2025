Thus, Epstein’s NPA with the USAO-SDFL does
not bar this prosecution of Maxwell, and Judge Na-
than correctly denied the motions to dismiss.°®
3. The District Court Did Not Abuse Its
Discretion in Declining to Conduct a
Hearing
Finally, Maxwell argues that the District Court
erred by denying her motions to dismiss without an
evidentiary hearing. (Br.38-40). But as Judge Nathan
explained, the cases cited by Maxwell in support of her
request for a hearing “mostly involved oral agreements
where there was no written record of the full set of
terms reached by the parties,” and all of which “in-
volved defendants with first-hand knowledge of the ne-
gotiations.... This is no such case. The NPA’s terms
are clear.” (A.145). Furthermore, Maxwell had “an un-
usually large amount of information about the NPA’s
negotiation history in the form of the OPR report yet
6 Even if the NPA were deemed to apply here, it
would only cover Count Six, which concerns a victim
known to USAO-SDFL and a statute mentioned in the
NPA, and not Counts Three and Four, which concern
different or additional victims and offenses over an ex-
panded time period. Maxwell’s suggestion that the co-
conspirator provision “is not limited to any particular
offense or any time period” (Br.40) is based on the
premise that the USAO-SDFL immunized Maxwell for
any and all crimes, past or future, and highlights the
unreasonableness of reading the NPA to apply to other
U.S. Attorney’s Offices.
