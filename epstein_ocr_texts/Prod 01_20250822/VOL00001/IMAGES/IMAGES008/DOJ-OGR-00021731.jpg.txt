alleged in the indictment.” United States v. Banki, 685
F.3d 99, 119 (2d Cir. 2012). Reversal due to a variance
is appropriate only when the defendant can establish
“that substantial prejudice occurred at trial as a result
of the variance,” a showing that cannot be made
“where the pleading and the proof substantially corre-
spond, where the variance is not of a character that
could have misled the defendant at trial, and where
the variance is not such as to deprive the accused of
his right to be protected against another prosecution
for the same offense.” Khalupsky, 5 F.4th at 294. So
long as a defendant receives notice of the Govern-
ment’s theory, the defendant cannot show prejudice.
See, e.g., Banki, 685 F.3d at 119.

This Court reviews claims of constructive amend-
ment and prejudicial variance de novo. Dove, 884 F.3d
at 146, 149.

C. Discussion

There is no likelihood—much less a substantial
likelihood—that the jury convicted Maxwell solely be-
cause Jane was transported to New Mexico. At no
point during the trial, including its summation, did the
Government argue that the jury could convict on a the-
ory that Maxwell intended Jane to be abused in New
Mexico. Similarly, the District Court’s charge required
the jury to decide whether Maxwell intended to violate
New York law. The trial contained no instructions de-
scribing for the jury any particular criminal statute in
New Mexico, or any other basis by which a jury could
convict based on conduct in New Mexico.
