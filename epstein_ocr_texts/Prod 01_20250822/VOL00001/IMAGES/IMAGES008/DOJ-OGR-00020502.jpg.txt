11/18/2020 73. | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on re: 60 Letter filed by USA as
to Ghislaine Maxwell re: The Government respectfully requests that the Court approve
the Government's request to delay disclosure of these
Materials... ENDORSEMENT...There is no dispute that the materials referenced in the
Government's letter will be turned over to the defense. The Government has indicated
that it will do so. The only dispute, then, relates to the timing of such disclosure. See
Dkt. Nos. 64, 65. Because the Government has articulated plausible reasons for some
delay of disclosure, see Dkt. No. 65 at 4, the Court grants the Government's request to
delay disclosure. However, the Governments proposal to delay disclosure until 8
weeks in advance of trial is insufficient. In order to ensure that the defense can
adequately prepare for trial, the Government shall produce the referenced materials,
which are not voluminous, to the defense by March 12, 2021. Disclosure of the
materials will of course be subject to the protective order entered by the Court, see
Dkt. No. 36. (Government Responses due by 3/12/2021) (Signed by Judge Alison J.
