M6SQmax1

United States vs. Guerrero, 910 F.3d 72 (20 Cir. 2018). Here,
the parties and the probation department agree that applying
the current Glidelines would, result in, a significantly longer

sentence than the application of the guidelines in place when

the cefencant committeco her offense; whether that. is the 20C3

or 2004 guidelines.
The cortrolling date for 6X post, facto purposes is ‘the

last date of the offense of convictton. The 2004 Guidelines

became effective on November 1, 2004. Seo I must determine if.
the last Gate of the offense was after November 1, 2004.

Because it seeks an increased punishment, the

government. bears the burden of persuasion. The government

charged, a decade-long conspiracy of sextial abuse that the
inoictment, allegéd ended in 2004. It'S proof at trial that the
conspiracy continues in 2004 relateo to Carolyn. And the
chargeo. conspiracy had to end no later than very early 2CC5
becatise that.'s when Carolyn turneéa 18 ana ean no longer be
deemed a victim of the federal sex=trafficking offense ‘charged
which proscribes conduct with respect to individuals under the
age of 18. So the government. purports to carry its buraen on
this iSsué baseo on pértions of Carélyn'sS téstimony and some
message paas regaraing what. occurreo im 2004 ana 2605.

Let me state clearly, I found, as I saia repeatedly in

my factual conclusions 6n thé PSR objéctions, I founa Carélyn

to. be a credible ‘witness, as did the jury. The question before
