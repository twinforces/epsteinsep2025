1 MR. FIGGINS: Your Honor, I would think it would

2 probably be about five days on our case.

3 And your Honor, I did want to ask the Court or we

4 would like to at least get some type of idea with respect to

5 the status of the inspector general's report. I do think that
6 it's beyond relevant; it's an investigation into what happened
7 here. There's going to be multiple details of information and
8 interviews and statements and things of that nature regarding

9 this particular case, so on and so forth. So I would ask at

10 least the Court to see if we can get a time frame from the

11 government if that report is going to be imminently due or what
12 type of time frame we're looking at, because I do believe there
13 are going to be a lot of relevant facts in that report, that we
14 would need that information. And then we would need time to

15 then maybe even investigate based on some of that information.
16 THE COURT: Does the government know anything about

17 that?

18 MS. DONALESKI: Your Honor, I don't. And I'll just

19 clarify that to the extent counsel's asking for a summary of
20 the results of the criminal investigation, obviously we'll be
al turning over in discovery all of the underlying results of the
22 criminal investigation. So I'ma little puzzled as to what
23 defense counsel is saying that he needs. I don't have a time
24 frame on the inspector general report, but the government will
25 produce to the defense all of the relevant discovery materials
