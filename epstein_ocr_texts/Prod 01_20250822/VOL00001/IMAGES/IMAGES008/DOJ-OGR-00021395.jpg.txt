victim/witness staff were “ready. to assist you with. the details. of victim notification, and ‘other
areas for which United States Attorncy[’]s Offices are now explicitly responsible under the act.”

inandatory. offiee-wide training on victini/witness issues and training for new. employees.

B. —‘ The Automated Victim Notification System

Both ‘the FBI and the USAO manage contacts with crime victims through the Victiin,
Notification System.(VNS),,an.automated system maintained by the Executive Office for United
States Attorneys. The 2005 Guidelines inandated ‘that: “Victiin contact! information aid notice to:
victims.of events... . ‘shall, absent exceptional. circumstances. (such. as cases ‘involving juvenile or
forcigh Victims), be conducted. and maintained using: VNS.” The VNS is separate, from agency:
case management systems maintained by the FBI ‘and the: USAO. Both the FBI and. the USAO
use the VNS to generate form lIctters to. victims at, various points in the investigation and. the:
prosecution ofa criminal case. Although ‘cach form, letter can, be augmented to.add.some limited.
‘individual. matter-specific content, the letters: contain. specific language concerning the purpose of.
the contact ‘that, cannot be removed (suchas the arrest of the defendant. or the scheduling of-a.
sentencing, hearing).?”!

Inthe usual. course ‘of: a criminal case, the FBI .collects victim. contact. information ‘during,
the‘investigation stage, which itstores in.its case-management system. The FBI’s Victim Specialist.
‘exports ‘the victim ‘information. data from the EBI’s case management system into: the: VNS
database. Victim information stored in‘the VNS is linked to:the investigation’s VNS case number.
At-the time of the Epstein investigation, the FBI’s Victim.Specialist could;use the VNS to generate
seven. different form notification letters: (1) initial notification; (2) case ‘is, under investigation:
(3); arrest. of the defendant; (4) declination, of prosecution: (5) other: (6) advice of victim ‘rights:
and (7) investigation closed.

After a charging document has been. filed.and the:“prosecution stage” begins, the: USAO’s
Victim. Witness: Specialist, assumes responsibility for victim. notification.””* The USAO imports
data from, its case: management.system, into the: WNS and Jinks to'the previously loaded. FBI'VNS
data. The USAO’s. Victim Witness Specialist uses the: VNS to generate form letters providing:
notice :of:case events, such as charges filed; an arraignment; a/proposed:plea-agreement; change of
plea hearings; sentencing hearings; and the result of sentencing hearings.
