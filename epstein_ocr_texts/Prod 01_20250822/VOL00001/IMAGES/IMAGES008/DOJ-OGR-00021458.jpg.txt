As discussed below; OPR.coneludes that.none ofthe subject attorneys:violated:a clear, and
unambiguous duty under the CVRA because the USAO resolved the Epstein investigation without;
a federal criminal. charge. In September 2007, when. the NP'A:was signed, the Department did not.
interpret CVRA rights to attach unless and’ until federal charges had been filed, and the federal.
courts-had not established. a clear and unambiguous standard applying the: CVRA before criminal.
charges Were brotight.. Pursuant ‘to OPR’s established analytical framework, OPR. does not find.
professional. misconduct. unless ‘a subject ‘attorney intentionally or recklessly violated. a clear and.
unambiguous standard. Accordingly, OPR.finds thatthe subject:attorneys’ conduct did not rise:to
the: level, of professional, misconduct, OPR ‘nevertheless concludes that ‘the lack of consultation
was part of.a series of governmentzinteractions with victims that ultimately, led:to public and.court:
condemnation ofthe government’ s treatment-of the victims, reflected poor ly on the Department-as
a whole, and is contradictory ‘to ‘the Department’s: mission to “minimize the frustration. and
confusion that victims of.a crime endure in ‘its wake.22°

As At the Time, No Clear and. Unambiguous Standard Required the USAO to
Notify Victims Regarding Case-Related Events until after the Filing of.
Criminal Charges:

Although the rights enumerated inthe GVRA are clear on-their.face, the threshold. issue of
whether an individual qualifies as.a ‘vVictin to whom CVRA. ‘tights. attach was neither clear nor
unambiguous at the'time the USAO. entered into'the NPA:with Epstein.in September2007. Atthat
time, the Depattinent. interpreted the CVRA in a way that differed, markedly from. the district
court’s later. interpretation in the CVRA. litigation.

The CVRA defines a “crime victim” as “‘a person directly. and ‘proximately harmed as a,
result.of the:commission.of.a Eederaloffense:or an.offense in the District of Columbia.” On April.
L, 2005, soon after the ‘;CVRA was enacted, OLC concluded: that, “the status of a “crime ‘victim’
may be reasonably: understood.to commence ‘upon. the filing. of a criminal. complaint, and that the
Status. ends if there is a. Subsequent decision ‘not to indict: or prosecute, ‘the. Federal offense that:
directly. caused the victim’s: harm.” ’ Beginning, with the 2005 OLC: guidance, the Department. has
consistently takén the position that CVRA. rights do not apply until the initiation of criminal
charges against a defendant, whether by complaint, indictment, or information. OLC applied. its
definition to all cight CVRA rights in effect in 2005, but noted that the obligation created by the:
eighth CVRA-right—to “treat[] victims with fairness and respect” — s“always expected of Federal.
officials, and the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act, of 1990 ’VRRA)] ‘indicates ‘that this right:
applies “throughout the ‘criminal justice process. 397 Consistent with the: OLC interpretation, in,
May 2005) the: Department issued the 2005 Guidelines to:implement'the CVRA.

The. .2005 Guidelines assigned GVRA-related obligations to prosecutors only after the
initiation of federal charges. Specifically, the 2005 Guidélines stated thatidtiring-the “prosecution
stage,” the “responsible official” should make reasonable: efforts to: notify identified. victims of,
