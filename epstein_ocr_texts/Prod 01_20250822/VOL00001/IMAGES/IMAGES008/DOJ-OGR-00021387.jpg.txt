from, Villafafia:and others, but given the highly-unusual procedure being considered, his decision.
should have. been ‘made only after a, full consideration. of ‘all of ‘the possible : amifications and,
consequences of pushing the. matter into the: state: court system, with. which ‘neither’ Villafaiia nor
the. other subjects had experience; along with consideration of the legal.and evidentiary issues and
possible means'.of overcoming those: ‘issues.. OPR did. not find evidence indicating that.such a
mécting. OF disctission With the ‘full, tea was held before, the, decision was, made to pursue the
state-based resolution, before’ the decision. was made to: offer a ‘two-year term of. incarceration, ‘or
before the NPA, with its unusual terms, was signed. As Acosta later recognized and.told OPR,

“And a ‘question that I think isa valid one ‘in-my mind-is, did the focus on, let’s just. get this done:
and get:a jail term, mean that:we didn’t take a step back and say, let?s evaluate how this train is
moving?”

Many features of the NPA. were given inadequate consideration, including core ‘provisions
like the term of incarceration and-sexual offender:registration, with the:result that.Epstein. was able.
to manipulate the process to his benefit. Meibers, of his senior staff held differing opinions.abouti
some: of. the. issues that Acosta felt. were: important and ‘that factored. into his decision-making.
There does ‘not. scem to be a point, however, at. which those differing, opinions were considered.
when forming ’a’strategy: rather, Acosta’scems'to have: made a decision that everyone beneath him
followed and.attempted to implement'but. without a considered strategy beyond attaining‘the:three
core elements. As the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had. authority'to proceed. in this manner, butmany of
the: problems that developed with the NPA might ‘have been avoided with. a more: thoughtful.
approach.. As: Acosta. ‘belatedly. recognized, “[I]f I was advising a fellow U.S. Attorney. today, I.
would say, think.it through.”**

No one of the individual problems discussed aboye necessarily demonstrates poor
judgment by-itself. However, in. combination, the evidence shows that the state-based resolution
was ill. conceived from the start-and that the NPA ‘resulted from a flawed.decision -making, process.
Erom the time the USAO opened its :investigation,, Acosta recognized the federal ‘interest in.
prosecuting Epstein, yet. after ‘that investigation had run ‘for more than a year: he set: the
Investigation ona a path: mot | or riginally contemplated. Having done | sO, , he had esponsibility: for
a federal investigation. into serious: criminal. conduct. Acosta’: S failure to adequately consider. the
‘full:ramifications of the NPA contributed to a, process and ultimately a result that left not only the
line AUSA and.the FBI case agents dissatisfied but also.caused.victims:and the:public to question
the motives of the prosecutors and whether any reasonable incastite. of justice was achieved.
Accordingly, OPR. concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment. in that. he chose a course: of
action that was in inatked contrast to thé action that the Department would reasonably expect an,
attorney. exercising ‘good judgment totake.,

289 ‘In commenting on, OPR’s draft report. Acosta’s attorney acknowledged that “(he matter sould, have:

benefited from:moré-consistent siaffingzand attention.”
