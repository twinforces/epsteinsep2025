civil case, but that is not the legal standard. The Government may prevail if it proves that
Maxwell’s answers could have led to the discovery of other evidence or could influence the
factfinder in the civil case. See Gaudin, 515 U.S. at 509; Kross, 14 F.3d at 753-54. At trial, a
reasonable juror could conclude that truthful answers to the questions may have permitted the
plaintiff to locate other victims or witnesses who could have corroborated the plaintiffs
testimony. The factual disputes relating to materiality are at least enough to preclude pretrial
resolution. In criminal cases, courts must guard against “invading the “inviolable function of the
jury’ in our criminal justice system,” and if the “defense raises a factual dispute that is
inextricably intertwined with a defendant’s potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that
dispute on a Rule 12(b) motion.” United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 270, 281 (2d Cir. 2018).

The Court concludes that the perjury charges are legally tenable and appropriately
presented to the jury.

V. The perjury charges must be severed and tried separately

Although the perjury charges are legally tenable, the Court concludes that the interests of
justice require severing those counts and trying them separately. Trying the perjury counts
together with the Mann Act counts would require admitting evidence of other acts likely to be
unduly prejudicial. It would also risk disqualifying Maxwell’s chosen counsel based on their
involvement in the earlier civil case.

Rule 14(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows a court to order separate
trials if joming all offenses in a single trial would prejudice the defendant. A defendant seeking
severance must show significant unfairness to outweigh the burden on the court of conducting
multiple trials. United States v. Walker, 142 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir. 1998). The harm to the
defendant must be more than “solely the adverse effect of being tried for two crimes rather than
