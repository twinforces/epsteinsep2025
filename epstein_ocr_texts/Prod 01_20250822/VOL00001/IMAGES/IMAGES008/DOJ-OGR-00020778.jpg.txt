IIE. ~The indictment:describes the charged. offenses with specificity
Maxwell seeks to dismiss ‘the Mann Act counts for lack:of specificity:or:in the,alternative.
‘to compel the, Government to, submit a bill.ofparticulars providing greater detail of the charges.
‘The. Court concludes that:the charges ‘in the:S] superseding indictment-are. clear enough.
‘Under. Federal Rule of Criminal. Procedure. 7, an indictment:must contain “a plain,
concise, and definite written, statement ofthe essential. facts constituting the offense charged.”
The. indictment must’be specific enough to, inform.the. defendant of the: charges and allow: the
defendant to plead:double jeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events. United.
States ‘v. Stavroulakis,.952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Gir. 1992). “Under this test, an indictment:need:do
little more than to track: the language: of the statute charged and state the time and place (in.
approximate terms). of the alleged crime.” Wnited-States. v. Tramunti, 513 F.2d.1.087, 1113 (2d
Cir. 1975). In addition to-dismissal, “Rule 7(f).of the Federal Rules ‘of Criminal Procedure
permits a defendant to seekia-bill of particulars.in order’to identify with:sufficient particularity
‘the nature of the: charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to:prepare. for. trial, to:
‘prevent surprise, ‘and to interpose:a‘plea‘of double, jeopardy. should-he be prosecuted a. second.
time for the same offense.” United States. v. Bortnovsky, 820 £.2d.572, 574 (2d. Cir. 1987).
The:S1 superseding indictment sets out the ‘elements. of cach charged. crime: and.the: facts
supporting cach.clement. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that'the indictment is too vague
‘because it. refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and
“befriending” that is notinherently criminal, and.does not identify the alleged. victims by ‘name.
Maxwell’s first argument fails because the:Goyernment need only describe:the time and.

subject to‘proof'at trial. “[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the:*on,or‘about” Janguage used.
