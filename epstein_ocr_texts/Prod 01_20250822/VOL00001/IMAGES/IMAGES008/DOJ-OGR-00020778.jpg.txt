Il. The indictment describes the charged offenses with specificity

Maxwell seeks to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity or in the alternative
to compel the Government to submit a bill of particulars providing greater detail of the charges.
The Court concludes that the charges in the $1 superseding indictment are clear enough.

Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7, an indictment must contain “a plain,
concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.”
The indictment must be specific enough to inform the defendant of the charges and allow the
defendant to plead double jeopardy in a later prosecution based on the same events. United
States v. Stavroulakis, 952 F.2d 686, 693 (2d Cir. 1992). “Under this test, an indictment need do
little more than to track the language of the statute charged and state the time and place (in
approximate terms) of the alleged crime.” United States. v. Tramunti, 513 F.2d 1087, 1113 (2d
Cir. 1975). In addition to dismissal, “Rule 7(f) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure
permits a defendant to seek a bill of particulars in order to identify with sufficient particularity
the nature of the charge pending against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to
prevent surprise, and to interpose a plea of double jeopardy should he be prosecuted a second
time for the same offense.” United States v. Bortnovsky, 820 F.2d 572, 574 (2d Cir. 1987).

The S1 superseding indictment sets out the elements of each charged crime and the facts
supporting each element. Nonetheless, Maxwell contends that the indictment is too vague
because it refers to open-ended time periods, describes conduct like “grooming” and
“befriending” that is not inherently criminal, and does not identify the alleged victims by name.

Maxwell’s first argument fails because the Government need only describe the time and
place of charged conduct “in approximate terms.” Tramunti, 513 F.2d at 1113. The details are
subject to proof at trial. “[T]he Second Circuit routinely upholds the ‘on or about’ language used.
