1 convicted of a sex crime; and I readily find she engaged ina

2 pattern of activity involving prohibited sexual conduct.

3 Specifically, the Guidelines define a pattern of such activity
4 as the defendant engaging in prohibited sexual conduct with a

5 minor on at least two separate occasions.

6 The defendant doesn't contest any of these enumerated
7 requirements. Rather, she argues that I may apply this

8 enhancement only if I further find that the defendant poses a

g continuing danger to the public. Here, the defense draws this
10 requirement from background commentary by the Sentencing

11 Commission and a few statements made by members of the Congress
12 who of emphasized high recidivism rates in enhancing sentences
LS for sex offenders.

14 I overrule this objection because it lacks any basis
15 in the Guidelines. As with all interpretive matters, I start
16 with the text of the Guidelines. If the text is unambiguous, I
17 apply it as written and do not resort to background commentary.
18 United States v. Sash, 396 F.3d 515 (2d Cir. 2005). Commentary
19 cited by the defendant simply provides policy rationale for a
20 particular enhancement. It does not purport to interpret the
21 Guidelines and so is not binding. Nor can scattered
22 legislative history override the clear text of the Guidelines,
23 especially when that history amounts to only a few short floor
24 statements which are "among the least illuminating forms of
25 legislative history." NLRB v. SW General, Inc. 137, S. Ct. 929
