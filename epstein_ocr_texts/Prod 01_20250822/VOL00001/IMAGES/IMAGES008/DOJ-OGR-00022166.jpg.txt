As part of our commitment to transparency, the Department of Justice and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation have conducted an exhaustive review of investigative holdings relating to
Jeffrey Epstein. To ensure that the review was thorough, the FBI conducted digital searches of its
databases, hard drives, and network drives as well as physical searches of squad areas, locked
cabinets, desks, closets, and other areas where responsive material may have been stored. These
searches uncovered a significant amount of material, including more than 300 gigabytes of data
and physical evidence.

The files relating to Epstein include a large volume of images of Epstein, images and videos
of victims who are either minors or appear to be minors, and over ten thousand downloaded videos
and images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography. Teams of agents, analysts,
attorneys, and privacy and civil liberties experts combed through the digital and documentary
evidence with the aim of providing as much information as possible to the public while
simultaneously protecting victims. Much of the material is subject to court-ordered sealing. Only
a fraction of this material would have been aired publicly had Epstein gone to trial, as the seal
served only to protect victims and did not expose any additional third-parties to allegations of
illegal wrongdoing. Through this review, we found no basis to revisit the disclosure of those
materials and will not permit the release of child pornography.

This systematic review revealed no incriminating “client list.”” There was also no credible
evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions. We did not
uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.

Consistent with prior disclosures, this review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one
thousand victims. Each suffered unique trauma. Sensitive information relating to these victims is
intertwined throughout the materials. This includes specific details such as victim names and
likenesses, physical descriptions, places of birth, associates, and employment history.

One of our highest priorities is combatting child exploitation and bringing justice to
victims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about Epstein serves neither of those ends.

To that end, while we have labored to provide the public with maximum information
regarding Epstein and ensured examination of any evidence in the government’s possession, it is
the determination of the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation that no
further disclosure would be appropriate or warranted.
