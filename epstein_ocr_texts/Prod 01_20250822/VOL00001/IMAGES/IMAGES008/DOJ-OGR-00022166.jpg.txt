Federal Bureau of Investigation

As part.of our commitment to transparency, the Department of. Justice and. the Federal.
Bureau. of Investigation have conducted an exhaustive review of investigative holdings relating to
Jeffrey Epstcin. To cnisure that the review was thorough, the EBI conducted digital scarches of its
databases, hard. drives, and nctwork drives as. well as physical searches ‘of squad arcas, locked,
cabinets, desks, closets, and other arcas ‘where ‘responsive material, may have been stored. These
searches uncovered a significant amount, of material, including niore than 300 gigabytes of data
and physical evidence.

The files relating to Epstein.inelude a large'volumeof images of Epstein, images and videos
of Victims. Who. are. cither minors orappear to ‘be mMinoi's, and:over ten thousand downloaded ‘videos
and images of illegal child. sex, abuse matcrial.and other pornography. Teams ofagents, analysts,
attorneys, and ‘privacy’ and civil, libertics experts. combed. ‘through. the digital and, documentary
evidence with. the aim of providing. .as much. information. as possible to the public while
simultancously protecting victims. Much of the:matcrial is subject'to court-ordered scaling. Only
‘a, fraction of this material would have been, aired publicly had Epstcin. gone to trial, ‘as ‘the ‘seal,
served only’ to protect victims and did not expose ary additional ‘third-parties, to, allegations of
illegal wrongdoing. Through. this review, we: found no basis to revisit the ‘disclosure of those:
materials and will:;not permit the release of child pornography.

This: systematic review revealed no incriminating “client list.” There was also no credible

‘evidence found that Epstein’ blackmailed prominent individuals as part:of his actions. We did not:

‘uncover evidence that: could predicate an investigation against uncharged third partics.

Consistent with. prior disclosures, this review confirmed that Epstein harmed..over. one
thousand victims. Each suffered unique trauma., Sensitive information relating to these victims is
intertwined throughout the materials. This includes specific details such as ‘victim names ‘and,
likenesses, physical descriptions, places of birth, associates, and employment history.

One of our highest ‘prioritics is combatting child exploitation, and bringing justice! to
victims. Perpetuating unfounded theories about’ Epstein Serves ncither of those ends.

To that end, while we ‘have labored to ‘provide the public! with maximum. information.
regarding Epstcin and cnsuréd ¢xamination of any evidence in the government’s possession, it is
the determination of the Department of Justice and. the Federal Burcau of .Investigation that no
further disclosure’would be appropriate or warranted.
