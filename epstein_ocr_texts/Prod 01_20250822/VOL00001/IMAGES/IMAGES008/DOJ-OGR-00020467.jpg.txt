02/21/2022 LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from Bobbi C
Sternheim dated 02/21/2022 re: Letter in Response to Dkt. 605 (Sternheim, Bobbi)
(Entered: 02/21/2022)

02/24/2022 | 607 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's proposed
redactions revised in response to this Court's order. See Dkt. Nos. 605, 606. The Court
has reviewed the proposed redactions and concludes that they are in accordance with
its prior orders. See Dkt. Nos. 596, 605. The narrowly tailored redactions further the
important interests of helping ensure the integrity of any inquiry and maintaining juror
anonymity and privacy. As the Court explained in its February 11 Order, these
interests justify redaction of the questions the parties propose be asked at any hearing
and specific factual information developed by the parties that has not been publicly
reported in the press and that the parties propose be inquired about at any forthcoming
hearing. Dkt. No. 596 at 4 (citing United States v. McCoy et al., No. 14 Cr. 6181
(EAW), Dkt. No. 312 (text order) (W.D.N.Y. May 26, 2017); id. Dkt. No. 329 at
38-39; Press—Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty., 464 U.S. 501,
511-12 (1984)). Accordingly, the parties are ORDERED to docket the redacted briefs,
accompanying exhibits, and their January 13 letters, by February 25, 2022. The Court
will docket Juror 50's motion. As noted in its prior Order, following the Court's
resolution of the Defendant's motion or a hearing, all redactions will be promptly
unsealed except those necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror anonymity
and privacy. See United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 146—47 (2d Cir. 1995); see
also Press—Enter. Co., 478 U.S. at 14. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

02/24/2022 MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO INTERVENE AND
FOR RELEASE OF SEALED JURY QUESTIONNAIRE AND TRANSCRIPT, ON
BEHALF OF PROPOSED INTERVENOR, JUROR 50 as to Ghislaine Maxwell re:
608 MOTION. (ap) (Entered: 02/24/2022)

02/24/2022 | 610 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion &
Order, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the
important interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a
post—verdict hearing is high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that
the demanding standard for holding a post—verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to
whether Juror 50 failed to respond truthfully during the jury selection process to
whether he was a victim of sexual abuse. Following trial, Juror 50 made several direct,
unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets about his own experience that do
not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses
during jury selection. Juror 50's post-trial statements are "clear, strong, substantial and
incontrovertible evidence that a specific, non—speculative impropriety"namely, a false
statement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d 123,
130 (2d Cir. 2018). To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that someone with a
history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential failure
to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that
material information so that any potential bias could be explored. In contrast, the
demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the conduct of
any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a hearing with respect to
the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request for a broader hearing
and pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a hearing take place at
