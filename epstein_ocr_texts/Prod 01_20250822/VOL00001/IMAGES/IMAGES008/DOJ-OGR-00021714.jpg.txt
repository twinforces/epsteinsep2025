sexual harassment or abuse), and 49 (whether he or a
friend or family member had been accused of sexual
harassment or abuse). He explained that, when he was
nine or ten years old, he was sexually abused by a step-
brother, who he no longer considered part of the fam-
ily, and the stepbrother’s friend. He explained that he
answered Question 49 “no” because he no longer con-
sidered the stepbrother part of his family, although he
should have answered “yes.” He also acknowledged
that he should have answered “yes” to Question 25 be-
cause he was a crime victim, although he read the
question at the time to inquire about robbery, mug-
ging, or similar crimes. (A.267-68).

Juror 50 also testified that his failure to disclose
this experience was an inadvertent mistake. He ex-
plained that he “completely skimmed way too fast”
when completing the questionnaire. (A.270-71). He did
so, he explained, in light of the context: he started the
questionnaire after several hours’ waiting in security
lines and after technical issues with the instructions.
He was preoccupied with his own recent romantic
breakup and with disruptions in the jury room. And he
rushed to complete his questionnaire because he
thought it virtually impossible that he would be se-
lected as a juror given the number of people complet-
ing the questionnaire. He did not generally think
about his personal history of sexual abuse, and it did
not occur to him while carelessly speeding through the
questionnaire. (A.269-72).

At oral voir dire, Juror 50 had not been asked the
questions Judge Nathan posed to prospective jurors
who answered affirmatively to questions 25, 48, or 49,
