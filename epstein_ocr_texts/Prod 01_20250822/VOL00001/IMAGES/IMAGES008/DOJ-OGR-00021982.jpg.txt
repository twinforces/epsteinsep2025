1 something else coming up, and I'd like to know what that is.

2 MR. FOY: Well, your Honor, based on our view of the
3 case, I believe there are outside circumstances that are

4 driving this prosecution that may impact certain information

5 that's available to us in the regular discovery.

6 It's hard for me to say without seeing anything, so

7 right now it's just kind of in my mind, and I don't want to

8 mislead the Court to suggest it's all going to be finished in
9 time for April 20. It may be, and that may be fine, but it's
10 hard for me to say having not received or reviewed the

11 discovery. I've only seen the indictment.

12 I'm just alerting the Court. I'm not saying we can't
13 do it, but I don't want to not say it when it's something that
14 could potentially be an issue. I'm not saying we're trying to
15 hold it up or slow down the pace unnecessarily, but I can see
16 getting information that may impact on the defense in

17 particular, Brady material in particular.

18 THE COURT: Brady material?

19 MR. FOY: Correct, but it's hard to say specifically
20 without seeing the discovery.
21 THE COURT: All right. You have not persuaded me.
22 I'm setting the trial for April 20.
23 How long do you expect the trial to go?
24 MS. DONALESKI: Approximately a week, your Honor, for
25 the government's case.
