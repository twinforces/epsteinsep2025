when prosecutors: have used third parties, as leverage: in.plea:negotiations. Numerous courts have’
made clear, however, that .a; plea is Not: invalid, when. entered under an agrecinent ‘that; ineludes aa,
promise of leniency towards:a third party or. in. response'to a‘prosecutor’s threat.tor ‘prosecute a third.
paity if arplea is not entered. See, eg, Wnited:States v. Mar @qtiez, 909 F.2d. 738, 741=42 (2d Cit.
1.990) (rejecting claim that: plea was ‘involuntary because: of pressure‘placed upon a defendant by
the goverhinent’s insistence that a deféndant’s wifewwould not be, offered a plea bargain unless, he
pled. guilty): Martin: v. Kemp, 760 F.2d 1244, 1248 (11th Cir. 1985) (in order to satisfy “heavy
burden “of ‘establishing. ‘that the government had | not: tacted “ ‘in n good: faith,” a defendant chaltenging
the defendant’ S - pregnant, wife had to o establish that government lacked. probable c: cause to believe
the deféndant’s wife Had. coniinitted, a crinte at the ‘tine ‘it threatened, to charge hier); SunsOn V.
State, 839 So.:2d 906, 909. (Fla. App. 2003) (“In cases; involving ... . a:promise:not to prosecute a
third. ‘party, the government must-act, in good faith, ., .. [and] must. have probable cause to charge
the: third: ‘party.”).

The: second. context concerns situations in. which. courts. have enforced. prosecutors’
promises of leniency to third parties. For example, ‘in Stute'v. Frazier, 697 So. 2d.944.(Ela. App.
open. court that the government would. dismiss charges against.the defendant’s niece and nephew,
who had all been, charged asa resultiofthe same incident. When the state reneged and attempted
to prosecute the niece:and nephew, thestrial court dismissed the charges:against them, and the state
appealed. The appellate court affirmed the dismissal, concluding that under contract law
principles, the niece and nephew: were third- party beneficiaries of the: plea agreement and. were:
therefore entitled to enforce it.

Apart from voluntariness or enforceability, concerns, courts have not, suggested. that, a.
prosecutor’s promise: not to prosecute a third.party amounts to: an. inappropriate exercise ‘of
prosecutorial discretion.
