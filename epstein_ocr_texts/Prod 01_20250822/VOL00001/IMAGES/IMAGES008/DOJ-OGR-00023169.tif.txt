4, FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice

FRPC 4-8.4(c) states that a lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,
deceit, or misrepresentation.

FRPC 4-8.4(d) prohibits a lawyer from engaging in conduct in connection with the practice
of law that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.

In Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. 2000), the court noted that FRPC
4-8.4(d) is not limited to conduct that occurs in a judicial proceeding, but can be applied to
“conduct in connection with the practice of law.” In Florida Bar v. Shankman, 41 So. 3d 166, 172
(Fla. 2010), for example, an attorney’s continuous hiring and firing of firms to assist in the client’s
matter resulted in delayed resolution of the case and constituted a violation of FRPC 4-8.4(d) due
to the delay in the administration of justice and the increased costs to the client.7°!

201 OPR also examined FRPC 4-3.8, Special Responsibilities of a Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that rule,
however, was relevant to the issues addressed in this Report. A comment to FRPC Rule 4-3.8 notes that Florida has
adopted the American Bar Association (ABA) Standards of Criminal Justice Relating to the Prosecution Function.
These “standards,” however, are not binding rules of conduct but rather provide guidance to prosecutors. Indeed, the
ABA has expressly stated that these standards “are not intended to serve as the basis for the imposition of professional
discipline, to create substantive or procedural rights for accused or convicted persons, to create a standard of care for
civil liability, or to serve as a predicate for a motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a charge.” OPR does not consider
the ABA standards as binding on the conduct of Department prosecutors.
