OPR evaluated the conduct of cach subject based on his or her individual-role in various
decisions and events and assessed that conduct pursuant to OPR’s analytical framework. OPR.
found that-Acosta:made the:pivotal.decision to.resolve the.federal:inv estigation of Epstein through.
a state-based plea.and either developed. or approved the terins of the initial offer to’ the defense'that:
set the beginning:point for the subsequent negotiations that led:to the NPA. Although.Acosta did.
not sign, the NPA, he participated in its drafting and. approved. it, with knowledge of its terms.
Therefore, OPR. considers. Acosta to be ‘responsible for the NPA. and for the actions ofthe other
subjects who implemented.his ‘decisions.

Based ‘on. its extensive investigation, OPR, concludes ‘that the subjects.'did not commit:
professional misconduct. with : respect to the development, negotiation, and approval of the NPA.
Under, OPR’s. framework,. professional misconduct requires a finding that. a subject .attorney
intentionally or ‘recklessly: violated :a. clear and. unambiguous standard governing: the conduct. at:
issue. OPR found no clear and. unambiguous’ standard that required Acosta to indict Epstein on
‘federal. charges or that prohibited his' decision to defer: ‘prosecution. to the state. Furthetinore, none
of the individual terms ‘of the’ NPA: violated. Department or other. applicable standards.

As the U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under established federal law and
Department: policy to resolve the case: as he deemed necessary. and. appropriate, as long as his:
decision was not, motivated. or influenced ‘by improper: factors. Acosta’s decision to decline to
‘initiate: a federal prosecution. of Epstein was within the scope of ‘his; authority, and. OPR. did, not:
find evidence that, his decision was based on, corruption. or other ‘impermissible considerations,
such as Epstein’s ‘wealth, status, or. associations.. Evidence shows that Acosta resisted defense
efforts ‘to have the. inatter returned ‘to the state ‘for whatever result. state authorities deenied
appropriate, and he refused. to climinate the incarceration and sexual offender registration
requirements., OPR. did not find ¢vidence establishing that Acosta’s. “bréakfast-mecting” with one
of Epstein’s: defense counsel:in.October:2007 led tothe. NPA, which-had been signed wecks earlier,
Or to: aily: other Significant decision that benctited Epstein. The cofitemporancotis records. show
that USAO managers” concerns about legal issues, witness credibility, and’the impact of a trial on
the-victims led them to:prefer a.pre-charge resolution.and that Acosta’s concerns about the proper
state-based resolution. Accordingly, OPR. does::not find that Acosta engaged. in professional.
misconduct by resolving the federal, investigation of, Epstein, i in the way he did or that ‘the other
subjects committed professional misconduct:through.-their implementation. of Acosta’s decisions.

Nevertheless, ORR. concludes that:.Acosta’s. decision. to ‘resolve the federal investigation
through the NPA constitiites: poor judgment. Although this decision was within the scope of
Acosta’s broad discretion and OPR does not.find that it resulted. front improper factors, the: NPA.
was a. flawed.mechanism for satisfying:the federal interest.that.caused the: government to open. its:
investigation of Epstein. In Acosta’s view, the federal government’s role: in, prosecuting Epstein
was limited by. principles of: federalism,-under which the: independent authority of:the state should
be recognized, and: the federal responsibility inthis situation was to serve as a “backstop” to state
authorities; by encouraging them. to do more: However, Acosta failed. to: consider the difficulties
‘inherent in a resolution thatrelied heavily on action by numerous state officials over whom he had
no ‘authority; he resolved. the federal investigation before significant investigative ‘steps were:
coinpleted; and ‘he agreed to several, unusual and problematic terms im the NPA ‘without the
consideration ‘required under ‘the ‘circumstances. In. sum, A’costa’s application. of federalism.
