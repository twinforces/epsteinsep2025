eighteen, and aiding-and abetting‘the. same, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 1591, 2. S2 Indictment,

In‘two prior:pretrial motions, the: Defendant requested.that the Court dismiss two ofthe
‘three conspiracy: counts—that is, Counts One, Three, and.Five—as multiplicitous, given that all
‘three were:premised-on:the Defendant’s:participation:in a single criminal conspiracy with
‘Epstein. To punish-her for all three counts, she argued, would violate:the. Double. Jeopardy,
Clause. In opinions dated.April 1.6, 2021, and. August: 13, 2021, the Court:denied those motions
as premature because the Double Jeopardy Glause:would prohibit only multiple punishments for
the same: offense, butnot indictments for the same offense. United: States v..Maxwell, 534 F.

‘Dkt:‘No.'600.. The Government concedes. that Counts One:and Three:are multiplicitous: and
agrees ‘that the Court should not impose judgment on Count One, but it argues that ‘Counts: Three

‘Impose judgment on both. Gov. ‘Br. at24, Dkt. No. 6211.

‘On. consent of both:parties, the Court will not impose judgment on Count One because it
‘is'multiplicitous. or the-reasons that follow, the:Court further'grants the Defendant’s:motion to

also not enter judgment on Count Count Eive'because it is'also multiplicitous:with Count Three:

! The. original_and;S2‘Indictments also ‘included two counts:of perjury See S21 ndictment 4) 28-31, The Court
