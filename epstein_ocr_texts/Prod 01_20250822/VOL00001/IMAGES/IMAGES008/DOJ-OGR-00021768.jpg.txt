Case 22-1426, Document 87,.07/27/2023, 3548202, Page26 of 35.

"(T]he defense deserves 'a full and fair opportunity to expose bias or prejudice
on the part of veniremen.” United States v. Colombo, 869 F2d 149, 151 (2d Cir.
1989) guoting Barnes 604 F2d at 139. Nieves at 632. Nieves stands for the
proposition that there must be: sufficient fact finding to allow for facts probative of
the three forms of bias to reveal, themselves. Otherwise, a violation of fundamental
fairness arises if the voirdire 1s not adequate: to identify unqualified jurors. Here, the
inquiry by the. Court at the post-verdict hearing failed ‘to provide a full and fair
opportunity to ‘expose bias. While it need not give the defense lawyers the
opportunity to question the juror, it must. fulfill, its constitutional duty to eliciting
sufficient information to allow a:determination of whether a, challenge to ‘the juror
for cause should be:made.

US. v. Greer, 285 F.3d 158, (2d Cir. 2002) ‘set out the types of bias that
produce proper cause challenges. Cause challenges are generally based on one of
three species of bias: (1) actual bias, or "bias in fact"; (2) implied bias, or bias that
is "presumed as .a matter of law" where a typical person in the juror's position would
be biased, irrespective of whether actual bias exists; and (3) inferable bias, which
arises "when. a. juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a.risk of partiality sufficiently.
significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to excuse’ the juror for cause,

but not so great;as to. make mandatory a presumption of bias." 285 F.3d.at.171-172.
