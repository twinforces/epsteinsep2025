intent”); Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (same). “[T]he showing necessary to obtain discovery should itself
be a significant barrier to the litigation of insubstantial claims.” Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464.
“Mere assertions and generalized proffers on information and belief are insufficient” to meet this
burden. Fares, 978 F.2d at 59; see, e.g., Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 470 (affidavits “recount[ing]
hearsay and report[ing] personal conclusions based upon anecdotal evidence” are not sufficient to
justify discovery); Berrios, 501 F.2d at 1211 (affidavit from defendant and attorney that they
“‘believe[d]” there was improper motive and that “hundreds” of similarly situated individuals went
unprosecuted was insufficient); Alameh, 341 F.3d at 174 (defendant’s statistical analysis was
insufficient to merit discovery on selective prosecution claim).

evidence that his prosecution for the charges in the Indictment is discriminatory.

As to the first required prong (discriminatory effect), Thomas has failed to put forth any
evidence that “others similarly situated have not generally been proceeded against because of
conduct of the type forming the basis of the charge against [him].” Fares, 978 F.2d at 59 (internal

conduct institutional counts or rounds and an inmate committed suicide,” and one of the four
officers involved was given a suspension. (Mot. 6). But Thomas is not charged with failing to
conduct counts, he is charged with making false statements about those counts. Even assuming
