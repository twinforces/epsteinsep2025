11/09/2021 | 427 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Attached is the Court's revised draft preliminary
remarks to be recorded and played before each voir dire session. The Court is in
receipt of the Government's letter approving of the remarks, Dkt. No. 420, and the
Defendant's proposed additions, Dkt. No. 419. The revised remarks adopt all but one
of the Defendant's proposals because the Court's subsequent revisions eliminated that
portion of the script. In particular, the Court has made three additional changes in
order to accurately explain the logistics of voir dire. Each of these changes is reflected
in redline. The parties are ORDERED to indicate by letter on or before November 11,
2021 at 12:00 p.m. whether or not they have any objections or suggestions the Court's
revised preliminary remarks to be played before each voir dire session. Attached is
also the Court's revised draft voir dire in redline. The Court's revisions simplify the
phrasing of questions 1, 2, 3, 10, 13, 25, and 37 in an effort to maximize the time
dedicated to questioning each prospective juror. The revision to question 11 reflects
the Court's oral ruling on November 1, 2021 regarding the use of pseudonyms for
certain witnesses. The revisions to questions 9, 13, 14, 15, 20, 21, and 33 are
non-substantive changes to question numbers in order to accurately reference the
corresponding question numbers on the jury questionnaire or are grammatical changes.
Attached is also the Court's draft instruction sheet for those jurors who are not struck
for cause and will return for the exercise of peremptory strikes, as discussed at the
November 1 conference. The parties are FURTHER ORDERED to indicate by letter
on or before November 12, 2021 whether or not they have any objections or
suggestions to the revised voir dire and draft instruction sheet. Finally, the parties are
ORDERED to jointly submit the list of individuals and locations who may be
mentioned at trial for questions 11 and 12 of the voir dire on or before November 14,
2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 11/9/2021) (Inl)
