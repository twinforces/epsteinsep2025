8 that the defendant was aware that the massages were sexualized.

11 Virginia for the first time, and that Virginia visited the
12 residence later that day. Flight records and credible witness

15 the residence, the defendant greeted them and instructed
16 Virginia to show Carolyn -- quoting from the trial record ——

25 Epstein's residence, claiming that Carolyn's recollection is
