was just:confusing;.and when people are.confused,
‘tones can get rdised: Nobody, ever'yelled at-other
people. People’would just:speak, ‘sounding frustrated.

‘So, we [realized] we had:to come up with a néw. game

plan and that game plan‘was, we're going'to'talk to each

other:with compassion.'

According to:Scotty‘once the jurors'had found.a way to
‘understand’ each other: they worked methodically.
ithrough each count starting with counti2.

‘This was:the only:charge.on;which;:they did not;convict

signed an éarliér £370,000 ($500,000) legal settlement
with pedophile Jeffrey. Epstein, the duke's friend.

Miss Roberts,’38; one of the billionaire‘sex offender's
most high-profile victims, claims she Was trafficked by:
him and girlfriend Ghislaine Maxwell to have sex.with:
Andréw.on three occasions when'she was 17.

The 61-year-old prince: vehemently denies the claims
and says he has no recollection of even meeting her:

Judge Kaplan appeared mostly dismissive of the
arguments by the duke's lawyer, Andrew Brettler.

He said that part of, the 2009 settlement protecting
‘other potential defendants’ that Andrew's lawyers, had
appeared to be leaning on was ‘unclear’ and pointed to
two sentences in the'text that seemed to’suggest it
could not be lised by. Andrew..

Judge Kaplan also pointed to language in the agreement:
stating it is,‘not intended to be'used by any other person’
to protect themselves from lawsuits without the:
agreement of Miss Roberts and Epstein - again
suggesting Andrew could not raly on it.

While he did not immediately:rule at the end of the
hearing; he made clear that he was not leaning Andrew's
Way as he rejected mitch of the reasoning offered by Mr
Brettler,. who said the.case ‘should absolutely be.
dismissed’.

Judge Kaplan told .the two sides: 'l appreciate the:
arguments and the passion. You'll have the decision
pretty.soon:’ But he directed that the exchange of
potential evidence in the case was,.to proceed as
scheduled - which was'seen as‘an indication he would.
likely rule against Andrew's motion.

Sources close to the proceedings yesterday described
them as ‘brutal’ for. Andrew..During the hour-long
hearing, held via video conference due to Covid,.Judge
Kaplan interjected several times ‘in Mr Brettler's
arguments.

He told him once: ‘With all due respect, Mr Brettler,
that’s not a‘dog that's going to hunt here’ and another
time asked the lawyer outright: 'So what?’
