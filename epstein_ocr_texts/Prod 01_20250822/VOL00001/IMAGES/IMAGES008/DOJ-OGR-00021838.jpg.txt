the district in which the plea is entered unless it affirmatively appears that the
agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” Jd. The Court concluded that,

Papa, however, provides no support for the rule the Second Circuit

follows. ... Although Papa held that the plea agreement did not bind

other districts because the evidence revealed an intent to bind only one

district, the Second Circuit apparently has broadly interpreted this case

as meaning that plea agreements do not bind other districts absent an
