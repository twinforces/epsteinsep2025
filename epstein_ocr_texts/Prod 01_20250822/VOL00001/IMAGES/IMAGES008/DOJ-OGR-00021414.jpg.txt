proceedings as “other relief” to: which, they were entitled. Sloman also stated that: the VRRA

of char ges, and the: acceptance of a plea. ais (Emphasis 1 in original). Sloman added:

Just as in 18 U.S.C. § 377], [the CVRA], ‘these sections ‘are: ‘not.
limited -to: proceedings in a federal district: court. Our Non-
Prosecution Agreement resolves the federal investigation by
allowing Mr. Epstein, to: plead to a state offense. The victims
‘identified: through, the ‘federal investigation, should be appropriately
informed, and.our-Non-Prosecution Agreement does not require the
USS. Attormey’s Office to ‘forego [sic] its legal obligations?!”

Sloman also addressed. the defense: objection to advising the victims to contact Villafata ‘or the:
EBI case agent. with questions or concerns: “Again, federal law requires that victims have: the.
“reasonable right to confer with the attorney, for the Government. in this case.” Sloman advised.
the defense; “The three victims who were ‘notified, prior'to your objection had. questions directed.
to Mr. Epstein’s punishment, not the civil litigation. Those’questions are‘appropriately directed.to
law. enforcement.”

Along with this letter, Slonian forwarded to Lefkowitz for comment a-revised draftivictin

letter stated that “the federal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein has been completed,” Epstein would.

and Epstein. would compensate: victims for damage claims brought under 18 U.S.C. § 2255. The

letter provided specific information concerning the upcoming change of plea heating:
