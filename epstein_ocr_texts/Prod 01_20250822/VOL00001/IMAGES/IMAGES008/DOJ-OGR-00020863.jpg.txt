activily that occurred in New Mxi:co, that ‘wouldn't be a
sufficicit basis to convict on Count Four of ‘Cotnt Two becatsec
it requires an intent to violate New York law, and -you can't
violate this. section of New York Jiawsin New M xi co.

So if that's all they're considered on a, basis ‘to
convict on, Count Four and ‘Count Two, then that would be
insufficient and improper, and that's why I think a
suppl enental instruction that clarifies that point is) warranted
in this case, but TI umderstand the Court has rejected that.

And that's all.

THE COURT: JT think the instruction is correct that I
referred themto. The reading of the note that ‘you! ve
suggested, I have no idea if that's what the jury is asking or
many other plausible t¢adings, and, what you've proposed, as you
just indicated, would. be incorrect. So, I think that*s why
precisely we sent them, back to the charge.

Anything clse?

MR: EVERDELL: No, your Honor.

THE COURT: As, I Said, ‘We'll s@e@ Where We are at the
end of the day, ‘but in light of the variant, my concern about
interruption of trial, ‘given the increasing daily risk of
exposure to either a ‘juror or trial participant requirin g
to continue deliberatimg until, a verdict is reached.
