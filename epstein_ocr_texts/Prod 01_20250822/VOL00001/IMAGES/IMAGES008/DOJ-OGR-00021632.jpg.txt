1 terrible chapter to the end, to an end. And to those of you

2 who spoke here today and to those of you who did not, may this
3 day help you travel from darkness into the light.

4 Thank you, your Honor.

5 THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Maxwell.

6 Counsel, is there anything else —- I'm sorry, let

7 me —- I do want to ask defense counsel, before I get there, if
8 there are any objections to any of the conditions recommended
g by the Probation Department with respect to supervised release.
10 MS. STERNHEIM: No, Judge.

11 THE COURT: Okay. And I understand the government is
12 not —- I just want to talk about restitution before I get to
13 the statement of judgment.

14 Count Six is mandatory restitution, but the

15 government's position is that no restitution should be ordered
16 because all victims have been compensated.

17 MS. MOE: That is correct, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: Counsel, is there anything else I should
19 consider or any reason why sentence should not be imposed at
20 this time?
21 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you.
22 MS. STERNHEIM: No.
23 THE COURT: All right. Let me gather my thoughts for
24 one moment.
