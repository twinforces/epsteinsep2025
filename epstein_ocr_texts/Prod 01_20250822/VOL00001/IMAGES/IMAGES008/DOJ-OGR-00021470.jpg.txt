particular:charges and-victims; at issue. Once the hearing:was scheduled, Sloman told. Villafana‘to
contact PBPD Chief Reiter about notifying’the victims, and. on June 28, 2008, she reported back:
to Sloman. that Reiter “is going to notify victims: about the plea.*!* ‘Villafaia:recalled that she:
sent Reiter 4 list of the girls identified as victims during'the federal investigation, and Reiter said
he would “contact.as many. as he could.” The: contemporancous records do ‘not ‘show how. many
or which Victims, ifany, Reiter contacted, and.no Victims Were present inthe courtroom. No:victiin
who provided information. to OPR,.cither in’ ‘person. or through her attorney, recalled receiving,
notice of the plea hearing: from federal or state officials. -At the time Epstein pled. guilty: in state:
court,’no one in the USAO knew exactly who, if anyone, Reiter or the: State Attorney’s Office had
notified about:the proceeding. Accordingly, Villatafia, who was present in the: courtroom for the:
hearing, had no knowledge to whom Belohlavek referred when, she told the court that the victims
were: “in agreement with:the terms of this plea.”*!?

OPR. considered. whether Acosta’s decision. to defer to the State:.Attorney’s Office the
decision to notify Victims ofthe scheduled. date’ for Epstein’s plea hearing constitiited professional.
misconduct. OPR.could:not.conclude that:the CVRA or VRRA provisions in question, requiring,
notice:of:any public:procceding involving the:crime against the-victim or that the victim is entitled.
to attend, unambiguously required federal prosecutors to‘notify victims of-state court proceedings.
Furthermore, as discussed previously, OLC had issued. guidance ‘stating that. the GVRA did not:
apply to cases in which, no federal charges had been filed.*°” Moreover; the section of the VRRA.
requiring notice of court proceedings that the’victim is; ‘entitled to: attend” referred specificallyto
proceedings under 42 U.S.C § 10606(b)(4),. which, at the time of the Epstein case, had become
part.of the GVRA (18 U.S.C. § 37711 (a)(2)).7!

Because: Acosta had no clear or unambiguous duty ‘to inform victims identified. in the
federal.investigation of the state: plea hearing, OPR-concludes:that:his decision ‘to defer to-the State:
Attorney the decision to notify victims of the: state’s plea hearing and the ‘responsibility for doing
so: did.not constitute:professional misconduct.*?*

ais Sloman replied, “Good?” In,her written response to: OPR;. Villafafia:stated. “requested permission to make:
oral:notifications:to the victims revarding:the upcoming’change of ‘plea, but the Office decided that victim notification.
could only:come from:a stateinv esligator: and.Jet£ Sloman asked;PBPD:Chief Reiter to assist?”
