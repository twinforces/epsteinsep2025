‘prejudicial variance. For'the. following reasons, ‘the Court disagrees and denies. the Defendant's
‘motion on this; basis.
A. Applicable. Law

‘Under the Fifth.Amendment’s Grand Jury Clause, “a defendant ‘has the:right'to be tried,
only on charges, contained in an ‘indictmentreturned by:a grand jury:” United States -v. Wozniak,
126 F.3d ‘105, 109 (2d Gir. 1997). “[W]hen the: charge upon. which. the defendantiis tried:differs
significantly from‘the. charge upon.which the grand.jury-voted,”.a-constructive amendment
occurs. and reversal is required. United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293 (2d Gir. 2021).

“To-prevail, on. a:constructive amendment claim, a defendant'must demonstrate that either,
‘the proof'at trial or'the trial court’s jury“instructions so, altered:an essential. clement of the charge.
‘that, upon.review, it qs uncertain:whether. the defendant was convicted ofconduct*that was the
subject of the grand j ury’s indictment:” Uniled:States v. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 608, 620.(2d Cir:
2003) (quoting United Staies v. Frank, 156 F.3d.332, 337 (2d Cir. 1998)). ‘In-making this
determination, ‘the Court first delineates the: “core of criminality” of the crimealleged. United
States-v. Gross, No. 15-cr-769.(AIN), 2017 WL 4685 LLL, at #20 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 18,2017), aff'd
sub nom. United States v. Lebedev,,932 F.3d 40 (2d Cir. 2019). The “core of criminality ....
‘involves the ‘essence of a crime, ‘in general terms.” United States v. Darigerdas, 837 F.3d-212,
225 (2d.Cir. 20.16) (alteration ‘in original) (quoting United States v. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d 412, 418
(2d:Cir.'2012)). The: Court then determines whether the evidence or‘jury instructions ‘at trial
created a “substantial likelihood” thatthe defendant?was ‘not convicted ‘of the crime described in.
that:core, butzinstead of a crime “distinctly: different.” .D ‘Amelio,'683 F.3d at:416,419. The
Second:Circuit has “consistently permitted significant flexibility in proof, proyided that the

defendant was given notice of the! core of criminality to be’proven. at trial.” United. States ‘v:
