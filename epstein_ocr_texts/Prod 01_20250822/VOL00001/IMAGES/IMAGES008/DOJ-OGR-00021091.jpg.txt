Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page44 of 113:

anticipate, disregard the NPA’s carefully-crafted text for the Government’s benefit,
and violate settled. canons within.the Eleventh Circuit (and every: other circuit).for
construing such. agreements. See'Jefferies, 908 F.2d at 1523; Rowe, 676 F.2d at
526 n.4.

The: Government will likely respond that, on. matters. of federal. common law,
this Court should apply the /ex fora without regard ‘to regional, circuit differences.
But in. criminal cases, differences in. circuit law can affect the Constitution’s
guarantees. This principle is illustrated by the inter-circuit: exclusionary: ‘rule:
where a. search. or seizure is executed in one’circuit but the defendant. is charged, in
a different circuit, courts will look to the law of the circuit where ‘the search or
seizure happened to. “ensure[] that the proper level. of deterrence. is maintained in
the locale where the violation occurred.” U.S. v. Restrepo, 890 F.Supp. 180, 191

(E.D.N.Y. 1995) (Weinstein, J.); see also U.S. v. Ozuna, 129 F.Supp.2d 1345, 1354

from ‘parachuting into a new circuit and prosecuting a.case it would not otherwise
have been able to bring. That rationale applies. with equal force here. Like: the
Fourth Amendment in the search and, seizure context, the Fifth Amendment
requires courts ‘to hold the Government ‘to a minimum standard of conduct in, the

plea-bargaining ‘process. See U.S. v. Pelletier, 898 F.2d 297, 302. (2d Cir. 1990)
