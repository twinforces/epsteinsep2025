1 MS. MOE: No, your Honor.
2 MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, I would just like to make
3 one statement, if I may. With regard to the fine, the Court
4 indicated the bequest in the will. I just want the record to
5 reflect that that is an unactualized bequest, as Ms. Maxwell
6 has received nothing, and it is the expectation that she will
7 receive nothing.
8 THE COURT: I understand. And to be clear, I am not
g finding and accept that she hasn't received anything, but there
10 have only been nonspecific claims that she won't receive
11 anything and there are additional assets that lead me to the
12 conclusion that she is able to pay the fine.
LS MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you, Judge.
14 THE COURT: Thank you.
15 And just to confirm, Ms. Sternheim, any legal reason
16 why the sentence should not be imposed as stated other than
17 what already was argued?
18 MS. STERNHEIM: No, your Honor, but I do have requests
19 for recommendation.
20 THE COURT: I will get there. Thank you.
21 The sentence as stated is imposed. I do find the
22 sentence is sufficient but not greater than necessary to
23 satisfy the sentencing purposes that I described earlier.
24 Ms. Maxwell, when you are released and on supervised
25 release, you will have the guidance and support of the
