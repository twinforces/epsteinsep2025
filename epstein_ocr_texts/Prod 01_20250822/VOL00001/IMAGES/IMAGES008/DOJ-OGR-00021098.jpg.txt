foresee.”), aff'd, 867 F.2d 1425 (2d Cit. 1988).

Unlike standard. non-prosecution. agreements, the NPA here was heavily
negotiated. Negotiations ‘began. in January 2007, lasted for ‘a period of eight
months, and were “extensive” and involved the Department of Justice. The parties
exchanged. several drafts of an altermative plea agreement under which Epstein
would have pled guilty to a federal. offense. See, e.g., Dkt 142, Exh. E (9/15/07
email from ‘Villafana to Lefkowitz attaching draft information and ‘plea
agreement); Dkt 142, Exh. F (draft plea, agreement). Notably, those drafts of the
plea agreement, unlike the NPA, expressly defined ‘the term “United States” as

limited to the: United States Attorney: for the SDEL.

The Office: of Professional Responsibility’s Report of the USAO-SDFL’s
resolution of its 2006-2008 investigation of Epstein (“OPR”) (Dkt 142, Exh. A),
reflects that negotiations involved the entire hierarchy of the USAO for the SDFL,
all of whom. signed. off on. the NPA. Senior levels of Main, Justice were directly
involved in, ‘the negotiation and approval of the NPA, even, to the extent that
separate presentations regarding the NPA were :made to, and approval of the NPA
was obtained. from, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General. Further, the NPA
itself reflects the involvement of the FBI. A174; Dkt 142, Exh. A. at 1-2, 94-97,
