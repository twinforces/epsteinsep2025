NPA.*!°” The FBI reports of the victim interviews; do not: mention the NPA ‘or indicate that the:
victims were asked for their input regarding the resolution of the case. Villafatia acknowledged
that she and the case’ agents did. not tell any of the “new” ‘ post-NPA- -signing' ‘victims ‘about the
agrecinent. because “at that point-we believed thatthe NPA was fever going to be-perforined. and
that we were in fact going to be:[charging] ‘Mr. Epstein.”

On, October 12, 2007, the FBI Victim Specialist sent‘a VNS forin, notice letterto:a- victim,
the:ease agents.had interviewed two days earlier. This letter was identical to the VNS form notice:
letter the FBI Victim Specialist sent to other’ victims before ‘the NPA. was signed, describing the
case as “under: investigation” rand requesting the. victim’s ' “patience.” The letter listed the eight
CVRA.- tights; but made no mention ofthe NPA of the. § 2255. provision: Villafana;told OPR. she
was unaware. the FBI sent the letter, but she ‘knew * ‘there were. efforts to make: sure that we. had
identified all victims of the crimes under investigation.” In response to OPR’S.questions about the
accuracy of the FBI letter’s. characterization. of the case: as “under investigation,” Villafana told.
OPR that:the NPA required Epstein to: enter a. plea by October 26, 2008, and “at-this point we
weren’t actively looking for ‘additional. charges,” but “the ‘investigation wasn’t. technically
suspended.until he completed all the-terms: of'the NPA.”

D. ‘The USAO Informs the Defense That It Intends to Notify Victims. by Letter
‘about Epstein’s. State ‘Plea Hearing’ and. ‘the Resolution of the Federal.
Investigation, but’the Defense Strongly Objects to the Notification. Plan

In. anticipation of Epstein’s state. court plea, Villafatia reported on November 16,2007, to
Acosta, Sloman, and: other supervisors ‘that..she had learned, from FBI agents who met with,
Assistant State Attorney. Belohlavek, that the State Attorney’s Office wanted the USAO to notify:
victiins of the state:plea hearing.

[Belohlavek] would still like’us to do ‘the Victim notifications. The:
‘State does. not havea procedure (like: we do federally) where the
‘Courthas:to provide a separate:room for victims who want‘to attend.
judicial. proceedings, so I. do ‘not know how many victims will.
actually want to be present.

Belohlavek: told OPR that she did not.recall the conversation referenced. by the FBI nor any
coordination, between her office ahd federal officials to contacti or notify Victiins about Epstcin’s.
state plea hearing.

‘On, November, 19,2007, Villafana decided that to avoid any ‘misconduct accusations from.
the: ‘defense about the information. given ‘to. victims, she “would. put the victim notification in

a0 Not all the individuals interviewed, qualified for inclusion ‘on-the; victim, list. For-example, ‘one: would, not:
cooperate with‘investigators;.a Second.claimed to:have simply massaged Epstein. with.no sexual’ activ ity; ‘and’ a third
c¢laimed-she had no contact with E pstein:

au Villafafia;told OPR.that:she understood. the state took-the: position that:because-“there was, cither-only‘one or
two victimstiivolved ‘in-theircase,” they “could not?do victim-notifications:to all ofthe victims.”
