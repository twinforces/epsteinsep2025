cite seme: cases for that. proposition. Watkins 667 F.3d at. 265;
United States v. Streb, 36 F.4th 782. That's anda Bighth

Circuit. case from 2022. Courts have repeatealy concludea that
a minor can be: the victim of undue influence even if the minor

initiates a sexual meeting. See, for example; United States v.

Lay, 583 F.30 436 (6h Cir. 2009). I therefore overrule the
aefendant's objection.
I next turn to the government*s only objection to the

PSR Guideline calculation. I do find that Virginia Roberts and

Melissa were minon vietims of sex, offenses they ‘were

trafficked and abused by the defendant and Epstein during the

chargea perioo. The Guidelines require that ‘each minor victim
be consicerea a separate cotnt of conviction. 2G61.1.(0)1.

Probation oépartitent éExGludeéd Virginia ana Melissa from this

provision only because they were not namea in the indictment.
This is an incorrect basis for .excluoing them from the
caletlation. ‘Relying on commentary by the ‘Commission, the
Secona Circuit has instructed "that conduct against. victims
other than those chargeo in the inoictment may constitute
relevant condtct, ana, if sich conauct qualifies, shoula be
trédtea fof senténeing purposes dS though it Océurrea in a
separate count of conviction." I Uniteo States V. Wernick,
691, F.3d 108 (20 Cir, 2012) (citing 2G1.1 comment note 4). 1
therefore Consicoér Virginia ano Mélissa as two adoitional
groups of victims and assign each a unit under Section 3D1.4.
