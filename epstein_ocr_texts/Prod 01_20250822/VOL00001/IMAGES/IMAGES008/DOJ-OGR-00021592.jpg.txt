1 cite some cases for that proposition. Watkins 667 F.3d at 265;
2 United States v. Streb, 36 F.4th 782. That's and Eighth
3 Circuit case from 2022. Courts have repeatedly concluded that
4 a minor can be the victim of undue influence even if the minor
5 initiates a sexual meeting. See, for example, United States v.
6 Lay, 583 F.3d 436 (6h Cir. 2009). I therefore overrule the
7 defendant's objection.
8 I next turn to the government's only objection to the
9 PSR Guideline calculation. JI do find that Virginia Roberts and
10 Melissa were minor victims of sex offenses -- they were
11 trafficked and abused by the defendant and Epstein during the
12 charged period. The Guidelines require that each minor victim
13 be considered a separate count of conviction. 2G1.1.(d)l.
14 Probation department excluded Virginia and Melissa from this
15 provision only because they were not named in the indictment.
16 This is an incorrect basis for excluding them from the
17 calculation. Relying on commentary by the Commission, the
18 Second Circuit has instructed "that conduct against victims
19 other than those charged in the indictment may constitute
20 relevant conduct, and, if such conduct qualifies, should be
21 treated for sentencing purposes as though it occurred in a
22 separate count of conviction." I United States V. Wernick,
23 691, F.3d 108 (2d Cir. 2012) (citing 2G1.1 comment note 4). I
24 therefore consider Virginia and Melissa as two additional
25 groups of victims and assign each a unit under Section 3D1.4.
