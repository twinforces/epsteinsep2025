the: PBPD: during its investigation. into Epstein’s conduct. Absent. information :from the USAO,
the. state would, not have been. in a; position to notify those additional victims: of. the state plea,
proceeding, even. if the State: Attorney: had decided to: include other-victims identified. duri ing the
state investigation. Furthermore, atthe time he made his decision, Acosta had already been advised
by. Villafafia. that ‘Belohlavek, in. November 2007, had. requested that the USAO ‘notify victims,
presumably those identified during the ‘federal, investigation, about the state plea hearing:

Acosta. told OPR that it had been. his; understanding at: the time of Epstein’s plea, that the
victiins would be made aware of the proceeding and would have.an opportunity to speak., Acosta,
also told OPR.that he expected the state. would have “notified [the victims] that:that was an.all-
encompassing: plea, that the state court sentence would also, mean thatthe federal governinent-was
not proceeding.” There is no evidence, however, that: he:verified this understanding with. Sloman
or Villafana, let alone. ‘the State Attorney. OPR. found no indication that Acosta ever
communicated, ordirected Sloman/‘or Villafana'to communicate,-his.decision to the-State Attorney
Of to provide the State Attorney’s Office With,.a. conmpléte list of Victiins identified, during the:
federal. investigation. OPR located a.draft letter to the State Attorney’s Office that Villafana
prepared. and forwarded to Acosta in December 2007, which did. provide:such information, but.
OPR, found ‘no evidence that. the. letter was ever sent,,and it was not. among materials ‘publicly
released from. the State Attorney’s Office.°* OPR also found evidence that. both Sloman. and.
Villafana interacted with the State Attorney’s Office in, the months leading up'to the June 30, 2008
plea hearing, but there: is.:no indication. that ‘they discussed ‘victim. notification: issues. with ‘that
office, and. Villafana’s last minute: request to PBPD ‘Chief Reiter to notify victims indicates that,
the USAO had:not.coordinated with the State: Attorney’s Office. ‘Belohlavek told OPR.that no one:
from the USAO provided. her with. a list of victims or coordinated any notification. of victims ‘to:
appear at. the: hearing.

Krischer and Belohlavek were thus evidently unaware’ that Acosta had decided to leave it.
to them ‘to decide whether ‘to notify victims about the state proceeding. In. the absence ‘of some
discussion, of which or how many‘victims the state intended to notify, whatthe state intended. to
tell them about Epstein’s plea, and:whether the state ‘intended to ‘let‘the victims speak at the plea
hearing, Acosta:had no way'to ensure that his assuinption.about; victim notification was.accurate.
Tn.other:words, Acosta failed.to plan for how all of the:identified victims: of-Epstein’s crimes, both.
federal, and state, “would be. aware of what. was happening in, the state court and. have an.
opportunity to speak. upvat the state court. hearing.”

OPR did-not find-evidence that Acosta acted. for the:purpose of excluding victims from the.
plea hearing, and. Acosta’s assumption that'the state tewould handle victim notification appropriately
Florida: Constitution, “and: the state prosecution offices have: victim witness ‘s personnel, resources,
and processes. to help accomplish notification. However, Acosta was. aware—through, the
prosecution memoranda, the draft indictment, and email. communications: s-ftor ‘om Villafaia— that the:

aa The text of theletter indicated that Epstein’s attorncys:asked the; CSAO‘not to inform victims of “any rights:
they-may have.ay Victims Of the charges : tiled by'the. State-Attorney’s Office” and that the CSAO was prov idiny the.
State Attorney*s/Office with-a list ofthe 33 identified, federal victims “incase you.are required ‘to provide themrwith,

any ‘further notification regarding their: rights under: Florida law.”
