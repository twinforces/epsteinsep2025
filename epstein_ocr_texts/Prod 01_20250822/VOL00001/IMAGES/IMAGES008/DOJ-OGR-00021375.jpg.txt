Epstein’s state guilty plea.°*’ As U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the authority to:resolve the case in.
this. manner; but:OPR concludes that-in light of all'the surrounding circumstances, his decision to
do so:reflected: ‘poor judgment. Acosta’s application of Petite policy’ principles was too expansive,

his view of. the federal iiterest. in. prosccuting Epstein was too narrow, and. his ‘understanding of.
the: state ‘system was too. imperfect to. justify the decision.to use the. NPA!

B. The Assessment: of the Merits of a Potential Federal Prosecution Was
Undermined by the Failure to Obtain Evidence or Take Other Investigative
Steps That Could Have Changed the ‘Complexion of the ‘Case:

The leniency resulting, from Acesta’s décision to résolve'the casé through the NPA is also
troubling because the: USAO. reached agreement. on the ‘terms’ of the: NPA without fully pursuing,
evidence: that could. have changed the: complexion. of the case or afforded the USAO significant:
leverage in, negotiating with Epstein. Acosta told OPR that his decision to resolve the: federal,
‘investigation through the NPA was, in ‘part, duc: to. concerns: about: the: merits of the case and.
concerns about, whether the government could. win at trial. Yet, Acosta nade the: decision to
resolve the case through :a state-based resolution. and, extended:that proposal. to Epstein’s: defense:
attorneys before the ‘investigation was completed. As the investigation, progressed, the FBI.
continued to locate additional victims,,and many. had not been. interviewed by. the EBI-by the time
of the initial offer: In other words, at'the tinte of Acosta’s decision, the USAO did not know the
full scope of. Epstein’ s conduct: whether, given: Epstein’ s other domestic: and. foreign residences,
his ¢fiiinal conduet had occurred in other locations: of Whether ‘the additional victims might
implicate: other offenders. In addition, Villafania planned. to approach the: female assistants to
atteinpt'to obtain, cooperation, butthat step had:not been ‘taken: 252" Most importantly, Acosta ended
the: investigation without the USAO having obtained an important. category. of ‘potentially
significant,evidenee: the computers removed from Epstein?s home:prior to the PBPD’s execution
of'a ‘search warrant.

The PBPD knew. that Epstein had surveillance cameras’ stationed. in and around his home,
which potentially captured videoevidence of:people visiting his residence, and:that before the state:

anu Acosta‘told OPR. that‘he understood thatit Epstein, had. pled: to the original:charges contemplated: by‘the:state.

he would have receivedia two-year sentenceyand ir ‘that circumstance, the: PBPD would:not have broughi the caseito

Chief wasidissatistied with'the. state's Handling ofthe matter:

Ji; conimenting on OPR’s dial report. Acosta’s attorney. stated. that Acosta “accept[ed] OPR"S conchision
that:deferring prosecution of Jeffrey: Epstein.to the State. Attorney:rather than proceeding: wi ith, a‘tederal indictmentor
a‘féderal plea was’ ivhindsisht, poor jlidgment.” Acosta, also.acknie xledged | thatthe USAO'S haiidling of the mater
“would have benclited trom.more:consistent'staffing and attention. No, one foresaw: the additional challenges that:the’
