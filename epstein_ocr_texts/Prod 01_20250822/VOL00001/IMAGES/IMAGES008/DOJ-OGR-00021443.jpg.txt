F. 2010 - 2011: = Department and Congressional. Actions Regarding.
Interpretation of the CVRA.

In:connection with the: Department’s 2010 effort ‘to update: its 2005 Guidelines, the Office:
‘of the: Deputy Attorney General convened-a Victim. of Crimes Wo king Group that: asked OLG*to:
revisit its 2005 preliminary. review ‘concerning ‘the definition of “crime victim” under the CVRA
and solicited input concerning’the issue from Department components and federal law enforeement:
agencies. In. response, OLG- issued ia December. 17, 2010 opinion entitled, .The Availability of
Grime Victims’ Rights Under the Grime Vietins Rights Act of 2004. Based on the CVRA’s

language, relevant ‘case: law, and. memoranda _ppinions f from Department. components, OLC:
(by. complaint, information, or indictment) and the. rights c cease to be available if’ ‘all char ges a are
dismissed either voluntarily or on the merits (or ifthe [g]overninient declines to bring formal.
charges after the filing of a complaint).”*”*

AfterOLC issued its opinion, the Department-revised the 2005:Guidelines‘in, October 201 1.
but did not:change its fundamental position that the CVRA rights did not vest.until after criminal
charges were filed. The 20] | ‘revision did, however, add language concerning victim consultation
before a defendant is charged: “In circumstances where plea negotiations occur before a case has
been, brought, Departnent policy. is that this should include reasonable consultation prior to the
filing ofa char ging instrument with the court”? The use of the word “should” inthe 2011
Guidelines indicates that. “personnel, are expected to take ‘the action .. . uriless there is an,
appropriate, articulable reason not to ‘do so.”**° ‘Nevertheless, the: required consultation. ° ‘may be:
general i in, fature” and “does not; have to be specific’to a particular plea. offer.**! The revisions.
also specified that AUSAs. were to ensure that victims. had.a right to be reasonably ‘heard atplea

‘On. November.2, 2011. U.S. Senator Jon. Kyl, a:co-sponsor, of the CVRA, sent a letter ‘to
Attorney General Eric Holder; arguing that ‘the 2011 Guidelines revisions “conflict[ed] quite
clearly with:the CVRA’s plain:language” because the 2011 Guidelines, didnot extend.any rights
to wiétims ‘Until, charges. have been. filed.” The Departinent’s response emphasized. that. the
