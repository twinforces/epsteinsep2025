D. —‘ The Parties Continue to Negotiate. but Primarily Focus on-a Potential Plea to
Federal Charges

During:the remainder‘of September, Villafana conducted plea negotiations and drafted the
final NRA, mainly with Epstein attorney Jay Lefkowitz. Ina Septemiber [3, 2007 email'to CEOS
Chief Oosterbaan, Villafafia reported. that the plea negotiations were “getting fast. and. furious.”
She said:that;the defense wanted.to establish.a ““wictim’s fund” through which.Epstein could make
payments to the: victims, rather than. having the ‘victims; file individual $2255 court actions :for
damages, which she speculated’ was “to keep 'this stuff out of the public’ [c]ourt, files.”

According: to thé cimail doctimerntation, by Friday, Septeinber 14, 2007, the parties had.
moved toward a “hybrid” federal plea agreement, ‘incorporating a plea to state: charges, which,
would allow Epstein, to. serve his sentence.:for all the charges concurrently :in.a federal, prison.
Villafana informed Acosta, Sloman, Lourie, and-other:collcagues’that-negotiations with Lefkowitz,
had resulted. in.a tentative agreement. for Epstein, to plead to ‘two. federal. charges: ‘harassment.to
prevent a witness from reporting a crime (18. U.S.C. § 1512(4)(), ‘which ‘was then,:a. one- year’
misdemeanor), and simple assault: on an. airplane. (18 U.S.C. § 113(aj(5), :a six-month.
misdemeanor). Villafana. reported that Lefkowitz “put. in a pitch for only 12 months, I putin a,
pitch that [Epstein] plead to 24 with a 20-month-recommendation, and we decided: that‘we would
be stuck'with the I'S moriths.””

Later‘that.day, Villafana.sent to Lefkowitz a'draft“*hybrid” plea agreement and.information
mirroring the:agreement-in principle she.had described. to-her supervisors, but which she noted had
“not yet been’blessed” by them. The agreement provided that Epstein would plead guilty to the
two federal, charges for which, the partics would jointly. recommend ‘that: he be sentenced ‘to: the
statutory maximunr penalty of 1.8 months’ imprisonment:followed by 2 years of supervised release,
and that he would also plead. guilty to ‘the state registrable offense. of procurement of, minots ‘to
engage in. prostitution, for which ‘Epstein and. the: State Attorney’s Office would. make a joint,
binding recommendation that-he be sentenced to seive at least, 20:moriths'it-prison followed by 10
months of community. control. (home:confinement). Although not:specified.in the draft agreement,
the-negotiations evidently expected: the federal and state-tefins would-run concurrently: Tn. addition
to ‘payment of restitution, Epstein. would not oppose jurisdiction or victim status for any of: the
victims identified ‘in the ‘federal. investigation—at. that point specified as numbering 40—who
elected to file: suit.for damages under 18 U.S.C. § 2255. A, guardian ad litem would be appointed
to communicate with,the defense on the victims* behalf:

Lourie, however, quickly made clear‘that‘he was not in favor.of the proposal. In response
to Villafana’s cinail about-the potential federal, charges, but. after Villafana sent the. proposal tO
Lefkowitz, Lourie told her, “The. assault [charge] ‘sounds. like’a stretch and. factually [is] sort of
silly?!" Louie also, told Sloman, Acosta, and, another Supervisor that hé did not “like the assault:
charge?’ :and believed that iit would not * “go smooth. with. every judge.” Acosta responded, “If we
need[,] let?s find a different charge.” -On Saturday, September 15, 2007, Villafaiia emailed.
Lefkowitz, using her’personal email-address, reporting that she had.““gotten some:negative reaction

MI The charge was;to'be:basedon“anincident in which Epstein, ‘put:great pressure* ... .‘on [one ofthis ‘female:

assistants] to call the girlsfo-set up appointments:”
