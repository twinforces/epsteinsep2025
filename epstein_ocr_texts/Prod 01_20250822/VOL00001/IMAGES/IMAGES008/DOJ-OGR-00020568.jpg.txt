ORDERaas to:Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained.i in the Opinion &
Order, a hearing is‘necessary;to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the

important : interest-in, the finality of judgmerits, the standard tor obtaining a

post-yerdict hearing is high. ‘The Court:concludes, and the Government'concedes, that

‘the demanding standard for holding a post= verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to
whether Juror 50. failed to respond: ‘truthfully during the:jury’selection process:to
‘whether‘he was.a‘victim, of sexual abuse., Following trial, Juror 50:‘made several direct,
‘unambiguous statements to multiple media ‘outlets about his ‘own. experience that do
not.pertain:to jury. deliberations and that cast:doubt on the accuracy of his responses

during, jury Seléction. Juror 50's post-trial Statements até "clear, strong, stbstantial and

‘incontrovertible evidence that-a.specific, non—speculative impropriety’ ‘namely, a false

statement during jury selection has occurred. United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d 123,
130'(2d. Cir. 2018). To be:clear;:the potential impropricty: is not that someone with.a

history of sexual abuse-may have Served on. the jury. Rather, .it is the potential failure:
‘to respond tr ‘uthfully to questions during the jury’ selection, process that asked.for'that
‘material information so that any: potential bias could be: explored. ‘In contrast, the

demanding:standard for‘ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to the: conduct of
any otherjuror. ‘The Court, DENIES the: tequcst;to- conduct a hearing’ with respect to
the other, jurors. Lhe Court also DENIES the Defendant's'request for a’ broader hearing

and pre-hearing: discovery. ‘The Court.therefore ORDERS that a‘hearing take place. at
