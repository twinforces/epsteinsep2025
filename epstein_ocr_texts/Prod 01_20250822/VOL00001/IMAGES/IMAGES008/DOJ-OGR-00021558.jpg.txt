inconsistent and unreliable. I overrule this objection.

Carolyn testified at trial that Virginia first brought her to

Epstein's residence when she was 14 ‘years old, I fotina Carolyn

the arguments to the contrary. Moreover; @Sean's credible
testimeny corroborated Carolyn's recollection.

Paragraph 59, the defendant. makes ‘two objections.
Same objection to Garolyn being 14. For the reasons I've

statea, that's overruled. She objects te Carolyn's assertion

that she visited Epstein's residence more than a hundred times.
I overrule that objection. Again, I credit Garolyn's
testimony. She testifieo that she went. to the house "over 1C0C

Tt

times." I reject the suggestion that this is improbable based
on Epstein's travel schéoule.

Paragraphs 61 ano. 62 again object to Carolyn's age;
ano I ‘overrule for the same reasons.

Paragraph 64, three objections. First, the defenaant
objects: to Carolyn"s assertion that she visited the Palm Beach

resiagence over a hundreo times ano her assertion that she was

14. For the reasons I've given, I overrule those objections.
She objeets to the assertion that Carolyn Stopped performing
sexualizeo massages im 20C1 when she was 18 years ola ano
argues that the evidence indicates she was 17 years old. We're
going to take up the isSué of this timing question with, respéct.
