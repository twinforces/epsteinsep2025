06/25/2021 307 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell moves to suppress evidence
obtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation
against her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were
previously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of her
rights against compelled self-incrimination, against unreasonable searches and seizures,
and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the Government
did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence covered by a
protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is not entitled to
suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus DENIES
Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt. Nos. 133, 139) (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan
on 6/25/21)(Qw) (Entered: 07/01/2021)

06/30/2021 305 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Pursuant to the Court's order of June 25, 2021 (Dkt.
No. 303), any proposed redactions to the Court's opinion on Maxwell's motions to
suppress evidence must be filed no later than today, June 30, 2021. Any proposed
redactions to the other documents ordered unsealed in that order must be filed no later
than July 2, 2021. The parties shall file a joint letter by each of these dates informing the
Court if no redactions are sought. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
6/30/2021) (nl) (Entered: 06/30/2021)
