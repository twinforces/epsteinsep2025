the sanctity of jury deliberations. See FRE 606(b)(1).

"A juror's dishonesty during voir dire undermines a defendant's right to a fair
trial." United States v. Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 468 (S.D.N. Y. 2012) (citing
Clark v. United States, 289 U.S. 1, 11(1933), vacated on other grounds sub nom.
United States v. Parse, 789 F.3d 83 (2d Cir. 2015).
