Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 33 Filed 04/09/20 Page 16 of 38

Bryan argued, conversely, that the ‘government’ under the Rule, included not only the
prosecutors, but also any closely connected investigative agencies. The Court dispensed with the
‘out of District’ argument by the government, ruling that Rule 16 was not so limiting.

With respect to the issue of production of items from other closely connected agencies,
the Court found in favor of Bryan as far as discovery of items by such agencies. In setting forth
the rule, the Court said: “The prosecutor will be deemed to have knowledge of and access to

case. Marshall, 132 F.3d at 67-68.

Other Districts have also followed Bryan. In United States v. Libby, 432 F. Supp. 81
(D.D.C. 2006), the Court was faced with a motion to compel, by defendant, I. ‘Scooter’ Libby, in
the Valerie Plame CIA leak case. The matter concerning Libby concerned whether he lied as to
the disclosures as to Plame. Libby sought documents which, as the Court pointed out, were of a
