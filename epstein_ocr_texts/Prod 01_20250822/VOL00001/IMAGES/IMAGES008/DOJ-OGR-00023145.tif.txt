In another letter, Starr renewed the defense accusation that the USAO improperly disclosed
information about the case to the media, and accused Sloman and Villafafia of “encouraging civil
litigation” against Epstein. Finally, in a letter to Assistant Attorney General Fisher on
May 14, 2008, Starr thanked her for having spoken with him the previous day, reiterated the
defense team’s various complaints, and asked her to meet with him, Lefkowitz, and Whitley.

Meanwhile, Oosterbaan’s Deputy Chief drafted a decision letter to be sent from Oosterbaan
to Lefkowitz, and over the course of several weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mandelker and Assistant Attorney General Fisher, as well as
the Criminal Division’s Appellate Section (regarding certain legal issues) and Office of
Enforcement Operations (regarding the Petite policy). Oosterbaan told OPR that, notwithstanding
the defense submissions on a wide variety of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was limited
to determining whether there was a basis for a federal prosecution of Epstein.

Oosterbaan’s letter, sent to Lefkowitz on May 15, 2008, notified the defense team that
CEOS had completed its independent evaluation of whether prosecution of Epstein for federal
criminal violations “would contradict criminal enforcement policy interests.” The letter specified
that CEOS’s review addressed the “narrow question” of whether a legitimate basis existed for a
federal prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct a de novo review of the facts, analyze issues
relating to federal statutes that did not pertain to child exploitation, or review the terms of the NPA
or the prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The letter stated that based on its examination of the
material relevant to its limited review of the matter, CEOS had concluded that “federal prosecution
in this case would not be improper or inappropriate” and that Acosta “could properly use his
discretion to authorize prosecution in this case.”

On May 19, 2008, Lefkowitz reached out to Acosta to request a meeting and specifically
asked that Acosta “not shunt me off to one of your staff.”” Lefkowitz made several points in support
of the request for a meeting: (1) CEOS’s letter acknowledged that federal prosecution of Epstein
would involve a “novel application” of relevant federal statutes;'° (2) CEOS’s conclusion that
federal prosecution would not be “an abuse of discretion” was “hardly an endorsement” of the
case;!*’ (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s prosecutorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical
new evidence,” in the form of recent defense counsel depositions of victims confirmed “that
represented Epstein victims. The Epstein defense team alleged in the letter that Sloman’s past association with the
attorney caused Sloman to take actions to favor victims’ potential civil lawsuits against Epstein.

166 Oosterbaan’s letter stated, “Mr. Acosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution
even though it might involve a novel application of a federal statute.” This statement referred to a defense argument
based on a prior Departmental expression of concern about a Congressional proposal to expand federal law to “adult
prostitution where no force, fraud or coercion was used.” Oosterbaan stated that “the Department’s efforts are properly
focused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children”—even if wholly local—and “the exploitation of adults
through force, fraud, or coercion.” He then observed that the fact “that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look
precisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive.”

167 Oosterbaan began his letter, however, by making it clear that CEOS had considered “the narrow question as
to whether there is a legitimate basis for the U.S. Attorney’s Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of
Mr. Epstein.”
