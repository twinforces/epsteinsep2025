In.another letter, Starr renewed the:defense accusation thatthe USAO‘improperly disclosed
information, about;the case to the:media, and accused Sloman.and Villafana, of “encouraging civil.
litigation against Epstein. Finally, in. ‘a letter to Assistant Attorney General. Fisher ‘on
May. 14; 2008, Starr thanked her for having spoken with hii the previous day, ‘reiterated the
‘defense team’s. various complaints, and asked.her to meet’with him, Lefkowitz, and Whitley.

Meanwhile,.Oosterbaan’s Deputy Chief drafted.a decision letter to be sent from Oosterbaan,
to Lefkowitz, and over the course of. several. weeks, it was reviewed by and received input from.
Deputy Assistant Attorney General Mandelker and.Assistant Attorney General Fisher, as well as
the Criminal ‘Division’s: Appellate Section. (regarding certain legal. issues) and Office of
Enforcement Oper ations (regarding the Petite. policy). Oosterbaan told OPR.that, notwithstanding
the: defense: submissions on.a'wide varicty of issues and complaints, CEOS’s review was‘ limited.
to determining whether thete was'a basis ‘for a.federal prosecution of Epstein.

Oosterbaan’s letter, sent to Lefkowitz on May’15, 2008, notified the defense: ‘team that.
CEOS had. completed its independent evaluation of whether’ prosecution of Epstein for federal,
criminal-violations “*would. contradict criminal enforcement policy:interests.” The letter specified
that CEOS’s review addressed the “narrow question” of whether.a. legitimate’ basis existed for a,
federal. prosecution, and that CEOS did not conduct ade novo. review of the facts, analyze 1 issues
relating to: ‘federal statutes that did not. pertain’ to:child exploitation, of feview the terms:of the NPA.
orthe prosecutorial misconduct allegations. The letter stated that based on. its ‘examination of the:
material relevantto its limited review ofthe-matter, CEOS had concluded that-“federal prosecution
in this ‘case would not. be improper. or. inappropriate” and. that Acosta “could. properly use: his
discrétion to, authorize prosccution.in.this case.”

On. May 19,.2008, Lefkowitz reached ‘out to Acosta to request a meeting and. specifically
asked that Acosta “not shunt'me off to-one of your'staff.” Lefkowitz made several points‘in support
of the request for a mecting: (1): CEOS’s letter acknowledged that:federal: ‘prosecution. of Epstein
would involve a. “novel. application” of :felewant. federal statutes: !*° (2): ‘CEOS’s conclusion ‘that
federal. prosecution would not. be:“‘an. abuse: of discretion” ‘was “hardly: an endorsement” of. the
cases lor (3) CEOS did not address Epstein’s.prosectitorial misconduct allegations; and (4) “critical,

new ‘evidence,’ “in. the: form of recent. defense counsel. depositions of victims ‘confirmed “that.

represented Epstein victims., The Epsteim defense;team alleged. inthe: letter, that’Sloman’s past association with .the’
‘attorney cased Sloman to’take actions fo favor-victims’ potential civiLlawsuits against Epstein.

Oosterbaaii’s' letter stated, “Mi-Acosta Can Sotindly. exercise his.alithority to decide to-pirsiié-a prosecution
even though itmight inyolye-a novel, application of a-federal statute: This: statement referred to a-delense ar
based on/a-prior'Departinental éxpressionof Concern about a.Congréssional proposal.to éxpaiid federal law’ to “adiilt:
prostitution where:no:force, fraud or cocreion.was.used.” Oosterbaan stated thatthe. Department’s.ctlorts:are properly
focused.on the commercial Sexual-exploitation of childreii”—even if wholly local—and. “the exploitation of adults
through, force; traud; orcoercion:” ‘He‘then observed ‘that the. f fact:“that a:prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not look:
precisely-like the cases that‘came’ before ittis not dispositive.”

Lo ‘Oostérbaaii begai his letter, however, by makingut clear that CEOS:had.considered “the narrow. question.as

to whether ‘there 1s,.a legitimate basis: for the U.S, Attomey’s, Office. to: proceed. with, a federal prosecution. of
Mr: Epstein.”
