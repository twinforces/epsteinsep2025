principles was too expansive, his view of the federal interest::in. prosecuting Epstein. was too
natrow, and his understanding of the state system was too imperfect; to justify the decision. to use
the’ NPA. Furthermore, because Acosta assumed a significant. role in reviewing and. drafting the.
NPA. and the other ‘three.subjects who were.supervisors left the USAO, ‘were transitioning to-other:
jobs, or were absent at: critical. junctures, Acosta should-have ensured. more effective ‘coordination.
and comintinication during the negotiations and before approving-the final NPA. The NPA was.a
unique resolution,,and-one that required-greater:oversight and supervision.than. Acosta provided.

OPR further concludes that none of the subject attorneys committed professional,
misconduct ‘with respect: to the government’s interactions with victims: The subjects did not
intentionally or'reckléssly violate a clear and unambiguous duty’under the CVRA by” entering into
the NPA. without consulting’ with victims, because the. USAO resolved the: Epstein. investigation
without a federal efiminal charge. Significantly, at the time’the NPA was signed,‘the Department,
did not ‘interpret ‘CVRA rights. to attach unless and-until. federal charges had. been filed,, and. the.
federal. courts had not established a clear and Unaimbigtious standard. applying the CVRA before
criminal :charges were brought. Tn-addition,:OPR. did-not.find evidence that the lack.of:consultation
was for'the:purpose of silencing:victims. Nonetheless, the lack of consultation was partiofia series
of government. interactions with victims that ultimately led. to public: and. court condemnation of
the: government’s treatment: of the victims, reflected poorly on the: Department as .a,whole, and is
contradictory. to the Department’s mission to minimize the frustration and confusion that victims
of'a crime: endure:

OPR determined that. none: of the subjects. was responsible for communications: ‘sent to
certain Victims after the NPA was signed-that described the case:as, “tinder investigation” and that!
failed:to: inform ‘them, of the NPA. The letters were sent by ‘an FBI’ administrative: employee who
was not. directly involved. in, the: investigation, ‘incorporated, standard form language used ‘by the
FBI when, communicating with. victims, and. were: not drafted. or reviewed. by ‘the subjects.
Moreover, the statement that the matter was “under investigation” was not :false: because the
government, in fact continued to investigate the case in anticipation that, Epstein would not fulfill.
the'terms of the NPA. However, the letters risked misleading the:victims:and contributed to victim,
frustration. and confusion by. failing to provide important, information about the status of the
Investigation. The letters ‘also demonstrated.a. lack of coordination’between the federal : agencies
responsible | ‘for communicating with Epstein’ § ‘Victims and showed a lack of attention to and
Ov. ersight regarding communication with. victims.

After the NPA was signed, Acosta clected to defer to the: State Attorney the decision,
whether to notify-victims about the state’s plea hearing pursuant‘to ‘the state’s own victim’s rights
requirements., Although Acosta’s decision, was within his authority and did not: constitute
professional. misconduct, OPR. concludes that Acosta exercised. poor judgment when he failed to
inake certain that the staté. intetided. to and would notify victiins identified. through, the. ‘federal.
‘investigation about the state:plea hearing. His decision left victims uninformed about.an important
proceeding that resolved the federal investigation, an investigation, about ‘which the USAO had
communicated with. victims for months. It‘also ultimately created the misimpression. that. the:
Departinent intentionally sotight'to silence the Victiins, Acosta failed to cnsuré-that’Victims were
made aware of a court proceeding that was related to their own cases,,and.thus he failed:to ‘ensure:
that victims were treated: with forthrightness and dignity:
