I do. think it’s important to look back on this, and try’to be in the
shoes of ‘the thought: process. in, 2006 ‘and. °07 when trafficking,
prosecutions, were. fairly new, when . .. more so than rte some.
jurors may’ have looked. at this as prostitution, and... . [a] judge’s
tolerance :for victim shaming may have . . . caused ‘more hesitation
on the part, of victims . .....%°

Finally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offcred:more flexibility in fashioning:
a sentence, because he belicved. prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district
court in the Southern District of Florida to approve a. federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence
that differed. from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range.“

In. summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,

The way: the matter came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing
cnough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for
registration, and then’you.had the restitution issue. There were legal
issues... . . here: were witness issucs.. And ..... we: could go to trial

. anid ‘we may or may:not prevail. Alternatively. we could look’ at
a a pre- indictment resolution, and at various points, the office: went
back and forth ‘between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a
state: pre-indictment resolution,

Acosta ‘told OPR that, in. the end, “there ‘was.a preference for deferring to the state” because, in.
part, the facts of the Epstcin case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution
rather than trafficking, and a fedcral prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained.
that he did, not. view itas problematic’ fo defer resolution of the case to: the state, although as the

Epstein.case:played out, the: federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because
the defense tried to get'the state. to “cireumvent and-undermine” the outcome.

Attorney’s Office could have proceeded ‘against.Epstcin by way of.an information, but decided ‘to. go: into the ‘grand.
jury. because the: State Atiorney’s Office “didn't like the case” and wanted * ‘political cover” for. declining: the case! or
‘proceeding ona lesser charge.

8g Menchel told OPR. however, that the federal judges in. West Palm, Beach, were highly-regarded. and, were

a Acosta: said ‘that,* “dismissing a number of counts, and ‘then doing a;[RJule J 1, is, not something that. [South,
Elorida-federal district] judges-tend to do.” Other subjects also,told OPR that the federal-judges in.the, Southern’ District;
of Floridaywere generally. considered averse: to pleas that’ bound them on sentencing:. commonly referred to as, “Rule

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure: 1 1(c)(1.)(C) allows the:partics to agree on a.specific sentence sas part of
a plea‘agreement. The: court is required to impose. that sentence if the court accepts the: plea agreement; ifthe court:
does not.aceept the agreed upon plea and sentences the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule 1 I(¢) pleas:
were. “uncommon” “in, the Southern District of Florida, as; the * “judges: do: not like: to’ be told... .. what sentence: to
impose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges 1 in the Southern District of Florida as:
averse'to Rule 1 l(c) pleas; although Menchel had: negotiated such pleas. Villafaiia‘told OPR that she had never offered.
a Rule 1.1(c) plea;in any: of her cases-and had no: experience with such pleas.
