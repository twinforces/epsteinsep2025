04/01/2022 | 653 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court concludes that Juror 50
testified credibly and truthfully at the post-trial hearing. His failure to disclose his
prior sexual abuse during the jury selection process was highly unfortunate, but not
deliberate. The Court further concludes that Juror 50 harbored no bias toward the
Defendant and could serve as a fair and impartial juror. The requirements for a new
trial under McDonough are not satisfied. The Defendant's motion for a new trial
pursuant to Rule 33 is therefore DENIED. The Court orders the preparation of the
presentence investigation report. With respect to Counts 7 and 8, the Court hereby
excludes time under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), from today's
date through April 22, 2022. The Court finds that the ends of justice served by granting
this exclusion from speedy trial computations outweigh the interests of the public and
the Defendant in a speedy trial on these counts because the pending post-trial motions
affect the scheduling considerations set forth in the Government's January 10, 2022
letter. See Dkt. No. 574. The Defendant consents to this exclusion. Dkt. No. 650. The
Court will rule on the Defendant's remaining post—verdict motions in due course.
Sentencing remains scheduled for June 28, 2022. This resolves docket numbers 613,
614, 642, 650, and 651. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/1/2022) (See ORDER

04/25/2022 | 655 | LETTER MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene
Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated April 25, 2022 re:
Advance PSR Deadline . Document filed by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell. (Rohrbach,
Andrew) (Entered: 04/25/2022)

04/26/2022 | 656 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter
regarding the deadline for the disclosure of the Presentence Investigation Report. Dkt.
No. 655. After conferring with the Probation Office, the Court determines that
advancing the PSR disclosure schedule will aid the parties in preparing their
sentencing submissions. Further the Court hereby adjusts its standard sentencing
submission schedule to ensure sufficient time to prepare for sentencing. Accordingly,
the Court ORDERS the following schedule for sentencing: May 24, 2022 — First PSR
disclosure; May 31, 2022 — Defendant objections due; June 6, 2022 — Government
response due; June 9, 2022 — Second PSR disclosure; June 15, 2022 — Defendant
sentencing submission due; June 22, 2022 — Government sentencing submission due;
June 28, 2022 — Sentencing. This resolves Dkt. No. 655. SO ORDERED. (Signed by
Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/26/2022)(bw) (Entered: 04/26/2022)

04/29/2022 | 657 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell....[*** See this Opinion & Order
***]. V. Conclusion. For the foregoing reasons, the Court denies the Defendant's
Rule 29 motion because the jury's guilty verdicts were supported by the witness
testimony and documentary evidence presented at trial. The Court denies the
Defendant's motion based on constructive amendment or variance because the jury
instructions, the Government's evidence at trial, and summation all captured the core
of criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced by any
alleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its
prosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the
Defendant's motion based on pre—indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the
Defendant's motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is
multiplicitous with Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is
multiplicitous with Count Three. Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the
Defendant's participation in the same decade—long unlawful agreement with the
Defendant's continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom and sexually abuse
underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts
Three, Four, and Six. The Defendant's sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28,
2022. The Court previously set a schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in
