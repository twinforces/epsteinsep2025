Seeretary of Labor. In.a‘brief oral statement, Acosta explained ‘that continued:media attention.on.
his handling of the Epstein investigation, rather ‘than on the economy. was unfait ‘to: the Labor
Department.

‘On.August. 10,-2019,.Epstcin was found hanging in his cell and-was later pronounced dead.
The-New York City Chief Medical Examiner concluded. that. Epstein had:committed:suicide.

As a result of Epstein’s death, the U.S..Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of.
New York filed a nolle: prosequi to dismiss the pending indictinent against Epstein. On.
August 27,2019, the district court held a hearing at which more than. a dozen. of Epstein’s
Victims—including Victiis,ofthe conduct-in Elorida-that was addressed through the NPA—spoke:
about. the impact of ‘Epstein’s ‘crimes. The court dismissed the Epstein ‘indictment on
August 29, 2019.

After Epstein’s death, the :federal. district court :in.Florida oversecing;the CVRA litigation.
denied the petitioners their requested remedies and closed the case as moot. Among its: findings,
the court concluded. that although. the government had violated. the GVRA, the government. had
asserted “legitimate and. legally supportable positions throughout this litigation,” and therefore had
not litigated. in. bad faith. The court: also ‘noted it. expected. the government ‘to. “honor its.
representation that iti will provide training to its employees about the CVRA andthe proper
treatment of crime*victims,” as well as honoring its promise to meet with the victims.

On, September 30, 2019, CVRA- petitioner “Jane Doe 1” filed. in, her true name :a‘petition.
for a writ of mandamus: in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, secking,
review of the district court’s. order denying all of, her requested, remedies. In its responsive brief,
the:government argued that “‘as:a matter. of law, the’ legal obligations under the CVRA.do not attach.
prior to the government. charging:a case” and thus, “the CVRA Aas’ hotitriggered.in. [the Southern
District of Florida] because no criminal. charges were brought.” “Nevertheless, during oral.
ar rgument, the government conceded that the USAO had. not been “fully tranisparerit” with the
fact the NPA had been. signed.” ” On "April: 14, 3020, a a divided “d panel of the Court of ‘Appeals denied
the‘petition, ruling that CVRA rights do not-attach until, a defendant. has been, criminally charged.
On. August 7, 2020, the court granted the. petition for rehearing en: bunc and vacated. the :pancl’s
Opinion; as of the date of this Report, a briefing schedule has been issued, and, oral, argument, is set
for December 3,. 2020.
