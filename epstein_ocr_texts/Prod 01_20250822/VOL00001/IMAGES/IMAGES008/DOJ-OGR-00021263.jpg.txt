Villafana told OPR that. after hearing the defense argument, Acosta ‘reiterated, that the:
federal, interest In the: case could be vindicated only by a state plea. to-an offense that. required
sexual offender registration, resulted in a, two-year term of incarceration, and was subject. to the:
18 U.S.C. § 2255:-process for providing compensation, to the victims., When defense’ counsel.
objected ‘to ‘the registration.requirement, Acosta held firm, and.he also rejected the defense:proposal
for a sentence of home confinement. In a ‘subsequent email exchange with Criminal, Division
Deputy Assistant Attorney General: Sigal. Mandelker, who. supervised, CEOS, Oosterbaan reported.
that the: meeting was “nof-eventful,” noting that, defense counsel af ‘gued “federalism” and. night:

VI. SEPTEMBER 2007: THE PLEA NEGOTIATIONS INTENSIFY; AND IN THE
PROCESS, THE REQUIRED TERM OF:IMPRISONMENT IS REDUCED

Acosta had dispensed with. the, Atigtist 17, 2007 plea deadliné specified in Menchel’s
August 3, 2007 letter, in order to allow the defense to. meet with him. .After that mecting, and.
although. Villafana continued:to plan to filé charges on Septeinber 25, no new plea deadline was
established, ‘and the negotiations continued through most of September.

‘The defense used: that time to push the USAO to make concessions. Because Acosta was
not willing. to compromise on: the ‘issue of sexual offender registration or providing a ‘means
through which the victinis could seek monetary: damages, the negotiations. focused, on the term of.
Imprisonment. As the. contemporancous. emails: show,, the USAO did not hold-to its position. that
a two-year term of imprisonment was, “the minimum” that the USAO would accept. To reach an
agreement. with. the defense. ‘on. Epstein’s. sentence, the USAO. explored possible pleas in. either
federal of state court, or both, and Villafatia spent considerable time and effort working with
defense counsel on developing alternative pleas with various outcomes. In, the: course of ‘that.
process, ‘the, agreement. was revised ‘to require | that Epstein accept a, sentence of 18 months, owith

months.
A. ‘The Incarceration Term Is Reduced from 24 Months to 20 Months

Shortly: after the September 7, 2007 mecting, Epstein. attorney. Gerald.Lefeourt, who had.
not been present-at the mecting, spoke with both. Acosta-and Louric, andimade a new counteroffer,
proposing:that: Epstein serve 15 months :in.jail followed by 1S:months; in. home. confinement. On.
the afternoon of Monday, September 1.0, 2007, Villafaiia emailed Sloman, identifying ‘issues she
wanted to discuss ‘with ‘him, ‘including, her concern that. defense counsel. was pushing for :a
resolution. that; would allow Epstein to avoid incarceration and possibly sexual offender
registration. Villafatia stated that Lefcourt’s counteroffer was “‘a reasonable counteroffer in. light
Of Oli Staiting position of 24 months,” but added that it was “a really low sentenée.” Villafana

03 Sloman echoed this point, telling OPR: that:Starr’s, presentation focused ‘onthe; issue; of federalism, ‘but ‘the:

USAG had alicady-decided to-deterprosccution to:thestate aiid atter'thie mectiig, the’ USAO continued on that path.
