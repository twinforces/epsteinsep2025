money to fund the program had to come out of the agency's own budget since it didn’t get any extra from Congress, according to Hawk Sawyer.
in the meantime, the bureau has been relying on augmentation to temporarily fill correctional officer positions with other staff. Although Sawyer said this is a
good process and all staff are trained forthis role, she admitted the agency hes to use augmentation more than is optimal and often employees are taken away
from their designated work.
In addition to hiring, Hawk Sawyer said the bureau is working to replace the surveillance cameras in all prisons, ensure that staff are thoroughly trained and
have managers repeatedly tell staff what their responsibilities are. These are all issues that came to light in the wake of the Epstein scandal.
As the hearing was going on the.Justice Department indicted the two federal correctional officers on duty the night of Epstein’s death with ialsitying records
to say they checked on him. ; .
Hawk Sawyer agreed with Sen, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that the Epstein situation was a “black eye” on the entire agency. Since the FBI and the Justice Department
inspector General are looking into the Epstein case she said she could not speak about any specifics.
“We have some bad staff,” Hawk Sawyer said. "We want rid of those bed staff who don’t do theirjob. We want them gone one way or another either by
prosecution or by termination. But the good staff are doing extraordinary work out there every day managing the 177,000 inmates. You never hear anything
about those people.”
