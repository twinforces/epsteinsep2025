friendships or. associations'with any of Epstein’s attorneys.. In fact, Menchel told OPR.that he and
his USAO colleagues viewed Epstein’s atteipt to-exert influence.through his-choice. of counsel as
“ham-fisted” and*clumsy.”

‘Sloman told OPR that although he became aware that Lourie: was friends with Guy Lewis
and Lewis! *s law partner, he - was, unaware of personal relationships | between any. of his other

involving. former rcolleagues “was; that» we > would. give them process, buts we: edidn’ ‘pull a any sunches
with’them.” In, Sloman’s view, preexisting relationships with, defense counsel did‘not* ‘change the
equation” ‘because as AUSAs, heand his: colleagues were motivated by: what they perceived to be:
best for the case.

Lourietold OPR that his preexisting associations with Epstein’s attorneys “didn’t influence:
anything.” Notably, at‘the outset. of the Epstein case, Lourie: sought guidance from the USAO’s
Professional Responsibility. Officer about. the propriety ‘of his role as a supervisor ‘in. the
investigation, because of his acquaintance’ with Lewis and. long-time friendship ‘with Lewis’s law
partner. OPR.considered Lourie’s:caution.in seeking and obtaining the Professional.Responsibility
Officer's advice -as ‘ait ‘indication, that he was alert. to his ethical, responsibilities regarding
relationshipswith defense counsel, ‘including avoiding, the appearance of a conflict of interest.

Acosta said. during his OPR. interview that he “developed” the three criteria reflected on
the: term sheet —a: sentence: of incarceration, sexual offender Tegistration, and Monetary damages
added Starr and Lefkowitz, the Kirkland & Ellis attorneys, to his team. "Acosta pointed out “that:
the USAO continued. to insist ona resolution that satisfied all three of those criteria, even after
Kirkland &: Ellis became involved in.the case.

Acosta took other actions that appear inconsistent with an. intent to benefit ‘Starr and.
Lefkowitz. On several occasions, when. directly appealed to by Lefkowitz or Starr, hé directed.
them ‘to address their communications to Villafata, ‘Sloman, and other subordinates. .After his
October. 12, 2007 breakfast mecting with Lefkowitz, Acosta.:immediately communicated with
Sloman ‘about their conversation. In late 2008, when Acosta anticipated leaving the USAO and.
was considering pursuing employment with Kirkland:& Ellis, he recognized the conflict’of interest:
and instructed, Sloman'to stop copying him, on, emails relating to the Epstein matter. On Acosta’s
bchalf, the USAO’s Professional Responsibility Officer. sought and obtained formal Department
approval. of .Acosta’s recusal from the case based, on: the fact'that.he had“begun to discuss possible
employment” with ‘Kirkland & ‘Ellis. These actions: support. Acosta’s assertion. that he was
cognizant of his ¢thical:responsibilitics conceming relationships with defense counsel.?**

wa Ansaddition, :in. May 2008, the USAO’s Professional.Responsibility ‘Officer consulted*with.the Department's
Professional Responsibility Officer aboiit whethicr Acosta should recuse: trom the Epstéin-matter becaiise he was
