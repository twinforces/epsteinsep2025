Case 22-1426, Document 57,02/28/2023, 3475900, Page202 of 208

VI... No. bill of particulars is warranted.

Maxwell moves fora bill. of’particulars as to counts five and-six. Federal.Rulesof
Criminal Procedure 7.requires that an:indictment contain “a plain, concise, and:definite written
statement:ofthe essential facts, constituting:the offense. charged[.]” The indictment:must be,
specific enough to inform the defendant of the charges,and allow the defendant to:plead double
jeopardy in.a later:prosecution based .on,the same. events. See United States v. Stavroulakis, 952
‘F.2d 686,693, (2d Cir. 1992). “Under'this test,an indictmentneed do‘little more than‘to track: the
‘language of the:statute. charged and-state the time and-place’(in approximate: terms) ofthe alleged,
crime.” United. States. v. Framunti, 513: F.2d. 1087, 1113 (2d Cir. 1975).

“Rule 7(f of the Federal ‘Rules of Criminal Procedure permits.a:defendant to. seck a bill
of particulars. in.order to-identify-with sufficient particularity the:nature of the.charge pending
against him, thereby enabling defendant to prepare for trial, to:prevent surprise, and to interpose
aplea of double jeopardy should-he be. prosecuted a.second.time for. the same offense.” United
States ‘v. Borinovsky,, 820°F 24 572,574 (2d Cir. 1987). “The purpose ofa bill of particulars is'to
supplement the allegations in. the indictment‘when necessary to (1) enable the defendant to
prepare his' defense, (2).avoid‘un fair'surprise:to the defendant at trial,iand (3) preclude a second
‘prosecution of the:same: offense.” United States v.. Mandell, 710“F. Supp. 2d 368, 384 (S.DIN.Y.
201 0)). On the other hand, the Court:must balance these interests ‘against the harm to. the
Government from-restricting;its proof at trial. See: United-States v..Rajarainam, No. 09-cr-1184
(RJA), 2010. WL 2788168, at *1 (S.DIN-Y. Jul. 13,2010).

In-her. previous motions, Maxwell argued that the Mann.Act counts in the indictment:

should be dismissed. for Jack. of specificity or that, in the alternative, the Court should compel, the

Government to submit a.bill of particulars proyiding greater, detail, of the charges. Maxwell
