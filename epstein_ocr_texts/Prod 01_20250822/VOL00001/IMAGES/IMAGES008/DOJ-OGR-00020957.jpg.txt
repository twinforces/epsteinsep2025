‘the juror ‘for cause, but not so great as. to: make mandatory-a.presumption of bias.” /d. at 171
(quoting ‘orres, 128 F.3d at 47). ‘Thesensuing determination of whether'the juror was biased or
‘prejudiced. against the defendant may: be;“‘affected. both by: whether'the nondisclosure: was;
deliberate and, if itwas, by the juror’s:motivation.to conceal. the truth.” United States v..MeCon,
995 F.3d 32,:51 (2d.Cir. 2021); see also Greer, 285 E.3d-at 172-73. It is important to. consider
whether. a juror’s answer’ was dishonestzin the:second. part of the test “because it:can. show “a.
‘personal interest in. this particular case that was so:powerlul as ‘to cause the juror'to:;commit a
serious crime [by lying during voir dire].”” United States-v..Nix, 275 F. Supp. 3d.420, 438,
(W.D:N.Y. 2017), aff'd sub nom. Uniied States. v. McCoy, 995 F.3d 32: (2d Cir. 2021) (alteration.

‘The: Mclonough inquiry is restricted by Federal:Rule.ofEvidence 606, which states:
‘During an-inquiry into the-validity. of 'a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify

evidence of'a juror’s statement on ‘these matters.
‘Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(1). -As explained.in ‘this: Court’s prior‘opinion, the:rule is subject ‘to certain
execptions inapplicable. here. .See Feb. 2'5,.2022 Op. & Order, at ‘12. The rule,:;which. embodies:
“long-accepted Federal Jaw,”*is an-important safeguard on the integrity of the jury trial system.
Tanner v. United States, 483 U.S. 107, 120-21. (1987) (rejecting‘a‘constitutional.challenge to the
rule). It enables “full and. frank discussion in-the jury. room” and secures “jurors” willingness to
return-an unpopular verdict.” Jd. Without the-rule, the ‘finality of verdicts, upon which.the:

system-relies, would be seriously disrupted. See: id. at: 120-21, 124-25; see-also Warger v.

Shauers, 574. U.S. 40, 45,4950 (2014). And.though not atissuc im this case, the rule playsia.
