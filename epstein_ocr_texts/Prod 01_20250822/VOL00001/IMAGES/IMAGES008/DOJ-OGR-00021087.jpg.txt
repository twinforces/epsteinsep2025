other USAOs. See Annabi, 771 F.2d at 671; Alessi, 544 F.2d at 1154; Papa, 533
F.2d at 823-25. That is not the case here; Defendant produced ample evidence that
the NPA was intended to bind other USAOs as to possible co-conspirators.

Fourth, at most, Annabi embraces a tiebreaking rule: after the court
conducts an evidentiary hearing and receives testimony from the attorneys
involved in the plea agreement, if it still cannot decide the agreement’s geographic
scope, it may presume that it was limited to a single district. See Annabi, 771 F.2d
at 671; Papa, 533 F.2d at 823. The court erred when it applied the Annabi canon
without first granting Defendant’s reasonable request for an evidentiary hearing.

For all of these reasons or any of them, the court’s ruling was error.

2. Annabi does not apply because the NPA was negotiated and entered

into outside of the Second Circuit

Remarkably, the court applied Annabi to the NPA without conducting a
choice-of-law analysis and without addressing Defendant’s contention that
Eleventh Circuit law should apply. It did so even though the NPA was negotiated
in Florida, with Southern District of Florida prosecutors, in exchange for Epstein’s
agreement to plead guilty in Florida state court. As shown below, applying the
Second Circuit’s minority Annabi rule in this context was improper and unfair:
