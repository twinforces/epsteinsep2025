also pursued, other investigative steps, which included. working’with the FBI to locate an. expert:
witness'to testify about.the effect of sexual abuse on victims. She also continued collecting:records
relating to Epsteiri’s business entities, if part to help establish the interstate nexus. of Epstein’s
activity. On several occasions, Villafatia ‘sought guidance from CEOS, which had ‘considerable:

USAO procedures generally required that_a. proposed indictment be accompanied bya.
prosecution memorandum from the AUSA handling the case. The prosecution. memorandum was
expected’ to éxplain.the factual and, legal bases for ‘the:proposed charges and address any: significant:
procedural, factual, and legal, issues sof which the AUSA " ‘was aware: _witness- related | issues;
supervisors, “but vinhigh “profile or complex cases, proposed indictments might r require review wv and
approval. bythe Criminal Division Chicf, the FAUSA, or éven-the U.S. Attoriicy.

Accordingly, Villafana drafted, an. 82-page: prosecution memorandum directed:to Acosta,
Sloman, Menchel.(who had replaced. Sloman as the USAO’s Criminal Division Chief the-previous
October, when Sloman‘became:the FAUSA), Lourie, and her:immediate supervisor, dated May 1,

In, his OPR, interview, Lourie recalled ‘thinking that the prosecution memorandum and
proposed.indictment “were very thorough and contained.a lot:of:hard work,” but that.he wanted ‘to

Although ° ‘indictments coming out of the West Palm, Beach office usually did not require.
