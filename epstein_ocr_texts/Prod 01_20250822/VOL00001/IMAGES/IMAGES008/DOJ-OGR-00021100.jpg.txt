witness interviews, and take additional legal steps to obtain Epstein’s
‘computers if Epstein rejected the deal.”’)

o id. at. 60 (“Villafana...reiterated. that she wanted to contact Epstein’s
assistants in New York and. to interview some of Epstein’s colleagues
and former employees there’).

o Jd. at 68 (Feds considered charging: Epstein under 18 USC 113(a)(5),
simple assault.on an airplane, indicating possible bases to. charge ‘him in.
other districts).

o Jd. at 69, 73, 75, 79-80 (Defense sought a government promise not to
bring immigration proceedings against Epstein’s assistants).

The NPA and the OPR provide ample evidence that. the agreement as to the
co-conspirators. was intended to bind. ‘other districts. In. contrast, in .Annabi,
Abbamonte, Alessi, and Papa, there was a complete absence of any evidence
showing an‘intent to bind other districts.

5. If it is reasonable'to conduct a. hearing, then Annabi is a. tiebreaker

The:language of the NPA. and the evidence contained in the OPR are more
than sufficient for the Court to find that the NPA bars the prosecution of Maxwell,
particularly when. any ambiguities are construed, as they must be, against the
Government as drafter. In the alternative, however, the NPA. and the

circumstances of its execution. merit discovery and an. evidentiary hearing
