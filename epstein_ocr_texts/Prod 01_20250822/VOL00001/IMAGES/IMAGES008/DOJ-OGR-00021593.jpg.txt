Having resolvea the parties' objections, I will
calculate the Guideline range. As explained, I will use the

2CC3 Guidelines manual. Following Section 2G61,.1(a) (1), each,

victim is considered a separate: count of conviction. In

aoaition to the three victims: for which an offense level was

Calculated in the PSR. Jane, Annie, ana Carolyn -- IT

caletlate offense levels, for Virginia and Melissa, coming to a

total of 5 groups.

For all groups, the base offense level is 19. That's
Sections 2G1.1(a) ana 2X1.1 (a) .

For Jane and Garolyn, because they were: older than 12

but were not. yet 16 when abuse began, the offense level 1s:

enhancea by 2. 2G1.1(b) (2) (B).

Thé offénse level for Jane and Carolyn is further

enhanced by 2 because they were. unduly influenced into a

cemmercial sex. act. 2G1.1(b): (4) (B).

For Annié, Virginia, and Melissa, who were at least

16, the offense level is, increased by 2 because they were

unduly influenced into a commercial act. 2G1.1. (b) (4) (B).

The offense level fon all groups are also enhanced by
4 poifits because of the Supervisory role in an extéensivé
criminal :activity. 3Bl.1¢a@).

This brings the total offense level ‘for Jane's and
Carolyn's groups to 27. Ano Anmié's, Virginia's ano Mélissa's
groups each to 25).
