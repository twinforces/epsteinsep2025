1 Having resolved the parties' objections, I will

2 calculate the Guideline range. As explained, I will use the

3 2003 Guidelines manual. Following Section 2G1.1(d) (1), each

4 victim is considered a separate count of conviction. In

5 addition to the three victims for which an offense level was

6 calculated in the PSR -—- Jane, Annie, and Carolyn —- I

7 calculate offense levels, for Virginia and Melissa, coming to a
8 total of 5 groups.

g For all groups, the base offense level is 19. That's
10 Sections 2G1.1(a) and 2X1.1(a).

11 For Jane and Carolyn, because they were older than 12
12 but were not yet 16 when abuse began, the offense level is

13 enhanced by 2. 2G1.1(b) (2) (B).

14 The offense level for Jane and Carolyn is further

15 enhanced by 2 because they were unduly influenced into a

16 commercial sex act. 2G1.1(b) (4) (B).

17 For Annie, Virginia, and Melissa, who were at least
18 16, the offense level is increased by 2 because they were

19 unduly influenced into a commercial act. 2G1.1.(b) (4) (B).
20 The offense level for all groups are also enhanced by
21 4 points because of the supervisory role in an extensive
22 criminal activity. 3Bl.1(a).
23 This brings the total offense level for Jane's and
24 Carolyn's groups to 27. And Annie's, Virginia's and Melissa's
25 groups each to 25.
