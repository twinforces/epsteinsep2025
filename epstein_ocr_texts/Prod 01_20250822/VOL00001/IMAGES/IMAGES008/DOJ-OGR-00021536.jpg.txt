would require the: Court to “haul. [1 1] jurors in after they. have reached:a verdict” to probe for
who, if anyone, may have been'‘mentioned in the article. Guzman Loera, 24F 4th at. 161
(quoting Moon, 718 F.2d at 1234),

Second, Federal Rule of Evidence 606 bars the Court from considering Juror 50’s
statements as évidence-of another juror’s' statements purportedly made during deliberations. As
previously quoted, the rule states:

During an inquiry:into the validity ofa Verdict or-indictinent, a juror may not

‘Here, the:Defendant relies on. Juror 50’s statements of:what another-juror. allegedly stated

In response, the:Defendant argues that Juror ‘50’s statements about'the second. j uror fall.
