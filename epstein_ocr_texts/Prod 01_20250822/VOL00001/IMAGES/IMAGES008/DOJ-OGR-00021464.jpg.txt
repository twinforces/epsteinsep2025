breach, however, Epstein-would.enter, his state guilty. plea and the federal. investigation would-end.
Thus; the statement that: the case ‘was “currently under investigation” “was literally true; but the
omission of important contextual:information:about the existence of the NRA depri ived the-victims
of important information about the exact status of the investigation.

A. The USAO Was Not Responsible for Victim Notification Letters Sent by the:
FBI in: October 2007, January 2008, and ‘May ‘2008 Describing the Status of
the Case.as “Under Investigation”

The 2005 Guidelines charged the EBI with informing the victiins of CVRA rights and.
available services during the “inv estigative stage” of'a case. During the: Epstein investigation, the
EBI. case. agents complied: with the agency’s notification, obligation.by hand delivering;pamphlets
to victims following their int /s and:through computer- ‘generated | letters sent to the:victims by
the FBI’s Victim Specialist. The FBI’s notification process is independent of the USAO’s. ‘The:
USAO has its own Victim Witness Specialist who assumes the responsibility for ‘victim,
notification after an.indictment or:complaint:moved the case into the “prosecution stage.”

The: FBI's Victim m Specialist. used the VNS to prepare the October 2007, January 2008, and.
2005 Guidelines to inform. the victims oftheir rights ‘and other's ‘services during the* ‘investigative
stage.” The stock language ofthat, letter, however, was generic. and failed to. communicate: the:
unique case-specific status of the Epstein. investigation. at that time. The FBI. Victim Specialist.
who sent.the Ictters acted at the: case agent’s direction and was:not aware of the existence of the
NPA at the time.she created the letters.*'° Neither FBI-case agent-reviewed any of the letters sent
by the EBI’s: Victim Specialist.7"! According to Villafana, “The: decision.to issue the ‘letters; and.
the wording of those letters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Although the FBI case agents
informed Villafafia after the fact that the FBI’s Victim Specialist sent-her “standard. form letter,”
Villafafia had never.reviewed an FBI-generated victi notification letter and was' tiot; aware of its.
contents:*!? Villafaiia told-OPR she was unaware of the.content:of the EBI letters until. they were:

collected for the CVRA litigation, sometime after.July 2008.

alo The case:avent told OPR:that she did not-reeall, specifically directing the Victim Specialist; to:send a letter,

but‘aéknowledged that “she would come‘to us’ before she'would ‘approach a victim.”
Au ‘The case-agent téld OPR.that she had no-role in draftingithé. letters aiid believed them to be“Statidard ‘form
letters.” Similarly, ‘the:co-case agent told OPR,, “I can*t think that I?ve exer reviewed, any of-them,; ;.. they just go
‘fronrthe’vietim coorditator.”

ar Villafaia's lack of familiarity’ with. the. language in the FBI letters led 1. some inconsistency in, the.
information provided. to victims concerning: their-CVRA rights., Beginning in 2006, the, FBI. provided. to, victims
standard letters ‘advising: victims: of their. CVRA. rights but which. also noted ‘that only some ‘of the ‘rights: applied.
pre-charge. During this period,. Villafafia:also crafted. her. own introductory letters:to-the; victims. to let'them know: of:
their CVRA: right’ aird that the federal:investization.“would be a: different process” from the 4 prior. state:investigation
‘in w high ‘they victims: felt they: chad not 1 been particularly wi ell-treated, by’ the. See Allor ney's  Ofice 2 Villatana told,
