resolution, of the case. to ensure Epstein’s victims ‘were given.an opportunity to attend the plea
hearing; and to possibly’ speak about the impact of. Epstein’ § crimes, ‘presented a glaring: contrast:
with. Acosta’s: responsiveness to the demands: of. ‘Epstein’ S attorneys, which ‘included the unusual
courtesy of allowing'them to preview and respond to'the USAO’S draft victim notifications. This
contrast added.to the victims” perception that.they had.been treated.unfairly, a view shared by. the:
public.

Nothing in the:.documentary ‘record ‘suggests that Acosta thought through the: issue of.
determining which victims would-be ‘notified. by the state, or that he took any. steps to ensure that:
all of the:-known federal victims received:information. about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with.
his decision to resolve the ‘federal investigation.through a state: -based resolution, Acosta exercised
poor judgment: when-he made critical decisions affecting the federal. investigation and the victims,
but also. failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed ‘to
implement them. Acosta’s failure:to consider these issues. before simply. leaving the responsibility
for inaking notifications entirely tothe State Attornéy’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO
and the Department as a whole. It left. victims in. the dark about an important proceeding that.
resolved the federal investigation, an.investigation about;which the: USAO had.communicated with
victims formonths. It also ultimately created.the'misimpression that the Department intentionally
sought to: silence the victims ‘by. keeping them uninformed, about the NPA and the resulting state
proceeding. Acosta failed 'to ensure that’victims were afforded an opportunity to attend a hearing
that was: related. ‘to ‘their own cases and thus failed. ‘to ensure that victims were treated with.
forthrightness and dignity:,

Fro September 24,.2007, when the NPA ‘was signed, until after Epstcin’s June 30, 2008
state court plea, the case agents, ‘acting under’ Villafaiia’s direction, directly ‘informed only three:
Victiins that the goverment had sighed an. NPA and that; if Epstein complied with its terms, the
