1843, 1857, 1859 (2017)). In this case, the District Court did not just purport to
follow Annabi, but expanded its questionable doctrine into new and inapplicable
territory. In this regard, the District Court erred in four respects.

First, unlike the plea agreement in Annabi, the NPA originated in a federal
district outside of the Second Circuit. Under textbook choice-of-law rules and
principles of fairness, it would be unreasonable to graft a unique, pro-prosecution
canon of construction, derived from the law of a foreign circuit—this circuit—onto
a plea agreement negotiated with prosecutors elsewhere.

Second, Annabi recognized that its “rule concerning construction of plea
agreements” was only “warrant[ed]” when “the new charges are sufficiently
distinct” from the old ones. 771 F.2d at 672. And Annabi made clear that charges
are “sufficiently distinct” when they cover a different or expanded period of time.
Id. But here, the USAO-SDNY charged Appellant under Count Six with conduct
from 2001 through 2004 that falls entirely within the 2001-2007 offense period

“affirmative” indication whatsoever that the plea agreement was intended to bind
