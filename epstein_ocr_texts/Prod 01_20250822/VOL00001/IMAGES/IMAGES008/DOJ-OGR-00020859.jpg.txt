1 can be relevant to an intent to transport to New York to engage
2 in sexual activity under the age of 17, I think. I think this
3 is the sane basic discussion that we've had. So, in addition

4 to my reasoning yesterday, I think the proposal mde by the

5 defense is wrong.

6 I continue to not know howto parse the jury's

7 question exactly, other than to knowthat they are asking about
8 Count Four, the defense's original suggestion to just point to
9 the motivating factor I rejected language or to say no. To say
10 no, I think, was the wrong course, because I don't understand
11 the question well enough to be able to say no.

12 Pointing to just the motivating factor language I

13 think was unhelpful because, really, the point is to remnd

14 them of the whole instruction, including that it's a violation
15 of New York penal lawthat's charged and is the illegal sexual
16 activity that they're considering.

17 So, for those reasons, I amin the same place.

18 I did want to mke a little bit of an additional

19 record regarding my extending the deliberations by an hour, the
20 instructions that I gave yesterday regarding that slightly
21 extended schedule
22 I asked the jury to mke themselves available to
23 deliberate until at least 6:00 today, which is a one-hour
24 extension of what's largely been our schedule. Although, it
25 was until 6 o'clock, I think, on the first night of
