On July. 24, 2006, Villafana alerted Sloman, who:informed.Acosta, that the:State Attorney’s
Office had charged. and.arrested. Epsteiit.** On thatsaine day, the FBI in West Palin. Beach for ‘mally
opened the case, assigning the case agent and, later,, a co-case: agent, to investigate, it. Villafata
told Sloiman that. the FBI agents “are getting copies of all of the eviderice and we are going to
review everything at [the] FBI on. Wednesday,” and.she:noted.that.her target date for filing federal
charges against Epstein was August 25, 2006. Acosta eimailed. Sloman, asking whether it was

“appropriate to approach [State Attorney Krischer] and. give him. a heads. up, re where we might
go?” Sloman:replied, “No for fear that.it will be leaked straight:to Epstein.”°

Although Lourie learned of the case at this point from. Sloman, and eventually took:a more
active role if supervising the investigation, Villafana continued to update Acosta, and Sloman.
directly: on the. progress of the case.*” Villatafia’s immediate: supervisor in. West Palm Beach had.
little involvement in supervising the Epstein, investigation, and at tities, Villafana directed her
emails to: Sloman, Menchel, ‘and Lourie without ‘copying her immediate. supervisor. In, the
immediate supervisor's view; however, “Miami” purposefully’ assumed _all'thé “authority” for the
case, which the. immediate supervisor regarded‘as “highly unusual.”*!

By late August.2006, Villafania and'the FBI had identified several additional victims and
obtained “some: flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell. phone records that ‘show. the:
coitimunication and travel in.interstate cominerce” by Epstein, and his associates: Villafana,
reported. to her supervisors that the. State Attorney’s Office’ would:not pr ovide: tr anscripts: from the
state grand jury voluntarily, and that she would_be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convinces him-to:
relinquish the. evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told. her supervisors that she: expected “
nuthber of fights” over her documerit demands, aiid. that. some partics were refusing ‘to comply

Villafana’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask:
whether. she was: referring to the victims.. Villafafia responded. thatthe problems did not involve:
victims, but rather a former employee. of Epstein and. some business entities that had objected ‘to
document ‘demands as over ly burdensome. Willafaiia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some:
victiins were “scared. and/or éimbarrassed,” and. soine, had beech intimidated. by’ the defense, but!
“everyone [with] whom the.agents have-spoken.so far has been.willing to tell-her story.” Villafana

Qs ‘On-the same day:, Sloman, emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yel briefed about the :case. not ing that:
Operation.Leap Y.car'was “a-highly sensitive:case involving Some:Palm.Beach-rich guy:”

a During his OPR. interview, Sloman did‘not tecall what:he meant: by. this remark, but speculated thatritwas
likely that“we-didn’t trust‘the:Palm Beach State Attomey’s Office.” and that he’believed there,may haye been “some:
type:ofirelationship between.somebody. in the [State Attorney’s: Office] ‘aiid:the/detense team.”

Av. After Villafana sent a.lenethy-stibstantive émail.about the case. to-her:immediate: stipervisor: Lourie, Sloman,
and. Acosta on August 23, 2006, Louric emailed'Sloman: “Do you.and, Alex [Acosta] want-her updating you.on,the:
case?” ’Sloman. responded, “APthis point, J don’ttreally care. If-Alex Says ‘something then Tl tell her'to justirun.at:
through. you-guys.”

AL OPR understood.“‘Miami” to, be; a-reference*to, the senior managers. who were located ‘in, the.Miami office,
thatsis, Acosta, Sloman, aid Meénchel. Records show; and Villatatia téld-OPR, that shée:believed Epstéin’s attoriieys
‘made axconscious decision to-:skip” her immediate:supervisor-and directed ‘their ‘communications to the supervisory
