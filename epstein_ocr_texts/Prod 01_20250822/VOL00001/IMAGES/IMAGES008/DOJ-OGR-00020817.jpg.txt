Case.22-1426, Document 57,02/28/2023, 3475900, Page199 of 208

‘The, Court denies’this motion:for substantially similar reasons ‘as ‘those. discussed. in:its
April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order. As.an initial‘matter, the Court reiterates that Maxwell's,
analysis of §'3283! is incorrect: As the Court:explained, § 3283 does:not call for a
“categorical approach” nor:an “essential ingredient” test, but instead:requires that the defendant's
conduct in‘that particular case 'involved.the, sexualabuse. of'a:minor. Maxwell, 202.1 WL
1518675 at *5-7. Here, there is no guestion.that:Maxwell is alleged:to have-engaged.in activity
‘that:constitutes the sexual abuse of a minor, with respect*to ‘the: sex.traflicking: counts.

‘But in any. event, as ‘the: Government pointed:out in.its’briefi— and as Maxwell. did.not
contest in’her reply —:§ 3283 is not the only statute. of limitations ‘that applies ‘to the:sex
‘trafficking counts. .As discussed above, in 2006, Congress enacted § 3299 to eliminate altogether,
‘the limitations period for the offense of sex trafficking children in violation of § 1591. See 18

‘Moreover, while the: alleged Sex trafficking in the S2:indictment is alleged tothave:
occurred prior to the enactment.of! § 3299.in 2006, the Court’holds that the provision nonetheless:
applies retroactively to cover'that conduct.. Ih its April 16,,202 | Opinion & Order; the Court
analyzed § 3283 under. the Landgraf'v. USA Lilm Products, 511 U.S. 244, 280 (1994) framework:
and concluded.that:the limitations period applicd retroactively so long‘as the: previous limitations
‘period-had notvyet expired. Maxwell, 2021 WL: 1518675, at *7-8. Similar to § 3283, which
states that “[nJo'statute of limitations that would-otherwise’preclude prosecution” shall. apply, the
language of § 3299 provides that an-indictment may: be instituted ateany: time for’certain offenses
“[nJotwithstanding‘any: other. law-” .As ‘discussed:in the Court’s' previous ‘opinion with.respect
to § 3283, this kind of language unambiguously requires that the limitations period apply

retroactively to prosecutions for offenses committed. before the:date of enactment so long, as the
