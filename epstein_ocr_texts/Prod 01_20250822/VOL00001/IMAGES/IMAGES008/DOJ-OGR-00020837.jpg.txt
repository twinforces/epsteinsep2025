QUeStion oecatuse they haven't adentutied a flight here.
MR. EVERDELG: Your Honor, I) think they've been fairly
clear. They say: If the defendant aided in the transportation

Qf Jane's return flight, out not the flight to New Mexico, The

only evidence we have of a flight tle Néw México wi'th Jané is
the one ih the flight logs, and it. is 4 flight to New Mexico.
And so the return flight. would be some ‘other Flight. besides: the
Flight tio New Mexico.

She is also alleged that -- and to pe honest, I, think
it was a little unclear what may have happened in New Mexico
eased on her testimony; out if ‘there was any illegal sexual
conduct, the flight: to New Mexico, this is what they are
devating, because they say, out not the Slight to New Mexico,
where/if thé antent was for Jane tO engagé in Sexual activity.

Okay. So, it. seems that. the jury is deliverating ‘or at

least trying to decide whether the flight to New Mexico was For

the purpose of engaging in illegal. sexual activity. And they
dre confused that the return flight that happéns after that,
could that be the oasis alone for a ‘conviction on Count Fours
Answer. 1S no, pecause that return Flight is not for the purpose
Qf illegal ‘sexual activity.

MS. MOE: Your Hoénor, at the very léast, tthe, answer 'to
this can"t be no, ‘ecause a jury could infer intent to engage
in sexual conduct and the return ©f a flight in. aiding and
acetting that.
