[The:prosecution] was: going forward on the'part ofthe state, and so
here is the big bad ‘federal. goverhment.stepping on. a, sovercign :
State, saying ‘you're not doing. enough, [when] to. my mind . the
whole idea of the [P]etite policy is. to recognize ‘that the []state.

is. an. independent entity,, and. that. we should presume: that what
they’te doing, is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except.
in the:most unusual of ‘circumstances.

Acosta, told OPR, that. “absent, USAO intervention,” ‘the state’s prosecution of Epstein.
would have become final, and. accordingly, it was" ‘pr udent” to employ Petite: ‘policy: analysis. In
Acosta’s. view, “the federal responsibility” in'this unique situation was merely to serve as a “back:
stop [to] state authorities:to ensure.that.there [was] no miscarriage of justice: »247 Acosta told.OPR.
that he ‘understood:the PBPD would not have. brought Epsteit to the FBI’s attention. if the State
Attorney had. pursued. charges that required. Epstein’ ‘$ incarceration. Acosta therefore:decided.that.
the USAO could avert a “manifest injustice” by forcing the state-to do; more and require, Epstein
to servetime in jail.and register as'a sexual. offender.

Acosta’s reasoning was flawed, and ‘unduly constricted. Acosta’s repeated ‘references to a;
“miscarriage of. justice” or “manifest injustice” echoes the* ‘manifestly inadequate” language: used
in the Petite.policy to define the-circuinstances in which the federal government may- proceed with,
a criminal case after a completed. state prosecution. Nothing i inthe Petite policy, however, requires
similar restraint When the federal, governmeiit:pursues, a case in the absence of'a completed, state
prosecution, even. if the ‘state is already ‘investigating the same.offense: The goal. of: the: Petite
policy i8 to prevent multiple proséeutions for the same offense, ‘not ‘to compel the, federal.
involved.in.the state prosecution expressed significant:concerns about it, and:there were: questions
regarding the state’ prosccutor’s commitment to ‘the case. Acosta ‘told ‘OPR that. “there are any
number of instances where'the federal government or the’state government can proceed and state:
charges are: substantially. less and different, and,..,.. the federal government... . stands aside: and.
lets:the state:proceed.” The fact that the federal gov ernment can.allow the state'to proceed with.a
prosecution, however, docs:not mean’the federal government is compelled to do so, particularly in,
a matter ‘in which a distinet.and important federal ‘interest exists. Indeed, the State Attorney told
OPR. that the. federal government regular ly ‘takes: over cases initiated by state investigators,
typically because federal char ges result in: “the’best.sentence.”

Epstein. was facing a. substantial sentence under the federal, sentencing guidelines.” “4
Despite the: Ashcroft-Memo’s directive that federal prosecutors pursue “the most ‘serious aan
provable offense,” Acosta’s decision to push “the state ‘to do: a little bit:more” does inet approach,
that standard. In. fact,.Acosta conceded during his OPR interview. that the: NPA. did not represent
an" ‘appropr ‘jate punishment” “in the federal system, nor even” ‘the best-outcoriie ii the state system,”
and that if the investigation. of Epstein. had. originated with the EBI, rather. than as a referral from
the.PBPD, the outcoiie might: have been different. As’U.S. Attorney, Acosta had the. authority’to
