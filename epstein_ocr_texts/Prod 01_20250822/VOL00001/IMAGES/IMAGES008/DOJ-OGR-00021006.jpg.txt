Banki, 685 F.3d 99, 118 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting United States v. Rigas, 490 F.3d 208, 228 (2d
Cir. 2007)). Thus, the defendant must show that “the challenged evidence or jury instructions
tied a defendant’s conviction to ‘behavior entirely separate from that identified in the
indictment.’” United States v. Bastian, 770 F.3d 212, 223 (2d Cir. 2014) (emphasis added)
(quoting United States v. Danielson, 199 F.3d 666, 670 (2d Cir. 1999)).

By contrast, “[a] variance occurs when the charging terms of the indictment are left
unaltered, but the evidence at trial proves facts materially different from those alleged in the
indictment.” Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 621 (quoting Hrank, 156 F.3d at 337 n.5). “Although the
distinction between constructive amendment and variance may appear “merely one of degree,’
there is an important difference in outcome: ‘a constructive amendment of the indictment is
considered to be a per se violation of the grand jury clause, while a defendant must show
prejudice in order to prevail on a variance claim.’” /d. (quoting Frank, 156 F.3d at 337 n.5); see
also Rigas, 490 F.3d at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must show ‘substantial prejudice’
to warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced by a
variance where the pleading and the proof substantially correspond, where the variance is not of
a character that could have misled the defendant at the trial, and where the variance 1s not such as
to deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same
offense.” Khalupsky, 5 F Ath at 294 (quoting Salmonese, 352 F.3d at 621-22). Moreover, when
a defendant has sufficient notice of the Government’s theory at trial, she cannot claim that she
was unfairly or substantially prejudiced. See United States v. Kaplan, 490 F.3d 119, 129-30 (2d
Cir. 2007).

Finally, the Court bears in mind that the Defendant brings her motion pursuant to Rule
33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and grant a new trial if the interest of
