Banki, 685 F.3d 99, 118 (2d Cir. 2012):(quoting United States-v. Rigas, 490 F.3d 208, 228 (2d.
Cir..2007)). Thus,, the defendant:must show that “the challenged. evidence or jury-instructions
‘tied-a.defendant’s conviction to, *behavior entireh; separate from.-that identified in the
‘indictment.”” United States v. Bastian, 770 F3d.212,.223 (2d:Cir. 2014) (emphasis added)
(quoting United States-v.. Danielson, 199 F.3d 666, 670 (2d Cir. '1999)).

‘By:contrast, “[a] variance: occurs: when the:charging-terms ‘ofthe indictment are‘left
unaltered, but the evidenceevat trial,proves facts materially different from those alleged in. the
indictment.” Sa/monese, 352 F.3d.at 621 (quoting Frank, 156: F.3d at 337 n.5). “Although the
distinction‘between constructive. amendment and variance may, appear ‘merely one of degree,”
‘there is an important difference:in outcome: ‘a.constructive amendment of the indictments
considered. to be a per se'violation of the grand jury clause, while a. defendant must show
prejudice. in order. to:prevail on a-varlance claim.” fd. (quoting Erank; 156 F.3d at.337 n.5); see
also Rigas, 490 F.3d.at 226 (“[A] defendant alleging variance must show “substantial prejudice’
‘to ‘warrant reversal.”). “A defendant cannot demonstrate that [s]he has been prejudiced bya
‘varlance where the pleading and the proof:substantially correspond, where the-variance is not of”
a.character’that could have misled:the defendant:at the trial, and-where:the variance is not such as
to'deprive'the accused of his right to be‘protected against another ‘prosecution for the same
offense.” -Khalupsky., ‘S\F.4th. at 294 (quoting Sa/monese, 352 F.3d. at 62:] -22). Moreover, when.
a.defendant has sufficient:notice of the Government’s’theory. at trial, she: cannot claim that she:
‘was-unfairly. or. substantially: prejudiced. See United States v: ‘Kaplan, 490. F.3d. 1 1.9, 129-30 (2d
Cir..2007).

Finally, the:Court bears: in-mind that the Defendant brings her: motion pursuant to Rule:

33, which permits the Court to “vacate any judgment and. grant:a.new trial-1f/the interest of
