resolution of the case to ensure Epstein’s victims were given an opportunity to attend the plea
hearing, and to possibly speak about the impact of Epstein’s crimes, presented a glaring contrast
with Acosta’s responsiveness to the demands of Epstein’s attorneys, which included the unusual
courtesy of allowing them to preview and respond to the USAO’s draft victim notifications. This
contrast added to the victims’ perception that they had been treated unfairly, a view shared by the
public.

Nothing in the documentary record suggests that Acosta thought through the issue of
determining which victims would be notified by the state, or that he took any steps to ensure that
all of the known federal victims received information about the state plea hearing. Instead, as with
his decision to resolve the federal investigation through a state-based resolution, Acosta exercised
poor judgment when he made critical decisions affecting the federal investigation and the victims,
but also failed to consider the full consequences of those decisions or what was needed to
implement them. Acosta’s failure to consider these issues before simply leaving the responsibility
for making notifications entirely to the State Attorney’s discretion reflected poorly on the USAO
and the Department as a whole. It left victims in the dark about an important proceeding that
resolved the federal investigation, an investigation about which the USAO had communicated with
victims for months. It also ultimately created the misimpression that the Department intentionally
sought to silence the victims by keeping them uninformed about the NPA and the resulting state
proceeding. Acosta failed to ensure that victims were afforded an opportunity to attend a hearing
that was related to their own cases and thus failed to ensure that victims were treated with
forthrightness and dignity.

V. VILLAFANA DID NOT COMMIT PROFESSIONAL MISCONDUCT IN HER
ORAL COMMUNICATIONS TO VICTIMS AND VICTIMS’ ATTORNEYS, IN
WHICH SHE DESCRIBED THE CASE AS “UNDER INVESTIGATION” BUT DID
NOT DISCLOSE THE EXISTENCE OF THE NPA TO SOME VICTIMS
From September 24, 2007, when the NPA was signed, until after Epstein’s June 30, 2008

state court plea, the case agents, acting under Villafafia’s direction, directly informed only three

victims that the government had signed an NPA and that, if Epstein complied with its terms, the
federal investigation would be closed. During this time period, Villafafia and the case agents
interacted with several victims and their attorneys, and Villafafia contacted victims’ attorney

Bradley Edwards to encourage him to attend the state court plea hearing, but she did not inform

victims or Edwards of the NPA or the resolution of the federal investigation.

As described in Part One of this chapter, after the NPA was signed, the FBI case agent and
co-case agent began notifying victims about the NPA.“° After speaking to three victims, however,
the FBI case agent became concerned that informing the victims about the NPA and the monetary
damages provision would create potential impeachment material for the victims and the agent
should Epstein breach the NPA and the case proceed to indictment and trial. As the case agent
told OPR, “I would . . . have to testify that I told every one of these girls that they could sue
Mr. Epstein for money, and I was not comfortable with that, I didn’t think it was right.” The case
430 Although Wild disputed that she was informed of the resolution of the federal case, the case agent’s email to
Villafafia from this time period reflects that at least one victim understood that the federal case was resolved and that
she was unhappy with the resolution.
