is subject to all rules of the court.!”? Attorney Admission Rule 6(b)(2)(A) makes clear that
attorneys practicing before the court are subject to the Florida Bar’s Rules of Professional Conduct
(FRPC). Moreover, the choice-of-law provisions contained within the relevant state’s rules of
professional conduct make the FRPC applicable to their conduct.
1. FRPC 4-1.1 —- Competence
FRPC 4-1.1 requires that a lawyer provide competent representation to a client.?°
Competent representation requires the legal knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation
reasonably necessary for the representation. A comment to the rule clarifies that the factors
relevant to determining a lawyer’s competence to handle a particular matter include “the relative
complexity and specialized nature of the matter, the lawyer’s general experience, the lawyer’s
training and experience in the field in question, the preparation and study the lawyer is able to give
the matter, and whether it is feasible to refer the matter to, or associate or consult with, a lawyer
of established competence in the field.” The comment further notes that “[i]n many instances the
required proficiency is that of a general practitioner.” With respect to particular matters,
competence requires inquiry into and analysis of the factual and legal elements of the problem.
The comment to Rule 4-1.1 explains that “[t]he required attention and preparation are determined
in part by what is at stake; major litigation and complex transactions ordinarily require more
extensive treatment than matters of lesser complexity and consequence.”
2. FRPC 4-1.3 — Diligence
FRPC 4-1.3 specifies that a lawyer should act with reasonable diligence and promptness in
representing a client. A comment to this rule explains, “A lawyer should pursue a matter on behalf
of a client despite opposition, obstruction, or personal inconvenience to the lawyer and take
whatever lawful and ethical measures are required to vindicate a client’s cause or endeavor.” A
lawyer must exercise “zeal” in advocating for the client, but is not required “to press for every
advantage that might be realized for a client.”
3. FRPC 4-4.1 — Candor in Dealing with Others
FRPC 4-4.1 prohibits a lawyer from knowingly making a false statement of material fact
or law to a third person during the course of representation of a client. A comment to this rule
explains that “[mJisrepresentations can also occur by partially true but misleading statements or
omissions that are the equivalent of affirmative false statements,” and “[w]hether a particular
statement should be regarded as one of fact can depend on the circumstances.”
tee See also 28 U.S.C. § 530B(a), providing that government attorneys are subject to state laws and state and
local federal court rules governing attorneys in each state where the government attorney engages in his duties.
200 The federal prosecutor does not have an individual “client,” but rather represents the people of the United
States. See generally 28 U.S.C. § 547 (duties of U.S. Attorney); 28 C.F.R. § 0.5(b) (the Attorney General represents
the United States in legal matters).
