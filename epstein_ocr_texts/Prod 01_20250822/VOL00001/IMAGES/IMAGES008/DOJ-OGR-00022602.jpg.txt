1 That's a hundred percent true. And the degree to
2 which that took place, I'm not -- I don't recall.

8 like. Going up through that time, you know, so in
9 the '16, '17, '18, up until the time he's arrested,
10 had your view or your understanding of what had
11 happened changed?
12 Meaning did you believe that in the late
13 "90s or early 2000s when he started, you know,
14 behaving much differently. Did you believe what you
15 were hearing about him at that point?
16 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: My views, I didn't
17 like the people he was with anyway. So I don't find
18 -- how do I say this? I don't like -- I like people
19 who my age or older, and I don't find the society of,
20 or the companionship of younger people who are young
21 people, I suppose, is really that enjoyable. So I
22 don't like the company that he chose to be with, and
23 so I just was -- I find it boring and fundamentally
24 uninteresting. That's probably the nicest way I can
25 say it.
