the: FBI squad supervisor on. May 9, 2007, to explain that. charges against. Epstein would not/be
quickly approved, he reported to Menchel that the FBI was “riot happy” about the. delay, adding,
“I did not even tell. them. I think.we should bri ing [Epstein] i in, once we decide to char ge him,, and
offer'a.pre-indictinent deal, figuring a judge mightnever agree'to such a,deal post indictrivent. That
would-have sent them-thru the roof.” Lourie explained.to OPR that he'thought a judge, after seeing.
ai indictment charging the full nature, and. scope of Epstcin’s condtict, might not agree toa plea.
involving ‘substantially less: time or to dismiss. substantive. charges."

Lourie told OPR that, despite Oosterbaan’s favorable opinion.of the case,. “[t]his'was .... a
bit of uncharted territory,” involving facts that were. unlike the: case. law Oosterbaan. had cited.
Although Lourie had sorie-coicerns about the legal issues and about-the witiesses, he “probably”
did not see any impediment to ‘going forward with the ‘case; :in. fact, Lourie “was not in favor. of
walking away, which is'what the defense wanted [the USAO] to do.” But while Lourie “thought:
we could-have: won and we could have prevailed through appeal,” he “didn’t think the: odds were
nearly as go0d_as' you Want ina criminal case, and... . the things that’ we had.to: gain [through a.
plea ‘agreement] were much. more than. [in] anormal ‘criminal case,” in.which the only cost of a
loss would be. that, the defendant did not go to jail. Lourie ‘told. OPR that to the best: of his
recollection, se thought a plea agreement would. be a good ‘result, and although. the. government.
might have to “give up: some jail time,” there were other. benefits:to'a plea, such as the ability-to
require Epstein to: register. as’ a, sex offender and the availability. of monetary damages for’ the
victims. Lourie :reealled “thinking that-this case should settle and-we should set it-up so we. can.
settle it” by, for example, charging Epstein by. complaint and. then negotiating a plea to limited
char ges in a criminal information. Villafaia told OPR. that she: agreed with Lourie that a criminal.
complaint, charging:an “omnibus conspiracy” containing “all, of the.information related ‘to what-the
case was about” would be:a good way to “get things moving™ “toward a pre-indictment plea.

Although Lourie and. Villafana belicved a pre-indictment. plea agreement. was a desired
resolution, there*was no guarantee'that:Epstein would.agree to plead guilty, and:they continued:to
work together'to shape an ‘indictment. On May: 1.0, 2007, Lourie emailed. Villafania:

[M]arie

T believe that Epstcin’s attlorneys] are scared. of the: victims they.
don’t know. Epstein has no doubt told them that there were may.

Thus I'believe the: f[ir]st indictment should contain only the victims
they have nothing, on, at.all.. We: can add in-the other ones that have
myspace: [sic] pages and prior testimony in, ‘a [superseding
indictment]. [think for the first strike we should. make all their
nightmare[]s come-true. Thoughts?"

al ‘Lourie explained,to OPR, that the; government*s dismissal of:counts sin ar indictment required the: court's
approval, and:that, while“it’s rare?” it'was possible that’a jude; sceing the nature and extent of Epstein’s conduct as:
set forth in anvextensive: indictment::might-not allow substantive counts-to‘be:dismissed.

ar ‘Louric’s, references to MySpace pages and “prior ‘testimony” referred ‘to the Impeachment’ information,
brought :fonvatd-by‘detense counsel. ,
