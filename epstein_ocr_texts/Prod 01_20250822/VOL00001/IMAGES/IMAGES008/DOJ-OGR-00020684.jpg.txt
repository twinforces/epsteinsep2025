11/08/2021 417 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's
supplemental letter regarding its opposition to the defense motion to exclude evidence of
Minor Victim-3. See Dkt. No. 387. The letter is submitted temporarily under seal to allow
defense counsel the opportunity to propose any additional redactions beyond what the
Government proposes. At the November 1, 2021 conference, the Court asked the
Government to provide its position as to whether Alleged "Victim-3" could be considered
a "victim" of the crimes charged in the indictment for any legal purpose, including for
purposes of restitution under 18 U.S.C. ยง 3663(a)(2). See Transcript at 71-72. The
Government's supplemental letter does not address this issue. While acknowledging that
the Court's request may have been unclear, the Government is now ORDERED to file a
supplemental letter responsive to the Court's question on or before 12:00 p.m. on
November 7, 2021. For the sake of clarity, the Government is directed to state its position
as to whether this anticipated witness could be deemed a victim of any of the crimes
charged in the indictment for any legal purpose, including for purposes of restitution
under 18 U.S.C. ยง 3663(a)(2). SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
