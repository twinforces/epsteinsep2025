Allegations in the Indictment Substantially
Prejudiced Maxwell.

In. the alternative, the Court ‘must vacate Maxwell’s convictions. on
Counts Three and Four because the record demonstrates a. variance between the
proof at trial and the allegations in, the Indictment that substantially: prejudiced
Maxwell as elaborated above.

Here, the Mann Act counts did not contain any allegations concerning’
Jane’s sexual.abuse in'New Mexico. Indeed, although. Jane had previously told
the FBI about the trip to New Mexico, she had denied. being sexually abused
there. It'was not until just before trial, that Jane claimed, for the first time that
she had engaged in, sexual, activity with, Epstein while she: was at the: ranch,

For the foregoing reasons, Maxwell’s convictions on:Counts. Three and
Four were based. on ‘a constructive amendment to the charged. offenses. The

‘Court, must;vacate these convictions and grant.a new trial on these counts.
