In:a Sunday, September: 16, 2007 email, Villafana informed.Lefkowitz that, she had drafted
a factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafatia
also noted that she was considering filing charges ‘in’the federal. district court, In Miami, “which,
will. hopefully: cut'the press coverage: significantly.” This email:received.considerable attention. 12
years. later" When it‘was jiiade public during’ the :‘CVRA litigation, anid was viewed as evidence of.
the'USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims: ‘Villafatia, however, explained to OPR.
that she. was concerted that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told
OPR, “[I]f [the:victims] wanted to attend. [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able ‘to. go into
the courthouse without:their faces’ being splashed. all over-the newspaper,” and that such publicity
was less likely to. -happen.in.Miami, where: the press “in-gencral-does not care about what. happens
in Palm Beach.”

Lefkowitz responded to Villafaiia with a revised version. of ther latest proposed “hybrid”
plea agreement, in a document, entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense: proposal.
introduced two: new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had. allegedly
facilitated, Epstein in his eriminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to:
prosecute them, as ‘well ascertain other unnamed ‘Epstein employees, ‘and a promise to forego
iMMig¢ration proceedings. against two ofthe female assistants:

Epstein’s fulfilling the terms, and. conditions; of the Agreement: also
precludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which:might.
otherwise ‘in the future ‘be: brought against [four named .female
assistants] or any employee of [a. Specific Epstein-owned corporate
entity]. for any criminal.char ge that arises out of the ongoing: federal
investigation . . . . Further, no, inimigration proceeding will be
‘instituted against [two. named. female assistants] ‘as a ‘result of: the:
