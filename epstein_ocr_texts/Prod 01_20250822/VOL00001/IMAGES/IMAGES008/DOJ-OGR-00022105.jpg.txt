Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 36 Filed 06/09/20 Page9of9
assertion that the Government, or any other agency that has operated as an arm of the
prosecution, is in possession or control of evidence that relates to the prevalence of falsifying
count slips in federal correctional facilities, or BOP leadership’s tolerance of such practices.

Moreover, to the extent that Thomas is seeking discovery in support of a selective
prosecution defense, he has not met the “rigorous” standard that applies for obtaining discovery
in aid of such a claim. United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.S. 456, 468 (1996). “[A] defendant
who seeks discovery on a claim of selective prosecution must show some evidence of both
discriminatory effect and discriminatory intent.” United States v. Bass, 536 U.S. 862, 863
(2002). Though Thomas claims that BOP supervisors may have acquiesced in his submission of
false count slips in this case, and that other BOP employees have submitted false documents in
other circumstances, he has not presented any evidence that those officers differed from him in
any protected characteristic—for example, that they were of a different race, sex, or ethnicity.
See Motion at 10. Nor has Thomas put forward any evidence of a discriminatory motive for his
prosecution.

Accordingly, Thomas’ motion to compel the Government to disclose evidence that the
submission of false count slips was widespread and tolerated at the BOP, and for discovery
related to selective prosecution, is DENIED.

CONCLUSION

For the reasons stated, Thomas’ motion to compel is DENIED. The Clerk of Court is
directed to terminate the motion at ECF No. 33.

SO ORDERED.
