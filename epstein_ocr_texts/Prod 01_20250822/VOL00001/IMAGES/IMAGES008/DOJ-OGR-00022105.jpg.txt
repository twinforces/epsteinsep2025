(2002)., Though, Thomas claims that BOP supervisors may have acquiesced:in his submission,of
false count slips inthis case, and ‘that.other BOP employees have ‘submitted ‘false documents in
other circumstances, he:has not presented. any evidence that those: officers differed from him. in
any protected, characteristic—for example, that they were of a:different-race, sex, or ethnicity.
Sée Motion at.10. Nor has Thomas put forward any: evidence ofa. discriminatory motive for'his
prosecution.

Accordingly, Thomas” motion to compel, the: Government to disclose! evidence’ that: the.
Subinission of false count.slips ‘was: widespread and tolerated at the BOP, and for discovery
related. to selective prosecution, is DENIED.

For the reasons stated, Thomas’ motion.to compel. is. DENIED. The Clerk of Court is
