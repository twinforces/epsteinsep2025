Annabi stands in tension with what the United States Supreme Court has
written about plea and immunity agreements. In Santobello, 404 U.S. 257 (1971)—
the seminal case on plea bargaining—the Supreme Court held that one prosecutor’s
promise in a plea agreement would bind other prosecutors, even those who might

a prosecutor’s office have the burden of ‘letting the left hand know what the right

Supreme Court held that an AUSA had a duty under Brady to disclose a promise of
immunity that another AUSA had made to a testifying witness, even though the first
AUSA had been falsely assured that no such promise was made. See 405 U.S. 150,
154 (1972) (“The prosecutor’s office is an entity and as such it is the spokesman for
the Government. A promise made by one attorney must be attributed, for these
purposes, to the Government”) (citing Restatement (Second) of Agency § 272).
