victims. Initially, Villafatia reached-out to a private attorney. who was.one of several suggested: to
her for-thatrole. Villafata notified Lefkowitz that she- was recommending the:attorney’to serve as
the: victims’ representative ‘and suggested. a. phone: conference: to discuss what. information, the:
USAO could.disclose to the attorney about the case: Villafatia told. Lefkowitz that she had.never
met the attorney, but he had. been recommended by “a good friend, in our appellate section” and by
one ofthe district judges in:Miami.’™ Over the next few days, Villafafia exchanged.messages with.
the.attorney about-the. possibility: of his. serving; as the: attorney:tepresentative: She also exchanged
emails with Lefkowitz, passing: along’ ‘procedural. questions raised by the attorney.

the: office; reviewed. the final, agreement, and immediately expressed. his disapproval of the.
provision authorizing the USAO ‘to select an attorney. representative :for the: victims, which he:
believed might raise the appearance of a conflict of interest. Instead, he proposed: that. a special.
master make the:selection. Although evidently frustrated by Sloman’s belated proposal, Villafatia
coriveyed, to Lefkowitz the suggestion that a special. master be appointed to select the attorney
representative, rather tham having the USAO make the selection.’*° She provided ‘Lefkowitz with
