The:potential. impropricty. that warrants a hearing, is not.that:somcone with a-history of
sexual abuse:may have served on.the:jury. Rather, it is Juror 50’s potential failure: to respond
truthfully to’ questions during the. jury selection process that asked. for such material information:
so that any potential bias could be explored. Accordingly, the Court will hold a hearing liniited
in scope ‘to Juror50’s answers to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire.

C. The Defendantihas notjustified an inquiry into Juror 50’s social media

The parties devote significant portions of the briefs to the question of whether Juror 50
answered falscly the Court's, questions about social media Usage diiring voir dife: To the extent
that the: Defendant seeks a hearing to-probe Juror ‘50’s answers to voir.dire about his social media
usage, her arguments are based.on speculation, and she has failed,to make the high showing,
required. See.Buker, 899 E.3d at.130. At-voir dire, when.asked if he:“use[s] social media,” Juror
50 stated, “Ido, but!I actually just deleted them. because I just got out.of'a relationship: and.I
didn’t want'to sce anything-regarding them. So lam fully off‘of it right now.”” Nov: 1.6, ‘202.1. Tr.
at.133. The Court then‘asked, “What.did you use, Facebook, Twitter?” to;which Juror 50. replied.

“Facebook.and Instagram,” clarifying that the accounts contained “[p]ersonal. stuff, like selfies.”

dd:

‘The screenshots proffered by the Defendant-do not demonstrate that.any of these answers
implicate Mcdonough. First, Juror 50 did. not-deny having a Twitter account. Second, Juror:
50’s.accounit:had only'] follower and followed only:39:people, which corroborates’ that his’
Twitter ‘tise was, at-most, relatively‘iminimal. See Maxwell Br. at 17. Third, the ‘factithat-Juror
50’8 Twitter account’ was opened ih-April 2021 and ‘thatihe Used it again.in.Jantary’2022, after
the: completion. of the trial, is consistent:with Juror ‘50’s answer that he deleted his: social media

accounts, or just'the social. media applications, shortly before:voir dire. The same is true ‘of Juror
