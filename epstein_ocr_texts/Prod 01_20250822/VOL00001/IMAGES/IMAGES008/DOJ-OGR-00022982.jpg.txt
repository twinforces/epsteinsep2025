PROFFER AGREEMENT

With respect to the meeting of Ghislaine Maxwell (“Client”) and his attorney, David Oscar
Markus, Esq., with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to be held at the Office of the United
States Attorney for the Northern District of Florida on July 24 and 25, 2025 (“the meeting”), the
following understandings exist:

(1) THIS IS NOT A COOPERATION AGREEMENT. The Client has agreed to
provide the Government with information, and to respond to questions, so that the Government
may evaluate Client’s information and responses in making prosecutive decisions. By receiving
Client’s proffer, the Government does not agree to make a motion on the Client’s behalf or to enter
into a cooperation agreement, plea agreement, immunity or non-prosecution agreement. The
Government makes no representation about the likelihood that any such agreement will be reached
in connection with this proffer.

(2) In any prosecution brought against Client by this Department, except as provided below
the Government will not offer in evidence on its case-in-chief, or in connection with any sentencing
proceeding for the purpose of determining an appropriate sentence, any statements made by Client
at the meeting, except (a) in a prosecution for false statements, obstruction of justice or perjury
with respect to any acts committed or statements made during or after the meeting or testimony
given after the meeting; or (b) if, at any time following the meeting, Client becomes a fugitive
from justice.

(3) Notwithstanding item (2) above: (a) the Government may use information derived
directly or indirectly from the meeting for the purpose of obtaining leads to other evidence, which
evidence may be used in any prosecution of Client by the Government; (b) in any prosecution
brought against Client, the Government may use statements made by Client at the meeting and all
evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom for the purpose of cross-examination should
Client testify; and (c) the Government may also use statements made by Client at the meeting to
rebut any evidence or arguments offered by or on behalf of Client (including arguments made or
issues raised sua sponte by the District Court) at any stage of the criminal prosecution (including
bail, all phases of trial, and sentencing) in any prosecution brought against Client.

(4) The Client understands and agrees that in the event the Client seeks to qualify for a
reduction in sentence under Title 18, United States Code, Section 3553(f), United States
Sentencing Guidelines, Sections 2D1.1(b)(18) or 5C1.2, or Fed. R. Crim. P. 35(b), the Office may
offer or use at any stage of the criminal proceeding any statement made by Client during the
meeting, and all evidence obtained directly or indirectly therefrom, to the extent such use is
consistent with Section 402 of the First Step Act of 2018.

(5) To the extent that the Government is entitled under this Agreement to offer in evidence
any statements made by Client or leads obtained therefrom, Client shall assert no claim under the
United States Constitution, any statute, Rule 410 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, or any other
federal rule that such statements or any leads therefrom should be suppressed. It is the intent of
this Agreement to waive all rights in the foregoing respects.
