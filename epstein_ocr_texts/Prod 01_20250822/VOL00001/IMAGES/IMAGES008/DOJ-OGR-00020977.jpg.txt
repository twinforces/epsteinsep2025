Circuit‘to ‘affirm the district court?s order-for a new penalty-phase:hearing. Maxwell Br. at 33
(citing Sumpson,, 724.F.3d at: 168).

The.Defendant nextrrelies on a state,court case, State, v., Afshar, 196.A.3d 93 (N.H. 2018),
‘in.which-a.court granted.a'new trial. inva.child sexual assault-case- when a juror-failed:to disclose
‘that-a babysitter. sexually: assaulted him when'he was, five. or six-years old. Maxwell Post-
‘Hearing Br.-at 5;.see also Maxwell Br. at 34.. But that-juror, had:previously-reported. an inability:
‘to be impartial in.another case involving sexual.assault ofa minor, and the court concluded that
‘there was “little’in ‘the way, of:logical explanation for how ‘he:could have differentiated between
‘the two,cases.” 1.96 A.3d.at 98. Such.is-not ‘the casehere:

Finally, in Burion v. Johnson, the Tenth, Circuit concluded that a juror was impliedly.
biased:when she suffered.an abusive relationship with her. husband that-was highly similar to:that
of the defendant. 948 F.2d 1150, 1158-59 (10th Gir. 1991). ‘However, notvonly had.that juror
deliberately ‘lied during voir dire about the.experience, but she was also’living in that abusive
situation-during ‘voir dire, the trial-itselfand her post-verdict testimony'to the.court.. Ld.

Cc onversely, Juror. 50 credibly testified.that his abuse “happened SO longiago” that it is not
something that he “think[s] about,” “it’s not'part of who [hevis].” Hearing Tr. at 47. And again,
the Court has not found that Juror. 50. deliberately: lied about‘his personal history.

The:Defendant’s remaining arguments:also fail to:alter the Court’s conclusion that Juror.
5011s not-biased. The Defendant contends that Juror 50°s post-trial conduct—in particular, his
‘posts on.social media and ‘his decision to. give interviews using his picture and. first name—is
“strong:evidence” of his bias because he'was “not looking:to'avoid-notice,” but rather to “soak.
up:his 15 minutes of fame.” Maxwell Post-Hearing Br, at 10-1], ‘The:Court disagrees that this

conduct:reveals bias., Whether wise or foolish, the! faet that a jurorimay give'an interview
