for example, it is possible to-transport a minorwith intent to engage*in criminal sexual activity

‘This approach: is analogous to the “categorical approach” employed by courts to, evaluate
prior. convictions for immigration-and sentencing purposes. See Taylor v. United'States,'495
U.S. 575), 602 (1990). Generally speaking, the “categorical approach” requires ‘that courts “look
only to. the statutory definitions—i.c., the elements” of:the relevant offense ‘to determine if the
provision applies'“and.not to the particular facts underlying those convictions.” Descamps v.
United States, 570 U.S..254, 261 (2013) (internal quotation marks omitted). Whetheria-statute

48, 58-60 '(2d.Cir. 201.7), the: Second. Circuit:discussedat length how the text, context, and
history of § 3283 show that Congress intended courts to apply the statute using'a‘case-specifie:
