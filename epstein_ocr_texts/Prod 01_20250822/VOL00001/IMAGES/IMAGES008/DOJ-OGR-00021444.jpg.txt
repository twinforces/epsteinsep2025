victims claiming that the matter was “under inv estigation” after the NPA was altcady. signed: and.
(3) not: ‘proper ly informing the victims that the state. plea would. also resolve: the federal.
ifivestigation. In. addition, the. petitioners , alleged that'the government violated their CVRA tight
to be treated with.fairness: by: concealing the NPA negotiation and also violated their CVRA right
