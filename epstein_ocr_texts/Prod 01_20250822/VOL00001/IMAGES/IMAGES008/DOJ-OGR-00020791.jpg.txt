D. Rule:404(b) material

Maxwell's final discovery requestzis, for early disclosure ofevidence. the Government
secks to offer under Federal. Rule. of’ Evidence 404(b). Under Rule 404(b), ifthe: prosecutor ina
eriminal. case. intends to use “evidence of a crime, ‘wrong, or other act” against a‘defendant, the.
‘prosecutor'must “provide reasonable:notice, of the general nature of any: such evidence that the
‘prosecutor intends ‘to offer-at trial” and .must’“do so in, writing before. trial—orin any form
during trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.” The:Government
represents thatit will notify. the defense of its intent to-use:404(b) evidence at least 45 days in
advance oftrial to,allow.Maxwell to file:any motions in.limine to be considered.at the ‘final
pretrial conference. The Government's: proposal -will give Maxwell an opportunity-to challenge
admission of that evidence and to bring to the Court’s attention any:issues that require:resolution.
before trial. “This.is.all. that‘Rule-404(b) requires.” United States v. Thompson,'No. 1'3-cr-378
(AJN), 2013 WL 6246489, at *9 (S:D.N2Y. ‘Dee. 3, 2013).. The Gourt concludes this schedule is
generally reasonable, although additional time to enable. bricting and.resolution.in advance of
trial is strongly encouraged.

The: Court’s denial of Maxwell’s ‘requests to compel pretrial. disclosures doesnot preclude
the parties from-negotiating in good faith foran expedited discovery timeline that will account
for:Maxwell’s specific concerns. “(Jn most criminal cases, ‘pretrial disclosure will-redound to.
the benefit of all parties, counsel,.and the:court.” United-States v. Rercevault, 490: F.2d 1.26, 132
(2¢-Cir, 1974). Iv general, the:Court will require the parties to:negotiate:a-final, omnibus
schedule'to propese'to the Court, The Court concludes that the disclosure ofall of the'above:

materials approximately'six, to eight weeks in advance of trial 1s:appropriate:and sufficient.
