1 in this matter, which includes the Rule 16 materials relevant

2 to the criminal charges that have been brought against the

3 defendants.

4 MR. FIGGINS: Your Honor, to be more specific, one of
5 the issues here is going to be the conditions and the

6 supervision and the policies that were upheld and advanced by

7 the Bureau of Prisons. That is what the inspector general's

8 report is investigating. That's very important information

) that's relevant to this case and relevant to the defense. I'm
10 not saying we have to hold up our case forever, but we should
11 at least get some type of idea as to the status of that report
12 and when it's going to come out or when they're going to

13 complete the actual report because I believe that there's going
14 to be a lot of information that may be relevant to our defense,
15 and it may not be specifically just about this particular

16 investigation.

17 There's been multiple information in the media now

18 with respect to testimony by the head of the Bureau of Prisons,
19 information released by the U.S. Attorney himself regarding
20 this investigation with respect to this case, so I believe that
21 we will need that information. If we're hearing that those
22 people are making statements about that report with respect to
23 this case, clearly there's going to be information and
24 potentially statements and other information that we may need.
25 So I think it's important that we at least try to get an idea
