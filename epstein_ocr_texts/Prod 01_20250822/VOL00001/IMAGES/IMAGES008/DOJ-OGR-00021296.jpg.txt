[S]ince the signing of the September 24th agreement,.more'than.two
mionths[] ago, it, has become clear that. several attorneys’ on. ‘your
legal. team are dissatisfied with that result.

[You], Professor Dershowitz, ‘former Solicitor [General] Stair,
former United States Attorney Lewis, Ms. Sanchez and. Messrs.
Black, Goldberger and. Lefcourt previously had. the. opportunity to
review. and ‘raise: objections to the terms of the Agreement. The
defense teain, however, after extensive negotiation, chose. to; adopt-
the: Agreement. Since. then counsel have objected to several steps
taken ‘by the U.S. Attorney’s Office to effectuate the terms of the
Agreement, in, essence presenting collateral challenges to: portions
of'the Agreement.

Tt is not the ‘intention of this Office ever to require a defendant to
enter a plea against:his wishes. Your‘client:has the right to proceed,
to trial. If your client is dissatisfied with-his Agreement, or believes
that. it if unlawful or Unfair, We Stand ready’ to unwind the
Agreement.

In.-a.. separate, seven:page letter to Starry with Villafafia’s and, Sloman’s input, Acosta,
responded to the substance of Starr’s November 28 letter. to Assistant Attorney General Fisher.
Fisher told OPR that: she. didnot recall why Acosta, rather thai her office, responded’ tothe letter,
but she conjectured that * ‘probably: I was trying to make sure that somebody responded since [the
Criminal Division wasn’t] going: to-respond. 213

In-his:seven-page:letter, sent-to Starr. on December 4, 2007, .Acosta wrote:

The: Non-Prosecution Agreement. entered into between. this Office
resolution. of his: state: and..federal. criminal liability. Under ‘this
Agreement, this District has agreed to defer prosecution for
of Florida, provided... Mr. Epstein satisfies three general federal
interests: (J). that Mr. Epstein plead. guilty to a “registerable”
offense; (2) that ‘this plea include a binding: recommendation fora
‘sufficient terny of imprisonment; and (3) that. the Agreement, not.
tharm.the interests of his victims.

Acosta. explained ‘in the: letter that the: USAO’s intent’was “to: place the identified victims
in the, saine position as, they Would have been had Mr. Epsteii. been convicted at trial, No: more:
no less.” Acosta documented. the USAO’s understanding of the operation of the NPA’s § 2255

The ESAO may haye.been-asked tovrespond because Starr's letter raised issues;that-had:not been previously
raised with.the US AO} and:it:would normally fall.to the USAO fo address'them 4in-the first instance.
