B. The Co-Conspirators Provision of the Non-Prosecution Agreement

Binds the USAO-SDNY and Annabi is not to the Contrary.

Embedded within Annabi’s canon of construction that prosecutors in one
district cannot bind prosecutors in another district, is a requirement that there must
be a complete absence of language expressing a broader intention. Thus, if "it
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction,"
Annabi’s restrictive rule does not apply. U.S. v. Russo, 801 F.2d 624, 626 (2d Cir.
1986).

The language expressing a broader intention can be found in the NPA, which
(1) explicitly states that “the United States also agrees that it will not institute any
criminal charges against any potential co-conspirators of Epstein” (A178), (2)
contains a structural separation of this clause from the more restrictive language used
elsewhere, and (3) utilizes the expressed language that Epstein intended a “global”
agreement. Obviously, an intent to limit the immunity afforded the co-conspirators
easily could have been made explicit by the incorporation of limiting language. No
such language was utilized and was, in fact, removed from the co-conspirator clause.

A promise to bind other districts can be inferred from negotiations between a
defendant and a prosecutor. See United States v. Alessi, 554 F2d 1139,1153-4 (2d
