I. The Defense Rejects the Federal Plea Agreement, Returns: to. the NPA.
“State-Only” Resolution, and Begins Opposing the Sexual Offender
Registration Requirement

After having spent days negotiating the: federal charges to be included in’a plea agreement,
by the afternoon of September 20, 2007, the:defense rejected the federal pleaoption,.and the parties
resumed negotiations overthe details of an NPA calling: for Epstein’ to‘plead.to only state charges.
Through multiple emails and attempts (some: successful) to speak directly with Acosta and ‘other
supervisors, defense attorneys vigorously fought the USAO’s insistence that: Epstein, plead. to a.
‘state charge:requiring sexual. offender:registration.

After receiving the: federal plea agreement, ‘Lefkowitz spoke with Villafania. She reported.
to Acosta and Lourie ‘that Lefkowatz told her ‘the defense ‘was “back to doing the: state- scares
that she had told defense counsel that “We: need a signed aereemont by-tomorrow’ (Friday? or we
are [filing charges] on Tuesday.”

Lefkowitz emailed Villafana about the draft NPA ‘that she had sént'to him, poifiting out:
that it:called for a.20-month jail.sentence followed by 1.0 months of community. control, rather than
18 inonths if jail and. 12. under conimunity coftrol, and to ask if the USAO had. “aity flexibility”
on. the: §2255'procedure. Villafana-responded:

The 18:and 12 has already been agreed 'to by our office, so that is
nota problem. On the issue about 18 [U.S:C. §].2255, we seem to
be miles apart. Your most recent version not only had. ine binding
the girls to: a trust fund. administered by the state court, but also
promising thatthey will give tp their [$] 2255 rights.

T reviewed the: e-mail that, I sent, you on Sunday-with the comments
on.some of your other changes. In the context of a non-prosecution,
agreement, the office:may be: more willing to be specific about not.
pursuing charges against others. However, as I'stated on Sunday,
the Office cannot.and will not bind: Immigr ation.

Also, your timetable will ‘need to moye up significantly. As [State
Attorney] Barry, [Krischer] said in.our:mecting last-week, his office
can.put together a’plea-agreemient, [and an] information, and-get-you.
all before ‘the [state] judge*on.a:change of plea within a day.

Willafana alerted Krischer that evening, that negotiations were “not going. very’ well” and
that defense counsel, “changed ‘theit-minds. again, and they only wantito plead to state chat ees, not!
concurrent state ‘and .federal.” She: added, “If we cannot reach... an agreement, then I need. to
[charge] the case on Tuesday [Septeiiber 25] andTwill net budge froin that date.”

In. response to Villafafia’s report of’her conversation. with. Lefkowitz about the defense
preference for a “state-charges-only agreement,” Lourie alerted her that, “He wants'to get out of
[sexual offender] registration which we:should not agree to.” Lourie emailed.Acosta:
