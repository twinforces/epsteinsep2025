The meeting of USAO representatives and Epstein’s; defense attorneys, together with the
State Attorney and the lead, state: prosecutor on September 12, 2007, was a necessary part. of the
NPA negotiation process.

Even-after the: NPA. was signed, the defense continued ‘to request:meetings and reviews of,
the: case, both within. the USAO and. by: the Department’s Criminal, Division and the Deputy
Attorney General. Although limited reviews were’ gr: anted.. during this period there was only one
substantive meeting with. Acosta, on. December 14,'2007.7**. This, mecting, occurred in lieu of the:
meeting Starr had requested of Assistant Atiomey General, Fisher, most likely because the defense
submissions to: the. Department’s Criminal ‘Division. had. raised issues not previously.raised. with
the. USAO and the:Departinent determined that-Acosta should.addiess those in the first instance.”
Acosta told. OPR that he:did.not ask for the Department: ‘review,, but he also.did notwant to appear
as if he “fear[ed]” that review. .Acosta’s nuanced. position, however, was not clear to. the
Department.at attor neys’ who responded to: Epstein’ S appeals and. who perceived. ‘Acosta to Beil in favor or
or reviews s resulted in “the USAO abandoning the NPA, and. Epstein gained. no “substantial.
advantage from his continued entreaties. .

In.sum, in.ev aluating the: subjects’ conduct, OPR.considered.the:number of meetings,, their
purpose, the content of the. discussions, and decisions inade afterwards. OPR cannot say. that the
number of: meetings, particular ly. those: occurring before the NPA. was: signed, was so far outside
the norin—for a high profile case. with: skilled defense attorneys—that ‘the quantity of meetings
alone shows that the subjects were:motivated- by improper favoritism. In evaluating the: subjects’
conduct, OPR considered thatthe mectings were held with different levels of USAO managers and.
that the: explanations for the decisions to participate ‘in, the meetings reflected reasonable strategic.
goals. Although OPR. cannot rule: out ‘the possibility: that because Acosta, Menchel, Lourie, or
Sloman knew or knew of the defense attorneys, they may have'been willing'to meet with’them, It.
‘is also true that prosecutors routinely. meet'with defense:attorneys, including those who are:known,
to them and. those who are not. Furthermore, mectings are ‘more likely to occur in, high, profile
cases:involving defendants withthe financial resources‘to hire skilled.defense counsel ‘who:request
meetings at/the highest levels.of the USAO and the Departinent: Most. Significantly, OPR. did fot:
find evidence supporting, a conclusion. that. the meetings themselves resulted. in any substantial.
benefitto the defense. At cach mecting, defense. counsel strongly pressed the USAO—on factual,
legal, and: ‘policy grounds—to forgo: its federal. inv. estigation: and to:return.the matter. to the state to
procéed as itisaw fit. The USAO never yielded on that point. Accordingly,‘OPR did noti find.
evidence supporting a ‘conclusion that Acosta, 'Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, or. ‘Villafata met. with.
défense counsel.‘for the purpose. of benefiting Epstein, or that the meetings themselves caused,
Acosta-orthe other subjects to'proyide:improper benefits to Epstein.
