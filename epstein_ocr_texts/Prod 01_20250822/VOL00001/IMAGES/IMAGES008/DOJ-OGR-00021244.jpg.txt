e-mail that I:would like to address, and I:also would like to address
Where.-We. are if the case.

First, I wanted to address ‘the, comment: about jumping the chain of
command. After that-concern was brought to my attention several
months ago, I have tried-very, hard ‘to ‘be: cognizant of ‘the chain of
command, ...,. Ifthere is:a-particular‘instance-of violating the chain.
of. command that you would like ‘to discuss, I would. be ‘happy: to
discuss it with you,

The: statement. that I have: not respected .Alex’s position. regarding
the: prosecution of ‘the case demonstrates why you hear the
frustration. in. the tone of my-e-mail. For two: and a half months: 1
have been asking about ‘what: that: position. is. I have asked. for’
direction on whether. to: revise the ‘indictment, whether there are
other issues ‘that; Alex warits: addressed, prior to deciding,’ whether
there is ‘additional investigation. that-nceds to be. done, .ctc.. None of
that. direction has, been ‘forthcoming, so I ain left with. . . victims,

to ‘do work:to collect the evidence establishing a tederal nexus,, and.
I noted the time and money that would, be required for an.
investigation. I said that: I: was ‘willing to invest that time and the
FBI was Willing-to invest the money, but-I didn’t want'to get to: the
end and then have: the: Office be intimidated by the: high- powered.
lawyers., [was assured thatithat;would not happen. Now I'féel like
there is ‘a glass ceiling that’prevents me‘ from moving : forward. while
evidence suggests that Epstein is continuing to engage: in ‘this
criminal behavior, Additionally, the FBI has identified two more
Victims. Ifthe case is not going;to go forward, [think it.is unfairto
give hope to more girls.

AS far as promising the FBI thati an. .indictinent was, a foregone
‘conclusion, ‘I don’t know. of any case in. the Office where ‘an
investigation has been opened with the plan NOT ‘to indict. And]
have: never presented an indictment package that has resulted. in’a
declination. I didn’t ‘treat this case any differently. [worked with
the agents to gather the evidence, and | prepared. an, indictment.
package that I believe establishes probable. cause: that:a series of
ctimes have been committed. More importantly, I. believe there’ is
