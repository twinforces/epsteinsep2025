Menchel made several substantive changes to Villafafia’s draft letter. He specified that “a
two-year term of state imprisonment” was the minimum sentence that would satisfy the federal
interest in the case. (Emphasis added.) With regard to the option of a federal plea, Menchel wrote
that the USAO “would be willing to explore a federal conviction” and retained the reference to a
Rule 11(c) plea. Menchel also removed the reference to the specific state offenses to which Epstein
would be required to plead guilty. Menchel forwarded the redraft to Acosta, suggesting that they
speak about it the next morning, as well as to Sloman, Lourie, and Villafafia.

The final letter, as shown on the following pages, was identical to Menchel’s redraft, except
that it omitted all reference to a federal plea under Rule 11(c).”!

a Menchel told OPR that he did not disfavor Rule 11(c) pleas but knew that the USAO believed the judges
were generally averse to them. He did not recall why the provision was dropped from the letter, but “assumed” it was
a decision by Acosta. In a September 6, 2007 email, Villafafia told Sloman that she and Menchel had discussed a
Rule 11(c) plea, but she opined that Menchel “must have asked Alex about it and it was nixed.” Villafafia told OPR
that Lourie, too, had told her Acosta did not want to do a Rule 11(c) plea.
