assigned to work from 4 p.m. to 12 a.m. (“Officer-2"). MICHABi |
THOMAS, the defendant, started his shift in the SHU at 12 a.m. on |
August 10. From 12 a.m. until 8 a.m. on August 10, NOEL and THOMAS
were the only two officers on duty in the SHO. |

16. During the time period from 4 p.m. on August 9 to |
8 a.m. on August 10, the officers on duty in the SHU, inciuding |
TOVA NOBEL and MICHAEL THOMAS, the defendants, were responsible for :
conducting five institutional counts: 4 p.m, and 10 p.m. on August |
9; and 12 a.m., 3 a.m., and 5 a.m. on August 10. . NOEL, THOMAS and
the other officers on duty were also naspens thie for completing
paperwork attesting to each of those counts. While, as detailed
herein, count slips were completed for each institutional count,
in fact, not a single one of those institutional counts was done.

17. TOVA NOEL, the defendant, and Officer-1l were
responsible for conducting the 4 p.m. institutional count in the
SHU. As video from the MCC’s internal video surveiilance system
makes clear, NOEL and Officer-1 did not perform the 4 p.m. count.
Nonetheless, NOEL and Officer-1 completed and signed a count slip
that falsely stated that the 4 p.m. institutional count had been
performed. In reliance on that falsified count slip, at
approximately 5:03 p.m., the Control Center cleared the 4 p.m.
count. |
