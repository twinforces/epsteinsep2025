authority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily provable offense”
requirement.

Although Acosta could not recall specifically how or by whom the decision was made to
allow Epstein to plead to only one of the three charges identified on the original term sheet, or how
or by whom the decision was made to reduce the sentencing requirement from two years to 18
months, Acosta was aware of these changes. He reviewed and approved the final NPA before it
was signed. Department policy gave him the discretion to approve the agreement, notwithstanding
any arguable failure to comply with the “most serious readily provable offense” requirement.
Furthermore, the Ashcroft Memo does not appear to preclude a U.S. Attorney from deferring to a
state prosecution, so it is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply to a situation involving state
charges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation of an agreement that allowed Epstein
to resolve the federal investigation in return for the imposition of an 18-month state sentence did
not violate a clear and unambiguous standard and therefore does not constitute professional
misconduct.

pa The USAO’s Agreement Not to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential
Co-Conspirators” Did Not Violate a Clear and Unambiguous
Department Policy

Several witnesses told OPR that they believed the government’s agreement not to prosecute
unidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted to “transactional immunity,” which the
witnesses asserted is prohibited by Department policy. Although “use immunity” protects a
witness only against the government’s use of his or her immunized testimony in a prosecution of
the witness, and is frequently used by prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from
prosecution altogether and is relatively rare.

OPR found no policy prohibiting a U.S. Attorney from declining to prosecute third parties
or providing transactional immunity. One section of the USAM related to immunity but applied
only to the exchange of “use immunity” for the testimony of a witness who has asserted a Fifth
Amendment privilege. See USAM § 9-23.100 ef seg. Statutory provisions relating to immunity
also address the same context. See 18 U.S.C. § 6002; 21 U.S.C. § 884. Moreover, apart from
voluntariness or enforceability concerns, courts have not suggested that a prosecutor’s promise not
to prosecute a third party amounts to an inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,
e.g., Marquez, 909 F.2d at 741-43; Kemp, 760 F.2d at 1248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 909; Frazier,
697 So. 2d 945. OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard that was violated by the USAO’s
agreement not to prosecute “potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot conclude that
negotiating or approving this provision violated a clear and unambiguous standard or constituted
professional misconduct.

Notwithstanding this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR includes in its criticism of
Acosta’s decision to approve the NPA his approval of this provision without considering its
potential consequences, including to whom it would apply.
