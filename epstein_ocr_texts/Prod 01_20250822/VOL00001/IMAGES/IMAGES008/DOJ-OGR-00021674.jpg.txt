A. Relevant Facts

In 2005, the Palm Beach Police Department in
Florida opened an investigation into Epstein on the
complaint of the parents of a fourteen-year-old girl.
The Palm Beach Police ultimately brought the investi-
gation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in West
Palm Beach, which in turned opened an investigation
with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern Dis-
trict of Florida “USAO-SDFL’). (SA3). That investiga-
tion culminated in a draft sixty-page indictment pro-
posing to charge Epstein for the sexual abuse of multi-
ple victims. (SA3).

In 2007, the USAO-SDFL and Epstein entered into
a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”). (A.173). The
agreement was signed “on the authority of R. Alexan-
der Acosta, United States Attorney for the Southern
District of Florida.” (A.175). Under the terms of the
NPA, Epstein agreed to plead guilty in a pending Flor-
ida state case and to receive a sentence of at least
eighteen months’ imprisonment and twelve months’
community control. (A.176). He also consented to juris-
diction in the Southern District of Florida for civil suits
involving victims specified by the USAO-SDFL, among
other terms. (A.177). In exchange, USAO-SDFL
agreed to defer “prosecution in this District.” (A.175).
Once Epstein completed his half of the bargain, the
NPA provided that “no prosecution” for the offenses
then under investigation by “the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation and the U.S. Attorney’s Office ... will be
instituted in this District.” (A.175).

The NPA also provided that, if Epstein complied
with the agreement, “the United States also agrees
