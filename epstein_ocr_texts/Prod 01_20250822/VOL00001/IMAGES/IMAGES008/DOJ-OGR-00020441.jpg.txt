11/03/2021 | 413 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motions
for reconsideration. See Dkt. Nos. 407, 408. The Government is hereby ORDERED to
respond to Defendant's motion for reconsideration, Dkt. No. 408, on or before
November 8, 2021. As to the motion for reconsideration regarding the disclosure of
juror names, the Court reminds counsel of the following. First, as the Court previously
indicated, the lawyers will be provided the names of jurors on November 16, prior to
the commencement of the voir dire process. Second, the Court has now resolved the
logistical issues regarding the ability to conduct peremptory challenges on November
29 and the Court can now confirm that peremptory strikes will not be exercised until
November 29. Finally, as previously indicated, although only 40 qualified jurors are
needed for the exercise of peremptory strikes, the Court will seek to qualify
approximately 50 to 60 prospective jurors to return on November 29 for the exercise of
peremptory strikes. If counsel for either side learns of any additional information that
would be a basis for a strike for cause prior to November 29, they shall immediately
raise the issue with the Court. Bearing in mind this information, the Government is
ORDERED to respond to Defendant's motion for reconsideration, Dkt. No. 407, on or
before November 4, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

supplemental letter regarding its opposition to the defense motion to exclude evidence
of Minor Victim—3. See Dkt. No. 387. The letter is submitted temporarily under seal to

considered a "victim" of the crimes charged in the indictment for any legal purpose,
including for purposes of restitution under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2). See Transcript at
