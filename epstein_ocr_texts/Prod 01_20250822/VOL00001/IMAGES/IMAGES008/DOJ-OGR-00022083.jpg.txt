supra) defenses, is not: legally-required and would impose a.nearly insurmountable obligation, on,
the Government of:marshaling and reviewing*information.and data, in the possession ofan entirely’
scparate entity.
1. Applicable Law

As described. above, Rule 16, Brady, and, Giglio apply to materials in the Government’s
“possession.” As a gencral.:matter, while “[a]n individual prosecutor is presumed... . to have
knowledge of: ‘all information gathered, in. connection, with ‘his office’s. investigation of. the
casc,.. . knowledge'on the part'of persons employed by a different office of the government’ does
not in all instances warrant. the imputation of knowledge to the prosecutor.” United States: v.
Avellino, 136 F.3d 249, 255 (2d. Cir. 1998) (citations omitted). The: imposition of such “an,
unlimited. duty’on a prosecutor to inquire of other offices not working with the prosecutor’s office:
onthe casc’in, question would inappropriately require us to adopt a monolithic. view of government?
that would “cordémn ‘the prosecution of criminal. cases. to a state of paralysis.” Jd. (citation &
quotation. marks omitted); see ulso..Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419,437 (1995) (Government’s
discovery and disclosure obligations extend only to information in ‘the custody of the ‘prosecutor:
or. “others. acting on the government’s behalf’ in. the case”). Thus, discovery’ and disclosure
‘obligations only ‘extend. “information. known to: persons ‘who: are a part of the ‘prosecution,
‘team’... .. who perform investigative dutics or make strategic decisions ‘about: the :prosccution of
the case,” including “police officers and. federal agents who: submit to: the direction. of the:
prosccutor and:participate in the investigation.” Wiited States v. Barcelo, 628 F. App’x 36, 38:(2d.
Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). Brady'is not a basis to compel the Government.to gather:information

in. the possession. of third partics on.bchalf'of the defense. See United: States'v. Yousef, 327 F.3d.
