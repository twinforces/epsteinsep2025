M6SQmax1

the Gefendant was: an organizer or leader, ana that the criminal

activity either involvea five or more participants or was

otherwise extensive. The guigelines coefines a participant. as a

person who is criminally responsible for the ‘commission of the

offense but meeda not have been convicted.
So I think. my question for the government i's, you'ne
asking the Court to look to as a Criminally responsible -- a

person ‘who is criminally responsible for the commission of the

offense over whom Ms. Maxwell. exercised supervisory or
leadership role.

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. As we noted in our
briefing; our view is that the trial eviaence establishes that

the agefendant haa a supervisory role over Sarah Kellen. Here,

wé're not Féquiréd to establish that. there were five or more

participants; that 1s, people who ‘were criminally ‘responsible
fer the charged .conduct, but rather that it was extensive, and
that the aéfenoant Supéervisea at. least one othér person.
That's the text of the commentary, although as we noted, the

Seconda. Circuit in applying this factor hasn't really engaged

with, that from what we can, tell, but. on the factual question, of

the trial récora ana whéthér it é6staéblishes the oéfendant
Superviseo another participant; it. absolutely ooes.

‘THE COURT: And the government is pointing to Sarah.
Kéllén for that Gonclusion, which you agreé, théré has to ‘bé
one criminally responsible participant who we can point to.
