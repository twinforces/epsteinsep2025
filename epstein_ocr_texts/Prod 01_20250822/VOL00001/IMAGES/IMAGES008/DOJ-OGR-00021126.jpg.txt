Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page79 of 113
Court decision, McDonough Power Equipment, Inc. v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548,
104 S. Ct. 845 (1984).

In any event, there was ample evidence establishing that Juror 50 harbored
actual bias and that the similarities of his child sexual abuse to the case supported a
finding of implied and inferred bias at the time of jury selection such that, had
Juror 50 given truthful answers at the time of jury selection, Defendant would have
interposed a valid challenge for cause. A new trial must be ordered.

B. Applicable Law

“When it is discovered that a juror gave false answers during voir dire, any
motion for a new trial must first be analyzed under the Supreme Court’s test in
McDonough Power Equity v. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548 (1984). Under a two-part
test, a party must show that “a juror failed to answer honestly a material question
on voir dire.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at 556. Second, the party must show that “a
correct response would have provided a valid basis for a challenge for cause.” Jd.
Moreover, a new trial can be ordered without a finding of actual prejudice. Arizona
v. Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279, 307-10 (1991). The standard of review for a district
court’s denial of a motion for a new trial is abuse of discretion. See, Rivas v.
Brattesani, 94 F.3d 802, 807 (2d. Cir. 1996).
