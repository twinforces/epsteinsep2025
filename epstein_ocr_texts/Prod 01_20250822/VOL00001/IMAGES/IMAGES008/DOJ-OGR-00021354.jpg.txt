‘Menchel. ‘told OPR. that when. he and. Sanchez were in. the USAO, they had a. social
relationship, which included, in 2003, “a:handful of dates over'a period of two to three weeks. We
decided that . . . this was probably. best not.to pursue, and. we: mutually agreed to not do that.”?”°
Apait from that, ‘he stated they were “close” and “hung out,” and, he. asserted that'this was known.
in the office at the time. Menchel said that his relationship with: Sanchez “changed dramatically”
when she leftithe office for private practice, and that bythe:time he became involved.in the Epstein
‘investigation, he had.dated and married his wife, and-his:contact.with-Sanchez: would “most likely”
have ‘been at office events and when. she attended his wedding. °27 ‘Menchel added, * “[T ]hat was:
three and-a.half years [prior] ‘for a very briefperiod-of time, and J don’t think, I gave it-aimoment’s
thought.”

‘When.asked by OPR. about the: basis for the decision. to: make an. offer of.a two-year'term
of inearecration, Menchel saidthat:he did not recall discussions about the two-year offer and did
not recall-how: the office*arrived at.that figure. In-response'to OPR’s question, Menchel stated-that.
his relationship~with Sanchez did “[nhJot at all” affect his handling of the Epstein case.. Moreover,
Mencheliasserted.that the contemporancous documentary. record supports'a conclusion-that it was
Acosta, not.Menchel, who:made ‘the: decision to resolvethe case with the two-year term.

OPR carefully considered the documentary record on this point, as well as the statements:
to OPR. from Menchel, Villafana, Sloman; and Acosta, and. concludes that there is no evidence
supporting the. suggestion that the plea’ was instigated by Menchel. as a-favor. to defense counsel.
The USAO?’s first pléa overture to, defense counsel, Which took place Sometime before June 26,
2007, occurred when ‘Menchel. spoke: with. Sanchez about the possibility of resolving the: federal.
ease With a state plea. that required jail time, and sexual offender registration. According to the
email, “[i]t was a non-starter” forthe defense. In the lengthy email exchange with Villafafia in
carly July. 2007, Menchel.told her that his discussion with Sanchez about:a, state-based resolution
was made with Acosta’s “full knowledge.” Acosta corroborated this statement, telling OPR ‘that.
although. he did not remember a specific conversation with Menchel. concerning a state-based
resolution, he was certain Menchel would:not have discussed this potential resolution with defense

counsel “without having, discussed it.with. me.*22* Moreover, the defense: did not immediately

obligation to inform, his: Supervisors: of his | g-relationship.. The Professiona esponsi ility Officer said, that it:
would. depeiid.on “how long thée-relationship was and ‘how: compromised the individual felt’he-might appear to be,”
but-he would haveexpected/Menchel to raise'the:issue with. Acosta. The:Professional' Responsibility Officer'told OPR
thatvit.he.had been ‘approached for advice! atithe time, he*would have asked tor:more facts, but “[g]iven'the sensitivity

over.” Menchel told ORR that if his relationship with Sanchez-had tumed. into, something ‘more ‘than a handful of
dates. he-would haye advised ‘his : Supervisors. Although: ‘OPR.docs not conclude’Menchel?s prior relationship» with,
