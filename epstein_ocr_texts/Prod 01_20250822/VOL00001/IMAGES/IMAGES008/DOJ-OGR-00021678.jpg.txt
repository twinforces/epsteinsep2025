United States v. Fla. W. Int'l Airways, Inc., 853 F.
Supp. 2d 1209, 1228 (S.D. Fla. 2012) (third party must
show that “a direct and primary object of the contract-
ing parties was to confer a benefit on the third party”
(quoting Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, 405 F.3d 964,
982 (11th Cir. 2005))). Here, Maxwell has failed to
make the requisite showing: she is not named in the

ties to the NPA intended to confer a benefit on her spe-

NPA.

2. The NPA’s Terms Bind Only the USAO-

SDFL

Even if Maxwell had a right to invoke the NPA’s
protections, it would not bar the charges in this case.
By its terms, the NPA only applies to prosecutions
brought by the USAO-SDFL. The agreement was
signed “on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta,
United States Attorney for the Southern District of
Florida.” (A.175). And in exchange for Epstein’s plea in
state court, the USAO-SDFL agreed to defer “prosecu-
tion in this District’—that is, the Southern District of
Florida. (A.175). The USAO-SDFL further promised
that no prosecution by “the Federal Bureau of Investi-
gation and the U.S. Attorney’s Office ... will be insti-
tuted in this District.” (A.175). An agreement by the
USAO-SDFL not to prosecute Epstein in the Southern
District of Florida is an agreement intended to apply
only to the USAO-SDFL and only in the Southern Dis-
trict of Florida. Moreover, the agreement was signed
