strongly. objected, to: the: government’s plan. to: notify victims; of the state preceedings, which ‘he:
described. as “highly inappropriate” and an. “intrusion into state affairs, when ‘the identified
‘individuals are ‘not even victims of-the crime for which:Mr. Epstein i is being sentenced.”

Thereafter—at a time: when the USAO believed Epstein’s plea to: be ‘imminent—Villafana.
drafted, and Sloman signed, the December 6, 2007 letter to Lefkowitz: rejecting the: defense:
‘at guinents regarding notification and. reiterating the USAO’s position, that'the'victims' identified, i in,
the:federal.investigation be invited'to appear, at the state plea hearing. The‘letter took an.expansive
view of the applicable: statutes’ by’ contending that both ‘the CVRA. and ‘the VRRA. required. the
USAO to notify the victims.of the state proceedings:

[T]hese ‘sections ‘are: not limited. to. proceedings in a federal district.
court, Our Non-Prosecution. Agreement, resolves ‘the: federal
investigation by allowing Mr. Epstein to: plead toa state offense.
The: victims identified through the: federal, investigation should ‘be
appropriately informed, and our Non-Prosecution Agreement does
not require the U.S. Attorney’s Office ‘to forego [sic] its legal
obligations. *!¢

The letter also asserted:that the VRRA obligated the USAO to, provide the Victiins with
information: ‘concerning restitution.to which they may be entitled-and.“the-eurliest possible” notice:
ofthe status. of the investigation, the filing of’ charges, and the acceptance ofa plea. Along with
the: letter, Sloman forwarded a revised draft. victim ‘notification letter to Lefkowitz for his
comments. This draft: victim. notification letter stated that. the federal investigation had. been
completed, Epstein would plead guilty in, state court, the partics’ would.recommend, 18 months of
‘imprisonment.at sentencing, and Epstein. would compensate victims for monetary damages claims
brought. under 18 USS.C. § 2255. The draftvictim notification letter provided specific information,
concerning the upcoming, change. of plea hearing, and ‘invited the victims to attend or provide a
Written Statement tothe State: Attorney’ § Office.. When Lefkowitz asked Sloman to. delay: sending’
victim notifications until.after.a‘discussion:of their contents, Sioman instructed Villafafia, who was
preparing letters for transinittal to: 30 ‘victiiis; to “Hold. the letter.” During his, OPR. interview,
Sloman recalled.that-he had.““wanted to: push the letter’out,” but-he “must-have:-had a conversation
With. somebody” about whether the CVRA applied, and based on that coriversation he directed.

In. his response: letter ‘to Acosta, Lefkowitz contended that the governnient. had
misinterpreted both the GVRA and VRRA. because neither applied to the: “public proceeding i in
this matter [which] will be in state. court for the purpose. of the entry of.a-plea on.state charges.”

a6 Sloman told Letkowitz the CSAO: did not seek to “federalize” a state plea, but, “is: simply-informing the
widtims oftheir rights.” Sloman.also-addressed the defense attorieys’ objection t6-ad visine’ the-victims:that they:cotld
contact Villataiia or the FBI; case agent: with questions orconcems by referencing the @VRA, noting; “Again; federal,
Jawtequites that victims have. the. ‘reasonable-rightlo:conterwith.the-attorney for the: Government:in:this:case.”
