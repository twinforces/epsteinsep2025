[O]ne of the issues ‘in. the: case;-was the. . .. defense’s: ability to
describe: the case or charactetize. the case as’ being legally complex.
It was not as legally: complex as: they: made it out to be. But because
they were able. to cofvince members of our office ‘that it was
somehow extremely. novel and legally complex, the: issue became
who: was likely to succeed in arguing these legal issues. And.
because: of that, the ‘legal prowess, if you. will, of the attorneys [' ]
[became] something to consider. /

I think that the ability of Alan Dershowitz and Ken. Starr and Jay
Lefkowitz to convinee Alex Acosta that] didn’t know. what I was
talking. [about] also, all came into play. So I think: there were:a
fiuimber of factors aid ittall came together.

Although Villafatia was critical. of Acosta’s consideration. of the defense arguments, ‘she:
conceded that the: defense ‘team’s tactics demonstrated effective advocacy. Certainly, throughout
the: case, Epstein’ 's attorneys ° ‘prepared lengthy memoranda analyzing the evidence and arguing,
nuanced. legal points concerning federalism, the elements of numerous ‘federal, criminal statutes,
and the evidence relevant to those statutes, but itis not:unusual.or unreasonabile for prosecutors: to
carefully considerwell-crafted legal arguments froin défense counsel.

There is little question that Epstein’s extensive team. of attorneys was able to obtain.
negotiated. benefits for Epstein—although the USAO: never wavered, from. its three core
requirements,.it did.agree to areduction.inprison.time:from:its original offer, and it granted Epstein.
certain other concessions duting the ‘negotiations. Epstein’s wealth. provided him with skilled,
experienced negotiators who continually sought various incremental concessions, and with.
attoreys ‘who: knew how to obtain. Depattmient révitw of a USAO imatter;. thereby delaying’
undesired.outcomes:foras long. as possible.” 228 Despite Epstein? s evident.intentions, however, OPR.
did notifind evidence warranting a conclusion-that'the NPA or its terns fesulted ‘fromthe subjécts?

relationships‘with the: attorneys: he:had selected to: represent him.

2. The Subjects Assérted That Their Relationships with Defense Counsel.
‘Did Not Influence Their Actions:

Acosta, Menchel, Sloman, and. Lourie. cach. asserted that Epstein’s choice: of counsel did.
not affect his handling: of ‘the case. Menchel told OPR that once in ‘private practice, former
colleagues often became adversaries. In.Menchel’s view, such preexisting relationships were
useful because they afforded. a defense: attorney initial credibility and an insight ‘into the ‘issues a.
prosecutor would. likely view as areas of concern, which, enabled the defense attorney to. “tailor”
arguments In.a way that would maximize ‘their persuasive impact. on. the USAO. Menchel. told
OPR, however : that, these advantages did, not “move ‘the needle in any major way,” and. he
“rejectied] the notion” that anyone in the USAO ‘had been.“swayed” because: of: preexisting

ery

As Chief Reiter, later observed in, his deposition.testimony, “[T]he. Epstein-case was. am instance: of a,many:
million-dollar’ defense and whatiit can accomplish.”
