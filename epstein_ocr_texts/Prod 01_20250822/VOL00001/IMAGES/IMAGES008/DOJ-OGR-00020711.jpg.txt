docket. The Government subsequently submitted one court exhibit with the name
unredacted of a witness subject to the Court's anonymity order. Subsequently the Defense
indicated in a temporarily sealed letter why the name was unredacted. The Government is
accordingly ORDERED to docket a letter on ECF on or before January 28, 2022,
indicating why a redaction is no longer being sought for the name of this witness. Once
the Government confirms in that letter that it no longer seeks redaction of the name, then
the Defense may file the temporarily sealed letter on the docket without redaction of the
name. The Court will then docket all Court Exhibits. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan

01/26/2022 585 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a
new trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt. No.
580. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the motion.
The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this matter and will ensure that
the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the same time, the
Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering these sealing issues
in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process going forward, should one
be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant's and the Government's,
interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing
should themselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can
be made in such a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or
redaction in the first instance. The Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a letter on the
public docket on or before February 1, 2022, that justifies the proposed sealing by
reference to the three-part test in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d
Cir. 2006). The Government may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification
letter on or before February 4, 2022. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new
trial motion is due February 2, 2022. Dkt. No. 571. Per the established practice in this
case, the Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allow the Defense
the opportunity to propose narrowly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party
proposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a letter
justifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense
letter must be filed on or before February 8, 2022, and the Government letter must be
filed by February 11, 2022. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in support,
which is due February 9, 2022. Dkt. No. 571. If redactions or sealing are proposed, the
Defense letter justifying such requests would be due February 15, 2022, and the
Government letter would be due February 18, 2022. The parties are FURTHER
ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal the filled-out
questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583. Letters by both parties must
be submitted via ECF on or before February 11, 2022. SO ORDERED (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 1/26/2022)(w) (Entered: 01/26/2022)
