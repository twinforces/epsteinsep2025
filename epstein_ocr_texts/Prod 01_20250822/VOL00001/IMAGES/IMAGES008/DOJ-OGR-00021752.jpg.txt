Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page10 of 35

See U.S. v. Stolt-Nielsen, 524 F.Supp.2d 609, 613-14, 620-23, 628 (E.D. Pa. 2007)
(dismissing indictment against Stolt-Nielsen’s “directors and/or officers,” as they
were “intended third-party beneficiaries of the [Conditional Leniency] Agreement”
between the DOJ Antitrust Division and Stolt-Nielsen); U.S. v. Florida West Int’l
Airways, Inc., 853 F.Supp.2d 1209, 1228-32 (S.D. Fla. 2012) (dismissing indictment
against employee of air cargo provider, as he had “third party beneficiary standing
necessary to establish [his] immunity under the Plea Agreement” between the
Government and his employer); U.S. v. El-Sadig, 133 F.Supp.2d 600 (N.D. Ohio
2001) (“[E]ven if the non-prosecution agreement was never directly communicated
to Defendant El-Sadig, he can enforce the non-prosecution agreement as a third party
beneficiary”); U.S. v. CFW Const. Co., Imce., 583 F.Supp. 197 (D.S.C. 1984) (“[A]n
intended third party beneficiary of a contract may enforce its provisions....Thus, if
the Government, in negotiating the aforementioned plea agreements, ‘promised’ that
there would be no prosecution against CFW...the promise must be enforced.”).

This rule makes sense. “Plea agreements are interpreted in accordance with
contract law principles,” U.S. v. Colon, 220 F.3d 48, 51 (2d Cir. 2002) (citing U.S.
v. Altrom 180 F.3d 372, 275 (2d Cir. 1999)), and it is hornbook contract law that an
intended third-party beneficiary may enforce a contract. See Subaru Distribs. Corp.
v. Subaru of Am., Inc., 425 F.3d 119, 124 (2d Cir. 2005); Bochese v. Town of Ponce
Inlet, 405 F.3d 964, 982 (11th Cir. 2005). There is no reason to treat plea or non-
