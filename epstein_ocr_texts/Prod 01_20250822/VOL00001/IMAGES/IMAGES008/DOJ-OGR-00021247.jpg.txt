C. July 2007: The Defense:Continues Its.Efforts to Stop the Federal Investigation.

defense counsel also. sent letters to the USAO, dated July. 6,, 2007, and J uly 25, 2007, reiterating,
their objections toa federal, investigation of Epstein. The July 25,2007 letter included. a lengthy
“case analysis chart” purporting to support the: defense argument that.Epstein had ‘committed no

Principal Deputy. Chief of CEOS, reporting that:she.““supports our position without.reservation that.
this is nota matter upon which:the federal statu[t]es: should be brought to bear.*”>

expressed its endorsement of Villafana’s. legal analysis and proposed charges. OnJuly 18, 2007,
CEOS Chicf Oosterbaan emailed. Sloman, Menchel, and. Lourie, stating that. he had. ‘read.

to ‘consider. some.of the arguments ‘closely. Nevertheless, while the
law applicable ‘here is not always crystal clear, the balanée, of
available precedent favors us.. From.the prosecution memorandum
‘it is clear that: Maric: has anticipated the strongest legal. arguments,
‘scrutinized the:applicable law, and has charged'the case accordingly.
And, while with this prosecution the government clearly faces a.
strong and. determined defense team, it: is a challenge well worth
facing. T:also happen.to know that'there is absolutely no:concern .
about: facing the challenges this case-presents:

Th. closing, Oostérbaan-renewed his, offer to have CEOS “help. you with this prosecution,” and:to:
send “whatever. and:whoever’ you.need” to assist.

a Villafatia,forwarded Black's letter ‘to.Menchel,. explaining the circumstances, relating to the, remoyal of the:
