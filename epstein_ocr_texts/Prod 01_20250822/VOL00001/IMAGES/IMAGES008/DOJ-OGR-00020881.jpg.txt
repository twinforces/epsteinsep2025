4 victim of’ sexual abuse or a‘telative orfriend ofa’
‘victim was asked in the'50-question questionnaire

He said that:they did’not take.ar initial Vote of opinions
but-instead, on:the first-day they: were-sent out:simply
chose a foreperson and began by reading the
instructions page by page.

He'said, ‘itwas overwhelming. | mean 80 pages of how
‘you interpret the law-on-each-count, and it flips back

‘20 pages in order to.get.a definition of something else
that'can apply to one specific:count.’
