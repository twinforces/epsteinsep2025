far-reaching nature, including documents related to a revenge issue as to Valerie Plame, and her |
late husband, Ambassador Wilson. The Court in Libby ruled in favor for the defense and granted
the motion to compel discavery in several key areas of the case. ,
This Court will find Libby, supra, important because the Court’s decision in that case
focused on “all agencies” that have information regarding the offenses charged. In the instant ,
| matter, therefore, it will not be enough for the government to state that other agencies may not be
allied with the prosecution, or that the government lacks access to the documents. If the
| documents provide exculpatory evidence, and are related to the issues in the indictment, they
must be produced.
In Marshall, 132 F.3d at 63, the defendant was charged in a drug related transaction.
There were records on visitation from the local jail where the defendant was incarcerated, pager
records, the pager, and local records from the county public records about a traffic stop. These
items were uncovered by the government agents investigating the matter, but only after
discovery had been concluded. During the course of the trial, the Court took a four-day
adjournment, in order to address the newly discovered evidence. The trial judge decided to
exclude all of the newly discovered evidence, and, as a result, Marshall was found guilty. On
appeal, the government argued that, in fact, the newly discovered evidence, under Rule 16,
tended to incriminate, not exculpate Marshall. On appeal, the Court disagreed, citing Rule
16(a)(1)(C} as requiring the production of items that are material to the preparation of the
defendant’s case. The Court, in addition, rejected the government’s argument, that the items
must be ‘materially exculpatory,’ Jd. at 68. In announcing the rule, that Court stated: “In United
States v. Lloyd, we said that evidence is material under Rule 16 ‘as long as there is a strong
indication that it will play an important role in uncovering admissible evidence, aiding witness
preparation, corroborating testimony, or assisting impeachment or rebuttal.” See Lloyd at 351.
