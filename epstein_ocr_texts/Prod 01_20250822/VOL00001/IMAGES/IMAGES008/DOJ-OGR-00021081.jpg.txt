Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page34 of 113

Papa, 533 F.2d 815 (2d Cir. 1976)). But, as Gebbie explained, Annabi misread
this Court’s precedent and fashioned an “illogical” rule out of whole cloth:

The first case cited in Annabi is Abbamonte, but Abbamonte merely

relies upon the other two cases cited in Annabi—Alessi and Papa ...

The court in Alessi relies upon Papa, which is a related case. ...

Papa, however, provides no support for the rule the Second

Circuit follows. ... Although Papa held that the plea agreement did

not bind other districts because the evidence revealed an intent to bind

only one district, the Second Circuit apparently has broadly

interpreted this case as meaning that plea agreements do not bind

other districts absent an affirmative appearance of doing

so. Papa does not explain or attempt to rationalize the rule that has

evolved.

have been unaware of the promise. As Santobello explained, “[t]he staff lawyers
in a prosecutor’s office have the burden of ‘letting the left hand know what the
right hand is doing’ or has done.” 404 U.S. at 262. And in Giglio v. United States,
the Supreme Court held that an Assistant United Stated Attorney (“AUSA”) had a
duty under Brady to disclose a promise of immunity that another AUSA had made
to a testifying witness, even though the first AUSA had been falsely assured that
