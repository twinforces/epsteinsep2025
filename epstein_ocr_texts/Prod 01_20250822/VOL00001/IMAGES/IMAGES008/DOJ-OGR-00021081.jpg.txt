Papa, 533 F.2d 815. (2d Cir. 1976)). But, a3 Gebbie explained, Annabi misread.
this Court’s precedent and fashioned an “illogical” rule: out of whole cloth:

The first case cited in Annabi is Abbamonie, but.Abbamonic merely
relies upon the other 'two cases cited in Annabi—Alessi and Papa ...

The court in Alessi:relies upon Papa, which is.a related case. ...
Papa, however, provides no support for the rule the Second

Annabi. stands. in tension. with what the ‘United States Supreme Court has written
about plea and immunity agreements. In Santohello, 404 U.S. 257 (1971)=the
seminal case: on plea bargaining—the Supreme Court held that one prosecutor’s
promise in a'plea agreement would bind other prosecutors, even those who might

in. a prosecutor’s office have the burden. of ‘letting the left hand know what’ the
right hand is doing” or has.done.” 404 U.S. at262.. And in Giglio v. United States,
the Supreme Court held that an, Assistant United. Stated Attorney (“AUSA”) had a

duty under Brady to disclose:a promise of immunity that another AUSA had. made

to a testifying witness, even. though the first AUSA had been falsely assured that.
