its investigation of Epstein, as well its contact with witnesses in New York, reflect
a coordinated effort that transcended the USAO-SDFL (Dkt 142, Exh. A at 46, 48,

and the final agreement was not so restricted as to the co-conspirators. Dkt 142,

The OPR demonstrates the trans-district scope of the investigation and the

negotiations.
