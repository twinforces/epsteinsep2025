Case 22-1426, Document 30, 07/28/2022, 3356263, Page2 of 2
matter of hours before my scheduled visit to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.
Meeting with my client is a critical precondition to my work on this case. Fifth, I have other matters
that I must work on as well, as Ms. Maxwell is not my only client.
For these reasons, I respectfully request that the Court permit me to file Appellantâ€™s Brief
on January 30, 2023.
Sincerely,
