After a thorough investigation, FBI investigators concluded that Jeffrey Epstein committed
suicide in his cell at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City on August 10, 2019.
This conclusion is consistent with previous findings, including the August 19, 2019 autopsy
findings of the New York City Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, the November 2019 position
of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York in connection with the
investigation of federal correctional officers responsible for guarding Epstein, and the June 2023
conclusions of DOJ’s Office of the Inspector General.

The conclusion that Epstein died by suicide is further supported by video footage from the
common area of the Special Housing Unit (SHU) where Epstein was housed at the time of his
death. As DOJ’s Inspector General explained in 2023, anyone entering or attempting to enter the
tier where Epstein’s cell was located from the SHU common area would have been captured by
this footage. The FBI’s independent review of this footage confirmed that from the time Epstein
was locked in his cell at around 10:40 pm on August 9, 2019, until around 6:30 am the next
morning, nobody entered any of the tiers in the SHU.

During this review, the FBI enhanced the relevant footage by increasing its contrast,
balancing the color, and improving its sharpness for greater clarity and viewability. The full raw
