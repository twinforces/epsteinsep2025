5 you think he was -- he did not die by suicide, given
6 all the things we just talked about.
7 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I do not believe he
8 died by suicide, no.
9 TODD BLANCHE: And do you believe that --
10 do you have any speculation or view of who killed
11 him?
12 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: IT -- no, I don't.
13 TODD BLANCHE: And I ask that because, if
14 you don't believe that there's any truth to the
15 allegations of blackmail or that he had kind of a
16 list, or that he had reasons to have people hate him,
17 why would somebody kill him in prison?
18 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: In prison, where I am,
19 they will kill you or they will pay -- somebody can
20 pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of
21 commissary. That's about the going rate for a hit
22 with a lock today.
23 TODD BLANCHE: So that goes to the third
24 reason, which is kind of the mismanagement.
25 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Yes.
