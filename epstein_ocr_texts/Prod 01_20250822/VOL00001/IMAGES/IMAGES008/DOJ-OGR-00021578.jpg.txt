clearer, your Honor; this notion that she was somehow == Sarah
Kellen was an assistant of beth Epstein anda Maxwell is again
belied, by the trial recora.

If you look at Larry Visoski"s. testimony, which J
believe is what the government 1s relying on there; he
originally testified, oh, I think she was an assistant ‘for
both. But. on Cross-exaintination, he conceded that. he really
aton't know ‘what her role was, and his best recollection was
that she was an assistant for Epstein.

Ano again, just look again at Cimberly Espinosa's
testimony who was. the actual assistant for Ms. Maxwell, and she
says unequivocally; "I was her assistant. Kellen was Epstein's

assistant." So there is no fair inference that Ms. Maxwell was

supérvising Sarah Kellen. The inference is exaétly the
opposite; and it can't provioce a basis for that leadership
enhancement .

THE COURT? All right. Anything further on ‘the
enhancements, for the government's objection?

MS. MOB: Your Honor, just very briefly with respect
to the leaoership question, I just want to oirect. the Court's
attention, we noted this on pagé 27 of Sur brief, but the
testimony at. trial was that. Carolyn recalleoa that. ‘even after

Sarah Kellen took over calling to scheaule massages, Maxwell

was still present insioé the Palm Béach resiaéneé when Carolyn

arrivea for massage: appointments.
