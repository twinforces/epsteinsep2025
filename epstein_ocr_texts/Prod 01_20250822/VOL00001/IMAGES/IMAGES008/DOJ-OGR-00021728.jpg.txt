Four alleged that Maxwell knowingly transported
Jane “with the intent that Jane engage in sexual ac-
tivity for which any person can be charged with a crim-
inal offense in violation of New York law.” (Tr.3037;
see Tr.3035 (second element of Count Four requires
proof of an intent to violate “New York law as alleged

in the transportation of Jane’s return
flight, but not the flight to New Mexico
where/if the intent was for Jane to en-

conclusion of which Judge Nathan determined she

second element of Count Four because the jury note
was otherwise “too difficult to parse factually and le-
gally.” (Tr.3126-40).

That night, Maxwell filed a letter seeking reconsid-
eration of Judge Nathan’s response and raising the
possibility of a constructive amendment or prejudicial
variance because, in her view, the note showed that
