04/23/2021 241 | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on 240 LETTER by USA as to
Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene Comey,
Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated April 23, 2021 re: Proposed
Redactions. ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants the Government's redaction requests. Its
conclusion is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must:
(1) determine whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (11) assess the
weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (111) balance
competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. The Court
concludes that these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common
law presumptions of access attach. But in balancing competing considerations against the
presumption of access, the Court finds that the specific arguments the Government has
put forward in this letter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third
parties referenced in the documents, favor the narrowly tailored redactions. See United
States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995). The Defendant and Boies Schiller
are hereby ORDERED to docket the respective documents with the Government's
