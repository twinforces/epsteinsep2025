3. The ‘NPA Did Not Violate Department Policy Relating to ‘Deportation
of Criminal Aliens’

During the negotiations, the USAO rejected a ‘defense-offered, provision prohibiting. the:
USAO from “request[ing], initiat[ing]. or in any way cncourag[ing] Immigration authorities to
institute immigration proceedings” against.two female assistants. However, OPR. considered.
whether the April 28, 1995 memorandum imposed: any obligation, on, the USAO: ‘to prosecute
Epstein’s two :female assistants, who were known ‘to be: foreign nationals—as; Villafafia. urged in.
her:prosecution imemorandum—and thus trigger their removal, or conversely, whether it precluded
the USAO. fron: agreeing, not to prosecute: them as: part of a negotiated. resolution. OPR. found.
nothing in the policy’ that created. a, cleat and unambiguous standard :in.cither regard.

The Attorney, General’s April.28, 1995 memorandum regarding “Deportation of Criminal
Aliens” directed federal prosecutors ‘to become involved actively and directly i in, the: process ‘of
removing: criminal,aliens from.the United States, and, along with USAM § 9-73.520, _ provided.that.

“Talll deportable criminal aliens should be deported unless extraordinary. circumstances exist:”
However, Epstcin’s two assistants'were not“deportable”-unless and-until-convicted of'a.crime:that:
would haye ttiggered'their‘removal. But neither the policy memorandum nor the USAM. imposed
an obligation. on the USAO to prosecute or secure a.conviction against a foreign. national. nor did
either provision preclude the USAO from declining to, prosecute an lich using ‘the same. broad
discretion that otherwise: applies to char ging decisions.

The: ‘policy. guidance also requires “prompt. and close coordination” with immigration
officials in cases involving alien defendants and specifies that prosecutors must notify immigration
authorities before engaging ‘in. plea negotiations with alicn defendants. OPR learned during its
‘investigation that. an. ICE: agent: participated :in ‘the Epstein ‘investigation in its early stages.
Moreover, because the USAO never engaged.in plea. negotiations withthe two female assistants,
who, in any event, had snot ‘been ‘charged and were therefore not “defendants,” no further
notification was requited.

INFLUENCED BY IMPROPER MOTIVES TO INCLUDE. IN ‘THE. NPA TERMS

OPR investigated: whether any’ of the stbjécts—Acosta, Sloman, Menchel, Lotrie, or
Villafaria—was influenced. by corruption, bias, or other improper:motive, suchias. Epstein’ s wealth,
statlis, Of political associations, to inclide terms in the NPA that. were favorable, to Epstein, or:
whether such. motives otherwise: affected. the outcome of the federal, investigation. OPR
considered the: case-specific reasons ‘the subjects identified. as the: motivation for the, USAO’s
July 31,2007 “term sheet” and Acosta’s approval of the NPA. ‘in, September 2007. OPR also
thoroughly examined various :factors forming the: basis for allegations; that ‘the subjects were
motivated ‘by i improper’ influences, including ‘the subjects’ preexisting relationships with, defense
counsel; the subjects* numerous mectings with Epstein’s, team of nationally. known. attorneys:
emails between the subjects—particularly Villafaha—and defense counsel that; appeared. friendly,
casual, and.deferential to defense counsel; :and inclusion in.the NPA.of.a broad. provision declining.
