1 will feel all of us standing behind her. Thank you.

2 THE COURT: Thank you.

3 I will hear the statement from counsel for Virginia

4 Roberts.

5 VIRGINIA ROBERTS COUNSEL: Good afternoon, your Honor.
6 May it please the Court, this statement I am reading

7 on behalf of my client, Virginia Giuffre, is written to

8 Ghislaine Maxwell.

g Ghislaine: 22 years ago in the summer of 2000, you

10 spotted me at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, and you made a choice:

11 You chose to follow me and procure me for Epstein. Just hours
12 later, you and he abused me together for the first time.

LS Together you damaged me physically, mentally, sexually and

14 emotionally. Together you did unthinkable things that still

15 have a corrosive impact on me to this day.

16 I want to be clear about one thing: Without question,
17 Jeffrey Epstein was a terrible pedophile, but I never would

18 have met Jeffrey Epstein if not for you. For me, and for so

19 many others, you opened the door to hell, and then, Ghislaine,
20 like a wolf in sheep's clothing, you used your femininity to
a1 betray us and you led us all through it. When you did that,
22 you changed the course of our lives forever. You joked that
23 you were like a new mother to us. As a woman, I think you
24 understood the damage that you were causing, the price you were
25 making us victims pay. You could have put an end to the rapes,
