(Entered: 10/27/2021)

10/27/2021 | 376 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is receipt of the parties' letters regarding
the jury questionnaire and voir dire. See Dkt. Nos. 372, 373, 375. The Court will
provide counsel the corresponding list of juror names and assigned juror numbers on
November 16 at the commencement of voir dire. The placeholder for the juror
information sheet in the Courts draft questionnaire refers to the information sheet
required by the Jury Department. See Dkt. No. 365. The information sheet will be
removed and collected by the Jury Department from the packet before the parties
review of the questionnaires. The Court is still considering the logistics of when
peremptory strikes will be exercised, but the Court anticipates peremptory strikes will
be exercised on November 29. Assuming so, the swearing in of the jury, preliminary
instructions, and opening statements would commence immediately following the
simultaneous (via submission of lists) exercise of peremptory challenges. (Signed by
