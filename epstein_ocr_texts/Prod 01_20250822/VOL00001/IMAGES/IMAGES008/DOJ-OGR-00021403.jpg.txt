various iterations of the victims’ rights legislation.”**> 'Villafata explained:to OPR her reference’
to the victiins:

[M]y concern. was that. [Menchel] was violating the CVRA, which
requires the attorneys, for'the government, which[] includes me[,] to
confer with the victims, and.the. [VRRA], which requires the-agents
to keep the victims apprised, of what’s happening with ‘the case. So
in essence, I felt like-he was:exposing both myselfand the: agents to
allegations of not abiding by our obligations” ‘by engaging in these
plea negotiations without.letting us.know about it.**°

In. his ‘reply to Willafana’s email, ‘and after noting that he: found her. email. “totally
inappropriate,” Menchel. denied. that, he had violated any Departmental policy; and. he noted that:
“[a]s Chief of the: Criminal Division, | am_the person, designated. by the U.S. Attorney to exercise
appropriate: diseretion in. deciding: whether certain. pleas are appropriate and consistent. with”
Departmental ‘policy. Perceiving Menchel’s rebuke as a criticism of her judgment, Villafana,
responded, “[R]aising concerns about the: forgotten ‘voices: of victims :in this case ‘should not ‘be:
classified as alapse in judgment” and that her “first and only concern in'this case... {is the victims.”

Menchel told OPR thatihe did not view: his, conversation, with, Sanchez asa plea offer,
asserted that he: was. ‘not. obligated to consult with ‘victims during preliminary settlement.
negotiations, and noted ‘that. he: left. the USAO before: the NPA ‘was ‘fully negotiated, or signed.
Menchel.told OPR, that “you. have discussions . . . with, [the] defense: all the: time, and the notion
that even.just having a general discussion is:something;that:must be vetted with victims . . .:is not:
even... «in the same universe as to how I think about this.” Menchel, also observed ‘that: on, the
very day that Villafaiia. criticized him for engaging in settlement negotiations without :consulting
her, the FBI, or the victims, Villafana-had herself sent an, email to Sanchez offering “to discuss the
possibility: of.a federal. resolution of Mr. Epstein’ s case that could run concurrently with any state:
resolution,” without having spoken,to the'victiins about her-proposal.?*”

BSS Villafafia ‘told -OPR that. “some victims, I felt strongly, would-have objected to’ [a State-only:disposition].”
Villafafia stated.to OPR;that-at:the time Menchel., engaged in, such negotiations, he would.only-haye been aware:of-the:
victim:information.contained in her prosecution: memorandum, which-included information‘about:the “effects on.the
victims? but did not: ‘likely: contain information as to “how: they would'like the case resolved2? Villafafia asserted that;
Menehel “never reached out:to: any of the'victims to ‘find out:what their; ‘position. would be.” Menchel told-ORR that:
the allegations in‘Villatana’y email thatthe violated the-Ashcroft Meme, USAM. aiid the CVRAW vay Oiit Of line:
in.terms of whatthe:law-is and the'policies are.”

ant As discussed,, the Department's positiom at'the time was ‘that the ©CVRA did not apply betore charges were
