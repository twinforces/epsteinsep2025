(ce) If the offender is convicted, the sentence and conditions of supervised
release, if any, that are imposed.

[previously identified].

c. Consultation With a Government Attorney

(1) In General. A victim has the reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the
Government in the case. The victim’s right to confer, however, shall not be
construed to impair prosecutorial discretion. Federal prosecutors should be
available to consult with victims about major case decisions, such as dismissals,
release of the accused pending judicial proceedings (when such release is for
noninvestigative purposes), plea negotiations, and pretrial diversion. Because
victims are not clients, may become adverse to the Government, and may disclose
whatever they have learned from consulting with prosecutors, such consultations
may be limited to gathering information from victims and conveying only
nonsensitive data and public information. Consultations should comply with the
prosecutor’s obligations under applicable rules of professional conduct.
Representatives of the Department should take care to inform victims that neither
the Department’s advocacy for victims nor any other effort that the Department
may make on their behalf constitutes or creates an attorney-client relationship
between such victims and the lawyers for the Government.
Department personnel should not provide legal advice to victims.
(2) Prosecutor Availability. Prosecutors should be reasonably available to consult
with victims regarding significant adversities they may suffer as a result of delays
in the prosecution of the case and should, at the appropriate time, inform the court
of the reasonable concerns that have been conveyed to the prosecutor.
(3) Proposed Plea Agreements. Responsible officials should make reasonable
efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’ views about,
prospective plea negotiations. In determining what is reasonable, the responsible
official should consider factors relevant to the wisdom and practicality of giving
notice and considering views in the context of the particular case, including, but not
limited to, the following factors:

(a) The impact on public safety and risks to personal safety.

(b) The number of victims.

(c) Whether time is of the essence in negotiating or entering a proposed plea.
