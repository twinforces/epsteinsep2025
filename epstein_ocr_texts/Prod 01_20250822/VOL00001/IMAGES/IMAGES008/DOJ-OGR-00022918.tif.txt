9 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Well, I believe -- I 9 to that. I don't.
10 ~— don't have full recollection. I'm not even sure I 10 TODD BLANCHE: So let me ask this maybe a
11 ever saw what they accused me of, but my belief is 11 different way that gets to the issue, right? So the
12 that that money also contained money that was for a 12 accusation by the government, based upon the evidence
13 helicopter, for instance, that I never owned and I -- 13 they collected, is that Epstein paid you millions and
14 was never mine. And -- 14 millions of dollars over the years.
15 DAVID MARKUS: In other words, money was = 15 And the reason why he paid you that is
16 — sent to you that you then used to purchase things 16 because you were performing an extraordinary service
17 or... 17 for him by recruiting young women, many of whom were
18 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Well, I'm not even 18 underage to -- so that he could sexually abuse them.
12 — sure that I purchased it. So the accounts -- those 19 Okay. That's their -- that's their allegation.
20 accounts would be controlled by his accountants. 20 Okay.
21 ~=And -- 21 From what you said yesterday and from what
22 TODD BLANCHE: Even accounts in yourname, 22 I've reviewed about you and Mr. Epstein, he paid for
23 you're saying, or one of your entities? 23 a lot in your life.
24 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Well, I'm not even 24 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Absolutely.

3 entity, let's say account X, if I really set that up 3 so he took care of you for many years.
4 myself or whether they said, we're doing this and the 4 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: That is true.
5 money's coming or whatever. But in no substantive 5 TODD BLANCHE: On top of that, he actually
6 way --I can't think of the right word. 6 paid you a salary as we talked about $25,000 to
7 DAVID MARKUS: Did you have control 7 $250,000. What else did he give you? Or what
8 over -- 8 purchase -- like, was there a time when he gave you a
9 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I had no control, is 9 million dollars or $500,000 as a bonus? Or what --
10  ~what I'm saying. 10 what financial benefit did you receive from him,
