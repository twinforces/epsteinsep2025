preparing, a “short” charging document.“*with only ‘clean? victims ‘that they. have not dirtied up
already: 30 The fact that Lourie. apparently used information gleaned from the deferise about the
victims’ credibility to. formulate: his char ging recommendation: supported ‘his: statements to: OPR.
that such meetings were, in his experience, a useful source of information that could be factored.
into the governments. char ging strategy.

The two February. 2007 Villafana/Louric- level, meetings focused on witness issues and
claims | of misconduct bys state: investigators, but in 1 Tate May 2002, defense: attorneys: requested
presentation concerning iczal deficiencies ‘ina a potential federal prosecution. The request was
granted after Lourie recommended to Menchel and Slonian that “[i]t would probably be helpful to
us:...... to hear their legal arguments :in.case we have missed something.” The requested mecting,
took place on June 26, 2007. Before the meeting, at. Menchel’s direction, Villafaiia, provided. to
the: defense a list of statutes’ the USAO was considering. as’ the basis for federal.charges. Defense
counsel ‘used that information, to prepare a.19-page letter, submitted to the, USAO the day before
the: June 26 mecting, as “an overview” of the defense position. In.an email to his colleagues,
Lourie: evaluated the ‘defense submission, noting, its weaker and stronger arguments. A.
contemporancous email indicates that Menchel, Lourie, and Villafana-viewed the meeting itself'as
primarily a “listening. session.”**! After. the mecting, Epstcin’s: team submitted.a second lengthy
letterte the USAO detailing Epstein’s “federalism” arguments that the USAO should let the state
handle the matter.

‘Menchel apparently scheduled the next-mecting with.defense counsel, ‘on. July. 3.1,,.2007,,to
facilitate-the USAO’s.presentation to the defense teain.of the “term sheet” describing thé proposed.
terms of'a-non-prosecution agreement.

By carly August, after the Kirkland & Ellis attorneys—Starr and. Lefkowitz—joined, the
defense team, Acosta believed they: would likely * ‘go to DC-on: the case, on the: grounds... . that I:
have -not inet with then.’ A mecting with.'the defense team was eventually scheduled ‘for
September 7, 2007, when Acosta, Sloman, Villafaiia, and Oosterbaan met with Starr, Lefkowitz,
aid Sanchez. In an einail to Sloman, Acosta explained that he intended to meet-with the defense,
with Oosterbaan participating, “to discuss’ gencral legal "policy only.” In another email. to Slonvan.
and Lourie, Acosta éxplained, “This will end. up [in-the Department] aiyhow; if We. don’t meet!
with. them. I’d.rather keep it here. Bringing [the CEOS Chief] in visibly does so. If our deadline
has to slip a bit to do:that; it’s worth it.” Acosta told-OPR that the meeting “was-not a’negotiation,”
but a.chance: for'the defense to present their ‘federalism, arguments. Acosta said that-he had-already
decided-how. he wanted 'to resolve the-case, and“*[t]he ‘September, meeting. did not alter or shiftour
position.”

BAO Louri¢ also: recommended that ‘the: initial. charging document “should contain. only: the ‘victims: they: have.

nothing on atcall2"
