have no relevance to the charges in this case. These individuals still maintain a significant
privacy interest that must be safeguarded. The exception the Defense seeks is too broad.
and risks undermining the protections of the privacy of witnesses and alleged victims that
is required by law. In contrast, the Government's proffered language would allow Ms.
Maxwell to publicly reference individuals who have spoken by name on the record in this
case. It also allows the Defense to "referenc[e] the identities of individuals they believe
may be relevant... to Potential Defense Witnesses and their counsel during the course of
the investigation and preparation of the defense case at trial." Dkt. No. 33-1, 5. This
proposal adequately balances the interests at stake. And as the Government's letter notes,
see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs an exception to the protective
order for a specific investigative purpose, they can make applications to the Court on a
case-by-case basis. Second, restrictions on the ability of potential witnesses and their
counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing for trial in this case
are unwarranted. The request appears unprecedented despite the fact that there have been
many high-profile criminal matters that had related civil litigation. The Government
labors under many restrictions including Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal
Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other policies of the Department of Justice and
the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, all of which the Court
expects the Government to scrupulously follow. Furthermore, the Government indicates
that it will likely only provide potential witnesses with materials that those witnesses
already have in their possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses
who do testify at trial would be subject to examination on the record as to what materials
were provided or shown to them by the Government. Nothing in the Defense's papers
explains how its unprecedented proposed restriction is somehow necessary to ensure a
fair trial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed
protective order, which will be entered on the docket. This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO
