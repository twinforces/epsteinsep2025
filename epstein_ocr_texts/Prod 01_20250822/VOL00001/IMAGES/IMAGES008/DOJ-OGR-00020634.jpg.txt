proposal adequately balances. the interests at stake.And as the Government's letter.notes,

see Dkt. No. 33 at 4, to the extent that the Defense needs ‘an exception to the protective
order for a specific investigative:purpose, they can:make applications:to the, Court oma

case-by-case: basis. Second, restrictions ‘on the: ability ofpotential. witnesses and their

counsel to use discovery materials for purposes other than preparing | for trial-in, this case

are-unwarranted. The:request appears’ unprecedented despite ‘the: fact‘that there have been

many. high-profile criminal 'matters'that had related. civil litigation. The Government

labors uinder-many’ restrictions including Rule 6(¢) of the: Federal Rules of Grimiial

‘Procedure, the Privacy Act of 1974, and other policies: ofthe. Department of Justice and
‘the U.S, Attorney’ s Office for the Souther District of New York; all of which the Court
‘expects. the Governmenit‘to scrupulously follow: Furthermore, the, Government indicates

that it will likely only‘provide potential witnesses with-materials that those’witnesses

already: have in thei possession. See Dkt. No. 33 at 6. And of course, those witnesses

who-do testify at:trial would be subject'to examination on ‘the:record.as to what:materials
were’ provided or shown to them by the Goyernment.Nothing, in the Defense's‘ papers:
explains how‘its unprecedented.proposed :testriction is’ somehow necessary to ensure. a

‘fairtrial. For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed
protective order, ‘which will be entered, on the docket.:This resolves Dkt. No. 29. SO.
