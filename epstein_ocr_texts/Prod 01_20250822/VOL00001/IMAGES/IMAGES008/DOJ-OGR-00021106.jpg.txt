Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Paged9 of 113
crimes. Under this approach, a court “look[s] to the statute defining the crime of
conviction, rather than to the specific facts underlying the crime.” Kawashima v.
Holder, 565 U.S. 478, 483 (2012); see also U.S. v. Taylor, 142 S.Ct. 2015, 2020
(2022) (the categorical approach asks only what the Government is required “‘to
prove—beyond a reasonable doubt, as an element of its case,” and “precludes...an
inquiry into how any particular defendant may commit the crime’).

Here, applying the categorical approach to § 3283 means holding that this
provision is inapplicable here. That is because “sexual or physical abuse, or
kidnaping, of a child” is not a required element of transporting minors in violation
of § 2423(a), or conspiracy to do the same. 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a). The offense is
accomplished once a person “transports” a minor with the requisite knowledge and
intent; “[t]he government need not prove ... that the unlawful sexual activity
actually took place.” U.S. v. Vargas-Cordon, 733 F.3d 366, 375 (2d Cir. 2013).
Thus, Counts Three and Four should have been dismissed.

However, to save Counts Three and Four from dismissal, the court rejected
this categorical approach altogether and opted instead for a “case-specific” one,
which would permit it to examine whether this particular defendant’s alleged
conduct “involve[ed] the sexual or physical abuse...of a child.” In so doing, the
court brushed aside the clear weight of authority, which holds that statutes
employing “offense...involves” or “offense...involving” language identical to §
