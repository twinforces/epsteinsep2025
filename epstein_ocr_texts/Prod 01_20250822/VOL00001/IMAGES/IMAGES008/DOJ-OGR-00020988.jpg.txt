A. Applicable. law:

‘The. Double:Jcopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment guarantees that no person.shall, “be.
subject for. the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb:” U:S. Const. amend. V.
‘That guaranitee “serves principally as a restraint on courts and:prosecutors,” ensuring that-a-court
does not “exeeed.its legislative, authorization by-imposing multiple punishments for. the same
offense?” Brown v. Ohio,.432 U.S. 161,165 (1977); see also Morris v. Reynolds, 264 F.3d 38,,
48,(2d-Cir. 2001). An indictment:is:multiplicitous, and therefore implicates double jeopardy,
“when-it charges a singleoffense as:an offense multiple ‘times, in separdte counts, when, in law
and fact, only one crime has been committed.” Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3dsat 322: (quoting United
States v. Chacko, 169F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 1.999)).. “A: claim of multiplicity cannot succeed,,
chowever,, “unless the ‘charged.offenses.are the same in fact and in law.’” Wnited'States v. Jones,
482 F.3d 60, 72 (2d:Gir. 2006) (quoting United States v. Estrada,,320°F.3d 1.73, 180 (2d Cir.
2003).

‘TE the two offenses al issue are both. conspiracies: charged under the same statute, then the
multiplicity inquiry turns.on-whether. the two conspiracies are'the same. “in fact,” meaning they
involve the same agreement. United Staies v. Araujo, No. 17-GR-438 (VEC), 2018: WL
3222527, at'*3 (S.D.N.Y. July.2, 2018) (citing United States v. Ansaldi, 372 F.3d 1-18, 124-25
(2d:Cir. 2004)); United States v. Gaskin, 364 F.3d.438,.454 (2d.Cir. 2004) (“[T]o:survive:a.
double jeopardy. attack, the government would-have’to show’ thatthe two'schemes involved
“distinct? agreements.”). Yet “whether the evidence shows'a-single conspiracy or more than one:
conspiracy. 1s often not determinable as a'matter oflaw or subject‘to bright-line formulations.”
Jones, 482 F.3d.at 72. Rather, the parties agree that the Court’s inquiry is guided. by the Second.
