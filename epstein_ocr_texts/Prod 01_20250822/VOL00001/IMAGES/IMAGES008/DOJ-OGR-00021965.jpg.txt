1 With regards to the surrender of firearm, I'm asking

2 that your Honor not make that a requirement of her release. I
3 ask that because - in this nonviolent allegation, in which no

4 firearm was involved, with a history of having no criminal

a record of any kind or any history of violence - she, who

6 legally possesses and has a permit for the firearm, should

7 still be able to possess her firearm because she's not a

8 convicted felon and someone who's not permitted to do so.

9 She's â€”--

10 THE COURT: Is that a duty firearm or personal use?

11 MR. FOY: Personal.

12 So that's the only issue that I have, because I think
13 that at this time, to sacrifice that right that she legally

14 has, and has complied with everything that it means to have

15 that firearm, that she still be able to do so. I could imagine
16 that there could be an argument about safety of others;

17 however, there's nothing to really corroborate the fact that

18 her continuing to possess her firearm, just like she has in the
19 past, would actually endanger anyone. We voluntarily
20 surrendered. We participated in a pretrial interview. There's
21 just no reason for it, other than probably a policy that says
22 that's what they would like to do.
23 Now, it's a meaningful one, I'm not saying that it's a
24 bad thing, but under the unique circumstances here, in this
25 case, in the history and type of case that it is, I'm asking
