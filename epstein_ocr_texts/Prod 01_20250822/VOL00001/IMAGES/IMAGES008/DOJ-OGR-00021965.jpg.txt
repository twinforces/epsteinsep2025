With regards, 'to the Surréndéer of firearm, I"m asking
that your Honor not make that a requirement of her release, I
ask that because - in ‘this nonviolent allegation, in which no
firearm was involved, with a histery of having no criminal
record of any kind or any History of wiolence - she, who
legally possesses and has a permit for the firearm, should
still be able to possess her firéarm becaltise She"S not a
convicted felon and semeone who's not permitted to do so.
Shé's, --

THE COURT: Is that a duty firearm or personal use?

MR. FOY: Personal.

Sq that’s the only issue that I have, because I think,
that at this time, to sacrifice that right that sHe legally
has, and has complied with evenything that it means to have
that firearm, that she still be able to dé so. T could imagine
that, there could be an, argument about safety of others;
however, there's nothing to really corrobdérate the fact that
her continuing to possess ber firearm, just like she has in the
past, would actually endanger anydéne. We voluntarily
sunrendered. We partacipated in a pretrial interview. There's
just no reason for it, other than probably a policy that. says
that's what they would like to do.

Now, it's a teaningful one, I'm not saying that at's a
bad. thing, but under the unique circumstances Nere, in this
casey in the history and type of case that it is; I'm asking
