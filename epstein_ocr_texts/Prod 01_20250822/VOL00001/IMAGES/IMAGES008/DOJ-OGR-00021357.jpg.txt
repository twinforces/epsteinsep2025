OPR explored the: subject supervisors’ reasoning for accommodating the defense requests
for insperson meetings and whether such accommodation. was unusual. OPR questioned cach of.
the four supervisory subject attorneys about-his: rationale for engaging in multiple meetings: with.

Lourie could not. recall. his reasoning :for meeting. with Epstein’s defense; counsel, ‘but. he
told OPR. that his general practice’ was to meet with defense counsel when asked'to do:so. Lourie
recognized:that some prosecutors—like Villafaftia—viewed meeting with.the defense as a sign.of.
“weakness,” but:in Loutie’s view, “information isspower” and as long:as the USAO did not share
information with the defense but rather listened to. their arguments, meetings: were: “all: ‘power to

Lourie. explained, that by meeting with the. defense; “[Y Jou’re. getting’ the information that:
they think. is: important; that: they’ re going to focus:on. The.witnesses that they think are liars .....
And so you can forin all of that; into your‘ strategy.” Lourie also told, OPR. that: giving defense
counsel the opportunity to. argue ‘the defense position. is an. important: “part .of the: process” that.
helped ensure procedural ‘fairness, allowing them. to “believe that they are getting heard.” When
asked. whether he‘afforded the same access'to all defendants, Lourie:responded,,“Idon’trecal lever
getting. . . so many. requests for mectings:... . and:so many, appeals and so. many audiences that:
{Epstein’s attorneys] got. But this was I think,the: first-time that that’s really happened.”

Menchel, too, told ORR. that his :gencral view was that “ethically it’s appropriate” to give.a,
defense attorney “tan audience,” and there was:no: real “downside” to doing so. Menchel. added,
“CW hat. happens a lot of times is, the governmenti will Carve around those points: that are. beifig:
raised by the: defense, and.it’s good to know” what the defense will. be.

During. his OPRJinterview,.Acosta rejected the‘notion, that his'meeting with defense counsel.
was unusual or outside the norm. He told OPR ‘that: his initial meeting with. the: defense. ‘team,
before the NPA was signed, was" “not the firstand only time'that. [granted a‘mecting .... to defense
attorneys’ who. requested one. Acosta didnot believe:it was “atypical” for aU.S. Attorney to meet
with: opposing: counsel, particular ly as. a, caSé Was. coming to resolution. Sloman. corroborated
Acosta on this point, telling OPR that Acosta typically met with. defense attorneys, and. that: the.
USAO handled requests formectings from Epstein’ s:counsel “inthe normal. course” Furthermore,
Acosta said. that notwithstanding that-mecting and.all the other. “process” granted. to the defense:
by the USAO and the Departinent, “we successfully héld-firin in our positions” on the key élements
of the resolution—that. is, the requirements ‘that. Epstein be incarcerated,, register as a sexual,
offender, and provide. monctary damages to the victims.

OPR. examined the circumstances surrounding each. subject’s decisions to ‘have: the:
individual mectings with defense counsel to determine if those imectings had a, neutral, strategic
purpose. The first meeting, on. February: ‘1,, 2007, followed a phone: call‘between Lourie and. one
of Epstein’s attorneys, in which the attorney’ asked ‘for’.a chance to “make a pitch” about the
victims’ lack.of credibility and suggested that.Epstein might agree to an. interview following that.
pitch. Villafana objected to mecting: with the defense, but she-tecalled-that: Lourie told her'she was
not being.’a “strategic thinker;” and. that. he: believed the meeting, could. lead ‘to a debricfing of.
Epstein. The meeting did not result:in. a ‘debriefing of'Epstein, but in advance of the follow- -up
meeting on February 20, 2007, defense counsel gave the: USAO audio recordings of ‘the :state’s
witness, interviews., Contemporaneous documents; indicate that Lourie was unpersuaded ‘by the
defense arguinents. After Villafana circulated. the prosecution memorandum, Lourie suggested
