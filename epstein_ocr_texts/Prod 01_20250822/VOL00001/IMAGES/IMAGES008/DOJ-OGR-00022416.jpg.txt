9 he told me that he always wished that he had married
10 her and had a child with her.
11 And I know that they -- she was family for
1? him for his whole life. And I think even -- I'm not
13 sure this is true, but you guys will know if this is
14 true or not. When he came from -- back from Paris
15 and you arrested him, I don't know if Eva was on the
16 plane.
17 Now, I think that either I read it in the
18 -- in the discovery that I received, or I saw it
19 somewhere. But even if she wasn't on the plane,
20 there must have been some email communication where
21 she was in Paris at the same time and going to fly
22 back.

24 is the correct version of that. But so they were
25 still obviously very close and remained throughout
