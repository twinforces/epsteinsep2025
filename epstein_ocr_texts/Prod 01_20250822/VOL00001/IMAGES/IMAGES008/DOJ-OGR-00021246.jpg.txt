Early in the federal investigation, Villafafia recognized the potential significance of
obtaining the missing computer equipment. Villafafia told OPR that she and the FBI agents went
through every photograph found in Epstein’s house, but found none that could be characterized as
child pornography. Nevertheless, Villafafia told OPR that investigators had learned that Epstein
used hidden cameras in his New York residence to record his sexual encounters, and she believed
he could have engaged in similar conduct in his Palm Beach home. In addition, the computer
equipment potentially contained surveillance video that might have corroborated victim statements
about visiting Epstein’s home. More generally, in Villafafia’s experience, individuals involved in
child exploitation often possessed child pornography.’”  Villafafia’s co-counsel, who had
substantial experience prosecuting child pornography cases, similarly told OPR, “Epstein was a
billionaire. We knew his house was wired with video, it would be unusual [for] someone with his
capabilities not to be video recording” his encounters.

As the investigation continued, Villafafia took various steps to acquire the computer
equipment removed from Epstein’s Palm Beach residence. As noted previously in this Report, in
her initial request to Epstein’s counsel for documents, she asked defense counsel to provide “[t]he
computers, hard drives, CPUs, and any other computer media (including CD-ROMs, DVDs,
floppy disks, flash drives, etc.) removed from” the residence. Although Lourie subsequently
narrowed the government’s request for documents, the request for computer equipment remained.
The defense, however, failed to comply with the request.

Villafafia learned that the computer equipment was in the possession of a particular
individual. After consulting the Department’s Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section
and Office of Enforcement Operations about the appropriate legal steps to obtain the computer
equipment, Villafafia described her plan in an email to Menchel. She asked Menchel for any
comments or concerns, but OPR did not find an email response from him, and Menchel told OPR
that he did not recall Villafafia’s efforts to obtain the computer equipment.

In May 2007, following the plan she had outlined to Menchel, Villafafia initiated action
requiring production of the computer equipment by a particular date. In her email to Villafafia on
June 29, 2007, Sanchez requested a two-week extension, indicating that she hoped a “state-based.
resolution” to the case would soon be reached.”? Villafafia advised her supervisors of the request,
and responded to Sanchez that she “would like to get the computer equipment as soon as possible.”
Nonetheless, Villafafia eventually agreed to an extension.

Meanwhile, Epstein attorney Roy Black wrote separately to Villafafia, demanding to know
whether Villafafia had complied with applicable Department policies before seeking the computer
@ In addition, Villafafia became aware that in August 2007, FBI agents interviewed a minor victim who stated
that she had been photographed in the nude by Epstein’s assistant, who told the victim that Epstein took pictures of
the girls.

B This email led Villafafia to ask her supervisors if any of them had discussed with the defense a possible
resolution of the case, which resulted in Villafafia’s exchange of emails with Menchel about their respective views of
the case. See Section IV.A.2 in this Part.
