11/22/2021 495 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court will send the temporarily sealed
Memorandum Opinions and Orders to the parties. By November 24, 2021, the parties are

to file any proposed redactions to the moving papers and/or supporting exhibits on the
public docket, again justifying any such request by reference to the Lugosch test. (Signed

11/22/2021 496 | ORDER 486 LETTER MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs
Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated November
22, 2021 re: Proposed Redactions. The Court is in receipt of the Government's,
Administrator Feldman's, and two anticipated witnesses' motions to quash the
Defendant's Rule 17(c)(3) subpoena. Dkt. No. 486. The motions to quash are DENIED.
The Court hereby ORDERS the Administrator of the Epstein Victims' Compensation
Program to produce to the Court via electronic thumb drive any materials responsive to
the subpoena as soon as possible, but no later than 12:00 p.m. on November 24, 2021.
Accordingly, the parties shall negotiate a protective order and submit the proposal for
approval by the Court no later than 12:00 p.m. on November 24, 2021 (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 11/22/21) Gw) (Entered: 11/23/2021)

11/22/2021 691 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Defense on
November 1, 2021, noticed eight expert witnesses. Def. Br., Ex. 1 ("Notice"). Two of
those experts, Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, are expected to offer opinions that
rebut opinions of the Government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio. The Government on
November 8, 2021, filed a motion to partially preclude the testimony of Dr. Dietz and Dr.
Loftus. Dkt. No. 424. The Court has already addressed that motion. On November 15,
2021, the Government moved to fully or partially preclude the testimony of the remaining
six experts. The Defense filed a response on November 19, 2021. The Court addressed
the admissibility of Dr. Ryan Hall in a separate written opinion. In this opinion, the Court
addresses the preliminary admissibility of Bennett Gershman based on the parties' current
proffers....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... IIL. Conclusion. The
Court therefore grants the Government's motion to preclude Gershman's expert testimony.
Because this is a preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and circumstances at
trial would alter the Court's analysis. In that event, the Defense must re-raise its request to
admit Gershman as an expert witness. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan

in public rulings....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... I. Conclusion.
The Court therefore grants the Government's motion to preclude Dr. Hall's expert
testimony. Because this is a preliminary pre-trial ruling, it is possible that facts and
circumstances at trial would alter the Court's analysis. In that event, the Defense must re-
raise its request to admit Dr. Hall as an expert witness. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge
