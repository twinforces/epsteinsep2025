minors for sexual abuse. Trial Tr. at 714-19. Applying that expert testimony to the witnesses’
testimony, the Government argued that the Defendant’s conduct as to each victim followed a
uniform “playbook.” H.g., id. at 2184 (“She ran the same playbook again and again and again.
She manipulated her victims and she groomed them for sexual abuse.”), 2853 (“The patterns you
saw throughout this trial, the playbook that Maxwell ran for years, is just one of the many ways
that you know that Maxwell is guilty.”). And the Government emphasized the many similarities
in the Defendant’s conduct as recounted by all four witnesses. /d. at 2848 (“The similarities

testified regarding Count Five. The Government argued that her testimony “was corroborated by
what Annie and Kate and Jane told [the jury] about Maxwell and how she operated for years.”
Id. at 2880; see also id. at 2895-96 (“Maxwell groomed both Annie and Carolyn as part of a
broader agreement with Epstein to provide him with underage girls for abuse.”). The
Government, in short, argued that the Defendant engaged in substantially the same operations for
a decade as to all victims under both Counts Three and Five.

The Government responds that while the Defendant and Epstein continuously conspired

acquired underage girls by paying them for so-called “massage” appointments. Gov. Br. at 32
(quoting Trial Tr. at 40). To be sure, the Government in both its opening statement and its
closing arguments explained that the Defendant and Epstein’s abuse “evolved over the course of
