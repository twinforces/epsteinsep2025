iwenty- four ‘hours a ‘day: ‘at the County Jail.” Ina subsequent email. to Sloman, Villafaftarecounted
that she had spoken about ‘the issue with Goldberger, who “*swore’ that; Epstein would be: in,
custody. 24-hours-a-day during the community, confinement portion ‘of. his sentence.” Villafafia
added that Goldberger“ let it-slip that Epstein would not be at the jail, he would be at the stockade

. Since'we specifically discussed this at the mecting:with [the State Attorney] months ago that.
Epstein would, be: at. [the: jail], this certainly, violates. the :spirit. of the [NPA] agreement. 72
