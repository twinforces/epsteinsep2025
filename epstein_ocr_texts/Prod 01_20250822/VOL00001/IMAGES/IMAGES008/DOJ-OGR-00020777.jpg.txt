‘provides no ‘indication of whatmany-ofthese:potential:witnesses:might have testified:to. The
‘testimony she suggests’the. detective:might have offered—that-witnesses’in‘the. Palm. Beach
‘investigation did:not identify Maxwell.by:name—is propensity, evidence that does nothing to,
establish ‘her innocence ofthe. charged offenses. There are. also serious ‘doubts under all of the
‘relevant circumstances that a jury;would have found.testimony: from.Epstein credible even if he,
had waived ‘his:right against self-incrimination. and testified on‘her behalf. See United:States v.

‘Maxwell’s arguments thatthe indictment shouldbe dismissed because of the possibility,
of'missing: witnesses, failing memories, or. lost:records :fail for similar reasons. These:are
difficulties that arise in any’ case whererthere isextended delay in-bringing a prosecution, and
‘they do-not justify dismissingian indictment. United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 325-26
(1971); see United.Siates-v: Elsbery, 602 F.2d.1054, 1.059 (2d Gir. 1979).

Finally, the-Court finds no substantial prejudice from. the’ pretrial publicity:this case has
garmmered. ‘Maxwell contends that lengthy public interest in. this case has transformed-her
reputation from that of Epstein’s ‘friend to a co-conspirator. And. shesalso alleges—without
evidence—that her accusers fabricated their stories’based on media allegations: The: Court will
not dismiss the: indictment on Maxwell’s-bare assertion that numerous witnesses are: engaged inva
‘perjurious conspiracy ‘against her. And.the:Court will take all.appropriate: steps to ensure that the
‘pretrial publicity‘in.this case doesnot compromise Maxwell's right toa. fair and-impartial jury.

‘The: Court thus concludes that Maxwell_has failed to establish actual prejudice! from the
Government’s delay in, bringing charges. She may renew her, motion if the factual record at trial,
shows otherwise. On the'present record, neither the applicable statute of limitations nor due

process bars the charges here:
