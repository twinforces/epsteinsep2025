The balance of these considerations favors severance. “Motions to sever are committed.
to the sound discretion of the trial judge.” United States v. Casamento, 887 F.2d 1141, 1149 Qd
Cir. 1989). In its discretion, the Court concludes that trying the perjury counts separately will
best ensure a fair and expeditious resolution of all charges in this case.

VI. Maxwell’s motion to strike surplusage is premature

Maxwell moves to strike allegations related to one of the alleged victims from the S1
superseding indictment as surplusage. The Court declines to do so at this juncture.

Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(d) allows a court to strike surplusage from an
indictment on a defendant’s motion. “Motions to strike surplusage from an indictment will be
granted only where the challenged allegations are not relevant to the crime charged and are
inflammatory and prejudicial.” United States v. Hernandez, 85 F.3d 1023, 1030 (2d Cir. 1996)
(cleaned up). Courts in this District generally delay ruling on any motion to strike until after the
presentation of the Government’s evidence at trial, because that evidence may affect how
specific allegations relate to the overall charges. See, e.g., United States v. Nejad, No. 18-cr-224
(AJN), 2019 WL 6702361, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 6, 2019); United States v. Mostafa, 965 F.
Supp. 2d 451, 467 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).

Maxwell contends that the allegations related to “Minor Victim-3” are surplusage
because the indictment does not charge that Minor Victim-3 traveled in interstate commerce or
was below the age of consent in England where the alleged activities took place. Thus, she
argues, these allegations do not relate to the charged conspiracy and instead reflect an attempt to
introduce Minor Victim-3’s testimony for impermissible purposes.

The Court will not strike any language from the S1 superseding indictment at this
juncture. The standard under Rule 7(d) is “exacting” and requires the defendant to demonstrate
