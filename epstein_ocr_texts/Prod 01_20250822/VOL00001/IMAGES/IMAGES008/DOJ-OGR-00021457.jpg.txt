PART THREE: ANALYSIS

I. OVERVIEW

In. addition to criticism of Acosta’s decision to end the federal investigation by. means of.
A

‘A. litigation and in more recent media reports, victims complained that they were not
informed. about ‘the government’s intention, to end its investigation. of Epstein, because the
government did not consult, with victims before the NPA ‘was signed; did not inform them. of.
Epstein’ s State plea hearing, and sentencing, thereby denying thei the oppor tunity” to attend; and
actively misled.them. through statements that the federal investigation. was ongoing. The district
Couit-oversecing the CVRA litigation concluded that the government: violated.the. Crime Victims’

Rights Act and.“‘misl[cd] the-victims to believe that federal’prosecution- was still a possibility” and.
that “[i]t was, a material omission for the Governinent to. stiggest to: the Victims that they have
patience: relative to an. investigation. about which ‘it had already bound itself not to prosecute. 305
The government’s: conduct, which involved:both FBI and USAO actions, led. to allegations ‘that:
the: prosecutors had purposefully failed to'inform victims of the NPA, to prevent. victims from
complaining publicly or ‘in state court.

OPR examined the government’s: course:.of. conduct ‘when interacting with the victims,
including the lack:of consultation with the victiins before the NPA was signed: Acosta’s decision.
to defer to state authorities the decision to notify victims of-Epstein’s state plea;, andthe decision
to delay informing victims about the NPA ‘until after Epstein entered his plea on June 30, 2008.
OPR. considered whether Ictters ‘sent to victims by. the FBI after the NPA was’ signed. contained.
false or misleading statements. OPR also, evaluated, representations. Villafaiia made to victims in.
January and February 2008, and to-an attorney for'a victim,in June 2008.

Il. THE SUBJECTS DID. NOT VIOLATE A CLEAR AND UNAMBIGUOUS
STANDARD BY ENTERING INTO THE NPA WITHOUT CONSULTING THE
VICTIMS.

During the CVRA litigation, the government acknowledged that the USAO did-not consult
with. victims about the government’s intention ‘to enter. into the NPA. In its February:21, 2019
Opinion, the district court concluded that “once the Government failed to advise the victims about:
‘its intention. to enter into the NPA, a violation of the GVRA occurred.” OPR. considered this
finding as. part of its investigation into. the USAO’s handling of the Epstein. case, and, examined
whether, before: the NPA was signed on. September 24, 2007, federal prosecutors were obligated
to consult with Victims under'the CVRA, and if so, whether any of the subject-attorneys—Acosta,
Sloman, Menchel, Louric,, or Villafatia—intentionally ‘violated. or recklessly. disregarded ‘that.
obligation.
