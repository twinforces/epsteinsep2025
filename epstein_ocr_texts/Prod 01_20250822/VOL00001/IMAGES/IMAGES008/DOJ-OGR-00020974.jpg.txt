aspect of Questions 48 and 49. As he repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped to
be selected. The Court finds Juror 50’s testimony to be credible, forthright, and responsive and
does not find as a factual matter that Juror 50 deliberately lied in order to be selected as a juror.

The Defendant’s reliance on Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d 150 (1st Cir. 2013), is
similarly unavailing. See Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 11. There, a juror failed to disclose that
her husband had previously threatened her with a shotgun during jury selection for a bank
robbery case in which the defendants threatened the bank tellers at gunpoint. However, the juror
had told a “litany of lies” during voir dire bearing on a number of issues, including her
daughter’s incarceration and her own substance abuse issues. /d. at 161-62, 168. By contrast,
Juror 50’s inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,
stems only from his experience of sexual abuse.

Second, the Defendant contends that Juror 50 was biased due to the “similarities between
[his] personal experiences . . . and the issues being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 30 (quoting
Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp. 2d at 472). She expressly disavows arguing “that every person who has
been a victim of sexual assault or sexual abuse was subject to a ‘mandatory’ challenge for cause
based on implied bias.” Maxwell Reply at 17. Distancing from that position is necessary—
again, it is not the law that an individual with a history of sexual abuse cannot serve as a fair and
impartial juror. Rather, the Defendant finesses the argument by saying that Juror 50’s personal
history is sufficiently similar to the issues at trial so as to warrant a mandatory finding of implied
bias, or alternatively, a discretionary finding of inferred bias, and points to Juror 50’s testimony
and post-trial statements as evidence that these purported similarities made him biased. Maxwell
Br. at 31-32; Maxwell Post-Hearing Br. at 5-6.
