aspect of Questions 48 and.49. As he:repeatedly explained, he never expected or even hoped.to
‘be selected. ‘The. Court finds.Juror 50’s:testimony to be. credible, forthright, and:responsive and,
does not find.as a ‘factual matter that Juror 50: deliberately‘lied:in order to be seleeted.as ‘a juror.

The.Defendant’s reliance, on. Sampson v. United States, 724 F.3d 150 (st Gir. 2013), is.
similarly unavailing. See Maxwell. Post-Hearing Br. at'11. There, a juror-failed‘to disclose that
ther husband-had previously threatened ‘her with.a. shotgun: during. jury:selection: for a/barik
robbery :casezin which:the. defendants threatened the’bank tellers at; gunpoint. However, the juror
had told.a “litany of lies” during voir dire;bearing on a numberof issues, including her,
daughter’s incareeration.and her‘own, substance abuse issues. /d. at 161-62, 168. By contrast,
Juror.50’s:inadvertent nondisclosure, while implicating multiple questions on the questionnaire,
stems only ‘from-his:experience of sexual abuse.

Second, the Defendant: contends that Juror 50'was biased due to the “similarities between
[his] personal experiences;. .. and:the issues’ being litigated.” Maxwell Br. at 30 (quoting
Daugerdas, 867 F. Supp.'2d at 472). She ‘expressly disavows arguing “that every person who has
been.a:victim of sexual assault or sexual. abuse was subject to a “mandatory” challenge for. cause.
based on implied bias.” Maxwell:‘Reply at 17. ‘Distancing ‘fiom that’ position is necessary—
again, ‘it is not the law’thatvan individual with a-history of sexualabuse: cannot serve asa ‘lair‘and
‘impartial juror. Rather, the.Defendant finesses the argument by. saying ‘that Juror 50°s personal.
+history-is sufficiently: similar to'the issues.at trial'so as to'warrant a mandatory finding ‘of'implied
‘bias, orsalternatively, 'a:discretionary: finding of inferred bias, and. points to Juror :50’s testimony:
and post-trial statements as evidence that these purported-similarities made him.biased. Maxwell.
