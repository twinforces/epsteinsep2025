865 F.3d at'60. Maxwell:nonctheless contends:that-using a case-specific approach ‘for § 3283
‘would be. impractical because;the Government would need to:prove conduet beyond the elements,
ofthe offense. Itmay:be true’that this approach. requires the Government to, prove some
additional :facts, but-any: statute-of- limitations, defense presents factual issues (including, at least;,
‘when the alleged conduct took:place). ‘This is nota. serious practical:problem and.does not:
justily-setting aside. the statute’s language and-apparent purpose.

‘Maxwell relies primarily on.Bridges-v. United States, 346:U.S. 209 (1953), to-urge this
Court to-cast Weingarten aside. The Supreme: Court in.Bridges-addressed a statute that extended.
‘the limitations period for, defrauding the United States:during:the Second World’ War. In,that
case, the Supreme Court first:concluded that making false statements atan immigration-hearing
‘was not subject*to the extended. limitations: period because it lacked.any pecuniary ‘elementias:
required by the statute. Jd. iat 221. Then, as an.alternative’ basis ‘for its holding, it explained that
‘the offense did.not require ‘fraud ias:an “essential-ingredient.” /d. at 222. It-reached that
conclusion in large part because the statute’s legislative history made clear that Congress
‘intended.it to apply only: to a:narrow class of war frauds. causing pecuniary loss. Jd. at 216.

As the Second Circuit ‘explained‘in Weingarten, Congress‘had the-opposite intent in the
enacting in. the PROTECT Act. Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 59 &'n. 10. “In.passing:recent statutes
‘related to child. sex. abuse, including extensions of the § 3283 limitations: period, Congress
“evineed.a general intention.to “*cast a’wide net to ensnare:as‘many offenses against children as
Possible.” Jd, at 60 (quoting Schneider, 801 °F .3d at 196 (quoting United States 'v: Dodge, 597
F.3d 1347, 1355.1 th Cir. 2010) (en banc))). “Ihe primary basis for Bridges’ holding—
legislative history supporting a-narrow interpretation—does not exist here. Instead, both the:

statute’s'pla meaningiand its legislative history suggestit should-apply. more broadly,
