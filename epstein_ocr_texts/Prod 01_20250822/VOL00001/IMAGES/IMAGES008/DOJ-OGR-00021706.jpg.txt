“induce[]” a child to engage in illegal sexual activity
by transporting the minor across state lines with in-
tent that the child engage in an illegal sex act, 18
U.S.C. § 3509(a)(8), and Count Three, as a conspiracy
to commit Count Four, is an “offense involving [such]
sexual ... abuse,” id. § 3283. See United States v.
Sensi, No. 08 Cr. 253 (WWE), 2010 WL 2351484, at *2-
3 (D. Conn. June 7, 2010) (collecting cases interpreting
the term “sexual abuse” to encompass “all crimes that
would logically relate to the common understanding of
sexual abuse even when found in chapters 110 (Sexual
Exploitation and Other Abuse of Children’) and 117
(‘Transportation of Illegal Sexual Activity and Related
Crimes’) of title 18”); Schneider, 801 F.3d at 196-97
(holding that Section 3283 applied to defendant con-
victed of traveling with the purpose of engaging in sex
with a minor victim, in violation of 18 U.S.C.
§ 2423(b)).

Accordingly, even considering only the elements of
the offenses, Counts Three and Four fall squarely
within Section 3283's definition of an offense involving
sexual abuse of a child.

b. Maxwell’s Argument for Use of a
Categorical Approach Lacks Merit

Because Counts Three and Four qualify as “of-
fense[s] involving the sexual ... abuse ... of a child,”
18 U.S.C. § 3283, even without resort to the facts of the
case, the Court need not address Maxwell’s claim that
the categorical approach applies in this context. But
the arguments Maxwell advances in support of her
claim are meritless in any event.
