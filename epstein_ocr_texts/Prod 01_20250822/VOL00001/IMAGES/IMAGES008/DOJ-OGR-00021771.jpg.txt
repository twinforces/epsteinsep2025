bias, a juror’s statements in voir dire are completely irrelevant. The juror may
declare that he feels no prejudice in the case. But the law cautiously incapacitates
him from serving on the jury because, in general, persons in a similar situation would.

U.S. 339.U.S. 162,176 (1950). Juror 50 fails that.test.

Smith v. Phillips, 455 U.S. 209, 222 (1982) (O'Connor, J., concurring)), led,

and counsel of vital. information, as to challenges for cause or peremptory challenges
create the extreme situation warned about by Justice.O’Connorand the./orres court.
