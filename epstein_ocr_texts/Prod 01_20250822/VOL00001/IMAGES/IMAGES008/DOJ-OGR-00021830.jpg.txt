Case 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024,.3636586, Page6 of'51

En. Banc may be ordered when, as here, the panel decision. was. based on a.
decision of this Court that it was. not permitted to overrule.' That decision, United
States v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670 (2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam), created a.canon of
construction for interpreting plea agreements, that conflicts with, the authoritative
decisions of other United States Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue
and stands in tension with. what the Supreme Court and this Circuit have written
about plea and immunity agreements.

Annabi holds that ‘‘a:plea agreement binds only the office of the United.
States.Attomey for the district in which the plea is entered-uiiless it affirmatively
appears that the agreement contemplates a broader. restriction.” Annabi at 672. This
default rule necessarily. conflicts with the long-standing rule in. this circuit (and
others) that plea agreements are to be construed “strictly against the
Goverment.” Unitéd States-v. Padilla, 186 F.3d 136, 140 (2d Cir. 1999)

(quoting United States v. Ready, 82 F.3d 551, 558-59 (2d Cir. 1996). United States
v. Johnson, 93 F.4th 605, 616-617 (2024). See also United States v. Difeaux, 163

F.3d 725, 728 (2d Cir. 1998) (“The reviewing court ‘must ... construe ambiguous

an,cn bane panel. of our Court or by the Supreme Court.See Uniled States v. Wilkerson, 361 F.3d.
