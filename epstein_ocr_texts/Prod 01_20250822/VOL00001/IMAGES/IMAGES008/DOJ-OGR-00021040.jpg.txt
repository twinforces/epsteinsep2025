1 Epstein's house after November 2004 before she turned 18.
2 Message pads entered at trial show contact only before
3 November 1.
4 The government's reliance on two additional pads that
i) were not entered into evidence doesn't change my analysis. The
6 first message GX-4B, it's undated, and the context does not
7 give sufficient confidence that it came after November 1. The
8 other message pad is dated March 1, 2005, which falls outside

10 after Carolyn turned 18. Because I cannot on this record find
11 by a preponderance of the evidence that the offense continued
12 during that two-month window after November 1, 2004, and before
13 early 2005, I must apply the 2003 guidelines. Because I find
14 that the date of the offense was not after November 1, 2004, I
15 do not address the defendant's alternative argument that a jury
16 must decide if the 2004 Guidelines apply.
17 Within the Guidelines themselves, the defendant
18 objects to the application of three enhancements in the PSR.
19 She takes issue first with 4B1.5(b). The enhancement

22 4B1.5(a) for prior convictions does not apply; three, the
23 defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited
24 sexual conduct. All three requirements are met: The defendant
25 was convicted of a covered sex crime; she was not previously
