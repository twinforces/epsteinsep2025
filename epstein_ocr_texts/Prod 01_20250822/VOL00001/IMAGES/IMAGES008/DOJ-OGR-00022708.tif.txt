2 shortcomings of the Bureau of Prisons. 2 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Maybe 2016, 2017,
3 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Yes. 3. maybe 2016 -- 2015, 2016, 2017 in that area, I
4 TODD BLANCHE: Which is a little bit 4 believe.
5 different than my -- from my question is, which is, 5 TODD BLANCHE: And what -- when you're
6 do you think there was somebody on the outside of 6 thinking about that last tme was that you had
7 prison, so putting aside, what could happen on the 7 talked -- been talking to him a lot, and then you
8 inside on the outside of prison, who would -- who 8 stopped, or was that a one-off time and it was
9 wanted him dead so badly that he would've, or she 9 infrequent at that point?
10 would've, you know, caused him to be killed on the 10 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: [really wasn't in
11 inside? 11 communication. The only communications I had with
12 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I think that’s -- I 12 him was in -- with regards to the civil suits, the
13. don't see that. I think, is it possible? Of course 13 civil suit that I found myself in, the defamation
14 it's possible. But I don't know of any reason why, 14 — suit I found myselfin. I needed help, I needed
15 and I don't believe in the blackmail or in any of 15 — information, and I didn't have what I needed.
16 this, I don't think Epstein had a hit on like that. 16 And so that was really what it was -- that
17 [fit is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal 17 what drove it, was me trying to get myself out of
18 situation. 18 this situation, which I -- ultrmately led to where I
19 TODD BLANCHE: Yeah. So you're not -- you 19 am today.
20 don't have any reason firsthand knowledge or even 20 And so when -- when all that -- when
21 speculation, it sounds like, to think that he was -- 21 that -- I don't remember even if I stopped talking to
22 if -- that he was killed to kind of silence him or to 22 him before that, I think he was -- I thought he was
23 keep him from going public about people he knew 23 angry with me anyway. He didn't like what I did, and
24 about? 24 he -- I wasn't interested in what he had to say to
25 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I don't, no, becauseI 25 me, and --

1 think that is just part of the story that's been 1 TODD BLANCHE: What did you think he was
2 created that started back in 2008, '09. 2 angry with you about?
3 TODD BLANCHE: Okay. Yeah, I mean, that's 3 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I think he was angry
4 the point. Like, I don't want -- I don't think 4 that I had even said that I had referred to her being
5 there's value in talking -- you know, there's been a 5  aliar. He said I should have not said anything but.
6 lot of -- there's a lot of information about what 6 TODD BLANCHE: When the civil suits that
7 happened, you know, at the MCC and -- but what is 7 were ongoing before Mr. Epstein's death?
8 important to me is whether, you know, if -- is the 8 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Yes.
9 idea that he didn't die by suicide, that's one thing. 9 TODD BLANCHE: Did your lawyers coordinate
10  Butifto the extent that folks believe that he was 10 with his lawyers, like in discovery and things like
11 murdered to keep him quiet or because he had 11 that or anything?
12 information on rich and powerful people, that's what 12 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I don't think we
13 [| -- do you have any reason to believe that that's 13 coordinated in -- I don't -- I'm not sure.
14 ‘true? 14 TODD BLANCHE: Okay.
15 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I do not have any 15 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I don't want to
16 reason to believe that. And I also think it's 16 misspeak. I don't -- I -- there was some degree of
17 ludicrous, because if that -- I also happen to think 17 communication for sure. I just don't know the degree
18 if that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty 18 that that took place. So definitely -- I mean, I was
19 — of opportunity when he wasn't in jail. And if they 19 definitely hoping for him to be more helpful. And I
20 were worried about blackmail or anything from him, he 20 was definitely, coordinating is not a good word,
21 would've been a very easy target. 21 because that sounds like I was trying to make --
22 TODD BLANCHE: In the time -- so we've 22 align myself.
23 talked about a lot of time, all the way up through 23 That's not where we were going here, but I
24 2009, '10, and then your -- the time that after 24 was definitely trying to get help. As in documents
25 Mr. Epstein was arrested, when's the last time you 25 or information that I could use to defend myself.
