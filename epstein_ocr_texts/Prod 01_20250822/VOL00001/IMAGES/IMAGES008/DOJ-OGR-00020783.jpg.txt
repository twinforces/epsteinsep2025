one.” United States v. Werner, 620 F.2d 922, 929 (2d Cir. 1980). Though this standard is
demanding, the Court concludes that, due to unique features of the perjury counts, Maxwell
meets it here. Trying all counts together would compromise Maxwell’s right to the counsel of
her choice and risk an unfair trial.

Trying the perjury counts together with the Mann Act counts would risk an unfair trial on
each set of counts. First, it would introduce unrelated allegations of sexual abuse, which would
potentially expose the jury to evidence that might otherwise not be admissible. In particular, a
joint trial would potentially expose the jury to a wider swath of information regarding civil
litigation against Epstein that is remote from Maxwell’s charged conduct. This presents a
significant risk that the jury will cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find
guilt when, if considered separately, it would not do so. See United States v. Halper, 590 F.2d
422, 430 (2d Cir. 1978). Second, the evidence presented on the Mann Act counts may prejudice
the jury’s ability to fairly evaluate Maxwell’s truthfulness in her deposition, a critical element of
the perjury counts. The Court has concerns that a limiting instruction may be inadequate to
mitigate these risks given the nature of the allegations involved.

Importantly, a joint trial is also likely to require disqualification of at least one of
Maxwell’s attorneys from participating as an advocate on her behalf. The perjury counts likely
implicate the performance and credibility of her lawyers in the civil action—two of whom
represent her in this case. The New York Rules of Professional Conduct generally forbid a
lawyer from representing a client in a proceeding in which the lawyer is likely also to be a
witness. N.Y. R. Prof] Conduct § 3.7(a). Maxwell’s counsel in the civil action and the
deposition may be important fact witnesses on the perjury counts. Even if counsel were not
required to testify, trying all counts together could force Maxwell to choose between having her
