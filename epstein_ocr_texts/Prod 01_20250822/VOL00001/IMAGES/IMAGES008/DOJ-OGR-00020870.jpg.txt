The jury room went dead silent when he shared his story, he told The
Independent.
David believes this helped the jury understand that it’s possible that these
women were telling the truth.
You might forget some things, he said, but the core of a traumatic
memory stays with you.
There were also questions about why the girls kept going back to Epstein
and Maxwell, why they accepted their help.
“We are not here to judge these victims.” David told The Independent.
“We are here to judge whether we believe their stories, but we are not
here to judge the decisions they made or didn’t make.
“We cannot judge what they did or didn’t do afterward.” he said. “It
doesn't change that it happened.”
David felt that the defence were continually attacking the accusers on the
stand, and he said these attempts did little to change his mind.
At one point, the accuser testifying under the name “Carolyn” threw her
binder of evidence down beside her because she was so distressed by the
questioning she was being subjected to.
“Tt just made me feel more compassion for her.” David said.
The juror said that, ultimately, the jury found that all the victims were
credible.
The defence team focused strongly on its memory expert. Professor
Elizabeth Loftus. Loftus testified about experiments that had been
conducted in which researchers had successfully implanted a false
memory into the mind of research subjects.
In one study, the researchers were able to change a detail of a memory
about witnessing a car accident. They were able to convince participants
that the scene featured a stop sign rather than a yield sign.
But that didn’t sway the jury either, David said.
