narrative of Epstein’s: philanthropic:activities, rather than. presented as a suggestion that Epstein’s
association to the former Président warranted. leniency and, in ariy case, the USAO rejected. the
defense argument that:the matter should be left entirely to the state?s diseretion.?!? The defense:
submission ‘to ‘the Deputy. Attorney General contained a direct reference to Epstein’s corinection,
to former. President:Clinton, but that submission: was made:well. after'the NPA-was: negotiated and.
signed, afd.in.it, counsel contended that the USAO had-treated Epstein too harshly because of his
association with.the former President.?!*

2. The Subjects: Asserted That: They Were Motivated by Reasonable:
Strategic: and Policy-Considerations, Not-Improper Influences

In, addition, to: reviewing the. documentary evidence, OPR, questioned the five’ subject.
attorneys, all of whom.denied being personally. influenced by Epstein’s:wealth or status in making,
‘decisions regarding the inyestigation, in ‘the decision to resolve. the case through an NPA, or in,
negotiating the: NPA. Villafafia, in. particular, was. concerned from the: outset of the federal.
investigation that Epstein. might try ‘to: employ against. the USAO the same pressure that: she
understood had. been. used with the State Attorney’s, Office, and she proactively took steps to
counter Epstein’: 's possible influence by meeting with Acosta and. Sloman ‘to: sensitize them: 'to
Epstein’ s tactics. ‘Both Acosta and Sloman told OPR.that the USAO had handled cases inv olving,
wealthy, high- profile defendants before, including the Abrainoff case. Acosta told OPR, “[' We
tried to treat [the case] fairly, not Jooking, at... .how’wealthy is he, but also:not saying, we:nced to
do this becatise he is. so wealthy.” Meichel expressed, a Similar’ view, telling OPR that he did, not:
believe “it’s appropriate to-go after somebody becausce:of their status one:way or the other.” Lourie:
told OPR-that Epstéin’s, statis may have generated more “front office” invelvemient ih the case,
but it. did-not affect. the outcome, and Sloman “emphatically: disagree[d]” with the suggestion that.
the: USAOQ’s ‘handling:of the case had.been.affected by Epstein’s wealth or influential:connections.
Other witnesses corroborated.the: subjects” testimony. on this point, including the, FBI. case agents,
who ‘told OPR that :no one ever, communicated to them:that they should treat Epstein. differently
because of his wealth. The CEOS Chief told. OPR. that he did not recall anyone at the USAO
expressing ‘either qualms ‘or enthusiasm :about: proceeding against Epstein. because of his wealth.

OPR takes note of but does not consider dispositive the. absence of’ any affirmative
evidence that. the subjects were acting from improper ‘motivations or their denial of such
motivations.. Of more: significance, and. as discussed ‘more: fully: below, was: the fact that:
contemporancous records support the subjects’ assertions thatthe decision to pursue a:pre-charge
resolution, was; based on. 'various: case-specific: legal and factual considerations.?!* ‘OPR. also
