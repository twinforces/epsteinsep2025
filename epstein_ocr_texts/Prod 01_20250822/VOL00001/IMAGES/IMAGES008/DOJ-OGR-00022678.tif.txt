10 TODD BLANCHE: Sure. 10 TODD BLANCHE: But would you or him or
11 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: -- because it -- 11 anybody else follow up with the masseuse afterwards,
12 this -- one of the things that was definitely missing 12 to find out if there was any inappropriate sexual
13. in my trial, and definitely missing from the 13. contact?
14 narrative, is this notion, this, everything happened 14 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I never did, no.
15 and he was always but -- no. I don't -- I don't 15 TODD BLANCHE: So meaning -- and then
16 believe that to be true. 16 coming back to the blackmail issue.
17 TODD BLANCHE: So I mean, that -- 17 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Oh, yeah.
18 that's -- that's fine. And I do want to talk about 18 TODD BLANCHE: There’s nothing wrong with

20 just putting it aside for a moment. 20 know, especially if somebody's obviously an adult, a
21 What Mr. Epstein did and -- and, frankly, 21 masseuse. There's -- I'm not quibbling with that.
22 what -- what you did, or are accused of doing, is one 22 But my question is that there's a lot of
23 thing that I -- that we'll talk about, but what -- 23 accusations that -- that one of the way Mr. Maxwell,
24 right now what I want to understand is -- is whether 24  I'msorry, Mr. Epstein was successful, was -- was

6 people who were in their 20s or 30s. 6 TODD BLANCHE: But even women over the age
7 TODD BLANCHE: So -- so. Understand that. 7 of 18, if -- if Mr. Epstein encouraged these men or

9 would have a masseuse, right? And he did, male and 9 sexual contact with the masseuses, that's -- that's a
10 female, by the way, in the '90s, that's never been 10 separate issue. Maybe -- maybe slightly nuanced, but

12 ~ menas well as women. 12 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: No. I never did
13 And so 1f he would travel, and I can show 13 absolutely myself. I never heard him ask someone. I
