1 Epstein's house after November 2004 before she turned 18.
2 Message pads entered at trial show contact only before
3 November 1.
4 The government's reliance on two additional pads that
5 were not entered into evidence doesn't change my analysis. The
6 first message GX-4B, it's undated, and the context does not

11 by a preponderance of the evidence that the offense continued
12 during that two-month window after November 1, 2004, and before
13 early 2005, I must apply the 2003 guidelines. Because I find
14 that the date of the offense was not after November 1, 2004, I
15 do not address the defendant's alternative argument that a jury
16 must decide if the 2004 Guidelines apply.
17 Within the Guidelines themselves, the defendant

22 4B1.5(a) for prior convictions does not apply; three, the
23 defendant engaged in a pattern of activity involving prohibited
24 sexual conduct. All three requirements are met: The defendant
25 was convicted of a covered sex crime; she was not previously
