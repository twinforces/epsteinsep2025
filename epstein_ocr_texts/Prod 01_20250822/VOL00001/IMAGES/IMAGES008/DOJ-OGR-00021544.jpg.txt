the Defendant’s motion for a new trial. Cf Carbon Inv. Partners, LLC v. Bressler, No. 20-cv-
3617 (ER), 2020 WL 5441497, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 10, 2020). Accordingly, a high
presumption of access attaches. For the reasons stated in this Court’s prior order, this
presumption of access is not outweighed by the possibility of media interest in the document.
See Dkt. No. 596 at 3. Nor is sealing necessary to safeguard a possible hearing for the reasons
stated above. Finally, any privacy interest Juror 50 may have had in his questionnaire, see Press-
Enterprise Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., 464 U.S. 501, 511-12 (1984), has at least been greatly
diminished, if not extinguished, since his public comments. The Court further notes that
prospective jurors had the opportunity to request that particular questionnaire answers remain
confidential; Juror 50 did not make any such request. Accordingly, Juror 50’s privacy interest in
the questionnaire is now outweighed by the presumption of access. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 119-
20. The Defendant is accordingly ORDERED to docket Exhibit 1 to her motion for a new trial,
Juror 50’s completed questionnaire.

Vv. Conclusion

to Questions 25 and 48 of the questionnaire. The public proceeding will take place on March 8,
2022, at 10:00 a.m. Juror 50 is hereby ORDERED to appear in Courtroom 906 of the Thurgood
