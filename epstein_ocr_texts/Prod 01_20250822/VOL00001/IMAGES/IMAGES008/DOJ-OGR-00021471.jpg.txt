B. Acosta Exercised Poor Judgment When He Failed to Ensure That’ Victims
Identified. in the Federal. Investigation Were Informed of the State Plea
Hearing

Although Acosta (or the: USAO) was not. required: by law or’policy to notify victims of the
state’s plea hearing, he also was not.prohihited, by. law or policy from. notifying ‘the victims ‘that:
the: federal investigation, had been resolved. ‘through. an ‘agreement that included pleas to state
charges. .As ‘the contemporary records indicate, Acosta consistently expressed hesitancy. ‘to
interfere in the state’s: processes or to “dictate” actions'to ‘the State Attorney. His decision that the
USAO reftain-from notifying victims about the state ‘plea hearing and.defer to the State. Attorney’s
judgment regarding whether and whom to. notify was. consistent with this. view. However, OPR.
found no evidence that Acosta’s decision.to defer victinr notification. “to the discretion-of the State
Attorney” was ever actually coinmunicated. to any. state authorities or that, Acosta recognized ‘that:
the:state, absent:significant coordination with.federal. authorities, was. unlikely to contact all of the:
Victims identified ifthe state, aid federal iAvestigations or that the state would inforin the Victims,
that it.did notify that the: state plea hearing was part .of an agreement that. resolved the: federal.
investigation into ‘their own.cases.**

‘Even. taking ‘into account: Acosta’s views on principles of federalisny and. his: reluctance: to
‘interfere | in State processes, , Acosta should have recognized ‘the problems that would likely stem.
from. passing: the task: of notifying’ victims to the State. Attorney’s: Office and. made: appropriate.
efforts ‘to enstife. that those: problems were, minimized. Appropriate notification ‘would have
included advising victims identified in ‘the federal investigation that. the USAO had declined to
bring, charges’ and that-the imatter’ Was being, handled. by the State Attorney, and, at a minimum,
provided the: victims with Belohlavek’s contact information. Acosta could have interacted. with,
the State Attorney, or instructed Villafana.or others to: do so; to ensure the state: intended to make:
necessary to accomplish the task: Instead, Acosta deferred the responsibility fo victim notification
individuals the USAO believed + were’ » victims ‘and, apparently, without even, informing the state
prosecutors that he’ was deferring to, thein to-inake the: notifications, if they chose to do so.

Epstein was required by the NPA-to: plead. to, only two, state charges, and. even assuming,
that cach charge was ‘premised on a crime against a different victim, and. the solicitation charge
involved. three separate: victims, there were thus only. at:most four victims of the charged state
offenses. Without at least inquiring’into the state’s intentions, Acosta had-no way of, determining
whether ‘the ‘state intended to notify more than. those few victims. ‘Moreover, the: federal.
investigation had resulted in the identification of several victims who had ‘not been identified by

iiform.thé:victim.and to 'the.extent that will Horinterfere with thenwestigation.” See-42 C.S.E. $$ 10607(¢)(1)(B)
and.(c)(3)(A).

a3 Through counsel, Acosta. argued. that OPR's criticism of him for “electing to “deter* ‘the notification
Oblixatioi to ‘the. state” was inappropriate. atid “a num: Seguin” because “where: no ‘federal notifigation. obligation
‘exists.cit-cannot: be:deferred.” OPR’s criticism, asexplained further below, is notewith.the:decisiom itself but rather
‘with the’fact that althotiph. Acosta intended for the federal victims to be-notitiedof the state: -plea-héaring, and.bélieved
that-they, should receive such notification, he nonetheless:left:responsibility:for such notification to ‘the, state; without:
‘ensuring that it had the information-needed to do so-and.without determining the states ‘intended course.ofaction.
