Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page83 of 113
concerned memories of events that occurred so long ago and that those memories
of Maxwell’s peripheral involvement in the abuse were motivated and distorted by
external events. This issue was so central to the trial that the defendant called an
expert to testify about memories.

Assuming Juror 50 recounted a version of his abuse similar to what he
described at the hearing and in media interviews, there is no question that he would
have been excused on consent, stricken for cause or by an available peremptory
challenge.'? In the event that Juror 50 answered truthfully, Juror 50 would have
been questioned at length by the court, in camera. Honest answers to those
questions would certainly have resulted in a valid challenge for cause.

E. The District Court Abused its Discretion in the Manner in Which

it Conducted the Post-Trial Hearing

The court abused its discretion in precluding cross-examination of Juror 50 by
the defense and in limiting the scope of the questions.
” The potential jurors who admitted to being victims of sexual assault and were
not stricken for cause, reported conduct such as groping, harassment at work or on
the subway, and inappropriate touching in social settings - conduct that was
drastically different than the abuse suffered by Juror 50 — drastically different from
the abuse suffered by Juror 50 and the victims herein.
