‘ran the risk of moving the jury away from consideration of the core of:criminality-alleged in the
Indictment.*

‘The. appropriate, approach was. to ‘instruct the jury:on‘the. one and only predicate state
offense:for'the. Mann Act counts charged in the Indictment: New: ¥.ork.Penal Law Section
130.55. Eor'that reason, the Court also:rejected the Defendant’s request’to :repeatzin the, charge
‘the limiting instructions. as to:Kate’s. and Annic’s ‘testimony and.the Defendant’s:request, raised
forthe first time:at the charging:conference’and well afier completion;of-her testimony, to
include’an unspecified.limiting instruction as ‘to Jane*s.New:Mexico testimony. ‘Trial. Tr. at
2773-77. During the witnesses’ testimony; the jury‘had yct'to be instructed:on.the-meaning‘of:
“iegal.sexual activity as alleged in the indictment.” Butit was unnecessary. to repeat the
‘limiting instructions’ alongside the: charge’ s definition of “illegal sexual activ ity:” * Td. at.2774-75.
The jury now had that phrase: clearly defined.as:a‘violation of New York Penal Law Section.
130.55. In sum, the jury instructions charged that the jury could convict'the Defendantionly on
‘the predicate state.offense.of New Yorklaw. The j jury: is: presumed tothave followed these
instructions. See United. States v. Joyner, 3:13 F.3d.40, 47 (2d Cir. 2002).

At bottom, ‘the Defendant asks’ the Court to speculate based.onan ambiguous note that
the jury disregarded Jane*s substantial testimony~about travel:to New Y-ork and. sexual:conduct in.
‘New York. and further assumed/a.violation of-New: York law could’be based. on. conduct only. in

New Mexico. Itiishardlyplausible, Tet alone substantially likely, that:this was the jury’s:

“The Defendant’s proposed.instructionon.other jurisdictions? ages:of;consent first stated that * [Jo prove Counts
‘One.and Three, the government: miist:establish beyond aréasonable-doubtthacMs, Maxwell-acted with thé intent
‘that the-minors would engage-in sexual. activity for which-any person.can be;charged with a criminal offense.”
‘Request { to Charge-at 51. Tethen-instrticted on the ages‘ofconsent in several, jurisdictions: and stated’ that* “Tr ‘the
‘indiv idual was at or above the age. of consent: ‘in the relevant: jurisdiction when the sexual activ ity: ‘occurred, then for
the‘purposes.of Counts One and Three, the sexual activity was;not illegal.” /d.cat 52. This*proposed instruction
