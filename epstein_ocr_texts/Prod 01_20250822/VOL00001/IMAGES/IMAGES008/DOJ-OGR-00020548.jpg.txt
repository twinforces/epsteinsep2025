11/12/2021 | 458 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter
motion seeking clarification on two items from the November 1, 2021 pretrial
conference. Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification
about the line between permissible and impermissible cross—examination for witnesses
testifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to
permissible cross—examination of the witnesses’ careers would unduly curtail the
Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross—examination. See United
States v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2008). The line of questioning the
Government identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus
the Court will not limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on
cross—examination. As the Court noted at the November 1 conference, the Defendant
may not elicit the name of a specific employer, but the type and genre of employment
may be relevant to the jury's assessment of credibilty. Nov. 1, 2021 Transcript at
11-12. As to the second item, the Government is ORDERED to submit a proposed
order regarding sketch artist depictions of certain witnesses on or before November 18,
2021. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 11/12/2021) (ap) (Entered: 11/15/2021)
