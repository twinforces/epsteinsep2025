abuse. Hearing Tr. at 47; Questionnaire at 4. ‘The. Court finds. thatexplanation to be:reasonable.

Last, the Court:finds Juror 502s explanation:that his answers were made inadvertently: to
‘be the:most logical explanation of his overall behavior. Shortly: after trial, Juror 50-readily

The:Defendant raises several arguments. for‘why the Court should‘instead find.that Juror
50 committed perjury at the hearing and that his answers on, the questionnaire: were intentionally

‘inaccurate. The Court is not persuaded. /irs/. the Defendant characterizes much,of, Juror'50’s
