managers required more effort than.in other offices, where a line AUSA. can more easily. just stop
by a Supéfvisor’s office to discuss. a case. PST

‘Second, key 'personnel were: absent at varying times. Menchel’s last:day in the office was
August 3, 2007, the day he: sent'to the defense his letter making the! initial offer, and: presumably
‘in the immediate:period before his departure date, Menchel.would have been trying to-wrap up his
outstanding work. Yct, this was.also'the time when, Acosta was deciding how to'resolve the matter.
‘Similarly, :in-the critical. month of September, the NPA. and plea negotiations :intensified and the
NPA evolved significantly, with the USAO having’ to consider multiple different options as key
provisions were continuously added or. ‘modified. while Villafaiia pressed to meet her: late-
September deadlitie: Although. Lourie was involved with the negotiations during this: period, he
was at the.same‘time tr ansitioning,not only: to a:new job but to one in ‘Washington, D.G.,:and was
traveling between. the two. locations. Sloinai was on'vacation in the week preceding the signing,
when many significant changes * were e made’ to the agreement, and he, did. not Participate i in n drafting
significant case i inv olving a unique resolution, n noone involved.had both: a thorough under standing
ofthe case and. full ownership ofthe decisions that:were being made. Villafafia certainly felt:that:
during the negotiations, she was only: implementing decisions’made by Acosta. Acosta, however,
told. OPR that-when.reviewing the NPA, “I would have reviewed this forthe policy:concerns. Did.
it do'the... . bullet: points, and my assumption, rightly or wrongly, would have been that Andy. and
Marie would have looked at-this, and that this;was . . . appropriate.”

The: consequences. flowing from the lack ‘of ownership and effective communication: can
be seen in the NPA itself: As demonstrated by the conteniporaneous coinmiuhications, the
negotiations were at-times confusing as the:partics considered multiple. options and-cven revisited
proposals previously rejected. Meanwhile, Villafata sought to keep:to a deadlinethat would.allow:
her to charge Epstein. when she,had planned:to, if the parties did-not reach agreement. In the end,
Acosta.accepted several terms‘with little apparent discussion-or:consideration-of:the:ramifications.

The. USAO’s: agreement not: to. prosecute “any. potential co- conspirators” is a notable.
example. As previously noted, the only written disctssion about the term that OPR ‘found was
Villafana’s email. to..Lourie and. the incoming West Palm Beach manager, with copies to: her
e6-colnsel and direct supervisor, stating that she did not beli¢ve the provision “hurts us,” and.
neither Acosta, Lourie, nor Villafatia recalled.any further discussion about the'provision.. Although
OPR did not :find evidence showing that Acosta, Lourie, or Villafana ‘intended the scope of the:
provision to protectanyone other than Epstcin’s four assistants, the plain language:of the’provision
precluded the USAO from. prosecuting;anyone who:engaged:with Epstein. in-his criminal. conduct,
within the limitations set by ‘the overall agreement, This broad prosecution declination would.
likely be: unwise in. most: cases but in this casein particular, the USAO: did not have a sufficient
inVestigative. basis. from which. it could-conclude with any reasonable certitude that there were no
other individuals who should be held accountable along: with Epstein orthat evidence: might not
be developed implicating others. Prosecutors rarely promise not to prosecute unidentified third
