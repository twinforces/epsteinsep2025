1 But I know that they certainly do that. I
? would imagine -- and in fact, I think I have a
3 memory, but I can't -- that when Harvey was trying to
4 raise money for whatever his business was called, I
5 can't remember what his business was called.
6 Maybe he went there, because Epstein was
7 good at raising money. I just don't know. But I
8 never saw them. I don't -- I don't recall seeing
9 Harvey in any of the properties.
10 TODD BLANCHE: Let's just go a few more
11 minutes and take a break, I know it's after lunch.
12 So do you -- we talked several hours ago
13 about your father and his business a little bit.
14 After your father passed, do you know
15 whether Mr. Epstein was involved in your family
16 business, that you know of?
17 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Absolutely not, in any
18 respect. First of all, there was no family business
19 left. Start with that problem. And the second one
20 is, my family didn't like him very much. And they
21 were busy dealing with their own problems and there
22 was no relationship whatsoever.
23 Oh, I mean, he -- my mum and he got along
24 quite well. That was it. But that was -- she's an
25 old lady and, you know, he was nice to her.
