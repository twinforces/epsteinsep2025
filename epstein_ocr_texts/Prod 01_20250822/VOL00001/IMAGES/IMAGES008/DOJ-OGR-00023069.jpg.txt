we are contemplating'so Dershowitz. can tell'us why they’don’t apply.”*’ Lourie told Menchcel, “I.
don’t see the downside,” but, added, “Marie is. against. it’? Menchel responded that it was
“premature” to-provide the:information. During his OPR interview, Menchel could notispecifically
recall why he believed. it was “premature” to provide the défense with the requested. information,

‘but ‘speculated that it was:'too. soon after the prosecution :memorandum. had been circulated for
Acosia't to. have made a decision about how he: wanted to. » proceed. This recollection. i is consistent

On May 22, 2007, defense counsel Lefeourt emailed Louric. a letter to “confirm” ‘that.
Epstein’s attorneys would be given. an opportunity to meet with Louric before the USAO reached
a final decision on charging: Epstein. Louric forwarded the letter to Menchel and. Sloman, but
noted that Epstein’s.defense team,was “really ‘ready for the next.level,” rather than another meeting
with him. Louric: suggested that Menchel meet. with defense counsel, adding, “Whether Alex.
would be present: or grant them another meeting after that: is his call.” Lourie also emailed.
Lefcourt,, clarifying that Louric. had. not promised ‘to call. Epstcin’s counsel. before: filing charges,
and suggesting that Epstein’s counsel make:their:next presentation to.Menchel.

Although Lourie’s emails show that he: had ne objection to ‘more: scnior USAO' managers
meeting with defense counsel, Villafafia opposed such.a meeting. Several cmails indicate ‘that:
Menchcl. traveled to West Palm. Beach. to meet. with Louric and Villafafia on. the:.afternoon: of
May 23, 2007.7* On that same date, Villafafia drafted an email, which she planned. to: send. to
‘Sloman, and:Menchcel, expressing’her disagreement with meeting with defense: counscl., Although.
the email was written for Sloman and Menehcl, Villafafia. sent it-as a draft only to her immediate
supervisor, secking her “guidance and counsel” as to how to proceed.

Hi. Jeff and Matt — I just want to again. voice: my disagreement with
promising to have a, mecting or having a.mecting with Lefcourt or
anyother of Epstcin’s attorneys. Ass J mentioned, this is not.a,case
where we will be:sitting down to: negotiate whethcr.a defendant will
serve one year versus two years of probation. This isa. case where
the defendant. is. facing the possibility of dozens.of years of prison
time.. Just.as the defense-will defend a-case‘like that differently 1 than
they would-handle.a:probation-type:case, we'nced'to handle’this case
differently. Part of our‘prosecution strategy was already disclosed
at the last’ mecting, and.I am. concerned that :more will be disclosed
at a fiiture:mecting.

My. co-chair... who has prosccuted more of these eases than the
rest of us’ combined and, who: actually worked on the drafting of
some of the child exploitation. Statutes, also opposes a mecting. We
have been. accused of not being, “strategic: thinkers” because of our

Ai,

aK During her OPR interview, Villafafa could not recall the:mecting-with specificity, ‘but’ believed the: purpose
was to discuss whetherthe USAO should. agree to, additional ‘meetings with Epstein’s counsel. Menchel, similarly,
told OPR that hecould not remember anything specific: aboutthe meeting.
