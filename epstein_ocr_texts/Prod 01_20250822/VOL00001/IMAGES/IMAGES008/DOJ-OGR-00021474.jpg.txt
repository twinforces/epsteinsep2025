argued that Acosta should have been able to: rely. on his staff:to accomplish.the victim notification.
task; aid ‘thus. had no responsibility to personally confirm ‘that: ‘Chief, Reiter would. notify the
victims of the. hearing.*° Acosta is correct that under usual circumstances,, USAO’ management
played. no role in ‘the victim notification process; however; it this case, the issue of victim.
notification had been elevated. fronv‘a rote administrative task to a major area of dispute with the:
defense. Acosta personally ifivolved. himself by resolving the, notification dispute with defense
counsel in. his December 1.9, 2007 letter. Villafaria provided Acosta witha draft letter to state
officials that would have opened a’dialogue:concerning the notification.ofiall.the:victims identified.
in the: federal investigation. OPR found no evidence, however, that Acosta sent the letter-or any
similar communication. to: the State Attorney’s Office or that he provided Villafatia and Sloman
with instructions conceriing ‘victim, notification other than, those contained. in his December: 19,
2007 letter: Having inserted himself into; the notification process, Acosta had.a responsibility:to
ensure that: his expectation that, the victinis would be ‘notified. could be accomplished, through the
state process.

Many victims only learned. of Epstein’s. state: court pleas when they later received a letter
from-the USAO ‘informing them that those:pleas had:resolved ‘the: federal investigation, and some:
victims only learned of; the state court pleas and sentencing from the news media. In the end,
although. Villafana and Sloman. hastily: .attempted.'to ensure: victim ‘notification ‘through Chief.
Reiter, their effort’ was too little and too late to ensure that victims Had the oppor tunity to ‘attend
theplea hearing or-were given. sufficient information about its significance to their own. cases.7””
Although Acosta may have:conferred with others about-the decision to defer the responsibility for
notifying: victims:to the State Attorney, Acosta was responsible for choosing this course of action.
OPR conéludes'thaturidér these unique citcuinstaiices, its criticisms are warranted because Acosta,
personally. decided to change the process: initiated by ‘his staff, and. although he expected that the:
federal Victims would beé-notified, he. did not take'the nécésSary'steps to enstite that’ they would.be.
Acosta could. have authorized disclosure of the. plea. hearing to victims, even if he did not believe:
the CVRA required it, to chsure that the'victims identified in-the federal investigation were aware:
of the:state court’ ‘proceeding. Because the state pleas ended the federal investigation into Epstein’s
conduct, ensuring ‘that:'the victims, were ‘notified. of ‘the. state plea hearing. would. have been
consistent. with the: Department’s overarching commitment to treat victims with. fairness, dignity,
and sensitivity:, Acosta’s failure'to prioritize notification and.coordinate:communication.about.the
