1 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Yes.
2 TODD BLANCHE: Full stop. Okay. Which
3 means, the way that I'm defining abuse, as has been
4 widely reported, is that -- that he would cause young
5 women in high school to be recruited to come to his
6 house and give him massages. And a part of -- and
7 the -- and the -- and as part of that, he would
8 sexually abuse them, okay?
9 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Yes.
10 TODD BLANCHE: So I want to talk about
11 that. But as it relates to blackmail, the question
12 is whether you're aware of any time, that any of the
13 individuals we're talking about, and we'll talk about
14 others, received massages from women who were under
15 18 or may have been under 18.
16 And that whether there was any sexual
17 assaults or sexual contact between any of these
18 people and those masseuses, which would've allowed
19 then, Mr. Epstein, potentially, to blackmail them and
20 say, "You have to continue to work with me or you
21 have to give me money, or else I'm going to tell the
22 world that -- that -- that you did this."
23 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Right. I -- I think
24 this is a really good place to start with how this
25 story began.
