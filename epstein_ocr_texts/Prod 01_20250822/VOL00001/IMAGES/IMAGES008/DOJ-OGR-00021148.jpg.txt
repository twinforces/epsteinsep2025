Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page101 of 113
CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, all counts should be vacated and the indictment
dismissed. However, based on the preceding arguments, the Court may determine
that only Counts Three and Four or Three and Six should be reversed. In either
scenario, the Court should order a new trial on the remaining count. This is due to
the prejudice having resulted from the admission of evidence to prove Counts
Three and Four or Three and Six. United States v. Rooney, 37 F.3d 847, 855 (2d
Cir. 1994). In weighing a claim of prejudicial spillover, courts look at several
factors, one being the “similarities and differences” between the evidence on the
reversed counts and the remaining counts. /d. When the evidence admissible to
prove the remaining counts arises from a distinct set of facts in a different time-
period, involving a different complainant and the evidence admissible to prove the
dismissed counts would not have been admissible to prove the remaining count,
courts will find prejudice warranting a new trial on the remaining counts. /d.

Here, Counts Four and Six arise from distinct facts, time-periods, and
complainants. Count Four is based on the testimony of Jane concerning conduct
between 1994 and 1997, while Count Six is based on the testimony of Carolyn
concerning conduct between 2001 and 2004. Plainly, much of the evidence to
prove the dismissed counts would not have been admissible to prove the remaining
