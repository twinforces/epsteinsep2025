As the U.S. Attorney, and in the absence of evidence establishing that his decision was
motivated by improper factors, Acosta had the “plenary authority” under federal law and under the
USAM to resolve the case as he deemed necessary and appropriate. As discussed in detail below,
OPR did not find evidence establishing that Acosta, or the other subjects, were motivated or
influenced by improper considerations. Because no clear and unambiguous standard required
Acosta to indict Epstein on federal charges or prohibited his decision to defer prosecution to the
state, OPR does not find misconduct based on Acosta’s decision to decline to initiate a federal
prosecution of Epstein.

B. No Clear and Unambiguous Standard Precluded Acosta’s Use of a

Non-Prosecution Agreement to Resolve the Federal Investigation of Epstein

OPR found no statute or Department policy that was violated by Acosta’s decision to
resolve the federal investigation of Epstein through a non-prosecution agreement.

The prosecutor’s broad charging discretion includes the option of resolving a case through
a non-prosecution agreement or a related and similar mechanism, a deferred prosecution
agreement. United States v. Fokker Servs. B.V., 818 F.3d 733 (D.C. Cir. 2016). These agreements
“afford a middle-ground option to the prosecution when, for example, it believes that a criminal
conviction may be difficult to obtain or may result in unwanted collateral consequences for a
defendant or third parties, but also believes that the defendant should not evade accountability
altogether.” /d. at 738. As with all prosecutorial charging decisions, the choice to resolve a case
through a non-prosecution agreement or a deferred prosecution agreement “resides fundamentally
with the Executive” branch. /d. at 741.

OPR found no clear and unambiguous standard in the USAM prohibiting the use of a non-
prosecution agreement in the circumstances presented in Epstein’s case. The USAM specifically
authorized and provided guidance regarding non-prosecution agreements or deferred prosecution
agreements made in exchange for a person’s timely cooperation when such cooperation would put
the person in potential criminal jeopardy and when alternatives to full immunity (such as
testimonial immunity) were “impossible or impracticable.” USAM § 9-27.600 (comment).?°° The
“cooperation” contemplated was cooperation in the criminal investigation or prosecution of
another person. In certain circumstances, government attorneys were required to obtain approval
from the appropriate Assistant Attorney General before entering into a non-prosecution agreement
in exchange for cooperation.

Epstein, however, was not providing “cooperation” as contemplated by the USAM, and the
USAM was silent as to whether a prosecutor could use a non-prosecution agreement in
circumstances other than in exchange for cooperation in the investigation or prosecution of
another. Notably, although the USAM provided guidance and approval requirements in cases
involving cooperation, the USAM did not prohibit the use of a non-prosecution agreement in other
situations. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the USAM did not establish a clear and unambiguous
obligation prohibiting Acosta from ending the federal investigation through a non-prosecution
205 USAM § 9-27.650 required that non-prosecution agreements in exchange for cooperation be fully
memorialized in writing. Although this requirement was not applicable for the reasons given above, the NPA complied
by fully memorializing the terms of the agreement.
