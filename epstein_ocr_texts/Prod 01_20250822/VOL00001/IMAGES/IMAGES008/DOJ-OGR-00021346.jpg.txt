record, no restitution, no sex offender status, publication at a trial of
the names of certain victims that didn’t want their names revealed
and the general difficulties of a trial for the victims and their
families.

Although his emails showed that, at the time, he advocated for prosecution of Epstein,
Lourie told OPR it was also his general recollection that “everybody at the USAO working on the
matter had expressed concerns at various times about the long-term viability of a federal
prosecution of Epstein due to certain factual and legal hurdles, as well as issues with the
cooperation and desires of the victims.”

Similarly, Menchel—who had experience prosecuting sexual assault crimes—recalled
understanding that many of the victims were unwilling to go forward and would have experienced
additional trauma as a result of a trial, and some had made statements exonerating Epstein.
Menchel told OPR he believed that if the USAO had filed the proposed charges against Epstein,
Epstein would have elected to go to trial. In Menchel’s view, the USAO therefore had to weigh
the risk of losing at trial, and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the benefits gained
through a negotiated result, which ensured that Epstein served time in jail, registered as a sexual
offender, and made restitution to his victims.

Sloman also recalled witness challenges and concerns about the viability of the
government’s legal theories. He told OPR:

[I]t seemed to me you had a tranche of witnesses who were not going
to be reliable. You had a tranche [of] witnesses who were going to
be severely impeached. People who loved Jeffrey Epstein who
thought he was a Svengali... who were going to say I told him I
was 18 years old.

You had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light
being shown on them because their parents didn’t even know -- had
very vulnerable victims. You had all of these concerns.

Acosta told OPR that he recalled discussions with his senior managers about the victims’
general credibility and reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of the case, all of which
factored into the resolution. He acknowledged that his understanding of the facts was not
“oranular” and did not encompass a detailed understanding of each victim’s expected testimony,
but he trusted that his “team” had already “done the diligence necessary” to make
recommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled discussing the facts
with Sloman and Menchel, and possibly Lourie, none of whom had as detailed an understanding
of the facts as Villafafia. Nevertheless, OPR credits Acosta’s statement that he reasonably
believed, based on his conversations with others who expressed this view, that a trial would pose
significant evidentiary challenges.

Other witnesses corroborated the subjects’ testimony regarding witness challenges,
including the FBI co-case agent, who recalled during his OPR interview that some of the victims
had expressed concern for their safety and ‘“‘a lot of them d[id]n’t want to take the stand, and
