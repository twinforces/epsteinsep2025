the Hames of certain. victinis that; didn’t want. theit names revealed,
and the ‘general difficulties of a trial for the victims ‘and their
families. —

Although his. emails showed that, at. the: time, he advocated -for prosecution of Epstein,
Lourie‘told OPR ‘it was also his general recollection that “ev erybody: atthe USAO' working on the
matter had expressed ‘concerns at various times about the long-term. viability of a federal.
prosecution of Epstcin duc to certain factual and, legal hurdles, as well, ‘as issues’ with, the
cooperation:and desires of:the victims.”

Similarly, ‘Menchel—who -had .experience.'prosecuting sexual. assault ‘crimes—recalled.
understanding thatsmany ofthe victims were -unwilling'to go forward.and would have:experienced,
additional, ‘trauma as a result of, a ‘trial, and some had made: statentents exonerating Epstein.
Menchel told OPR he: believed. that if the USAO had filed. the proposed. charges. against: Epstein,
Epstein, would. have elected, to go to trial. In Menchel,s view, the USAO: therefore had to weigh,
the: risk. of losing. at ‘trial,.:and thereby re-traumatizing the victims, against the. benefits gained
through a. negotiated. result, which ensured-that: Epstein served. time in jail, registered. asa sexual.
offender, and made restitution to his victims..

‘Sloman also recalled. witness challenges and ‘concerns about the: viability of the:
government’s legal theories. He told OPR:

[I]t seemed to:me:you had.a tranche ofwitnesses‘who were:not. going
to be reliablé. You had a;tranche: [of] witnesses who were going’to
be severely impeached. People who. loved Jeffrey Epstein who
thought he was a Svengali... . who, were, going-to say [told him I
was.18: years old.

You had witnesses who were scared to death of the public light.
‘being shown. on-them-.because'their parents didn’t.even.know: -- had
very vulnerable victims. You had, all of these concerns.

Acosta;told OPR, that; he recalled discussions: with his: senior managers about the victiins’
general credibility and:reluctance to testify and the evidentiary strength of. the case, all. of which.
factored, into, the resolution. He acknowledged that his ‘understanding of the facts was not.

“granular” and. did-not. encompass a detailed. under standing, of cach: vietim’s expected testimony,
but he trusted that his “team” had. already “done the diligence necessary” to make
recommendations about the evidentiary strength of the case. Acosta recalled. discussing the facts
with, Sloman. and. Menchel, and Possibly: Lourie, none. of whom had as detailed an nunder rstanding,
of the facts as Villafana.
believed, ‘based on his conversations ‘with others who o:cxpressed th this view, ‘that a 1 trial would pose
significant, evidentiary: challenges.
