to be paid to the FBI’s communications to ensure ‘that the victims ‘were receiving accurate and
timely information that was consistent with the status of ‘the case and, with the USAO’s
communications with victims.44”

The-decision‘not.to inform victims and their attorneys about the existence-of the NPA gave
victims and the publie‘the:misimpression that the government had colluded with Epstein’s counsel
to keep the agreement secret frony the victims.. Moreover, the lack of openness about. the NPA
gave the impression. that the USAO lacked sensitivity. for the victims in resolving the matter and
undereut:public confidence in the legitimacy of the:resulting plea, agreement. The overall resultof
the: subjects?” anomalous handling of this: case left at least:some of the:victims: fecling ignored and
frustrated, failed ‘to promote their healing: process; and resulted, in extensive public criticism.
Although OPR. credits: Villafafia’s statements that she wanted to go beyond her’ obligations in
dealing with victitns, the end result nonetheless was that communications with victiins were not
prioritized.by the USAO. In ‘part this was due‘to the fact: that-interactions with victims are generally
handled by staff in the, USAO afd the EBI who are trained. and have expertise if, dealing with
victims and. other witnesses. However, decisions ‘made by Acosta, Sloman, ‘and Villafana also
contributed tothe problems. The government, as it.ultimately acknowledged. in. the CVRA
fashion.

OPR recognizes: that the Epstein. investigation occurred soon after the: passage: of the
CVRA, Ih-the'years since, the Department’s prosccutors.and personnel have become-more familiar
with.its provisions. OPR.cncourages the Department.as a whole to take:the issues.discussed‘above
{nto account when providing training and, direction 'to its, employees. fegarding Victims’ rights to
ensure. ‘that: in. the: future, Department. attorneys’ actions promote victim ‘inclusion, whenever
possible.*** ‘For example, although the division-of responsibility. between-the FBI and the USAO
for communicating with victims works efficiently and-appropriately in.the:average‘case, the USAO
failed. to consider that in.a case involving.a pre-charge disposition, the victims were receiving,
inconsistent and confusing communications’ fromthe separate entities. In certain cases,.such as the
Epstein case, ‘prosecutors may. need ‘to provide more ‘oversight when. multiple: Department:
coinponents ate communicating with victims to avoid. providing confusing and. contradictory
messages.

independent of the, NPA ‘provision. OPR. also notes that impeachment regarding ‘the NPA, provision may’ have
permitted:the. government 'to rehabilitate the:victims:through their priof statementsto.law enforcement. In other:words,.
while the USAO's viewconeerning potential impeachment-was not unreasonable, more extensive consideration-of the:
‘case agent’s concerms ‘might have Jed. the ‘prosecutors to conclude. that: the ‘risk of the: ‘information being; used to
significantly: damage the credibility: of the victims was ‘low,

ca In-addition tothe, EBL letters previously discussed, ‘another example ofthe, inconsistent communication ‘can
be Seenii- letters that:were'to. be.sent atter Epsi¢in.cntered his guillyplea-to two-victimsresiding in foreien-countries.
Although OPR, was unable fo ‘confirm that ‘the-two victims, actually received the. letters. appears from the records,
OPR-reviewed thatthe government intended.to provide'them with'a‘standard-EBLletter stating’ that the-case was.under’
‘investigation while:also- ‘providing them-with,a USAQ letter stating’that the case had-been.resolyed’ through, Epstein’: s
