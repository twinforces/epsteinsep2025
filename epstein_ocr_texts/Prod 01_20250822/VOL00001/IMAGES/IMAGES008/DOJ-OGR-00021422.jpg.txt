The FBI case agent informed Villafafia that the Victim Specialist sent the letters and would follow
up with a phone call “to offer assistance and ensure that [the victims] have received their letter.”
A sample letter is shown on the following pages.

Villafafia told OPR that she did not recall discussing the content of the letters at the time
they were sent to the victims, or reviewing the letters until they were collected for the CVRA
litigation, sometime after July 2008. Rather, according to Villafafia, “The decision to issue the
letter and the wording of those letters were exclusively FBI decisions.” Nevertheless, Villafafia
asserted to OPR that from her perspective, the language regarding the ongoing investigation “was
absolutely true and, despite being fully advised of our ongoing investigative activities, no one in
my supervisory chain ever told me that the case was not under investigation.” Villafafia identified
various investigative activities in which she engaged from “September 2007 until the end of June
2008,” such as collecting and reviewing evidence; interviewing new victims; re-interviewing
victims; identifying new charges; developing new charging strategies; drafting supplemental
prosecution memoranda; revising the charging package; and preparing to file charges. Similarly,
the FBI case agent told OPR that at the time the letters were sent the “case was never closed and
the investigation was continuing.” The co-case agent stated that the “the case was open... it’s
never been shut down.”

Victim Courtney Wild received one of the January 10, 2008 FBI letters; much later, in the
course of the CVRA litigation, she stated that her “understanding of this letter was that [her] case
was still being investigated and the FBI and prosecutors were moving forward on the Federal
prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against [her].”°??

320 CVRA petitioner Jane Doe #2 also received a January 10, 2008 FBI letter that was sent to her counsel.
