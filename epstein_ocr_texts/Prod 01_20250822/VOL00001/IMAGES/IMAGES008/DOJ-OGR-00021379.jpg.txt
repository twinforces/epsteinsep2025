To be clear, OPR. is not suggesting that prosecutors must. obtain. all, available evidence
before reaching’plea, agreements or" “that: ‘prosecutors Cannot reasonably determine that reaching a:
resolution.is:more’beneficial.than. continuing, to litigate: evidentiary 1 issues.. Every. case is. different
and must be: judged on its. own facts. In, this case, however; , given the unorthodox nature of the
state-based resolution, the-fact. that Acosta’s decision to pursuciit set the case on.a wholly different.
track than whatihad been originally’contemplated by his experienced staff, the nattiré.and scope of:
Epstein’s criminal conduct, the:‘circumstances surrounding, the: removal. of the computers from.
Epstein’s residence, andthe potential:forobtaining evidence revealing;serious additional criminal
‘conduct, Acosta had a responsibility to ensure:that. he was fully informed about.the consequences
of‘pursing the course of action, that he proposed and particularly about the consequences flowing:
from, the express terms of the NPA. In deciding ‘to ‘resolve the case pre-charge, Acosta Jost sight
of the bigger. picture that. the investigation. was. not compieted. and viable leads remained. to ‘be
pursued. The decision to forgo the governnient? s efforts to obtain the computer evidence and.to
pursue: significant investigative steps: should. have been. made only. after careful. consideration of.
all the costs. and benefits of the proposed. action. OPR did not find, évidence that Acosta fully
considered the costs.of ending.the investigation. prematurely.°*°

Cc. OPR Was Unable to Determine the Basis for the Two-Year Term of
Incarceration, That It Was Tied to. Traditional Sentencing Goals, or That It
Satisfied the Federal Interest in the Prosecution

The heart of the: controversy surroinding the Epstein. case, is the. appareiit undwe leniency
afforded him concerning. his sentence. After offering: a deal that required. a “non-negotiable”
24-imonth terin of incarceration, Acosta agreed to resolve it-for an 1 8-imonth term of incarceration,
Knowing that. gain, ‘time would reduce it further, and indeed, Epstein served. only 13 months.
Epstein. ultimately did ‘not, serve, even. that: minimal. sentence. incarcerated on a full-time basis:
sentence. As Lourie told OPR, “[E]verything ¢lse that happened to: [Epstein] is::exactly what:
should have happened. to him... . He had to pay a, lot: of money: He had to register ‘as aScx
offender,” but'in the perfect:world, [Epstein] would:have served more time:in.jail.”

Due to the passage-of time and. the subjects’ inability. to recall many details of the relevant.
events, OPR: ‘was ‘unable to; to develop a clear’ ar understaneing ¢ of how the, original ‘tWO- “years sentence

represented the s sentence the USAO: determined: Epstein w swould be: orwilling, f to accept, thus a av voiding
the:need. for a‘trial. As to the former possibility,, Acosta’told OPR.that-his “best understanding” of,
the:two-year proposal was; that it:correlated:to “one ofthe original, state charges.” He elaborated,

ms Incommenting-on:OPR*s dratt: report, .Acosla*s attorney: objected; to OPR’s conclusion that:Acosta‘knew: or
should have:knowar about the. litigation regarding, the. computers and that he should have given greater consideration

that:level of “granularity”; that his “small thoughts* edits? onthe: NPA were, limited-and.focused,on policy; and that:
‘it was'appropriaté.tor-hi to rely.or-his staff to-raise any issues-of Concern to-hitn. For the reasons statédabove, OPR.
nonetheless: concludes, that: having developed. a. unique resolution to a. federal, investigation, Acosta had. a. greater
