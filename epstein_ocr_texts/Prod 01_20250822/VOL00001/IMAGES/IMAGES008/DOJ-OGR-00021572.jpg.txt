1 submission about the Court has to consider the weight and

2 reliability of the evidence when determining a factor -—- a

3 sentencing factor that is going to increase the guidelines,

4 especially by the amount that this is going to increase it by.
5 And this one uncorroborated, unadmitted, unreliable message pad
6 is not sufficient for that purpose. So if we're relying on a

7 factual record argument, there is not enough of evidence in the
8 record to support that the conspiracy ended in November or

g December of 2004. Therefore, the 2003 guidelines must apply.
10 THE COURT: Okay. I have a question about the

11 leadership enhancement, as I said, but anything else you want
12 to raise that you didn't have the opportunity to raise in your
LS papers, Mr. Everdell?

14 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, just one point about that
15 same book issue. I think there was a section of the

16 government's brief where they were trying to show -—- this was
17 the point about the Court's discretion. We argued the Court

18 has discretion to sentence as if it were the 2003 guidelines.
19 I realize that might not be where the Court is headed, but I
20 would point out —-
21 THE COURT: You mean aS a variance argument.
22 MR. EVERDELL: Exactly. In that section, the
23 government made reference to an argument that the defendant was
24 receiving money into the 2007 time period. I believe they
25 pointed to $7 million. I think that is an extreme stretch,
