Case 22-1426, Document 98,_02/28/2023, 3475901, Paged of 221

LCKVMAX8 Charge

1 accident, mistake, or some innocent reason.

2 It is the defendant's intent that matters here. If

3 the government establishes each of the elements of the crime

4 beyond a reasonable doubt, then the defendant is guilty of this
2) charge whether or not the individual agreed or consented to

6 cross state lines.

7 Instruction No. 21. Count Four. Transportation of an
8 individual under the age of 17 to engage in illegal sexual

9 activity. Second element.

10 The second element of Count Four which the government
11 must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that Ms. Maxwell

12 knowingly transported Jane in interstate commerce with the

13 intent that Jane engage in sexual activity for which any person
14 can be charged with a criminal offense in violation of New York
15 law.

16 Like Count Two, Count Four alleges sexual activity for
17 which an individual could be charged with a violation of New

18 York Penal Law, Section 130.55, sexual abuse in the third

19 degree. I've already instructed you regarding that crime, and
20 those instructions apply equally here.
21 In order to establish this element, it's not necessary
22 for the government to prove that the illegal sexual activity
23 was Ms. Maxwell's sole purpose for transporting Jane across
24 state lines. A person may have several different purposes or
25 motives for such conduct, and each may prompt in varying degree
