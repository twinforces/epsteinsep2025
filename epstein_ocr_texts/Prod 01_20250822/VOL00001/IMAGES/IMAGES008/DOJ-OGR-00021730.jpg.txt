B. Applicable Law

“A constructive amendment occurs when the
charge upon ‘which the defendant is.‘tried differs. sig-
nificantly from. the charge upon which the grand jury
voted.” United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th ‘279, 293
(2d Cir. 2021). “Not every alteration of an. indictment,
however, rises to the level of a constructive amend-

the indictment.” United States v. D’Amelio, 693 F.3d
412,.416 (2d Cir. 2012).

Cir. 2019). The “core. of criminality”. is “the essence of
a crime, in general.terms,” but not. ‘the particulars of
how a defendant effected the crime.” D’Amelio, 693
F.3d at 418. There is no constructive amendment.
where the allegations in the indictment:.and the proof.
at trial both relate to a “single set of discrete facts,” or
form * ‘part of a a single ¢ course > of conduct” ‘with the’same:

“A ‘variance o¢curs when 'the chaveine terms of the
indictment.are left unaltered, but the evidence offered
at. trial proves ‘facts materially different. from those
