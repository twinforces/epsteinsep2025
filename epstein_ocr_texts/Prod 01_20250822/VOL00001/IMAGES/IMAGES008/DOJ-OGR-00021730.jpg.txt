B. Applicable Law

“A constructive amendment occurs when the
charge upon which the defendant is tried differs sig-
nificantly from the charge upon which the grand jury
voted.” United States v. Khalupsky, 5 F.4th 279, 293
(2d Cir. 2021). “Not every alteration of an indictment,
however, rises to the level of a constructive amend-
ment.” United States v. Dove, 884 F.3d 138, 146 (2d
Cir. 2018). Instead, “[t]o prevail on a constructive
amendment claim, a defendant must demonstrate that
the terms of an indictment are in effect altered by the
presentation of evidence and jury instructions which
so modify essential elements of the offense that there is
a substantial likelihood that the defendant may have
been convicted of an offense other than that charged in
the indictment.” United States v. D’Amelio, 693 F.3d
412, 416 (2d Cir. 2012).

This Court has “consistently permitted significant
flexibility in proof, provided that the defendant was
given notice of the core of criminality to be proven at
trial.” United States v. Lebedev, 932 F.3d 40, 53 (2d
Cir. 2019). The “core of criminality” is “the essence of
a crime, in general terms,” but not “the particulars of
how a defendant effected the crime.” D’Amelio, 693
F.3d at 418. There is no constructive amendment
where the allegations in the indictment and the proof
at trial both relate to a “single set of discrete facts,” or
form “part of a single course of conduct” with the same
“ultimate purpose.” Jd. at 419-21.

“A variance occurs when the charging terms of the
indictment are left unaltered, but the evidence offered
at trial proves facts materially different from those
