03/10/2022 | 640 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Per the Court's instruction at the March 8 hearing,
the parties submitted revised redactions to their briefing on the Defendants motion for
a new trial. The Court rejects the Defendant's proposed redaction to page 8, lines 6-7
of her reply because it is not necessary to protect any continuing interest in juror
anonymity and privacy. See Dkt. No. 607. The Court concludes that the remaining
proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to further the important interest of protecting
juror anonymity and privacy. Press—Enter. Co. v. Superior Ct. of Cal., Riverside Cnty.,
464 U.S. 501, 511-12 (1984). The parties are ORDERED to file the redacted briefs
(with the above noted line unredacted) on the docket on or before March 11, 2022. The
Court will file the unredacted briefs under seal. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
