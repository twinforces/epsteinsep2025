own investigation, which can't réally fully get started until
we appreciate what information has already been provided,
That'*s really the cGruk of ‘the reason.

Now, I neted in the government's opposition, although
they agree that some adjotirnment is warranted, I guess ‘the
issue is Qf how leng the adjournment should. be. The defense is
‘in, the beSt position to assess how much time we need to perform

QuK important function ‘on behalf of our clients, I say that

because we aré not making a request f6r the purpose of simply
delaying the proceedings. We are doing it because jit is
actually nécessary to accomplish dur goals as counsel.

Also, which I did not reference in my Jetter, is it,
also takés into account my trial schedule, at. least why my
request was. Last week, I was scheduled to start a trial
before Judgé Ramos in 40 Foléy Square in July. And part of
what, I discussed with Judge Ramos. in setting that trial date
was tHat I knéw that this trial may need to be accommodated if
some way. He selected July 20 for that date mostly because of
the céurt.'s availability at tHat time. That's also part 6f the
reason. And in that, partaculan case, my client's been,
incarcerated for almost two years. He is facing a mandatory
life sentence. So I do need to spend some of my time getting
ready for that. as well, and I. expect that to be our trial date.

THE COURT: What,'s the date?

MR. EOY: What's the date?
