1. The report of the Inspector General, as to both defendants, inchiding, aity
and all supporting memiorandinns, written,statements, photos, videos, and
incident reports

The defendant is entitled to complete disclosure. of thé Inspector General’s report.
Moreover, Mr. Thomas'has a right to any and. all information obtained in this investigation. Not
only is it possible that this report: contains ‘additional. witness statements but this report. also has:
information that has not been fumished by the government in any capacity previously. Moreover,
While the government would like to limit its discovery obligation to reports, videos: and
documents related. spécifically to: night and early Tmorning hours of August: 10, 2019, the defense
submits that there is a much larger context. that lead to those events and. the charges against
Michael Thomas. Indeed, the Attorney General of the United States and ‘the “acting”
commnissioner of'the BOP: opened. an investigation that‘was precipitated by the events of August
10, 2019 but said investigation was much more expansive and in-depth. In November 2019, the
“acting” commissioner Kathleen Hawks Sawyer statcd at a Congressional.hearing under oath that
there were more than 3300 vacancies within the BOP and she was surprised that the BOP. was
able to ‘fufiction with such issues: She went on to ‘state that: “The vast: majority.of state are good,
hardworking employees, “but they are tired because they are stretcned.” (See article attached as
Exhibit E.) The broad depth of the Inspector Genezal’s report presumably: was that’ there were a
myriad, of systematic ‘issues affecting the BOP that allowed the events of August 10, 2019 and
the death of.Jeffrey Epstein to occur: Accordingly, the defendant is entitled, to disclosure of aiy
and all of this information, especially if it relates to his defense of the charges that. have been
initiated. It is'the:defendant’s contention that this report may also contain Brady-Giglio: matetial.
Indeed, ‘the prosecutors in this case may be:denying the defendant -his right to this material
without any knowledge of its contents. If so, this is a dereliction of their duty and denies. Mr.

Thomas important rights that are the foundation.of our judicial system:
