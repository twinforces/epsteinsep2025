1 high likelihood that I'm going to file a motion to dismiss the
2 indictment based on selective prosecution. I do believe that

i) if certain portions of that motion are granted, then that's

4 going to entitle the defense to additional discovery that we

5 haven't even received yet.

6 So with the request that we are asking for, we are

7 also having an opportunity to kind of see -- I know kind of the
8 things that are going to happen or potentially will happen, so
9 instead of just trying to come back here three or four times to
10 say this is happening, we can kind of just do this now and

11 realize that that motion will probably be filed. That may

12 create other issues with respect to discovery.

13 Also, your Honor, I have also made a specific request
14 under Rule 16 that the defense wants whatever investigation was
15 done and whatever information there is that is discoverable

16 with respect to the Inspector General's report. It is my

17 position that we are entitled to that information. It is an

18 investigation of the same incident. It is an investigation of
19 the circumstances with which my client is being charged. With
20 that being said, I do think that we are entitled to whatever
21 information was generated in those reports, so I believe that
22 also is going to cause a delay in the trial wherever we go with
23 that issue.
24 THE COURT: We already addressed that the last time.
