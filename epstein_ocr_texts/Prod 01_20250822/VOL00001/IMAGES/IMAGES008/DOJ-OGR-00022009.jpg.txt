high likelihood that I'm going to file a motion to dismiss ‘the
indictment. based en selective prosecution. I do believe that
if certain portions of that motion are granted, then that's

going to entitle the defense to additional discovery that we

haven't even received 'yet.

So with the request that we are asking for, we ane
also having’ ah opporttnity to kind of seé -- I know kind of the
things that are going to happen or potentially will happen, se
instead of just trying to come back here three or four tames to
say this is happening, we can kind of just do ‘this now and
realize that that. fotion will probably be filed. That may
create other issues with respect, to discovery.

Also, your H6nor, I Rave also made a specific request
under Rule 16 that the defense wants whatever investigation was
d6éne and whatéver infé6rmation there is that is discoverable
with respect to the Inspector General's report. It is my
positioh that. we are entitled to that infdérmation. It is an
investigation of the same incident. It iS an investigation of
the circumstances with which my client is being charged. With
that, being said, I do think that. we ane entitled to whatever
information was generated in those reports, so I believe that.
also 18 going to cause a delay in ‘the trial wherever we go with
that issue.

THE COURT: We already addressed that the last time.
