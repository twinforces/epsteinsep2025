to the assault charge” and suggesting a different factual scenario to support a federal charge.!'? At
this point, Sloman left on vacation, and he informed Acosta and Villafafia that in his absence
Lourie had agreed “to help finalize this.” Lourie spent the following work week at his new post
at the Department in Washington, D.C., but communicated with his USAO colleagues by phone
and email.

In a Sunday, September 16, 2007 email, Villafafia informed Lefkowitz that she had drafted
a factual proffer to accompany a revised “hybrid” federal plea proposal. In that email, Villafafia
also noted that she was considering filing charges in the federal district court in Miami, “which
will hopefully cut the press coverage significantly.” This email received considerable attention 12
years later when it was made public during the CVRA litigation and was viewed as evidence of
the USAO’s efforts to conceal the NPA from the victims. Villafafia, however, explained to OPR
that she was concerned that news media coverage would violate the victims’ privacy. She told
OPR, “[I]f [the victims] wanted to attend [the plea hearing], I wanted them to be able to go into
the courthouse without their faces being splashed all over the newspaper,” and that such publicity
was less likely to happen in Miami, where the press “in general does not care about what happens
in Palm Beach.”

Lefkowitz responded to Villafafia with a revised version of her latest proposed “hybrid”
plea agreement, in a document entitled “Agreement.” Significantly, this defense proposal
introduced two new provisions. The first related to four female assistants who had allegedly
facilitated Epstein in his criminal scheme. The defense sought a government promise not to
prosecute them, as well as certain other unnamed Epstein employees, and a promise to forego
immigration proceedings against two of the female assistants:

Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also

precludes the initiation of any and all criminal charges which might

otherwise in the future be brought against [four named female

assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-owned corporate

entity] for any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal

investigation . . . . Further, no immigration proceeding will be

instituted against [two named female assistants] as a result of the

ongoing investigation.

The second new provision related to the USAO’s efforts to obtain Epstein’s computers:

Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement

resolves any and all outstanding [legal process] that have requested

witness testimony and/or the production of documents and/or

computers in relation to the investigation that is the subject of the

Agreement. Each [legal process] will be withdrawn upon the

execution of the Agreement and will not be re-issued absent reliable
M2 Villafafia told OPR that she sometimes used her home email account because “[n]egotiations were occurring
at nights, on weekend[s], and while I was [away from the office for personal reasons], . . . and this occurred during a
time when out of office access to email was very limited.” Records show her supervisors were aware that at times she
used her personal email account in communicating with defense counsel in this case.
