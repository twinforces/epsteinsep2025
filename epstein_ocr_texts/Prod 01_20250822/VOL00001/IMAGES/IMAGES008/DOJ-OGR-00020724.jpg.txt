possible but no later than midnight tonight, June 26, 2022. SO ORDERED. (Signed by

06/27/2022 686 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court has now received and docketed the full set
of submissions related to victim impact statements that were filed in accordance with this
Court's prior order. Dkt. No. 668. The Court received statements from Annie Farmer,
Kate, Virginia Giuffre, Maria Farmer, Sarah Ransome, Teresa Helm, Juliette Bryant, and
Elizabeth Stein. As indicated in its prior order, the Court will exercise its discretion to
permit all of these individuals to be heard in writing. Dkt. No. 682. The Court also denied
the Defendants redaction requests. Id. All unredacted statements are now part of the
record. Dkt. Nos. 674, 675-1. Also as previously indicated in its order, the Court will
permit Annie Farmer, Kate, and Virginia Giuffre to make an oral statement at sentencing
if they wish to do so. Dkt. No. 682. Further, having now reviewed the full set of requests,
and having heard from the Government that it does not object, Dkt. No. 678, the Court
deems it feasible to exercise its discretion to permit the remaining individuals who seek
to themselves make an oral statement at sentencing to do so. They are: Teresa Helm,
Sarah Ransome, and Elizabeth Stein. In order to feasibly accomplish this in light of the
anticipated length of the sentencing proceeding, while ensuring fairness and avoiding
delay of sentencing, each individual speaking orally may read a shortened version of their
previously submitted written statement. The Court deems counsel for the individuals to
be responsible for ensuring that anticipated statements conform to this requirement. The
Government shall promptly provide copies of this order to counsel for the eight
individuals who submitted statements. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
