Case 22-1426, Document 3-2, 07/08/2022, 3344434, Page80 of 92

01/26/2022 | 585 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of Defendant's motion for a
new trial and accompanying exhibits, which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt.
No. 580. The Court has also received requests from media organizations to unseal the
motion. The Court is aware there is substantial public interest in this matter and will
ensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully safeguarded. At the
same time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in considering
these sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process
going forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the
Defendant's and the Government's, interest. Accordingly, to the extent the Defense
requests that arguments in favor of sealing should themselves be sealed, that request is
DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in such a way so as not to
undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first instance. The
Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a letter on the public docket on or before
February 1, 2022, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three—part test
in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The
Government may file on ECF a response to the Defenses justification letter on or
before February 4, 2022. The Government's opposition to the Defenses new trial
motion is due February 2, 2022. Dkt. No. 571. Per the established practice in this case,
the Government must provide a copy via email to the Defense to allow the Defense the
opportunity to propose narrowly tailored redactions and/or sealing. If either party
proposes redactions to or sealing of the Government's anticipated opposition, a letter
justifying such redactions or sealing must be filed on the public docket. The Defense
letter must be filed on or before February 8, 2022, and the Government letter must be
filed by February 11, 2022. The same process will apply for any Defense reply in
support, which is due February 9, 2022. Dkt. No. 571. If redactions or sealing are
proposed, the Defense letter justifying such requests would be due February 15, 2022,
and the Government letter would be due February 18, 2022. The parties are
FURTHER ORDERED to address the New York Times Company's motion to unseal
the filled—out questionnaires for the twelve seated jurors. See Dkt. No. 583. Letters by
both parties must be submitted via ECF on or before February 11, 2022. SO
