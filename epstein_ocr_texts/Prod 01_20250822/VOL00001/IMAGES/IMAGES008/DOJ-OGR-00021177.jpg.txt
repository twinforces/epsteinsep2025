EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The. Department of Justice (Department) Office: of Professional Responsibility. (ORR)
investigated allegations that: in 2007- 2008, Prosecutors in the | U. S. Attomey’s Ss: Office: f for the
conduct of Jeffrey Epstein by. negotiating and executing a federal non- prosecution agreement
(NPA). The NPA sas intended to: rend a federal inv estigation: ‘into allegations 1 that Epstein. engaged
‘in illegal:sexual activity with girls.! OPR also investigated whether USAO prosecutors committed
professional misconduct: by: failing'to consult with victims of Epstein’ s.crimes before'the NPA was
signed or by: misleading victims regarding, the status of-the federal investigation after the signing.

The:Palm. Beach (Florida) Police Department (PBPD) began investigating Jeffrey. Epstein.
in 2005, after the parents of'a 14-year-old girl complained that. Epstein. had paid her for‘a; smassage.
Epstein was: a multi-millionaire financier with residences in Palm. Beach, New York City, and
other’ United States and:forcign locations. The investigation led to'the discovery that.Epstein used
personal. assistants to recruit girls. to provide massages to him, and.‘in. many ‘instances, those:
massages led :to sexual activity. After'the PBPD brotght-the case;to'the State Attorney’s Office, a
Palm Beach County, grand. jury. indicted Epstein, on July 19, 2006, for felony solicitation. of:
prostitution in violation of Flor ida Statute § 796.07. However, because the. PBPD: Chief'and the
lead Detective: were dissatistied. withthe State Attorney’s handling of the ‘case and believed ‘that.
the: state grand jury’s charge ‘did not address ‘the totality of Epstein?s conduct, they. referred. the:
matter ‘to: the Federal, Bureau of Investigation. (FBI) in. West Palm Beach for a-possible federal.
‘investigation.

The: EBI brought the matter to:an Assistant.U.S. Attorney (AUSA), who.opened.a file with.
her Supervisor’s, approval and. with the. knowledge of then U:S. Attorney’ R. Alexander Acosta.
She worked with two FBI case: agents to develop a federal.case: against-Epstein: and, in the ‘course:
of the investigation, they. discovered additional-victims. ‘In. May. 2007, the AUSA: submitted to her
supervisors a draft 60-count ‘indictment outlining, charges against Epstein. She'also provided a.
Jengthy:memorandum summarizing the evidence: she: had assembled.in support, of:the charges and.
addressing the legal issues related'to the proposed charges.

For séveral weeks following submission. of the prosécution memorandum. and proposed.
indictment, the AUSA’s ‘supervisors reviewed the. case to determine: how to proceed. At. a
July 31, 2007 mecting with Epstcin’s attorneys, the USAO offered to, end. its investigation if
Epstein. ‘pled guilty to ‘state charges, ‘agreed to serve a minimum, of two: years” incarceration,
registered .as.a sexual offender, and agreed to .a. mechanism through which victims could. obtain
monetary. damages. ‘The: USAO. subsequently. engaged in-additional ‘meetings and-communications
with:Epstein’s team ofiattorneys, ultimately negotiating the terms of a state-based resolution.of the:

federal i investigation, which, culminated. in the signing of, the NPA on September 24, 2007... The

‘ Asusedin.this Report, incltding in qtioted documents and.statements, the word “girls” refers to-femalés who-
were under the age of 18 at-the time-of the alleged:conduct: Under Florida law;,a minor, is.a person under the age:
of 18.
