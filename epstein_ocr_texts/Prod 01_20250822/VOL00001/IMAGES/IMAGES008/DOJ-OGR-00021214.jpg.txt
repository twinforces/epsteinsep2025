B. The State Attorney’s Officé Decides to Present the Casé-toia State Grand Jury:

State Attorney Barry Krischer explained to OPRthat’the Epstein, case was unusual. in ‘that.
police’brought;the case to his office-without: having made an arrest. Krischer-was unfamiliar with
Epstein, and the case. was assigned. to the: Crimes Against.Children Unit. PBPD Chief Michael.
Reiter stated.in:a:2009 civil deposition that when the PBPD initially brought the case to the: State
Attorney’ s Office in, 2005, Krischer was ‘supportive of the investigation and'told Reiter, “Let's. go
for it;” because, given. the nature: of the allegations, Epstein. was “somebody. we. have’ to. stop.”
Krischer ‘told. OPR, howéver, that both’the detectives and the prosecutors’ came'to recognize that:
“there:were witness problems.”

Assistant. State: Attorney and.Crimes Against. Children Unit Chief, Lanna. Belohlavek told.
OPR that she and. an experienced Assistant: State: Attorney who ‘initially worked:with her on the:
case “were at.a disagreement” with, the PBPD “over what the’ state... . could ethically charge.”
According‘to Belohlavek, she: did:not believe the evidence'the police presented would satisfy. the
elements of: proof required to char ge Epstein with the two felony. crimes the police wanted filed,
unlawful. sexual activity with :a minor (Florida Statute § 794: 05(1)) and. lewd. and lascivious
molestation ofa minor (Florida, Statute § 800.04(5)), arid the police * “were ‘not happy’ with that.”*
Tn. addition, victims had given..contr adictory: statements to police, and. the: original complainant,
who could have supported a charge requiring sexual, offender registration, recanted her allegation.
ofsexual contact. Belohlavek offered Epstein.a resolution that.would result in.a five- year term of
probation, which he tejected.”

‘Records publicly released ‘by the State Attorney’s; Office show: that, beginning, in early
2006, attorneys for Epstein, sought to persuade’ the state prosecutors’ to allow Epstein to plead “n
contest” rather than ‘guilty. To that end, the. defense team aggressively: investigated victims and
presented the State Attorney’ 's Office with voluminous inaterial in ani-cffortto underinite some of
the: victims” credibility, including criminal. records,, victims’ social media postings (such as
MySpace pages) about their own sextial.activity and ditig' lise, and victim statements’ that:appeared.
to undercut allegations of criminal. activity and ‘Epstein’ 's_ knowledge of victims” ages. Krischer
