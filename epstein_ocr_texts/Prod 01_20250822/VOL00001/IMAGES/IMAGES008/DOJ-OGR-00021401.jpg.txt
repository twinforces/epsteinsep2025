to jail. But... . [s]ome of them talked. about bad experiences with

supported.

role was ‘to cvaluate the entire situation, consider the input received from all, of the victims, and
allow the Office.to exercisezits prosecutorial discretion accordingly. 28? She also noted that some.
victims “fear[ed] having their:involvernent with, Epstein revealed.and the negative inpactit would

have.on-their‘relationships with family:members, boyfriends, and others.”

‘interviews conducted. from.2006 to 2008, no victims expressed. a strong opinion ‘that: Epstein. be:
prosecuted.” She further-described'the concerns’ of some of the victims:

Throughout the investigation, we interviewed, many [of Epstein’s]
victims ...... A-majority of the:victims expressed.concern about the
possible disclostire of their identities:to the public. A number of the
