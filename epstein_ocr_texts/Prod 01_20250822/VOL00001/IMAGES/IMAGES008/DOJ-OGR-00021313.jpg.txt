B. Epstein Is Placed-on Work: Release

A few days after Epstein’s guilty. plea, Villafaiia reported ‘to Sloman that Epstein. was
incarcerated at the low-security Stockade, rather than the Main, Detention Center where county
prisoners wereusually housed. Sheralso:told Sloman.that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein.
was cligible for work:release. Although the USAO had made clearthat it expected Epstein to: ‘be
‘incarcerated .24 hours: a day, every day, the. subject of work: release had. not. been. addressed
explicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was. silerit of the issue. Epstein’s
acceptance: into the work. release: prograny as a convicted ‘sexual. offender was seen. by. many as
another spécial benefit: given to Epstein. Because the decision to allow Epstein into; the, work
release:program was made: by the: Palm Beach Sheriff's Office, OPR. did:not. inv estigate: whether
any. state, county, or Sheriff’s. Office rules were: violated. OPR ‘did examine the USAQ’s
consideration of work. release priorto:signing the NPA’and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to
ensure’that: Epstein remained.incarcerated. 24 hours a day.

The. first specific reference to:-work release was: made weeks after’ the NPA. was signed,
when Lefkowitz asserted, if his Octaber 23, 2007 letter to Acosta, that; “so long as Mr. Epsteii’s
sentence does: mot ot explicitly violate: the t terms of ‘the: [NPA] he i Is s entitled to any type of‘sentence:

In.November, 2007, Sloman had. an. exchange of letters with Lefkowitz about the USAO’s
understanding, ‘that: Epstein, had agreed. to serve his full, jail term ‘in, “continuous confinement,”
pointingout that the NPA. “elearly’ ‘indicates that Mr. Epstein is‘to‘be incarcerated.” Sloman.noted
that Florida’s Department of ‘Corréctions’s rules. did not; allow. individuals registered as, Sexual.
offenders to. participate: in. work:release, and thus Epstein. would not be: eligible for a work release
program: Sloman concluded that the USAO* ‘is putting you-on notice that itintends to:make certain,
that Mr. Epstein. is. “treated. no better and. no worse than ‘anyone else? convicted of the same
Offense,” and ‘that if Epstein, were to: be grafted. work release, the USAO would “investigate, the
reasons‘why an. exception. was.granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.”!78

However; also in November,,State Attorney: Krischertold.Sloman that Epstein was,-in.fact,
eligible: to’ ‘petition. for work release because his sexual offender registration. would not take place.
