‘justice. so requires.” Fed. R. Giv.'P. 33(a). Such a motioncis. granted “sparingly and in the most
extraordinary circumstances, and.only in order. to:avert a perceived-miscarriage of justice.”
United States. v. Gramins, 939 F.3d-429, 444 (2d ‘Cir. 20.19) (cleaned up).

B. Noconstructive amendment occurred.

Gount Four charged the Defendant with transportation of an‘individual under the age:of
seventeen with.intent to ‘engage invillegal sexual activity, and Count Three:charged a conspiracy:
todo the same. The:core:of’criminality of these counts, ‘the:parties agree, was a scheme by
‘Epstein: and ‘the: Defendant;to cause underage girls to travel:to New York with:the intent that they
would engage in sexual activity in violation:of.New York law. Gov. Br. at ‘6; Maxwell Br. at 927

‘The: Defendant contends that a.jury note received:during:deliberations revealed ‘that the
jury conv ictedthe’Defendant ‘on.a crime different from:this core of ‘criminality: Namely, the
‘Defendant argues that in convicting her of Count Four, the: J ury. found she-intended:for Janeto
engage in sexualiactivity in-New’Mexico, without finding that she intended for Jane to engage in
sexual activity-in-New York. Maxwell-Reply at 2. She argues: the Court’s decision.to refér the
jury back to the charge‘and refusal to givea supplemental instruction was-error. Asa result of
‘this same error, she says, the jury also improperly convicted her.of Count Three. For the-reasons
that:follow, the Court ‘concludes that thereris notva “substantial likelihood” that the Defendant
‘was “convicted-offan offense other than that charged in the indictment.” D’Amelio,.683 F.3d at:

416 (quoting United.States v. .Mollica, 849 F.2d.723,.729 (2d.Cir. 1988)).

+ ‘The Defendant:also contends that her-conviction-on Count'One was the result: of a constructive amendment.
‘Because. the-Court will'not enter: judgment , on Gount One:per the: ‘partics” consents'the-Gourt:does not address ‘Count
‘One.here. In.any‘event, the’Defendant?s.argumentias'to why os constructively“amended.is, the; same;as'
‘heh argument Three. atid ‘the Court’sanaly siswould be.the Saitic. See Maxwell Br, at"]6.
