that “the federal Grand Jury investigation will be sus-
pended.” (A.178 (emphasis added)). The grand jury in-
vestigation is the one that USAO-SDFL agreed to de-
fer in the same agreement (A.175), and not any poten-
tial federal grand jury investigations in other districts.
Furthermore, the NPA elsewhere refers to the “United
States” on occasions that could only mean the USAO-
SDFL. For instance, the NPA commits the “United
States’—that is, the USAO-SDFL—to providing Ep-
stein with a list of victims. (A.177 (‘The United States
shall provide Epstein’s attorneys with a list of individ-
uals whom it has identified as victims ....”)). Another
provision states that the NPA will not be made part of
the public record and commits “the United States’—
again, the USAO-SDFL—to providing notice to Ep-
stein if it receives a Freedom of Information Act re-
quest requiring disclosure of the agreement. (A.178).
The mere fact that the co-conspirator provision of the
NPA used the phrase “United States” rather than
“U.S. Attorney’s Office” is not evidence that the parties
intended an unusually broad immunity provision. See,
e.g., Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.S.
519, 540 (2013) (‘We are not aware, however, of any
canon of interpretation that forbids interpreting differ-
ent words used in different parts of the same statute
to mean roughly the same thing.”). As Judge Nathan
concluded, given the repeated limitations of the com-
mitments in the NPA to the USAO-SDEL, including
the commitment not to prosecute Epstein, “[i]t is not
plausible ... that the parties intended to drastically
expand the agreement’s scope in the single sentence on
