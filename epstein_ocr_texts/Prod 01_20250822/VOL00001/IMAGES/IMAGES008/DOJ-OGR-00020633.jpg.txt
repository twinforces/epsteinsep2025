MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have

asked forthe Court to enter'a protective order: While'they agree on most of the language,
two areas of ‘dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell-secks language allowing her to
publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken onthe public record to

‘themedia or in:publie fora, or in litigation-relating to. Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.

Second, Ms. Maxwell secks language restricting;potential. Government witnesses and.
their counsel front using discovery materials for any purpose other than, preparing’for the

‘criminal;trial in: this action. The Government:has proposed.contrary language on both:of:

these issues. For, the following reasons, the Court:adopts the Government's proposed.

‘protective order ‘Under Eederal Rule of Criminal Procedure ‘L6(d)C1), "[a]t any time the
‘court;may; ‘for good cause, deny;,.restrict, or defer discovery’orinspection, ‘or grant;other
appropriate relief." The good cause standard"\requires ‘courts to balance! several interests,

includitig whether dissemination of the discov: ety imatérials inflicts hazard 16, others.

whether. the’ imposition of the protective order would prejudice. the defendant," and "the:
public's interest in the information.” United ‘States v: Smith, 985 F. Supp. :2d-506, 522
(S.D.N-Y. 2013). The party secking*to restrict disclosure bears:the burden of showing

good cause. Cf. Gambale:v. Deutsche Bank-AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004). First,
the Court finds that}the Government has met its burden, of showing good eduse with

regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell:to publicly reference‘alleged victims and

witnesses other than, those‘ who have'publicly “identified. themselves in, this litigation, As'a-

general matter, it 18 undisputed that there-is. a strong and specific interest in protecting ‘the.

privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in‘this case that supports. restricting: the

disclosure of theiridentities.. Dkt, No. 29 at 3: (acknowledging. that as a’ baseline the.
‘protective order should ' ‘prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense:counsel, and others on the

defense team-from. disclosing or. disseminating; the identity‘offany: alleged -victim-or

on. the: public record about MS. Maxwell or Jefirey Epstein, because they have voluntarily
chosen. to identify themselves. Butnot all accusations ‘or public statements are equal.

Deeiding'to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is.a-far
‘different matter than simply:making a‘public statement “relating to!’ Ms. Maxwell:or

Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have ‘occurred:decades. ago and.
