07/30/2020 37 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Both parties have
asked for the Court to enter a protective order. While they agree on most of the language,
two areas of dispute have emerged. First, Ms. Maxwell seeks language allowing her to
publicly reference alleged victims or witnesses who have spoken on the public record to
the media or in public fora, or in litigation relating to Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.
Second, Ms. Maxwell seeks language restricting potential Government witnesses and
their counsel from using discovery materials for any purpose other than preparing for the
criminal trial in this action. The Government has proposed contrary language on both of
these issues. For the following reasons, the Court adopts the Government's proposed
protective order Under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(d)(1), "[a]t any time the
court may, for good cause, deny, restrict, or defer discovery or inspection, or grant other
appropriate relief." The good cause standard "requires courts to balance several interests,
including whether dissemination of the discovery materials inflicts hazard to others...
whether the imposition of the protective order would prejudice the defendant,‚Äù and "the
public's interest in the information." United States v. Smith, 985 F. Supp. 2d 506, 522
(S.D.N.Y. 2013). The party seeking to restrict disclosure bears the burden of showing
good cause. Cf. Gambale v. Deutsche Bank AG, 377 F.3d 133, 142 (2d Cir. 2004). First,
the Court finds that the Government has met its burden of showing good cause with
regard to restricting the ability of Ms. Maxwell to publicly reference alleged victims and
witnesses other than those who have publicly identified themselves in this litigation. As a
general matter, it is undisputed that there is a strong and specific interest in protecting the
privacy of alleged victims and witnesses in this case that supports restricting the
disclosure of their identities. Dkt. No. 29 at 3 (acknowledging that as a baseline the
protective order should "prohibit[] Ms. Maxwell, defense counsel, and others on the
defense team from disclosing or disseminating the identity of any alleged victim or
potential witness referenced in the discovery materials"); see also United States v. Corley,
No. 13-cr-48, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 194426, at *11 (S.D.N-Y. Jan. 15, 2016). The
Defense argues this interest is significantly diminished for individuals who have spoken
on the public record about Ms. Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein, because they have voluntarily
chosen to identify themselves. But not all accusations or public statements are equal.
Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal investigation or prosecution is a far
different matter than simply making a public statement "relating to" Ms. Maxwell or
Jeffrey Epstein, particularly since such a statement might have occurred decades ago and
