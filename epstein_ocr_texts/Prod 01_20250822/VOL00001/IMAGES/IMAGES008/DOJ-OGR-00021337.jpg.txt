agreement.that: did.not require Epstein’s: cooperation nor did the USAM. require Acosta to obtain.
Departmental, approval before doing so.

C. The NPA’s Individual Provisions Did Not Violate Any. Clear and
Unambiguous Standards

Although Acosta, as U.S. Attorney, had discretion generally to resolve the case through a,
non-prosccution. agreement that deferred prosecution. to the state, OPR. also considered:whether a
élear' and, unambiguous standard governed any of the individual provisions of the NPA.
Specifically, OPR examined Acosta’s. decision. to permit Epstein to resolve the federal
investigation by pleading guilty to state charges of Solicitation of minors,to engage ih-prostitution
and solicitation to prostitution, with a joint, binding:recommendation for an 1 8-month.sentence of
‘incarceration. Because, as noted. above, OPR. found. no clear guidance: applicable. to non-
prosecution agreements not inv olving cooperation, OPR examined Departmental policies relating
to plea offers to assess the: propriety of the NPA’s charge and sentence ‘requirements. OPR, also:
examined the provision declining to prosecute Epstcin’s unidentified “potential co-conspirators,”
to determine whether that provision violated ‘Departmental. policy regarding grants of immunity.
Finally, OPR. considered whether there was a clear and. unambiguous obligation under the
Department’s: policy regarding the. deportation of criminal aliens, which. would have required
further action.to be taken against-:the two Epstein assistants who were forcign-nationals.

After considering: the applicable tules and. policies, OER. finds that. Acosta’ S decision to
standard rds, and that: Acosta ihad the authority. to: resolve the: federal i inv vestigation through 2 a state: plea
and through, the ‘terms’ that he chose. Accordingly, OPR concludes that Acosta did ‘not commit:
professional. misconduct in developing, negotiating, or ‘approving the NPA, nor did the other:
subjects who implemented.his decisions with:respect to the resolution.”
