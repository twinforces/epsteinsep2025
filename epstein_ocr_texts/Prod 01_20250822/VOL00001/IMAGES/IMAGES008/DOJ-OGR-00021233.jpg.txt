for meetings; was to: cause delay, but “the people in:my- office cither,couldn’t see that: or didn’t:
want to sce that,” perhaps. because of “their lack of experience with these types of cases” ofa,
misguided. belief “that [Epstein’s] attorneys would not engage in this behavior.” Villafafia told
OPR that she “could. not: seem to get: [her supervisors] to understand. the seriousness of Epstein’s
behavior and the: fact'that he was probably continuing.to commit.the: behavior, and that there was
a need to, Move With Aecessary speed.” Nonetheless, Villafana followed the guidance of her
immediate: supervisor and-did not send.the email.

Like Lourie, Menchel told OPR that.he believed meeting with defense counsel was good
practice. Menchel told OPR that he saw: “no downside” to ‘hearing the defense point of ‘view.

Menchel believed itswould be:to the USAO’s advaritagé to leat about such arguments in advance.
Menchel-also told OPR-that he did-not recall Villafatia ew er articulating a concern that Epstein.was
continuing to offend, and in Menchel’s view: Epstein was. “already undera-microscope, at least in
Florida,” and.it';would have been * ‘the:height of stupidity” for Epstein to continue to.offend:in.those:
circumstances.
