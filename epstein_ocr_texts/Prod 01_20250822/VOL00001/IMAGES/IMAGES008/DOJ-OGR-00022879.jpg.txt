1 TODD BLANCHE: Okay.
2 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: And I assumed that
3 they leaked it because where else would it be, if
4 that's what it is. If it's true.
5 TODD BLANCHE: Okay. So I've -- just so I
6 put -- I'll say it to you as I've talked a little bit
7 to your lawyer about it. I said to you yesterday
8 that the purpose of what we did yesterday and today
9 was -- was exactly what we did, which is to have a
10 conversation about Mr. Epstein and about you.
11 And I think it's very challenging to talk
12 about everything we talked about. And, you know, in
13 one and a half days or in just a period of hours. So
14 T'll talk to Mr. Markus about kind of what we're
15 going to do next, if anything.
16 There's no -- and I don't -- I'm not being
17 coy or -- I just -- I don't know yet. I don't know.
18 So we -- I have a lot of -- we have some work to do.
19 We'll do it with your lawyers to the extent we have
20 questions or follow-up.
21 And this has been very helpful. I think
22 it's -- it was you, you know, who kind of said you
23 wanted to talk, but we gladly accepted it. So I do
24 appreciate you being willing to meet with us. And I
25 expect that we'll be in touch soon. All right.
