I. THE CVRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3771

A, History

In December 1982, the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime issued a final report
outlining recommendations for the three branches of government to improve the treatment of crime
victims. The Task Force concluded that victims have been “overlooked, their pleas for justice
have gone unheeded, and their wounds—personal, emotional and financial—have gone
unattended.” Thereafter, the government enacted various laws addressing victims’ roles in the
criminal justice system: the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982, the Victims of Crime Act
of 1984, the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA), the Violent Crime Control and
Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, the
Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997, and the Justice for All Act of 2004.7°!

The CVRA, enacted on October 30, 2004, as part of the Justice for All Act, was designed
to protect crime victims and to make them “full participants in the criminal justice system.”*°” The
CVRA resulted from a multi-year bipartisan effort to approve a proposal for a constitutional
amendment guaranteeing victims’ rights, some of which had previously been codified as a victims’
200 President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime Final Report at ii (Dec. 1982).
