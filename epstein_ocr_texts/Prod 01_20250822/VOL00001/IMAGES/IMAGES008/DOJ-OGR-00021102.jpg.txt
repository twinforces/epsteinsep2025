have total immunity: from federal prosecution. for matters that were the subject of
the: investigation.

D. _AIl counts fall within the scope of the NPA and must be
dismissed.

Given that the NPA. binds the USAO-SDNY, all three remaining counts
must be dismissed, because the ‘plain text of the co-conspirator provision is ‘not
limited to any particular offense or.any time period. A172.

That the co-conspirator immunity provision 1s not limited to the 2006-2007
investigation, or the 2001-2007 timeframe or to prosecution in the SDFL is
reinforced by another provision of the. agreement which reads, in. pertinent ‘part,
that a breach of the agreement, “allows the United States to elect to terminate the
agreement and, fo investigate and prosecute Epstein. and any other individual or
entity for any and all federal offenses. A\72.

In.any, event, at minimum, Counts Three .and.Six must be dismissed because
they indisputably fall within the scope of the NPA even as construed by the

District Court.
