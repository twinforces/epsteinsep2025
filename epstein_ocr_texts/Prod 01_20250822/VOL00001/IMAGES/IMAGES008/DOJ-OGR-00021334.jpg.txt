different points; in time, and. regarding different decisions. Menchel,, for. example, participated in.
forinulating:the USAO’s initial written offerte the.defense, but he had no ifivolverient with actions
or decisions made after August 3, 2007. Sloman. was absent during part of. the most intense:
fiegotiations im September 2007 and did -not. see the final, signed ‘version of the NPA until he
returned.. Villafaria and Lourie’participated in the negotiations, and Lourie: cither made: decisions
during the September 12, 2007 meeting with the defense and, State Attorney's Office, or at- least!
indicated. agreement pending. Acosta’s approval. In. any event, whatever the level of Sloman’s,

Menchel’s, Lourie’s, and. Villafafia’s involvement, theyiacted with the knowledge:and approval of!
Acosta.

Under, OPR’s analytical, framework, an attorney who makes a good. faith attempt. ‘to
ascertain'the obligations and:standards imposed on.the: attorney and to comply with them.in a given
Situation does not corimit professional misconduct. Evidence-that an, attorney made.a good. faith.
attempt'to ascertain and-comply with the obligations and-standards imposed cam include, but is not.
limited t6, the fact ‘that: the attorney’ consulted with a supervisor?’ In this regard, OPR’s.
framework is similar'to a standard. provision. of the professional conduct-rules of most state bars,
which specify. that a subordinate lawyer does ‘not. engage in misconduct, iif that lawyer acts. in
accerdance with, a Supervisory lawyer’s reasonable resolution of an arguable question, of
professional. duty. See, e.g., FRPC 4-5.2(b). Therefore, ‘in. addition. to the fact, that OPR. did. not,
fitid a. violation. :of ‘a clear and unambiguous standard. as discussed. below, OPR. concludes that:
Menchel, Sloman, .Lourie, and. Villafatia ‘did not commit professional misconduct with respect:to
any aspectof' the NPA. because they acted under Acosta’s direction and with his approval.

Il. OPR. FOUND THAT NONE OF THE, SUBJECTS VIOLATED A CLEAR AND

A central issuc‘OPR addressed. in.its | inv estigation relating tothe NPA was whether any of.
the: subjects, in, developing, negotiating, or entering ‘into the NPA, violated any clear and
Unambiguous standard established by tule, regulation, or policy. OPR. does, not-find professional,
misconduct unless‘a‘subject attorney intentionally. or recklessly violated a‘clear and-unambiguous
standard. OPR considéted,three specific aréas: (1) standards.implicated by'the decision to; decline:
a federal court prosecution: (2). standards implicated by ‘the decision, to resolve the federal
investigation through a non-prosecution agreement; and. (3) standards implicated by any of the
NPA’s provisions, including the promise:not to prosecute unidentified third parties. As discussed
below, OPR. concludes that in each area, and in. the absence of evidence’ establishing ‘that his:
decisions were based on. corrupt: or improper ‘influctices,. the U.S, Attorney possessed: broad
discretionary authority‘to proceed as: he: saw fit, authority‘that he could delegate*to subordinates,
anid that: A costa’s' ¢xercise-of his discretionary ‘authority did not breach. any clear and ‘unambiguous
standard. As a result, OPR. concludes: that. none:.of the subject attorneys violated a clear and

a0. ‘The tailure to:fullyadvisea Super visorotrélewant and-material-facts can warrant a finding. thatthe subordinate.

attorney has,not acted in “good ‘faith.’ OPR.did not find evidence supporting such a:conclusion here.-and, Acosta did.
