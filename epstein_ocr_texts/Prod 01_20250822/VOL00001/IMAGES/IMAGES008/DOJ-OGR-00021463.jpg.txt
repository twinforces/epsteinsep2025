require victim approval ofthe prosecutors’ plans, ‘but it allows victims the opportunity: to express
their views and. to. be. heard before a final decision is riade. The lack’ of consultation, inthis case
denied the victims that/opportunity.7”*

After the NPA was ‘signed on September 24, 2007, Villafaiia and the FBI separately
cotimunicated with numerous victitis and victinis’ attorneys, both in person. and through letters.
Apart from three ‘victims: who likely. were informed ‘in October or November 2007 about. a
resolution.ending the federal investigation, victiins were not informed about the NPA oreven more
generally that the USAO had agreed.to end its federal criminal. investigation of Epstein if he pled.
guilty to State. charges until, after Epstein entered. his, guilty plea in June 2008. Despite the
government’s agreement. on: September. 24, 2007, to. end. its federal investigation. upon. Epstein’’s
compliance; with the terms of the NPA, the EBIsent to-victims in October 2007, January. 2008, and.
May :2008.. letters stating that the: case. was “currently under investigation.” In. its ‘February 21,
2019 opinion in-the GVRA case, the district court found. those’ letters “misl[ed] the victims ‘to
belicve that federal prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t was a material omission ‘for
the:Government to suggest'to the'victims.that:they have:patience. relative to. an investigation.about:
which it had. already. bound itselfinot to prosecute.4"

Th, the, discissions throughott this section, OPR. examines the government’s course of:
conduct with victims after the: NPA, was signed. As set forth in the previous subsection, OPR, did.
not find evidence: supporting. a finding that Acosta, Sloman, or Villafaiia acted-with the intent.to
silence victims. Nonetheless, after examining ihe full. scope: and context of the government’ S
interactions with victims, OPR.concludes that the government’s inconsistent.messages concerning,
the federal investigation led to victims feeling confused and, ill-treated by the government.

Tn.this'seetion,‘OPR exaiminés'and discusses’ létters sent-to victims by the EBI that'were the
subject of the district court’s findings. OPR.found no evidence: that Acosta, Sloman, or. Villafafia
was aware-of the content of the letters tntil the USAO received ‘thein from the EBL forproduction
for the CVRA. litigation. OPR. determined that the January 10, 2008 and.May 30, 2008 letters that.
the district court determined to be misleading, as well as ‘the October 12, 2007 letter OPR, located.
during its investigation, were “standard form letter[s]” sent by the FBI’s Victim Specialist. As
noted previously:in:this Report, after'the NPA-was signed, Villafafia and the FBI agents, continued
to conduct their investigation, in anticipation, that Epstein would breach the NPA: absent ‘such a,
