1 MR. EVERDELL: Right?

2 The travel back to a place where she is presumably not
3 engaging in illicit sexual activity, that is not a significant
4 or motivating purpose for that travel.

i) THE COURT: You didn't answer my question.

6 MR. EVERDELL: Maybe I'm confused by the question,

7 your Honor.

8 THE COURT: To be found guilty on this count, must the
9 jury conclude that she aided in the transportation of Jane's

10 flight to New Mexico?

11 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, may I interject myself

12 into this conversation?

13 THE COURT: If you answer the question, I would value
14 it.

15 MS. MENNINGER: I will.

16 It has to be a place for which the travel was a

17 Significant or motivating purpose for illegal sexual activity.
18 In this hypothetical that they've given in this

19 question, they have a comma in two places. The first place
20 they have a comma is after the return flight, comma, but not
21 the flight to New Mexico, where the intent was for Jane to
22 engage in sexual activity, comma. So they have excluded out
23 where they're hypothetically claiming that the flight to New
24 Mexico was the place for which the intent was for Jane to
25 engage in sexual activity.
