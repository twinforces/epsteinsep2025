Government; the BOP was not involved in the strategic decisions; and no BOP personnel
accompanied the prosecution to court proceedings.

Moreover, even if the BOP had conducted a joint investigation with the Government into
the events of August 9 and 10, 2019 (which they did not), Thomas has offered no reason to believe
that most if not all of the records that he seeks—such as records of other instances of BOP
employees failing to conduct rounds and counts—would be part of the BOP’s investigation. There
is simply no basis to seek an order compelling the Government to search for records in the

regarding staffing shortages at the MCC, other instances where BOP employees failed to conduct
required rounds and counts, and disciplinary records for other BOP employees who have at other

Ninth Circuit concluded that the government could not limit its discovery obligations to documents
located in the district of prosecution since the case came out of a single, nationwide IRS
investigation. 868 F.2d 1032, 1035-37 (9th Cir. 1989). In reaching that holding, the Circuit
explained that “a federal prosecutor need not comb the files of every federal agency which might
have documents regarding the defendant” and that Rule 16’s disclosure requirements are cabined
to anything in the possession “of any federal agency participating in the same investigation of the
defendant.” /d. at 1036 (emphasis added). Similarly, in United States v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d
204, 221 (E.D.N.Y. 1999), the court explained, in denying the defendant’s discovery motion, that
“TcJourts have construed the term ‘government’ . . . narrowly to mean the prosecutors in the
particular case or the governmental agencies jointly involved in the prosecution of the defendant,
and not the ‘government’ in general.” And while the court in United States v. Libby, 429 F. Supp.
