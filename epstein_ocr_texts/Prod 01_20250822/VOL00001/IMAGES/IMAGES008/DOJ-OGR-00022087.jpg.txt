Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document35 _ Filed 04/24/20 Page 25 of 34

Government; the BOP ‘was: not involved in the strategic decisions; and. no: ‘BOP ‘personnel
accompanied the prosecution, to .court'procecdings.

Moreover, even if the BOP had. conducted a joint investigation with the Government ‘into
the events of August,9 and. 10, 201.9 (which they did not), Thomas has offered-no reason;to believe
that ‘most if tot all of the records that: he secks—such as records of other’ instances of BOP
employces failing to conduct-rounds.and counts—would.be part of the BOP’s investigation. There
Is simply no ‘basis to seek an, order compelling ‘the Government. 'to’ search. for records. in ‘the:
possession. of the BOP, ‘without any’ tenporal limitation or factual nexus to the charged. case,
regarding’ staffing shortages at‘the MCC, other instances where BOP employees failed-to conduct
required rounds and counts, and disciplinary ‘records for other BOP employces who have’ at other:
times also allegedly-falsificd:records.

The cases Thomas cites do not. support a contrary result. In United States v. Bryan, the
Ninth Circuit concluded.that the government could not.limit.its.discovery obligations to documents
located :in the: district of prosccution ‘since: the case came: ‘out. .of a single, nationwide: IRS
Investigation. 868 F.2d, 1032, 1035-37 (9th Cir. 1989). In reaching that. holding, ‘the Circuit.
explained that “a ‘federal prosecutor need not.comb the files, of every federal agency’which might
have: documents regarding the defendant” and that Rule 116’s disclosure requirements are cabined.
‘to anything in the possession “of any federal agency ‘participating’ in the same. investigation. of the
defendant.” Jd. at 1036 (emphasis added). Similarly,.in United States v. Volpe, 42 F. Supp. 2d
204,221 (E.D.N.Y..1999), the court explained, in denying the defendant’s discovery motion, that.
“{e]ourts have construed the term ‘government’ . . . narrowly to mean the prosecutors in. the:
particular case or the governmental agencies jointly:involved. in. the: prosecution. of the: defendant,

and not the ‘government’ in general.” And while'the court in United Siates'v. Libby, 429 F. Supp.
