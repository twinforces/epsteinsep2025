Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document56 Filed 05/25/21 Page2of5
(5) You shall notify your supervising U.S. Pretrial Services Officer immediately of any
change in your place of residence.
(6) You shall follow your supervising U.S. Pretrial Services Officer’s instructions and
advice.
(7) You shall report to your supervising U.S. Pretrial Services Officer as directed.

As a further condition you hereby consent to disclosure, by any federal, state, or local
government agency, or by any medical or substance abuse treatment provider, to the U.S. Pretrial
Services Officer supervising your case, of such medical and treatment records as may be requested
by the Pretrial Services Officer to evaluate deferral of prosecution in this case. You further agree
that you will execute any additional consent forms that any such agency or provider may require
to release such information.

Special conditions are as follows:

You shall truthfully and completely disclose all information with respect to the activities
of yourself and others related to your employment by the Bureau of Prisons (“BOP”), which
information can be used for any purpose. You shall agree to meet with and be interviewed by the
USAO-SDNY, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, Office of the
Inspector General (“DOJ-OIG”), and any other law enforcement agency designated by this Office.

You shall complete 100 documented hours of community service, preferably related to the
criminal justice system, including working with recently released inmates. The specific type of
community service to be performed must be approved by your Pretrial Services Officer.

The USAO-SDNY may at any time revoke or modify any condition of this provisional
release or change the period of such supervision, which shall in no case exceed six months. The
USAO-SDNY may discharge you from supervision at any time. The USAO-SDNY may at any
time proceed with the prosecution for this offense should the USAO-SDNY, in its sole discretion,
deem such action advisable.

If upon completion of your supervision a written report from your supervising U.S. Pretrial
Services Officer is received to the effect that you have complied with all the rules, regulations and
conditions and special conditions applicable to your deferred prosecution, no further prosecution
will be instituted in this District for the above offenses.

Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to preclude the BOP or the DOJ-OIG from
taking any administrative action against you, including suspension or termination of employment,
based on the facts alleged in the Indictment, the facts identified in the course of the investigation
that led to the Indictment, or your own statements to the DOJ-OIG or any other law enforcement
entity. Nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to require the BOP or the DOJ-OIG to delay

- 2.
