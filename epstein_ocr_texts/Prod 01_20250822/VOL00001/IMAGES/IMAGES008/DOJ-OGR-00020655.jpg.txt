04/19/2021 216 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: In its April 16, 2021 Opinion, the Court denied the
Defendant's motions to dismiss the $1 superseding indictment in whole or in part and
granted the Defendantâ€™ s motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial. Dkt. No.
207. The Court will try the non-perjury counts first. As the Court noted in its Opinion, it
has not yet resolved the Defendant's two motions to suppress evidence. See Dkt. Nos.
133, 139. The Defendant contends in those motions that the Government obtained by
subpoena documents covered by a protective order in violation of her rights against
unreasonable searches and seizures, against self-incrimination, and to due process of law.
The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the
Government knowingly misrepresented facts to procure an order modifying the protective
order. The Court requires information from the Government for scheduling purposes. The
Government is ORDERED to inform the Court by letter docketed on ECF no later than
April 20, 2021, whether it intends to use any of the documents subject to the pending
motions to suppress in the trial of the non-perjury counts in this case. If the Government
does not intend to use any of the documents subject to the pending motions to suppress in
the trial of the non-perjury counts, the Court will defer consideration of those motions
until it has scheduled the trial of the perjury counts. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 4/19/2021) (nl) (Entered: 04/19/2021)
