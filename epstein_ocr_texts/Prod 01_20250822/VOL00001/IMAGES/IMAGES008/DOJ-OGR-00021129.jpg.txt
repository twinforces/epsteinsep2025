cause can be based on implied bias, inferred bias, or actual bias. United States v.
Torres, 128 F.3d 38, 43 (2d Cir. 1997). Clearly, had Juror No. 50 disclosed his

juror’s dishonesty, and (3) the juror’s motives for lying. See, Sampson v. United
States, 724 F.3d 150, 166 (1* Cir. 2013).

several years; was abused by someone he knew and trusted and another person;
and delayed disclosing the abuse for years. A267-268. Juror 50’s experience is
more troubling because it directly bore upon Maxwell’s central trial defense i.e.,
that the testimony of the complaining witnesses was unreliable because it
