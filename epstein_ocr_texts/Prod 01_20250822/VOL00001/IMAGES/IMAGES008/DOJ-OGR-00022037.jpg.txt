Additionally, Michael Thomas is charged with making false statements for signing
certain count slips and round sheets. However, what the government has deliberately failed to
clarify is that those documents have to be approved by supervisors and are signed and/or initialed
by other BOP employees. Ifthis is the case, why is Michael Thomas and Tova Noel the only two
. employees charged with making false statements. Indeed, according to the government, they
have video showing Mr. Thomas sleeping and surfing the internet instead of doing the rounds as

required. Importantly, on the night in question, there is at least one BOP employee tasked with .
. watching the surveillance cameras. Presumably, this person would have watched Mr. Thomas sit
in his chair and sleep and then observe him present a document stating that he conducted rounds.
It is defendants’ burden to make a prima facie showing that documents sought under Rule
16({a)(1)(E)G@) are material to preparing the defense. McGuinness, 764 F. Supp. at 894. "To
| establish a showing of materiality, a defendant must offer more than the conclusory allegation
that the requested evidence is material." See United States v. Ashley, 905 F. Supp. 1146, 1168
(E.D.N.Y.1995) The defendant submits that he has carried this burden. Plainly, the documents
upon which the government procured an indictment based on making a false statement have to

' be reviewed, verified and signed by other BOP employees and/or supervisory personnel. |
However, inexplicably none of those individuals are charged with violating the law. This issue
standing alone establishes the import of how the requested disclosures will assist “the defendant _
significantly to alter the quantum of proof in his favor.” United States v. Maniktala, 934 F.2d 25,
28 (2d Cir.1991) The requested reports go to the heart of Mr. Thomas’ defense. He needs to
know if these issues are addressed in the Inspector General’s eport or in any other reports by
