02/24/2022 MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO INTERVENE AND FOR
RELEASE OF SEALED JURY QUESTIONNAIRE AND TRANSCRIPT, ON BEHALF
OF PROPOSED INTERVENOR, JUROR 50 as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 608 MOTION.
(ap) (Entered: 02/24/2022)

02/24/2022 610 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for the reasons fully explained in the Opinion & Order,
a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant's motion. Because of the important
interest in the finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining a post-verdict hearing is
high. The Court concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard
for holding a post-verdict evidentiary hearing is met as to whether Juror 50 failed to
respond truthfully during the jury selection process to whether he was a victim of sexual
abuse. Following trial, Juror 50 made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple
media outlets about his own experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that
cast doubt on the accuracy of his responses during jury selection. Juror 50's post-trial
statements are "clear, strong, substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific,
non-speculative impropriety"namely, a false statement during jury selection has occurred.
United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 2018). To be clear, the potential
impropriety is not that someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the
jury. Rather, it is the potential failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury
selection process that asked for that material information so that any potential bias could
be explored. In contrast, the demanding standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is
not met as to the conduct of any other juror. The Court DENIES the request to conduct a
hearing with respect to the other jurors. The Court also DENIES the Defendant's request
for a broader hearing and pre-hearing discovery. The Court therefore ORDERS that a
hearing take place at which the Court will question Juror 50 under oath. The Court further
ORDERS that Juror 50's questionnaire be unsealed, for the reasons explained in the
Opinion & Order. The Court will email counsel for Juror 50 a copy of his questionnaire
and a copy of this Order. As also explained in the Opinion & Order, the Court will
conduct the questioning at the public hearing with input from counsel for the Defendant
and the Government. The parties may submit by email proposed questions in accordance
with the Opinion & Order on or before March 1, 2022. The hearing will take place on
March 8, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. The Court ORDERS Juror 50 to appear in Courtroom 906
of the Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse, 40 Centre Street, New York, New
York at that date and time to give testimony under oath in response to the Court's
questions. The Court will ensure public access and will provide information on public
access as soon as it is available. The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion &
Order to the parties. By noon on February 25, 2022, the parties are ORDERED to inform
the Court whether either seeks limited redactions to the Opinion & Order, conforming
any requests to this Court's prior order, Dkt. No. 596, and justifying any such request by
reference to the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid.
