(2/24/2022 | 610: |; ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: for'the reasons fully éxplained:in the Opinion & Order,
a.hearing-is necessary tocresolve ‘the: Defendant's motion. Because?of:the important
Interest-in the ‘finality of judgments, the standard for obtaining, a-post-yverdict hearing is
high: The Court:coicludes, and.the Gov erninent concedes, that the deinanding Staiidard,
‘forholding a post-verdict evidentiary hearing i is met as to whether Juror’50 ‘failed to
respond; truthfully during the'jury selection process to whether he'was.a-victim of sexual
abuse. Following‘trial, Juror50 made several direct, unambiguous, statements. to ‘multiple.
‘media. outlets about his own experience’that:do not pertain to jury.deliberations and that
statements are "clear; strong, substantial and:incontrovertible evidence that a specific,
non-speculative impropricty"namcely, a false statement during jury selection has occurred.
United States v. Baker, 899 F.3d 123, 130 (2d Cir. 2018)=To be clear, the potential,
‘impropricty: isnot that someone with. a: ‘history of sexual.abuse-may ‘have. served on: the
jury. Rather, it is the:potential failure'to respond truthfully to questions during, the jury
selection process that asked for that inaterial information so that any ‘potential bias could
‘be explored. ‘In. contrast, the demanding. standard:for‘ordering an.ev identiary hearing is
not met as to the conduct of any other juror. The Court‘DENIES the request: to:coriduct a.
hearing:with respect'to the:other jurors. The Court: also DENIES the; Defendant's:request
for‘a broader. hearing and’pre-hearing discovery. The Court:therefore ORDERS: that a.
hearitg take’place at which the Court will question. Juror’50 under oath. The Court further.
ORDERS that Juror 50's questionnaire’be unsealed, for, the reasons explained.in ‘the:
‘Opinion & Order, ‘The: Court will email counsel:for Juror’5Q:a. copy of his questionnaire
