until after Epstein. completed his sentence, but that Krischer would. oppose ‘such a petition “if. itis
in the agreement.”””” On November 16, 2007, the case. agents met with Belohlavek and asked if.
the State Attorney’s Office: would ‘oppose ‘a request that Epstein be: granted. work release.

Belohlavek’ was noncoinmittal; and when the agents asked. that she ‘include language in the state’s
plea agreement prohibiting, Epstein from ‘participating in. work release,,‘she: responded that ‘she
would have to discuss the issue with the State Attorey.!° Krischer later told OPR. that work
release. was“within the control. of the Sheriffs Office, not my office.” ‘The state’s:plea agreement.

with, Epstein did not.address the issue ofwork-release.

The: day after Epstein. entered ‘his: June 30, 2008: plea, Villafaiia. and. her immediate
supervisor mict: with a Paliv Beach Sheriff's Office official to discuss work release. According’ to
Villafafia, the official told them, “Epstein. would be:eligible for work. release and will.be placed.on
work -felease,” a statement-that contradicted the information.the case agents. had been given by a,
jail supervisor the previous November, ‘as well as: statements made by. defense attorney Jack:
Goldberger to, Villafaia just. days before the plea was entered, when ‘he “specifically. told.
[Villafana] that. [Epstein] would no@ get work: release.” ‘Villafana. alerted. the: Sheriff's Office:
official that although Epstein told.the court during his plea proceeding that he had.worked “every
day” for'a “couple of, years” ‘at. the: “Florida. Science Foundation,” that entity did not even exist
until November 2007.!*! Moreover, ‘the address Epstein provided to the court for the “Florida.

work reléase, and. he would not have contradicted her efforts. Acosta explained ‘thati the USAO
expected Epstein would. be “treated just like everyone else,” but.that, as shown by “our. subsequent.
communications with the [S]tate [A]ttorney’s [(O]ffice” ‘having Epstein‘on-work release “was. not:
what our office envisioned.”

In. August 2008, Villafaia spoke. with defense attorney Black about. ensuring Epstein’s
compliance’ with the NPA, and.raised the-issue of work:release. Villafaiia later reported. to Acosta
and Sloiian that Black assured her hé had “temiiided the, teain that. . . 18 months IN JAIL is.a.
material term of the: agreement.”

The USAO never received notice of Epstcin’s work:release application. On October 10,
2008, less than three-and-a-half months after, Epstein entered his guilty plea, ‘the Palm Beach,
Sheriff's Office placed him into the work release program, permitting hin, | to leave the Stockade
