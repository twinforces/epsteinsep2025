1 Act until April 20, 2020. I find that the ends of justice

2 served by excluding such time outweigh the interests of the

3 public and the defendants in a speedy trial because this will
4 allow time for the prosecution to produce discovery, for the
iy defense to consider it, to decide whether to prepare motions,
6 and for the parties to discuss a possible disposition.

7 The defendants' bail status shall remain the same.

8 The matter is adjourned.
