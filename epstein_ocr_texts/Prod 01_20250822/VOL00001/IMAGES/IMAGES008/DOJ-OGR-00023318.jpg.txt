intentionally concealing information from them and was part of a series of interactions with
victims that led to condemnation of the government’s treatment of victims. **°
VI. THE GOVERNMENT FAILED TO TREAT VICTIMS FORTHRIGHTLY AND

WITH SENSITIVITY WHEN IT FAILED TO TIMELY PROVIDE VICTIMS

WITH IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE RESOLUTION OF THE

FEDERAL INVESTIGATION

Although OPR does not conclude that any of the subjects committed professional
misconduct, either by failing to consult with the victims before the NPA was signed or in
interactions afterwards, OPR’s findings are not an endorsement of the government’s course of
action. The government’s interactions with victims confused and frustrated many of the victims,
particularly the two CVRA petitioners and the two victims who had unsuccessfully attempted to
join in the CVRA litigation. As a result, the victims’ and the public’s perception of the matter is
that the prosecutors worked with Epstein’s attorneys to disenfranchise and silence the victims. It
is unfortunate, and appears fundamentally unfair to the victims, that Acosta and Sloman (after
Menchel and Lourie departed) took the unusual step of deciding to vet the USAO victim
notification letters with the defense after the NPA was signed, but failed to go beyond the
requirements of the CVRA or the 2005 Guidelines to consult with the victims before the NPA was
signed. This result is contrary to the Department’s intent, as set forth in the 2005 Guidelines, that
Department employees work to “minimize the frustration and confusion that victims of crime
endure in its wake.” When considering the entirety of the government’s interactions with victims,
OPR concludes that victims were not treated with the forthrightness and sensitivity expected by
the Department.

Wild’s criticisms of the government’s conduct were based on interactions that are similar
to and generally representative of the government’s interactions with other Epstein victims and
that demonstrate an overall lack of sensitivity to the victims by the government. Wild experienced
a series of confusing and inconsistent communications in her interactions with Villafafia and the
case agents. Wild received Villafafia’s letter in June 2007 stating inaccurately that she was a
federal victim entitled to CVRA rights. She was interviewed by the FBI in August 2007 but was
not told that a potential outcome was a state plea. Shortly after the September 24, 2007 signing of
the NPA, the FBI contacted her to inform her of the resolution of the federal case. Nonetheless,
on January 10, 2008, the FBI sent her a victims’ rights letter indicating that the case was under
investigation and that some of her CVRA rights may not apply until after the defendant was
charged. On January 31, 2008, Villafafia re-interviewed Wild, along with a CEOS attorney and
the FBI agents, and told Wild that the case was under investigation, but did not specifically mention
the NPA, although she may have mentioned a possible resolution. In mid-June 2008, when
Edwards contacted Villafafia on Wild’s behalf, Villafafia informed him that the case was under
investigation but did not mention the NPA. Just before Epstein’s June 30, 2008 state court plea,
“45 OPR notes that, similar to Villafafia, Sloman interacted with a victim’s attorney during the time period
between the signing of the NPA and Epstein’s state guilty plea. In January 2008, Sloman received a telephone call
from his former law partner, who represented one of the victims and who asked Sloman whether the federal
government could bring charges against Epstein. Sloman, concerned about the potential for conflict of interest
allegations due to his prior business relations with the attorney, refused to answer any questions regarding Epstein.
Because Sloman refused to provide any information, OPR found no basis for finding that Sloman misled the attorney.
