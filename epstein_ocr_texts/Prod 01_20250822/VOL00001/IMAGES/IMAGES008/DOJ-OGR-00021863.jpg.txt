Here, the inquiry jis straightforward. In, 2003, Congress
amended § 3283 to provide: “No. statute of limitations that would.
otherwise preclude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual, or
physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child under the age of 18 years shall
preclude such prosecution. during the life of the child.”** The text of
§ 3283—that:. no statute of limitations that. would otherwise. preclude
prosecution. of these offenses will apply—plainly requires that it
prevent the application. of any statute of limitations that would,

otherwise apply to past conduct.

The statutory text makes'clear that Congress intended, to'extend,
the time to bring charges of sexual abuse for pre-enactment conduct as
the prior statute of limitations was inadequate. This is enough to
conclude that the PROTECT Act's amendment. to § 3283. applies to

Maxwell’s conduct as charged. in, the Indictment.
