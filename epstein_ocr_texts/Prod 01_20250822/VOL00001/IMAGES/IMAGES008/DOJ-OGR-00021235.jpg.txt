Lourie opined that the government could argue “that‘over time [Epstein] set up:a network of illegal.
high School massage. recruits that would be difficult to. duplicate anywhere else,” “which supported
the: conclusion.that the massages:must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole
purpose. However, Lourie expressed concern about “getting to the jury” on this issue arid noted
that he had not found.a legal ‘case. factually ‘on.point.. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with.
Lotrie?s analysis of the purpose of travel isstie, and had. discussed:the matter with him.°* Villafana
also recalled that there; were aspects of the defense submissions she and.her colleagues considered.
“particularly-weak.” .

On.June:26, 2007, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm
Beach squad. supervisor met. at. the Miami, USAO with Epstein attorneys Dershowitz; Black,
‘Lefcourt, and. Sanchez. Dershowitz led the defense team’s: presentation.. From the USAO
perspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.” Echoing the arguments tiade in,
Lefcourt’s letter, Dershowitz argued. that the: USAO should. permit. the state to handle: the: case
becatisé these Were “traditionally state, offenses.” The case, agent recalled being uncomfortable:
that the defense ‘was ‘asking questions in. an. attempt to gain information, about the: federal.
investigation, including the ‘number of: victims and. the:-types of sexual contact that had. been
involved.

Villafana told .OPR that, when Epstein’s attorneys: left the mecting, they. appeared to be
“under the impression.that they:had convinced us not to proceed.” But.Menchel.told OPR, “[T]hey
obviously did not persuade” the USAO becaiisé “we .... didn’t drop the investigation.” According
to Villafafia, Louric, and Menchel, during. a short post-meeting, discussion ‘at which. Lourie:
expressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel, raised. issties related to general.
credibility of the. victims, the! prev ailing sense among the USAO participants was that.the defense.
presentation. had. not been persuasive. Villafana told OPR. that she. “left [the meeting] with the:
impression that we: were continuing towards” filing:charges.

broad outline of an agreement.that:could:resolve the. federal investigation. Theagreement would

accomplish. three goals: important to: the federal prosecutors: ‘Epstein’s incarceration; his:
registration, as'a sexual offenders aid a:iniechanism to:provide-for'the victims to recover monctary’

‘Villafaita also told‘OPR that Lourie had, av times, expressed Concern about the:prosecution’ s ability to prove.
