Lourie opined that the government could argue “that over time [Epstein] set up a network of illegal
high school massage recruits that would be difficult to duplicate anywhere else,” which supported
the conclusion that the massages must have been a motivating purpose of his travel, if not the sole
purpose. However, Lourie expressed concern about “getting to the jury” on this issue and noted
that he had not found a legal case factually on point. Villafafia told OPR that she disagreed with
Lourie’s analysis of the purpose of travel issue and had discussed the matter with him.* Villafafia
also recalled that there were aspects of the defense submissions she and her colleagues considered
“narticularly weak.”

On June 26, 2007, Sloman, Menchel, Lourie, Villafafia, the case agent, and the West Palm
Beach squad supervisor met at the Miami USAO with Epstein attorneys Dershowitz, Black,
Lefcourt, and Sanchez. Dershowitz led the defense team’s presentation. From the USAO
perspective, the meeting was merely a “listening session.”°* Echoing the arguments made in
Lefcourt’s letter, Dershowitz argued that the USAO should permit the state to handle the case
because these were “traditionally state offenses.” The case agent recalled being uncomfortable
that the defense was asking questions in an attempt to gain information about the federal
investigation, including the number of victims and the types of sexual contact that had been
involved.

Villafafia told OPR that when Epstein’s attorneys left the meeting, they appeared to be
“under the impression that they had convinced us not to proceed.” But Menchel told OPR, “[T]hey
obviously did not persuade” the USAO because “we... didn’t drop the investigation.” According
to Villafafia, Lourie, and Menchel, during a short post-meeting discussion at which Lourie
expressed concern about the purpose of travel issue and Menchel raised issues related to general
credibility of the victims, the prevailing sense among the USAO participants was that the defense
presentation had not been persuasive. Villafafia told OPR that she “left [the meeting] with the
impression that we were continuing towards” filing charges.

IV. ACOSTA DECIDES TO OFFER EPSTEIN A TWO-YEAR STATE PLEA TO

RESOLVE THE FEDERAL INVESTIGATION

USAO internal communications show that in July 2007, Acosta developed, or adopted, the
broad outline of an agreement that could resolve the federal investigation. The agreement would
leave the case in state court by requiring Epstein to plead guilty to state charges, but would
accomplish three goals important to the federal prosecutors: Epstein’s incarceration; his
registration as a sexual offender; and a mechanism to provide for the victims to recover monetary
3 Villafafia also told OPR that Lourie had, at times, expressed concern about the prosecution’s ability to prove
Epstein’s knowledge of the victims’ ages, particularly with regard to those who were 16 or 17 at the time they provided
massages.

4 In his written response to OPR, Menchel indicated that he had no independent recollection of the June 26,
2007 meeting. In his OPR interview, Menchel said that although he had little memory of the meeting, to the best of
his recollection the USAO simply listened to the defense presentation, and in a contemporaneous email, Menchel
opined that he viewed the upcoming June 26 meeting as “more as [the USAO] listening and them presenting their
position.”
