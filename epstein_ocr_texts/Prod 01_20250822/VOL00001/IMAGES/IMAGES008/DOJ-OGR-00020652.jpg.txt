Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from Bobbi C. Sternheim dated 04/13/2021
re: Proposed Order to Marshal. ENDORSEMENT: After conferring with the District
Executive and the United States Marshal for the Southern District of New York, the Court
denies the request. The U.S. Marshall has a generally applicable policy that prohibits
inmates being held in the Courthouse cellblocks from possessing any materials or items.
The circumstances do not warrant an exception to that policy. SO ORDERED. (Signed by

Bobbi) (Entered: 04/15/2021)

04/16/2021 203 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the partiesâ€™ joint letter
responding to the Court's March 29, 2021 Order. The parties agree that the redactions to
pages 118 and 119 are no longer necessary. The Defendant continues to press for the
redactions on pages 129134. However, for the reasons stated in the Court's March 29,
2021 Order, the information is already part of the public record in this case and
accordingly the proposed redactions are unnecessary and overbroad. Dkt. No. 189; see
also United States v. Nejad, No. 18-CR-224 (AJN), 2021 WL 681427, at *11 (S.D.N.Y.
Feb. 22, 2021). For the reasons stated in the Court's March 18, 2021 and March 29, 2021
Orders, the Court approves the limited redactions to Exhibit 11 to the Government's brief,
except for the language quoted in the Indictment, which is already part of the public
record. The Government is therefore ORDERED to docket its omnibus memorandum of
law, along with the corresponding exhibits, by 3:00 p.m. today, consistent with the
Court's orders regarding redactions. The parties are further ORDERED to docket their
April 1, 2021 joint letter; if either side believes that portions of that letter should be
redacted, they shall propose redactions by April 19, 2021. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
Nathan on 4/16/2021) (ap) (Entered: 04/16/2021)
