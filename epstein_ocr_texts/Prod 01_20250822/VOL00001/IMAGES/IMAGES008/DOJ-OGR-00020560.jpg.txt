(Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 12/15/2021)

12/15/2021 | 548 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Defense on
December 12, 2021, moved to permit three anticipated witnesses to testify under a
pseudonym or their first names only. The Government filed a letter opposing this
request on December 14, 2021. The Defense's primary contention is that some form of
anonymity for its witnesses is justified by the same reasons that the Court permitted
three alleged victims and two related government witnesses to testify under
pseudonyms. The Court disagrees with this basic premise and denies the Defense's
motion....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... Last, the Court
emphasizes that while it currently denies the Defense's motion, the Defense may of
course raise, and the Court will consider, objections that particular lines of questioning
into witnesses' backgrounds or lives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass, or
otherwise inappropriate. See, e.g., Smith v. Illinois, 390 U.S. 129, 133 (1968)
(emphasizing that even when anonymity is not warranted, the court has a duty to
protect a witness "from questions which go beyond the bounds of proper
cross—examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate him"). SO ORDERED.

12/15/2021 | 694 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's motion
