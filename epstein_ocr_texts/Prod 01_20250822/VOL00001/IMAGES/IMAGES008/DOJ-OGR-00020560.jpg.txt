‘pscudonym.or their first names only. The Government filed a. letter opposing this
srequest.on December 14, 2021. ‘The Defense's primary contention-is that some form of
anonymity for its witnesses is justified by ‘the same reasons‘that the Court:permitted
‘thiée alleged victinis and two related, government. withesses'to'téstify under
pseudonyms. The Court disagrees. with this basic premise and-denies the Defense's
‘motion....[*** Sce this Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... Last, the Court
emphasizes that whilevit currently-denies the, Defense's ‘motion, the. Defense may:of.
course raise, and, the c ourt will consider, » objections that particular. lines of question

otherwise | jnappropriate. See, ¢. g., “Smith vi Illinois, 390 US. "729, 133 (1968)
(emphasizing that even when anonymity is not warranted, the court‘has'a: duty: to
protect a witness "from,questions which go beyond.the bounds of proper’
cross—cxamination-merely to:harass, annoy or humiliate him"). SO ORDERED.
