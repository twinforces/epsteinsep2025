A; U.S. Attorneys Have Broad. Discretion to Resolve Investigations or Cases as
They. Deem Appropriate, and Acosta’s Decision. ‘to Decline to Prosecute
Epstein Federally.Does Not Constitute Professional Misconduct

The. U.S. Attorneys exercise: broad. discretion..in enforcing the nation’s criminal. laws.7°
AS a general matter; federal prosecutors “are. designated by statute as the President’s delegates ‘to
help -hiny discharge his ‘constitutional ‘responsibility to: “take: Care that the Laws be faithfully
executed?” United Siates v. Armstrong; 517 U.S. 456, 464 (1996) (quoting U:S. Const: art. IT,
$3). Unless based on. an. impermissible: standard. such as race, ‘religion, .or other arbitrary
classification, a prosecutor’s charging decisions—including declinations—are not-dictated'by. law:
or statute: and:are: not subject to judicial review. See Vnited: States v. LaBonte, 520 U.S. 75], 762
(1997). Such discretion is an integral feature of the. criminal. justice system, and is appropriate,
so long as it is not based upon improper factors.”).

Departinent: policy guidance if effect at the time-the USAO was handling’the Epstein.case
helped ensure “the reasoned exercise of prosecutorial authority,” but.did not require’ “a particular
prosecutorial décision,in. any given case.” USAM 88 9-27. O01, 9-27:120: (comiment). Rather than.
mandating ‘specific: ‘actions, the: USAM. identified. considerations. that. ‘should factor ‘into: ‘a
prosecutor’s charging decisions, including:that the defendant was “subject toveffective:prosecution
in another jurisdiction.” USAM ¥ 9-27.220. Importantly,,U.S. Attorneys had “plenary authority
with regard to federal, criminal matters” and could modify. or depart: from ‘the principles set forth
in the USAM. as deemed: necessary. in the‘interest.of faitand effective law enforcenient within their
‘individual. judicial districts. USAM. §§ 9-2.001, 9-27.140. As.stated in the USAM, “{t]he: United
‘States Attorney i is invested. by: statute and. delegation from the Attorney General. with, the broadest:
discretion in the exercise of.such [prosecutive] authority,” which includes the authority: to. decline:
prosecution. USAM §$ 922.001. —

In. addition, the  USAM contemplated that federal prosecutors would sometimes decline:
federal _prosecution : ‘in deference: to a state prosecution, of the same conduct-and. provided. guidance
‘in the form of-factors to ‘be considered :in.making the decision, including the: strength. of the other:
jurisdiction” $ interest 'in‘prosecution, the other jurisdiction’s ability -and willingness to prosecute
effectively, and'the probable sentence or other consequences if the:person is convicted:in.the-other
jurisdiction. USAM § 9-27.240. 27 A comment to: this provision stated that the factors are

“illustrative.only, and the attorney for the gow. ernment.should also consider any others that appear
relevant to. hifi ]/her in a,particular case,

204 The discretionary authority‘under LSAM’ § 9-2:7.240°to-defer prosecution in favor of’another jurisdiction is
distinet from the Petite policy, w ‘hich éstablishes gilidelines Tor the éxercise of discretion Jin-determining whether to-
bring. a federal prosecution based ‘on, conduct substantially: the same.-as ‘that involved ‘in, a; prior state or federal,
‘proceeding. See USAM.§ 9-2:031.
