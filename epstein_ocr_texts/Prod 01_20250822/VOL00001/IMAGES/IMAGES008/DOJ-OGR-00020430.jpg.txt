08/13/2021 | 318 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On March 19, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted a sealed and ex parte motion for an order authorizing four subpoenas
pursuant to Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. By sealed order
dated March 22, 2021, the Court provided an opportunity for recipients of the
subpoenas to respond to the requests by March 30, 2021, but it received no responses.
In an Opinion and Order temporarily filed under seal, the Court DENIES Maxwell's
motion without prejudice. It does so after concluding that none of the proposed
subpoenas conform to the factors first set out in United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683,
69870 (1974). The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion and Order to
defense counsel. By August 18, 2021, Maxwell is ORDERED to inform the Court
whether she seeks sealing or limited redactions of the Court's opinion and of her
original motion papers, justifying any such request by reference to the three—part test
articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d
110 (2d Cir. 2006). In addition, by that date Maxwell shall inform the Court whether
she seeks full sealing or redactions of the original motion, again justifying any such
request by reference to the Lugosch test. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
8/13/2021) (ap) (Entered: 08/13/2021)

08/13/2021 | 334 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell's motion is, at this time,
DENIED without prejudice. She may renew any Rule 17(c) applications upon a proper
showing that each of the requested materials satisfies the Nixon test, as described
above and in the Court's April 27, 2021 and June 2, 2021 Orders. The Court will file
this Opinion & Order under temporary seal to allow consideration of any sealing or
redaction requests. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 8/13/2021) (See ORDER set
