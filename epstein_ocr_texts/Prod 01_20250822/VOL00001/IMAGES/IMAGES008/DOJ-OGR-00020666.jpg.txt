no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the Court urges
the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be reduced. The
Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to ensure that Maxwell
is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines are necessary for her
safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors, and consistent with the
treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The Government shall provide a copy
of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for the MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed

05/17/2021 284 | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 278 Letter Proposed Redactions
to Defendant's Supplemental Pre-Trial Motions... ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants in
part the Government's redaction and sealing requests. Its conclusion is guided by the
three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga,
435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court concludes that these are judicial documents and
that the First Amendment and common law presumptions of access attach. Id. at 11920.
In balancing competing considerations against the presumption of access, the Court finds
that the arguments the Government has put forward in this letter, including the need to
protect the privacy interests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrowly
tailored redactions. See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995).
Similarly, the Court concludes that the Government has shown that Exhibits E, F, G, H,
and I should be filed under seal. With respect to Exhibit C, however, the Court concludes
that narrowly tailored redactions are sufficient to advance the privacy interests the
Government has identified. Accordingly, the Government is ORDERED to confer with
defense counsel and submit proposed redactions to Exhibit C by May 20, 2021. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/17/21)Gbo) (Entered: 05/17/2021)
