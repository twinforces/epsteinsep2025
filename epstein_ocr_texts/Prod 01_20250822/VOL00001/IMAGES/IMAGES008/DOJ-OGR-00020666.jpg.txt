435 F:3d. 1.10 (2d Gir. 2006). The-Gourt concludes;that‘these are;judicial documents. and
that :the-First Amendment and. common. law presumptions of access attach. Id. at 1.1920.

In, balancitig competing considerations against the presumption of access, the Court: finds
that the:'arguments the:Government has put:forward in, this letter, including the need to
protect'the’priyacy interests of third parties and alleged’victims, favor the:narrowly.

tailored redactions. See United States v. Aimodeo, 71. F:3d 1044, 1.050 (2d Git: 1995).
Similarly,, the Court concludes that the Government has. shown that;Exhibits. E, F, GH;

and I should, be filed under seal. With respect:to Exhibit C, however; the Court concludes
‘that narrowly: tailored: redactions are sufficient toadvance the: privacy: interests the
‘Government has identified. Accordingly, the: Government is. ORDERED to confer'with
deferisé Courisel and submit proposed redactions to Exhibit C by May 20, 2021.SO
