forinally presenting the case to the FBI; the. PBPD waited to see how the. State. Attorhey’s Office
decided to charge Epstein.

‘1. The PBPD Presents the Matter to the FBI and the USAO

In.May2006, the lead Detective handling the state’s investigation.met-with Villafana and
the FBI case agent to summarize for them. the. information learned during, the state’s:
investigation. '* At the'titne, neither Villafana nor the case agent had heard of Epstein of had any
knowledge: of his background.

According to Villafana, during'this meeting, the Detectiv cexpresstd | concern that “pressure
had been. brought t to > bear ¢ on. - Krischer by Epstein’ 8 ator neys and he and Chief Reiter: were
explained ‘that ‘the defense: had hired private investigators to trail. Reiter and the Detective, had
raised claitiis of various improprieties by the police, sand, in the view of the PBPD, had orchestrated
the:removal of the Assistant State Attorney initially assigned to handle the:matter, who-was'viewed
aS an aggressive prosecutor, by hiring a, defense attorney whose relationship with the: Assistant:
State.Attorncy created a-conflict of-interest'for the prosecutor. Further, given the missing computer
equipment and stiveillance cainera videotapes, the Detective believed Epstein nay have been

“tipped-off” in. advance about the search warrant.

During the meeting, Villafana reviewed'the U.S. Code to see what federal charges could
be brought against Epstein. She: focused on 18 U.S: C: S$¥ 2422 (enticement of minors into
prostitution of other: illegal sexual activity and. use ofa, facility of interstate or foreign commerce
to persuade or:induce a:minor to engage in. prostitution or other illegal. sexual activity): and 2423
(travel, for puitposes' of engaging in, illegal. sexual conduct). As they disetissed these charges, the
Detective told Villafaria that Epstein. and. his assistants had. traveled. out. of the ‘Palm Beach.
International Airport on Epstein’s private airplane, and flight logs: sometimes referred ‘to
to underage girls. However, the Detective acknowledged that. he was unable: to confirm. that:
suspicion and-did'not have firm evidence indicating that Epstein had.transported any girls interstate.
or‘internationally. Nevertheless, Villafafia believed Epstein could ’be prosecuted federally, :in.part
because: of his own. interstate and ‘international travel to the Southern, District: of Florida to ‘abuse
gitls. Villafaiia:discussed withthe Detective.and the case agent the additional.investigation needed
to prove violations of the federal, statutes she had identified. She'told them that if the evidence
supported it, the case could be pr osecuted ; federally, but she assured them. that: opening a federal.
ifivestigation would not preclude the State Attorney’s Office ‘from charging Epstein should it
choose to ‘do so.
