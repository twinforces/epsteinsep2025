04/16/2021 | 206 | REPLY MEMORANDUM OF LAW in Support as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 143
MOTION to Dismiss Counts One Through Four of the Superseding Indictment as
Time—Barred. . (Everdell, Christian) (Entered: 04/16/2021)

04/16/2021 | 207 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. In June 2020, a grand jury returned a
six—count indictment charging Ghislaine Maxwell with facilitating the late financier
Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse of minor victims from around 1994 to 1997. The
Government filed a first (S1) superseding indictment shortly thereafter, which
contained only small, ministerial corrections. The S1 superseding indictment included
two counts of enticement or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in
violation of the Mann Act and two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It
also included two counts of perjury in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil
deposition. Trial is set to begin on July 12, 2021. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial
motions seeking to dismiss portions of the $1 superseding indictment, suppress
evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully briefed those motions, a grand
jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and
another related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of Maxwell's currently
pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress evidence, which the
Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal exclusively with
the S1 superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to the newly added
sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies Maxwell's
motions to dismiss the $1 superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants her
motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further
expedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its
reasoning on the pages that follow:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]...
Conclusion: The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as
barred by Epstein's non—prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. 141), to dismiss the Mann
Act counts as barred by the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. 143), to dismiss the
indictment for pre—indictment delay (Dkt. No. 137), to dismiss the Mann Act counts
for lack of specificity (Dkt. No. 123), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable
(Dkt. No. 135), to strike surplusage (Dkt. No. 145), to dismiss count one or count three
as multiplicitous (Dkt. No. 121), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. 147).
The Court GRANTS Maxwell's motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial
(Dkt. No. 119). The Court ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week
whether it considers any evidence related to negotiation of the non—prosecution
agreement to constitute Brady or Rule 16 material and, if so, to confirm that it has or
will disclose such evidence. The Court further ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final
schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio,
and Jenks Act materials, including co—conspirator statements; non-testifying witness
statements; testifying witness statements; the identity of victims alleged in the
indictment; 404(b) material; and the Government's witness list. The Court also requires
the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or supplemental motions briefing
in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint proposal to be submitted by
April 21, 2021. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall submit their respective
proposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to show cause by April 21, 2021 why
her motion to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment under the Sixth Amendment (Dkt.
No. 125) should not be denied as moot. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
