Villafatia added that the: PBPD Chief had. alerted the: FBI ‘that an upcoming news article would
report that Epstein was * ‘going’to plead toa state. charge’ “and. the PBPD Chief “wanted to know if.
the victims ‘had been. consulted. about the. deal.” Sloman forwarded Villafaiia’s email. to Acosta
‘with a note that read sitiiply, “fyi.”

Later-that:evening, Villafana circulated-to'Sloman, Lourie, and Oosterbaan two alternative:
documents: a draft federal plea agreement, and:a-draft NPA.’ ‘The draft federal plea agreement,
following the USAO’s standard format, called for Epstein.to plead guilty. to a five-year:conspiracy
under 18-U.S.C. § 371 to entice minors'to engage in prostitution, an offense requiring registration,
as a sexual. offender, with a‘Rule:L1(c)’ binding. sentence: of two years” imprisonment. The draft
NPA contained the-terims presented to the. defense team on July’3 1, 2007, and-called for Epstein to
enter a state plea by September 28,.2007.. Villafafia told OPR that because ‘she had.never seen.a
non-prosecution agreement before, she relied on a template she. found. either using USAO or the
Department’s. internal. online: resources, ‘but. she: did. not do ‘any additional. research ‘regarding the:
ust Of HOn-prosecution agreements. |”!

Acosta told OPR that-the mécting was not “a negotiation,” but a chance ‘for the défense'to
present their-arguments, which were made by Starr and focused primarily ‘on-federalism. Villafana
similarly. recalled that the:meeting mainly consisted ofthe. defense argument:that:the. Epstein.case:
should ‘remain a state. matter in which the USAO. should not interfere. Both Villafana and her
co-counsel recalled that Starr addressed himself directly. to Acosta, and that. Starr, who had held
