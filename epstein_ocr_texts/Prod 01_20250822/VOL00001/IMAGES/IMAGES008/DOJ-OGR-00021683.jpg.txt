Florida, such as the USAO-SDFL’s. “contact with wit-
nesses in New York.” (Br.38). These disparate and un-
connected events do, not show that the USAO-SDFL:
acted on behalf of the entire federal government when
entering into the NPA, or that: Epstein understood the
USAO-SDFL to be doing so.

Maxwell also.advances several.arguments attempt-
ing to.minimize or side-step this'Court’s‘precedent. For
example, Maxwell argues that. Annabi applies. only if
the charges,in'the indictment are “sufficiently distinct”
from the counts resolved by the earlier agreement.
(Br.30-33. (quoting 771 F.2d at.672)). Not so. The rele-
vant portion of Annabi concerned an. argument’ by the
defendants that in seeking to have a plea agreement.
in the Eastern. District of New York bar the pending
charges in. the: Southern. District of New York, they
were “seeking only the same protection accordéd by’
th[e Double Jeopardy] Clause.” 771 F.2d at 672. This
‘Court rejected that argument, reasoning that even if
the Double Jeopardy Clause applied (notwithstanding
that the defendants wére “never in jeopardy” 6n thosé
charges in the Eastern District), the defendants. would
not be éntitled to relief because the pending charges

“extended for an additional two years” and thus were
“not the same.as the charges that were dismissed.” Id.
Thus, Annabi did not hold that its rule—that “[a] plea
agreement binds only the office: of the United States
Attorney for the district in which the'plea is entered
unless it affirmatively appears that the agreement
contemplates a. broader restriction,” id:—applies only
if the charges are sufficiently distinct. .And as Judge
Nathan. recognized; “no subsequent. Second Circuit.
case applying, Annabi.has so held.” (A.191).
