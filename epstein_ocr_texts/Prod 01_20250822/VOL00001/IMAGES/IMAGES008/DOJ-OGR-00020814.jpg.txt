Case 22-1426, Document 57_02/28/2023, 3475900, Page196 of 208
case focused on whether prosecutors were required to honor a promise that the court found to be
clear in the absence of a formal plea agreement. Even if this Court agreed with the analysis in
Cosby, that opinion sheds no light on the proper interpretation of the NPA in this case.

After considering the arguments in Maxwell’s renewed motion and letter of supplemental
authority, the Court’s view remains unchanged from its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order. Under
Second Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of

I. This prosecution does not violate the prohibition against double jeopardy

The Double Jeopardy Clause provides that “[n]o person shall be . . . subject for the same
offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. Const. amend. V. “This protection
applies both to successive punishments and to successive prosecutions for the same criminal
offense.” United States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688, 696 (1993). “A defendant may only raise a
Double Jeopardy claim if he has been put in jeopardy (i.e. jeopardy has ‘attached’) sometime

1997). A defendant is put in jeopardy when the jury in their case is empaneled or upon the
defendant’s entry of a guilty plea. Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35 (1978); Morris v. Reynolds,
264 F.3d 38, 49 (2d Cir. 2001). Until then, a defendant has not been put in jeopardy and the
Government is free to commence a prosecution.

Maxwell has not previously been put in jeopardy for the offenses charged in this case.
She concededly has not been punished or prosecuted for any prior offense. She was never
charged in the Southern District of Florida in connection with the Epstein investigation. She
agreed to nothing in Epstein’s NPA, because she was not a party to it. She suffered no criminal
consequences as a result of Epstein’s guilty plea in Florida state court. To the contrary, there is
