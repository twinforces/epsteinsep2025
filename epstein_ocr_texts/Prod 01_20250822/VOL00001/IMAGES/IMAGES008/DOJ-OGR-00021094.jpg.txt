prosecuting the same crime, covering the same time period—would upend federal
plea bargaining nationally, disrupt expectations beyond this case, and turn the
Second Circuit into a forum of convenience for the Government to reprosecute

different district puts at stake “the honor of the government|,| public confidence in
the fair administration of justice, and the efficient administration of justice in a
federal scheme of government.” Carter, 454 F.2d at 427-28.

only accuser on whom Count Six is based, Carolyn, was also a witness in the
SDFL investigation. [T: 1604-5, 1614, 1679]. But unlike the SDNY charges in
Annabi, Count Six falls wholly within the time period contemplated by the NPA as

involvement of Maxwell in offenses committed by Epstein from 2001 to 2007,
