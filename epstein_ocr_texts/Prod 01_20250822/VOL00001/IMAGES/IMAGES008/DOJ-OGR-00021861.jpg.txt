Indictment. The District Court therefore correctly denied Maxwell’s
motion without an evidentiary hearing.

2. The Indictment Is Timely

Maxwell argues that Counts Three and Four of the Indictment
are untimely because they do not fall within the scope of offenses
involving the sexual or physical abuse or kidnapping of a minor and
thereby do not fall within the extended statute of limitations provided
by § 3283.19 Separately, Maxwell contends that the Government cannot
apply the 2003 amendment to § 3283 that extended the statute of
limitations to those offenses that were committed before the enactment
into law of the provision. On both points, we disagree and hold that
the District Court correctly denied Maxwell’s motions to dismiss the
charges as untimely. We review de novo the denial of a motion to
dismiss an indictment and the application of a statute of limitations.”°

First, Counts Three and Four of the Indictment are offenses
involving the sexual abuse of minors. The District Court properly
applied Weingarten v. United States.*! In Weingarten, we explained that
Congress intended courts to apply § 3283 using a case-specific
© 18 U.S.C. § 3283 provides: “[n]o statute of limitations that would otherwise preclude
prosecution for an offense involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnaping, of a child
under the age of 18 years shall preclude such prosecution during the life of the child, or for
ten years after the offense, whichever is longer.”
