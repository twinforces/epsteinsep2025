1 With respect to travel for Mr. Thomas, your travel

2 will be restricted to the Southern District of New York, the

i) Bastern District of New York, and the District of New Jersey.

4 And for Ms. Noel, your travel will be restricted to

5 the Southern and Eastern Districts of New York, the District of
6 New Jersey and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

7 In addition, I'm imposing the requirement for

8 Mr. Thomas that he refrain from the excessive use of alcohol,

9 and, for Ms. Noel, the requirement that she -- I'm going to
10 give the authority to pretrial to determine whether or not a
11 mental health evaluation or support is needed, but that will be
12 at the direction of your pretrial services officer.
13 Let me warn each of you that if you fail to appear in
14 court or if you violate any of the conditions of your release,
15 a warrant will be issued for your arrest, and you and anybody
16 who cosigned the bond may be responsible for paying its full
17 amount, which is $100,000, and you will be charged with a
18 separate crime of bail-jumping.
19 In addition, if you commit an offense while you're on
20 pretrial supervision, you may be subject to a more severe
21 punishment than you would receive if you committed the very
22 same offense at any other time.
23 Has Judge Torres set the next conference date?
24 MR. ROOS: Yes, your Honor. The judge set it for
25 November 25, 2019.
