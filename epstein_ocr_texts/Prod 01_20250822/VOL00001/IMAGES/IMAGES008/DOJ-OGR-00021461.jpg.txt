Although the contemporancous records provide:some information about victim notification.

Sloman forwarded the email:to Acosta'with a note. stating, “fyi. ” WVillafafia recalled that after’she:
Sent the email, Slorivan, told ‘her by telephione, “[Y]ou can’t do that now." Villafatia also, told.
OPR that. shortly before the NPA was signed, Sloman‘told her,“[WJe’ve been.advised that . . . pre-
charge, resolutions, do not require ‘victin notification.” Villafana also: recalled a discussion with
Acosta, Menchel, and. Sloman, during which she stated that she would need. to get victims” input.
‘on.the terms being proposed. to the: defense; and she was told, “Plea negotiations are confidential.
You-can’t disclose them. "°°

None of the other subjects recalled. a specific’ discussion before the NPA was signed. about:
the USAO’s GVRA. obligations. Menchel told OPR. he believed the: USAO. was: not required:to
consult with victims during the preliminary “general discussion” phase of settlement negotiations:
moreover, he:left the USAO before the terms of the’ NPA’ were fully developed.

Sloman told OPR.that he:“did-not think that-~we had-to consult with victims ‘prior to-entering
into the NPA” and “we ‘did not have: to seek approval. from victims to resolve: a case.” Sloman
believed the USAO was obligated only to notify victims about resolution of “the. cases that we:
handled, filed cases.” Sloman.recalled that’ because the USAO:envisioned.a.state court.resolution.
of the matter, he did not “think that. that, was a concern of ours at'the time to consult with [the
victims] prior to entering into... . the NPA.”

Lourie told. OPR that he did not recall ‘any discussions. about informing the: victims ‘about.

look, at. cach tree and say, well, you didn’t-do this right for the victim, you didn’t tell the victim
this and that, you’re missing the’big picture.”

a As‘noted, the: Department’s:position at:the time’ was that:the VRA did not {require consultation w with, victims
because:the:; CVRA, even.whemapplicable, requires only*‘constiltation” with’ victims about’ prosecutor ial decisions,

U6 Villafatia also téld‘OPR that shé.recalled Mencheél raising a-concem that “telling them about the tiegotiations
