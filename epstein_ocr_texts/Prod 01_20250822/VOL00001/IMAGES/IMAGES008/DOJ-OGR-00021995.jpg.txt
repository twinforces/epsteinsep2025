indicated. that those video ‘surveillance files will be turned over upon request.
‘Furthermore, SDNY_7549-8118 contains the interviews of approximately 29
employees and 14. inmates. It will be necessary: to interview many, if not all the
witnesses previously interviewed by the Government.

A review: of the video surveillance turned over reveals that most of the videos aré not:
date or time stamped. After discussions with the Government, on January 21, 2020,
I provided. the Goverriment with a flash drive to reproduce the same video
surveillance contained in SDNY_00000001 with ‘the date and time stamps. On
January 22, 2020, the Government received the flash drive and.advised my office that
the flash drive was not functioning properly. On January: 23, 2020, I forwarded. a
1TB hard. drive to the Government to provide the requested materials. Based upon.
representations, made by the Government, I expect, to receive the hard drive back by
January 27, 2020.

On. January 24, 2020, my office received additional discovery from the Government.
The additional discovery increased the global discovery Bates number to 8132.

Based upon the volume of discovery. received, to | date, defendant Noel is not able to
requests: for discovery or infor mation, however, I will need significant’ time to review
and. digest the discovery to have an. appreciation of what. materials we do have and.
what materials. we do not have that we.are entitled to.

I will be prepared to discuss. this issue in further detail during our upcoming status
conference on January 30, 2020 at 11:00am. Thank you for your thoughtful
consideration.
