Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page46 of 113

Even if, as appellants contend, the Southern District charges result

from the same conspiratorial agreement that underlay the charges

dismissed in the Eastern District, the allegation [in the Southern

District] that the conspiracy extended for an additional two years

suffices to show that the new charges are not identical to the

dismissed charges. Therefore, regardless of what degree of preclusive

effect [under the Double Jeopardy Clause] the dismissal of the

Eastern District charges would have if the pending charges had been

brought by the United States Attorney for [the Eastern] District, the

[Southern District] charges are sufficiently distinct at least to warrant

application of the Abbamonte-Alessi rule concerning construction of

plea agreements [viz., that ‘(a) plea agreement binds only the office of

the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is

entered...."].”

The court misread this portion of Annabi as pertaining only to “a claim
based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a claim based on the plea agreement[.]’’.
A191. A careful reading of the above shows that Annabi’s “sufficiently distinct”
standard qualifies what the Court referred to as the “Abbamonte-Alessi rule,” i.e.,
the canon of construction for determining whether a plea agreement’s ambiguous
reference to “the Government” or “the United States” includes other USAOs.
Annabi, 771 F.2d at 672. And under this test, it was dispositive that the later-
brought SDNY charges in Annabi alleged a conspiracy period two years longer
than the period alleged and resolved in the Eastern District. See id.

What this means is that, when new charges stem from “the same” conduct
that “underlay” charges resolved by prior plea, Annabi’s rule of construction does
not apply unless the new charges also cover a new time period; that is what makes
