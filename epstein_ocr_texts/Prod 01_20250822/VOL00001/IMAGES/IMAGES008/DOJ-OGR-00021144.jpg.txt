Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page97 of 113
POINT V
THE SENTENCE SHOULD BE VACATED AND REMANED
FOR RESENTENCING AS THE DISTRICT COURT ERRED IN
APPLYING AN INCORRECT GUIDLINE RANGE AND OFFENSE
LEVEL.

The defendant’s sentence should be vacated because the District Court
erroneously calculated the guidelines range; imposed an upward variance, without
providing the required explanation; and mistakenly applied the aggravating role
adjustment. Accordingly, the sentence must be vacated and remanded back to the
District Court for re-sentencing, or — in the interest of justice - the defendant’s
sentence should be substantially reduced.

A. Standard of Review.

The standard of review for all sentences requires a “deferential abuse-of-
discretion standard.” United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 189 (2d. Cir. 2008). A
review has two components: procedural and substantive. /d. The procedural review
“must first ensure that the District Court committed no significant procedural
errors. Gall v. United States, 552 U.S. 38, 51 (2007). Here, the District Court
improperly calculated the guidelines range in the first instance and then deviated
upwards without any explanation for doing so.
