11/12/2021 458 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the Government's letter
motion seeking clarification on two items from the November 1, 2021 pretrial
conference. Dkt. No. 455. As to the first item, the Government seeks clarification about
the line between permissible and impermissible cross-examination for witnesses
testifying under a pseudonym. The Government's suggested level of generality as to
permissible cross-examination of the witnesses' careers would unduly curtail the
Defendant's Sixth Amendment right to meaningful cross-examination. See United States
v. Figueroa, 548 F.3d 222, 227 (2d Cir. 2008). The line of questioning the Government
identifies may be relevant to a juror's credibility determination and thus the Court will not
limit the Defendant's ability to pursue such questioning on cross-examination. As the
Court noted at the November 1 conference, the Defendant may not elicit the name of a
specific employer, but the type and genre of employment may be relevant to the jury's
assessment of credibilty. Nov. 1, 2021 Transcript at 11-12. As to the second item, the
