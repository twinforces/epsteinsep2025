Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page89 of 113:

conspiracies (Counts One and Three). There is a substantial likelihood. that the
jury believed that sexual activity that violated New York Penal Law §130.55
need not have occurred in New: York and that Maxwell. was. convicted of Count
Four based on Jane’s testimony about, sexual activity with Epstein at his ranch

Jane’s testimony about sexual abuse in. New Mexico presented the jury
with an alternative basis for conviction. that was entirely distinct from the
charges in the Indictment. The Court’s refusal to correct: the jury’s obvious
misunderstanding, constituted a constructive: amendment and/or a variance’
‘from the charges in. ‘the Indictment. Accordingly, this Court should ‘vacate
Maxwell’s convictions on. Counts Three and:Four and grant a new trial.

1. The Jury Note

During their deliberations, the jury sent a note (the “Jury Note” or the
Note”) inquiring about the proper basis. to convict under Count Four of the
Indictment (the substantive transportation. count). The Jury ‘Note read as,
‘follows:

Under Count Four (4), if the defendant aided in the transportation,

of Jane’s return flight, but not the flight to New Mexico. where/if

the intent was for Janie to engage in sexual activity, can she be
found guilty under the second element?
