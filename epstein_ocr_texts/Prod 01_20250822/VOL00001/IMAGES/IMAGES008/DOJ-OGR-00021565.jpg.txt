1 issue of the Ex Post Facto Clause being implicated. They want
2 to cast this as purely a Sixth Amendment issue and cited cases
3 along the Apprendi lines. But this is an ex post facto issue

21 that issue on an ex post facto basis. This decision about
22 whether or not the offense conduct ended at a certain time, if
23 it triggers an increase that implicates the ex post facto
24 clause is a decision for the jury to make. The government has
25 not responded to that argument, and we think that that is a
