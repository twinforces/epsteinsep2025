perjury counts after trial of the non—perjury counts is completed. Given that and in
light of the representations in the Government's April 21, 2021 letter, see Dkt. No.

(including resolution of the request for an evidentiary hearing) until after the trial on
the non-perjury counts. If either side objects, counsel shall state the basis for any
objection by letter on or before by 5pm on Thursday, April 22, 2021.SO0 ORDERED.

Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene
Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated April 20, 2021 re:
Redactions to Defense Reply Briefs and Exhibits. ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants
the Government's proposed redaction and sealing requests. This conclusion is guided
by the three—part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (1) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. The Court concludes
that these are judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law
presumptions of access attach. In balancing competing considerations against the
presumption of access, however, the Court finds that the specific arguments the
Government has put forward in this letter, including the need to protect the privacy
interests of third parties and alleged victims, favor the narrowly tailored redactions.
See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995). The Government's
letter does not discuss Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6. By April 23, 2021, the parties shall
either propose redactions to Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6, which was originally filed
under seal, or they shall indicate to the Court that they seek no redactions and file it on
ECF. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 4/22/2021) (Inl) (Entered:
