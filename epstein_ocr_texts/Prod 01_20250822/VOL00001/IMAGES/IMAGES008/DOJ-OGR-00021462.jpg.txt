Acosta,told OPR that there;was no requirement to notify the-victims because the: NPA was
“nota plea, it’s deferring'in favor‘of.a,state prosecution.” Acosta said, “[W]hether of not'vietims’
views were clicited iis something I think was the focus of the trial. team. and-not. something that I:
was focused, on at leastiat this time.” Acosta could not recall any' particular concer that-factored
into the:decision-not to:consult with the victims before entering-into.the NPA,.but he-acknowledged.
to OPR, “[C]learly, given the way it’s played out, it-inay have been itich better if we had.

As indicated, ‘the contemporancous records reflect. little about. decisions made regarding:
victim consultation. prior to when the NPA was signed. Villafana raised. the issue in writing to her
supervisors. if carly September, but ‘there is ho evidence showing whether her’ ‘supervisors
affirmatively rejected Villafaia’s contention that the USAO‘was obligated.to consult'with victims,
ignored the suggestion, or failed 'to: address it for other:reasons, possibly. because of the extended
uncertainty 3 as sto whether Epstein would: ever Pagree t to the gov ernment: s ‘plea proposal. OPR notes
passage of time affected the recall ‘of each individual. OPR interviewed. Although Villafaiia
recalled, discussions with her supervisors about notifying victims, her supervisors did. not, and.
Menchel contended that Villafana’s recollection is inaccurate.. Assuming the discussions occurred,
the'timing:is:unclear. Sloman’was on:vacation.before the NPA-was signed, so.a.call-with Villafatia.
about-victim notification at that/point:in time appears'unlikely. Ainy discussion involving Menchel,
necessarily occurred before August 3, 2007, when it'was-unclear whether the:defense would agree:
to the gov ‘ernment’s offer, Supervisors could well, haye decided:that at such an early stage, there
was little to discuss with:victims.

victims, Villafana’s recollection:suggests that the decision.arose:from supervisors’ concerns:about:
consult with. victims about. a pre-charge: disposition. That belief accurately reflected the
Department’s position at the time about application of the CVRA., Importantly, OPR.did not find
evidence establishing that the lack of consultation was for ‘the purpose of silencing victims, and
Villafana told OPR ‘that she. did not hear.any supervisor express concerns about: victims: objecting’
to the agreement if they: learned .of it. Because the subjects did not: violate any clear and
unambiguous standard in. the CVRA by ‘failing to consult With the. victims about the NPA, OPR.
concludes that. they did not engage: in professional. misconduct.

However, OPR. includes the: lack. of, consultation inJits criticism. of a series of governnient.
‘interactions with victims:that ultimately led:to public and,court condemnation ofthe government’s
treatment of the victims. Although the government, was ‘not. obligated ‘to consult with’victims, a.
more ‘straightforward and, open:approach. would, have'been consistent with. the government’s goal.
to treat ‘Victins. of crime with fairness and fespect. This was particularly important ina case in,
which.‘victims felt excluded and mistreated by the state process. Furthermore, in this: case,
consulting with the victims about a-potential plea would have given the USAO greaterinsightinto
thevictims’ willingness to support.a’prosceution of Epstein. The-consultation provision does not.

a Villafafia,told OPR.that she: was not:aware of'any“‘improper pressure or promise made;to: [Acosta] in order

to... instruct [her] not:to make:diselosures to the’victim[s].””
