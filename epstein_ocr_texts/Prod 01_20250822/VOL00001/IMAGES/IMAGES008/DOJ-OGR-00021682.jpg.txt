Lacking support in the text of the NPA itself, Max-
well attempts to show that the NPA applies here based
on “the negotiations between defendant and prosecu-
tor.” Russo, 801 F.2d at 626. In particular, Maxwell
claims that the negotiating history of the NPA shows
that “[s]Jenior levels of Main Justice were directly in-
volved in the negotiation and approval of the NPA,
even to the extent that separate presentations were
made to, and approval of the NPA was obtained from,
the Office of the Deputy Attorney General.” (Br.36).
This assertion, however, mischaracterizes the record
and further underscores the absence of any senior ap-
provals in negotiating the NPA. The pages to which
Maxwell cites describe activities after the NPA was
signed, in which Justice Department officials in Wash-
ington refused to relieve Epstein of his obligations un-
der the NPA. (Br.36 (citing SA120-238, 129-44); A.143
(“The OPR report reflects that the Office of the Deputy
Attorney General reviewed the NPA, but only after it
was signed when Epstein tried to get out of it.”)). Even
then, however, those officials did not “approve” the
NPA. (SA121 (statement by the Assistant Attorney
General that she “did not review or approve the agree-
ment either before or after it was signed”), 129 (“The
Department, however, only reviewed the issue of fed-
eral jurisdiction and never reviewed the NPA or any
specific provisions.”)). Maxwell also cobbles together
instances in which the USAO-SDFL and the FBI in
Florida enlisted the assistance of other components of
the federal government or considered acting outside
