D. PBPD Chief Reiter Becomes Concerned with the State Attorney’s Office’s

Handling of the State Investigation and Seeks a Federal Investigation

In 2006, PBPD Chief Reiter perceived that Krischer’s attitude had changed and, according

to Reiter’s statements in his 2009 deposition, Krischer said that he did not believe the victims were
credible. Reiter was disturbed when Krischer suggested that the PBPD issue a notice for Epstein
to appear in court on misdemeanor charges, leading Reiter to begin questioning Krischer’s
objectivity and the State Attorney’s Office’s approach to the case. As Reiter explained in his
deposition:

This was a case that I felt absolutely needed the attention of the State

Attorney’s Office, that needed to be prosecuted in state court. It’s

not generally something that’s prosecuted in a federal court. And I

knew that it didn’t really matter what the facts were in this case, it

was pretty clear to me that Mr. Krischer did not want to prosecute

this case.

On May 1, 2006, Reiter submitted to Krischer probable cause affidavits and a case filing
package relating to Epstein, one of his personal assistants, and a young local woman whom Epstein
first victimized and then used to recruit other girls. In his transmittal letter, which was later made
public, Reiter criticized Krischer, noting that he found the State Attorney’s Office’s “treatment of
these cases [to be] highly unusual.”!° Reiter urged Krischer “to examine the unusual course that
your office’s handling of this matter has taken” and to consider disqualifying himself from
prosecuting Epstein. ‘7
I. THE FBI AND THE USAO INVESTIGATE EPSTEIN, AND THE DEFENSE

TEAM ENGAGES WITH THE USAO

A. May 2006 — February 2007: The Federal Investigation Is Initiated, and the

USAO Opens a Case File

In early 2006, a West Palm Beach FBI Special Agent who worked closely with
AUSA Ann Marie Villafafia on child exploitation cases—and who is referred to in this Report as
“the case agent”—mentioned to Villafafia in “casual conversations” having learned that the PBPD
was investigating a wealthy Palm Beach man who recruited minors for sexual activity. The case
agent told Villafafia that the PBPD had reached out to the FBI because the State Attorney’s Office
was considering either not charging the case or allowing the defendant to plead to a misdemeanor
Is Fla. Stat. § 905.27 (2007).

i As noted, Krischer generally declined in his OPR interview to explain his office’s prosecutive decisions;
however, regarding allegations of favoritism to Epstein’s defense counsel, Krischer told OPR, “I just don’t play that
way.”
