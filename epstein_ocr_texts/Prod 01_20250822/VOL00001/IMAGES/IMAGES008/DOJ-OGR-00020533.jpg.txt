re: Proposed Redactions. ENDORSEMENT: The Court has reviewed the proposed
redactions and finds that they are narrowly tailored and necessary to protect the
privacy and identities of third parties not identified on the record in this case. The
intended recipients of the subpoenas did not file proposed redactions by September 1,
2021, per this Court's August 23 Order. Dkt. No. 325. The Court accordingly
ORDERS Defendant to file the redacted Motion and Exhibits 1, 3, and 4, and
unredacted Exhibit 2, by September 7, 2021. The Court hereby unseals the August 13
Opinion, and the Court will file the Opinion on the public docket. (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 9/2/2021) (ap) (Entered: 09/03/2021)

09/03/2021 | 335 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court ORDERS that at the same time that the

statements it intends to offer at trial no later than October 11, as consistent with this

Maxwell. (Attachments: # 1 Exhibit 1, #2 Exhibit 2, #3 Exhibit 3, # 4 Exhibit

10/05/2021 | 337 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is currently in the process of planning
logistics for trial in this matter and requires the parties' best and current estimate of
length of trial. The Court plans to have the jury sit 5 days a week from 9am until 5pm.
Given that jury selection will be complete by November 19 and opening statements
will occur on November 29, the Court requests that the parties provide their best
estimate as to when the jury is likely to begin deliberations. This will allow the Court
to assess the likelihood that trial may continue after the Christmas holiday and
therefore whether the jury may be required to sit some days during the week between
Christmas and New Year's Day. Accordingly, on or before October 12, 2021, the
parties are ORDERED to confer and submit a joint letter with their best and current
estimate as to when the jury is likely to begin deliberations. SO ORDERED. (Signed
