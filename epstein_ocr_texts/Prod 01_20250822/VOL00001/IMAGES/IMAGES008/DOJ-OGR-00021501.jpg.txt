3. Epstein shall waive all challenges to the Information filed by the State
Attorney’s Office and shall waive the right to appeal his conviction and
sentence.

4, Epstein agrees that, if any of the victims identified in the federal
investigation file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein will not
contest the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of Florida over his person and/or the subject matter, and Epstein will not
contest that the identified victims are persons who, while minors, were
victims of violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections(s) 2422
and/or 2423.

5. The United States shall provide Epstein’s attorneys with a list of the
identified victims, which will not exceed forty, after Epstein has signed
this agreement and entered his guilty plea. The United States shall make
a motion with the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Florida for the appointment of a guardian ad litem for the identified
victims and Epstein’s counsel may contact the identified victims through
that counsel.

6. Epstein shall enter his guilty plea and be sentenced not later than
September 28, 2007, and shall begin service of his sentence not later than
October 15, 2007.

By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that each of these terms is
material to this agreement and is supported by independent consideration and that a breach of
any one of these conditions allows the United States to elect to terminate the agreement and to
investigate and prosecute Epstein for any and all federal offenses.

By signing this agreement, Epstein asserts and certifies that he is aware of the fact that
the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides that in all criminal
prosecutions the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial. Epstein further is
aware that Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that the Court may
dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint for unnecessary delay in presenting a charge to
the Grand Jury, filing an information, or in bringing a defendant to trial. Epstein hereby
requests that the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida defer such
prosecution. Epstein agrees and consents that any delay from the date of this Agreement to the
date of initiation of prosecution, as provided for in the terms expressed herein, shall be deemed
to be a necessary delay at his own request, and he hereby waives any defense to such prosecution
on the ground that such delay operated to deny him rights under Rule 48(b) of the Federal Rules
of Criminal Procedure and the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States to a
speedy trial or to bar the prosecution by reason of the running of the statute of limitations for a
period of months equal to the period between the signing of this agreement and the breach of this
