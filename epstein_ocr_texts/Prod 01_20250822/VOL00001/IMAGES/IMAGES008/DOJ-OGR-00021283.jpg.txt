Lefkowitz sect forth arguments similar to those Sanchez ‘had presented. to: Lourie,. as to. why
registration “based.on the facts alleged in'this case... simply does hot-make sense.” In.the event:
that Acosta did not: agree to their proposed charges, ‘Lefkowitz offered:as:an alternative “to stipulate.
that the.state offense” would “constitute a prior séxual offense ‘for purposes of enhanced recidivist:
sentencing” should Epstein ever again commit-a federal sex offense against:minors: As' Lefkowitz.
further argtied, “By accepting this option, you would, be, substituting the certainty’ of recidivist:
sentencing for the humiliation of registration. * Emails:reflect that, carly that afternoon, Acosta,
Louric, and Villafatia:discussed-the matter in a conference call.

Lefkowitz also sent a:revised version.of the: NPA to Villafaiia that omitted identification-of,
the chargé to which Epstein would plead guilty: Later that day, Lefkowitz emailed Acosta?

I gota call from [MJarie: who said, you had rejected ‘our proposal.

Does that.mean you are not-even prepared to have. [Epstein] commit.
now to plead to the registerable offense near the end of his 18 month
‘sentence and.then be sentenced ‘to 1:2 month[s] community control
for that:charge? J.thought that was: exactly what you proposed
[FJriday (although:you wanted, but’ were not-able, to-do it with some
kind of federal charge).

But that ‘still. gives you.a registerable sex offense, 30 months total,
and 18 in jail.

How. can.that:not: satisfy you—while still. ensuring. that [E]pstein is
not unduly éndangered in jail?

Acosta, responded, “I. do not :mean to be difficult, but: our negotiations must: take place: with the
AUSAs assigned. to the case.” Acosta added:that he had spoken with Lourie and Villafana, and
they had. “discretion to proceed.as they believe: just and appropriate.” Acosta ‘copied Villafana,
and she emailed Acosta'to thank:him, “for the support.”

L. The Defense, Adds a Confidentiality Clause

Throughout. ‘that Sunday cyening, Lefkowitz had numerous email exchanges with.
Villafana, and apparently-a conference call with Lourie (who-was returning to Washington, D.C.)
and Villafaia. Later that evening; Lefkowitz-sent Villafatia.a new version of the NPA that, for the
first time, included a confidentiality term:

It is the::intention of the. parties to this Agreement ‘that it not be

disseminated. 0 ‘or disclosed except pursuant to ‘court. order. In the

a request, pursuant to ‘the Freedom of Information “Act, ‘the

Goyernment agiees ‘to provide Epstein notice before the disclosure

ofthis Agreement.

After making. additional. revisions, Villafafia sent this. NPA to Acosta and Louric:‘as. the:

“final” version, asking Acosta to: let her know what he thought of it. Among her revisions, she
changed the confidentiality provision to the: following:
