order to resolve the motion at this stage, the Court would have to accept these unsworn
statements made to media outlets as true and reach factual determinations that are not available
on the current record.

Accordingly, a hearing is necessary to resolve the Defendant’s motion. The Court
concludes, and the Government concedes, that the demanding standard for holding an
evidentiary hearing is met as to Juror 50’s answer to Question 48 of the questionnaire. The
Court further concludes that Juror 50’s response to Question 25 is relevant to the inquiry.
Following trial, Juror 50 made several direct, unambiguous statements to multiple media outlets
about his own experience that do not pertain to jury deliberations and that cast doubt on the
accuracy of his responses to Questions 25 and 48. Such statements are “clear, strong, substantial
and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropriety”—namely a false
statement during jury selection—has occurred. To be clear, the potential impropriety is not that
someone with a history of sexual abuse may have served on the jury. Rather, it is the potential
failure to respond truthfully to questions during the jury selection process that asked for that
material information so that any potential bias could be explored. Conversely, the demanding
standard for ordering an evidentiary hearing is not met as to Juror 50’s use of social media nor
the conduct of any other juror. The Court therefore ORDERS a hearing take place at which the
Court will question Juror 50 under oath. The Defendant’s request for a broader hearing and pre-
hearing discovery is DENIED.
