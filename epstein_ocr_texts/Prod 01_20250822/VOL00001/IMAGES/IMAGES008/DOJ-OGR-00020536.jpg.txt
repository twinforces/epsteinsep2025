10/22/2021 | 364 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: For the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's
conference, the Court will implement the following procedures for jury selection: A
screening questionnaire will be administered on November 4, 5, and 12. The Clerk's
Office will create a corresponding list of names and randomly assigned juror numbers.
The list will be provided to counsel and the Court for use throughout jury selection.
Jurors will be identified on the questionnaire and in court throughout the process by
their assigned number only. Completed questionnaires will be copied and distributed
to defense counsel by the U.S. Attorney's Office. After reviewing the completed
questionnaires, counsel must confer in good faith and jointly submit four lists: (1)
prospective jurors that both sides agree should proceed to voir dire; (2) prospective
jurors that both sides agree should be excused; (3) prospective jurors that the defense,
but not the Government believes should be excused; and (4) prospective jurors that the
Government, but not the defense believes should be excused. Lists for questionnaires
completed on November 4 and 5 will be due to the Court via email by November 7.
Lists for questionnaires completed on November 12 will be due to the Court via email
by November 13. If necessary, there will be an in-person conference on November 15
at 9:30 a.m. to resolve any disputes. Voir dire will proceed on November 16-19. The
Court will conduct one-on-one voir dire with each prospective juror in the presence
of the parties and with public access to the proceeding. At the conference, both sides
indicated the potential need for additional procedures during voir dire under certain
circumstances. See Transcript at 1011. As the Court indicated, it will consider
proposed narrowly tailored measures that may be necessary during voir dire on a
case—by—case basis. See id. at 12. The Court will decide in due course whether the
exercise of peremptory strikes will proceed on November 19 or November 29. The
Court implements these procedures taking into account the significant publicity this
case has garnered, the nature of the charges, and the District's COVID—19 protocols.
These procedures are carefully balanced and tailored to ensure the safety of the parties
and prospective jurors in light of the continuing pandemic; to ensure juror candor,
impartiality, and privacy; and to ensure the First Amendment right to public access of
criminal proceedings. Also for the reasons stated on the record at yesterday's
conference, the request to seal the parties' proposed questionnaire and voir dire and the
Court's draft questionnaire and voir dire until after jury selection is completed is
denied. Although the Court has and will continue to implement tailored measures to
ensure a fair trial despite significant media interest, see Dkt. Nos. 28, 81, 95, 99, 101,
232, 241, 284, 301, 315, the defense did not justify sealing the entirety of the proposed
and draft questionnaires and voir dire. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435
F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court's planned individual voir dire process is designed
to carefully probe the prior exposure to and the potential influence of any pre-trial
media. As noted at the conference, the parties may continue to propose for the Court's
consideration, any appropriate and tailored procedures in light of the specific factors
related to this case and upcoming trial. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
