Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page42 of 113:

(U.S. Tax Ct. Mar. 13, 2014) (same); U.S. ¥. Oruche, 25.7 F.Supp.2d 230, 239 n.7
(D.D.C. 2003) (same, for federal. immunity agreement); see also Samra v. Shaheen
Bus. & Inv. Grp., Inc., 355 F.Supp.2d 483 (D-D.C. 2005) (emphasizing that, in
“constru[ing] an immunity agreement executed. during a, criminal prosecution, our
court. [does] not simply adopt the. ‘contract law of. the District of Columbia as a
default,” but will instead follow “choice of law rules”). “The Restatement
(Second) of Conflict of Laws, to which. both New York and the federal. courts. look,
declares that courts will apply the laws of the state that ‘has. the most significant
relationship to the transaction. and the parties.’” John Wiley:& Sons, Inc. v. DPRK
Photo, 882 F.3d.394, 412, (2d Cir. 2018) (quoting Restatement § 188). Here, it is
clear that the Second. Circuit is not the jurisdiction. with the most significant
relationship to the NPA, and. the Government has not argued, otherwise. Instead,
the court should have construed,the NPA: under Eleventh, Circuit: law.

The Eleventh Circuit would hold that the NPA’s promise on behalf of “the
United States” not to prosecute Epstein’s “potential, co-conspirators” (including
Defendant) is binding on other USAOs. That is because, under Eleventh. Circuit
precedent, even if the reference to “the United States” were deemed ambiguous,
the ambiguity “must be read against the government.” U/S. v. Jefferies, 908
