false answers on the questionnaire. A326. The juror, through counsel, invoked his
Fifth Amendment privilege and was granted immunity by the Government to the

jury questionnaire were inadvertent. Hence, there was no reasonable basis upon
which to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege as he was not admitting to having
made intentionally false statements, and his exposure to a perjury charge existed

only the veneer of credibility. The court repeatedly noted that the immunity deal
provided Juror 50 “a strong incentive to testify truthfully” (A333, A336, A340),
when in fact it provided only a strong incentive to offer testimony that would satisfy
the Government’s interest in preserving the verdict.

false answers to these questions and only these questions. These were the questions
