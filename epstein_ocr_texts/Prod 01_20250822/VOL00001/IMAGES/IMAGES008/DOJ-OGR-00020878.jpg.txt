During the trial Scotty, who works in finance, was seated in the third row of the jury box, in the back corner. From his vantage

point, he said; he had a vista‘of the entire court and the ‘perfect view’ of Maxwell herself

During the trial Scotty, who'works:in finance, was
Seated in'the-third row of the jury'box, inthe back
of the entire court and the ‘perfect view’ of Maxwell
herself:

He:recalled,.'I:could literally see her [all the-time]. There
‘were’ times'when it felt like she was staring right at me:

‘She:was constantly taking notes,.and constantly
passing post-it notes over'to her attorneys especially.
when they:were on cross examination.”

At times, hé:said,I felt like she was watching what we
‘wereé-doing because'there were timés when some
jurors, not during when the.victims presented their
testimony, but when certain other people:presented’on
things that maybe’they didn't'feel mattered...some:
people would nod.off.'

Scotty sdid‘that Maxwell's manner in Gourt:was
discussed during deliberations. He said, ‘We did discuss
that we thought she:was alittle standoffish and not
necessarily cold; more.like she was paying attention.’

Inaninsight that will surely; come as a‘gut blow to
Maxwell herself, who reportedly wanted to testify but’
‘Was:advised against.it, Scotty revealed that if she had
taken'the stand;It would have. shown maybe that she
was:a little more human.

‘Maybe if'she gave her-version of the'story,:who knows,
maybe if she gave-us a story‘of how she was
been an.adimission | feel like of guilt.

Jurors’were instructed not'to:draw:any: inference. of guilt:

‘or otherwise:from Maxwell's decision not:to testify. and,
Scotty said, it'was’simply’setto'one side‘and not
‘discussed during deliberations.

Asked if-at any stage, he had experienced any
sympathy for Maxwell he.said; ‘Absolutely.: Because this
is the‘rest of her life, right? We-were’deciding what
happens based off the evidence provided.

have to:really comb. through the evidence and make
:sure:we have:enough proof to-say that she's either guilty
‘or not.’

David told The.Indépendent he found.all the accusers to
be crédible,.despite the defence’s:attacks on their’
stories and:memories..

How Maxwell could claim
amistrial after juror
reveals he was victim of
child sex abuse and
shared his experience.
with the jury

Ghislaine Maxwell could lodge‘a‘claim of mistrial after it
emerged one.of-the jurors who convicted her was a
victim of child sex abuse:

Scotty: David said he had helped the other members of
the jury understand things from a victim's point of view.

He also claimed the five guilty verdicts returned last
week, possibly condemning Maxwell to spend the rest of
her life behind bars, were for ‘all the victims’:

David said that after he revealed his ordeal, another
juror:came forward with.to share that they too had been
sexually abused,

Legal experts said that if David failed to disclose his past
@xperiénces before.the jury deliberations, Maxwell could
have grounds to claim a mistrial and have her
convictions quashed.

Moira Penza,.a former federal prosecutor in Néw York,
said::'l certainly. hope the juror disclosed this fully on his:
questionnaire.

‘A little strange the defence didn't'strike him: It. could
definitely be an issue:;

‘In the first instance it would likely form the basis for a
motion to Jiidge [Alison] Nathan for a new trial.’
However, the question of whether a potential juror was a
victim of sexual abuse or‘a relative.or friend of a victim
was asked in the 50-question questionnaire completed
by each juror ahead of selection:

Scotty:could not remember that question when asked by
DailyMail.com but-was certain that he had answered all
questions honestly.
