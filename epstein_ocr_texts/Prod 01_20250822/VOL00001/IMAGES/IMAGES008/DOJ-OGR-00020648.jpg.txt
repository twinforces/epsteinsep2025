03/18/2021 168 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants' twelve pretrial motions. It filed the
brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the Court's
resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See Dkt. No. 162.
On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions that the
Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having considered
the parties' respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's requests for
redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction requests, with the
exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the Governments request to file
Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that transcript have been redacted, other
portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, Case No. 15-cv-7433, Dkt.
No. 1212-1. In light of this, the Court sees no basis to file the transcript entirely under
seal rather than by redacting the relevant portions. In light of the above, the Government
is hereby ORDERED to either docket on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits,
consistent with this Order, or to file a letter with the Court justifying more tailored
redaction and sealing requests regarding pages 1128 and 187188 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by
no later than March 22, 2021. The parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and
jointly propose redactions to the Defendant's cover letter objecting to the Government's
proposed redactions by March 22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet,
confer, and propose redactions to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March
22, 2021 (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/18/21)Gw) (Entered: 03/18/2021)

03/22/2021 169 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's third motion for
release on bail, Dkt. No. 160, is DENIED. The parties are ORDERED to meet and confer
and propose and justify any redactions to the Defendant's reply brief by March 24, 2021.
If they conclude that redactions are unnecessary, the Defendant is ORDERED to docket
the unredacted version of the brief by March 24, 2021. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan
