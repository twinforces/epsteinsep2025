obligated to:amend ‘her prior letter to victims: to correct: the reference ‘to the December Ictter.*”°
Accordingly, ‘the September Jetter contained no: information about. the partics’ intent. in.
implementing 18 UIS.C. $2255, but merely: referred to the NPA : language concerning, Epstein’ ‘S
waiver of his fight. to contest liability under the provision. Ii addition, the. September letter
‘described. the. appointment of a Special: master, the special master’s selection: of ‘an attorney ‘to
represent the. wiétims in v their 18 U: S. CS § 2255 litigation against. Epstein, and Epstein: S. agreement

Epstein’ S agreement to pay: for. attorneys’ fees did not, extend to conitested litigation against: him.

The: government also intended for the letter:to comply with the court’s: order concerning.
providing victims with, copies of the: NPA. The initial draft included a, paragraph advising the
victims that.they could-reeeive a copy of the NPA:

available to: any designated victim. (and/or her. attorney) a copy of
the actual agreement between.Mr. Epstein and the United States, so
long,as‘the victim (and/or her attorney):reviews, signs, and agrees:to
be bound. by:a.Protective Order entered. by the ‘Court. If [the victim]
would like to review the Agreement, please let me-know, and I will.
forward. a copy of the Protective Ordc# for her signature.

The government, shared draft versions of the September letter with Epstein’s: counsel and.
responded to criticism’ of the content-of the proposed letter. For example, inresponse: to the-above
language regarding the: August: 21, 2008 court order ‘in the CVRA litigation, the defense argued.
that there-was “no court.order requiring'the: government to provide the alleged, ‘victims’ with notice
that the [NPA] is available‘to themrupon-request and.doing so is in conflict withthe confidentiality
provisions of the (NPA].” In ‘response, -and ‘in. consultation with USAO management, Villafata,
revised the paragr: aph as: follows:

two other. victims regarding the disclosure. of the entire agreement.
between, the United. States and.Mr. Epstein. [The attorney selected.
by the special master] :can‘providefurther guidance on this issue, or:
if you select another attorney to represent. you, that. attorney ‘can.
review the:Court’s order inthe [CVRA litigation].

On, September 18, 2009, a‘state court,judge unsealed the: copy of the NPA that had been.
filed in the state case.*”7
