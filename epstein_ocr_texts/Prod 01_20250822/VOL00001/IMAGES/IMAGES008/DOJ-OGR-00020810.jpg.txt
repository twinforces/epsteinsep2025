Ghislaine Maxwell,
OPINION & ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

On April 16, 2021, the Court issued an Opinion & Order granting in part and denying in
part Ghislaine Maxwell’s various pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the
Government’s (S1) superseding indictment and compel discovery. Prior to the issuance of that
Opinion & Order but after the motions were fully briefed, a grand jury returned a second (S2)
superseding indictment adding a sex trafficking count and sex trafficking conspiracy count. The
Court did not address the new charges in the April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order. On May 25,
2021, Maxwell filed another round of pretrial motions seeking to dismiss the $2 indictment in
whole or in part and to compel discovery. Dkt. No. 292, 293. For appeal preservation purposes
or otherwise, the arguments largely, though not entirely, rehash the positions rejected by the
Court in its April 16, 2021 Opinion & Order. To the extent new arguments are made, they are
addressed below. All pending motions are DENIED. The Court provides a brief summary of its
conclusions here and its reasoning on the pages that follow:

° Maxwell moves to dismiss counts one, three, five, and six as barred by Jeffrey
Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement. The Court again concludes, as it did in its April
16, 2021 Opinion & Order, that the agreement does not bind the United States Attorney
for the Southern District of New York.
