indictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal charges were not appropriate and
defense counsel’s efforts to minimize the amount of time Epstein would spend in jail, it is
questionable whether Epstein would have accepted such a plea offer, but the USAO did not even
extend the offer to determine what his response to it would be.

Weighed against possible loss at trial were some clear advantages to a negotiated resolution
that ensured a conviction, including sexual offender registration and the opportunity to establish a
mechanism for the victims to recover damages. These advantages, added to Acosta’s concern
about intruding on the state’s authority, led him to the conclusion that a two-year state plea would
be sufficient to prevent manifest injustice. Menchel told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the
time that this resolution was entered into was looking at the two years as a fair result in terms of
the conduct. I think that was not the issue. The issue was whether or not if we took this case to
trial, would we risk losing everything?”

During the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept
a plea for an 18-month sentence, a reduction of six months from the original “non-negotiable” two-
year term. The subjects did not have a clear memory of why this reduction was made. Villafafia
attributed it to a conversation between Acosta and Lefkowitz, but Acosta attributed it to a decision
made during the negotiating process by Villafafia and Lourie, telling OPR that he understood his
attorneys needed flexibility to reach a final deal with Epstein.

OPR found no contemporaneous documents showing the basis for the two-year term.
Despite extensive subject interviews and review of thousands of contemporaneous records, OPR
was unable to determine who initially proposed the two-year term of incarceration or why that
term, as opposed to other possible and lengthier terms, was settled on for the initial offer. The
term was not tied to statutory or guidelines sentences for potential federal charges or, as far as
OPR could determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO initially informed the
defense that the two-year term was “non-negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that position and
rather than a “floor” for negotiations, it became a “ceiling” that was further reduced during the
negotiations. OPR was unable to find any evidence indicating that the term of incarceration was
tied either to the federal interest in seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, or to other
traditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, either of Epstein or other offenders of similar
crimes. Instead, as previously noted, it appears that Acosta primarily considered only a
punishment that was somewhat more than that to which the state had agreed. As a result, the
USAO had little room to maneuver during the negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling to
enforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term of incarceration
that was not much more than what the state had initially sought and which was significantly
disproportionate to the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.

In sum, it is evident that Acosta’s desire to resolve the federal case against Epstein led him
to arrive at a target term of incarceration that met his own goal of serving as a “backstop” to the
state, but that otherwise was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis. In assessing the case
only through the lens of providing a “backstop” to the state, Acosta failed to consider the need for
a punishment commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct and the federal interest in
addressing it.
