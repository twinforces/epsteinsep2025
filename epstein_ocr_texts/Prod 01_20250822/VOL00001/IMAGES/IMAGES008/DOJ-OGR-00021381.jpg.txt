‘indictment. Given Epstein’s continued insistence that federal, charges, were: not appropriate and
defense counsel’s efforts.'to minimize. the amount, of time: Epstein. would spend in jail, it is
questionable whether Epstein would. have accepted: such a plea offer, but the’ USAO did:not even
extend the offer'to determine what his response to.it would be..

Weighed against:possible loss at‘trial-;were some clear advantages to a‘negotiated resolution.
that ensured a conviction, including sexual offender‘registration and the opportunity to establish. a,
mechanism. for the victims ‘to recover damages. These: advantages, added to Acosta’s concern.
about:intruding:on,the state’s authority, led him/to the conclusion that, a. two-year state plea would
be sufficient to: prevent manifest injustice.. Menchel. told OPR, “I don’t believe anybody at the
tine that this resolution was. entered into was' looking atthe two ‘years’ as a fair result if terns of.
the conduct. I: think that was:not the issue. The: issue:was whether or-not if we:took this case to
trial, would we risk losing everything?”

During:the course of negotiations over a potential federal plea, the USAO agreed to accept:
aplea for‘an | 8-imonth sentence, a reduction ofisix months from the:original, “non-negotiable” two-
yearterm. Theisubjects did not have.a:clear. memory. of:why this; reduction. was made. Villafatia
‘attributed ‘it'to-a-conversation, between Acosta and Lefkowitz, but Acosta attributed.itto a decision,
made during the negotiating process: by. Villafaiia and Lourie, telling OPR.that:he understood _his:
attorneys needed flexibility to reach.a-final deal ‘with Epstein.

‘OPR. found, no: contemporaneous documents ‘showing: the basis for the two-year term.
Despite extensive ‘subject interviews and review of thousands of -contemporancous records, OPR.
was unable to ‘determine: who initially. proposed. the two-year term of*incarceration. or why. that:
term, as opposed to other possible and lengthier ‘terms, ‘was ‘settled ‘on for the initial offer, The
term was not tied to statutory or guidelines, sentences for potential. federal. charges: or, :as: far as
OPR could-determine, possible state charges. Furthermore, while the USAO: initially informed. the
defense that. the two- -ycar term. was “non- negotiable,” Acosta failed to enforce that: ‘position and
rather than, a “floor” ‘for’ negotiations, it becanie:.a “eciling” that was: further reduced during the
negotiations. OPR was-unable to -find any: evidence: indicating that the:term. of incarceration was
tied cither to ‘the federal interestiin seeking a just sentence for a serial sexual offender, orto other
traditional sentencing factors such as deterrence, cither of Epstein. or other offenders of similar
erimés. Instead, as previously foted, it appears. that. Acosta primarily considered. only a.
punishment that was somewhat ‘more than, that. to which the state: had agreed. As a result, the
USAO-had little room-to maneuver during the: negotiations and because Acosta was unwilling:to
enforce the “non-negotiable” initial offer, the government ended up with a term. of ‘incarceration
that was not much.:more: ‘than what the state had initially sought and which. was significantly
disproportionate to'the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct.

Insti, it is evident-that Acosta’s desiré to resolve'the federal cast against Epstein led.him
to arrive at a target-term. of incarceration that.met. his own goal of serving as a “backstop” to the:
state, » but that otherwise Was untethered to any articulable, reasonable basis., In assessing the case
a punishment:commensurate with the seriousness of Epstein’s conduct:and the federal interest: in
