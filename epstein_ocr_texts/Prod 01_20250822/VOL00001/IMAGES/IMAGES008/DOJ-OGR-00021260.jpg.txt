was willing ‘to join a inecting with the defense: although he, could not-do:so in-person watil after
August 21, he was willing to participate by phone in order “to stay firm on..our August 17th.
deadline.” Villafaiia, also ‘reiterated:that, she wanted to contact.Epstein’s assistants in. New York:
and to interview some of Epstein’s-colleagues and former employces there. Noting that.“there.was
some: concern about [taking the: proposed investigative steps] while: we are ‘trying to negotiate a.
plea,” Villafana asked Acosta for guidance. Lourie also emailed. Acosta and, Sloman, asking that:
the USAO “stick ‘to our deadline if possible.” Lourie pointed ‘out that CEOS “has :no: approval.
authority” and opined. it was “a bit. extreme to allow the defense to keep arguing this [case] to
different agencies. * Acosta replied, “This will.end up [at the | Department] anyhow, if we don’t
feet with them, I?d rather RED ‘ithere: Brin[gling [the Chief of CEOS] in visibly does so. Ifour

reluctant to: delay’ the litigation ; and reported 'to Lourie ‘that: agents recently had. interviewed a girl,

On August: 13, 2007, Villafaita advised Black that-the USAO was not willitig to agree to a stay of
the: litigation. However, Sanchez reached out to Lourie on August .22, 2007, and obtained his
agreciment-to a joint request fora.stay untilthe week after Acosta’s mecting With defense counsel,
which-was scheduled for. September 7,:2007.

Villafana told OPR. that, in her opinion, the defense efforts to ‘put off the litigation.
coneerning'the computers’was““‘further. evidence of the Importance‘of [this]:evidence.””’ Villafatia
suspected, the computers contained evidence that “would have put this case completely to bed.”

NPA or‘ils terms, ‘he:did have-concerns: that the: Department would decidesthe USAO should not have accepted ‘the
case’ because ofa: lack-of federal interest and might direct the ESAO to end its invelyement in-the-matter.

a ‘Menchel ‘told OPR; on ‘the-other hand, “there; could be: a,lot of reasons why” defense. counsel would resist:
