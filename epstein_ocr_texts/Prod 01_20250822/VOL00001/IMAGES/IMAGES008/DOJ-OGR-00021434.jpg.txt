Villafana told-OPR that before the state plea hearing, she sent Reitera list of the victims,
including their telephone numbers, to notify.and asked hii to, destroy the list. Villafana recalled
that Reiter told ‘her that he would “try to contact as: many as he could” and.that:he would ‘destroy
thelist afterwards. Villafana.did not recall .being™“asked [to] provide a list:of.all our'victims to the
State Attorney’s Office.”

In, his 2009 deposition, Reiter stated ‘that. Villafania. sent. him:a. letter “around the time of.
sentencing,” listing the victims: in-the federal :investigation, and that she asked, him. to destroy. the
letter:after he reviewed.it. Reiter recalled that. he ‘requested;the list: because he was aware that the
state grand. jury’ s: indictment. of Epstein. did not ‘include. all. of the victims that the PBPD. had
identified and. he “wanted to make sure ‘that: some: prosecution. body had considered all of our

victims.?*?

In, her 2017 declaration in. the CVRA litigation, Villafatia stated. that she and. the PBPD
“attempted. to: notify the victims: about [the June 30] hearing: in-the short time: available to us.”°*4

In,her 2008 declaration, however, Villafana conceded that “all known, victims were not, notified.”

Villafana told OPR. that: Edwards was the only. victiti attomey. she was authorized to
‘contact—she thought probably. by Sloman—about the: June 30, 2008:plea hearing because-Edwards
“had expressed. a specific. interest! in the outcome.” Villafana recalled, “I was told that I could.
inform [Edwards] of [the plea. date], but I'still. couldn’t inform him of the’ NPA.” In her 2008
declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafaiia stated.that:she called, Edwards and informed him of
the: plea hearing scheduled for Monday: Villafana. stated ‘that. Edwards told her that he could. not.
attend. ‘the. hearing ‘but: “someone” would. be ‘present. In a later filing, in the CVRA. litigation,
however, Edwards asserted that Villafana’told him only’ that, “Epstein: was pleading guilty to state
solicitation of prostitution charges involving, other victims—not. ‘Mr. Edwards’ clients norany of.
the ‘federally-identified victims. “350 Edwards further’ claimed, that because Villafatia, failed ‘to.
‘inform him that the * ‘guilty pleas in'state court would bring an end to the: possibility of federal.
prosecution pursuant to the: plea. -agreement, his. clients did. notiattend, the hearing. Villafana told
OPR. that her expectation. was that the state plea pr oceeding would allow. Edwards and his clients
the abilityto comment on the-resoliition:

Reiter’ show: ed the letter:to*the:lead-Detective so he could “confirm thatvall-ofthe'v ictims’that wechad‘for'the
ase? incltided oi that.” The Détective.“looked.at inaiid he said they” té-all there.and ‘then [Reiter] de ye
The Detective: recalled viewing the list in Reiter's office; but he: could, not:recall when‘Reiter'showed it to:him.

SM The EBL co-case agent:told OPR.that“I:don‘tthink’the [FBI] reached out*to-aityotic.””

Villafafia ‘told-OPR. that she thotight {hat it was ‘Sloman who gave her the instiuctions, but she: could not:
“remember the; speciticsofthe-conversation.””

356 Villafaiia,stated thatshe “never told Attorney Edwards that the state charges involved “other victims,” and
neither the state Court Charging: instrument nor the factual profterlimitedthée.proctirément of prostitution charve to a.
specific victim.” Although Edwards criticized Villafafia’s conduct: in his CVRA: filings; in his :recently-published.
book, Edwards described. Villatana as ‘a “kindhearted: prosecutor who tried to. do-right” nétiig that'she * ‘béliev [éd].in
the victims;and_tr[ied] .... ‘to bring-down Jefirey Epstein.” Bradley“J..Edwards with Brittany Henderson, Relentless
