run_ afoul of ‘familiar considerations.of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled
expectations.’” Jhom-'v. Ashcroft, 369. F.3d 158, 163-n.6 (2d Cir. 2004) (Calabresi,
J., majority opinion. but “[s]peaking only for [him]self”) (quoting Landgraf, 511
U.S. at 270).

The. authority cited. by the District: Court is not to the contrary. In. Vernon v.
Cassadaga Valley ‘Cent. Sch. Dist. 49 F.3d 886 (2d Cir. 1995), a civil case, the

because it was, procedural. id. at 89.1, Butin /nterprise, Judge Cabranes—writing
for a unanimous Court—retreated altogether from. !’ernon’s prior characterization
of statutes of limitations as purely “procedural.” As Judge Cabranes wrote, Vernon
“did not create.a categorical exception. [for'statutes of limitations] from Landgraf’s
presumption against retroactive application. of legislation.” 391 F.3d at 409. Most

Ninth Circuits, which—in, tension. with. the Third Circuit’s. reasoning jin
Richardson,—concluded. that §3283 can, be applied retroactively. See U.S. v. Leo

Sure Chief, 438 F.3d 920 (9th Cir. 2006); U.S. v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d 682. (8th Cir.
