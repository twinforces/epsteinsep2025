Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page27 of 113

The Government announced its arrest of Maxwell on July 2, 2020, the
anniversary of Epstein’s indictment. From that day, Maxwell was held in solitary
confinement in the Brooklyn Detention Center. As COVID raged, the District
Court denied four bail applications and dozens of applications to ameliorate
Maxwell’s deplorable conditions of confinement. By the time of trial, Maxwell
was so disoriented and diminished that she was unable meaningfully to assist in her
own defense, much less to testify.

As trial approached, the vilification of Maxwell was unprecedented in both
scale and severity. The bipartisan political pressure to obtain a conviction was
enormous. Judge Nathan refused to apply the NPA to Maxwell in accordance with
its terms and refused to dismiss the case as time-barred. She precluded Maxwell
from presenting a meaningful defense by excluding evidence and argument that
was central to her defense, such as the NPA, the 2006 FBI investigation, the terms
of the VCP, and the direct involvement of the complainants’ civil attorneys in both
the VCP and the Government’s investigation.

The trial itself involved the testimony of four women, three of whom (Jane,
Kate, and Carolyn), were permitted to testify under pseudonyms. The result
transformed the trial into a form of Kabuki theater designed to remind the jury at
every turn that these adult women were being protected because their privacy
interests, and not Maxwell’s constitutional right to a public trial, were paramount.
