letters to victims sent after‘the NPA was signed. were not:misleading in.stating that the matter was
“under investigation” ‘because ‘the : government continued to investigate given its uncertainty that:
Epstein: would. plead guilty: and (3) Villafaiia contacted. the: petitioners” attorney’ prior to Epstein? Ss:
state plea ‘to advise him, of the hearing. Nonetheless, Villafaiia told OPR: ‘that, while there. were
valid reasons. for the government’s position that CVRA rights do not apply: pre= charge, * ‘[T]his is
a case, Where I ‘felti we should have done more than what was’ legally required. I was obviously
prepared.to spend.as much time,,.energy and:effort.necessary to mect.with.each and-every. [victim].”

Over the course’ of the litigation, ‘the district, court: made various rulings interpreting the
provisions of the GVRA, including the court’s: key conclusion that victim CVRA rights “attach.
before the Government brings foriial charges against a defendant.” The court also: held. that;
(1) “the GVRA. authorizes the rescission or. ‘reopening* ofa: ‘prosecutor ial. agreement, including: a
fon-prosecution agreement, reached:in.violation of aprosecutor’s conferral obligations under the
statute”; (2) the CVRA. authorizes the setting. aside: of pre-charge: prosecutorial agreements”;
(3) the CVRA’S “reasonable, Fight to confer” “extends: to the pre-charge state of criminal
investigations and proceedings”; (4) the alleged. federal. sex crimes committed by Epstein ‘render
the Doe petitioners “victims” under the CVRA; and. (5) “questions pertaining to [the] equitable:
defense[s] are properly left for resolution after dev elopment of a full evidentiary. record.”

On February 21, 2019, the. district. court granted the petitioners’ Motion for Partial.
Summary: Judgment, ruling: that “once the Government failed to advise the victims: about: its
intention to enter into thé NPA, a ‘violation. of the GVRA occurred.” The government did not
dispute the: fact that it did. not confer with.the petitioners. prior to signing: the NPA, and. the court.
concluded that “[a]tia bare imihinum, the CVRA required the Government to inforin Petitioners.
that itintended.to enter‘into-an agreement 1 not-to prosecute Epstein.” The:court found that the post-
NPA letters the: government, sent to victims: describing the investigation as ongoing “misled, the:
victims to believe that federal. prosecution was still a possibility” and that “[i]t. was a ‘material,

omission for “the ‘Government to suggest. to > the v victims that. oey have: patience relative to an.

The court felied on Dean and. BP Products, to Suppoit: its holding and noted that the
government’s action with. respect to the NPA was: especially troubling because, unlike a plea
agreement-for which the victims could voice objection. at a Sentencing. hearing, “[o ]fice an, NPA is
entered. into without notice, the matter is closed :and the victims have: no opportunity to be heard
regarding any aspeet ofthe case.” The court also, highlighted ‘the inequity of the USAO’S failure
to communicate with the victims while it simultaneously engaged. in. “lengthy negotiations” with
Epstcin’s counsel and assured the. defense, that the NPA would fot be “imade-public or filed with
the: Court.”

Although the: USAO. defended ‘its actions by -citing the 2005 Guidelines for the
Department’s, position.that:CVRA-rights do not attach-until:after a defendant is charged, the court
was “not'persuaded that the [GJuidelines were ‘the basis for the Goyerninent’s decision to withhold
‘information.aboutthe NPA. from the'victims.” The court:found that the government’s reliance.on.
