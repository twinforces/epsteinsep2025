substantive criminal law,” “[p]rocedures in criminal
cases are always those of the forum.”).5

In any event, Eleventh Circuit law would not sup-
port Maxwell’s claim. Maxwell does not cite any Elev-
enth Circuit decisions addressing when one U.S. At-
torney’s Office is bound by a plea agreement with an-
other U.S. Attorney’s Office. But in an analogous con-
text, the Eleventh Circuit held that a U.S. Attorney’s
promise made in a plea agreement—that a criminal
defendant would not be deported—was unenforceable
because the U.S. Attorney lacked authority to make
that promise. San Pedro v. United States, 79 F.3d
1065, 1072 (11th Cir. 1996). If the Eleventh Circuit
were to apply the reasoning of San Pedro to the issue
in this case, it would likely reach the same result be-
cause a U.S. Attorney only has authority to act “within
his district,” 28 U.S.C. §547, and must seek the

5 Maxwell cites a handful of district court cases
that apply the exclusionary rule of a foreign circuit to
prevent, in her words, “the Government from para-
chuting into a new circuit and prosecuting a case it
would not otherwise have been able to bring.” (Br.29).
This “inter-circuit exclusionary rule,” as Maxwell calls
it, is hardly a settled doctrine. See American Conflicts
Law 391-94 (discussing cases in both directions). In
any event, the purpose of this putative rule is tied to
its context: “to ensure that the proper level of deter-
rence is maintained in the locale where the violation
occurred.” (Br.29 (quoting United States v. Restrepo,
890 F. Supp. 180, 191 (E.D.N.Y. 1995)). That rationale
is inapplicable here.
