D. Acosta’s Decisions Led to Difficulties:Enforcing the NPA

After the agreement was reached, the collateral, attacks and contintied. appeals raised, the
specter that the defense had‘negotiated in bad faith. At various points, individual’members of the
USAO team ‘became frustrated ‘by defense tactics, and.in some ‘instances, consideration was given
to whether the USAO should declare a. unilateral breach. Indeed, on, November 24, 2008, the
USAO gave notice: that it.deemed Epstcin’s participation in work release: tobe a breach of. the
agreement but ultimately took no ‘further action. Acosta told OPR: “I was personally very
frustrated with the:failure'to report on October 20,:and had.[envisioned that entire collateral attack,
Tthink I would have looked. at this very differently.”

Oncethe. NPA was signed, Acosta could have-ignored Epstein’s requésts for further review:
by the Department and, if Epstein failed.to fulfill. his obligations under the: NPA ‘to enter his state:
guilty. plea, declared Epstein to be in breach and. proceeded to charge him federally. hen
questioned. about this issue, Acosta explained that.he believed ‘the Department. had the “right” 't
address; Epstein’s, concerns. He told OPR. that ‘because the: USAO is part of ‘the Department of
Justice, ifa defendant asks for Departmental review, it-would be* “unseemly” ‘to object.. During: his
OPR.interview, Sloman described Acosta as’ very. process-oriented, which.he attributed to Acosta’s
prior Departinent. experience. Sloman, however, believed the USAO gave. Epstein “[t]oo much,
process,” a: result of the USAO’s desire to “do the right thing” and to the defense team’s: ability to
keep pressing for more process. without triggering a breach of the NPA. Furthermore, Epstein’s
defense counsel repeatedly and.carefully made clear they were: not repudiating the agreement.
Acosta-told OPR that the USAO Would have had to declare Epstein, in breach of the NPA ‘if order:
to proceed.to file federal charges, and-Epstcin would.undoubtedly. have litigated whether his effort.
to obtain Departmental review constituted.a breach.. Acosta recalled that he-was.concerned, as was
Sloman, ‘that a unilateral decision to rescind the ‘non-prosecution agreement. would result. in.
collateral litigation‘that would further-delay matters and:make whatiwas:likely.a.difficult trial‘even
harder,

Acosta’s.arid Sloman’s concerns. about: declaring a breach were not;unreasonable. A court:
would have: been. unlikely to have determined. that. defense: counsel’s appeal. of the: NPA ‘to the:
Departinentiand unwillingness’to set a state plea date while that.appéal was ongoing-was sufficient:
to negatethe agreement. ‘However, some’ of the difficulty the USAO faced in declaring a breach.
was: ‘caused. by decisions Acosta made: before and shortly after. ‘the NPA was as signed, For example,
be sentenced not later than, October 26, 2007" to “Epstein shall use: © [his] 7 best ‘efforts, to enter his
guilty plea and be sentenced. not later than. October 26, 2007.”" (Emphasis added.) Acosta. also
agreed not.to enforce the: NPA’s October 26, 2007 deadline:for:entry-of.Epstein’s plea, and:he told
defense counsel ‘that: he had. no objection if they decided to pursue an appeal to the Department.
Following these: decisions, the USAO. would have had significant difficulty trying to ‘prove that
Epstein Was not using his “best efforts” ‘to comply with the NPA and was. intentionally failing’to
comply, as opposed to pursuing a course to which the-U.S. Attorney had at.icast implicitly: agreed.

E, ‘Acosta Did Not Exercise Sufficient, Supervisory Review over’ the Process

The. question at the center. of much of ‘the public: controversy: concerning the. USAO’s
handling ofits critninal investigation of Epstein.is why the USAO agréed to resolve a case in which,
