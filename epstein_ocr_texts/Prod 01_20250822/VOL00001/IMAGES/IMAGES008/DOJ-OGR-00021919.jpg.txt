26. Shortly after 6 a.m. on August 10, 2019, MICHAEL | |
THOMAS. and TOVA NOEL, the defendants, received a delivery of | |
breakfast carts into the SHU, after which time they were again the |
only officers in the SHU. Shortly after 6:30 a.m., NOEL and THOMAS
walked up to and entered the tier in which Epstein was housed to
serve breakfast. At approximately 6:33 a.m., an alarm was
activated in the SHU. Epstein was alone in his cell and not
responsive, with a noose around his neck. A supervisor who had
just started his shift (supervisor-1”) responded to the alarm
almost immediately thereafter, and as NOEL approached the door to
the SHU to open the door for Supervisor-1, NOEL told Supervisor-1
that “Epstein hung himself.” After arriving in the SHU,
Supervisor-1 spoke with THOMAS and NOKL. NOEL told Supervisor~1
“we did not complete the 3 a.m. nor 5 a.m. rounds.” ‘THOMAS stated,
“we messed up,” and “I messed up, she’s not to blame, we didn’t do
any rounds.”
