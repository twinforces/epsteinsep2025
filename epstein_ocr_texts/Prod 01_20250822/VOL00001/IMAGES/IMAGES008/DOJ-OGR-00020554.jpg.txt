11/22/2021 | 691 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Defense on
November 1, 2021, noticed eight expert witnesses. Def. Br., Ex. 1 ("Notice"). Two of
those experts, Dr. Park Dietz and Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, are expected to offer opinions
that rebut opinions of the Government's expert witness, Dr. Lisa Rocchio. The
Government on November 8, 2021, filed a motion to partially preclude the testimony
of Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus. Dkt. No. 424. The Court has already addressed that
motion. On November 15, 2021, the Government moved to fully or partially preclude
the testimony of the remaining six experts. The Defense filed a response on November
19, 2021. The Court addressed the admissibility of Dr. Ryan Hall in a separate written
opinion. In this opinion, the Court addresses the preliminary admissibility of Bennett
Gershman based on the parties' current proffers....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion
& Order ***]... TI. Conclusion. The Court therefore grants the Government's motion
to preclude Gershman's expert testimony. Because this is a preliminary pre-trial
ruling, it is possible that facts and circumstances at trial would alter the Court's
analysis. In that event, the Defense must re—raise its request to admit Gershman as an
expert witness. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
