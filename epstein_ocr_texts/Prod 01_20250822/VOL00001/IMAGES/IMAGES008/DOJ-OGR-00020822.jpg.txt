‘EBI. The. Court has. ordered.the, Government to disclose all. Jencks.Act and Giglio:material. by:
October ‘LI, 2021. Dkt. ‘No. 297 at L. ‘That datesis seven weeks in advanee of trial. ‘The:Gourt
sees no reason‘to depart from the rule ‘in this. district that-impeachment material of anticipated
‘witnesses:does not warrant'an order:compelling immediate disclosure. See United States v.
Campo.F lores, No. 1'5'Cr. 765 (PAG), 20.16, WL 5946472, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Oct: 12, 2016).
Seven. wecks in advance of trial is-far more time’than:is standard in this :district;and no. showing:
has ‘been.made that it;will’be insufficient for Maxwell:to make effective use of the Information in
‘preparation. of her defense.

‘To the extent;Maxwell. argues that the Government‘is in:possession of prior statements
‘that:are: exculpatory under. Brady (for example, if-a.witness denied Maxwells involvement),
rather. than useful only for standard impeachment purposes, it is of course the Governments
obligation to'“disclose such information to the defense promptly afier:its existence becomes:
known to the Government so that the defense may make.effective-use.of:the information. in.the.
preparation. offits:case.” Dkt. 68 at 1. The context of questions and answers surely:matters las to
‘whether a statement (or omission) ts: exculpatory, impeaching, orneither. It is for the
Government to: make these assessments ex ante and fully meet its disclosure obligations: so that
the defense may*make effective use of any such information in preparation for trial. See Wnited
States v. Coppa, 267 F.3d 132, 144-46'(2d.Cir. 2001). The: Government has repeatedly:
confirmed that it-understands those obligations, and:that ithas:met them and. will. continue to
‘mect them. Accordingly, the:motion to compel-the immediate disclosure of any of Minor

Victim-4’s prior statements in-which. she: did not mention:Maxwell ts denied.
