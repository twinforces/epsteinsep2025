Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page75 of 113.

The Government argued that there is no Ex Post. Facto violation in applying
§ 3283 retroactively to Appellant’s pre-April 30, 2003 conduct. We agree. See
Stogner, 539. 'U.S. at 632. But the Government’s ‘reliance on Ex Post ‘Facto
principles is misdirection. As Richardson, Gentile, and Schneider illustrate, the Ex
Post Facto: Clause is not the final word. ‘on whether a statute is impermissibly
retroactive. Indeed, the entire premise of Landgrafs that certain statutes must be
presumed (absent a clear statement from Congress) to apply only prospectively,
even though retroactive application would be entirely constitutional:

But while the constitutional impediments to retroactive civil

legislation are now modest, prospectivity remains the appropriate

default rule. Becatise it accords ‘with widely held intuitions about

how statutes ordinarily Operate, a. presumption. against retroactivity:

will generally coincide — with legislative and public

expectations. Requiring clear. intent assures that Congress itself has

affirmatively considered the potential unfairness of retroactive

application, and determined that it is an acceptable price *273 to pay

for the countervailing benefits.
Landgrdaf, 511 U.S. at-272-73 (emphasis in original; bold added). |! This view was
echoed by no less a jurist than Judge Calabresi, who opined that “[Landgraf’s]

anti-retroactivity presumption ‘is. triggered by statutes whose retroactive

application, while not the equivalent of criminal ex post. facto, nevertheless ‘would.

'! Landgraf cannot be distinguished in this regard simply because it was a, civil
case. Non-criminal statutes, ‘like. criminal statutes, can. be unconstitutionally
retroactive (i.e. under the Takings or Due Process Clatises), but the constitutional
standard.is different from the .L andgraf test. See Lk. Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S.
498 (1998). Conversely, some criminal statutes are presumed not to apply’
retroactively even though doing so would be perfectly constitutional.
