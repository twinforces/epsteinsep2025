9 told him to file it. The sole purpose of the CVRA
10 was to overturn the non-prosecution agreement.
11 So what I believe is that Villafana worked
12 with Brad Edwards, who she had also been -- he was
13 the lawyer that she had selected as a pro bono lawyer
14 for some of the victims. And he was also working for
15 Rothstein's firm, that was under RICO investigation
16 for that entire time, creating fake evidence in
17 Epstein's case.
18 And she had just filed hidden secret using
19 Edwards to overturn the NPA by filing the -- this
20 CVRA case, that sole purpose was to overturn it. And
21 so when he approached her with the list, this was
22 part of the effort to utilize and find new evidence
23 to support the overturning, either of the NPA and/or
24 a new case against Epstein.
25 Because Brad Edwards -- or I don't know it
