OLC: concluded. that: because the CVRA defines “‘crime victim’ asa “person dircctly and.
proximately harmed by’the commission of a Federal. offense,’ . .. the definition of victim. is thus.
tethered, to the identification. of a ‘Federal offense,’ an event ‘that occurs with the filing of :a
complaint.” OLC further concluded that because the House Report stated. that the CVRA codifics
the “rights: of crime victims in the Federal. judicial. system?” and a complaint “commences the:

‘judicial. process” and places an offense within the: ‘judicial system, »” the legislature must. have:
intended for CVRA. rights to.commence upon the filing of a-complaint.

OLC, also found that the language of the-CVRA rights supported its interpretation. For
example, the-first right grants a victim protection.from “the accused, * not a suspect. Additionally,
the second, third, and.fourth rights refer'to. “victim notification, and access to, public: proceedings
involving release, plea, sentencing or parole—none of which commence prior to the filing of a.
complaint.”
