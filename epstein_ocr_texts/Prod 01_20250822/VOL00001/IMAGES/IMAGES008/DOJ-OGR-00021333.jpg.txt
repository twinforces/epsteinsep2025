CHAPTER TWO:

I. OVERVIEW

Following the Miami: Herald report.in November 2018, media scrutiny. of and public:
attention to the USAQ’s handling of its Epstein investigation. has-continued unabated. At the:heart.
of the:public’s concern:is;the perception.that Epstein’s; [8-month sentence, which:resulted in a, 13-
month term of actual ‘incarceration, was too lenient and, inadequately punished Epstein’s criminal,
conduct. Although many records have been released as part of civil litigation stemming from.
Epstein’s conduct, the. public has reecived only limited information regarding the decision-making:
process: leading tothe signed NPA. Asa result, questions have arisen about Acosta.and his staff’s
motivations. for entering ito the NPA. Publicly released communications between, prosecutors
and defense:counsel, the:leniency of the sentence,,and an:unusual:non-prosecution provision. in. the:
NPA have led 'to allegations, that Acosta and the USAO gave, Epstein.a “sweetheart deal” becatise
they were motivated. by improper ‘influences, such. as their preexisting and personal relationships
with his attorneys, oreven.corrupt influences, such.as'the:reccipt of personal. benefits-ftom Epstein.

Through its investigation, OPR has;sought'to-:answerthe following core questions: (I') who
was responsible forthe decision to resolve the federal investigation through, the NRA and ‘for’ its
specific terms; (2) did the NPA or any of its pr ovisions violate Department: policies: or other rules
or:tegulationss and. (3) were any of the subjects motivated to resolve the federal investigation by
improper factors, such as corruption or favoritism. ‘To the:extent that available:records and witness
interviews shed lightion.thes¢ guéstions, OPR shows in detail the process'thatiled to the NPA, from
the: initial. ;complaint. to: the USAO through the intense: and. often confusing, negotiation’ process.
Aftera thorough and detailed examination of'thousands of contemporancous:records and extensive:
interviews of subjects and witnesses, OPR, is able to answer most. of the. ‘significant ‘questions
concerning the NPA’s origins and.development. Although:some. questions:remain, OPR sets forth
its conclusions and the bases for them inthis Part.

II. ACOSTA, REVIEWED AND APPROVED THE TERMS OF THE NPA AND. IS

Although Acosta. did not: sign the NPA, he approved. it, with knowledge of its terms. He
revised drafts of the NPA and added language that he thought appropriate. Acosta:told OPR.that
he cither was informed of, or had access to information, concerning, ‘the underlying: facts of the
case against: Epstein. OPR.did not find. any evidence suggesting that. any.of. his subordinates misled
him about, the ‘facts. of withheld information that would have influenced his decision, and Acosta,
did not make‘such a claim.to OPR. As Acosta affirmed in. his OPR.interview, the “three pronged
resolution, two ‘years... ; registration and restitution, . . . Ultimately that was, approved. on. my
authority. ... . (U]itimately, I‘approved ‘it, and.so,.I.. " accept that. Pm not . . .. pushing away
responsibility for it.” .

In.making:its misconductiassessments, OPR considers:the:conduct of subjects ‘individually.
Menchel, Sloman, Lourie, and Villafana were involved. in ‘the matter to varying degrees,, at:
