Case 22-1426, Document 79;.06/29/2023, 3536060, Page50:of 93

The ‘reach of the 2003 amendment to Section 3283
is clear. Because Congress has expressly extended the
statute of limitations to pre-enactment conduct; Judge
Nathan correctly resolved this analysis at. Landgr af
step one. In the alternative, however, the statute is=
at worst—ambiguous. If the Court takes that view, it
should proceed to Landgraf step two; which examines.
the retroactive effects of the statute.

ii. Landgraf Step Two
As the. Supreme Court. explained in Landgraf,
“[e]ven absent specific legislative authorization,” ap-
plying a statute to pre-enactment conduct “is.unques-
tionably proper in many situations.” 511 U.S. at 273.
“A statute does not operate ‘retrospectively’ merely. be-
cause it is applied in a. case arising from conduct ante-
dating the statute’s enactment, or upsets. expectations
based in prior law.” ./d..at 269. Instead, the question is
whether the statute “would impair ‘rights a party pos-
sessed when he acted, increase a, party’s liability for
past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to
transactions already completed.” Jd. at’ 280. Im;
portantly, “the fact that a new procedural rule was in-
stituted after the conduct giving rise to the suit. does
not make application of the ‘rule at trial retroactive,”
because ‘parties have “diminished reliance interests in.
matters of procedure” and “[b]ecause rules of proce-
dure regulate secondary rather than primary con-
duct.” Id. at 275.
In Vernon v. Cassadaga Valley Cent. School Dist.,
49 F.3d 886 (2d Cir. 1995), this Court considered.a new
statute of limitations that shortened the time to file
