irrelevant matters, such as what “led” him to the criminal conduct or the broader “context” in
which he committed specific criminal acts. There is no basis to compel production of evidence
related to those matters under Rule 16, Brady, or Giglio because they are not material and because
the evidence sought is in furtherance of a transparent attempt at nullification. Thomas’s motion
should be denied on this basis alone.

C. The Government is Not Required to Collect Materials From Agencies Who

Were Not Part of the Prosecution Team

Thomas asks the Court to compel the Government to produce “any reports, witness
statements, memorandum, and documents from any separate investigation conducted by the
BOP,” “documents, reports, witness statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC
employees who have engaged in the same or similar conduct,” and any previously undisclosed
reports, witness statements, and documents created by “any other federal agencies that investigated
the circumstances surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein.” (Mot. 4, 7 (emphasis added)). Even
if Thomas had satisfied the materiality requirement under Rule 16 or Brady with respect to these
items—and he has not—Thomas’s motion would still fail because the materials he seeks are not
in the prosecution team’s possession.

The BOP is not, and never has been, part of the prosecution team. Nor did the BOP conduct
an investigation jointly or in coordination with the prosecution team.° To require the Government
to obtain and produce any records from the BOP from a separate investigation, as well as evidence
that would support Thomas’s purported (and improper, for the reasons discussed in Part II.B,

® The defendant claims, based on a CNN article, that the U.S. Marshal Service (“USMS”)
conducted an investigation. The Government is unaware of such an investigation, and in any
event, any such inquiry by the USMS was not conducted jointly or in coordination with the
prosecution team.
