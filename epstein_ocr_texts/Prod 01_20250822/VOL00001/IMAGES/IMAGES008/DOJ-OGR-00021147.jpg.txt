Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page100 of 113

“there wasn't direct evidence about, you know, the defendant directly instructing
Kellen to make a certain phone call, and we acknowledge that.” A406. The court
pointed to the testimony of Larry Visoski as support for the fact that Kellen was
Maxwell’s assistant. A417. But Visocki’s testimony does not support this
inference either. While Visoski initially testified that he “thought” Kellen was
Maxwell’s assistant, he later clarified that “he didn’t know what her exact job”
was; did not know whether Kellen was Epstein’s assistant or Maxwell’s assistant;
and that his best recollection was that Kellen was “an employee who worked with
Epstein.” Tr. 204. Further, Cimberly Espinosa testified that Kellen was Epstein’s
assistant, and that she — not Kellen- was Maxwell’s assistant. Tr. 2332-33, 2376-
77. Espinosa further testified that, during the time Kellen interacted with Carolyn,
Epstein and Maxwell had ended their romantic relationship and “went their
separate ways.” Tr. 2370-71. Indeed, even Carolyn testified that there was a clear
break in the time when Maxwell called her to schedule massages and when Kellen
began calling her. Tr. 1527.

Given the dearth of evidence, the government failed to meet its burden of
establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that Maxwell supervised Kellen in
any capacity, much less was there any inference available to suggest that there was
supervision of a criminal nature. Thus, the court erred in applying the
enhancement.
