described in a previous order, members of the press and public may watch and listen to
the live video feed in the Jury Assembly Room, at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street. See Dkt. No. 10. However, in light of COVID-19,
seating will be limited to approximately 60 seats in order to enable appropriate social
distancing and ensure public safety. Counsel for the Defendant and the Government
may contact Chambers by email if there is a request to accommodate alleged victims
or family members of the Defendant. Members of the credentialed in—house press
corps may contact the District Executive's Office about seating. Otherwise, all seating
will be allocated on a first come, first serve basis and in accordance with the S.D.N.Y.
COVID-19 Courthouse Entry Program and this Court's previous order of July 7, 2020.
See Dkt. No. 10. If conditions change or the Court otherwise concludes that allowing
for in-person viewing of the video feed at the courthouse is not consistent with public
health, the Court may provide audio access by telephone only. Any photographing,
recording, or rebroadcasting of federal court proceedings is prohibited by law.
Violation of these prohibitions may result in fines or sanctions, including removal of
court issued media credentials, restricted entry to future hearings, denial of entry to
future hearings, or any other sanctions deemed necessary by the Court. SO
