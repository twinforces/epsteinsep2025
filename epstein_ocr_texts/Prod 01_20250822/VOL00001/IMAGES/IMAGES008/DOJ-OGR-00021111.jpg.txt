Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page64 of 113:

corroborates Defendant’s interpretation. The Joint Report accompanying the 2003
amendment to this provision, opined ‘that the prior statute of limitations would not
go far enough to allow the Government to prosecute “a person who abducted and
raped.a child.” H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 108-66, at.54:(2003). This legislative history
makes no mention of:crimes, such as Mann Act violations, that: do: not categorically
involve: the actual, abuse of minors,

Rather than grounding ‘its construction. of. § 3283 in the. text or legislative
history of the statute, the: District: Court: relied almost exclusively on an inapposite
decision from this Court, Weingarten. v. U:S., 865 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 2017). The
District Court conceded, as it had to, that, Weingarten is not controlling (A147), but
‘it essentially and erroneously treated Weingarien as though it were. The only:
question. in. Weingarfen was whether the petitioner’s trial. counsel. provided
constitutionally deficient representation. by conceding that an indictment charging
Mann. Act Violations was ‘timely. Sée 865 F.3d at 52. The petitioner contended.
that his trial counsel, should have argued ‘that § 3283 must be interpreted. under a
categorical. standard. See id. at 58. This Court disagreed only because “/i/t was
nol. obvious at the time of Weingarten’s motion to dismiss, nor is it:today, that a
court. must apply: a categorical approach, rather than..a fact-specific analysis, to

determine whether an, offense is subject to § 3282 or § 3283.” Jd. at 58-59
