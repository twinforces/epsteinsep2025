attend:the hearing. Inchis. affidavit, Edwards asserted, “[T]here was:no possible way I could have
believed that this state plea could affect'the federal investigation of the rights of iny‘clients' in that;
federal-investigation.”

Epstein’s attorneys’ requests: not ‘to: notify the victims about the NPA, and. that in. sending: the
January and.May’2008 FBI letters, the: gov ernment’s efforts “seem to have.graduated from passive
nondisclosure ‘to (or-at ‘least close to) active misrepresentation.”+*’ Although both the appellate:
court-and district:court focused on the: FBI’s letters’ forwvhich OPR concludes that neither Villafara,
Sloman, :nor Acosta was responsible, OPR considered.the courts’ ‘analyses :in evaluating: whether
similar representations: Villafana. made to the victims. who she interviewed, on, January 31 and
February I 2008, ‘and to Edwards, - were: © misleading, Therefore,, OPR, considered whether

victims whom. she interviewed « ‘or Edwards about the NPA. violated ERPC. 4. “4. (a), 4. -8.4(c), 0 ‘or

ERPC: 4-4.1(a) prohibits an. attorney: from, ‘knowingly. mak{ing] a false: statement of.
material factor law. to a third. person.” during the representation of a client, The FRPC defines
“knowingly” as: “denoi{ing] actual ‘knowledge of the fact in question” and states that such.
knowledge inay be “inferred, from, circuistances: “BS The comment to FRPC 424.1 states ‘that:

“(mJisr epresentations: can also occur ‘by’ ‘partially true: but misleading: statements or omissions: that
are thé equivalent of affirmative false statements.” Thé comment references FRPC.4-8.4 “[f]or
dishonest conduct that does not.amount to a false statement.” Like FRPC 4-4.1(a), Rule 4-8. 4(c)
requires evidence that thé attomey' knéw the statement in question was false., Under ERPC
4-8.4(c), the ‘intent requirement can: be satisfied “merely by showing, that the conduct was
deliberate or knowing” and the “motive underlying the lawyer?s conduct is not. determinative:
instead the issues whether he:or'she purposefully acted. 439 Tn ‘einberg, the court concluded that.
the: prosecutor violated FRP@ 4-4.1 and. 4-8.4(c) and. (d) by deliberately making untruthful
Statements: to a defense attorney, despite evidence ‘that, the prosecutor intended to help the
defendant by making the statements.“ In this case, Villafafia was fully. aware of the:signed NPA.
when she interviewed ‘the Victims on, January 3] and. February 1, 2008, and when, she spoke ‘to:
Edwards: on. the: telephone, but she.did not inform them specifically of the signed NPA. The
question is whether this. oriission.amounted to a knowing’false statement of misrepresentation:

One difficulty is determining what Villafana actually said during conversations. that:
participants were asked to recall many years later. With respect.to three of the: victims whom she:
‘interviewed in. January and.February:2008,, Villafaia:contended that:she discussed the agreement:
with them, even if She did not: specifically refer to: it-as the NPA, or discuss all of its terms, and:as
