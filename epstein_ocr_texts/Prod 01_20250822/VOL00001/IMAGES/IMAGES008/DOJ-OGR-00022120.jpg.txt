TOVA NOEL and MICHAEL THOMAS,
ORDER
Defendants.

ANALISA TORRES, District Judge:

The Court has reviewed the parties’ letter dated April 15, 2021, setting forth their
available dates for trial, ECF No. 50. Due to conflicts in the Court’s and the parties’ availability
in the third quarter of 2021, the Court, utilizing the procedures within this District governing the
scheduling of jury trials during the COVID-19 pandemic, will instead seek to schedule a jury
trial for the fourth calendar quarter of 2021. By July 16, 2021, the parties shall submit blackout
dates for trial.

The time between June 14, 2021 and October 1, 2021 is excluded under the Speedy Trial
Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A), in the interests of justice. The Court finds that the ends of
Justice served by granting the exclusion outweigh the best interests of the public and Defendants
in a speedy trial, because such an extension is necessary to efficiently administer the Court's
docket consistent with public safety, and because it will allow the parties to prepare for trial and
to discuss potential pretrial disposition.

SO ORDERED.
