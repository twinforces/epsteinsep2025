Dershowitz, Lefkowitz and Starr.”!7’ In that same later public statement, Acosta noted that he
received communications from Dershowitz, Starr, and Lefkowitz, who “all sought to make peace”
with him; Acosta referred to it as “a proud moment.”

On July 7, 2008, an Epstein victim filed an emergency petition against the Department, in
federal court in Miami, alleging violation of her rights under the CVRA; a second victim joined
the petition soon thereafter. The history of the litigation and issues relating to it are discussed in
Chapter Three of this Report.

B. Epstein Is Placed on Work Release

A few days after Epstein’s guilty plea, Villafafia reported to Sloman that Epstein was
incarcerated at the low-security Stockade, rather than the Main Detention Center where county
prisoners were usually housed. She also told Sloman that according to the Sheriff’s Office, Epstein
was eligible for work release. Although the USAO had made clear that it expected Epstein to be
incarcerated 24 hours a day, every day, the subject of work release had not been addressed
explicitly during the NPA negotiations, and the NPA itself was silent on the issue. Epstein’s
acceptance into the work release program as a convicted sexual offender was seen by many as
another special benefit given to Epstein. Because the decision to allow Epstein into the work
release program was made by the Palm Beach Sheriff's Office, OPR did not investigate whether
any state, county, or Sheriff's Office rules were violated. OPR did examine the USAO’s
consideration of work release prior to signing the NPA and its subsequent unsuccessful efforts to
ensure that Epstein remained incarcerated 24 hours a day.

The first specific reference to work release was made weeks after the NPA was signed,
when Lefkowitz asserted, in his October 23, 2007 letter to Acosta, that, “so long as Mr. Epstein’s
sentence does not explicitly violate the terms of the [NPA] he is entitled to any type of sentence
available to him, including but not limited to gain time and work release.”

In November 2007, Sloman had an exchange of letters with Lefkowitz about the USAO’s
understanding that Epstein had agreed to serve his full jail term in “continuous confinement,”
pointing out that the NPA “clearly indicates that Mr. Epstein is to be incarcerated.” Sloman noted
that Florida’s Department of Corrections’s rules did not allow individuals registered as sexual
offenders to participate in work release, and thus Epstein would not be eligible for a work release
program. Sloman concluded that the USAO “‘is putting you on notice that it intends to make certain
that Mr. Epstein is ‘treated no better and no worse than anyone else’ convicted of the same
offense,” and that if Epstein were to be granted work release, the USAO would “investigate the
reasons why an exception was granted in Mr. Epstein’s case.” !”8

However, also in November, State Attorney Krischer told Sloman that Epstein was, in fact,
eligible to petition for work release because his sexual offender registration would not take place
An Letter from R. Alexander Acosta “To whom it may concern” (Mar. 20, 2011), published online in The Daily
Beast. The FBI Special Agent in Charge told OPR that he had no recollection of such a call, but acknowledged that
it could have occurred.

178 Sloman provided a draft of this letter to Acosta for his approval before the letter was sent to Lefkowitz.
