1 Turning to that conduct, the punishment here must

2 reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the
3 law, provide just punishment for the offense, and deter.

4 First, as to the seriousness, the defendant's conduct
5 was, as aptly described by the probation department, heinous

6 and predatory. Ms. Maxwell worked with Epstein to select young
7 victims who were vulnerable. Once selected, Ms. Maxwell played
8 a pivotal role in facilitating the abuse of the underaged girls
g through a series of deceptive tactics. A sophisticated adult
10 woman, she provided an initial venire of responsibility and

11 even safety. She befriended and developed relationships of

12 trust. She then manipulated the victims and normalized sexual
Ls abuse through her involvement, encouragement, and instruction.
14 To give one example from trial, Jane testified that

15 Ms. Maxwell cultivated a friendship with her, took her to

16 movies and shopping. In an initial sexual interaction, while
17 Jane was 14 years old, the defendant engaged in sexual conduct
18 with Epstein while Jane was present. After that, the defendant
19 instructed Jane, again, while she was only 14 years old, on how
20 to massage Epstein, including instructions on how to touch his
21 penis during massages. The abuse later escalated to Epstein
22 using vibrators on Jane, penetrating her with his fingers.
23 During some of the sexual abuse, the defendant would herself
24 touch Jane's breasts.
