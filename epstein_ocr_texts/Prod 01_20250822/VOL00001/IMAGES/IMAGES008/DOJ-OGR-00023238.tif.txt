[A]s Chief of the Criminal Division of the USAO, I did not consider
it to be within my purview to ensure that appropriate victim
notifications occurred in every matter investigated or brought by the
Office. I also recall that the USAO employed one or more victim-
witness coordinators to work with line prosecutors to ensure that
appropriate victim notifications occurred in every matter
investigated or brought by the Office.

C. USAO and FBI Letters Are Hand Delivered

The FBI case agent told OPR that the FBI made its notifications “at the time that we met
[with] the girls.” The case agent recalled that she hand delivered the USAO letters and FBI letters
to some victims following in-person interviews, and in the instances when she did not provide a
victim with a letter, she provided an FBI pamphlet containing CVRA rights information similar to
that set forth in the FBI letters.78° The co-case agent also recalled that he may have delivered “a
few” letters to victims. The FBI Victim Specialist told OPR that she mailed some FBI letters to
victims and she provided some FBI letters to the case agent for hand delivery.

Nevertheless, the case agent told OPR that she “did not sit there and go through every
right” with the victims. She stated, however, “[I]n the beginning whether it was through [the FBI
Victim Specialist] giving the letter, me giving a letter, the pamphlet, I believed that the girls knew
that they were victims and had rights, and they had a resource, [the FBI Victim Specialist], that
they could call for that.” The FBI case agent further explained that once the case agents connected
the FBI Victim Specialist with each victim, the Victim Specialist handled the victims’ “rights and
resources.”

VI. AUGUST 2006 — SEPTEMBER 2007: FBI AND USAO CONTACTS WITH

VICTIMS BEFORE THE NPA IS SIGNED

Early in the investigation, Villafafia informed her supervisors that, up to that point,
“everyone whom the agents have spoken with so far has been willing to tell her story. Getting
them to tell their stories in front of a jury at trial may be much harder.” Between August 2006 and
September 24, 2007, when the NPA was signed, the FBI case agents interviewed 22 victims. On
a few occasions, Villafafia met with victims together with the FBI. Villafafia’s May 1, 2007 draft
indictment included substantive crimes against multiple victims, and Villafafia described the
circumstances of each of their encounters with Epstein in her prosecution memorandum.

There is some evidence indicating that during interviews, some of the victims expressed to
the FBI case agents and Villafafia concerns about participating in a federal trial of Epstein, and
those discussions touched upon, in broad terms, the victims’ views regarding the desired outcome
of the investigation. Before the USAO entered into the NPA, however, no one from the
280 The case agent told OPR, “I remember giving letters to the girls when we would talk to them at .. . the
conclusion, or . . . if I didn’t have the file on me[,] I had pamphlets in my car, or I made sure [the victims had contact
information for the FBI’s Victim Specialist].”
