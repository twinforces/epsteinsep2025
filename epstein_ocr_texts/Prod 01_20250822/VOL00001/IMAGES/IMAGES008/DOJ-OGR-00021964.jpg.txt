JBJKNOEN

1 of New York, Eastern District of New York, District of New

2 Jersey, and the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.

3 And then the special conditions that are set forth in
4 the pretrial reports, it's condition number 4, relating to use
a) of alcohol for Defendant Thomas, and condition 7 for Defendant
6 Noel, which relates to mental health evaluation and treatment
7 as directed by pretrial services.

8 And, finally, your Honor, that they be both released
9 today on their own signature.

10 THE COURT: And how long do the parties propose to

11 satisfy the balance of the conditions?

12 MR. ROOS: A week is appropriate, your Honor, for the
13 two cosigners.

14 THE COURT: Any objection from defendants?

15 MR. FIGGINS: No, your Honor.

16 MR. FOY: There is one.

17 THE COURT: Okay.

18 MR. FOY: Before today's proceedings, we did have an
19 agreement on the terms of release. And, of course, as part of
20 that process, pretrial services is involved and they're not
2l necessarily privy to the terms of our agreement. And I
22 understand that we've added some things that were not part of
23 the agreement, and I'm fine with that. But there's one
24 condition I'm not fine with and I'd like your Honor to
25 consider.
