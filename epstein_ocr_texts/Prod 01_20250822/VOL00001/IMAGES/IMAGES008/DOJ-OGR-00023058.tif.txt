4. Late July 2006: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves
Forward with a Federal Investigation

Several days after Villafafia spoke with Acosta and Sloman, on July 19, 2006, Assistant
State Attorney Belohlavek presented the case to the state grand jury.” Krischer told OPR that
“the whole thing” was put before the grand jury. According to a statement made at the time by the
State Attorney’s Office spokesman, the grand jury was presented with a list of charges from highest
to lowest, without a recommendation by the prosecutor, and deliberated with the prosecutor out of
the room.”4 The state grand jury returned an indictment charging Epstein with one count of felony
solicitation of prostitution, in violation of Florida Statute § 796.07, a felony under state law because
it alleged three or more instances of solicitation.”> The indictment did not identify the person or
persons solicited and made no mention of the fact that Epstein had solicited minors.”® On July 23,
2006, Epstein self-surrendered to be arrested on the indictment, but was not detained, and the
charges were made public.

Villafafia told OPR that she decided to move forward with the federal investigation at that
point because she believed the State Attorney’s Office would permit Epstein to enter a plea to a
reduced misdemeanor charge and that once he entered a guilty plea, the Department’s Petite policy
might preclude a federal prosecution.?’ Villafafia told OPR that at the time, she “definitely
believed that we were going to proceed to [a federal] indictment, assuming that ...we had
sufficient evidence.”
3 Villafafia and the FBI obtained and examined records of the state grand jury proceeding, and Lourie reviewed
them. Because the grand jury records have not been ordered released publicly, OPR does not discuss their substance
in this Report.

statement by State Attorney’s Office spokesman Michael Edmondson.
2s Indictment in State v. Epstein, 2006CF9454AXX (July 19, 2006), attached as Exhibit 1 to this Report.
26 In pertinent part, the state indictment read, “[B]etween the 1st day of August [2004] and October 31, 2005,
[Epstein] did solicit, induce, entice, or procure another to commit prostitution lewdness, or assignation, . . . on three
or more occasions.” The 15-month time frame and lack of detail regarding the place or manner of the offense made
it impossible to identify from the charging document which victim or victims served as the basis for the charge in the
state indictment. Belohlavek explained to OPR that the charge did not list specific victims so that she could go forward
at trial with whichever victim or victims might be available and willing to testify at that time.
27 The Petite policy is a set of guidelines used by federal prosecutors when considering whether to pursue federal
charges for defendants previously prosecuted for state or local offenses. The Constitution does not prohibit the federal
government from prosecuting defendants who have been charged, acquitted, or convicted on state charges based on
the same criminal conduct. The Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the long-standing principle that the prohibition
against double jeopardy does not apply to prosecutions brought by different sovereigns. See, e.g., Gamble v. United
States, 587 U.S. ___, 139 S. Ct. 1960, 1966-67 (2019) (and cases cited therein); Abbate v. United States, 359 US.
187, 195 (1959) (and cases cited therein); and United States v. Lanza, 260 U.S. 377, 382 (1922). Nonetheless, to
better promote the efficient use of criminal justice resources, the Department developed policies in 1959 and 1960 to
guide federal prosecutors in the use of their charging discretion. See Chapter Two, Part Two, Section II.A.2, for a
more detailed discussion of the Petite policy.
