Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 148 of 348

Some offenses, even though in. violation ‘of. Federal law, are of
particularly Strong. interest; to the. authoritiés of the state of local
jurisdiction. in. which they occur, cither’ because of the nature of the
offense, the identity of the offender or ‘victiin, the. fact: that the
investigation was conducted. ‘primarily by state. or local
investigators, or some other circuimstafice. Whatever the. reason,
when ‘it appears that the Federal interest ‘in prosecution. is ‘less
substantial than the interest. of state or local authorities,
consideration should be given, to ‘referring the case to those
authorities rather than commencing ‘or recommending: a. Federal
‘prosecution.

Another coniieft; cautions. that in assessing whether to defer to, state or local, authorities, “the
Eederal. prosecutor should be alert to any local. conditions, attitudes, relationships or. ‘other
circtinstafces that might-cast doubt on the likelihood of the state or local.authorities conducting.a.
thorough and successful prosecution.”

USAM § 9-27.260 identifies: impermissible considerations relating to the decision’ whether:
fo initiate or decline a’ federal prosecution. Specifically, the decision. may not: be based ‘on
consideration of the-person’s race, religion, Sex; national origin, or political association, activitics,
or beliefs: the: ‘prosecutor’s “own: personal. feelings” ‘about the: ‘person or the:-victim: or the. possible:
effect of the decision on ‘the: ‘prosectitor’s own professional or personal cifctimstances. When
opting to-decline federal’prosecution, the prosecutor should-ensure that the:reasons for that decision
aré-commiinicated to the ifivestigating agency'and reflected inthe office files: USAM § 9-27.270.

2. USAM § 9-2.031: The Petite Policy

Although the: Constitution docs not prohibit’prosecutions of a defendant by. both state: and.
federal atithorities, even when-the conduct charged.is, identical in both charging jurisdictions, the
Department.has a long: standing policy, known as the Petite policy, governing federal prosecutions
charged. after the initiation of. a prosecution in, another jurisdiction based on the same or:similar
conduct.’ ‘The general. principles ‘applicable to the prosecution, ‘or declination, decision are set.
forth. in. USAM ¥ 9-2.0311, “Dual and. Successive Prosecution Policy (‘Petite Policy’)? which.
contains guidelines fora federal prosecutor’s exercise of discretion in determining whether to bring
a federal prosecution based ‘on.the. substantially same act or transaction involved.in a prior'state or
federal, proceeding. ‘The ‘policy. applies “whenever there has been a. prior state or federal.
prosecution resulting 1 inzan acquittal. a conviction, including. one resulting: from a plea agreement,
or'a dismissal of other téerimitiation on the merits after jeopardy: has attached.”

In. circumstances in. which the policy applics, a prosecutor nonetheless can. initiate anew:

(1) The. matter must-involve a substantial federal interest. The. determination whether
a’substantial ‘federal. interest ‘is involved ‘is :made on. a case-by-case basis. Matters:
