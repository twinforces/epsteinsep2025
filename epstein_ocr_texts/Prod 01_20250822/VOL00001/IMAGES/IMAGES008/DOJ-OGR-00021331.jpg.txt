4, FRPC 4-8.4 — Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice

FRPC4-8.4(c) states thatia lawyer shall not engage in.conduct involving dishonesty, fraud,
deceit, or misrepresentation.

ERPC:4-8.4(d) prohibits:a lawyer from engaging in conduct in:connectionwith the practice
of law that is prejudicial to the adininistration,of justice:

In Florida Bar v. Frederick, 756 So. 2d 79, 87 (Fla. - 2000), the: court noted ‘that ERPC.

matter ‘resulted i in. ndelayed r resolution of the case and constituted a violation. of, FRPC 4-8. dd) due
to the-delay ‘in the administration, of justice and;the increased costs to'the client.?2!

a0 OPR also: examined ERP.C-4-3:8, Special.Responsibilities ofa Prosecutor. Nothing in the text of that-rule,
however, was:relevant to the issues addressed in-this Report. A comment to ERPC Rule 4-3:8 notes-that Florida has.
adopted the American Bar Association (ABA) * Standards of Criminal Justice Relating-to’ the Prosecution Function.

These “standards,” however, are hot biting: rulés of. conduct but rather provide. guidance té-:proseciitéts. Indeed, the.
ABA has expressly stated that these standards” farenot intended.to serve as the’ basis:for the:imposition.of professional.
discipline, to create. substantive Smprocediiral rights foraccuséd.or Convicted persons, to create a standard of.care’ for
civil liability. or to:servezas‘a predicate fora motion to suppress evidence or dismiss a.charge.” OPR.does noticonsider
the ABA standards as binding;on.the ‘conduct.of Department prosecutors.
