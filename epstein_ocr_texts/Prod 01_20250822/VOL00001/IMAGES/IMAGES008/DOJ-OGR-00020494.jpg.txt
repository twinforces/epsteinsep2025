District Court — District of New Hampshire. (jm) (Entered: 07/06/2020)

07/06/2020 7 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. This matter has been assigned to me for all
purposes. In its July 5, 2020 letter, the Government on behalf of the parties requested
that the Court schedule an arraignment, initial appearance, and bail hearing in this
matter in the afternoon of Friday, July 10. See Dkt. No. 5. In light of the COVID
public health crisis, there are significant safety issues related to in—court proceedings.
If the Defendant is willing to waive her physical presence, this proceeding will be
conducted remotely. To that end, defense counsel should confer with the Defendant
regarding waiving her physical presence. If the Defendant wishes to waive her
physical presence for this proceeding, she and her counsel should sign the attached
form in advance of the proceeding if feasible.If this proceeding is to be conducted
remotely, there are protocols at the Metropolitan Detention Center that limit the times
at which the Defendant could be produced so that she could appear by video. In the
next week, the Defendant could be produced by video at either 9:00 a.m. on July 9,
2020 or sometime during the morning of July 14, 2020. Counsel are hereby ordered to
meet and confer regarding scheduling for this initial proceeding in light of these
constraints. If counsel does anticipate proceeding remotely, by 9:00 p.m. tonight,
counsel should file a joint letter proposing a date and time for the proceeding
consistent with this scheduling information, as well as a revised briefing schedule for
the Defendant's bail application. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

07/07/2020 10 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. An arraignment, initial conference, and bail hearing
in this matter is hereby scheduled to occur as a remote video/teleconference using an
internet platform on July 14, 2020 at 1 p.m. In advance of the conference, Chambers
will email counsel with further information on how to access the video conference. To
optimize the quality of the video feed, only the Court, the Defendant, defense counsel,
and counsel for the Government will appear by video for the proceeding; all others
may access the audio of the public proceeding by telephone. Due to the limited
capacity of the internet platform system, only one attorney per party may participate
by video. Co—counsel, members of the press, and the public may access the audio feed
of the proceeding by calling a dial-in number, which the Court will provide in
advance of the proceeding by subsequent order. Given the high degree of public
interest in this case, a video feed of the remote proceeding will be available for
viewing in the Jury Assembly Room located at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan
Courthouse, 500 Pearl Street, New York, NY. Due to social distancing requirements,
seating will be extremely limited; when capacity is reached no additional persons will
be admitted. Per the S.D.N.Y. COVID—19 Courthouse Entry Program, anyone who
appears at any S.D.N.Y. courthouse must complete a questionnaire on the date of the
proceeding prior to arriving at the courthouse. All visitors must also have their
temperature taken when they arrive at the courthouse. Please see the instructions,
attached. Completing the questionnaire ahead of time will save time and effort upon
entry. Only persons who meet the entry requirements established by the questionnaire
and whose temperatures are below 100.4 degrees will be allowed to enter the
courthouse. Face coverings that cover the nose and mouth must be worn at all times.
Anyone who fails to comply with the COVID—19 protocols that have been adopted by
the Court will be required to leave the courthouse. There are no exceptions. As
discussed in the Court's previous order, defense counsel shall, if possible, discuss the
Waiver of Right to be Present at Criminal Proceeding with the Defendant prior to the
proceeding. See Dkt. No. 7. If the Defendant consents, and is able to sign the form
(either personally or, in accordance with Standing Order 20-MC-—174 of March 27,
2020, by defense counsel), defense counsel shall file the executed form at least 24
hours prior to the proceeding. In the event the Defendant consents, but counsel is
unable to obtain or affix the Defendant's signature on the form, the Court will conduct
an inquiry at the outset of the proceeding to determine whether it is appropriate for the
Court to add the Defendant's signature to the form. Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3771(c)(1),
the Government must make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of,
