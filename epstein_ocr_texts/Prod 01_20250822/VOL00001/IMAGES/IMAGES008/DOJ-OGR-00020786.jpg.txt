clearly that the allegations are irrelevant to the crimes charged. United States v. Napolitano, 552
F. Supp. 465, 480 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). The indictment does not allege that the alleged victim
traveled in interstate commerce or was underage during sexual encounters with Epstein. But the
Court cannot rule out that the allegations may reflect conduct undertaken in furtherance of the
charged conspiracy or be relevant to prove facts such as Maxwell’s state of mind. See United
States v. Concepcion, 983 F.2d 369, 392 (2d Cir. 1992). The Court will follow the well-worn
path of others in this District and reserve the issue for trial. Maxwell may renew her motion
then.

VII. Maxwell’s motion to dismiss multiplicitous charges is premature

Maxwell’s motion to dismiss either the first or third count of the S1 superseding
indictment as multiplicitous is also premature. Maxwell contends that the Government has
alleged the same conspiracy twice in the indictment. “An indictment is multiplicitous when it
charges a single offense as an offense multiple times, in separate counts, when, in law and fact,
only one crime has been committed.” United States v. Chacko, 169 F.3d 140, 145 (2d Cir. 1999).
“The multiplicity doctrine is based upon the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment,
which assures that the court does not exceed its legislative authorization by imposing multiple
punishments for the same offense.” United States v. Nakashian, 820 F.2d 549, 552 (2d Cir. 1987)
(cleaned up).

“Where there has been no prior conviction or acquittal, the Double Jeopardy Clause does
not protect against simultaneous prosecutions for the same offense, so long as no more than one
punishment is eventually imposed.” United States v. Josephberg, 459 F.3d 350, 355 (2d Cir.
2006). “Since Josephberg, courts in this Circuit have routinely denied pre-trial motions to
dismiss potentially multiplicitous counts as premature.” United States v. Medina, No. 13-cr-272
