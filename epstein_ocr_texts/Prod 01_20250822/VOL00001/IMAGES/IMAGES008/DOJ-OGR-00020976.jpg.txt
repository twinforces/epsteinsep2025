limited” category of “truly ‘exceptional’” circumstances absent binding authority. Jd.

Second, even if a court must imply bias on the basis of a juror’s similar experience, the
voir dire in this case of comparable jurors evinces that Juror 50’s personal experience is not so
similar to the issues in this case as to constitute a “truly exceptional” situation. Nor is it
sufficiently similar to warrant the Court’s exercise of discretion to infer bias. In arguing that
Juror 50’s experience is sufficiently similar, the Defendant highlights that Juror 50 was sexually

questions whether he could serve as a fair and impartial juror.

Juror 50 is also dissimilar to the cases from other federal circuits and state courts cited by
the Defendant. For example, as noted above, the Defendant’s prominent citation to Sampson v.
United States is misplaced because the juror in that case told a “litany of lies” bearing on a
variety of issues. 724 F.3d at 161. Thus, unlike here, a “combination of factors” led the First
