Case 22-1426, Document 3-2, 07/08/2022, 3344434, Page17/ of 92

instead proposing redactions to both the November 25th and November 30th letters.
The Government has indicated that it does not oppose the redactions. Dkt. No. 80.
After due consideration, the Court will adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions,
which are consented to by the Government. The Court's decision is guided by the
three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (1) determine
whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;" (ii) assess the weight of
the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing
considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such countervailing
factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law enforcement or
judicial efficiency’ and 'the privacy interests of those resisting disclosure." Id. at 120
(quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir. 1995) ("Amodeo I")).
The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that the Defendant's
letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in
the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for purposes of the
first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"), 44 F.3d 141,
145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law presumption of
access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the presumption of
access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put forthincluding, most
notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the lettersfavor her
proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to docket the
redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons outlined in
the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court DENIES the
Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the privacy
interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will permit
the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly
prepare a briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for
release on bail. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw)
