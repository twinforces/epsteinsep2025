In. Wild, the Eleventh. Circuit panel compared the language of:the GVRA. to: the language:
of the VRRA, noting that the VRRA. “eleatly: extends Victili-notice rights into the pre-charge
phase?’ and opining that the government: “may well have-violated” the VRRA with regards to its
investigation of Epstein. Asa.predecessor to the CVRA; the VRRA afforded victims various rights
and services; however, ‘it provided-no mechanism for a:victim.-to assert:such rights :in-federal court.
or by administrative complaint. Like the CVRA, the rights, portion of thé VRRA established the
victims’ ‘right to be treated with fairness and. respect and the right-to confer with an. attorney..for
the government. However, the rights portion of’ the VRRA ‘was.repealed upon, passage: of' the
CVRA.and was not in effect atthe time: of the Epstein. investigation.,

The portion of the VRRA directing ‘federal law enforcement agencies. to provide certain,
Victim services such as counseling and.medical care:referrals remained.in effect following: ‘passage:
of the CVRA. Furtheriore, two of the VRRA requirements—one requiring a ‘responsible official.
to “inform a victim of‘any ‘restitution or ‘other relief to which. the victim may be entitled,” and.
another requiring that a:fesponsible official “shall, provide a Victinn the carliestipossible notice of
the status of the investigation of the crime, to the extent it: is appropriate to inform the:victim and.
to the extent ‘that. it: will not: interfere with the investigation”’—may have: applied to: the Epstein
investigation. However, the VRRA did not.create a clear and-unambiguous obligation on the part.
of the: subject attorneys, as the 2005 Guidelines assigned the duty: of enforcing: the: two
requirements to the ‘investigative agency rather than to prosecutors. Moreover, the VRRA did not,
require notice to victims ‘before: the: NPA was signed ‘because, at that point, the case remained
“under inv. estigation,’ and the’victims did ‘not become entitled to pursue monetary damages under’
the.NPA until Epstein entered his guilty: pleas: in.June 2008. Once. Epstein did’so,:and the victims
identified by the. USAO. becaine entitled to: pursue the § 2255 remedy, the USAO furnished. the
victims with appropriate notification.

B. OPR Did Not:Find Evidence. Establishing That:the Lack of Consultation Was
Intended:to Silencé Victims

‘During her ‘OPR. ‘interviews, Villafafia. recalled. :more: than ‘one discussion in. which. she
raised With hér stipervisors'the issue, of consulting with the victinis before: the NPA was signeéd.on
September. 24, 2007. Acosta, Sloman, Menchel,.'and Lourie, however, had.:no recollection. of
discussions: about, consulting -victims before: ‘the NPA was signed, and. Menchel, disputed.
Villafania’ $ assertions. OPR, found only one written ‘reference before ‘that date, explicitly ‘raising
the: issue of consultation.. Given the absence of contemporaneous records, OPR ‘was unable to
conclusively determing ‘whether the lack, of consultation. stemmed from-an affirmative decision,
made by one or more of the subjects:or whether the subjects.discussed:consulting thervictims-about:
the NPA before it was signed., Villafafa’s recollection suggests that-Acosta, Menchel, and Sloman.
may have ‘been. concerned with maintaining ‘the confidentiality of plea negotiations :and did not:
believe that the. governinent-was obligated to consult;with victims about: such negotiations: OPR.

Conduct’ 1.3, lack of-diligence, and:8.4(¢d), conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. The:holding in Smith
was based on. Article 47 of the Maryland Coiistitution and various Specitic statiites affording victims the right, among;
‘others, to, reecive ‘various: notices ‘and, an opportunity to be heard.conceming “a case; originating by: indictment or
iiformation filed in a circuit court?” However, botly the uitderlyiig statutory provisions and, significanily, the facts
are’ substantially different frony the Epstcin:investigation., In Savith, the criminal defendant had, been arrested, and.
‘charged. before entering’a’ plea.
