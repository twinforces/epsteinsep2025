CHAPTER TWO:

PART TWO: APPLICABLE STANDARDS:

I. OPR’S. ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK.

‘OPR. finds. professional misconduct.:when. an. attorney intentionally violates or acts: in
reckless disregard of a known, unambiguous obligation imposed by law, rule ‘of professional,
conduct, or Department regulation. or policy.. In. determining whether an. attorney has engaged in.
professional, misconduct, OPR uses the ‘preponderance of the evidence standard to nvake factual,
findings.

An.attorney: intentionally violates an obligation or standard. when the:attorney (1) engages
in conduét with the puipose of obtaining a result that-the obligation or standard tinambiguously
prohibits: or (2) engages ‘in, conduct knowing its natural or probable consequence, and that.
consequence is a result that the obligation or standard-unambiguously prohibits. An attorney acts
in reckless disregard of an obligation or standard. when. (1) the attorney knows or should. know,
based. on ‘his. or her:experience and the: unambiguous:nature of the: obligation. or standard, of an.
obligation or standard; (2) the attorney knows.or should.know, based on his or her experience and
therunambiguous:applicability of the obligation or standard, that the:attorney’s:conduct involves:a
substantial likelihood ‘that he of she'will'violate, of cause a’violation.of, the obligation.or’standard:
and (3) the.attorney nonetheless: engages: in. the conduct, which:is: objectively ‘unreasonable under
all the-citcuinstances. Thus, an attorney’s disregard of an obligation is reckless when.it represents
a gross deviation from the: ‘standard of conduct, that an objectively reasonable attorney would.
Observe in the same situation.

If OPR determines: that an attorney did, not engage in professional, misconduct, OPR.
determines whether the attorney. exercised ‘poor ‘judgment, engaged,in other inappropriate conduct,
made. a:mistake, or acted. appropriately under all the circumstances.. An attorney exercises poor
judgment when, faced with alternative courses of action, he or she chooses a course of action that;
‘is in. marked contrast to the action. that the Department may reasonably expect an <attorney
exercising good judgment to'take. Poor judgiment-differs. from professional misconduct if that an
attorney may act inappropriately and. thus. exhibit poor judgment. even. though -he or she may not.
have Violated of acted in téckless distegard of a clear obligation or standard. Th addition, an
attorney may exhibit poor. judgment even though. an. obligation. or standard. at. issue: is not.
sufficiently clear.and- unambiguous to support.a professional. misconduct, finding. A mistake, on
the:other hand, results fromy an-excusable human error-despite an,attorney’s exercise of reasonable
care under‘the circumstances.

An. attorney who makes:a good faith attempt to ascertain the obligations: and ‘standards
imposed on the attorney and to comply with thei in a given situation does-Aot commit professional.
misconduct. Evidence that.an attorney made ‘a good. faith attempt. to ascertain. and ‘comply with.
the obligations and standards imposed can include, but is not limited to; the, fact that the attorney
reviewed. ‘materials that define: or. discuss one: or more potentially applicable obligations and.
standards, consulted with a supervisor or cthics advisor, notified the tribunal. or the attorney
representing a party or person, with adverse interests ofan intended course: of conduct, or took’
