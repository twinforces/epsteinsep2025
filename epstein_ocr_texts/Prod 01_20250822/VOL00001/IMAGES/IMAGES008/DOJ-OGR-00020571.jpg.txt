03/03/2022 | 630 | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on re: 627 LETTER by Ghislaine
Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from Attorney Jeffrey S. Pagliuca dated
March 2, 2022 re: Ms. Maxwells Request for adjournment of hearing on Motion for
New Trial. ENDORSEMENT: The requested two—month adjournment to May is not
justified and is therefore DENIED. Two of the Defendant's four attorneys are able to
be present and represent the Defendant at the March 8 hearing. The Court will conduct
the questioning at the hearing, and the parties have already submitted briefing and
proposed questions. The public interest in a reasonably prompt hearing outweighs the
Defendant's preference for an adjournment. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison
