evidence, telling him, “One: thing Iam. concerned about. is that, if we [file charges] now, ‘cross-
examination’will consist of-: “and.the government told you that, if Mr. Epstein.is-convicted, you are
entitled. to: a large: amount. of damages right?’” Explaining ‘the decision. in. her: later CVRA,
declaration, Villafafia. said. that after Epstein’s attorneys “complained, that the victims were
receiving an ‘incentive: to overstate their involvement with. Mr. Epstein. i in. order to increase their
dainages claims,” she “coitcluded that informing additional victims could compromise the
witnesses’ credibility at trial if Epstein reneged on. the agreement.” Acosta ‘was aware of these:
concems as he referred to theiiinzan August 2008 email, “[W]c also believed. that contacting the
victims would compromise them as potential.witnesses. Epstein argued very. forcefully that they
were doing this for the money; and we did not Wantito discuss liability with ‘them, Which was [a]
key part of [the] ‘agree[ment].”

The case agents interviewed victims in, October and November 2007, but did ‘not inform.
them about the NPA.) On. January 311, 2008, the FBI agents, ‘Villafaiia,, and the CEOS Trial
Attormey interviewed three ‘Victifits, including Courtney Wild, and they interviewed at least: one
more victim. the. next. day." ' Wild and two others had been. contacted. by the EBI in. the. fall of
2007 and-inay have been inforined aboutithe resoltition of the federal investigation.

Villafana told OPR. that during: the January 31, 2008 interviews, she did. not: specifically
tell the victims that, “there was a, signed non- prosecution agreement, that had these terms.” She
stated that:she would not use“terminology” such as“*NPA” because “most:people don’t:understand
what that:means.” Instead, with respect'to the three victims who, according to Villafafia, had been,
‘informed by: the FBI about the resolution, she: stated that “tan agreement-had. been. reached where:
[Epstein] was going to, be entering a guilty. plea, but, it doesn’t look [like] he intends to actually
perform . . [and] now it-looks like this may have to be charged ... and. may have to: go to trial.”
Villafana recalled: telling some Victims, that Epstein “was supposed to enter a-plea in, State court”
that would end the: investigation, but she did ‘not recall distinguishing between. the “federal.
investigation Verstis a State: inwestigation.’ ” Villafana told OPR she explained: “the case, was under
investigation,” she and.the agents “were:preparing .. ... again” to file charges, and'they hoped “that.
