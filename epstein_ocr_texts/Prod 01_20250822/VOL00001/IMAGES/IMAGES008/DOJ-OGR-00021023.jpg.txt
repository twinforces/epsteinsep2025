2000s that could have testified the household manual was created by “the Countess,” not the
Defendant; and Lynn Fontanilla, a live-in housekeeper for Epstein in New York that could have
testified about the Defendant’s and Epstein’s habits.

None of these identified pieces of alleged evidence satisfies the Defendant’s burden of
proving actual and substantial prejudice. The Court addresses first the documentary evidence.
First, the Defendant does not attest, or even suggest, what the absent documents are likely to
show. Though the Defendant would herself be best positioned to explain her own financial
transactions (or the lack thereof), her brief does not suggest what the absent financial records
would have shown. Similarly, the Defendant does not identify what would have been shown in
the absent phone records. The same is true of the flight records that the Defendant argues were
missing. At trial, the Government elicited testimony that flight manifests from before September
11, 2001, were far less detailed than modern manifests. F.g., Trial Tr. at 2518-22. The
Defendant can therefore only speculate that more accurate records ever existed. The location
and appearance of Epstein’s residences were also the source of significant testimony at trial. The
Defendant does not explain what additional information would have been contained in official
property records.

Second, even if more detail of the contents of these documents were presented, the
Defendant fails to show why the evidence, if admitted at trial, would have benefitted her case.
The Defendant’s motion presumes that each piece of missing evidence would have favored her:
an absence of payments by Epstein to the Defendant, an absence of phone calls from the
Defendant to victims, an absence of the victims on detailed flight manifests. But this
presumption is purely speculative. Each piece of evidence may very well have further
substantiated the Government’s case. Because the Defendant carries the burden of proof, she is
