or coercion of a child to engage in, or as-

sist another person to engage in, sexually

explicit conduct or the rape, molestation,

prostitution, or other form of sexual ex-

18 U.S.C. § 3509(a)(8). The term “sexually explicit con-

breadth of this definition is underscored by Congress’s
use of the word “includes” in Section 3509(a)’s text,
which is “significant because it makes clear that the
examples enumerated in the text are intended to be
