At:some point that day, Acosta spoke: with Lefkowitz by. phone regarding the. need. for
Epstein to plead ‘toa registrable offense. Throughout. the weekend, with Villafana’s Monday
deadline looming. defense counsel pressed: hard to eliminate the sexual offender ‘requirement. (On.
details froma press ‘report about a Florida’ public official who the previous day had pled guilty to
child sex abUise charges aid was sentenced to:a teri of probation. She noted-that she “spoke to
[MJatt [Menchel]” and asked-Lourie:to call her.. Two hours later she sent-Lourie a'second, lengthy
email, strongly objecting to the registration requirement, and outlining “all arguments against:
registration [as'a sexual offender] ‘in.this case.” In this email, Sanchez claimed that.there had-been,
ai “miscommunication” * during { the: September 12, 2007 7 meeting, and that * “we e only agreed, to the
NOT rezistrable,” Sanchez complained that lifetime ‘sexual. offender registration. + ‘Was a “lite
Sentence” that: was * “uncalled. for,” “does not inake sense,” ‘and ‘was’ “inappropriate” to impose
“simply [because] the EBI wants it, in. return for. all there [sic] efforts.” She listed numerous
reasons: why. Epstein, should not have to register, including his lack ofa prior:tecord of history of
sexual offenses; the lack of: any danger ‘of recidivism: the case with:which he could be “tracked”
Without registering: and that it would be “virtually impossible to comply” with four séparate state
registration ‘requirements. A .few:minutes later, Sanchez. sent Lefcourt’s phone number to. Lourie
“incase, you Want-to speak'to hin ditectly:” .

In:another email sent less; than two hours later, Sanchez:told Lourie she was writing again.
because“you are a very fair person.. This’ resolution in.the Epstein.case ‘is‘not-reasonable. [I]t/is:a.
result.of a misunderstanding at a meeting.” She stated that Epstcin’s attorneys had “consistently
cimphasizéd their goal of 18 months ina, federal camp” and “[e]veryone knew that a registerable
offense precluded” a camp. designation. Sanchez added, “Therefore. it would have ‘been wholly
inconsistent with that primary: goal of [Epstein’s] safety to lightly concede to registration, at that!
mecting.” Sanchez concluded, “[I]mposing ‘a life: sentence on. him is not. something anyone. will.
éventually'be proud. of. Please, reconsider and help me get a‘fair result.”

‘Lourie responded to none ofthe Sanchez emails, but he did reach.out to:Acosta:for‘a phone
coriversation. By email late that-night, at. 10:26:p.m., Lefkowitz asked Lourie to phone.him.

The-neéxt day, Lefkowitz cimailed. Acosta—with copies to Sloman, Lourie, and, Villafaha—
to “follow up on our conversation Friday,” asking. Acosta again to reconsider the!requirement that.
Epstein:plead.to.a registrable offense. Lefkowitzwrote that there had-been a.“misunderstanding”
at the September: 12,2007 mecting:
