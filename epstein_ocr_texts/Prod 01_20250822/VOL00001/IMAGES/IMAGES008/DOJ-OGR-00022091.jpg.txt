discovered any potential Brady material. As such, given that the prosecution has already produced
in discovery all of the materials it provided to the DOJ-OIG attorneys preparing the Report, the
underlying materials for the Report would be merely cumulative of information in the defendants’
possession. Any analysis of those materials by the attorneys preparing the Inspector General’s
Report is not subject to disclosure pursuant to Rule 16 and cannot constitute Brady material. See
United States v. Lewis, 35 F.3d 148, 150 (4th Cir. 1994) (noting generally that “nothing contained
in [an] OIG report would ordinarily have been discoverable”).

At bottom, Thomas has not cited a single authority requiring the production of a draft,
unpublished report by an inspector general or related work product, and such production is not
required by Rule 16, Brady, Giglio, or any other disclosure obligation.

E. Thomas Has Not Carried His Burden With Respect to Discovery of Material

criminal laws to him is “possibl[y] discriminatory.” (Mot. 7.) This request, which is effectively a
demand for discovery in furtherance of a selective prosecution claim, should be denied not only
for the reasons set forth in Section II.B, but also because Thomas has not made the requisite
showing that is necessary to obtain discovery for a selective prosecution claim. Indeed, Thomas
has failed to put forth any evidence that his prosecution was the result of discriminatory effect or
discriminatory purpose.

“A selective-prosecution claim is not a defense on the merits to the criminal charge itself,
but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge for reasons forbidden by
the Constitution.” Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 468. The standard to prove this defense is “a demanding
