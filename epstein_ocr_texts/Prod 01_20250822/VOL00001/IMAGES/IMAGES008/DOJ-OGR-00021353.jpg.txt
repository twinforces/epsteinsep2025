Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 179 of 348

In. its review of the: documentary. record, OPR.cxamined an email,written by Villafana in.
2018, thore than a decade after'the NPA was negotiated, in. which she. suggested ‘thatthe two- -year’
‘sentence requirement in.the-initial “term sheet” provided to the defense'was developed. by Menchel.
as a, favor to defense attorney Sanchez. OPR examined. the facts. suttounding this. allegation and
determined that there was no. merit to it. Specifically, :in December 2018, after the. Miami Herald
investigative report renewed publi¢ attention. to the case, Villafana reécounted, in an cinail to, a
supervisory. AUSA, ‘a.conversation she recalled. having had with.Sloman.about:the case.22> In the.
email, Villafatia stated that:she had ‘not. been. a participant in discussions: that: led. to Acosta’s
decision to offer a‘two-year plea deal, but she added the following: “Months (or possibly years)
ater, I_asked. former First Assistant: Jeff'Sloman where the two-year ‘figure came from. He said.
that Lily [sie] Ann Sanchez (atiomey fe for Epstein) asked Mri, Menchel to ‘do her a solid” and
convince Mr. Acosta to offertwo years.”

OPR questioned both Villafafia and. Sloman about the purported “do her a solid” remark.
Villafania told OPR that shé had been aware that: Menchél and Sanchez were friends. Duting her
OPR. interview, Villafaria explained:

[A] lot later, Lasked.Jeff.. said, you.know, “Jeff, where did this'two
years: come from?” And. he. said, “Well, I: always figured ‘that ... .
Lilly asked Matt ‘todo her @ solid,” which I thought ‘was such a,
strange term,... .“and to get her:a good deal so that.she would be: in.
Epstein’s good, graces” and that that’s where the two years came
from. .Although:strangely cnough, then.several years after that, Jeff
Sloman asked. ine where the two years came ‘from, and I had. ‘to
remind him of that. conversation. So Jeff'doesn’t.know where: the
‘two years came from.

Because the email. had. been. expressed in more definitive terms, OPR. asked Viilafafia
whether Sloman ‘had affirmatively asserted that. the two-year deal was a favor fro, Menchel to
defense counsel, or whether he ‘had stated that-he merely. “figured” that was:the case, but Villafaiia
could-not-recall precisely What Sloan. had said. At a ‘follow-up interview, Villafana again, said.
that she was unable to:recall whether'Sloman’s specific statement: was"“Lilly‘asked Matt to: do her
a solid, and.he did.it,” of “Lalways figured Matt justwanted .. . to. do, hera solid:” Villafana stated.
that she: was unaware-of ‘any information that. “expressly [indicated] ‘that there was any. sort. of,
exchange of .... a favor in either-direction.”

Duri ing his: OPR interview, Sloman did.not recall making such a remark, although he.could
not rule out the possibility ‘that; Villafana, for whoin he repeatedly expressed great respect, “heard
that in:some fashion.” He-told ORR that.ifthe did: say something | to: Villafafia about!Menchel: having.
done “a solid” for Epstein’s counsel, hé-cotild not have meant it-scriously, and he explained, “[I]t’s
not something that I would have believed. Him doing her.a solid. [mean that’s the: furthest.thing,
from iny:récollection. of impression even.after years, later.”
