Dkt..No. 462 at 24. In response to that question, Juror:50.checked.the box: for. “No,” not the box:
for either “Y-es (self)” or Yes (friend or family member).” But in‘several. public:statements
made to: media outlets after the trial, including interviews in The./ndependentand ‘Fhe.Daily Mail
are'direct, unambiguous, and‘made by Juror 50 himself to multiple media outlets. Morcoyer, the:
statements’ themselves describe: Juror 50’s own.cx petience.* They‘constitute “clear, strong,
substantial and incontrovertible evidence that a specific, nonspeculative impropricty has
occurred,” and so wartantian evidentiary hearing. Baker, 99 F.3d.at 130.

Although the Court docs notidécide whetherthe threshold.to hold a hearing based on
Question 25 alone has been met, becatise the Cotirt'will hold. a-héaring on Juror 50’s answer to:
Question 48 and because Question.48 and 25 are sufficiently related, the Court will inquire. into
Juror50’s:answer to Question 25. Question 25 asked jurors:

‘Have'you, or any: of your relatives: or close friends, ever been a victim ofa crime?
Dkt..No. 462 at 13. Again, Juror 50. checked the box:for “No,” and not:the box’ for cither “Yes
(self)” or “Yes (friend or family member).” But. Juror 50’s post-trial statements, if true, may.
‘describe: criminal conduct-of:which he:was the victim. Therefore, Juror 50’s answer to Question
25 is sufficiently related to‘the answer'to Question.48 and so'the Court.will also inquire: as to

Question 25 at an evidentiary hearing. See Buker,.99 F:3d-at 130.
