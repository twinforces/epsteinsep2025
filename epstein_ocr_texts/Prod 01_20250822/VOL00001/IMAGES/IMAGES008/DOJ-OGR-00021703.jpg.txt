in fact sexually abused when transported across state
lines, including to New York, as a minor..Instead, Max-
well insists that: Counts Three and Four do not involve
sexual abuse of a child because a.completed sex act is
not an element. of those crimes. This argument mis-
reads the relevant statutes and legislative history, and
runs contrary. to the decisions of this Court and other
Courts of Appeals. !!

a. Counts Three and Four Are Offenses
Involving the Sexual Abuse of a
Child
‘Maxwell’s entire argument is based on a mistaken
premise: that the phrase “offense involving the sexual.
... abuse... of a child,” 18 U.S.C. § 3283, only encom;
passes crimes.in. which “unlawful sexual activity actu-
ally took place.” (Br.44). This flawed proposition ig-
nores relevant statutory definitions, which make clear
that Section 3283 reaches more broadly to include of:
fenses in which there was no completed illegal. sex. act.
As described above, Section 3283 was, originally
codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k).. The definition. of the
term “sexual abuse” is located within that same sec-
tion:
For purposes of this section ... the térm
‘sexual abuse’ includes the employment,.
use, persuasion, inducement, enticement,

Maxwell raises no analogous argument with re-
spect to Count Six, which charges sex trafficking of a.
minor, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1591.
