1 which Ms. Noel has already complied with.

2 During the proceedings before the magistrate court, I
3 presented arguments in favor of her ability to keep her

4 firearm. I'm asking for this Court to reconsider that decision
5 and provide an individualized assessment of whether that

6 condition is appropriate under the circumstances of this case.
7 Your Honor, this case involves allegations of

8 nonviolent criminal conduct. I do not believe that there's a

9 controversy of whether she's a flight risk or danger to the

10 community. What has been said to me with regards to why the

11 application for the firearm has been made by pretrial services
12 is to make them more comfortable so when they come to the home
13 there's not a firearm in the home.

14 I do appreciate the fact that pretrial services needs
15 to be safe, and I don't deny that. However, when it comes to
16 infringing upon her Second Amendment right to possess her

17 firearm that she has legally, that's personal to her, I also

18 would like to make one correction in the record from my

19 previous presentation, because I indicated to the Court at that
20 time that she possessed it legally and that she just has it for
al the home.
22 Well, it turns out she does have credentials to
23 actually carry her firearm in public as it relates to her job.
24 I suspect that that could change if something happened with her
25 job as a result of these proceedings, but that wouldn't change
