which Ms. Noel, has alréady complied, with.
During the proceedings before the magistrate court, I
presented arguments ‘ih favor of hér abilsty to keep her
firearm. I'm asking for this Court tog reconsider that decision

and, provide an individualized assessment of whether that

condition is appropriate under the circumstances of this case,

Your Honor, this, casé involvés allegations of
nonviolent. criminal conduct. I do not believe that there's a
Controversy of whether she's a flight risk, of danger to the
community. What has been said to me with regards to why the
application for the firearm has béeh made by pretrial services
Ls to make them mone comfortable sq when they come to the home
there's not a firearm in the Horie.

I do appreciate the fact that pretrial services needs

t6 be safe, and I don't deny that. Hdéwever, when it. comes to
infringing upon her Second Amendment, right to possess her
firearm that shé has legally, that's persénal to Her, I also
would like to make one connection in the record, from ‘my
previous preséntation, bécausée I indicated to the Court at that
tame that. she possessed it Jegally and that she just has it for
the home.

Well, it turns out she does have credentials ‘to
actually Garry her firearm in public as it relates to her job:
I suspect, that. that could change if something happened with her
job as a result of these proceedings; but that wouldn't change
