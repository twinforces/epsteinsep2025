Case 22-1426, Document 78, 06/29/2023, 3536039, Page212 of 217

M6s2Max2

supervisea release on Gounts Three and Four and five yearns, on

Count Six, all to run concurrently, for a total of five years

of supervised release.

Defense counsel indicated no objection to the

conoitions of superviseo release indaicateo in the presentence

report, and. so I impose them ‘precisely as stated in the

‘presentence report, incltioing the stanaard conodtions, special

conditions, ana manoatory conditions. of supervised release.

Again, I am imposing them precisely as stated in the PSR.

I order Ms. Maxwell to pay a fine in the amount. of
$75€,CCC. The: maximum amount. per count is $250,066, so that is:
$75C;,CCC total. As I have iundicatea, I reject. the contention
that the defendant is unable to pay a fine. Ms. Maxwell has
récéivéd a $10 million bequest from Epstéin. This is in
aacoition to her other assets. And the aefendant, I conclude,

is able to afford a substantial fine, and I conclude that the

mhaximiim amount per Count, is reasonable tinder all relevant

circumstances in light of the counts, of conviction.

The government nas indicated that it is not seeking
restitution nor forfeiture.

I am, imposing a mafidatory Spécial assessment, as I
must; of $S1C€C per count; which is aue immediately.

Does either counsel know of any legal reason, ether
than, thosé alredoy arguéa, why thé Sentence shall not bé
imposeo as stated?
