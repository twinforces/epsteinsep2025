Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page20 of 113
court conducted a hearing on March 8, 2022 (A264), after which it denied
defendant’s motion. A318.

On June 28, 2022, the court dismissed Counts One and Five on multiplicity
grounds; dismissed the severed perjury counts at the request of the Government;
and sentenced Defendant on Counts Three, Four, and Six as described above.
Defendant is currently serving the sentence imposed by the District Court.

On appeal, Defendant argues, as she did below, that (1) the convictions were
obtained in violation of a nonprosecution agreement (“NPA”); (2) all counts are
time-barred; (3) she was deprived of her constitutional right to be tried by a fair
and impartial jury when a juror concealed his traumatic experience as a victim of
child sexual abuse during voir dire by providing false answers to the jury
questionnaire on every question designed to ferret out this information; (4) the
court’s refusal to correct the jury’s misunderstanding of an element of the
transportation offense resulted in a constructive amendment of the indictment or a
prejudicial variance; and (5) her sentence was predicated upon a miscalculation of
the guideline range and the misapplication of an aggravating role adjustment.
