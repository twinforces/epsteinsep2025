anstruction. Cléarly théy are making an érror concerning which
state cegins with "New." And I suggest that if the Court
wishes to refer them to the charge, the Court, also clears up
the facet that Count Four requires a violation of New York .law,
not Néw México law...

THE COURT: That's certainly why we Should refer them
to. the whole charge. That,'s ‘what lines 7 through 10 make
clear.

MS. MOE: ¥es, your Honor.

Thé only illegal séxuadl activity identified in the
entirety ‘of ‘the jury’ charge is a statute in New York. There
cannot ‘be any risk. of confusion. on that score. This particular
charge reminds the juny of that and ineludes that language as
well. The jury HaS hot séeén chargéd asout any laws in New
Mexico; so there can't ce any risk of confusion for exactly
that reason.

MR., EVERDES5: I just don't understand the confidence
adsout. how there Gan Se no pdssiole confusion --

THE. COURT: This conversation is stopping.

My decision, is to refer them oack. to this charge;
pecause it is a proper instruction. on the second element. to
Count Four. I do net. know what this quéStion means. It's too
difficult to parse factually and legally what. they're asking.
So the only option in those .circumstances is to direct them
wack. to. the count.
