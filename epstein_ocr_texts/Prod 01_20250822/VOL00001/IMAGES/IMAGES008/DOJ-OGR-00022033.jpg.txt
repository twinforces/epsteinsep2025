Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document33 Filed 04/09/20 Page 10 of 38

2. Any and all internal investigative reports created by the BOP as to both
defendants, including, any and all supporting méimfiorandums, written
statements, ‘photos, videos, and. incident'reports

To date, the government: has disclosed, a multitude: of discovery documents ‘but those
documents only'relate to witness statements, video and incident ‘reports ‘concerning ‘the events of
August 10, 2019. Michaél Thomas would like this court, to authorize the disclosure of any and ‘all
teports generated by investigators: within. the Bureau of Prisons regarding the August 10, 2019
incident, if those. have not been disclosed. Additionally, the defendant: seeks any all documents,
reports, witness statémerits and disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who have
engaged: in ‘the. same or similar conduct. Mr. Thomas requests the results of any disciplinary
proceedings ‘and, documents, maintained. by the BOP regarding the discipline or administrative
adjudication of any other: employees who have failed to conduct rounds. or’ inmate outs. Moré
specifically, the defense is aware that there was an almost identical incident in 2005 or 2006:
wherein officers failed to: conduct institutional counts’ or rounds and. an. inmate committed
suicide. The defense believes that only one of four officers ‘in that: case was given onlya minor
(14) day suspension. Moreover, although the government: will argue that this incident is, far
removed from the current incident, the defendant disagrees. Mr. Thomas.knew some of the
individuals in that incident, and he was’ well aware that their conduct did not Jead to their
indictment or: incarceration. In fact, imany of ‘those officers did not réceive as much as a
reprimand for falsifying: the same documents that: Mr.. Thomas is now charged with a federal
crime for submitting. This goes fo Mr. Thomas’ deféise in this case. The defendant’s state of
mind, is always -a material and relevant fact in any criminal case. Indeed, the mens rea for U.S.
Code § 1.001 is that the party knowingly and willfully made the false statement. Undoubtedly,
given the assertions already made this information is of significant importance to Mr. Thomas’

defense.
