[The:prosecution] was: going forward on the'part ofthe state, and so
here is the big bad ‘federal. goverhment.stepping on. a, sovercign :
State, saying ‘you're not doing. enough, [when] to. my mind . the
whole idea of the [P]etite policy is. to recognize ‘that the []state.

is. an. independent entity,, and. that. we should presume: that what
they’te doing, is correct, even if we don’t like the outcome, except.
in the:most unusual of circumstances.

Acosta-‘told.OPR that “absent; USAO intervention,” the state’s prosecution of Epstein would.have
become final, and accordingly, it was“ ‘prudent” to employ Petite policy: analysis. As Acosta
explained in. a, public, statement he issued :ii, 2011, “the federal. responsibility” in this unique.
situation was merely: to serve asa “backstop. [to] state authorities to: ensure. that there [was] no
iiscarriage of justice. e260) Furtherinore, Acosta saw’ a.distinction between a case that ofiginated.as
a federal investigation and-one that had already been. indicted. by the state but. was brought to the:
federal. government because of a perception thati the state charge was inadequate. In the, latter
‘circumstance; Acosta viewed the USAO’s‘role only. as prev enting: ‘a “manifest injustice. 6! Acosta
explained that “no jail-time” would. have: been a:manifest, injustice. But it was his, understanding:
that if Epstein had pled ‘guilty to state charges and received. a two-year sentence ‘to a registrable.
offense, “it-would. never have come: to the office. in the first place,” and therefore would :not‘be:
viewed as a manifest injustice.

Acosta.als6, told OPR he was concerted that'a federal proseciition.in.this casé would result:
in ‘unfavorable precedent, because the Epstein case:‘straddled the: line between “solicitation” or
“prostitution,” which.A costa described. as a traditional state concern, and “trafficking,” which was
an emerging matter of federal interest. Acosta contended ‘that in 2006, “it would have been
extremely unusual for any. United. States Attorney’s Office to become involved in a state
state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR,“I’m.not saying,it was the:right-view -- but there. are at least
some’ individuals who'would have looked -at-this and-said, this is a,solicitation case, nota trafficking:
case.” Acosta-was concerned that. ifthe USAO convicted Epstein. of a federal. charge; an appeal.
might result in an adverse opinion about-the distinction between prostitution and. sex trafficking.

Acosta also told OPR: that: he was concerned that a trial, would be, difficult ‘for Epstein’s
yictims.. In, Acosta’s estimation, a. trial court. in 2007 might. have permitted “victim shaming,”
which would have been traumatic for'them. In addition, the fact that the state grandjury. returned.
a‘one-count-indictment with a-charge that would not require jail ‘time suggested to Acosta that the
state grand jury found little:merit to the case.°” Acosta‘told OPR:
