Iv. ACOSTA’S DECISION TO DEFER TO THE STATE ATTORNEY'S
DISCRETION WHETHER TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT EPSTEIN’S STATE
COURT PLEA HEARING DID NOT VIOLATE A. CLEAR. OR UNAMBIGUOUS
STANDARD; HOWEVER, ACOSTA EXERCISED: POOR. JUDGMENT BY
INVESTIGATION WERE ADVISED OF THE STATE PLEA. HEARING

As set forth:in the factual. discussion, within a few weeks of the NPA’s signing, it’ became
clear that the defense team disagreed with, and. strongly objected, to, the government's plan to
‘inform ‘victims: of their ability to recover monetary: damages: from Epstein, under the: 18"U.S.C.
$2255 ‘provision, of the: NPA, atid about: Epstein’s state. court plea heating. The USAO initially
took ‘the position that: it..was: obligated to, and intended to, inform victims ‘of both the NPA,
including the § 2255 provision; and Epstein’s change. of plea, hearing and, sentencing, so ‘that;
victims who-wanted.to attend.could.do so.

In, November’ and. December 2007, Epstein’s attorneys challenged the USAQ’s position,
regarding; victim. notification. Ultimately, Acosta made two distinct decisions concerning, victim.
notifications. Consistent with Acosta’s concerns about intruding:into ‘state actions, Acosta elected
to defer to:state authorities the decision. whether to notify victims: about the state’s ‘plea hearing,
pursuant to the state’s own. victiin’s. tights requitements., ‘Acosta also determined. that the USAO
would, notify victims about their eligibility: to obtain monetary damages from Epstein. under’§ 2255,
a décision ‘that Was implemented by letters senti to; Victiins, after Epstein: entered. his state pleas.
This decision, which.postponcd notification-of the: NPA until after Epstein entered his. guilty pleas,
was based, at I¢ast in pait, on Villafana’s and. the. case ageiits® strategic concerns relating to
preserving 'the victims’ credibility and-is discussed further in Section V, below..

In, this ‘section, OPR analyzes Acosta’s decision to defer'to'the state the responsibility for’
notifying, victims of Epstein’ Ss! plea hearing: and sentencing. OPR.-concludes:that.ncither the-GVRA.
fior the VRRA: required the government to notify victiins. of the state. proceeding and therefore
Acosta ‘did not-violatezany statutes or Department: ‘policy by: deferring. to the discretion.of-the State:
Attorney whether'to notify victiins, of Epstein’s state guilty pleas ahd sentencing: However, OPR.
also concludes. that Acosta exercised. poor. judgment. because: by failing ‘to. ensure that the state
intended to and Wwotild notify Victims, of the federal investigation, he failed ‘to ‘treat Victiins
forthrightly and with.'‘the sensitivity expected by the Department. ‘Through counsel, Acosta.

“strongly disagree[d]” with OPR’s conclusion. and. argued that. OPR-unfairly. applied a standard.
“never before expected. of any U.S. Attorney.” OPR. addresses Acosta’s criticisms in, the:
discussion.below.

A. Acosta’s Decision to Defer to the State Attorney’s Discretion Whether to
Notify. Victims about Epstein’s State Court Plea Hearing Did Not Violate Any
Clear or Unambiguous Standard.

In, November 2007, Villafafia sought to avoid defense accusations of misconduct:
concerning. her interactions: with. the: victims by: preparing a written notice. to victims ‘informing
thei of the resolution of thefederal case atid of their eligibility’ for monctaty damages, and. inviting’
them to appear at the state: ‘plea: hearing. Villafatia and Sloman. exchanged edits of the draft-letter
and, at Sloman’s insté uction, she provided the draft to defense attorney Lefkowitz, who, in turn,
