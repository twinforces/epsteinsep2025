Menchel’s reply email began with a rebuke:
Both the tone and substance of your email are totally inappropriate
and, in combination with other matters in the past, it seriously calls
your judgment into question.
As you well know, the US Attorney has not even decided whether
to go forward with a prosecution in this matter, thus you should have
respected his position before engaging in plea negotiations.
Along that same line, despite whatever contrary representations you
made to the agents in this matter, it was made clear to you by the US
Attorney and the First Assistant from the time when you were first
authorized to investigate Mr. Epstein that the office had concerns
about taking this case because of petit [sic] policy and a number of
legal issues. Despite being told these things, you prepared a pros
memo and indictment that included a definitive date for indictment.
It has come to my attention that you led the agents to believe that
the indictment of this matter was a foregone conclusion and that our
decision to put off that date and listen to the defense attorneys’
concerns is indicative of the office having second thoughts about
indicting. As you well knew, you were never given authorization
by anyone to seek an indictment in this case.°°

In the email, Menchel went on to explain the circumstances of his conversation with

Sanchez and respond to Villafafia’s complaints:
Lilly Sanchez called me before, not after, the June 26th meeting. It
was an informal discussion and not in the nature of an official plea
offer but rather a feeling out by both sides as to what it might take
to resolve the matter. As you are also well aware, the only reason
why this office even agreed to look into the Epstein matter in the
first instance was because of concerns that the State had not done an
adequate job in vindicating the victims’ rights. As you and the
agents conceded, had Epstein been convicted of a felony that
resulted in a jail sentence and sex offender status, neither the FBI
nor our office ever would have interceded. You should also know
that my discussion with Lilly Sanchez was made with the US
Attorney’s full knowledge. Had Lilly Sanchez expressed interest in
pursuing this avenue further, I certainly would have raised it with all
the interested individuals in this case, including you and the agents.
In any event, I fail to see how a discussion that went nowhere has
hurt our bargaining position. I am also quite confident that no one
ag Menchel also sent this message to Sloman and copied Lourie.
