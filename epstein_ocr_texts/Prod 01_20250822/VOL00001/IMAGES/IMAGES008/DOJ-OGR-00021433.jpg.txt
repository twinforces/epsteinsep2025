about the NPA because it was “confidential” and because the case was under “investigation and
leading towards” the filing of charges. Villafafia recalled mentioning the conversation to her
supervisors and the case agents because she “thought he was somebody who could be of assistance
to us and... could perhaps persuade Alex Acosta that this was a case that was meritorious and
should be prosecuted.”

Nevertheless, when OPR asked Villafafia why she did not inform Edwards of the same
information that the FBI and she had provided to Wild in October 2007 and January 2008,
Villafafia explained that she felt “prohibited”:

At the time that I spoke with him, you know, there had been all of
this . . . letter writing or all of these concerns and instructions that I
had been given by Alex [Acosta] and Jeff [Sloman] not to disclose
things further and not to have any involvement in victim
notification, and so I felt like that prohibited me from telling him
about the existence of the NPA.
X. JUNE 2008: EFFORTS TO NOTIFY VICTIMS ABOUT THE JUNE 30, 2008 PLEA

HEARING

The Epstein team’s appeals through the Department ended on June 23, 2008, when the
Deputy Attorney General determined that “federal prosecution of this case is appropriate” and
Epstein’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct did not rise to a level that would undermine such
a decision. Immediately thereafter, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia notified Lefkowitz that
Epstein had until “the close of business on Monday, June 30, 2008, to comply with the terms and
conditions of the agreement . . . including entry of a guilty plea, sentencing, and surrendering to
begin his sentence of imprisonment.” That same day, Villafafia made plans to file charges on July
1, 2008, if Epstein did not enter his guilty plea by the June 30 deadline.

On Friday, June 27, 2008, Villafafia received a copy of the proposed state plea agreement
and learned that the plea hearing was scheduled for 8:30 a.m. on Monday, June 30, 2008. Also on
that Friday, Villafafia submitted to Sloman and Criminal Division Chief Senior a “final final”
proposed federal indictment of Epstein.

Villafafia and the FBI finalized the government’s victim list that they intended to disclose,
for § 2255 purposes, to Epstein after the plea and, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia contacted
PBPD Chief Reiter to ask him to notify the victims of the plea hearing. Villafafia told OPR that
Sloman said, “Chief Reiter could contact the victims from the state case, and tell them about the
plea.”3°! On Saturday, June 28, 2008, Villafafia emailed Sloman to inform him that PBPD Chief
Reiter “is going to notify victims about the plea.”?°?
2a Villafafia further stated, “I requested permission to make oral notifications to the victims regarding the
upcoming change of plea, but the Office decided that victim notification could only come from a state investigator,
and Jeff Sloman asked PBPD Chief Reiter to assist.”
ane Sloman replied, “Good.”
