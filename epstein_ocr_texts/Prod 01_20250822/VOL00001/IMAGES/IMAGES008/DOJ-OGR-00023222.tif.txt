which Villafafia and Lourie believed that the state had intentionally failed to aggressively pursue
a broader state indictment.

One example illustrates this communication gap. In a September 20, 2007 email to Lourie
asking him to read the latest version of the proposed “hybrid” federal plea agreement (calling for
Epstein to plead to both state and federal charges), Acosta noted, “I don’t typically sign plea
agreements. We should only go forward if the trial team supports and signs this agreement. I
didn’t even sign the public corruption or [C]ali cartel agreements, so this should not be the first.”
(Emphasis added.) In his email to Villafafia, Lourie attached Acosta’s email and instructed
Villafafia to “change the signature block to your name and send as final to Jay [Lefkowitz].”
(Emphasis added.) Villafafia raised no objection to signing the agreement. Acosta told OPR that
he wanted to give the “trial team” a chance to “speak up and let him know” if they did not feel
comfortable with the agreement. Villafafia, however, told OPR that she did not understand that
she was being given an opportunity to object to the agreement; rather, she believed Acosta wanted
her to sign it because he was taking an “‘arm’s length” approach and signaling this “was not his
deal.” The fact that the top decision maker believed he was giving the line AUSA an opportunity
to reflect and stop the process if she believed the deal was inappropriate, but the line AUSA
believed she was being ordered to sign the agreement because her boss wanted to distance himself
from the decision, reflects a serious communication gap.

As another example, at one point, Villafafia, frustrated and concerned about the decisions
being made concerning a possible resolution, requested a meeting with Acosta; in a sternly worded
rebuke, Menchel rejected the request. Although Menchel told OPR that he was not prohibiting
Villafafia from speaking to Acosta, Villafafia interpreted Menchel’s email to mean that she could
not seek a meeting with Acosta. As a consequence, Acosta made his decision about a state
resolution and the term of incarceration without any direct input from Villafafia. Acosta told OPR
that he was unaware that Villafafia had sought a meeting with him and he would have met with
her if she had asked him directly. OPR did not find any written evidence of a meeting involving
both Acosta—the final decision maker—and Villafafia—the person most knowledgeable about the
facts and the law—before Acosta made his decision to resolve the case through state charges or to
offer the two-year term, and Villafafia said she did not have any input into the decision. Although
a U.S. Attorney is certainly not required to have such direct input, and it may be that Menchel
presented what he believed to be Villafafia’s views, OPR found no evidence that Acosta was aware
of Villafafia’s strong views about, and objections to, the proposed resolution.”*°

Two logistical problems hindered effective communication. First, the senior managers
involved in the case—Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel—had offices located in Miami, while the
offices of the individuals most familiar with facts of the case—Villafafia and, to a lesser extent,
Lourie—were located in West Palm Beach. Consequently, Villafafia’s discussions with her senior
256 In her 2017 Declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia stated that, given the challenges of obtaining
victims’ cooperation with a federal prosecution, “I believed and still believe that a negotiated resolution of the matter
was in the best interests of the [USAO] and the victims as a whole. The [USAO] had also reached that same
conclusion.” Several subjects pointed to this statement as indicating that Villafafia in fact supported the NPA. In her
OPR interview, however, Villafafia drew a distinction between resolving the investigation through negotiations that
led to what in her view was a reasonable outcome, which she would have supported, and “this negotiated resolution”—
that is, the NPA—which she did not support.
