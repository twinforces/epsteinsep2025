Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page17 of 113
STATEMENT OF THE ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW

1. Whether the District Court misapplied U.S. v. Annabi, 771 F.2d 670 (2d Cir.
1985) (per curiam) to impose limits on a non-prosecution agreement contrary to
the agreement’s plain meaning and endorsed its untenable interpretation without
discovery or a hearing to determine the intent of the parties.

2. Whether the District Court erred in extending the statute of limitations for
violations of §2423(a) and §1591 under §3283 and whether the 2003 amendment
to §3283 or §3299 applies retroactively to offenses committed before enactment of
these statutes.

3. Whether the court should have granted a new trial after it learned that a juror
made materially false statements in jury selection that concealed that he had
experienced the “exact same thing” as the victims, namely, childhood sexual
abuse, because truthful answers given at the time of voir dire would have provided
a valid basis for a cause challenge.

4. Whether the District Court erred in refusing to correct the jury’s
misunderstanding (evident from a Jury Note) under Count 4 that sexual activity in
New Mexico violated New York Penal Law §130.55), which caused the jury to
convict Defendant solely based on evidence of sexual activity outside of New
York, thereby constituting a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the
Indictment.
