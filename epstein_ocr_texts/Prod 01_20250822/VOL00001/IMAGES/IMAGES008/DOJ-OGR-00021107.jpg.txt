Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page60 of 113
3283 should be read through a categorical rather than case-specific lens. See U.S.
v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 2319 (2019) (interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(3)); Kawashima,
565 U.S. at 483 (interpreting 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i)); Leocal v. Ashcroft,
543 U.S. 1, 7 (2004) (interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 16(b)); U.S. v. Morgan, 393 F.3d
192, 198 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (interpreting 18 U.S.C. § 3237(a)).

Indeed, the Supreme Court has—on multiple occasions—firmly held that a
categorical approach must be employed to interpret statutes of limitation that bear
striking resemblance to §3283. For instance, the Supreme Court has held that a
proviso of the internal revenue laws, extending from three to six years the statute
of limitations for prosecuting “offenses involving defrauding or attempting to
defraud the United States,” applies only when “defrauding or an attempt to defraud
the United States is an ingredient under the statute defining the offense.” U.S. v
Noveck, 271 U.S. 201, 202-203, 204 (1926) (emphasis added) (quoting Act of
November 17, 1921, c. 124, 42 Stat. 220, codified in its present version at 26
U.S.C. § 6531). Noveck held that this provision did not extend the statute of
limitations for perjury, because fraud is not a required element of that crime. /d.;
see also Scharton, 285 U.S. at 522 (same, with respect to tax evasion). Indeed,
Noveck found this statute inapplicable even when the indictment specifically
alleges fraud, because such fraud allegations are “mere surplusage,” not an
element of the offense. 271 U.S. at 203.
