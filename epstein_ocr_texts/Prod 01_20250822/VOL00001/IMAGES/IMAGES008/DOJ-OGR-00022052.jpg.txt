_ Attorney General William Barr a nnounced following Jeffrey Epstein’s epparent suicide
Saturday morning that Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz launched an
Investigation into the circumstances of the accused child sex trefficker's death in his prison
cell.
This move is in addition to the FBI inquiry already underway. The FBI declined to comment
about its investigation.
“lL was appalled to learn that Jeffrey Epstein was found dead early this morning from an
apparent suicide while in federal custody," Barr said. “Mr. Epstein’s death raises serious
questions that must be answered,”
Neither the Justice Department not the inspector general's office immediately responded to
the Washington Examiner's request for further details.
The Bureau of Prisons released s statement on Saturday stating that the jet-setting financier
and sex offender was found “unresponsive in his cell” located in the Special Housing Unit at
around 6:30 a.m. this morning following “an apparent suicide.” Officials said lifesaving efforts
were immediately undertaken and that emergency medical services were quickly called,
Epstein was brought to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.
Epstein reportedly hanged himself, and a gurney carrying Epstein's body was wheeled out of
the Manhattan Correctional Center around 7:30 a.m. this morning, according to reports.
According to a representative for NYC Office of Chief Medical Examiner who spoke with the
Washington Examiner, “there is no official cause of death yet" as "the medical examiner has to
do their job."
"We are investigating the cause of death and we have an open case," the representative said.
The 14-page indictment against Epstein alleged that he sexually exploited dozens of minor
girls at his homes in Manhattan, New York, and Palm Beach, among other locations, between
2002 and 2005 and perhaps beyond. Some of the victims were ostensibly as young as 14 at the
time the alleged crimes occurred. Epstein allegedly “created a vast network of underage ~
victims for him to sexually exptoit"and “maintained a steady supply of new victims."
