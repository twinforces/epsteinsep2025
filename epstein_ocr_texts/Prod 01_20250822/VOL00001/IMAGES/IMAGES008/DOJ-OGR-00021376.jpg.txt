search warrant was executed, on. that property, the computer equipment associated with those:
eaineras had. been removed. Villafaha knew who had. ‘possession of the computer, equipment.

Surveillance images might have: shown. the victims’ visits, and photographic: evidence of their
appearance at the time of. their encounters with Epstéin could have countered the anticipated,
argument that.Epstcin was. unaware these girls were minors. The: surveillance: video might have:
shown additional Victiis the investigators had not Yeti identified. Such images could have been
powerful visual evidence of the.large number of girls Epstein victimized and the frequency of their
visits to: his home; potentially. persuasive: proof to a jury that this was not:a simple “solicitation”

‘case.

Epstein’s personal, computers:possibly contained. even more damning:evidence. Villafaria,
told OPR that.the FBI had information .that Epstein used hidden.cameras in-his New 'Y ork:residence
to record his sexual encounters, anid one victim told agents. that Epstcin’s. assistant: photographed
her. in the: nude. Based on 1 this evidence, and experience in other Sex cases involving minors,
child pornogr aphy. Moreover, Epstein lived a: multi: state lifestyle: it was reasonable: to ‘assume:
that he may have transmitted still images: or-videos taken, at his Florida residence over'the internet:
to be accessed while: at. one of his other homes or while traveling. The interstate transmission of,
child pornography. was a separate, and serious, federal crime that. could have changed ‘the entire
complexion of the case against Epstein. 253 Villafaiia’ told OPR, “[I]f the evidence had. been what:
we suspected. it was... [i]t would have ‘put. this; case: completely to bed. It also would. have:
completely defeated. all of these arguments about interstate nexus.”

Because she recognized the potential significance of this evidence, Villafana attempted ‘to
obtain the: missing computers. After Villafafia learned. that ‘an ‘individual ‘associated with one of,
Epstein’s. attorneys had:possession. of the computer equipment:that was ‘removed from Epstein’s:
home, she consulted. with Department subject matter experts to determine how best to obtain the
evidence. Following the advice she received and. after notifying her supervisors, Villafaia. took:
legal steps to obtain the computer equipment.

Epstein’s tea, sought to: postpone compliance with the USAO’s demand for the
equipment. In late:June 2007, defense attorney Sanchez requested an.cxtension. of time to comply:
in informing Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie. of the request, Villafana.stressed that “we want to geti
the: computer: equipment. ‘that. was removed. from Epstein’s home prior to the state search, warrant.
as 'soon.as: possible: She agreed .to extend:the date: for producing the: computer‘equipment by one:
week, until July 17, 2007. On that day, Epstein initiated litigation regarding the computer
equipment. That litigation.was still pending at the end of July, when Acosta decided to :resolve’

am 18 U.S.C. § 2251 (a) provides,.in. pertinent:part:
