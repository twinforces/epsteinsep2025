interviewing Epstein’s lawyers. Notably, the prosecutors could not recall why the
clause had been added, much less who it was meant to immunize. SA104-106.

The Court also relied on the United States Attorneys’ Manual’s directive that
districts not bind other districts without the express written approval of the United
States Attorneys in the affected districts and the Judiciary Act of 1789 to suggest that
US Attorneys are “cabined to their specific district unless otherwise directed.” 118
F.4th at 265. Notably, the Manual also contains an admonition that USAOs who do
not wish to bind USAOs in other districts explicitly limit the scope of an NPA to
their districts. Justice Manual 9-27-630. This admonition implicitly acknowledges
that AUSAs can bind other districts and that it is the obligation of the government to
make explicit any limitation in the scope of immunity.

ARGUMENT
EN BANC REVIEW IS NECESSARY TO DETERMINE WHETHER
ANNABI’S CANON OF CONSTRUCTION FOR PLEA AGREEMENTS
SHOULD BE OVERRULED OR LIMITED

The Panel based its decision on Annabi. Annabi should be overruled because
its canon of construction for interpreting plea agreements conflicts with the
authoritative decisions of other circuits that have addressed the issue and stands in
tension with what the Supreme Court and this Circuit have written about plea and
immunity agreements.
