***)... V. Conclusion. For the. foregoing réasons; the Court denies the Defendant's

‘Rule 29 motion becatise the. jury's. guilty verdicts were: supported. by’ the witness
testimony and documentary evidence presented at.trial. The: Court.denies the: —

Defendant's motion, based on:constructive amendment or-variance because;the jury

‘instructions, the Government's evidence at-trial, and summiation all captured.the core

of criminality charged in the Indictment; and:the Defendant was'not prejudiced by any
alleged ‘variance.. Further, because the: Government:ncither. intentionally: delayed-its

prosecution: nor was the Detendant prejudiced. by any’ delay,. the C ourt also denies the;

‘Defendant's motion as to multiplicity. The. Government concedes that, é ount One i is
multiplicitous with.Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count:Five is

multiplicitous with, Count Three. Court, Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the

Defendant's participation ‘in, the same decade-long unlawful agreement with the
-Defendant's continuous  coconspirator,, Jeffrey Epstein, to groom/and sexually abuse

underage girls. Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction.on Counts
Three; Four, and Six. The Defendant's. Seritencing' date remains scheduled :forJune 28,

2022.. The € ourt/previously set a schedule: for sentencing: submissions that remains in.
