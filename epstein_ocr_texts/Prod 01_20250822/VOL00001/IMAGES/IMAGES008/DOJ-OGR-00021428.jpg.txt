camera memory cards seized by the PBPD in order to have them forensically examined for deleted

By early April 2008, as the defense pursued its appeal to the Department’s Criminal
Division, Acosta predicted in an email to Villafafia and Sloman that federal charges against Epstein
were “more and more likely.” Villafafia asked Oosterbaan for help to “move this [Criminal
Division review] process along,” noting that the defense continued to undermine the government’s
case by deposing the victims “under the guise of ‘trial prep’ for the state case” and that the “agents
and the victims” were “losing their patience.”

On April 24, 2008, Villafafia emailed Sloman and USAO Criminal Division Chief Senior
asking whether she had the “green light” to file charges and raising the same concerns she had
expressed to Oosterbaan. Villafafia further cautioned that, although she was planning to file
charges on May 6, if that was not going to happen, “then we all need to meet with the victims, the
agents, and the police officers to decide how the case will be resolved and to provide them with an
explanation for the delay.” Because the Department’s Criminal Division did not conclude its
review of Epstein’s appeal by May 6, however, Villafafia did not file charges that day.

VII. USAO SUPERVISORS CONSIDER CVRA OBLIGATIONS IN AN UNRELATED

MATTER AND IN LIGHT OF A NEW FIFTH CIRCUIT OPINION

During the period after the NPA was signed, and before Epstein complied with the NPA
by entering his state guilty pleas, the USAO supervisors were explicitly made aware of a conflict
between the Department’s position that CVRA’s victims’ rights attached upon the filing of a
criminal charge and a new federal appellate ruling to the contrary. The contemporaneous
communications confirm that in 2008, Acosta and Sloman were aware of the Department’s policy
regarding the issue.

Unrelated to the Epstein investigation, on April 18, 2008, Acosta and Sloman received a
citizen complaint from an attorney who requested to meet with them regarding his belief that the
Florida Bar had violated his First Amendment rights. The attorney asserted that the CVRA
guaranteed him “an absolute right to meet” with USAO officials because he believed that he was
the victim of a federal crime. Acosta forwarded the message to the USAO Appellate Division
Chief, who informed Acosta and Sloman that, according to the 2005 Guidelines, “our obligations
under [the CVRA] are not triggered until charges are filed.” On April 24, 2008, the Appellate
Division Chief emailed Acosta and Sloman, stating that she had “confirmed with DOJ that [her]
reading of [the 2005 Guidelines] is correct and that our obligations under [the CVRA] are not
triggered until a case is filed.”°

On May 7, 2008, the Appellate Division Chief sent Acosta and Sloman a copy of a U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit opinion issued that day, In re Dean, holding that a victim’s
ae The forensic examination did not locate useful evidence on the memory cards.

343 The Appellate Division Chief advised Acosta that Acosta could inform the complainant that, prior to the
initiation of charges, the investigating agency was responsible for carrying out the Department’s statutory obligations
to the victim.
