accurate response. Yet Juror 50 did not read closely Question 49 or consider carefully his
answer to it on November 4.

These evolving answers do not reflect Juror 50 changing his story so much as an
explanation of a complex and fraught set of events and relationships from decades before. The
Court is cognizant that jurors may well assign their own emotional connotations to terms like
“family” rather than interpret it in the technical or legal manner as would an attorney or judge.

provided two overlapping explanations. He first testified that he “didn’t think this would
happen.” /d. That is, he explained, he “did not think that anybody— certainly [his] family or
friends would find this out,” despite the significant media attention that the case had received.
Id. at 23. When the Court returned to this issue later in the hearing, Juror 50 added that in the
