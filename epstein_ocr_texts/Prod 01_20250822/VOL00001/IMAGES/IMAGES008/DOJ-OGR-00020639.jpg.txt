SDNY°CM/ECF: NextGen’ Version 1.6!

‘adopt the:Defendant's proposed:redactions, which. are consented toby’ the Government.
The Court's decision is guided by the three-part tést articulated by the Second Circuit in
‘Lugosch v: Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 1.10,(2d Cir. 2006). Under this test; the
Court:must: (1) determine whether the documents'in:question are "judicial, documents;”
(ii). assess thé weight of thé common law: ‘presumption of access to thé materials: and (ii)
‘balance competing considerations against the: presumption of access. Td. at 1.1920. "Such
countervailing factors include but:are’not limited, to "the danger of i “impairing law
‘enforcement or judicial. efficiency’ and.'the privacy: interests of those:resisting

disclosure." Td. at 1:20 (quoting: United.States v. Amodco, 711..F3d.1044, 1050 (2d Cir:
1995) ("Amodeo II")). The. proposed: redactions satisty this test. First, the Court finds that

‘the. Defendant's. letter‘motions are" "relevant to the performance of ‘ihe judicial. function
‘and useful in the judicial.process,” thereby qualifying as ‘a "judicial document" for
purposes of the first clement of the Lugoselr test. United States v. Amodéo (“Amod¢o I"),
44 F.3d. 141, 145 (2d. Cir. 1995). And while. the Court assumes ‘that the:common. law.
presumption of access attaches, in, balancing. competing considerations against the
presumption of access; the Court finds that the are@umeits the Defendant has put
‘forthineluding, most notably, the priv acy~interests: of the individuals referenced.in the:
lettersfavor het proposed and: tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED'‘to
