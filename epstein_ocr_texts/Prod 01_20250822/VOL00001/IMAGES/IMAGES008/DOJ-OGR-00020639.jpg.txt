2/22/23, 1:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version 1.6

adopt the Defendant's proposed redactions, which are consented to by the Government.
The Court's decision is guided by the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the
Court must: (1) determine whether the documents in question are "judicial documents;"
(11) assess the weight of the common law presumption of access to the materials; and (iii)
balance competing considerations against the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. "Such
countervailing factors include but are not limited to 'the danger of impairing law
enforcement or judicial efficiency' and 'the privacy interests of those resisting
disclosure." Id. at 120 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050 (2d Cir.
1995) ("Amodeo II")). The proposed redactions satisfy this test. First, the Court finds that
the Defendant's letter motions are "relevant to the performance of the judicial function
and useful in the judicial process," thereby qualifying as a "judicial document" for
purposes of the first element of the Lugosch test. United States v. Amodeo ("Amodeo I"),
44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995). And while the Court assumes that the common law
presumption of access attaches, in balancing competing considerations against the
presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Defendant has put
forthincluding, most notably, the privacy interests of the individuals referenced in the
lettersfavor her proposed and tailored redactions. The Defendant is hereby ORDERED to
docket the redacted versions of the two letters by December 4, 2020. For the reasons
outlined in the Government's letter dated December 2, 2020, Dkt. No. 80, the Court
DENIES the Defendant's request for an in camera conference. In order to protect the
privacy interests referenced in the Defendant's November 25, 2020 letter, the Court will
permit the Defendant to make her submission in writing and to propose narrowly tailored
redactions. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and to jointly prepare a
briefing schedule for the Defendant's forthcoming renewed motion for release on bail. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/3/2020)(bw) (Entered: 12/03/2020)
