The Court: Are all the victims in both these cases in
agreement with the terms of the plea?

Ms. Belohlavek: I have spoken to several myself and I have
spoken to counsel, through counsel as to the
other victim, and I believe, yes.

The Court: And with regard to the victims under age
eighteen, is that victim’s parents or guardian
in agreement with the plea?

Ms. Belohlavek: That victim is not under age 18 any more and
that’s why we spoke with her counsel.

The Court: And she is in agreement with the plea?

Ms. Belohlavek: Yes. 176

When the court asked if the plea was “in any way tied to any promises or representations
by any civil attorneys or other jurisdictions,” Goldberger and Belohlavek, with Epstein present,
spoke with the judge at sidebar and disclosed the existence of the “confidential” non-prosecution
agreement with the USAO, and the court ordered that a copy of it be filed under seal with the court.

After the court accepted Epstein’s guilty pleas, and imposed sentence on him pursuant to
the plea agreement, Epstein was taken into custody to begin serving his sentence immediately.

In the aftermath of the plea, numerous individuals familiar with the investigation expressed
positive reactions to the outcome, and Villafafia received several congratulatory messages.
Oosterbaan wrote, “Congratulations, Marie—at long last! Your work on this matter was truly
exceptional, and you obtained a very significant result that will serve the victims well.” One senior
colleague who was familiar with the case noted, “This case only resolved with the filthy rich bad
guy going to jail because of your dedication and determination.” Another wrote, “If it had not
been for you, he would have gotten away with it.” The CEOS Trial Attorney who had worked
briefly with Villafafia told her, “But for your tenacity, he’d be somewhere ruining another child’s
life.” One victim’s attorney stated, “[G]reat job of not letting this guy off.” But Villafafia was not
satisfied with the outcome, responding to one colleague, “After all the hell they put me through, I
don’t feel like celebrating 18 months. He should be spending 18 years in jail.”

Acosta later publicly stated that the FBI Special Agent in Charge called him “to offer
congratulations” and “to praise our prosecutors for holding firm against the likes of Messrs. Black,
176 Plea Hearing Transcript at 20, 42. OPR was unable to determine to which victims Belohlavek was referring,
and Belohlovek did not recall during her OPR interview, but it is possible that she was referring only to the victims of
the charged crimes rather than to all of the victims identified in either the state or federal investigations. Belohlavek
told OPR that because of the nature of the charges (that is, involving prostitution), she did not know whether
“technically under the law” the girls were “victims” whom she was required to notify of the plea hearing.
