to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse by and with Jeffrey Epstein, her

Indictment. The jury deliberated for over five days and returned a verdict of guilty on five of the
six counts. Two of these counts of conviction charged the Defendant with substantive violations

Trafficking Victims Protection Act as to Count Six. The other three counts of conviction,
Counts One, Three, and Five, charged the Defendant with conspiring with Jeffrey Epstein to
violate those same statutes from 1994 to 2004.
