‘Lourie. followed up‘his, email:to Villafana with. one to Menchel, tn-which Lourie: reiterated
the: potential benefits of.a:pre-indictinent: plea, explaining that he and, Villafana believed “the best:
thing to do is charge Epstein by complaint, assuming we: decide to charge him... The:
[sentencing] guidelines will be inthe 20 year range, so we would. feed to plead ‘him to one or'two
conspiracies to cap him and. there::is.no telling if a judge would go for that once: we: indict. al
Menchel résponded that he and Acosta: would read the proséeution memorandum and “[ w]e. can,
discuss after. that.”

Later that, afternoon, Villafaria sent, Louri¢:an email, which Lourie forwarded to Menchel,
explaining that a “conservative calculation” of Epstein’ Ss potential. sentencing. exposure under the.
US. Sentencing’ Guidelines would be 168 to 210 months, and that in her view, the facts warranted,
an upward departure from. that range.. Villafata told OPR. that: although Lourie proposed. some:
changes tothe draft indictment, at that:pointno one had told her'that the evidence was insufficient;
to support the proposed charges or that the office did not want to go forward.with the case.

7 . In. an email to Acosta and. Menchel. on, May: 11, 2007, Lourie ‘recommended charging:
Epstein’by complaint and. seeking a pre-indictment plea:

My current thoughts are'that we should:charge him. Not sure that I
agréé with the, charging Strategy as it is now, but atithis point I think
we only need to get onthe same:page-as to whether the statutes:cover
‘the. conduct.and whether the conduct: is the-type we should charge.

Ithink the:answer to both. is yes, although there.is some:risk.on some
ofthe statutes as this is uncharted territory to some degree. We can.
decide later what the [charging document] should look like:precisely
and which victims should be charged.

T also think if we choose to go forward, we should start with.:a
complaint, arrest hith, detain hin. = and then yO see 6 iPheswants
a a plea than if we indict him and need: the court’ 'S APProv. al to dismiss
counts. We will’need to:cap him, with conspiracy counts to'make a.
plea attractive:and the court could give us a hard.time'with that iffwe
try. to disntiss indicted counts.

Although héer'supétvisors were communicating among themselves about the case, Villafana.
was unaware’ of those discussions. and. was frustrated that she was ‘not receiving ‘more: feedback.
She cofitiitied preparing to charge Epstein: Two weeks after submitting the prosécution
memorandum,, on May 14, 2007, Villafana informed. Lourie. and. Menchel by ‘email ‘that Epstein
was flying to New Jersey, from ‘the: Virgin Islands, and, she asked:whether she. could file charges
the: next day. Menchel responded. that “[y]ou. will ‘not have approval to go forward tomorrow,”
and explained that:Acosta “has your [prosecution] memo,” but.was: at an out-of-town. conference,
adding, “This is obviously a-very significant case and [A]lex wants to take his time making sure

a ‘Lourie told OPR that:he was.reterring to one or two-counts-of conspiracy under 18'U.S.G. § 371, the general,

“omnibus” federal.conspiracy stafute’that carries a maximimySentence of five’yeats.
