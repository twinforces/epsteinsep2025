SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 U.S, 142, 162 (2012)
(citing Burgess v. United. States, 552 U.S. 124, 131 n.3
(2008))..And the text of Section. 3283 goes even further
beyond the definition provided in Section 3509 by cov:

Congress therefore did not require that: a particular
statute have actual sexual contact with:a minor as an.
