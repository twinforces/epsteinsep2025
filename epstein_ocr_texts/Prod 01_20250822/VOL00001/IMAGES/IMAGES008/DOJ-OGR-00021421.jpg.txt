“federal authorities are. expected. to: drop. their :probe ‘into whether Epstein broke any. federal

Nevertheless, as Epstein’s team. continued to argue to higher levels of the Department:that:
there was no appropriate federal interest in‘prosecuting, Epstein and.thus no basis for the NPA, and.
with his:attorneys asserting that “the:facts:had gotten better-for Epstein,” Villafatia came to’believe:
that Epstein would likely breach the NPA..?° In January 2008, Villafaia informed her'supervisors
that the FBI “had:very tight contact with. the victims. several months. ago ‘when we were prepared
to [file charges], but-all ‘the shenanigans over’ ‘the-past few months have resulted ‘inno contact with,
the-vast. majority of the victims.” Villafatia then proposed that the EBI “re-establish contact with.
all the victims so that;we know we can rély of ther .at trial.’ ‘Villafaia told OPR that at this
point, “[w]hile the. case was being i inv estigat[ed] and prepared for. indictment, I did not: ‘prepare or
send any victiin, notification, letters—there simply was nothing to update. I did not-feccive any’
victim calls during this time.”

case agent. informed Villafafia in. an cmail that-the Victim Specialist sent a “standard. forny [FBI]
letter to all. the remaining identified victims.” These 2008 letters were ‘identical to the EBI form
letters‘the Victim, Specialist had sent’to victims between August 28, 2006, and October 12, 2007.
Like those previous letters, most of which.were sent.before the NPA was signed.on‘September 24,
2007, the 2008 letters described the case as “currently under investigation” and noted 'that[t]his
can. be a lengthy. process and ‘we request ‘your continued patience: while we conduct a thorough.
