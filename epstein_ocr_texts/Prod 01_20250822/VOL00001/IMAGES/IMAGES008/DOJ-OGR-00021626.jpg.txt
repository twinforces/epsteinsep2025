1 the conviction.
2 The government has asked for an immense sentence. We
3 recognize that any sentence in this case is going to be
4 Significant and is going to be immensely punishing. The
5 probation department, based on the original guidelines in the
6 presentence report, recommended a downward variance to 20
7 years. That recommendation is now higher than the guideline
8 range that is applicable in this case. But we ask the Court to
g consider the justification that probation articulated in the
10 presentence report in fashioning a sentence that takes into
11 consideration that a sentence lower than the guideline range is
12 appropriate in this case.
L3 The government's sentence asks for the outer limits,
14 and although we still believe that even the recommendation is
15 too high, a sentence within the guideline range now may be more
16 reasonable, but it still does not take into consideration some
17 of the various factors that we have brought to the Court's
18 attention in our submission. Simply stated, based upon the
19 conduct of conviction, the government's request is out of
20 proportion. Jeffrey Epstein would have faced the same
a1 sentence, and he is clearly far more culpable than Ghislaine
22 Maxwell.
23 THE COURT: You mean he would have faced the same
24 guidelines.
25 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes, that is correct, Judge.
