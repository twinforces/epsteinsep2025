policies which relate to the “much larger context” at the BOP (Mot. 6, 7, 9, 10).

AS an initial matter, the Government has satisfied its Rule 16, Brady, and Giglio obligations
and is not in possession of the additional materials that Thomas seeks. More importantly, Thomas
is not entitled to compel the Government to collect the additional records for at least four separate
reasons. First, the records are not “material” to preparing a defense because they are wholly
irrelevant to the false statement charges against Thomas and are intended to prompt jurors to
nullify the charges against him. Second, the BOP records Thomas seeks are not in the “possession”
of the prosecution team, and there is no legal basis for compelling the Government to collect
materials from other agencies or components of the Department of Justice who are not and were
not part of the criminal investigation that led to the charges against Thomas. Third, there is no
legal basis to require the Government to produce a draft of the report being prepared by the DOJ-
OIG, which is subject to the deliberative process privilege. Fourth, Thomas is not entitled to
discovery relating to what happened to other MCC employees when they “falsif[ied] the same
documents,” (Mot. 6), because he has utterly failed to identify evidence that the decision to
prosecute him had a discriminatory effect and was motivated by a discriminatory purpose.
Thomas’s motion should be denied in all respects.
