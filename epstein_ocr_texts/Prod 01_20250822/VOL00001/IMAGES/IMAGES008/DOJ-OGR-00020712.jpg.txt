02/04/2022 593 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: As a post-trial house-keeping matter, attached to this
Order are the Court Exhibits. The parties have proposed redactions to several exhibits and
the sealing of Court Exhibit 4. The Court concludes that the proposed redactions are
consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid
Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006), and narrowly tailored. The redactions
serve the purpose of protecting the anonymity of jurors and of victim-witnesses subject to
the Court's anonymity order. With respect to Court Exhibit 4, rather than seal the entire
document, the Court has redacted the information that would potentially identify the
victim-witness who testified pursuant to the Court's anonymity order. Unredacted copies
of the Court Exhibits will be filed under seal. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

02/11/2022 596 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' letters addressing
the Defendant's request to temporarily seal her motion for a new trial and accompanying
exhibits, and the Governments response in opposition and accompanying exhibits. See
Dkt. Nos. 590, 594, 595. Several media organizations have also filed letters seeking
unsealing. The Court 1s also in receipt of Juror 50's motion to intervene. Both the
Government and the Defendant oppose intervention. The Defendant seeks to strike or, in
the alternative, seal Juror 50's motion. For the reasons outlined more fully below, the
Court rules as follows. First, the Defendant's motion to temporarily seal in their entirety
all documents related to the motion for a new trial is DENIED. Any sealing of judicial
documents must be narrowly tailored to serve competing interests. (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 2/11/22)(Gw) (Entered: 02/11/2022)

the Defendant's motion for a new trial, it may submit to the Court via email a motion for
leave to do so on or before February 18, 2022. The Court will only consider such a
