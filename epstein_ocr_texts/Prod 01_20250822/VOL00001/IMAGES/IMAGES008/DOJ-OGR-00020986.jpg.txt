Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein. The overarching conspiracy—which, as
the Government argued and proved at trial, employed a single “playbook” to groom and sexually
abuse underage girls—constitutes a single conspiracy offense with multiple victims. Because the
Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits the Court from imposing multiple punishments for the same
offense, the Court will enter judgment on Count Three alone among the conspiracy counts. This
legal conclusion in no way calls into question the factual findings made by the jury. Rather, it
underscores that the jury unanimously found—three times over—that the Defendant is guilty of
conspiring with Epstein to entice, transport, and traffic underage girls for sexual abuse.

conspiracy to transport individuals under the age of seventeen to travel in interstate commerce
with intent to engage in sexual activity illegal under New York law, in violation of 18 U.S.C.
