Ido think it’s important to look: back on this, and. try to be in. the
shoes of the ‘thought ‘process in..2006 and. *07 when trafficking:
prosecutions were fairly new, When... . more so than. ‘today, some
jurors may’ have looked at this: as: prostitution, and... . [a] judge’s
tolerance for. victim shaming may.have:...... caused more: hesitation.
on the part of Victins...

Finally, Acosta told OPR.that a.state-based resolution offered more flexibility:in.fashioning
a sentence, because he belicyed ‘prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a ‘federal district,
court.in the Southern District.of:Florida to approve'a federal: ‘plea fora. stipulated | binding. sentence
that differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range.“

In.summarizing, his:thinking at:the time, Acosta told:‘OPR,

The: way the: matter. came to the: office was, the state: wasn’t doing
chough. It.didn’t provide ‘for prison time. It didn’t provide ‘for’
registr ation, and then you had the:restitution issue. There'were legal
issues... «. There were witness issues. And,;... we could go to trial

- and.we may.or may not‘prevail. ‘Alternatively, we ‘could-look. at.
a pre-indictment resoltition, and at various points, the office went
‘back: and. ‘forth. between. a federal ‘pre-indictment. resolution,, and ‘a
state pre-indictment resolution.

Acosta told OPR that, in. the. end, “there: was a preference for deferring, to the state” because; in
part; the facts: of the Epstein case at the. time appeared, to constitute solicitation. of prostitution,
rather. than trafficking, and a.federal prosecution would.be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained
that he did hot View it as problematic to défer resoltition of the case to the state, although as the
Epstein. case’ played out, the federal. role-became “more intrusive” than.he had-anticipated, because.
the defeiise tried to getithe staté-to “circumvent and’undermine” thé outcome..

Attorney's Office could have: proceeded. against Epsicin by. way.ot ancitformation, but decided to ‘zo ‘into the graiid.
jury because-the’State Attorney*s Office “didn*t like’thescase” and wanted “political cover” for, declining-the case or
‘proceeding:onva lesser,charge.

OX Menchel told ORR, however, ‘that thé. federal judges in’ West Palm Beach. were ‘highly, reparded and. were.
generally, viewed as “pro-prosecution.”

of Acosta said that “dismissing a.number of counts. and then doing ‘a [RJule: 11. is; not something, that [South

Federal Rule of'Criminal Procedure ‘1 LeeVCLWE) allows-the: parties to agree on.a: specific. sentence as:part of
