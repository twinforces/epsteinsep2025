I do think it’s important to look back on this, and try to be in the
shoes of the thought process in 2006 and ’07 when trafficking
prosecutions were fairly new, when... more so than today, some
jurors may have looked at this as prostitution, and .. . [a] judge’s
tolerance for victim shaming may have . . . caused more hesitation
on the part of victims... .©
Finally, Acosta told OPR that a state-based resolution offered more flexibility in fashioning
a sentence, because he believed prosecutors would have difficulty persuading a federal district
court in the Southern District of Florida to approve a federal plea for a stipulated binding sentence
that differed from the otherwise applicable federal sentencing guidelines range.“
In summarizing his thinking at the time, Acosta told OPR,
The way the matter came to the office was, the state wasn’t doing
enough. It didn’t provide for prison time. It didn’t provide for
registration, and then you had the restitution issue. There were legal
issues .... There were witness issues. And... we could go to trial
...and we may or may not prevail. Alternatively, we could look at
a pre-indictment resolution, and at various points, the office went
back and forth between a federal pre-indictment resolution, and a
state pre-indictment resolution.
Acosta told OPR that, in the end, “there was a preference for deferring to the state” because, in
part, the facts of the Epstein case at the time appeared to constitute solicitation or prostitution
rather than trafficking, and a federal prosecution would be “uncharted territory.” Acosta explained
that he did not view it as problematic to defer resolution of the case to the state, although as the
Epstein case played out, the federal role became “more intrusive” than he had anticipated, because
the defense tried to get the state to “circumvent and undermine” the outcome.
Attorney’s Office could have proceeded against Epstein by way of an information, but decided to go into the grand
jury because the State Attorney’s Office “didn’t like the case” and wanted “political cover” for declining the case or
proceeding on a lesser charge.
83 Menchel told OPR, however, that the federal judges in West Palm Beach were highly regarded and were
generally viewed as “pro-prosecution.”
64 Acosta said that “dismissing a number of counts and then doing a [R]ule 11 is not something that [South
Florida federal district] judges tend to do.” Other subjects also told OPR that the federal judges in the Southern District
of Florida were generally considered averse to pleas that bound them on sentencing, commonly referred to as “Rule
11(c) pleas.”
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) allows the parties to agree on a specific sentence as part of
a plea agreement. The court is required to impose that sentence if the court accepts the plea agreement; if the court
does not accept the agreed upon plea and sentence, the agreement is void. Villafafia told OPR that Rule 11(c) pleas
were “uncommon” in the Southern District of Florida, as the “judges do not like to be told . . . what sentence to
impose.” Menchel similarly told OPR that the USAO viewed federal judges in the Southern District of Florida as
averse to Rule 11(c) pleas, although Menchel had negotiated such pleas. Villafafia told OPR that she had never offered
a Rule 11(c) plea in any of her cases and had no experience with such pleas.
