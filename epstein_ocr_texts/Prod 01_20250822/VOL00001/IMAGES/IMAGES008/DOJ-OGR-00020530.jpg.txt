07/12/2021 | 314 | LETTER addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from David Oscar Markus dated 7/9/21
re: The Governments request should be denied because (1) undersigned counsel does
not currently represent Ms. Maxwell, and (2) the Op-Ed did not violate the local rules.
(jw) (Entered: 07/12/2021)

07/30/2021 | 315 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Government has moved for an order requiring
David Markus to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.1 following an op-ed that he
authored opining on the merits of this pending case. Dkt. No. 309. Mr. Markus is
therefore ORDERED to comply with Local Criminal Rule 23.1. The Government does
not ask the Court to discipline Mr. Markus based on his op—ed and the Court declines
to consider whether it violated Rule 23.1 given the potential lack of clarity with respect
to whether Mr. Markus was bound by the rule. The Court emphasizes that the rule
provides illustrative examples of statements that "presumptively involve a substantial
likelihood that their public dissemination will interfere with a fair trial or otherwise
prejudice the due administration of justice within the meaning of the rule." S.D.N.Y.
Local Criminal Rule 23(d). Going forward, Mr. Markus and all lawyers associated
with the pending case are now clearly on notice that their conduct falls under the
purview of Local Criminal Rule 23.1. Indeed, the above concerns do not apply only to
Mr. Markus. This Court has previously noted that counsel|[,] agents for the parties and
counsel for potential witnesses must take care to protect the Defendant's right to a fair
trial by an impartial jury. Dkt. No. 28. This Court is cognizant that criminal matters
heading toward trial are especially sensitive to extrajudicial statements. All those
associated with this case must act to ensure the case is tried solely in court or else they
risk being deemed responsible for any trial delay or for undermining the integrity of
the upcoming trial. See S.D.N.Y. Local Criminal Rule 23.1(h). In addition to the
impact it could have on this matter, failure to comply could also result in attorney
discipline. Id. Rule 23.1(4). (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 7/30/21)(jw)
