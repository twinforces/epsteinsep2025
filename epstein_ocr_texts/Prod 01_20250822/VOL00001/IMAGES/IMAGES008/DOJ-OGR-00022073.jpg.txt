Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document 35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 11 of 34
dated April 1, 2020, explaining that any responsive information in the Government’s possession
and subject to disclosure had already been produced. The letter further explained that to the extent
the requests called for items not in the Government’s possession or not subject to disclosure,
Thomas had not identified any legal basis or authority for his requests and the Government was
not aware of any authority requiring the Government to obtain or produce the requested
information.
On April 9, 2020, Thomas filed the instant motion seeking an order from the Court
compelling the Government to produce the following:
e The Inspector General’s report investigating the death of Jeffrey Epstein
and BOP policies and procedures (referred to herein as the “Inspector
General’s Report”), as well as all supporting memoranda and other
documents, (Mot. 4-5);
e Any and all “reports generated by investigators within the [BOP] regarding
the August 10, 2019 incident” as well as “documents, reports, witness
statements and disciplinary records of any and all MCC employees who
have engaged in the same or similar conduct,” including “results of any
disciplinary proceedings and documents maintained by the BOP regarding
the discipline or administrative adjudication of any other employees who
have failed to conduct rounds or inmate counts,” (Mot. 4, 6);
e Any previously undisclosed reports, witness statements, and documents
created by “any other federal agencies that investigated the circumstances
surrounding the death of Jeffrey Epstein,” (Mot. 4, 7).
For the reasons that follow, Thomas is not entitled to the materials he seeks, and his motion
should be denied.
