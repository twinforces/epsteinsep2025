06/26/2022 | 684 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Defendant's letter in response to the Court's
order regarding the CVRA references a motion by Kate's attorney that accompanied
her impact statement. Dkt. No. 672 at 2 n.1. The Court is not in receipt of this motion.
The Government is ORDERED to docket the motion referenced by the Defendant as
soon as possible but no later than midnight tonight, June 26, 2022. SO ORDERED.

06/27/2022 | 686 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court has now received and docketed the full
set of submissions related to victim impact statements that were filed in accordance
with this Court's prior order. Dkt. No. 668. The Court received statements from Annie
Farmer, Kate, Virginia Giuffre, Maria Farmer, Sarah Ransome, Teresa Helm, Juliette
Bryant, and Elizabeth Stein. As indicated in its prior order, the Court will exercise its
discretion to permit all of these individuals to be heard in writing. Dkt. No. 682. The
Court also denied the Defendants redaction requests. Id. All unredacted statements are
now part of the record. Dkt. Nos. 674, 675-1. Also as previously indicated in its order,
the Court will permit Annie Farmer, Kate, and Virginia Giuffre to make an oral
statement at sentencing if they wish to do so. Dkt. No. 682. Further, having now
reviewed the full set of requests, and having heard from the Government that it does
not object, Dkt. No. 678, the Court deems it feasible to exercise its discretion to permit
the remaining individuals who seek to themselves make an oral statement at
sentencing to do so. They are: Teresa Helm, Sarah Ransome, and Elizabeth Stein. In
order to feasibly accomplish this in light of the anticipated length of the sentencing
proceeding, while ensuring fairness and avoiding delay of sentencing, each individual
speaking orally may read a shortened version of their previously submitted written
statement. The Court deems counsel for the individuals to be responsible for ensuring
that anticipated statements conform to this requirement. The Government shall
promptly provide copies of this order to counsel for the eight individuals who
submitted statements. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
