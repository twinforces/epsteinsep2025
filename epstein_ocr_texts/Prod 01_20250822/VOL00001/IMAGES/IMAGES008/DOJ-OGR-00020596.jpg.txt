Re: Briefing Schedule Request, USA v. Ghislaine Maxwell, Case 22-1426
Dear Ms. O’Hagan Wolfe,

Iam appellate counsel for Defendant-Appellant Ghislaine Maxwell. I was not trial counsel
for Ms. Maxwell. I filed an Acknowledgement and Notice of Appearance on July 15, 2022. The
Clerk required that I file a Form B on that date, as well, although I did not, at that time, have any
information concerning the transcripts.

Pursuant to Local Rule 31.2(a)(1)(A), the ready date for this case was July 15, 2022.
Accordingly, I have until July 29, 2022, to file this briefing schedule request. Pursuant to Local
Rule 31.2(a)(1)(A), I can request no more than 91 days from the ready date as the deadline for
filing Appellant’s Brief. That date would be October 14, 2022.

Pursuant to Local Rule 31.2(a)(1)(D), however, I am permitted to request a later deadline
to file Appellant’s Brief ifthe case involves a voluminous record or extreme hardship would result.
I request that the Court permit me to file Appellant’s Brief on Monday, January 30, 2023, for the
following reasons which I believe satisfy both preconditions identified by the rule. First, as noted,
I am new counsel and have obtained access to the complete file on this case only this week. As
new counsel unfamiliar with the case, I must therefore scrutinize the entire record in order to
provide my client with the most competent and effective representation on appeal. Second, the
record is voluminous in that it involves at least 3,824 pages of transcript including pretrial hearings,
voir dire, trial, sentence, and post-conviction proceedings. In addition, the Docket Report consists
of 738 entries, including but not limited to dozens of fully briefed pretrial motions and motions in
limine, comprising hundreds of pages of legal analysis on important issues. Third, I must conduct
my own research in order to determine what issues I believe provide my client with the best chance
of prevailing on appeal. This is especially important given this Court’s rules concerning the size
of Appellant’s Brief. Fourth, I have not been able to meet with my client as she was prematurely
transferred to Tallahassee, Florida by the Federal Bureau of Prisons over this past weekend, a
