Re: Briefing Schedule Request; USA v. Ghislaine Maxwell, Case 22-1426

Dear Ms..O’ Hagan Wolfe,

l.am.appellate counsel, for Defendant=A ppellant-Ghislainc Maxwell. I ‘was not:trial counsel
for Ms. Maxwell. I filed an. Acknowledgement .and Noticé.of Appearance on. July'15, 2022. The
Clerk required that I file a-Form.B on that date, as. well, although I did not, at that time, have any
‘information concerning the transcripts..

Pursuant. to Local. Rule 31.2(a)(1)(A), the ready’ date for this case was July’ 15, 2022.
Accordingly, I have until July 29, 2022, to. file this. bricfing schedule request. Pursuant to Local.

to:file Appellant’s Bricfiiftthe:case:involves a voluminous record or-extreme hardship-would:result.

new. counsel. unfamiliar. with. the::case, I:must therefore scrutinize: the. entire record.:in. order to
provide my client with the most competent. and. effective representation on appeal. Second, the
record:is voluminous;in that.it involves at lcast.3,824:pages of transcript-including pretrial hearings,
voir dire, trial, sentence, and:post-conviction proceedings. In addition, the Docket Report consists
of 738 entries, including but not limited to dozens.of fully briefed. pretrial motions and:motions in
Jimine; comprising hundreds of pages of legal analysis on, important, issues. Third, I must conduct.
my:own rescarch in order to determine what-issucs,| believe provide:my client with the best chance
of prevailing on appeal. ‘This is cspecially important given this Court’s rules concerning the size
of Appellant’s. Bricf. Fourth, I have not been.able to meet with:my client.as she was prematurely
transferred, to Tallahassec, Florida by the Federal Bureau of Prisons over this past. weckend, ‘a.
