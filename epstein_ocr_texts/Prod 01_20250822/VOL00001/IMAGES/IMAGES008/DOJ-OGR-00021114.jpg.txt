inapplicable...
Id. at 817.

In Diehl, the Fifth Circuit has similarly interpreted § 3283. through a
categorical. lens. The defendant was convicted of producing child pornography
under 18 U.S.C. § 2251(a). To determine whether the defendant’s offenses were
“offense[s] involving the sexual...abuse of a child” under § 3283, the Court looked
not to the facts of the case but, rather, “the language of the relevant statutes.”
Diehl, 775 F.3d at 720. The Court expressly cited. Cou/entos and held that §
2251(a) was an “offense involving the sexual ... abuse of a child,” as the statute
“prohibits using or inducing children under the age of 18 to engage in sexually
‘explicit, conduct for the purpose of. creating a visual depiction.” Jd. (citing
Cotitentos, 651 F.3d at 816-17).

B. The District Court erred in.applying § 3283 retroactively

Even if the District Court were correct to afford § 3283 a case-specific rather
than categorical. construction (and it was not), it erred again when it held that the
for the life of the accuser—reached back: to attach to conduct occurring before its
enactment. Contrary to what the District Court held, the.2003 amendment was not

retroactive.
