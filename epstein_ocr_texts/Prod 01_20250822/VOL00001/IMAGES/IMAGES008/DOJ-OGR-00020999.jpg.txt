overturn any of the factual findings made by the jury’ —it means only that, “as a matter of law,
the jury found the same thing twice.” Ansaldi, 372 F.3d at 125. Or, in this case, three times.

II. The Court denies the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.

The Defendant argues there was insufficient evidence to support any of her five counts of
conviction, and, therefore, the Court should enter a judgment of acquittal as to all counts under
Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 29 provides, in relevant part, that
“Talfter the government closes its evidence or after the close of all the evidence, the court on the
defendant’s motion must enter a judgment of acquittal of any offense for which the evidence is
insufficient to sustain a conviction.” Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a); United States v. Pugh, 945 F.3d 9,
19 (2d Cir. 2019). “[T]he critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support
a criminal conviction must be . . . to determine whether the record evidence could reasonably
support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318
(1979). “The court must make that determination with the evidence against a particular
defendant, viewed in the light most favorable to the government, and with all reasonable
inferences resolved in favor of the government.” Pugh, 945 F.3d at 19 (cleaned up) (quoting
Eppolito, 543 F.3d at 45). Under this inquiry, “the relevant question is whether, after viewing
the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have
found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Jackson, 443 U.S. at 319
(citing Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S. 356, 362 (1972)); United States v. Zhong, 26 F Ath 536,
560 (2d Cir. 2022).

At the close of the Government’s case, the Defendant made her Rule 29 application “with
respect to every count in the $2 indictment,” but “confine[d] [her] comments to address
specifically Counts One and Two.” Trial Tr. at 2266. The Court denied the motion. /d. at 2274.
