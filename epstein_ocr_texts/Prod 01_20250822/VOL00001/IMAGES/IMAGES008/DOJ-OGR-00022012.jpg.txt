1 Are there any further applications?

2 MR. FIGGINS: Yes, your Honor. You said we dealt with
3 the issue with respect to the Investigator General's report.

4 This court has never addressed it at all. You never said

5 anything with respect to that. So I just want to make that

6 clear. Do I need to file a motion with respect to that?

7 THE COURT: You may file a formal motion.

8 MR. FIGGINS: Thank you.

9 THE COURT: Anything further?

10 MR. FIGGINS: Your Honor, can I have an additional two
11 weeks? Can we push the motion schedule back at least an

12 additional two weeks? Because I have my 80-something-year-old
13 relative coming to visit me from February 23 through March 1,
14 so I kind of won't be working during that time. So if you

15 could just make it like -- if you could make it something

16 around like the 18th or the 21st.

17 THE COURT: All right, then. You can file your motion
18 by March 20.

19 How long does the prosecution need to oppose?
20 MS. LONERGAN: Your Honor, three weeks, please.
21 THE COURT: So the prosecution will file opposition on
22 April 10, and the reply will be April 24.
23 Is there anything further?
24 MS. LONERGAN: Yes, your Honor, at this time the
25 government moves to exclude time between now and the trial
