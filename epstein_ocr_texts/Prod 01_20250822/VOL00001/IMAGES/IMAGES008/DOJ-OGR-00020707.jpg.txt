submit this letter regarding the logistics for public access for closing arguments. The

not contain sealed materials) following the conclusion of the trial day on the same basis

presentations with narrowly tailored redactions (e.g., redactions to protect the anonymity
of witnesses the Court has permitted to testify under pseudonyms) shall be made
available to the public within two hours of the completion of closing arguments. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/19/2021)Gw) (Entered:
