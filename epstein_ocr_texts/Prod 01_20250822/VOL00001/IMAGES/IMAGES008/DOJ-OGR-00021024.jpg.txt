not entitled to the inference that all absent evidence would have been both favorable and material
to her case. United States v. Berry, No. 20-CR-84 (AJN), 2021 WL 2665585, at *2 (S.D.N.Y.
June 29, 2021).

Third, the Defendant must show that the prejudicial loss of evidence was caused by the
pre-indictment delay. That is, the Defendant must show that the evidence was at one point
available but that at trial “the lost testimony or information was not available through other
means.” Pierre-Louis, 2018 WL 4043140, at *4 (quoting United States v. Sprouts, 282 F.3d
1037, 1041 (8th Cir. 2002)). Here, the Defendant has made only a “bare allegation that [certain]
records have been lost or destroyed,” but without explaining when or why they were lost. United
States v. Dornau, 356 F. Supp. 1091, 1094 (S.D.N.Y. 1973). Further, the Defendant does not
explain whether any attempt was made to acquire these records either directly or by other means.
It is unexplained, for example, why the Defendant believes that government property records that
at one point existed are no longer available. Or why the Defendant could not have proven
Epstein’s residency by any alternative means. Similarly, the Defendant does not explain why the
flight manifests that pilot Larry Visoski delivered to Epstein’s office in New York have been
lost. See Trial Tr. at 172. In short, the Defendant fails to show that the absence of documentary
evidence was causally related to any decision by the Government to delay the Indictment.

For similar reasons, the Defendant fails to demonstrate prejudice by reference to the
deceased potential witnesses. Hirst, “[c]ourts have generally found that vague assertions that a
deceased witness might have provided favorable testimony do not justify dismissing an
indictment for delay.” Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 317; see, e.g., United States v. Lovasco, 431
U.S. 783, 785-86, 788-90 (1977) (reversing dismissal for pre-indictment delay where a material
defense witness had died); United States v. Snyder, 668 F.2d 686, 689 (2d Cir. 1982) (two
