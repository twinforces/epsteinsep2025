‘toher case. United States-v. Berry,'No. 20-GR-84 (AJN),.2021 WL.2665585, at'*2 (S.D-N-Y.
June 29, 2021).

Third, the Defendant'must show’that the:prejudicial loss of evidence: was.caused by the
‘:pre-indictment delay. ‘That is, the Deféndant-must show'that the:evidence was at:one point
available but that at trial “the lost testimony:orinformation, was:not available through other
means.” Pierre-Louis, 20.18 WL 4043 140, at *4 (quoting United States v. Sprouts, 282 F.3d
1037, 1041, (8th. Cir. 2002)). Here,:the Defendant’has:made only a.“bare allegation. that; [certain]
records ‘have'beenlost or destroyed,” but without:explaining when or why.'they.were lost. United.
States v..Dornau, 356 F.. Supp. 1091, 1094. (S-D.N.Y. 1.973). Eurther,the Defendant does not
explain-whether anyiattempt was made to acquire these records either directly or by other. means.
‘Tt isunexplained, for example,’why the Defendant believes:that government ‘property records that
at one: point.existed are no longer. available. ‘Or why the Defendant could nothave proven
‘Epstein *s residency by any-alternative means. Similarly; the Defendant doesnot explain why ‘the
flight manifésts that pilot! Larry’Misoski dclivered.to Epstein’ s.ioffice in’New York'have’been
‘lost. See Trial-Tr.at ‘1.72. In.short, the Defendant fails to show that the absence of documentary
evidence was causally related:to any: decision by the Government to delay. the.Indictment.

For similar‘reasons, the:Defendantfails to demonstrate prejudice: by ‘reference: tothe
deceased potential witnesses. /inst, “[c]ourts have generally:found that vague: assertions that a
deceased witness ‘might have provided -favorable testimony donot justify dismissing:an
‘indictment for. delay.” Maxwell, 534 F. Supp. 3d at 3.17; see,, C28. United.States v:.Lovasco, 43.1.
