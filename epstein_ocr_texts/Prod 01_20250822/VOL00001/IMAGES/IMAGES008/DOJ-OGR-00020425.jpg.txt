05/14/2021 | 281 | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell (1) on 280 JOINT LETTER
MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison
Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated May 14, 2021. ENDORSEMENT:
The request for an extension of time until May 21, 2021 to respond to the Court's May
11, 2021 Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
5/14/2021) (nl) (Entered: 05/14/2021)

05/14/2021 | 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2021, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell
wrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with
particular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other
factual showing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every 15
minutes at night. Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance
in Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to
prepare for and withstand trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the
Government to confer with legal counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to
certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response, the Government states that MDC staff
conduct flashlight checks of all inmates as a matter of course. Dkt. No. 270. As
reported by the Government, inmates housed with cell mates in the Special Housing
Unit are checked with flashlights every 30 minutes. Inmates housed with others in the
general population are checked multiple times per night at regular intervals. The
Government further reports that to conduct the checks, flashlights are pointed at the
ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present, breathing, and not in distress.
As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral reasons why BOP's
flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those of other inmates,
including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and the potential
stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has determined that
these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government
also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable policy, but
that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover her
eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2021 letter asks the Court to override
BOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check
procedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.
Certainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere
with Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers.
Defense counsel's May 7, 2021 letter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances
but makes no additional specific and supported application for relief. Nevertheless, the
Court urges the MDC to consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial detainees can be
reduced. The Court also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continue to
ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security protocols that BOP determines
are necessary for her safety and security, based upon neutral and applicable factors,
and consistent with the treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The
Government shall provide a copy of this Order to the Warden and General Counsel for
the MDC. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/14/2021) (nl)

AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated

Document filed by USA. (Rohrbach, Andrew) (Entered: 05/14/2021)

05/17/2021 | 284 | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell re: 278 Letter Proposed
Redactions to Defendant's Supplemental Pre-Trial Motions... ENDORSEMENT: The
Court grants in part the Government's redaction and sealing requests. Its conclusion is
guided by the three—part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid
Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Court concludes that these are
judicial documents and that the First Amendment and common law presumptions of
access attach. Id. at 11920. In balancing competing considerations against the
presumption of access, the Court finds that the arguments the Government has put
forward in this letter, including the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties
and alleged victims, favor the narrowly tailored redactions. See United States v.
