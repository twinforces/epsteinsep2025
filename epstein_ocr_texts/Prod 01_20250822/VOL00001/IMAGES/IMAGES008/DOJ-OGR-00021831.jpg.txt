provisions against the government, which drafted the agreement and enjoys
unequal bargaining power in the sentencing process.”’).

The Court should overrule Annabi because it is an outlier and incompatible
with “fairness in securing agreement between an accused and a prosecutor.” See
Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 261 (1971). Alternatively, the Court should
limit Annabi as follows: Annabi should not apply (1) to plea agreements from other
circuits that do not have such a rule; (2) to offenses based on the same conduct that
was the subject of a non-prosecution or plea agreement; (3) where there are
“affirmative indications” that the defendant reasonably understood the agreement
to bind other districts; and (4) without discovery and an evidentiary hearing. Here,
Annabi was applied to a plea that was negotiated and executed in the Eleventh
Circuit (a circuit that does not follow Annabi); to an offense based on the same
conduct that the “United States” had agreed not to prosecute; despite affirmative
appearances of intent to bind other districts; and without discovery and a hearing.
