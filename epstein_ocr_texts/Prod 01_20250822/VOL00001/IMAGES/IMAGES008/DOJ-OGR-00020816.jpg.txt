Ill. Counts five and. six.are not time-barred

For:most non-capital. offenses, the:statute:of limitations under federal law is five years.

18. U.S.C. § 3282(a). Congress has enacted longer’ limitations periods for certain crimes, in
‘particularfor “offense[s] involving the sexual or physical abuse, or kidnapping” of a minor‘in. 18
U.S.C. $3283. Prior’'to 2003, the: limitations period in.§ 3283 lasted until:the victim-reached,the.
age of 25) and then Congress extended the limitations-period to thelife of the-victim. with the
‘PROTECT Actof.2003,-Pub. L. No. 108-21, 1.17 Stat 60. In.2006, Congress enacted. 18 U.S.C.
§ 3299, which eliminated the statuteof: limitations for, the sex trafficking of minors in violation,
any other. law, an.indictment may be found-or:an information instituted-at anytime without;
‘limitation for. any offense under’... . section 1591.”).

‘Incher previous motion,: Maxwell argued that‘the Mann Act charges against’her‘in the
indictment were time-barred on the grounds: thatthe extended_limitations period §. 3283 -was-not
applicable. The Court denied that:motion inits April. 16, 2021 Opinion.& Order. Maxwell, 202 I.
"WL.15 1.8675, at *5. ‘Maxwell now argues that the new charges the Government has brought
against her.in the S2 indictment, Sex. Trafficking Conspiracy (18 'U.S:C. § 371) and Sex
Trafficking, (18 U.S.C. § 159.1), are time-barred as well because § 3283 does not apply’to those
offenses either. She renews her. contention from her previous:motion that the limitations period.
‘in-§ 3283 only applies to offenses which “necessarily entail” the:sexual abuse:of. a:minor and
argues thatia violation. of 18 U.S.C. § 1591 ‘does not. Thus, according to Maxwell's reasoning,
the general five-year'statute of limitations period in.18°U.S.C. § 3282(a) applies'to the sex.
trafficking, counts and, because the alleged conduct occurred from,200] to 2004, the Government

‘Is now: time-barred :for prosecuting her for these:offenses..
