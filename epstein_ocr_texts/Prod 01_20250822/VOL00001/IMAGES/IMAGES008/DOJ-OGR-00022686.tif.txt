7 you mean he regularly told you that? Like he -- 7 that the rest was not true.

8 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: When I first -- 8 TODD BLANCHE: Let me ask you a question

9 because when I didn't have sex with him after the 29 about the age of the masseuses over the years. It --
10 first time, and it took -- so I asked him, was it me? 10 [think in my mind, there's a difference between you

12 And I had never, up until this moment in 12 age of 18 and coming to give a massage, and you
13 my life, I -- as if I'm not stupid. I'm very bright. 13 knowing that Mr. Epstein, you know, sexually abused
14 ‘|'ve had an excellent education. I traveled all over 14 the underage person or made her strip or something
15 the world. I had had boyfriends, but I had never met 15 like that, meaning -- and I want to understand
16 — or understood that somebody could be so -- would lie 16 whether you believe that nobody that came to give
17 — to me about -- I could -- it never occurred to me. 17 massages, none of the women were under 18 or that you
18 I didn't have a frame of context within my 18 didn't focus on their age, but you -- you were more

3 contact, at that point -- at that point, did you 3 mterviewed 44 women, let's say, or around that

4 accept that that was true? Meaning, did it make 4 number.

5 sense at that point? 5 TODD BLANCHE: Uh-huh.

6 When you were reading about women who 6 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: You have to

7 claimed that they had been abused, even underage 7 understand, not a single one of those 44 women

8 and -- at that point, did you think to yourself, 8 mentioned me ina single report. And it's not

10 = itor no? 10 They didn't mention me in their report
11 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: First of all, I 11 because they never met me, they never saw me, and
