case, not just: because the ‘CVRA. requires. it, but because it’s the right thing to do.” During oral
argument on January 16, 2020, the.government apologized.for the USAO’s treatment of Wild:

‘Ms. Wild.about what itis that was going on with respect'to the NPA,
and they made a mistake in causing her:to belicve ‘that-the case was
ongoing;when. in fact the NPA:‘had ‘been. signed.. The government.
should have communicated:in a:straightforward and transparentavay.
with Ms. Wild, and for. that, we are: genuinely sorry.*” 3

On. April 14, 2020, ‘adivided pancl-of the: Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied.
Wild’s petition for a. writ. of mandamus, concluding: that “the GVRA ‘does not apply ‘before: the:
commencement of criminal proceedings—and thus, -on the facts of this case, docs ‘not provide the
petitioner here with any judicially. enforceablerights."*"? The court conducted.a thorough analysis;
of the language of the statute, the legislative history, and previous court decisions. The: court:
distinguished Jn re Dean.as “dictum” consisting of a““three-sentence discussion... . devoid of any:
analysis of the CVRA’s text, history, or structural underpinnings.” The court: noted. that; its
‘interpretation of the GVRA-was consistent with the Department's 2010 OLC opinion. concerning,
wietim standing under the:CVRA and the Departinent’s efforts in “implementing regulations.”
Finally, the court. raised separation. of powers concerns: with. Wild’s: (and. the dissenting judge? Ss)
interpretation, of Victim standing Under ‘the CVRA, noting that stich an, interpretation, would,
interfere with:prosecutorial discretion.

case, stating that the government * ‘[s s]eemingly . . defer[red] to ‘Epstein’! S lawyers” regarding
information. it pr ovided Victims about the NPA and that its “efforts Secin.to have graduated. from.
passive nondisclosure to (or at least.close:to) active misrepresentation.” The court concluded that
although.it“sceins obvious” thatthe government-“should have consulted with petitioner-(andother
victims) before: negotiating: and. executing Epstein’s NPA,” the court .could. not conclude that the:
government was obligated to do so. In addition, the: dissenting judge filed a lengthy and strongly
worded. opinion, asserting ‘that. the majority” ‘Ss statutory interpretation. was “contorted” because the

“plain. and ‘unambiguous text of the. CVRA does not. include [a] post-indictment temporal.
restriction,”

On May’5, 2020, Wild. filed.a pétition for rehearing én banc. ‘On Atigst!7, 2020, the court:
granted. the petition. for. rehearing en bane. and vacated the pancl’s. opinion; as of the date of: this
Report, a briefing schedule has been.issued and oral argument is set for December 3, 2020.
