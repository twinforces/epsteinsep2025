Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page71 of 113.

Although the District Court was correct’ to recognize that Congress deleted.
District’ Court relied on.a floor statement by Senator Leahy, in which the Senator
offered his own reasons for opposing the retroactivity clause:

I am pleased that the conference agreed to. drop language from, the

original House-passed. bill that would. have extended. the limitations

period retroactively. That language, which, would have revived the
government’s authority to prosecute crimes that were previously time-
barred, 1s.of doubtful constitutionality.
149 Cong. Rec. S5147. Based on this, the District Court theorized that Congress
wanted only to ensure that the extended statute of limitations would not
unconstitutionally revive time-barred. claims. See Stogner v. California, 539 U.S.

But Stogner is an unilluminating Jens through which to analyze Sen. .Leahy’s
remark, as that case was not. decided until after the PROTECT Act was passed.
And though Siogner established, for Ex Post. Facto Clause ptirposes, a clear
division between, statutes that revive time-barred prosecutions and ‘those that
merely extend the, time to bring prosecutions not time-barred, this dichotomy
would not. have been apparent to Congress before Siogner. Indeed, the: Stogner
majority’ felt it; necessary: to clarify that its holding did “not prevent the State from.

extending time: Jimits...for prosecutions not yet time barred,” 539 U.S. at 632,

while the dissent contended that this: dichotomy was untenable, see id. at 650
