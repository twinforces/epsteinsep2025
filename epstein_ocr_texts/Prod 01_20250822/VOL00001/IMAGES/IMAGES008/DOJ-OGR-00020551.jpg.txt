11/19/2021 | 476 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Government's
supplemental letter regarding Government Exhibit 52, Dkt. No. 457, and the
Defendants response, which has been temporarily filed under seal to allow the parties
the opportunity to request limited redactions. The Government is hereby ORDERED
to file a reply to Defendants response on or before 12:00 p.m. on November 21, 2021.
The letter reply should address the Defendants argument that Employee—1 cannot
authenticate Government Exhibit 52 because Mr. Rodriguez, a former employee,
purportedly removed the document from the property before Employee—1 began
working for Mr. Epstein. The parties are FURTHER ORDERED to file any proposed
redactions to the motion papers on the public docket on or before November 22, 2021,
justifying any requested redactions by reference to the three—part test articulated by the
Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006)
(Government Replies due by 11/21/2021.). (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

11/19/2021 | 477 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On October 29, 2021, Defendant filed a motion in
limine to exclude evidence related to Accuser—3. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court twice
heard argument related to this motion, including extensive argument at the November
10, 2021 in camera hearing that was sealed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 412.
See generally Nov. 1, 2021 Transcript; Nov. 10, 2021 Transcript. The Court has also
considered supplemental briefing from the parties. That briefing has been filed
temporarily under seal to permit the parties the opportunity to propose redactions in
accordance with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).
In a Memorandum Opinion & Order filed under temporary seal, the Court GRANTS in
part and DENIES in part the Defendant's motion. The Memorandum Opinion & Order
lays out the permissible and impermissible testimony that may be offered by this
witness based on Rules 412, 404, 401, and 403. The Court will send the temporarily
sealed Memorandum Opinion & Order to the parties. By November 21, 2021, the
parties are ORDERED to inform the Court whether either seeks sealing or limited
redactions of the Courts Memorandum Opinion & Order and of the supplemental
briefing, justifying any such request by reference to Federal Rule of Evidence
412(c)(2) and/or the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). (Signed by Judge Alison J.

11/19/2021 | 478 | LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from
AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated
November 19, 2021 re: Courtroom Connect Document filed by USA. (Comey,
Maurene) (Entered: 11/19/2021)

11/19/2021 | 690 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Before the Court is
the Defendant's fourth motion in limine to "exclude evidence related to Accuser—3," to
whom the Court refers as Witness—3, on the grounds that the testimony is not direct
evidence of the charged conspiracies and is inadmissible under Federal Rules of
Evidence 404(b) and 403. Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court has twice heard argument
related to this motion, including argument at the November 10, 2021 in camera hearing
that was sealed pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 412. See generally Nov. 1, 2021
Transcript; Nov. 10, 2021 Transcript. At the November 1, 2021 hearing, the Court
provided a brief explanation of its current position based on the information then
before it, but the Court ultimately reserved ruling pending additional briefing. The
Court is now in receipt of the parties’ additional briefing and accordingly is prepared to
resolve the motion.(See Footnote 1 on this Memorandum Opinion & Order). The
Government now proffers that the anticipated testimony of Witness—3 will describe
how she met the Defendant and her relationship with the Defendant and Mr. Epstein.
In particular, Witness—3 is anticipated to testify how Defendant introduced her to Mr.
Epstein, how massages progressed to involve sexual activity, and Ms. Maxwell's role
in facilitating those massages. Based on all of the information now before the Court,
including a substantially more detailed proffer by the Government as to the anticipated
testimony, see Gov. Supp. Ltr. at 2-3 (Nov. 5, 2021); see also Dkt. No. 452 at 42-43,
the Court concludes that some of the anticipated testimony may serve as direct
evidence of the Mann Act counts....[*** See this Memorandum Opinion & Order
***]. The parties may submit any requested edits to the proposed limiting instructions
