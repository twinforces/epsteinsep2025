2/22/23, 1:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version 1.6
Memorandum Opinion & Order ***]... Last, the Court emphasizes that while it currently
denies the Defense's motion, the Defense may of course raise, and the Court will
consider, objections that particular lines of questioning into witnesses’ backgrounds or
lives are irrelevant, cumulative, intended to harass, or otherwise inappropriate. See, e.g.,
Smith v. Illinois, 390 U.S. 129, 133 (1968) (emphasizing that even when anonymity is not
warranted, the court has a duty to protect a witness "from questions which go beyond the
bounds of proper cross-examination merely to harass, annoy or humiliate him"). SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/15/2021)(bw) (Entered:

12/16/2021 551 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court is in receipt of the parties’ joint letter
regarding the admission of prior inconsistent statements. The parties' letter notes "that
many of these statements raise one of two questions: (1) must counsel show the witness
the prior inconsistent statement under Rule 613(b), and (2) is a statement admissible
when the witness affirms that the 3500 material contains the inconsistent statement and
also expresses disagreement with the substance." The parties are hereby ORDERED to
submit a letter citing authority (beyond the rule itself) for their respective positions. The
parties are FURTHER ORDERED to indicate each disputed prior inconsistent statement
that was read into the record. Letters must be submitted as soon as possible but no later
than today, December 16, 2021, at 10:15 p.m. The parties are FURTHER ORDERED to
docket their respective letters by tomorrow, December 17, 2021, at 8:00 a.m. (Signed by
Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/16/2021) (ap) Modified on 12/17/2021 (ap). (Entered:
