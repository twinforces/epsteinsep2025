“I’m reconstructing:memories of... . 12 years ago.. I'can speculate that at some point, the matter
eame-up, and Lor’someéone élse said..... whatswould the otiginal charges'have likely brought? And
someone said this amount.” Acosta told OPR. that: he could not recall. who initially proposed this
inethod, ‘but. he. beligved that it-likely did not result from a, single specific. discussion but. rather
‘from. conversations over. a course of.time. Acosta could-not recall specifically: with whom he: had.
these discussions, other than-that itivould have been Lourie, Menchel, or Sloman. Villafana was
not asked. for. her. views on.a. two-year sentence, and she: had. no input into the: decision. before: it.
was made. Villafana-told OPR that she examined the’ state statutes and could. not-validate ‘that a.
state charge would. have ‘resulted ‘in, a 24-month. sentence. OPR. also examined applicable state.
statutes and the Florida sentencing: guidelines, but could not confirm that, Epstein, was, in fact,
facing. a potential two-year sentence'under charges contemplated by the PBPD.

On the other hand, during: his OPR. interview, Lourie “guess[ed]” ‘that: “somehow the
defense conveyed « . We're © going to trial if iv s more ° than two years.” _Menchel similar ‘ly: told
that the: office felt was palatable enough that [Epstein] » would take": lt. ‘Sloman told OPR that he:
had no idea how. the two-year sentence proposal was reached.

The: ‘contemporancous documentary record, however, pr ovides no indication.that Epstein’s
teain proposed a two-year'sentence of incatceration or initially, suggested, ‘before'the USAO made
‘its offer, that. Epstein would accept a two-year term of incarceration. As late: as July 25, 2007—
only days before the USAO: provided. the term sheetito defense counsel—Epstein’s cotinsel.
submitted a letter to the: USAO arguing that the federal.government should not prosecute Epstein.
at\all, Furtherinore; after the initial “term sheet” was presented and, negotiations for the NPA

‘The USAO had other charging and sentencing options available to it. The most obvious
alternative to the two-year sentence proposal ‘was to offer Epstein a plea to a federal offense that.
cartied a harsher sentence. If federally charged, Epstein was: facing a substantial. sentence under:
the federal. sentencing: guidelines, 168 to 210. months” imprisonment. However, it is unlikely that
he would have agreed to a pleathat required a gtidelines sentence, even. one at the lower end of
the: guidelines. Menchel told OPR ‘that he and his'colleagues: had been concerned that. Epstein
would opti to go to trial if charged. and -preseiited with the option. of pleading to a guidelines
sentence, and.as previously discussed, there were both -cyidentiary and legal risks ‘attendant upon
a trial in this ‘case. If'federally charged, Epstein’s sentencing exposure could have been managed.
by offering him. a plea under’ Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure |1(c) fora stipulated sentence,
which. requires judicial approval. Acosta:rejected ‘this idea, however, apparently ‘because of a
perception that.the federal district-courts in’ the Southern, District of Florida.didnot-view Rule 11 (c)
pleas favorably and might refuse to accept such a plea and.thus limitthe USAO’s options.

Another alternative was to offer‘Epstein a plea to conspiracy, ‘a federal. charge that carried.
a imaxinium five-year Sentence: Shortly after Villafana circulated ‘the prosectition memorandum
to her supervisors, Lourie: recommended. to Acosta charging Epstein, by criminal. complaint. and
offering a plea to conspiracy. “to make a plea attractive.” Similarly, before learning that Menchel.
had ‘already discussed a state-based. resolution with Epstein’s counsel, Villafana had considered
offering Epstein a plea to one count. of’ conspiracy. and, a substantive :charge, to be served
concurrently’with any sentence he might. receive scparately as a. result of the state’s outstanding:
