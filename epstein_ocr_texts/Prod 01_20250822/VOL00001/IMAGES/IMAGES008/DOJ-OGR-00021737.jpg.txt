On that point, Judge Nathan found that Maxwell
led Sarah Kellen. Two witnesses, both pilots for Ep-
stein, testified that Kellen was Maxwell’s assistant.
(A.417; see Tr.139-40, 1890). Judge Nathan found that
testimony credible, in part because it was corroborated
by other testimony that Maxwell was Epstein’s “num-
ber two and the lady of the house” in Palm Beach
where much of the abuse occurred and where Kellen
worked. (A.417). The trial evidence showed that Kellen
scheduled sexualized massages and took nude photo-
graphs of Carolyn. (PSR 4 66; Tr.1554-55). Even after
Kellen took over some of Maxwell’s duties, Maxwell
continued to manage her by virtue of her position in
the house, a fact corroborated by a household manual
directing staff to tend to the specific needs of Epstein,
Maxwell, and their guests, as well as flight records
showing that Maxwell and Kellen flew together on Ep-
stein’s planes dozens of times. (A.417). The clear infer-
ence from this record is that Maxwell instructed Kel-
len regarding how to schedule massages and run the
part of the scheme that Maxwell had previously han-
dled, at which point Kellen switched to making calls to
schedule appointments following Maxwell’s directions.
Maxwell argues that Judge Nathan erred because a
defense witness testified that she, rather than Kellen,
was Maxwell’s assistant. (Br.85). That uncorroborated
testimony is not enough to render Judge Nathan’s
finding clearly erroneous. Moreover, what matters is
whether Maxwell exercised supervisory authority over
Kellen, not whether Kellen or another individual was
formally Maxwell’s assistant.

Maxwell also argues that when imposing the 240-
month sentence, which was above the Guidelines
