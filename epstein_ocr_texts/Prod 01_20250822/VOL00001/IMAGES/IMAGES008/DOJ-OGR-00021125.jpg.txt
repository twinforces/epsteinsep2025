Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page78 of 113
POINT III
DEFENDANT WAS DENIED HER CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A
FAIR AND IMPARTIAL JURY BECAUSE A JUROR MADE FALSE
STATEMENTS IN VOIR DIRE AS TO MATERIAL FACTS THAT, IF
KNOWN, WOULD HAVE PROVIDED A VALID BASIS TO REMOVE
HIM FOR CAUSE. U.S. Const. amend. VI.
A. Introduction

After the trial concluded, a juror gave multiple interviews in which he
disclosed that he actively used his own self-described traumatic experience as a
victim of child sexual abuse to convince certain members of the jury to overlook
issues of credibility surrounding the victims and to convict Maxwell. Defendant
moved for a new trial, contending that the juror’s presence on the jury violated her
Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury. Dkt 613, 642. The court ordered an
evidentiary hearing limited to questions concerning Juror 50’s false statements on
the juror questionnaire. A239.

At the hearing, Juror 50 gave a patently absurd explanation for his failure to
give truthful answers to multiple questions on the juror questionnaire.
Nevertheless, the court found that Juror 50 testified credibly at the hearing and that
Juror 50 would not have been stricken for cause even if he had answered each
question on the questionnaire accurately. Accordingly, the court concluded that
Defendant failed to satisfy the demanding requirements of the controlling Supreme
