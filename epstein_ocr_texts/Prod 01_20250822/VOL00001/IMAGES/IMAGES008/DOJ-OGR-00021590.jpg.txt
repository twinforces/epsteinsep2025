1 two if a participant unduly influenced a minor to engage ina
2 commercial sex act. In defining the enhancement, the
3 Commission instructs courts to closely consider the facts of
4 the case to determine whether a participant's influence over
5 the minor compromised the voluntariness of the minor's
6 behavior. 2Gl.1, comment note 7. And if the participant is at
7 least ten years older than the minor, there is a rebuttable
8 presumption that the participant unduly influenced the minor to
9 engage in a commercial sex act. I overrule the defendant's
10 objection.
11 The defendant first says the undue influence
12 enhancement would punish her for the same harm already counted
13 in her base offense level. Impermissible double counting
14 occurs when a guideline enhancement is applied to reflect the
15 kind of harm that's already fully accounted for elsewhere in
16 the Guidelines but does not occur if the enhancement aims at
17 differing harms emanating from the same conduct or reflects
18 different facets of the defendant's conduct. United States v.
19 Watkins, 667 F.3d 254 (2d Cir. 2012). There isn't double
20 counting here. The 2Gl1.1(a) base offense level reflects the
a1 aggregating factor that the victim of the defendant's sex
22 offense was a minor. The enhancement, by contrast, reflects
23 the use of undue influence to engage in a commercial sex act.
24 I'll cite a few cases that stand for that proposition,
25 including United States v. Kohlmeier, 858 F. App'x, 444 (2d
