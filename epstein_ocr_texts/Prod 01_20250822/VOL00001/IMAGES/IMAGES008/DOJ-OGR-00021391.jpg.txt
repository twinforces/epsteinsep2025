Bill of Rights in the VRRA.?° Following multiple Senate Judiciary Committee subcommittee
hearings and various revisions of the proposed amendment, the Senators determined that such an
amendment was unlikely to be approved and, instead, they presented the CVRA as a compromise
measure.”
B. Enumerated Rights
The CVRA defines the term “crime victim” as ‘“‘a person directly and proximately harmed
as a result of the commission of a Federal offense or an offense in the District of Columbia.”
Initially, and at the time relevant to the federal Epstein investigation, the CVRA afforded crime
victims the following eight rights:
(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused.
(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public
court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the crime or
of any release or escape of the accused.
(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court
proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing
evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be
materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that
proceeding.
(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the
district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole
proceeding.
(5) The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the
Government in the case.
265 See 150 Cong. Rec. $4260-01 at 1, 5 (2004). The VRRA identified victims’ rights to (1) be treated with
fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity and privacy; (2) be reasonably protected from the accused offender;
(3) be notified of court proceedings; (4) be present at all public court proceedings that relate to the offense, unless the
court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially affected if the victim heard other testimony at trial;
(5) confer with an attorney for the Government in the case; (6) restitution; and (7) information about the conviction,
sentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender. 42 U.S.C. § 10606(b) (1990). The relevant text of the VRRA
is set forth in Chapter Three, Part Two, Section 1.B of this Report.
264 150 Cong. Rec. $4260-01 at 1, 5 (2004). Although nine congressional hearings were held between 1996 and
2003 concerning amending the Constitution to address victims’ rights, neither chamber of Congress voted on
legislation proposing an amendment. United States Government Accountability Office (GAO), GAO-09-54, Report
