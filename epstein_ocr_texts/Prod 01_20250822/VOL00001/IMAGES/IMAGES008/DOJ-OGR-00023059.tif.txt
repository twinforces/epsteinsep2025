On July 24, 2006, Villafafia alerted Sloman, who informed Acosta, that the State Attorney’s
Office had charged and arrested Epstein.*® On that same day, the FBI in West Palm Beach formally
opened the case, assigning the case agent and, later, a co-case agent, to investigate it. Villafafia
told Sloman that the FBI agents “are getting copies of all of the evidence and we are going to
review everything at [the] FBI on Wednesday,” and she noted that her target date for filing federal
charges against Epstein was August 25, 2006. Acosta emailed Sloman, asking whether it was
“appropriate to approach [State Attorney Krischer] and give him a heads up re where we might
go?” Sloman replied, “No for fear that it will be leaked straight to Epstein.””°

Although Lourie learned of the case at this point from Sloman, and eventually took a more
active role in supervising the investigation, Villafafia continued to update Acosta and Sloman
directly on the progress of the case.*° Villafafia’s immediate supervisor in West Palm Beach had
little involvement in supervising the Epstein investigation, and at times, Villafafia directed her
emails to Sloman, Menchel, and Lourie without copying her immediate supervisor. In the
immediate supervisor’s view, however, “Miami” purposefully assumed all the “authority” for the
case, which the immediate supervisor regarded as “highly unusual.”*!

By late August 2006, Villafafia and the FBI had identified several additional victims and
obtained “some flight manifests, telephone messages, and cell phone records that show the
communication and travel in interstate commerce” by Epstein and his associates. Villafafia
reported to her supervisors that the State Attorney’s Office would not provide transcripts from the
state grand jury voluntarily, and that she would be meeting with Chief Reiter “to convince him to
relinquish the evidence to the FBI.” Villafafia also told her supervisors that she expected “a
number of fights” over her document demands, and that some parties were refusing to comply
“after having contact with Epstein or his attorneys.”

Villafafia’s reference to anticipated “fights” and lack of compliance led Sloman to ask
whether she was referring to the victims. Villafafia responded that the problems did not involve
victims, but rather a former employee of Epstein and some business entities that had objected to
document demands as overly burdensome. Villafafia explained to Sloman and Lourie that some
victims were “scared and/or embarrassed,” and some had been intimidated by the defense, but
“everyone [with] whom the agents have spoken so far has been willing to tell her story.” Villafafia
28 On the same day, Sloman emailed Lourie, whom Villafafia had not yet briefed about the case, noting that
Operation Leap Year was “a highly sensitive case involving some Palm Beach rich guy.”

29 During his OPR interview, Sloman did not recall what he meant by this remark, but speculated that it was
likely that “we didn’t trust the Palm Beach State Attorney’s Office,” and that he believed there may have been “some
type of relationship between somebody in the [State Attorney’s Office] and the defense team.”
30 After Villafafia sent a lengthy substantive email about the case to her immediate supervisor, Lourie, Sloman,
and Acosta on August 23, 2006, Lourie emailed Sloman: “Do you and Alex [Acosta] want her updating you on the
case?” Sloman responded, “At this point, I don’t really care. If Alex says something then I’ll tell her to just run it
through you guys.”
31 OPR understood “Miami” to be a reference to the senior managers who were located in the Miami office,
that is, Acosta, Sloman, and Menchel. Records show, and Villafafia told OPR, that she believed Epstein’s attorneys
“made a conscious decision to skip” her immediate supervisor and directed their communications to the supervisory
chain above the immediate supervisor—Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta.
