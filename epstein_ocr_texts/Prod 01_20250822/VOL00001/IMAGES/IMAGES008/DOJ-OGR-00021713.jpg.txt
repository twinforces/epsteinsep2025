3. The Hearing

Following these reports, the Government filed a let-
ter highlighting Juror 50’s public statements and re-
questing that the District Court conduct a hearing.
(Dkt.568). After briefing, Judge Nathan ordered a lim-
ited hearing focused on Juror 50’s “potential failure to
respond truthfully to questions during the jury selec-

(A.240; SA350). Judge Nathan denied Maxwell’s re-
quest to directly question Juror 50, which was “com-

parties to propose questions in advance of the hearing.
(SA364 (quoting United States v. Moten, 582 F.2d 654,
667 (2d Cir. 1978)). The parties did so—and Maxwell
submitted a letter renewing her request to question
Juror 50 directly and proposing twenty-one pages of
questions on topics including the nature and length of
Juror 50’s sexual abuse, the nature of the sexual abuse
experienced by any of Juror 50’s family or friends, his
own employment responsibilities, the impact of his
sexual abuse on his life and personal relationships,
whether Juror 50 ever sought mental health counsel-
ing or spoke with a therapist, how he came to give me-
dia interviews, and whether he was attempting to be
viewed as a “champion of victims of sexual abuse.”
(Dkt.636).

The District Court held a hearing on March 8, 2022,
at which Juror 50 testified under a grant of immunity.
Juror 50 testified that his answers to three questions
were not accurate: Questions 25 (whether he or a close
associate had been a victim of a crime), 48 (whether he
or a friend or family member had been a victim of
