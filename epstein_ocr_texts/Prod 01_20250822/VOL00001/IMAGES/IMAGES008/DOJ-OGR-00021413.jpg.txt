she would inform victims of the terms of the resolution of the federal case, including Epstein’s
agreement to plead guilty to state charges and serve 18 months in county jail, and the victims’
ability to seek monetary damages against Epstein. The letter also would invite victims to appear
at the state court hearing and make a statement under oath or provide a written statement to be
filed by the State Attorney’s Office. Sloman and Villafafia exchanged edits on the draft victim
notification letter, and Villafafia also informed Sloman that “[t]here are a few girls who didn’t
receive the original letters, so I will need to modify the introductory portion of the letter for
those.”

Sloman informed Lefkowitz of the government’s need to meet its “statutory obligation
(Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the victims of the anticipated upcoming events and their
rights associated with the agreement” and his intent to “notify the victims by letter after COB
Thursday, November 29.” Lefkowitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that
it was “incendiary and inappropriate” and not warranted under the Justice for All Act of 2004. He
argued that the defense “should have a right to review and make objections to that submission
prior to it being sent to any alleged victims.” He also insisted that if any notification letters were
sent to “victims, who still have not been identified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein
has entered his plea” and that the letter should come from the attorney representative rather than
the government. On November 28, 2007, at Sloman’s instruction, Villafafia provided Lefkowitz
with the draft victim notification letter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was
to occur on December 14, 2007.7

In a November 29, 2007 letter to Acosta, Lefkowitz strongly objected to the proposed draft
notification letter, arguing that the government was not obligated to send any letter to victims until
after Epstein’s plea and sentencing. Lefkowitz also contended that the victims had no right to
appear at Epstein’s state plea hearing and sentencing or to provide a written statement for such a
proceeding. In a November 30, 2007 reply letter to Lefkowitz, Acosta did not address the
substance of Lefkowitz’s arguments, but accused the defense team of “in essence presenting
collateral challenges” delaying effectuation of the NPA, and asserted that if Epstein was
dissatisfied with the NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the Agreement” and proceed to trial. Shortly
thereafter, Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by letter that he had directed prosecutors “not to
issue victim notification letters until this Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you with time
to review these options with your client.” In the letter, Acosta also refuted defense allegations that
Villafafia had acted improperly by informing the victims of the potential for receiving monetary
damages, stating that “the victims were not told of the availability of Section 2255 relief during
the investigation phase of this matter.”

On December 5, 2007, Starr and Lefkowitz sent a letter to Acosta, with copies to Sloman
and Assistant Attorney General Fisher, “reaffirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with
ail On November 28, 2007, two months after the NPA was signed, the lead case agent informed Villafafia that
only 15 of the then-known victims had received victim notification letters from either the FBI or the USAO. On
December 6, 2007, the lead case agent reported to Villafafia that she was “still holding many of the original V/W
letters addressed to victims from the USAO.”
a3 Villafafia understood the state prosecutors had set the December 14, 2007 date, and emailed them for
confirmation, stating, “[I]f the matter is set for the 14th, please let me know so I can include that in my victim
notifications.”
