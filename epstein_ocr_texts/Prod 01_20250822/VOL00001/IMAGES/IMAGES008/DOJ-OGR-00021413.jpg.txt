ability to seck monetary damages: against Epstein. The letter:also would invite:victims to appear

notification létter, and ‘Villafana. also informed, Sloman that.“[t]here ate a. few girls who didn’t!
receive the original letters, so [will need. to modify ‘the introductory portion. of the: letter for
those.'*?!

Sloman informed Lefkowitz of the: government’s: need. to meet its:* ‘statutory. obligation
(Justice for All Act of 2004): to notify ‘the ‘victims. of the anticipated ' upcoming events and ‘their’
rights: associated ‘with the agreement” and ‘his intent. to “notify. the victims by letter after COB
Thur sday,. Noveinbet 29.” Lefkowitz objected to the proposal to notify the victims, asserting that:
it'was “incendiary and.inappropriate” and not warranted.under the Justice for. All-Act of 2004. He
argued that the defense, “should have a right to, review and. make. objections to that subiniission
prior to. it. being, sent to any alleged:victims.” ‘He-also insisted that if any notification letters were:
sent to “victims, who still. have not been ‘identified to us, it'should happen ‘only. after Mr: Epstein
has entered. his plea” and ‘that‘the letter should -come fronr the attorney representative rather than,
the: government. On November 28, .2007, at:Sloman’s: instruction, Villafaia provided. Lefkowitz:
with the draft, victim notification, letter, which would advise victims that the state court plea was
to. oceur on December 14,.2007.7!*

In‘a November'29, 2007 letter to Acosta, Lefkowitz strongly objected.to the proposed-draft.
notification letter, arguing thatthe, governinient was not obligated to send. any letter to’victims' until
after Epstcin’s plea: and sentencing. Lefkowitz, also contended. that the victims had ‘no right ‘to
appear at: Epstein’s state plea, hearing and sentencing or to provide a written statement -for such a
proceeding. In ‘a November 30, 2007 ‘reply letter to Lefkowitz, Acosta did. not. address the:
substance of Lefkowitz’s arguments, but accused the defense:'team of “in. essence presenting,
collateral challenges” delaying effectuation, of ‘the NPA, and asserted that: if Epstein, was
dissatisfied withthe: NPA, “we stand ready to unwind the:A greement” and:procced to:trial. Shortly
thereafter;.Acosta informed defense counsel Starr by letter'that:he had directed prosecutors: “not to
issue victim notification. letters until this: Friday [December 7] at 5 p.m., to provide you. with time:
to review'these-options with your client.” In’the letter; Acosta,also refuted defense allegations’ that,
Villafaia had acted.1 improper ly’ by informing the victims of the: potential for receiving : monctary
damages, stating that * “the victiins were, not told. éf'the availability of Section 2255 ‘clit’ ‘during,
the: investigation. phase: of this matter.”

On, December 5, 2007, Starr-and Lefkowitz sent a letter to Acosta, with copies ‘to: Sloman.
and Assistant.Attorney General Fisher, “reatfirm[ing]” the NPA, but taking “serious issue” with.
