12/09/2021 535 | MEMORANDUM OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Government
seeks to admit what has been identified as Government Exhibit 52 ("GX 52"), and submit
to the jury a redacted version of GX 52. The Defense objects to the admission of GX 52
on authentication and hearsay grounds. The admissibility of the exhibit has been the
subject of pretrial motion in limine briefing and extensive supplemental briefing. See
Dkt. Nos. 390, 397, 398, 457, 476, 490. This includes supplemental briefing received on
December 8, 2021, after the authenticating witness, Mr. Juan Alessi, underwent direct
examination by the Government and voir dire by the Defense. The Court reserved ruling
on the exhibit, pending what was anticipated to be additional testimony. Trial Tr. at 876.
The Court now overrules the Defenses objections. The parties are ORDERED to confer
and propose a limiting instruction consistent with this ruling on or before today,
December 9, 2021, at 7:00 p.m. The parties are FURTHER ORDERED to confer and
prepare a stipulation that Government Exhibits 52A, 52D, 52E, 52F, 52G, and 52H are
true and correct photocopies of five pages from GX 52. See Trial Tr. at 858. (Signed by
