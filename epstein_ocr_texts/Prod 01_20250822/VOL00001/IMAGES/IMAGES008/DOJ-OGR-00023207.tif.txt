investigation.7° Media reports in mid-2009 suggested Epstein was released from his state
incarceration “early” because he was assisting in a financial crimes investigation in the Eastern
District of New York involving Epstein’s former employer, Bear Stearns. At the time, Villafafia
was notified by the AUSAs handling the matter that they “had never heard of” Epstein and he was
providing “absolutely no cooperation” to the government. In 2011, Villafafia reported to senior
colleagues that “this is urban myth. The FBI and I looked into this and do not believe that any of
it is true.” Villafafia told OPR that the rumor that Epstein had cooperated with the case in New
York was “completely false.” Acosta told OPR that he did not have any information about Epstein
cooperating in a financial investigation or relating to media reports that Epstein had been an
“intelligence asset.”?4

In addition to the contemporaneous record attesting that Epstein was not a cooperating
witness in a federal matter, OPR found no evidence suggesting that Epstein was such a cooperating
witness or “intelligence asset,” or that anyone—including any of the subjects of OPR’s
investigation—believed that to be the case, or that Epstein was afforded any benefit on such a
basis. OPR did not find any reference to Epstein’s purported cooperation, or even a suggestion
that he had assisted in a different matter, in any of the numerous communications sent by defense
counsel to the USAO and the Department. It is highly unlikely that defense counsel would have
omitted any reason warranting leniency for Epstein if it had existed.

Accordingly, OPR concludes that none of the subjects of OPR’s investigation provided
Epstein with any benefits on the basis that he was a cooperating witness in an unrelated federal
investigation, and OPR found no evidence establishing that Epstein had received benefits for
cooperation in any matter.

V. ACOSTA EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT BY RESOLVING THE FEDERAL

INVESTIGATION THROUGH THE NPA

Although OPR finds that none of the subjects committed professional misconduct in this
matter, OPR concludes that Acosta exercised poor judgment when he agreed to end the federal
investigation through the NPA. Acosta’s flawed application of Petite policy principles to this case
and his concerns with overstepping the boundaries of federalism led to a decision to resolve the
federal investigation through an NPA that was too difficult to administer, leaving Epstein free to
manipulate the conditions of his sentence to his own advantage. The NPA relied on state
authorities to implement its key terms, leading to an absence of control by federal authorities over
the process. Although the prosecutors considered certain events that they addressed in the NPA,
such as gain time and community control, many other key issues were not, such as work release
and mechanisms for implementing the § 2255 provision. Important provisions, such as promising
not to prosecute all “potential co-conspirators,” were added with little discussion or consideration
by the prosecutors. In addition, although there were evidentiary and legal challenges to a
243 See, e.g., Julie K. Brown, “Perversion of Justice: How a future Trump Cabinet member gave a serial sex
abuser the deal of a lifetime,” Miami Herald, Nov. 28, 2018.

244 When OPR asked Acosta about his apparent equivocation during his 2019 press conference, in answering a
media question about whether he had knowledge of Epstein being an “intelligence asset,” Acosta stated to OPR that
“the answer is no.” Acosta was made aware that OPR could use a classified setting to discuss intelligence information.
