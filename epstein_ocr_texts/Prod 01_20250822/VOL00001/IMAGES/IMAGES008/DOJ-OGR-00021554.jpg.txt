to be blind, deaf and dumb, ano to say nething of Epstein's ana

Ms.. Maxwell's lives.

Paragraph 26, there's an. objection to the
characterization concerning the defendant."s isentification anda
isolation of minor girls: as inconsistent with the trial
evidence. I overrule this objection for the same reasons a's
artictlated. with. respect, to paragraph 22. In addition, the
trial. evidence establishea that the ocefenaant and Epstein
isolated girls by ‘spending time with them alone away from their
families. For example, Annie's testimony regarding the trip to
New Mexico: Jane's testimony that she would spend time at, the
Palm Beach residence alone with Epstein ano the cefenoant.
Paragraphs 27 ano 28 the G@efendant makes two

objéctions: First, to thé aSsertion that. the oefenoant and

Epstein, developea a scheme that created a "constant stream of

girls who. recruitea each other." And, secona, she objects. to

minor girls to provide Epstein with sexualizea massages.

Again, based on the trial testimony ana evidence, I

overrule the ebjection. It. supportea the information in these

paragraphs. Thé eviaénée indicated the Schémé startea with the.

oefendant's recruitment of Virginia. Virginia them enlistea
Carolyn in addition to at least two other girls. Carolyn in.
turn, fécruitea at least threé friénas, ana thosé frienoas then
brought more girls.
