1 to be blind, deaf and dumb, and to say nothing of Epstein's and
2 Ms. Maxwell's lives.
3 Paragraph 26, there's an objection to the
4 characterization concerning the defendant's identification and
5 isolation of minor girls as inconsistent with the trial
6 evidence. I overrule this objection for the same reasons as
7 articulated with respect to paragraph 22. In addition, the
8 trial evidence established that the defendant and Epstein
g isolated girls by spending time with them alone away from their
10 families. For example, Annie's testimony regarding the trip to
11 New Mexico. Jane's testimony that she would spend time at the
12 Palm Beach residence alone with Epstein and the defendant.
Ls Paragraphs 27 and 28 the defendant makes two
14 objections: First, to the assertion that the defendant and
15 Epstein developed a scheme that created a "constant stream of
16 girls who recruited each other." And, second, she objects to
17 the assertion that she encouraged minor girls to bring other
18 minor girls to provide Epstein with sexualized massages.
19 Again, based on the trial testimony and evidence, I
20 overrule the objection. It supported the information in these
a1 paragraphs. The evidence indicated the scheme started with the
22 defendant's recruitment of Virginia. Virginia then enlisted
23 Carolyn in addition to at least two other girls. Carolyn in
24 turn recruited at least three friends, and those friends then
25 brought more girls.
