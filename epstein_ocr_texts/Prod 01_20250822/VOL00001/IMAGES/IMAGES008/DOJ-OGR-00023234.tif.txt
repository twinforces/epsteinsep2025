C. FBI Victim Notification Pamphlets

The 2005 Guidelines recommended that “victims be given a printed brochure or card that
briefly describes their rights and available services . . . and [contact information for] the victim-
witness coordinator or specialist....” At the time of the Epstein investigation, FBI agents
nationwide routinely followed a practice of providing victims with pamphlets entitled, “Help for
Victims of Crime” and “The Department of Justice Victim Notification System.” The “Help for
Victims of Crime” pamphlet contained a listing of the eight CVRA rights. The pamphlet stated:
“Most of these rights pertain to events occurring after the indictment of an individual for the crime,
and it will be the responsibility of the prosecuting United States Attorney’s Office to ensure you
are afforded those rights.” The case agent in the Epstein investigation told OPR that she provided
victims with the FBI pamphlet upon the conclusion of an interview. The pamphlet entitled “The
Department of Justice Victim Notification System” provided an overview of the VNS and
instructions on how to access the system.
V. THE INTRODUCTORY USAO AND FBI LETTERS TO VICTIMS

A. August 2006: The FBI Victim Notification Letters

On August 8, 2006, shortly after the FBI opened its investigation into Epstein, the Victim
Specialist for the West Palm Beach FBI office, under the case agent’s direction, prepared a “Victim
Notification Form” naming 30 victims in the Epstein investigation and stating that “additional
pertinent information” about them was available in the VNS.7”° Thereafter, the Victim Specialist
entered individual victim contact information she received from the case agent into the VNS
whenever the case agent directed the Victim Specialist to generate an initial letter to a particular
victim. The FBI case agent told OPR that formal victim notification was “always handled by the
[FBI’s Victim Specialist].”?”*4

According to the VNS records, beginning on August 28, 2006, the FBI Victim Specialist
used the VNS to generate FBI letters to be sent to the victims, over her signature, identifying the
eight CVRA rights and inviting victims to provide updated contact information in order to receive
current status information about the matter. The FBI letters described the case as “currently under
investigation” and noted that “[t]his can be a lengthy process and we request your continued
patience while we conduct a thorough investigation.” The letters also stated that some of the
CVRA rights did not take effect until after an arrest or indictment: “We will make our best efforts
to ensure you are accorded the rights described. Most of these rights pertain to events occurring
after the arrest or indictment of an individual for the crime, and it will become the responsibility
of the prosecuting United States Attorney’s Office to ensure you are accorded those rights.” A
sample letter follows.
27 These 30 were drawn from the PBPD investigative file and included individuals that the PBPD had not
designated as victims and individuals the PBPD had identified but not interviewed.
274 The case agent told OPR, “[O]nce we identify a victim, then we bring [the FBI Victim Specialist] in, and as
far as anything pertaining to victim rights . . . and any resources, federal resources these victims may need comes from
[her], the Victim Specialist.”
