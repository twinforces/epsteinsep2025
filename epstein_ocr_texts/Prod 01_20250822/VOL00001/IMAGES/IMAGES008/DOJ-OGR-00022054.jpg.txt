3/312020 Barr announces DOJ inspector general investigation into Epstein death
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis announced earlier this week that the Florida Department of
Law Enforcement was launching an investigation tnto the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office
to look at every aspect of Epstein's case in Florida. The Justice Department said in February
that it had also launched an Internal inquiry into the handling of the Epstein case at the
federal level, but the status of that investigation is not known.
Epstein was arrested at the airport in Teterboro, New Jersey after returning from an overseas
trip to Paris in early July. Epstein's home in New York City was reided by law enforcement as
well, and investigators found nude photographs of underage girls, thousands of dollars in
cash, dozens of loose diamonds, and a foreign passport from the 1980s with Epstein's picture
and a false name.
Epstein's lawyers had argued that Epstein should be allowed out on house arrest, asking the
court to let him await trial in his Manhattan mansion. That request was denied. Besides his
New York City mansion, Epstein also had an estate in Palm Beach, maintained a ranch in New
Mexico, had a luxury apartment in Paris, and owned a private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.
In denying him bail earlier this month, the judge said
that Epstein posed a “significant” danger to the
community and agreed with prosecutors that he was
a serious flight risk.
