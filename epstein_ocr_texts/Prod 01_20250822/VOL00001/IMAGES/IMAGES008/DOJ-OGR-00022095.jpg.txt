prosecutors not “objcctive:evidenee” warranting discovery); Moon, 718 F.2d.at: 1230 (“to engage
in.a collateral inquiry*respecting prosecutorial motive, there ‘must be more than‘mere suspicion or:
surmise”). Thomas’s failure to make an.cvidentiary: showing in support of'the first required. prong:
means that, his motion for discovery on, his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, ¢.g:,
Bass,'536 US. at 863.

As to the second. required prong, Thomas has failed to even.allege, Ict.alone: establish, that
the decision to ‘prosecute him, was motivated, by a discriminatory purpose. ‘To make, such ‘a,
showing, a defendant must. establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for
prosecution has: been invidious or in bad faith, i.¢., based upon such impermissible considerations
as race, religion, or the desire to prevent: his exercise of constitutional rights.” ares, 978 F.2d _at.
S9 (internal. quotation marks ‘omitted;, alteration incorporated). Thomas: has ‘not put.:forth any
evidence whatsoever that. the Government's decision to prosceute Thomas was based on anything
other thar his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision. to prosecute him ar
all, based on his wholly unsupported. claim that the criminal conduct with. which. he :is charged. is
“rampant” within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But'the:mere faet that other’people were ‘not prosecuted. for
committing the crime that Thomas ‘committed docs not: mean that the Government. harboréd

discriminatory intent in,prosecuting Thomas.”

* Even if Thomas had ‘not failed to carry his burden. on his discovery motion. (and. he has
failed), he would ‘still not be entitled to put’ such evidenee ‘or argument regarding. scléctive
prosecution before a jury because 'the “selective prosccution-defense isan issue:for the court:rather
than the:jury.” Regan, 103 F.3d.at.1082. The Second.Circuit’s directive makes'sense., A,claim of
Improper prosecutorial, motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “‘is not a defense on the merits to
the criminal charge itself, but-an independent ‘asscrtion that the prosccutor has brought the charge
for. reasons ‘forbidden by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 517 US. at 463. Instead, it is’ selft
evidently “unrelated. to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is: the sole issue to be
decided by: the jury; and, as:a result, the Court alone:must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.
