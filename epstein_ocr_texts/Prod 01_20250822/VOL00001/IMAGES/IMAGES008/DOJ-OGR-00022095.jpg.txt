prosecutors not “objective evidence” warranting discovery); Moon, 718 F.2d at 1230 (“to engage
in a collateral inquiry respecting prosecutorial motive, there must be more than mere suspicion or
surmise”). Thomas’s failure to make an evidentiary showing in support of the first required prong
means that his motion for discovery on his selective prosecution claim must be denied. See, e.g.,
Bass, 536 US. at 863.

As to the second required prong, Thomas has failed to even allege, let alone establish, that
the decision to prosecute him was motivated by a discriminatory purpose. To make such a
showing, a defendant must establish that the Government’s “selection of the defendant for
prosecution has been invidious or in bad faith, i.e., based upon such impermissible considerations
as race, religion, or the desire to prevent his exercise of constitutional rights.” Fares, 978 F.2d at
59 (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration incorporated). Thomas has not put forth any
evidence whatsoever that the Government’s decision to prosecute Thomas was based on anything
other than his guilt. Instead, Thomas challenges the Government’s decision to prosecute him at
all, based on his wholly unsupported claim that the criminal conduct with which he is charged is
“rampant” within the BOP. (Mot. 7). But the mere fact that other people were not prosecuted for
committing the crime that Thomas committed does not mean that the Government harbored
discriminatory intent in prosecuting Thomas.®

8 Even if Thomas had not failed to carry his burden on his discovery motion (and he has
failed), he would still not be entitled to put such evidence or argument regarding selective
prosecution before a jury because the “selective prosecution defense is an issue for the court rather
than the jury.” Regan, 103 F.3d at 1082. The Second Circuit’s directive makes sense. A claim of
improper prosecutorial motive, whatever its ground or grounds, “is not a defense on the merits to
the criminal charge itself, but an independent assertion that the prosecutor has brought the charge
for reasons forbidden by the Constitution.” Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 463. Instead, it is self-
evidently “unrelated to factual innocence of the crime charged,” which is the sole issue to be
decided by the jury, and, as a result, the Court alone must resolve a claim of selective prosecution.
