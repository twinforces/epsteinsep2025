difficult. with Mr. Foy's trial schedule with Having the July
trial, but it seems like there may be a possibility of putting
this trial before Mr. Foy's July trial and still giving him
sufficient. time to prepare for both.

Can't. imiagine it lasting more than a week.

THE COURT: Okay. The trial is set for June 8.

With respect to the motion to dismiss, the motion. is
due on. March 9, opposition. is due by April 6, and the reply is
due on, April 20.
