In.light of these concerns, Villafatia emailed Menchel, expressing:her strong disagreement:
‘with the process:

[I]t :is: inappropriate: for you-to enter into ‘plea negotiations without.
consulting with me .or the investigative agencies, and. it is more
inappropriate to make a-plea offer that you know. is: completely:
unacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs
Enforcement], the victims, and me: These plea negotiations violate
the: Ashcroft, memo, the U.S. Attorney[s’] Manual, and. all of the
various iterations of the victims’ rights: legislation. Strategically,
you have started'the plea hegotiations: as though We are in a: position.
‘of. weakness, ‘anxious: to: make: the case go away, by: telling the
defense that we'will deimarid tio federal conviction. We léft the
meeting on.June: 26th ‘in.a stronger position. than when we: entered,

and your statement that a state resolution. would satisfy ‘us takes
away that advantage. If you. make ‘it seem like ‘the U-S. “Attorney
doesn’t. have faith in. our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to
imake a deal.

Second, your'discussion:makes it appear'that my: investigation. is for’
“show” only and comptcly 4 undermines my: ability to deal with
Epstein’s attorneys directly. .

T would. like to make «a ‘presentation to the U.S. Attorney, Jeff
[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and ‘you with our side of the-investigation
and ‘a:revised. indictment.. The presentation. will address the: points

In, the meantime, ‘please direct all communications from Epstein’s
‘counsel to me..

Menchel told. OPR he realized. Villafana was “very ‘anxious” ‘to file charges in the case.
Villafana had put.a “tremendous” amount of effort, into the: investigation, and Menchel “was. not:
unsympathetie at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. However, as Menchel told OPR,
Villafaia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a little bit more dispassionate,” and.
her urgency. was “not respectful” of Acosta’s -position.. Menchel ‘viewed the ‘tone of Villafana’s
email as “highly. unacceptable.” and her understanding;of applicable law and policy incorrect.. In.
particular, Menchel pointed out that.although the Ashcroft Memo: requires prosecutors to: charge
themost:readily prov able offense,” there is nevertheless room.for “flexibility,” and that the U:S.
Attorney has discretion—directly. or through. a, designated supervisor such, as Menchel—to waive
the: policy.
