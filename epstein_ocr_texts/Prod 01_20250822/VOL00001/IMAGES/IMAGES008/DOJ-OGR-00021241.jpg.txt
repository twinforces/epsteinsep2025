In light of these concerns, Villafafia emailed Menchel, expressing her strong disagreement
with the process:

[I]t is inappropriate for you to enter into plea negotiations without
consulting with me or the investigative agencies, and it is more
inappropriate to make a plea offer that you know is completely
unacceptable to the FBI, ICE [Immigration and Customs
Enforcement], the victims, and me. These plea negotiations violate
the Ashcroft memo, the U.S. Attorney[s’] Manual, and all of the
various iterations of the victims’ rights legislation. Strategically,
you have started the plea negotiations as though we are in a position
of weakness, anxious to make the case go away, by telling the
defense that we will demand no federal conviction. We left the
meeting on June 26th in a stronger position than when we entered,
and your statement that a state resolution would satisfy us takes
away that advantage. If you make it seem like the U.S. Attorney
doesn’t have faith in our investigation, Epstein has no incentive to
make a deal.

Second, your discussion makes it appear that my investigation is for
“show” only and completely undermines my ability to deal with
Epstein’s attorneys directly. ...

I would like to make a presentation to the U.S. Attorney, Jeff
[Sloman], Andy [Lourie], and you with our side of the investigation
and a revised indictment. The presentation will address the points
raised by Epstein’s counsel and will convince you all of the strength
of the case.

In the meantime, please direct all communications from Epstein’s
counsel to me.

Menchel told OPR he realized Villafafia was “very anxious” to file charges in the case.
Villafafia had put a “tremendous” amount of effort into the investigation, and Menchel “was not
unsympathetic at all to her desires” to pursue a federal case. However, as Menchel told OPR,
Villafafia’s supervisors, including Acosta, were “trying to be a little bit more dispassionate,” and
her urgency was “not respectful” of Acosta’s position. Menchel viewed the tone of Villafafia’s
email as “highly unacceptable,” and her understanding of applicable law and policy incorrect. In
particular, Menchel pointed out that although the Ashcroft Memo requires prosecutors to charge
the “most readily provable offense,” there is nevertheless room for “flexibility,” and that the U.S.
Attorney has discretion—directly or through a designated supervisor such as Menchel—to waive
the policy.
