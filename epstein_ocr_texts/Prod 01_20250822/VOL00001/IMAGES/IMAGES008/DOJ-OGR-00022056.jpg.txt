reassigned inthe aftermath of financiér and alleséd sex trafficker’ Jéffrej! Epstéin’s death in:August-while in federal custody. As the bureau, which oversees
122 federal prisons‘and more than:170,000 inmates nationwide; is working to’ ‘implement the First Step Act's prison reforms and deal with thé circumstances
that led to Epsteiri's death, itis: facing severeiresotitce issues, according to’Haivk Sawyer.

“\We have put such huge strains‘on the Bureaw‘of Prisons trying to accomplish its‘mission,” Hawk Sawyer said before thie’ Serinte Judiciagy Committee: “With
‘the dramatic seth wens had,.the. we budget cuts, staffing shortages, it's just been incredible to me that the bureau has been able. to o function n duns the last16

Hawk Sawyer attributed the:resource problem to the rapidi increase in.the prison‘popilation in ‘the last 30 years, employees:retiringat a faster rate than they
arehired, uncertain budgets, the Técent government shutdown andthe’ hiring {freeze early.in the Trump administration. “We have never had-sdeqiaté
resources to’ provide all the programs .forall.the inmates,” Hawk Sawyer said. “I'm hoping that will change now since you all support the First Step Act.”
