Maxwell. Judge Nathan also correctly rejected Max-
well’s “central argument” that she should imply or in-
fer bias “based:on the purported similarities between.
[Juror 50’s] personal history and. the issues at trial.”
(A. 342-43). Judge Nathan.explained that she “need not.
imagine a wholly hypothetical universe” to reach that
conclusion. (A.344). During voir dire, she asked “every

juror described her own childhood sexual abuse at an
age closer to the victims in. this case; another described,
a friend’s recent: coercive sexual abuse by a professor.
(A.345). Maxwell did, not even. bring a for-cause chal-

lenge against Juror 50 would not have prevailed.

answered ‘the questionnaire accurately, it. “clearly”
would have provided a basis for a for-cause challenge.”
(Br.67). In particular, Maxwell challenges Judge Na-
than’s finding that Juror 50 was credible and. unbi-
ased, relying on.a few isolated statements drawn from
various parts of the hearing transcript and some of his
post-verdict' statements. (Br.71-72). As. described
above, Judge Nathan explained how Juror 50’s expla-
nation for his. erroneous answers. was plausible and
consistent, and she found him credible after assessing
his demeanor through challenging questioning. She
also properly disregarded his post-verdict statements
about the case, explaining: that “[a] juror’s view of a
case and defendant would necessarily change after
