5. As to both defendants, any and all reports, memorandums, written
statements, photos, videos, and incident reports created, manufactured or
possessed by any investigative or disciplinary agencies, participating in
the investigation of the defendants, allied with the prosecution, and to
which the prosecution has access
Defendant, Thomas, believes that the information contained in all of the requested
documents may contain information that tends to exculpate him. He believes, in addition, that
there may be other witnesses, or witness statements that are relevant, and which are not in the
possession of the FBI investigators, who submitted reports in this case. Such reports will contain
detailed information and statistics that show the conduct in which the defendant is being charged
with a crime were; 1) rampant throughout the BOP; 2) made with knowledge and acquiescence
by the leadership of the BOP; 3) made as a result of BOP policies that forced the defendant to
engage in conduct for which he is now being charged criminally, and; 4) made in a manner
which contains a ‘possible discriminatory application of BOP policies by government
"prosecutors.
The information requested by this motion is not the only information that Mr. Thomas
seeks under Rule 16 and Brady-Giglio, Further discovery motions will be necessary, once
, counsel has had the opportunity to review any response made by the government, in compliance
with any order entered by this Court on this motion, The present motion is filed at this time
because the government has refused the defendant’s request to engage in a fair and impartial
disclosure of relevant discovery. Early resolution of this dispute will enable defense counsel to
determine the necessity and scope of pretrial subpoenas duces tecum. |
