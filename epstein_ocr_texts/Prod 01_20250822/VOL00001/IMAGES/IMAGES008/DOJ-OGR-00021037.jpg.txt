MR. EVERDELE: No, ‘your Honor. We rest on the papers.

THE. COURT: I thank you :counsel, Sor ‘your, thorough
orie=ing. I am prepared to rule.

The defendant raises four objections te the
calculation of thé, gUidéline rangé containéd in the PSR. AS wé
discusséd, first, She argués I must apply the 2003 guidelines
rather than ‘the 2004 guidelines. Beyond that, she oojects to
the application of three sentencing enhancements. The
government's sole opjection to ‘the calculation of ‘the
guidelinés is that. Virginia Roserts and Mélissa should ‘be

considered victims. So I will address the defense opjections

and ‘then the government"s onjections.

I, begin oy determining which of the Guideline manuals
apply. Genérally, a séntencéing Gourt applies the version of
the ‘guidelines in effect on the date that the defendant is
sentenced. 18 U.S.C. Section 35:53 (a) (4) (A) (ii). But the
Ex Post Facto Clause is violated if a defendant is sentenced
uhdér Guidelines i8sued aftér She's committed her offénse and
the new Guidelines provide a higher sentencing range than the
version in place at the time of the offense. That's the
principle of a case called Peugh v. United States, 569 J.S, 330
(2013). In 'that! casé, a Sentencing court must! -- in the case
of a higher range at the time of sentencing than in place at

the time of the offense, in that tase the sentencing court must

apply the guidelines in effect when the offense was committed.
