offenses that arose from the Federal Grand Jury investigation
will be instituted in this District, and the charges against Epstein
if any, will be dismissed."

The only language in the NPA that speaks to the agreement’s scope is
limiting language.

The negotiation history of the NPA, just as the text, fails to show
that the agreement was intended to bind other districts. Under our
Court’s precedent, the negotiation history of an NPA can support an
inference that an NPA “affirmatively” binds other districts.'* Yet, the
actions of USAO-SDFL do not indicate that the NPA was intended to
bind other districts.

The United States Attorney’s Manual that was operable during
the negotiations of the NPA required that:

No district or division shall make any agreement, including any

agreement not to prosecute, which purports to bind any other

district(s) or division without the express written approval of
38 A-175 (emphasis added). The agreement's scope is also limited in an additional section:

THEREFORE, on the authority of R. Alexander Acosta, United States Attorney for

the Southern District of Florida, prosecution in this District for these offenses shall be

deferred in favor of prosecution by the State of Florida, provided that Epstein

abides by the following conditions and the requirements of this Agreement set forth

below.

Id. (emphasis added).
