certain. discrimination claims, and held that applying
the new statute in.a ‘ease “filed, after its enactment, but.
arising out.of events that: predate its.enactment,” is not:
impermissibly retroactive under Landgraf. Id. at 889-
90. As the Court explained, “[t]he conduct: to which the
statute of limitations applies is not the primary con-
duct of the defendants, the alleged discrimination, but.
is instead the secondary conduct of the plaintiffs, the
filing of their suit.” Jd. at 890. The 2003 amendment.to
Section 3283: likewise applies: only to the secondary
conduct of filing a criminal case; it. does. not apply ‘to:

by, for example, modifying the. elements. of an offense
to criminalize conduct that previously had not consti;
tuted a crime. See id. at 891 (“Landgraf arid other
cases countenance treating statutes of limitations dif:
ferently ‘from statutory provisions that affect substan-

2003 amendment “impaired ’ no. rights possessed. by el-

Enterprise does not alter this coriclusion. There,
this Court considered whether an amended statute of
limitations oper ated to. “revive already expired securi-
ties fraud claims.” Enterprise, 391 F.3d at 405. While
acknowledging that under Vernon, “retroactive appli-
cation of a revised statute of limitations generally does.
not have an impermissible retroactive effect,” the
Court concluded. that “the resurrection of previously
time-barred claims has an impermissible retroactive
effect.” Id. at 409-10 (emphasis removed). Enterprise’
has no application -here, as the limitations period for
