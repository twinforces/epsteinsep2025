and willfully made a false statement. Nor are those excuses relevant to whether Thomas had a
criminal agreement with his co-defendant. Indeed, evidence as to a defendant’s purportedly
innocent motive in a false statement case is irrelevant to the question of intent. See United States
v. Washington, 705 F.2d 489, 493-94 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (holding that proof of a good or innocent
motive is not probative of intent where the mens rea is “knowingly and willfully”); Jn re Terrorist
Bombings of U.S. Embassies in E. Africa, 552 F.3d 93, 154 n.49 (2d Cir. 2008) (citing Washington,
705 F.2d at 493, for “the irrelevance of a motive to the question of whether conduct is intentional”);
United States v. George, 786 F. Supp. 56, 64 (D.D.C. 1992) (rejecting the defendant’s “context
argument” for why materials could be relevant to the crime charged).

For the same reasons, “other people were doing it” is not a defense to a false statements or
conspiracy charge because the conduct of other BOP employees is irrelevant to each of the
foregoing elements. Thomas argues that because he was aware of incidents where BOP employees
falsified records and “their conduct did not lead to their indictment or incarceration,” evidence of
what other BOP employees have done is relevant to his intent. (Mot. 6.) Not so. Whether Thomas
believed falsifying records was illegal or was subject to criminal penalties is not relevant to the
charges against him. See United States v. Southland Corp., 760 F.2d 1366, 1372 (2d Cir. 1985)
(“Ignorance of the law is no defense to a charge of purposeful and intentional action.”); United
States v. Rosenfield, 469 F.2d 598, 601 n.2 (3d Cir. 1972) (“As long as the inexcusable intent is
present, it is not necessary that the defendant know that his conduct is subject to criminal
penalties.”). And in any event, it would be fundamentally inappropriate, and extremely prejudicial,
for the jury to consider other individuals not on trial or otherwise relevant to the conduct charged
here, in evaluating the guilt or innocence of the defendant. See United States v. Gibbons, 602 F.2d
1044, 1048 (2d Cir. 1979) (approving instruction that jury was not to consider individuals who
