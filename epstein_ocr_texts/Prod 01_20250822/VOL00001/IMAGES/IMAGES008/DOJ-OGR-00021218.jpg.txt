2, May:2006: The USAO Accepts the Case and Opens a.Case File

On. May 23, 2006, Villafana prepared.the’ paperwork to open.a USAO case file. Villafatia
told OPR that several aspects of the case implicated federal interests and potentially merited a.
federal prosecution: (1) the victimization of, minors through, the: use: of. facilities of interstate:
commerce (the’telephone and.airports); (2) the number‘of-victims:involved; (3) the:possibility that:
Epstein, had been producing or possessing child pornography (suggested by ‘the removal of the
computer ‘equipment fronr his :residence); and (4) ‘the possibility that improper political. pressure:
had: affected the State Attorney Office’s handling: of ‘the case. The investigation. was named
“Operation Leap Year” because the: state investigation. had identified. approximately 29: girls as:
victims of Epstein’s conduct.”

Villafana ‘told. OPR. that from. the outset of the federal, investigation, she understood that:
the: case would require a great deal of time: and. effort given ‘the number of potential victims and
Epstein’s financial resourees. Nonetheless, Villafana was willing:to put in the effort and believed.
that the FBI Awas. similar ly cominitted to the case. Villafana discussed the case with, her iminediate
supervisor;, who also “thought it would’ be a good, case” and. approved. It:to be opened. within the:
USAO’s file management, system, and on May 23, 2006, it-was formally initiated.

3. July 14, 2006: Villafafia Informs.Acosta and Sloman about the Case

‘Because: Villafatia was not familiar with Epstein, she researched his background. and
leatned.that he “took a scorched earth approach” to litigation, Villafania was aware that, Epstein.
had hired multiple lawyers: to interact with the State Attorney’s Office: in an effort to ‘derail. the:
state case, and she believed, he. would likely do the same in. connection. with, any federal
investigation.

Therefore, Villafaia arranged. to: mect. with U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta and Jeffrey
Sloman, who atthetime was the Criminal.Division-Chicf,”! Villafafiatold’OPR.:that:she had-never
before asked.to meet with “executive management” about initiating a case, but the allegations that.
Epstein had improperly influenced. the: State Attorney’s: Office greatly. troubled her. Villafatia
explained | to OPR. that she’ wanted to: ensure that her. senior:supervisors were “on board” with the
Epstein. Investigation. In addition, she viewed Sloman.as a friend, im whom she: had particular
confidence. At. this point, although. Villafana’s immediate Supervisor was aware of the case,
Villatatia did. not inform. Andrew Lourie,’ who was then im char ge. of ‘the West Palnv Beach. office.
aiid her sécond-life supervisor, about:the matter of that she was bricfing Acosta and. Sloman.

Villafata met with Acosta and Sloman ‘in Miami on July 14,:2006. She told OPR. that at:
the meeting, she informed:them that the PBPD had-identified.a.group of girls who had provided.to

20 Villafafia; opened “Operation Leap Year? during, the same month «in which the, Department ‘launched «its
“Project Safe: Childhood” initiative, and-Acosta.designated ‘Villataiia to serve as the USAO's Project;Sate Childhood.
ccoordinator:.
