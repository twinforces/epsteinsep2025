authority to deviate from the Ashcroft Memo’s “most serious readily. provable: offense”
requirement.

Although Acosta. could not recall specifically how. or by. whonr the decision was made‘to:
or by. whom the decision was made: to reduce the: sentencing requirement: from. two years to 18
months, Acosta was aware of these changes.. He reviewed and approved the final NPA. before it:
was signed. Department policy-gave him.the:discretion to:approve the agreement,.notwithstanding,
any arguable failure to comiply with the “most serious readily ‘provable offense” requirentent.
Furthermore, the Ashcroft.Memo does not appear to preclude: aUs, Attorney: from deferring: toia
State prosecution, so it.is not clear that the Memo’s terms apply ‘to a Situation involving state
char ges. Accordingly, OPR concludes that the negotiation. ofan agreement that allowed Epstein
to resolve the federal ifiv estigation in returi for the. imposition of an 18-iionth state sentence. did.
not violate a clear and. unambiguous’ standard. and. therefore. does not..constitute professional.
miscondiict. .

2. The USAO’s Agreement. Not. to Prosecute Unidentified “Potential
‘Co-Conspirators” Did Not: Violate. a Clear :and Unambiguous
‘Department Policy

Several.witnesses.told-OPR that. they believed.the: gov ernment’s agreement not to: prosecute:
unidentified “potential co-conspirators” amounted, to: “transactional. immunity,” ‘which the:
witnesses asserted is prohibited. by Department policy. ‘Although “use immunity” protects. a
witness only: against the: government’s use of his or her immunized ‘testimony in a prosecution of
the witness, and is frequently’ used by’prosecutors, transactional immunity protects a witness from,
prosecution altogether and is relatively. rare..

OPR. found.no policy prohibiting a'U.S. Attorney from declining to’prosecute third parties
or Providing tr ansactional immunity One section, of the USAM, related: to immunity but applied,
Amendment orivilege. “See USAM § 393 100. en Statutory. provisions relating, to immunity
also. address the: same context. See 18ULS.C. § 6002: 21 U.S.C..§ 884. Moreover, apart. from
voluntariness or. enforceability:;concerns, courts; have:not suggested that.a prosecutor’s promise not
to ‘prosecute a third party amounts to an, inappropriate exercise of prosecutorial discretion. See,
e.g., Marquez, 909 F.2d at 741-43; Kemp, 760, F.2d at. 1248; Stinson, 839 So. 2d at 909: Frazier,
607 So; 2d 945. OPR found. to clear and: unambiguous’ standard that-was violated by. the USAO’s
agreement. not: to ‘prosecute * ‘potential co-conspirators,” and therefore cannot. conclude that.
negotiating or approving this provision Violated a clear and unambiguous’ standard of constituted
professional.misconduct.

Notwithstanding, this finding, in Section IV of this Part, OPR ‘includes in ‘its criticism
Acosta’s: decision to: approve the NPA. his approval of this provision without considering its
potential consequences, including to whom it would-apply:,
