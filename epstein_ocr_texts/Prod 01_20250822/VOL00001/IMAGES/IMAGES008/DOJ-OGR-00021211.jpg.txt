CHAPTER TWO
THE NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT,

PART ONE: FACTUAL: BACKGROUND:

In. the following sections in this chapter, the Office of Professional. Responsibility (OPR)
details ‘the significant. events leading to, and. during, the. federal investigation of Epstein: the:
negotiation and signing of the NPA;, and the defense’s subsequent nine-month effort-to stop the:
NPA from taking effect. OPR also deseribes more briefly the events occurring after Epstein pled,
guilty in, state court, as the USAO sought'to hold him to the terms of the: agreement. In-describing
events, OPR. relies heavily on. ‘contemporancous documents, particularly emails. In many
instances, the emails not only describe-meetings and identify’ the participants, but. also set forth the.
‘issues under discussion, the alternatives considered, and the basis for certain. decisions.. When.
helpful to explain the actions taken by the subjects, OPR also ‘includes the subjects” explanations
as provided in their written responses to, or interviews with, OPR,. or explanations: provided ‘by
witnesses.

A timeline of key events. is sét forth on the‘following page.
