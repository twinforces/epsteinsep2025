1 THE COURT: I can't answer this ambiguous question no.
2 I don't know that the answer is no, even with the ambiguity;

3 because I don't know if what they have in mind is an aiding and
4 abetting guestion, which we haven't discussed yet.

8 MS. MENNINGER: They never used the word "abet."

6 THE COURT: That's true. I won't assume that's the

7 question for purposes of the answer, but I also don't assume

8 the meaning that you've put on it for purposes of the answer.

9 So the only solution here is to say, I direct you to consider
10 the full instruction on Element 2 of Count Four on page 28.

11 MS. MENNINGER: Our request would be to emphasize the
12 portion of that that talks about the purpose of the travel.

13 Because they have highlighted the purpose of the travel in

14 their question. And the way I read it is certainly that that's
15 their question. If they don't have evidence that the intent on
16 the return flight was for purposes of sexual activity, then I
17 do think the answer, as Mr. Everdell said is, no, they can't

18 convict.

19 MS. STERNHEIM: May I have a moment?
20 (Counsel conferred)
21 MR. EVERDELL: Your Honor, I'm sorry to raise another
22 issue, but I think we have to, given the note itself.
23 One moment. Sorry. The photograph on the phone keeps
24 disappearing.
25 We're talking about they are referring to Count Four,
