(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 1, 2022) (Nathan, J.) (“$3286(b)’s use of the terms ‘foreseeable’
and ‘commission of such offense’ ... dictate a case-specific approach.”’).

It is noteworthy that the District Court could not identify a single page of
legislative history supporting its expansive interpretation of § 3283. But that did
not deter it from asserting, without citation to primary authority, that, when
Congress extended the statute of limitations, it “evinced a general intention to cast
a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against children as possible.” A144. This
questionable statement ultimately derives from a Third Circuit opinion, U.S. v.
Schneider, 801 F.3d 186, 196 (3d Cir. 2015), which itself quotes an Eleventh
Circuit case, United States v. Dodge, 597 F.3d 1347, 1355 (11th Cir. 2010).
Dodge, however, had nothing to do with § 3283. Instead, Dodge addressed the Sex
Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), a completely different
statute passed years after the relevant amendment to § 3283. Worse still, the full
quote from Dodge is a comment about SORNA’s fext, not its legislative history.
See Dodge, 597 F.3d at 1355 (“Our review of the language of SORNA confirms our
conclusion that Congress cast a wide net to ensnare as many offenses against
children as possible.”) (emphasis added). Thus, the Third Circuit—and, by
extension, the District Court—grossly misread Dodge and conjured up a legislative
history for § 3283 that does not exist. If anything, § 3283’s legislative history
