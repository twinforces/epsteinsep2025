the jury might convict based on Jane’s testimony’ that.
she was abused in New Mexico. (A.224-25). Maxwell
asked Judge Nathan to instruct: the jury as to the in-
tent elements of Counts Two and. Four, and add that
“[a]n. intent that Jane engage in sexual activity in any
state other than New York cannot :form the basis of

these two elements of Counts Two.and Four.” (A.229).

Judge Nathan. rejected Maxwell's request both. be-
cause. the jury: did ‘not inquire. about Count. Two and
because the final sentence as “just. wrong” jin. suggest-
ing that:an intent: that Jane engage in, sexual activity
outside of New York “may have no relevance.”
(Tr.3149). As Judge Nathan explained, “This is the
same. discussion. we’ve had a couple of times .... Sex-
ual activity with respect: to Jane in New Mexico under
the.age of 17 can be relevant to an intent to transport.
to. New York to engage in séxwal. activity under the age
of 17 ....” (Tr.8149-50). Judge Nathan repeated that.
she did “not know how to parse ‘the jury’s question éx>
actly,” but that her instruction directing the jury to the
original chargé included a reminder that “it’s a viola-
tion of New York penal law that’s charged and is the
illegal sexual activity that they're considéring.”
(Tr.3150). Judge Nathan. also pointed out ‘that Max:
well. :did not “seek to. exclude” Jane’s testimony about
New Mexico, or “seek a limiting instruction with re-
spect to that testimony.” (Tr.3153). Judge: Nathan
added “I have no idea if that’s what the jury is asking
or many other plausible readings,” noted that the de-
fense had proposed an “incorrect” instruction, and con-
cluded. no more was required than. sending, the jury.
“back. to. the charge.” (Tr.3154).
