the. FBI case agents ‘to hand. deliver the: letters “as. they were conducting interviews.” Villafania,
told OPR. that the USAO. had “no standardized way to do any ‘victim. notifications prior. to” the.
filing of federal charges, and therefore. Villafania, did. not; use a template of VNS-generated letter
for content, butcinstead used a letter she “had created and. crafted [herself] for another case.”~ 271

before the-cireumstances of those: individuals had been fully investigated and. before-any. charging
