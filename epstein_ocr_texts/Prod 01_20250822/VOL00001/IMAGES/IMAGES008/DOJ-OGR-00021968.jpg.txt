1 case or in her history, but I need to be concerned about

2 sending law enforcement officers who work for the Court, who

3 are going to be supervising your client, and it is for their

4 safety that we impose that condition.

a So I am going to impose the condition. I am going to
6 require your client to surrender her firearm. Both defendants
7 will have to surrender their firearms and their permits so that
8 they can't secure new firearms. That is a safety precaution

9 that we undertake to protect our people who are going to be

10 enforcing the terms of this release. It has nothing to do with
11 the government per se.

12 So with that, I will release the defendants today on
13 their own signature and the posting of $100,000 bond that needs
14 to be secured by two financially responsible cosigners.

15 You're going to report, each of you, to your pretrial
16 officer, as directed.

17 I believe you've surrendered your travel documents,

18 your passports, and the like. If you haven't, you need to

19 surrender your travel documents, and you're prohibited from
20 making any new travel applications.
al Each of you is prohibited from having contact with the
22 other, meaning your codefendant, except in the presence of
23 counsel. As I just stated, each of you needs to surrender any
24 firearms, both personal use and duty firearms, and the permits
25 that authorize those, to pretrial.
