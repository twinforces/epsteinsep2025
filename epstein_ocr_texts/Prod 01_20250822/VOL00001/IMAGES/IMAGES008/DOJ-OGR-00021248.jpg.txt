D. Acosta Decides on :a Resolution. That Includes: a. Two-Year Term. of
Incarceration

The next critical step in. the development of’ the NPA-was ‘the: decision to propose a two-
year term of imprisonment. Although presented.to’the defense as the “minimum” the USAO would.
accept, in.actuality thetwo-year proposal became only'the starting point for the negotiations, with
the: result that the defense continued. to chip away at it as the negotiations continued. The
contemporancous; emails make no mention. of any rationale for the: decision to. propose: two: years
as ‘the government’s beginning negotiating position, and ‘nobody. with whom OPR spoke was able
to recall how the decision-was made: As:discussed below,, Acosta did offer OPR an explanation,
but OPR.was'unable to find contemporaneous evidence supporting it. 76,

While: the: defense was: communicating ‘its objections to the federal. investigation ‘to
Villafana, Lourie, Menchel, and Sloman, Villafata continued moving toward filing charges. On
July. 19, 2007, the day after receiving Oosterbaan’s email supporting a potential prosecution,
Villafana. emailed, Lourie and Menchel, secking approval to take’ further investigative steps
regarding three of Epstein’s assistants. However, Menchel:directed Villafafia to “hold off’... «until.
we decide what. course of action we are going ‘to take on [E]pstein which should happen next,
week.” Menchel. told OPR. that he did. not specifically recall why he:asked ‘Villafafia to wait, but
he assuined it;was because Acosta, was deciding what course-of action to take: on the case.

‘On. Monday, July:23, 2007, Menchel:submitted.a resignation notice to Acosta, stating: that:
he would.be leaving the USAO effective August 6, 2007.””

‘Te The July 26, 2007 Meeting in Miami

Early onthe morning:of Thursday, July, 26, 2007, Villafana informed.Menchel that:she was
preparing a. new draft indictment containing revisions he.had suggested, including. removal of-all
but three of the “travel counts” and ‘“‘a‘large number of [the] overt acts,” and'the addition of overt
‘acts -and counts relating to two: additional ‘victims: she would not, however, Have the ‘revised.
‘indictment ready in.time.“*for‘our discussion today” at their.2:00 p.m. meeting. Menchel told OPR.
that the: fact that.he had both pr oposed. révisions to, the. indictment and also directéd Villafana to
delay.the inv. estigative steps inv olving: the-assistants indicated. that he.was: “trying todo something”
with the case, but was waiting for Acosta:to decide the “underlying issue” of whether to proceed.
with federal char ges.

Acosta made that decision on-or'before.July 26, 2007. On:that afternoon, Villafana met. in
Miami with. Menchel. She told OPR. that.Sloman, as, well as the FBI case agents and. their
supervisors, were also present, with, Louric participating by telephone. Villafania, told OPR that
