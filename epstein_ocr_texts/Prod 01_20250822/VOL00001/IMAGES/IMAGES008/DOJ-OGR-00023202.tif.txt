OPR asked Villafafia about these emails and about the tenor of her interactions with
Lefkowitz during the NPA negotiations and with other defense attorneys generally. Villafafia
acknowledged that their tone was collegial and collaborative, and explained that generally, the
tone of these emails reflected her personality and her commitment to complete the task her
supervisors had assigned to her:

[I|f you were to pull all my e-mails on every case, you would find
that that is how I communicate with people. I’m a Minnesota girl,
and I prefer not to be confrontational until I have to be. And I can
be when I need to be. But my instructions from my supervisors were
to engage in these negotiations and to complete them. So I felt that
given that task, the best way to complete them was to reach the
agreement and, keeping in mind the terms that . . . our office had
agreed to, and do that in a way that is civil. So... although my
language in the kind of introductory or prefatory communications
with Mr. Lefkowitz was casual and was friendly, when you look at
the terms and when he would come back to me asking for changes,
my response was always, “No, I will not make that change.”

Villafafia denied any intention to keep the victims uninformed about the NPA or to provide
an improper benefit for Epstein, and she explained the context of the emails in question. The email
in which Villafafia expressed reluctance to “highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and all
of the other persons that we could charge” was written in response to a defense proposal to include
in the federal plea agreement the parties were then considering a promise by the government not
to prosecute Epstein’s assistants and other employees. Lefkowitz had proposed that the plea
agreement state, “Epstein’s fulfilling the terms and conditions of the Agreement also precludes the
initiation of any and all criminal charges which might otherwise in the future be brought against
[four named female assistants] or any employee of [a specific Epstein-owned corporate entity] for
any criminal charge that arises out of the ongoing federal investigation.” Villafafia told OPR that
the USAO was not intending to charge Epstein’s assistants and was not aware of anyone else who
could be charged, and thus did not oppose the request not to prosecute third parties. However,
Villafafia was concerned that an overly detailed federal plea agreement would prompt the court to
require the government to provide further information about the uncharged conduct, which might
lead Epstein to claim the government breached the agreement by providing information to the
court not directly connected to the charges to which he was pleading guilty. Villafafia was not the
only one to express concern about how deeply a federal court might probe the facts, and whether
such probing would interfere with the viability of a plea agreement. In an earlier email, Lourie
had suggested charging Epstein by complaint to allow the USAO more flexibility in plea
negotiations and avoid the problem that a court might not accept a plea to a conspiracy charge that
required dismissal of numerous substantive counts.

As to Villafafia’s offer to meet with Lefkowitz “off campus” to resolve outstanding issues
in the NPA negotiation, she explained to OPR that she believed a face-to-face meeting at a
“neutral” location—with “all the necessary decision makers present or ‘on call’”— might facilitate
completion of the negotiations, which had dragged on for some time.
