‘requires dismissal. Neitherargument is persuasive.

Annabi contains no exception:forout-of=district prosecutions for charges that are
‘identical to:the dismissed:charges.” In the, language Maxwell. cites from Annabi, the Second
Circuit discussed.(and rejected) a:claim’based on the Double Jeopardy Clause, not a‘claim.based,
on-the plea.agreement:in that case. See Annabi, 771, F.2d.at 672. In.that section of the opinion,
