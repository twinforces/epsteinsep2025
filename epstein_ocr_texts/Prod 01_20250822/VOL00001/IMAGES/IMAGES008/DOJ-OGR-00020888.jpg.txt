During jury selection, hundreds of prospective jurors were given questionnaires asking, among
other things, if they or anyone in their families had experienced sexual abuse, court records
show.
For those who answered yes, the judge in the case asked during follow-up questioning if it would
affect their ability to serve as a fair or impartial juror, the records show.
Scotty David said he did not recall being asked about his experience during follow-up
questioning, known as voir dire. He said he "flew through" the initial questionnaire and also did
not recall being asked on the form about personal experiences with sexual abuse, but that he
would have answered honestly.
The U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan wrote a letter to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan on
Wednesday asking her to conduct an inquiry into the juror's description of being a victim of
sexual abuse and his responses to the questionnaire, in light of the juror's statements to outlets
including Reuters.
"While the court instructed jurors that they were free to discuss their jury service with anyone of
their choosing, some of the statements, as related in the media, merit attention by the court,"
the letter read.
Maxwell's defense attorneys did not respond to requests for comment about Scotty David's
account of the jury deliberations or his responses to questions during jury selection.
Jurors were not identified by name during the trial. Scotty David shared with Reuters a
photograph of an instruction sheet from the court telling him to return on Nov. 29 for the final
day of jury selection. His juror number, which is listed on the sheet, was among the 18 chosen as
jurors or alternates.
Maxwell's defense lawyers argued that the women's memories had been corrupted over the
years and that they were motivated by money to implicate Maxwell.
Scotty David said several jurors initially were not sure whether to convict Maxwell on the sex
trafficking count, which is backed up by the testimony of a woman named Carolyn who said she
was 14 when Epstein began abusing her in 2002.
But he said some jurors changed their minds after hearing the personal story of one juror who
said she grew up poor. Carolyn said she dropped out of school in seventh grade and was paid
$300 - sometimes by Maxwell - each time she gave Epstein an erotic massage. Carolyn said she
used the cash to buy drugs.
