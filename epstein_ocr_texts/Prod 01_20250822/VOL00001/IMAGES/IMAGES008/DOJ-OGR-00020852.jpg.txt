Despite the government’s confidence, Court Exhibit #15 indicates that the jury is
considering a conviction on Count Four based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and
alleged sexual abuse that purportedly took place in New Mexico. Should the jury convict on this
basis, it would be a constructive amendment and/or a variance from the express language of Count
Four. Jane’s alleged travel from Florida to New York and the sex acts that she purportedly
engaged in there in violation of New York law are part of the “core of criminality” charged in
Count Four. See Wozniak, 126 F.3d at 109-111 (finding constructive amendment where
indictment charged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, but the evidence at
trial focused on marijuana). A conviction based on Jane’s travel to and from New Mexico and any
sexual activity that allegedly occurred while she was there would be premised on facts elicited at
trial that are “completely distinct” from the allegations in the indictment. Gross, 2017 WL
4685111, at *20. Ifthe Court does not instruct the jury that they cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on
Count Four based on the alleged events in New Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms.
Maxwell of an offense “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive
amendment. /d. A constructive amendment like this is per se reversible error without a showing
of prejudice. United States v. Frank, 156 F.3d 332, 337 n.5 (2d Cir. 1998).

At the very least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count Four based on Jane’s alleged
sexual activity in New Mexico, it would be a substantial variance from the allegations in the S2
Indictment, which requires an intent that Jane travel to New York and violate New York law. The
Court should instruct the jury as requested below to prevent such a variance from occurring. Ms.
Maxwell has no burden to prove prejudice at this point since the variance can still be prevented by
