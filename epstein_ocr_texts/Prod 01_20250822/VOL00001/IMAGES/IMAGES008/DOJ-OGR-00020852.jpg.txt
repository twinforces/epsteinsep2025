‘Despite the goveriiinent’s confidence, Couit Exhibit #15 indicates that the-jury is
considering a conviction on Count Four based. on Jane’s trayel to and:ftom. New: Mexico and,
alleged sexual abuse that purportedly:took place in New Mexico. Should-the.jury convict on this.
basis, it would be a constructive amendment and/or:a-variance. from the express, language of Count:
‘Four. Jane’s alleged/travel. from Florida:to New: York.and the sex acts that she purportedly:
engaged in‘there in violation ef New Y.ork law are part of the-tcore of criminality” charged in
Count Four. See Wozniak, 126 F.3d-at 109-111 (finding:constructive amendment where
indictment charged a conspiracy to distribute cocaine and.methamphetamine, but the evidence at
‘trial focused on marijuana). .A conviction based.on Jane’s travel to. and:from.New Mexico and any
sexual activity that:allegedly-occurred; while she was ‘there would, be premised on ‘facts elicited at
‘trial that are “completely distinct”:{rom the allegations in;the indictment.. Gross, 201.7 WL
4685.11 1, at *20.. Ifthe Court does not instruct the:jury that they cannot convict Ms.'Maxwell on
Count Four’based on the alleged eventsyin:New'Mexico, it would permit the jury to convict Ms.
‘Maxwell of an offénse “other than that charged in the indictment” and constitute a constructive
amendment. /d. A constructive amendment like this is per se reversible error without a showing
of prejudice. United Siates v. Frank, 156:F.3d 332, '337 n.5 (2d.Cir. 1998).

Atthervery least, if the jury convicts Ms. Maxwell on Count‘Four'based on Jane’s alleged
sexual activity ‘in.New ‘Mexico, it would-be a substantial. variance from the ‘allegations in the $2
Indictment,;which requires ‘an intent that Janestravel. to New Yorkzand violate New York/law. The
Court should instruct:the jury. as requested below to prevent'such a variance from occurring. Ms.

-Maxwell has no burden to‘prove prejudice at’this point since the variance can still be:prevented by:
