‘its entirety, reads ‘as, follows: “the United States. also agrees that it will.not institute,any: criminal
charges against-any: potential co-conspirators of Epstein.” Dkt..No. 142-1 at'5. Under Annabi,
Salameh, and, Gonzalez, a statement that “the United, States” agrees ‘not to, prosecute. implies no.
‘restriction on prosecutions,in-other districts.

‘Two provisions of the NPA refer specifically to prosecution-in.the Southern District of"
Florida. The first states:that the'U.S. Attorney, forthe: Southern District;of-Florida will:defer
“prosecution. in:this District” ifEpstein complies with the agreement. Dkt. No. 142-1, at.2. The
second. states that no prosecution “will-be instituted inthis: District, and the:charges against
‘Epstein if'any, wall'be:dismissed” after he fulfills the:agreement*s conditions. Maxwell:contends'
‘that the lack:of:similar‘language in the co-conspirator provision must mean thatit lacks any
geographical limitation. 1 fanything,, that:language reflects that the NPA’s scope was expressly
‘limited to: the Southern District of Florida. ‘It is not plausible—let alone'“affirmatively
apparent”, Annabi, 771. F.2d at 672,—that the parties ‘intended to: drastically:expand the
agreement”s geographic: scope in the single. sentence on the prosecution. of co-conspirators.
‘without clearly: so saying.

Without ‘an affirmative statement inthe NPA?s text,. Maxwell turns. tots negotiation
history. Under. Second Circuit preecdent she may offer’evidence: that:negotiations of the NPA.
‘between. the defendantand the prosecutors:included:a promise to-bind other. districts. See United
States v. Russo, 80.1 F.2d:624, 626 (2d.Cir. 1986). Shesalleges that officials in the U.S.
Attorney's Office for the Southern, District of Florida, sought and. obtained ‘approval for the’ NPA
from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General and-communicated with attorneys in other,
districts. Any involvement of attorneys ‘outside the Souther District of Elorida appears to haye

‘been-minimal. ‘Maxwell has already‘received access to’ an-unusually large amount of information,
