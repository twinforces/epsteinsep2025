A. The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Attorney-for the
Southern_District of New York

United States Attorneys speak; for the United States. When a U-S. Attorney makes:a.
promise as part ofia'plea bargain, both contract'principles and. due process require the federal
government to: fulfill it. See Santobello y..New York, 404°U.S. 257,262 (1971); United States vy.
Ready, 82 F.3d 551,558 (2d Cir. 1996). The-question here, is not whether the:U.S. Attorney for
‘the Southern. District of Florida.had the power to bind the U:S. Attorney for the Southern District
of New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA. did'so. Applying Second Circuit

Annabi, panels of the Secorid, Circuit have stated that courts cannotinferintent to depart from,
‘this Ordinary: practice from am agrecinent’s use of phrases like “the government” or “the United.
States.” Unused States v. Sdldmeh, 152 F.3d 88, 120:(2d.Cir. 1998), (per cliriam); United Srates v.
Gonzaléz; 93 F. App’ x' 268; 270 (2d Cit: 2004). Those:ate. common shorthand. A-plea,
agreement néed not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States. Attorney for Such-
anid-Suich District” ih every*instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where
signed.

Maxwell asks this Gourt:to:draw the opposite: conclusion. ‘The:provision of the NPA
dealing-with co-conspirators docs:not expressly statesthatit binds, U.S. Attorneys in other

districts. Itdoes not expressly:state that itapplies in other districts. The:relevant language, in
