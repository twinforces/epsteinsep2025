A. The non-prosecution agreement does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the
Southern District of New York

United States Attorneys speak for the United States. When a U.S. Attorney makes a
promise as part of a plea bargain, both contract principles and due process require the federal
government to fulfill it. See Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262 (1971); United States v.
Ready, 82 F.3d 551, 558 (2d Cir. 1996). The question here is not whether the U.S. Attorney for
the Southern District of Florida had the power to bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District
of New York. The question is whether the terms of the NPA did so. Applying Second Circuit
precedent and principles of contract interpretation, the Court concludes that they did not.

In United States v. Annabi, the Second Circuit held: “A plea agreement binds only the
office of the United States Attorney for the district in which the plea is entered unless it
affirmatively appears that the agreement contemplates a broader restriction.” 771 F.2d 670, 672
(2d Cir. 1985) (per curiam). This is something akin to a clear statement rule. Single-district plea
agreements are the norm. Nationwide, unlimited agreements are the rare exception. Applying
Annabi, panels of the Second Circuit have stated that courts cannot infer intent to depart from
this ordinary practice from an agreement’s use of phrases like “the government” or “the United
States.” United States v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 88, 120 (2d Cir. 1998) (per curiam); United States v.
Gonzalez, 93 F. App’x 268, 270 (2d Cir. 2004). Those are common shorthand. A plea
agreement need not painstakingly spell out “the Office of the United States Attorney for Such-
and-Such District” in every instance to make clear that it applies only in the district where
signed.

Maxwell asks this Court to draw the opposite conclusion. The provision of the NPA
dealing with co-conspirators does not expressly state that it binds U.S. Attorneys in other
districts. It does not expressly state that it applies in other districts. The relevant language, in
