04/19/2021 | 216 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: In its April 16, 2021 Opinion, the Court denied the
Defendant's motions to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment in whole or in part and
granted the Defendant’ s motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial. Dkt.
No. 207. The Court will try the non—perjury counts first. As the Court noted in its
Opinion, it has not yet resolved the Defendant's two motions to suppress evidence. See
Dkt. Nos. 133, 139. The Defendant contends in those motions that the Government
obtained by subpoena documents covered by a protective order in violation of her
rights against unreasonable searches and seizures, against self—incrimination, and to
due process of law. The motions seek, at minimum, an evidentiary hearing to
determine whether the Government knowingly misrepresented facts to procure an
order modifying the protective order. The Court requires information from the
Government for scheduling purposes. The Government is ORDERED to inform the
Court by letter docketed on ECF no later than April 20, 2021, whether it intends to use
any of the documents subject to the pending motions to suppress in the trial of the
non—perjury counts in this case. If the Government does not intend to use any of the
documents subject to the pending motions to suppress in the trial of the non—perjury
counts, the Court will defer consideration of those motions until it has scheduled the
trial of the perjury counts. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
