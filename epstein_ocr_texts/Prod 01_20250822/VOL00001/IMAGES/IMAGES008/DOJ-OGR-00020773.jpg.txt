Section. 3283, as amended. by-the. PROTECT Act, broadly states'that “[nJo statute. of
‘limitations that would,otherwise:preclude prosecution for an offense:involving the. sexual or
‘physical. abuse, or kidnaping, ofa. child.under'the.age of 18 years shall preclude such:prosecution
during the life of the child.” The statute lacks an express retroactivity clause, but:courts.have,
held, that7no:such clausesis necessary, including for this:particularstatute. See.Leo Sure Chief,
438 F.3d at923. The statute’s plain language: unambiguously requires that it apply-to
‘prosecutions for-offenses committed before:the date. of enactment. Instead of simply-providing a
new. limitations period. for-future conduct, Congress stated that.no statute. of limitations ‘that
‘would otherwise preclude prosecution. of these. offenses will apply. Thats, it:prevents the
application of any’statute: of limitations that would:otherwise:apply to past conduct.

‘Courts have reached ‘the same conclusion for other statutes employing similar ‘language.
The Eighth Cireuit has held that the 1994 amendments:to § 3283,’which allowed prosecution. of
sex.crimes against children until the victim:reached age twenty-five, applied to past conduct. See
United States v. Jeffries, 405 F.3d 682, 684-85 (8th Gir. 2005). The Second. Circuit:has observed
that?the: Higher Edueatron Technical .Amendments' of 1.991, Pub.:L."No. 102-26, 105 Stat. 123,
‘illustrates language: that requires a statutes application to past:conduct. See./nter. Mortg.
Acceptance Co., LLG, Sec. Litig., 39.1 F.3dvat 407. That statute climinated.the statute: of
‘limitations for claims on defaulted student loans by. stating: that’*no limitation shall terminate the
‘period. within which suit may: be filed.” Jd. The.PROTECT Act’s language is quite similar.
as broadly as the' Constitution allows. With each successive amendment to:the statute, Congress
further ‘extended the Jimitations‘period, recognizing, that sex,crimes against children “may, be

difficult to detect quickly” because: children,often delay or decline'to report sexual abuse.
