Case 22-1426, Document 87,.07/27/2023, 3548202, Page30-of 35.

This Court has also recognized.a third 'form of partiality, known as inferable
bias, applicable in, "a few circumstances that involve no showing of actual, bias, and
that fall outside of the implied bias category, where a Court ‘may, nevertheless,
properly decide to excuse a juror." /orres, 128 F.3d at 46-47, Daugerdas, 867 F.

Supp. 2d at 475.

Bias may: be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk’ of
partiality sufficiently: significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion, to
excuse the juror for cause, but ‘not so great as. to make a presumption of bias
mandatory. /orres at 43, 47. In Torres, the Second Circuit.declined to "consider the
precise scope of a trial judge's discretion to infer bias." /d. The circumstances herein.
present a scenario in, which bias is inferred ‘from the non-disclosure of critical
potentially disqualifying information. at the time of voir dire because the. risk: of
partiality is sufficiently significant to excuse a. juror for cause based. on non-
disclosure. "Because [in such cases] the bias ofa juror will rarely be admitted by the
juror himself, partly because the juror may have an interest in concealing his own
bias or partly because the juror ‘may’ be unaware of it, [partiality] necessarily: must
be: inferred from surrounding facts and. circumstances.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at.
