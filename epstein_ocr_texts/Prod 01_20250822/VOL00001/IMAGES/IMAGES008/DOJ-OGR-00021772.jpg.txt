Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page30 of 35

This Court has also recognized a third form of partiality, known as inferable
bias, applicable in "a few circumstances that involve no showing of actual bias, and
that fall outside of the implied bias category, where a Court may, nevertheless,
properly decide to excuse a juror." Torres, 128 F.3d at 46-47, Daugerdas, 867 F.
Supp. 2d at 475.

Bias may be inferred when a juror discloses a fact that bespeaks a risk of
partiality sufficiently significant to warrant granting the trial judge discretion to
excuse the juror for cause, but not so great as to make a presumption of bias
mandatory. Torres at 43, 47. In Torres, the Second Circuit declined to "consider the
precise scope of a trial judge's discretion to infer bias." /d. The circumstances herein
present a scenario in which bias is inferred from the non-disclosure of critical
potentially disqualifying information at the time of voir dire because the risk of
partiality is sufficiently significant to excuse a juror for cause based on non-
disclosure. "Because [in such cases] the bias of a juror will rarely be admitted by the
juror himself, partly because the juror may have an interest in concealing his own
bias or partly because the juror may be unaware of it, [partiality] necessarily must
be inferred from surrounding facts and circumstances.” McDonough, 464 U.S. at
558 (Brennan, J., concurring).
