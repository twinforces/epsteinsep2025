exchange for meeting Epstein to be sexually abused,
under the pretext of giving Epstein a massage.
(Tr.1518-25, 1540-41, 1544-46). Once a girl was intro-

while Epstein asked Jane to take her top off. (Tr.307).
After this sexual interaction, Maxwell and Epstein
taught Jane how Epstein liked to be massaged and
