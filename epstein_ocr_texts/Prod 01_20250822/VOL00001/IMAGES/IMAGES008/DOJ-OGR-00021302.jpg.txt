that they. “appreciate[d]” that the defense wanted.a “fresh.face” to conduct-a review, and:noted that.

defense.” They told the: defense: team.that: Acosta had asked.CEOS to: “come on. board” and.that.
CEOS Chicf @osterbaan would. designate, an attorney. having “a national. perspective” to conduct:
a fresh review in light of the defense submissions. Oosterbaan assigned a CEOS Trial Attorney

some had.recruited other victims:to:provide:Epstein massages, and ‘thus could have been charged.
as accomplices: some had “drug histories and ... . things like that"; some-could-appear to have been,
“complicit”::and'there was no evidence of physical, violence against the victims. ‘She did. not regard
