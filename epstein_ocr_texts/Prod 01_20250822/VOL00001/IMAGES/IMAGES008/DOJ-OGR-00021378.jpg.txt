with. one: of Epstein’s defense sattorneys; about it. Sloman.told OPR. during, his; interview: that. he
“vaguely” remembered the computer issue. The docuinentaty evidence confirms that he had at:
least some contemporancous. knowledge of the ‘issue—when asked by Villafatia whether to put off.
a September 12, 2007 hearing on the litigation, he: told her to. do 8o.. Finally, as noted previously,
the: FBI co-case: agent. proposed at.a meeting with USAO personnel. that the USAO wait until the
litigation was tesolved before pursuing plea negotiations.,

‘Contemporaneous records ‘show that Acosta was: likely aware before the NPA. was signed
ofthe USAO’s efforts to obtain custody. of Epstein? S computers and that-after the NPA was signed,
he was.:informed about the use: of” legal process for obtaining the. computer equipment. The.NPA
itself provides’ that; “the federal . . investigation will be suspended, and.all. pending [legal process]
will-be held im abeyance,” that Epstein will.withdraw his “motion'to:intervene and to quash certain
[legal process],” anid, further; that the parties would “maintain... . . evidence subject: to [legal.
process] that have been issued, and inchiding certain. computer equipment, inviolate” until. the:
NPA’S térins, had beéén ‘fully satisfied, at which point the legal, process ‘would, be “deemed.
withdrawn.” (Emphasis added.): Acosta’s numerous edits on the NPA’s final.draft suggest that he:
gave it a:close'read, and.OPR expects that Acosta would :not have approved the agreement without:
understanding: what legal process his office: was agrecing to withdraw, or why.the only ‘type of,
evidence specified was “certain computer equipment:” In addition, Acosta ‘told OPR that he:
worked, closely with, Sloman-and Menchel, consulted with them, and ‘relied. on their counsel about:
the:case. Among other. things, Acosta said he discussed with them concerns about'the law and the:
evidentiary issues ‘presented by a federal criminal trial. Therefore, although it is possible that
Sloman made the decision. to postpone the hearing concerning the. USAO’s efforts: to: obtain. the:
computer equipment: without consulting Acosta, once. Acosta: reviewed the draft NPA, Acosta was
on. notice of the existence of and the ongoing litigation concerning, Epstein? S missing computer’
equipment:

Villafatia knew where the computers; were; ‘litigation, over the demand, for the equipment:
was already underway; there was good treason, to believe the computers contained. relevant—and
potentially. criticdl—information; and it was clear Epstein did not ‘want the contents of his
computers disclosed. Nothing’ in the available record reveals that the USAO benefitted from,
abandoning pursuit. cof this evidence:when. they. did, or that there was: any significant. consideration
of the: costs: and. benefits. of forgoing the litigation ‘to obtain production, of. the computers. 23
Instead, the USAO agreed to postpone and ultimately to:abandon.its efforts to: obtain evidence:that
could have significantly changed Acosta’s decision to resolve-the federal investigation with a state
guilty plea or led.to additional:significant federal charges. By agreeing to’postpone: the litigation,
the USAO gave away leverage: ‘that: ‘might have catised the:defense to Coie to an.agreementimuch
