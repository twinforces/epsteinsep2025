C. Other. Significant Factors: Are Inconsistent with a Conclusion. That. the
Subjects’ Actions Were.Motivated by Improper Influénces

‘OPR. considered additional. aspects of the Epstein, case. that were: inconsistent, with a.
suggestion that. Acosta’s decision to offer the July 31, 2007 terms was driven by corruption, a
desire to provide an. improper benefit to Epstein, or other j improper ‘influences.

would have reeciv eda sentence of probation. Menchel described:such a result:as.a.mere “slap‘on.
the wrist,” ‘with “no: jail ‘time, no felony Sex offense, no sexual offender registration, [and] in
restitution.for the.victims.” Instead of ‘acceding to: Epstein’ Ss ‘proposal, however, the USAO: devised
a resolution. of the: federal investigation. ‘that, although widely criticized. as ‘inadequate to: address
