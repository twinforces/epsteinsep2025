Following a conversation between Acosta and. Lefkowitz, ‘in which Acosta asked that the

defense clarify its: positions, on the: USAO proposals regarding, among other’things, notifications
to the victinis, Lefkowitz responded with,a. December 26, 2007 letter to Acosta, objecting again ‘to
notification of the victims. Lefkowitz ar gued that CVRA notification. was:not appropriate because:
‘the. Attorney: General Guidelities défined, “crite vietiiii” as a ‘person harmed as a result of an.
offense charged im federal district court, and Epstein. had not been charged. in. federal. court.
Nevertheless, Lefkowitz added that, despite their objection to CVRA notification, “[WJe do not
object (as we made clear in our letter last weck) that some: form of:notice be: given to the alleged.
Victins.” Lefkowitz:requested. both that the defens¢ be given an opportunity'to-review any notice
sent by the USAO, and that“any-and all notices with respect to the-alleged victims of state offenses
should ‘be sent by ‘the: State Attorney rather than [the USAO],” and he: agreed that the USAO
“should. defer to the discretion-of the. State Attorney. regarding all matters with regard ‘to those:
victims:and the state proceedings.”

Months later, in.April:2008, Epstcin’s attorneys complained ‘in a. Ictter. to Mandelker that
Sloman and Villafana coimitted professional misconduct by ‘threatening to send a “highly
improper‘and unusual “victim notification. letter’ ‘to.all” victims.

Epstein

As deéseribed in Chapter Two of this Report, from. the ‘time the NPA was signed through
the end. of June: 2008, the defense employed. ‘various measures to delay, or avoid entirely,
implementation. of the NPA. Ultimately, defense counsel’s advocacy restilted in the USAO’s
decision-to have: the federal. case reviewed afresh. .A review of the: evidence: was undertaken. first.
by USAO Criminal Chief Robert Senior and, then, briefly, by an. experienced. CEOS trial.
attorney. .A review of the case in, light of the defense challenges was then conducted. by CEOS
Chief Oosterbaan, in.consultation-with his staffiand with. Deputy Assistant Attorney General Sigal
Mandelker and. Assistant. Attorney General Alice Fisher,,and then, by the Office of the Deputy
Attorney General. Each review took.wecks and delayed Epstein’s entry‘of-his; state guilty plea.

As set. forth below, _ during. that time, Villafafia and the EBI continued Investigating and
working toward potential federal charges.
