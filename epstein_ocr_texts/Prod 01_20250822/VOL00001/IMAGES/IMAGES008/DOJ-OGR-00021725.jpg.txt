herself, with repeated opportunities both before and
during the hearing for counsel to suggest questions.
And Judge Nathan’s decision is reinforced by counsel’s
requests for “vexatious, intrusive, unjustified” subpoe-
nas (SA365), and for questions that swept well beyond
Juror 50’s ability to be an impartial juror and instead
probed deeply into “other aspects of his life” (Br.69).
As to Juror 50’s “statements to journalists,” it is not
entirely clear which statements Maxwell thinks
should have been part of the hearing. The hearing of
course covered both the substance of his sexual abuse
and the fact of his statements to journalists. (See, e.g.,
A.275 (asking whether Juror 50 understood “from your
interviews that the fact that you were abused would be
a known fact in the world.”)). It appears that, in Max-
well’s view, Judge Nathan should have inquired into
whether and how his sexual abuse affected the delib-
erations in the jury room. (Br.71 (suggesting that Ju-
ror 50 “operate[d] as an unsworn expert on the subject
of traumatic memory”)). Acknowledging Rule 606(b)’s
prohibition on inquiry into jurors’ deliberations and
mental processes, Maxwell argues that the exception
for “extraneous prejudicial information [that] was im-
properly brought to the jury’s attention,” Fed. R. Evid.
606(b)(2)(A), applies here. (Br.71). But Maxwell ex-
pressly waived this argument in the District Court, ex-
plaining that she “[d]oes not seek to impeach the ver-
dict based on the content of deliberations” and “need
not inquire into the content of deliberations to estab-
lish her jury bias claim.” (Dkt.613 at 49-50). And in
any event, the exception does not apply because the
“experiences that jurors are understood to bring with
them to the jury room” are “internal matters” that do
