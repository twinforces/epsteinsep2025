Case 22-1426, Document 57_02/28/2023, 3475900, Page45 of 208

2/22/23, 1:25 PM SDNY CM/ECF NextGen Version 1.6
undermine the Courts conclusion that Ms. Maxwell and her lawyers are fully able to
prepare for trial. The Court is confident that all parties recognize the importance of this
going forward and in advance of the upcoming trial. In furtherance of this, counsel for the
Government are ORDERED to confer with legal counsel for MDC to ensure that Ms.
Maxwell continues to have access to confidential attorney-client communications as she
prepares for trial. If any additional incidents arise, defense counsel shall promptly confer
with counsel for the Government regarding those incidents and seek to resolve any such
issues swiftly, responsibly, reasonably, and amicably. If that fails, the parties may write to
the Court jointly indicating their views, identifying and justifying any specific application
being made. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 5/3/2021) (ap) (Entered: 05/03/2021)

05/03/2021 266 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court concludes that the interests of justice justify
granting a short continuance. The Court deems an adjournment until fall 2021 to be
reasonable. Such an adjournment would plainly give the defense team sufficient time to
prepare for trial in light of the additional charges contained in the S2 indictment while
also ensuring that the trial proceeds without undue delay. No additional delay is necessary
or in the interests of justice. The parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer and by
May 10, 2021, they shall jointly propose a trial start date for the Court to request of the
Clerk's Office (as is required by COVID protocols). The Court urges counsel to agree to
the earliest possible date this fall and to seek adjustments to other schedules in order to
facilitate an early fall trial start date. The parties shall also discuss and propose any
adjustments necessary to the pre-trial schedule in place. Dkt. No. 250. The Government
may move in the letter for any requested exclusion of time under the Speedy Trial Act.

05/03/2021 267 | JOINT LETTER by Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from Jeffrey
S. Pagliuca dated May 3, 2021 re: defense witness disclosures, Dkt. No. 250 (Pagliuca,
Jeffrey) (Entered: 05/03/2021)

05/04/2021 268 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 30, 2021, defense counsel requested that the
Court issue an order directing the MDC to accept two hard drives from defense counsel
that contain the non-Highly Confidential discovery in this case for Ms. Maxwell's use.
Dkt. No. 260. On May 4, 2021, the Court received the attached email from MDC legal
counsel indicating that MDC does not oppose the defense's request and that MDC staff
will coordinate with defense counsel so that Ms. Maxwell can receive the hard drives. In
light of this, defense counsel's April 30, 2021 request appears moot. Defense counsel
shall raise any further issues regarding their request within two weeks of this order.
