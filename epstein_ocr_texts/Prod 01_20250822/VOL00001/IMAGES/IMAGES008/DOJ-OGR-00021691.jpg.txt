3. Retroactivity under Landgraf

In Landgraf v.. USI Film Products,.511 U.S. 244.
(1994), the Supreme Court: sét forth .a two-part framé-
work for determining whether a statute may be ap-
plied retroactively. At the first step, “if Congress ex-
pressly prescribed that a statute applies retroactively
enforces the statute as it is written, save for constitu-
tional. concerns.” Weingarten, 865 F.3d at 54-55. If,
however, the “statute is ambiguous or contains no ex-
press command regarding, retroactivity,” then the
court must turn to the second step, where “a reviewing
court must determine whether applying, the statute to
antecedent conduct: would create presumptively im-
permissible retroactive effects.” Id. at 55. “If it would,
then the. court shall not:apply the statute retroactively
absent, clear congressional intent, to the contrary.” Id.
“If it'would not, ‘then'the court shall apply the statute.
to antecedent. conduct.” Jd.
