The same principles apply to the statute of limitations at issue here. (See Gov.
Br. 42-49). That statute covers an “offense involving the sexual or physical abuse...
of a child,” 18 U.S.C. § 3283 (2003), which similarly “suggests factual details sur-
rounding the charged conduct” and lacks language like “has as an element.” And it
is also part of a statute intended to afford broader protections for minor victims of
crimes. See, e.g., Weingarten v. United States, 865 F.3d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 2017).
