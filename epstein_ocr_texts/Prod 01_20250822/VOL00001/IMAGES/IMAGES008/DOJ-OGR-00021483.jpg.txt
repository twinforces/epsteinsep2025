Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 307 of 348
Villafafia informed Edwards about the state plea, but did not mention the NPA or the fact that the
state pleas would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition and
learned about the NPA signed months earlier and that the federal investigation of Epstein had
concluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge
permitted it in August 2008 pursuant to a protective order. After considering this series of
interactions, it is not surprising that Wild came away from the experience feeling confused and
believing she had been misled.

OPR did not find evidence supporting a conclusion that Villafafia, Acosta, Sloman,
Menchel, or Lourie opted not to consult with the victims in order to protect Epstein or shield the
NPA from public scrutiny. Although neither Sloman nor Acosta could recall a specific discussion
of CVRA obligations before the NPA was signed, both recalled knowing that victim consultation
was not required, and Menchel also told OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up to
the point when he left the USAO. The evidence is clear that Villafafia sought at various points to
consult with and to notify victims about the details of the NPA but was constrained before the
NPA was signed by managers who either made a decision to not consult victims or did not address
the issue after it was raised, and after the signing by her own concern about creating possible
impeachment evidence that would damage the victims’ credibility at a possible trial.

Nonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before and
after the signing of the NPA, would have been the better practice. Before the NPA was signed,
victims could have been asked for their views about the general terms the USAO was
contemplating offering, including that a plea to state charges was one of the options being
considered; asked for their views in general about a guilty plea; or, at a minimum, asked to share
their views of how the case should be resolved. Even if the USAO ultimately determined to
proceed with the NPA, the government would have had the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and
concerns, particularly on the issue of punishment, and victims would have felt included in the
process. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation were discussed or
considered before the NPA was signed.

After the NPA was signed, no one from the government explained the agreement to the
majority of the victims until months later and only after the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea.
Although the evidence supports Villafafia’s assertion that she acted from a good faith belief that
Epstein might breach the NPA and a potential trial would be harmed if information about the NPA
was divulged to the victims and their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed to consider how the
desire to shield the victims from that potential impeachment might impact the victims’ sense of
the openness and fairness of the process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed
she had been “mistreated in the process.” When deciding not to inform the victims of the NPA to
avoid creating impeachment evidence, Villafafia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have
carefully considered possible alternatives to, or all of the ramifications of, that decision, nor did
they revisit the decision before Villafafia met the victims in person to discuss a potential trial or
spoke to Edwards or other attorneys representing victims.**° Furthermore, more attention needed
a6 It is not at all clear whether a court would have permitted impeachment of the victims concerning one
provision in a plea agreement that otherwise could not be used as evidence. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(f) (“The
admissibility or inadmissibility of a plea, a plea discussion, and any related statement is governed by Federal Rule of
Evidence 410.”). In any case, the victims could have been impeached regarding the possibility of their obtaining
monetary damages through either a civil suit or through 18 U.S.C. § 2255 Gf Epstein were convicted after a trial),
