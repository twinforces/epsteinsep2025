Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 307 of 348

Villafana informed Edwards:about the state:plea, but did.not mention the:NPA-or‘the fact that the
state pleas. would resolve the federal investigation. Edwards then filed the CVRA petition. and
jearned. about the NPA. signed months earlier. and that the federal. investigation of Epstein had
concluded with Epstein’s state guilty pleas. Wild only received access to the NPA when a judge
permitted. it in August 2008: pursuant to a protective order. After considering this’ series of
interactions, it is not. surprising that Wild came away from ‘the experience fecling confused. and.
believing she: had. been-misled.

OPR did not find evidence supporting a, conclusion ‘that. Villafana, Acosta, Sloman,
Menchel, or Lourie opted. not to consult with the:victims: in orderto protect Epstein or shield the.
NPA from, ‘public scrutiny: Although neither Sloiian nor Acosta could:recall a, Specific discussion.
of CVRA obligations before the NPA-‘was signed,, both recalled knowing that victim consultation.
was not required, and Merichel also told:‘OPR that consultation was not required, at least not up'to
the’point when-he left:the USAO. The evidence: is'clear that. Villafana sought. at various points:to.
consult with and to notify ‘victiins abotit- the details of the NPA. but was constraifed before the
NPA was signed by. managers who either made a decision to not-consult victims or did-not address
the: issue after it was raised, and after the: signing: by, her own concern. about. creating. possible
impeachment evidence that would. damage: the victims’ credibility at-a possible trial.

Nonetheless, a more open and straightforward approach with the victims, both before: and.
after the signing of the NPA, would have been the ‘better practice. Before the NPA was signed,
victims could, have ‘been asked for their views about ‘the general terms the USAO was
arte aene offering, Including that a plea to state charges \ was: one: of the: options being,
their views ‘of how the: case: » should be resolved. Even if the USAO. ultimately determined ‘to
proceed with, the NPA, the government would have had, the benefit of the victims’ thoughts and.
concerns, particularly on, the issue: of, punishment, and victims would have felt. included in the.
process. OPR found no evidence that the benefits of victim consultation. were discussed or
considered before the NPA was signed.

After the NPA was signed, no one from the government explainéd ‘the agreement. to the:
majority of ‘the victims ‘until ‘months later and .only after the: entry of Epstcin’s guilty plea.
Although the evidence suippoits, Villafana’s assertion that she, acted. froim a good. faith belief that:
Epstein:‘might breach the NPA ‘and a’potential trial would be.harmed iftinformation. about the NPA.
was ‘divulged:tothe victims and-their counsel, she, Sloman, and Acosta failed.to consider, how. the:
desire to shield the. victims fromy that potential impeachment. might. impact the victims’ sense of,
theropenness;and fairness of the'process. As Wild stated during the CVRA litigation, she believed
she had beer “mistreated. in the process.” When deciding not to inform ‘the victins of the NPA‘to
avoid, creating impeachment evidence, Villafaiia, Sloman, and Acosta do not appear to have:
carefully considered possible. alternatives to, or all ofthe rainifications of, that decision, nor did
they revisit.the decision. before: Villafaita met the victims :in person to discuss a potential trial or
spoke to Edwards or otherattorieys. representing victims. ie Furthermore, More attention needed.
