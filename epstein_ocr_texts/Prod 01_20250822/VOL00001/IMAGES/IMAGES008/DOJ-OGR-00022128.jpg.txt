SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
United States of America
Deferred Prosecution Agreement
v.
19 Cr. 830 (AT)
Michael Thomas,
Defendant.
TO: MICHAEL THOMAS
On November 19, 2019, a grand jury sitting in this District returned a six-count indictment
(the “Indictment’’), which charged Michael Thomas (“you”) with committing offenses against the
United States, to wit, conspiring to knowingly defraud the United States and to knowingly make
and use a false writing or document, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, and three counts of knowingly
making and using a false writing or document, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1001. However, after a
thorough investigation, and based on the facts of this case and your personal circumstances, the
U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (“USAO-SDNY’”) has determined
that the interests of justice will best be served by deferring prosecution in this District. Upon your
acceptance of responsibility for your behavior and by your signature on this deferred prosecution
agreement (the “Agreement’”’), prosecution will be deferred during the term of your behavior and
satisfactory compliance with the terms of this Agreement for the period of six months from the
date of this Agreement.
The terms and conditions constituting your good behavior and satisfactory compliance are
as follows:

(1) You shall refrain from violating any federal, state, or local law. You shall immediately
contact your U.S. Pretrial Services Officer if arrested or questioned by a law-
enforcement officer.

(2) You shall associate only with law-abiding persons.

(3) You shall work regularly at a lawful occupation, regularly attend school, and/or support
or care for your legal dependents, if any, to the best of your ability, as approved by your
US. Pretrial Services Officer. You shall notify your supervising U.S. Pretrial Services
Officer prior to any work or school changes.

(4) You shall not leave the contiguous United States without permission of your
supervising U.S. Pretrial Services Officer. In accordance with this condition, the U.S.
Pretrial Services Office shall return your passport upon the Court’s entering this
Agreement, and shall do so indefinitely unless this Agreement is violated.
