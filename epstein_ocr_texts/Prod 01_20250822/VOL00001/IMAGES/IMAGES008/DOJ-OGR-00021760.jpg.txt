Case 22-1426, Document 87, 07/27/2023, 3548202, Page18 of 35

NPA’s ambiguous provisions against the Government, which drafted the agreement
and enjoys unequal bargaining power in the sentencing process. See United States v.
Aleman, 286 F.3d 86, 89 (2d Cir. 2002); United States v. Ready, 82 F.3d 551, 558-
59 (2d Cir. 1996); See also Difeaux at 728. In this instance, the District Court
accepted the facts proffered by the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District
of New York and relied on Annabi to preclude any further inquiry, thereby
eviscerating the exception in U.S. v Russo, supra.

Epstein performed under the NPA in response to the promise of the United
States. The Government, having received the totality of the benefit of the bargained
elements in the NPA, should be held to its terms. There is no remedy other than
enforcement of the NPA according to its terms or, should the Court determine that
such terms are ambiguous, the holding of a hearing. Should the hearing establish that
Epstein understood the co-conspirator clause to be global, while the Government
deemed its reach a mistake or the subject of regret, Epstein, now dead, cannot undo
it. The Government, having removed limiting language in the NPA, cannot restrict
the NPA in retrospect, as it had convinced the District Court.
