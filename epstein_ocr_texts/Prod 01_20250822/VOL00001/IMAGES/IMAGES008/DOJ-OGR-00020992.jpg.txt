*1 | (concluding ‘that:conspiracies:to ‘defraud the United States and.to commit-mail and-wire
fraud were the same conspiracy: as earlier conspiracy to-use or transfer false IDs). Afterall, “[a]
single:agreement to commit several crimes constitutes. one conspiracy.” United States v. Broce,
488 U.S. 563, 570-71 (1989). The,Government implicitly:conceded this:point:of law when-it
agreed that Counts One and. Three were multiplicitous. Count One, charges a conspiracy’ to’
entice minors ‘to travel across state/lines’in violation of 18 U:S:G. §,2422 while Count Three.
charges a conspiracy to transport minors across state lines in violation of 18 ULS:C. § 2423(a).
‘Despite distinct statutory predicates for these two § 371, conspiracies,;the Government:did not
contest that they were the same offense. Though Count EFiveris:unquestionably:less similar'to
Count Three than is Count One, the difference in statutory predicates does not end the matter. It
is‘well established that a single. conspiracy'can contain multiple objectives, particularly ifthe
objectives share important similarities, as they do here.. United States: v. Salameh, 152 F.3d 8&8,
148 .(2d.Gir. 1.998) (citing United:States v. Aracri, 968 F.2d..1512,,151:8 (2d Gir. 1.992)).

Overlap of participanis. Theparticipants in the two conspiracies in Counts Three and
‘Five substantially overlap with.one another. Ofcourse, the defendant-will always overlap
between. two allegedly ‘multiplicitous conspiracies, so their. participation in-both conspiracies has
negligiblesignificance. Filla,.2014 WL 2520113, at:*5. More importantly‘here, Epstein was the:
-Defendant’s ‘primary coconspirator in.both conspiracies, and the Government argued. that in both
conspiracies the Defendant played the:same role: of acquiring underage girls. for-Epstcin to
