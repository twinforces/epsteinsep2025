2. Statutes of Limitations for Offenses
Against Children (18 U.S.C. § 3283) and
Child Abduction and Sex Offenses (18
U.S.C. § 3299)

Most federal noncapital offenses carry a five-year
statute of limitations. See 18 U.S.C. § 3282(a). In 1990,
Congress enacted a provision titled, “Extension of
Child Statute of Limitations,” which provided that
“Injo statute of limitation that would otherwise pre-
clude prosecution for an offense involving the sexual
or physical abuse of a child under the age of 18 years
shall preclude such a prosecution before the child
reaches the age of 25 years.” Crime Control Act of
1990, Pub. L. No. 101-647, tit. II, § 225(a), 104 Stat.
4789, 4798 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3509(k) (1990)).
This provision “extended the federal criminal limita-
tions period for child sex abuse offenses, making it eas-
ier to prosecute offenders who commit sex crimes that
may be difficult to detect quickly.” Weingarten v.
United States, 865 F.3d 48, 54 (2d Cir. 2017). In 1994,
Congress re-codified this provision, moving it to 18
U.S.C. § 3283 with identical language. Violent Crime
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. No.
103-322, tit. XXXIII, § 330018(a), 108 Stat. 1796, 2149
(codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3283 (1994)).

Within a decade, “Congress began to view even the
extended statute of limitations period in the 1994 ver-
sion of § 3288 as ‘inadequate in many cases’ because it
released from criminal liability sex abusers whose
crimes were not brought to the attention of federal au-
thorities until after their victims turned twenty-five.”
