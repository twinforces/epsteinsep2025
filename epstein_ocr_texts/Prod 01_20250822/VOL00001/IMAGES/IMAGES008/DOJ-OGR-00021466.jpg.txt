continuing.” The co-case:agent also told OPR.that, as ‘of:the time of His OPR ‘interview. in 2019,
the “the-case was open. -.... it’s: ever been shut down.”

‘OPR found.no evidence:that:the EBI’s:victim letters: were drafted with'the intent-to:mislead,
the: victims about. the status ef the federal. investigation. The “ongoing investigation” language.

to that contained. it standard, form notification, letters the FBI generated: and. distributed from,
August 2006 through the 2007 signing, of the NPA.*!* Nevertheless, the FBI’s letters omitted.
important: information about the status of the case because they: failed io notify ‘the victims that-a.
federal. prosecution would. ‘go forward only if Epstein. failed to fulfill ‘his obligations: under. an
agreement. he. had reached. with the. USAO. Victims. receiving the. FBI’s. letter would logically
conclude that the federal government was continuing to gather evidence to support. a federal.
prosecution. CVRA petitioner Wild stated during the ‘CVRA litigation that-her “understanding of
this letter was that.[her] case:was still being investigated and.the EBIand prosecutors. were moving,
forward. on the Federal prosecution of Epstein for his crimes against” her. Furthermore, when the
fact that the USAO had. agreed to end-its federal investigation in. September 2007 eventually. came:
to light, the statement inthe subsequent letters:contributed to victims” and the:public’s conclusions
that the. government had'purposcefully kept victims in the-dark.

In, sum, OPR. concludes that ‘the statement in the FBI victiin létters that the matter was
“currently: under. investigation” was not false because the USAO and the EBI: did continue to
jfivestigate ahd prepare for a prosecution of Epstcin. The Iétters, however, risked imisleading the
victims, and ‘contributed to victim frustration: ‘and ‘confusion,, because: the letters did ‘not. provide:
important information that wotld have advised Victinis, of the actual status ofthe, ifivestigation.
Nonetheless, OPR found. no evidence: that Villafafia or her supervisors participated ‘in, drafting
those: letters or-were aware of the content of the FBI’s letters:until the Department; gathered:them
for ‘production, in the: CVRA litigation, The use of FBI form letters that ‘gave incomplete
‘information. about‘the status of the investigation demonstrated a lack of coordination: between the
federal agencies responsible: for communicating with Epstein’ 's victims and showed a, lack, of
attention. to: and oversight regarding ‘communication, with victims. ‘Despite the fact that:the case:
‘was no longer-on the typical path for resolving federal iriv estigations; form letters continued to be
sent without any review by prosecutors or. the: case agents to: determine whether the ‘information
provided to'the victims was appropriate under the cifcumstances. ae
