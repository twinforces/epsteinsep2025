not nt recall for OPR. the substance of his conversation, with Starr, other than that it-was likely:about:

‘On.November.28, 2007, Starr requested, by letter, a:mecting with Fisher. In his letter, Starr
argued ‘that the USAO improperly . had compelled. Epstein. to agree: to ‘pay civil damages under
18 U.S.C. § 2255 as part.of'a state-based resolution of a.criminal:case. On the same day, Lefkowitz
emailed, Sloman, complaining about the USAO’s plan.to notify victims about the § 2255: provision.
and alerting Sloman, that Epstein’s counsel were ‘seeking a meeting with the Assistant Attorney
General “to address what we belicye is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component”
of the NPA. After Lourie sent. to Sloman. a copy of the Starr letter, Sloman..forwarded. it to
Villafana, asking her'to:prepare a- chronology of theplea negotiations and how the § 2255-provision.
evolved. Villafana: responded that she was‘ ‘going through all of the ways in.which'they have tried
to breach the agreement to convince you guys to, let me indict.”

In. Washington, D.€., Lourie: consulted with CEOS ‘Chief Oosterbaan, asking for his
thoughts on, defense counsel’s arguments. At. the same time, at Lourice’s request, Villafafa. sent
the: NPA and.its addendum to:Lourie and Oosterbaan. Oosterbaan. responded to: Lourie that:he was

“not thrilled” about.the NPA: described Epstein’ s conduct. as unusually “egregious,” ” particularly
because.of.its serial-nature; and observ. ed that the’ NPA. was" “pretty: adv antagcous' for the defendant
and not, all that helpful. to the victims.” He opined, however, that the Assistant Attorney General,
would not and.should not consider.or address the.NPA “* ‘other than.to say. that she agrees with it.”
During her OPR. ifiterwiew, Fisher did not recall reading Statr’s letter or discussing: it with
Oosterbaan, but believed. the comment about her “agree[ing] with. it” ‘referred to a ‘federal.
prosectition of Epsteii, Which she believed Was appropriate. She told ‘OPR, however, that she
“played.no role in” the: NPA and did not review or approve'the agreement either before: or after it.

provided a draft of the. notification. letter to Lefkowitz for comments. Om November 29,2007,
Lefkowitz sent Acosta a letter complaining aboutithe draft notification to: the victims. Lefkowitz
askedthe:'USAO to refrain from notifying the victims until.after.defense counsel-met.with Assistant
Attorney General Fisher, which he anticipated would ‘take place the ‘following week. Internal,
but both Fisher and Lourie told OPR' that. such a. meeting, never took place, and OPR, found no

Acosta promptly responded to Lefkowitz by letter, directing him to raise.his concerns about:
victim notification with Villafana or Sloman. Acosta also addressed. Epstcin’s evident efforts to
stop the NPA ‘from being enforced:

In.a short-emailto.Fishersthe:next day;-Courie reported simply: “He was;verynice. Kept:me-on ‘the: phone
‘for [a] half hour talking ‘about [P]epperdine.” refeiring’ to:the-law'school where Siarr-setved a8 Dean.
