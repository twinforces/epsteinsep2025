With regard'to her commentiabout“avoid[ing] the press,” Villafatiatold OPR that her goal.
‘was to, protect the anonymity of the victiiis: She said ‘that, the-case «was far tore likely’ to be
covered. by the Palny.Beach press, which:had already writtenzarticles about Epstein, than in-Miami,
and “if, [the victinis] warited to attend [the plea hearing], [wanted them, to. be able to, go into the
courthouse: without. their faces being ‘splashed-all-over the newspaper.”

In evaluating the emails, OPR.reviewed all the-email exchanges between Villafana, as well,
as Sloman.and Acosta, and Lefkowitz and,other defense counsel, including the:portions. redacted
from, the ‘publicly released emails (except fora few'to or from, Acosta, copies of which, OPR did
not locate: in. the USAO -records). OPR. also considered the emails::in. the broader context of
Villafana’s. overall conduct during the federal investigation of Epstein. The documentary record,
as well as witness and subject interviews, establishes that Villafana consistently advocated:in favor
of prosecuting Epstein and worked, for inotiths toward. that goal: She repeatedly pressed’ her’
supervisors.for permission to ‘indict Epstein and:made numerous cfforts to expand:the scope of the
ease.. She opposed mectings With the defense team, and nearly withdrew froin thé case, because
her. supervisors. agreed. to those: mectings. Villafaia objected to the decision to resolve the ‘case:
through a guilty plea in state: court, and she engaged:in.a.lengthy. and heated email exchange with
Menchel about that subject. When. she was assigned the: task of, ‘creating ‘an agreement to effect.
that resolution, Villafana fought hard during‘the ensuing:negotiations to hold the USAO’s:position
despite: defense counsel’s aggressive’ tactics.

OPR also considered statements, of het supervisors.regarding her interactions with defense
counsel. Sloman, in ‘particular, told OPR. that reports that Villafafia “was soft on.Epstein . . .
couldn’t have been further fromthe truth.” Sloman addéd that Villafana “did’her bestto implement!
the: decisions that. were made and to hold Epstein accountable.” Lourie: similarly teld OPR ‘that.
when he read the district. court’s February 2019 opinion. in, the CVR&A litigation. and ‘the: emails
from, Villafana.cited in‘that opinion, he: was “surprised'to:see how nice she was to‘them. And.she.
winds up taking it on the:chin. for'being:so nice'to them. When I know the whole:time she. was the
one’who' wanted to go after him the most.” The AUSA who assisted Villafana on. the investigation,
told -OPR “everything that [Villafafia] did... was,. as; far-as T could. tell, [ ] completely pro
prosecution.”

Because the emails in. question were;publicly disclosed withotit-eontext and without other
public narrative developed that Villafatia colluded with defense counsel. to benefit.Epstcin at the:
expense of the victims. After’ thoroughly; reviewing all of the. available evidence, OPR finds that.
narrative ‘to be inaccurate. The: USAO’s and Villafafia’s ‘interactions with the victims can be
criticized, as OPR does in several respects in this Report, but.the evidence‘is'clear that‘any missteps
Villafania may. have made in her‘interactions with victims or their. attorneys were: not:made for the:
purpose of silencing victims. Rather; the evidence shows that Villafana,in. particular, cared deeply
about. Epstein’ s‘victims. Before the NPA ‘was signed, she. raised to her supervisors the issue of
consulting with victiins, and after the NPA was signed, she drafted. letters to notify ‘victims
identified. in. the: federal investigation. of the pending state plea proceeding and. inviting them to
appear. The diaft letters led defense cotiisel to, argué to Department managemeiitithat Villafatia
and Sloman committed professional misconduct by * “threaten[ing] to. send a highly. improper and.
unusual “victinvnotification letter’ to all” of the'listed-victims. Given.the full.context.of Villafatia’s
conduct throughout her tenure on the case, OPR concludes that her-explanations for her emails are
