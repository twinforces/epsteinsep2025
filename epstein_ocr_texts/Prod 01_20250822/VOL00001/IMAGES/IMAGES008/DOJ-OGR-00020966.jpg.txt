Juror 50 “was brave enough to come forward,” to which Juror 50 responded by “thank[ing] her
for sharing her[] [story] as well.” Hearing Tr. at 43. He explained that he had “randomly seen”
Farmer’s post and “felt like [he] wanted to comment.” /d. That comment was unlikely to be
seen by Juror 50’s friends and family, he speculated, because at the time he had only “two
followers,” which “were random things,” and he did not “normally use” Twitter. Jd. The Court
concludes that Juror 50’s comment to Annie Farmer on Twitter, made in January 2022, does not
provide a basis to question his testimony that as of November 4, 2021, he did not tell many
people about his sexual abuse.

At bottom, based on Juror 50’s demeanor and consistent responses while testifying under
oath pursuant to a grant of immunity, the Court finds Juror 50 credible. His failure to attend with
diligence and care to the questions on the jury selection questionnaire is frustrating and
regrettable, but it was not motivated by intentional deception. In light of his testimony, the Court
finds that Juror 50’s answers to Questions 25, 48, and 49 were not deliberately incorrect.

B. McDonough Prong Two

Assuming without deciding that Juror 50’s inadvertently inaccurate responses satisfy the
first prong of McDonough, the Defendant has, in any event, not established that the Court would
have excused Juror 50 for cause if he had answered the questions during jury selection
accurately. See McCoy, 995 F.3d at 46. At the hearing, the Court asked Juror 50 the same set of
questions that was asked of all prospective jurors during voir dire who indicated prior personal
experience with sexual abuse. Juror 50’s credible responses to those questions under oath at the
hearing established that he would not have been struck for cause if he had provided accurate
responses to the questionnaire.
