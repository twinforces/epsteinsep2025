Thereafter, Carolyn performed over 100 paid sexu-
alized. massages for Epstein when she was between 14:
and. 18 years old. (Tr.1525). The vast majority involved.
the'same course of abuse: through. which. Epstein mas-

directed Carolyn to touch his nipples. (Tr.1545-46).

a vibrator, brought other females into the room to-en-
gage in oral sex with Carolyn, and raped Carolyn. by
penetrating her vagina with his penis. (Tr.1545-47).
