1 THE COURT: In July.
2 MR. FOY: July 20 for that trial.
3 So really it's so we can perform our functions, and of
4 course there are other things going on as far as
iy responsibilities, and that would give us sufficient time to be
6 ready. It is not an unreasonable request. To say a case that
7 started on November 19, 2019, to be tried in less than a year I
8 don't think is an unusual circumstance. I don't think anyone
9 can say it is delayed justice. My client, who is free, she is
10 not incarcerated, so we don't have any of the interests of an
11 incarcerated defendant who wants to get a speedy trial. It is
12 necessary, not an option, not just something we just feel like.
13 This isn't about us laying back, taking our time. It's about
14 doing a diligent job. In order to do that, we do need the
15 time, and I would ask that you grant the request.
16 THE COURT: How long is the Judge Ramos trial?
17 MR. FOY: The government represented that they expect
18 it to be about two weeks.
19 THE COURT: Starting on July 20 you said, yes?
20 MR. FOY: That's correct.
21 MR. FIGGINS: Your Honor, I also join in the motion.
22 The court has had a chance to read my letter with respect to
23 requesting an adjournment. It is very early for us at this
24 point even to have a full appreciation as to what's going to
25 happen in this matter. I have only had the discovery for
