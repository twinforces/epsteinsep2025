Case. 22-1426, Document 117, 11/01/2024,.3636586, Page10 of 51

while Maxwell was a beneficiary of the NPA. and had standing to enforce its terms,
the NPA.did not grant immunity to Maxwell in the SDNY. The District Court based
its. decision on Annabi. The case proceeded to trial ‘and the jury found Maxwell
guilty on, infer‘alia, Count Six.

In.2019 the Department of Justice Office of Professional, Responsibility:
investigated whether and to what extent prosecutors in the SDFL.improperly
resolved the federal investigation of Epstein in. 2007-2008 by the very NPA.at issue
here. Their investigation overlapped the prosecutions of Epstein and Maxwell in
the SDNY and.did, not involve interviewing any: defense counsel. The OPR did. not
contain a finding as'to whether the co-conspirator clause of the NPA, bound other
districts, although :it stated that “witnesses” stated that the clause provided
transactional immunity and “found. no policy prohibiting a U.S. Attorney from

declining to prosecute third parties or providing transactional immunity.” SA165.

PANEL DECISION
On appeal, Maxwell argued, infer alia, that the NPA barred.her prosecution. in the
SDNY by its express language. That language read
In.consideration of Epstein’s agreement to plead guilty and to provide

compensation in the manner described above, if Epstein. successfully
fulfills all the terms and conditions of this agreement, the United. States

that its review “didnot include scarch.terms, relevant;to the NPA, ‘and the Government has. not
searched, [the SDFL-prosecutor’s] inbox for communications relating to the NPA.”
