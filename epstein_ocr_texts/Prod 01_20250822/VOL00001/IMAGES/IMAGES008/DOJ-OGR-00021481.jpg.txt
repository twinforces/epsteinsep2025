and ‘they often.:cannot fully. reveal cither the facts or the’ status, of :an investigation, even with,
Victims. The 2005 Guidélines advise that.in consulting with a victim, prosecutors may be limited
in their disclosures: “Because victims: are not clients, may become: ‘adverse to the Government,
and:inay disclose whatever'they have learned from.consulting with prosecutors, such consultations
may be limited to gathering, information from victims and conveying only ‘nonsensitive data and.
public information.’*%

Villafatia’s concern about generating potential impeachment evidence: ‘by informing,
victins of their potential to recover monetary damages from Epstein was not ‘unreasonable.
Indeed, the case agents initially: raised the impeachment i issue, and after considering the. problem,
Villafana agreed ‘with the agents’ concerns. Villafana taised those concerns. with the: ‘USAO’s
Professional. Responsibility. Officer in. October 2007 after the agents brought the issue to: her
attention, and she ultimately raised. the issue with Sloman and Acosta as well, neither of whom.
advised her that. those concerns were improper. or unsound. OPR also considered that although.
Villafana had sovght. to notify the victims in writing of the NPA soon after it was Signed, her
supervisor, the U.S. Attorney, had decided-otherwise. When. authorized to inforny Edwards of the.
scheduled.change of plea hearing, she did so. Although she did not inform Edwards that theplea.
was part-of a global_resolution that wouldend the federal. investigation, the evidence does not show
that Villafana acted for-the purpose of deceiving Edwards or:preventing; him ‘from attending. the:
hearing. ‘Had.she sought to exelude him from the state proceedings, she could have elected notte
‘inform Edwards at all, or she could. have discouraged him :from attending the: state proceedings.
Rather, as Edwards confirmed, Villafana‘told him/the hearing was “important.” Villafafia sought:
to strike a difficult: balance of: ‘securing Edwards’s (and his clients’) attendance at the state court
plea, while obeying’ her managements’ directive. that inforining victims. of the resolution of the
federal.inv estigation should not be done until completion. of the state plea.

Therefore, after carefully considering all of the circumstances, OPR. concludes that. the:
evidence. does not establish. that Villafaiia violated her obligations-under ERPC: 4-4. or 4-8.4(c)
or (d).° ih. Nonetheless, as discussed. below, Villafafia’s interactions ‘with victims and, victiins’
attorneys without informing them | of the ‘NPA and the _ Potential conclusion of ‘the: federal

a8 2005 Guidelines; Art. IV, 9B:2.c(!). As noted, some victims-continued.to express ‘favorable views of Epstein.
diiring intervighs With the 2 government and they: or theif dtlormeys, could have provided | Information.to Epstein. about
‘the govemment*s communications. For example; within a day of Villatana, contacting: a-victim’s: attorney about: a.
potential victiin notification letter, Starr Complained to Acosta ‘that the x6Verament had recently: inappropriately:
provided “oral notification of the victim notification letter” to one girl's ‘attorney even thoughit:was clear from the:
vitl’s-récorded FBI interview: that she “did nottin any matiner view: herself'as ‘a-vietiny.”
