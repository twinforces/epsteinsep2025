8 many of the young women who were masseuses would be
9 invited to the party, as guests or his entertainment?

11 his house when he would have people who would be
12 there that were -- I call them -- I would -- the way
13 I would think of it and I would characterize it, were
14 his entourage. That's how I thought about it. And

21 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: A wedding?
22 TODD BLANCHE: Weddings.
23 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: With Epstein? I don't
24 think I ever went to a wedding with Epstein. I can't
25 think of a wedding that I ever went to with him.
