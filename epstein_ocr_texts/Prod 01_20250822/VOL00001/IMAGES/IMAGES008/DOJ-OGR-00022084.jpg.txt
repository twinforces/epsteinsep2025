Case 1:19-cr-00830-AT Document35 Filed 04/24/20 Page 22 of 34
56, 112 (2d Cir. 2003) (defendants were not deprived of due process by any alleged failure of U.S.
government to help them obtain cooperation from foreign authorities).

In considering whether Rule 16 and Brady apply to records in the possession of another
government agency, a prosecutor’s duty extends to reviewing such evidence only where the
Government conducts a “joint investigation” with that agency or branch of government. See
United States v. Rigas, 583 F.3d 108 (2d Cir. 2009) (affirming district court opinion holding that
there was “no joint investigation with the [Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)]” and
therefore the Government did not need to produce documents in the custody of the SEC); United
States v. Blaszezak, 308 F. Supp. 3d 736, 742-43 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (holding that the Government
was not obligated to review SEC material for Brady where SEC was not involved in grand jury
presentation, did not attend every interview, did not review documents gathered only by
prosecution, and did not develop prosecutorial strategy); United States v. Middendorf, No. 18 Cr.
36 (JPO), 2018 WL 3956494, at *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 17, 2018) (holding that the Government was
not required to conduct a search because the [Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(“PCAOB”)] was not involved in witness interviews or developing prosecutorial strategy, and the
SEC was not involved in the grand jury presentation, reviewing the fruits of the Government’s
investigation, or developing prosecutorial strategy); United States v. Collins, 409 F. Supp. 3d 228,
241-42 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (no joint investigation between Government and SEC); United States v.
Finnerty, 411 F. Supp. 2d 428, 433 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (Chin, J.) (no joint investigation between
Government and New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”)); United States v. Upton, 856 F. Supp.
727, 749-50 (E.D.N.Y. 1994) (holding that USAO and Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”)
did not conduct a “joint investigation” even though the FAA provided two inspectors to assist the
criminal investigation).
