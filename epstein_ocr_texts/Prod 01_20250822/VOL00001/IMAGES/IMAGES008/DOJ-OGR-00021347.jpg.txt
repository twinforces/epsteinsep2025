d[id]n?t want to: have to relive what:happened to them.”?!” The co-case agent-told OPR. that one:
of the “strategies” for dealing’ with. the victims’ fear was “to keep them off the stand,” and he
generally: remembered discussions about resolving the Epstein. case: in‘a way: that protected. the.
victims” identities. In addition, the CEOS Trial Attorney whe briefly worked with Villafana on.
the: case after the NPA ‘was signed. told OPR that. in. her meetings with ‘some of the victims, she:
‘formed the impression that they Were fot interested in the prosecution going forward. The CEOS
Trial Attorney told OPR that. “[the victims] would have testified,” but would. have required an.
extensive amount of “victim management” because they ‘were “deeply. embarrassed” about:
potentially being labeled as pr ostifutes, The CEOS Trial. Attorney: also told -OPR, that, “there were.
obvious:weaknesses in,the case,” from.an evidentiary, perspective.”

The. contemporancous: records also reflect ‘discussions: of, or references to,, various legal
and factual issues or other concems about-the case. For example, in an early email to Menchel,
Louric: noted that two key issues. raised‘by Villafatia’s:proposed charges were whether the: USAO
could prove that Epstein traveled for the. purpose of engaging in sex acts, ahd the facti that some:
minor victims. had.told Epstein. they were 18. ‘He later.opined.to Acosta and:Menchel. that “there
is some risk on some:of the statutes: [proposed in Villafana’s prosecution memorandum] as*this is:
uncharted territory to some:degree.” In-his July 5,:2007 email'to Villafana, Menchel cited. Acosta’s
and Sloman’s “concerns about taking;this case because. of, [the P]etit policy:and a number of legal.
issues” and. Acosta’s concerns about “hurting Project Safe Childhood.” Defense’ counsel raised.
myriad:legal and.factual challenges intheir voluminous.letters:to the USAO. Defense‘submissions
attacked the legal theorics for a federal ‘prosecution. and detailed factors ‘that, could have
undermined victims’ credibility, including victim statements s favorable t to o Epstein and evidence of

purportedly ‘ied on Epstein about theirages.

Acosta also recalled. that although his “team” nad expressed concern about the “trial,
issues,” his own. focus ‘had been. on. “the legal side of things.” Notably, during his prior‘tenure as
the Assistant Attorney General, in charge of the Depattment’s Civil Rights Division, Acosta, had
been. involved. in ‘efforts; to address sex' trafficking. He told OPR. that one of the “background
issues” that the Civil Rights Division, addressed ‘under his leadership, atid which influenced his
view of the Epstein case,, was: the distinction between. sex trafficking. and solicitation. of
prostitution. Specifically; he was:concerned about avoiding the creation of potentially unfavorable
federal. precedent on.the’ point: of‘delincation between prostitution, ‘which was traditionally. amatter’

Of state concern, and sex trafficking; which remained a developing area of federal, interest in
2007.7!”
