€. Discussion

Judge Nathan conducted a thorough inquiry and.
determined that Juror 50’s ‘inadvertent errors,on the
jury questionnaire didnot undermine Maxwell’s right
to a fair trial. Maxwell does not: meaningfully engage.
with. Judge Nathan’s careful. opinion, instead suggest-
ing that Juror 50’s testimony at‘the hearing was “pa-
tently absurd.” (Br.63). These conclusory arguments
fall far short of establishing that Judge Nathan abused
her discretion in finding that'this case does:not present
the extraordinary circumstances that justify overturn-
ing.a jury's verdict based on an error during voir dire.

Maxwell’s claim fails at the first step of
McDonough because Juror 50's, errors were inadvert-
ent. Juror 50 testified. as much at the hearing, provid-
ing a detailed narrative of why his errors were a fail-
ure of diligence as he rushed through. the question-
naire while distracted. (A.333-34). Judge Nathan cred-
ited this explanation in light of his demeanor, which
she “closely observe[d]” as. he testified, including dur-
ing. his answers to questions “he appeared not to’ ex-
pect.” (A.333). She explained that: his answers: were
“logical explanations and generally internally con-
sistent,’ given in a “calm. and straightforward man-
ner:” (/d.). Juror 50’s explanations were consistent.
with “his sworn,statements months earlier.at oral voir
dire” and his testimony that “his sexual:abuse history
was not ‘salient or [a] front-of mind consideration.”
(Id.). Judge Nathan also noted that Juror 50’s answers
aligned with his incentives: by testifying under.a grant:
of immunity, he could not, be prosecuted for his: false
answers on the questionnaire, but he could be.
