Defendants.
ANALISA TORRES, District Judge:

This Order is entered, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(f) and the Due
Process Protections Act, Pub. L. No 116-182, 134 Stat. 894 (Oct. 21, 2020), to confirm the
Government’s disclosure obligations under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and its progeny,
and to summarize the possible consequences of violating those obligations.

The Government must disclose to the defense all information “favorable to an accused” that is
“material either to guilt or to punishment” and that is known to the Government. /d. at 87. This
obligation applies regardless of whether the defendant requests this information or whether the
information would itself constitute admissible evidence. The Government shall disclose such
information to the defense promptly after its existence becomes known to the Government so that the
defense may make effective use of the information in the preparation of its case.

As part of these obligations, the Government must disclose any information that can be used
to impeach the trial testimony of a Government witness within the meaning of Giglio v. United
States, 405 U.S. 150 (1972), and its progeny. Such information must be disclosed sufficiently in
advance of trial in order for the defendant to make effective use of it at trial or at such other time as
the Court may order.'

' This Order does not purport to set forth an exhaustive list of the Government’s disclosure
obligations.
