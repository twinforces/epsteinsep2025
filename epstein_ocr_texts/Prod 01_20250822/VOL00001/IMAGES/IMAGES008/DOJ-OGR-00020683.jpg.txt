reconsideration. See Dkt. Nos. 407, 408. The Government is hereby ORDERED to

and the Court can now confirm that peremptory strikes will not be exercised until

needed for the exercise of peremptory strikes, the Court will seek to qualify
approximately 50 to 60 prospective jurors to return on November 29 for the exercise of
peremptory strikes. If counsel for either side learns of any additional information that
would be a basis for a strike for cause prior to November 29, they shall immediately raise
the issue with the Court. Bearing in mind this information, the Government is ORDERED
to respond to Defendant's motion for reconsideration, Dkt. No. 407, on or before
November 4, 2021. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 11/3/2021)
