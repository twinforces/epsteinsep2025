he indicated that he could decide the case “based solely
on the evidence or lack of evidence presented in Court,
and not on the basis of conjecture, suspicion, bias, sym-
pathy, or prejudice.” (A.295). He also accepted the
principle that the law provides that a defendant in a
criminal case is presumed innocent and the Govern-
ment is required to prove guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt. (A.294). Juror 50 indicated that there was noth-
ing about the nature of the case and the accusations as
summarized in the questionnaire that might make it
difficult for him to be fair and impartial. (A.308; see
also A.310). He repeated these assurances at oral voir
dire. (See Voir Dire Tr.128-34).

Juror 50 checked the “no” box in response to Ques-
tion 48, which asked whether he or a friend or family
member had ever been the victim of sexual harass-
ment, sexual abuse, or sexual assault. (A.310). He also
checked the “no” box in response to the question of
whether he or any of his relatives or close friends had
ever been a victim of a crime. (A.299).

Juror 50 was seated. Following the verdict, he dis-
cussed his experience as a juror during interviews with
multiple journalists. During these interviews, Juror 50
stated that he was a survivor of childhood sexual
abuse, which he did not disclose until high school, and
that his experience of sexual abuse did not affect his
ability to view Maxwell as innocent until proven
guilty. (A.249). He also stated that he did not recall the
details of the juror questionnaire, which he “flew
through,” but he believed he answered the questions
honestly. (A.245, 262).
