Thomas’s cfforts ‘to, garncr sympathy, put. the Government on trial, and. deflect blame for:
his own criminal actions: plainly sound in nullification. See Reese,,933 F. Supp. 2d. at 583-84;
Levin, 2016 WL 2990831, at *12. Evidence on those points does not relate to whether the
defendant committed, the crimes charged, but rather is intended. to, elicit sympathy, compassion, or
compromise: from the: jury. The records Thomas. secks are no more discoverable than the
nullification evidence precluded. in-Armstrong and. its progeny. See Armstrong, 51,7 U.S. at-462-
63 (defendant not entitled to discovery on, race of other narcotics defendants ‘to aid. in, selective
prosccution claim); United States v, Delacruz,'No. 14 Cr. 815 (KBF), 2015 WL 2211943, at *4

relating to: the Government’s ‘use of sting operations”); United States v. Floyd, No..99 Cr..0234
(DAB), 1999 WL 476438, at *2 (S:‘D.N:Y. July 7, 1999) (rejecting discovery ‘request for
“background data, records and investigative reports” of the New York City Police: Department.
(“NYPD”) as ‘well as information about NYPD officers’ conduct in. other cases); Defreitas, 201.1
WE 31,7964, at;*10 (rejecting discovery demands related ’to a.“‘factual. impossibility” defense’to a.
conspiracy charge). ‘It is the Court’s “duty to forestall or prevent” jury nullification. Manzuito,
945 F.3d at 627 (holding:that “District.courts have:a, duty'to: forestall or prevent [jury‘nullification,
arguments] and the district.court in this.casce abdicated its duty. by:ruling that:defense counsel could
argue jury: nullification.”), see also United. States v. Rosado, 728 F.2d 89, 93 (2d Cir. 1984)
(criticizing trial. court. for inviting nullification by permitting the defendants to:mount:a. “political.
défense” and stating that.it was an “crroncous assumption that good.motive for committing a crime
is inconsistent with criminal :intent”).
