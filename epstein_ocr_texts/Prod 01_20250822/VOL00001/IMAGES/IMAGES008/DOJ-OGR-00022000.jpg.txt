Accordingly, as noted above, the Government is prepared to proceed to trial as scheduled.
That said, while the Government would not object to a short adjournment of the trial date to provide
the defendants with additional time to prepare, the issues identified in the defendantsâ€™ letters do
not require a six-month adjournment.
Respectfully submitted,
GEOFFREY S. BERMAN
