Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page65 of 113.

(emphasis added). Weingarten does not move the needle because it did not purport
to decide how § 3283 should actually be construed.

The. District Court’s reliance on Nijhawan v. Holder, 557 U.S. 29 (2009), a
case interpreting 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(43)(M)(i), ‘was likewise misplaced. The
District, Court. cited Nijhawan for the proposition that “the word ‘involves’
generally means courts should look ‘to the circumstances of an, offense: as
committed ‘in. each case.” A148. But Nijhawan says. otherwise; there, the Supreme
Court reaffirmed its ‘prior case law holding ‘that statutory “language, covering
‘crime[s]’ that ‘involv/e] conduct that. presents.a serious potential risk of physical
injury to another’ ... refers to crimes as generically defined.” 557 U.S. at 36
(emphasis and brackets in. original) (quoting James v. U.S:, 550 U.S. 192, 202
(2007)).!° Indeed, the Supreme Court ‘has explicitly held that the clause, “offense
that. ... involves fraud or deceit,” as used in § 1101(a)(43)(M)(), is analyzed.
categorically, directly contrary’ to the District Court’s apparent misreading of
Nijhawan. Compare Kawashima, 565 U.S. at 483 (“employ[ing] a categorical
approach”) with A148.

This Court should decline to ‘ratify the District Court’s case-specific
approach, for an additional reason: it would conflict with. at least two other circuits
that have examined § 3283 and concluded that a'categorical. approach applies. See

!°'In Johnson v. U-S., the Supreme Court overruled James on other grounds, but.
‘expressly reaffirmed James’ categorical approach. See 576 U.S. 591, 604 (2015).
