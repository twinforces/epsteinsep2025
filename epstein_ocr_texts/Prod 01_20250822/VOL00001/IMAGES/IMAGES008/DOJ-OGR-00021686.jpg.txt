approval of each affected U.S. Attorney’s Office before
entering into any non- ‘pr osecution agreement that pur-
ports to bind. another district. See Justice Manual § 9-
27.641 (“No district or division shall make any agree-
ment; including-any agreement: not to prosecute, which
purports to bind.any other district(s) or division with-
out the approval of the United States Attorney(s) in.
each. affected district and/or the appropriate Assistant.
Attorney General.”).

Finally, Maxwell devotes much of her brief to criti;
cizing Annabi. (E.g., Br.18-23). But: this Court’s rule is
sound, .as it ensures that a criminal defendant (or:
even, as heré, a co-conspirator) ‘will not ‘receive the
windfall of immunity that, was never intended by the
parties to the original agreement, ‘while. léaving ‘par-
ties free to enter into legitimate multi-district, resolu-
tions if théy wish. Nor has Maxwell’s parade. of horri-
bles come to pass in the decades since Annabi was de-
cided. Furthermore, the same rule has long béen ap-
plied in the Seventh Circuit. See Thompson. v. United
States, 431 F. App’x: 491, 493 (7th Cir. 2011); United:
States v. Rourke, 74 F.3d 802, 807 n.5 (7th Cir. 1996).
In any event, this Court néed not engage in.a point-by-
point. analysis. of the merits of Annabi, because it re-
mains binding precedent. See United States v. Wilker-
son; 361 F.3d 717, 732 (2d Cir. 2004) (Court: is “bound
by the decisions of prior panels until such time as they
are overruled either by an en banc panel of our Court.
or by the Supreme Court”).
