CONFIDENTIAL PLEA NEGOTIATIONS
TERMS OF EPSTEIN NON-PROSECUTION AGREEMENT

a Epstein pleads guilty (not nolo contendere) to an Information filed by the
Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office charging him with:

(a) lewd and lascivious battery on a child, in violation of F1. Stat.
800.04(4):

(b) solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution, in violation of Fl.
Stat. 796.03; and

(c) engaging in sexual activity with minors at least sixteen years of age,
in violation of Fl. Stat. 794.05.

Ls Epstein and the State Attorney’s Office make a joint, binding
recommendation that Epstein serve at least two years in prison, without any
opportunity for withholding adjudication or sentencing: and without
probation or community control in lieu of imprisonment.

fo Epstein agrees to waive all challenges to the information filed by the State
and the right to appeal.

= Epstein agrees that, if any of the victims identified in the federal
investigation file suit pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 2255, Epstein will not contest
the jurisdiction of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Florida over his person and the subject matter. Epstein will not contest that
the identified victims are persons who, while minors, were victims of
violations of Title 18, United States Code, Sections(s) 2422 and/or 2423.

z After Epstein enters his state court plea and is sentenced, the FBI and the
U.S. Attorney’s Office will close their investigations.

V. THE USAO PRESENTS EPSTEIN WITH KEY TERMS OF A DEAL: PLEAD
GUILTY TO STATE CHARGES REQUIRING A TWO-YEAR TERM OF
INCARCERATION AND SEXUAL OFFENDER REGISTRATION, AND AGREE
TO A MEANS FOR THE VICTIMS TO OBTAIN MONETARY DAMAGES
Although the USAO term sheet was presented to Epstein’s defense team on July 31, 2007,

it took almost another two months to reach a final agreement in the form of the NPA. The

contemporaneous emails show that over the course of those two months, defense counsel offered
multiple counter-proposals to the USAO’s stated terms, and alternated between working out the
state plea disposition and seeking an alternative federal plea arrangement. The emails make clear
that as the negotiations intensified in September 2007, the prosecutors became increasingly
frustrated, particularly with what they perceived as the defense tactic of agreeing to terms and
provisions but then backtracking or altering the agreed-upon terms in subsequent communications.
It is apparent that the defense persistence achieved some measure of success, at least concerning
