the Sheriff’s Office that Epstein’s duties required him to work six days a week for 12 hours per
day. Finally, Villafafia pointed out that Epstein’s purported “supervisor’—who as the
Foundation’s vice president was subordinate to Epstein, the Foundation’s president—had
promised to alert the Sheriff's Office if Epstein failed to comply with his work schedule, but the
“supervisor” lived and worked in the New York metropolitan area and was unable to monitor
Epstein’s activities on a day-to-day basis. The Sheriff's Office neither acknowledged nor
responded to Villafafia’s letter.

In March 2009, Sloman met in Miami with Dershowitz for, as Dershowitz characterized it
in a subsequent email, “a relaxed drink and conversation,” which included a discussion of the
Epstein case. After that encounter, Dershowitz emailed Sloman, expressing appreciation for
Sloman’s “assurance that the feds will not interfere with how the Palm Beach sheriff administers”
Epstein’s sentence “as long as he is treated like any similarly situated inmate.” Sloman responded:

Regarding Mr. Epstein, the United States Attorney’s Office will not
interfere with how the Palm Beach Sheriff’s Office administers the
sentence imposed by the Court. That being said, this does not mean
that the USAO condones or encourages the PBSO to mitigate the
terms and conditions of his sentence. Furthermore, it does not mean
that, if contacted for our position concerning alternative custody or
in-home detention, we would not object. To be clear, if contacted
we will object. Naturally, I also expect that no one on behalf of
Mr. Epstein will use my assurance to you to affirmatively represent
to PBSO that the USAO does not object to an alternative custody or
home detention.

A week later, Dershowitz emailed Sloman again, this time expressing appreciation for
Sloman’s “willingness to call the sheriff and advise him that your office would take no position
on how he handled Epstein’s sentence,” as long as Epstein did not receive special treatment, but
adding, “[L]et’s put any call off for a while.”

Epstein’s sentence required that he be confined to his home for a 12-month period
following his release from prison. On July 22, 2009, almost 13 months after he began serving his
sentence, Epstein was released from the Stockade and placed on home confinement.!® At this
time, he registered as a sexual offender.

XI. POST-RELEASE DEVELOPMENTS

In the summer of 2009, allegations surfaced that Epstein had cooperated with the U.S.
Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York’s investigation of investment bank Bear
Stearns, and that he had been released early from his 18-month imprisonment term because of that
185 In Florida, what is commonly referred to as house arrest is actually the Community Control supervision
program. Florida Statute § 948.001(3) defines the program as “a form of intensive, supervised custody in the
community.”
