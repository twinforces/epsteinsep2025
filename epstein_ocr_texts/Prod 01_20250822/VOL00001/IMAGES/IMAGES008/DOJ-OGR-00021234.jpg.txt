On. that. same day, Villafatia emailed Lourie, Menchel, Sloman,. and her immediate: supervisor
complaining ‘that. shé: had received no reply to her query about, making changes’ to, the proposed,
indictment and. asking again. for. feedback. During. his: OPR. interview,, Lourie observed that
Villafana’s-fequest:for feedback reflected herdesire to “charge'this case soonerthan.. . . everybody’
else,” ‘but Acosta‘was still considering what strategy to pursuc. Sloman told OPR that he did. not.
know whether Villdfaia reccived any responseto her reqtiest, but he believed that at‘that: point 11.
time, Menchel‘and Lourie: were evaluating the.case to make ‘a decision. about how to proceed.

The day. before the June 26 meeting, defense counsel Lefcouit transmitted to the USAO a,
19-page letter intended to prov. ide “an.overview of our position, and the:materials we: plan. to present
in order to demonstrate that: none of the: Statutes identified by ‘you can. rightly be. applied, to: the
conduct at: issue here.” ' Reiterating their prior arguments: and themes, defense: counsel. ‘strongly
contested the appropriateness of federal inivolvemient in the matter. Ainong-otheriissues, Lefeourt’s
letter'argued:

e Voluntary. sexual. activity. involving “young adults—16 or 17 -years of age’—was
“strictly. a state concern.”

e ‘Federal. statutes were not meant to apply to:circumstances in ‘which. the defendant:
reasonably believed.that‘the person with whom. he engaged in sexual activity was
18 years of age.

o One of the chief statutes the USAO had. focused upon, 1.8 °U.S.C. § 2422(b), was
intended.to address use: of the internet to prey: upon child victims through “internet.
trolling,” but Epstein didnot use the ‘internet to lure victims..

© The “travel” statute, 18 U.S.C. § 2423(b), ‘prohibits travel “for the purpose of”
organ in allie Sexual conduct, but Epstein tr raveled to Florida, to: visit. fariily,

daily ivi ings”

Lefcourt also argued again. that “irregularities” had. tainted the state’s case and would “have a.
‘significant impact on.any federal prosecution.”>”

Lourie sent.to Menchel, with-a copy to Villafafia, an email dividing the defense: ar guments
into “weaker” and“ stronger” points. Lourie-disagreed with the argument that, I'8 U.S.C. § § 2422(b)
was limited to “internet trolling,” and described:this as “our best.charge and the: most. defensible
for federal interest.” ‘On-the other hand, Lourie believed the defense:argument.that Epstein.did not:
travel to Florida ““with the ‘purpose’” of engaging in illicit sex. with-a-minor was ‘more‘persuasive.

Lefeourt, he told-OPR..that-he.“Avouldi't take ‘issue” with Villafafa‘s claim that-he.had done So. Meénchel.also:told
OPR. that he;did not recall Villafafia-objecting:at that:point:lo providing the information(to the-defense:

Se Lefeourt claimed ‘there were: deficiencies in ‘the PBPD searcly warrant and “material misstatements. and,
OMISSIONS” if the PBPD pr obable calise affidavit. As an éxaniplé he contended that the-police-had lacked probable
cause to: search: for ‘videotapes, “since all. the women who were asked whether ‘they had been, videotaped denied
kriovwledge of any videotaping.” * (Emphasis i il Original):,
