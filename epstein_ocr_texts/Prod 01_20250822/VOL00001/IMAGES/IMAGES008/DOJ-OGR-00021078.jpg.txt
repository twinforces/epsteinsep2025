Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page31 of 113
B. Appellant may enforce the NPA as a third-party beneficiary.
Appellant is a third-party beneficiary of the NPA, and for that reason has
standing to enforce it. The District Court declined to adopt the Government’s
arguments to the contrary, and this Court should do the same. See U.S. v. Andreas,
216 F.3d 645, 663 (7th Cir. 2000)

Here, the NPA grants immunity to “any potential co-conspirators of Epstein,

USAO-SDEL, and thus did not bind other USAOs. A189-192. But in ruling that
the NPA did not mean what it said, the District Court ignored the plain text of the
NPA, unsettled the parties’ objectively reasonable expectations, and misapplied
Circuit precedent. What is more, the court abused its discretion by endorsing this
