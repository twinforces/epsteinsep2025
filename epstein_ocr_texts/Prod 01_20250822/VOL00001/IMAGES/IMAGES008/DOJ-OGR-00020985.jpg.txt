Government at trial, and on which the jury was accurately instructed. The Defendant’s contrary
claim of a constructive amendment of or variance from the Indictment rests on an implausible
and speculative interpretation of a single ambiguous jury note. In addition, the Court concludes
that the Government did not intentionally delay its prosecution and, in any event, the
