has committed to producing co-conspirator statements at least six weeks in advance of trial to
allow Maxwell to raise any objections. Maxwell will have adequate time to object to any
proffered co-conspirator testimony following the Government’s Jencks Act disclosures.

C. Witness list

As a general matter, “district courts have authority to compel pretrial disclosure of the
identity of government witnesses.” United States v. Cannone, 528 F.2d 296, 300 (2d Cir. 1975).
In deciding whether to order accelerated disclosure of a witness list, courts consider whether a
defendant has made a specific showing that disclosure is “both material to the preparation of the
defense and reasonable in light of the circumstances surrounding the case.” United States v.
Bejasa, 904 F.2d 137, 139-140 (2d Cir. 1990) (cleaned up).

Maxwell has made a particularized showing that the Government must produce a witness
list reasonably in advance of trial. The nature of the allegations in this case—decades-old
allegations spanning multiple locations—present considerable challenges for the preparation of
the defense. However, the Government’s proposed disclosure schedule—which will afford
Maxwell at least six weeks to investigate testifying witness statements—allows Maxwell
significantly more time to review disclosures than schedules adopted in most cases in this
District. See, e.g., United States v. Rueb, No. 00-CR-91 (RWS), 2001 WL 96177, at *9
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 5, 2001) (thirty days before trial); United States v. Nachamie, 91 F. Supp. 2d 565,
580 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (fourteen days before trial). In addition, on April 13, 2021, the
Government produced over 20,000 pages of interview notes, reports and other materials related
to non-testifying witnesses. After considering the circumstances, including the complexity of the
issues in this case and what the defense has already received and likely learned in the course of
discovery, the Court concludes that the Government’s proposal is generally reasonable.
