Case 22-1426, Document 59, 02/28/2023, 3475902, Page95 of 113
they found that Maxwell had some role in arranging Jane’s return flight from
New Mexico, after the sexual abuse had already taken place, they could convict
her on the substantive transportation count (Count Four), assuming that
arranging the return flight was sufficient to satisfy the second element of Count
Four. Hence, the question in the Jury Note.

Thus, it was necessary for the Court to give the jury a supplemental
instruction, as requested by the defense, to clarify the correct basis for
conviction under Count Four. The Court’s refusal to do so allowed the jury to
modify the essential elements of the charged offense and created a substantial
likelihood that Maxwell was convicted of a crime other than the one alleged in
the Indictment. D’Amelio, 683 F.3d at 419-21.

Moreover, given the substantial likelihood that the jury convicted
Maxwell on Count Four based on the New Mexico conduct, there is also a
substantial likelihood that they improperly convicted her on the related
conspiracy count (Count Three) based on the same conduct. The substantive
transportation offense charged in Count Four was the object of the conspiracy
charged in Count Three, and both conspiracy counts required an agreement to
violate New York law.
