POINT V

The Sentence Was Procedurally Reasonable
A. Applicable Law

A district court commits procedural error if, among
other things, it “makes a mistake in its Guidelines cal-
culation” or “fails adequately to explain its chosen sen-
tence.” United States v. Cavera, 550 F.3d 180, 190 (2d
Cir. 2008) (en banc). This Court reviews a district
court’s” application of the Guidelines de novo, while
factual determinations underlying a district court’s
Guidelines calculation are reviewed for clear error.”
United States v. Cramer, 777 F.3d 597, 601 (2d Cir.
2015). In explaining the sentence, a district court must
show that “it has considered the parties’ arguments
and that it has a reasoned basis for exercising its own
legal decisionmaking authority.” Cavera, 550 F.3d at
193.
B. Discussion

Maxwell argues that the District Court erred by ap-
plying a four-level leadership enhancement under
§ 3B1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines. That enhance-
ment applies when a defendant was an “organizer or
leader of a criminal activity that was ... otherwise ex-
tensive,” which must include the defendant’s leader-
ship of at least one other criminal participant.
U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1 & cmt. n.2. Maxwell contests only
whether the evidence showed that she led another
criminal participant. (Br.84-85).
