or transportation of minors to engage in illegal sex acts in violation of the Mann Act and
two counts of conspiracy to commit those offenses. It also included two counts of perjury
in connection with Maxwell's testimony in a civil deposition. Trial is set to begin on July
12, 2021. Maxwell filed twelve pretrial motions seeking to dismiss portions of the S1
superseding indictment, suppress evidence, and compel discovery. After the parties fully
briefed those motions, a grand jury returned a second (S2) superseding indictment adding
a sex trafficking count and another related conspiracy count. This Opinion resolves all of
Maxwell's currently pending pretrial motions other than those seeking to suppress
evidence, which the Court will resolve in due course. The motions, and this Opinion, deal
exclusively with the S1 superseding indictment and do not resolve any issues related to
the newly added sex trafficking charges. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies
Maxwell's motions to dismiss the S1 superseding indictment in whole or in part. It grants
her motion to sever the perjury charges for a separate trial. It denies her motion to further
expedite discovery. The Court provides a brief summary of its conclusions here and its
reasoning on the pages that follow:...[*** See this Opinion & Order ***]... Conclusion:
The Court DENIES Maxwell's motions to dismiss the indictment as barred by Epstein's
non-prosecution agreement (Dkt. No. 141), to dismiss the Mann Act counts as barred by
the statute of limitations (Dkt. No. 143), to dismiss the indictment for pre-indictment
delay (Dkt. No. 137), to dismiss the Mann Act counts for lack of specificity (Dkt. No.
123), to dismiss the perjury counts as legally untenable (Dkt. No. 135), to strike
surplusage (Dkt. No. 145), to dismiss count one or count three as multiplicitous (Dkt. No.
121), and to expedite pretrial disclosures (Dkt. No. 147). The Court GRANTS Maxwell's
motion to sever the perjury counts for a separate trial (Dkt. No. 119). The Court
ORDERS the Government to confirm within one week whether it considers any evidence
related to negotiation of the non-prosecution agreement to constitute Brady or Rule 16
material and, if so, to confirm that it has or will disclose such evidence. The Court further
ORDERS the parties to negotiate a final schedule for all pretrial disclosures that remain
outstanding, including: Brady, Giglio, and Jenks Act materials, including co-conspirator
statements; non-testifying witness statements; testifying witness statements; the identity
of victims alleged in the indictment; 404(b) material; and the Government's witness list.
The Court also requires the parties to negotiate a schedule for any additional or
supplemental motions briefing in light of the S2 indictment. The Court ORDERS a joint
proposal to be submitted by April 21, 2021. If agreement is not reached, the parties shall
submit their respective proposals. The Court further ORDERS Maxwell to show cause by
April 21, 2021 why her motion to dismiss the $1 superseding indictment under the Sixth
Amendment (Dkt. No. 125) should not be denied as moot. SO ORDERED. (Signed by
