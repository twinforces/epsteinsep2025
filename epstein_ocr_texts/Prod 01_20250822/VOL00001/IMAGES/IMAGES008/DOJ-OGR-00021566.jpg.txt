persuasive -—+ along with the other sources ano opinions we've

cited, it's persuasive authority for the fact this is a jury

@ecision, not a Cotirt determinat:von.

THE COURT: Are you leaving that, argument?

MR. EVERDELL: Yes; your Honor.

‘THE COURT: We'll do a little back-and-ferth so I have

everybooy's arguments in mind.
Go aheaa, Ms. Moe.

MS. MOE: Thank you,

Thank 'you..

your Honor.

The government is confiscent the 2CC4 ‘Manual applies in

this case. I believe we did engage with the ex post facto

issue thoroughly in our brief.

The question is whether the

factual, record at trial establishes that the offense continued

throughout, the duration of 20C4, which it. émphatically aia.

The testimony of a crime victim who testifieo at this trial

establishes that the offense conouct went past November 1,

2CC4.

THE COURT: So I think the framing of the question

here is. very important and. its technical -- this whole

aiseussion is very technical.

It seems’ to me the question is

can thé government point. to a préponaérance of thé evioence

that conspiratorial conoauct. took place in this: very small time

window, basically November ana December 2CC4.

That. 1s what! s

in issue, and thé quésStion is what thé trial reeera establishes

with respect to that two-month window.
