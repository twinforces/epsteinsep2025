to prosecute all of Epstein’s co-conspirators. These. factors are analyzed, in. the following,
discussions throughout this. Section of the Report:

As a.threshold. matter, OPR?s ‘investigation ‘of the: subjects’ decisions and actions in. the
Epstein:matter:uncoyered:no evidence of corruption such.as bribery, gratuity, or illegal political or
personal consideration. In addition, OPR examined the extensive contemporancous documentary:
record, interviewed. witnesses, and questioned ‘the subject attorneys. The evidence shows ‘three
sets of issues influenced Acosta’s decision to resolve: the case through. the NPA. The first—of.
nraitt concéin to Acosta—involved, considerations of federalisin and deference to state authori ity.
The. second arose :ffom an assessment by: Acosta’s: senior advisers—Sloman, Menchel, and
Louric—that the case caitied substantial litigation :tisks, iricluding: both witness issues. and what:
some: viewed as:a novel. application of certain. federal. statutes: to: the facts: of the Epstein. case.”
The thitd, was Acosta’s aim of obtaining a, greater tieasute of, justice for victiins of Epsteiri’s
conduct and for the: community. than.that proposed. by the state.

Although the NPA and'the process | for‘reaching it can be criticized, as OPR does, OPR did.
not find evidence supporting,a conclusion that the subjects were motivated by a desire to: benefit.
Epstein, for personal gain. or because of other improper. considerations, such as Epstein’ 's wealth,
status, or. associations. That is not to say that Epstein received no ‘benefit from his enormous
wealth. He was. able to hire fationally. known, attorneys who. ‘had - Prestige, skill, and extensive
exper ience in federal and state criminal law and in conducting: negotiations. ‘Hethad thecresources
to finahce an aggressive approach to: the case that incliided the preparation. of multiple written,
submissions. reflecting, extensive research and. analysis, as well as multiple in-person :mectings
involving several of his,attorneys;and USAO ‘personnel. He. assémbled.a.defense teain well versed.

or violent offenses. Nonetheless, while. recognizing that: Epstein’s; wealth ‘played. a:role in, the

subjects were not motivated to resolve the federal investigation to Epstein’ 's benefit by i impr oper
