‘ORDER as to Ghislaine, Maxwell: On.April 29; 2021, counsel for Ghislaitie, Maxwell
‘wrote’to the Court requesting that the Court address her. sleeping conditions; with.
particular:emphasis on, counsel's representation, unsupported. by.affidavit or other factual,
Showing, that guardsvare shining a. flashlight in Maxwell's,eyes every: 15 minutes atvnight.
‘Dkt. No. 256.-Defense ‘counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance ‘in Maxwell's. eyes Is
disrupting, her sleep, which, in, turn is impacting her ability 16 prepare for and withstand
trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the:Government to. confer with legal
counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and.to respond -to certai questions. Dkt. No. 257. In
fesponse, the Government states thatMDC. staff conduct flashlight checks ofall jtimates
as‘a-matter of course.. Dkt. No..270..As reported by: the: Government, inmates housed ’with
cell mates in the. Special Housing Unit are checked-with flashlights ev ery 30 minutes.

Inmates-housed with others :in the general population are checked multiple times:per night

‘at regular intervals. The ‘Government further: Teports that:to conduct:the: checks,
flashlights are’ pointed at the-ceiling of the cell to confiri that the inmate is present,
‘breathing, and not*in distress..As ‘the: Government explains, there are:a.number of neutral
Teasons' why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those

of otherinimatés, including: ‘that Maxwell-is housed aldiie, the natuie, of the charges, and.
the potential stress: forinmates: that :can. arisein high- profile. cases. The MDG has

determined that these factors necessitate more ‘frequent'safety and, security checks. The

Government also indicates thatthe prohibition on eye:masks is a generally applicable.

‘policy, but'that Maxwell, like other. inmates, may. use other noncontraband items to cover
her eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2021 letter asks the Court to override
BOP's determination. as. to the. frequency of appropriate:safety:and security éheck
procedures, thatrequest is denied as factually unsubstantiated-and legally unsupported.
‘Certainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols: interte
‘Maxwell's ability to: prepare: forher trial and:communicate with-her. lawyers. Defense
‘counsel's May 7, 20211 letter, Dkt. No. 272, describes, generalized grievances but makes.
