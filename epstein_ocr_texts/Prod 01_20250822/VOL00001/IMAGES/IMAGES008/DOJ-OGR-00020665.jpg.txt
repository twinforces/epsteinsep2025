MOTION addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison
Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated May 14, 2021. ENDORSEMENT:
The request for an extension of time until May 21, 2021 to respond to the Court's May 11,
2021 Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

05/14/2021 282 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: On April 29, 2021, counsel for Ghislaine Maxwell
wrote to the Court requesting that the Court address her sleeping conditions, with
particular emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by affidavit or other factual
showing, that guards are shining a flashlight in Maxwell's eyes every 15 minutes at night.
Dkt. No. 256. Defense counsel claims that the flashlight surveillance in Maxwell's eyes is
disrupting her sleep, which in turn is impacting her ability to prepare for and withstand
trial. The Court sought more information by ordering the Government to confer with legal
counsel for the Bureau of Prisons and to respond to certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In
response, the Government states that MDC staff conduct flashlight checks of all inmates
as a matter of course. Dkt. No. 270. As reported by the Government, inmates housed with
cell mates in the Special Housing Unit are checked with flashlights every 30 minutes.
Inmates housed with others in the general population are checked multiple times per night
at regular intervals. The Government further reports that to conduct the checks,
flashlights are pointed at the ceiling of the cell to confirm that the inmate is present,
breathing, and not in distress. As the Government explains, there are a number of neutral
reasons why BOP's flashlight checks of Maxwell are relatively more frequent than those
of other inmates, including that Maxwell is housed alone, the nature of the charges, and
the potential stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDC has
determined that these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The
Government also indicates that the prohibition on eye masks is a generally applicable
policy, but that Maxwell, like other inmates, may use other noncontraband items to cover
her eyes. To the extent that Maxwell's April 29, 2021 letter asks the Court to override
BOP's determination as to the frequency of appropriate safety and security check
procedures, that request is denied as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.
Certainly nothing in the record plausibly establishes that current protocols interfere with
Maxwell's ability to prepare for her trial and communicate with her lawyers. Defense
counsel's May 7, 2021 letter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized grievances but makes
