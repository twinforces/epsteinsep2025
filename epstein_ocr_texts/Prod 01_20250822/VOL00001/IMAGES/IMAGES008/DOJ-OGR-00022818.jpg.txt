2 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Well --
3 TODD BLANCHE: Like '90s, or 2000s, or

5 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I think the 2000s,

8 before he dated Elizabeth. But --
9 TODD BLANCHE: And when you say they were
10 very friendly, did they go -- did they travel
11 together?
1? GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I don't know if they
13 traveled together, I mean, Epstein didn't go out very
14 much or -- I mean, he did go out, but not -- and
15 sometimes if he did, I think he would go out and
16 maybe see Fred- -- Frederic.
17 And then there was -- I mean, he had a
18 bunch of guys that he would -- I would know that he
19 would see or meet, but he really -- I guess now -- so
20 he had new friends. I -- I don't know, but --
21 TODD BLANCHE: Okay. What other names?
22 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Okay, so Henry
23 Jarecki, who had an island near his. Henry was a
24 financier who was the guy who cornered the silver
25 market back in the day.
