perjury counts after trial of the non-perjury counts is completed. Given that and in light of
the representations in the Government's April 21, 2021 letter, see Dkt. No. 227, the Court
intends to defer resolution of the pending motions to suppress (including resolution of the
request for an evidentiary hearing) until after the trial on the non-perjury counts. If either
side objects, counsel shall state the basis for any objection by letter on or before by 5pm

04/22/2021 232 | MEMO ENDORSEMENT as to Ghislaine Maxwell on 222 LETTER by USA as to
Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J. Nathan from AUSAs Maurene Comey,
Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated April 20, 2021 re: Redactions
to Defense Reply Briefs and Exhibits. ENDORSEMENT: The Court grants the
Government's proposed redaction and sealing requests. This conclusion is guided by the
three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga,
435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Under this test, the Court must: (1) determine whether the
documents in question are "judicial documents;" (11) assess the weight of the common law
presumption of access to the materials; and (iii) balance competing considerations against
the presumption of access. Id. at 11920. The Court concludes that these are judicial
documents and that the First Amendment and common law presumptions of access attach.
In balancing competing considerations against the presumption of access, however, the
Court finds that the specific arguments the Government has put forward in this letter,
including the need to protect the privacy interests of third parties and alleged victims,
favor the narrowly tailored redactions. See United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050
(2d Cir. 1995). The Government's letter does not discuss Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6. By
April 23, 2021, the parties shall either propose redactions to Exhibit L of Reply Brief 6,
which was originally filed under seal, or they shall indicate to the Court that they seek no
redactions and file it on ECF. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on
