1 in this kind of case, which is an allegation about documents.

2 THE COURT: Understood. Thank you.

3 I have a few responses. The first is, although I

4 greatly appreciate when the parties are able to reach agreement
5 on the terms of a defendant's release, that agreement is

6 meaningful to me but it's certainly not controlling. I

7 ultimately decide how defendants should be released. And there
8 have been occasions where I've disagreed with an agreement

9 between the parties. So the fact that you and the government
10 reached agreement on certain terms, the terms that will be

11 imposed may be different than that agreement. It's simply, the
12 way that court proceeds. And the fact of the agreement - while
13 very helpful and I appreciate it, and it suggests that the

14 parties are working well together - doesn't necessarily mean

15 that those are the conditions that I'm going to impose.

16 The second thing to say with respect to the issue of
17 firearms is that it is in fact a policy. It's not a policy of
18 the U.S. Attorney's Office; it's a policy of our pretrial

19 service office, because they are going to be sending officers
20 in to enforce the terms of your client's release, and, as you
21 said yourself, the world is crazy, and they have safety
22 concerns, which isn't to say that they have specific safety
23 concerns about Ms. Noel. And, as you point out, this case is
24 not a violent case and there are not allegations that your
25 client has engaged in violence, either in connection with this
