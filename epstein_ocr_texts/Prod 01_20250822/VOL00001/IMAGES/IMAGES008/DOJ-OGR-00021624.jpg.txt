1 MS. STEIN: In more ways than one, they almost killed
2 me, but I wasn't going to let them. Overcoming what happened

3 to me became my decades-long, full-time career. In that, I

4 have been successful.

5 For the past 25 years, Ghislaine Maxwell has been free
6 to live a life of wealth and privilege that is almost

7 incomprehensible. Meanwhile, I have had virtually none of the
8 life experiences I might have had we never met. For over two

9 and a half decades, I felt like I was in prison. She has had
10 her life. It's time to have mine. She needs to be imprisoned
11 so all of her victims can finally be free.

12 Thank you, your Honor

13 THE COURT: Thank you, Ms. Stein.

14 Ms. Sternheim?

15 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you, Judge. Judge, I would like
16 to stand at the podium.

17 THE COURT: Please.

18 Let me just note again that I did have the statements
19 of the victims in the record. I thank them for making
20 statements today and thank their counsel for working with them
a1 in conformity with my order.
22 MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, I would like to address
23 the victims. I am going to try to turn around if the Court
24 permits me.
25 THE COURT: As long as I can hear you and the court
