06/25/2021 | 303 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell's motions to suppress evidence (Dkt. Nos.
133, 139) are DENIED. The Court sets out its reasoning in an opinion concurrently
filed under temporary seal to allow Maxwell and the Government the opportunity to
propose redactions. The parties may file under seal any proposed redactions to the
opinion within three days. The Court further ORDERS that the April 9, 2019
memorandum decision and order on the Government's application to modify the
protective order in Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 15—cv—7433, as well as the transcripts of
the March 26, 2019 and April 9, 2019 ex parte hearings on that application shall be
unsealed. These documents were previously filed under seal as Exhibits D, E, F, and G
to the memorandum of law in support of Maxwell's first motion to suppress (Dkt. No.
134). Within one week, the parties shall confer and file under seal any proposed
redactions to the memorandum decision, order, and transcripts. Any proposed
redactions shall be narrowly tailored and shall be supported with reference to the
Second Circuit's opinion in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d
Cir. 2006). The parties proposed redactions should not include any information that
has already been made public. SO ORDERED (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on

06/25/2021 | 304 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court grants the Defendant's request that going
forward the Government shall only file updates if there are any material changes to
Ms. Maxwell's conditions of confinement. See Dkt. No. 300 at 1. In the absence of any
other specific or supported application for relief from the Defendant, the Court will
take no further action at this time. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan

06/25/2021 | 307 | OPINION & ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. Maxwell moves to suppress evidence
obtained through a grand jury subpoena to a law firm involved in earlier civil litigation
against her. She contends that because the documents sought by the subpoena were
previously subject to a protective order, the Government obtained them in violation of
her rights against compelled self—incrimination, against unreasonable searches and
seizures, and to due process of law. For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds that the
Government did not violate Maxwell's constitutional rights when it obtained evidence
covered by a protective order in her earlier civil case. It further finds that Maxwell is
not entitled to suppression of any evidence or to an evidentiary hearing. The Court thus
DENIES Maxwell's motions to suppress (Dkt. Nos. 133, 139) (Signed by Judge Alison
J. Nathan on 6/25/21)(Gw) (Entered: 07/01/2021)

06/30/2021 | 305 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Pursuant to the Court's order of June 25, 2021 (Dkt.
No. 303), any proposed redactions to the Court's opinion on Maxwell's motions to
suppress evidence must be filed no later than today, June 30, 2021. Any proposed
redactions to the other documents ordered unsealed in that order must be filed no later
than July 2, 2021. The parties shall file a joint letter by each of these dates informing
the Court if no redactions are sought. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
Nathan on 6/30/2021) (Inl) (Entered: 06/30/2021)

Exhibits Document filed by USA. (Pomerantz, Lara) (Entered: 06/30/2021)

07/01/2021 | 308 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. No party has proposed redactions to the Court's
opinion on Maxwell's motions to suppress evidence or the documents ordered unsealed
in the Courts June 25, 2021 Order (Dkt. No. 303). Thus, the Court lifts the temporary
seal on its June 25, 2021 opinion on Maxwells motions to suppress. It also unseals the
April 9, 2019 memorandum decision and order on the Governments application to
modify the protective order in Giuffre v. Maxwell, No. 15—cv—7433, as well as the
transcripts of the March 26, 2019 and April 9, 2019 ex parte hearings on that
application, originally filed under seal as Exhibits D, E, F, and G to the memorandum
of law in support of Maxwell's first motion to suppress (Dkt. No. 134). Maxwell shall
