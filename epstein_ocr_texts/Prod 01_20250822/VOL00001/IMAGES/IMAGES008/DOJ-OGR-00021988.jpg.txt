1 the dog away. What I'm suggesting to your Honor in the least

2 restrictive manner is that we can make sure that if anyone from
i) pretrial services comes to the home, that she will secure the

4 gun away so that it's not out, since that seems to be their

5 concern.

6 She doesn't have any ill will towards the court staff
7 or anyone a part of this process. She understands what she

8 needs to do. There is no actual, credible, competent threat

9 supported by evidence to suggest that at this time her

10 constitutional right to possess her weapon should be infringed
11 at this time.

12 I suppose there could come a time where that could

13 change, but when we take it now, without an individual

14 assessment of her particulars, her background, the specific

15 circumstances of the case, then it gives the impression as if
16 the conclusion's foregone that she should be -- meaning in this
17 case -- a felon deprived of her firearm. She's not. She

18 remains innocent as we sit here today, and the fact that she's
19 here is disappointing, but we're here, so we have to deal with
20 it.
21 All I'm asking for is fair consideration in an
22 individualized way. Any concern that your Honor has about her
23 possessing a firearm, I'd welcome you to address it with me so
24 I have an opportunity to directly speak to your concerns.
25 THE COURT: I'll hear from the government.
