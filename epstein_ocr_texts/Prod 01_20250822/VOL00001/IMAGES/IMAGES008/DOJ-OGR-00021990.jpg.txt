MR, FIGGINS: Yes, your Honor.

With respect to Mr. Thonmas, last week, we askéd for a

week to get two additional cosigners. I would just ask the
Court "to Give ws another Séven days. I've submitted the
information to the U.S, Attorney's Office, but they still need
to Gonduct ‘their initerview. I just don"t want thére to be any
issues with respect to having it completed by tomorrow, sq I
would just ask the Cotirt to extend it dnother seven days with
respect to getting those signers and getting it approved.

MS. DONALESKI: We have no objection to that, your
Honor.

THE GOURT: All right. That. deadline is extendéd by a

week. And I certainly have no objection to the Middle District
of Pennsylvania being included in those areas where Ms; N6el is
permitted to travel.

Is there ahything further?

MS. DONALESKI: We'll just request a muling on our
applicatién to exclude tame, your Honor.

excluded.

Is that. without, objection?
