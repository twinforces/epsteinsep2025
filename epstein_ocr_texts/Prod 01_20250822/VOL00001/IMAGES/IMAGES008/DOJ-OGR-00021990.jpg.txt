1 Are there any further applications?
2 MR. FIGGINS: Yes, your Honor.
3 With respect to Mr. Thomas, last week, we asked for a
4 week to get two additional cosigners. I would just ask the
a Court to give us another seven days. I've submitted the
6 information to the U.S. Attorney's Office, but they still need
7 to conduct their interview. I just don't want there to be any
8 issues with respect to having it completed by tomorrow, so I
9 would just ask the Court to extend it another seven days with
10 respect to getting those signers and getting it approved.
11 MS. DONALESKI: We have no objection to that, your
12 Honor.
13 THE COURT: All right. That deadline is extended by a
14 week. And I certainly have no objection to the Middle District
15 of Pennsylvania being included in those areas where Ms. Noel is
16 permitted to travel.
17 Is there anything further?
18 MS. DONALESKI: We'll just request a ruling on our
19 application to exclude time, your Honor.
20 THE COURT: Yes. The application is granted. Time is
2l excluded.
22 Is that without objection?
23 MR. FOY: That is without objection, your Honor.
24 MR. FIGGINS: That's fine, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: Time is excluded under the Speedy Trial
