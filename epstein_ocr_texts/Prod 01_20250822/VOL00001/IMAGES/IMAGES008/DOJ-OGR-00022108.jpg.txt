Re: State of NY v Michael Thomas, et al.
Docket No.: 1:19-cr-00830
Adjournment Request
Dear Hon. Judge Torres:

As you are aware, our firm represents Defendant, Michael Thomas, in the above-
captioned matter. We are seeking an application for an adjournment of the January 4, 2021 trial
date. Due to COVID-19 and my health concerns, combined with the fact that I need more time to
complete my investigation, I am requesting that the Court adjourns the trial date to sometime in
mid spring, preferably on or about May 3, 2021.

Respectfully yours,

/s/ Montell Figgins
