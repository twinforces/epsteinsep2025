10/29/2021 | 402 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of Defendant's letter
regarding delivery of Defendant's legal mail at MDC. Dkt. No. 381. The Government
is hereby ORDERED to respond by Tuesday, November 2, 2021 at 12:00 p.m. SO
ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 10/29/2021)(bw) (Entered:

10/31/2021 | 400 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the Defendant's motion
under Federal Rule of Evidence 412, Dkt. No. 378, and the Defendant's motion in
limine to exclude under Federal Rule of Evidence 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), Dkt. No. 386. The issues raised in the two
motions overlap significantly. The Court is required under Federal Rule of Evidence
412 to conduct an in camera hearing. Fed. R. Evid. 412 ("Before admitting evidence
under this rule, the court must conduct an in camera hearing and give the victim and
parties a right to attend and be heard. Unless the court orders otherwise, the motion,
related materials, and the record of the hearing must remain under seal.). In addition,
the Court has determined it will conduct a Daubert hearing with respect to the
Defendant's motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. Because of the overlap in the
substance of the motions, the Court will conduct the two proceedings back to back.
The Court previously set a tentative date for the Rule 412 Motion hearing as
November 5, 2021. Dkt. No. 354. The Court is prepared to proceed with both hearings
on that date. Alternatively, the proceedings could be held on either the afternoon of
November 9 or the afternoon of November 10. The Government shall confer with its
proposed expert regarding availability for the Daubert hearing as well as with alleged
victims who wish to attend and be heard at the Rule 412 Motion hearing. After doing
so, the parties shall confer with each other as to availability. On or before November 2,
2021, the parties shall jointly file a letter with the Court indicating whether the parties
request that the hearings be held on November 5, 9, or 10. SO ORDERED. (Signed by
Judge Alison J. Nathan on 10/31/2021)(bw) (Entered: 11/01/2021)

11/01/2021 | 401 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' proposed
redactions to the parties' motions in limine, responses in opposition, replies in support,
and related exhibits. As the Court indicated at today's conference, some of the parties’
proposed redactions are overbroad considering the three—part test articulated by the
Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).
In particular, for the reasons stated at today's conference, the Court denies the
Government's request to redact section ten of the Government's motion in limine. See
Dkt. No. 380. The Court will also not permit redactions pertaining to the general
description of evidence or anticipated testimony as such redactions are unnecessary to
protect the privacy interests of the individuals implicated. Accordingly, the parties
must propose more tailored redactions consistent with the Court's discussion at today's
conference. The parties are ORDERED to submit the proposals to the Court via email
by November 4, 2021. In order to facilitate the Court's review of the requests, the
Court requires the parties to submit the proposed redactions as a single document and
with the proposed redactions highlighted. The Defendant's proposed redactions should
be highlighted in one color, and the Government's a different color. The Court will rule
on the proposed redactions expeditiously. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
