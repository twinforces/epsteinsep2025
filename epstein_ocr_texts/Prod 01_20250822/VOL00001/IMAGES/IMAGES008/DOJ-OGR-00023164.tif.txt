prosecutors adhere to the principles and objectives” of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the
Sentencing Guidelines, and the PROTECT Act “in their charging, case disposition, and sentencing
practices.”!9>

The Ashcroft Memo directed that, “in all federal cases, federal prosecutors must charge
and pursue the most serious, readily provable offense or offenses that are supported by the facts of
the case,” except as authorized by an Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or designated
supervisory authority in certain articulated limited circumstances. The Ashcroft Memo cautioned
that a charge is not “readily provable” if the prosecutor harbors a good faith doubt, based on either
the law or the evidence, as to the government’s ability to prove the charge at trial. The Ashcroft
Memo explains that the “basic policy” “requires federal prosecutors to charge and pursue all
charges that are determined to be readily provable” and would yield the most substantial sentence
under the Sentencing Guidelines.

The policy set forth six exceptions, including a catch-all exception that permits a prosecutor
to decline to pursue readily provable charges “in other exceptional circumstances” with the written
or otherwise documented approval of an Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or “designated
supervisory attorney.” As examples of circumstances in which such declination would be
appropriate, the Ashcroft Memo cites to situations in which a U.S. Attorney’s Office is
“particularly over-burdened,” the trial is expected to be of exceptionally long duration, and
proceeding to trial would significantly reduce the total number of cases the office could resolve.
The Ashcroft Memo specifically notes that “[c]harges may be declined . . . pursuant to a plea
agreement only to the extent consistent” with the policies established by the Memo.

On January 28, 2005, Deputy Attorney General James Comey issued a memorandum
entitled “Department Policies and Procedures Concerning Sentencing.” That memorandum
reiterated that federal prosecutors “must continue to charge and pursue the most serious readily
provable offenses,” and defined that term as the offenses that would “generate the most substantial
sentence” under the Sentencing Guidelines, any applicable mandatory minimum, and any
statutorily required consecutive sentence.

Importantly, although the Ashcroft and Comey memoranda limit an individual line
prosecutor’s ability to decline “readily provable” charges in their entirety, no such restriction is
placed upon the U.S. Attorneys, who retained authority to approve exceptions to the policy. In
addition, the policy applies to “readily provable” charges, thus inherently allowing a prosecutor
195 The Ashcroft Memo was issued before the Supreme Court decided United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220
(2005), which struck down the provision of the federal sentencing statute that required federal district judges to impose
a sentence within the applicable Federal Sentencing Guidelines range. Those Guidelines were the product of
the United States Sentencing Commission, which was created by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. The
Prosecutorial Remedies and Other Tools to End the Exploitation of Children Today (PROTECT) Act of 2003, Pub.
L. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650, was directed at preventing child abuse. It included a variety of provisions designed to
improve the investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against children. Among other things, the PROTECT Act
provided for specific sentencing considerations for certain sex-related offenses, such as those involving multiple
occasions of prohibited sexual conduct or those involving material with depictions of violence or with specified
numbers of images.
