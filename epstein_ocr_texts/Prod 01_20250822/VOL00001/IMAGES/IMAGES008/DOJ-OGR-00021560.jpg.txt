1 Virginia, was unaware if she had interacted with anyone under
2 the age of 18 at Epstein's properties. She never gave Annie

3 Farmer a massage. She was unaware whether Epstein possessed

4 sex toys. She was unaware that he was engaging in sexual

5 activity with anyone other than her in the 1990s and 2000s.

6 She never gave Epstein a massage. The credible testimony and
7 evidence admitted at trial disproves these assertions which

8 were made under oath.

g Paragraph 79, the defendant objects to the

10 characterization of the offense conduct as contrary to the

11 trial record. Here, defense hasn't provided any reason

12 specifying this, and I don't see one. So based on the written
Ls objection, it's overruled.

14 Paragraph 81, the defendant objects to the assertion
15 that Ms. Maxwell had direct responsibility for any sexualized
16 massages that several women or any other people that Carolyn
17 may have brought to Epstein's residence may have performed, and
18 she contends there's no record that she interfaced with these
19 individuals. I am prepared to overrule that objection.
20 The paragraph makes clear that these individuals did
a1 not interact directly with Ms. Maxwell. Nevertheless, for the
22 reasons explained a little while ago in overruling the
23 objections to paragraphs 27 and 28, I do conclude that the
24 evidence at trial established that the defendant's recruitment
25 of Virginia set the recruitment scheme in motion that resulted
