D. Epstein Further Delays His Guilty Plea

The addendum did not bring the case to conclusion. Instead, the matter entered a new,
protracted phase, which involved the upper echelons of the Department of Justice. Despite the
fact that Epstein and his attorneys had signed the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing
to senior Department managers with the goal of setting aside the NPA entirely. Although
ultimately unsuccessful, the strategy delayed the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea by months.

On October 29, 2007, Villafafia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that she wanted
Sloman to address with Lefkowitz. Among other things, Villafafia pointed out that the NPA
required Epstein to use his “best efforts” to comply with the agreement, but he had failed to comply
with the timeline established by the NPA when he sought and obtained a plea hearing
postponement from October 26 to November 20. Responding to Lefkowitz’s attempts to limit the
USAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafafia noted that the USAO
needed to be able to communicate with the State Attorney’s Office and the victims’ attorney “to
[e]nsure that Epstein is abiding by the terms of the agreement.”

That same day, Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the state judge
assigned to the case had scheduled Epstein’s plea and sentence in early January 2008. Belohlavek
assured Sloman that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that
was agreed on by all for the sentencing.” *” Nonetheless, emails over the course of the next month
show that the USAO, the State Attorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued to communicate
regarding the date of the guilty plea, with the USAO asserting that a proposed January 7, 2008
date for the entry of Epstein’s guilty plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended that
Epstein had not agreed to any date. Finally, after multiple communications referring to various
potential dates, on December 7, 2007, Epstein attorney Jack Goldberger issued a Notice of
Hearing, setting the case for January 4, 2008.!°°

Monetary Damages for the Victims

With Epstein’s plea hearing delayed, he launched a new effort to undermine the validity of
the NPA, this time within the Department. On November 16, 2007, Epstein attorney Kenneth Starr
called the office of Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division Alice Fisher and left a
message that he was calling regarding Epstein.'°! At Fisher’s request, Lourie, who in late
September 2007 had begun serving his detail as Fisher’s Principal Deputy and Chief of Staff,
returned the call. Fisher told OPR that she had no recollection of this call, and Lourie also could
