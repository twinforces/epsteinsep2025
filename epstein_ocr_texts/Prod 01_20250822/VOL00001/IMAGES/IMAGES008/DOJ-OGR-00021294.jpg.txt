protracted. phase, which. involved. the upper echelons -of the Department of Justice. Despite the.
tact that Epstein and his attorneys had signed.:the NPA, they pursued a new strategy of appealing,
to senior Department managers. with, the goal of setting aside ‘the NPA entirely. ‘Although,

ultimately unsuccessful, the strategy-delayed the entry of Epstein’s; guilty:plea by months.

On October 29, .2007, Villafatia emailed Sloman, raising several issues that. she wanted.
Sloman to address with Lefkowitz. Aimong other things, Villafana pointed, out that the NPA
required.Epstein. to use his “best:cfforts” to:comply with the agreement, but:he had.failed.to comply
With the timeline established. by the NPA whef, hé sought and, obtained. a plea hearing,
postponement, from October.26 to November 20. Responding to Lefkowitz’s attempts to limit.the.
USAO’s communications with various entities and individuals, Villafatia noted. that ‘the USAO
needed to: be able to communicate with the State Attorney’s Office and the victims’ attorney “t
[e]nsure that Epstein. is abiding,by:the terms of the:agreement.”

That same day, Assistant State.Attorney Belohlavek informed Sloman that the ‘state judge
assighéd to, the case had. scheduled Epstein’s plea and séntence-in early Jantary 2008. Belohlavek’
assured. Sloman. that the “plea and sentence will definitely occur before the January 4th date that.
was agreed on’by all:for‘the sentencing. onl Nonetheless, emails over the:course of'the next month
show ‘that'the USAO, the: State Attorney’s Office, and defense counsel continued'to- communicate.
regarding: the date: of the guilty plea, with ‘the: USAO asserting that: a proposed, January. 7,.2008
date ‘for the entry of Epstein’s guilty. plea was “unacceptable,” while the defense contended ‘that.
Epstein. had. not agreed to any date. Finally, after. multiple: communications referring to various
potential dates, on December 7, 2007, Epstein, attorney Jack Goldberger ‘issued a Notice of
Hearing, setting the case for January 4,:2008.'>"
