the: defendant faced.decades in. prison.for sexual. crimes against minors with such. an. insignificant:
terin of incarceration, and made numerous other:concessions tothe defense. As OPR has set forth.
‘in substantial. detail.:in. this Report, OPR did not find evidence to support allegations that the:
prosecutors sought; to benefit.Epstein at the expense of the victims. Instead, the result; can more
appropriatcly be tied. to Acosta’s misplaced. concerns about interfering with a traditionally. state
crime and intrudiAg-on state authority. Acosta was also unwilling to, abandon the path that he had.
set, even when Villafata and ‘Louric ‘advocated to end the negotiations. and even though Acosta
himself had.learned that:the state authorities may, not have been a reliable:partner.

Many. of the problems that developed might. have ‘been avoided ‘had Acosta engaged in
greater consultation with his staff before making key decisions. The. contemporancous’ records
revealed problems with communication.and coordination among’ the five key: participants. Acosta
‘was involved to a, greater extent and made more decisions than he did in a, typical case. Lourie
told ‘OPR. that. it was “unusual. ‘to have a U.S. .Attorney, get. involved with. this: level of detail.”
Menchel told:‘OPR, “I know we'would have spoken aboutthis cas¢ a lot, okay? And [in sure with
Jeff as ‘well, and there were conversations’ -- a meeting that.I-had with. Maric: and.Andy: as well.”
Lourie similarly‘told OPR:

‘Well,.. . he would:have been.talking'to Jeff and Matt, talking;to me
to the extent that: he did, he would have been looking at the Pros
Memo and... . the guidance from CEOS, he would have been.
reading the defense attorney’s letters, maybe, talking to the. State
Attorney, I don’t: know, just... . all ‘these: different ‘sources’ of
information, he was -- I’m comfortable that he knew the case, you,
know, that he'was, he was ‘reading everything. Apparently. he, you.
‘know, read the Pros Memo, heread all, the stuff’.

At the-same time, Acosta was significantly.removed, both.in physical distance and ‘in levels:
in the supervisory’ chain, from, the individuals: with the most-knowledge of the facts: of the case—
Villafanavand, to a‘lesser extent, Lourie. Lourie normally-would have signed off onthe prosecution
meémoranduii on his own, but as he’ told OPR, he recognized that the casewas going to.go through
the: front office: “[b]ecause there was front office involvement from the get go.” “¥et, although.
Acosta became involved at certain points in order to make decisions, he did not view himself as
oversecing the: investigation or the details of implementing his decisions. OPR-observed.that-as a
consequence, ‘management of the case suffered from, both an absence: of ownership of the:

On occasion, Villafana, included Acosta directly in emails, but often, information’ upon.

Despite these discussions, though,.it is‘not-clear'that-Acosta was aware of certain information, such
