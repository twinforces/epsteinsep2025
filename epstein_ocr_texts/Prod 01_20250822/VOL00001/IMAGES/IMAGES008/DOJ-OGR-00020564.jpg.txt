01/05/2022 | 571 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court is in receipt of the parties' letters. Dkt.
Nos. 568, 569, 570. The Court hereby sets the following briefing schedule for the
Defense to move for a new trial in light of the issues raised in the parties' letters:
Defense motion: January 19, 2022; Government response: February 2, 2022; Defense
reply: February 9, 2022. The parties' briefing should address whether an inquiry of
some kind is permitted and/or required, and, if so, the nature of such an inquiry.
Although the Court reserves decision on whether an inquiry of any kind is warranted,
the Court grants the Government's request, Dkt. No. 568, to offer court-appointed
counsel to the juror in issue. Subject to the juror's right to decline court-appointed
counsel, the Court will appoint the on—duty CJA counsel to represent the juror. If
counsel for the juror wishes to be heard on the issue of the appropriateness of an
inquiry, briefing by the juror's counsel may be filed by January 26, 2022. The Court
will not adjourn post-trial briefing on other issues as requested by the Defense, Dkt.
No. 569, but sets the following schedule for any other post—verdict motion by the
Defense: Defense motion: February 4, 2022; Government opposition: February 18,
2022; Defense reply: March 4, 2022. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.
Nathan on 1/5/2022) (bw) (Entered: 01/05/2022)

01/10/2022 | 574 | JOINT LETTER by USA as to Ghislaine Maxwell addressed to Judge Alison J.
Nathan from AUSAs Maurene Comey, Alison Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew
Rohrbach dated January 10, 2022 re: Scheduling Document filed by USA. (Rohrbach,
Andrew) (Entered: 01/10/2022)

01/12/2022 | 575 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The parties are ORDERED to submit via email any
proposed redactions on or before January 13, 2022, justifying any such request by
reference to the three—part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v.
Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). If any redactions are
proposed, the Court will determine whether any are appropriate and then docket the
motion. The parties shall respond to Juror 50s motion on or before January 20, 2022.
Upon further reflection, unless and until Juror No. 50 is permitted to intervene, he may
have no standing to be heard on the question of whether an inquiry should be
conducted. Accordingly, the Court withdraws the aspect of its prior order setting
January 26, 2022, as the date by which counsel for Juror 50 should file a submission
on the issue of the appropriateness of an inquiry. Dkt. No. 571. The Court will hear
from the parties first regarding Juror 50's pending motion. Depending on the resolution
of that motion, the Court will provide further guidance to counsel for Juror 50
regarding any permitted submission. If a further submission is permitted, the Court
will provide ECF docketing access to counsel for Juror 50 at that time (Signed by
Judge Alison J. Nathan on 1/12/22)(jw) (Entered: 01/12/2022)

01/14/2022 | 576 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. The Court required the parties to indicate whether
Juror 50's motion to intervene and to be provided a copy of the jurors completed
questionnaire and voir dire should be redacted. Dkt. No. 575. In response, the parties
have submitted letters to the Court indicating their differing views on whether Juror
50s motion should be docketed at all. Upon further reflection, the Courtconcludes that
it must first address the threshold question of whether an inquiry is permittedand/or
required before considering Juror 50s requests. Accordingly, the Court will not
consider or act on Juror 50's request to intervene and to be provided a copy of the
jurors completed questionnaire and voir dire until the Court receives the parties
briefing on the appropriateness of an inquiry and the nature of any such inquiry. The
Court will maintain Juror 50's motion temporarily under seal until the Court considers
the parties arguments and determines the appropriate next steps. Consistent with this
