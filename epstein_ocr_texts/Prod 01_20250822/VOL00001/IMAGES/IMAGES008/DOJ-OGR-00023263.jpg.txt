in FBI interviews of Wild and other victims, Villafafia informed CEOS Chief Oosterbaan that she
anticipated the victims “would be concerned about the status of the case.”

On January 31, 2008, Villafafia, the CEOS Trial Attorney, and the FBI interviewed three
victims, including Wild. Prior to the interview, Wild had received the FBI’s January 10, 2008
letter stating that the case was under investigation; however, according to the case agent, Wild and
two other victims had also been told by the FBI, in October 2007, that the case had been resolved.
In her 2015 CVRA-case declaration, Wild stated that after receiving the FBI letter, she believed
that the FBI was investigating the case, and she was not told “about any [NPA] or any potential
resolution of the federal criminal investigation I was cooperating in. If I had been told of a[n
NPA], I would have objected.” In Villafafia’s 2017 declaration in the CVRA litigation, Villafafia
recalled interviewing Wild on January 31, 2008, along with FBI agents, and Villafafia told OPR
she “asked [Wild] whether she would be willing to testify if there were a trial.” Villafafia recalled
Wild responding that she “hoped Epstein would be prosecuted and that she was willing to
testify.”>*>

After the first three victim interviews on January 31, 2008, Villafafia described for Acosta
and Sloman the toll that the case had taken on two of the victims:

One girl broke down sobbing so that we had to stop the interview

twice .. . she said she was having nightmares about Epstein coming

after her and she started to break down again so we stopped the

interview.

The second girl .. . was very upset about the 18 month deal she had

read about in the paper.**° She said that 18 months was nothing and

that she had heard that the girls could get restitution, but she would

rather not get any money and have Epstein spend a significant time

in jail.3°7
Villafafia closed the email by requesting that Acosta and Sloman attend the interviews with victims
scheduled for the following day, but neither did so.*78 Acosta told OPR that it “wasn’t typical”
385 The FBI report of the interview did not reflect a discussion of Wild’s intentions.

337 Acosta told OPR, “The United States can’t unwind an agreement just because . . . some victim indicates that
they don’t like it.” The CEOS Trial Attorney recalled that she did not “think that any one of these girls was interested
in this prosecution going forward.” Furthermore, as previously noted, the CEOS Trial Attorney also opined that “[the
victims] would have testified for us,” but the case would have required an extensive amount of “victim management,”
as the girls were “deeply embarrassed” that they “were going to be called prostitutes.”
338 OPR located FBI interview reports relating to only one February 1, 2008 victim interview. Although
Villafafia’s emails indicated that two additional victims were scheduled to be interviewed on February 1, 2008, OPR
located no corresponding reports for those victim interviews. OPR located undated handwritten notes Villafafa
