damages.*° ‘During a:two-month period, the subject attorneys were involved.to varying degrees in.
cofiverting the broad outline into specific terms, resulting in ‘the NPA signed. by Epstein on.
September 24,.2007.. The: subjects, including: Acosta, were generally able. to. explain. to OPR both
the. larger goals and the case-rélated factors they likely considered, duting the process. of
conceptualizing, negotiating, and. finalizing, this‘resolution.. However, the contemporancous emails
aiid other records do not reflect all of the. conversations among the decision imakers, and ‘their
deliberative. and. decision-making process is therefore not. entirely ‘clear. ‘In. particular, Menchel
and Acosta had offices: located near cach other and likely spoke in. person about ‘the. case, ‘but:
neither had a clear memory of their conversations. Therefore, QPR could not determine all of the.
facts surrounding the: development:of:the two-year state:plea.resolution. orthe NPA.

In. the: following account, OPR. discusses the initial. key decision to: resolve the: federal.
investigation through state, rather than ‘federal, charges, and. scts8 forth inany of, the numerous
communications that:reflect the negotiations. between the! parties that led to the final NPA. ORR.
questioned each of the stibjects about how ‘the decision Was reached ‘to purstié a State resoltition,
and OPR. includes. below ‘the subjects” explanations. ‘The: subjects” memories of particular
conversations. about this topic;were unclear, but from their statements to OPR, a general consensus
emerged ‘that. there: were. overlapping concerns about the: viability of, the: legal. theories,, the
willingness-of:the victims to testify, the impact ofa trial. on the victims, the overall strength of the:
case ‘that.had been developed at'that'time, and the uncertainty ‘about the USAO’s ability to prevail.
at trial and‘through-appeal. In.addition, Acosta was concerned.about usurping'the state’s. authority
to prosecute a case involving an.offense that was tr aditionally handled by state prosecutors. Based
on.-this evidence, OPR. concludes that Acosta may: well. have formulated.the initial. plan to: resolve:
the. matter through a state plea. In any event, Acosta, acknowledged to OPR that, at .a:mininium,
he approved of the concept. of a state- based resolution. after being made aware of. the: allegations:
and thé evidence against Epstein as sct forth in ‘Villafana’s prosecution memorandum.
Furthermore, Acosta approved-of:the final‘terms of the NPA.
