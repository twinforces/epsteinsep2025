I. Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement:does not bar this:prosecution

In. September 2007, under investigation by both federal and,state authorities, Jefirey
‘Epstein entered. into a‘non-prosecution agreement.(*NPA”) with the, Office ofthe. United States
Attorney: for the Southern District of Florida. Dkt. No. 142: at'1-2. Epstein-agreed in‘the NPA‘to
‘plead guilty in. Florida state. court to soliciting minors for prostitution and. to:serve.cighteen

‘but nonctheless reflected “poor judgment.” /d. ‘at 1.69.

Only the NPA’s effect, and not its wisdom, is presently before the Court. Maxwell.
contends that the NPA‘bars this prosecution, because she is charged-as'a ‘co-conspirator of
Jeffrey Epstein andthe NPA’s co-conspirator, provision lacks any geographical, or temporal
