I, Jeffrey Epstein’s non-prosecution agreement does not bar this prosecution

In September 2007, under investigation by both federal and state authorities, Jeffrey
Epstein entered into a non-prosecution agreement (“NPA”) with the Office of the United States
Attorney for the Southern District of Florida. Dkt. No. 142 at 1-2. Epstein agreed in the NPA to
plead guilty in Florida state court to soliciting minors for prostitution and to serve eighteen
months in a county jail. /d. In exchange, the U.S. Attorney’s Office agreed not to charge him
with federal crimes in the Southern District of Florida stemming from its investigation of his
conduct between 2001 and 2007. /d. It also agreed not to bring criminal charges against any of
his “potential co-conspirators.” Jd.

As a recent report from the Department of Justice’s Office of Professional Responsibility
observed, the NPA was unusual in many respects, including its breadth, leniency, and secrecy.
OPR Report, Gov. Ex. 3, Dkt. No. 204-3, at x, 80, 175, 179, 260-61. The U.S. Attorney’s
promise not to prosecute unidentified co-conspirators marks a stark departure from normal
practice for federal plea agreements. This provision appears to have been added “with little
discussion or consideration by the prosecutors.” /d. at 169, 185. The report concluded that the
U.S. Attorney’s negotiation and approval of the NPA did not amount to professional misconduct,
but nonetheless reflected “poor judgment.” /d. at 169.

Only the NPA’s effect, and not its wisdom, is presently before the Court. Maxwell
contends that the NPA bars this prosecution, because she is charged as a co-conspirator of
Jeffrey Epstein and the NPA’s co-conspirator provision lacks any geographical or temporal
limitations. The Court disagrees for two independent reasons. First, under controlling Second
Circuit precedent, the NPA does not bind the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New
York. Second, it does not cover the offenses charged in the $1 superseding indictment.
