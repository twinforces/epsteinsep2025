previously noted, there :is: some ‘contemporaneous evidence supporting her assertion. Villafana’s
inention of the agreement, even if not described :in, specific terms, would have: been sufficient-to
apprise those. victims of the status ofthe federal investigation.

Nevertheless, Villafatia did ‘not recall discussing’the NPA. specifically or in ‘general terms
with, other victims interviewed at ‘that ‘time, nor did she ‘do so with Edwards or any other victim’s
attorney, OPR- therefore considered whether the omission of information about-the existence of.
the NPA during these:interactions rose:to the'level:of professional.misconduct:in.violation.of ERPG
4.4.1 or4-8.4.11!

OPR évaluated Villafana’s conduct in light of the comment to: FRPC 4-4.12

A lawyer is required tobe truthful. when dealing, with, others ona
client’s behalf, but generally has no affirmative duty to inforny an.
opposing party: of relevant facts. A misrepresentation :can. occur if
the: lawyer" incorporates: or.affirins a statement of another person that.
the lawyer ‘knows is false. ‘Misrepresentations can. also occur by
pattially true but misleading statements. or omissions that are the
equivalent.of affirmative ‘false’statements.

The victims and ‘their attorneys were certainly. not “opposing part[ics]” ‘to the USAO,, but. the
comment indicates that the rule recognizes; that omissions made during discussions with third.
parties, even of-relevant facts, are not always treated as false statements.

statement.to the victims or Edwards.or that-her. omissions were “the equivalent of affirmative: false:
statements” about material facts. First, Villafatia told OPR that she! believ od. the: inv cstigation was

entered. his guilty plea ‘in, state:court. in June 2008. Villafafia’s email correspondence ‘with her:
supervisors.reflects:her strong advocacy during that timeframe:to declare Epstein in‘breach and:to
charge him, ‘The-evidenee similarly:does not show. that Villafana knowingly. made any. affitmative
false statement: to Edwards when she:informed him of the state court.plea, although she: declined
to provide additional information.in response to his questions.“ : ;

Second, ‘in. reaching its conclusion, OPR, considered the full context in which Villafana.
interacted with the victims and Edwards. ‘Prosecutors routinely make: decisions about what.

information willbe disclosed to-witnesses, including victims, for:a-varicty of strategic reasons. In
many. cases, ‘prosecutors must make difficult decisions about:providing information to witnesses,
