Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 174 of 348

The USAO might have been. able to surmount the evidentiary, legal, and policy ‘issues
presented by a federal ‘prosecution of Epstein. Villafafia, in particular, believed she could have
prevailed had she taken the case to trial, and even. after the NPA ‘was negotiated, she repeatedly
recominended declaring Epstein in breach and -procéeding with an. indictment, because she
continued to ‘have: confidence in. the case.” QOosterbaan and ‘thers. also. believed. that the:
government would:suecced at-trial. Furthermore, the Victinssveére not a‘uniform group. Some of,
them were: afraid. of testifying or having their identities made public; others wanted Epstein
prosecuted, buteven among-those, it ‘is ‘not clear how many expressed a willingness to testify. ata.
trial; ‘and still, others provided information, favorable to Epstein. In the:.end, Acosta. assumed
responsibility for deciding. how, to resolve the Epstein investigation. and weighing. the risks and.
benefits of a trial versus those of a pre- charge disposition. His determination, that, a‘pre- charge
disposition. was appropriate was not unreasonable-under, the circumstances.

Although evidentiary and witness. issues ‘explain. the subject. supervisors” ‘concerns ‘about.
winning a potential trial and why the USAO ‘would have sought soiné sort of :pre-charge:
disposition, they do not. fully explain why Acosta decided to pursue: a ‘state- based resolution: as
opposed .to a traditional. federal:pica-agreement.. OPR, did not:find in:the contemporancous records
a memorandum ‘or other’memorialization of the reasoning underlying.Acosta’s decision to offer-a.
state-based resolution or the:terms offered.to the: defense: on.July 31, 2007.

According to Acosta, “In 2006, it.would have:been. extremely unusual for any United States
Attorney’ ‘Office to: become involved in a state solicitation: case, even one involving, underage
teens,” because solicitation was “the province of state prosecutors.” Acosta told OPR. that he:
developed “a preference for deferring to the state” to “inake it clear that [the USAO was] not
stepping ‘on, something that is a purely local ‘matters because we [didn’t] want bad preeedent for
the:sake of the larger human trafficking-issue.” Acosta also‘told.OPR that:it was his understanding,
that ‘the PBPD would. not. have. brought the case ‘to federal investigators if the State Attorney’s
Office had. pursued. a ‘sanction ‘against Epstein ‘that ‘included jail. time and. sexual offender
registration. Acosta: viewed. the USAO’s tole in the case as limited to preventing the “manifest:
‘injustice’ that,..in. Acosta’s view, would ‘have ‘resulted from, the: state’s original, plea proposal.
Acosta: sacknowledged: that: if-the inv estigation had begun.in the federal system, he would. not-have
viewed the terms: set out.in the NPA as a ‘satisfactory result, but. it ‘was adequate: to serve as a
“backstop” to the state’s. ‘prosecution, which, he desetibed as “a polite way of saying[,
“Jencouraging, the state to do a little‘bit:more.[’]” In sum, Acosta told OPR that the: Epstein ‘case:
lay-in“unchaited territory,” there was.no certaifity that the USAO would-prevail if it went-to-trial,
and a potentially unfavorable outcome had to: be: “weighed against.a certain’ plea with registration
that would make sure thatithe, public knew that this:person was a:sex. offender”

Acosta,told OPR. that he discussed the: case primarily’with Sloman and.Menchel, and both.
told.OPR that; while they did not.share: Acosta’s. federalism concerns, they recalled that Acosta had

the ‘terms offered to the defense on July3'1.:2007. Theretore, any allegations against the; prosecutors could not have:
played a.significant:role in Acosta’s decisionsias:reflected:in.the:term sheet.
