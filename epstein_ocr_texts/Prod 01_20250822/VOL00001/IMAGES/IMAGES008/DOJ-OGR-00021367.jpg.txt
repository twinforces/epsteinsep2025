Villafaiia had raised (defense: ;counsel’s attempt ‘to insert. an immigration. waiver into the
agreement), but Lourie did. not comment on. the provision promising not ‘to prosecute co-
conspirators or ask: Villafaiia to explain why she believed the provision. did not ‘harm. the:
government’ § ititerests. In a subsequent email about the draft NPA, Villafana asked Lourie ‘for’

“[{a]ny. other thoughts,” but there ‘is no indication. that he provided further input. OPR found ‘no
document ‘that suggested Villafaia and Lourie discussed the provision further, -or that ‘the other
individuals who were copied. on: Villafaria’s' email referencing, the provision—her immediate:
supervisor, the:supervisor:designated to:succeed.Lourie as manager ofthe West.Palm Beach office,
and Villafana’s co-counse|—commented-on or had ‘substantive discussions about it. Villafata.told
OPR. that because: none of the ‘three supervisors responded. to her observation, that the non-
prosecution provision “doesn’t hurtus,” Villafana-assumed ‘thatthey agreed with, herassessment.

Villafana told OPR.that she could:not-recall a conversation specifically about the provision.
agreeing not to ‘prosecute “any potential co-conspirators,” but she remembered generally ‘that.
defense counsel-told her Epstein wanted “to make, sure’thatihe’s the only one who takes the blaine
‘for what happened. ” WVillafatia told. OPR that. she. and. her colleagues believed Epstein’ s conduct
was his own “dirty little. secret.” Villafaiia said:that:press coverage. at:the time: of Epstein’s: 2006
arrest did not allege'that: any of his famous contacts’ participated i in-Epstein’s illicit activity and that.
none:of the-victims interviewed by-the case agents before the NPA wassigned.told.the investigators
‘about. sexual, activity with any of Epstein’s ‘well: ‘known contacts about, whom allegations arose
many. years; later.*** Villafata acknowledged that investigators:were aware of Epstcin’s longtime:
relationship with, a close female: friend ‘who was a well-known socialite, but, according ‘to
Villafaiia, in.2007, they: “didn’t have any specific evidence: against ‘her.””?*? Accordingly, Villafafia
believed'that the only “co- -conspirators” ‘of, Epstein who would benefit'trom the provision’ were the
four female assistants identified by name.™"? Villafatia also told OPR that the focus:of'the USAO’s:
investigation was Epstein, afd. the office was not inclined to prosecute his ‘four assistarits if he:
entered.a plea.”*! Because Villafafia was unaware of:anyone else who could-or would be: charged,
she perecived, no reason to: object to, a provision promising not to ‘prosecute other, unspecified.
“co-conspirators.” Villafana told-OPR- that. given her understanding of the facts at-that time, it did
not occur to herthat'the reference to other “potential co-conspirators” might be:used to protect any’

Lourie; who, was' transitioning ’ to his detail at the Departinent’s Criminal Division at the
time Villafaiia forwarded to hint the draft NPA containing the non- prosecution provision, told.OPR.
that he did not know how the provision developed and did not recall any disctissions about it.
