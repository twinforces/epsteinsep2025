12/28/2020 104 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On December 8, 2020, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
filed a renewed motion for releaseon bail. Dkt No. 97. In an Opinion and Order
concurrently filed under temporary seal, the Court DENIES the Defendant's motion. In
light of the fact that the Opinion includes potentially confidential information that should
not be filed on the public docket, the Court will permit the parties 48 hours to propose
any redactions to the Courts Opinion and Order and to justify those redactions by
reference tothe Second Circuits decision in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435
F.3d 110(2d Cir. 2006). After determining which, if any, portions of the Opinion and
Order should be redacted, the Court will file the Opinion and Order on the public docket.
As a result, the Court concludes that the Government has met its burden of persuasion
that the Defendant poses a flight risk and that pretrial detention continues to be
warranted. On or before December 30, 2020, the parties are ORDERED to submit a joint
letter indicating whether they propose any redactions and the justification for any such
proposal. This resolves Dkt No. 97. (Signed by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 12/28/20)Gw)
