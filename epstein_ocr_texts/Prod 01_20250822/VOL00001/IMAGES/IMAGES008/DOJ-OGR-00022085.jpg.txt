Moreover, even where agents from a component of an agency are involved in an
investigation, that does not render the entirety of an agency part of the prosecution team. See, e.g.,
United States v. Stein, 424 F. Supp. 2d 720, 723 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (“While the prosecution’s [Rule
16] disclosure obligation in some circumstances may extend to materials beyond the knowledge
of the individual prosecutors assigned to a case, it does not extend to the collective knowledge of
the entire United States government or even to the entire government agency concerned.”’); United
States v. Pelullo, 399 F.3d 197, 218 (3d Cir. 2005) (“[T]hat other agents in the ([Department of
Labor (“DOL”)] participated in this investigation does not mean that the entire DOL is properly
considered part of the prosecution team.”’); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F.3d 924, 949 (2d
Cir.1993) (refusing, for Brady purposes, to impute to AUSAs prosecuting that action with the
assistance of certain FBI agents knowledge of reports prepared by FBI agents who were
“uninvolved in the investigation or trial of the defendants’); but see United States v. Ghailani, 687
F. Supp. 2d 365, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (holding that, in the context of a speedy trial motion, other
members of the Department of Justice who were involved in making decisions about timing and
progress of the case were part of the “government” for Rule 16 purposes).

Thus, as the foregoing precedents recognize, the factors relevant in determining whether
an agency or a component of an agency are part of the prosecution team, and therefore their records
are in the “possession” of the Government include whether the agency or component: “(1)
participated in the prosecution’s witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting the case to the
grand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered by or shared documents with the prosecution, (4)
played a role in the development of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanied the prosecution to
court proceedings.” Middendorf, 2018 WL 3956494, at *4.
