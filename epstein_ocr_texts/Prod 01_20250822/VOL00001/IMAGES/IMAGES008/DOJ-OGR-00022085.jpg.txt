Morcover, even. where: agents’ from, a component of an, agency are involved in an,
investigation, that docs not:render the entirety of an agency part of the:prosccution team. Sée, €:g:,
United States v. Stein, 424.F. Supp. 2d.720, 723:(S.D.N.Y. 2006) (“While:the prosccution’s [Rule
16] disclosure obligation in some circumstances may extend to materials beyond. the knowledge
of the individual ‘prosecutors assigned to a case, it docs not extend to the collective knowledge of
the entire United States, government or.even.to the entire: government agency concerned.”); United
States 'v: Pelullo, 399 F.3d 197, 2.18 (3d, Cir. 2005) (“[T]hat other agents in'the ([Department. of
Labor (“DOL”)] participated. in this investigation docs. not mean that the entire. DOL is properly’
considered part of the prosecution team.”); see also United States v. Locascio, 6 F 34.924, 949 (2d.
Cir.1993) (refusing, for Brady purposes, to: impute to AUSAs prosccuting that. action with, the
assistance. of certain FBI agents knowledge of :reports prepared by FBI agents. ‘who were
“uninvolved:in,the investigation or trial of the defendants”); bui/.see United States v. Ghailani, 687
F. Supp. 24.365, 372 (S.D.N.Y. 2010) (holding that, in the context of a speedy trial motion, other
members of. the Department of Justice who were involved. in :making decisions about. timing, and.
progress ofthe case were part of the “government” for Rule 16 purposes).

Thus, as, the foregoing preecdents Tecognize, the factors relevant. in determining whethér

an.agency’or a component of'an.agency arc part ofthe prosecution team, and therefore their records

are in ‘the, “possession” of the Government include whether the agency or component: “(1)
participated in.the prosccution’s witness interviews, (2) was involved in presenting'the case to the
grand jury, (3) reviewed documents gathered, by or shared documents with the prosecution, (4)
played a role in. the development of prosecutorial strategy, or (5) accompanied the prosecution to

court:proceedings.” Middendorf, 2018 WL 3956494, at *4.
