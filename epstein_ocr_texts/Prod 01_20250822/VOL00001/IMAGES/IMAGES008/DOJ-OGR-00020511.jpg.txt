03/18/2021 | 168 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On February 26, 2021, the Government filed its
omnibus memorandum of law opposing Defendants’ twelve pretrial motions. It filed
the brief, along with the corresponding exhibits, under temporary seal pending the
Court's resolution of its request to redact sensitive or confidential information. See
Dkt. No. 162. On March 9, 2021, the Defendant objected to certain of the redactions
that the Government had proposed, and she proposed additional redactions. Having
considered the parties’ respective positions, the Court will grant the Government's
requests for redactions and sealing, as well as the Defendant's additional redaction
requests, with the exceptions discussed below. Finally, the Court denies the
Governments request to file Exhibit 11 entirely under seal. While portions of that
transcript have been redacted, other portions are part of the public record. See Giuffre
v. Maxwell, Case No. 15-—cv—7433, Dkt. No. 1212-1. In light of this, the Court sees
no basis to file the transcript entirely under seal rather than by redacting the relevant
portions. In light of the above, the Government is hereby ORDERED to either docket
on ECF their brief and the corresponding exhibits, consistent with this Order, or to file
a letter with the Court justifying more tailored redaction and sealing requests regarding
pages 1128 and 187188 and Exhibits 8 and 9 by no later than March 22, 2021. The
parties are further ORDERED to meet, confer, and jointly propose redactions to the
Defendant's cover letter objecting to the Government's proposed redactions by March
22, 2021. Finally, the parties are ORDERED to meet, confer, and propose redactions
to Exhibit 11 of the Government's submission by March 22, 2021 (Signed by Judge
Alison J. Nathan on 3/18/21)(jw) (Entered: 03/18/2021)

03/22/2021 | 169 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell's third motion for
release on bail, Dkt. No. 160, is DENIED. The parties are ORDERED to meet and
confer and propose and justify any redactions to the Defendant's reply brief by March
24, 2021. If they conclude that redactions are unnecessary, the Defendant is
ORDERED to docket the unredacted version of the brief by March 24, 2021. (Signed
by Judge Alison J. Nathan on 3/22/2021) (See ORDER set forth) (ap) Modified on

THIRD MOTION for Bond . . (Sternheim, Bobbi) (Entered: 03/23/2021)

03/24/2021 | 172 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard
for Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the
ground that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3)
provides that "[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of
personal or confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only
by court order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional
circumstances, the court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can
move to quash or modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3).
Consistent with the Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court
required defense counsel to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or
confidential information may be disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also
gave the alleged victims an opportunity to object to or request modifications of the
