‘multiplicitous, see supra Part I, and therefore. the Court will not enterjudgment on those*counts.
“And at trial, the jury found the:Defendant not guilty‘on:;Count Two. Thus, the:Court-will
consider the sufficiency ofthe evidence for the:remaining counts: Three, Four,.and Six. After
considering the:arguments and evidence, the Court denies’ the Defendant’s Rule 29 motion.

sufficiency of the evidenee—in.cither the oral application. or the post-conviction briefing—for
Counts Three, Four, or'Six. Instead, for. these remaining counts, ‘the. Defendant simply fasserts’
