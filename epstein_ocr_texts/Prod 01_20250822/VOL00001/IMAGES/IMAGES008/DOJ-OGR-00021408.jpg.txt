‘involved in-such notifications. According;to Villafata, Sloman then-directed her to have the case:
agents take the victim notifications.

Accordingly, Villafana directed the case agents:to“meet:with ‘the-victims to provide:them
with:information. regarding the: terms of the [NPA] and the conclusion of the federal investigation.”
The case agent, told) OPR, “[T]here was a discussion. that Marie and. I had as
to... .how wewould tell, them, and. what we would'tell them, and what; that;was I don’t:recall, but,
ity was the terms of the agreement:” Villafana believed that if “victims were properly notified of.
thetermis [of the NPA] that: applied: to them,-regarding'theirright to:seck damages from [Epstein],
and he paid. those: damages, that the: rest: of the [NPA] doesn’t need ‘to be: disclosed.” Villafatia
. “anticipated that [the case agents)’ would be able'to inforin the victinis.of the date-of the state-court:
change of. plea [hearing], but that date had not.yet: been set by: state authorities at the time-the first
Victims were notified [by the FBI.” Villafana, told, OPR: that it was her belief that because. the
USAO had agreed to a confidentiality clause, the government could not disclose the NPA to the
general public, but victims could.be inforined “because by its;terms they needed to be told what!
the: agreement was about.” ‘Villafana told OPR that no one in her. supervisory. chain expressed | ia
concern.that:if victims learned of the NPA, they would .try:to prevent Epstein.from-entering.a plea.

Within. a,week after'the NPA was signed, news media, began:repoiting ond the en had
reached, a ‘deal to resolve the Epstein « case. _For examples on. _ October 2007, the
at his Florida 1 mansion. in.a deall that will send him to prison for about 18 months." and noted. that.
Epstein would. plead. guilty in state court and that “the ‘feds have, agreed to. drop their probe into
possible federal.criminal, violations in, exchange. for'the guilty plea to the new state. charge.”*""

The case agent recalled informing some victims that “there was an agreement:reached” and.
“wewould not'be pursuing this: federally. ” Tn October.2007, for. example, the:case: agents met with.
victim Courtney Wild, “to advise her of the tnain terms of the Non=Prosecution Agreement.”
According to the:case: agent, during that: ‘mecting, the:case: agents told’ Wild “that:an agreement had
been. reached, Mr; Epstein; was going-to plead guilty to, two state charges, and there would not be
a federal prosecution.3°2 However, in a declaration filed ‘in.20.1:5 in the CVRA litigation, Wild.

[T]he:agents explained that Epstein.was.also being charged in. State
court:and may plea [sic] to state char Bes: yelated to some of his other:
victims: I.knew that State char ‘ges had nothing to do. with :me.
