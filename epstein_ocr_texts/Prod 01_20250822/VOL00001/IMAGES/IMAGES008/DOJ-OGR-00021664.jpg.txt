which Maxwell and Epstein remained close friends.
(Tr.1494-96; GX-422). For over a decade, Maxwell
traveled with Epstein, a multi-millionaire, on his pri-
vate planes and mingled with rich and famous people,
while enjoying a life of extraordinary luxury. (Tr.96-
99, 233-34, 303-04, 1194). Maxwell and Epstein spent
time together in Epstein’s various properties, includ-
ing his mansion on the Upper East Side in Manhattan,
his villa in Palm Beach, his ranch in New Mexico, his
apartment in Paris, and his private island in the U.S.
Virgin Islands. (Tr.99). Maxwell also received a town-
house that Epstein bought for her in New York City,
and Epstein transferred more than $23 million to Max-
well during the timeframe of the conspiracy. (Tr.1194,
1310-17).

In addition to her role as Epstein’s girlfriend, Max-
well also supervised Epstein’s households as “the lady
of the house.” (Tr.95, 783-84). When she took charge of
Epstein’s homes, she imposed strict rules for staff,
some of which were included in a household manual
dictating the operation of the Palm Beach residence.
(Tr.807-08, 823-31).

To protect her criminal activities from exposure,
Maxwell fostered a culture of silence at Epstein’s
homes. (Tr.784, 826). The household manual made
clear that staff were to “see nothing, hear nothing, say
nothing, except to answer a question directed at” that
staff member. (Tr.826). Maxwell directed Juan Alessi,
the former manager of Epstein’s Palm Beach villa, to
speak to Epstein only when spoken to and not to look
Epstein in the eyes. (Tr.784).
