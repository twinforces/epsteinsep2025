‘Consult Victims about: the Plea, Discussions, but Her Supervisors Do
Not Currently Recall Such Instructions

which, took. place: when “we ‘were probably: just. entering into plea, negotiations,” she raised. the
government’: 5 obligation to: confér with victims?* Initially, Villafana told OPR she was
‘instructed, “Don’t talk to [the-victims]. Don’t tell: them. what’s happening,” but: she: was not told
why’she should-not. speak’ to the victims, and.she could not recall'who gave her’ ‘this instruction. In.
a subsequent OPR interview, Villafaiia ‘recalled that when. she raised the ‘issue of notification.
during’ the. miecting, she was told, “Plea Negotiations. are confidential. You can’t-disclose them.”2*”
Villafaia remained uncertain:who gave herthis instruction, but believed it: may: ‘have'been Acosta.

Neither Acosta, Sloman, nor Menchel recalled ‘a meeting ‘at which Villafana was directed
not to notify. the victims. Acosta told OPR that ‘the: decision whether to solicit the-victims’ view:
“is something [that] I think was the focus of the trial team, and not something that I was focused
on.at least at’this time,” and he did not“recall discussions, about-victim. notification until after the
NPA, was signed.” Slomatt also: told OPR. that. he did not, recall, a mecting at which, victim.
notification was discussed. Menchel wrote: in:his response'to OPR, “I have no recollection. of. any
discussions. or'decisions: regarding whether the USAO should notify victiins:of its intention.to enter
‘intoa pre- -char ge disposition of the Epstein. matter.” ‘Furthermore, Menchel told OPR-he could not
think of a-téason why the issué of*Victiin notification Would have arisen before he left the USAO,
because: “we were. way off from finalizing or having ‘anything even close to‘a.deal,” and it would.
have been,“prematire” to. consider-notification?”” |

about a‘meeting involving Menchel in, which, she ~was instructed not to- consult with, victims ‘was inaccurate and,
‘inconsistent with other evidenee. ‘(OPR-carefully ‘considered.the comments but.did not conclude: that the evidence ‘to
