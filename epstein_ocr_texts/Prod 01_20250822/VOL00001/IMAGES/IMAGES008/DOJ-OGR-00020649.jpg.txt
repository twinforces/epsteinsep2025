03/24/2021 172 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell. On March 5, 2021, Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell
submitted to the Court an application for an order authorizing a subpoena pursuant to
Rule 17(c)(3) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The proposed subpoena was
directed at a law firm that represents alleged victims of the Defendant. As is standard for
Rule 17(c) subpoenas, the application was made ex parte and under seal on the ground
that it reveals defense strategy....[*** See this Order ***]... Rule 17(c)(3) provides that "
[a]fter [an indictment] is filed, a subpoena requiring the production of personal or
confidential information about a victim may be served on a third party only by court
order," but "before entering the order and unless there are exceptional circumstances, the
court must require giving notice to the victim so that the victim can move to quash or
modify the subpoena or otherwise object." Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(3). Consistent with the
Rule, on March 12, 2021, in a sealed ex parte Order, the Court required defense counsel
to provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may be
disclosed by the proposed subpoena. The Court also gave the alleged victims an
opportunity to object to or request modifications of the subpoena as required by Rule
17(c)(3). On March 19, 2021, the Court received a letter from the law firm indicating that
it can provide notice to alleged victims whose personal or confidential information may
be elicited by the subpoena. The law firm shall provide notice to any such alleged victims
it represents. In that letter, the law firm also interposed substantial objections on behalf of
the law firm and the alleged victims it represents. Those objections are functionally the
equivalent of a motion to quash, even though the subpoena has not yet issued. So that the
Court can receive adversarial briefing on the proposed subpoena comparable to a motion
to quash, the law firm shall enter an appearance and file its objections on the public
docket. See United States v. Ray, No. 20-CR-110 (LJL), 2020 WL 6939677, at *10
(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 25, 2020) ("[I]f the Court determines that the subpoena calls for personal
or confidential information about a victim, it requires the requesting party have given
notice to the victim before it permits the service of the subpoena. If the victim objects, the
Court will then determine whether to modify or quash the subpoena, including on
grounds that Nixon was not satisfied."). In advance of noticing an appearance and filing,
the law firm shall meet and confer with defense counsel to see if any issues can be
narrowed before formal briefing. Moreover, prior to filing, the law firm shall confer with
defense counsel as to any proposed, necessary, and tailored redactions to the objections.
The law firm's objections with any proposed redactions shall be filed on or before March
26, 2021. Any redactions must be justified consistent with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Within one week of the filing of objections,
defense counsel may respond to the subpoena objections. The law firm may reply within
three days of the Defendant's response.(See Citation 1 on this Order). Counsel shall
confer regarding any proposed redactions for all briefing. SO ORDERED. (Signed by
