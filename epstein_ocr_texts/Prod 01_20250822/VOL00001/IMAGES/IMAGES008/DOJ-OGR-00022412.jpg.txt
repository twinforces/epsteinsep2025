2 So he had this house and I had moved into

3 a 10 foot by 10 foot apartment, because all of our

5 whatever.

6 So he became, in this moment, my life

7 line, really, because I was -- everything was --felt

8 very similar to this moment, if that makes sense.

9 Anyway, so but I had no key to his house.
10 I had no free access to his house. And in the entire
11 time that he lived there, which was I believe until,
12 the beginning of 1996, I never slept a single night
13 in that house. Never ever. Not one.

14 TODD BLANCHE: But you -- so you -- you --
15 you said a minute ago that the -- that you had slept
16 with him on one occasion, and at the time you
17 remember thinking, you know, that this meant you were
18 in a relationship, but then it didn't -- you really
19 were not in that type of relationship.
20 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Well, I thought --
21 TODD BLANCHE: Did that change over --
22 between '91 and '92 or whatever and -- and -- and
23 years forward?
24 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: So I did travel with
25 him a lot.
