sentence of incarceration, and the USAO would consider a plea that differed from that requirement
a breach of the NPA and would “proceed accordingly.”

The guilty plea Epstein entered in state court in June 2008 was consistent with the dictates
of the NPA, and pursuant to that plea, the court imposed a sentence of 18 months’ incarceration.
Epstein, however, applied for and was accepted into the work release program, and was able to
serve a substantial portion of his sentence outside of the jail. The NPA did not reference work
release nor authorize Epstein to receive such benefits during his tenure at the Palm Beach County
Stockade. Moreover, Villafafia received assurances from defense counsel that Epstein would serve
his entire sentence of confinement “in custody.” Responsibility for the decision to afford Epstein
work release privileges during his incarceration rested with state officials, who had the sole
authority for administering the work release program.

After considering the substantial record documenting the decisions made after Acosta’s
October 12, 2007 breakfast meeting with Lefkowitz, OPR found nothing in the record to suggest
that the meeting resulted in a material change to the NPA, affected the sentence Epstein served
pursuant to the NPA, or contributed to state officials’ decision to permit him to participate in work
release.

F. Villafafia’s Emails with Defense Attorney Lefkowitz during the NPA

Negotiations Do Not Establish That Villafania, or Other Subjects, Intended to
Give Epstein Preferential Treatment or Were Motivated by Favoritism or
Other Improper Influences

During the CVRA litigation, the petitioners obtained from Epstein’s attorney, and filed
under seal, a redacted series of email exchanges between Epstein attorney Lefkowitz and Villafafia
(and others with Acosta and Sloman) during September 2007 when the NPA was being finalized,
and thereafter. These emails had been redacted to delete most of Lefkowitz’s side of the
communications, and consequently they did not reflect the full context of Villafafia’s
communications to Lefkowitz. The redacted emails were later unsealed and made public over
Epstein’s objections.**° Media coverage pointed to the content and tone of Villafafia’s emails as
proof that Villafafia and the USAO worked in concert with Epstein’s attorneys to keep the
“sweetheart” deal a secret from the victims and the public. Statements in several emails in
particular were cited as evidence of the USAO’s improper favoritism towards Epstein. In one
example, Villafafia told Lefkowitz that she was willing to include in the NPA a provision agreeing
not to prosecute others, but would “prefer not to highlight for the judge all of the other crimes and
all of the other persons that we could charge.” She also offered to meet with him “‘off campus’”
to finalize negotiations. She also proposed, “[o]n an ‘avoid the press’ note,” that filing federal
charges against Epstein in Miami rather than West Palm Beach would substantially reduce press
coverage.

236 The USAO did not object to the unsealing but requested additional redactions of portions that would reveal
protected information. United States’ Response to Petitioners’ Motion to Use Correspondence to Prove Violations of
the [CVRA] and to Have Their Unredacted Pleadings Unsealed (Apr. 7, 2011). The court declined to order the
additional redactions.
