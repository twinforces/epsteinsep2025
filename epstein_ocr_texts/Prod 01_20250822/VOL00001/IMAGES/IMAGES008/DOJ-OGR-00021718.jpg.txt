absolutely necessary to determine the facts with preci-
sion.” Janniello, 866 F.2d at 544. “[T]he proper func-
tioning of the jury system requires that the courts pro-
tect jurors from being harassed and beset by the de-
feated party in an effort to secure from them evidence
of facts which might establish misconduct sufficient to
set aside a verdict.” Moten, 582 F.2d at 664. Accord-
ingly, the district court “has the power and the duty to
supervise and closely control such inquiries.” United
States v. Calbas, 821 F.2d 887, 896 (2d Cir. 1987). For
example, the district court may choose to personally
conduct the questioning of a juror in order to avoid in-
truding on the jury’s deliberations. See, e.g., Calbas,
821 F.2d at 896. At such a hearing, and with limited
exceptions, the juror “may not testify about any state-
ment made or incident that occurred during the jury’s
deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror’s or
another juror’s vote; or any juror’s mental processes
concerning the verdict or indictment. The court may
not receive a juror’s affidavit or evidence of a juror’s
statement on these matters.” Fed. R. Evid. 606(b)(1).
This Court reviews the denial of a Rule 33 motion
for abuse of discretion. United States v. Archer, 977
F.3d 181, 187 (2d Cir. 2020). A district court only
abuses its discretion if its decision “rests on an error of
law (such as application of the wrong legal principle)
or a clearly erroneous factual finding” or “its decision
... cannot be located within the range of permissible
decisions.” Id. This Court “has only on rare occasions
overturned a verdict or remanded for an evidentiary
hearing” based on the failure of a juror to disclose in-
formation during jury selection. United States v. Te-
man, 465 F. Supp. 3d 277, 330 (S.D.N.Y. 2020).
