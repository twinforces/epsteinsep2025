Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 207 Filed 04/16/21 Page 8 of 34:

C. Maxwell is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing,

In‘the. alternative to dismissing the:indictment, Maxwell:requests ‘that the, Court conduct
an evidentiary: hearing as to the parties’ intent inthe NPA. The ‘Court finds no basis to, do, so.

‘The, cases Maxwell cites where courts held hearings. on.the scope of a plea agreement:
‘mostly involved;oral agreements where:there was no written-:recordofthe. full set of'terms,
reached, by-the;parties. All, oftthem ‘involved:defendants with-first-hand’knowledge of
negotiations who claimed prosecutors breached an-oral.promise. “An. oral. agreement greatly
increases’the potential for, disputes such.as ... . a failure to,agree on therexistence, let alone. the
‘terms, of the deal.” United States v. Aleman, 286 F.3d.86, 90. (2d Cir. 2002).. Thus, an
evidentiary hearing-may be necessary to determine the terms ‘of an agreement never committed.to
‘writing. This .is:no'such ‘case.. The NPA’s terms are clear: ‘Beyond the-NPA itself; an extensive:
OPR report details its:negotiation history. No record evidence suggests’ that prosecutors
promised Epstein anything beyond what-was: spelled out‘in writing. The Court agrees with the
Government that Maxwell’s request for. a hearing rests, om mere ‘conjecture.

Forthe same reason, the: Court will not order. the discovery.on the: NPA. In any case, it’
appears that the Government/has already produced two of the documents. Maxwell seeks‘in-her,
‘motion—the:OPR. report: and notes :mentionedn a privilege-log. Of course, the Government’s
disclosure obligations would require it:to disclose to.Maxwell any ‘exculpatory. ‘evidence: or
evidence material. to‘preparing'the defense, including any: evidence supporting a.defense under

evidence supporting Maxwell's interpretation, of the’NPA.as material, it is required to disclose,
