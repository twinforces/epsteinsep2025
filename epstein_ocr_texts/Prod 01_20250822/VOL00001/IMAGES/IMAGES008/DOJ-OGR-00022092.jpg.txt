A defendant claiming selective prosecution must present “clear evidence” that the decision
to prosecute not only (1) “had a discriminatory .cffect” ‘but was also (2) “motivated ‘by a
discriminatory purpose.” Armstrong, 5.1.7 ULS. at 465; United, States. Alameh, 341 F.3d,167,.1,73

F.2d 1210, 1229 (2d. Cir, 1983), “The discriminatory cffect prong requires a showing that

‘similarly. situated individuals of a different [classification] were not; prosecuted.’” Alameh, 341,
F.3d at 173 (quoting Armstrong, S17 U.S. .at.465). In other-words, the defendant must show that

“some evidence tending to show the’ existence of the essential clements of the defense.”
