captured the core of criminality charged in the Indictment, and the Defendant was not prejudiced
by any alleged variance. Further, because the Government neither intentionally delayed its
prosecution nor was the Defendant prejudiced by any delay, the Court also denies the
Defendant’s motion based on pre-indictment delay. Finally, the Court grants the Defendant’s
motion as to multiplicity. The Government concedes that Count One is multiplicitous with
Count Three, and the Court further concludes that Count Five is multiplicitous with Count Three.
Count Five, like Counts One and Three, charged the Defendant’s participation in the same
decade-long unlawful agreement with the Defendant’s continuous coconspirator, Jeffrey Epstein,
to groom and sexually abuse underage girls.

Accordingly, the Court will enter judgment of conviction on Counts Three, Four, and Six.
The Defendant’s sentencing date remains scheduled for June 28, 2022. The Court previously set
a schedule for sentencing submissions that remains in effect. Dkt. No. 656.

This resolves Dkt. No. 599.
