‘MOTION addressed to Judge:Alison.J. Nathan:from AUSAs Maurene C ‘omey, Alison
Moe, Lara Pomerantz, and Andrew Rohrbach dated. May 14, 2021. ENDORSEMENT:
‘The request for an’ extension of time until May 21, 2021 to: respond to. the Court's May
11, 2021 Order is GRANTED. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison J.. Nathan on
51472021) (Int) (Entered: SSAA 021).

-|wrote fo ‘the C ourt requesting that the. C ourt adress her’ sleeping conditions, with,
‘particular. emphasis on counsel's representation, unsupported by. affidavit or “other

factual, showing, that guards. are shining a flashlight:in Maxwell's eyes every 15
minutes ati night. ‘Dkt. No: 256. Defense counsel claims: thatthe flashlight surveillarice

‘in. Maxwell's eyes is disrupting her sleep, which in turn-is impacting | her ability to.

prepare for-and withstand trial.. The Court sought.more: information by ordering the

‘Government:to confer with legal. counsel. for the Bureau of Prisons and.to respond to

Certain questions. Dkt. No. 257. In response; the 'Governmentstates that MDC staff
conduct flashlight checks of.all'inmates as a matter of course. Dkt. No..270.. As’

reported by the: Gov ernment, inmates housed with cell:mates in the: Special Housing

Unit ¢ are: checked with: flashlights every 30 Minutes. Inmates housed with others i in the:
Gov ernment further: reports that’ to conduct. the checks, flashlights are pointed at the
ceiling of the cell to. confirm thatthe. inmate is present, breathing, and ’not’in.distress.

A8 the Government explains, there aré a number of netitral,reasons Why BOP'S

flashlight, checks. of Maxwell are relatively. more ‘frequent than those. of other inmates,.

‘including’ that Maxwwell-is' housed/alone,.the nature: of the charges, and. the potential.

stress for inmates that can arise in high-profile cases. The MDG‘has determined that
these factors necessitate more frequent safety and security checks. The Government
also indicates that the prohibition.on, eye masks is a generally applicable’policy,, but
that!Maxwell, like other inmates, ‘may use other-‘noncontraband. items to cover her
eyes. To the extent that.Maxwell's April 29, 2021. letter asks the Court to override

‘BOP's determination. as to’the frequency of appropriate safety and security check:
‘procedures, that:request-is denied. as factually unsubstantiated and legally unsupported.

Certainly ‘nothing :in the:record ‘plausibly establishes that.current protocols interfere
‘with Maxwell's ability” to prepare for hertrial arid communicate with her lawyers.

‘Defense counsel's May 7,,202.1 letter, Dkt. No. 272, describes generalized. grievances
‘but-makes ‘no additional. specific and ‘supported application. for. ‘relief. Nevertheless, the:

Court urges the MDG to: consider whether sleep disruption for pretrial, detainees can;be

tedticéd. “The Coirt.also admonishes the MDC and the Government to continte’to

ensure that Maxwell is subjected to only those security’protocols that: BOP determines
are necessary for her safety’ and-sccurity, based upon, neutral and applicable factors,
and consistent.with the:treatment of similarly situated pre-trial detainees. The
Government shall, provide a copy of. this Order to, the Warden and General Counsel for

‘the MDC.,SO: ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alison, J..Nathan, on 5/14/2021) (nl):

‘Redactions to Defendant's Supplemental Pre-Trial Motions... ENDORSEMENT: The

Court grants ‘in.part‘the Government's redaction and sealing: requests. Its-conclusion is
guided by the three— part test articulated by the. Second Circuit:in.Lugosch, v. Pyramid
Co. of ‘Onondaga, 435 F.3d.110 (2d Cir: 2006). The Couit conéludes that these até

accessiattach. Id. at.11920.-In balancing: competing considcrations: against the:

‘presumption of ‘access, the Court finds that the: arguments the ‘Government has put

forward in this letter, including'the need to, protect-the privacy-interests of third parties

and alleged victims, favor'the narrowly tailored redactions. Sec United States v.
