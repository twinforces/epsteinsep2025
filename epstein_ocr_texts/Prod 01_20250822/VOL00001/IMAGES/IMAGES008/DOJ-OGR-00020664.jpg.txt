Sternheim dated 05/10/2021 re: Request for November 8th trial start date (Sternheim,
Bobbi) (Entered: 05/11/2021)

05/11/2021 277 | ORDER as to Ghislaine Maxwell: The Court has considered the parties' proposals
regarding the commencement of trial. Dkt. Nos. 275, 276. For the reasons stated in the
Government's letter, the Court will request November 29, 2021 from the Clerk's Office as
the trial start datethat is the date (pending approval from the Clerk's Office consistent
with the SDNY COVID protocols) that opening statements will be made to the jury.
However, the Court will also request from the Clerk's Office that jury selection occur
during the week of November 15. Counsel shall plan accordingly. The Court grants the
Government's motion to exclude time until November 29, 2021. The Court finds that the
ends of justice served by granting an exclusion from speedy trial computations for the
period from today's date through November 29, 2021, outweigh the interests of the public
and the Defendant in a speedy trial, because this time is necessary to permit the defense
to continue to review discovery and other materials in light of the superseding indictment;
to permit the parties to prepare and file motions in limine; to permit the parties to make
and review additional pretrial disclosures; and to allow adequate time for the parties to
prepare for trial. Time is therefore excluded under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. ยง
3161(h)(7)(A), until November 29, 2021. In order to ensure that there is no delay in the
commencement of trial, the Court will adjust the current pre-trial schedule. So that the
Court can resolve motions in limine in advance of the November 29th trial
commencement date, any such motions shall be fully briefed no later than four weeks in
advance of the anticipated trial commencement date of November 29. The parties shall
meet and confer to propose adjustments to other pre-trial disclosures accordingly. The
parties are hereby ORDERED to meet and confer for at least 30 minutes by phone
regarding the overall pretrial disclosure schedule and submit a joint letter by May 14,
2021. The Court will accept only a joint letter with a joint proposal or with each sides
views briefly stated. The letter must attest to the meet and confer. Any separately filed
letters will be struck. SO ORDERED. (Time excluded from 5/11/2021 until 11/29/2021)
