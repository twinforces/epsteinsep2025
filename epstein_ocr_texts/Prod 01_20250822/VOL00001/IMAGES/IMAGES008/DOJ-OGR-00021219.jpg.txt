Epstein:massages that were:sexual.in nature, and.that.Epstein:had used “various types; of pressure”
to avoid: ‘prosecution. by'the state, including hiring attorneys who had.personal connections to the
State Attorney. Villafatia said that part-of. her goal 1 in speaking to Acosta:and Sloman at the outset
ofthe federal investigation.was to sensitize them to the tactics Epstein’s' legal team would likely
employ. Villafana.cxplained, “When. you-have-a case that you-know people are going to be getting,
calls about .. you jlist Wantto make sure that:they know about it-so'they don’t get... acall from
out of the-blue.” According, to: Villafafia,, she: told Acosta‘and Sloman that the EBIwas willing;to
put the: necessary:resources into ‘the: case, and. she was-willing to ‘put. in the time, ‘but. she: “didn’t:
occurred, with the state. She told OPR, “I remember specifically saying to-them that I expected.
the case would. be tine and, resotirce-intensive and. I did. not-want to invest the tine andthe FBI’s
resources if. the Office would, just back down to pressure at.the end.” According, to ‘Villafana,
Acosta-and Sloman promised 'that“if the evidence is there, we will prosecute the case.” Ina later
email to Lourie and her immediate supervisor, Villafaiia recounted that she spoke: with Acosta and
Sloman because she “knew that what has happened to the state.prosccution.can.happen to.a, ‘federal.
prosecution ‘if theU.S. Attorney isn’t on-board,”’but.Acosta and Sloman had given, her“‘the green
light” ‘to go forward withthe Epstein.investigation:

Both. Acosta and Sloman. told OPR that they did not. recall the July 2006 meeting with
Villafana. Each told OPR. that atthe time the federal investigation was initiated, he had not.
previously‘heard of Epstein.”

Acosta-‘told OPR. that he understood from the ‘outset.that.the case involved.a wealthy man
who was “doing sordid. things” with gifls, and that it“*seemed a reasonable matter to pursue”
federally. Epstein’. s wealth and status did. not.raise any concern forhim, because, as Acosta told.
OPR, the USAO-had.prosecuted “lots of influential folks.” When asked’by OPR-to articulate the:
federal, interest. he perceived at the time to be implicated. by. the ‘case, Acosta ‘responded, “the:
exploitation ‘of. girls, or minor, :-females.” Regarding Villafafia’s view. that she had, been. given a

“green light” to ‘proceed with the investigation, Acosta told OPR. that he would not likely have
explicitly told, Villafatia to: “tgo spend your, time” on the case; rather, his practice-would have been.
simply to acknowledge the. infotiiation she shared about the case atid confirm, that!.a federal.

‘inv estigation * ‘sound[ed] reasonable.”

Sloman told OPR ‘that he: could not recall what he initially knew about the: Epstein
‘investigation, other than that he had.a ‘basic, understanding that.the State Attorney’s Office had.
“abdicated their responsibility” to. investigate and prosecute Epstein. In his OPR interview,
Sloman did, not recall with, specificity. Villafafia’s, concern. about. Epstein’s. team. pressuring, the
State Attorney’: 's Office, but he said he was never concerned that political pressure would affect,
the USAO, noting'thatias; of July:2006,:the USAO had.recently prosecuted wealthy:and politically
