Kenneth E. Brown, Esq.
Linda Childs, Esq.

As previously noted, I intend on filing a motion for dismissal based on selective
prosecution. If successful, this motion will entitle my client to additional discovery beyond what
has previously been provided which also pushes the trial timeline beyond April of 2020.

My client’s position is also that we are entitled to any and all reports, memorandums,
witness statements and investigative reports written, produced or possessed by the inspector
general regarding this incident and the Federal Bureau of Prison’s policy regarding written
statements and employee conduct.

It should be noted, that it took the justice department, the FBI, the inspector general’s
office and an assortment of other federal agencies more than 90 days to investigate this matter.
Accordingly, it is more than reasonable that it would take the defendant and his counsel, who
have less than one percent of the man power and resources of the government, a significantly
longer time to accomplish an adequate investigation and review of all the necessary information
provided in this case.

Respectfully yours,

/s/ Montell Figgins
