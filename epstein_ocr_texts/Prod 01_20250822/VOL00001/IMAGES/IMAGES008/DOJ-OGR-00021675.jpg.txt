that it will not institute any criminal charges against
any potential co-conspirators of Epstein, including but
not limited to” four named individuals, none of whom
was Maxwell. (A.178). Indeed, Maxwell was neither a
party to the agreement nor involved in negotiating its
terms. This provision “appears to have been added
‘with little discussion or consideration by the prosecu-
tors.’” (A.140 (citing SA195, 211)). The NPA continues
that, “upon execution of this agreement, and a plea
agreement with the State Attorney’s Office, the federal
Grand Jury investigation will be suspended.” (A.178).
The agreement was executed on September 24, 2007
(A.182), and Epstein pleaded guilty in state court on
June 30, 2008 (SA137). In 2019, the Department of
Justice Office of Professional Responsibility conducted
an investigation into the negotiations around the NPA
and issued a 290-page report containing detailed fac-
tual findings. (SA1-348).

After the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern
District of New York (““USAO-SDNY”) charged Max-
well in this case in the Southern District of New York,
she twice moved to dismiss the charges on the ground
that they were barred by the NPA. The District Court
denied the motions, concluding that “the NPA does not
bind the [USAO-SDNY].” (A.140-45, 189-92).

B. Applicable Law

This Court has long held that “[a] plea agreement
binds only the office of the United States Attorney for
the district in which the plea is entered unless it af-
firmatively appears that the agreement contemplates
a broader restriction.” United States v. Annabi, 771
