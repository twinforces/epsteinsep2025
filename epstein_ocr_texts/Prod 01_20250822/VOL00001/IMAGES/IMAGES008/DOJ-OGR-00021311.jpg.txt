The next day, Villafafia asked Goldberger to change the plea agreement by inserting the
word “imprisoned” after “6 months,” and Goldberger agreed to do so. Villafafia, however, did not
ask that the agreement be amended to clarify that the reference to “the Palm Beach County
Detention Facility” meant the jail, rather than the Stockade. The final signed plea agreement form
further clarified the sentence, providing that after serving 12 months in the Palm Beach County
Detention Facility, Epstein would be “sentenced to 6 months in the Palm Beach County Detention
Facility . . . to be served consecutive to the 12 month sentence,” followed by “12 months
Community Control.” The word “imprisoned” was hand written after “6 months” but then crossed.
out and replaced by “jail sentence.”!”

A. June 30, 2008: Epstein Enters His Guilty Pleas in State Court

Epstein, with his attorney Jack Goldberger, appeared in Palm Beach County court on
June 30, 2008, and entered guilty pleas to the indictment charging him with one felony count of
solicitation of prostitution and to a criminal information charging him with one felony count of
procurement of a minor to engage in prostitution.’”* At the plea hearing, which Villafafia and the
FBI case agent attended as spectators, Assistant State Attorney Belohlavek did not proffer the facts
of the case; instead she only recited the charging language in the indictment and the criminal
information:

[B]etween August 1, 2004 and October 31, 2005, the defendant in

Palm Beach County did solicit or procure someone to commit

[prostitution] on three or more occasions. And .. . between

August 1, 2004 and October 9, 2005, the defendant did procure a

minor under the age of 18 to commit prostitution in Palm Beach

County also.'”

The court found this to be “a sufficient factual basis to support the pleas,” and engaged in
a colloquy with Belohlavek regarding Epstein’s victims:

The Court: Are there more than one victim?

Ms. Belohlavek: There’s several.

co-located with the Palm Beach County Sheriffs Office. Both were administered by the Sheriff’s Office.

she learned later about the change from “imprisoned” to “jail sentence.”

of the charge as the factual basis for the plea was the typical practice for a state court plea.
