MS. DONALESKI: Your Honor, with respect 'to modifying
the travel restrictions, we have no objection to in¢eluding her
travel restriction to 'thé Middle District of PennsSylvdnia.

With wespect to the firearm, defense counsel raised
this in front of Judge Netburh last week, who Had 'the
opportunity to consult with pretrial services. She denied this
request, as your Honor should do.

We respectfully submit it 1s due to the safety
conéerns of préetridl Services ‘that the defendant Should not be
permitted to possess her firearm, The pretrial services
officers have to go ifitto the defendant's Horie, including at
unscheduled visits, and, due to their safety concerns with
having a defendant who has access to a firearm and they may n6t

know where the firearm jis in the home, it's entirely reasonable

for prétrial services to say as a policy defendants have to
sunrender their firearms.

This i8 dohe ih every case, your Hond6r, including law
enforcement officers who ane on pretrial services supervision.
Defendants aré required to give their firearms back or to.

surrender their finearms simply for the safety of the pretrial
services 6fficers who are going into their homes. And given
that, safety concern, we believe that it is appropriate, as
Judge. Netburn found, for that. to be a conditidn of hér réleaseé.

THE COURT: The removal of the firearm is a2

commonsense safety measure. The application is denied.
