1 MS. DONALESKI: Your Honor, with respect to modifying
2 the travel restrictions, we have no objection to including her
3 travel restriction to the Middle District of Pennsylvania.

4 With respect to the firearm, defense counsel raised

iy this in front of Judge Netburn last week, who had the

6 opportunity to consult with pretrial services. She denied this
7 request, as your Honor should do.

8 We respectfully submit it is due to the safety

9 concerns of pretrial services that the defendant should not be
10 permitted to possess her firearm. The pretrial services

11 officers have to go into the defendant's home, including at

12 unscheduled visits, and due to their safety concerns with

13 having a defendant who has access to a firearm and they may not
14 know where the firearm is in the home, it's entirely reasonable
15 for pretrial services to say as a policy defendants have to

16 surrender their firearms.

17 This is done in every case, your Honor, including law
18 enforcement officers who are on pretrial services supervision.
19 Defendants are required to give their firearms back or to
20 surrender their firearms simply for the safety of the pretrial
21 services officers who are going into their homes. And given
22 that safety concern, we believe that it is appropriate, as
23 Judge Netburn found, for that to be a condition of her release.
24 THE COURT: The removal of the firearm is a
25 commonsense safety measure. The application is denied.
