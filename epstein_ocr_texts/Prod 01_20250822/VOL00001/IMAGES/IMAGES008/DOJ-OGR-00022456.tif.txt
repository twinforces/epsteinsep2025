1 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Oh, I did meet Leon.
2 I do know Leon.
3 TODD BLANCHE: When do you remember -- and
4 again, I know we're talking about a very long time
5 ago, but do you remember approximately when you met
6 him?
7 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: I could have met Leon,
8 not really -- so I might have met him, nothing to do,
9 because Leon Black is very good friends with other
10 friends of mine. I would've met him, when I say
11 socially, I might have met him. How Leon and Epstein
12 became really good friends, I don't -- I'm not sure.
13 TODD BLANCHE: But not through you, as far
14 as you recall?
15 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: No. Not through me as
16 far as I know. No. I -- in fact, I'm -- I'm sure
17 that's not through me.
18 TODD BLANCHE: Do you know what kind of
19 work Mr. Epstein was doing for Mr. Black over the
20 years?
21 GHISLAINE MAXWELL: Same as what he did
22 for Wexner.
23 TODD BLANCHE: So we just talked about two
24 individuals. And again, I know we're talking about
25 a, maybe a 15-year time period or even longer.
