4, Late July 2006: The State Indicts Epstein, and the USAO Moves
Forward with, a Federal Investigation

‘Several. days after Villafana spoke with Acosta and ‘Sloman, on July:19, 2006, Assistant.
State Attorney. . Belohlavek presented. the case 'to the state: grand jury.”* Krischer told OPR ‘that.
“the whole thing” “was put.before the grand jury. According to a statement:made atthe time by, the:
State Attorney’s Office spokesman, the grand:jury was'‘presented with alist of charges from highest
to lowest,, without. a recommendation by the:prosecutor,.and deliberated-with the prosecutor out-of
the room.”* ‘The state. grand jury. returned an indictment:charging. Epstein with one countof felony
solicitation of prostitution, inviolation of Florida Statute § 796.07, a felony under state law because:
it alleged three of ore instances of soligitation.> ‘The indictment did. fot, identify the person or
persons solicited:and made no:mention of the fact'that:Epstein had:solicited minors.** On.July 23,
2006, Epstein, self-surrendered to be. arrésted..on, the:indictmeént, but was not. detained, and. the
charges were:made public.

Villafafia told OPR that she decided}to'move forward with the federal investigation at'that
point. because she believed the State Attorney’s Office would permit Epstein. to: enter a plea to a
reduced nisdemeéanor: charge < and that once he-entered a guiltyplea, the Department’s Petite policy
might preclude a federal prosecution.” °7 Villafafia told OPR. that at. the time, she “aeliniely
believed that we were goirig to proceed ‘to [a, federal] indictinent, assuming that ....we had
sufficient evidence.”

“ Villafafia and the FBI] obtained.and examined records:of:the'state grand jury proceeding. and.Louric:reviewed,
them. Because.ihe: grand jury records: havenot been ordered ‘released ‘publicly, OPR:docs:not discuss their substaiice.
