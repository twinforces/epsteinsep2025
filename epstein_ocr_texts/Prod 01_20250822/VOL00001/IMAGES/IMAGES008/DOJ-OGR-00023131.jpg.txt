Why don’t we agree to mutual recission [sic] and indict him?
Acosta also weighed in, sending both Villafafia and Sloman an email with a subject line
that read “This has to stop,” in which he stated:

Just read the letter.

1. We specifically refused to include the provision saying that
we would not communicate. IfI recall the conference call, we told
him we could not agree to a gag order using those words.

2. The purpose of the agreement was not an out of court
settlement. Seems that they can’t take no. Let’s talk re how to
proceed. I’m not sure we will ever agree on a letter [to the special
master about how to select an attorney representative] at this point.

Notwithstanding Acosta’s assessment and prediction, after Sloman sent to Lefkowitz a new
draft addendum and they spoke by phone, the parties reached agreement on the addendum’s
terms.'*7

On October 25, 2007, Sloman sent a letter to the person whom the USAO had selected to
serve as special master, outlining the special master’s duties. A few days later, on October 29,
2007, Epstein and his attorneys Lefcourt and Sanchez signed the NPA addendum.'** Villafafia’s
name was printed as the USAO representative, but at Villafafia’s request, Sloman signed the
addendum for her on behalf of the USAO.

Villafafia later emailed Sloman thanking him for “the advice and the pep talk,” which
apparently related to the defense attorneys’ allegation of impropriety concerning her initial
selection of the private attorney to assist the victims. Villafafia explained to Sloman:

The funny thing is that I had never met (and still haven’t met) or

spoken to [the private attorney] before I asked him if he would be

willing to take on this case... . But as soon as you mentioned the

appearance problem, I saw where the problem would arise and

agreed that the Special Master would be a safer route. I just worry

that the defense’s attacks on me could harm the victims.
Sloman responded that defense counsel had “put an . . . insidious spin” on Villafafia’s role in
proposing the private attorney, but Sloman added, “I hope that you understand that these ad
hominem attacks against you do not diminish in our eyes what you and the agents have
accomplished.”
17 Acosta and Villafafia were copied on this email.
148 The Addendum is attached as Exhibit 4 to this Report.
