Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN. Document 204-3 Filed 04/16/21 Page 154 of 348

the: prosecutor: indicted him on. more ‘serious charges. Hayes ‘was thereafter convicted and
sentenced under'the new indictment. The state court of: appeals. rejected. Hayes’s challenge to his.
conviction, concluding. that. the: prosecutor’ s decision to: indict on :more:'serious charges: was:ia
legitimate use of available leverage. in the plea-bargaining:process. Hayes filed. for review of his
conviction. and sentence in. federal court, and although Hayes lost at the district court. level, the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circtiiti concluded that the prosectitor’s conduct constituted,
impermissible vindictive prosecution.

‘The Supreme Court reversed the Sixth Circuit’s ruling. The Court opined that “acceptance
of the basic legitimacy of ‘plea bar ‘gaining: necessarily implies rejection. of any: notion. that:a guilty
pleas: involuntary i in a constitutional sense simply . because it is the end result. of the bargaining
process:’ “Td. at 363. A long as the prosecutor has probable cause. to believe a crime has been
committed, “the decision whether or not: to prosecute, and. what charge. to file of bring before a,
grand.jury, rests entirely in:his:diseretion.” Jd. at 364 (emphasis‘added). The Courtexplained that.
selectivity in enforcement of the criminal law is nét improper unless based’ upon an unjustifiable:
standard such. as race, religion, or. other arbitrary classification.. Jd.

These principles were reiterated ‘in, Wavte'v. United States, 470 U.S. 598. (1.985), a case
involving, the government? s policy of prosecuting only: those individuals who repor ted themselves
as having failed to register with the Selective Service system. The petitioner in, Wave claiined
that the self reported non- registrants: were™vocal” opponents of the: registration program who were
being punished for the exercise of their First Amendinent-tights. The Supreme Court-fejected this
argument, stating that the.government has “broad discretion” in deciding-whom to prosecute, and.
that ‘the limits of that discretion are réached only when the. prosectitor’s decision. is based on. ai.
unjustifiable standard. Jd: at.607-08. Because:the passive enforcement policy was not intended 'to
have a discriminatory. effect, the claim of selective-prosecution failed.

In.Imbler-v: Pachiman, 424 U.S. 409 (1.976), the Supreme-Court considered whether a state
prosecutor: acting’ within, the:scope of his duties.could be sued under 42'U.S.C.§ 1983 for violation.

ofthe defendant’s constitutional: rights when. the defendant alleged that the prosecutor and others
had unlawfully conspired ‘to charge and, convict him. The Cotrt held that “in initiating a
prosecution and. in ‘presenting, the: State” s case,” conduct that. is “intimately ‘associated. with. the:
judicial phase of the criminal process,” the prosecutor enjoyed. absolute iinmunity froma civil suit
for damages. Jd. at-430-31. In Harrington'y. Almy, 977 F.2d.37 (1st Cir. 1992), the court applied
Imbler toa challenge to a prosecutor’s decision not-to-prosecute. The court-noted.that.“given the
availability of immunity for the decision fo charge, it becomes even more important ‘that
symmetrical. protection, be available :for the decision. not io :charge.” Jd. at 4.1 (emphasis: in.

original).

Finally, in, an analogous area of the law, in. Heckler +. Chaney, 470 U.S. 82.1 (1985), the
Supreme Court concluded that an agency’s decision-not to undertake: an enforcement.action. is not.
reviewable under the federal Adininistrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. $$ 500-706.
