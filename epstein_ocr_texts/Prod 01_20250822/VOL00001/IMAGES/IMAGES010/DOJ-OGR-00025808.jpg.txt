Can you not just move him to another cell? He will not have lunch in Attorney Conference. He will go back to
his cell to eat. He knows this.

He also complained that he is in Attorney Conference from about 8 AM to about 8 PM each day and he said
yesterday he only received one meal, a sandwich at about 4:15 PM. He said he should be getting lunch and
dinner.
Also additional information on the toilet that reportedly flushed for 45 minutes. He stated to avoid the
toilet from doing that again because he stated he found it so aversive and disorienting, he has been
urinating in a cup. | already sent an e-mail tof about the toilet.
