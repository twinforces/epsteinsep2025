I know this sounds like pure paranoia, But I have a strange feelimg something might happen to Epstein, I've also heard (BG) OME) Jas recently been
2 Major alleged criminals in close proximity can be dangerous.
especially with 2 conflicting individuals who have a huge impact on our current environment.
I don't know about you but if I was an angry prisoner and was given an opportunity to hurt a child sex trafficker, as a parent, you never know what could.
All I'm asking is please take precaution and be careful.
I would prefer if his case goes to court, and he stays alive after his alleged cult-like island and all the people connected/ Involved to get the same.
