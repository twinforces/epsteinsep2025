Institution Response: 12. Staffing:

The Drug Abuse Coordinator position is currently a shared position. The Warden has re-established the Drug Abuse

Coordinator position as a full-time position to provide the Psychology Department with an additional supervisory

psychologist to perform critical clinical services. At the current time, the position is pending selection.

We are currently in the process of requesting to hire a Staff Psychologist position to provide additional psychological

services to inmates in the SHU, including therapy sessions with PSY ALERT, CC2-MH and CC3-MH inmates who

are currently housed there. An additional psychologist could also monitor Hot List inmates arriving to the SHU and

ensure they are housed with appropriate cellmates. This psychologist could conduct daily rounds to look for signs of

psychological distress and address the concerns of our Long Term SHU inmates. Finally, an additional Staff

Psychologist could assist with our daily crisis interventions and suicide risk assessments.
