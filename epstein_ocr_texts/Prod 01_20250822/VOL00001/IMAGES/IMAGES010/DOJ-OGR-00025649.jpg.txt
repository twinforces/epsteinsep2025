Thanks. This is helpful. We can talk tomorrow about the timing.
It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC I’ve seen additional press reports trying to link the staffing
shortages, overtime and this incident.
Thanks,

as discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all this. I will need to ensure
staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a
lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US
Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.
