9. Attorney Log Books
Please provide a copy of the log book audit.
Institution Response:
The audit revealed the Random Visitor Log Book did not reflect visitor pat searches after May 19, 2019. In
addition, the log book does not offer a column to annotate a staff witness. The Contractor/Volunteer Log
Book was not always filled in properly. The Law Enforcement Log Book was up to date; however, the time of
departure was not always documented. The Attorney Log was missing inmate register numbers and more often
than not was legible. There was no Visitor Denial Log created. The audit conducted on September 25, 2019, is
attached for your review.
