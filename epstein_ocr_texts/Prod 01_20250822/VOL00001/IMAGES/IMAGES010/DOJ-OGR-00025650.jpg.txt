***Inmate Message Below***

| just spoke with an inmate who came out of the SHU last night. His room was directly next to
Epstein's and?'*).. was anxious to describe the night of his neighbor's death. Jeffrey Epstein definitely killed
himself. Any conspiracy theories to the contrary are ridiculous|?""\..__ factually heard Jeffrey tearing up his
sheet before committing suicide. | askeditio lf the SHU had been extraordinarily noisy and uncivilized as a
prelude to Jeffrey killing himself. He responded in the negative - effectively refuting my theory that Epstein
couldn't take the animals in the SHU and chose to end it as a result. | no longer believe that rooming with
Jeffrey would have saved him. He wanted to kill himself and seized the opportunity when it was available
(when his bunky moved out). Such is life - or death in this case.
Friday is my home confinement date and clearly, the staff hasn't done its job although the law specifically
states that the BOP is required to let all inmates with the appropriate risks and needs (which | am) serve 10%
of their sentences at home. | know this isn't part of your domain. But anything you could do to get me out of
here when the law says | should be released (two days from now) would be most appreciated.
