There has been an incident with a high profile prisoner (Jeffrey Epstein) at MCC New York. We are
trying to get some basic information about the incident and are having a hard time getting any
information out of the facility. Is there someone we could speak to and get the basic information? The
USM and Chief for our S/New York office are having no luck with the Warden and Assistant Warden.
