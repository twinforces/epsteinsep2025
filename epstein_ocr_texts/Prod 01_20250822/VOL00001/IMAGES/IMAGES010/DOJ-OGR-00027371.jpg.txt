having previously taught mathematics and physics. He has been observed pacing the cell as well as sleeping, eating,

made known to the lieutenants and he was provided a shower prior to attending his legal visit. This writer also provided
him a toothbrush, toothpaste, and hygiene products.
Reason for Removal from Watch
Mr. EPSTEIN stated, "I have no interest in killing myself." He explained although his situation is "not perfect" due to his
being incarcerated, he noted he has "lots to do for [his] legal case." He described having a "wonderful life," to include
interactions with "interesting people and projects." He said "it would be crazy" to take his life. He furthered, "I would not
do that to myself." Mr. EPSTEIN did express a feeling of safety being housed on Psychological Observation rather than
in the SHU. He asked if he could remain on this status for a couple of days, he was advised his housing situation will be
re-evaluated on a day-to-day basis. He expressed a desire to be housed in general population rather than in the SHU
and asked if there were a "safer" unit for him to be housed in comparison to the one where he was initially placed. Mr.
EPSTEIN claimed there were many MS-13 gang members on the initial unit. He was advised he will be maintained on
Psychological Observation in the near future, but his long-term housing situation will be revisited, as it is not ideal for
one to remain in isolation on Psychological Observation for extended periods of time. Mr. EPSTEIN acknowledged this
information and thanked this writer for her explanation and time.
