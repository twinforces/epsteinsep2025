neck) may be impaired because of his sleep apnea. He is supposed to get his CPAP machine today. He is
aware he will be returning to SHU, but said he is feeling unwell due to his inability to sleep and numbness in
his arm. He requested to have one good night of sleep with his CPAP and will return to SHU with a cellmate
tomorrow. | told him he
can stay down one more night to receive his CPAP and a good night's sleep, but that he would be returned

A ipper-Scott,
Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.
He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse" saw him.
He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He
also said he has numbness on his neck. | informed Nurs
He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is
going to try the toilet before going to legal today and if it does not shut off, he will be moved to another
cell.
Thanks,
