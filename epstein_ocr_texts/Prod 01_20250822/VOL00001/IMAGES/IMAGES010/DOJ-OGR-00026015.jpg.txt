Boi) Pry to bother you with this:
Update: We got over 30 inquiries. My boss is drafting a very short answer that will probably say we don't
comment on an inmate's health status or conditions of confinement for privacy reasons.
My boss had me call MCC NY just now to be sure they are not releasing varying statements to the media, we
want the institution & me to use the same exact statement to all media (we'll give them the statement we
come up with shortly and be sure they're fine with it) and they just told me you're acting will call me back
shortly.
Last thing - | didn't realize he went to the hospital, | might ask your acting exec. if he's still at the hospital or
how long there, etc., if that's true (news article say he went to a hospital).
