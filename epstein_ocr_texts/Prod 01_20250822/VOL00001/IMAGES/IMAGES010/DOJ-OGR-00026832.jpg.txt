External brainstem landmarks and cranial nerves are normal. Vessels at the base are distributed
normally, and have no atherosclerosis. The cerebellum is normal.
Coronal sections of the cerebral hemispheres reveal normal cortical ribbon, white matter, and deep
gray nuclei. There is no midline shift. Hippocampi are symmetrical and of normal volume.
Ventricles are normal in size and appearance.
Axial sections of the brainstem and cerebellum en bioc show the substantia nigra and locus
ceruleus to be well-pigmented. The aqueduct and fourth ventricle are normal. Cerebellar cortex,
white matter, and dentate are normal.
