which is double the drop in the prison pop. This is highly misleading. As you know (and AG Sessions and
DAG Rosenstein were also acutely aware of), over the 5 years leading into this administration our prison
population had dropped 40,000 inmates, but our staffing had gone up (and pop has continued to drop
another almost 9,000 since the start of the Administration)! The drop in staffing that they are referring to
also likely includes the 5156 unfunded vacant positions that were eliminated...positions we never could fill in
the first place.

that will listen (and have reiterated this in several Hill briefings), the problem is not our authorized staffing
levels or funding, rather it is finding good candidates to come work for us in hard to fill areas. | have dozens
of examples where we post jobs, get 30 applicants and only 10 end up actually coming on board. At that
rate it will take a long time just to fill the vacancies we have. We are working on several new initiatives to try
and make BOP more attractive to applicants (unfortunately news like this does not help).
