AW Skipper-Scott,

| saw him before his Legal visit. He seems stable and is now at his Legal visit. I'll be coming in tomorrow before his Legal visit to see him again.

He complained about being dehydrated because he stated he cannot drink enough water because of limited bathroom breaks in Legal since he stated he s«
