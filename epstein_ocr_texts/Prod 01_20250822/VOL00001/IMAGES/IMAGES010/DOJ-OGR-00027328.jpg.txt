If you happen to get this tonight, maybe you can call me on my cell at 202-32/2°".. | My boss may want to
answer this reporter tonight, but before we send an answer perhaps like the one below we wanted to see for
our own internal awareness what you may know about this if any of it is true in regard to Epstein.
My mobile Samsung is not always receiving emails and leaving work now, so my personal cell by calling the
number above is best if you get this.
Thanks so much,

While | will probably reply to this reporter with something like my draft below which doesn't reveal much if
anything, nonetheless we want to be sure we understand from you or the institution what if anything may
have happened with inmate Epstein. Could you see if the institution can look into this and provide us with
what they may know for our internal purposes (not for release to media)? We will reply to media inquiries
about Epstein (not the institution) since stories about him are national news (unless we finalize an answer that
we could give to the institution to use as well if media ask about this tomorrow).
Thanks,
