A message from use, 7 O TT who sent an email from www.bop.gov.
| know this sounds like pure paranoia, But | have a strange feeling something might happen to Epstein, I've
also heard PeCee mms recently been placed in the same institute.
2 Major alleged criminals in close proximity can be dangerous.
especially with 2 conflicting individuals who have a huge impact on our current environment.
| don't know about you but if | was an angry prisoner and was given an opportunity to hurt a child sex
trafficker, as a parent, you never know what could.
All I'm asking is please take precaution and be careful.
| would prefer if his case goes to court, and he stays alive after his alleged cult-like island and all the people
connected/ Involved to get the same.
