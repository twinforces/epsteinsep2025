The list of visitors from our office is below:
As discussed, we would like to see the 2™ floor pscyh observation and suicide watch area; the 9" floor
SHU, and Epstein’s cell, which we understand to still be cordoned off. As discussed, we would
appreciate if only MCC legal would escort us, and we will not speak to any of the guards present given
the ongoing investigations. Please give me a call with any questions, and let us know what time and
where we should go, and if it would be easier for us to enter via the 3" floor bridge.
Thanks,
Assistant United States Attorney
Southern District of New York
