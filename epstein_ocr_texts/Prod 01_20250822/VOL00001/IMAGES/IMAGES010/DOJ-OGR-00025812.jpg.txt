(2Â°... las discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all
this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so
they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other
wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting
with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.
