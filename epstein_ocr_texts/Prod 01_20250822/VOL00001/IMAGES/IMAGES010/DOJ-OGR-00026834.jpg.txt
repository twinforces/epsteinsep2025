The thyroid cartilage is almost entirely ossified and the cricoid cartilage is partially
ossified. The thyroid exhibits two fractures: one to the left superior horn and one to the right
superior horn (Figures | and 3). The fractures to both the left and right superior horns occur just
superior to the junction with the lamina. The cricoid does not exhibit any fractures.
