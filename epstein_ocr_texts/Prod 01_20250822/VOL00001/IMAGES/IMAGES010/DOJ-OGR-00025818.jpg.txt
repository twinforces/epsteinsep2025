Thanks. This is helpful. We can talk tomorrow about the timing.
It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC I’ve seen additional press reports trying to link
the staffing shortages, overtime and this incident.
Thanks,

Re; Jas discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all this. I will
need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off
guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the
Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this
probably should be some time after that interview.
