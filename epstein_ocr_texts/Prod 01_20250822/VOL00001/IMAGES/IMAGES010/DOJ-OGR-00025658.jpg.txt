[Bric fs discussed, several options are below. Please note that we need to discuss timing of all
this. I will need to let my Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no
doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other wardens. Also note that the Warden just
called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this
probably should be some time after that interview.
