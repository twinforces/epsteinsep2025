A couple of days og hee documents and | forwarded it to you in an e-mail[P" "is
requesting a copy of the post orders (general orders) for suicide watch. He also asked for the sign-in sheets
for the suicide post orders for staff who were sitting on Epstein during his suicide watch. Do we have a copy
of this in the Lieutenant's office as well as the post orders? If there are not specific post orders, | think we
should get a copy of the quarterly post orders to demonstrate that the officers who sat on inmate Epstein
signed for the quarter."

Good morning all. | apologize | was not in attendance mainline today, but Central Office called me just
before mainline commenced to request some documents and information regarding inmate Epstein. | was
speaking on the phone with" whom you both met during the suicide reconstruction.
[7 jinformed me not to do an update to the institutional supplement for suicide watch as it is not
required by policy or suggested. He stated Psychology should only be doing an institutional supplement
for Psychological Observation as there is no specific policy for it. | had recently updated the Psychological
Observation Procedural Memorandum which | will attach here. | have not updated the SW supplement for
several years as it was noted that policy did not require or suggest one any longer.
Also" § requesting a copy of the post orders (general orders) for suicide watch. He also asked for
the sign-in sheets for the suicide post orders for staff who were sitting on Epstein during his suicide watch.
Do we have a copy of this in the Lieutenant's office as well as the post orders? If there are not specific post
orders, | think we should get a copy of the quarterly post orders to demonstrate that the officers who sat on
inmate Epstein signed for the quarter.
