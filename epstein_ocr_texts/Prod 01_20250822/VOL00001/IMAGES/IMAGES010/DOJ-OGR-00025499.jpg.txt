Hugh/Ray: Can you verify that the information below is accurate? It’s based in large part on the timeline you sent.
Is there any reason why this information shouldn’t be released to the public?

evaluations while on suicide watch.
On July 29" Epstein was removed from suicide watch by Psychology Services Department at MCC-New York after daily
interaction with him and according to established procedures. Epstein was returned to the Special Housing Unit (SHU)
with a requirement that he have a cellmate. He was with same cellmate from that date until August 9". In addition,
the SHU confinement includes frequent head counts as well as 30 minute checks.
