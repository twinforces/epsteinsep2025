[rice ps discussed, several options are below. Please note that we need to discuss timing of all this. I will need to let my
Executive Staff know so they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other
wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting with him at 10 am tomorrow.
So this probably should be some time after that interview.
