If you are emailing about an inmate that may be at risk for suicide or self-harm, this is an emergency
situation. Please make sure that you make contact (verbally) to Psychology Staff or the on-call psychologist.
Please ensure to maintain constant visual observation of the inmate until formal steps can be taken to ensure
his/her safety pending a formal assessment by a Psychologist.
