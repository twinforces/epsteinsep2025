surfaces of the intra-abdominal organs, and an oblique, 6.5 cm laceration of the liver to
the left of the falciform ligament (artifacts of resuscitative chest compressions).
CLOTHING:
The body is received clad in a hospital gown.
INJURIES, EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL:
These injuries are described in reference to standard anatomic planes. These injuries
are grouped and labeled for descriptive purposes only; no sequence is implied.
A. HANGING:
There is a depressed, focally dried and abraded, noncircumferential ligature furrow of

. the neck that peaks slightly on both sides of the neck, more steeply on the right side
than on the left. On the right side of the neck, the furrow bifurcates anterior to the ear,
with one arm that peaks behind the right ear and one arm that extends to the right side
of the back of the neck. On the back of the right side of the neck at the end of the
lower arm of the furrow is a 1/2" x 1", irregular, red abrasion. The furrow ranges from
13-3/4" to 15” long (measured from both ends of the furrow on the right), and ranges
from 1/8” to 1/2" wide. Anteriorly, the furrow passes over the thyroid cartilage. On the
upper edge of the right side of the furrow beneath the chin is an adjacent, % x 1”,
inverted V-shaped, linear abrasion that ranges in width from 1/8” to 1/4". Beneath the
left side of the mandible is a faint, 1/2" x 1-3/4", irregular, red abrasion with multiple,
interspersed, deeper, red abrasions that measure up to % x 3/8”. .
The face and head are plethoric above the furrow, with petechial hemorrhages of the
face that are most marked within the eyebrows. There are multiple, petechial
hemorrhages of the palpebral conjunctivae of both eyes, and confluent hemorrhages on
the periphery of the right bulbar conjunctiva. There are faint petechial hemorrhages on
the mucosal surfaces of the upper and lower lips.
Within the parenchyma of the tongue are multiple, focal, spotty, purple hemorrhages.
There is diffuse, purple hemorrhage at the base of the tongue. There are no
hemorthages of the anterior strap muscles of the neck. Posteriorly, there is a single
hemorrhage in the ieft, deep, paraspinal muscles.
Both thyroid cartilage cornuae are fractured, and the left cornua of the hyoid bone is
fractured, all with accompanying soft tissue hemorrhages. See also “Anthropology
Report.” There are no fractures of the cervical vertebrae.
B. OTHER INJURIES:
On the back of the left forearm is an oblique, 1”, linear, red, abrasion with an adjacent,
1/2" x 1-1/4", faint, red abrasion. On the media! aspect of the back of the right wrist is a
1/8" x 1/2", faint, red contusion, and on the medial aspect of the back of the left wrist is a
