Below is the definition of Psychological Observation provided ye Chief Psychologist. He

will remain on Psychological Observation until tomorrow, where he will be reassessed.

DEFINITION: A Psychological Observation occurs when an inmate who suffers from a mental illness, a
serious personality disorder, a medical problem (impairing their mental status), or drug
intoxication and/or withdrawal symptoms begins to deteriorate. The inmate is no longer
mentally stable and therefore, it is inappropriate for s/he to remain in general population or the
Special Housing Unit (SHU). Inmates placed on psychological observation differ from inmates
placed on suicide watch as they are not imminently suicidal (e.g., have not expressed self-harm
or engaged in self-harming behavior), but rather, due to his/her impairment in mental status or
functioning (e.g., not eating, not sleeping, disorganized/unusual thinking, poor self-care), his/her
behavior can be unpredictable. Psychological Observation status is intended as a temporary
designation to be utilized until such time as the inmate becomes sufficiently stable (e.g., able to
function independently in general population) to be returned to his/her housing assignment or
transferred to an inpatient psychiatric facility such as a Federal Medical Center.

He has a pending incident report for Self-Mutilation and therefore, he will return to the Special

His Case has been highly publicized and he is in SHU because

he requested Protective Custody.
