Ok, this is going to be sensitive. Cant say I'm surprised people want to be cautious. | will want to hear about
specific examples of significant problems. Why sending to RDs and not to all CEOs? All CEO memo will need
Exec staff and union clearance first, but it will ensure the message gets out. We can discuss tomorrow.

Subject: Inmate Suicide Prevention Memo

Hugh,
Wanted to give you the heads up, there is an Inmate Suicide Prevention Program Memo in your mailbox that
you will probably want to review tomorrow. | discussed it with today.
Basically following inmate Epstein's suicide, Wardens are defaulting to leaving inmates on suicide watch
longer than the institutional Psychologists would advise. So the memo to the RDs seeks to remind Wardens
to utilize the professional psychological expertise of the institutional psychologists in managing
inmate suicide through the variety of healing strategies. [?\°).._ is in the office tomorrow, 10/18, if you want
to discuss with her the best way to communicate this to the RD and Wardens and if you have any questions.
Have a great day. Peace-[? "0. |
