| believe we are meeting again tomorrow. Please review the attached, in particular the highlighted sections
and the additional language in section 11 moved from section 9.
Cap - can you have someone address section 4 as it alleged staff wrote him a shot without having all the
appropriate evidence to back it up and section 9 as to when the attorney logbooks were pulled?
Thanks all,
