For sake of speed, |?) jand | decided for me to pass along to you quickly this very rough draft for the
second inquiry pertaining to MCC NY below for you to review and edit as needed and send back tdeeic lor
NERO review (just like the last email andi... {will get back to me). To be sure I'm clear, as background do
you know if AW Skipper Scott & case manage" | were working at MCC NY before Epstein's death or
anything the reporter might be wondering about them (feel free to not answer if part of the Epstein
investigation, I'm ignorant of names involved):
Question from Fox News:
Hi there can you confirm whether case manage" | is still working with SHU inmates at MCC or
has he been transferred to a different caseload , unit or facility after Jeffrey Epstein death? Also can you
confirm the status of Assistant Warden Shirley Skipper Scott?
(eS)
We decline to comment as the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and Department of Justice's Office of Inspector General.
