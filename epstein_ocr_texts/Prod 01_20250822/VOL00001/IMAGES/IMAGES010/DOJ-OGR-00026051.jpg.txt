notified if suicidal ideation is apparent from the responses. Further, any BOP staff member may place
an inmate on suicide watch.

The Suicide Prevention Program at each BOP facility is administered by a Suicide Prevention Program
Coordinator. The Program Coordinator, who must be a doctoral-level psychologist, ensures compliance
with suicide intervention and prevention policies, which include training, identification, referral,
assessment, and intervention. In BOP facilities, suicide watch is typically a short-term and highly
restrictive intervention measure. Every institution has one or more rooms designated specifically for
housing an inmate on suicide watch. These areas are set aside as special cells, typically in the BOP's
Health Services division, which allow staff to maintain a safe environment for the inmate without
compromising the ability to observe and protect the inmate. This environment includes easy access to
the room, privacy, unobstructed vision of the inmate at all times, and limited availability of objects,
materials, or architectural features that would allow for easy self-injury. Inmates on suicide watch are
evaluated daily by apsychologist and are constantly observed by either staff or inmate companions.
Once an inmate is placed on suicide watch, the watch may only be terminated by a BOP psychologist
following a face-to-face evaluation with the inmate.

With regard to staffing levels, 15,012 correctional officers are currently working at the BOP and 1,654
correctional officer positions are vacant as of August 3, 2019. The BOP continues to work on hiring and
retaining staff nationally. As you are aware, the Epstein case is currently under investigation by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Justiceâ€™s Office of the Inspector General. The
BOP is also conducting an After Action Review and a Suicide Reconstruction Review. The BOP will assess
any additional measures which should be taken after those processes are completed.

The factors that lead an inmate from suicidal ideation to suicidal behavior are complex. Those factors
include an individual's access to means (e.g., pills or razors), opportunity (e.g., privacy to implement a
plan), motivation, and subjective feelings of defeat or humiliation.

The USA Today's top reporter (who's written front page stories on the BOP) is asking if BOP is "designating
specific officers to regularly monitor surveillance video in segregated housing units and other locations
where inmates are at some risk for suicide."
