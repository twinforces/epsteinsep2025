FROM: Psy.D., Ph.D., Forensic Psychologist | PPP
SUBJECT: Epstein #76301-054
This memo summarizes the psychology contacts with Mr. Epstein.
Mr. Epstein arrived on July 8, 2019, and was seen by psychology services for an intake screening in SHU. He
denied any psychology history or symptoms. The Chief Psychologist spoke with Central Office on July 8, 2019,
and it was determined he should be placed on suicide watch and seen for a suicide risk assessment after he
returns from court due to his increased suicide risk factors. Mr. Epstein was seen on July 9, 2019, for a suicide
risk assessment where he denied any suicide ideation, intention, or plan. Despite his risk factors of his sex
offence charge, high profile case with media attention, and pretrial status housed in SHU, his protective factors
outweighed his risk factors. He was future oriented, wanted to fight his case, and denied any mental health
history or suicidality. He was removed from suicide watch and placed on psychology observation. He was seen
the following day at which time he requested to be celled alone if housed in SHU and was told he could not. Mr.
Epstein was released from psychology observation and seen on July 11, 2019, in attorney conference. He
expressed concerns such as wearing an orange jumpsuit, not receiving medication, and not having enough water
during attorney visits. Mr. Epstein was seen one week later, July 16, 2019, for follow up and because he was
asking to be seen. He did not express any psychological concerns, rather correctional issues such as not getting
a phone call and needing a spoon. An attempt at a SHU review was made on, July 18, 2019; however, Mr.
Epstein was with his legal team.

Mr. Epstein was seen daily while on psychology observation, each day denying he was suicidal.
During one interview, he claimed he could not remember what happened because of his “sleep apnea.” On July
30, 2019, Mr. Epstein was removed from psychology observation and returned to SHU. He reported he did not
think he could sleep in SHU because of the noise. He denied any psychological concerns. It was noted he
would be placed with a cellmate.
