Hugh,
1. The attached spreadsheet has three tabs with counts on Attempts, Self Harm and Placement on Suicide
Watch for all of our institutions between 2014-2018 and it was shared with IPPA.
2. This is a reporter's question sent to IPPA along with our response and my recommendation for adding
more information.
(4) Also, does BOP have any special initiatives under way to help reduce the numbers? What is BOP’s
response to the union's contention is staffing shortages is at the root of the problem?
3. The second attachment is a collection of data Psychology Services does every year. 2018 and 2017 will
likely have one more death added to each year. This were discovered this week, one at CAA and one at an
RRC that PSB was never notified about.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
(DMT HC}
