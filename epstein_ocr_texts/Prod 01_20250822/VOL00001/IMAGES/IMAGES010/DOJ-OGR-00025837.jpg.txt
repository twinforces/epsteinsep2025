I'm a reporter with BuzzFeed News. I'm reaching out on a story regarding Jeffrey Epstein's death. We have
found a series of posts that were made on the website 4chan prior to any public announcement of Epstein's
death. The first post was made at 8:15 AM and the subsequent posts described in detail the first responders’
actions. The first news report about Epstein's death was at roughly 9 AM.
I've pasted one of the posts below.

Can you verify the accuracy of what's been posted? Would speaking publicly about an inmate's death break
any procedures? If so, does MCC plan to take any action on the matter or investigate it?
Please get back to me as soon as possible today.
Thank you,
