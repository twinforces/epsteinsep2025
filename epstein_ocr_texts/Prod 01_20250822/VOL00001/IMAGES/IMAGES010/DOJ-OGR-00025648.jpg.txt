Thanks. This is helpful. We can talk tomorrow about the timing.

It will also be helpful to get some information about staffing at MCC I’ve seen additional press reports
trying to link the staffing shortages, overtime and this incident.

Thanks,

(oC? MC)

Subject: Draft language

as discussed, several options are below. Please note that we should discuss timing of all

this. I will need to ensure staff are notified first, and I should let my Executive Staff know so

they are not taken off guard as they will no doubt get a lot of questions from their staff and other
wardens. Also note that the Warden just called Ray and told him the US Attorney is meeting

with him at 10 am tomorrow. So this probably should be some time after that interview.
