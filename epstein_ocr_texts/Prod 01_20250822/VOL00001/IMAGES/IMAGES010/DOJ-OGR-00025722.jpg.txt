Inmate Epstein seems psychologically stable.
He complained that his right arm was numb and hanging earlier. Nurse eee aw him.
He again said his right arm still feels somewhat numb and he said he cannot make a fist with that hand. He

He stated the toilet in his cell was running for 45 minutes last night and he could not take the noise. He is
