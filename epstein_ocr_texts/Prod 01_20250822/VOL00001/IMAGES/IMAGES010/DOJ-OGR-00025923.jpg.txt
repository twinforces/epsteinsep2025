A couple of issues came out of the Epstein Reconstruction which | wanted to problem solve when you have
an opportunity to meet:
Other issues regarding the SW program:
1. We need to ensure the Unit 2 Officer is making rounds each hour and signing the log book. While the
officer is back there, if an inmate companion needs to utilize the bathroom he should be allowed to do so.
Inmate Companions have been urinating in the garbage cans out of desperation.
2. Inmates on suicide watch need to be fed as timely as possible.
3. Inmates on suicide watch need to receive showers on M, W, and F.
4. Suicide Watch mattresses are being taken from our area to be used in GP. They are specialized and
expensive mattresses.
5. If my orderly brings dirty smocks to the elevator, can internal bring them to the laundry in the basement?
Dirty Smocks are getting misplaced or thrown away.
6. Lt.'s need to strip out the inmate going on suicide watch and thoroughly search the inmate companions
coming down for contraband and inappropriate items. If the inmate companions bring down contraband
for the inmates on Suicide Watch, they will be terminated.
7. Lt." need to search the suicide watch room before inmates go into the room on suicide watch.
8. Lt.'s need to ensure inmates on suicide watch are placed in a smock without clothing, glasses, etc. unless
otherwise indicated by a psychologist and with on the front of the log book.
