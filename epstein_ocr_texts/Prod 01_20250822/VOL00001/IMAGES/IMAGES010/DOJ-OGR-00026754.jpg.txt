A staff member must observe all inmates confined in a continuous locked down status, such as administrative
detention or disciplinary segregation, at least once in the first 30 minute period of the hour (example, 12:00
a.m. — 12:30 a.m.) followed by another round in the second 30 minutes period of the same hour (example, 12:30
am — 1:00 a.m.), thus ensuring an inmate is observed at least twice per hour. These rounds are to be conducted
on an irregular schedule and no more than 40 minutes apart. All observations must be documented.
