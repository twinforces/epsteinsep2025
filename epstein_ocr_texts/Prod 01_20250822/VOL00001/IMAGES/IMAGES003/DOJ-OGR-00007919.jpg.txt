1 gaining access and isolation, trust development,

7 and to the stages.

8 Q. I want to direct your attention to Page 4. What is this

9 table?

10 A. So these, as I mentioned, there was an original list of

11 about 77 specific behaviors that have been found associated

12 with grooming in the literature fairly consistently. These are
13 the behaviors that were part of that original list, where

14 perhaps there were more differences of opinion, but the level
15 of agreement among the professionals in this particular study
16 did not reach the level of statistical significance.

17 Q. What is your takeaway from the study in the article?

18 A. I think this is a study that has really done a good job of
19 integrating what we know and pulling together the literature,
20 and then putting it to an empirical test. There have been
21 other ways to empirically understand and test what is referred
22 to as grooming. I think this is another way that provides some
23 validation of a proposed model of the ways in which grooming
24 works.
25 MS. POMERANTZ: You can pull that down. I'd like to
