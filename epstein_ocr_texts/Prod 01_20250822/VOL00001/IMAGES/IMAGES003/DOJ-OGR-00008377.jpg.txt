1681-83).

«0 Scarola was ‘present for Carolyn’s the-mectings the Government listed by the defense. (Tr.

1684; Def. Letter at 3-4).

e Carolyn reccived $2,804,000. from the Epstein Victims Compensation Program, not.
counting the $446,000 she had previously, received from her claims ‘against. Epstein, and.

Sarah. Kellen (Tr: 1688-89).

Accordingly, the defendant-has already obtained through Carolyn.much of the:testimony it.
anticipates from,Searola. There is no need for Searola to testify to information ‘already obtained,
from Carolyn, and. it obviously does not impeach Carolyn for Scarola to confirm her answers.

Nearlyvall of additional testimony the defendant proposes to clicit:from Scarola is irrelevant
and.non-impcaching. It does not:matter that Scarola is a member of the Florida bar (Def. Letter‘at:
2), nor are the additional specifics of the Government’s unsuccessful efforts to. contact Carolyn.
probative (id. at 3).' It says nothing about Carolyn, that Scarola. copied, counsel for other victims
on an email. (id. at 2). Noric of that, information impceachés Carolyn’s testimony. in any way—
rather, it is entirely ‘consistent with. her testimony.”

The defendant argues this ‘testimony ‘is relevant; to “establish the timeline of ‘Carolyn’s
cooperation ‘with the government and her motive and bias in ‘testifying against Ms. Maxwell,.in.

particular the ‘fact that: Carolyn, was unresponsive and uncooperative until there: was the: prospect:

' The Government would stipulate to the specific dates of meetings between Scarola, Carolyn, and.
the:Government. \(Sce Def. Letter at:3-4).

* The defendant would also clicit. from Scarola that, during a 2020 meeting, Scarola told the
Government that he had shown.Carolyn:a. picture of. the Epstein.associate with:the same:name:as
Jane, but ‘Carolyn could not:identify the person.at the time. But the defendant-did not:ask Carolyn.
about,that:person, so this testimony would not impeach Carolyn—to the extent it is not privileged.
