it intends to offer at trial ... in the Government’s production today or in its previous
productions.” And, circumnavigating this Court’s Order with Magellan-like skill, promised that,
as the government “continues to prepare for trial” it will produce any additional co-conspirator
statements “in connection with its ongoing obligation to produce Jencks Act material.” See, Ex.

I. The Government Failed to Identify Any Purported Co-Conspirator

Statements

For a statement to fall within the definition of Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E), “a court must
find (1) that there was a conspiracy, (2) that its members included the declarant and the party
against whom the statement is offered, and (3) that the statement was made both (a) during the
course of and (b) in furtherance of the conspiracy.” United States v. Tracy, 12 F.3d 1186, 1196
(2d Cir. 1993). These conditions precedent are “[p]reliminary questions concerning ... the
admissibility of evidence” as referenced in Fed. R. Evid. 104(a), and must be proven by a
preponderance of the evidence. United States v. Daly, 842 F.2d 1380, 1386 (2d Cir. 1988).

The Court may consider the coconspirator statements themselves in determining whether
the 801(d)(2)(E) prerequisites have been met. However, because “these hearsay statements are
presumptively unreliable,” United States v. Tellier, 83 F.3d 578, 580 (2d Cir. 1996), there must
be independent corroborating evidence of the existence of the conspiracy and the participation
therein of the declarant and the defendant. Jd.

II. Ongoing Document Dumps Containing Thousands of Statements Do Not

Satisfy the Court’s Order to Disclose

The government neither objected to Ms. Maxwell's request for disclosure nor the Court’s
Order requiring disclosure at the same time. See Dkt. 317 at 12, n.1 (citing Dkt. 291 and Dkt.
293). The government’s reason for not wanting to disclose the statements was considered and
