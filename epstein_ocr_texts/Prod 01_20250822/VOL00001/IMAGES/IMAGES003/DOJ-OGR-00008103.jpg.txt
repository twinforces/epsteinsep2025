3. Dr. Hall’s opinions are not unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403.

The government’s Rule 403 argument is easily resolved. As the government well
knows—and as it likes regularly to remind criminal defendants—yjust because evidence is
prejudicial to a case or defense does not mean it is unfairly prejudicial. United States v. Schaffer,
851 F.3d 166, 182 (2d Cir. 2017) (“[T]the fact that evidence ‘may be highly prejudicial’ does not
necessarily mean that it is ‘unfairly prejudicial.’”). There is significant probative value to Dr.
Hall’s opinions. And the risk of unfair prejudice is minimal, and certainly not enough to
substantially outweigh the probative value of the opinions. Robinson, 583 F.3d at 1275 (“The
probative value [of mental health condition evidence] was not substantially outweighed by the
danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.”). Dr. Hall will not
engage in name-calling or shaming, and neither will Ms. Maxwell. “This is not a case in which a
party attempts to unfairly malign a witness for distant and relatively minor mental health issues”
or unrelated and irrelevant drug use. See id. If the Court is concerned about any unfair prejudice,
that concern can be addressed with a limiting instruction.

4. Rule 703 does not bar Dr. Hall from testifying.

The government makes a last-ditch effort to preclude Dr. Hall from testifying by
invoking Rule 703. That Rule recognizes the reality that expert witnesses form their opinions in
reliance on evidence that might not itself be independently admissible—e.g., hearsay.

Here, however, Rule 703 poses no barrier to Dr. Hall’s testimony, because the bases of
his opinion are independently admissible and, even if they weren’t, their probative value
substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.

Federal Rule of Evidence 703 says:

An expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has been

made aware of or personally observed. If experts in the particular field would

reasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject,
