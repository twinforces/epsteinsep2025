3. Dr. Hall’s opinions are not unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403.

The government?s Rule:403 argument; is casily‘resolved. A's the government well
knows—and as it likes regularly’to. remind ‘criminal. defendants—just' because evidence is
prejudicial to a ‘case or defense does not:mean, it is ‘wfairly prejudicial. Wnited States v. Schaffer,
851 F.3d 166, 182(2d Cir. 2017) (“[T]the fact.that.cvidence ‘may’ be highly*prejudicial’ does net.
necessarily:mean: that it' is ‘unfairly: prejudicial.’”). There is significant probative value to.Dr.
Hall’s opinions. And the risk of unfair prejudice is minimal, and.certainly not. cnough,to:
substantially. outweigh the ‘probative ‘valuc of the opinions. Robinson, 583 F.3d. at 1275 (“The
probative value [of mental health condition evidence]'was not substantially outweighed by: the
danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or'misleading the jury.”). Dr. Hall will:not
engage in nanic-calling or shaming, and neither will Ms. Maxwell. “This is not.a.cas¢e in which a
party attempts to unfairly malign a witness for distant and relatively-minor mental-health issues”
or unrelated, and irrelevant drug use. See id. If the Court:is concerned ‘about any ‘unfair prejudice,
that concern, can be addressed with a limiting institiction.

4. Rule 703 does not bar Dr. Hall from testifying:
The government:makes a. last-ditch effort, to preclude Dr. Hall from testifying by

invoking Rule'703. That Rule recognizes the reality that expert witnesses form ‘their opinions if

reliance on evidence that might not itself be independently admissible—e:g:, hearsay.

Here, however, Rule ‘703 poses. no barrier'to Dr. Hall’s'testimony, because the, bases of
his Opinion ave independently admissible and, even:if they wercn’t, their probative valuc
substantially outwcighs their-prejudicial effect.

Federal Rule of Evidence 703: says:

An expert may base:an opinion.on facts or data ‘in the case that the expert.has been

made aware: of or personally observed. If experts in. the particular ‘field would
rcasonably-rcly'on those kinds of facts or data. in forming an opinion.on the subject,
