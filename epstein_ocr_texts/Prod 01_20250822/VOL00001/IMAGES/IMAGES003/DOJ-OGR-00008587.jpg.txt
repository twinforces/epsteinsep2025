Second Element: Membership in the Conspiracy’

With respect to cach. of Counts: One, ‘Three,, and.Five, if you conclude that the

Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the relevant conspiracy existed, and that

the conspiracy had, the objéct: 1 just mentioned, then ‘you. must 'néxt, consider’ the: second, element:

namely, whether Ms. Maxwell knowingly and willfully participated in. the conspiracy knowing

its‘unlawful purpose and intending to further its unlawful, objectives.

In. ordérto, satisfy’ the. Second clement of Counts Onc, Thrce, of Five, the Government.
must prove: beyond.a reasonable doubt that Ms. Maxwell knowingly and willfully entered into
the conspiracy charged in the particular'count witha criminal intent=that; is, with a purpose to
violate. the law—and that she:agreed to take part.in the conspiracy to further promote and
cooperate in:its unlawful objective.

“Willfully” and “Knowingly”

An act is done “knowingly” and “willfully” if it is done deliberately and purposely—that.

is, Ms. ‘Maxwell’s actions must have been,her conscious objective rather than'a,product ofa

mistake or accident, mere. negligence, or Some other innocent reason.

To:satisfy its: burden. of proof'that:Ms. Maxwell willfully-and knowingly became a
member of a conspiracy to.accomplish an unlawful:purpose, the Government:must prove beyond
a-reasonable. doubt that.Ms. Maxwell knew’that:she was.a member of’an operation or conspiracy
to accomplish that:unlawful purpose, and that, her:action of joining such an operation, or
corispiracy was not due to carelessness, negligence, or mistake.

Now, as I have said, knowledge is a matter of inference from the proven facts. Science:
has not;yct devised,.a, manner, of looking into a person’s mind'‘and. knowing what that person 1s

thinking. However, you. do have before you the evidence of certain. acts aid:conversations
