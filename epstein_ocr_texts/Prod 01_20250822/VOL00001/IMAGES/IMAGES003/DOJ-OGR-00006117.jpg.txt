Counts One, Three, and Five: Conspiracy to Violate Federal Law â€” First Element: Object
of the Conspiracy
| Count One charges the defendantMs. Maxwell with participating in a conspiracy; from

engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense. The

Count Three charges the defendant with participating in a conspiracy, from at least in

object of the conspiracy charged in Count Three of the Indictment is to transport minors with
the intent to engage in sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal

that those elements be done, then the transportation of minors with the intent to engage in
sexual activity for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense objective would be
proved.

for which any person can be charged with a criminal offense. For the sexual activity alleged in
