Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document.563. Filed 12/18/21. Page 41 of 167

offense with which Ms. Maxwell is charged, and.that, Ms. Maxwell aided, abetted, counscled,
commanidéd, induced or procured 'that-pérson to commit the crinic.

As you can.see, the firstarequirement is that another person.has committed,the crime:
charged.. Obviously, no one can.be convicted of aiding and ‘abetting the criminal,acts of another
iftho crime was ‘committed by the. other person. But if'you do find that a crime was committed,

To,aid or:abet another to. commit;a crime; ‘it-is necessary that the Government prove that:
the Defendant willfully and.knowingly associated herself in some way with.the crime committed
by the other person, and willfully and knowingly. sought by.some act fo help the crime succeed.

However; Ict me. caution you that the mére presence of the defendant'where a crimes
being committed, even when coupled with knowledge by the defendant that a crime is being
committed, or the mere acquiescence by .a,defendant in the criminal, conduct of others, even, with,
guilty Knowledge, is:not sufficicnt t6 make. the defendant guilty under this. approach of aiding
and abetting. Such a defendant would be guilty: under this approach of aiding and abetting only
if, in addition. to knowing of the criminal activity, she actually: took: actions, intended to help it:
succeed.

An aider and. abcttor must know that, the crime is being committed and, act,in a way. that ‘is
intendéd to bring about the success of .a.criminal. venture.

To determine whether Ms. Maxwell. aided. or.abetted the commission of the crime: with.
which she is.charged, ask, yourself these questions:

iL, Did the. Defendant participate in. the crime, charged as. something she wished.to

bring about?
