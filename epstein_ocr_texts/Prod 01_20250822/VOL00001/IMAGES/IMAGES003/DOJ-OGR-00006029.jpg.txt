ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Court is in receipt of the parties’ proposed redactions to the parties’ motions in
limine, responses in opposition, replies in support, and related exhibits. As the Court indicated at
today’s conference, some of the parties’ proposed redactions are overbroad considering the
three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435
F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). In particular, for the reasons stated at today’s conference, the Court
denies the Government’s request to redact section ten of the Government’s motion in limine. See
Dkt. No. 380. The Court will also not permit redactions pertaining to the general description of
evidence or anticipated testimony as such redactions are unnecessary to protect the privacy
interests of the individuals implicated. Accordingly, the parties must propose more tailored
redactions consistent with the Court’s discussion at today’s conference.

The parties are ORDERED to submit the proposals to the Court via email by November
4, 2021. In order to facilitate the Court's review of the requests, the Court requires the parties to
submit the proposed redactions as a single document and with the proposed redactions
highlighted. The Defendant's proposed redactions should be highlighted in one color, and the
Government's a different color.

The Court will rule on the proposed redactions expeditiously.
