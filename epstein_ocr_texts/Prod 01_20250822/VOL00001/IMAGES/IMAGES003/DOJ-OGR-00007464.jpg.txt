Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:
Pursuant to the Court’s Order at Dkt. No. 482, the Government seeks redactions to Exhibit
1 to the defendant’s response to the Government’s motion to preclude the testimony of Dr. Dietz
and Dr. Loftus. The Government’s proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test
articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.
2006). Although the parties’ supplemental briefing and the Court’s Opinion & Order are judicial
documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the limited proposed redactions are
narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of the Minor Victims and third parties, including
individuals who have not identified themselves on the record in this case, and who are subjects of
the Court’s pseudonym order.
The Government does not seek redactions to the defense response or the Court’s Opinion
& Order. The defense has informed the Government that it is not seeking any additional
redactions.
