Dear Judge Nathan:

Pursuant.to'the Court’s Order at. Dkt. No. 482, the Government secks redactions to'Exhibit.
1 to’the defendant’s response to the Government’s motion to preclude the testiniony of Dr. Dictz
and..Dr. Loftus. The Government’s proposed redactions are consistent. with the three-part. test.
articulated by the Sccond ‘Circuit:in Lugosch. v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 11.0 (2d ‘Cir.
2006). Although the partics? supplemental briefing arid ‘the. Court’s Opinion & Order are judicial
documents subject to the common law-presumption, of access, the limited proposed redactions are
narrowly. tailored to ‘protect the privacy interests of the Minor Victims and third-parties, ‘including’
individuals:who have not identified themselves: onthe record in.this case, and’who are subjects of
the Court’s. pseudonym order.

The Government does riot seck redactions to the defense response or'the Court?s Opinion
& Order. The: defense: ‘has informed ‘the Government that it is not sccking any: additional

redactions.
