patients are’ telling the truth.” (Def. ‘Mot. 3. at 6). The defendant claims that this “fatally
underminés the reliability of her opinion” because her conclusion has “no known. oridentified rate
of error... nor is there.a.rcliable method or a scrics of factors guiding Rocchio’s conclusion as to
whether an ‘individual victim is fabricating her abuse.” (/d:, (alterations and, quotation. marks.
omitted)). Clinical, psychologists are: riot so eredulous. .As part of Dr. Rocchio’s work as a.
practicing clinician, she examines consistencies and inconsistencies in the information provided.
by patients and assesses ‘patient ‘self-reporting in’the context of literature and knowledge that. she
has developed ‘in her years of practice. As the Government’s expert notice makes: clear,, Dr.
Rocchio ‘has treated, hundreds ‘and. hundreds of patients in her decades. of experience, and her
opinions are based ‘in part on the significant patterns she has observed. among the:paticnts she has
treated. The Court should. reject: the: defendant’s speculative claim that Dr. ‘Rocchio has been.
misled.by hundreds of patients who sought professional treatment for'traumatic-cvents that did not.
occur,

In. any event, the defendant’s argument about ‘error rates: misunderstands the: nature ofa.
Dauberfinquiry. An crrorrate is but one of the Datibert factors that:may or‘may'not be applicable
in. every: case. See Romano, 794 F.3d at.330. .And:in cases such as this,:where a social science
expert is testifying bascd-on qualitative methodology, that:factor‘is inapplicable. See. Lorres, 2021
WL 1947503, at *6n.8. As'the Second. Circuit has explained, “Péer review, publication, potential
error rate, etc... . are not.applicable to this ‘kind of testimony, whose reliability depends heavily:
on the, knowledge:and experience ofthe expert, rather than'the: methodology or'theory behind it. In,

such ‘cases, the place to quibble with [an. cxpert’s] academic training is on cross-cxamination.. . .
