Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 404 _ Filed 11/02/21 Page4of6

1 there is something that would be too difficult or embarrassing for you to say on the public record,

2 please let me know. And please keep in mind that if you are selected as a juror, we will continue

3. to refer to you only by your juror number throughout the process.

4 Now, if you are selected as a juror, your job is going to be to listen to the evidence and to

5 my instructions on the law and to make a determination that's based only on the law. So I want to

6 speak to you generally about some things to keep in mind.

7 The first thing is, as Ms. Maxwell sits here now, she's presumed to be innocent. She is

8 presumed innocent until and only if the jury finds that she is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.

9 As Ijust explained to you, she's been indicted for a number of crimes, but an indictment is just
10 anaccusation. It is not evidence and it doesn't mean that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of anything. You
11 can't assume that she is guilty or more likely to be guilty just because she's been charged with
12 committing these crimes. That's the reason we have trials, to determine whether the Government
13. can prove a defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. A defendant in a criminal case does not
14 have to prove that she is not guilty. That means a defendant does not have to testify, or to put on
15 any evidence and a juror can't hold that against a defendant if she makes that choice.
16 The next thing is that as jurors you must follow the law as I give it to you, even if you
17. don't agree with it or if you think the law should be different.
18 You also have to base your verdict on the evidence, not on something that you've read in
19 the newspapers or the internet or seen on television or heard about on social media or in
20 ~~ discussions with friends, family, or colleagues. And you can't base your decision in this case on
21 +something that you might have read or heard about another case.
22 As I said before, there is significant media interest in this case. As jurors you are not
23 permitted to read any news about this case. You cannot read or watch or listen to any accounts
