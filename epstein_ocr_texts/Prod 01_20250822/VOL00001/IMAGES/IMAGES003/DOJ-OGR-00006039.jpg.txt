there ‘is something that:would. be too difficult-or embarrassing for you to'say on the public record,

‘please let me know. And please keep in'mind'that if you aré selected. as a juror, we will continuc

to refer to you ‘only by your juror:numbcr throughout the process.

Now, if you, are selected, as'a.juror, your job ‘is going to be to listen,to the evidence and to

my instiuctions on the law and:to make a.dcterniination that's based only on:the law. So I want.to,

speak to you generally about some things to.kcep in-mind.

The first. thing is, as. Ms. Maxwell sits here now, she's, presumed to, be Innocent. She is
presumed innocent until and only: if the jury finds that she:is guilty beyond.a reasonable doubt.
As I just explained, to you, she's been, indicted for a number of crimes, but an indictment is just
an.accusation. It is not évidence:and it doesn't mean that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of anythinig. You
can't assume that she is. guilty or more likely to be guilty just because she's been. charged with.
committing these crimes: That's the:reason we have'trials, to determine whether the Government
can. prove a defendant's guilt beyond a tcasonable doubt. A:defendant'in a criminal. case docs not’
any: cvidence and ‘a,juror can't hold that against ‘a,defendant. if she makes that. choice.

The next'thing is:that as jurors -you-must follow: the law as.I give itto you, even ifyou
don't agree with it or if you think the law should be different.
the newspapers or the internet or scen on television or heard about: on:social:media or in.
discussions with friends, ‘family, or colleagues. And you can't base’your decision in,this case on
something that you might have read. or heard about another-case.
