Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 447 Filed 11/12/21 Page7of8
at 114. The factors must be assessed in light of the totality of the circumstances, and the linchpin
of admissibility is reliability.

Here, the factors weigh heavily in favor of suppression. J in interviews,
court filings, and under oath, never identified Ms. Maxwell as anyone who abused her in any
fashion. There was no “opportunity” for [to “view the criminal at the time of the
crime” because Ms. Maxwell did not participate in any crime. There was no prior description of
Ms. Maxwell by gg and the length of time between the alleged event and the
suggestive identification procedure was extraordinarily long.

Accordingly, any identification, both out of court and in court, should be suppressed.
