at 114. The factors must be' assessed. in, light of the totality of the circumstances, and the linchpin,
of admissibility is reliability:

Here; the :factors weigh. heavily in favor of. suppression.[~_______] In.intervicws,
court; filings, and under. oath, never identified Ms. Maxwell,as anyone who abused her in any
fashion. There Was no, “opportunity” for[— ___] to. “view the criminal at the time. ofthe.
crime” because Ms. Maxwell did:not participate in.any crime. There:was' no. prior description. of
Ms. Maxwell by[7____] and the length of time between the alleged cvent.and the
suggestive identification procedure was extraordinarily: long.

Accordingly, any identification, both out.of court, and ‘in court, should be suppressed.
