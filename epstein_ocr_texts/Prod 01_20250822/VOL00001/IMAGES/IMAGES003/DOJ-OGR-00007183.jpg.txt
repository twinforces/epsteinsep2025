1 that, my plan is to just do the morning session on Friday,
2 which would give us about another hundred or so people filling
3 out the questionnaire, which is what the target was in the 6 to
4 7 hundred range, presumably about 650 or so. And that will
a give additional time for the parties to confer after they have
6 reviewed and a fewer number of questionnaires to review, given
7 that we got there sooner.
8 Any concerns with that, Ms. Pomerantz?
9 MS. POMERANTZ: No. Thank you, your Honor.
10 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim?
11 MS. STERNHEIM: No.
12 THE COURT: Great. Thank you.
13 I did previously set a tentative hearing for November
14 15th, which is Monday, at 9:30. So that's firm. We'll have
15 that hearing, to the extent we need to, to go over any pre voir
16 dire process resolution of disputed questionnaires and the like
17 if we need to, and talk about that process more.
18 T'll also use it to address any outstanding motions in
19 limine if I can. In particular I think I will then have full
20 briefing, and hopefully be able to address defense motion 1, on
21 co-conspirator statements; defense motion 4, regarding alleged
22 victim 3; and defense motion 7, on Exhibit 52.
23 Tf I'm able to, I'll also address the government's
24 motions regarding exclusion of at least some testimony of
25 Dr. Loftus and Dr. Dietz.
