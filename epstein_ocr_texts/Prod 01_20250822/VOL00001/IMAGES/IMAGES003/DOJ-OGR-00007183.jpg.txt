that, my plan is to just do thé morning séssion on Friday,
which would give us about another hundred or so people filling
out the questionnaire, which is what the targét was in the 6 to
7 hundred range, presumably about 650 or so, And that will
give additional time for the parties to confer after they have
reviewed and a fewer number of questionnaires to review, given
that! we got there sooner.

Any concerns. with that, Ms, Pomerantz?

MS. POMERANTZ: No. Thank you, your Honor.

THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim?

MS. STERNHEIM: No.

THE COURT: Great. Thank, you.

tHat Hearing, to the extent we néeéd tdé, t6 go over any pre voir

dine precess resolution of disputed, questionnaires and the like
if we need to, and talk about. that process nore.
I'll also use it to address any outstanding motions in

lamine if I can. Th particular IT think T will then have full

briefing, and hopefully be able to address defense motion 1, on
c6=tonspirator statements; defense motion 4, regarding alleged
