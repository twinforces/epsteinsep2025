A. Direct Evidence

As the Government argued in its motion, evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 is direct
evidence of the Mann Act conspiracies. The defendant’s conduct regarding Minor Victim-3
overlaps in time and place with the other Minor Victims charged in the Mann Act conspiracies:
Counts One and Three charge conduct from 1994 to 2004 in New York and Palm Beach, and
Minor Victim-3 began giving Epstein sexualized massages in 1994, traveling to meet Epstein and
the defendant in both New York and Palm Beach. The Government expects the defendant’s
relationship with Epstein to be a “‘critical factual dispute’”— specifically, whether that relationship
included conspiring with him and aiding or abetting Epstein’s sex crimes. United States v.
Robinson, 702 F.3d 22, 37 (2d Cir. 2012). Minor Victim-3’s testimony will help establish that it
did.

Evidence relating to Minor Victim-3 also “fills in a narrative” about “why [the defendant]
took actions to” arrange sexualized massages. United States v. Rodriguez, 727 F. App’x 24, 26
(2d Cir. 2018) (summary order). Poe

for the purposes of massage, groom them, and transform the massages into sexual encounters. The
conspirators then traveled with the girls or invited girls to travel, and asked the girls to find others
