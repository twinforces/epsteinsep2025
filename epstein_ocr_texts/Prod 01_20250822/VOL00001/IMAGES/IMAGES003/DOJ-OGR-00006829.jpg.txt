Sexual grooming of children 293

In order to gain access to their victim(s), offenders groom the environment and their
potential victim’s significant others (e.g. parents, carers, teachers, etc). This may mean the
offender integrating themselves into society and places where they are likely to meet children.
This will often be a position of trust. Offenders then begin grooming the adults in this
community, specifically those who are significant to their potential victim, with the aim of
creating an opportunity to access and abuse a child or children. van Dam (2001) reports that
offenders are frequently charming, very helpful, and have insider status. This is often an
important factor in gaining access to potential victim(s). As offenders help out in the
community, they are considering how their efforts will be rewarded later when they can then
abuse the children in that community. Offenders are often able to “read the community like a
book” in that they assess what they “need” and fulfil these needs accordingly (Hare & Hart,
1993). They can make themselves indispensable, too good to be true and will freely undertake
jobs that others do not want to do (Leberg, 1997).

A desire on the part of parents to avoid cognitive dissonance may assist offenders’
grooming efforts. A parent may suffer cognitive dissonance as a result of concerns about the
trustworthiness of the offender alongside their hospitality and acceptance of the offender.
When thoughts do not match behaviour, cognitive dissonance manifests, and often thoughts
are changed to be consistent with behaviour (van Dam, 2001). Thus, offenders gain insider
status long before they start abusing a victim (van Dam, 2001). Grooming is therefore a well-
organized long-term activity (Sanford, 1982). Offenders groom the community so well that if
a victim discloses their abuse, the community may support the offender rather than the victim,
because they deem the offender to be more believable than the child.

In the case of intrafamilial child sexual abuse, offenders are already in a position of trust
and integrated in an environment where they can access potential victims. Some offenders
groom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain this status (Elliott, Browne
& Kilcoyne, 1995). Offenders may do this because they believe that these children are more
vulnerable and because they believe it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with
the child. Alternatively, offenders may target children or young people who have absent
parents, and hence have less protection. In this incidence there is no need for the offender to
groom the parents. They can become the child’s friend and more easily arrange to have time
alone with the child.

Intrafamilial offenders often isolate the victim from their non-abusing parent, siblings
and the outside world by developing an exclusive relationship with the child. For instance,
they may encourage mothers to have more of a life outside the home, which then gives
themselves increased opportunities to abuse their victims. Alternatively, they may isolate non-
abusing parents from the outside world in order to prevent them from having people in whom
to confide about any concerns (Leberg, 1997). Some offenders encourage mothers to develop
an alcohol dependency, in part so that any future disclosures made lack credibility (Leberg,
1997). Other similar strategies employed to limit credibility include questioning the mother’s
parenting ability in front of friends and other family members. This may constitute part of
their strategy for grooming the environment and significant others.

Grooming the environment and significant others can occur as a result of implicit or
explicit planning; alternatively, access to a child may occur by chance. Ward and Hudson
(2000) have developed a conceptual model of how child sex offenders’ implicit planning or
seemingly unimportant decisions (SUDs) implicate their offending behaviour by leading them
to high-risk situations, i.e. contact with children. This appears to be automatic, because
although offenders are conscious of their specific behaviours, they are often unconscious of
the effect of implicit goals on these behaviours.
