Counts One, Three, and Five: Conspiracy to Violate Federal Law — Second Element:
Membership in the Conspiracy

With respect to each of Counts One, Three and Five, if you conclude that the
Government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the relevant conspiracy existed, and that
the conspiracy had the object I just mentioned, then you must next consider the second element:

| namely, whether the-defendantMs. Maxwell knowingly and willfully participated in the
conspiracy knowing its unlawful purpose and intending to further its unlawful objectives.

In order to satisfy the second element of Counts One, Three, or Five, the Government

| must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendantMs. Maxwell knowingly and willfully
entered into the conspiracy charged in the particular count with a criminal intent—that is, with a
purpose to violate the law—and that she agreed to take part in the conspiracy to further promote
and cooperate in its unlawful objective.

“Willfully” and “Knowingly”
An act is done “knowingly” and “willfully” if it is done deliberately and purposely—that

| is, the-defendan?sMs. Maxwell’s actions must have been her conscious objective rather than a
product of a mistake or accident, mere negligence, or some other innocent reason.

| To satisfy its burden of proof that the defendantMs. Maxwell willfully and knowingly
became a member of a conspiracy to accomplish an unlawful purpose, the Government must

| prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Maxwell the defendantknew that she was a member
of an operation or conspiracy to accomplish that unlawful purpose, and that her action of joining
such an operation or conspiracy was not due to carelessness, negligence, or mistake.

Now, as I have said, knowledge is a matter of inference from the proven facts. Science
has not yet devised a manner of looking into a person’s mind and knowing what that person is
thinking. However, you do have before you the evidence of certain acts and conversations
