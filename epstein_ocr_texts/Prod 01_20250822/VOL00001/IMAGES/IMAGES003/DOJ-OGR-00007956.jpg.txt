1 often I've had individuals who, as, you know, older adults, say
2 to me, this is the first time I've ever told anyone, I've never
3 told anyone that this happened.

4 Q. How common is delayed disclosure in the patients you treat
5 and evaluate in connection with your clinical practice?

6 A. It's very common. The majority of the patients that I work
7 with who've -—- who've experienced childhood sexual abuse, like
8 all victims of child sexual abuse, the abuses, a majority that
9 has occur, most likely will occur in the context of a

10 relationship. And we know that the closer the relationship

11 between the victim and the perpetrator, the more delayed the

12 disclosure is.

13 So I would say that it's -- it's certainly not rare

14 but it's not common necessarily that I am always the first

15 person that the individual has told, but it's definitely more
16 common than not that they did not tell someone at the time that
17 it was occurring, that they told at some point significantly

18 later in time.

19 Q. When patients have disclosed that they experienced
20 childhood sexual abuse to you for the first time, were your
21 patients adults or children?
22 A. I would say that when they're making an initial disclosure
23 for the first time, they have been adults, although, when I was
24 working in an inpatient setting at times I, I certainly worked
25 with adolescents who had made disclosure while they were still
