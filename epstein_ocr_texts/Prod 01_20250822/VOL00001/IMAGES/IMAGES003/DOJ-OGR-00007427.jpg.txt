beginning with. a foot massage; (4) whether the defendant’ knew’ those. massages Were, scxualizcd;
girls to find additional girls to ‘massage Epstcin; (7)'whether Epstein and the defendant. invited.
people they had recruited.for sexualized massages‘to travel; and.(8) whether the defendant had any:
motive for doing any of this activity. If the defense wants to concede’that she had this knowledge
and intent, or that she played these 'roles, but only as to adults, it might reduce the probative value:
of evidence related to-Minor Victim-3. See, e.g., United States v. Siddiqui, 699 -F.3d:690, 702. (2d.
Cir. 2012) (“A defendant:may ..... forestall the admission of Rule 404(b) evidence by advaneing a.
theory that makes clear that the object the Rule 404(b) cvidenée sccks ‘to establish, while
technically at.issue, is not really:in dispute.”).* But to the extent. that the defense argues that the:
defendant ‘was, not. aware vt a// that. Epstcin’s massages, were sexualized, for instance, or that. she
played no role ‘in recruiting:masscuses for Epstein wall, this. evidence ‘is highly probative:to rebut.
those arguments.”

At its core; the defense argument ts that the fact that the defendant.and Epstein.recruitéd a.
seventeen-ycar-old in.the United. Kingdom to provide sexualized massages to Epstein and.to'travel
with them’ is.;not probative of whether they recruited,.a, minor in, the United States ‘to provide

scxualized massages to Epstein and to travel with them. The argument is:meritless. This evidence

> Either Way, Minor Victim-3’s testimony would still be relevant at. least on the issue, of motive.
See Siddiqui, 699 F:3d at 702.

* To be clear, the evidence is admissible ‘for the sex trafficking counts aswell as the Mann, Act
counts. See, ¢.g., Curley, 639 F.3d at 59 (“Although the incidents, pre-dated the charged conduct.
by as much as, fiftecn years, collectively they demonstrate a pattern of activity that continued, up
to'the'time ofthe. charged conduct.”); United Statesv. Wibricht, 79 E. Supp. 3d 466, 480.(S.D.N.Y.

2015) (While: the duration. of clapsed time between two events: can. detract: from: the. probative
valuc of the prior event, temporal remoteness of acts does not:preclude their relevancy.” (citations
