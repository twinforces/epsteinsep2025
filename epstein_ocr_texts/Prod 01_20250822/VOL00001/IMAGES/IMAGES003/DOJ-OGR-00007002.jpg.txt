3 THE COURT: I think we've muted everyone.

4 Ms. Williams, can you indicate by text whether you can

5 hear me.

6 OK. And now I'll ask, Ms. Pomerantz, are you able to

7 speak now?

8 MS. POMERANTZ: Yes, your Honor.

9 THE COURT: All right. I think we've done that so I'm
10 going to have Ms. Williams please keep everyone muted until I
11 call on them. That seems, hopefully, to be able to resolve the
12 issue.

13 Go ahead, Ms. Pomerantz.
14 MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor.
15 The government is not aware of any reason why Audrey
16 Strauss's name would come up at trial, so the government
17 doesn't understand the basis for the inclusion.
18 THE COURT: All right.
19 T'll ask for Ms. Sternheim to be unmuted, please, and
20 then mute Ms. Pomerantz while --
21 Go ahead, Ms. Sternheim.
22 MS. STERNHEIM: I am unmuted. And Judge, I just want
23 you to know I have not moved my phone, so I do not think that I
24 contributed to the problem before.
25 THE COURT: OK.
