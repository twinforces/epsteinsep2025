Blackwood, 456 F.2d 526, 530 (2d Cir. 1972)). What Ms. Maxwell proposes for the testimony of
Mr. Hamilton is exactly what the law allows.

The government is quite wrong to suggest that these statements are collateral matters.
“TBlias or interest of a witness is not a collateral issue, and extrinsic evidence is admissible
thereon.” United States v. Haggett, 438 F.2d 396, 399 (2d Cir. 1971). This is not controversial.
E.g., United States v. Diecidue, 603 F.2d 535, 550 (Sth Cir. 1979) (“The bias of a witness,
however, is not a collateral matter and the party examining the witness is not bound by his denial
of acts tending to show his bias.”); United States v. Robinson, 530 F.2d 1076, 1079 (D.C. Cir.
1976) (“Bias is never classified as a collateral matter which lies beyond the scope of inquiry, nor
as a matter on which an examiner is required to take a witness’s answer.”).”

Conspicuously, the government cites no authority for the proposition that Ms. Maxwell
cannot ask Mr. Hamilton about Kate’s statements to him. Gov. Letter, pp 9-10. And although the
government’s letter is not entirely clear, see Gov. Letter, p 9 n.3, the government apparently does
not invoke either Rule 608 or Rule 613 in support of its request to prevent the jury from learning
of Kate’s bias and motive. That’s for a good reason. Kate’s statements to Mr. Hamilton are
neither specific instances of conduct under Rule 608 nor prior inconsistent statements under Rule
613.
