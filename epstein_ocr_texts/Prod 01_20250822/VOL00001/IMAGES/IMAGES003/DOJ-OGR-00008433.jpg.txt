Blackwood, 456 F.2d 526,.530:(2d Cir. 1972)). What Ms. Maxwell proposes for the testimony of
Mr. Hamilton is cxactly’what the law allows.

The government is quite wrong to‘suggest’that'these statements are collateral matters.
‘(Bias or interest: of a'witness is not a, collateral ‘issue, and cxtrinsic evidence ‘is admissible
thereon.” United States. v. Haggett, 438 F.2d 396, 399 (2d Cir. 1971). This.is:not controversial.
E.g:, United States v. Diecidue, 603. F.2d,535, 550 (Sth Cir. 1979) (“The bias of.a witness,
however, isnot a.collatcral matter and the-party cxamining the witness is not bound by his denial
of acts tending to show his bias.”); United States -v. Robinson, 530. F.2d.1076, 1079 (D.C. Cir.
1976) (“Bias is never, classified ‘as a collateral matter which, lics beyond'the scope: of inquiry, nor:
cannot.ask Mr. Hamilton about: Kate’s statements to him. Gov. Letter, pp 9-0. And. although the
government's letter is not entircly:clear, see Gov. Letter, p 9 n.3, the government apparently: does
not invoke cither Rule 608 or Rule: 613 in support of its:request to prevent the jury from learning
of Kate’s bias and motive. That’s for a good reason. Katé’s statements to, Mr. Hamilton are
neither specific instances of conduct:under.Rule 608 nor prior:inconsistent statements. under.Rule

‘613.
