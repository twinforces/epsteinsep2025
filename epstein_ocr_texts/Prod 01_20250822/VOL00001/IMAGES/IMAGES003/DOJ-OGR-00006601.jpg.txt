Corp. 162. F.3d.1,158, at *5 (4th Cir. 1998), (unpublished) (“An ‘expert’ opinion ‘iis considered.
unreliable and inadmissible under Daubert where, as here, the expert has developed the opinions
expressly for purposes of. testifying in the: case, has [herself] performed. no tests or studies that
‘support; [her] opinions, has cited.no peer-revicwed, controlled studies substantiating [her]
opinions, and fails to point'to. some. objective sourec to show that [she has] ‘followed the
scientific method.” (cleaned up)).

3.. Rocchio’s grooming opinions will not assist the trier of fact.

None of Rocchio’s, opinions, about grooming will “assist the tricr of fact to‘understand the:
evidence or to determine a fact in issue.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at. 591“ Fit’ is not always obvious,
and scientific validity for one purpose is not necessarily scientific validity for other, unrelated
‘purposes.”). Asin Raymond and. United States v. Gonyer, the government here “does ‘not proposé
to have [Rocchio] relate [her] gencral.opinions about grooming by sexual predators to the facts
in:this case.” Gonyer, 2012, WL 3043020, at *3. Expert testimony about.gencral principles is
helpful only when it “describe[es] widely recognized and highly‘predictable. and ‘verifiable.
phenomena.” Raymond, 700 F. Supp. 2d at 150 n.1.2; Gonyver, 2012 WL 3043020, at. *3. But
even.Rocchio does net.contend that. ““grooming” is a “widely and highly: predictable and.
verifiable: phenomena.” See. Ex. 1.

Still, without any clucidation, Rocchio claims grooming “often” or “frequently occurs,”
without providing the jury any explanation of how to:decide whether grooming actually occurred,
in:this ‘case. The government thus wants Rocchio to describe her conception. of grooming and.
then, leave it to “a lay jury’without guidance . . . to'apply [her] analyses reliably to the ‘facts ofa.
case in détermining guilt.” Raymond, 700 F.Supp. 2d at 150. That is not how Rule, 702 ‘works.
