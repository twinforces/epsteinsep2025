There are many influences on disclosure that have been identified in the
research literature to help explain why it is that children delay disclosure, are
reluctant to disclose, provide details of their experiences over time or do not
disclose at all. Age has been identified as a significant predictor of disclosure ;
in that younger children are less likely to disclose than older children. Children | “Younger children are

disclose during forensic interviews compared to children who do not disclose
in such contexts (yet concerns remain that they have been abused) are more
likely to have parents (particularly mothers) who are more supportive (Lawson
and Chaffin, 1992), In Priebe and Svedin’s (2008) study of young people,
parental bonding (positive relationship with parent who was not overprotective)
was identified as the most significant predictor of disclosure for both boys and
girls. However, close relationships can also act as an inhibitor to disclosure.

Gender has been found to influence disclosure in that boys appear to be
more reluctant to disclose than girls (Goodman-Brown ef al., 2003;
Hershkowitz et al., 2005; Ungar et al., 2009a). Mental health difficulties on
the part of the child have also been found to be relevant, particularly when
children experience dissociative symptoms or other post-traumatic stress
symptomatology (Priebe and Svedin, 2008).
Some studies have found that the severity of abuse (e.g. penetrative abuse)
predicts earlier disclosure while other studies have found no relationship
between different types of abuse and disclosure timing. Similarly, the relationship
between the duration of abuse — one-off incidents of abuse compared with abuse
that takes place over a significant period of time — and timely disclosure has been
investigated with mixed findings. Fear of the consequences of disclosure has been | ‘Fear of the
