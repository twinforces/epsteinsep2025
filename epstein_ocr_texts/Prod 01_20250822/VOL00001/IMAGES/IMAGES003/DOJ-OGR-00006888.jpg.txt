Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 453 Filed 11/12/21 Page8of52
the Order, however, the government defined the word “disclose” differently. Disclose, as to the
actual statements, according to the government, means “produced” at some time in the past or to
be produced in the future, perhaps as an oral statement during trial.

Of course, the Court will tell the parties whether it meant two completely different things
when it used the same word, as argued by the government, or whether it intended for the
government to disclose the statements it intends to offer as co-conspirator statements. To avoid
delay over this issue during trial, Ms. Maxwell suggests that she cannot litigate this issue in
advance of trial without knowing what statements are being offered under Federal Rule of
Evidence 801(d)(2)(e).

What is clear from the government’s response is not that it misunderstood the Order, but
rather, it continues to disagree with the Order.

B. The Court Has the Authority to Require Disclosure

Second, doubling down on its disagreement with the Court, the government claims “‘t is
aware of no such case” in which a court ordered the identification of anticipated co-conspirator
statements prior to trial. While the government may not be “aware” of such cases, they certainly,
and abundantly, exist.

In United States v. Bocio, 103 F. Supp. 2d 531, 534 (N.D.N.Y. 2000), the court ordered
pretrial disclosure of statements of co-conspirators (Government “must disclose to the defendant
and make available for inspection, copying, or photographing: any relevant written or recorded
statements ..., or copies thereof, within the possession, custody, or control of the government.”).

In United States v. Jacobs, 650 F. Supp. 2d 160, 171 (D. Conn. 2009), the court ordered
co-conspirator statements be produced in advance of trial (“In the case of a co-conspirator who
the government plans to call as a witness at trial, that time is now, and the government is directed
to produce any relevant statement to defense counsel forthwith.”)
