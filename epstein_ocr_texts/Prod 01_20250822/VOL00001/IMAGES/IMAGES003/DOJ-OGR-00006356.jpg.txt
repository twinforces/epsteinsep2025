IV. Sealed.and Redacted Exhibits

The Government anticipates offering certain exhibits entirely under seal or with:redactions
to protect the personal identifying: information of ‘witnesses and, third, parties. With respect to
logistics, the Government would propose submitting, redacted versions of exhibits — along;with an.
index noting which of'the’Government exhibits will be offered under scal;— no later than’November:
29, 2021. To the extent the defense takes issuc with the sealing requests:or the proposed redactions,
the Court may:rule on,those exhibits on, case-by-case basis during the trial.

The Government has, considered how’ best to:publish, scaled exhibits to the jury while
protecting the identitics of witnesses. and ‘the privacy of third partics. On ‘that score, the
Government ‘is ‘mindful, that exhibits published. in ¢lectronic format on screens in the courtroom
may be scén by ‘the public, since: the screcns at. counsel table — and, potentially the jury box- are
visible to the public: from certain angles. For this reason, the Government requests permission to
provide jurors with individual, binders containing sealed exhibits. ‘The Government; expcets that.
jurors will ‘follow the Court’s instruction-to only’view items in‘the. binder when the Court instructs

jurors to.do so.
