Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 424 _ Filed 11/08/21 Page 27 of 41

Dr. Dietz’s opinion, that, individuals who have been sexually. assaulted. have higher rates. of
mental. disorders than individuals who have not beeri sexually assaulted, and that these disorders
can.affect memory and recall, :is prejudicial and unhelpful. Offering this opinion. in this form can.
only serve to‘prejudice the jury into making generalizations that :certaim witnesses, as.a category,
aré more likely to be, less,worthy' of belicf’by reason of mental illness. Given that Dr. Dictz
‘that case-by-case assessment is best. made by precluding him from offering this prejudicial and.
stereotyping opinion before the jury.

6. Opinions Regarding Post-Traumatic Stress Symptoms

Finally, Dr. Dietz opines that. “significant: proportions” of victims ¢xhibit, post-traumatic
stress symptomology for “varying durations” and that victims with certain symptoms are:
“particularly unlikely to engage in continued communication, or friendly gestures with an. alleged.
perpetrator, to. wear clothing provided. by an alleged perpetrator, orto. Unncéessarily recreate a.
sexual assault event.” (Ex. A.at: 1.1).

This opinion is confusing and. appears ‘not to be relcvant:to, the facts of the case. First, Dr.
Dictz’s: conclusion ‘that. victims with certain post-traumatic stress symptoms arc ‘unlikely to
“unnecessarily: recreate .a, sexual assault event” is illogical given that it appears to place the
responsibility on ‘the victim ‘for €xpéricncing repeated. assaults, and at.a minimum he should. be
required, to disclose: comprchensibly exactly what behavior he is referring to as. unlikely.

Second, a critical distinetion.in this ease:involves the difference between victims of sexual
assaults who areé involved .an. ongoing:relationship of attachment-and cocrcion'with their abusers—
including the power, imbalance arising from the age differential, between them, and the abusers—.

and those who are‘not. To the extent; Dr. Dictz’s testimony:primarily'addresses the latter category,
