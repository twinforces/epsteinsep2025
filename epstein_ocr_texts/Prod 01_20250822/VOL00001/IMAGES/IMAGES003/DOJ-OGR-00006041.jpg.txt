Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 404 _ Filed 11/02/21 Page6of6
1 I do want to thank all of you for the time you've invested already in this process. Our
2. system cannot function unless we have good people like you who are willing to give up their
3. time and to serve as jurors.
4 Please sit quietly until your number is called and you are brought into the courtroom for
5 questioning by me. Although you may use your electronic devices while you are waiting
6 (bearing in mind of course all of my instructions that forbid you to do any research or engage in
7 any communications about the case through any means), you must turn off and hand over any
8 electronic devices to the Jury Department staff before you are brought into the courtroom. I look
9 forward to meeting each of you in person soon. Thank you.
