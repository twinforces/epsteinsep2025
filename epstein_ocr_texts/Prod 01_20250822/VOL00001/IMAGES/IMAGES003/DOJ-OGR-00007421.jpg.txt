circumstances, the uncharged crimes evidence is “appropriately treated as part of the very act
charged, or, at least, proof of that act.” Quinones, 511 F.3d at 309 (internal citations and quotations
marks omitted).

Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) allows for the admission of uncharged crimes, wrongs, or
other acts for purposes other than proving criminal propensity, “such as proving motive,
opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of
accident.” Fed. R. Evid. 404(b). The Second Circuit “has long adopted an ‘inclusionary’ approach
to the admission of uncharged crime evidence, under which evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, or
acts is admissible for any purpose other than to show a defendant’s criminal propensity.” United
States v. Paulino, 445 F.3d 211, 221 (2d Cir. 2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Where the
defendant claims her conduct has an innocent explanation, the admission of such evidence of other
acts is particularly appropriate. See, e.g., United States v. Zackson, 12 F.3d 1178, 1182 (2d Cir.
1993) (“Where a defendant claims that his conduct has an innocent explanation, prior act evidence
is generally admissible to prove that the defendant acted with the state of mind necessary to commit
the offense charged.”). And where Rule 404(b) evidence is offered to show the defendant’s state
of mind, all that is required is that the evidence be “sufficiently similar to the conduct at issue to
permit the jury to draw a reasonable inference of knowledge or intent from the other act.” United
States v. Cadet, 664 F.3d 27, 32 (2d Cir. 2011) (alteration in original, internal quotation marks and
citation omitted). Evidence offered for a proper purpose under Rule 404(b) may only be excluded
if the probative value of the evidence is “substantially outweighed” by the danger of unfair
prejudice. Zackson, 12 F.3d at 1182; see Fed. R. Evid. 403.
