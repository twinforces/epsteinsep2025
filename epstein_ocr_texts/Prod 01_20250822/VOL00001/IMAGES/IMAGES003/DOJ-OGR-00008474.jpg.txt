] Instruction No. 11: Multiple Counts
2 As I just explained, the Indictment contains six counts. Each count charges the
3 Defendant with a different crime. You must consider each count separately and return a separate
4 _ verdict of guilty or not guilty for each. Whether you find Ms. Maxwell guilty or not guilty as to
5 _ one offense should not affect your verdict as to any other offense charged, unless you are
6 instructed otherwise.
7 You may only find Ms. Maxwell guilty of a particular count if the Government has
8 proven each element of the offense charged with respect to that count beyond a reasonable doubt.
