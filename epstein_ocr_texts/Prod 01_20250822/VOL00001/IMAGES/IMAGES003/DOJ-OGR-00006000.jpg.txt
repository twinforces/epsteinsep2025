argument.are flawed, and the Court should.enter the order proposed by Ms. Maxwell that, all
‘partics, witnesses, and’'the Court should refer to'the iridividuals by their proper narics.

First, overlooking the frequency with:which.state:courts must grapple with fair trials
inherent in.sex, crimes, the government complains that the defendant; cited no federal authority
for the proposition that the Court, witnesses, ard partics. should use. the individuals’ names rather,
than the word "victim." To remedy that:perecived:problem, counsel refers the Court to United
Staies v. Senay No. 19-CR-01432, 2021 WL 4129247, at:*1=2 (D:N.M. Sept. 9, 2021), and the
other cases ‘cited therein:

"/Defendant] is correct that the term [victim] is, prejudicial when the core issue at
trial is whether a crime has been committed.—and,, therefore, whether there is a:
vietim. See State %.. Cortes, 85,1. A.2d,1230, 1239-40 (Conn. App. Ct. 2004), aff'd,
885 A.2d. 153 (Conn. 2005) (holding that jury. chargesusing the term. “victim”
‘instcad of * ‘alleged. victim” violated a. defendant's due: ‘proccss right ‘toa. fair trial);
‘Lalkington v. State, 682 'S.W.2d. 674, 674: (Tex. App. 1984) (use of the term,
“vietim” in court's rape charge was reversible: crror when the issue at trial, was
whether complainant consented to séxual intercourse); People 'v Vi Davis, 423
N.Y .S.2d 229, 230 (N.Y. App. Div. 1979) (“By referring in, its charge to ‘the
complainant.as the ‘victim’ and to ‘the defendant. as the ‘perpetrator’, the ‘court
impermissibly insinuated tothe jury that the complainant was the:victim of‘ injuries
resulting ‘from acts: committed. by the defendant.”)..

At [the] upcoming trial, the jury has the responsibility of deciding whether a crime,
occurred. and. whether that crime resulted :in harm. to [the accuscr]. Thus, to labcl.
[the accuser] as a ‘victim at the outset. of trial, carrics the risk; of improperly
influencing the: jury's decision. Morcover,, there is virtually no probative value. in.
allowing the government to use the term “victim” to describe [the accuser]. See.
United States. +. Ehréns, No. CR-15-200-C, 20.5 WL 7758544, at *2 (W.D. Okla.
Dee. 1, 2015) (considering a similar motion and finding that there was: “no need by
any’party to refer'to [the alleged victim] by any: particular descriptor other than her
name”). Restricting the use of the ferm “victim” does not prevent-the government
from describing [the acetiser's] injuries, or from presenting any of its other
evidence. he governnient and its Wwithesses remain. free to refer'l [the aécuser] by
name.or by other-descriptive terms (e.g., “the.mail carrier”).

Jd. (emphasis added).
As argued in. the: motion, when the government, the Court, or another’ witness uses the

term "victim" at the outsct. of the:trial, it risks the jury pre-judging, the merits, improperly
