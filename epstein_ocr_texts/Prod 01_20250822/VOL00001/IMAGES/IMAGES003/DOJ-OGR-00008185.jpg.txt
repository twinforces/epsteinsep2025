lying,” “false memories,” “intoxication,” and “a variety of psychiatric. disorders” can lead to
false accusations. Nov. 10 Tr. at'154. This exchange shows that cross-éxamination is an
adequate basis for testing Dr. Rocchio’s opinion.and that jurors do not:require:an expert to
‘understand the content of that cross-cxamination. ‘Because this testimony goes to “lay matters
which a jury is. capable of understanding and deciding without the, cxpert’s help,” the Court
‘excludes testimony on.these matters. United States v. Mulder, 273 F.34.91, 101 (2d-Cir, 2001)
(quoting United States v. Castillo, 924 F.2d 1227, 1232\(2d Cir. 19911).

Third, Dr. Dictz’s opinion on false memorics rests‘on the research of.Dr. Loftus.
Because the Court’will, admit, Dr. Loftus’s testimony on, false memories, the Court will preclude
Dr. Dictz’s testimony on the same issue as needlessly cumulative and.causing undue delay.

Fourth, in the:second pathway, Dr. Dictz:states that implicd.consent can lead to false
accusations. Notice at*7—-8. ‘Based on the offenses charged, the alleged, victims’ willingness or
verbal consent to engage. in scxual, conduct is irrelevant here: Whether there was. consent turns
entirely: on:the alleged-victims’ ages. SeeKidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at'252-53. The Court therefore
excludes this opinion under Rules 401 and 403 because it ‘is net:probative but risks, confusing
jurors about the proper standard of guilt.

In sum, on the present record, the Court will exclude Dr. Dictz’s “pathways to false
accusations” opinion.

III, The testimony of. Dr. Elizabeth Loftus

The Defense ‘also seeks to. admit the testimony’ of Dr. Elizabeth Loftus as an-cxpert:on.the:

Science of memory.. The. Defense’s notice listed approximately five opinions. .Notice at 1-2.
