lying,” “false memories,” “intoxication,” and “a variety of psychiatric disorders” can lead to
false accusations. Nov. 10 Tr. at 154. This exchange shows that cross-examination is an
adequate basis for testing Dr. Rocchio’s opinion and that jurors do not require an expert to
understand the content of that cross-examination. Because this testimony goes to “lay matters
which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help,” the Court
excludes testimony on these matters. United States v. Mulder, 273 F.3d 91, 101 (2d Cir. 2001)
(quoting United States v. Castillo, 924 F.2d 1227, 1232 (2d Cir. 1991)).

Third, Dr. Dietz’s opinion on false memories rests on the research of Dr. Loftus.
Because the Court will admit Dr. Loftus’s testimony on false memories, the Court will preclude
Dr. Dietz’s testimony on the same issue as needlessly cumulative and causing undue delay.

Fourth, in the second pathway, Dr. Dietz states that implied consent can lead to false
accusations. Notice at 7-8. Based on the offenses charged, the alleged victims’ willingness or
verbal consent to engage in sexual conduct is irrelevant here: Whether there was consent turns
entirely on the alleged victims’ ages. See Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d at 252-53. The Court therefore
excludes this opinion under Rules 401 and 403 because it is not probative but risks confusing
jurors about the proper standard of guilt.

In sum, on the present record, the Court will exclude Dr. Dietz’s “pathways to false
accusations” opinion.

II. The testimony of Dr. Elizabeth Loftus

The Defense also seeks to admit the testimony of Dr. Elizabeth Loftus as an expert on the
science of memory. The Defense’s notice listed approximately five opinions. Notice at 1—2.
First, the “creation” and “characteristics of false memories.” Second, “how memory fades and
weakens over time.” Third, “how memory becomes more vulnerable to contamination.” Fourth,
