Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document516 Filed 11/21/21 Page 4 of 17

The Court will partially admit and partially‘preclude these opinions. ‘Dr. Dictz may.
testify that Dr. Rocchio’s definition runs the risk of suggesting that innocent.conduct. is grooming
and that the label. “grooming” carries within it.a subjective judgment of an.alleged perpetrator’s
intent. ‘These: opinions, when limited'to a-criticism, of Dr. .Rocchio’s definition of grooming,
bolster Dr..Dict7’s opinion. that grooming, docs. not have a settled, definition, and is hard:to.
measure, They are therefore relevant and admissible opinions.

But the Court:will preclude any’ opinion testimony. that there ‘is inadequate. evidence of:an
‘intent to groom:as applicd to.Ms. Maxwell. In particular, Dr. Dictz’s disclosed. opinions:that
there is not.“wdequate evidence of either” motive or intent, that. grooming ‘imputes intent.“/o the.
Defendant,” and. that, “there is considerable risk of misleading the fact finder” into finding ‘imtént,
all suggest that Dr. Dictz would testify that there is inadequate evidence:of Ms. Maxwell’s intent.
Notice at. 3 (emphasis added). Testimony to that-cffeet would plainly violate Rule 704(b). The
Court therefore precludes:these thrée aspects of Di. Dietz’s opinioni.as well.as any other

testimony'that would. similarly go beyond criticizing Dr. Rocchio’s definition, of grooming and

instead suggest. that: there is inadequate evidence of intent-in this case.

Fourth, Dr. Dictz states that there is not empirical data‘on whether minors with-particular.
vulnerabilities are’ more likely to be targeted. by. perpetrators of sexual abuse. /d.at 4. The
Government responds that this opinion itself is unsupported inthe academic literature. Gov"t.Br.
at 11. Iftexperts disagree on.the proper interpretation of evidence, “it is. not the Court’s role to
resolve the, dispute’ through. exclusion of one of the expert’s opinions.” Jn, re. Digital Music
Antitrust Litig., 32.1 F.R.D. 64, 80 (S.D.N.¥...2017). The Court concludes that.Dr. Dietz’s.

extensive experience in,the ficld:provides an adequate basis for this opinion criticizing Dr.

Rocchio’s opinion. It therefore admits this opinion.
