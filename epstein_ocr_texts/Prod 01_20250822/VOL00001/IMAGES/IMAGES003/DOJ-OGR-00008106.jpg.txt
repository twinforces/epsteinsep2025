Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document508- Filed 11/24/21 Page 21 of 25
F.3d at 246 (“[UJnless an exception applies, all ‘relevant evidence is admissible.’” (quoting Fed.
R. Evid. 402)).

Finally, the nature and timing of gg disclosures are also admissible in

response to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about delayed and partial disclosure.
6. Conclusion.

Cross-examination is “the principal means by which the believability of a witness and the
truth of [her] testimony are tested.” Davis, 415 U.S. at 316. And in our adversarial system, the
government cannot shield its case from being tested. A defendant has a constitutional right to
present a defense. Crane, 476 U.S. at 690.

The government’s case significantly depends on the credibility off, since no
physical evidence corroborates her allegations and because she is the named victim for several of
the counts. Where, as here, the defendant intends to cross-examine an essential government
witness, one who “provid[es] an essential link in the prosecution’s case, the importance of full
cross-examination to disclose possible bias is necessarily increased.” Greene v. Wainwright, 634
F.2d 272, 275 (Sth Cir. 1981). And as the Tenth Circuit has recognized in reversing a conviction
because the defendant was deprived of the opportunity to question a government witness about
his mental health conditions and drug use, “i]t is just as reasonable that a jury be informed of a
witness’s mental incapacity at a time about which he proposes to testify as it would be for the
jury to know that he then suffered an impairment of sight or hearing.” Robinson, 583 F.3d at
1275.

II. Professor Gershman’s Testimony is Admissible.

The government wrongly asserts that Professor Gershman’s testimony “is relevant only
to the defense theories that the Court has excluded.” Mot. at 20. In ruling on the motions in
limine, the Court expressly declined to prohibit Ms. Maxwell from challenging the consistency
