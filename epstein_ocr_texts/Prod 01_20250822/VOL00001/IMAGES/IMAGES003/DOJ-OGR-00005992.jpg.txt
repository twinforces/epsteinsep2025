jury.” Resp. at 53-54. Apparently, the government believes the jury would be “confused” if the
Court told the jurors what the law actually is so that they do not improperly assume thay
HE testimony is being offered as proof of “criminal sexual activity” and apply it
incorrectly to convict Ms. Maxwell of the Mann Act conspiracies. The jurors would not be
“confused”; they would be educated on how to properly cvaluatqyggy evidence.
The government’s objection is non-sensical. But not as non-sensical as the government’s final
proclamation:

The sexual activity involving Minor Victim-3 can be considered criminal for

purposes of the crimes charged in the Indictment, because it is probative proof of

the defendant’s guilt of those crimes. The instruction the defense proposes, in

contrast, creates serious risk that the jury will think the Court is telling them that

the conduct is lawful and therefore irrelevant to the case.

Id. at 54. A better example of circular reasoning you could not find — gg sex
acts with Epstein are “criminal” because they are “proof of the defendant’s guilt of those
crimes”? No. And the “risk that the jury will think that ... the conduct is lawful? It was lawful.
Whatever misgivings i may now have about those alleged sex acts, and whether
she now views those incidents as “sexual abuse,” there was nothing illegal about them.

And that is precisely the point. If she is permitted qq will testify about
feeling sexually abused by Epstein and the jury will assume that the sex acts were illegal. Unless
the Court instructs the jury that the sex acts were not illegal under U.K. law, and they cannot be
considered as “criminal sexual conduct” in evaluating the elements of the Mann Act
conspiracies, there is a substantial risk that the jury will misapply her evidence and improperly
convict Ms. Maxwell of those counts. The government has agreed to do this in similar cases and
it is appropriate to do so here. See Vickers, 708 F. App’x at 735-36 (government sought and
received jury instructions explaining the applicable criminal laws of the relevant jurisdictions
and jury returned a special verdict form finding “that the defendant intended to engage in sexual
