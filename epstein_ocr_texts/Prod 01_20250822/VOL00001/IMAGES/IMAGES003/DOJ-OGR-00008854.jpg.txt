publicity that will undoubtedly surround the unsealing of the Motion will influence the memories
of other potential witnesses. All of this will frustrate the truth-seeking process of any factual
inquiry ordered by the Court and jeopardize Ms. Maxwell’s one chance to vindicate her right to a
fair trial.

For the reasons set forth more fully below, Ms. Maxwell’s right to a fair trial is a “higher
value” and a compelling interest that outweighs the public’s qualified right of access to the Motion
under both the common law and the First Amendment. The Court should therefore order that the
Motion remain temporarily sealed until the Court rules on Ms. Maxwell’s Motion or until the
conclusion of any hearing ordered by the Court, whichever comes first.!

Applicable Law

It is well settled that the public and the press have a qualified right of access to judicial
documents filed in criminal and civil proceedings under both the First Amendment and the
common law. See Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2006);
United States v. Silver, No. 15-CR-93 (VEC), 2016 WL 1572993, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 14, 2016).
“The presumption of access is based on the need for federal courts, although independent—
indeed, particularly because they are independent—to have a measure of accountability and for the
public to have confidence in the administration of justice.” United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d
1044, 1048 (2d Cir. 1995) (“Amodeo IT’).

! The defense anticipates that the government’s response will raise the same issues and will need to be sealed for the
same reasons. Accordingly, the defense further requests that that Court order the government to file its response
temporarily under seal to give the defense the opportunity to assert its position regarding sealing.
