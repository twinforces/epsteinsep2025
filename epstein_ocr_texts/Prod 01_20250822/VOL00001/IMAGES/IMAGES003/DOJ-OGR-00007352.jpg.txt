Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

On October 29, 2021, Defendant filed a motion in limine “to exclude evidence related to
Accuser-3.” Dkt. Nos. 387, 444. The Court twice heard argument related to this motion,
including extensive argument at the November 10, 2021 in camera hearing that was sealed
pursuant to Federal Rule of Evidence 412. See generally Nov. 1, 2021 Transcript; Nov. 10, 2021
Transcript. The Court has also considered supplemental briefing from the parties. That briefing
has been filed temporarily under seal to permit the parties the opportunity to propose redactions
in accordance with Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).

In a Memorandum Opinion & Order filed under temporary seal, the Court GRANTS in
part and DENIES in part the Defendant’s motion. The Memorandum Opinion & Order lays out
the permissible and impermissible testimony that may be offered by this witness based on Rules
412, 404, 401, and 403.

The Court will send the temporarily sealed Memorandum Opinion & Order to the parties.
By November 21, 2021, the parties are ORDERED to inform the Court whether either seeks
sealing or limited redactions of the Court’s Memorandum Opinion & Order and of the
supplemental briefing, justifying any such request by reference to Federal Rule of Evidence
