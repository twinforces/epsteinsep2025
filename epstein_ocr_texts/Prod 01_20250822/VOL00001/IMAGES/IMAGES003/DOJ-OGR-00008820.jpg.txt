Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government submits this letter to respectfully request that the Court exclude time
under the Speedy Trial Act with respect to Counts Seven and Eight, from today’s date until April
1, 2022. The exclusion of time will further the interests of justice by permitting the parties to
research and brief post-trial motions. See 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(7)(A). The Government has
conferred with defense counsel, who consent to this request.

Respectfully submitted,
DAMIAN WILLIAMS
