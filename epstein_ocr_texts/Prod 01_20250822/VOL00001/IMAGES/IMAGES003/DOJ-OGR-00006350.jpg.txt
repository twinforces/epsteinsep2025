average person,” and so appropriate for expert.testimony.. United States v. Felder, 993 'F.3d.57,
72 (2d Cir. 202:1). Nor would. admission of these opinions cause unfair Rule 403, prejudice. since
they are relevant:rebuttal to impeachment:points that the Defense:will put.in issue.

The Defense ‘argues that Dr. Rocchio’s:testimony is. not relevant because the ‘Government
represents that she will testify‘only to general principles. and not offer “testimony: regarding. any
specific victim.” Dkt. No. 386 at 3. The Defense has'the law’backwards on this point. As
explained above'regarding the Sccond Circuit’s .Nimely decision, an cxpert:may: not-testify as to a
specific witness’s credibility. 414 F.3d:at 398. And.as other courts have explained in:admitting
similar testimony, Dr. Rocchio’s testimony, is appropriate because’ she' does not testify as to any
specific witness’s credibility. See, @g., Torres, No. 20-CR-608 (DLC), 2021 WL. 1947503, at’
*7;.Johnson, 860 F.3d. at..1:140 (8th Cir. 201.7) (explaining that.an expert may testify “regarding.
the general characteristics that; sexually abused children cxhibit”’but may‘not usurp the jury’s:
role of assessing the eredibility of any specific victim); W/nited States. Telles, 6 F.4th, 1086,

This analysis is referred to in the case relicd’upon. by the Defense, Wiited: States v-
Raymond, and.in portions of the Defense’s bricfing, as‘a. question of “fit.” 700 F. Supp. 2d:at
149. But Dawhert’s. “fit” requirement is really just.a, specialized relevance inquiry that asks
“whether expert testimony proffered in the case is sufficiently tied, to, the facts of the casc'that. it
will.aid the jury in resolving a factual. dispute.” Alto'v: Sun-Pharm. Indus., Inc.,'No. 1:19-CV-
09758 (GHW), 2021, WL 4803582, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Oct-13, 2021) (quoting Dauher?, 509 U:S. at
S911). ‘Fit is satisfied ifthe expert’s opinion would assist the jury’s decision on.a relevant
question of fact:without “usurp[ing] cither the role ofthe trial judge in instructing the jury’ as to.

‘the applicable law. or the role of the jury in.applying that law to the facts before it.” /d.(quoting
