Instruction No..12: Conspiracy and Substantive Counts
‘As Vhave just described, there are certain, counts in the Indictment, that are conspiracy
counts, while. others are'what are‘referred to as substantive. counts. Unlike the conspiracy

charges, which allege agreements to: commit :certain offenses, the substantive counts are based on.

‘the actual commission of offenses, or aiding, others ‘to actually commit offenses.

A.conspiracy to Commit a.crime.is an entirely separate and different offense from the

substantive crime which may be the object ofthe conspiracy. Congress: has deemed it: appropriate

‘to make conspiracy, standing ‘alone, a'separate crime; even. if the object of the conspiracy: is‘not

achieved.. The essence of the crime. of Conspiracy: is. an agreement or-understanding to violate
Consequently; in.a conspiracy, charge there is‘no ‘need ‘to prove that’ the crime that: was the
objective of the conspiracy was actually :committed.

By contrast; the substantive counts require proof that the crime charged, was actually
committed, but do not'requiré, proof of an agreement! Of course, if a. defendant both:participates.
in a.conspiracy to commit a.crime and then actually commits that: crime, that defendant may be
guilty: of both the conspiracy and the substantive crime, as, ] will, instruct you shortly.
to consider before the conspiracy ‘charges. Therefore | will. instruct you, first.on.Counts Two,

Eour, and Six, and then.1 will instruct you on. Counts One, Three, and Five.
