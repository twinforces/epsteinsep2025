Sexual grooming of children 295
that offenders who abused boys showed a preference for interacting at the child’s level, and
incest offenders tended to raise the victim’s status to that of an adult, while offenders who
abused girls were more concerned with sexual gratification. The types of behaviour that
constitute grooming the child take two different forms—physical and psychological.

Physical grooming involves the gradual sexualization of the relationship between the
offender and the victim (Berliner & Conte, 1990). Psychological grooming is used to achieve
this increased sexualization. At first, the offender may justify the sexual behaviour through
providing the child with his version of sex education, which states that sex between children
and adults is acceptable and that the offender has a responsibility to train the child for later
life (Berliner & Conte, 1990; Leberg, 1997). The abuser builds the child’s trust (Christiansen
& Blake, 1990; Leberg, 1997; Wyre, 1987, cited in Howitt, 1995; van Dam, 2001), makes
him or her feel good (Warner, 2000) and then starts to violate boundaries (Christiansen &
Blake, 1990; van Dam, 2001). This may involve intentionally entering the bedroom while the
child or young person is undressed, or getting dressed together and exposing himself to the
child.

Offenders often desensitize a child to touch by beginning with non-sexual touching such
as tickling or stroking the child’s head. Conversation may also become more sexual.
Alternatively, offenders may confuse victims by continuing to talk to the child about a
positive unrelated issue while they begin touching the child sexually (Leberg, 1997). The child
may have no idea that something inappropriate is happening. The aim is to progress to sexual
touching, first on top of clothes and later under or without clothes (Berliner & Conte, 1990;
Christiansen & Blake, 1990; Leberg, 1997; van Dam, 2001). Thus, the intention is to make
the child compliant with the offender’s sexual demands and overcome the child’s resistance
(Finkelhor, 1984; Leberg, 1997; Warner, 2000).

In addition to using psychological grooming to increase compliance, it is also used to
avoid disclosure. Children are groomed to want to be around the adult who is grooming them
(Wolf, 1985). Offenders need to maintain the child’s cooperation and secrecy to achieve this.
One way that the offender does this is by isolating the child and alienating them from others
(Warner, 2000). Leberg (1997) refers to this factor as something separate from grooming,
others (e.g. van Dam, 2001) consider it to be part of the grooming process. Isolating the child
creates a barrier which prevents the child from having a confidant in whom to disclose
(Warner, 2000). In addition, the keeping of secrets acts as a source of further isolation
(Lerner, 1993, cited in van Dam, 2001). Children are very good at keeping secrets when
asked to. Peters (1991, cited in Ceci & Bruck, 1993) found that 82% of children in his study
delayed or did not report an event that they had witnessed, because the thief in the scenario
asked them not to tell anyone. The thief in this scenario was a stranger, to whom the children
had no loyalty, and so it is likely that children would be even more likely to protect a known
and loved adult.

Further strategies used by offenders to maintain the child’s compliance include issuing
threats and bribes (Berliner & Conte, 1990; Christiansen & Blake, 1990). Bribes may take
the form of material gifts or extra privileges (Christiansen & Blake, 1990). In addition,
offenders are skilled at using children’s natural vulnerabilities against them. For instance,
children very often have a strong desire to protect their parents. When the offender informs
them that their parents would be very hurt if they found out what they had been doing,
children may remain silent (Berliner & Conte, 1990). Offenders may also demonstrate their
potential for violence through violence towards others, e.g. other family members. Thereby
offenders reinforce the message that they will enact their threats about hurting the child
and/or the child’s family.
