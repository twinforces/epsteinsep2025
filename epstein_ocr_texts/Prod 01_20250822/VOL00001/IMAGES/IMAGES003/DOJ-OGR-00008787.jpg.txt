Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document565- Filed 12/19/21 Page 81 of 83

1 Thus, the verdict must represent the considered judgment of each juror. In order to

2 return a verdict, it is necessary that each juror agree to it. Your verdict must be unanimous.

3 If at any time you are divided, do not report how the vote stands, and if you have

4 reached a verdict, do not report what it is until you are asked in open court.

5 A verdict form has been prepared for your convenience. After you have reached your

6 decision, your foreperson will fill in the form. At that point the foreperson should advise the

7 marshal outside your door that you are ready to return to the courtroom.

8 Finally, I say this not because I think it is necessary, but because it is the custom in this

9 courthouse to say this: You should treat each other with courtesy and respect during your
10 deliberations.
11 In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure that if you listen to the views of your
12 fellow jurors, and if you apply your own common sense, you will deliberate fairly.
13 Members of the jury, I ask your patience for a few minutes longer. It is necessary for me
14 to spend a few moments with counsel and the reporter at the side bar. I will ask you to remain
15 patiently in the jury box, without speaking to each other, and we will return in just a moment to
16 submit the case to you. Thank you.
