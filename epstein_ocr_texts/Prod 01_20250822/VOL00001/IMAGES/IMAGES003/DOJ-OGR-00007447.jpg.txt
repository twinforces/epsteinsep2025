consent. The defense proposes the following instruction, which is modeled on the proposed
instruction for Accuser-3:
You have heard testimony from this witness about sexual activity
between her and Jeffrey Epstein that occurred [choose all that
apply: in Florida when she was above the age of 18; in the U.S.
Virgin Islands when she was above the age of 18; in New York
when she was above the age of 17; in New Mexico when she was
above the age of 16; in the United Kingdom when she was above
the age of 16].
For the purposes of your deliberations, I instruct you that at all
times relevant to this case the legal age of consent for sexual
activity [choose all that apply: in Florida was 18 years old; in the
U.S. Virgin Islands was 18 years old; in New York was 17 years
old; in New Mexico was 16 years old; in the United Kingdom was
16 years old].
If you find that the witness engaged in sexual activity after she was
above the relevant age of consent, I instruct you that any such
sexual activity was lawful and cannot be considered “illegal” or
“criminal” or “unlawful” for purposes of the crimes charged in the
indictment.
IV.  Accuser-3 Cannot Be Considered a “Victim” for Any Legal Purpose
The Court ruled at the November 10" hearing that Accuser-3 could not be considered a
“victim” of the crimes charged in the S2 Indictment and that the government should not refer to
her as a “victim” or a “minor.” Accordingly, there is no need for the defense to respond to the
government’s November 7" Letter.
Respectfully submitted,
