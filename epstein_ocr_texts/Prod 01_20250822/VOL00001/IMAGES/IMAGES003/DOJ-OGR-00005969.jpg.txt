This is exactly the
type of evidence forbidden by Rule 404(b). See United States v. Angelilli, 660 F.2d 23, 40-41
(2d Cir. 1981) ("While we conclude that the custom and practice evidence was admissible for the
purposes we have discussed, we agree with the defendants that Rule 404(b) barred its use to
prove that the individual defendants acted in conformity with the custom and practice. ...").

Even if the Court overlooks the government's failure to provide notice,
absence of relevance to the charged conspiracy, and the government's failure to set forth a non-
propensity ground for admissibility, gM should also be excluded under Rules 401 and
403, as they do not tend to make any fact of consequence more or less probable, and their
probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice and confusing the
iS. |
