296) S..Graven etal:

Offenders ‘frequently niake ‘the ‘child feel. responsible. for the abuse (Leberg, 1997; van
Dam, 2001; Warner, 2000). They convince: the child that they are to blame for letting the
abuse happen and that they should have stopped it (Leberg,, 1997). This. tis reinforced by
stereotypes in socicty, which emphasize: that men, cannot ‘control their sex drive (Warner,
2000). Additional. guilt may’bé felt. if the child-has been made to perform sexual acts on the
abuser or another, child @Warner, 2000): However; this feeling: of responsibility and guilt :is
overshadowed. by’ the self-betrayal ‘the: ‘child feels: ‘as their body’ reacts ‘to sexual stimulation
against their will (Warner, 2000) which: children. may. interpret as evidence ‘that they vare

enjoying themselves. This is internalized and resultantly. may have an, impact ‘on the’ ‘child’s

“

developing identity. Disclosure‘is avoided because the child:feels ‘that it is “all-:theirfault’’,-that,
the/she is ‘bad ‘and. that no one ‘will. believe them. (Warner, 2000).

Each:victiin’s éxperience of groomingiis different, because offerdérs adapt their stratégics
dependent on the child; whose; response: during the grooming process is important. It seems
reasonable té suggest. that offenders require Some lével. of “empathy” during the grooming:
(process to; recognize; reactions. in;the child, so that they can, adapt their strategy accordingly.
For example, during the desensitization process an. offender ‘would néed. to récoégnize the
limits, of the victim and ‘to strategically increase those; limits. It is proposed that ‘empathy
involves four components: (1) emotion. recognition; (2) perspeéctive-taking; (3): emotion
replication; and (4) response decision, (Marshall, Hudson; Jones & ‘Fernandez; 1995):
Continuing with the, previous. example, offenders. recognize’ the distress in their victim and
make: a. decision based ‘on this; because ‘they. choose to stop: temporarily. as a strategic part of
the desensitization-process. Thus, offenders appear. to.have-ability in-components (1) and (4),
which are the ‘cognitive components, but not in. the, affective components (2) and (3). While
early research. on. empathy: in. sex offenders concluded that they have empathy deficits, more
recent.research has found that this:empathy. defi¢it-to be-victim-specific (Fernandez, Marshall,
Lightbody. & o Sullivan, 1999; ‘Marshall, Hamilton & Fernandez, 20013 Marshall et. al.,

of empathy. However, ‘Fernandez eu tal. (1999; Marshall ct’al., 2001) provide | a “ possible
explanation for this. They suggest that victim-specific empathy. deficits manifest. as. cognitive
distortions, which, protect. the: offenders from negatively evaluating themselves, ‘thus allowing’
them to continue abusing a; child: ‘Based on ‘this suggestion, victim=specitic empathy deficits
arise as'a.consequence rather'than.a cause:of the ‘abuse. ‘These cognitive distortions therefore
facilitate self-grooming:

The. manifestation of a cognitive distortion relating ‘to a. victim-specific ‘empathy, deficit
may be. facilitated by: cognitive deconstruction. Cognitive déconstruction ‘(sce Ward, Hudson
& Marshall, 1995) ‘is a state entered into to,‘escape. negative experiences and negative self-
evaluation. Cognitive deconstruction involves:processing. at a. lower, more concrete, level, ive.
muscular ‘movements, and rewards of behaviour; rather than social ‘action: Resultantly, the
individual. has much. ‘more focus. on feelings of pleasure and. less. awareness of the
consequences of his behaviour: This: concrete-level focus: may, ‘reinforce cognitive. distortions
such as'victims enjoyed thé abuse, because they became physically aroused, which justifies the
offender’s lack of empathy, toward their ‘victim.

Self-grooming; grooming the environment and significant:others; ‘and.grooming the.child
are:rélévant to. situational-and préferential. offenders, é@xtra-familial and. intrafamilial offences.
It: is:important: that’ the different: types ,of sexual grooming apply to these different typologies
and élassifications of offenders’ because Sexiial. prooming is not ‘used. solely by One group of
offenders and; furthermore; ‘these categories: are not: mutually ‘exclusive (Itzin; 2001).
