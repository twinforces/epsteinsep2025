Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document516 Filed 11/21/21 Page5of17

Fifth, Dr. Dietz states that Dr. Rocchio’s opinion about grooming for a third party—so-
called grooming-by-proxy—is not accepted in the field. Notice at 4. The Court has excluded
Dr. Rocchio’s testimony on this issue. Dkt. No. 435 at 10. The Defense apparently admits that
Dr. Dietz’s testimony on this point would be admissible only if it responds to Dr. Rocchio’s
testimony. Def. Br. at 5 n.2,7n.3. The Court therefore excludes Dr. Dietz’s testimony on
grooming for a third party or “grooming-by-proxy” because it is not relevant to the jury’s
determination.

Next, Dr. Dietz offers an opinion about hindsight bias. Specifically, he says that
behaviors can be labeled as “grooming” only in hindsight once the event of sexual abuse is
known. Notice at 4-5. Dr. Dietz’s notice cites to a series of articles that examine hindsight bias
in a variety of contexts and he concludes that an awareness of hindsight bias “should temper any
claims that so called ‘grooming’ behaviors should have been noticed and either reported or
avoided.” Jd. at 5. The Government argues that this opinion improperly instructs the jury on
how to assess evidence and that hindsight bias is a common-sense concept that does not require
expert testimony. Gov’t Br. at 12-14. The Defense responds that this opinion on hindsight bias
is another basis to criticize Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming, as a determination of grooming
can be made only after the fact. Def. Br. at 8-9.

The Court will admit Dr. Dietz’s hindsight-bias opinion insofar as it is a criticism of Dr.
Rocchio’s grooming opinion. Much like Dr. Dietz’s opinion on intent and grooming, this
opinion states that behavior can be labelled as grooming only if the outcome is known. For the
same reasons the Court admits Dr. Dietz’s opinion that a determination of grooming imputes
intent, the Court admits this opinion.
