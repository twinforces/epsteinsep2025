Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document516 Filed 11/21/21 Page 5of17

Fifth, Dr. Dietz states that/Dr. Rocchio’s opinion, about grooming for a third’ party—so-
called. grooming-by-proxy—is not accepted in the ficld. Notice at 4. The Court has éxcluded
Dr. Rocchio’s testimony on this issue. Dkt. No. 435 at.10. The Defense apparently admits that

Dr. Dietz’s testimony on,this point; would. be admissible only if it: responds to Dr. ‘Rocchio’s

determination.

Next, Dr. Dictz offers an opinion about hindsight bias. Specifically, he says that
behaviors can be labeled as “grooming” only ‘in hindsight. once the event of sexual abuse is
known. Notice at 4-5. Dr. Dictz’s-tiotice cites to a series of articles that examine hindsight bias
in.a varicty of. contexts and.he concludes that:an awareness of hindsight bias “should.temper any
claims that ‘so called “grooming” behaviors should have been:noticed,and cither reported or
how’to assess evidence:and that hindsight bias is a common-sense concept'that: does not require
expert-testimony:.. Gov’t Br. at 12=14. The Defense responds, that;this opinion on. hindsight. bias
is another basis to:criticize Dr. Rocchio’s definition of. grooming, asa determination. of grooming
can.be made only after the fact. Def. Br. at 8-9.

The Court will admit Dr. Dictz’s hindsight-bias opinion insofar as it is a criticism of Dr.
Rocchio’s grooming opinion. Much like Dr. :Dictz’s opinion on. intent-and grooming, this
opinion, states that behavior can be labelled. as grooming only if the outcome is:‘known. For'the:
same reasons the Court admits Dr. Dictz’s opinion that a:determination. of grooming imputes,

intent, the Court:admits this opinion.
