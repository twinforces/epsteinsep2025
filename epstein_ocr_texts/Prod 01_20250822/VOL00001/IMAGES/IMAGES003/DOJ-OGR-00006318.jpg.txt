Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 427 Filed 11/09/21 Page /7 of 16

1 The reason for these rules, as I am sure you understand, is they protect the integrity of the

2 trial and assure that both sides receive a fair trial.

3 Jurors in criminal cases base their verdicts on the evidence that they hear in the

4 courtroom, not on something that somebody else tells you, not on something that you see on TV

5 or on social media. That's why if you're selected as a juror, I'll be reminding you of these rules

6 regularly. You can't watch news accounts, look anything up or speak to anybody else about the

7 case. You would be violating the oath you have taken as jurors and you would be violating my

8 orders if you were to do that.

9 Finally, you must report to me through my court deputy any effort by any person to speak
10 with you about the case or to influence you about the case or to get information about the case.
11 The attorneys and their assistants have been instructed by me not to speak to you or otherwise
12 engage with you. They are not being rude or indifferent. They are merely following my
13. instructions.
14 I do want to thank all of you for the time you've invested already in this process. Our
15 system cannot function unless we have good people like you who are willing to give up their
16 time and to serve as jurors.
17 Please sit quietly until your number is called and you are brought into the courtroom for
18 questioning by me. Please follow all the instructions of the courtroom staff. Atheueh-yeumay
