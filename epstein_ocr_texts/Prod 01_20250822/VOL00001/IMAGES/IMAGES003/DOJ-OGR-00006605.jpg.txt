Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 443 Filed 11/12/21 Page19 of 24

Rather, Rocchio’s testimony will serve only to inflame and passions and emotions of the
jury, prejudicing Ms. Maxwell, and to distract and mislead the jury from its constitutional
obligation of holding the government to its burden of proof. See United States v. Figueroa, 618
F.2d 934, 943 (2d Cir. 1980) (evidence is unfairly prejudicial “when it tends to have some
adverse effect upon a defendant beyond tending to prove the fact or issue that justified its
admission into evidence. The prejudicial effect may be created by the tendency of the evidence
to prove some adverse fact not properly in issue or unfairly to excite emotions against the
defendant’’). This court should exclude Rocchio’s third proffered opinion.

D. Opinion 4: The presence of other individuals can facilitate the sexual

abuse of minors.

Rocchio’s fourth opinion—that the presence of other individuals can facilitate the sexual
abuse of minors—is not properly admitted as expert opinion. Such an opinion is not based on
“scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge.” Fed. R. Evid. 702. It is “basically . . . [a]
general pronouncement[]” that “coincide[s] with common sense.” United States v. Serna, 799
F.2d 842, 850 (2d Cir.1986), abrogated on other grounds by United States v. DiNapoli, 8 F.3d
909, 914 n. 5 (2d Cir. 1993). Expert testimony like this is not admissible because it concerns “lay
matters which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without the expert’s help.”
Andrews v. Metro N. Commuter R. Co., 882 F.2d 705, 708 (2d Cir. 1989). See also United States
v. Mulder, 273 F.3d 91, 101 (2d Cir. 2001) (“[T]he district court should not admit testimony that
is directed solely to lay matters which a jury is capable of understanding and deciding without
the expert’s help.” (quotation omitted)).
