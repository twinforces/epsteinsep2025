1 need to think about that is when judges do go give those

2 preliminary instructions, as best I can tell, sometimes counsel
3 are present, sometimes they're not. We wouldn't be able to

4 accommodate in-person presence for that purpose. I don't think
5 it would be necessary, so my suggestion is not to have the

6 parties present for the filling out of the questionnaire.

7 Do you disagree with that in any way, Ms. Sternheim?

8 MS. STERNHEIM: No, Judge. I just wanted a

9 clarification, because I have attended when judges have given
10 those preliminary instructions. But we have no objection to
11 the Court doing it in a recorded method.
12 THE COURT: OK.
13 Ms. Pomerantz, do you continue to be comfortable with
14 that?
15 MS. POMERANTZ: Yes. Thank you, your Honor.
16 THE COURT: All right. I will docket an anticipated
17 script soon to get your input in a letter with any requests for
18 changes, and then I will get that recorded and work with the
19 tech folks in the D.E.'S Office and the jury department to be
20 able to have that played before the questionnaire is filled
al out.
22 That's what I have, counsel. Are there other matters
23 to raise related to jury selection or otherwise at this time?
24 Ms. Pomerantz.
25 MS. POMERANTZ: Not from the government. Thank you,
