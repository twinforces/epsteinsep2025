need to think abotitt that is when judgés do gO Give those
preliminary instructions, as best I can tell, sometimes counsel

it would be necessary, So My Suggestion iS not ‘to Havé ‘the
parties present for the filling out of the questionnaire,

DO yOu disagree With ‘that in any way, Ms. Sternheim?

MS. STERNHEIM: No, Judge. I just wanted a

Clarification, bécdtsé I have attended when jtidges have given
those preliminary instructions, But we have no objection to
the Court. dding it in a recorded méethda.

THE COURT:  OK,.

MS; Pomerantz, dé you Continue to be comfortable with
that?

MS. POMERANTZ: Yes.» Thank you, your Honor.

THE COURT: All right. I will docket an anticipated
script soén to gét your input. in a letter with any réquests f6r
changes, and then I will get that mecornded and work with the

tech folks in the D.E.'S Office and the jury departmént to be

able to have that played before the questionnaire is filled,

out.

That's what, I have, counsel. Are there other matters
to raise related to jury selection or otherwise at this time?
