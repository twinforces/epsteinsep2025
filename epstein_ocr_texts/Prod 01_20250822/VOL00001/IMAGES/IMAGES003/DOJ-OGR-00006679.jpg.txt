ARGUMENT

A defendant's right to due process includes the right:not fo be the object of suggestive
‘police identification procedures that create “a very substantial likclihood of irreparable:
misidentification.” Simmons v. United States, 390'U.S. 377, 384 (1968); accord Neil v. Biggers,
409 U:S..188, 198 (1972); see also. Manson 'v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 1060.9, 114 (1977). This.
principle applies both to show-ups, see, é.g., Stovall ¥. Denno, 388 U.S. 293 (1967), and to

photographic identifications. Simmons y.. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968).
