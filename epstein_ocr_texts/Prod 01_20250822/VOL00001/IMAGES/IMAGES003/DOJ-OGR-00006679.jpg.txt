Ee | be photographic identification procedure used was the functional
equivalent of a one-on-one show-up. Any identification is tainted and should therefore be
suppressed by the Court.

ARGUMENT

A defendant's right to due process includes the right not to be the object of suggestive
police identification procedures that create “a very substantial likelihood of irreparable
misidentification.” Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968); accord Neil v. Biggers,
409 U.S. 188, 198 (1972); see also Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 106 n.9, 114 (1977). This
principle applies both to show-ups, see, e.g., Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293 (1967), and to
photographic identifications. Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968).
