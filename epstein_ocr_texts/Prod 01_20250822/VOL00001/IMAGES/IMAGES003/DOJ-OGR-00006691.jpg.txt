and therefore any opinions they might offer at trial would violate Rule 702.

2 Law enforcement witnesses, particularly case agents, are “vulnerable to making ‘sweeping
conclusions’ about the defendants’ activities,” which is impermissible. Mejia, 545 F.3d at 192.
Their testimony also often relies on testimonial hearsay, depriving the defendant of her
constitutional right to confrontation. U.S. Const. amend. VI; see United States v. Lombardozzi,
491 F.3d 61, 72 (2d Cir. 2007).
3 The Court should preclude expert opinion testimony not only from the law enforcement
witnesses the government calls in its case-in-chief, but also any law enforcement witnesses Ms.
Maxwell calls in her defense. Ms. Maxwell has not disclosed or endorsed these law enforcement
officers as expert witnesses, so the government cannot use cross-examination of these officers to
elicit expert opinion testimony that would be inadmissible if offered on direct examination.
