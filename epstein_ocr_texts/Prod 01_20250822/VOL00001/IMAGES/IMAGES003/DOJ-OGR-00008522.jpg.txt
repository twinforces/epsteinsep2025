Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document562 Filed 12/17/21 Page 66 of 82

] Instruction No. 47: Expert Testimony

2 You have heard what is called expert testimony. An expert is allowed to express his or

3 her opinion on those matters about which he or she has special knowledge and training. Expert

4 testimony is presented to you on the theory that someone who is experienced in the field can

5 assist you in understanding the evidence or in reaching an independent decision on the facts.

6 In weighing an expert’s testimony, you may consider the expert’s qualifications,

7 opinions, reasons for testifying, as well as all of the other considerations that ordinarily apply

8 when you are deciding whether or not to believe a witness’s testimony. You may give the expert

9 testimony whatever weight, if any, you find it deserves in light of all the evidence in this case.
10 You should not, however, accept a witness’s testimony merely because he or she is an
11 expert. Nor should you substitute it for your own reason, judgment, and common sense. The
12 determination of the facts in this case rests solely with you.
