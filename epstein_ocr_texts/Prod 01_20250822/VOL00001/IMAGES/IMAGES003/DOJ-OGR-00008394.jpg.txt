Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document549 Filed 12/17/21 Page2of2
(11/01/21 Tr. at 16 (citing United States v. Saldarriaga, 204 F.3d 50 (2d Cir. 2000))), that the
government “had an improper motive” (id. (citing United States v. Regan, 103 F.3d 1072 (2d Cir.
1997))), “affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the investigation”
(id. at 17), “[t]he length of the investigation, the investigative techniques used, and the fact that
the defendant was not initially a target of the investigation” (id. at 19 (quoting United States v.
Duncan, No. 18 Cr. 289, 2019 WL 2210663 (S.D.N.Y. 2019)), and questions about “who [the case
agents] talked to, what documents they subpoenaed, and when,” (id. at 20), among other lines of
questioning.

Without knowing details of the defense’s anticipated direct examination of the law
enforcement witnesses, however, the Government does not seek relief at this time.

Respectfully submitted,
