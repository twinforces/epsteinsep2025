allowed him to use his brilliance to manipulate people to do his bidding and to compartmentalize
people into isolated cells in which none had complete information about his activities. These
were not his only flaws, and Dr. Dietz is also prepared to address Jeffrey Epstein’s sexual
behavior should it prove relevant.
d. Opinions Related to the Multiple Pathways to False Sex Assault
Allegations

Studies concerning the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the
assertions made by Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and
are also otherwise relevant here. False allegations of sexual assault do occur, and there are
multiple pathways to these false allegations of sexual assault.

Not all allegations of sexual assault are true. Unfortunately, there has been little work on
understanding the prevalence of false allegations or pathways to these, particularly in a sample
most relevant to a jury—currently adjudicated cases. A peer reviewed journal article has
proposed 11 pathways to false allegations of sexual assault: (a) lying, (b) implied consent, (c)
false memories, (d) intoxication, (e) antisocial personality disorder, (f) borderline personality
disorder, (g) histrionic personality disorder, (h) delirium, (1) psychotic disorders, (j) dissociation,
and (k) intellectual disability. Jessica Engle and William O'Donohue, Pathways to False
Allegations of Sexual Assault, 12 J. Forensic Psychology Practice, 97. These pathways originate
in the psychological proclivities or state of the individual making these false allegations. The
descriptions of these pathways that follow include material drawn nearly verbatim from the
article by Engle and O’Donohue (2012), which was published before the latest edition of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders but nonetheless remains accurate in
characterizing certain personality disorders.

Lying: Lying involves the alleged victim knowingly making a false claim of sexual
assault. Humans do lie, and their lies can be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of
what they perceive as the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these
consequences could be:

= 1. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences,

= 2.secondary gain from victim status,

= 3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual
activity, pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases)

= 4. financial gain.

Implied Consent: A fact finder’s determination of whether consent was competently
given is often problematic, and some allegations are regarded as unfounded or false based on
determinations regarding consent before cases reach the stage of adjudication. A false allegation
