determining the weight. of the ‘prcsumption of access, the cout must balance any countervailing
factors against the:presumption. ./d, at:120. Factors to be considered vary and “include but are not
limited to ‘the danger of impairing law enforecment or judicial efficiency’ and. ‘the privacy’
‘interests of those resisting disclosure.’” Id. (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 71.F.3d 1044, 1050-

The defendant, states that the Defense Motion. “isa. ‘judicial document’ that.is subjéct’to a.
strong presumption of access under both the First-Amendment and the common law.” (Dkt. No.
590, Def. Letter at 4). The ‘Government agrees. However, the, defendant argucs that; the Court:
should.order the Defense. Motion.and its exhibits to.remain temporarily sealed ‘until the: Court rules.
‘on her motion or until the conclusion of any‘hearing ordered by the Court. (7d. at'9). The-defendant
contends that such rclicf‘is' warranted. because ‘public filing of the Defense Motion will “frustrate
the truth-secking process of any factual inquiry ordered by the Court.” (/d. at 3). The Government.
disagrees.

The defendant. asserts ‘that: publicly docketing the Defense Motion “will give Juror 50 an
improper preview of information he does:not have and should never have.” (/d. at.2). That.concern,
is unfounded. The Defense Motion, as’a,gencral matter, contains discussion of'some of the relevant.
casc law and information, about statements reportedly made by Juror 50 in thé news.media. There
‘can, be no need:to hide from;public:view a-discussion of publie.materials. Moreover, the defense’s
suggestion, that.her defense bricfing contains information from some significant: investigation into
Juror 50:is not accurate; the motion does not contain anysignificant material that:is not otherwise
public. Finally, to the extent the defense objects to unscaling Juror 50’s questionnaire, which is
an. exhibit to, their motion, that questionnaire is a:document that Juror 50 himself prepared, and.

which he would. of course be: shown. during any fact finding, inquiry.
