Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 497 Filed 11/23/21 Page 6of11

Third, testimony that I have excluded or told you to disregard is: not

evidence and ‘must not be considered.

Fourth, anything you may ‘have seen. or heard outside the courtroom is not

evidence and must be disregarded. ‘You are to decide the case solely on the

‘evidence presented. here in the courtroom.

Evaluating the Evidence

There is‘no formula to evaluate testimony or exhibits. For now, suffice it to

say: that you bring with you into this courtroom.all. of. the experience and.

background of your lives. Do:not leave your common sense outside the courtroom.

The same types of tests. that you ‘use in your everyday ‘dealings are the tests that

you. should apply in. deciding how much weight, if any, to give to the evidence in

this case.

The law doés not require you. to accept all of the eviderice admitted at trial.

In determining what evidence you accept, you must make your:own. evaluation of.

the testimony from each. of the witnesses ‘and the exhibits that are ‘received in.
evidence.

It.is essential, however, that you. keep an open mind until you, have heard all
of the evidence in, the case. A case can be presented only step by step, witness by

witness, before all.evidence is before you.
