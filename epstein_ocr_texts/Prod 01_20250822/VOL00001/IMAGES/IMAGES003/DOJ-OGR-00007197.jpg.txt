LBAAMAX1ps Rocchio â€” Direct

1 either reported to me that they've been sexually abused or have
2 been referred to me after criminal proceedings have convicted a
3 perpetrator. So those would be cases where it's been

4 established that they've been abused.

S Q. During the course of your career, how old are the patients
6 you've treated and evaluated who experienced childhood sexual

7 abuse?

8 A. I've treated, over the course of my career, individuals

9 ages 13 and up.

10 Q. And if this -- in your current practice, how old are the

11 patients you treat?

12 A. I'm currently working with individuals predominantly who

13 are 18 and older.

14 Q. In addition --

15 THE COURT: Sorry. What you're describing generally,
16 is there a distinction to be made here in terms of your

17 practice regarding childhood sexual abuse between your clinical
18 side of your work and the forensic side? You're talking about
19 your clinical work, I presume.
20 THE WITNESS: I'm talking about my clinical work, but
21 it is true that in both my clinical and forensic practice I
22 have done a fair amount of work with adolescents as well as
23 adults and that currently I am predominantly working in both
24 settings with the evaluation of adults.
25 THE COURT: OK.
