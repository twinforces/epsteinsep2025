Moreover, grooming has no consistent definition, and concerns have been raised that
“there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred or is occurring.” Natalie
Bennett & William O’ Donohue, The Construct of Grooming in Child Sexual Abuse, 23 J. Child
Sexual Abuse 957, 974 (2014).

In any particular population of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—including those
whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—the determination of whether grooming has
occurred is a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of the individuals. Such
judgments have no known error rate and cannot be tested, verified, or reproduced.

Although the Government’s Expert Notice regarding Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony
is silent as to whether she is expected to impute a theory of “grooming-by-proxy” to the
Defendant, it is important to note that there is no generally accepted theory of grooming by third
parties or empirical evidence regarding the prevalence, characteristics, or mechanisms of such a
phenomenon. Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or enticing sexualized massages for
herself. Instead, the claim appears to be that Ms. Maxwell recruited and groomed minors to
provide sexualized massages for Mr. Epstein, which would amount to grooming-by-proxy.

Dr. Dietz is aware of no authority—no journal articles, no studies, no tests, nothing—to
support a theory of grooming-by-proxy. Such a theory has not gained any acceptance (let alone
general acceptance) in the relevant community; it has not been peer-reviewed; it has not and
cannot be tested; and there is no known or potential rate of error.

Dr. Rocchio’s opinion that “[i]ndividuals with particular vulnerabilities are often targeted
by perpetrators of sexual abuse” is a commonly accepted bit of clinical lore derived from the
frequent observation of highly vulnerable children among those children who allege sexual
abuse, but it is not based on empirical data regarding the likelihood of abuse among children
with varying degrees of vulnerability. To the extent that less vulnerable children, such as those
with intact families, attentive parents, good social support, little psychopathology, less prior
trauma, no substance use, and higher resilience are less likely to allege abuse than the more
vulnerable, the generalization could be proved weak or false, if only there were such empirical
data. And even if there were such data, it would be important to devise a means of verifying that
abuse did occur to those who allege it, which is a difficult task at best because of the pains so
many abusers take to avoid confession, witnesses, or physical evidence. The clinical, criminal
justice, and forensic populations from which the observation of prevalent vulnerabilities is
derived—including those clients whom Dr. Rocchio has treated or evaluated—trarely represent
groups in which all allegations of abuse have been verified by confession, witnesses, physical
evidence, or other means.

Other opinions put forth in the disclosure of Dr. Rocchio’s proposed testimony also rest
on assertions that are untestable, cannot be reproduced, and have no known error rate.

b. Opinions About Hindsight Bias

Hindsight bias must be considered when evaluating sex abuse allegations and or

“srooming behavior.” Many claims of sexual abuse of minors involve behaviors that are, in
