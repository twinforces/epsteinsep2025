(Defendant's, Exhibit B received in evidence)

MR, PAGLIUCA: If we could pull up Exhibit 6, please.

THE COURT: Government 6?

MR, PAGLIUCA: Yes, please.
BY MR. PAGLIUGA:
Q. Exhibit © is the study that you appear to have relied on
with regard to disclosure issues. Is that correct?
A. It's something I submitted in part, yes.
QO. Wéll,; a8 you sit Here today, Gan you tell us anything else
that you submitted with regard to your testimony about delayed
disclosuré and supporting literature?
A. J, couldn't. give you a list, but, again, my opinions are not
based on dny one article 6r éveh solely on my khowledge of the
literature. It's based, on, an interaction of the totality of imy
education, training, skills, experience; and knowledge of ‘the.
sclentific and clinical and, professional literatune.
QO: OK. So looking at Exhibit 6, this is a sufvey,
essentially, of a imumber of publications that talk, about,
barriérs of disclésuré. Correct?
A. So my understanding is, this was a study that was looking
at, understanding that delayed disclosure is very common; they
were trying to determine what, sorts of things present, as
barriers to disclosure and as facilitators of disclosure.
