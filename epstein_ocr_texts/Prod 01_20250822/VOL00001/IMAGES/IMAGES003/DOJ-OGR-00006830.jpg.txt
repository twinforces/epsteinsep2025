294. S..Graven etal:

Gollwitzer and Schaal. (1998, cited in Ward & Hudson,. 2000) suiggest that it is: through
atitomatic: goal-dependent action plans. that! thesé SUDs manifest. Ward and Hudson (2000)
propose that there are two such action plans: offence scripts :and mental simulations: Offence
scripts ‘manifest as ‘a result: of associations that have developed between situations: and
‘behaviours;. ‘subsequently; in the: presence of: certain cues, offence scripts may be activated
‘without any conscious awareness.. This ‘is 4 possible explanation of. continued. offending and
relapse following ‘treatment.

Automatic, goal-dependent ‘action plans can. be; activated. regardless jof whether an
individual. has committed ‘any, ‘previous sexual crimes. ‘This alternative: involves: mental
simulation. Mental'simulation.is where an individualplans out‘in detail how he would:commit
an Offerice. As, with offétice scripts, ‘the présence of certain, cues jmay activate this implicit,
planning, resulting in the enactment ‘of the individual’s, fantasies: The notion. of :im-
plicit ‘planning may provide:'a possible explanation why: the: majority of. victims know their
abuser, because.the cues thatvactivate the:implicit planning are’more likely to be‘present!within

It-is reasonable to suggest’that,the fundamental human need, to ‘belong:may present one
possibility to: further understand .offenders’ ability. to identify a victim ‘and ‘groom. the
chvironmeént and. significant others. Résearch:has shown that # need ‘to belong can: affeet very
‘basic: cognitive functions, ¢-g: attention and encoding of social ‘information (Pickett,, Gardner
& Knowles, 2004). Pickett et :al. found a positive relationship between a need to belong and
sensitivity, to social cues. Sexual. offenders ‘often. come from neglectful;, violent and
dysfunctional backgrounds (Craissati, McC ‘lurg: & Browne, 2002). This environment ‘tis
ufilikely to-providé ah, abuidanéee Of OpportiinitiGs for'emotionhal closeness andsthus offenders
are likely, to. haye a need to ‘belong. In addition, anced to belong is related, to low. self-esteem
(Pickett et:al.;'2004) and research to date; suggests. that child sex offenders typically have low
self-esteem (Marshall, Anderson & Champagne, 1997). This’ is supportive of. the idea ‘that.a
néed t6 belong ‘facilitates offenders” identification. and. access to a victim, ‘because of the
associated inercased sensitivity. to social cues. Children may be approached because the
offender perccives’them to be less:threatening than peers. Alternatively; offenders may be able
to identify vulnerabilities in, other, people because ‘they themselves are vulnerable and thus
recognize these signs. in. others. This explanation would relaté to ‘offenders ‘that. commit
offences. following implicit planning. Offenders ‘using explicit planning may'als6 havea. need
to belong and the associated increased sensitivity. to:social cues, as:a result,of a-need to belong
to the: family of community in order to,groom and. subsequently: abuse’a child. It is. therefore
suggested that, in. the presence of:a motivation ‘to sexually. abuseé a. child, a need to belong!
often facilitates. the’identification 6f:a victim and grooming of: the environment and significant
others.

Grooming ithe: child,

Grooming the child is the most commonly recognized form of sexual'grooming. In addition’to
a desire: for ‘sexual gratification,. there may or may‘not be: a relational ‘aspect to the ‘grooming
process, dependitig on the offenders motivation to: abuse. Sexual. grooming has ‘been
considered by somé ro. be analogous ‘to adiilt, courtship (¢-g: Howitt, 1995). In addition,
Herman (1981) and Christiansen and, Blake (1990) talk about sexually abusive fathers
adopting the role of ‘suitor towards their daughter. In the case of. intrafamilial ‘abuse, the
offender promotes the ‘child in-place of:the mother (Leberg, 1997). Alternatively, the offender
may interact’with the child.on ‘the child’s wavelength (van-Dam, 2001). Wilson (1.996 |
