B. Applicable Law

As a general matter, the Constitution “protects a defendant against a conviction based on
evidence of questionable reliability, not by prohibiting introduction of the evidence, but by
affording the defendant means to persuade the jury that the evidence should be discounted as
unworthy of credit.” Perry v. New Hampshire, 565 U.S. 228, 237 (2012). Eyewitness
identifications should therefore be excluded only where “improper police conduct” occurred that
was “so unnecessarily suggestive as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable
misidentification.” Jd. at 238-39; see Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 112-14 (1977); Simmons
v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968).

Federal courts follow a two-step analysis in ruling on the admissibility of identification

defendant must show that the identification was “so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to

States v. DiTommaso, 817 F.2d 201, 213 (2d Cir. 1987) (citation and internal quotation marks
omitted); see Raheem v. Kelly, 257 F.3d 122, 134 (2d Cir. 2001). This is a high threshold to meet,
as the defendant must show that, under the totality of the circumstances, there is “a very substantial
