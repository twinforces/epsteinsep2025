‘Similarly, the Sixth Circuit has found. that a district court properly admitted evidence of prior
consistent statements that, “rebutted, [the dJéfendant’s attack on [the :declarant’s] purportedly
faulty memory.” United States v. Cox, 871 F.3d.479, 487 (6th. Cir. 2017).

B.. Discussion.

The Government expects the Minor Victims 'to testify attrial about their experiences with,
the defendant and Jeffrey Epstein, including the sexual abuse to which they ‘were subjected, jin.
the 1990s and. carly’ ‘2000s. To: the extent the defendant; challenges the credibility of the
testimony: of the Minor Victims—whether :in opening statements.or. on. cross-examination—the
Government intends to call a number of witnesses to introduce certain of the Minor Victims’
prior consistent’ statements to witnesses about their experiences with the defendant and Epstein.
See, e.g., Flores, 945 F.3d at. 705-06 (admitting. prior consistent ‘statement .of ‘witness after
defense’s opening statement; called. into question, the witness’s. eredibility); United States, v.
Burrell, 43 F. App’x 403, 406 (2d. Cit. 2002) (allowing prior consistent statements, of cooperating
witness because the defendant “argued in ‘her opening statement. that the cooperating witnesses
had a motive to lic”).

Such testimony; is admissible under both.subparts (i) and (ii) of Rule 801(d)(1)(B). As to
subpart (i), if the defendant claims that, a Minor Victim recently fabricated. her testimony, the
admissibility of her prior consistent, statements will depend in. part. on the alleged “recent.
improper influence or motive in. so testifying.” ‘Because the: Minor Victims’ prior. consistent.
‘statements 'to witnesses, about their cxpericnees with the defendant and Epstcin were made well
over a decade ago, they’ are almost certain to qualify as. having been:made’prior'to any accusation.
