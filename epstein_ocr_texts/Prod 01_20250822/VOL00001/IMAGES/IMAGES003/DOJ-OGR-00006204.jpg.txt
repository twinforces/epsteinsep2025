(Id. at 9-10). The Court credited the Government’s proffer that “additional evidence, including
flight records and other witnesses’ corroborating testimony, will further support the main
witnesses’ testimony and link the Defendant to Epstein’s conduct.” (/d. at 10).

The Court found that the defendant “continues to have substantial international ties and
multiple foreign citizenships, and she continues to have familial and personal connections abroad.”
(/d. at 11). The Court was unpersuaded by the defendant’s offer to consent to extradition, noting
that the “legal weight of the waivers is, at best, contested” and therefore the risk of flight remained
“fundamentally unchanged.” (/d. at 11-13). The Court further explained that the defendant’s
“extraordinary financial resources also continue to provide her the means to flee the country and
to do so undetected.” (/d. at 13).

The Court emphasized that the defendant’s “pattern of providing incomplete or erroneous
information to the Court or to Pretrial Services bears significantly” on its assessment of her history
and characteristics. (/d. at 15). In so doing, the Court highlighted that in July 2020 the defendant
represented to Pretrial Services that she possessed around $3.5 million in assets, but in connection
with her renewed request for bail presented a report on her finances that estimated the net worth
of the defendant and her spouse to be approximately $22.5 million as of October 2020. (/d.). The
Court found that the difference “makes it unlikely that the misrepresentation was the result of the
Defendant’s misestimation rather than misdirection.” (/d. at 15-16). The Court explained:

In sum, the evidence ofa lack of candor is, if anything, stronger now
than in July 2020, as it is clear to the Court that the Defendant’s
representations to Pretrial Services were woefully incomplete. That
lack of candor raises significant concerns as to whether the Court
has now been provided a full and accurate picture of her finances
and as to the Defendant’s willingness to abide by any set of
conditions of release.
