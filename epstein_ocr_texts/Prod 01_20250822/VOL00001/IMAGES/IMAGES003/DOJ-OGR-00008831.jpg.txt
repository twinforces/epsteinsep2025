strong presumption of “contemporaneous access” to it. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 126. The right of
access exists primarily because “public monitoring [of courts] is an essential feature of
democratic control”. Amodeo IT, 71 F.3d at 1048. “[W]ithout access to testimony and
documents that are used in the performance of Article III functions”, it is not possible to
effectively understand and monitor the proceedings in this case that relate to Juror 50’s motion as
they take place. Id.

Finally, for many of the same reasons supporting access to Defendant’s motion for a new
trial, it appears unlikely there is “a substantial probability of harm to a compelling interest” that
would result from placing Juror 50’s motion on the public docket. See Under Seal v. Under Seal,
273 F. Supp. 3d 460, 469 (S.D.N.Y. 2017) (“A proponent of sealing may overcome the
presumption of access by demonstrating a substantial probability of harm to a compelling
interest.”). Juror No. 50’s privacy interest is particularly low here, given that he has voluntarily
disclosed his identity and history in various interviews. See In re Application to Unseal 98 Cr.
LIO1I(ILG), 891 F. Supp. 2d 296, 300 (E.D.N.Y. 2012). And the Court has already solicited
submissions from the parties regarding any proposed redactions, so the Court can assess whether
they may be discrete redactions, if any, that need be made to protect any other compelling
interest.

For all these reasons, ABC News and NBC News respectfully request that the Court
unseal Defendant’s motion for a new trial and Juror No. 50’s motion to intervene.
