It remains theorctically’possible:that Dr. Halls interview with Minor Victim-4: will’ become:
Government docs not expect that Minor’ Victim-4’s testimony will be contradicted by statements
she made to, Dr. Hall. And to be clear; Minor Victim-4’s expected testimony about the defendant’s
‘involvement in Epstein’s scheme. is not inconsistent with the fact that Minor Victim-4 did not
describe those instances to Dr, Hall. “It is-well settled that for two:statements to’ be inconsistent,
they need not be diametrically opposed. Nevertheless, the statements must be inconsistent.”

the Government belicves. that inthis :intervicw—unlike ‘the Hall intervicw—Minor Victim-4 was

asked questions that ‘would, have referenced the defendant in-a, complete answer, the Government.
