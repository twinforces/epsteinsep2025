It remains theoretically possible that Dr. Hall’s interview with Minor Victim-4 will become
relevant for impeaching her with a prior inconsistent statement. At present, however, the
Government does not expect that Minor Victim-4’s testimony will be contradicted by statements

his son was willing to give away certain guns was not inconsistent with the witness’s statement on
another occasion that his son was obsessed with different guns, or guns in general. /d. Similarly,
that Minor Victim-4 described to Dr. Hall certain aspects of Epstein’s abuse that did not involve
the defendant is not inconsistent with describing other aspects that did involve the defendant.

Victim-4 has not always disclosed the defendant’s role in Epstein’s abuse. Minor Victim-4 also
failed to mention the full extent of the defendant’s role during her first FBI interview. Because
the Government believes that in this interview—unlike the Hall interview—Minor Victim-4 was
asked questions that would have referenced the defendant in a complete answer, the Government
