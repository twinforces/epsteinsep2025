To determine whether sealing a document is appropriate, the Court must: engage in a-multi-

step process. First, the Court. must: determine whether the document ‘is a “judicial document: to
which a presumption of access would attach. Si/ver,.2016 WL 1572993, at *3 (citing Newsday
LEG y. Cty. of Nassau, 730F.3d 156, 166, 167 n.15 (2d Cir. 2013)). Ifitss a.“judicial document,”
the Court must next determine whether the common law right of access or the “more robust”
First Amendment right of'access applies. Jd. (citing Lugosch, 435.F.3d at 120). Ifthe document.is
‘subject'to the common, law right of ‘access, the Court must “determine the weight of the

presumption and. measure it against competing considerations.” Jd. (citing Wnited. States v. Erie

Gt. N.Y., 763. F.3d 235, 241, (2d Cir. 2014)); accord Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 119-20. If the
document:is subject.to the more stringent. First Amendment right of access, the Court: must
determine. “by specific, on the-record-findings whether higher'values necessitate a narrowly
tailored sealing.” /d. (cleaned up); accord Eugosch, 435. F 3d.at 124. In cither:case, the Court
‘must also determine whether redaction is “‘a'viable remedy,” or whether’the docunient presents ‘tan
all or nothing matter.” /d. (quoting Amodeo./I, 71 F.3d at 1053).
Discussion
