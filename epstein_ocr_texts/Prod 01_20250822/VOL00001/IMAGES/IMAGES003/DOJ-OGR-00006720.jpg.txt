that bonds victims to their abusers and prevents victims from disclosing that they have been
abused. !

These opinions stem in part from Dr. Rocchio’s personal familiarity and experience
treating victims of sexual abuse for decades. She is trained in trauma psychology, she has expertise
in treating victims of sexual abuse who have been subject to this pattern of behavior, and she
teaches residents about trauma psychology. Cf Bosco v. United States, No. 14 Civ. 3525 (JFK),
2016 WL 5376205, at *11 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 26, 2016) (expert testimony about “common knowledge
among urologists” require the expert to “draw upon the defining characteristics that make him a
member of that community: his training as a urological surgeon, his practical experience
performing several hundred ureteroscopies, and his knowledge as a clinical instructor of surgery”).

These opinions also stem from the relevant literature. This pattern of coercive attachment
is not a novel or outlier concept in the literature of trauma psychology. For instance, attached as
Exhibit A are some of the articles that have been provided by Dr. Rocchio and inform her
testimony. See Dietz, “Grooming and Seduction,” 33 J. of Interpersonal Violence 28, 34 (2018)
' The concepts of attachment and grooming encompass a variety of established techniques,
including: (1) the use of attention, love, and affection; (2) using bribery and gift giving; (3) sexual
desensitization—that is, talking to children about sex and engaging in touching; (4) isolating the
victim; and (5) engaging in emotional manipulation. Grooming efforts can also extend to
“srooming the environment.” Craven et al., “Sexual grooming of children: Review of literature
and theoretical considerations,” 3 J. of Sexual Aggression 287, 292-93 (2006) (“Some offenders
groom the environment by targeting single-parent families to gain [a position of trust].] Offenders
may do this because they believe that these children are more vulnerable and because they believe
it will be easier to create opportunities to be alone with the child. Alternatively, offenders may
target children or young people who have absent parents, and hence have less protection.” (citation
