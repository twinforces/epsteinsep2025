“frequently occurs” are not reliable, because’ she does not explain how’ these conclusions were’
reached, what.testing was involved, what, data she considered; or how her'conclusions can. be
verificd.

This is:exactly why the Court in. Wnited States v. Raymond excluded grooming testimony

sexual activity. In that ‘case, the expert: (Ken;Lanning) proposed to testify that “offenders who
prefer'younger child victims, are more likely to first ‘seduce’ the victim’s parents, to gain their
trust and obtain increased access to' the potential victim” and that “[i]n:my experience, many
valid claims of child sexual molestation, especially. those by compliant.child-victims, involve the
delayed disclosurés, inconsistenciés, varying accounts, éxaggcrations, and lics often. associated
with false allegations.” 700 F. Supp. 2d. at 148. The Court excluded this testimony as unreliable,
explaining:

Nowhere docs ‘Lanning cite an objective benchmark’ for these frequencies or
comparisons, What ‘is: “more likely”? Fifty-one: percent? How: many sis “many”?
How few is: “some’? What. is the error rate ‘for ‘Lanning’s behavioral
generalizations? ‘Can Lanning’s opinions, be tested or challenged in.any objective
sense? Nowhere do, I see any’ discussion, of falsc positives. How ‘many: cases has
Lanning found ‘where people who, possess, all the. characteristics he describes.
nevertheless turn out to: be innocent or where victims who behave as he: describes:
turns out:to: be lying? Has‘he even looked forisuch ‘examples? For. all I'can tell, that
number may be ‘more, fewer, or the same as, the thousands of cases ‘he says that he
has investigated: where 'a.defendant:turned out-to be g guilty. or where a‘victim turned.
out to be telling the truth. And. are these rules of exclusion, or only of inclusion?
For'example, Lanning describes what the “grooming: or seduction process. usually
consists of.” But what if a defendant. fails to do one of the: things that Lanning’s
child molester would. usually do? Can the defendant then argue to the jury that he
must therefore not hayve’been grooming 'a child?

Id. at 148-49 (citations.and footnote omitted). This Court.should apply the teachings of Raymond

to this case.
