1 The jury department will provide the completed

2 questionnaires to the U.S. Attorney's Office for copying. The

3 U.S. Attorney's Office will provide copies to the defense.

4 I've been informed by the jury department that this is the

5 standard practice for the administrative tasks, but certainly

6 let me know if either side has a different proposal to

7 effectuate that administrative task of copying the completed

8 questionnaires.

9 After reviewing the completed questionnaires, counsel
10 must then confer in good faith and jointly submit to the Court
11 four lists:

12 No. 1, prospective jurors that both sides agree should
13 proceed to voir dire;
14 Two, prospective jurors that both sides agree should
15 be excused;
16 Three, prospective jurors that the defense but not the
17 government believes should be excused; and
18 Fourth, prospective jurors that the government but not
19 the defense believes should be excused.
20 I want to pause for a moment because I heard a chime.
al Ms. Williams, I just want to confirm that we have
22 Ms. Maxwell and counsel and the court reporter still on the
23 line.
24 THE DEPUTY CLERK: Yes, Judge. That's someone coming
25 into the room.
