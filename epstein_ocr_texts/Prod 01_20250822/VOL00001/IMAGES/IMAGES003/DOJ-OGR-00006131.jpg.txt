Inferences

During the trial, and as I give you these instructions, you have heard and will hear the
term “inference.” For instance, in their closing arguments, the attorneys have asked you to infer,
based on your reason, experience, and common sense, from one or more established facts, the
existence of some other fact. I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it
involves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.

What is an “inference”? What does it mean to “infer” something? An inference is not a
suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists
based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.

There are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by
direct or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while
the defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you
will draw.

The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a matter of guesswork or
speculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permitted but not
required to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial
evidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.

Therefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from
the facts that you find to be proven, such reasonable inferences as would be justified in light of
your experience.

Some inferences, however, are impermissible. You may not infer that the-defendantMs.
