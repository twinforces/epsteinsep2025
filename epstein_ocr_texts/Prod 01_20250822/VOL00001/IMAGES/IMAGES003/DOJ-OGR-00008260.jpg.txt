1 witness counsel in that room when that witness is testifying.

2 THE COURT: That's a question for the district

3 executive's office.

4 MS. COMEY: Understood, your Honor. I imagine the

5 same would be true for supervisors of the government. That

6 question would go to the district executive's office?

7 THE COURT: It does.

8 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.

9 I have nothing else. Thank you.

10 THE COURT: Okay. Yes.

11 MR. EVERDELL: Yes, your Honor. One brief issue that
12 I am not asking the Court to do anything about, but I want to
13 make the Court aware of it. The defense has made a number of
14 Touhy requests, thus far in the case.

15 I want to raise with the Court one in particular where
16 we've asked for a witness to authenticate certain border

17 crossing records, a witness from the Customs and Border

18 Protection. The government has been working to get a witness
19 and make one available to us. The request was made several
20 weeks ago.
21 I want to flag this for the Court because, as I
22 understand it from the government, there is some complications
23 with this issue. But we do expect to have a witness available
24 to us to be able to authenticate these documents, unless we
25 reach some agreement as to authenticity in a stip.
