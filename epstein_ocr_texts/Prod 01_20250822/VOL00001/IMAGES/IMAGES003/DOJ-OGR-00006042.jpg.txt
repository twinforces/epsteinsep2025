Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The parties have conferred about the estimate of the trial length as directed by the Court on
November 1, 2021. The parties’ estimates of the length of their cases remain the same (see Dkt.
No. 340), and accordingly, the parties continue to estimate a six-week trial.

Respectfully submitted,
DAMIAN WILLIAMS
