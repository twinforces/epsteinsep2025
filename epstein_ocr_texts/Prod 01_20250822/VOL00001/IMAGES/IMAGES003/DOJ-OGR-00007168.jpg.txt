have all our factS straight about ‘the exact timeline. So I am
happy to address that in the letter.

THE COURT: Yes, do address that in the letter.

Is there anything the government can do -- you know,,.

there is going to be Somé ‘time built in for the facilities

screening process and it getting to the defendant. Obviously

there are other individuals ‘ih, thé sdme si'tuation pretrial,
heading into trial, and there are’ a lot of inmates, but -- so
you will address what's happéning on the institution side in
the letter.

What. can the government do to facilitate the process
going forward?

MS. MOE: Your Hoénor, we have been trying to producté

materials as quickly as possible. We have been FedExing those

materials promptly to the facility. When we do s6, wé notify
the facility that, in particular, a disclosure ‘Lor this
defendant. is in=béund to the facility so that. legal counsél
knows. about it and can, keep an, eye out for it which I think is
unusual but we are happy to Ccéntanue to take that stép in this

case.

My understanding is that. materials have been recéivéd
by the defendant, at the facility. We will continue to check on
that issue. I would fote that our rolling productions are
going to be frequent but also small as we continue to meet with
witnesses and produce small amounts of rolling materials. TI
