Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 406 Filed 11/02/21 Page4of6

The government makes many unfounded accusations including that the timely
disclosure of potential experts is “gamesmanship.” The simple truth here is that avoiding
a direct conferral about a straightforward task such as selecting one of three dates while
drafting a three-page rant a few hours before the filing deadline is not mere gamesmanship,
it is unprofessional gamesmanship. A few observations are in order:

First, the reason we are required to hold a Daubert hearing in this case is that the
government endorsed an expert to talk about subjects that are not widely accepted by
qualified experts in the field. She has no methodology or studies that support her theories,
and most of her opinions will be confusing, not help the jury, and do not fit the facts of this
case,

Second, at the government’s request and over the objection of the defense, the Court
accelerated the Rule 412 notice requirement. The defense did not attempt to game this
deadline by, for example, complaining about various deficiencies in the delayed roll out of
3500 material, but instead complied with the Order.

Third, the government, while casting unfounded criticism at defense counsel about the
need for the 3500 materials to adequately determine the scope and type of expert testimony,
fails to advise the Court that Exhibits C and F to the expert disclosures (the list of materials
reviewed by Drs. Dietz and Hall, respectively), include hundreds of pages of 3500 material.

Fourth, no Daubert hearing would be appropriate for Dr. Dietz, Dr. Loftus or Dr. Hall.
Each is well qualified, have been accepted by hundreds of courts as experts, and their
opinions are based on science, not “trauma clinical” pseudoscience.
