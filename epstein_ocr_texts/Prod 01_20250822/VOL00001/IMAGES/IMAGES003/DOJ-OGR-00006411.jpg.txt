Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 438 Filed 11/12/21 Page 51o0f54

Accordingly, the Court should require the defense to make an offer of proof. before
‘permitting any questioning or argument alleging ‘that the defendant is a ‘victini of abuse by

confusing to the: jury. ‘It would primarily serve to invite ‘the jury to feel. sympathy for. the

defendant, providing an unlawful ‘basis. for jury nullification. At best, it would confuse, the jury
