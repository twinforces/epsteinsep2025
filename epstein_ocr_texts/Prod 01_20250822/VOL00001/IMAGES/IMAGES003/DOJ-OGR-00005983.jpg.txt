Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document398 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page 28 of 52

The government:denics Ms. Maxwell’s argument 'that.“a. lay jury will’ be unable to
apply Dr. Rocchio’s analyses to the facts of this case” because “[t]hat is not-how
Rule ‘702 works.” Resp. at 20. Responds the government: “That is precisely how’
Rule 702 works in-cases where experts testify about general principles, which the
Rule contemplates.” /d.at 21. Surcly that is not right when, as here, the “general
principles” are unreliable. Fed. R. Evid. 702, Advisory Committee Note (if expert
testifics. to general principles but. not-apply them, “the testimony [must] be
reliable”). See also Mot. at 10; Raymond, 700 °F. Supp. 2d. at 150.n.12 (expert:
testimony about. general principles is helpful. only when it “describe[es] widely
recognized and highily predictable and verifiable phenomena”).

The government.attempts to faultMs. Maxwell :for making “no argument that the
minor victims in this case are distinctive in some way'such, that general principles
of psychology may diverge as to'them.” Resp. at’ 18. This argument flips'the
proper analysis‘on its-head..Its the: government’s burden.to prove reliability. /.g.,
United States vy. Williams, 506 F.3d.151, 160 (2d Cir. 2007). It’s not:Ms.

The governmentsays that “the: causal. connection between . . . psychological
problems and child sexual, abuse is outside the experience of the average juror”
and is relevant to the alleged victims” eredibility. Resp. .at.24. It’s not, and.any
minor probative value the: evidence has is substantially outweighed by the danger
of‘unfair prejudice. Fed. R. Evid. 401,403.And as explained in the Rule 412

motion today; if Rocchio offers testimony: and the government presents argument
