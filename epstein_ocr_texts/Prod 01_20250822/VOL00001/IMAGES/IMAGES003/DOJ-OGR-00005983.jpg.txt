Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document398 Filed 10/29/21 Page 28 of 52

e The government denies Ms. Maxwell’s argument that “a lay jury will be unable to
apply Dr. Rocchio’s analyses to the facts of this case” because “[t]hat is not how
Rule 702 works.” Resp. at 20. Responds the government: “That is precisely how
Rule 702 works in cases where experts testify about general principles, which the
Rule contemplates.” /d. at 21. Surely that is not right when, as here, the “general
principles” are unreliable. Fed. R. Evid. 702, Advisory Committee Note (if expert
testifies to general principles but not apply them, “the testimony [must] be
reliable”). See also Mot. at 10; Raymond, 700 F. Supp. 2d at 150 n.12 (expert
testimony about general principles is helpful only when it “describe[es] widely
recognized and highly predictable and verifiable phenomena”).

e The government attempts to fault Ms. Maxwell for making “no argument that the
minor victims in this case are distinctive in some way such that general principles
of psychology may diverge as to them.” Resp. at 18. This argument flips the
proper analysis on its head. It’s the government’s burden to prove reliability. E.g.,
United States v. Williams, 506 F.3d 151, 160 (2d Cir. 2007). It’s not Ms.
Maxwell’s burden to prove unreliability (though if it were her burden, she would
have met it).

e The government says that “the causal connection between . . . psychological
problems and child sexual abuse is outside the experience of the average juror”
and is relevant to the alleged victims’ credibility. Resp. at 24. It’s not, and any
minor probative value the evidence has is substantially outweighed by the danger
of unfair prejudice. Fed. R. Evid. 401, 403. And as explained in the Rule 412
motion today, if Rocchio offers testimony and the government presents argument
