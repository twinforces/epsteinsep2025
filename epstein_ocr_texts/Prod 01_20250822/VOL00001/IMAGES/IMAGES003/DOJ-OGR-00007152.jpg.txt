1 argument that the Ms. Maxwell's photo looks like a mugshot and
2 is different from the others doesn't persuade me here. Alleged
3 Victim-4 identified at least one other photo in the array that

16 must consider under the totality of circumstances that include
17 the opportunity of the witness to view the individual at the

18 time of the alleged crime, the witness's degree of attention,
19 the accuracy of the the witness's prior description of the
20 individual, the level of uncertainty demonstrated, the length
21 of time between the alleged crime and the confrontation. See,

24 Ms. Maxwell. They interacted several times over the span of
25 years. As the government points out, the alleged interactions
