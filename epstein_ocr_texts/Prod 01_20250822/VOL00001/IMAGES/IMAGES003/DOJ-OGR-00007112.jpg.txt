9 information for some minor victims under a certain heading that
10 has relevance to the case and organized in a certain way that
11 is consistent with victim testimony. So, whether the defendant
12 held on to that or maintained it following the conclusion of

13 the charged conspiracy, it would nonetheless be relevant to

14 establish the defendant's knowledge to confirm her contact with
15 those victims and to be corroborative of other exhibits at

16 trial.

18 created or maintained until after the charged conspiracy, is it
19 relevant?
20 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
21 If, at the conclusion of the conspiracy, the defendant
22 nonetheless memorialized that information about those victims,
23 it would nonetheless be relevant to her knowledge to rebut
24 arguments that she didn't know the victims or have contact with
25 them and so certainly that would be relevant, your Honor.
