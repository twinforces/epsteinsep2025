LB1 5MAX 2:

But take ‘the example, if ‘you would, that a document
that, on its face, post-dates the charged conspiracy, for what
pulrposé would you be offéring ‘that? And let's use the address
beok as an example,

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

With respect. to that particular document, the

testimony wotild bé ‘that that document belonged to ‘the defendant
and. that she -- and. the document itself would include contact
information for some minor Victims under a cértaiin heading that

has relevance to the case and organized in. a certain way that

1S consistent with victim testimony. So, whether the defendant
held on to that or maintained it, following the conclusion of,

the chargéd conspiracy, it would rnionetheless be relevant to

establish the defendant's. knowledge to confirm her contact with
thosé victims and to be Cdérrobordative of 6ther exhibits at
trial.

THE COURT: If thé 46vidernée were that it wasn't

created or maintained until after the charged conspiracy, 1S it
relevant?

MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.

If, at the cdénclusion of the conspiracy, the defendant

nonetheless memorialized that information about those victims,

it would nonetheléss be relevant to her knowledge to rebut
arguments that. she didn't, know the victims or have contact with
them and so certainly that would be relevant; your Honor.
