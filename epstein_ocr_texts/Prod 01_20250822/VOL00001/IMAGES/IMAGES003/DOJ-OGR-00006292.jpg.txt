SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

These 11 pathways merit further investigation and supplementation if addi-
tional pathways are identified. Ascertaining the psychological processes
and functioning of a claimant may help explain possible motivations and
information processing errors that could lead to an untruthful claim. Binder
and McNeil (2007) underline the utility of psychological evaluation as a tool
in the assessment of accusers and the accused, though they also stress the
importance of examining these in the context of the presence or absence
of corroborating evidence. Without corroborating evidence, forensic eval-
uators must acknowledge that “he said, she said” sexual assault cases are
inherently difficult to assess for truth and that truth is unlikely to be found
in its entirety within the results of psychological evaluation. Nevertheless,
psychological evaluations may inform forensic evaluators of psychological
processes by which a person may either intentionally or unintentionally file
a false allegation of sexual assault. The results of a psychological evaluation
are not intended merely as a useful tool for the defense; evaluation may
also help establish the veracity of a claimant’s account of events and may be
relevant for a prosecutor’s decisions to pursue an indictment.

In proposing these pathways, it is important to acknowledge that psy-
chological evaluations should serve only as corroborating evidence and
should not be construed as sufficient evidence upon which to determine
truth. All evidence must be weighed appropriately to assess the veracity of a
claim. Forensic evaluators must also be aware that some psychological disor-
ders are more likely to be associated with experiences of sexual assault and
abuse. For example, certain populations such as the intellectually disabled
and other populations with cognitive difficulties may be at an increased risk
of sexual assault. These risks should be assessed and weighed appropriately
in conjunction with all of the evidence in cases where the claimant may
have difficulty communicating or recalling the entire event.

The legal system has an obligation to be mindful of discrimination faced
by victims and biases faced by the accused. Further investigation of path-
ways and other possible causal mechanisms of false allegations may help
elucidate more evidence that can be utilized in the determination of truth in
a sexual assault case.
