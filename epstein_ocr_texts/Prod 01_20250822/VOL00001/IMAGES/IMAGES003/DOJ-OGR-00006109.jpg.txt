| 2. Did Ms. Maxwell the defendant knowingly and willfully associate herself with the
criminal venture?
| 3. Did Ms. Maxwell the defendant seek by her actions to make the criminal venture
succeed?
If she did, then Ms. Maxwell the-defendantis an aider and abettor, and therefore guilty of
the offense. If, on the other hand, your answer to any of these questions is “no,” then Ms.
Maxwell the defendant is not an aider and abettor, and you must find her not guilty under that
theory.
