Re: United States‘v. Ghislaine.Maxwell,'S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government writes in response to the ‘Court’s orderiof December: 16, 2021.

First, Rule: 613(b) provides that extrinsic: evidence of :a. witness’s prior inconsistent
‘statement, is admissible only if the: witness is given “an opportunity to explain, or deny the
statement.” The: Rule thus:provides'the district court with the:discretion to, require that the alleged.
inconsistent: statement itsclf be shown'to the witness, in order to afford.the:witness'the opportunity:
to explain it. U/nited States v. Marks, 816°F.2d 1207, 1210-11 (7th Cir. 1987). As the Seventh,
Circuit has explained, this is particularly important in:the. context of documents likes FBI reports,

If defense counsel had been reading from. a, transcript of ‘a, previous trial or
deposition, there would have been no-justification forthe district judge's: procedure.
But since a statement appearing ‘in an ‘interview: report could casily be g garbled, yet
scem authoritative when.read. from a paper that'the jury would: infer-was an official.
