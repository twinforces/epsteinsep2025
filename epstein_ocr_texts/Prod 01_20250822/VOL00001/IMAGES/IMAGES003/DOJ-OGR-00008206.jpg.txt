Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20. Cr. 330 (AIN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

During her cross-examination, Jane denicd.knowing that cooperating with the
government. in the prosecution of Ms., Maxwell and testifying against. her would help her civil
case against Ms. Maxwell and her claim for compensation ‘from the Epstcin Victims’
Compensation Program (EVCP). Because: Jane denied-having this.knowledge, Ms. Maxwell has
‘a,constitutional right-to call Jane’s. attorney (Robert ‘Glassman).as a witness and'to ask him
whether he told. Jane that cooperating and testifying against her would “help her case.” U.S.

Const. amends. V, VI. This issuc is relevant'to Jane’s motive to cooperate and testify," and. it’s

| Davis v. Alaska, 415 U.S.308, 316 (1974) (“A more particular attack on the witness’
credibility is ¢ffeeted by means of cross-cxamination directed toward revealing possible biases,
prejudices, or ulterior motives of the Witness .as they:may relate directly to issues. of'personalitics,
in-the case at hand. The: partiality of.a witness is subject to exploration. at. trial, and.is always
relevant as discrediting the witness and affecting:the weight.of his testimony.” (quotation
omitted)).
