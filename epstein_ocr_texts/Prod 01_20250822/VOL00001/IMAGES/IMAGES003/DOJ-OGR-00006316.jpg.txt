1 the case, and the information will not affect whether or not you are selected to serve as a juror in
2 this case. Finally, the form will be destroyed at the conclusion of trial.

3 To conduct the next phase of the process, I will ask each of you some questions

4 individually. Weâ€™ll do that in a separate courtroom where I and the lawyers and the Defendant

5 are sitting now. You all will be brought in the courtroom one at a time. Bear in mind that this is

19 anaccusation. It is not evidence and it doesn't mean that Ms. Maxwell is guilty of anything. You
20 can't assume that she is guilty or more likely to be guilty just because she's been charged in an

21 indictment and alleged to have committed the crimes charged.-with commiting these-crimes.
22. ~+That's the reason we have trials, to determine whether the Government can prove a defendant's
