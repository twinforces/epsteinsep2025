1 The government anticipates that the alleged victims

2 will â€œtestify in explicit detail and/or be the subject of

3 highly sensitive and personal testimony concerning illegal

4 sexual abuse. Thus, there's good reasons to limit public

5 disclosure of their names and specifically identifying

6 information during trial in this highly publicized case

7 involving highly sensitive issues."

8 Since there is a valid reason to limit disclosure in

9 this case, the defense must proffer a particularized need for
10 the disclosure of the relevant information, which is weighed

11 against the risks to the witnesses. I'll cite here, for

12 example, United States v. Marcus, again citing the Second

13 Circuit case in United States v. Marti.

14 As both parties acknowledge, the government's request
15 potentially implicates the defendant's right under the Sixth

16 Amendment's confrontation clause which guarantees defendants

17 the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The Second

18 Circuit has identified two central interests defendants have in
19 the public airing of identifying information about witnesses.
20 Again referencing the Marti case, 421 F.2d 1263.
21 The first is not relevant here because, as I have
22 noted, the defense is aware of the alleged victims' and
23 witnesses' identities.
24 The defendant argues that the second interest,
25 however, is implicated. Namely, defense may need the witness
