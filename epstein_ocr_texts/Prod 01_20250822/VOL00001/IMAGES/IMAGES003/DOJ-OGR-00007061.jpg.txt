LBLTMAX1

The government anticipatés that the allégéed wictims
will "testify in explicit detail and/or be the subject of
highly sensitive and personal, ‘testimony concerning illegal
sexual abuse. Thus, there's good reasons. to limit public
disélosure of théir names, and specifically identifying
information during trial in this highly publicized case
involving highly sensitive issues."

Since there is a valid. reason. to Limit disclosure Ain

this casé, the defense must proffer a particuldarized need for
the disclosure of the relevant information, which is weighed
against the risks to the witnesses. I'll cite here, for
example, United States v. Marcus, again citing the Second
Circuit case in United Statés v; Marti.

As both parties acknowledge, ‘the government."s request

potentially implicates the defendant's right undér the Sixth

Amendment.'s confrontation clause which guarantees defendants
the right. to Gross=examine adverse witnesses. The Sécond
Cincuat has identified two. central interests defendants have in
the public airing of identifying information about witnesses.

Again meferencing ‘the Marti case, 421, F.2d 1263.

The first is not. televant here because; as I have
noted, the defense is aware of the alleged victims: and
witnesses! identities:

The defendant argues that the second interest,
however, is implicated. Namely, defense may need the witness
