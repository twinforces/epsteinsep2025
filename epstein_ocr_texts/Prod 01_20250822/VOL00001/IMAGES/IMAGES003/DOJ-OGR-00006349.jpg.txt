Holdings, Inc., No. 16-CV-2242 (VEC), 2020 WL 1503452, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 30, 2020)
(quoting 4 Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 702.03 (2019)); see also United States v. Mulder, 273

during anticipated cross-examination. The Court also concludes that these opinions satisfy the
other relevant Daubert requirements. Namely, they would assist the jury in understanding
concepts that require expert knowledge without directing the jury to reach any conclusion as to a
