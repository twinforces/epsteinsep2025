The government; attempts to marginalize this ‘Court’s legitimate concern. about highly
mobile items. But:the Court’s concern is well founded. Twenty-five years have ‘passed sinée Jane
was at’Mr. Epstcin’s house. Artwork: is highly mobile. Furniture is highly mobile. Massage tables
are highly mobile. (The government carricd one such table into'the, well of the courtroom.)
‘Curtains are casily changed and replaced. The list goes on. So, absent at least some:testimony on.
the subject, there ‘is no reason.to think that. these highly mobile :items depicted in the 2019 photos
are the: same. highly‘mobile items that.Jane says she saw (though not in'the massage:room) in
1994 or 1995 or 1996.

Indeed, the government: now disavows any argument “that theparticular nude artwork, in
the exhibits. was present’while Jane, was abused.” Gov: Letter at 8. But'if that’s so, then there’s
no probative valuc to'the unauthenticated photographs, particular-when, as the Court
acknowledged, the government already “ha[s] [Jane’s] description in” evidence. TR, 12/3/2021, p:
1077:3.

Because the government has not authenticated the 2019 photos as accurate
‘representations of Mr. Epstein’s housé in 1994 or 1995 or 1996, they are irrelevant. But even if,
they-were relevant, this Court could still exclude them as unfairly misleading and prejudicial.
Fed. R. Evid. 403. ‘They are, misleading because, as. MeCormick.recognizes, the government has
not shown-the lack of changed conditions. § 215. Photographs, 2.McCormick on Evid. §.21.5 (8th
after the charged conspiracy, they. have no connection to Ms..Maxwell, and. they. are

‘inflammatory. Fed. R. Evid. 403.
