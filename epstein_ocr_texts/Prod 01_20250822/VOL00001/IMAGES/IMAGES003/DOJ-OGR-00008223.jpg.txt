Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter regarding the Court’s instruction in
advance of the testimony of Witness-3. Consistent with the Court’s order, the Government is
planning to elicit from Witness-3 only basic information about sexual activity that occurred with
Epstein (e.g., that it occurred, that Epstein initiated it, that it happened in the context of a
massage, and the locations of the sexualized massages), without eliciting any details. The
Government is concerned, however, that asking leading questions and obviously avoiding the
details of the sexual activity will cause the jury to infer that the lack of detail reflects a lack of
credibility. See, e.g., 11/29/21 Tr. at 54 (defense opening argument that “they are going to
recount things that they claim happened to them decades and decades ago. They are not going to
be able to pinpoint dates... .”).
