Re:  United:States'v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 .20'Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully. submits this, Ictter regarding’ the Court’s instruction -in
advance of the testimony: of Witness-3. ‘Consistent with the Court’s order, the Government is
planning to clicit from, Witness-3 only basic information about sexual activity that occurred-with
Epstein (¢.¢., that, it occurred, that Epstein initiated it, that: it. happened in the context, of.a
massage, and the locations of the:sexualized massages), without cliciting any details. The
Government is concerned, however, that asking leading questions and, obviously avoiding the:
details of the sexual. activity will cause-the jury'to. infer that the lack of detail reflects .a lack of
eredibility:, See, e.g., 11/29/21 Tr, at.S4 (defense opening argument that “they are going to
recount. things that they claim happened to them decades and decades ago. They: are not: going to

be.able:to pinpoint.dates ... .”).
