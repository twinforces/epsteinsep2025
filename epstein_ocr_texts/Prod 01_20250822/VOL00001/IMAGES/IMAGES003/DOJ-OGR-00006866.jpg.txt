justified. Hershkowitz et al. (2007) interviewed children about their initial
disclosures prior to formal interview and 50 per cent of the sample (n = 30)
reported feeling afraid or ashamed of their parents’ reaction. The authors reported
that parents did show a tendency to blame their children and react angrily to
the disclosure.

Recent research has highlighted the need for children to be asked direct
questions to facilitate their disclosure. Of those children who did disclose,
significant proportions disclosed following prompts rather than it being
initiated by the child (Kogan, 2004). Qualitative studies drawing on interviews

were identified by McElvaney as a factor that helped young people to tell.
Thus, many children may not have told about their experiences of abuse
because they were not asked. McGee ef al. (2002) followed up a sample of
their respondents who had disclosed childhood abuse for the first time in their
survey. When asked why they had not disclosed prior to the survey, many
cette respondents noted that it was because they had not been asked. Increasingly,

Implications for Practice
The consensus in the research literature at the present time is that disclosure is
multi-determined, influenced by a complex range of factors that may influence
each child in a different way. Large-scale national probability studies confirm
that non-disclosure and delays in disclosure are significant problems facing
society and in particular for those professionals tasked with safeguarding the
wellbeing of children. Children’s fears and anxieties in relation to telling need
to be understood and contained by those in their environment so that early
. . . disclosure can be encouraged and facilitated.
