Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 404 _ Filed 11/02/21 Page5of6

1 of this case at all. If you see something in the paper or online, you're just going to have to turn

2 the page or close the browser. You can't read it.

3 Equally important, you're not permitted to discuss this case with anyone else while the

4 case is going on. Even with your fellow jurors, you can't discuss the case until you've heard all

5 the evidence and Iâ€™ve given my instructions on the law. Again, that's because you can only

6 consider the evidence that you hear in the courtroom, not anything outside of the courtroom. You

7 have to keep an open mind. Nor may you discuss the case with friends or family until after your

8 jury service is complete. You can tell them that you are a juror in a criminal case in federal court

9 and that the judge has told you that you are not permitted to say anything further.
10 Similarly, until you are excused from jury service, you cannot post anything about your
11 experience as a juror on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok or any kind of social media.
12 Another instruction, you can't look up or google or do any other kind of search about anything
13. related to the case or anyone involved in the case.
14 The reason for these rules, as I am sure you understand, is they protect the integrity of the
15 trial and assure that both sides receive a fair trial.
16 Jurors in criminal cases base their verdicts on the evidence that they hear in the
17. courtroom, not on something that somebody else tells you, not on something that you see on TV
18 or on social media. That's why if you're selected as a juror, I'll be reminding you of these rules
19 regularly. You can't watch news accounts, look anything up or speak to anybody else about the
20 case. You would be violating the oath you have taken as jurors and you would be violating my
21 ~~ orders if you were to do that.
22 Finally, you must report to me through my court deputy any effort by any person to speak
23 with you about the case or to influence you about the case or to get information about the case.
