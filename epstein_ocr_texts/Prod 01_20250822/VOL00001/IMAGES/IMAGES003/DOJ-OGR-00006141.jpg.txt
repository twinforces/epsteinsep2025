Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 75 of 93
Law Enforcement and Government Employee Witnesses
You have heard testimony from law enforcement officials and employees of the
Government. The fact that a witness may be employed by the Federal Government as a law
enforcement official or employee does not mean that his or her testimony is necessarily
deserving of more or less consideration or greater or lesser weight than that of an ordinary
witness.
In this context, defense counsel is allowed to try to attack the credibility of such a
witness on the ground that his or her testimony may be colored by a personal or professional
interest in the outcome of the case.
It is your decision, after reviewing all the evidence, whether to accept the testimony of
the law enforcement or Government employee witness and to give to that testimony the
weight you find it deserves.

Jones, 16 Cr. 553 (AJN) and in United States v. Pizarro, 17 Cr. 151
(AJN).
