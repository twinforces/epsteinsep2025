Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document507 Filed 11/24/21 Page 22 of 28
Wi. THE COURT SHOULD PRECLUDE THE TESTIMONY OF BENNETT
GERSHMAN
The defense proposes to call Bennett Gershman, a professor of law at Pace University, for
the following testimony:
We expect Professor Gershman to provide testimony on best
practices to ensure the integrity of any prosecution, focusing on
investigation, witness preparation, media contact, neutrality,
obligations to provide accurate information, and relationship
with crime victims, their counsel, and case-related civil
litigation.

(Ex. A at 12).

This testimony should be precluded as irrelevant. At the conference on November 1, 2021,
the Court precluded “affirmative evidence by the defense that goes to the thoroughness of the
investigation,” (11/01/21 Tr. at 17:15-17), including “evidence of the public outcry and scrutiny
that preceded the decision to charge the defendant,” (id. at 21:1-9), as well as evidence regarding
“why and when the government conducted the investigation,” including any defense evidence that
the Government “has a legally improper motive for prosecuting [the defendant] or somehow [is]
fabricating evidence or suborning perjury or the like,” (id. at 23:2-6). The Court reaffirmed the
settled law in this Circuit that “the government is not on trial.” (/d. at 23:10-11 (quoting United
States v. Knox, 687 F. App’x 51 (2d Cir. 2017))). To the extent evidence similar to this evidence
is permissible, the Court concluded that it was permitted only as “relevant cross-examination of
the government’s witnesses.” (/d. at 27:19-29:24).

Gershman’s proposed testimony is relevant only to the defense theories that the Court has
precluded. This testimony invites the jury to conclude that either the New York investigation or
Florida investigation—or both—lacked “integrity.” (Ex. A at 12). Whether that supposed lack of
