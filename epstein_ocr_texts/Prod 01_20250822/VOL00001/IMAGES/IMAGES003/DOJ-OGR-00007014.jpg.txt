1 acoustical issues that I would hope might be addressed by the
2 tech department.
3 THE COURT: We've spent a fair amount of time talking
4 about that, and the acoustics won't be as good as they would be
S in 500 Pearl, but there are other very good reasons to be where
6 we'll be. I can assure you that the D.E.'S Office and my
7 chambers will continue to work to make it as good as it can
8 possibly be in an old courtroom. But I feel confident, based
9 on what we've done so far and what I hope will continue to be
10 the case, that it's going to work well.
11 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.
12 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I wanted to just raise one
13 issue, which is that the government is aware of certain
14 courtroom sketches of Jeffrey Epstein at, I believe, 500 Pearl,
15 and so just wanted to raise that for the Court and
16 understanding that such sketches would be removed before the
17 selection process.
18 THE COURT: OK. I think that's a good suggestion, and
19 I will talk to the D.E.'S Office.
20 MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you very much, your Honor.
al THE COURT: Anything else?
22 Ms. Pomerantz.
23 MS. POMERANTZ: Nothing further. Thank you.
24 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim.
25 MS. STERNHEIM: Nothing further. I do thank the
