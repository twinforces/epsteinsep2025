protocols that. you've just deseribed. But has thé Cotirt made a

determination with regard to whether we are sitting the week

from, Chyistmas to New Year's? Because I noticed on some of the

individuals on your list, it appeared that they were people who
might not be available that week. I'm just asking for some
clarification.

THE COURT: Yes. I think, we do néeéd to Sit Monday,
Tuesday and Wednesday of that week.. I think there were enough
responses of folks who had travel beginnting the 23rd, so the
Thursday if I had that right.

We will sit the 20th, 21st and 22nd. And I think I
had, been thinking to sit, the 23rd as well, but I think there
were enough individuals who we're bringing back who indicated
that. travel began then. So I think someone who has got travel
beginning on the 23rd is not an issue. The 20th, 21st or 22nd
wouldn,'t. be ‘an issue.

MS. STERNHEIM: For the foll6wing week, are you
following a similar is schedule?

THE GOURT: I think we can sit through THursday. The
way the holidays fall ‘this yearn, I do think we have to use that
tame. So the 27th, 28th, 29th, afd 30th we'll sit. We won't.
sit the 31st, which 1s New Year's Eve.

Any Other questidns about voir dire?

MS. COMEY: No, your Honor.

THE COURT: I'm not going to give rulings now, but to
