in creating and structuring the terms of the Protocol.”)). The risk of confusing the issues and
wasting time at trial substantially outweigh any probative value in the evidence the defendant
might obtain.

This is not a trial about the scope and adjudicative process of the EVCP. All of this should
be precluded, and therefore none of it is admissible under Nixon. The defendant is able to make
arguments about bias and consistency without issuing a subpoena that is unlikely to yield relevant

D. Communications

Finally, the subpoena calls for communications between EVCP and the Minor Victims and
their counsel. The term “communications” is defined broadly, covering “all forms of
correspondence, including regular mail, email, text messages, memorandum, or other written
communication of information of any kind.”

This subpoena request is a classic fishing expedition that the Court should quash. There is
no reason to believe that the Minor Victim or their counsel would make substantive statements,
which might be inconsistent, in emails and text messages. The defendant offers no reason why
their theory of bias would find support in correspondence. Nor is one supported by logic: the
theory is that the Minor Victims told false stories to the Government to advance the prosecution,
not that they did or said biased things to the EVCP. This subpoena does not seek to “obtain
identified evidence” but rather to engage in “a general ‘fishing expedition’ that attempts to use the

by Minor Victims and releases signed by them. (Def. Mot. Ex. 1 Attachment A). Those items
should be treated identically to the specific requests for them, as discussed above.
