Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 444 Filed 11/12/21 Page6of21
Accuser-3 were illegal. Indeed, referring to Accuser-3 in the indictment as “Minor Victim-3” is
entirely misleading — there is no evidence that she was a “minor” when any of the alleged sex
acts took place.

Nevertheless, even after the defense pointed out in our pretrial motions that Accuser-3
was not a minor and had not alleged any illegal conduct, the government repeated her allegations
verbatim to the grand jury and in the S2 Superseding Indictment. This was not only misleading,
it was also an end-run around Rule 404(b). Simply including the conduct alleged by Accuser-3 in
the indictment does not mean that it is evidence of the charged conspiracies. The conduct
alleged by Accuser-3 is not within the scope of the charged conspiracies and the Court should
not admit this evidence as proof of those charges. Nor should the Court admit this evidence as
“other act” evidence under Rule 404(b). This evidence would only be offered to show criminal
propensity, despite the alleged conduct being entirely legal, and would mislead the jury and
unfairly prejudice Ms. Maxwell. Accordingly, the Court should exclude evidence related to
Accuser-3.
