LBAAMAX5ps Rocchio - Cross
1 Honor, part of my point.
2 THE COURT: If the point is that she doesn't know any
3 of the facts of the specific case and the government concedes
4 that's true, we can move on.
S MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.
6 I guess the other point, your Honor, which I can
7 develop, is, these studies that are included and impact the
8 statistics are really not relevant here because they deal with
9 males or a combination of males and females, and there are only
10 a few of them that deal with females specifically.
11 THE COURT: OK.
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: So when we're conflating these things,
13 it conflates the numbers.
14 May I proceed, your Honor?
15 THE COURT: You may.
16 MR. PAGLIUCA: Thank you.
17 Q. So that the first study, which is in 2016, in the last
18 column, is all males. Do you see that?
19 A. Could you -- the page is upside down on my screen. Can we
20 rotate it so that I can look at what you're seeing, please.
al MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't know if Ms. Drescher can do
22 that or not.
23 THE WITNESS: Or I can look at a paper copy. But I --
24 there's no way I can read that.
25 THE COURT: I can't read it either.
