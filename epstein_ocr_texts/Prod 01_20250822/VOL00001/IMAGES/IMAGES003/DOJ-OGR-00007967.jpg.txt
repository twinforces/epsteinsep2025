Act production, but this is a separate issue, She relied on
this im preparattion for hér testimony ‘today, and I believe that

under Rule 16 I am allowed to examine whatever she relied on in

This would, be part of the bases for her opinion, ‘your

have a Subject heading "grooming," for example, that. she threw
away which are mot in the file are not a bases for her opinion,
S6 I don't knéw that the whole file is Subject to that theory.

The contract. between her and the government, is not a
basis. for opinion, but you've asked fé6r that since she's
included that in the file.
