He also lists these “pathways,” in terms at times “drawn nearly verbatim” from a 2012 article ina
forensic psychology journal, along with conjectures of ways in which these mental conditions or
circumstances could hypothetically lead to false claims of sexual assault, including the following
examples:

e “Lying”: “Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as the favorable
consequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences could be . . . the severe
negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator experiences . .. secondary gain from
victim status ... excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual
activity, pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases) [or] financial gain.” (Ex. A at 7).

e “Implied Consent”: “A false allegation can arise when it was reasonable to believe
consent was given but the alleged victim falsely believes that it was not.” (/d. at 7-8).

e “False Memory”: Dr. Dietz cites principally to the work of Dr. Loftus in describing the
existence of false memories. (/d. at 8).

e “Intoxication”: “A person who does not accurately recall events that occurred while he
or she was under the influence or while experiencing the side effects of withdrawal
.. . may confabulate or fill in the memory lapses with events that seem probable or
which for some reason they come to believe ‘must have’ taken place.” (/d.).

e “Antisocial Personality Disorder”: “If an individual with antisocial personality disorder
is likely to lie to achieve power and pleasure, a false allegation of sexual assault might
be the means by which he or she attempts to achieve power over the falsely accused.”
(Id.).

e “Borderline Personality Disorder”: “[A]n individual with BPD may use a sexual assault
allegation as a way of impacting a third party for some desired outcome.” (/d. at 8-9).

e “Histrionic Personality Disorder”: “In times when attention is not being received to the
desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault may help to pull individuals with
histrionic personality disorder out of their depressed state.” (/d. at 9).

e “Delirium”: “Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual disturbances that may be
present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or even hallucinations.” (/d.).

e “Psychotic Disorders”: “[D]elusions may lead a person to claim adamantly that sexual
relations or events occurred that may be impossible or highly improbable.” (/d. at 9).
