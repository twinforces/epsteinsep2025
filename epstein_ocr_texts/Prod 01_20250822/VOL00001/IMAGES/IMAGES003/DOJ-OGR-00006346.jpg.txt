Circuit in United States: v. Johnson, 860 F.3d 1133,1141 (8th Cir. 2017), and the District of
Massachusetts in Doe ex rel. Pike ¥. Pike; 405 F. Supp. 3d,243, 249. (D. Mass. 2019).

Here, Dr. Rocchio has extensive experience treating, minors‘who have been. sexually
abused, and those decades of relevant experienec, combined with her’formal,training, ‘are an,
trust with their victims, whether that’be grooming or other forms ‘of manipulation and ‘coercion.
The Government has also provided several articles on the subject: of grooming that convince the
‘Court that it isa well-accepted theory in Dr. Rocchio’s field. Though the Second Circuit has not.
ruled. on, the admissibility: ofa. grooming expert, it has previously recognized the academic
literature 6n grooming to ‘facilitate sexual abuse of minors. See Wnited States. Brand, 467 F.3d.
179, 203 (2d.Cir. 2006). The Defense cites to several contrary. articles that suggest experts.
disagree: on the:kinds. of behaviors that define grooming. ‘But if experts disagree on the proper
interpretation of evidence, “itis not'the Court’s role to. tesolve the dispute through exclusion of
‘one of the expert’s opinions.” Jn-re Digital Music Antitrust Litig., 321 F.R.D. 64, 80 (S.D:N.Y.
2017).

Moreover, Dr. Rocchio' addressed these ‘contrary articles during the Daubert hearing,,
identifying points of agreement.and disagreement. Based.on her testimony, the parties’
submission and,accompanying exhibits, the: Court.concludes that the core concept of grooming is
well-accepted.:in the relevant literature, even. if experts. continue to debate the details.

The Defense’s primary argument jis that Dr: Rocchio’s.method is:unreliable because it:is
based on her personal expericnce; with the clicnts shé has tréated, that Dr. Rocchio did not'verify
whether those:clients ‘were truthful, and.that‘Dr. Rocchio. has not and cannot identify an,crror

rate. The Court finds that these objections are misplaced in the ficld of clinical psychology,
