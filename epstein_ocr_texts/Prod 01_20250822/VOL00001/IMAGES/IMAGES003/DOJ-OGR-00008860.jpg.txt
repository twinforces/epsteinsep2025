Finally, it is important to emphasize that Ms. Maxwell does not seek to seal the Motion
indefinitely. She seeks only a temporary sealing to protect the integrity of any fact-finding process
ordered by the Court. In this case, the pretrial motions remained under seal for several weeks
before they were filed on the docket in redacted form. That limited delay did not have a
meaningful impact on the public’s right of access or the press’ ability to report on this case. So
too here. Indeed, it could potentially take less time for the Court to rule on the Motion or for a
hearing to be completed.

Conclusion

For the foregoing reasons, the Court should order that the Motion remain temporarily
sealed until the Court rules on Ms. Maxwell’s Motion or until the conclusion of any hearing
ordered by the Court. The Court should further order the government to file its response under
seal so that the defense can assert its position regarding sealing.

Sincerely,

3 Moreover, even if the defense attempted to make redactions, most of the Motion would remain under seal. The
limited portion that could potentially be unsealed would be entirely divorced from context and would not provide the
public with any useful information, nor would it allow the press to perform its role of monitoring the federal courts.
