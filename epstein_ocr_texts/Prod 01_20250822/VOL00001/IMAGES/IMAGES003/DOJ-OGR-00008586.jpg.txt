2 least in or about 2001, up to and including in or about 2004, to commit sex trafficking of
3 individuals under the age of 18a-miner. The object of the conspiracy charged in Count Five of
4 the Indictment is to commit sex trafficking of aindividuals under the age of 18miner. I have
5 already reviewed the elements of that offense in connection with Count Six. If you find
