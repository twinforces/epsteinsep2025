Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 452 Filed 11/12/21 Page6of84
traumatic and psychological consequences, especially when it
occurs in the context of complex trauma. The presence of other
individuals can facilitate the sexual abuse of minors. Dr. Rocchio is
also expected to testify that nondisclosure, incremental disclosure,
and secrecy are common among victims of sexual abuse for a variety
of reasons, and that memory and disclosure of traumatic or abusive
events is impacted by a number of factors, including the
circumstances surrounding the trauma.
(Expert Notice, Def. Mot. 3 Ex. 1 at 2). As the notice also explained, Dr. Rocchio has not evaluated
any of the victims in this case, and the Government does not currently intend to offer Dr. Rocchio’s
testimony regarding any specific victim. (See id.).

There is nothing controversial about this testimony. It is well supported by established
scientific principles, and it is the kind of testimony frequently admitted in cases involving sexual
abuse. This Court should do the same.

A. Applicable Law

District courts have a “gatekeeper function” in analyzing the admissibility of expert
testimony. Phelps v. CBS Corp., No. 17 Civ. 8361 (AJN), 2020 WL 7028954, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.
Nov. 30, 2020) (quoting Restivo v. Hessemann, 846 F.3d 547, 575 (2d Cir. 2017)). Although
the proponent of the evidence carries a burden of proof to establish its admissibility by a
preponderance of the evidence, see, e.g., United States v. Jones, 965 F.3d 149, 161 (2d Cir.
2020), courts apply a “presumption of admissibility of evidence.” Felix v. City of New York,
No. 16 Civ. 5845 (AJN), 2020 WL 6048153, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 13, 2020) (quoting Borawick
v. Shay, 68 F.3d 597, 610 (2d Cir. 1995)). Accordingly, the relevant rule of evidence, Rule 702,
reflects “the ‘liberal thrust’ of the Federal Rules and their ‘general approach of relaxing the
traditional barriers to ‘opinion’ testimony.’” Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S.
