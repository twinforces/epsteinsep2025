the evidence in support of such a defense would be legally insufficient.” (citation and internal
quotation marks omitted)); United States v. Bakhtiari, 913 F.2d 1053, 1057 (2d Cir. 1990) (“This
procedure enabled [the Court], upon finding that the defense failed as a matter of law, to
preclude the evidence and thereby avoid unnecessary jury confusion.”). If there is a question of
whether a defense is sufficient as a matter of law, the Court may conduct a hearing. See
Bakhtiari, 913 F.2d at 1057. But if the Court finds a defense insufficient as a matter of law, the
Court is under no duty to allow the defendant to present the evidence, or advance the defense, to
the jury. See Miles, 748 F.3d at 489; United States v. Paul, 110 F.3d 869, 871 (2d Cir. 1997)
(citing United States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 416-17 (1980)).

Consent is not a valid defense to any of the counts in the Indictment. It is not a valid

United States v. Elbert, 561 F.3d 771, 777 (8th Cir. 2009) (“Because the victims were minors
and could not legally consent, the government did not need to prove the elements of fraud, force,
or coercion, which are required for adult victims.”); United States v. Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d 250,
253 (S.D.N.Y. 2019). It is not a defense to the Mann Act counts. See United State v. Holland,
381 F.3d 80, 84 (2d Cir. 2004) (explaining that 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) “makes no distinction
between victims and coconspirators for purposes of imposing liability on the person who
transports another; the defendant need only have transported an ‘individual’ . . . to be guilty
under the Act.”); United States v. Williams, 529 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2008) (“[C]onsent is not a
defense to a prosecution under section 2423(a).”); United States v. Jones, 808 F.2d 561, 565 (7th
