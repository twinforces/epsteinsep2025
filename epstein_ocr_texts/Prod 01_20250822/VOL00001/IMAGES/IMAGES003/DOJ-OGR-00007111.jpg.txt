1 MS. MOE: Your Honor, those records would be

2 authenticated through number of different witnesses; in part,
3 law enforcement officer describing those exact records being

4 seized from the residence in 2005 in their general description
a and format, witnesses describing the practice for maintaining
6 those records contemporaneously and doing so in the course of
7 their employment.

8 THE COURT: Contemporaneous to what?

9 MS. MOE: At the time the message was made.

10 THE COURT: During the period of the conspiracy?

11 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. And that testimony would
12 include testimony about the format of these documents, where
13 they were kept, and the practice for keeping messages along

14 these lines. We think that is consistent with the Second

15 Circuit's rulings on authentication being based on the

16 particulars of a document and their formatting and their

17 contents. So I think this would come in through a number of
18 witnesses and, collectively, at the conclusion of that

19 testimony, we would offer those exhibits based on that
20 foundation.
al THE COURT: And I don't think I can rule on that in
22 advance until we hear the authentication evidence being
23 offered. What you have proffered I think -- I will hear from
24 the defense -- but it seems like those pieces could add up to
25 authentication.
