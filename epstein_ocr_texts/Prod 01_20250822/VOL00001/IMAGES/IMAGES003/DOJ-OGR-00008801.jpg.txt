have been publicly reported:in several media outlets.’ Among other things, the Juror told
reporters that he disclosed tothe other members. ofthe jury during deliberations that he ‘was, a
victim. of sexual, abuse and further deseribed.his memory of those events. According to the Juror,
his disclosure influenced. the deliberations and convinced. other‘ members. of the jury ‘to: convict Ms.
