20-CR-330 (AJN)
Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Court is in receipt of the Government’s supplemental letter regarding its opposition
to the defense motion to exclude evidence of Minor Victim-3. See Dkt. No. 387. The letter is
submitted temporarily under seal to allow defense counsel the opportunity to propose any
additional redactions beyond what the Government proposes.

At the November 1, 2021 conference, the Court asked the Government to provide its
position as to whether Alleged “Victim-3” could be considered a “victim” of the crimes charged
in the indictment for any legal purpose, including for purposes of restitution under 18 U.S.C. §
3663(a)(2). See Transcript at 71-72. The Government’s supplemental letter does not address
this issue. While acknowledging that the Court’s request may have been unclear, the
Government is now ORDERED to file a supplemental letter responsive to the Court’s question
on or before 12:00 p.m. on November 7, 2021. For the sake of clarity, the Government is
directed to state its position as to whether this anticipated witness could be deemed a victim of
any of the crimes charged in the indictment for any legal purpose, including for purposes of
restitution under 18 U.S.C. § 3663(a)(2).

SO ORDERED.
