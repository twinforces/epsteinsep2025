Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document563_ Filed 12/18/21 Page 126 of 167
1 In determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well as
2 circumstantial evidence. The old adage, “Actions speak louder than words,” applies here. Often,
3 the only evidence that is available with respect to the existence of a conspiracy is that of
4 disconnected acts and conduct on the part of the alleged individual co-conspirators. When taken
5 altogether and considered as whole, however, these acts and conduct may warrant the inference
6 that a conspiracy existed as conclusively as would direct proof, such as evidence of an express
7 agreement.
8 In short, as far as the first element of the conspiracy is concerned, the Government must
9 prove beyond a reasonable doubt that at least two alleged conspirators came to a mutual
10 understanding, either spoken or unspoken, to violate the law in the manner charged in Counts
11 One, Three, and Five of the Indictment.
