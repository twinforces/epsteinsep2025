A. Response to Dr. Rocchio’s Proposed Testimony.

The government: challenges what it characterizes. as four opinions Dr. Dictz might offer, in,
response'to testimony from Dr. Rocchio." As:explaiticd below, though, Dr. Dictz’s testimony is
responsive to: Dr. Rocchio’s testimony in.more:than the four narrow ways identified by the
government. In addition, ‘much of his:proposed testimony ‘has independent relevance. In any’
event, none of the government’s challenges :is persuasive.

First, the government challenges Dr. Dictz’s proposed testimony (1) that Dr. Rocchio’s
opinion on grooming “carrics the risk: of imputing' motive and intent to the Defendant,” that“Dr.
Rocchio’s proposed testimony is silent as to whcther she is expected to impute:a:theory: of
‘srooming-by-proxy” to the defendant,” and, that. “Ms. Maxwell is not accused of soliciting or
enticing sexualized massages for herself,” but instead, that.she allegedly “récruited.and groomed
minors to provide scxualized massages for Mr. Epstein.” Mot. at 10. The government says these
three opinions are inadmissible “legal” conclusions suitable only for'a Daubert hearing and not
for the jury trial.

“grooming” risks “imputing motive’ and ‘intent” to the defendant. because that is preciscly why
there is no: settled, clinical definition of grooming, which the government has:conceded. is a
proper subject of Dr. Dictz’s expert opinions. Supra. Note 1; Ex. 1, p 3-4. Surely Dr. Dietz can
inform the jury why the science docs not support Dr. Rocchio’s definition of grooming.

Dr. Dictz will not: himself'(and.Dr. Rocchio cannot herself) ascribe motive or intent to

Ms. Maxwell, nor will he testify that-the jury lacks. sufficient cvidence‘to ascribe motive and,

' The government agrees, Dr. Dictzcan inform the jury. that Dr. Rocchio is wrong’to.
suggest that, grooming has a settled:definition. Mot. at.9.
