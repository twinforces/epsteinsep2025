Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully requests permission to file the attached reply brief in support
of the Government’s motion to preclude the testimony of Dr. Ryan Hall. Among other issues, the
defendant’s opposition brief raises new arguments about hearsay exceptions that the defendant
argues apply to information contained in Dr. Hall’s report and further elaborates on the defendant’s
theory of the report’s relevance.

Respectfully submitted,
DAMIAN WILLIAMS
United States Attorney
