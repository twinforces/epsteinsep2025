1 MS. POMERANTZ: Your Honor, I believe there's a binder
2 for Dr. Rocchio.

3 THE COURT: OK. Is it in there?

4 MS. POMERANTZ: It should be under tab 6, your Honor.
S THE COURT: Tab 6.

6 MR. ROHRBACH: And would your Honor like a copy of it?
7 THE COURT: I can't hear if you you're not using the

8 mike.

9 MS. POMERANTZ: Would your Honor like a binder as

10 well?

11 THE COURT: Sure.

12 All right. So we're looking at Government 6.

13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Correct, your Honor, page 3 of 24.

14 Q. I'm going to skip the next one, Dr. Rocchio, which deals

15 with a discrete set of individuals. If we go to the third one
16 down, if you go to the right-hand column, which is the summary.
17 A. Yes.

18 Q. This includes -- this is a 50 percent disclosure rate, as
19 identified in this summary. Correct?
20 A. 50 percent did not disclose until after the age of 19, I
al believe.
22 Q. "Half of the participants had not disclosed their CSA
23 experiences before the age of 19." Right?
24 A. Yes.
25 Q. That means half did.
