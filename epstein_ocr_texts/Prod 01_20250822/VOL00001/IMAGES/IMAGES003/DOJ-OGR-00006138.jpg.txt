Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 72 of 93
Venue
[Tf requested by defense]

With respect to each of the counts in the indictment, you must also consider the issue of
venue, namely, whether any act in furtherance of the unlawful activity charged in that count
occurred within the Southern District of New York. The Southern District of New York
encompasses the following counties: New York County (i.Â¢., Manhattan), Bronx, Westchester,
Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Sullivan Counties. Anything that occurs in any of
those places occurs in the Southem District of New York.

Venue must be examined separately for each count in the Indictment. Venue on one
count does not establish venue on another count, though if applicable, you may rely on the same
evidence to establish venue on multiple counts.
