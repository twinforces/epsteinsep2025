1 Q. What is that term?

2 A. Attachment basically refers to the relationship between one
3 person, one individual and another. The original research was
4 conducted looking at the attachment as a connection between an
5 infant and a caregiver, her mother. But since has expanded

6 into talking about the relational dynamics between either

7 children and caregivers, children and family members or, for

8 example, two intimate partners as adults.

9 Q. Can you please explain the relationship, if any, between
10 attachment and grooming?

11 A. So when I talked about some of the strategies that are

12 utilized, tactics, modus operandi in order to build that

13 relationship within the context of childhood sexual abuse, the
14 function and end result of that is to create a relationship or
15 attachment and connection between the perpetrator and the

16 child, whereby the child trusts and becomes dependent upon the
17 perpetrator.

18 Q. Based on your experience, research and training are you

19 familiar with the term coercive control?
20 A. I am.
21 Q. What is coercive control?
22 A. Coercive control refers to a strategic pattern of behavior
23 that's designed to attain and maintain control ina
24 relationship. So coercion means getting somebody to either do
25 or not do something that they wouldn't ordinarily do otherwise.
