Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in response to the Court’s Order dated
January 26, 2022, which provided that the Government “may file on ECF” a response to the
defendant’s letter filed on February 1, 2022 in which the defendant argued that her motion for a
new trial (the “Defense Motion”) and its exhibits should be sealed. (Dkt. No. 585). For the reasons
discussed herein, the Government respectfully submits that the defendant has not justified her
sealing request and, accordingly, the Defense Motion and its exhibits should be publicly docketed.

court—and thus whether sealing is permissible—courts undertake a three-part inquiry. Lugosch

the record or document in question is a “judicial document,” that is, whether the document is
‘relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the judicial process,’” such that
a presumption of access attaches. /d. at 119 (quoting United States v. Amodeo, 44 F.3d 141, 145
(2d Cir. 1995)). Second, if a document is indeed a “judicial document,” the court must determine
the weight to be accorded the presumption of access. Lugosch, 435 F.3d at 119. Finally, after
