Government requests that the Court direct prospective jurors to read the sheet and to raise a hand
if they are familiar with the witnesses or locations. Examination of jurors on this subject would
then be conducted at sidebar, with the transcript redacted to remove witness identifying
information.
Ii. Limiting Instruction

The Government requests that the Court give the jury an instruction that is similar to the
instruction Judge Garaufis gave the jury in United States v. Raniere, 18 Cr. 204 (E.D.N.Y.). In
that case, Judge Garaufis instructed the jury:

You may have noticed during yesterday's testimony that the witness used first

names of certain individuals. That is because the names of certain alleged victims

are being withheld from the public and the press to protect the privacy of those

individuals. I have therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals by

their first names only; however, those full names are known to the Government, the

defendant, and to the Court.
An excerpt of the relevant transcript is enclosed as Exhibit A. Here, the Government proposes that
the Court instruct the jury:

At this trial, certain witnesses will be testifying under their first name only. Other

witnesses will be testifying under pseudonyms â€” that is, under different names.

That is because the names of certain alleged victims and related witnesses are being

withheld from the public and the press to protect the privacy of those individuals. I

have therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals by their first names

witnesses are known to the Government, the defendant, and to the Court.

The Government respectfully submits that the proposed instruction addresses any potential
