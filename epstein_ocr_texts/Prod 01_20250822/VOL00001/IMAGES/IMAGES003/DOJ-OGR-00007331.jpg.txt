9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, we're on disclosure.
10 THE COURT: I think you can wrap up disclosure.
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: All right, your Honor. I get it.
12 BY MR. PAGLIUCA:
13 QO. So there are other reasons, outside of the statistics, that
14 individuals who, at some point later in life, claim to be
15 sexually assaulted make that claim. Correct?
16 A. Outside of what statistics?
17 Q. Well, you've been talking about delayed disclosure as a
18 predictor of sexual assault. Is that correct?
19 A. No, that is incorrect.
20 Q. What is the significance, as far as you are concerned, with
21 delays in disclosures as part of your opinions?
22 THE COURT: If you'd like, Mr. Pagliuca, you don't
23 have to, but you can take off your mask in the podium box if
24 you like.
25 MR. PAGLIUCA: I appreciate it.
