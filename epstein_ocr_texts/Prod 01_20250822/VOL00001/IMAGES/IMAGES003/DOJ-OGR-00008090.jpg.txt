Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document508 _ Filed 11/24/21 Page5of25

Ghislaine Maxwell submits this Response to the Government’s Motion to Preclude the
Expert Testimony of Dr. Ryan Hall, Bennett Gershman, Robert Kelso, John Lopez, Gerald
LaPorte, and Jennifer Naso.

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

The government claims to bring its motion under Federal Rule of Evidence 702. In
reality, though, the government doesn’t challenge the expertise of any of Ms. Maxwell’s expert
witnesses or the reliability of their opinions. Instead, training its sights almost exclusively on Dr.
Hall, the government says that the opinions of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are either
irrelevant or unfairly prejudicial. The government also claims to lack adequate notice of some of
the experts’ proposed opinions.

This Court can deny the motion for the simple reason that the government is proceeding
under the wrong rule at the wrong time. Because Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses are qualified
and because their opinions are reliable, their testimony is admissible under Rule 702. As for
relevance and prejudice, the government’s arguments are both unfounded and premature. Finally,
if the government is entitled to additional notice, Ms. Maxwell will provide it.

For the reasons given below, the exclusion of Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses would
violate both her constitutional right to confrontation and her constitutional to present a defense.
This Court, therefore, should deny the government’s motion.

ARGUMENT
I. Dr. Hall’s Testimony Is Admissible.

Although the government offers some type of challenge, however conclusory, to all of
Ms. Maxwell’s expert witnesses, the true target of the government’s motion is Dr. Ryan Hall. Dr.
Hall is an eminently qualified M.D. who conducted an independent medical examination of
