Dear Judge Nathan: 12/19/21
The parties respectfully submit this letter regarding the logistics for public access for
closing arguments. The parties propose that they will release a public version of their slides (to
the extent they do not contain sealed materials) following the conclusion of the trial day on the
same basis that they have been releasing public exhibits during trial. This proposal appropriately
balances the public interest in access to closing arguments with the Court and the parties’ interests
in avoiding delay and effective advocacy on behalf of their clients, as well as the interests of
victims and third parties protected by the Court’s sealing orders.!
' Closing argument demonstratives are not part of the official trial record. The approach jointly
proposed by the parties is consistent with trials conducted without electronics, where the public
would not be in a position to see white boards or easel displays positioned facing the jury box.
