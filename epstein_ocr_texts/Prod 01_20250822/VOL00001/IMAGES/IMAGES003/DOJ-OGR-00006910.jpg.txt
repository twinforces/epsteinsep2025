Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 453 Filed 11/12/21 Page 30 of 52

Thus currently it appears that grooming is not a construct that ought to be used in

forensic settings as it does not meet some of the criteria in the Daubert standard. .

.. Right now it does not appear to be the case that there are “reliable principles

and methods” to define and detect grooming.

Id. at 19 (emphasis added).

At a minimum, therefore, this Court should hold a Daubert hearing.

IV. THE COURT SHOULD EXCLUDE EVIDENCE RELATED iii

The government’s arguments in favor of admitting evidence related xq
2S ‘lirect evidence of the charged conspiracies all but concede that the
evidence is more appropriately considered under Rule 404(b). In an effort to bolster their
position, the government makes the sweeping assertion that as long as yy was
under the age of 18, her evidence is admissible as direct evidence of the conspiracy. That is a
fundamentally incorrect statement of the law and should be rejected. The government’s
arguments for admitting evidence under Rule 404(b) and for denying the
defense’s requested limiting instruction are similarly baseless. The Court should therefore
exclude evidence related to qq or, if it is admitted, give the jury the requested
limiting instruction.’

The government advances four principal arguments for why evidence related to yy
ME should be admitted as direct evidence of the charged conspiracies: (1) her testimony
allegedly shows a “pattern” of how Epstein and Ms. Maxwell sexually abused young women and
establishes Ms. Maxwell’s “intent” to participate in the charged conspiracies (Resp. at 45-46),
(2) her allegations are included in the S2 Indictment and are therefore not covered by Rule

’ As it pertains to | and the other accusers, the defense will be submitting
proposed jury instructions and special verdict findings.
