openly hostile toward her and have mentioned having read the press and seen various television
shows which amplify their hostility. There are cameras on her constantly, most are stationary,
but one camera follows her as she moves throughout the facility, and is constantly surveilling
her, even during confidential attorney-client conferences. Ms. Maxwell has reported to counsel
and the BOP that she has been threatened by corrections officers that she will be subject to
discipline if she is ever out of, or anything interferes with, the camera’s view.

Ms. Maxwell is subject to numerous pat searches per day, despite being completely
isolated, during which she alleges to have been touched in a sexually inappropriate manner by
corrections officers on multiple occasions. She declines recreation time to avoid being searched,
which has negatively impacted her physical health. She was denied an extra blanket in the
winter, and, on more than one occasion, an officer took one of her blankets from her after her
request for an extra blanket was granted. She was not provided a proper food regimen for the
first few months she was incarcerated, wherein she was provided with small, inadequate portions
or rotten food. She has lost at least 15 pounds since her incarceration and has experienced hair
loss. Currently, she suffers from headaches and back pain and general physical weakness.

Ms. Maxwell’s guards shine flashlights on the ceiling of her cell in 15-minute intervals
and have done so every night since she has been incarcerated. As reported by the government,
“MDC staff conduct flashlight checks every fifteen minutes because the defendant, while not on
suicide watch, is on an enhanced security schedule because MDC has identified a number of
factors that raise heightened safety and security concerns with respect to this defendant.” (Dkt.
270.) This response provides further support that Ms. Maxwell is overmanaged because of the
intense criticism sustained by the Department of Justice over the Bureau of Prison’s blunders that
resulted in the death of Jeffrey Epstein, an event that preceded the arrest and prosecution of Ms.
