1 the parties exercise the peremptories by list, and we are done.
2 So, as I say, I am still working through the specific
3 logistics of that but that's my thinking as to how we will do

4 it.

5 Any reactions, Ms. Moe?

6 MS. MOE: No, your Honor. Thank you.

7 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim?

8 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes. My only reaction is are we going
9 to be able to see the jurors as they respond to the Court's

10 questioning?

11 THE COURT: So, I think what we can do is have staff
12 in each of the courtrooms, I will ask my question, anyone who
13 raises their hand will be brought in individually. If you

14 would like to have someone in each of those rooms for the

15 hand-raising, that's fine with me.

16 MS. STERNHEIM: OK.

17 THE COURT: We would be happy to do that.

18 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.

19 THE COURT: But because there are other trials being
20 selected on the 29th we can't use the jury assembly room and,
al in any event, it would slow us down. So I think this is the
22 way to go logistically but that's what it will entail for the
23 exercised peremptories.
24 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.
25 THE COURT: One of the obstacles to the jury selection
