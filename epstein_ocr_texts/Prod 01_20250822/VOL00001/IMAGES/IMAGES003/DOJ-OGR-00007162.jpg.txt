the parties exercise the 'péremptories, by list, and we are done.

So, as I say, I am still working threugh the specific
logisties of that but ‘that's my thinking as to how we will do
it.

MS, MOE: No, your Honor. Thank. you.

THE COURT: (Ms. Sternhe'im?

MS, STERNHEIM: Yes. My only reaction 1§ are we going

questioning?

THE COURT: So, I think what. we Gan do is have staff
in, each of the courtrooms, I will ask my question, anyone who
raises their Kahd will be brought. ih individually. If you

would Like to jnave someone ,in each. of ‘those rooms. for the

hand=raising, that's fine with nme.
MS. STERNHEIM:  OK,.
THE COURT: We would be Happy to do that.

MS. STERNHEIM: Thank, you,

THE GOURT: But because there are other trials béing
selected on the 29th we can't use ‘the jury assembly room and,
in any event, it would sl6éw us down. So I think this is the
way to go logistically but that's what dt will entail for the

exercised peremptories.

MS. STERNHEIM: Thank. ‘you.

THE COURT: One of the obstacles to the jury selection
