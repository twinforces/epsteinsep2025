Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 429 Filed 11/09/21 Page 2 of 2
Ms. Maxwell is being treated differently than other defendants within and outside jail.
Her conditions of confinement are extraordinary and “redundant” and have impeded her ability
to prepare for trial. Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby were permitted to walk into the courthouse
each day of their respective trials. Not until their verdicts were rendered, adjudging them guilty,
were they detained. They were accorded dignity to defend themselves. Ms. Maxwell has not.
The Court should release Ms. Maxwell from pretrial detention. It is the right and just
thing to do, most especially for a mature woman with no criminal history, no history of violence,
who poses no threat to the community, is not a flight risk, and is eager for her day in court.
Ghislaine Maxwell looks forward to her trial and to walking out of the courthouse uncuffed and
unshackled following her acquittal.
Very truly yours,
