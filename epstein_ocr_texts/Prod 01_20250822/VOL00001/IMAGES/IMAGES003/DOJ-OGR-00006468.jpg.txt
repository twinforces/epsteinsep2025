612-13; Lindsey, 769 F.2d at 1042. Accordingly, this evidence does not impermissibly question
the government’s motives and should not be precluded.

V. A PRE-TRIAL BAN ON CHALLENGES TO THE CREDIBILITY OF NON-

TESTIFYING WITNESSES IS UNSUPPORTED LEGALLY OR FACTUALLY

The government again refrains from telling the Court exactly what evidence it expects at
trial, yet asks the defense to preview its possible cross-examination or defense-case evidence, in
order both to circumvent the Rules of Criminal Procedure's guidelines and this Court's orders as
to when the defense must disclose certain evidence. What's more, the government gives only
summary suggestions of what the evidence "might" be and then asks the Court to rule
definitively that the defense is precluded from challenging that evidence via cross-examination
or otherwise. Because this Court cannot rule on the admissibility of impeachment evidence of a
non-testifying witness unless and until the government actually elicits testimony concerning such
a witness, this motion should be denied or deferred until the appropriate time at trial.

The government does a poor job of previewing exactly what statements it anticipates
offering from others related i

P| It says that "other witnesses are expected to testify about the activities” of
those two non-testifying witnesses, "including [unspecified] statements by them," which
statements according to the government "will not include any statements ... offered for the truth
of the matter asserted or under one of the other exceptions listed under Rule 806." Mot. at 37-38.
The government then gives two non-exclusive examples”? but fails to elucidate what exactly the
pertinent statements will be, to wit:
© The government does not give any examples pertaining to PR
therefore it is wholly unclear what statements the government intends to elicit about her or for what
purpose. See Mot. at 37-38.
