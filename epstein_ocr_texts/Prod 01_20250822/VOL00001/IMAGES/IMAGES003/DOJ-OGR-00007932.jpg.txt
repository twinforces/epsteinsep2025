1 Q. At a high level, what are your opinions on which

2 individuals are at higher risk of child sexual abuse based on?
3 A. My training and my education, certainly my clinical and

4 forensic experience, as well as my review of the clinical and
5 scientific literature.

6 Q. In your education and training, did you learn about the

7 concept of certain groups being at higher risk of childhood

8 sexual abuse?

9 A. Yes, because, again, in the phenomenon of child sexual

10 abuse in general, not -- we're looking at vulnerability

11 factors, i.e., who's more at risk. So to the extent that I was
12 learning about ways that you might want to target prevention,
13 for example, where you might want to make those interventions,
14 but then also, we know that an individual's prior

15 vulnerabilities interact with their subsequent experiences of
16 victimization and have a profound effect on the outcome, the
17 adverse outcomes of the abuse itself.

18 So it was covered in a number of different ways

19 through the course of my education and training.
20 Q. In your clinical practice, have you treat and evaluated
21 patients who belong to higher-risk groups?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Can you please explain.
24 A. In particular, we know that gender is a higher-risk group,
25 and we know that women and girls are at higher risk for child
