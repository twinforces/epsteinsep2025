Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 424 _ Filed 11/08/21 Page 33 of 41

More recently, federal courts have ‘been more receptive to allowing expert testimony
beyond general ‘principles of human recall on a case-by-case basis, depending on the: special
circumstances or particular. facts of. a case and only when.:such. opinions are based. on reliable
science ‘and. fit the: facts of the case. See, :¢.g:, Libby, 461 F.Supp: 2d at.9-10 (“There is. no clear:
cas¢ authority, or absolute rule, on when, an expert’ should ‘be. permitted. to ‘testify on. issues
regarding’ memory and perception. . ... [T]here is no per se rule for or against the admissibility of
such testimony [on memory’ and perception]. And a, court:presented with a proffer of expert.
testimony::must determine: its admissibility on. a case-by-case basis.” (citing cases));, Shiraishi,
2019 WL 1386365, at *3 (discussing the need. for the expert testimony: to’ “fit” the evidence or
facts of the particular casc); Shoh6la, 2019 WL ‘6053223, at *10-13 (“First, courts have recognized.
that cxpert testimony concerning the vagaries of. human recollection. that. is stated with :sufficient.
certainty, is grounded upon, reliable scienec, and fits the facts of the cease satisfics
the Daubert standard. and. should be admitted at'trial. In contrast, expert opinions regarding the
only a tenuous factual fit are often excluded, from evidence.” (citing United States v. Mathis, 264
F.3d 321, 336 (3d Cir..2001))).

Courts, however, must exercise “judicial oversight” in this area. See Shohola, 2019 WL
6053223, at *10-13. “Left unregulated, memory expert testimony. ca invade the fundamental

provinee:of the jury—determining:witness credibility,” and must be excluded:as unduly prejudicial.
