Dissociation: Dissociation is ‘the lack of the normal integration of thoughts, feelings,
and experiences into the stream of consciousness and memory. Dissociation involves a
disruption or splitting off of memory, personality, identity, consciousness, or general perceptions
of the self and surroundings; it can be recurring, gradual, or transient. It is likely associated with
memory distortions. Thus, it is possible that in the event of a sexual assault, dissociation may
cause a person to fill in the parts of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events
that for them feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily be
filled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. However, individuals who dissociate
at a high frequency may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details to an
incomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered in the context of the event.
Thus, these confabulations may lead to erroneous claims that have forensic relevance, including
who the perpetrator was, what happened, where, and how many times.

Intellectual Disability: Intellectual disability, is characterized by below average IQ and
adaptive functioning. Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acquisition of social,
occupational, academic, and general self-care skills. Intellectual disability has several etiologies
that often are related to biological or pathological processes affecting the central nervous system.
Many of the specific vulnerabilities that arise from intellectual disability overlap to some extent
with other disorders (e.g., autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and
individuals with other developmental disabilities may also have intellectual disability.
Intellectually disabled individuals, compared to individuals without ID, have vulnerabilities
related to memory and communication that the legal system may not be equipped to handle
adequately. Individuals with moderate-to-profound ID may have significant difficulty
communicating about the events that occurred because of language skills deficits or other
communication-interfering conditions (e.g., related neurological conditions). Research findings
indicate that communications skills are essential in filing a sexual assault charge; alleged victims
with mild ID were more likely than individuals with moderate or severe ID not only to file
sexual assault charges but to have their allegations confirmed. Difficulties with memory may
also complicate the investigation process for individuals with ID.

Changes in the core details of the allegation are often used by professionals as indices in
determining the credibility of a victim’s claims. Peace and colleagues (2015) conducted a
narrative analysis of 147 sets of allegations of sexual assault across short (3 month) and long (6
month) intervals since the alleged event took place. In reviewing the existing literature, Peace
and colleagues found that genuine traumatic experiences have a demonstrable resiliency to
drastic impairments in recall. However, some inconsistencies especially in less core matters are
to be expected due to some less important details fading or varying over time. In examining their
sample of 147 allegations, the researchers discovered that truthful allegations contained more
detail relative to false allegations at each of the assessment intervals. Specifically, the researchers
found that fabricated allegations of traumatic experiences contained more inconsistent details
both at 3 months and 6 months. The total amount of detail for each type of allegation (true or
false) does tend to decrease over time. Additionally, as these figures suggest, the researchers
found that the number of details present in genuine reports continued to decrease over time
whereas fabricated stories ‘levelled off” in detail.
