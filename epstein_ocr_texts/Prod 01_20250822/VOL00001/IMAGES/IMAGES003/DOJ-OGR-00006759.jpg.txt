Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 452 Filed 11/12/21 Page 51 of 84

Not so., The defendant’s argument entirely misunderstands the charges in the Indictment.
and the jury’s task at trial. The defendant is charged, with conspiring to transport and,cntice-minors
for. the purpose of.scxual abuse. The question. at trial. will be whether the defendant took steps to
provide Jeffrey Epstein with access to girls. under'the age of 1.8, knowing that: Epstein intended to
have sexual contact'with those girls. The defendant’s acts involving Minor Vietim-3. Werepart of
defendant’s role in the scheme. That.is all that is required for evidence relating to the defendant’s
exploitation of Minor Victim-3 to be direct evidence of the charged offenses. The defendant ‘is not.
charged-with an offenseunder United. Kingdom law, and.the age of consent in the United Kingdom
isirrelevant. The:defendant:.is also not.charged.with any substantive offenses with-respéct to. Minor
Victim-3, and, thus it makes no difference ‘whether the: defendant could. have, attempted to, or did.
‘successfully transport Minor Victim-3 in, violation. of those statutes.'°

Inany event, this evidence is all admissible under Rule 404(b).'3_ Testimony regarding the
defendant’s cfforts: to recruit and encourage Minor Victim-3 to engage in sex, acts with, Epstein in,

‘the context. of ‘massages establishes that-the: defendant knew. of Epstcin’s attraction, to minor girls

Minor Victim-3 alone. As the Government has. made clear, the jury may. not,convict.the defendant.
of the conspiracy offense solcly based on-Minor Victim=3 duc to the statute of limitations. (Gov't
Opp. at 1'57-58, 163, Dkt. No. 204). The jury should. be appropriately instructed at the conclusion
‘of the trial.

'? To the ‘extent this: cvidence: is ‘properly admissible under ‘Rule 404(b) rather than. as: dircct:
evidence, the Government’s detailed memorandum. in opposition to the defense pretrial motions,
which described. theories of 404(b) admissibility (Gov’t Opp. at; 165-69, Dkt. No. 204), and this
meémoraridum, filed fivé weeks before trial, is moré than. sufficient notice, forthe, défense.
