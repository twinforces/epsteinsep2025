Re:  United.States’v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr.330(AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant’s motion to
‘reconsider this Court’s prior bail, determinations. (Dkt. 408 (Def. Mot.”)). This Court has
repeatedly found that there are no conditions of release that can reasonably assure:the defendant’s
appearance (Dkt.'93,. 1.06, 1:69), and the Second Circuit has twice rejected the: defendant’s appeals
(see, United States ¥.. Maxwell, No. 21-58, Dkt. 86, 96 (2d Cit.)). The defendant’s latest motion.
largely repeats arguments'that‘have'been made and.rejected before. There is no basis for the Court
‘to reconsider its prior‘rulings.

favor ‘of detention,” given the statutory: presumption, of detention triggered by: charges involving
