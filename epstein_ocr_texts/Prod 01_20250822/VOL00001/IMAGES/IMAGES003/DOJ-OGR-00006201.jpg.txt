Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in opposition to the defendant’s motion to
reconsider this Court’s prior bail determinations. (Dkt. 408 (“Def. Mot.’)). This Court has
repeatedly found that there are no conditions of release that can reasonably assure the defendant’s
appearance (Dkt. 93, 106, 169), and the Second Circuit has twice rejected the defendant’s appeals
(see United States v. Maxwell, No. 21-58, Dkt. 86, 96 (2d Cir.)). The defendant’s latest motion
largely repeats arguments that have been made and rejected before. There is no basis for the Court
to reconsider its prior rulings.

After the defendant’s arrest, this Court received multiple written submissions and held a
lengthy oral argument on the question of bail. (See Dkt. 93 (“First Order’”’)). On July 14, 2020, in
a detailed oral ruling, the Court ordered the defendant detained on the basis of risk of flight. (/d.
at 79-91). First, the Court found that “the nature and circumstances of the offense here weigh in
favor of detention,” given the statutory presumption of detention triggered by charges involving
