consent in Florida was 18 years old, and the legal age of consent in
the U.S. Virgin Islands was 18 years old.
The alleged conduct that Accuser-3 has described in her testimony
was therefore not illegal. If you find that these incidents took
place, I instruct you that this sexual activity cannot be considered
“illegal” or “criminal” or “unlawful” for purposes of the crimes
charged in the indictment.
I further instruct you that you cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on the
basis of [Accuser-3’s] testimony alone. You must find that other
evidence satisfies each and every clement of the crimes charged.”

Also, before Accuser-3 begins her testimony, the defense requests that the Court give the
jury the following propensity instruction:

this testimony as any kind of reflection on Ms. Maxwell’s
character or propensity to commit any of the crimes charged in this
indictment. This testimony is being admitted for a limited purpose
and you may consider the testimony only to the extent it bears on
Ms. Maxwell’s knowledge or intent and for no other purpose.?

Furthermore, if the Court admits Accuser-3’s evidence under Rule 404(b), the defense
requests that the Court redact all allegations concerning Accuser-3 from the S2 Indictment to
ensure that the jury does not impermissibly consider her evidence as direct proof of the charged
conspiracies.

Finally, at the November 10" conference, the Court asked the defense to propose a limiting
instruction addressing sexual conduct involving any witness that occurred after the relevant age of
> The last part of the proposed instruction incorporates the government’s concession that Ms. Maxwell cannot be
convicted based solely on Accuser-3’s evidence due to the statute of limitations. See November 5" Ltr. at 12.
