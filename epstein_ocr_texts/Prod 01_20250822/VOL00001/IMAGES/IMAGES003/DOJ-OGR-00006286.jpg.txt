individuals, providing a novel and exciting environment that may be stim-
ulating to a person who is histrionic. They may enjoy the large amounts

of attention received for filing a sexual assault charge and for the “victim”

role that can be played out in other relationships. In times when attention

is not being received to the desired level, a false allegation of sexual assault

may help to pull individuals with histrionic personality disorder out of their
depressed state.

The misperception that relationships are more intimate than they actu-
ally are may lead a person with histrionic personality disorder to misconstrue
nonsexual interactions as events that are sexual in nature. For example, a
person who is histrionic may, after a co-worker complements her clothing
and accidentally bumps into her during the day, construe these actions as
intentional communications of sexual interest. This misperception can lead
her to feel that if the individual had touched her chest while bumping into
her, it was an intentional action of unwanted assault. Thus, a pathway to
false allegations of sexual assault may be through individuals with a diag-
nosis of histrionic personality disorder who for reasons of attention and
misinterpretation may knowingly or unknowingly make a false allegation of
sexual assault.

Delirium

According to the DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000,
p. 136), delirium is a “disturbance of consciousness that is accompanied
by a change in cognition that cannot be better accounted for by a preex-
isting or evolving dementia.” Relevant to this pathway are the perceptual
disturbances that may be present, including misinterpretations, illusions, or
even hallucinations.

Delirium may be caused by medical conditions, substance use, or with-
drawal or may have multiple etiologies (American Psychiatric Association,
2000). An individual suffering from delirium is out of contact with reality
and thus may make statements or allegations that are not veridical, includ-
ing false allegations of sexual assault. In these circumstances, an individual
with delirium may be under the care and protection of hospital staff, family
members, friends, or even law enforcement. In such situations, caregivers
may be in close physical proximity to the patient. The care provided could
be construed as sexual, even though the care may have been nonsexual.
Psychotic Disorders
The term psychotic generally refers to conditions that are marked by delu-
sions and hallucinations (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Psychotic
disorders include the following: schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder,
schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, shared
