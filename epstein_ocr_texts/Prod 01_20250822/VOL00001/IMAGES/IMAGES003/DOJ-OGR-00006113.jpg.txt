Counts One, Three, and Five: Conspiracy to Violate Federal Law — First Element

Starting with the first element, what is a conspiracy? A conspiracy is an agreement or an
understanding, between two or more persons, to accomplish by joint action a criminal or
unlawful purpose.

The essence of the crime of conspiracy is the unlawful agreement between two or more
people to violate the law. As I mentioned earlier, the ultimate success of the conspiracy, meaning
the actual commission of the crime that is the object of the conspiracy, is not an element of the
crime of conspiracy.

In order to show that a conspiracy existed, the evidence must show that two or more
people, in some way or manner, through any contrivance, explicitly or implicitly (that is, spoken
or unspoken), came to a mutual understanding to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful
plan. Express language or specific words are not required to indicate assent or attachment to a
conspiracy. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that two or more persons came to an
understanding, express or implied, to violate the law and to accomplish an unlawful plan, then
the Government will have sustained its burden of proof as to this element.

into a solemn pact, orally or in writing, stating that they had formed a conspiracy to violate the
law and spelling out all of the details. Common sense tells you that when people, in fact, agree to
enter into a criminal conspiracy, much is left to the unexpressed understanding. It is rare that a
conspiracy can be proven by direct evidence of an explicit agreement. Conspirators do not
usually reduce their agreements to writing or acknowledge them before a notary public, nor do
they publicly broadcast their plans.

In determining whether such an agreement existed, you may consider direct as well as
