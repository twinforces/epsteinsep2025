about numerous witness interviews they conducted, physical evidence they reviewed, documents
they obtained by subpoena,” and their activities before the grand jury. (Ex. A at 1-2).

But as set forth above, testimony about the “resolution” of a prior investigation is
irrelevant hearsay that would only serve to confuse the jury. Evidence about the “scope,”
“timeline,” or “various investigative steps taken by the agents” is similarly irrelevant and
misleading. The case agents are not summary witnesses that the defense can use to place before
the jury sweeping conclusions about the Florida Investigations or this one.” The bases identified
for their testimony are improper, and the Court should preclude them unless the defense
identifies a specific, valid purpose for their testimony.

IV. The Court Should Preclude Evidence or Argument About the Government’s
Alleged Motives for Prosecution

As the Court is aware, the defendant has claimed that she is being prosecuted as a
scapegoat because Jeffrey Epstein is dead. (See, e.g., Mem. of Law, Dkt. No. 142, at 1 (“[T]he
government has sought to substitute our client for Jeffrey Epstein... .”)). That claim is as false
as it is offensive. But in any event, the Government’s motives for prosecution are irrelevant to
the question of the defendant’s factual guilt that will be before the jury at trial, and any probative
’ Furthermore, the proffered bases for the case agents’ testimony will likely run afoul of
numerous evidentiary rules. The Government’s case agents cannot testify to the substance of
“numerous witness interviews they conducted” with uncalled witnesses, which is hearsay. The
agents’ prior testimony before the grand jury is admissible only under the limited principles that
govern prior consistent or inconsistent statements. And there is significant risk that case agent
testimony will introduce additional evidentiary issues. For instance, questioning the case agents
about information their investigations generated about the defendant would likely yield hearsay
responses and would open the door to agents offering other information that is inculpatory to the
defendant and that the Government would not otherwise offer at trial.
