ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Court is in receipt of the Government’s, Administrator Feldman’s, and two
anticipated witnesses’ motions to quash the Defendant’s Rule 17(c)(3) subpoena. Dkt. No. 486.
The motions to quash are DENIED.!

The Court hereby ORDERS the Administrator of the Epstein Victims’ Compensation
Program to produce to the Court via electronic thumb drive any materials responsive to the
subpoena as soon as possible, but no later than 12:00 p.m. on November 24, 2021.

Upon receipt, the Court will determine whether the parties may “inspect all or part” of the
materials. Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). In that event, the Court may determine that an appropriate
protective order is necessary for the parties’ review of some or all of the materials. Review
under a protective order may better facilitate the review process of the narrow, specific, and
targeted materials and may better ensure no trial delay, as compared to a review process solely
by the Court. Accordingly, the parties shall negotiate a protective order and submit the proposal
for approval by the Court no later than 12:00 p.m. on November 24, 2021.

SO ORDERED.

! Administrator Feldman’s request for oral argument is accordingly denied.
