interviews, i went even further, claiming that Ms. Maxwell saw her naked several
times and even fondled gM breasts on one occasion. See 3505-074 at 3.

Count Two of the proposed SDFL indictment is the same as Count Six of the S2
Indictment and it is based on the exact same evidence that the government proposes to introduce
to support Count Six; namely, the testimony of gg and related documentary evidence.
See GX-1-A through GX-1-P; GX-2-A through GX-2-W; GX-3-A through GX-3-KK; GX-4-A
through GX-4-K (message pad slips); GX-551 (gg phone records); GX-801-803
(FedEx records). The only difference is that J changed her story and accused Ms.
Maxwell thirteen years later when she was interviewed by the New York FBI. The fact that yg
HE testimony led to two different charging decisions on two different occasions is
relevant to her credibility and the government’s acceptance of her differing testimony. The
decision by the USAO-SDFL not to charge Ms. Maxwell in 2008 is therefore relevant and
admissible. See Borrero, 2013 WL 6020773, at *2.

This evidence could be elicited without hearsay. Special Agent gg had first-
hand knowledge that Ms. Maxwell was not charged in the proposed SDFL indictment because
she presented the indictment to the grand jury. See 3505-018 at 28:5-8. And it should not be
excluded under Rule 403. The viability of Counts Five and Six of the S2 Indictment rise and fall
on the credibility of gg. Morcover, the government’s decision to credit gy
BE 2020 testimony, despite its obvious inconsistencies with her 2007 testimony, goes to
the thoroughness and good faith of the New York investigation. The fact that Ms. Maxwell was
not charged in 2008 is highly probative of both issues and is not substantially outweighed by the
risk of juror confusion or speculation. It is therefore admissible.
