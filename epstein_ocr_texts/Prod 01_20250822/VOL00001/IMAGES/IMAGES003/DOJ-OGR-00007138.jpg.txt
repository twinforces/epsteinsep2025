8 defendant's knowledge, intent and alleged MO. For example, the
9 proffered testimony could tend to establish that the defendant
10 was aware of, for example, the sexualized nature of the alleged
11 massages. So if the argument is massages are not sexual or

12 there's no knowledge, this witness might have evidence and

13 testimony that could refute that point. The testimony could

14 support that the defendant asked the witness to recruit

15 underage girls to engage in similar sexualized massages which
16 tends to make the alleged MO more probable.

17 The testimony that this witness was allegedly groomed
18 by the defendant does not tend to establish the defendant's

19 knowledge, intent or MO to groom minor victims alone without
20 more, the kind of testimony I indicated, because this witness
21 was not a minor pursuant to the age of consent laws in any of
22 the relevant jurisdictions.

24 testimony, but there's a risk of a prejudice, the risk of
25 confusing issues and misleading the jury. A limiting
