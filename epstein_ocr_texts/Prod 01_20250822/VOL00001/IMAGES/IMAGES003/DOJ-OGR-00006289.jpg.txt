Pathways to False Allegations 115
fragmented memories with an individual’s self-concept and worldview, the
likelihood of altering memories of events, either consciously or uncon-
sciously, increases (Eisen & Lynn, 2001). Thus, it is possible that in the
event of a sexual assault, dissociation may cause a person to fill in the parts
of the experience that are not clearly remembered with events that for them
feasibly could have occurred. Of course, memory lapses will not necessarily
be filled in with a confabulated event, let alone a sexual one. However, high
dissociators may seek to make their stories more coherent by adding details
to an incomplete memory that would make sense to them when considered
in the context of the event. Thus, these confabulations may lead to erro-
neous claims that have forensic relevance, including who the perpetrator
was, what happened, where, and how many times.
Intellectual Disability
Intellectual disability UD; Schalock, 2007), also known as mental retarda-
tion (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), is characterized by below-
average IQ and adaptive functioning (Schalock, 2007; American Psychiatric
Association, 2000). Limitations in functioning include deficits in the acqui-
sition of social, occupational, academic, and general self-care skills. ID
has several etiologies that often are related to biological or pathological
processes affecting the central nervous system. Many of the specific vulner-
abilities that arise from ID overlap to some extent with other disorders (e.g.,
autism spectrum disorders, cerebral palsy, fetal alcohol syndrome) and thus,
in many cases, individuals with other developmental disabilities may also
have ID.

Rates of sexual assault are higher in intellectually disabled populations
than populations without ID (Mitra, Mouradian, & Diamond, 2011). It is
hypothesized that the true rate of sexual assault among individuals with
ID is higher than indicated in studies Goyce, 2003). There are many rea-
sons to believe that study findings are an underrepresentation of the actual
amount of sexual assaults that occur against intellectually disabled people.
Difficulties with communication and comprehension of language faced by
individuals with ID may interfere with the ability to report a sexual assault
(Ahlgrim-Delzell & Dudley, 2001). Fear of repercussions for reporting—as
caregivers are often the perpetrators—may also discourage reporting Joyce,
2003). Another reason why individuals with ID may not report a sexual
assault is because of a misunderstanding of the legal process. For instance,
Joyce (2003) briefly mentioned one alleged victim with ID who was reluc-
tant to continue with an allegation because she was afraid she would get
into trouble if the alleged perpetrator was found “not guilty.” Finally, it
can be assumed that individuals with ID may choose not to report a sexual
assault for the same reasons that individuals without ID choose not to report:
