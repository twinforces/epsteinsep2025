Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document565- Filed 12/19/21 Page 66 of 83

] Instruction No. 46: Law Enforcement and Government Employee Witnesses

2 You have heard testimony from law enforcement officials and employees of the

3 Government. The fact that a witness may be employed by the Federal Government as a law

4 enforcement official or employee does not mean that his or her testimony is necessarily

5 deserving of more or less consideration or greater or lesser weight than that of an ordinary

6 witness.

7 In this context, defense counsel is allowed to try to attack the credibility of such a

8 witness on the ground that his or her testimony may be colored by a personal or professional

9 interest in the outcome of the case.
10 It is your decision, after reviewing all the evidence, whether to accept the testimony of
11 the law enforcement or Government employee witness and to give to that testimony the
12 weight you find it deserves.
