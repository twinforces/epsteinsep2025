Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document563 _ Filed 12/18/21 Page 68 of 167

1 Instruction No. 46: Law Enforcement and Government Employee Witnesses

Zz You have heard testimony from law enforcement officials and employees of the

3 Government. The fact that a witness may be employed by the Federal Government as a law

4 enforcement official or employee does not mean that his or her testimony is necessarily

5 deserving of more or less consideration or greater or lesser weight than that of an ordinary

6 witness.

7 In this context, defense counsel is allowed to try to attack the credibility of such a

8 witness on the ground that his or her testimony may be colored by a personal or professional

9 interest in the outcome of the case.
10 It is your decision, after reviewing all the evidence, whether to accept the testimony of
11. â€˜the law enforcement or Government employee witness and to give to that testimony the
12 weight you find it deserves.
