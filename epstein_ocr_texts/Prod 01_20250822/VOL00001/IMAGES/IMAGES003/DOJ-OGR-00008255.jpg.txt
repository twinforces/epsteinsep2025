1 flag what I understand to be remaining, we have two issues that
2 are now fully briefed. That's the supplemental briefing on the
i) defendant's fourth motion in Limine, and we have the

4 government's motion to exclude the testimony, or some of the

iy testimony at least, of Drs. Loftus and Dietz pursuant to 702

6 and Daubert.

7 I'm working my way through that. I will either rule

8 by written order or address those at the November 23 final

9 pretrial conference.

10 We also have not yet fully briefed the defendant's

11 seventh motion in limine which relates to Government Exhibit

12 52, the defendant's first motion in limine related to

13 introduction of co-conspirator statements.

14 Let me say the Court appreciates some effort to find
15 places on which agreement was necessary and to come to it.

16 Thank you.

17 Those matters will be fully briefed tonight when I

18 receive the defense's response. And again, I will either put
19 out written orders on those or address them at the November 23
20 final pretrial conference.
al If the government does move to exclude any of the
22 other defense witnesses that have been noticed as potential
23 experts, that briefing is due tonight, response by Friday.
24 I'll either put out a written order, address it at the final
25 pretrial conference on the 23rd if I can, or some time after
