1 credibility based on failure to disclose at earlier time

2 periods?

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes, your Honor.

4 THE COURT: And then do you intend to impeach any

5 witnesses based on substance abuse?

6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Yes.

7 THE COURT: OK. All right. I think I have what I

8 need.

9 I'm going to give the reasons for my opinion, I think,
10 probably, at our proceeding on Monday, but what I intend to do
11 is deny the Daubert motion except with respect to the opinion
12 that expresses that the presence of another individual can
13 facilitate sexual abuse of minors. But otherwise the motion
14 will be denied. And as I said, I'll give my reasons for the
15 denial and the reason for the partial grant on Monday.

16 OK. I think with that we can transition to the 412
17 proceeding. So we'll break for ten minutes. We will, as I
18 said, have to seal the courtroom, as required by the rule,
19 which will mean all nine party participants have to leave and
20 the live feed will have to be turn off. And we'll confirm in
al the overflow rooms that those are off.
22 So we'll break for ten. Thank you.
