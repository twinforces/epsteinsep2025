ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Court is in receipt of the Government’s proposed redactions to the parties’
supplemental briefing and the Court’s Memorandum Opinion & Order regarding the
admissibility of the anticipated testimony of Witness-3. Dkt. No. 481; see also Dkt. No. 477.
The Court concludes that the proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test
articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.
2006) and narrowly tailored to protect the pre-trial privacy interests of an anticipated witness
who is subject to this Court’s pseudonym order. The redactions also properly protect materials
related to the Rule 412 motion, which must remain sealed pursuant Rule 412. Fed. R. Evid.
412(c)(2); see also Advisory Committee Note—1994 Amendment.

Accordingly, the parties ace ORDERED to file the redacted papers on the public docket
by November 22, 2021, including the Government’s supplemental letter regarding Witness-3
dated November 7, 2021 in response to Dkt. No. 417. The Court will file the redacted
Memorandum Opinion & Order.
