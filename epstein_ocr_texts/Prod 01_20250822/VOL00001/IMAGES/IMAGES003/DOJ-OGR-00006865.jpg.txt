In reviewing the literature on. this subject, London. and colleagues (2005)

Reasons: for Patterns of. Delay, Partial Disclosure and Non-disclosure

There ‘are: many ‘influences ‘on disclosure: that have been identified in, the
research literature: to help explain, why. it is that children delay disclosure, are
reluctant to. disclose, provide: details of their experiences . over time. or do not
disclose. at all. Age has been identified as a significant predictor of disclosure
in that younger children are less likely. 16 disclose than older children. Children
who are abused by a:family member are less likely to disclose and more likely
to delay disclosure than those abused ‘by: someone outside the family: (Smith
et-al., 2000; Goodman-Brown e? al., 2003: Kogan, 2004). Children. who do
disclose during forensic interviews compared to. children who: do not disclose
in such contexts (yet concerns remain that they’ have becn abused) ‘are more

likely. to have ‘parents (particularly. mothers) who ‘are more ‘supportive (Lawson,

and Chaffin, 1992). In Priebe and Svedin's (2008): study. of young peopie,
parental ‘bonding: (positive relationship with parent who was not overprotective)
‘was ‘identified as the most t Significant ‘predictor of disclosure for both boys and

Metlvaney (2608) | ‘found that many. ‘young people j in n her ‘study were - reluctant

about the: consequences for others. of their disclosure. One 13-year-old girl
described ‘her ‘concern: that if she: told, her uncle would. go to jail, and. her small
cousins would be: left without a father:

“Edidn’t want them,to growup’with no Dad and just looking ‘at . . their other little :friends
having their’ Dad holding‘their hand [:feltilike:Tavas: taking their'Dad away: trom:them’ (Ds: 130)

Gender has been found ‘to influence. disclosure. in. that boys appear to: be
more feluctarit to disclose. than girls (Goodman-Brown ef al, 2003;

Mershkowitz et al, 2005; Ungar éf al., 2009). Mental health difficulties on,

children experience dissociative symptoms or other: post- -traumatic ‘stress
symptomatology (Pricbe and Svedin, 2008).

Some studies have ‘found that, the severity of abuse (¢-g. penetrative, abuse)
predicts earlier disclosure ‘while other studies haye. found: no ‘relationship
between different types ofabuse:and disclosure:timing. Similarly, the relationship
between the duration of abuse —-one-off incidents:ofabuse: compared with abuse

although. as noted ‘aboye, most studies have found that older children are more
