‘Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document509-1. Filed 11/24/21 Page 9 of 10

First, the defendant:tries to:sncak in a claim that Minor Victim-4’s trial testimony will be

inconsistent'with her statementsto[

L_]@pe. 16). Whcther.or not that is:so.remains to be seen, but-cither way it has nothing to
do with. Dr. ‘Hall. Ifthe witness said, thingsto[ | that’ satisfy all the'prerequisites for
admitting extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent. statements, then perhaps [] could testify
about'those'statements. ‘Unless, however, Dr. Hall was in the room during] | therapy’
sessions, it remains hearsay: as'to, him.

Second, the Court’s ruling that Minor Victim-4:can be cross-examined on her prior
‘inconsistent, statements to law enforcement (see Opp... 1.6) docs. not help: the defendant. What the
Court ruled ‘was 'that*the witness could, be impeached on the grounds that she “changed her story
to law enforcement . . . [p]rovided that the rules for admitting prior inconsistent statements are
satisfied.” (11/1/2021 Tr. at;27-28). The Government agrees—such testimony is'admissible:
“provided thatthe rules, for admitting prior inconsistent statements are satisfied.” And the
Government has already shown, that Minor Victim-4 has not. “changed-her story” relative to: her
interview. with Dr. Hall, because there is, no ‘reason. that-story‘would have included the
defendant’s crimes. (Mot..1.7-18). Because:the defendant offers no contrary argument, she
cannotrely on this basis to call Dr., Hall.

Third, the defendant claims that:she docs not have. to make such.a showing of
inconsistency in‘order to.admit a-prior inconsistent statement. (Opp. 16). That:is obvious legal
error. As the Second Circuit has quite: emphatically explained, although two'statements do not:
have'to be directly contrary'to be inconsistent, the district. court must’ find some meaningful

inconsistency before the rule-applies. United States v. .rzaska, 111 F.3d 1019, 1024-25 (2d Cir.
