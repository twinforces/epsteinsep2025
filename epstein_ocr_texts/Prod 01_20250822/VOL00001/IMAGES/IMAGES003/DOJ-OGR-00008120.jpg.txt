Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document509-1 Filed 11/24/21 Page 9of10

First, the defendant tries to sneak in a claim that Minor Victim-4’s trial testimony will be
inconsistent with her statements to ee
BE Op». 16). Whether or not that is so remains to be seen, but either way it has nothing to
do with Dr. Hall. Ifthe witness said things to | | that satisfy all the prerequisites for
admitting extrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent statements, then perhaps a could testify
about those statements. Unless, however, Dr. Hall was in the room during therapy
sessions, it remains hearsay as to him.

Second, the Court’s ruling that Minor Victim-4 can be cross-examined on her prior
inconsistent statements to law enforcement (see Opp. 16) does not help the defendant. What the
Court ruled was that the witness could be impeached on the grounds that she “changed her story
to law enforcement . . . [p]rovided that the rules for admitting prior inconsistent statements are
satisfied.” (11/1/2021 Tr. at 27-28). The Government agrees—such testimony is admissible
“provided that the rules for admitting prior inconsistent statements are satisfied.” And the
Government has already shown that Minor Victim-4 has not “changed her story” relative to her
interview with Dr. Hall, because there is no reason that story would have included the
defendant’s crimes. (Mot. 17-18). Because the defendant offers no contrary argument, she
cannot rely on this basis to call Dr. Hall.

Third, the defendant claims that she does not have to make such a showing of
inconsistency in order to admit a prior inconsistent statement. (Opp. 16). That is obvious legal
error. As the Second Circuit has quite emphatically explained, although two statements do not
have to be directly contrary to be inconsistent, the district court must find some meaningful
inconsistency before the rule applies. United States v. Trzaska, 111 F.3d 1019, 1024—25 (2d Cir.
