Re: USA v. Maxwell, No. 1:20-cr-00330-AJN
Dear Judge Nathan,

I write on behalf of American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. (“ABC News”) and
NBCuUniversal News Group (“NBC News”) to join in the requests of The Miami Herald (Dkt.
No. 581) and The New York Times to oppose the sealing of the motion for a new trial and
supporting exhibits filed by the Defendant (Dkt. No. 578), for all the reasons set forth in those
requests.

ABC News and NBC News further respectfully request that Juror 50’s_ motion to
intervene, which according to this Court’s prior orders (Dkt. Nos. 575 & 576) was e-mailed to
the Court and placed under temporary seal, now be unsealed. Like the Defendant’s Motion for a
New Trial, Juror 50’s motion is a “judicial document” to which the presumption of access under
both the common law and the First Amendment applies because Juror 50’s motion has been, and
continues to be, highly “relevant to the performance of the judicial function and useful in the
Judicial process.” U.S. v. Amadeo, 44 F. 3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995) (““Amodeo I”).
