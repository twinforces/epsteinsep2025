under Rule 404(b) or as direct evidence of the sex trafficking counts; (5) reviewing 400 juror
questionnaires, conferring with the defense, and filing lists of for-cause strikes with the Court; (6)
responding to the defendant’s fourth bail motion (see Dkt. No. 408); and (7) conferring with the
MDC regarding the defendant’s legal mail and transportation to the courthouse.2, By November
10, the Government will also (8) respond to defense objections to the admissibility of co-
conspirator statements, including a discussion of statements that postdate the charged period of the
conspiracy; (9) propose procedures for the use of pseudonyms following conferral with defense
counsel; and (10) provide a letter regarding the admissibility of Government Exhibit 52. This is
in addition to the ordinary press of preparing for trial, which in this case involves, among other
things, extensive travel to meet with victim witnesses.

The Government is grateful for the care and attention that the Court has devoted to this
case and the speed and efficiency with which the Court has resolved pretrial matters. In the
Government’s view, however, the foregoing confluence of deadlines seriously taxes the
Government’s ability to provide the Court with the thorough, careful briefing and advocacy that
the Court rightly expects. It is not practicable to further require the Government to brief in six
days the admissibility of testimony from several defense expert witnesses, particularly when (a)
the defense had six months to brief the admissibility of a single expert witness; (b) the defense has
clearly known the identity of these eight experts for some time; and (c) there is additional time
between now and the start of trial in which to brief and resolve the issues surrounding these experts.

Accordingly, the Government respectfully requests that the Court set a deadline for any
? In addition, on November 3, 2021, the Government provided the Court with the joint request to
charge and verdict form, for which the Government received full comments from the defense late
last night.
