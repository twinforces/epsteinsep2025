Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 84 of 93
Use of Electronic Communications
Some of the evidence in this case has consisted of electronic communications seized from
computers or electronic accounts. There is nothing illegal about the Government’s use of such
electronic communications in this case and you may consider them along with all the other
evidence in the case. Whether you approve or disapprove of the seizure of these communications
may not enter your deliberations.
You may, therefore, regardless of any personal opinions, consider this evidence along
with all the other evidence in the case in determining whether the Government has proven the
defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. However, as with the other evidence, it is for you to
determine what weight, if any, to give such evidence.

v. Lebedev, 15 Cr. 769 (AJN).
