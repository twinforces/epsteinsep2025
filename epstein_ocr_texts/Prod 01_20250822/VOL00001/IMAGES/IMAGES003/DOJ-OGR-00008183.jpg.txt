Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document516 Filed 11/21/21 Page11o0f17

testimony. for'a’permissible purpose, the Court finds a substantial risk that. jurors will instead use
Dr. Dictz’s testimony to evaluate'the credibility of witnesses before them. This risk of confusing:
‘or. misleading the jury substantially outweighs the little permissible relevance that the opinion
has.

The Defense :in. its response does, not mention the third picce of Dr. Dictz’s, opinion on
witness credibility, which is that victims of sexual abuse have higher rates of mental illness and.
substance abuse that. ‘‘can affect: memory andrecall.” Notice at 11. Itis unclear to the Court:
why this opinion is helpful to the jury: or relevant'to the Defense’s.case. Indeed, it seems directly
contrary‘to the Defense’s. position. at the Daubert hearing that:it:intends to impeach the
eredibility of some alleged victims because of their substance abuse. Nov. 10 Tr. at 156-57.
Without more, the Court excludes'this opinion under Rules 401..and 403 as irrelevant, as
needlessly cumulative with, Dr. Rocchio’s opinion about; substance abuse, and beeause it is likely

Dr. Dictz’s last:opinion is “drawn nearly verbatim” from an academic article that lists
eleven “pathways to false sexual assault allegations,” which are: lying, implicd consent, false:
memorics, intoxication, antisocial ‘personality disorder, bordcrline:personality disorder, histrionic:
personality disorder, delirium, psychotic disorders, dissociation, and. intellectual, disability.
Notice at, 7-10; Gov"t.Br., Ex. C (“Pathways Article”). The Government argues that this
testimony:should be excluded becausc:it is not based. on-rcliable methods, it involves lay topics
within. the ken. of the jury, and it docs not fit the facts of the case. Gov't Br. at; 18-21.

Based on-the. facts currently before it, the Court ‘will. riot admit this. opinion. First, Dr.
Dictz’s opinion:relics on,a single article that presents these explanations for false accusations but

provides ‘no, empirical basis for how’ frequent any'of them are. ./:.g., Pathways Article at.97
