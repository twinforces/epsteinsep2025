Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 497 _ Filed 11/23/21 Page7of1i1

1 As you know from experience, you can hear one person give his or her

2 version of an event and think it sounds very impressive or even compelling, and

3. yet, upon hearing another person’s version of the same event — or even the same

4 person cross-examined with respect to the event — things may seem very different.

5 In other words, there may be another side to any witness’s story.

6 You should use your common sense and good judgment to evaluate each

7 witness’s testimony based on all of the circumstances. Again, I cannot emphasize

8 too strongly that you must keep an open mind until the trial is over. You should

9 not reach any conclusions until you have all the evidence before you.
10 As I mentioned during jury selection, this case has received, and will
11 continue to receive, significant attention in the media. To protect their privacy, I
12 have permitted witnesses, if they choose, to be referred to in open court by either
13. their first name or a pseudonym. The full names of the witnesses are known to the
14 Government, the defendant, and to the Court, and were shown to you during jury
15 selection. This process should not bear in any way on your evaluation of the
16 evidence in this case.
