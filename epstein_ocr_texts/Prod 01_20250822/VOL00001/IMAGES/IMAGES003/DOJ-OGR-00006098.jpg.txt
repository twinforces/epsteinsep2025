Count Four: Transportation of a Minor to Engage in Illegal Sexual Activity — Third
Element
The third element of Count Four which the government must prove beyond a reasonable
doubt is that |Ms. Maxwell knew that iadiidual[Jane Doe-1 pseudonym] was less than Commented [RA(46]: GOVERNMENT RESPONSE: As
stated on page 25, this instruction is captured in the state law
seventeen years old at the time of the acts alleged in Count Four of the Indictment. Although the —_
text of the law says the individual must be less than eighteen, because the New York criminal
law provides that a person can consent to sexual activity if she is seventeen, this element requires
| that Ms. Maxwell knew that [Jane Doe-1_pseudonym]#heind+adual was less than seventeen at
the time of the offense.
Adapted from Sand, et al., Modern Federal Jury Instructions, Instr.
64-19 (“Although section 2423(a) requires that the person
transported be less than eighteen . . . [i]f the defendant is charged
with transporting for the purpose of engaging in illegal sexual
activity, and that underlying activity requires that the victim be less
than some other age, then it can only confuse the jury to charge
that the victim must be less than eighteen in this instruction and
less than that other age elsewhere in the instructions.”). See New
York State Penal Law §§ 15.20(3), 130.55
