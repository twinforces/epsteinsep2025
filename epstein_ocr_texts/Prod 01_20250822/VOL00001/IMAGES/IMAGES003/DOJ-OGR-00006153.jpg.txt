Redaction Of Evidentiary Items
[If Applicable]
We have, among the exhibits received in evidence, some documents that are redacted.

“Redacted” means that part of the document has been taken out. Material may be redacted for any
number of reasons, including that it is not relevant to the issues you must decide in this case, among
other reasons. You are to concern yourself only with the part of the item that has been admitted
into evidence, and you should not consider any possible reason for the redactions.

Adapted from the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United

States v. Jones, 16 Cr. 553 (AJN); and the charge of the Hon. Richard

J. Sullivan, Jury Charge, United States v. Adony Nina, et al., 13 Cr.

322 (S.D.N.Y. 2013).
