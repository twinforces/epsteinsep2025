enticement offense charged in Count Two, the Court must give the same instruction as to Count
Two as well.!

Supplemental Jury Instruction
Second, we believe that the Court’s response to the jury note was substantively incorrect
and prejudicial to Ms. Maxwell. “A jury’s interruption of its deliberations ‘to seek further
explanation of the law’ is a ‘critical moment in a criminal trial’; and [the Second Circuit] therefore
ascribe[s] ‘crucial importance’ to a ‘completely accurate statement by the judge’ at that moment.”
United States v. Kopstein, 759 F.3d 168, 172 (2d Cir. 2014) (quoting United States v. Lefkowitz,
284 F.2d 310, 314 (2d Cir. 1960)). “Instructions are erroneous if they mislead the jury as to the
correct legal standard or do not adequately inform the jury of the law.” Hudson v. New York City,

left the jury ‘highly confused’ may, on that ground alone, be reversed.”))). “Even if an initial

New York statute. While we do not contest that alleged sexual activity that occurred in other states can be evidence of
those conspiracies, the jury cannot convict Ms. Maxwell on those counts without finding that she acted with the intent
that someone under the age of 17 would engage in sexual activity within the state of New York that violated New
York law.
