Thus, the verdict, must ‘represent the considered. judgment of cach juror. In order to
return a verdict, it.is necessary that cach juror agree to it. Your verdict must! be unanimous.

If.at any time you are divided, do not report how the vote:stands, and if you have:
reached a.verdict, do not report what. it:is until you ‘are asked in, open court.

A Verdict form. has been prepared for your convenience. After you have reached your
decision, your foreperson, will fill in the form. At that point'the foreperson should advise the
marshal outside your door that you are ‘ready’'to, return, to the courtroom.

Finally,, I say this not. because. | think it is:necessary, but because it isthe custom:in this
courthouse to say’this: You should treat cach other’with courtesy and-respeet, during:your
deliberations.

In.conclusion, ladies and. gentlemen, I.am.sure:that.if you listen to the views of your
fellow jurors, and if you ‘apply your own common, sense, ‘you will deliberate: fairly.

Members ofthe juiry,.| ask your patience for a few minutes longer: It is:nccessary for me

to spend.a, few:moments' with.counsel and the reporter at'the side bar. 1 will ask you to remain
patiently. in’the jury. box, without spcaking to, cach other, and we will returnin, just 'a;moment to

submit'the case to you. Thank:you..
