1 THE COURT: Government 10. Let me say, as a

2 preliminary matter, the government requests that the entirety

3 of this motion be sealed. I have read the government's letter
4 and the footnote 11 in the motion. In my mind they don't

5 justify sealing. As best I can understand the argument the

6 government is saying that the defense should be precluded from
7 make a certain argument because there is no evidence in support
8 of it. If the government is right about that then pretrial

9 publicity would amount to coverage that there is no evidence of
10 that argument. If the government is wrong about that then the
11 evidence in argument comes in so there is no prejudice either
12 way. Frankly, I think the theory of prejudice here runs

13 counter to the whole project of pretrial motion in limine

14 practice which is to litigate, for purposes of trial

15 preparation and trial efficiency and opening statements and the
16 like, what's in and what's out. That's going to sometimes

17 require litigation on what's out. So I don't see a basis to

18 seal this and I think we can discuss it today.

19 But let me begin by simply asking the defense if it
20 intends to make the argument that is outlined in the
21 government's motion 10.
22 MS. STERNHEIM: Your Honor, it is too soon to say what
23 we are going to do at trial. Certainly we have no burden of
24 putting on a case and I know the government is well aware of
25 that, but insofar as the government seeks to preclude us from
