exactly on-point. Setting aside: that proof of Epstcin’s “sexual preferences” is impermissible:
propensity: evidence (discussed. further. below), at most, Accuscr-3"s: evidence would show that
Epstein was engaged in legal sexual activity with, someone: over the age of consent and that Ms.
Maxwell allegedly knew that.he was cngaged in such legal activity. Hence; her evidence is no
more:admissible as. direct proof of the sex trafficking conspiracy than it.is of the Mann Act
conspiracies. The bases for admitting. Accuser-3’s evidence suffer from the same logical and legal
defeets that the Court already identified with:respect to the Mann.Act counts. It should therefore

Wi. Accuser-3’s, Evidence is Improper Propensity Evidence that.Is Inadmissible Under
Rule 404(b) and Rule 403

Accuser-3’s evidence is also inadmissible under Rule 404(b) and Rule 403. Recognizing
that Accuser-3’s evidence will likely not be admissible as direct;evidenee of the charged.
conspiracies. in light of the Court's prior findings, the government attempts to bootstrap her
evidence into the case’ by arguing that it is admissible for various purposes under Rule 404(b). See’
November 5 Ltrat 7-11. Although.the government trics ‘to frame: this evidence ‘in terms of.
permissible:404(b) purposes, such as Ms. Maxwell’s knowledge, motive; intent, cte., it is evident.
from the government’s submissions and, its comments at.the:last two court conferences that it
intends. to offer this evidence for an impermissible propensity purpose; namely to, establish. that.
Jeffrey Epstein.had “sexual preference” for young girls and.to argue that he acted.in. conformity

with that: preference with.Accuser-3 and thercfore must have done so‘as well with the other

Accusers. See id. at 7 1.2% 11/1/2021 Tr. at 7723-77:12. Such évidence is not admissible under
