For example, Juror 50’s motion was submitted after the Court ordered counsel for the
juror to submit any briefing on the appropriateness of an inquiry. Dkt. Nos. 571, 573. The
juror’s submission prompted two Orders by the Court in which it reached conclusions about
whether it should consider Juror 50’s motion before or after it addresses the question of whether
an inquiry should be permitted, which may also affect whether Juror 50 has standing to be heard
on that question. Dkt. Nos. 575, 576. At the Court’s direction it would also appear that the
juror’s motion is the subject of multiple rounds of briefing by the parties: First, on the question
of whether the juror’s motion should be redacted and/or docketed, and now on its procedural and
substantive merits in the context of briefing the Defendant’s Motion for a New Trial. /d. All of
those actions involve performance of the judicial function and the judicial process. Nor does the
fact that the Court has deferred considering and/or ruling on Juror No. 50’s motion affect its
status as a “Judicial document”. Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110, 121 (2d.
Cir. 2006) (rejecting the argument that “until a district court knows the disposition of the
underlying motion, any attempt at calling something a judicial document is premature’’).

Moreover, because the proceedings noted above reflect that Juror 50’s motion is “directly
affect[ing] the adjudication” of this case, the public’s presumption of access to it is especially
high. United States v. Amodeo, 71 F.3d 1044, 1049 (2d Cir. 1995) (“Amodeo IT’). The
presumption is likewise strong because the juror’s motion affects both the juror’s and the parties’
legal rights. /d. Those include whether Juror 50 is afforded standing to be heard and, more
broadly, the issues being briefed related to the Defendant’s request for a new trial. And while
Juror 50’s motion is under temporary seal, the posture of this case illustrates why there is a
