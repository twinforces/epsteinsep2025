Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

On November 1, 2021, the Defense noticed eight expert witnesses. Def. Br., Ex. 1
(“Notice”). On November 8, 2021, the Government filed a motion to partially preclude the
testimony of two of those experts, Dr. Dietz and Dr. Loftus. Gov’t Br., Dkt. No. 424. The
Defense filed a response via email on November 12, 2021, to permit the Government the
opportunity to propose redactions.

In an Opinion and Order temporarily filed under seal, the Court DENIES in part and
GRANTS in part the Government’s motion to preclude Dr. Dietz’s testimony and DENIES in
part and GRANTS in part the Government’s motion to preclude Dr. Loftus’s testimony. It does
so after considering the admissibility of the anticipated testimony under Federal Rule of
Evidence 702 and Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993).

The Court will send the temporarily sealed Opinion & Order to the parties. By
November 23, 2021, the parties are ORDERED to inform the Court whether either seeks sealing
or limited redactions of the Court’s Opinion & Order, justifying any such request by reference to
the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435
F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). In addition, by that date, the parties are FURTHER ORDERED to file
