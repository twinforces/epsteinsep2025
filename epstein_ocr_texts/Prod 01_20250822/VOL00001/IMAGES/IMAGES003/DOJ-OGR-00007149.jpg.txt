1 discrete fashion, and I believe they do not have knowledge

2 about what the other officers did or didn't do as part of that
3 search. So what we end up with is this piecemeal approach of:
4 I was over here and did this, somebody over there did that, but
5 I can't put it all together for you 20 years after the fact.

6 And look, I understand if they have a witness who

7 could say I was there, I saw this, I can authenticate, that's

8 fine. I don't have a problem with that. But again, they

9 haven't identified that witness or what pieces of this that

10 witness is going to talk about. So that's problem number one.
11 Problem number two is the timing of this. This is an
12 October 2005 search where they seized items that they're trying
13 to now relate back to a 1994 to 2004 timeframe. What that

14 table has to do with 1994, I don't know. 2004, I don't know.
15 Whether it was there in 2004, we don't know. All we know is

16 that in a moment in time, in October 2005, someone says these
17 items were seized and that ends up on a search warrant

18 inventory from a deceased detective that doesn't have any

19 foundation to it. That's my problem, your Honor.
20 And there may be discrete pieces of evidence that a
21 certain witness might be able to identify, but I think we're
22 just short shrifting the whole evidentiary process here with
23 these proffers where they're saying we can do it, and I'm not
24 convinced they can.
25 THE COURT: We're not short shrifting because it
