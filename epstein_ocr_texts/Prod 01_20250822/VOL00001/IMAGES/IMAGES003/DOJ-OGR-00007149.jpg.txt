LB1LTMAX3:

discrete fashion, and I believe they do not have knowledge
about. what. the other officers did or didn't do as part of that
search. So what! we end up with iS this piecemeal approach of:
L was over here and. did. this, somebody ‘over there did that, but
T can't put it all together for you 20 years after the fact.
And Look, I. understand. if they have a witness who
could say I Was there, I Saw this, I can autheénticdte, that's.
fine, I don't. have a problem with that. But again, they
haven't identified ‘that witness or what pieces of this that
witness is going to talk about. So that's problem number one’,

Problem number two is the taming of this. THis is an

October 2005 search where they seized items that they'me tnying
to now relate back to a 1994 to 2004 tinieframe. What. that
table has to do with 1994, I don"t know. 2004, I, don't know.
Whethér it. was there in 2004, we don't know. All we know is

that in amoment in time, in October 2005, someone says these

items weré Seized and that ends up on a search warrant

inventory from a deceased detective that doesn't have any
founddtion to it. That's my problem, your Horior.

And there may be discrete pieces of evidence that a
certain witness might be able to identify, but I think we're
just short shriftang the whole evidentiary process here with

these proffers where they're saying we can do it, and I'm not.

Gonvinced they can.

THE COURT: We're not short shrifting because it
