There is no neéd ‘to litigate the Defense. Motion ‘under seal just because, the Court and the
parties are contemplating a hearing where Juror 50 may be a’witness. Throughout the course of
‘this case (as in, most ‘if not. cvery: casc), the partics have publicly litigated evidentiary: issues
‘implicating witness testimony, -such.that witnesses or thcir:counsel could access the bricfing if they:
so'wished. In this casc, the partics publicly filed significant pre-trial briefing, including pre-trial
motions and motions 7” /imineé, that included details about witness testimony. For example, in
motions in. limine, the: parties litigated. the: legal contours of the testimony of the witness who
testified under:the pscudonym, Kate, ‘as well as the circumstances of Carolyn’s identification of the
defendant. See, é.g.,. Dkt. Nos. 387,392, 397. Neither the, Government nor'the defendant sought
be temporarily’ scaled because: Government ‘witnesses could access such filings (or news articles
about such-filings) and accordingly tailor thcir trial testimony. There is:no reason that the Defense
Motion should. be treated: differently and litigated entirely underseal.

The defendant’s argument that the public dockcting, of the Defensé Motion ‘will enable
Juror 50 to “plan out and tailor his responses” is not only inconsistent with the foregoing practice
in. this (like every) case, but; it is also unsupported, by any ‘legal authority. (Def. Letter at 2). The
defendant’s reliance on cases involving pre-trial. publicity is inapposite. Those eases. concern the
right to a fair wial, and, in those cases, sealing.is proper upon specific. findings that, infer alia,
“there is a substantial probability: that.the defendant’s right. to ‘a, fair trial will be prejudiced by.
publicity...” United States v. Silver, No..1S Cr. 93 (VEC), 2016 WL 1572993, at *8 (S.D.N.Y.
Apr. 14,2016) (quotations and.citations omitted). But in such a posture, the potential prejudice is
that ‘the jury—the relevant finder of fact—will learn ‘prejudicial. information ‘that they. otherwise:

would:not. /d¢.. Here, by significant.contrast, the Court is the relevant finder. of fact, and.the: Court:
