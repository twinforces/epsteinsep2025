1 MS. MOE: But, beyond that, your Honor, we don't

2 anticipate this would be an issue.

3 THE COURT: OK. I think we are in agreement.

4 My clerk noted I inadvertently skipped over Government
5 5 so we will return to that. This is the government's

6 expectation that the testimony of certain witnesses would

7 include statements by individuals that are not testifying and

8 the government argues that the defense can't attack the

9 credibility of those non-testifying individuals because their
10 statements would not be admitted for their truth but, for

11 example, their effect on the testifying witness and the like.
12 Again, I think without more specificity it is

13 difficult to make a definitive ruling but I'm happy to hear

14 examples to give some guidance.

15 Ms. Moe?

16 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

17 I think there will be Limited testimony from a victim
18 about her interaction with other victims. I think the

19 statements that would come in from those other victims would be
20 offered not for their truth but because they are instructions,
al they would be offered for that effect on listener and to
22 explain the course of events that followed. We don't
23 anticipate offering any statements from non-testifying victims
24 for their truth and so we don't anticipate opening the door to
25 a line of cross-examination about their credibility. And so,
