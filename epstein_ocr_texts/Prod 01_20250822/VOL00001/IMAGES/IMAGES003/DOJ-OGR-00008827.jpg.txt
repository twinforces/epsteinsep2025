visual distortion to hide his identity,” and he has openly discussed not only his experience on the
Maxwell jury, but also his past sexual abuse that gave rise to the filing of Ms. Maxwell’s motion
for a new trial.’ In fact, it was Juror No. 50’s public statements to the press that Jed to Ms. Maxwell
moving for a new trial. The controversy began in the public arena, and any attempts by Ms.
Maxwell to now shut the media and the public out of it are baseless.

Where information that a party seeks to seal has already been made public, the party cannot
meet its burden of overcoming the presumption of public access. See Alcon Vision, LLC v.
Lens.com, No. 18-CV-0407 (NG), 2020 WL 3791865, at *7-8 (E.D.N.Y. July 7, 2020) (“[Party
contesting unsealing| cannot defeat the already heavy presumption in favor of public access with
respect to materials that are ‘already in the public domain.’”). Continued sealing of documents that
are already in the public domain would be “futile.” Jn re Application to Unseal 98 Cr. 1101(ILG),
891 F. Supp. 2d 296, 300 (E.D.N.Y. 2012) (“[T]he cat is out of the bag, the genie is out of the
bottle.”). The Court “simply do[es] not have the power, even were we of the mind to use it if we
had, to make what has thus become public private again.” Gambale, 377 F.3d at 144.

Ms. Maxwell has no basis for arguing that the entirety of the submissions regarding Juror
No. 50 should be sealed, when the same information has already been widely disseminated among
the public. See In re Application to Unseal 98 Cr. 1101(ILG), 891 F. Supp. 2d at 300 (“Any
balancing of the interests here, however, would be academic as the information the Government
and Doe seek to maintain sealed has already been publicly revealed... .”).
