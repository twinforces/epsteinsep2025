Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

As a post-trial housekeeping matter, Court staff directed the parties via email to complete
the process of providing copies of Court Exhibits with narrowly tailored redactions (e.g.,
redactions to protect the anonymity of jurors and of witnesses the Court permitted to testify
under pseudonyms) for the Court to docket. The Government subsequently submitted one court
exhibit with the name unredacted of a witness subject to the Court’s anonymity order.
Subsequently the Defense indicated in a temporarily sealed letter why the name was unredacted.
The Government is accordingly ORDERED to docket a letter on ECF on or before January 28,
2022, indicating why a redaction is no longer being sought for the name of this witness. Once
the Government confirms in that letter that it no longer seeks redaction of the name, then the
Defense may file the temporarily sealed letter on the docket without redaction of the name. The
Court will then docket all Court Exhibits.

SO ORDERED.
