automatically admit. his ‘alternative explanation for‘his flight, insofar as he wishes to bring in, his
out-of-court statcments to. others on. social.'media or to prison officials.”). The Government is
able to introduce the defendant’s. statements ‘as statements. of an.opposing, party under Federal
Rule: of Evidence 801(d)(2)(A). See Fed. ‘R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(A): (defining as. “not hearsay” a.
Statement “offered against an opposing party” and “made by the party”). But'the. Federal Rules
‘contain no parallel, provision for the defendant. See Marin, 669 F:2d at 84. Instead, if the:
defendant wishes ‘to ‘place her own, statements before the jury, she must testify’ so, the
Government may: cross-examine her. See United States v. Yousef, 327 F.3d 56,153 (2d. Cir.
2003) (holding that. defendant “could. have testified to everything asserted in his statement, [but]
he could, not offer the document itself‘for the truth ofthe matter asserted”), overriled On, other
grounds -by.Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.S. 778 (2009).

Notwithstanding the hearsay’ ‘bar, .a, defendant may in limited circumstances invoke the
so-called “rule of completéticss” to, require. the introduction of additional, portions of his or her
own, out-of-court statement when, the Government offers ‘excerpts of it. See Fed. R. Evid. 106
(“Ifa party introduces all or part of a-writing or recorded ‘statement, an adverse party may require
the introduction, at that time, of any other part—or ‘any other writing or recorded ‘statement—that.
in fairness ought to be considered. at, the same time.”). “Under this principle, even though a.
statement. may be hearsay, an ‘omitted. portion of [the] statement.'must be -placed in evidence if
necessary to explain. the admitted. portion, to place the admitted portion ‘in. context, to avoid.
misleading the: jury, or to ensure: fair, ‘and. impartial ‘understanding of ‘the: admitted portion.’”
