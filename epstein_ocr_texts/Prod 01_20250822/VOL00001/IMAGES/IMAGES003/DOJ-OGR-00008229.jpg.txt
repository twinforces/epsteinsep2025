The ‘photographs at issue, were'taken, in 2019, twenty-five years after Jane was purportedly at the,
house and fifteen years after any alleged conspiracy‘ended.

Although the government can show that'the photos accurately reflect Mr. Epstcin’s
apartment as it cxisted.in'2019, no witness has testified thatthe. photos accurately depict the
home.as it.existed in 1994 or 1995 or 1996, or even-that:the:photos depict items similar to what
Jane claims to have scen a-quarter of a.century ago. ‘The government, therefore, has not,
authenticated the ‘photos, and'the évidence:is irrelevant and unfairly misleading and prejudicial.

The government devotes six pages of its letter to the 2019, photos of the:massage room.
Gov. Letter at;3-8. In, addition to the'temporal ‘flaws described, above, the government/s argument
suffers. from, another problem: It conflates Jarie’s:testimony about other parts of the house with
her testimony: about.the: massage room. While Jane described the curtains, walls, wallpaper,
artwork, and decorations in other“parts of the house, she specifically. disclaimed. looking atthe:
walls in the: massage room, saying: “My eyes didn’t-even look-at.the:walls, mostly:the floor, if
not, what:was. going on.” Conveniently, the government omits this testimonial disclaimer from. its
letter. Given this testimony, however; even if Jane’s testimony about what other parts of the
house looked like in 1994.or 1995 or.1996 provided. a basis for. admitting photos of:those.other
parts of the house taken in, 201.9 (which, it;docsn’t), that testimony‘still wouldn’t-justify
admission of photos of the massage, room.

The fundamental flaw in the government's logic is its failure to: appreciate that
“{ajuthentication.. .. establishes, the parameters of relevance.” S/earns, 550 .F:2d at 1170. The
government claims the: 2019 photos are independently: corroborative ‘of Janc’s testimony because

they’ show: that her description of Mr. Epstein’s house as ‘it-cxisted. in 1994 and.1995 and 1996
