The photographs at issue were taken in 2019, twenty-five years after Jane was purportedly at the
house and fifteen years after any alleged conspiracy ended.

Although the government can show that the photos accurately reflect Mr. Epstein’s
apartment as it existed in 2019, no witness has testified that the photos accurately depict the
home as it existed in 1994 or 1995 or 1996, or even that the photos depict items similar to what
Jane claims to have seen a quarter of a century ago. The government, therefore, has not
authenticated the photos, and the evidence is irrelevant and unfairly misleading and prejudicial.

The government devotes six pages of its letter to the 2019 photos of the massage room.
Gov. Letter at 3-8. In addition to the temporal flaws described above, the government’s argument
suffers from another problem: It conflates Jane’s testimony about other parts of the house with
her testimony about the massage room. While Jane described the curtains, walls, wallpaper,
artwork, and decorations in other parts of the house, she specifically disclaimed looking at the
walls in the massage room, saying: “My eyes didn’t even look at the walls, mostly the floor, if
not what was going on.” Conveniently, the government omits this testimonial disclaimer from its
letter. Given this testimony, however, even if Jane’s testimony about what other parts of the
house looked like in 1994 or 1995 or 1996 provided a basis for admitting photos of those other
parts of the house taken in 2019 (which it doesn’t), that testimony still wouldn’t justify
admission of photos of the massage room.

The fundamental flaw in the government’s logic is its failure to appreciate that
“Taluthentication ... establishes the parameters of relevance.” Stearns, 550 F.2d at 1170. The
government claims the 2019 photos are independently corroborative of Jane’s testimony because
they show that her description of Mr. Epstein’s house as it existed in 1994 and 1995 and 1996
