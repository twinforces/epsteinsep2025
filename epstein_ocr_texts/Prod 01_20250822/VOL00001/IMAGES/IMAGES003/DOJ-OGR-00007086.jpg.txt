1 an out-of-court statement you are putting on for the truth, it
2 is hearsay.

3 MS. MENNINGER: Slightly different, your Honor.

4 If a witness says they interviewed -- if a law

5 enforcement says they interviewed another accuser and that

6 accuser never said that Ms. Maxwell was involved, that's not a
7 hearsay statement. They just didn't mention her, it is the

8 absence of a statement. And as your Honor just ruled in terms
9 of the thoroughness of the investigation, if there is evidence
10 that the government puts on about these other accusers I think
11 that's what opens the door. It is not us opening the door, it
12 would be them submitting evidence that other people were

13 victims without putting those people on, putting on message

14 pads that had their names on it, and then precluding us from

15 introducing evidence that none of those individuals implicated
16 Ms. Maxwell.

17 THE COURT: Right. So, if the government does that

18 you are not precluded from putting other evidence on. The

19 question is what evidence would it be and would it be
20 admissible under the relevant rules of evidence. I am not sure
21 I can resolve that in the abstract. It sounds like neither
22 side intends to open with respect to this issue and I think we
23 largely agree on the legal principles. Tell me if you need
24 more guidance for purposes of opening or preparing your case.
25 Ms. Menninger?
