inconsistent statement and also expresses disagreement with the substance.” The parties are
hereby ORDERED to submit a letter citing authority (beyond the rule itself) for their respective
positions. The parties ace FURTHER ORDERED to indicate each disputed prior inconsistent
statement that was read into the record.
