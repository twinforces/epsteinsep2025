Ghislaine Maxwell,
ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

As a post-trial house-keeping matter, attached to this Order are the Court Exhibits. The
parties have proposed redactions to several exhibits and the sealing of Court Exhibit 4. The
Court concludes that the proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated by
the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006), and
narrowly tailored. The redactions serve the purpose of protecting the anonymity of jurors and of
victim-witnesses subject to the Court’s anonymity order. With respect to Court Exhibit 4, rather
than seal the entire document, the Court has redacted the information that would potentially
identify the victim-witness who testified pursuant to the Court’s anonymity order. Unredacted
copies of the Court Exhibits will be filed under seal.

SO ORDERED.
