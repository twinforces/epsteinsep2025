the admissibility of the other act evidence." Wright & Miller, supra. Should the Government
request a "good-cause" exemption for their failure to timely provide Rule 404(b) notice, this
Court should analyze their excuse with skepticism. "Prosecutors should be prepared to explain
their change of heart and to rebut allegations of sandbagging. Unforeseen turns of testimony at

The Rule 404(b) Letter also repeated the Government's opinion that the newly-disclosed
materials qualify as "direct evidence" of the conspiracy. At first blush, it is hard to see how they
could so qualify. The emails referenced in the Letter purport to be between Ms. Maxwell and
two adult men, apparently arranging dates for them, with adult women, sometime in the early
2000s. They do not reference or have anything to do with (a) the persons mentioned in the
Indictment or any other testifying witness, nor (b) any of the legal allegations contained in the
