1 purpose of this testimony is that these are illegal acts that
2 they're talking about, and unless they're instructed otherwise
3 by the Court, they may convict Ms. Maxwell on an improper
4 basis, which is that this witness's testimony is talking about
a illegal sexual activity, as that's charged in the indictment.
6 So there has to be a clarification on this point.
7 And I just would note, your Honor, the reason why
8 we're here in this position is because the government has
9 chosen to add Accuser 2, Accuser 3, people who have nothing to
10 do with violations of New York law, in this conspiracy, and if
11 they're going to do that and you try to use that as evidence of
12 a violation of New York law â€”-
13 THE COURT: Well, the charge is enticement. And, in
14 my mind, this witness is in a very different position than
15 witness 3.
16 MR. EVERDELL: Yes.
17 THE COURT: But it's certainly relevant evidence to
18 the enticement charge with respect to New York law. There's no
19 doubt about that.
20 But I agree, we have to make sure that the jury
21 understands, though it can be relevant evidence for that, if
22 they want to take it into account for whatever they want to
23 take it into account for, what they can't take it into account
24 for is itself the New Mexico activity -- sexual activity as
25 itself illegal conduct charged in the indictment.
