LB1 5MAX 2:

post'-dattiing the allegéd conspiracy. For example, ‘there are

document's -- I don.'t know, they weren't specified which

document's that this witness intends to authenticate, but among

the documents that I believe the witness may attempt to

atithenticate, they are dated in 2005 arid beyond. And so the
question really is whether you. can -- it is an authentication,

oné, whether that relates 'to the conspiracy or not. As we sét

forth in our reply, your Honor, there is a real concern because
a number of, I think, ‘the entire first series, of exhibits, are
largely taken from a period. outside of the charged conspiracy.
I think thisd witness flay attempt to authenticate some of those
exhibits and they haven't. established why that will be relevant
to thé charged time period of the conspiracy. They really
didn't. argue 404(b) on, this point and we asked for additional.

time in térms of the direct evidence because we had just

received these 400 pages that melate to that, ‘partacular

witness, your Honor.

THE COURT: Sq the basic contention would be if we
have a document that, oh its face, that pdost=dates the charged
conspiracy. J mean that, alone, is I think the first point of
your objection, right?

MS. MENNINGER: Yes, ‘your Honor.

THE COURT: The authenticgatidn issue aside. What is

the relevance of a document thdt, on its face, post-dates the.

charged. conspiracy? Let's start with that, Ms. Moe.
