1 post-dating the alleged conspiracy. For example, there are

2 documents -- I don't know, they weren't specified which

3 documents that this witness intends to authenticate, but among
4 the documents that I believe the witness may attempt to

5 authenticate, they are dated in 2005 and beyond. And so the

6 question really is whether you can -- it is an authentication,
7 one, whether that relates to the conspiracy or not. As we set
8 forth in our reply, your Honor, there is a real concern because
9 a number of, I think, the entire first series of exhibits, are
10 largely taken from a period outside of the charged conspiracy.
11 I think this witness may attempt to authenticate some of those
12 exhibits and they haven't established why that will be relevant
13 to the charged time period of the conspiracy. They really

14 didn't argue 404(b) on this point and we asked for additional
15 time in terms of the direct evidence because we had just

16 received these 400 pages that relate to that particular

17 witness, your Honor.

18 THE COURT: So the basic contention would be if we

19 have a document that, on its face, that post-dates the charged
20 conspiracy. I mean that, alone, is I think the first point of
21 your objection, right?
22 MS. MENNINGER: Yes, your Honor.
23 THE COURT: The authentication issue aside. What is
24 the relevance of a document that, on its face, post-dates the
25 charged conspiracy? Let's start with that, Ms. Moe.
