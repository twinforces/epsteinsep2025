Reasonable Doubt
The question that naturally arises is: “What is a reasonable doubt?” What does that
phrase mean? The words almost define themselves. A reasonable doubt is a doubt based in
reason and arising out of the evidence in the case, or the lack of evidence. It is a doubt that a
reasonable person has after carefully weighing all of the evidence in the case.
Reasonable doubt is a doubt that appeals to your reason, your judgment, your experience,
and your common sense. If, after a fair and impartial consideration of all the evidence, you can
| candidly and honestly say that you do have an abiding belief of Ms. Maxwell’s the defendants
guilt as to any crime charged in this case, such a belief as a prudent person would be willing to
act upon in important matters in the personal affairs of his or her own life, then you have no
reasonable doubt, and under such circumstances it is your duty to convict the-defendantMs.
Maxwell of the particular crime in question.
On the other hand, if after a fair and impartial consideration of all the evidence, you can
| candidly and honestly say that you are not satisfied with Ms. Maxwell’s the defendant’s guilt as
to any charge, that you do not have an abiding belief of her guilt as to that charge—in other
words, if you have such a doubt as would reasonably cause a prudent person to hesitate in acting
in matters of importance in his or her own affairs—then you have a reasonable doubt, and in that
circumstances it is your duty to acquit the defendantMs. Maxwell of that charge.
