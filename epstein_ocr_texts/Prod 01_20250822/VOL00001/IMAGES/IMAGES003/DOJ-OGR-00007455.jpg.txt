Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 497 _ Filed 11/23/21 Page3of11

1 does present a defense case, the defense witnesses will testify, and the government

2 will have the opportunity to cross-examine them.

3 After the presentation of evidence is completed, the parties will deliver their

4 closing arguments to summarize and interpret the evidence. Just as the parties’

5 opening statements are not evidence, their closing arguments are not evidence

6 either.

7 Following closing arguments, I will instruct you on the law. Then, you will

8 retire to deliberate on your verdict, which must be unanimous and must be based

9 onthe evidence or lack of evidence presented at trial. Your deliberations are
10 secret. You will never have to explain your verdict to anyone.
11 As I’ve told you, under the law, a defendant in a criminal case is presumed
12 imnocent and cannot be found guilty of the crimes charged unless a jury, after
13. having heard all of the evidence in the case, unanimously decides that the evidence
14 proves the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
15 In a criminal case the burden of proof remains with the prosecution — the
16 government. For the jury to return a verdict of guilty as to the defendant, the
17. government must prove that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. A
18 person charged with a crime has absolutely no burden to prove that she is not
19 guilty, and if the defendant chooses not to present any proof, that decision cannot
20 be held against her and may not enter into your deliberations at all. I will,
