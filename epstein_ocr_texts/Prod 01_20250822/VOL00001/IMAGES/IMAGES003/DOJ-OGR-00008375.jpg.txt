Accordingly, any évidence that does not bear on the defendant’s guilt or innocence ofthe charges
in, the: indictment:should. be excluded.as irrelevant, Rule 403 further, states that the Court. may:
“exclude relevant-evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by a danger of one or
more: of the following: unfair prejudice, confusing the issucs, misleading the jury, ‘undue delay,
wasting time, or needlessly. presenting cumulative evidence.” It is generally disfavored for a party
at a trial to call an attorney as a'witnéss against the attornéy’s client, because doing so intrudes on
the attorney-client relationship. Cf, ¢.g., 1 Att’y-Client -Privilege: in the: U.S. § 3:24 (2021)
(“Although attorneys are, subject to subpoena, just like any other witness, courts discourage: the
government’ from, calling the attorticy of a defendant, or of the ‘target. ofia criminal. investigation,

the attorney/witness and his client.””);, United States v. Schwartzbaum, 527. F.2d 249, 253 (2d.Cir.
