speculating that the accusers have already. been found, credible by.someone, or that.their decision,
is a foregone conclusion. On the other side of the probative-prejudicial scale, the government.
simultancously fails to articulate any probative valuc in-use of the term "victim," cither in. its jury
address or otherwise. Gf. Sfafe’v.. Wigg, 889 A.2d,233, 236 (Vt. 2005) ("the use of the term
‘victim’ had-no inherent. probative’value").

Second, the government improperly‘suggests in-response that the stricture on vouching.
should-not apply to the witnesses themselves. Resp. at: 79. .A’s explained by: numcrous cases,
having any witness refer to themselves. or another witness as a "victim" is:the very: height of
improper'vouching.. Sena, supra; State v. Sperou, 365 Or. 121,131,442 P-3d 581, 590 (2019)
("another witness’s description of the complaining witness as a.‘victim’' conveys an opinion. that,
the complaining witness is telling the truth. That is;what the:vouching rule: is:intended. to

therapeutic number of individuals who have self-identified as sexual abusevictims, without any:
research or‘investigation as to whether the individuals’ sclf-reports are truc. She then intends to
draw from her anecdotal and, experiential treatnient to generalize about all "victims" without. their
ever-having been.a. finding that any ofthe persons she has provided treatment to ‘were, in fact,
"victims." If she is permitted to'testify, there is no reason for her to vouch, forthe: credibility off
her patients, tinless shé-clarifics cach time, that she is taking ‘the. individual, attheir word that they
were in:fact a-victim. The danger of confusion to a jury:is that anyone treated by Dr, Rochio

must have been.a victim. A's the Wigg court:recognized, there will be! a "danger of unfair:
