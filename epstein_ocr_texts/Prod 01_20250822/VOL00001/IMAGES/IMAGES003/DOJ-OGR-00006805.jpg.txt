relationship with her victim’s parents to gain their approval of spending time
with their child.

Van Dam (2001) pointed out that many child molesters spend years gain-
ing the trust of members in the community before actually sexually abusing
any children. She hypothesized that these offenders use several social psy-
chological techniques to groom the community effectively. As an example,
they may use “foot-in-the-door technique” by showing up uninvited to a
child’s birthday party and spending time playing games with the children.
The parents would feel uncomfortable asking this person to leave and have
thus subtly cooperated with the offender. From then on it would be easier
for the offender to gain cooperation from the parents on spending time with
the children. Offenders can also use conformity against these parents—it
would go against social norms and be rude to ask a person to leave a party
when the children are enjoying spending time with an offender. In addition,
cognitive dissonance can play a role as the parents will try to make their
beliefs about the offender consistent with their actions of letting their chil-
dren around him or her (they will believe that they think he or she is a good
person). Finally, confirmation bias can also play a role as the parents will
tend to only accept information that is confirming their existing beliefs about
the offender.

Commonialities
The two major commonalities in the definitions reviewed as well as the
empirical studies of grooming are (a) some sort of inappropriate behav-
ior on the part of the prospective abuser (whether it is a bribe, boundary
violation, invasion of privacy, misstatement of morality, mischaracterizing
an interaction as a “game,” isolation, emotional manipulation, etc.) and (b)
the function of this inappropriate behavior is to increase the likelihood that
the adult can sexually abuse the child (by, for example, gaining access to
them, gaining their trust, silencing them, isolating them, desensitizing them
to nudity or sex, etc.). Each component of the definition may have different
topographies in individual cases (e.g., sometimes the inappropriate behavior
is removing a door to the child’s bedroom, or sometimes it may be buy-
ing the child a bikini), but the function of the behavior is to increase the
likelihood of future abusive contact.

A PROPOSED DEFINITION
Any definition ought to use the empirical findings reviewed previously about
common strategies used by sexual molesters. In addition, we believe that the
most useful definition of grooming would attempt to instantiate the following
definitional meta-criteria:
