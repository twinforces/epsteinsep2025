activity” with Epstcin. That, in.turn, may cause the jury to improperly convict Ms.. Maxwell
based on a ‘false assumption.

Einally,, the Court should give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction. to ensure:that:
the jury understands that the alleged conduct;was not-unlawful ‘and. docs not-consider it as
improper propensity. evidence. If Accuser-3 is allowed to testify that she cngaged:in sex. acts
with. Epstcin in London‘when she:was' 1.7, as the government has ‘proffered, the jury will almost
certainly assume that-the: alleged conduct was unlawful, .as it would be: in certain US. states, and
that the testimony is being offered to:prove that Epstein.and Accuser-3 engaged in-“illegal sexual
activity” in London. Accordingly, if Accuscr-3 is.allowed to testify, we request that the: Court.
give the jury.a limiting instruction containing the following points:

o The legal age of consent for sexual activity. in, the United. Kingdom
is 16'years old. That: was.also, the legal age. of consent from.:1994-
1995, when. Accuscr-3: alleges ‘she engaged in.sex. acts with Jeffrey
Epstein in.London-when. she was. 17 years old.

e The alleged conduct:that Accuscr-3 has described :in her testimony:
was therefore not illegal. If you find that these incidents took place,
] instruct:you that this. sexual activity cannot. be: considered “‘illegal”
or “criminal” or “unlawful” ‘for purposes of the crimes charged in
the indictment.

If the Court determines that: Accuser-3’s testimony ‘may be admitted.as.404(b) cvidence,
‘Ms. Maxwell further requests that’the; Court also give’thejury.an appropriate propensity
instruction. See Dolney, 2005 WL 2129169, at.*2 (“In the absence of such a limiting instruction,
there exists a legitimate concern that the jury might misapply [the] evidence to conclude that if
the defendants engaged. in criminal conduct:prior to the charged conspiracy, then the conduct at.

issuc in-these charges-must.also be criminal.”).
