1 did not have an alibi and suggested that a photo lineup was

2 unduly suggestive. 799 F.2d 593, (10th Cir. 1986). The court
3 stated that, if disclosed, "the defense could have

4 cross-examined the detectives about their decision to use the

5 photographs" that they did as well about their failure to

6 corroborate the other suspect's alibi.

7 And the defense cites another Brady violation in

8 Lindsey v. King where the Fifth Circuit found that a police

9 report was material under Brady because it showed key witnesses
10 to a murder had changed their story, which on cross-examination
11 would have meant the destruction of the witness's

12 identification and the discrediting in some degree of the

13 police methods employed in assembling the case against the

14 defendant. Lindsey v. King, 769 F.2d 1034, (5th Cir. 1985).

15 These two examples of focused cross-examination to

16 impeach a witness that testified to the defendant's guilt and
17 thereby throw the product of the government's investigation

18 into doubt are far afield from the specifics of what the

19 defense proposed here. In its brief, the defense seeks to
20 affirmatively -- and I will quote from their brief -- "call FBI
2l case agents as witnesses" to ask who they talked to, what
22 documents they subpoenaed, and when. See, defense's response
23 at 40. But as the Second Circuit explained in Saldarriaga, the
24 government's use or non-use of certain investigative techniques
25 does not tend to show the defendant's innocence of the charges.
