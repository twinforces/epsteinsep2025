testimony. To the contrary, the text of Rule 702 expressly contemplates that an expert may be
qualified on the basis of experience.”).

Third, in admitting Dr. Rocchio’s testimony over an objection by Ms. Maxwell similar to
the one offered here by the government, this Court said as follows:

Dr. Rocchio’s opinions speak only to concepts and will not (and indeed may not)

suggest that the jury find any alleged victim witness to be credible or to find Ms.

Maxwell guilty... . It is the jury’s role to determine whether and how Dr. Rocchio’s

opinions apply to the facts of this case and the credibility of the witnesses.
(Dkt. 435, p 10). The same logic applies to Dr. Dietz’s opinions.

Finally, the government says the Dr. Dietz’s opinions don’t “fit the facts of the case.”

conclusions by opining that experts in the field would not be “so credulous” as Dr. Rocchio is.
See Gov’t Omnibus Resp. to Maxwell Mot. in Limine, at 16; Ex. 2, p 16:11-16 (Dr. Rocchio: “In
my clinical practice, it’s not — I have to deal with what the patients tell me in the room. It’s not
my job to go out and verify any part of what’s being told in the clinical room, but, rather, to hear
what they’re telling me and then relate that back to my other skills-training experience, the
scientific literature.”). Dr. Dietz proposes to opine that Dr. Rocchio erred in assuming that her
