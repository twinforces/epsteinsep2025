Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document398 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page 23 of 52

B. Rocchio’s proposed testimony is inadmissible.

According to the government, Ms. Maxwell “does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is.a
qualified expert.” Resp. at 9. To the degree that Dr. Rocchio has the credentials of 'a potential
expert, the government.is right.

But saying that Rocchio is a “qualificd expert” is not cnough. The government must
identify what Rocchio is an expertin. Fed. R. Evid. 702; Fed. R. Crim. 16. As Ms. Maxwell
‘pointed, out in.her motion, the government.hasn’t donc that. Mot. at 2.

What’s:more, even if Rocchio is.a. “qualified expert” in. something, she:is ‘not a “qualified
expert” in, everything. (For example, the government agrees that she is not.an, expert in/the:
human. brain or memory generally. Resp. at 30 n.7.) And as cven-the. government admits,
Rocchio has 0 'experience or expertise in diagnosing, evaluating, ortreating alleged perpetrators
of sexual abuse. Resp. at: 19, 23,'26. She cannot therefore speak: to the psychology of alleged
perpetrators and their so-called “grooming techniques.”

The government,.attempts a,two-step'to get.around this problem. “By-virtue of expericnce
treating victims,” says the government, “Dr. Rocchio is nccessarily infornied about:perpetrators’
actions.” Resp. at.19.

Butihow does Rocchio know her patients were. victims of sexual abuse? ‘Because her
paticnts told her so, and Rocchio assumes they are'telling the truth. Again, Rocchio’s opinions.
are based on her'treatment of a self-selected, unrepresentative group of individuals she assumes
are telling the truth and ‘are therapeutic consumers ina financial relationship with her:

The government has:no response. to this, other than to say that Rocchio:and other
“{e]linical psychologists are not.so credulous.” Resp. at.16. If this were right, though, one would.
expect the goverriment'to explain how'clinical psychologists ensure their patients are telling the

truth. —.in other words, how clinical psychologists like Rocchio test and. verify their opinions.
