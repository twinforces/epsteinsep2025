Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document398 _ Filed 10/29/21 Page 23 of 52

B. Rocchio’s proposed testimony is inadmissible.

According to the government, Ms. Maxwell “does not contest that Dr. Rocchio is a
qualified expert.” Resp. at 9. To the degree that Dr. Rocchio has the credentials of a potential
expert, the government is right.

But saying that Rocchio is a “qualified expert” is not enough. The government must
identify what Rocchio is an expert in. Fed. R. Evid. 702; Fed. R. Crim. 16. As Ms. Maxwell
pointed out in her motion, the government hasn’t done that. Mot. at 2.

What’s more, even if Rocchio is a “qualified expert” in something, she is not a “qualified
expert” in everything. (For example, the government agrees that she is not an expert in the
human brain or memory generally. Resp. at 30 n.7.) And as even the government admits,
Rocchio has no experience or expertise in diagnosing, evaluating, or treating alleged perpetrators
of sexual abuse. Resp. at 19, 23, 26. She cannot therefore speak to the psychology of alleged
perpetrators and their so-called “grooming techniques.”

The government attempts a two-step to get around this problem. “By virtue of experience
treating victims,” says the government, “Dr. Rocchio is necessarily informed about perpetrators’
actions.” Resp. at 19.

But how does Rocchio know her patients were victims of sexual abuse? Because her
patients told her so, and Rocchio assumes they are telling the truth. Again, Rocchio’s opinions
are based on her treatment of a self-selected, unrepresentative group of individuals she assumes
are telling the truth and are therapeutic consumers in a financial relationship with her.

The government has no response to this, other than to say that Rocchio and other
“Te]linical psychologists are not so credulous.” Resp. at 16. If this were right, though, one would
expect the government to explain how clinical psychologists ensure their patients are telling the
truth — in other words, how clinical psychologists like Rocchio test and verify their opinions.
