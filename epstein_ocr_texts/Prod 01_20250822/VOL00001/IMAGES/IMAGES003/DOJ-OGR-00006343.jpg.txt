(b) the testimony is based ‘on sufficient facts or data;
(c), the testimony is the product of reliable principles and. methods; and
(d) the .expert-has reliably applicd the principles and methods to the.facts of the case.

The Court excreises.a, “gatekeeper function” in, assessing the, admissibility of expert
testimony. Restivo-v. Hessémann, 846 F.3d '547, 575 (2d. Cir. 2017). To determine whether an
‘expert’s method jis reliable, the Court considers the non-exhaustive list provided by the Supreme:
Court in. Daubert, including: whether the expert’s method has been tested, whether it has been
subjected ‘to peer revicw, the:rate of crror, standards controlling'the. method’s: operation, ‘and
whether the method ‘is accepted. by the expert,community. United States v. Kidd, 385 F. Supp. 3d.
259, 263 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 593-94).

But-Rule 702 ultimately sets a “liberal” and. “permissive” standard. of admissibility.
Nimely'yv. City of New York, 414 F.3d 381, 395-96 (2d Cir. 2005). ‘In particular, not every expert
admissible under Datbert need rely.on a:method that conforms with. “the ¢xactiiess of hard
science methodologies.” 1.4.0.G. v. Bloomberg .L.P., No. 07-CV-8383 (LAP), 201.0 WL.

II. Discussion

As a preliminary‘matter, the Défense argues that'the additional materials filed by the
Government in-support of Dr. Rocchio’s expertise should.be excluded as failing, to comply-with
the Court’s order that the Government make all expert. witness disclosures by April, 23, 202.1.
Dkt. No..250. But that Order, made pursuant to Federal.Rule of Criminal Procedure 16(a)(1.)(G),
required. only that the Government provide an adequate summary ofthe intended topics and

opinions of Dr. Rocchio’s, testimony, which the Government did. here ‘ina timely:manner. See
