Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Court required the parties to indicate whether Juror 50’s motion to intervene and to
be provided a copy of the juror’s completed questionnaire and voir dire should be redacted. Dkt.
No. 575. In response, the parties have submitted letters to the Court indicating their differing
views on whether Juror 50’s motion should be docketed at all. Upon further reflection, the Court
concludes that it must first address the threshold question of whether an inquiry is permitted
and/or required before considering Juror 50’s requests. Accordingly, the Court will not consider
or act on Juror 50’s request to intervene and to be provided a copy of the juror’s completed
questionnaire and voir dire until the Court receives the parties’ briefing on the appropriateness of
an inquiry and the nature of any such inquiry. The Court will maintain Juror 50’s motion
temporarily under seal until the Court considers the parties’ arguments and determines the
appropriate next steps.

Consistent with this and to lessen the burden on the parties and the Court, the Court
adjusts the briefing schedule as follows. Rather than separately addressing Juror 50’s motion on
January 20, 2022, see Dkt. No. 575, the parties may address the issues raised by Juror 50’s
motion in their briefing on Defendant’s anticipated motion for a new trial, on the schedule
previously set by the Court. See Dkt. No. 571.
