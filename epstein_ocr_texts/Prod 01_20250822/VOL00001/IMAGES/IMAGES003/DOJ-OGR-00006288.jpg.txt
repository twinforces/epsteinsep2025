between reports of childhood trauma and high levels of dissociation (e.g.
Sanders & Giolas, 1991). Dissociation can occur either during the trau-
matic experience (peritraumatic dissociation) or afterward (posttraumatic
dissociation). Peritraumatic dissociation is characterized by numbness,
detachment, derealization, depersonalization, and reduced responsiveness
during the traumatic event (Tichenor, Marmar, Weiss, Metzler, & Ronfeldt,
1996). A meta-analysis comparing the results of 35 empirical studies on the
relationship between levels of peritraumatic dissociation and posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) found that peritraumatic dissociation was a moderate
predictor of PTSD (Breh & Seidler, 2009).

Some psychologists have conceptualized dissociation as a coping mech-
anism in response to trauma-related stress (Gershuny & Thayer, 1999).
However, others have argued that dissociation is a trait that precedes a trau-
matic experience and may contribute to psychological responses in trauma
survivors (Tichenor et al., 1996). Whatever the case may be, dissociation
has been shown in multiple studies to be related to memory fragmentation
(Kindt, Van den Hout, & Buck, 2005; van der Kolk & Fisler, 1995) and to two
prominent correlates: fantasy proneness (Merckelbach, Campo, Hardy, &
Geisbrecht, 2005) and absentmindedness (Merckelbach, Muris, Rassin, &
Horselenberg, 2000).

In one study (Candel et al., 2003), low and high dissociators were read
stories of a traumatic nature and asked to freely recall the story. Even after
controlling for fantasy proneness, high dissociators provided more errors of
commission—that is, added false content—than low dissociators, though
the two groups did not differ on errors of omission. In another study
by Merckelbach and colleagues (Merckelbach, Horselenberg, & Schmidt,
2002), participants were read a story and asked to recall the content of
the story. They were then asked several misleading questions meant to
test suggestibility. As hypothesized, participants who were high dissocia-
tors were more likely to endorse story elements that were fabricated than
low dissociators. Also, participants who were high dissociators were also
more likely to have trait absentmindedness but were not more likely to have
fantasy proneness. Similar studies have shown a small trend toward a rela-
tionship between fantasy proneness and memory commissions (Giesbrecht,
Geraerts, & Merckelbach, 2007). The results of these studies indicate that
dissociators are capable of “remembering” events that did not happen and
that absentmindedness may be a mediator in the relationship between trau-
matic events and commission errors of memory. The results of these studies
suggest that it may be important to consider the possibility that the mem-
ory of the event may include false details if the claimant has high levels of
dissociation.

A review of the literature on dissociation and memory (Giesbrecht,
Lynn, Lillienfild, & Merckelbach, 2008) cited evidence that trait dissociation
is likely to be associated with memory distortions. In an effort to align
