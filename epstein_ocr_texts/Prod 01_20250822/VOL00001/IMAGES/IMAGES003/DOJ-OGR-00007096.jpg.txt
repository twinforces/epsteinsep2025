1 says, your Honor. I agree that these are issues that it's

2 important for the Court to be aware of before trial but I can't
3 predict, and I'm not really sure that the government can

4 predict, what their witnesses will say or suggest in their

5 actual testimony. When they open the door through fronting it,
6 it may be that they say something that suggests that there was
7 someone who believed them, that there was a victims'

8 compensation fund that believed them. If those kinds of words
9 are used by the witness, then that becomes problematic in terms
10 of our ability to be hamstrung in cross-examination that there
11 was no actual confrontation during that process. So, depending
12 upon what the witnesses say we would re-raise this but I do

13 think it's important for the Court to sort of have that in mind
14 when the government is trying to use evidence to front an issue
15 but then potentially opening the door to us being open to cross
16 on the same type of language that their witnesses used.

17 THE COURT: Ms. Moe?

18 MS. MOE: Your Honor, again, the government doesn't

19 anticipate that the testimony would come out that way but, in
20 any event, I think with respect to the specific concern defense
21 counsel has raised, to the extent it opened the door I don't
22 believe it would open the door to separate collateral issues
23 about a separate civil lawsuit and resolution of that civil
24 lawsuit.
25 THE COURT: Yes.
