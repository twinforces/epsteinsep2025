LB1 5MAX 2:

says, yolr Honor. I agreé that these dré isstes that it's
important for the Court to be aware of before trial but I can't
predict, drid I'm not really stire that 'the government cdn

predict, what their witnesses will say or suggest in their

actual, testimony. When théy open ‘the door through fronting it,

it may be that. they say something that suggests that there was

someone who believed them, that there was, a victims"

compensation fund that believed. them. If those kinds. of words
are Uséd by the witness, then ‘that becomes problématia in ‘terms
of our ability to be hamstrung in cross-examination that there
was no actual confrontatidn during that process. So, depending
upon what the witnesses say we would re-raise this but I do
think it's important for the Court to sort of have that in mind

when the government is trying to use evidence to front an issue

but then potentially 6pening the door to us béing open to cross

on, ‘the same type of language that theix witnesses used.

THE COURT: Ms. Moe?:
MS, MOE: Your Honor, again, the government, doesn,'t.

anticipate that the testimohy would come Sut that way but, in

any event, I think with respect to the specific concern defense
counsél hds rdéiséd, té the extent it spened tHe d6or I don't
believe it would open the door to separnate collateral. issues
about. a Ssépardteé Givil lawsuit and résolution of that. civil
lawsuit.

THE COURT: Yes.
