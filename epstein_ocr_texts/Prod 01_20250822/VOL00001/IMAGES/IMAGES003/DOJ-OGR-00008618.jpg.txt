1 Instruction No. 58: Punishment Not to be Considered by the Jury
Zz Under your oath as jurors, you cannot allow a consideration of possible punishment that
3 may be imposed upon a defendant, if convicted, to influence you in any way or in any sense to
4 enter into your deliberations. The duty of imposing sentence is mine and mine alone.
5 Your function is to weigh the evidence in the case and to determine whether or not the
6 Government has proved that Ms. Maxwell is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, solely upon the
7 _ basis of such evidence.
8 Therefore, I instruct you not to consider punishment or possible punishment in any way
9 in your deliberations in this case.
