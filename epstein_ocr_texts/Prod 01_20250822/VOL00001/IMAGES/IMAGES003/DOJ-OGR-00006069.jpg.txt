Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 3 of 93
Role of the Jury

Your role is to pass upon and decide the fact issues that are in the case. You, the
members of the jury, are the sole and exclusive judges of the facts. You pass upon the weight of
the evidence or lack of evidence; you determine the credibility of the witnesses; you resolve such
conflicts as there may be in the testimony; and you draw whatever reasonable inferences you
decide to draw solely based on the evidence and from the facts as you have determined them.
You must determine the facts based solely on the evidence received in this trial.

In determining the facts, you must rely upon your own recollections of the evidence.
What the lawyers have said—for instance, in opening statements, in closing arguments, in
objections, or in questions—is not evidence. You should bear in mind particularly that questions
put to witnesses, although they can provide the context to answers, are not themselves evidence.
It is only the answers that are evidence.

I remind you also that nothing I have said during the trial or will say during these
instructions is evidence. Similarly, the rulings I have made during the trial are not any indication
of my views of what your decision should be.

The evidence before you consists of the answers given by witnesses and the exhibits and
stipulations that were received into evidence. If] have sustained an objection to a question or
told you to disregard testimony, the answers given by a witness are no longer part of the
evidence and may not be considered by you. I will instruct you at the end of these charges about
your ability to request to have testimony read back and your access to other evidence admitted
during the trial.

Adapted trom the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United
States v. Jones, 16 Cr. 533 (AJN) and in United States v. Pizarro,
17 Cr. 151 (AJN).
