‘Instruction No. 31: Counts One, Three, and Five: Conspiracy to Violate Federal Laws —
‘Conspiracy and Substantive Counts.

Counts One, Three, and Five: of the Indictment cach charge. Ms. Maxwell with
participating in a “conspiracy.” The relevant statute for Counts One, Three, and. Five is Title 18,
United States Code, Section 371, which provides that “if two or more people conspire [] to

commit any.offense against:the United States . . . and one.or more: of:such persons do any-act to

effect the object of the conspiracy,” cach person is, guilty of a federal crime.

AS] will explain, a conspiracy is a kind. of criminal. partnership—an. agreement of two, or
more:people to join,together to accomplish some unlawful purpose. The crime of conspiracy to
violate: federal law:is an‘independent.offense. It is separate and distinct ‘from the actual,
violation of any specific federal laws, which.the law refcrs to as “substantive crimes.” Indeed,

you may find Ms. Maxwell guilty of conspiring to violate federal law even if you find.that the

crinic which. was the object of the conspiracy was never actually committed.

As I will explain, the three different conspiracy counts are separate offenses and cach

conspiracy alleges.a different purpose, which | will describe to you, shortly:.
