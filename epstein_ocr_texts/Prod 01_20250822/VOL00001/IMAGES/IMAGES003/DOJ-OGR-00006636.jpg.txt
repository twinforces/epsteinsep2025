prejudice pursuant to Rule 403; in addition, (4) at defendant’s request, the: district, court should
give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction. United States v. MéCalhim, 584 F.3d 471,475
(2d Cir. 2009) (citing Huddleston v. United States, 485. U.S. 681, 691-92:(1.988)). “Other act?
evidence serves ‘a, proper purpose so long’ as ‘it-1s not. offered to show. the defendant’s propensity.
to commit the offense.” Curley, 639 F.3d at 57 (citing Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)).

When.the: government must. prove a conspiracy’ charge, evidence of other acts committed
“in-furthcrance of the conspiracy” is ‘not “other act” evidence‘under Rule 404(b), but rather, it is
direct evidence ofthe. acts charged.in the Indictment. United States v. Lownsend, No. $1.06 CR.
34 (JFK), 2007 WL 1288597, at *1 (S.D.N.Y.. May 1, 2007) (citing United States-v. Concepeion,
983 F.2d 369; 392 (2d Cir. 1992)). However, “other acts” are only admissible as evidence of a
conspiracy “as long as they are within the scope of:the conspiracy.” Wnited States v. Cummings,

Evidence of uncharged conduet.is not considered other act.cvidenee under Rule:404(b)
“ifit [1] arose out:of the same transaction or serics of transactions as ‘the charged offense, [2] if it
is inextricably intertwined with the evidence regarding the.charged offense, or [3] if it is
necessary to complete the story of the crime on.trial.” United States v.. Nektaloy, 325 F. Supp. 2d
367, 370 (S.D.N.Y..2004): (quoting United States ‘v. Carboni, 204 F.3d 39,.44 (2d Cir. 2000)).

charged. crime, the proper. course is to proceed under Rule 404(b).” Townsend, 2007 WL

1288597, at *1 (citing Nektdlov, 325. F. Supp. 2d at 372).
