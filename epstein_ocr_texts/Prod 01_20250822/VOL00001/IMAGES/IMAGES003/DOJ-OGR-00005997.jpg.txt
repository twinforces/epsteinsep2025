As evidenced by their recently disclosed. interviews, the government. lawyers, despite its
‘protests about'the defense's ability to, call:percipient fact witnesses, have been preparing the case:
agents. for months to testify in:the defense's case. The:risk: highlighted. by the: defense it:its
footnote is that, cven though they:are: not asked a question that calls for opinion;testimony, the
agents arc likely’ to try'to offer their opinions cither during‘the, defense's questioning or'wheni ‘the,
government attempts to: rchabilitate them. Because neither side has: noticed any opinion
‘testimony ‘from the case agents, they should be prohibited from. offering any, cspecially because
‘it will. be non-responsive to any questions that should be asked of them.

79-80. The government offers no explanation, however, for why testimony:of an. alleged rape:
would. prove the relationship “between, the defendant, Epstein, and the victims” when[—~_ 7

facilitated, or participated in the alleged rape in anyway. ‘Nor does the government explain’why.
‘this, testimony: 1s, somehow: necessary “to complete the story of the crime on.trial” when the rape
allegation-is an. outlicr and does not fit the “story” of'alleged sexual abuse that the government
has deseribed. in the S2 Indictment—namely, “grooming” the alleged-victims to gradually break.
down their inhibitions so that forcible rape is vor required to cngage in sexual activity with them.
Because:the rape allegation is the only one of its. kind.and has no conncction-to the other
incidents of alleged sexual ‘abuse, it:should not:be admitted 'as intrinsic proof of the charged,

crimes. Seé Uitited States %. Lownsend, No. S1,.06 GR. 34 (JFK), 2007 WL 1288597, at *2
