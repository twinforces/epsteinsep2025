of the names and occupations of prospective jurors no more than five days before trial. (Dkt. No.
407, Def. Ex. A). In United States v. Daugerdas, 450 prospective jurors completed a basic
hardship questionnaire; the court excused a number of prospective jurors who had claimed
hardships on their questionnaires; the court conducted three-day voir dire; the parties exercised
peremptory challenges; and trial commenced. 867 F. Supp. 2d 445, 449-51 (S.D.N.Y. 2012).
Through the jury selection process, one juror “lied extensively during voir dire and concealed
important information about her background.” Jd. at 451. That one juror “lied extensively” during
voir dire in Daugerdas does not provide a basis for the relief sought here. Neither Kessler nor
Daugerdas stands for the proposition that a defendant has a constitutional right to conduct outside
research on jurors, much less that a certain amount of time is required to do so.

The Court has indicated that it would ensure a fair jury is selected, and the Court has
carefully crafted a juror questionnaire and voir dire process with input from the parties on the
questions asked of prospective jurors. This process will ensure that a fair jury is empaneled. The
defendant’s motion for reconsideration should be denied.

Respectfully submitted,
