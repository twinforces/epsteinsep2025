Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document565- Filed 12/19/21 Page 18 of 83
] Instruction No. 11: Multiple Counts
2 As I just explained, the Indictment contains six counts. Each count charges Ms. Maxwell
3 with a different crime. You must consider each count separately and return a separate verdict of
4 â€” guilty or not guilty for each. Whether you find Ms. Maxwell guilty or not guilty as to one
5 _ offense should not affect your verdict as to any other offense charged, unless you are instructed
6 otherwise.
7 You may only find Ms. Maxwell guilty of a particular count if the Government has
8 proven each element of the offense charged with respect to that count beyond a reasonable doubt.
