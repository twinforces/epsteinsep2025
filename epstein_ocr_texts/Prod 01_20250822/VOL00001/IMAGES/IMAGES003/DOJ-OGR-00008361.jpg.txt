Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 82 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter regarding the question whether the
pending privilege issue could be resolved by a stipulation regarding the testimony of Robert
Glassman. After considering the issue and conferring with defense counsel, the Government
remains of the view that the statement in the email is not admissible and requires additional context
for it to be understandable by the jury. (See Gov’t Letter at 7-8, Dkt. No. 528; 12/6/21 Letter from
Robert Glassman at 3-4). Accordingly, the Government would not enter into such a stipulation.
