Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 438 Filed 11/12/21 Page11of54
B. Discussion

The victims are expected to testify in explicit detail and/or be the subject of highly
sensitive and personal testimony concerning sexual abuse, most of which occurred while they
were under the age of 18. The limited protections requested by the Government are reasonable,
necessary, and narrowly tailored to protect the victimsâ€™ well-being, prevent undue
embarrassment and other adverse consequences, including loss of employment, and prevent the
victims from being harassed by the press and others.

Specifically, the Government requests that Minor Victim-1 and Minor Victim-3-
Po permitted to testify under a pseudonym. | |
