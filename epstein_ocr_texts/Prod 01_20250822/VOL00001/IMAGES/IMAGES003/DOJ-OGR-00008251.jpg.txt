1 to go back over in the voir dire and inquire about. I'm not

2 going to stick to that script exactly, I'm going to have a

5 With respect to individual places and entities, the

6 parties submitted that list to the Court last night, and what

7 we'll do is the list, as we've discussed, contains the name of
8 witnesses who I've permitted to testify under pseudonyms. So

9 we've rearranged that list so it's by letter or number, we'll
10 show the list to the prospective juror, ask them to read the

11 names, do they recognize any of those names, and if so, to

12 indicate what letter. If they indicate the letter of a witness
13 who has been granted permission to testify under pseudonym,

14 we'll discuss at sidebar and presumably sealed, so as not to

15 identify that witness. The rest, to the extent a juror has

16 knowledge of anyone on the list, it can be discussed in open

17 court. Same for the list of entities.

18 There's one inclusion on the list, I think just one,
19 which is a specific employer name that I've indicated would not
20 be discussed in open court because that would undermine the
21 protection for the witness who has been granted permission to
22 proceed by pseudonym.
23 We'll bracket that for a moment. I want to discuss
24 with the parties how I intend to handle that. But to the
25 extent that might include discussing the specific employer,
