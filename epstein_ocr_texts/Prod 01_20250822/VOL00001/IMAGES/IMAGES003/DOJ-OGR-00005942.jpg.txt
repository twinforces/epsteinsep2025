Disclosure Patterns in Child Sexual Abuse

other family issues: addressed .in-the aftermath of disclosure. and where peers
play 4n-important-role.

Studies have confirmed the importance:of professionals asking children and.
young people ina sensitive, open manner about possible experiences of abuse
using non-leading: questioning styles to minimise inaccurate accounts: or
contaminate children’s narratives. It is: clearly important for professionals to
remain open to the possibility of abuse. and further disclosure: It, is equally
important for professionals to: be able to avoid ‘persisting with questioning
those children who are:‘reluctant disclosers’. Similarly, professionals: engaged
with children in therapeutic: work need to be open ‘to the possibility: of both.
initial and ‘further-disclostires.

Contradiction in‘witness statements is a:well-Known feature of false:siatements
and giving ‘additional ‘detail to: original. formal. statements car be interpreted.
within child protection, therapeutic and legal :contexts as :a. contradiction. of an.
earlieraccount. Listéningto children’s accountsof their experiences of disclosure
helps us understand why it'is’that disclosure:can be delayed and.that;when they do
feel ready to‘tell this is not an. ‘all or:nothing’ decision, AS one: young person: ‘in,
Staller and Nelson-Gardell"s (2005) study noted,,“it’s never finished, never’ p.
1426. This understanding in turn helps us identify, those: circumstances: and.
reactions that.may’ cncourage the child to disclose.

The importance of asking children questions, ihus giving them an.
opportunity to tell, has been identified. While parents,. teachers and those in
daily contact with children are ofien reluctant: to question ‘children, it is clear
that many’ children donot disclose: unless given this opportunity. Education
and increased, ‘awareness are ‘necded on how to. question children in: an.
appropriate manner, McElvaney (2008) noted that questions did not need to
be about sexual abuse per se, but rather questions prompted by the. young
person’s: psychological distress, asking afer the young people’s wellbeing.
This: questioning in, effect acted .as an external pressure: for the ‘young ‘person
to tell his/her secret (McElvaney et al., 2012), In Ungar et al.’s (2009a) study.
of Ganadian youth, ‘they found ‘that: young people used a range. of disclosure
strategies ranging from. less direct strategies (such.as risk-taking behaviours,
not talking about: the abuse) to, direct: strategies (Such. as Sccking Support: from
peers, turning to non-professional adult supports, disclosing to formal service
prov. iders), representing a process that relied heavily on. others: to “build the
bridges ‘between the youth and formal care providers’ (p. 352).

The tendency to delay: disclosing and the partial nature of many disclosures
are not conducive ‘to: successful legal ‘Investigations and ‘presecutions. In.
addition, the knowledge base ‘that exists within. the legal sphere ‘ts limited :if
only a percentage of the children. who experience sexual ‘abuse engage with
this System. The. disproportionately high ‘immediate disclosure” tate found.
in Goedman-Brown: ef al.’s (2003) legal sample compared ‘to Kogan’s

(2004) community sample raises the question.of the representation of delayed.
diselosers in the. legal system. Are children who delay i in disclosing less likely
to engage with the legal. system? Are delays in disclosing, contributing ‘to
decisions not to prosecute child sexual abuse crimes? In Ireland; the 1990s
saw’ a. significant ‘increase in the: numbers of complainants coming before: the
courts reporting experiences: of childhood sexual ‘abuse. Many of these: cases
