Re: USA. Maxwell, No. 1:20-cr-00330-AJN
Dear Judge Nathan,

I'write on. behalf of. American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. (SABC News”) and
No. 581) and. The New York: Times, to oppose the sealing of the motion fora new: trial and
supporting exhibits filed by the Defendant.(Dkt. No..578), for-all the reasons sct forth in those
requests.

ABC News and NBC News furtherrespectfully request that Juror 50’s motion to
intervene, which according,to this Court’s prior orders (Dkt. Nos. 575 & 576) was.c-mailed.to
the ‘Court ‘and placed, under'temporary’ scal,:now be unsealed. Like the Defendant’s Motion fora
New Trial, Juror 50’s motion is,a “judicial document” to ‘which the presuniption of access under
both. the common, law: and the First Amendment applics’ because Juror.50’s motion has’ been, and
continucs, to be, highly “relevant to the: performance of the judicial function, and useful in.the
judicial-process.” U.S. v. Amadeo, 44 F. 3d 141, 145 (2d.Cir. 1995) (“Amodeo I’).
