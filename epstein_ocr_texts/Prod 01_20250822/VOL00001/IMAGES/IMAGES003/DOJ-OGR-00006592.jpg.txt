Ghislaine Maxwell moves to exclude the proposed testimony of Lisa M. Rocchio, Ph.D.,
under Federal Rules of Evidence 401, 402, 403, 404, 702, 704, and Daubert v. Merrell Dow

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT

The case against Ms. Maxwell is rife with problems. Recognizing them, the government

inconsistencies, and to vouch of the truthfulness of the accusers.

The foundation of Lisa M. Rocchio’s proposed expert testimony is so-called “grooming”
behavior. But grooming is not a widely recognized or highly predictable and verifiable
phenomena. To the contrary, “there is no valid method to assess whether grooming has occurred
or is occurring.”! What’s more, there is nothing—not a journal article, and not a study—to
validate Rocchio’s opinions on “grooming-by-proxy”—.e., that Ms. Maxwell groomed victims
not for her own benefit but for that of Jeffrey Epstein.

Rocchio’s opinions about “grooming” are entirely subjective—they are based on her
personal experience treating a self-selected group of people who claim to have been sexually

her conclusions; they have no associated error rate; they cannot be tested, verified, or
reproduced; and they “virtually impregnable for purposes of cross-examination.”” Since “expert
