1 the Indictment, if you are convinced that the act occurred while the conspiracy was still in
2 existence and that it was done in furtherance of the conspiracy as described in the Indictment. In
3 _ addition, you need not be unanimous as to which overt act you find to have been committed. It
4 is sufficient as long as all of you find that at least one overt act was committed by one of the
5 conspirators.
6 As to Counts One and Three, the Government has to prove that at least one of the overt
7 acts in furtherance of that conspiracy involved a witness other than Kate. Put simply: you may
8 not convict Ms. Maxwell on Counts One or Three solely on the basis of Kateâ€™s testimony or an
9 overt act involving Kate.
10 You are further instructed that the overt act need not have been committed at precisely
11 the time alleged in the Indictment. It is sufficient if you are convinced beyond a reasonable
12 doubt, that it occurred at or about the time and place stated.
