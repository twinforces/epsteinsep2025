1 chilling effect for any juror who, under oath, is going to have
2 to answer very personal questions, let alone to have to answer
3 those questions in a public forum with press being present and
4 other members of the public viewing this from an overflow room.
5 THE COURT: My view is we can deal with those

6 situations kind of one at a time, depending on what emerges

7 from the particular questionnaire that we're looking at at the
8 time. As an example, I have conferred with Judge Donnelly, who
9 went through similar voir dire questioning recently in the

10 Bastern District, and there was public access to the individual
11 questioning, and I think all of that was managed in a way that
12 everybody felt comfortable with.

13 I think we start with, as the law requires, as the

14 First Amendment reguires and case law requires, the presumption
15 of public access. I will take into account, as need be, any

16 specific requests for deviation in a tailored and narrow way to
17 ensure juror candor, protection of privacy, and the like.

18 That's my overall approach. I don't think we need to
19 deal with it in any broader way now, but tell me if you
20 disagree.
21 MS. STERNHEIM: I do not disagree. We do not need to
22 deal with it now. I just wanted to express our concerns on
23 that issue.
24 THE COURT: OK. Anything else, Ms. Sternheim?
25 MS. STERNHEIM: Yes. Just a moment, please?
