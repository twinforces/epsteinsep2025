chilling effect for any jtror who, wndér odth, is, going to have
tq answer very personal questions, let alone to have to answer
those questions in, a Public forum with press being present and
other members of the public viewing this from an gverflow room.
THE COURT: My view is we Gan, déal with those
Situations kind of ‘one at a time, depending on what emerges
from the particular gtiestidnnaire ‘that we're looking at at ‘the
time. As an example, I have conferred with Judge Donnelly, who
went through simttildr woir dire quéstioning recently in. the
EFastern District, and there was public access to the individual
questioning, dnd I think all 6f tHat was managed in a way that
everybody felt. comfortable with.

I think we start. with, as the law requires, as the

First Amendment requires and case law mequires, the presumption

of public aceéss. I will take into aécount, as need be; any
specific requests for deviation in, a tailored and narrow way to
ensuré juror cand6ér, protectidn of privacy, and the like.

fhat's my evernall approach. I don't think we need, to
déal with it in any broadér way n6éw,; but tell me if you
disagree.

MS; STERNHEIM: I do not. disagree. We dé hot need té
deal with it now. I just wanted to express oun concerns on
that issué.

THE COURT: OK. Anything else, Ms. Sternheim?

MS. STERNHEIM: Yes. Just a moment; please?
