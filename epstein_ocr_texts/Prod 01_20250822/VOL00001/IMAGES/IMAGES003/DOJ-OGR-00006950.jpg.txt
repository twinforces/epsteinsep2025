Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:
The Government respectfully submits this letter seeking clarification on two items from
the November 1, 2021 pretrial conference.
First, when describing the defendant’s ability to cross-examine witnesses who will be
testifying under pseudonyms, the Court explained that:
All lines of inquiry the defense outlined in its response are available without
disclosing specific names of employers or other specifically identifying
information. For example, the defense can probe the genre, nature, and trajectories
of witnesses' careers without eliciting the specific employer name, but the defense's
cross-examination should not include specifically identifying information, and
counsel must act responsibly doing so.
