(“Further research is needed into the frequency of these pathways ....”). Indeed, the article
suggests that false accusations are “somewhat rare,” accounting for two to ten percent of all rape
accusations. /d. at 101. By contrast, Dr. Rocchio’s opinions are drawn both from empirical
studies and from her forensic and clinical experience. She stated, for example, that the
“majority” of her patients delayed disclosing their abuse. Nov. 10 Tr. at 87, 151. In its response
brief, the Defense states that Dr. Dietz “has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false
allegations identified by” the article. Def. Br. at 12. But that assertion is “merely the statement
of counsel . . . unaccompanied by any citation.” Tchatat, 315 F.R.D. at 446. Dr. Dietz’s lengthy
summary of his expected pathways testimony makes no reference to his own experience. And
even if he did reference his experience, Dr. Dietz would need to explain how that experience
provides a basis for concluding that these pathways are more than rare explanations for false
accusations. See 523 IP LLC v. CureMD.Com, 48 F. Supp. 3d 600, 643 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).
Because the Defense has provided no such evidence of experience, it has failed to carry its
burden of proof under Rule 702. Daubert, 509 U.S. at 592 n.10.

Second, most, if not all, of Dr. Dietz’s opinion on false accusations falls within “the ken
of the average person,” and so is not proper expert testimony. United States v. Felder, 993 F.3d
57, 72 (2d Cir. 2021). The Court finds that jurors do not require expert testimony that, for
example, lying, intoxication, or severe personality disorders that cause hallucinations can lead to
false accusations. E.g., Doe v. Hartford Sch. Dist., No. 2:16-CV-00206, 2018 WL 1064572, at
*5 (D. Vt. Feb. 26, 2018) (excluding expert testimony that “people involved in child abuse cases
have a motive to lie”).

Dr. Rocchio’s testimony at the Daubert hearing demonstrates the point. When cross-
examined by Defense counsel, Dr. Rocchio agreed that “many reasons,” including “outright
