Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document565- Filed 12/19/21 Page 51 of 83

1 New York Penal Law, Section 130.55; (3) In or about 1996, Maxwell provided Annie with an

2 unsolicited massage in New Mexico, during which Annie was topless; (4) Between in or about

3 2001 and in or about 2002, when Carolyn was under the age of 17, Maxwell and Epstein invited

4 Carolyn to travel from Florida to a place outside of Florida with Epstein.

5 With respect to the overt acts for Count Five, the Indictment alleges as follows: (1)

6 Between in or about 2001 and in or about 2004, Epstein and Maxwell recruited Carolyn to

7 engage in sex acts with Epstein at the Palm Beach Residence, after which Epstein and, at times,

8 Maxwell provided Carolyn with hundreds of dollars in cash for each encounter. Carolyn

9 truthfully told both Epstein and Maxwell her age; (2) Between in or about 2001 and in or about
10 2004, Epstein and Maxwell both encouraged and enticed Carolyn to recruit other girls to engage
11. in paid sex acts with Epstein, which she did; (3) Between in or about 2001 and in or about 2004,
12 __Epstein's employees sent Carolyn gifts, including lingerie, from an address in the Southern
13. __- District of New York to Carolynâ€™s residence in Florida. For example, on one occasion in or about
14 October of 2002, Epstein caused a package to be sent by Federal Express from an address in
15 Manhattan to Carolyn in Florida; (4) On multiple occasions between in or about 2001 and in or
16 about 2004, Epstein, Maxwell, or one of Epstein's other employees called Carolyn to schedule an
17 appointment for Carolyn to massage Epstein. For example, in or about April of 2004 and May of
18 2004 another employee of Epstein's called Carolyn to schedule such appointments.
19 In order for the Government to satisfy this element, it is not necessary for the
20 Government to prove that Ms. Maxwell committed the overt act. It is sufficient for the
21 Government to show that any of the members of the conspiracy knowingly committed some
22 overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Further, the overt act need not be one that is alleged in
23 the Indictment. Rather, it can be any overt act that is substantially similar to those acts alleged in
