] Instruction No. 49: Defendant’s Right Not to Testify
2 The Defendant did not testify in this case. Under our Constitution, a defendant has no
3 __ obligation to testify or to present any evidence, because it is the Government’s burden to prove
4  adefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. That burden remains with the Government
5 throughout the entire trial and never shifts to a defendant. A defendant is never required to
6 prove that she is innocent.
7 You may not attach any significance to the fact that Ms. Maxwell did not testify.
8 No adverse inference against Ms. Maxwell may be drawn by you because she did not
9 take the witness stand. You may not consider this against Ms. Maxwell in any way in your

10 deliberations in the jury room.
