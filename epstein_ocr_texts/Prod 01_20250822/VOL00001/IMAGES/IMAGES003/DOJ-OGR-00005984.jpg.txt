along these lines, that will open the door to other sexual behavior evidence. That
door can remain at least partially closed if Rocchio is not permitted to offer her
irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial testimony.

e The government still hasn’t explained how it helps the jury to be told that a victim
of sexual abuse might make an immediate disclosure, or she might make an
incremental disclosure, or she might make a delayed disclosure. Resp. at 27-30.
And when the government says, “[s]exual abuse also impacts the way memory is

There is ample reason for this Court to exclude Rocchio’s testimony outright. At the very

much. In a footnote, the government acknowledges the decision in United States v. Raniere, in
which Judge Garaufis ordered a Daubert hearing on the government’s proposed expert testimony
on grooming. 2019 WL 2212639, at *7-8. In that case, however, the government withdrew its
endorsement rather than submit to an Daubert hearing. Resp. at 19 n.3.

about grooming, “that [did] not make Dr. Hughes’s opinion about grooming techniques reliable
under the Daubert standard,” if only because “her extensive academic and clinical experience
appears focused on victims of sexual abuse, not perpetrators.” See id. at *7. The same is true
here, particularly because Rocchio has no experience in, and there is no authority supporting her
opinions on, grooming-by-proxy. Quite the contrary. The government’s late-breaking disclosure
