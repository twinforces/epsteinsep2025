Proceedings

alléged victims are being withheld from the public and the
press to protect the privacy of those individuals. I have

therefore instructed the parties to refer to those individuals

to the Govérnmént, the defendant, and to the Court.

You may also have noticed that. the witness was

asking the Government. whether she should say the last names of

certain ‘individuals. Going forward, the witnesses will
recéivé a list of the individuals whose last names aré to be
protected to which they may refer while testifying.
Anything else you want me to put in there?
MS. PENZA: Not, from the Government Your Honor.
THE COURT: You object?
MR. AGNIFILO: I do, Judge.
THE COURT: Your objection is noted.

Also, I'm going to direct that. the parties shall not

make any speaking objections. If the basis for an objection
is not apparent, the parties may request a sidebar.

MR. AGNIFILO: Very good. Thank. you, Judge.

THE COURT: Okay, what else?

MS. PENZA: Nothing ‘else from the Government, but we

would just ask for five minutes to make sure that the list is

correct for the current witness.

THE COURT: All right, we'll take a five-minute
