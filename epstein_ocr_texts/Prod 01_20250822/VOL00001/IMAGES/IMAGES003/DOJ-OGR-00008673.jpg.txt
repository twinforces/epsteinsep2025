Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document563_ Filed 12/18/21 Page 135 of 167

1 Instruction No. 37: Counts One, Three, and Five: Conspiracy to Violate Federal Law —

2 Fourth Element

3 The fourth, and final, element which the Government must prove beyond a reasonable

4 doubt is that the overt act was committed for the purpose of carrying out the unlawful agreement.

5 In order for the Government to satisfy this element, it must prove, beyond a reasonable

6 doubt, that at least one overt act was knowingly and willfully done, by at least one conspirator, in

7 ~ furtherance of some object or purpose of the conspiracy, as charged in the Indictment. In this

8 regard, you should bear in mind that the overt act, standing alone, may be an innocent, lawful

9 act. Frequently, however, an apparently innocent act sheds its harmless character if it is a step in
10 carrying out, promoting, aiding or assisting the conspiratorial scheme. You are therefore
11 instructed that the overt act does not have to be an act which, in and of itself is criminal or
12 _ constitutes an objective of the conspiracy.
