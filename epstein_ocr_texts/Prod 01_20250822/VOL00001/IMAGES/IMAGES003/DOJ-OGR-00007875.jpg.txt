1 Your Honor, Mr. Pagliuca has a hearing in Colorado.

2 Would it be permissible for him not to appear at the final

3 pretrial conference? Ms. Menninger, Mr. Everdell, and I will

4 be present.

5) THE COURT: That's fine with me.

6 MS. STERNHEIM: Thank you.

7 THE COURT: And I do plan to put out a logistics order
8 after today that confirms the details of the conferences I've

9 just discussed and rooms and the like.

10 Do the parties have any other logistical matters or

11 questions to raise before we return to the motions?

12 MS. POMERANTZ: No, your Honor.

13 MS. STERNHEIM: No. Thank you.

14 THE COURT: OK. So we can proceed to the Daubert with
15 respect to the government's proposed expert. Ms. Pomerantz.

17 Dr. Lisa Rocchio.

18 THE COURT: I didn't catch -- I have been saying row
19 "Rodocchio" in my head, but it sounds like that's not right.
20 Could you say the name again?

23 And I will ask everyone, please speak into the
