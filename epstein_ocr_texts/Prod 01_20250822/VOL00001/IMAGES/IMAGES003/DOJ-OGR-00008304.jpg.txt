particularly high.” United States v. Al-Moayad, 545 F.3d 139, 172 (2d Cir. 2008). It does not
require ruling out “all possibilities inconsistent with authenticity,” or “prov[ing] beyond any
doubt that the evidence is what it purports to be.” United States v. Dhinsa, 243 F.3d 635, 658
(2d Cir. 2001). Rather, all that is required is “sufficient proof... so that a reasonable juror could
find in favor of authenticity or identification.” Jd. This “minimal” standard can be satisfied by
the “testimony of a witness with knowledge that a matter is what it is claimed to be.” United
States v. Gagliardi, 506 F.3d 140, 151 (2d Cir. 2007). Once this “minimal” standard is met, “the
other party then remains free to challenge the reliability of the evidence, to minimize its
importance, or to argue alternative interpretations of its meaning, but these and similar other
challenges go to the weight of the evidence—not to its admissibility.” United States v. Tin Yat
Chin, 371 F.3d 31, 38 (2d Cir. 2004).

Federal Rule of Evidence 801 defines “hearsay” as ‘“‘a statement that a party offers in
evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.” Fed. R. Evid. 801(c)(2).
