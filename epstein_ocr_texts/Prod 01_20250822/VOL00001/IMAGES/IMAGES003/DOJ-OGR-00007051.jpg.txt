Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

I write to inform the Court of the recurring problem regarding late delivery of mail by the
government to Ms. Maxwell at the MDC. Today, November 15, Ms. Maxwell received
disclosures from the government under cover letter dated November 6. This is an excessively
long delay, especially since trial commences in two weeks. Please direct the government to send
disclosures to Ms. Maxwell via Federal Express Next Day Delivery on the same day they are
provided to counsel and to provide tracking information to counsel.

Your assistance in resolving this persistent problem is greatly appreciated.
Very truly yours,
/s/
BOBBI C. STERNHEIM
