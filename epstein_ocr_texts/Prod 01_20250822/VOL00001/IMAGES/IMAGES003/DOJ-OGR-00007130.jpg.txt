1 So on trafficking, the government would seek to have

2 this testimony as direct evidence with respect to the

3 trafficking count, because the individual of legal age in all

4 relevant jurisdictions was under the age of 18. You're going

a to have to spell it out for me.

6 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. If the defense were to

7 argue that the defendant didn't know that victims with respect
8 to the trafficking count were under the age of 18 or wouldn't

9 have done this if they were under 18 or that she did not know
10 that Epstein had a preference for underage girls or his

11 sexualized massages were with girls under the age of 18, this
12 would certainly speak to that issue.

13 In particular, if the defendant were to argue that she
14 didn't know that the massages she was arranging were

15 sexualized, I think the testimony of the victim speaking to

16 that issue would certainly make that all the more relevant.

17 THE COURT: Right. Okay. I'm not sure the government
18 had previously argued this constituted direct evidence of the
19 trafficking count, is that right?
20 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I would have to review our
al briefing. I believe we said that it was direct evidence of the
22 charged crimes. I apologize if we were vague about that, but
23 our view is the entire course of conduct speaks to the
24 defendant's role and knowledge, and the proof here is mutually
25 sufficient.
