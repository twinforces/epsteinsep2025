LB1LTMAX3:

So on trafficking, the government would seek to have

this testimony as direct evidence with respect to the

trafficking count, becdtsé the individual of légal agé in all.
relevant jurisdictions was under the age of 18. You're going

to have to spell Tt otit for mé.

MS, MOE: Yes, your Honor. If the defense were to

argué ‘that the défendant didn't know that Victims, with respect

te the trafficking count were under the age of 18 or wouldn't

have done this if ‘they were under 18 or that SHe did not know

that Epstein had a preference for underage girls or his
sexudlized massages were with girls under the age of 18, this
would certainly speak ‘to that. issue.

In particular, if the defendant were to argue that she
didn't know that, the massages she was arranging were
sexudlized, TI think the testimohy of the vittim speaking to

that. issue would certainly make that all the jimore melevant.

THE COURT: Right. Okay. I'm nét sure the governnient

had, previously argued this constituted direct. evidence of ‘the
trafficking count, is that right?
MS. MOE: Your Honor, I would have to review our

briefing. I believe we said that. it was diréct svidénce 6f tHe

charged, crimes. I apologize if we were vague about that, but.
Our view is the entire course of Gonduct speaks to the
defendant,'s role and knowledge, and the proof here is mutually
sufficient.
