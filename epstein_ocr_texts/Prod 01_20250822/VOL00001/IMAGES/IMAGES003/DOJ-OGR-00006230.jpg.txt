parties can.arguc’in closing arguments.” deWity. UPS Ground Ereight, Inc., No. 16 Civ. 36,2017
WL 5905575, at *2:(N.D. FI. Jul. 25, 2017). (citations and internal. quotation marks omitted). So
too here.?

The defense’s offer of ‘Dr. Dictz’s opinions om hindsight bias to “temper” the jurors’
assessment of the. evidence. is ‘thus, vittually°unpreecdented. If this. Court! allowed such téstimony

3. Opinions as to the “Halo Effect”

Dr: Dictz’s opinions concerning the “Halo cffcet”—i.c., that. “the positive cvaluation of
one, characteristic has a radiating, cffect‘on how other, non-related ‘characteristics, of the individual.
arc 'evaluated” (Ex. A, at 5)—are irrelevant to any issuc to’be considered by the jury and appear to
be offered ‘in, an cffort.-to encourage jury nullification by engendering sympathy: for the defendant,
as well as: to offer a factual narrative based on.no reliable evidence. through..a. witness. plainly.
incompetent:to do so.

None of the chargés in this case relate: in any way to'the defendant’s appraisal of Jeffrey
Epstcin’s character or whether the defendant did. or did not. view him in-the manner suggested. by:
the Halo effect. Simply ‘put, if every word. that Dr. Dietz said regarding the “Halo effect” and.
Epstein’s “brilliance” in exploiting it'were taken as truc, the deferidant ‘would be guilty if she met’

the elements of the:charged offenses—exactly as she would be if every word:Dr. Dictz said:on this

> Accordingly, even if the defense sonichow ‘put at issue whether a'witness’s opinion on some
‘matter'was' affected. by hindsight bias—and the Government cannot currently chvision how this. is
likely—the proper way of litigating an issuc so squarely within the ken of the jury:is through lay:
evidence and.argument, not expert testimony. See:deWit, 201,7 WL 5905575, at: *2. oe
