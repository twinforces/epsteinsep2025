Pathways to False Allegations 103

For the purposes of our paper, we will define the term false allegations
as either knowingly fabricated or claims based on abnormal information
processing, because in some cases, the claimant may actually believe that
a coerced sexual experience occurred in ways that it did not occur. In this
paper, we suggest that some psychological disorders may increase the like-
lihood of believing a sexual assault occurred when it did not. Additionally,
some psychological disorders may be related to an increase in motivation to
fabricate an allegation of sexual assault in an effort to achieve what may be
believed are the positive consequences of a false report.

PATHWAYS TO FALSE ACCUSATIONS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT
The pathways introduced in this section require further empirical inves-
tigation and validation. These may not be an exhaustive list of possible
pathways, although many pathways worth careful consideration have been
included.

Lying for Conscious and Unconscious Secondary Gain
That the alleged victim is knowingly making a false claim of sexual assault is
a pathway that is usually considered, and sometimes this is the only pathway
considered by key individuals in the case. Humans do lie, and their lies can
be difficult to detect. Often, humans lie because of what they perceive as
the favorable consequences for lying; for sexual assault these consequences
could be
1. the severe negative consequences that the alleged perpetrator
experiences,
2. secondary gain from victim status,
3. excusing behaviors or characteristics of the alleged victim (e.g., sexual
activity, pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases), and
4, financial gain.

In sections below, we consider lying that comes out of other psychi-
atric diagnoses (e.g., the chronic lying associated with an individual with
antisocial personality disorder). In this pathway, we acknowledge that lying
also occurs with “normal” individuals G.e., individuals who have no psychi-
atric diagnosis, who seek certain consequences through their lying). Thus,
the victim knowingly lying about the assault is a rather obvious pathway to
false allegations. Deception is difficult to detect, but the alleged victim’s his-
tory of truthfulness, current motivations, and gain from the allegations need
to be considered.
