ARGUMENT

The government, “‘as'the proponent of this evidence, bears the burden of showing that the
evidence is admissible.” Pinero v. Burbran, No. .18-CV=4698 (AJN), 202.1 WL 4224727, at *3:
(S.D.N.Y. Sept. 16,2021) (quotation omitted). -In turn, under Rule 901(a), “To satisfy: the
requirement of authenticating or identifying an, item of evidence, the proponent, must. produce
evidence sufficient to support a finding that. the item is what the ‘proponent claims it is.” Fed. R.
Evid. 90.1(a). If authenticated, the proponent of:the evidence:must also prove that'the evidence: is
relevant and-not unfairly prejudicial, or: misleading. Fed. R. Evid. 401, 402, 403.

“A picture may’... be:inadmissible, although; technically accurate, because it portrays a
States v; Siearns, 550 F.2d 1167,1170 (9th. Cir. 1977). And when a “photograph fails to-portray.
the relevant facts with complcte:accuracy,, such. as: if changed ‘conditions have ‘occurred, it may be
misleading.” § 215. Photographs, 2. McCormick on.Evid. § 215: (8th ed.).”

The government has ‘not met its burden of proof here. The charged conspiracy. ended iti

2004. And Jane claims she:was at Mr. Epstcin’s New York apartment in 1994 or 1995-or 1996.

* The government relics on just two cases to, support its argument: United States ¥.
Certified Env. Services, Iné., 753 F.3d 72 (2d Cit. 2014) and United States». Rott, 715 F.3d.
1019.(7th Cir. 2013). Gov. Letter at 2. Neither case addresses photographs of real. or personal
property, and neither responds to this Court’s concerns about the passage of time and.changed
cireumstanecs.

Certified. Environmental Services dealt with emails and Code Rule guidatice, 753 F.3d at
89-91, and.Rouwx addressed other act evidence, 71'5 F.3d.at: 1027. Both cases addressed. evidence:
relevant to the defendant’s state of mind. Most.importantly, the existence ofthe evidenceis what
made jt relevant, and no one: disputed authentication. The cases have no relevance here.
