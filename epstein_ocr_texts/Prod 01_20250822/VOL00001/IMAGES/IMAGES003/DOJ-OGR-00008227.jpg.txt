As for the ‘massage room, Jane said that it was “painted dark, but:— maybe’that; was the.
lighting, but:it-sort.of has this, like, ted mood.” /d. at 320:21-23. But Jane. denied looking at the
floor, ifnot-what was going on.”).

This: Court.sustained Ms. Maxwell’s objection.to admission of'the 900 scrics
photographs. TR. 12/3/2021, p 1077:3-4. The Court explained-that the photos depicted:-the
interior of the home fifteen ‘years after any conspiracy ended, and more than twenty years after
Jane claims to have been in the home. And. the things depicted, elaborated the Court, were
“highly;mobile items’:

‘You could. have, and you should havc, shown them to [Jane] after she. provided 'the.
testimony. The: problem. is, it’s ‘(15 years since the end ofthe: conspiracy, it’s 20-
some-years:since her testimony. I’ve looked at casc law on,this. Older photographs:
of immovable objects and structure may be relevant, and to the extent ‘you. have a.
witness testifying saying itis similar to'what I saw’ or. ‘specifically. saying it’s similar
in this way or dissimilar in that Way, it would be permitted.

In, the absence of that, we’re talking about ‘very movable: items and a
substantially long-period of time. If there is:a witness who could do that, that' would,
be appropriate, but ‘in the absence! of that, | won’t allow it in simply: based. on her
description of what, it, looked like then.

You have that. description in, so I'll, sustain, the objection, based. on, the
current record.

So if-you wanted.to.ask:her if it’s the same objects, ‘you:should-have, or you
could have, or-you can, but in‘the absenec of that, we’ re talking about: ‘highly mobile
items. The law’ does not support inclusion. : in . this context + without a. witness
photos show what : It ‘looked: like then. You have a witness who ‘can. do that, but:in
the absence ofthat, I’m:sustaining the objection. I don’t see-any: basis'to distinguish
between 15-, 20-year-old, or more, distinction. between her description and. the
photographs.

Id. at 1076-77.
