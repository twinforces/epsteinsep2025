As for the massage room, Jane said that it was “painted dark, but — maybe that was the
lighting, but it sort of has this, like, red mood.” /d. at 320:21-23. But Jane denied looking at the
walls of the massage room. /d. at 321:1-2 (“My eyes didn’t even look at the walls, mostly the
floor, if not what was going on.’”’).

This Court sustained Ms. Maxwell’s objection to admission of the 900 series
photographs. TR 12/3/2021, p 1077:3-4. The Court explained that the photos depicted the
interior of the home fifteen years after any conspiracy ended, and more than twenty years after
Jane claims to have been in the home. And the things depicted, elaborated the Court, were
“highly mobile items”:

You could have, and you should have, shown them to [Jane] after she provided the

testimony. The problem is, it’s 15 years since the end of the conspiracy, it’s 20-

some years since her testimony. I’ve looked at case law on this. Older photographs

of immovable objects and structure may be relevant, and to the extent you have a

witness testifying saying it is similar to what I saw or specifically saying it’s similar

in this way or dissimilar in that way, it would be permitted.

In the absence of that, we’re talking about very movable items and a
substantially long period of time. If there is a witness who could do that, that would
be appropriate, but in the absence of that, I won’t allow it in simply based on her
description of what it looked like then.

You have that description in, so I’ll sustain the objection based on the
current record.

So if you wanted to ask her if it’s the same objects, you should have, or you
could have, or you can, but in the absence of that, we’re talking about highly mobile
items. The law does not support inclusion in this context without a witness
testifying as to the similarity of what -- you’re trying to corroborate that these
photos show what it looked like then. You have a witness who can do that, but in
the absence of that, I’m sustaining the objection. I don’t see any basis to distinguish
between 15-, 20-year-old, or more, distinction between her description and the
photographs.
