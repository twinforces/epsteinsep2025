a pre-trial hearing at which the government must demonstrate that the proposed evidence is both
authentic, admissible, relevant and not unduly prejudicial.

B. Government Exhibit 52

Government Exhibit (GX) 52 was acquired by the government as part of a sting operation
from Alfredo Rodriguez. Mr. Rodriquez worked for Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six
months, from late 2004 to early 2005. In 2009, he was deposed and then ultimately arrested in an
undercover sting operation in which the government claims exhibit 52 was seized from Mr.
Rodriguez, apparently on or about November 3, 2009, by onc . who is not listed
as a testifying witness. No one knows where or when the exhibit was acquired by Mr.
Rodriguez, what he did with it for as long as he had it, who may have created the exhibit, and
where it came from. In its Response, the government does not identify what it claims this exhibit
to be, who might authenticate the exhibit, only that a “witness with personal knowledge of the
physical book is expected to testify to its authenticity.” Resp. at 73. Given that Mr. Rodriguez is
dead, and J is not a witness, we are left to wonder who this foundational witness may
be.

The government further claims that even if the exhibit is hearsay, it is admissible, not for
the truth of the matter asserted, but to show “the defendant kept contact information for relevant
individuals at trial, including victims.” /d. These are bold, unexplained claims that Ms. Maxwell

Again, the government claims that it will have live witnesses “to establish the
authenticity of the evidence at trial.” It does not identify the witness or the basis of that person's
