1 THE COURT: Thank you.

2 Can I ask the government, if you have a substantial

3 production, let's say over 50 pages of documents to review, can
4 the government have those hand-delivered to the facility?

5 MS. MOE: No, your Honor.

6 Respectfully, that is extremely resource intensive, it
7 requires asking either a member of the prosecution team or

8 their colleagues who are also working on cases to, instead of

9 pursuing law enforcement activities or preparing for trial,

10 spend the day driving to the MDC to hand deliver a drive to the
11 defendant personally which is a remedy that I'm not aware of

12 being implemented in any other case and would be sort of an

13 extraordinary step for this defendant that would be out of step
14 with the ordinary practice.

15 THE COURT: We are a month away from trial but if we
16 are a few days away from trial and suddenly the government has
17 a substantial production of material for some reason, 50 pages,
18 a hundred pages, would the government take those steps?

19 MS. MOE: Your Honor, without having a sense of what
20 those materials are, what their sensitivities are, whether it
21 is sort of a relevant matter that we are producing in an
22 abundance of caution or something that is sensitive that is
23 urgent that is hard to troubleshoot that issue in advance but
24 we are mindful of Court's concern and that, even as we approach
25 trial, that the issue of timing is of particular concern and so
