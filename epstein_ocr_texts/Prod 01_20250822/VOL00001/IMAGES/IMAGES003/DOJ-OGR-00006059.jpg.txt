the effects of sleep deprivation on cognitive functioning, “sleep deprivation result[s] in a loss of
cognitive flexibility through feedback...sleep deprivation causes a fundamental problem with
dynamic attentional control.” 4

Ms. Maxwell’s ability to cope with the stress of her legal proceedings and to participate
meaningfully in her defense have been gradually eroded over time due to the conditions of her
confinement and are further exacerbated by ongoing sleep deprivation. The conditions of her
confinement are seriously impacting her overall mental and physical health which will continue
to worsen over time if she remains incarcerated under the current conditions and subject to the
regiment on trial — sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, exposure to cold temperature, daily
humiliation. If she were released, her ongoing symptoms which will be exacerbated during trial
would likely resolve completely, and she would be afforded the opportunity to properly prepare
her defense for trial and endure the rigor of each trial day.

Ms. Maxwell is not a flight risk. The government concedes she poses no risk to the
community. She is a mature adult with no prior history of criminal or violent behavior. She has
steadfastly proclaimed her innocence, has maintained a strong desire to fight the case against her
and is determined to fight her charges at trial and clear her name. There is no indication that she
would attempt to flee given her personality profile and determination to be exonerated.

The bi-weekly teams of guards rotated in from high-security BOP facilities have reported
to Ms. Maxwell that they are informed that she is a security and suicide risk, which heightens
their vigilance and contempt. Like the assertion that she is a flight risk, alleging she is a suicide
risk is a total fiction. Recently, a senior staff person at the MDC stated, in substance: “The
problem we have with Ms. Maxwell is simple: she’s not a criminal.”
