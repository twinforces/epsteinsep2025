Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document516 Filed 11/21/21 Page3of17
The Government instead objects to the reliability of his methods, the fit of his opinions to this
case, and the risk of Rule 403 prejudice. The Court will deny in part and grant in part the
Government’s motion as to Dr. Dietz.

To start, several of Dr. Dietz’s opinions criticize the basis of Dr. Rocchio’s grooming
opinion. First, he states that “grooming has no consistent definition” and that “there is no valid
method to assess whether grooming has occurred.” Notice at 4. The Government agrees that
this opinion is relevant to respond to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony and is otherwise admissible.

Gov’t Br. at 9. The Court agrees.

Second, Dr. Dietz states that studies of grooming have “no known error rate” and “cannot
be tested” because they rely on the reports of alleged victims. Notice at 4. The Government
does not expressly respond to this opinion except to say that Dr. Dietz’s and Dr. Loftus’s
opinions similarly lack error rates. Gov’t Br. at 36. The Court concludes that this criticism of
Dr. Rocchio’s grooming opinion is relevant and admissible.

Third, Dr. Dietz would provide several opinions about the relationship between grooming
and intent. He states that the term grooming “imputes motive and intent without adequate
evidence of either,” that it “imput[es] motive and intent to the Defendant,” that “there is
considerable risk of misleading the fact finder in believing that” innocent conduct is grooming,
and that a determination of grooming is a “subjective judgment.” Notice at 3-4. The
Government argues that these opinions are inadmissible because it is the jury’s role to determine
the Defendant’s intent. Gov’t Br. at 10-11. Rule 704(b) “expressly forbids opinion testimony
by an expert as to the state of mind of a defendant in a criminal case where that mental state is an
element of the crime.” United States v. Rea, 958 F.2d 1206, 1215 (2d Cir. 1992) (citing Fed. R.
Evid. 704(b)).
