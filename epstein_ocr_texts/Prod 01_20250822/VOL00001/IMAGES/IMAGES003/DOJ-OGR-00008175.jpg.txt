Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document516 Filed 11/21/21 Page 3of17

The Government instcad. objects to the ‘reliability. of his methods, the fit-of his opinions to this
case, andthe risk of Rule 403 prejudice. The Court will deny in'part and grant in part the
Government’s:motion as'to Dr. Dictz.

To start, several, of Dr. Dictz.s opinions eriticize the basis of Dr. Rocchio’s grooming
opinion. First, he states ‘that.““grooming has no, consistent definition” and ‘that. “there is no, valid
method :to assess whether grooming has occurred.” ‘Notice at 4. The Government agrees that
‘this opinion is relevant to respond to Dr. Rocchio’s, testimony and is otherwise admissible.

Gov't Br. at 9. The Court agrees.

Second, ‘Dr. Dietz:states that, studies of grooming have “no known error:rate” and. “cannot,
be'tested” because they rely on the:reports of alleged victims. Notice at 4. The Government
does not expressly respond to this.opinion except to say that Dr. Dictz’s and Dr. Loftus’s
opinions'similarly lack error rates: Gov’t:Br. at 36; The Court concludes that this criticism of
Dr. Rocehio’s grooming opinion.is relevant and.admissible.

Third, Dr. Dictz would provide several opinions about the relationship between ‘grooming
and.intent. He states that the term grooming “imputcs motive and intent: without adequate
evidence of'cither,” that it “imput[es] motive and intent.to the Defendant,” that “there is
considerable risk of misleading the fact finder in believing that” innocent, conduct is. grooming,
and that.a determination of grooming 1s.a “subjective judgment.” Notice at 3-4. The
Government argues that these opinions are inadmissible because it is the jury’s role to determine
the Defendant’s intent. ‘Gov’t; Br. at 10-11. Rule 704(b) “expressly forbids opinion testimony
by an. cxpert as to, the state of mind of a-defendant in a criminal, case where. that mental state is an,
‘element: of the crime.” United States v. Rea, 958 F.2d 1206, 1215 (2d-Cir. 1992) (citing’Fed. R.

Evid. '704(b)).
