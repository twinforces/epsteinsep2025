Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 424 _ Filed 11/08/21 Page 21o0f41

Compounding the improper‘nature of this testimony, the defense appears to seck: to use Dr.
Dictz to, opine: as ‘toa Complex factual narrative ‘that. no reliable ‘process of psychiatric: evaluation
could produce. Dr. Dictz is not remotely competent to opine that Epstein would “surround himself
with people who would serve his needs” (Ex. A at 6), or that:he, was able to “use his. brilliance, to
manipulate people to do his bidding” or “compartmentalize, people into isolated cclls in ‘whieh.
none had.complete information about his activities” (id. at 7-8). Dr. ‘Dictz;has absolutely no basis
‘to make such broad. and sweeping factual. claims, about: Epstcin or his relationships ‘with anyone,
much less anyone in this:casc. .It appears that Dr. Dictz has: reached. his. conclusions based. solely:
on onc interview of Epstein with Steve Bannon in-which Epstein “acknowledged that he gravitated.
to people of power” (Ex. A at 6) and some case documents exchanged, in discovery (Def. Expert.
Notice Ex. G, attached as-Exhibit-B). This “evidence” does not even support the point—it suggests
that Epstein, looked to the: halos of others, not that he generated one: himself. And.it-is no basis, at:
all, for Dr. Dict7 to suggest to the jury that anyone involved. in this case did anything because of
Epstcin’s “halo.”*

This factual narration of Epstcin’s life and apparently the lives of other people: who
interacted with him, a defense summation based. on a:nullification defense ‘masqucrading as an.
expert witness opinion, is not based on any competent evidence; and ‘in, any’ event is patently not.

the product. of reliable psychiatric: methods reliably applied to'this case. See, &.g., Island Intell.

* This would.not'be the first:unreliable factual claim,made by Dr. Dictz,-whortestificd in,a previous
criminal.case that:a,defendant got the idea, of drowning her children in the bathtub from.anm episode
of Law: &. Order in which a defendant. did so'and was acquitted on an ‘insanity: defense, ‘when in
facet no such episode existed. See generally é.g., Barnette ¥. United States, No. 12. Civ. 327,.2021
WL ‘949848, *9-10 (W.D.N.C. March 12,2021). This led to the reversal of the trial conviction of
the defendant in that case. See: Yaies:-y, State, 171, S:W.3d.215, 222 (Tex. App. 2005).
