Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter in further opposition to the defense motion
to exclude evidence of Minor Victim-3 (Dkt. No. 387), and as discussed at the conference on
November 1, 2021. As set forth in greater detail below, the testimony of Minor Victim-3 is direct
evidence of the offenses charged in the Second Superseding Indictment (the “Indictment’”) and, at
a minimum, admissible under multiple bases enumerated in Rule 404(b). !

I. Factual Background

The Government expects Minor Victim-3 to testify, in substance and in part, that she met
the defendant in or about 1994, when she was approximately 17 years old. (|  ti(iéi*@d
' The Government moves to file a redacted version of this letter. The proposed redactions are
consistent with the three-part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of
Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). Although this letter is a judicial document subject to the
common law presumption of access, the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the
privacy interests of Minor Victim-3, who has not been publicly identified, and who is a subject of
the Court’s order granting the motion to let certain victims and witnesses testify under
pseudonyms.
