Defense position:

In light of the Court’s ruling on the government’s motion in limine, the defense will accept
the government’s proposed nomenclature for the witnesses referenced above. The defense has no
objection to the procedures proposed by the government for voir dire and for sealing and redacting
exhibits on the understanding that the defense will have the opportunity to object to particular
sealing and redaction requests. The defense also proposes the following limiting instruction in
place of the government’s proposed instruction:

This case has received, and will continue to receive, significant attention in the

media. To minimize the inconvenience and potential harassment of any witness, the

Court has permitted witnesses, if they choose, to be referred to by either their first

name or a pseudonym. However, the full names of the witnesses are known to the

Government, the defendant, and to the Court, and were shown to you during jury

selection. This process should not bear in any way on your evaluation of the

evidence in this case.
Respectfully submitted,
DAMIAN WILLIAMS
