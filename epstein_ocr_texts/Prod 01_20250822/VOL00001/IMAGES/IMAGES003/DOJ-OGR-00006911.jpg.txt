404(b) (id. at-46-47), (3) her evidence is “intrinsic” proof of the charged conspiracics.and
necessary to “complete the story” of the charged offenses (id. at:47-49), and (4)[7_]
[(______] was-under the: age of..18, the age of consent under federal. law, when the alleged.sexual
‘abuse took’place, and, that; 1s “all that is ‘required for evidence relating to the defendant’s
exploitation. of Miior Victim-3 to be direct-evideneée of the charged offenses” (id. at 50). The

circumvent Rule 404(b) by alleging “other act” evidence in the indictment. The third overlooks
the numerous preeedents in this Circuit finding that evidence of criminal offenses that are
separate and distinct from. the charged offenses are: not admissible as direct evidence of a
conspiracy. And the fourth completcly misstates the law. These arguments should be: rejected.

including “grooming” the accusers, ‘encouraging them to give massages to Epstein, and. asking

But “pattern” is just another word for “modus operandi,” which alongwith “intent” arc bases for
admission under Rule 404(b), not,as direct evidence of the conspiracies. See Fed. R. Evid.
