PB Hence, even if we assume for the sake of argument that everything Accuser-3 told the
government is true (which we do not concede), her testimony would not in any way establish that
“minors who gave sexualized massages to Epstein were compensated.” Accuser-3, quite simply,
was not under the age of eighteen and was therefore not a minor (under any relevant federal or
state statute) when she allegedly TT Second, as a factual matter, the
government is talking out of both sides of its mouth. The government cannot offer Accuser-3’s
testimony as proof of a sex trafficking conspiracy when fC
Co Accuser-3’s own statements therefore
eliminate any basis for the admission of her testimony as direct evidence of Count Five.
As to the issue of Epstein’s sexual attraction to young women, the government is once
again impermissibly attempting to use an example of entirely legal conduct as proof of a
conspiracy to engage in illegal conduct. Accuser-3’s evidence does not show that Epstein was
attracted to underage girls. At most, it shows that he was attracted to young women above the age
of consent, which is neither a crime nor evidence ofa crime. The Court recognized this distinction
at the November | conference in the discussion of Accuser-3’s evidence:
MS. MOE: ... I think as a matter of common sense, a jury
understanding that the defendant is willing to provide Epstein with
a girl at the age of 17 would certainly speak to her knowledge of
his sexual preferences.
THE COURT: Why doesn't it speak to a knowledge of sexual
preferences to someone just above the age of consent?
