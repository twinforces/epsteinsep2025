charged. in the S2 indictment.”), and Order at'3, Dkt. No. 335: (following the above sentence with,
“In. light of the interests discusséd above . . . the Court.will:require the Government.to disclose the
identities of any unnamed.co-conspirators . . . .”).

The defense ‘also argues; that failure to provide an index, of: co-conspirator statements
permits “the presentation. of' false. testimony” and. is “an. invitation to manufacture :evidenec,”
argument is, nonsensical and offensive. It-is decply: ‘unfortunate that defense counsel ‘would so
casually: ‘resort ‘to bascless allegations that the Government would. manufacture. evidence: and
present false testimony at trial. And in any’cvent, the Government;produccd.to the defense Jencks
Act material Containing co-conspirator staterients in its possession on October ‘1! and will
continue to make Jencks Act: productions as it prepares for trial. To the extent the defense is
concerned. that a.witness. will say:something on‘the stand for the first;time,'the Government cannot.
disclose that:in. advance becalse:no lawycr'can.know a witness’s verbatim answer in advanéc. But.

© The defendant’s motion, also makes the puzzling argument, that co-conspirator statements are
problematic.in this case because the defense is limited in.its ability to call.co-conspirators to testify
as defense witnesses. (Def. Mot. | at 4). That.is truc in essentially every criminal case, as the
Court has previously noted. (Sée Op. & Order at. 17-18, Dkt.'No. 207 (“There aré also scrious
doubts under all of the:relevant circumstances that a jury would have found testimony from.Epstein.
eredible even if he: had ‘waived his right against sclf-incrimination, and.testificd on ‘her behalf.”)).

In any. event, to the extent the defense takes issue with the rule that co-conspirator statements can,
be-admitted without requiring the declarant. to testify, that complaint is properly directed tothe
drafters. ofthe. Federal Rules of Evidence.
