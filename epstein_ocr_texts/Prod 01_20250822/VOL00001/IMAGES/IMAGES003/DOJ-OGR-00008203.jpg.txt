Not only that, but the government’s direct examination of Jane today would have violated
its own proposal—for example, the government elicited testimony about where Jane attended
school and during what years, a prime example of a “specific location” and “particular dates of
life events” the government now seeks to prevent Ms. Maxwell from eliciting on cross-
examination. The government’s proposal is also contrary to this Court’s earlier ruling permitting
Ms. Maxwell to confront her accusers by eliciting evidence of their story lines.

We will remain cognizant of our duty to avoid revealing the names of witnesses testifying
under pseudonyms. And we will alert the government and the court in advance as we are able to
anticipate any issues.
