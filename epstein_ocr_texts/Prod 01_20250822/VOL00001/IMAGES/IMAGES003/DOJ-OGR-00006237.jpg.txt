Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 424 Filed 11/08/21 Page 26 of 41
creates a predicate that a witness has a condition creating such a “pathway.” And even then, as
described above, it is likely that such an opinion, based on one article, would be unreliable, only
marginally helpful to a jury that can understand the relationship between mental illness and truth-
telling, and highly prejudicial by having an expert witness testify to the credibility of other
witnesses. See Fed. R. Evid. 403..

5. Opinions Regarding the Credibility of Witnesses

Dr. Dietz also offers several different opinions regarding the assessment of the credibility
of witnesses. These are also not helpful to the jury.

Dr. Dietz’s opinion that emotional distress is not predictive of the truthfulness of an
allegation invades the core of a jury’s competency—the evaluation of a witness’s demeanor.
Indeed, in very similar circumstances, the Second Circuit has affirmed the exclusion of scientific
expert testimony instructing the jury in how to assess a witness’s demeanor. See Lumpkin, 192
F.3d at 289 (barring expert from testifying that “confidence bears little or no relationship to
accuracy in identifications,” reasoning that “Fundamental to the role of juror as trier of fact is the
task of assessing witness credibility. And, a witness’s demeanor on the stand, including his or her
confidence, impacts the assessment of credibility.”). The same result should apply here.

Similarly, Dr. Dietz’s opinion that “professionals” evaluate “[c]hanges in the core details
of the allegations” to determine credibility (Ex. A at 10), also invades the province of the jury.
How to reconcile inconsistencies in witness accounts, as part of assessing the credibility of
witnesses, is at the core of the jury’s function. See, eg., Lumpkin, 192 F.3d at 289. The
Government expects that the Court will instruct the jury on how to assess the credibility of
witnesses, and having one party’s witness lay down a set of expert-endorsed rules can only make
it more difficult for the jurors to follow the Court’s instructions. See, e.g., Hygh, 961 F.2d at 364.
