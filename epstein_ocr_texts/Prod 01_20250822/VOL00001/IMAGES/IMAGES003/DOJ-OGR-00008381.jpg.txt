would serve no proper purpose.?

Finally, Glassman’s conversations with the EVCP do not impeach Jane’s testimony. The
defendant would call Glassman to testify that he originally demanded a higher settlement from the
EVCP. As the Court explained when the defendant raised this very issue at a break on December
1, “there are personal knowledge questions in issue.” (Tr. 489). On cross, defense counsel asked
Jane if she knew whether her attorney asked the EVCP for more money, and she said she did not
know. (Tr. 558). Today, as on December 1, evidence of Glassman’s negotiations with the EVCP
(or the defendant) go to Jane’s bias only if Jane was aware of them. Jane testified that she was not
aware of them, and the evidence the defendant would elicit from Glassman would not cure that
defect. It is therefore improper impeachment. And for Glassman, as for Scarola and Edwards, the
suggestion that the jury should infer that Jane and Glassman had certain privileged conversations
that affect Jane’s knowledge from the fact that Glassman had other exchanges with other
individuals is more prejudicial than probative. See Fed. R. Evid. 403.

Il. Conclusion

For the reasons set forth above, the Court should preclude testimony from Jack Scarola,
Brad Edwards, and Robert Glassman.

3 The defendant also argues that Glassman’s exchanges with the Government that “do not repeat
or refer to statements by Jane” are not privileged. (Def. Letter at 8). Glassman’s statements in the
email are “Hey [prosecutor]. Hope you guys are staying safe. Here was her response about the
lion king,” which are irrelevant. And the prosecutor’s statements can only be relevant to the extent
that Jane was aware of them. But the defense has not established that fact, in part because the
defense framed its questions on cross to call for privileged information. (See, e.g., Tr. 511 (“The
government suggested to you that perhaps you meant to say The Lion King movie through your
attorney to you; correct?” (emphasis added))).
