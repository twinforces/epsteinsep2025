would serve no. proper purpose.?

Finally, Glassman’s conversations with,the EVCP do not impeach Jane’s testimony. The
defendant would.call Glassman to testify that he originally demanded a higher settlement: from ‘the
EVCP. As the: Court-explained when the defendant raised this very:issue: at a break:on December
1, “there are personal knowledge questions ‘in, issue.” (Tr. 489). On-cross, defense counsel asked.
Jane if.she knew whether her attorney asked the EVCP for more: money, and. she said she did not:
know. (Tr. 558). Today; as on-December 1, cvidence:of Glassman’s negotiations with the EVCP
(or the defendant) go to Jance’s bias only if.Jane was aware:of them. Jane'testificd that she, was not:
aware of them, and ‘the évidence, thé defendant would clicit from Glassman would not. cure that’
defect. It.is therefore improper impeachment. And.for Glassman, as for Scarola and-Edwards, the
suggestion, that: the jury’ should infer: that-Janc and. Glassman had. ccrtain:privileged conversations
that affect’ Janc’s knowledge from. the fact that Glassman. had. other exchanges ‘with other
individuals is ‘more’ prejudicial, than probative. See Fed. R.'Evid. 403.

Hil. Conclusion

Eor'the reasons sct. forth above; the Court ‘should. preclude testimony from Jack Scarola,

Brad Edwards, and/Robert Glassman.

3. The defendant also argues that Glassman’s exchanges ‘with the Government that “do not repeat
or refer to:statements by Jane” arc not:privileged. (Def. Letter at 8). Glassman’s statements in,the:
email are “Hey [prosecutor]. Hope you. guys are staying safe. Here was. her response about the
lion-king,” which are irrelevant. And:the’prosecutor’s statements .can,only be relevant:to'the extent.
that Jane was aware of them. But the defense has ‘not established ‘that: fact, in pan because: the
defense. framed ‘its. questions on cross to call. for:privileged information. (See, eg., Tr. S11 (The
government: suggested to you ‘that: perhaps you meant to say Lhe Lion. King movie through your
attorney to’you; correct?” (emphasis added))).
