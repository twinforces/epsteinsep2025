1 do it through the United States post office, I don't know what
2 the situation is how the MDC receives its packages, but if the
3 tracking information says available for pick up and days go by
4 and it's not picked up, what am I to do to put a candle under

S the MDC to get those packages?

6 THE COURT: I guess I'm still trying to understand

7 what it is that you are asking the Court to do.

8 MS. STERNHEIM: I'm asking the Court to have the MDC

9 retrieve its mail in a timely manner. I will notify them if a
10 next-day delivery is on the way, and that it be picked up for
11 next-day and not languish in the post office.

12 THE COURT: Ms. Moe?

13 MS. MOE: Your Honor, we will confer with MDC legal

14 about this issue and their practices and happy to provide the
15 Court with additional information about our disclosures last

16 week and the ongoing practices.

17 I can't speak to the particular mail sorting practices
18 of the MDC, but I want to assure the Court we have been working
19 diligently with the defense and with MDC legal on this issue
20 and have been taking extraordinary efforts to make sure the
21 disclosures are produced promptly and that they're sent to the
22 defendant quickly and we will continue to do so. And if we
23 learn of a practical way of expediting this, we would certainly
24 be open to exploring that but that's all the information that I
25 have at this point.
