Abstract
Ken Lanning’s recollections of the origins of the use of the term “grooming”
to refer to techniques used by acquaintances to gain sexual access to and
control over children is an important contribution to the history of the
significant recognition that many cases of child sexual abuse occur at the
hands of offenders who are acquaintances of the child and who do not need
to use force, threats, or violence to gain the compliance of their victims.
That this recognition was slow in coming is obvious in retrospect, as is true
of any social problem that remains hidden for centuries only to burst into
public consciousness over the course of a few years. In this article, | report
the results of searches using Google Scholar to look at the introduction of
this use of the term “grooming” to the peer-reviewed literature in 1984 and
its increasing use through 2016. Since 2008, the usage has been adopted
in hundreds of articles in the professional literature each year, suggesting
that this usage of the term “grooming” will remain common in the decades
ahead. | also examine the history of the term “seduction” in the context of
child sexual abuse, particularly two archaic uses of the term: as a euphemism
for any sexual or sexually stimulating encounter between child and adult and
in the context of suggestions that it was the child who seduced the adult.
To avoid resurrecting any confusion over these issues, it would be a mistake
to abandon “grooming” in favor of “seduction.” | conclude that the best
strategy may be that adopted by Lanning of using the terms grooming and
seduction in tandem, explaining the parallels between the seduction of one
adult by another and the grooming or seduction of a child by an adult.
