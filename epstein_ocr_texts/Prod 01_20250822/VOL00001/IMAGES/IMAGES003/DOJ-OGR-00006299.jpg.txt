Abstract

Ken Lanning’s recollections of the origins of the use of the term “grooming”
to. tefer 'to techniques Used by acquaintarices to: gaih séxual access. to ahd
control ‘over ‘children is an important, contribution to, the history of the
significant. recognition that many cases of child sexual abuse occur at. the
hands of offenders ear anaes « ofthe child and'whio. do r not t need
That this recognition was slow: i in ‘coming is obvious j in retrospect, as is ‘true
of ‘any ‘social problem that remains hidden ‘for centuries only to: burst. into
public consciousness over the course of a-few‘years. In-this article, | report
‘the results of searches Using Google Scholat-to look at.the, introduction of
this use of the term “grooming” to-the peer-reviewed literature in 1984:and
its increasing use ‘through 2016. Since 2008, the usage has: been adopted
in hundreds of articles in the professional literature each year, suggesting:
‘chat, this usage:of" the-téerm “grooming” ‘will remaiti common in the decades
ahead. | also examine the history: of the term “seduction” in the context of
child sexual abuse, particularly two:archaic uses of the’term: as:a euphemism
for any:sexual or sexually stimulating encounter between child and adult.and
ih the: context: of suggestions that’ it "was the. child who sediiced the adult.
To avoid:resurrecting:any confusion over these issues; it would bea mistake
‘to, ‘abandon “grooming” in favor of “seduction.” | conclude ‘that. the best
strategy may be ‘that adopted by Lanning’ of using, the terms grooming ‘and
seduction in tandem, explaining the parallels, betweeh the seduction of one
adult. by:another and the grooming:or seduction of'a child by an adult.
