as well as [her] experience conducting forensic psychological evaluations of
people who have experienced sexual abuse and trauma.” Mot. Ex. 1, p 2.

e The government tries to disclaim the importance of error rates. Resp. at 15-17.
But it’s not just that Rocchio cannot identify an error rate, it’s that her implicit
conclusion is that she doesn’t have an error rate. That is, all her patients are
telling the truth when they say they were groomed, so any evidence that matches
what her patients have told her is therefore evidence of grooming.

e But even if the error-rate discussion were misplaced, that doesn’t mean Rocchio’s
opinions are reliable. As a “qualitative” matter, and as the government’s own
Exhibit A concedes, there are no “‘reliable principles and methods’ to define and
detect grooming.” Govt. Resp., Ex. A, p 19 (quoting Fed. R. Evid. 702).

e The government apparently expects that, “somehow, a lay jury without guidance
[will] apply [Rocchio’s] analyses reliably to the facts of a case in determining
guilt.” See Raymond, 700 F. Supp. 2d at 150 (rejecting argument that a jury could
do just that). This Court should not, as the government request, simply punt the
matter to the jury. Resp. at 17-18. The Court is the gatekeeper. It must ensure the
evidence is reliable and relevant. If it’s not both, it has no place in a criminal jury
trial, because it will “radically simplify” an otherwise complex case, Burns, 2009
WL 3617448, at *5, and it will, as the United States Supreme Court has
cautioned, prejudicially mislead the jury, Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharms., Inc.,
509 U.S. 579, 595 (1993) (“Expert evidence can be both powerful and quite
misleading because of the difficulty in evaluating it.”).
