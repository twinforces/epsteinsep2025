issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, [or] waste of time.” Fed. R.
Evid. 403. According to the government, Accuscr-3. 1s. éxpected.to testify that she was “sexually
abused” by Epstcin, not because :she was:underage and. incapable of consent: by law, but because
her “subjective experience” of these incidents was that they were “traumatic, exploitative, and.
abusive.” Gov’t Mem. in. Opp. to. Def.’s Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 204) at 162:n.57. If Accuscr-3 is
allowed to testify that she felt she was “sexually abused” by Epstein, the jury*will naturally
assume that the alleged. sex’ acts were illegal, when'they were not. Indeed, ¢ven if she 1s, not
allowed to use the phrase “sexual abuse,” the: mere. fact'that-Accuser-3 will be-testifying about
alleged. sex acts that she: participated. in with a much, older man.when she was 17 years old will
likely lead the jury to assume that the conduct’was illegal, especially after they have heard.the
‘expeeted testimony of the other accusers in this case.

Henee, there is a strong likelihood that the jury will be misled by Accuser-3’s evidence
anid will misapply it in evaluating. Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocenceto the charged Mann Act
conspiracics, both. of-which require that.Ms. Maxwell acted with the intent that, the accusers:
would-engage in illegal or criminal sexual activity. ‘This risk substantially. outweighs the limited
probative effect of Accuscr-3"s:evidence. Even ifthe Court were to give:the jury an appropriate
jury did not misinterpret or:misapply this evidence. See: Curley, 639 F.3d at 60 (quoting; United
States v..Figueroa, 618 F.2d.934, 946 (2d Cir. 1980) (“limiting instructions cannot. be regarded

‘asa guaranty. against prejudice”)). Accordingly, the Court should exclude Accuser-3’s evidence.
