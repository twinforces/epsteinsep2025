prior to beginning any sexual abuse. However, this is a somewhat flawed
analysis, as there ought to be a trusting relationship in all father-daughter
relationships, at least prior to any abuse. Seventy-three percent of perpetrat-
ing fathers viewed this trust as crucial to the sexual relationship to reduce the
risk of the daughter disclosing the abuse (Warner-Kearney, 1987, as cited in
Christiansen & Blake, 1990). Many fathers also show clear signs of favoritism
toward their victimized daughter relative to their other children. Burgess and
Holmstrom (1980) wrote that molesters tend to use three types of pressure
to make their victims compliant: material goods, misrepresentation of moral
standards, and the need for human contact. They noted that material goods
are the most frequent tool that offenders use.

One difference has been found between genders of the victim in this
emotional coercion type of grooming. Spiegel (2003) noted that in male
victims, emotional coercion can take on a negative tone. For example, per-
petrators may use name-calling words such as “fag” or “whore” to put the
male child down and make him feel ashamed and thus less likely to disclose
the abuse.

Sexual Desensitization

Elliott and colleagues (1995) found that of those offenders who used babysit-
ting as a strategy to gain access to their victims, 27% started talking to the
child about sex, 21% misrepresented the abuse as educational or loving
(which again may not be part of grooming because some of this would
be postabuse), and 20% offered to bathe or clothe the child. Furthermore,
these authors found that 40% of all offenders said the first move they made
was sexual touching or genital kissing. Thirty-two percent of the offenders
asked the child for help with undressing or lying down. Forty-four percent of
the offenders used coercion and persuasion, 49% talked about sex with the
child, and 47% used “accidental” touch. Sixty-one percent of the offenders
would stop the abuse if the child became resistant and then persuaded the
child to let them begin again. Many offenders committed the abusive acts in
their own homes, where 33% used pornographic videos and magazines to
desensitize the child.

Conte and colleagues (1989) found that sexual desensitization was com-
monly used among the offenders in their sample. For example, one offender
stated,

Most of the time I would start by giving them a rub down. When I got

them aroused, I would take the chance and place my hand on their penis

to masturbate them. If they would not object, I would take this to mean it

was OK. I would isolate them. I might spend the night with them. Physical

isolation, closeness, contact are more important than verbal seduction.
