Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN) AN \) igo
2/2/22

Dear Judge Nathan:

We write on behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, to respectfully request a one-week
extension of time until Friday, February 11, 2022 to file our post-trial motions. The motions are
currently due on Friday, February 4, 2022. We have conferred with the government, which has
consented to the requested extension.

The requested extension is necessary because we need to meet with Ms. Maxwell in person
to review work product related to the motions. In-person visits at the MDC only recently became
available again this week. Due to other commitments, we are unable to meet with Ms. Maxwell
until the end of this week. This is the defense’s first request for an extension. We would consent
to a similar one-week extension for the government to file its response.

Sincerely,

/s/ Christian Everdell
