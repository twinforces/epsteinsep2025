Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

I write to inform the Court that the defense has provided the government with the tentative order
of the first several defense witnesses. We have informed the government that we are still trying to make
travel arrangements for defense witnesses, many of whom are coming from locations out of the district
and abroad, and we have not been able to reach counsel for some of the witnesses over the weekend.

We further informed the government that the order of witnesses is subject to change, and we will advise
the government if we think the order will change as travel plans solidify. We also informed the
government that three of the defense witnesses have requested to testify under their first names or under
a pseudonym. The government opposes this request. The Court’s ruling on this issue may impact the
willingness of these witnesses to testify, thereby compromising Ms. Maxwell’s right to present her
defense, and may affect the witness order.

Very truly yours,

/s/
