1 based on that conduct alone and the evidence based on that

2 conduct alone, we submit that, given the course of conduct in

3 the charged conspiracy, that Minor Victim-3 is a victim of an

4 ongoing conspiracy, which is one of agreement and intent.

5 We submit that her testimony alone wouldn't establish
6 a violation of the Mann Act, and without the other

7 circumstances of other victim testimony, we couldn't establish
8 that there was an ongoing intent to transport minor victims.

9 But given that the crime here is conspiracy and one of

10 agreements and mental states and not about attempts to violate
11 certain statutes or agreements to do so, it's about the

12 intention at the time of agreement during the course of a span
13 of conduct.

14 THE COURT: But it has to be an intention to engage in
15 an illegal act.

16 MS. MOE: That's correct, your Honor.

17 THE COURT: And so I think I need an answer to the

18 question. There is a distinction, surely, between criminality
19 and evidence of criminality. You have evidence of criminality,
20 which is not itself criminality, for sure. You have 403
al questions and the like. But I need to know the government's
22 position I think for a number of things in issue, including
23 Defendant's 4. So you have confirmed that the defendant
24 couldn't be found guilty of any crimes charged based on the
25 conduct alleged with respect to what you refer to as alleged
