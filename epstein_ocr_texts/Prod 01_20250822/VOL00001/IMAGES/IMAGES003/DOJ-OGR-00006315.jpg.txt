Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 427 Filed 11/09/21 Page4of16

1 can be fair and impartial to both sides in this case. Some people find that they can be fair and

2 impartial in one kind of case, but for various reasons, related to their own life experiences or views,

3. can't be fair in another kind of case. The process that we use is designed to help us figure out

4 _ whether you can be fair and impartial to both sides in this case.

5 If during the course of this process you come to believe that because of something that

6 you have experienced or because of something you've heard or read that you cannot be fair and

7 impartial—that is that you would favor either the Government or the Defendant regardless of

8 what the evidence shows—then you must tell me. It's not unusual, and there's no reason to be

9 embarrassed about it.
10 But the system only works if all of our citizens are willing and prepared to serve as jurors
11. when they can do so fairly and impartially. I do not expect that anybody would seek to avoid this
12 important duty for any but the most compelling reasons.
13 As I mentioned in my prior remarks, the Court has taken a number of steps to help ensure
14 the process for selected jurors is as safe and easy as possible. We have masking and distancing
15 protocols. We have reconfigured courtrooms to enhance safety measures. The Court will
16 provide transportation for selected jurors to and from the courthouse each day. Breakfast,
17. snacks, and lunch will be provided for you.
18 And please note that you are not required to be vaccinated to serve on the jury or required
19 to disclose your vaccination status. However, if you are selected to return for the final phase of
20 jury selection, a courthouse staff member will ask you before you leave today to fill out a form
21. regarding your COVID-19 vaccination status. If you are comfortable disclosing, the information
22 ~—-will solely be used by courthouse staff to ensure compliance with the District’s COVID-19
23 ~~ distancing protocols. The information will not be provided to the attorneys or anyone involved in
