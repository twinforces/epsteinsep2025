the Court make sure the jury understands its point: the instruction should say that Minor Victim-3
was above the age of consent at all relevant times, but it should also say expressly that the jury can
consider her evidence as direct evidence or for all of the permissible purposes under Rule 404(b).
That result, and the admission of her testimony, is entirely proper.

Respectfully submitted,

DAMIAN WILLIAMS
