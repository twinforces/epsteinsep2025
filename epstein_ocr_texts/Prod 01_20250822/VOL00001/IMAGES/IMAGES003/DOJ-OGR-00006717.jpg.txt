“(T]he law grants a:district court the samc broad. latitude’ when it. decides how to determine
reliability as it cnjoys in respect. to:its ultimate reliability determination.” Kumho Tire, 526 U.S.
‘at 142 (emphasis in-original); see United States v. ‘Requena,980 F.3d 30,47 (2d Cir. 2020). Thus
a-district courtmay-properly*exercise its. gatekeeping function without the “formality: of a, separate
(2d Cir. 201.1) (summary. order). “This is ‘particularly: truc if, at the time that the expert testimony
is presented to the jury,.a sufficient basis for allowing the testimony. is on the:record.” Williams,
506 F.3d at 161 (citing 4 Weinstein’s Federal Evidence § 702.02 [2] (2d ed. 2006)).

Finally, even if the expert testimony is reliable, it must.also be relevant. See, ¢.g., United
States v. ‘Forres, No. 20. Cr. 608 (DLC), 2021. WL 1947503, at. *6 (S.D.N.Y. May 13, 2021). In.
this ‘context, the ‘testimony must “concern, matters that the: average juror is not capable of
understanding on hisor her own.” United States ¥. Mejia, S45 F.3d 179, 194 (2d. Cir. 2008); see
Faulknery. Arista Records: LLC, 46 F. Sup. 3d 365, 375 (S.D.N.Y. 2014). (“Weighing whether the
expert testimony assists the tricr of fact goes primarily to relevanec.”).

Courts have frequently: admitted. expert testimony on. the psychological. relationship
between, perpetrators and. victims of sex: crimes. For instance, in United States v: Kidd, 385 F.
Supp. 3d 259 (S-_D.N-Y. 2019), ‘the Government. gave ‘otice of expert testiinony on “the
psychology of the pimp-prostitute relationship,” including concepts such as “trauma bonding.” /d.
at 263. The defendant interposed a Daubert challenge, arguing that;the experts testimony was not:

based on “studies or empirical data” and so could not “be assessed ‘for reliability.” Jd. (internal
