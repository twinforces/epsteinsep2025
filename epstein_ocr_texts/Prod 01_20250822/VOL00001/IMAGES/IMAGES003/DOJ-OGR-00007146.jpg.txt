11 authentication and the proffer as to that testimony. And you
12 will deal with the timeframe questions that have been raised as
13 well.

15 THE COURT: I need to see a little bit more than

16 what's been suggested, and I need to have a better

17 understanding of what is potentially being offered for.

20 MS. MOE: Your Honor, may I confer with my colleagues?
al THE COURT: Sure.

23 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor. Could we possibly
24 submit it on November 10, along with other briefing that date?
25 THE COURT: That's fine.
