particularly-when. studying the causes and effects of sexual abuse of minors. The Court. agrees
with Judge Engelmayer’s response'to this argument:

The absenee:of large quantity statistical. studies is ‘explained by a practical reason

that should be obvious to all. Studying the circumstances and. psychological.

drivers, of trafficked, women. is not like studying discases or’potential, cures in

laboratory animals. In.those studics, laboratory conditions literally can be

achieved. ...

That strictly quantitative mode of.inquiry isnot realistic or even, ethical, in the

context of studying sex, trafficking: ‘The causes ‘and contributors'to sex trafficking

by: their nature must: be studied. retrospectively: They'cannot: ethically be studied

otherwise. Subjects earinot be, tested to see. under what circumstances they"would

and would not, on.a going forward basis, fall:prey to the predations of scx

traffickers. Given, the necessarily retrospective nature of'such a study, given the

small size of the populations under review, and.given the inherently

individualized circumstances presented by dillerent: perpetrators, victims, and.

vocabulary of error rates and statistical significance i is-an unusually poor fit.

Tr. at 29-30, United States v: Randall, 19-Cr.-13.1 (PAE) (S.D‘N.Y. 2020), Dkt.'No. 335.

For the reasons Judge Engelmayer gave—which.Dr. Rocchio echoed in her testimony—
the Court finds that the crror-rate: factor listed. by.Daubert is not determinative as to the:rcliability
of Dr. Roechio’s method.

For similar reasons, the Court rejects the Defense’s. argument that Dr. Rocchio’s method
sensitive criminal acts like sexual, abuse, a researcher can only-rarcly ‘verify reports with absolute
certainty. Yt that docs not mean a clinical or forensic: psychologist accepts all.statements: at
face value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s profession is to examine and
diagnose her-patients consistent with her'significant training and spcécialized knowledge.
Further, on.the: forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifics

sexual, abuse. She: reports “remarkable consistency” between the reports: of her clinical patients
