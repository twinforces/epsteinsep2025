particularly when studying the causes and effects of sexual abuse of minors. The Court agrees
with Judge Engelmayer’s response to this argument:

The absence of large quantity statistical studies is explained by a practical reason

that should be obvious to all. Studying the circumstances and psychological

drivers of trafficked women is not like studying diseases or potential cures in

laboratory animals. In those studies, laboratory conditions literally can be

achieved. ...

That strictly quantitative mode of inquiry is not realistic or even ethical in the

context of studying sex trafficking. The causes and contributors to sex trafficking

by their nature must be studied retrospectively. They cannot ethically be studied

otherwise. Subjects cannot be tested to see under what circumstances they would

and would not, on a going forward basis, fall prey to the predations of sex

traffickers. Given the necessarily retrospective nature of such a study, given the

small size of the populations under review, and given the inherently

individualized circumstances presented by different perpetrators, victims, and

contexts in this tumultuous and emotionally fraught area of criminal conduct, the

vocabulary of error rates and statistical significance is an unusually poor fit.

Tr. at 29-30, United States v. Randall, 19-Cr.-131 (PAE) (S.D.N.Y. 2020), Dkt. No. 335.

For the reasons Judge Engelmayer gave—which Dr. Rocchio echoed in her testimony—
the Court finds that the error-rate factor listed by Daubert is not determinative as to the reliability
of Dr. Rocchio’s method.

For similar reasons, the Court rejects the Defense’s argument that Dr. Rocchio’s method
is unreliable because she relied on the reports of her clients. Given the realities of studying
sensitive criminal acts like sexual abuse, a researcher can only rarely verify reports with absolute
certainty. Yet that does not mean a clinical or forensic psychologist accepts all statements at
face value. Rather, as the Government notes, part of Dr. Rocchio’s profession is to examine and
diagnose her patients consistent with her significant training and specialized knowledge.
Further, on the forensic side of her practice, Dr. Rocchio regularly investigates and verifies
sexual abuse. She reports “remarkable consistency” between the reports of her clinical patients
