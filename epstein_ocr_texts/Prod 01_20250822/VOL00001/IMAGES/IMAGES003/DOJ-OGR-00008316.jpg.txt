1 in my life, I think you can come to point of agreement, can't

2 you?

3 MS. COMEY: Yes, your Honor. Indeed we told the

4 defense that we by no means mean to bind the defense against

5 raising an issue that comes up during direct. We just wanted

6 to know ex ante as things stand, do they have a good-faith

7 basis to believe that there's a grounds for cross-examination

8 along those topics.

9 THE COURT: It sounds Like, I bet, this conversation
10 could happen without me and everybody else in this room. But
11 I'm glad to be here for you.

12 MS. COMEY: Thank you, your Honor.
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Thank you, your Honor. Thank you.
14 THE COURT: What's next?
15 MS. COMEY: Your Honor, the other issue was, we've
16 become aware recently of a number of subpoenas that the defense
17 has served on witnesses. There's one in particular that we
18 wanted raise at this juncture, which is, the defense has served
19 the attorney who currently represents Minor Victim 4 with a
20 subpoena, seeking his testimony at this trial. We've attempted
21 to confer on this issue because the government has no idea what
22 admissible testimony that attorney could possibly offer at this
23 trial that would not be covered by attorney-client privilege.
24 We would move to preclude it, but we cannot fathom what the
25 testimony would be. And so we're raising it with your Honor
