ES 18 3 tense provsl on
this motion—and we believe the law and facts are clearly on our side—it would render all other
post-trial motions moot. Ms. Maxwell should not have to expend precious time and resources
briefing other motions when this motion can and should be dispositive. Accordingly, the defense
respectfully requests that the Court set a briefing schedule for this motion alone and defer setting a
briefing schedule for any other post-trial motions.
Sincerely,
