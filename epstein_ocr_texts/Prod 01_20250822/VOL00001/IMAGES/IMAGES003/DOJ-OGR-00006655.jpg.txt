Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 445 Filed 11/12/21 Page 6of11

The provenance of the exhibit. is particularly troubling. The: document.compilation
allegedly surfaced in. connection. with.a former Epstein. employee; Alfredo Rodriguez, now:
deceased. Mr. Rodriguez was attempting. to sell the compilation’to Brad Edwards, one of the
lawyers who was involved in.suing Mr. Epstein, in 2009.

According to the Criminal Complaint filed against.Mr. Rodriguez in 2009, Mr. Rodriguez
approached. onc of the lawyers and offered to. sell the lawyer evidence against Mr. Epstein.
United: Sialés Vv. Rodriguez, Case No. 9:09-mj-08308-LRJ (S.D. Fla), ECF No. 3; 493-7. .A. sting
operation was set up by the FBI during which the 97 pages. were provided to: an undercover
officer:in exchange for $50,000. /d..at 4478-11.

Its uncléar what'the Government, claims these documents are — what ts clear, however,
is that they are neither authentic nor relevant. It:is also obvious that the documents. are hearsay;
‘an.out of court statement offered for the truth, ofthe matter asserted, in violation, of Fed..R. Evid.
80.1. There is:no witness. who could:identify or attest that these documents qualify ‘for any
‘exception to the hearsay rule.

Given their unknown, date of creation, the lack of any ‘authenticating witness, and the fact;
that the documents do not appear-until.2009 — five-ycars after the end of the conspiracies charged
in the indictment -- there’ is. no relevance that can be attached to the information. Moreover, any
arguable relevance is outweighed by the prejudicial considerations under Fed. R. Evid. 403. It'is
unclear, and unknown, who created.the documents, when they'were ercated, ‘or how they’ were
ereated. ‘The: documents cannot: be, authenticated and.no evidentiary foundation, cxists that would,
allow forthe, admission. of the documents. Thus, who may or may not be the author of whatever.
‘ended'up as these‘photocopies is not evidence that.can, orshould’be considered by any jury in

this: matter:
