Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

I write in response to the government’s motion to preclude certain testimony by
Alexander Hamilton. Based on a defense Rule 26.2 disclosure, the government’s motion
identifies four categories of testimony it asks this Court to preclude:

(1) Testimony about Kate’ s [a

(2) Testimony describing Kate as

(3) Testimony about Kate’s statements to Mr. Hamilton.

(4) Testimony about Mr. Hamilton’s J of Kate’s account of her alleged

abuse.
Gov. Letter, pp 8-10.

Ms. Maxwell provided Mr. Hamilton’s declaration to the government under Rule 26.2
because that is what the Rule requires. But just as the government does not intend to admit
evidence about every disclosure it makes, so too here.
