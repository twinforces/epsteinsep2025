The Indictment
| The defendant, GHISLAINE MAX WEELGhislaine Maxwell, has been formally charged
in what is called an “Indictment.” As I instructed you at the outset of this trial, the Indictment is
simply a charge or accusation. It is not evidence. It is not proof of the defendantsMs. |
Maxwell’s guilt. It creates no presumption and it permits no inference that the defendant is
guilty. Ms. Maxwell begins trial with an absolutely clean slate and without any evidence against
her. You must give no weight to the fact that an Indictment has been returned against the-
defendantMs. Maxwell.
I will not read the entire Indictment to you at this time. Rather, I will first summarize the
offenses charged in the Indictment and then explain in detail the elements of each of the offenses.
Adapted from the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United
States v. Jones, 16 Cr. 533 (AJN) and in United States v. Pizarro,
17 Cr. 151 (AJN).
