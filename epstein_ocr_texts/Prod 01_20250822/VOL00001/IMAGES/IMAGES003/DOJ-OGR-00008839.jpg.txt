ORDER
Defendant.
ALISON J. NATHAN, District Judge:

The Court is in receipt of Defendant’s motion for a new trial and accompanying exhibits,
which she requests to file under seal. See Dkt. No. 580. The Court has also received requests
from media organizations to unseal the motion. The Court is aware there is substantial public
interest in this matter and will ensure that the First Amendment right to public access is fully
safeguarded. At the same time, the Court must act deliberately and hear from the parties in
considering these sealing issues in order to ensure the integrity of any potential inquiry process
going forward, should one be ordered. That too is in the public, as well as the Defendant’s and
the Government’s, interest.

Accordingly, to the extent the Defense requests that arguments in favor of sealing should
themselves be sealed, that request is DENIED. Arguments in favor of sealing can be made in
such a way so as not to undermine the grounds for seeking sealing or redaction in the first
instance.

The Defense is therefore ORDERED to file a letter on the public docket on or before
February 1, 2022, that justifies the proposed sealing by reference to the three-part test in
Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006). The Government may file
on ECF a response to the Defense’s justification letter on or before February 4, 2022.
