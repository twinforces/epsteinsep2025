Re: United States v. Maxwell, No. 1:20-cr-00330-AJN
Dear Judge Nathan:

I write on behalf of Daily News, L.P., publisher of the New York Daily News, to
respectfully join in the requests of The Miami Herald, The New York Times, ABC News, and
NBC News to unseal the motion for new trial and supporting exhibits filed by the Defendant in
this case, to unseal Juror 50’s motion to intervene, and to unseal the juror questionnaires for the
12 seated jurors.!

As the Court is aware, the public and the press have a presumptive First Amendment and
common law right of access to criminal proceedings and records. See Press Enterprise Co. v.
Superior Court of California, 464 U.S. 501, 508 (1984) (“Press Enterprise I’). The presumption
of openness can only be overcome if “specific, on the record findings are made demonstrating
that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that
interest.” Press—Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1, 13-14 (1986) (“Press-Enterprise
Il’). Under this standard, the presumption in favor of access to court proceedings and records
requires "the most compelling circumstances" to justify any restriction upon that right. In re
Application of Nat'l B'casting Co., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. 1980).

The reasons why the documents in question should be unsealed have been clearly set
forth in the submissions by the other media entities. The Daily News would simply emphasize
that the right of access applies fully to post-trial proceedings, including motions for a new trial
and accompanying exhibits and memoranda. See, e.g., United States v. Donato, 714 F. App’x
75, 76 (2d Cir. 2018) (summary order) (concluding that documents attached to motion for a new
trial were judicial documents subject to right of access and holding that district court abused its
discretion in refusing to unseal documents); United States v. Gonzalez, 927 F. Supp. 768, 784
(D. Del. 1996) (“the public, through its surrogate, the press, has a right of access to the post-trial
briefs and appendix filed in support of defendant’s Motion for a New Trial’’); United States v.

' Non-parties such as the Daily News have standing to intervene in criminal proceedings to assert
the public’s right of access. United States v. Aref, 533 F.3d 72, 81 (2d Cir. 2008).
