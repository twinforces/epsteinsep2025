Re: United States’v. Maxwell, No. I:20-¢r-00330-AJN

Dear Judge Nathan:

[write on behalf of Daily News, L.P., publisher of the New York. Dail News, to
respectfully join in the requests of The Miami, Herald, The New York: Times, ABC News, and
NBC News ‘to unscal ‘the, motion for new trial and supporting exhibits. filed. by’ the. Defendant in.
this case, to unscal Juror 50’s:motion to intervene, and to‘unscal the juror. questionnaires: for the.
12 seated j jurors."

As the Court:is:aware, the'‘public and the ‘press have.a:presumptive First Amendment: and
common law right of access to criminal proceedings and records. Sée Press Enterprise Co. v.
Superior Court of California, 464 U.S. 501, 508 (1.984): (“Press Enterprise-I””). ‘The presumption
of openness can. only be overcome if “specific, on:the record. findings arc: made: demonstrating
that closure is essential to preserve higher’values and.is narrowly. tailored to:serve that
interest?” Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. 1, 13-14 (1986) (“Press-Enterprise
Il”). Under this. standard, the presumption in favor of access'to, court-proccedings and. records.
requires “the most. compelling circumstances" to justify any restriction upon that right. In.re
Application.of Nat'l. B'casting :Co., 635 F.2d 945, 952 (2d Cir. 1980).

The reasons.why the documents in question should beunscaled have been clearly'sct
forth in. the submissions, by’the! other media entitics. The Daily News would. simply:emphasize
that the right of access applics ‘fully to post-trial proceedings, including motions for-a new'trial
‘and accompanying exhibits and memoranda. See; e. g., United States v. Donato, 714 F. App’x
75, 76 (2d: Cir. 2018) (summary: order) (concluding x that documents attached to motion, for a new:
trial, were judicial, documents subject to right, of access and:holding that district court.abused.its
diserction.in refusing to 'unseal documents); United States'v. Gonzalez, 927 F.Supp. 768, 784
(D. Del. 1996) (“the public, through its surrogate, the press, hasa right of access to the-post- trial
briefs and. appendix filed in. support of defendant’s Motion-for:a. New Trial”); United States v..

! Non-parties such as the Daily. News have standing to intervene in.criminal. proceedings to assert,
the public’s right;of. access. United States v. Arcf, 533 F.3d.72, 81 (2d Cir. 2008).
