‘the witnesses. .How do you evaluate the:credibility or believability.of the witnesses? The answer

is that you use your common sense, judgment; and experience. Common sense is your greatest
asset as a juror. You, should ask yourselves, did the ‘witness. impress. you. as honést, opén, and.
candid? ‘Or did the witness appear evasive, as though the witness: was trying to hide ‘something?
How. responsive'was the witness to. the questions ‘asked on, direct:examination and on, cross-
exainination? Consider. the witness’s demeanor, manier. of testifying, and accuracy: of the
witness's recollection. In addition, consider how well the witness recounted what. was heard. or
observed, as the witness may be honest but mistaken.

If you find that a witness is intentionally telling a falsehood that is always a matter of

importance that you should. weigh carefully. If you find,that.any witness has lied under oath at.

care. You may-reject the entirety of the witness testimony, part of it or none of it. Itis:for you to
decide how: much of any witness’s testimony, ‘if any, you wish fo credit. .A. witness may. be:
inaccurate, Contradictory; or even untruthful. in some. respects and yet entirely believable and

significant: or inconsequential, and ‘whether to accept or reject all or to accept.some and reject. the:

‘balance of the testimony of any witness.

that:any witness ‘whose testimony you are considering may-have an interest in-the outcome of.

‘this trial, then, you. should bear that ‘factor:in, mind when evaluating the credibility:of his or her,
