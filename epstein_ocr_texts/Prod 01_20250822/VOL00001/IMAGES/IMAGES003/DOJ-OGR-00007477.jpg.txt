The government‘hopes. Dr. Rocchio will fill in the: gaps in the accusers” stories by lending
the imprimatur of an “expert” to their allegations. The likely importance of her'testimony to the
‘government’s case cannot’ be overstated.* Dr. Dietz, who the government admits is:supremely
qualificd, should be'‘allowed to challenge the reliability of ‘Dr: Rocchio’s opinions, explain: why
they lack. support, and opine about their limits. See.Brooklya Waterfront Lerminal Corp. ¥. Int'l
Terminal Operating Co,, 211 F. Supp. 702, 707 (S.D.N.Y.), aff'dsub nom, Brooklyn Waterfront
Terminal Corp: v- Int'l Terminal Operating Co: Iné.,. 311 F.2d,221.(2d Cir. 1962) (“As inal
cases, this sharp conflict between the ‘experts must be resolved by the trier of the fact.”).

B.. Hindsight Bias.

The government appears to have two objections ‘about, Dr. Dictz’s opinions on hindsight.
bias: First, that the testimony improperly attempts'to inform'the jury’what result'to, reach, and

“grooming” only afierthe fact and ‘retrospectively—that is, only afier it is clear abuse occurred.
Ex. 1, p 4-5. But the government’s burden in this case is to prove that, ‘at the time the abuse

allegedly occurred, Ms. Maxwell knew about it and. intended to facilitate it. If Ms. Maxwell

* So important are Dr. Dictz’s and. Dr. Loftus’s opinions to the: defense that the failure to
consult, with. and call:them.as witnesses would amount:to ineffective assistance of counsel. See
Gersien v. Senkowski, 426 F.3d.588, 607-08 (2d Cir. 2005) (defense counsel was ineffective in,
failing “to call as a witness, or cven to consult in‘preparation for trial, and cross-cxamination of.
the prosccution’s witnesses, any ‘medical. cxpert'on child. sexual abuse”).
