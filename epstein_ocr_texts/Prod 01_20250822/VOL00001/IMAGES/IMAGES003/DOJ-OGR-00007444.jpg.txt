allegedly had a motive to obtain young women, but.not wideraged girls, to satisfy Epstein.
Accuser=3’s evidence is simply not:probative of any proper 404(b) purpose.

Furthermore, admitting Accuscr-3’s evidence :for these:purposes would conflict with the
Court’s preliminary rulings at the November 10":conference concerning the permissible scope of
Accuser-3’s testimony. The Court. recognized.that.allowing Accuser-3 to testify about her sexual
acts with Epstcin:would create a significant.risk that the jury. will convict.Ms..Maxwell on an

cautioned that Accuscr-3 will. likely become emotional. and. upset if she allowed to describe:these
events to the jury. The defense does not doubt-that this is true. That is precisely why. the Court

must exclude: Accuscr-3’s, evidence under'Rule:403. As the:Court has already recognized, such,
