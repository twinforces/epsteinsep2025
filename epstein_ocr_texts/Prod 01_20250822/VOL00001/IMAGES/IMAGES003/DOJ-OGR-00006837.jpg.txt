Facilitators and Barriers to Child Sexual
Abuse (CSA) Disclosures: A Research
Update (2000-2016)

Ramona Alaggia', Delphine. Collin-Vézina”,.and Rusan Lateef’

Abstract

Identifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures has the potential to facilitate.
earlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and prevent further sexual victimization. Timely-access to
therapeutic services can: mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses.on CSA
disclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33
studies since 2000 were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and
future research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned. to apply to
practice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke's’ guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (1) Disclosure is an
iterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure
models reflect a social-ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,

familial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there
is.a lack of.a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides:have
been made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knowledge does not fully capture:a cohesive picture. of dis-
closure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.

Barriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-
itators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future
research.

Introduction

Timely access to supportive and therapeutic resources for child
sexual abuse (CSA) survivors. can mitigate risk to the health
and mental health well-being of children, youth, and adults,
Identifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit
CSA disclosures have the potential to facilitate: earlier disclo-
sures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and
potentially prevent further ‘sexual victimization. Increased
knowledge on both the factors and the processes involved in
CSA disclosures is timely when research continues to show
high rates. of delayed disclosures (Collin-Vézina, Sablonni,
Palmer, & Milne, 2015; Crisma, Bascelli, Paci, & Romito,
2004; Easton, 2013; Goodman-Brown, Edelstein, Goodman,
Jones, & Gordon, 2003; Hershkowitz, Lanes, &.Lamb; 2007;
Jonzon & Lindblad, 2004; McElvaney, 2015; Smith et al.,
2000).

Incidence studies in the United States: and Canada report
decreasing CSA rates (Fallon et al., 2015; Finkelhor, Shattuck,
Tumer, & Hamby, 2014; Trocmé et al., 2005, 2008), while at

the same time global trends from systematic reviews and meta-
analyses have found concerning rates of CSA, with averages of
18-20% for females and of 8—-10% for males (Pereda, Guilera,
Forms, & Gémez-Benito, 2009). The highest ‘rates found for
girls is in Australia (21.5%) and for boys in Africa (19.3%),
with the lowest rates for both girls (11.3%) and boys (4.1%)
reported in Asia (Stoltenborgh, van IJzendoorn, Euser, &
Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2011). These findings point to the
incongruence between the low number of official reports of
