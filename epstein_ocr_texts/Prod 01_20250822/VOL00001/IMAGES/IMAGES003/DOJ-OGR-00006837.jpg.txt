Abstract
Identifying and understanding factors that promote or inhibit child sexual abuse (CSA) disclosures has the potential to facilitate
earlier disclosures, assist survivors to receive services without delay, and prevent further sexual victimization. Timely access to
therapeutic services can mitigate risk to the mental health of survivors of all ages. This review of the research focuses on CSA
disclosures with children, youth, and adults across the life course. Using Kiteley and Stogdon’s literature review framework, 33
studies since 2000 were identified and analyzed to extrapolate the most convincing findings to be considered for practice and
future research. The centering question asked: What is the state of CSA disclosure research and what can be learned to apply to
practice and future research? Using Braun and Clarke’s guidelines for thematic analysis, five themes emerged: (1) Disclosure is an
iterative, interactive process rather than a discrete event best done within a relational context; (2) contemporary disclosure
models reflect a social—ecological, person-in-environment orientation for understanding the complex interplay of individual,
familial, contextual, and cultural factors involved in CSA disclosure; (3) age and gender significantly influence disclosure; (4) there
is a lack of a life-course perspective; and (5) barriers to disclosure continue to outweigh facilitators. Although solid strides have
been made in understanding CSA disclosures, the current state of knowledge does not fully capture a cohesive picture of dis-
closure processes and pathways over the life course. More research is needed on environmental, contextual, and cultural factors.
Barriers continue to be identified more frequently than facilitators, although dialogical forums are emerging as important facil-
itators of CSA disclosure. Implications for practice in facilitating CSA disclosures are discussed with recommendations for future
research.
