Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 424 _ Filed 11/08/21 Page 36 of 41

‘School of Social Ecology, https://faculty.sites.uci.cdu/cloftus/ (“[Dr. Loftus’s] experiments reveal
how memories can be. changed by ‘things that we are told.”). Such research may thus be
inapplicable to the facts of this casc.

To the extent; 'that;'the Court believes that the defense may have carried ‘its burden, of
establishing the reliability of Dr. Loftus’s opinions on, false: memory formation, the Government
respectfully requests a. Daubert hearing to test the reliability of these opinions.”

Even if any'such opinions, are reliable, however, they: should not be admitted absent. an
affirmative showing of “fit” for this case. See Fed. R. Evid. 702 advisory committee n. (stating
that “generalized” expert testimony must. “fit? the facts of the case”).. For example, testimony.
about‘the ways:in which “false and/or distorted memoriés can be created asa result of post-event.
information and occurrenccs, suggestion, influcnec, or the like” is irrclevant to this.casc. .At that
level. of generality, it has. no obvious “fit” to the facts of this case. There is ‘no evidenec that.
whatever“oceurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like” about'which Dr. Loftus intends totestify’
be probative to the jury. Thus, .as'with Dr: Dictz, any reliable opinions Dr. Loftus secks to offer
on false memory formation should be limited. to those as to which there is.a.:clear. evidentiary:

predicate establishing their “fit”-to the case.

' Ag With. Dr. Dict7, see footiiote 9, sipra, if a hearing is necessary, the Government similarly
requests that it be conducted.after reeciving the defense:response and.after:all necessary Rule 26.2
