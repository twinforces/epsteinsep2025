Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 424 _ Filed 11/08/21 Page 36 of 41
School of Social Ecology, https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/eloftus/ (“[Dr. Loftus’s] experiments reveal
how memories can be changed by things that we are told.”). Such research may thus be
inapplicable to the facts of this case.

To the extent that the Court believes that the defense may have carried its burden of
establishing the reliability of Dr. Loftus’s opinions on false memory formation, the Government
respectfully requests a Daubert hearing to test the reliability of these opinions.”

Even if any such opinions are reliable, however, they should not be admitted absent an
affirmative showing of “fit” for this case. See Fed. R. Evid. 702 advisory committee n. (stating
that “generalized” expert testimony must “‘fit’ the facts of the case”). For example, testimony
about the ways in which “false and/or distorted memories can be created as a result of post-event
information and occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like” is irrelevant to this case. At that
level of generality, it has no obvious “fit” to the facts of this case. There is no evidence that
whatever “occurrences, suggestion, influence, or the like” about which Dr. Loftus intends to testify
happened to any witness in this case, much less in a manner that reliably affects memory or would
be probative to the jury. Thus, as with Dr. Dietz, any reliable opinions Dr. Loftus seeks to offer
on false memory formation should be limited to those as to which there is a clear evidentiary
predicate establishing their “fit” to the case.

As with Dr. Dietz, see footnote 9, supra, if a hearing is necessary, the Government similarly
requests that it be conducted after receiving the defense response and after all necessary Rule 26.2
disclosures have been made.
