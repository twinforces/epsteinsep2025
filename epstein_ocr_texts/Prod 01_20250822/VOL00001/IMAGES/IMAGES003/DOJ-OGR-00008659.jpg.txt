of férse:with which MSs. Maxwell is: charged, and that Ms. Maxwell aided, abetted, counseled,
commanded, induced or procured that person,to' commit.the crime.

As you can’ see, the ‘first requirement is’that: another person has committed the crime
charged. Obviously, no one:can be convicted.of aiding and abetting:the criminal acts of another

if no crime’ was committed by the other person. But:if you do find:that.a.crime was committed,

‘then you must consider*whethér Ms. Maxwell aided or abettéd:thé, commission. of the criine.

To aid or abet another to.commit a crime, it is necessary:that:the Government:prove that

‘the Defendant. willfully and knowingly associated herself .in.some‘waywith the crime committed,

by the other person and willfully and.knowingly sought by some. act-to help the crime succeed.

‘However, let me caution;you-that the:mere presence of the defendant where a ‘crime is
being committed, even when. coupled with.knowledge by the defendant’that a crime is being
committed, or the:mere: acquiescence by a defendant :in the criminal :conduct of others,,even with
guilty knowledge, is not sufficient to make the defendant guilty under this approach of aiding,
and abetting. Such a. defendant would be guilty’undér this approach:of aiding and abetting only
if, in addition to.knowing of the criminal activity, she actually took actions.intended.to help it
succeed.

An, aider and abettor must know;that the crime is being committed and act in, a way that is,

‘To, determine. whether Ms. Maxwell, aided or abetted ‘the commission. of the crime ‘with

‘which. she:is charged, ask: yourself these questions:

1, Did the Defendant participate in the crime charged. as something she wished to

bring about?
