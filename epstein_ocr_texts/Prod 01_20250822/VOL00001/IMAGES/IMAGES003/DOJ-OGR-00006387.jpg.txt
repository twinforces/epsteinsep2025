Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 438 Filed 11/12/21 Page 27 of 54

automobile is deemed to be the possession of all passengers in.the automobile wiless the firearm.
is found on the person of a particular passenger. See id. at.245, 247 (citing N.Y. Penal Law
§ 265.1'5(3)). The district attorney dropped the charges against the defendant. and three other
individuals, leaving only one of. the individuals facing state charges for'other firearms. See Jd. at:
245.

White therefore sought to admit: the initial, charging decisions at his federal trial, arguing:
that “if the gun had actually becn ‘recovered from his ‘person, none of the other individuals would
have: been charged:with possession of that particular gun.” Jd. at 245. The: district court rejected
that argument, and the Sccond Circuit, reversed, explaining that the “decision, to charge all
‘passengers traveling in. the vehicle with possession... ..supports White’s theory that ‘noric. of the:
firearms was found on his. person. and. discredits the officers’ testimony ‘to ‘the contrary.” Jd. at.

This, case thus contrasts quite sharply with. White. In White, the state’s carlicr charging
actual, possession of the gun. It'was therefore highly relevant. as, evidence used to undermine the
credibility: of the officers testifying to the defendant’s: possession. Here, however, ‘the
Government’s past, charging decisions are entirely. irrclevant.to any. factual issue in. the case or
the credibility of any witness. See Watts, 934 F. Supp. 2d at 485 (distinguishing White ina.
conspiracy case because “a. conspiracy necessarily involves agreement amongst more than one:
actor to engage in. criminal :conduct for which. all, members of the conspiracy may be ‘found,

equally culpable”).
