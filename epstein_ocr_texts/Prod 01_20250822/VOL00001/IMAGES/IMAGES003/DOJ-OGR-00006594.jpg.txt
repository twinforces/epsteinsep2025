ARGUMENT
I. Rocchio’s proposed testimony is inadmissible.

Federal Rule of Evidence 702 governs the admissibility of Rocchio’s proposed testimony.
That rule says:

A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training,

or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:

(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the

trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;

(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;

(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and

(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the

case.
Fed. R. Evid. 702.

Rule 702 charges district courts “with ‘the task of ensuring that an expert’s testimony
both rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the task at hand.’” Amorgianos v. Nat’l R_R.

R. Evid. 401 & 402. A court must ensure that an expert “employs in the courtroom the same
level of intellectual rigor that characterizes the practice of an expert in the relevant field.” Nimely
