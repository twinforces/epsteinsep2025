adult and child victims... .” Jd. at *7. Even then, he did not exclude the testimony—he simply
ordered a Daubert hearing. Jd. at *8. The Government ultimately declined to proceed with that
testimony rather than conduct a mid-trial Daubert hearing. Here, and as noted above, Dr.
Rocchio’s proposed testimony concerns the experience of manipulated and coerced victims, rather
than the intentions of perpetrators.
