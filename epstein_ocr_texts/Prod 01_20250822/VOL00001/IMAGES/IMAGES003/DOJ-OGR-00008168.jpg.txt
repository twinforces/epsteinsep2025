Case 1:20-cr-00330-AJN Document 511 Filed 11/27/21 Page 3 of 3
included in the 3500 material or the government exhibits, we will provide paper copies of those
documents to the government before we show them to the witness on the witness screen.

We have conferred with the government, and they do not agree to the proposed procedure.
Among other things, they expressed concern that a juror might see the witness screen. But the jurors are
permitted to know the identity of the witnesses testifying under pseudonyms, so that concern seems
unjustified to the defense. We believe this process will adequately safeguard everyoneâ€™s interests and
provide for a more efficient trial. We respectfully ask the Court to approve this procedure.

Very truly yours.
