2. The government has apparently abandoned efforts to introduce her
testimony as Rule 404(b) evidence.

In their response, the government still fails to comply with the new Rule 404(b) notice
requirements. First, they do not actually identify the evidence with any specificity, especially
with respect to the "exhibits" that they hope to introduce through her. Second, while they use the
words "plan and preparation" or "knowledge," they fail to explain how those uses of the
testimony are independent of the character / propensity inference banned by Rule 404(b). How
are the process and frequency of massages or the sexual nature of massages after the period of
the conspiracy proof of a plan or preparation, apart from the propensity inference? A plan or
preparation usually comes before an event. Planning or preparing for something after it has
occurred can only be based on an assumption that because you are the kind of person who
solicits underage massages later, you must have been the kind of person to do so earlier.
Similarly, knowledge after the end of the conspiracy is not the same as knowledge at the time of
or before the purported charged acts occurred, except by way of propensity. Finally, unspecified
exhibits, many of which appear to have been written after the conspiracy (e.g., GX 505 — dated
Feb. 14, 2005) cannot likewise be proof of the charged crimes which were allegedly completed
before J showed up.

Because the government makes no effort to argue the non-propensity purpose for these
uses Of J Via Rule 404(b), and failed to give notice of the purposes or reason in
advance in any event, this Court should exclude the evidence on this ground.

constructive amendment and variance to the Indictment.

Finally, what is clear from the government's proffer in their Response, the anticipated
testimony © fll
