B. Brad Edwards.
U-Visa application to the Government on behalf of Kate. This, testimony, too, would not be
privileged, but it is irrelevant.and improper impeachment.

Kate testified that, at.a. meeting, she asked. the Government, to look into sponsoring her for
a U-Visa. (Tr. 1279, 1287, 1300). She acknowledged that Edwards likely attended. the meeting,
