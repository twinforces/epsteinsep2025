Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document545 Filed 12/15/21 Page6éof9
B. Brad Edwards

The defendant proposes to call Brad Edwards, counsel for Kate, to say that he provided a
U-Visa application to the Government on behalf of Kate. This testimony, too, would not be
privileged, but it is irrelevant and improper impeachment.

Kate testified that, at a meeting, she asked the Government to look into sponsoring her for
a U-Visa. (Tr. 1279, 1287, 1300). She acknowledged that Edwards likely attended the meeting,
but did not recall whether he provided a U-Visa form to the Government (Tr. 1300). Kate also
explained that her plan is simply to renew her current visa, and that the Government has made no
promises to assist her. (Tr. 1207-08, 1295).

The fact that Edwards provided the Government with a U-Visa application form during a
meeting with Kate is not relevant or impeaching of Kate. Rather, it is entirely consistent with
Kate’s testimony—specifically, that she made an inquiry about a U-Visa but was not sure whether
her lawyer provided the Government with a U-Visa form. And the fact that her lawyer provided
the Government with a U-Visa form is not “powerful evidence of motive of bias,” as the defendant
suggests. (Def. Letter at 6). First, as with Scarola’s proposed testimony, it could only be evidence
of Kate’s bias to the extent she is aware of the fact, a predicate which the defense did not establish.
Second, it is not “powerful” evidence of anything. Kate acknowledged asking the Government
about a U-Visa. Whether her lawyer, at the same time, gave the Government a partially complete
U-Visa form is at most marginally confirming extrinsic evidence of Kate’s own testimony. It does
not show, for instance, that Kate or Edwards continued to seek a U-Visa after the meeting, that she
continues to seek one now, or that the Government has made any promises to Kate of any kind
about her immigration status, nor could the defense argue any of that from the anticipated
