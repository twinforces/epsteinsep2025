Pathways to False Allegations 111

attention and revenge makes a false allegation of sexual assault. However,

when considering this pathway, it is important to keep in mind that indi-

viduals with BPD are more likely to have experienced sexual or physical

assault (Lieb, et al., 2004) due to the same characteristics of the disorder.

Thus, it is important to fairly and adequately weigh the evidence presented

in an allegation of sexual assault.

Histrionic Personality Disorder

The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) defines histrionic

personality disorder as “pervasive and excessive emotionality and attention-

seeking behavior” (p. 711). Prevalence estimates range from .6% to 2.9%

of the general population (as cited in Lenzenweger et al., 2007; American

Psychiatric Association, 2000). Diagnosis is indicated by the presence of five

or more of the following diagnostic criteria:

1) is uncomfortable in situations in which he or she is not the center of
attention;

2) interaction with others is often characterized by inappropriate sexually
seductive or provocative behavior;

3) displays rapidly shifting and shallow expressions;

4) consistently uses physical appearance to draw attention to the self;

5) has a style of speech that is excessively impressionistic and lacking in
detail;

6) shows self-dramatization, theatricality, and exaggerated expression of
emotion;

7) is suggestible G.e., easily influenced by others or circumstances), and

8) considers relationships to be more intimate than they actually are

(p. 714).

The primary diagnostic criteria of interest in this pathway are diagnostic
criteria 1, 2, 5, 7, and 8. Other relevant behaviors include the tendency
to play out stereotyped roles in their relationships with others; an intense
desire for novelty and excitement; and the upset and depression that may
follow periods in which they received little attention (American Psychiatric
Association, 2000).

Filing a false allegation of sexual assault may serve to benefit individuals
with histrionic personality disorder in several important ways. The sexual-
ized behavior of individuals with histrionic personality disorder can lead to
sexual relationships that may be used to seek attention (e.g., having sex with
a person and telling all of their friends about it). Filing a false sexual assault
claim may regain lost attention, either from the desired partner or from other
