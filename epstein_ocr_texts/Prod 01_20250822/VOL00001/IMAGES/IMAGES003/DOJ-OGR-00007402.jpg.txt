For the reasons set forth below, the birth certificates are self-authenticating under Rule 902
of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and no records custodian should be required to testify. The
exhibits should be determined to be self-authenticating.
1. Applicable Law
Rule 902 contains a list of items that are “self-authenticating,” that is “they require no
extrinsic evidence of authenticity in order to be admitted.” Fed. R. Evid. 902. Under Rule 902(4),
that list includes:
Certified Copies of Public Records. A copy of an official record
— or a copy of a document that was recorded or filed in a public
office as authorized by law — if the copy is certified as correct by:
(A) the custodian or another person authorized to make the
certification; or
(B) a certificate that complies with Rule 902(1), (2), or (3), a
federal statute, or a rule prescribed by the Supreme Court.
Rule 902(1), in turn, provides for self-authentication of the following:
Domestic Public Documents That Are Sealed and Signed. A
document that bears:
(A) a seal purporting to be that of the United States; any state,
district, commonwealth, territory, or insular possession of
the United States; the former Panama Canal Zone; the Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands; a political subdivision of
any of these entities; or a department, agency, or officer of
any entity named above; and
(B) asignature purporting to be an execution or attestation.
Finally, Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 27 permits a party to “prove an official record
... in the same manner as in a civil action.” Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44(a)(1), in turn,
permits proof of a domestic “official record” that is “otherwise admissible and is kept within the
United States, any state, district, or commonwealth, or any territory” through
