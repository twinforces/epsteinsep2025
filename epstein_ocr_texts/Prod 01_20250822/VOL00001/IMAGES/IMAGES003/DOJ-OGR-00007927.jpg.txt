7 (Government's Exhibit 5 received in evidence)

8 BY MS. POMERANTZ:

9 Q. Dr. Rocchio, did you provide the government with this

10 article?

11 A. I did.

12 Q. Why did you provide the government with this article?

13 A. I was asked to provide examples to the government of

14 literature in the field that I thought might be helpful to the
15 court to understand the concepts that I'm talking about. This
16 does a really nice job of pointing to the part that the terms
17 grooming and seduction refer to a pattern of behavior that's
18 widely known and well established to be part of the dynamics of
19 sexual abuse. But in particular, I appreciated the author's
20 emphasis later on in the article of some of the problems with
21 the words seduction and some of the ways that much earlier
ae literature erroneously used terminology that could
23 inappropriately indicate a victim is blamed for the abuse that
24 they have been subjected to.
25 MS. POMERANTZ: Can you pull up Page 31, please.
