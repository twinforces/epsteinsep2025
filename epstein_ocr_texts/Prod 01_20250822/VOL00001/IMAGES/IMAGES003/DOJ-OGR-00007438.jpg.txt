anticipated testimony that might be admissible as Rule 404(b) evidence with respect to the Mann
Act conspiracies and propose an appropriate limiting instruction. See 11/1/2021 Tr. at 88:5-16.
Despite being given these clearly defined tasks, the government spends a significant portion of its
November 5 letter rearguing its position that the evidence related to Accuser-3 is direct evidence
of the Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts One and Three of the Indictment. See 11/5/2021
Ltr. at 5-6. The Court has already correctly determined that Accuser-3â€™s evidence is not direct
proof of the Mann Act conspiracies and cannot be offered for that purpose:
The evidence related to alleged Victim-3, as the government
describes her, is not direct evidence of the conspiracy charged in
Counts One and Three of the indictment. Counts One and Three
charge the defendant with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
engage in illegal sex acts and conspiracy to transport minors with
intent to engage in criminal sexual activity.
The parties agree that alleged Victim-3 was 17 at the time she was
acquainted with the defendant and Epstein in London, England
where the age of consent is 16. Moreover, she can't recall, and the
government wouldn't be able to establish that she was invited to
travel with the defendant when she was 17 or 18. And because the
alleged victim was over the age of consent in all relevant
jurisdictions and, therefore, any alleged sexual activity was lawful,
the alleged conduct does not arise out of the same transactions or
series of transactions as the charged offense. It's not inextricably
intertwined with the evidence, again with respect to the Mann Act,
and it's not necessary to complete the story of the crime on trial, so
I don't think it can be direct evidence of the Mann Act counts.
11/1/2021 Tr. at 86:9-87:4 (emphasis added). In so finding, the Court rejected all of the reasons
that the government offers (again) to admit this evidence as direct proof of the Mann Act
conspiracies. The government has given the Court no reason to change its initial finding and it
should decline to do so.
