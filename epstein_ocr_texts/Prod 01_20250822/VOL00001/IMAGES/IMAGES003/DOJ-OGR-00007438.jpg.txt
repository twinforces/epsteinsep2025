anticipated testimony that might. be admissible as Rule 404(b) evidence with respect to. the Mann

Act conspiracics and. propose an, appropriate: limiting instruction. See:11/1/2021 Tr. at 88:5=16:

Despite being given. these clearly defined tasks, the government spends a significant portion. of its

of the Mann Act conspiracies charged in Counts ‘One and Three of the Indictment. See 11/5/202.1

Ltr. at'5-6. The Court has already correctly determined.that Accuser-3’s evidence is. not direct

proof of the Mann Act conspiracies and cannot be offered for that purpose:

The evidence related to alleged Victim-3, as the government
describes her, is not direct evidence of the conspiracy charged in
Counts One and Three of the indictment. Counts One and Three
charge the: defendant. with conspiracy to entice minors to travel to
cngage in ‘illegal, sex acts, and.-conspiracy ‘to transport minors with
intent to, engage in criminal sexual. activity.

The parties agree that alleged Victim-3.was.17 at the time she was
acquainted with the defendant and Epstcin in London, England
where the age of consent. is 16. Moreover, she can't reeall, and the
government wouldn't be able to establish that she ‘was’ invited. to
travel with the defendarit'when. she was 1.7 or 18..And becatise: the
alleged victim. was over the: age of consent in all relevant
jurisdictions and, therefore, any alleged scxual activity was lawful,
the alleged conduct does not.arise out. of ‘the same transactions. or.
series of transactions ‘as the charged offense. It's not inextricably
intertwined with. the evidence, again with respect to the Mann. Act,
and it's not necessary to complete the story: of the. crime:on-trial, so
Fdon't think it can. bedireet evidence of the: Mann. Act counts.

that the -government offers (again) to admit this evidence:as direct proof of the Mann.Act

conspiracies. The government has given, the Court no-reason to change its initial, finding and it

should:dcecline to do.so.
