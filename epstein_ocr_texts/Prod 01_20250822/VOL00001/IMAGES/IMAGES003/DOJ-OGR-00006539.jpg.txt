Government need not wait until the witness is cross-examined. See United States v. Flores, 945
F.3d 687, 706 (2d Cir. 2019).

Following defense attacks on the Minor Victims’ credibility, the Government anticipates
offering prior consistent statements it expects to elicit from its witnesses. Specifically, while the
Government expects that some of its prior consistent statements will be offered to rebut the charge

the declarant’s credibility as a witness,” including from charges that the declarant has given
inconsistent statements or has a faulty memory, Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(1)(B)(ii). Because the
grounds for admission will depend on the defense’s precise challenge to the witness, the
Government will raise this issue with the Court before eliciting prior consistent statements from
its witnesses.

to the trial. (See Def. Opp. at 28-29). The breadth of the conspiracy theories the defense intends
