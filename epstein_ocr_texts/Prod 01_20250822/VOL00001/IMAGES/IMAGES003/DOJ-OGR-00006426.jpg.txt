Ghislaine Maxwell herby submits her response to the Government’s Omnibus Motions in
Limine.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
The government’s self-described “Motions in Limine” are an ill-founded attempt to:
(1) improperly obtain advisory rulings from the Court on an undeveloped factual record;
(2) prematurely, and unconstitutionally, force Ms. Maxwell to reveal defense theories, strategies,

inviting a mistrial.

evidence before the evidence is actually offered”); see also Palmieri v. Defaria et al., 88 F.3d
136, 141 (2d Cir. 1996) (“The purpose of an in limine motion is to aid the trial process by
