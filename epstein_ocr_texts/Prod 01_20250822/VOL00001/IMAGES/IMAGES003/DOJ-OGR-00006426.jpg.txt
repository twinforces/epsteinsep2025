enlist the Court ‘in vouching' forthe credibility: of the accusers by the use of pscudonyms and
other artificces..

For the most part, the issues raised by the government cannot, and should not, be
addressed pretrial because the Court lacks’the necessary facts to: make intelligent:rulings. The
issues raised under headings II-XI should be denied on this basis alone. The arguments related:to
