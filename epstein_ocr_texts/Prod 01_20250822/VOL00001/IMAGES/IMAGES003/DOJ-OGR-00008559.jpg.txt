Instruction No. 12: Conspiracy and Substantive Counts
As I have just described, there are certain counts in the Indictment that are conspiracy
counts, ‘while others are what are referred to as substantive counts. Unlike the conspiracy

charges, which allege agreements.to' commit ecrtain offenses, the substantive counts are based on,

thé actual commission. of offensés, or aiding others td actually commit offenses.

A. conspiracy’to commit a crime is an entirely separate and different offense from the

substantive crime ‘which may: be the objcet of the conspiracy. :Congress has deemed it appropriate

to:make conspiracy, standing alone, :a. separate: crime, even:if the object ofthe conspiracy ‘is not

achieved. The essence of the crime of conspiracy is ‘an agreement or understanding to violate
other laws. Thus, if.a.conspiracy ¢xists, even if it fails, ‘itis still punishable asa crime.

Consequently, in a conspiracy charge there is no necd to prove that the:crime that was the

objective of the conspiracy was actually committed.
By’ contrast, the substantive counts require:proof that the crime, charged Was actually’

in.a Conspiracy to commit.a crime and then actually commits that crime, that defendant:may: be

guilty of both the conspiracy. and the substantive crime, .as I: will instruct:you shortly.

We will turn first,to the substantive charges in the Indictment, which are more convenient.

to consider before the conspiracy charges. Therefore | will instruct you first: on Counts Two,

Four, and Six, and. then [will instruct you ‘on Counts One, Three, and Five.
