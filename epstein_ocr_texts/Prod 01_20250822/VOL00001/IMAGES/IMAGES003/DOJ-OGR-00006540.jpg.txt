to put before this jury illustrates the side show the defense hopes to create. Those conspiracy
theories include, among other things, as the defense would describe: (1) the Government’s alleged
motives for prosecuting the defendant (id. at 42-43); (2) the credibility of individuals who are not
testifying at this trial and are not hearsay declarants (id. at 43-45); (3) supposed evidence relating
to the Minor Victims’ consent (id. at 46-49); (4) evidence of other abuse which did not involve the
defendant (id. at 51-53); (5) the defendant’s statements offered by the defendant (id. at 54-55); (6)
arguments sounding in nullification (id. at 55-56); (7) alleged evidence—of which the Government
is not aware—that the defendant was a victim of Epstein (id. at 56-57); and (8) evidence that the
defendant was the prevailing party in civil litigation (id. at 57-59). The defense also now suggests
that they may argue that attorneys for the Minor Victims are conspiring with their clients to
manufacture evidence. (/d. at 21-22).

the jury. The Government is concerned that the defense plans to exceed its limits and, therefore,
has moved to preclude the defense from arguing them or offering evidence of them. The defense
urges the Court not to rule on these in /imine, instead providing the empty assurance that the
defense understands the Federal Rules of Evidence and will only offer evidence the defense deems
proper. But is for the Court—not the defense—to decide what is admissible at this trial.

More troubling still, the defense brief makes clear that they plan to put these theories before
the jury before the Court has an opportunity to rule on these issues, including in their opening
statement. (Def. Opp. at 51 (“If Ms. Maxwell’s attorneys have a good-faith belief that evidence
will be admissible, they can refer to that evidence in opening statement.”’)). The Court should not
