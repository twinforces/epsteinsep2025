Credibility of Witnesses

You have had the opportunity to observe the witnesses. It is your job to decide how
believable each witness was in his or her testimony. You are the sole judges of the credibility of
the witnesses. How do you evaluate the credibility or believability of the witnesses? The answer
is that you use your common sense, judgment, and experience. Common sense is your greatest

witness’s recollection. In addition, consider how well the witness recounted what was heard or
observed, as the witness may be honest but mistaken.

importance that you should weigh carefully. If you find that any witness has lied under oath at
this trial, you should view the testimony of such a witness cautiously and weigh it with great
care. You may reject the entirety of the witness testimony, part of it or none of it. It is for you to
decide how much of any witness’s testimony, if any, you wish to credit. A witness may be
inaccurate, contradictory, or even untruthful in some respects and yet entirely believable and
truthful in other respects. It is for you to determine whether such untruths or inconsistencies are
significant or inconsequential, and whether to accept or reject all or to accept some and reject the
balance of the testimony of any witness.

In evaluating credibility of the witnesses, you should take into account any evidence that
the witness who testified may benefit in some way from the outcome of this case. If you find
that any witness whose testimony you are considering may have an interest in the outcome of
