The third element of Count.Six which the Government must prove beyond.a reasonable
doubt is that. Ms. Maxwell knew’ that:the’ person, Carolyn, would be caused to engage in‘a.
commercial sex act.

The term “commercial sex: act” means “any:sex act, on.account.of which anything of
valuc Js given.to or received by any person.” The thing of value may’ be money or:any other:
whether the person who receives it is the:person. performing the commercial sex, act.

It is not:relevant whether or not ‘Carolyn was a‘willing participant in:performing
commercial sex acts when. she was*under the age of 18 years old. Consent by the person is not-a
defense to the charge in Count Six of the Indictment:if Carolyn was under the age of 18 at.the
time the commercial séx acts took place. It is also-not required, that.the:pérson actually

performed.a commercial sex act so long,as the: Government has proved that:

‘Maxwell reeruited, enticed, harbored, transported, provided, or obtained the person, for the:

purpose of engaging in commercial scx acts.
