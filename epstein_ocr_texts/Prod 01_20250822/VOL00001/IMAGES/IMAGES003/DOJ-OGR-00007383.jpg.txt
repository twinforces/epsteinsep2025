Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

Pursuant to the Court’s Order at Dkt. No. 477, the Government is submitting today
proposed redactions to the parties’ supplemental briefing regarding Witness-3 and the Court’s
Memorandum Opinion & Order resolving those motions.

The Government’s proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated
by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).
Although the parties’ supplemental briefing and the Court’s Opinion & Order are judicial
documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the limited proposed redactions are
narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of Witness-3, who has not identified herself on
the record in this case, and who is a subject of the Court’s pseudonym order. In addition, some of
the proposed redactions reference sealed materials from the Rule 412 litigation, which are “related
materials” within the meaning of Fed. R. Evid. 412(c)(2).
