allege'three: distinct, episodes of alleged sexual abuse, in three different locations, involving three
separate accusers. The.allegations of Accuser-3 stand on/their own and. are: not.“inextricably’
intertwined” with the allegations of Accuser-1 or Accuscr-2, nor. do they stem from “the same:
series of transactions.” In fact, they have no bearing on or conncetion to those allegations
whatsoever. Bécatis¢, Accuscr-3’s allegations are conceptually distinct, they are also-not
“necessary to complete'the story” of the charged conspiracies. See: Cummings, 60 F. Supp. 3d at
438 (defendant’s prior crack arrests and firearms, conviction not ‘sufficiently. connected to
underlying conspiracy to. distribute crack and possessing firearms to.be admissible); Jownsend,

though the conduct was “generally: similar to the conduct.underlying the offenses. charged in the:
indietment”); United States vi Mahaffv; 477 F. Supp:.2d.560, 566 (E:D.N.Y. 2007) vacated in
part on. other grounds 285 Fed. App’x 797 (2d Cir. 2008) (similar prior finaneial crime not
inextricably linked to the charged. crime where prior act, “was a:scparate, diserete offense that
may be conceptually’ segregated from the charged offenses without impairing the jury’s ability to
understand the :facts underlying the: schemes alleged in.the indictment”); Nektaloy, 325 F.Supp.

The fact that the government included. Accuser-3’s allegations in'‘the S2 Indictment. is of
no consequénee. .Although Rule 404(b) typically governs the admissibility of “other acts” that
are not charged inthe indictment, in this: casc, the government evidently. charged.the: conduct

‘under the mistaken belicf that Accuser-3 ‘was a minor' when, she engaged. in sex acts with Epstein:
