LBAGmax4 Rocchio - Cross

1 that you're describing occur; correct?

2 A. Correct.

3 Q. So you are making an assumption that whatever you are

4 hearing is accurate; correct?

5 A. It depends on the context whether or not I'm making that

6 assumption.

7 Q. You would make that assumption in order to label it

8 grooming; correct?

9 A. I would, for example, in a forensic context, I wouldn't say
10 this is grooming or grooming happened. I would say the
11 individual described behaviors that are consistent with
12 grooming, for example.
13 Q. But for purposes of your testimony in this case, when
14 you're talking about what you're describing as grooming,
15 there's an underlying assumption that either there's an
16 attempted sexual assault or exploitation or actual sexual
17 assault or exploitation, otherwise it's not grooming; correct?
18 A. I wouldn't agree that it's an assumption. It's part of the
19 definition. So --
20 Q. We're kind of going circular here.
al THE COURT: Yes. So we'll move on. There are
22 fruitful arguments in cross-examination here, I hope you'll get
23 to that soon.
24 MR. PAGLIUCA: Thank you, your Honor.
