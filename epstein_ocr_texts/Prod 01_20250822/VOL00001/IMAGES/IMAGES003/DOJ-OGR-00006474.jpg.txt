defenses responsive to the allegations in the Indictment. It is premature to constrain Ms.
Maxwell’s defense before trial. Ms. Maxwell reserves the right to present evidence and make
argument on the issue of consent when and where appropriate.

where none exists, and it misunderstands what constitutes prior-act evidence and basic concepts
of relevance in the context of a conspiracy where one actor denies knowledge of an illegal
