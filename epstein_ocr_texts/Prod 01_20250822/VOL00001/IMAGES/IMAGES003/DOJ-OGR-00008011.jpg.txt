1 A. That was the conclusion of the article, yes.
2 QO. And this is in 2016, this article, correct?
3 A. It was written in '16, published in '17 perhaps, yes.
4 Q. And we are talking about, in the conclusion and
5 implications here, which is on page 9, "The present study found
6 that individuals are not able to identify the potential
7 predatory behaviors that a child molester may employ."
8 Correct?
9 A. Not able to identify it ahead of time, which is different
10 than scientific Literature looking at retrospective studies.
11 But, yes, you're correct that this article found that we
12 couldn't predict who is and is not, ahead of time, going to be
13 a predator, based on certain behaviors and grooming.
14 Q. Right. And the reason is, once you believe that someone
15 sexually assaulted someone, then you can, in hindsight, go back
16 and look at behavior and characterize it as grooming. Right?
17 A. That's actually not what hindsight bias in the -- as
18 referenced in the grooming literature refers to.
19 Q. So I'd like to take a look at Exhibit 6 now, which has been
20 admitted â€”- or?
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: I don't know if I admitted that, your
22 Honor. But I move for the admission of Exhibit B.
23 THE COURT: Without objection?
24 MS. POMERANTZ: I'm so sorry.
25 THE COURT: Defendant's Exhibit B.
