A. Tt. was written in 'l6, published in '17 perhdps, yes.
Q. And we are talking about, in the conclusion and
wmplicattiions heré, which is on page 9, "The present study found
that individuals are not able to identify the potential
predatory behaviors that a child molester may employ."
Correct?
A; Not ablé to identify it ahead of time, which is différeént
than scientific laterature looking at. metrospective studies.
But, yeS, you're Gorrect that this article found that. we
couldn't predict who is and, 1s mot, ahead of time, going to be
a predator, based on Gértain behaviors and gréoming.
Q. Right. And the reason, is, once you believe that. someone
sexually dassaultéd someone, then you Gah, in Hindsight, goé back
and, look at behavior and characterize it as grooming. Right?
A. That's aétually noét what Hindsight bias in the == as
referenced in the grooming literature mefens to.
