C. Discussion

There was nothing unduly suggestive about the identification procedure used here.
Accordingly, there is no basis to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant, and
Minor Victim-4 should be permitted to identify the defendant at trial.'”

First, the identification procedure was not suggestive because it was merely a
“confirmatory identification” of a person Minor Victim-4 had known and identified by name over
the years. There is no “improper police conduct” creating a “substantial likelihood of
identification” by showing a person in that position even a single photograph, much less a photo
array or photo book. See, e.g., United States v. Hardy, No. 10 Cr. 1123 (JSR), 2011 WL 7782582
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 2011) (“Displaying a confirmatory photograph of a person the witness has
indicated that he already knows is perfectly acceptable.”); Gilbert v. Sup’t of Collins Corr. Fac.,
No. 03 Civ. 3866 (LBS), 2004 WL 287683, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 11, 2004) (upholding
confirmatory identification following street canvass on the grounds that “‘police suggestiveness
does not require suppression of an identification if the witness was not thereby influenced, as, for
example, when the witness’s identification was already positive.’” (quoting Jarrett v. Headley,
802 F.2d 34, 41-42 (2d Cir. 1986))); see also, e.g., Franco v. Lee, No. 12 Civ. 1210 (SJF), 2013
WL 704655, at *10 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 2013) (“In cases in which the defendant’s identity is not in
issue, or those in which the protagonists are known to one another, suggestiveness is not a concern
'7 Even if the Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant were suppressed, that would not
preclude Minor Victim-4 from testifying about her abuse and the name and physical description
of the person involved.
