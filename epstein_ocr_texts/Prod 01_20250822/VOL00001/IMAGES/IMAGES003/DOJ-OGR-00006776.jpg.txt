C. Discussion.

There was nothing ‘unduly’ suggestive about ‘the, identification. procedure. used here.
Accordingly, there is no basis to suppress Minor Victim-4’s identification of the defendant, and.
Minor Victim-4 should be permitted to identify the defendant. atstrial.!”

First, the: identification procedure. ‘was not suggestive because it was ‘merely a
“confirmatory identification” of a;person Minor Victim-4 had.known and identified by name over
the ‘years. There is no “improper police conduct” creatifig a “substantial likelihood. of
identification” by showing a person in:that. position. even a. single photograph, ‘much less a:photo
array or photo book. See, ¢.g., United, States'v: Hardy, No. 1.0: Cr. 1123 (JSR), 20.1.1 WL 7782582
(S.D.N.Y. Jan. 25, 201.1) (“Displaying a confirmatory photograph ofa person. 'the. witness has
indicated that he already knows is perfectly acceptable.”); Gilbert v. Sup’t of Collins Corr, Fae.,
No. 03 Civ. 3866 (LBS), 2004 WL. 287683, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 11, 2004) (upholding'

eee

confirmatory identification following strect canvass ‘on the grounds that “police suggestivencss

does not require suppression of an identification if the witness was not-thereby influenced, as, for
example, when the ‘witnéss’s identification was already positive”” (quoting Jarre v. Headley,
802 F:2d 34,.41-42 (2d Cir. 1986))); see. also, e.g., Francov. Gee, No. 12.Giv. 12.1.0 (SJF),.2013
WL 704655, at *10 (E:D.N-Y. Feb. 26, 2013) (“In eases; in which, the defendant’s identity 11s, not in,

issué, or those in which the protagonists are known to:one another, suggestivencss is. not a concer.

'? Even. if'the Minor: Victim:4’s. identification of the defendant were suppressed, that would. not:
preclude Minor Victim-4 from testifying about. her abuse andthe name and ‘physical description,
of the person involved.
