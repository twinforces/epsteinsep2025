the MDC also noted that defense counsel can deposit legal mail in the MDC’s legal mailbox during
visiting hours (between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.); MDC’s mail room staff picks up such mail between
approximately 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. once every business day and logs the mail, which is then delivered
to an inmate by the unit manager. According to legal counsel at the MDC, any additional steps
would be extremely burdensome and not practicable in light of the various responsibilities of the
MDC’s legal department and staff, which are responsible for issues relating to the approximately
1,700 inmates at the MDC.

Respectfully submitted,
