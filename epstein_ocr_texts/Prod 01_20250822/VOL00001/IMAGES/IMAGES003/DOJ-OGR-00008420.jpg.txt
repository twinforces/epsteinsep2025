Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document550  Filed.12/17/21 Page 2of3.

EBI document, the judge’was reasonable in, insisting that the witness. be allowed to,
examincihis purported. statement before being impeached by ‘it..If the witness denied.
it was his'statement, the matter could then be resolved bycalling the FBI agent:who:
had. compiled the: ‘report. We do'not think Rule: 613(a): was intended, to take away’
the district judge's, discretion to. manage the trial in a'way designed to ‘promote!
accuracy’ and fairticss; and while it would be wrong x for a judge to say, “In my court
Wwe apply the: common law tule, not Rule. 61.3(a),” he is’ ‘entitled. to:conclude that:in
particular circumstances: the older approach should. be: used in order to avoid
confusing witnesses and jurors

Id. at 121.15 See also Sloman ¥. Ladlock, 21, F.3d 1462, 1.472, (9th Cir. 1994).
‘were not: written by the witness. Accordingly, the Court: should follow the approach described iin.
Marks.

Second, if a,witness admits making an inconsistent statement:in, 3500 material, the witness
is ‘thereby impcached, and there is no need.‘for further extrinsic evidence. See United Sates v.
Rivera-Donate, 682. F.3d 120, 127 (1st Cir. 2012) (concluding that a prior.:statement is not. even.
Inconsistent where the witness acknowledges and explains the inconsistency); Wnifed States v.
Soundingsides, 825 F.2d 1468, 1470, (10th Cit. 1987) (denying petition for rehearing). Bur see
United. States 'v; Strother, 49 F.3d. 869, 876 (2d. Cir. 1995) (“Extrinsic evidence of a prior
inconsistent, statement is ‘more persuasive to. a jury: than a witness’s acknowledgement. of
inconsistencies in a prior statement.”).' It is irrclevant that the witness then chooses. to stand. by
her trial testimony.

Finally, the Goverriment belicves the statements at Tr. 455°3-18, 532:12-17,. and 596:7-25

The Government believes Sworher, which involved a harmless error’ analysis of two critical
memoranda, is distinguishable from this case. There, the marginal. probative value: of admitting
the actual statement was high. Here, by contrast, admitting extrinsic ‘evidence of a.statement the
witness has admitted contained in an agent’s report, that,the witness has not disputed ‘is minimal.
