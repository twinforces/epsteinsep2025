1 instruction, they're handed a sheet of paper which says write

2 your juror number and check a box, vaccinated, not vaccinated,

16 the 29th -- I will give you my final resolution as to that when
17 IT have it -- but my thinking is we are in the courtroom, all of
18 us. The panel, approximately 50 to 60 people who I will bring

20 in one place, with a video, in which I ask some very
21 preliminary questions: Does anybody need to change any answers
22 and has anybody had media exposure, etc. Hands raised. If
23 anybody does raise their hands, we will have staff in each of
24 those rooms who we can bring in one at a time to deal with.
25 And assuming not, or once we deal with that, that's our panel,
