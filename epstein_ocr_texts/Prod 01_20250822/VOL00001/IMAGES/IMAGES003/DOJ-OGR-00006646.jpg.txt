Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 444 _ Filed 11/12/21 Page 20 of 21
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Court should exclude evidence related to Accuser-3
because it is not probative of the charged conspiracies and inadmissible under Rule 404(b) and
Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. In the alternative, Ms. Maxwell respectfully requests
that the Court (1) preclude the government and Accuser-3 from referring to Accuser-3 as a
“minor” or asserting that she was a “minor” at the time of the alleged sex acts, (2) preclude the
government and Accuser-3 from representing that she was “sexually abused” by Jeffrey Epstein,
and (3) give the jury an appropriate limiting instruction concerning Accuser-3’s testimony that
includes the points discussed above.
