1. First Exemplar

The first exemplar to which, the defense objects involved.a, statement Epstein made to
Employceé- in order to provide: background information and history about an. ongoing scx
trafficking conspiracy. Specifically, Epstein.informed-Employee-l, in.sum and:substance, thatthe:
dcefendant-uscd to find, girls for Epstein. ‘The Government expects that Employce~1 will testify that:
at the time Epstcin.made this statement, Employce-1 was a participant'in a conspiracy to sex traffic
minors for Epstein. In particular, Employce-1 will testify that in, 2005, Epstein’was still reeciving
paid. scxualized. ‘massages from minor girls, which his employees ‘facilitated. As ‘part. of ‘that:
conspiracy, Employee-1 made phone calls: to schedule girls, whom -Employce-!l knew to: be
underage, to provide Epstein. with massages, which. Employce-1 knew would. involve sex acts in
testify that Epstein. and. his employees continued. to arrange for other minor girls.to provide the
paid sexualized:massages.

In. other words, although the time period. for the sex trafficking conspiracy charged. in the
Indictment ends.in 2004, the same:sex trafficking conspiracy‘continued.beyond that'time. Further,
the defendant cannot be: presumed to have withdrawn, fromthe conspiracy simply because: the
conspiracy charged in'the.Indictment ends.in.2004. See.Diaz, 1.76 F.3d at 98 (“Unless a conspirator
produces affirmative evidence of withdrawal, \his participation in a.conspiracy is presumed to
continue ‘until. the last overt. act. by any of the conspirators.” (quoting United Siates vy.
Greenfield, 44 F.3d. 1141, 1150 (2d Cir. 1995))). The defendant therefore remained in a sex.
trafficking conspiracy with Epstcin in 2005. And. for purposes ‘of analysis under Rule
'80.1(d)(2)(E), it is irrelevant, that the Indictment includes a timespan. that ends in 2004 becatise:

“[t]he conspiracy between the declarant and.the: defendant need not be identical to.any conspiracy
