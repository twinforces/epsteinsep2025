Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 446 Filed 11/12/21 Page 6of11

In approximately. April 2006 the investigation was concluded. According to the police’
‘reports, the investigating detectives belicved that they had probable causc'to charge Jeffrey
Epstein, 7] and[—_]_ Ms. Maxwell’s name is absent.from any charging document.or
probable: cause statement.

The poliée reports reflect that.a. disagreement arose between the police. aiid the state
attorncy as to how the case was being handled. Essentially, the-police believed that Mr. Epstein
‘was ‘not being treated harshly enough and that.here had been an excessive amount of delay: in the
prosccution because of the inaction by the prosecuting attorneys. The disagreements over how
the case’was being prosecuted became 'significant.and public. The Chief of Policc, Mr. Reiter,
wrote séveral Ictters to the: prosecuting attorncys including. a letter suggesting that the
prosecutors.had a.conflict of interest. In a.letter to‘one ofthe alleged victims Chief Reiter wrote:
“T'do not fecl that justice has been sufficiently served by‘the indictment that has been issued.
Theréforé please know that his (sie):matter has. been referred to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation to: determine if violations of federal,law have occurred.”

The ‘reports ‘and seized. documents are a mash-up of a various hearsay: sources. More! often
than-not, it is difficult to determine how ‘many multiple layers. of-hearsay cxist-with regard:to a
particular picce of alleged, evidence. Significantly, the Palm Beach Police Department:Property
Reécécipt/Search Warrant Return (Government Exhibit 295), attached as Exhibit, A, is cursory; and,
reflects items moved in-and out.of the property department. Detective Recarey is dead, and no
record, custodian exists that can identify what was (1) scized; (2): what. was maintained by the
Palm. Beach. Police Department and. by'whom; (3) what was returned. and (4) what was
purportedly: transferred.to the FBI. Other documents provided to the defense suggest that'when.

‘the FBI opened packages that'were alleged to have contained evidence nothing was inside and.
