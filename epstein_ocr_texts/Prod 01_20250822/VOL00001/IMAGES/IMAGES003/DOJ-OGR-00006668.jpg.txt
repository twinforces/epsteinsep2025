Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 446 Filed 11/12/21 Page6of11

In approximately April 2006 the investigation was concluded. According to the police
reports, the investigating detectives believed that they had probable cause to charge Jeffrey
Epstein, i ond ggg Ms. Maxwell’s name is absent from any charging document or

prosecution because of the inaction by the prosecuting attorneys. The disagreements over how
the case was being prosecuted became significant and public. The Chief of Police, Mr. Reiter,
wrote several letters to the prosecuting attorneys including a letter suggesting that the
prosecutors had a conflict of interest. In a letter to one of the alleged victims Chief Reiter wrote:
“T do not feel that justice has been sufficiently served by the indictment that has been issued.

Investigation to determine if violations of federal law have occurred.”

particular piece of alleged evidence. Significantly, the Palm Beach Police Department Property
Receipt/Search Warrant Return (Government Exhibit 295), attached as Exhibit A, is cursory, and

Palm Beach Police Department and by whom; (3) what was returned and (4) what was
purportedly transferred to the FBI. Other documents provided to the defense suggest that when
the FBI opened packages that were alleged to have contained evidence nothing was inside and
