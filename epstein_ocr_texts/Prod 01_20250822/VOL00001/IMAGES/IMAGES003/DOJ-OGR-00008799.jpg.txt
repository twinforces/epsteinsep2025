sexual abuse, but stated that “he would have answered honestly.”

Based on the foregoing, the Government believes the Court should conduct an inquiry.
See, e.g., United States v. Langford, 990 F.2d 65, 68-69 (2d Cir. 1993). The Government proposes
that the Court schedule a hearing in approximately one month, along with an appropriate schedule
for pre-hearing briefing regarding the applicable law and the scope of the hearing. The
Government respectfully submits that any juror investigation should be conducted exclusively
under the supervision of the Court. See, e.g., United States v. Gagnon, 282 F. App’x 39, 40 (2d
Cir. 2008). If the Court decides to schedule such a hearing, the Government respectfully suggests
that the Court’s staff promptly contact the juror to notify him of the hearing and inquire whether
he would like counsel to be appointed in connection with it.

The Government reached out to defense counsel last night regarding the juror’s statements,
but defense counsel have not yet responded and thus the Government is not aware of the defense
position on this issue.
