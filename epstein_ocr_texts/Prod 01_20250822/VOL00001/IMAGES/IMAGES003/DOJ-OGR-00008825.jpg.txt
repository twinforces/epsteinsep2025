are proper, and “such motions are common in this Circuit”); United States v. All Funds on
Deposit at Wells Fargo Bank, 643 F. Supp. 2d 577, 580 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (“A motion to intervene
to assert the public’s First Amendment right of access to criminal proceedings is proper.”).

The Miami Herald, as a news organization, “has a direct interest in collecting information
about a matter of public interest in order to serve its function as a purveyor of news.” See
Schiller v. City of New York, No. 04 CIV. 7921(KMK)(JC, 2006 WL 2788256, at *3 (S.D.N.Y.
Sept. 27, 2006). Additionally, the interests of the Miami Herald are not likely to overlap with the
Defendant or the Government, particularly where, as here, neither party is likely to support
unsealing. /d. Finally, intervention “for the limited purpose of challenging strictures on the
dissemination of information should not impede the progress of the [proceedings].” Jd.

Ms. Brown and the Miami Herald therefore respectfully request that they be permitted to
intervene for the limited purpose of opposing sealing of Ms. Maxwell’s motion for a new trial,
the exhibits thereto, and any additional submissions on this issue.

Il. Ms. Maxwell’s Motion for a New Trial and Exhibits Should Be Unsealed.

Ms. Maxwell’s motion for a new trial is a judicial record entitled to a presumption of public
access. Documents filed with the Court that are “relevant to the performance of the judicial
function and useful in the judicial process” are judicial documents. See United States v. Amodeo,
44 F.3d 141, 145 (2d Cir. 1995) [hereinafter “Amodeo I’’]; Brown v. Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 49 (2d
Cir. 2019). Judicial documents are subject to a presumption of public access. Amodeo I, 44 F.3d
at 146. Specifically, “[d]ocuments filed in criminal cases used to determine a litigant’s substantive
legal rights are judicial documents[,|” including motions for a new trial. United States v. Donato,
