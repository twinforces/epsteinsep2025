Instruction No. 43: Inferences

‘During the frial, and.as‘I give you-these instructions, you have heard and will’hear the

‘term. “inference.”” For instance, in.their' closing arguments, ‘the attorneys have asked ‘you to infer,

‘based.on your Treason, experience, and.common sense, from.one or more established -facts, the:

existence of some other fact. ‘I have instructed you on, circumstantial evidence ‘and that it
involves inferring a fact based on. other facts, yout reason, and commion sense.

There are times when different inferences may’be drawn ftom facts, whether‘proven. by

direct.or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks ‘you to draw one set of inferences, while

‘the defense asks. you. to draw. another. Its for you, and you. alone, to decide:what inferences you

will draw.
The, process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not'a matter of guesswork. or

speculation, An inference is a deduction or conclusion. that ‘you, the jury, are-permitted but:not

‘required to draw‘ from the facts that. have been, established by either direct or circumstantial,

evidencé.. In:drawitig inferences, you should ‘exercise your common sense.

Therefore, while you.are considering the evidence presented, to you, you, may draw, from.

‘the facts that ‘you find to be:proven, such reasonable inferences as would be justified in light of

‘your experience.

Some inferences, however, are impermissible. You may: not infer‘that:Ms. Maxwell is
guilty of participating in criminal. conduct if'you find mérely that she'was présent. at'the time the,

crime ‘was being committed and had knowledge that it was being committed.
