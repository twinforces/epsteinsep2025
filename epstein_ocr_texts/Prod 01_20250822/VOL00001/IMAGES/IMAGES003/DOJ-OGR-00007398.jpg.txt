Victims’ submissions to the EVCP did not discuss the defendant, a criminal case against the
defendant would not advance their claims.

Second, even if these subpoenas yielded marginally relevant impeachment material or
marginally inconsistent statements notwithstanding their context, such evidence would not be
admissible under Rule 403. At the November 1, 2021 conference, the defendant sought to preclude
the Government from arguing that the Minor Victims’ settlements with the EVCP reflects an
endorsement of their claims, which “would be confusing to the jury” and “open the door to an
explanation from the defense about what really happened in those proceedings,” a request to which
the Court and Government agreed. (11/01/21 Tr. at 43:7-46:3). It remains the Government’s
position that cross-examination highlighting the fact that the Minor Victims received large
settlements for their claims would not open the door to a broader discussion of the Epstein Victims
Compensation Program.

If, however, the defendant engages in significant cross-examination about what Minor
Victims did and did not say to the EVCP, and the reasons for those statements, it would create just
that confusion and open just that door. If the defendant argues that a Minor Victim should have,
but did not, make statements about the defendant to the EVCP, the Government will have to
explain to the jury the purpose of the EVCP and its adjudicative process in order to contextualize
that omission. Similarly, if the defendant argues that the Minor Victims’ testimony was biased by
some interrelationship between the EVCP and this case, the Government will have to explain to
the jury the absence of such an interrelationship, including the timeline of the Minor Victims’
statements relative to the timeline of the EVCP. Indeed, it appears that the defendant anticipates
arguing that some Minor Victims’ bias is shown by the fact that their counsel was involved in
structuring the EVCP, which would require further response from the Government about the
