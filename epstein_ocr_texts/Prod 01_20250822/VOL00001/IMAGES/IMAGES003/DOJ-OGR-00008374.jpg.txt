Re: United States‘v. Ghislaine.Maxwell,'S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)

Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this Ictter in opposition to, the defendant’s, request to
call Jack.Scarola, Brad Edwards, and. Robert Glassman—all counscl. for'victims—to testify in.the:
defendant’s case-in-chicf. Rather than. asking these attorneys about their conversations with their
clients, Which are privileged, the defendant secks to élicit testimony about those: attorneys’
conversations with.the Government. This end-run around privilege, however, would.only gencrate
irrelevant evidenee. The victims themselves. have 'testificd and been. cross-examined. about; what:
they do and do, not know or believe. There is,no, relevance to their lawyers’ conversations with,
the Government ‘when, the defendant. has failed. to establish the ‘victim’s knowledge: of those
statements, nor would testimony about those conversations, serve. as proper impeachment, ‘unless

those conversations were in.some way communicated to their clients. And that fact has not been.
