2 THE COURT: Good afternoon, everyone. This is Judge

3 Nathan.

4 We are here for a pretrial conference in this matter.
a The case is scheduled to commence the jury selection process on
6 November 4, trial to commence on November 29.

7 The primary purpose of today's conference is to go

8 over jury selection matters and logistics. I'll also address

9 the request to seal the proposed questionnaire and voir dire

10 submitted by the parties, as I indicated I would in my order

11 docketed yesterday.

12 As a preliminary matter, let me note that we are

13 proceeding telephonically today. Counsel, my view is that,

14 under Rule 43, we need not be in person with Ms. Maxwell

15 present for today's proceeding. We do have Ms. Maxwell on the
16 phone, of course. I do want to make sure counsel agree with

17 that view and have no objection to proceeding remotely by phone
18 conference today.

19 Ms. Pomerantz.
20 MS. POMERANTZ: The government has no objection, your
2l Honor.
22 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim.
23 MS. STERNHEIM: The defense has no objection. Thank
24 you.
