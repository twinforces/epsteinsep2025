exhibit and that, he recognized “many, many, many, many‘names” amongst.the entrics, including
some. of the entrics that ‘were for “massage in.Palm Beach.” Jd. at.85.1.

The Defense first objects that Mr. Alessi has no personal knowledge about the creation of
this, particular directory:and is thus incapable of authenticating the exhibit. Mr. Alessi
version he observed, but. neither his name nor his’wife’s name was in GX 52. Jd. at.853, 865.
But a document may be admitted ‘under '90.1(b)(4): even when no witness saw'the creation. of the
document-or the particular copy admitted at trial.

For ¢xaniple, in United States v..Al Farekh, 810.F. App’x 2.1 (2d Cir. 2020), the court.
affirmcd the district court’s authentication of handwritten. Ictters eventhough. no testifying
witness confirmed they had’previously examined,the letters. Instead, testimony that the
“appearance, contents, substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics” of the
letters were consistent with other'letters previously observed was sufficient to satisfy Rule 90.
Id, at.24=25. Similarly, in Zin. Yat Chin, the Second Circuit affirmed the admission of copies of
credit card reecipts despite-uncertainty:about'who signed the reccipts and'when. 371 F.3d at 38;
see also United States y. Gordon, 634 F.2d 639, 643-44 (1st Cir. 1980) (referring to
authenticated documents as “parallel documents” with distinctive characteristics such as being,
printed.on the “same: stationary,” to “indicate:a common.authorship”). :Finally, cases have
‘allowed. a, witness to authenticate emails under, Rule 901(b)(4), even. if they were not a recipient:
of the specific emiail/being admitted, when the witness had a history and ‘familiarity with the
defendant’s email communication tendencies. See, ¢.g., United States v.. Bertram, 259 F.Supp.

3d 638 (E-D. Ky. 2017); see-also United: States v.. Gasperini, 16-CR=441 (NGG), 2017 WL.
