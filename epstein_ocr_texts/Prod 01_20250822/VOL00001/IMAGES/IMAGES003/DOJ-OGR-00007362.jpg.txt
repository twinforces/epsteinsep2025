1. Specificity
The Protocol establishes a process that all claimants must follow. The “Claimant” must
submit a “Claim Form” with documentation. These claims are then evaluated based on the
criteria established in the Protocol. Any deficiencies in the claim are communicated to the
Claimant. If a claim is approved, the Administrator sends the Claimant an offer letter and a
release. Ms. Maxwell is requesting specific documents identified in the Protocol, including the
Claim Form with any supporting documentation, correspondence between the Claimant (or her
attorney) and the Administrator, a copy of the check issued to the Claimant, and a copy of the
release signed by the Claimant.
2. Admissibility
There are no evidentiary impediments to admissibility. The documents are relevant,
authentic, and an appropriate evidentiary foundation can be established under many rules of
evidence. The Claim Form is a prior statement of the Accusers about the events alleged in the S2
Indictment. The Claim Forms and subsequent communications are admissible impeachment
evidence at trial.
