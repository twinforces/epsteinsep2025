With respect to the second prong of this rule, a statement is in furtherance of a conspiracy
if it was in some way designed to promote or facilitate achievement of a goal of the conspiracy.
Under this standard, a co-conspirator statement is admissible if it “reasonably [can] be interpreted
as encouraging a co-conspirator or other person to advance the conspiracy, or as enhancing a co-
conspirator or other person’s usefulness to the conspiracy.” United States v. Tarantino, 846 F.2d
1384, 1412 (D.C. Cir. 1988). Thus, statements are in furtherance of the conspiracy if they:
(1) inform or provide an update as to the status or progress of the conspiracy, see United States v.
Desena, 260 F.3d 150, 158 (2d Cir. 2001); (2) “prompt the listener . . . to respond in a way that
promotes or facilitates the carrying out of a criminal activity,” Maldonado-Rivera, 922 F.2d at
958; (3) “seek to induce a co-conspirator’s assistance,” Desena, 260 F.3d at 158; (4) “provide
reassurance,” id.; (5) “serve to foster trust and cohesiveness,” id.; United States v. Simmons, 923
F.2d 934, 945 (2d Cir. 1991); (6) “facilitate and protect” the conspiratorial activities, United States
v. Diaz, 176 F.3d 52, 87 (2d Cir. 1999); or (7) inform a co-conspirator of “the identity and activities
of his coconspirators,” United States v. Rastelli, 870 F.2d 822, 837 (2d Cir. 1989); United States
v. Rahme, 813 F.2d 31, 36 (2d Cir. 1987).

B. Discussion

Both proffered statements are admissible as non-hearsay under the Federal Rules of
Evidence. The first exemplar qualifies as a co-conspirator statement under Rule 801(d)(2)(E), and
the second exemplar is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. Accordingly, both are
admissible at trial.
