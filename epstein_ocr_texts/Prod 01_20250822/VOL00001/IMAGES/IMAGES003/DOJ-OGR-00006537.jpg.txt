private ‘rather than, public,” which, avoids “catering” fo “sensational” interests. (Gov’t Mot. at.16
(quoting United States’. Amodco, 71 F.3d 1044, 1050.(2d Cir. 1995); United States’... Cohen, 366
F. Supp: 3d.612, 626-627 (S.D.N.¥.'2019) (alterations and. internal. quotation marks omitted)).
This, limited, sealing’ request; is significantly protective of the: interests of the: Minor Victims, who
were. sexually abused as minors, and minimally burdensome. to the public. See Paris, 2007 WL
1484974, at *2 (concluding that the interest in protecting victim, identitics outweighs the public
interest in, access to information because “the public and press ‘will be able to hear the Jane Does’
and. Minors’ testimony in full”); cf 18 U.S.C. § 3509 (d)(2) (permitting any: papers that disclose
the name of a.child'to be filed°under seal without the:necessity of'a court order). !°

Although the: defense argues ‘that this ‘request is “contrary to, well-cstablished Second.
Circuit Law” (Def. Opp. at 23), the:cases it cites concern the strong presumption in favor.of access
associated,with public dissemination.of records that-are already shared publicly at trial. See United’
635 F:2d 945, 951-52 (2d.Cir, 1980). Both cases also recognize that:no'such, presumption applics
for evidence submitted under seal, “because with respect: to that. item.of evidence, the session. of
court was not public.” Graham, 257 F.3d at 149 (quoting: Application, of ‘National Broadcasting
Co., 635: F.2d. at 952:n.4). Here, the Governmentiis not, sccking a limitation on, information shared.

‘in Open court, so these: casés arc inapposite.

'? To the extent the defense wishes fo make arguments about particular exhibits, (‘see Def. Opp. at
22.23), the Government is. happy'to address that on a document-by-document basis at trial.
