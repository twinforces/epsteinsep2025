disclosure patterns of PSYCINFO and Social Sciences Citation Index, in addition to manual searches
childhood sexual of texts published since 2000, were conducted using the search terms ‘child

abuse’ sexual abuse’, ‘sex abuse’ and ‘disclosure’.

The research to date on disclosure patterns is based on two sampling
methodologies — studies of adults reporting retrospective experiences and
studies of children. The former group of studies has the benefit of drawing
on large-scale national probability samples which can be considered to be
representative of the general population. The latter group with some small
exceptions (predominantly adolescent studies) uses samples of young people
who have disclosed sexual abuse but would not be considered as representative
of all children who have been abused:

‘children who decide to tell someone about being sexually abused and whose
cases therefore come to court are not representative of sexually abused children in general’

(Olafson and Lederman, 2006, p. 29).

Patterns of Disclosure: Delays and Non-disclosure
There is consensus in the research literature that most people who experience
‘Most people who sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when

(disclosed only during the survey) 26 per cent. Smith and colleagues (2000)
examined a sub-sample (n = 288) of the National Women’s Study in the
USA (Resnick ef al., 1993, cited in Smith et al., 2000) who had reported a
childhood rape prior to the age of 18. Smith ef al.’s findings can be
summarised as follows: immediate disclosure (within 1 month) 27 per cent,
delayed disclosure (more than a year) 58 per cent and non-disclosure (survey
only) 28 per cent. Those who had never disclosed prior to the survey constitute
comparable proportions in these two studies while the rates for immediate
