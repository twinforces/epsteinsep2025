the first time they*ve ever talked about it.

Similarly, through trainings. and readings and .in my
gradtiate program, also being taught that when ‘you maké an

assessment. it's really important, when someone is talking about

their éxperiences, to inguire of them what their experiences
were like with disclosure, because that can be so impactful.

®. In your Clinical ‘practice, have you treated and, évaluatied

patients who did not disclose’ sexual abuse they experienced. as
CHildrén but discloséd such abuse later?

A. Yes,

Q: Cdn you explain.

A. I've, as I mentioned, when, I do an, assessment. and I'm
talking with people about expericnces of Child sexual abuse,
one of the common. and important questions I will ask is: and at
the time that. this was happening 6r at Some point later, did
you share your experiences with anyone; did, you tell anyone.
And as I Said, in terms of a == in a Glinical setting, that
information is very important. We know that, the responses of
the pérson thdt they told have significant impact. oh the
adverse, potentially adverse outcomes.

Also, Of course we know that. if people dén't tell,
then that also means they Likely didn't get medical cane on
assistance at the time of the event. And that also is highly
relevant.

So I see that a lot in my clinical practice. And
