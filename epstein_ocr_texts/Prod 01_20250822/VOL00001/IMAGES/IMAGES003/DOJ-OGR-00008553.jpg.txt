Instruction No.7: Presumption of Innocence and Burden of Proof

The law presumes the defendant to. be innocent of all charges against her. Ms. Maxwell
has pleaded not. guilty to the charges in.the: Indictment. As a result, the burden iis on the
Government to prove Ms. Maxwell’s guilt/beyond.a reasonable doubt as to cach charge. This
burden never shifts:to the Defendant forthe simple reason that the law’ never imposes upon a.
defendant in.a criminal case the burden or duty of testifying, or calling any witness, or‘locating
or producing any'cvidence. In other’words, Ms. Maxwell docs. not have'to, prove! herinnocence.

This presumption ‘of innocence was with Ms. Maxwell when the trial began ‘and remains
with, Ms. Maxwell unless and-until:you-are convineed, that the Government has proven her guilt
beyond a.reasonable doubt as to cach charge. Even. though.Ms. Maxwell has presented evidence
in-her defense, the presumption of innocence remains with her and it is not-her. burden to prove
that she is innocent. Its always the Government’s burden to prove: cach, of the: clements of the

crimes charged, beyond a reasonable doubt.
