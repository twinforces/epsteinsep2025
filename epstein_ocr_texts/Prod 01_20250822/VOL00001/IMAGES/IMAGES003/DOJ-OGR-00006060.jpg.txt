Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 408 Filed 11/03/21 Page5of7
LAW OFFICES OF BOBBI C. STERNHEIAA

Little has been done to improve Ms. Maxwell’s situation, despite repeated disclosures by
counsel. Neither the Court nor the government welcomes these issues but there is no recourse
except to raise and expose Ms. Maxwell’s inappropriate conditions of confinement and the daily
problems that counsel must navigate as the sole advocates for Ms. Maxwell.

As the trial draws near, we urge the Court to release Ms. Maxwell on the extremely
restrictive conditions previously proposed and any additional conditions that the Court deems
necessary. There is no factual or legal basis to conclude that no conditions exist to ensure Ms.
Maxwell’s appearance at trial.

If Ms. Maxwell is subject to the situation she was forced to endure on April 23, 2021, the
day of her arraignment on the superseding indictment, and again yesterday, there is serious
concern that she will be further diminished physically, rendering her unable to withstand the
rigors of trial might render her incapable of attending her own trial. On April 23, she was
awakened at approximately 3:00 a.m., transported to the courthouse, kept in the cellblock from
approximately 5:00 am to approximately 2:00 p.m., when she was brought to the courtroom
holding cell. For the entire day she was provided inadequate food and liquid, was not permitted
to retain and review her legal materials and was kept shackled on a metal bench in an excessively
cold cell. This past Monday, she was awakened at 3:45 a.m. and given a brown bag with two
small apples, two small containers of milk and a cup of cereal but no utensils. She was not
permitted to bring a sweatshirt for warmth. She was transported to the courthouse by two
marshals. Her leg shackles and arm restraints prevented her from raising her feet to enter the van
upright, requiring her to climb into the van on hands and knees. She arrived at the courthouse at
° Regarding the ongoing issue concerning receipt of legal mail and disclosures from the government,
yesterday afternoon — November 2 — Ms. Maxwell received two discs and a hard drive containing many
hundreds of pages of witness materials, exhibits and other discovery mailed by the government with cover
letters dated October 26 and October 29, corresponding to the same disclosure made to counsel on
October 25 and October 28.
