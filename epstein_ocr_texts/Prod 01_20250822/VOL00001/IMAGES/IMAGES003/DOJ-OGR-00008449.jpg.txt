Cédash: 2Q20r OCS AON Demme Aréelie71e92201 Patege afd 5

At the outset, it bears noting that the public interest in viewing the parties’ presentations is
marginal. The core of closing argument is the advocacy of the attorneys, which will be available
to all persons in the courtroom, juror and member of the public alike. And a significant amount
of the material—including all of the Government’s and the vast majority of the defense's slides—
will consist of exhibits, excerpts from the transcript, and text from the jury charge. Accordingly,
little additional material would be made public through these slides: to the extent that information
should be publicly available, it already is. The parties are also likely to identify many exhibits by
number during argument, permitting any observers with copies of the key exhibits to follow along.

By contrast, counsel for both parties agree that complicated logistics—including either
binders or toggling public monitors on and off—raise significant concerns. First, they would risk
significant delay. The Court, the jury, and the parties have made efforts to complete presentation
of argument and jury instructions tomorrow. As the Court has no doubt observed during trial, the
use of binders has been time-consuming, as jurors must lift sometimes-heavy binders and flip
through them to find the correct page. In order to turn the public monitors on and off, Court staff
must manually do so in the courtroom and each overflow room. This process takes several
minutes, and the parties anticipate that it will have to occur repeatedly during the course of the
parties’ presentations.
Similarly, even in televised trials, the public may not see demonstratives used during closing
argument. Asa courtesy to the public, the parties have agreed to make the demonstratives available
for public review after closing arguments are delivered.
* The demonstratives are attorney work product, which counsel may elect not to publish during the
flow of closing argument. If the demonstratives are made public in advance of closing argument
and thereafter counsel decide not to publish certain portions, the public will have obtained
information that otherwise would not be available.
