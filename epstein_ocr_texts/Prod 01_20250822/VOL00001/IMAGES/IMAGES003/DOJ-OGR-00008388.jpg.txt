Ata conference on November ‘1, 2021, the Court, granted the Government’s motion. in
limine to permit alleged victims'to testify under pseudonyms and, as a consequence; to:redact
their real identitics from.exhibits. Nov. ‘l'Tr. at.6. That :motion:was granted for two primary
reasons. First, the Court has a.statutory duty‘to’ protect an.alleged crime victim’s “right to be
treated with fairness and with respect for the victim’s dignity:and privacy.” 18 U.S.C. §

Court further*permitted pseudonyms, for several witnesses that-were not alleged victims

the alleged victims.” /d, at’8.

there is no similar concern, as there are: for alleged victims of sexual abuse, that. denying the use
of pscudonyms will deter reports of misconduct.

It.is notable that the Defense does not cité:in support of its motion. a singlé case. in which
a.court granted the usc of pseudonyms to defense witnesses. ‘Neither docs the Government. And.
