substantially confuse and delay the trial. The éxidence
outlined in the defense"s papers, including who was interviewed
and, when, ‘what. documents were subpoenaed and other details of
investigations in two different states and different time
periods would substantially expand the scope of the trial.
Exactly what steps investigators took is not a simple question,
6f course. The government wotild likely preéesént a contrary
account of events, leading to trials within trials ‘on what law
enforcement did over the course Of ‘years. This prejudice would
substantially outweigh any minimum prebative value that might

be gained from such a far=flung endeavor.

Third, as to prejudice, the evidence would, be
cumuldtivé, démonstrdating that an ihveéstigatid6n was "Hasty" and
not thorough is at best repetitive of ‘the defense's arguments

that the govérnmént célléected insufficient evidence of guilt.

That point is made most clearly and, dimectly by focusing on the

evidence or lack 6f evidence and Credibility 6r lack 6f

credibility of the witnesses presented at trial.
The sécond piece of guidance, I can provide néw is that
the Court will, exclude much of the evidence outlined in the

defense's papérs 6f the government's alleged motives for

investigating and charging Ms. Maxwell. This evidence includes
but is not limited to the Miami Herald article, statements from
Attorney General William Barr ahd the like.

The evidence presented. by the government in this trial
