1 an example in which a judge didn't docket these materials in

3 MS. STERNHEIM: Judge, I would just respond that, yes,
4 there have been high-profile cases, but in federal court, I am
5 not aware of a high-profile case that has alleged minor
6 victims, whose identities are sought to be protected. I think
7 that this is an extraordinary case. It has garnered more media
8 attention than any of the other high-profile cases, and we are
9 urging the Court to exercise its discretion and supervisory
10 power. We will provide to the Court any authority that we have
11 on this topic at the close of business today.
12 THE COURT: We'll see about that.
13 Ms. Pomerantz.
14 MS. POMERANTZ: Thank you, your Honor.
15 In conferring with the defense about the parties'
16 joint proposed questionnaire and voir dire, the defense shared
17 concerns with the government regarding press coverage
18 prejudicing the jury selection process, and so the defense
19 asked the government to file under seal, which the government,
20 as your Honor knows, the government did. Respectfully, the
21 government submits that because this is the defense's request,
22 it is up to the defense to justify the sealing request, and the
23 government defers to the Court's judgment.
24 THE COURT: Do you continue to not oppose, or do you
25 oppose? Obviously, it's their motion, so it's their burden.
