LB1 5MAX 2:

MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, very briefly on the last
issue. I. assume that there won't be any argument by the
government or théir witnesses, ‘that they believe that they had
an. adjudication on the merits, in other words. both the victims'
compensation fund and ‘the Givil litigation, there was. no right
of confrontation, Ms. Maxwell wasn't a party to those
settlement agreement... So, to the extent ‘the government triéss
te suggest to the jury that they somehow had an adjudication,.
someone else found that their Glaims had merit, T ‘think that
would be confusing to the jury as well and I assume it would
also be deemed by this Court to open the door to an éexpldanatidén
from the defense about what really happened, in, those
proceedings:

MS. MOE: Thank you, ‘your Honor.

The government dées not intend t6 elicit ahy testinony
from the victams about beang a prevailing party in, any civil

litigation or otherwise. To the extént the gévernment elicits

any testimony about civil Litagation from the victims it would

only be in order to froht that issue for the jury in
anticipation of cross-examination along those Lines.

THE GOURT: Right.

MS. MOE: The government certainly wouldn't. be
offering that. evidence to suggest to the jury ih any way that.
those, were adjudications on the merits, nor could we, those
were Civil settlements.
