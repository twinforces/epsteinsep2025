1 MS. MENNINGER: Your Honor, very briefly on the last

2 issue. I assume that there won't be any argument by the

3 government or their witnesses that they believe that they had

4 an adjudication on the merits, in other words both the victims'
5 compensation fund and the civil litigation, there was no right
6 of confrontation, Ms. Maxwell wasn't a party to those

7 settlement agreements. So, to the extent the government tries
8 to suggest to the jury that they somehow had an adjudication,

9 someone else found that their claims had merit, I think that

10 would be confusing to the jury as well and I assume it would

11 also be deemed by this Court to open the door to an explanation
12 from the defense about what really happened in those

13 proceedings.

14 MS. MOE: Thank you, your Honor.

15 The government does not intend to elicit any testimony
16 from the victims about being a prevailing party in any civil

17 litigation or otherwise. To the extent the government elicits
18 any testimony about civil litigation from the victims it would
19 only be in order to front that issue for the jury in
20 anticipation of cross-examination along those lines.
21 THE COURT: Right.
22 MS. MOE: The government certainly wouldn't be
23 offering that evidence to suggest to the jury in any way that
24 those were adjudications on the merits, nor could we, those
25 were civil settlements.
