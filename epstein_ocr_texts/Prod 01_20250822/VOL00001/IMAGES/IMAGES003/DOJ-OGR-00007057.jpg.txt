1 pursuant to the Crime Victims Rights Act, 18 USC Section 3771,
2 to permit certain witnesses and certain non-testifying

3 witnesses to be referred to by pseudonyms. And there is also
4 the issue of redacting related exhibits that contain the names
S or specifically identifying information. Specifically, the

6 government requests that eight individuals be referred to by

7 pseudonyms or their first name.

8 The defense is already aware of the identities of all
9 of these individuals, and as the government proposes it, the
10 jury will also be aware of the individuals' real identities.
11 The request only implicates how those individuals are referred
12 to in open court.

13 This is well-tread territory, and I will grant the

14 request for the following reasons:

15 The burden to justify this type of request, of course,
16 starts with the government. It "must provide a reason for the
17 limitation." United States v. Marcus, which is 2007 WL 330388
18 at *1, an Eastern District decision citing United States v.

19 Marti, 421 F.2d 1283 (2d Cir. 1970).
20 I agree with the government that limiting disclosure
21 here would protect the alleged victims from potential
22 harassment from the media and others, undue embarrassment and
23 other adverse consequences. The Court has an obligation under
24 the Crime Victims Rights Act to take certain measures at trial
25 to protect the dignity and privacy of alleged victims. 18 USC
