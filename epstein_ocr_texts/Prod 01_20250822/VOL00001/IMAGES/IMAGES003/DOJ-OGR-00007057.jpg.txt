plrstiant to the Crime Victims, Rights Act, 18 USC Séction 3771,
tq permit certain witnesses and certain non-testifying
witnesses to bé referred to by pseudonyms. And there is also
the issue of redacting related exhibits that contain the names

or specifically identifying information. Specifically, the

government. requests that eight individuals be referred to by
pseudonyms or their first name.

The defense is already aware’ of the identities of all
of these individuals, dnd ds the government proposes it, the
jury will also be aware of the individuals' real identities,
The request only implicates héw those individuals are referred

This is well=tread territory, and I will grant the
request for the following measons:

The burdén to justify this type of request, 6f course,
starts with the government. It “must provide a reason for the
limitation." United States v. Marcus, which is 2007 WL 330388
at *1l, an Eastern District decision citing United States v.

Marti, 421 Fe2d 1283 (2d Gir. 1970).

I agree with the government, that limiting disclosure
here would prétect the alleged victims from potential
harassment from the media and others, undue embarrassment. and
other adverse consequences, The Court has an obligation undér
the Crime Victims. Rights Act. to take certain measures at trial
to protect the dignity and privacy of alleged victims. 18 USC
