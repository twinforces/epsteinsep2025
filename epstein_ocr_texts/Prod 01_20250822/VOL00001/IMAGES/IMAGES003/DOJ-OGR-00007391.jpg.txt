Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

Pursuant to the Court’s Orders at Dkt. Nos. 473, 474, and 476, the parties are docketing
today the Government’s motion to quash the defendant’s Rule 17(c) subpoena, proposed redacted
versions of the Government’s letter motion of November 18, 2021 and the defendant’s response,
and proposed redacted versions of the defendant’s response relating to Government Exhibit 52 and
the Government’s reply.

The defense has informed the Government that they are not seeking redactions to these
filings.

The Government’s proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated
by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).
Although the parties’ supplemental briefing and the Court’s Opinion & Order are judicial
documents subject to the common law presumption of access, the limited proposed redactions are
narrowly tailored to protect the privacy interests of the Minor Victims and witnesses, including
individuals who have not identified themselves on the record in this case, and who are subjects of
the Court’s pseudonym order.
