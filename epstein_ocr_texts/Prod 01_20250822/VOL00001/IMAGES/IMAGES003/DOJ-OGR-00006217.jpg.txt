As to Dr. Rocchio’s opinions, Dr., Dictz offers the following responsive opinions:

99 66s

o The: word. “grooming” “imputes motive and intent without: adequate evidence of
cither,” including to the defendant. (Ex. A. at 3).

© “[G]rooming has no: consistent: definition, and concerns have: been raised that there is
no valid. method to assess whether grooming has occurred. or ‘is occurring.” (Id, at 4
(citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).

o “Tn,any particular population.of alleged victims, patients, or plaintiffs—ineluding those:
‘whom. Dr. Rocchio has treated or cvaluated=the determination. of ‘whether grooming:
has occurred. is.a subjective judgment hinging largely on the credibility of individuals.
Such. judgments have no known error. rate and cannot be tested, verified, or
reproduced. ”

e “There is. no ‘generally accepted theory of grooming by third parties,” and. itis not.
accepted. in the relevant community. “{I]t has not.and cannot be’tested; and there is no
known or’potential rate of error.”

© ‘The notion, that. “individuals with particular vulnerabilitics are often targeted ‘by.
‘perpetrators, of sexual abuse” is “a commonly accepted bit. of clinical lore” that-is “not.
based on empirical data.”

As explained. below, the Government agrees that Dr. Dictz may offer an, opinion, on the difficulty:
of accurately’ determining’ whether an. act. constitutcs grooming, ‘in response to Dr. Rocchio.

Although.his remaining, opinions purport'to respond to Dr. Rocchio, however, they are themselves

unrcliable’ or invade’ the province of the jury, and should.be precluded.
opinions, to which the Government objects as ‘discussed herein. As:to “hindsight bias,” Dr. Dictz
opines:
© ‘Hindsight’ bias, or “the tendency to overestimate how’ predictable or foresceable an,
event.is after being informed about the outcome of'an cyent,” exists ‘and ‘has been.found,

‘In various, experiments. (Ex. Aat 4-5).

o §©Hindsight: bias “affects legal judgments.” «7d. at. 5).
