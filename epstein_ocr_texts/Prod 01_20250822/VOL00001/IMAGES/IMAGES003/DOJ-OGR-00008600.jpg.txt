Instruction No..43: Inferences

During the trial, and as I] give you these instructions, you.have heard and will hear'the
term “inference.” For instance, in their closing arguments, the attorneys have asked. you.to infer,
based on. your reason, experienec, and common,sense, from, one or more established facts, the
existence of:some other fact. 1 have itistructed you on ciréiimstantial. evidenée: and that it
involves inferring a.fact’based on other facts; ‘your:reason, and.common sense.

What is,an “inference”? What does it mean to “infer” something? An. inference ‘is notia
suspicion or. a gucss. Tt:is a:reasoned,, logical decision. to conclude that a.disputed fact exists
based on another fact that you, are satisficd-cxists.

There are times when-different, inferences. may be drawn. from:facts, whether proven by
direct or circumstantial.cvidence. The Government asks you to'draw.one sct of inferences, while
the defense, asks you to draw another. It:is‘for-you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you
will draw:

The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a matter of, guesswork or
speculation. An inference is a deduction, or conclusion that you, the jury, are permitted but not.
required to draw from the facts that have: been established by: cither direct or:circumstantial
evidence. In, drawing inferences, you. should exercise your common sense,

Therefore, whilé you are considering the evidence presented.to you, ‘you may draw, from
the facts that-you. find to be proven, such. reasonable inferences as would be justified. in light of
your experience.

Some. inferenecs, however, aré impermissible. You may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is
guilty of participating in, criminal conduct if you find merely that she was present at the time th

crime was being committed and.had knowledge that it was being committed.
