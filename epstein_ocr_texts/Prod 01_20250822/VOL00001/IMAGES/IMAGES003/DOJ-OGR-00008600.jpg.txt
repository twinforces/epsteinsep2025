Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document563 Filed 12/18/21 Page 62 of 167

1 Instruction No. 43: Inferences

Zz During the trial, and as I give you these instructions, you have heard and will hear the

3 term “inference.” For instance, in their closing arguments, the attorneys have asked you to infer,

4 based on your reason, experience, and common sense, from one or more established facts, the

5 existence of some other fact. I have instructed you on circumstantial evidence and that it

6 involves inferring a fact based on other facts, your reason, and common sense.

7 What is an “inference”? What does it mean to “infer” something? An inference is not a

8 suspicion or a guess. It is a reasoned, logical decision to conclude that a disputed fact exists

9 based on another fact that you are satisfied exists.
10 There are times when different inferences may be drawn from facts, whether proven by
11. direct or circumstantial evidence. The Government asks you to draw one set of inferences, while
12 the defense asks you to draw another. It is for you, and you alone, to decide what inferences you
13. will draw.
14 The process of drawing inferences from facts in evidence is not a matter of guesswork or
15 speculation. An inference is a deduction or conclusion that you, the jury, are permitted but not
16 required to draw from the facts that have been established by either direct or circumstantial
17 _ evidence. In drawing inferences, you should exercise your common sense.
18 Therefore, while you are considering the evidence presented to you, you may draw, from
19 the facts that you find to be proven, such reasonable inferences as would be justified in light of
20 —‘-your experience.
21 Some inferences, however, are impermissible. You may not infer that Ms. Maxwell is
22 ~~ guilty of participating in criminal conduct if you find merely that she was present at the time the
23s crime was being committed and had knowledge that it was being committed.
