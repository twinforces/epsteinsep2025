patients are telling the truth when they claim to have been abused. See Ex. 1, p 7 (“Studies
concerming the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the assertions made by
Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated allegations and are also otherwise
relevant here.”). Because, in Dr. Dietz’s opinion, Dr. Rocchio does not make sufficient
allowance for the potential that her patients are not telling the truth, the jury is entitled to know
how and why that analytical flaw undermines her opinions. As even the government concedes,
Mot. at 9, “the jury, and not the trial court, should decide among the conflicting views of
different experts.” Jn re Fosamax Prod. Liab. Litig., 645 F. Supp. 2d 164, 173 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)
(quoting Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 153 (1999)).

Moreover, Dr. Dietz’s opinions are directly relevant to evaluate the nature and timing of
the disclosures by the alleged victims in this case. As Dr. Rocchio admitted during her testimony
at her Daubert hearing, there are numerous reasons why a report of sexual assault might not
surface immediately, including the various pathways to a false allegation identified by Dr. Dietz.
Ex. 2, p 153-54.

Nor are Dr. Dietz’s opinions unreliable, as the government claims. Mot. at 20-21. First,
Dr. Rocchio essentially admitted they were reliable during her testimony. Ex. 2, p 153-54.

Second, if Dr. Dietz’s reliance on the Engle and O’Donohue article weren’t enough
(which it is), Dr. Dietz will testify as well based on his extensive clinical experience. In his own
practice, he has personally seen ten of the eleven pathways to false allegations identified by
Engle & O’Donohue. Dr. Dietz thus could reliably offer these opinions even if the absence of the
article. See Fed. R. Evid. 702, Advisory Committee Notes, 2000 Amendments. (“Nothing in this
[rule] is intended to suggest that experience alone--or experience in conjunction with other
knowledge, skill, training or education--may not provide a sufficient foundation for expert
