concerming the accurate reporting of alleged sexual assaults undermine the assertions made by
Dr. Rocchio to the extent they are based on uncorroborated. allegations and are also otherwise
relevant here:”). Because, in,Dr. Dictz’s opinion, Dr. Rocchio docs not make sufficient
allowanec for the potential 'that-her patients are not telling the-truth, ‘the jury is entitled to, know
how'and why that analytical flaw undermines her opinions. As even the government concedes,
Mot. at.9, “the jury, and. not-the trial court, should decide among the conflicting views, of
different experts.” Jn. re.losamax Prod. Liab, Litig.,645 F. Supp..2d 164,173 (S.D.N.Y. 2009)

Ex. 2,'p 153-54.

Nor are Dr. Dictz’s, opinions unreliable, as the government claims. Mot. at.20-21. First,

(which it 'is),; Dr. Dictz ‘will testify as well based on his extensive clinical experience. In.his own
practice, he:has personally seen. ten ofthe cleven. pathways to false: allegations identified. by
Engle .& O’ Donohue. ‘Dr: Dictz thus could. reliably offer these opinions cven if the absence of the
article. See Fed. R. Evid. 702, Advisory Committee Notes, 2000 Amendments. (“Nothing in this
