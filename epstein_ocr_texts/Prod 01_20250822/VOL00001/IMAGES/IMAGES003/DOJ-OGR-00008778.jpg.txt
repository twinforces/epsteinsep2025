Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document565_ Filed 12/19/21 Page 72 of 83
] Instruction No. 52: Use of Evidence from Searches
2 You have heard testimony about evidence seized in connection with certain searches
3 conducted by law enforcement officers. Evidence obtained from these searches was properly
4 admitted in this case, and may be properly considered by you. Such searches were appropriate
5 law enforcement actions. Whether you approve or disapprove of how the evidence was obtained
6 should not enter into your deliberations, because I instruct you that the Government’s use of the
7 evidence is entirely lawful. You must, therefore, regardless of your personal opinions, give this
8 evidence full consideration along with all the other evidence in the case in determining whether
9 the Government has proven the Defendant’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. As with all
10 evidence, it is for you to determine what weight, if any, to give such evidence.
