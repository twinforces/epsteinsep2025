Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 444 _ Filed 11/12/21 Page/7of21

with the requested massages, and during those massages, Epstein

sexually abused [Accuser-3]. MAXWELL was aware that Epstein

engaged in sexual activity with [Accuser-3] on multiple occasions,

including at times when [Accuser-3] was under the age of 18,

including in the context of a sexualized massage.
See Indictment (Dkt. 001) 4 7(c); S1 Superseding Indictment (Dkt. 017) § 7(c). Both indictments
also alleged the following as an overt act of the charged conspiracies: “Between in or about 1994
and in or about 1995, when [Accuser-3] was under the age of 18, MAXWELL encouraged
[Accuser-3] to provide massages to Epstein in London, England, knowing that Epstein intended
to sexually abuse [Accuser-3] during those massages.” See Indictment (Dkt. 001) 44 11(d),
17(d); S1 Superseding Indictment (Dkt. 017) 99 11(d), 17(d).

Superseding Indictment (Dkt. 146) at 1-3, 6-9. Ms. Maxwell noted that (1) according to
Accuser-3’s own allegations, she was above the legal age of consent in the United Kingdom (16
years old) when the sex acts supposedly took place and therefore any sex acts that occurred were
lawful and could not be considered “sexual abuse”; and (2) the indictment did not allege any
travel by Accuser-3, in interstate or foreign commerce or otherwise, let alone as a result of any
action taken by Ms. Maxwell or Epstein, which was a critical element of both charged
conspiracies. /d. at 4-5.

In its opposition, the government scrambled to paper over these problems by providing a
much fuller proffer of Accuser-3’s expected testimony. See Gov’t Mem. in Opp. to Def.’s
Pretrial Motions (Dkt. 204) at 158-59 & n.56. The government attempted to defend its use of the
phrase “sexual abuse” by asserting that the description was “factually accurate” because
