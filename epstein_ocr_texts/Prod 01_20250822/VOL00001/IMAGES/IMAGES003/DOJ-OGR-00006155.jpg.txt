Stipulations
[If Applicable]
In this case you have heard evidence in the form of stipulations.
A stipulation of testimony is an agreement among the parties that, if called, a witness
would have given certain testimony. You must accept as true the fact that the witness would
have given the testimony. However, it is for you to determine the effect or weight to give
that testimony.
You also heard evidence in the form of stipulations that contain facts that were agreed to
be true. In such cases, you must accept those facts as true.
