Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 442 Filed 11/12/21 Page 10 of 12

Indictment. It is hard to imagine how an adult women fixing up single adult:males with adult
females is "direct evidence" of a conspiracy to'transport, cntice or traffic minors for scxual
abuse.

As to the witness referenced in'the Letter, the Letter makes clear that the witness worked.
for Mr. Epstcin from[____]..affer the conclusion of the charged conspiracy in: 2004. Given.the
timing of her'stated. employment, it also begs the question;how her testimony, reference to
‘unspecified documents or scheduling’ of ‘unspecified massages, “among other things,” could be
direct evidence of'a conspiracy-that:ended.a year carlicr.

But because Ms., Maxwell has had insufficient time to ‘investigate these newly-disclosed.
‘materials, she is unable to file a motion challenging their admissibility at. this timc. The emails
involve:two persons not interviewed by the: Government, so there is no interview memo to
corroborate their content. At:least:two of the potential. witnesses are foreign nationals who live
abroad. Ms. Maxwell. will need time to contact and interview them. As'to the newly disclosed
witness, the Government produced on, October 12, 202.1 approximately:400 pages of interview
reports, notes, documents, and. other materials related to that’witness. Ms. Maxwell is‘unable to
review, investigate, or rebut the admissibility of all of the referenced materials: bythe October

18, 2021 due date for motions in Jimine, and:requests an additional two weeks to file her brief
addressing the-proffered.404(b) evidence.
CONCLUSION
The Government has been:on notice ofthe amendments to.-Rule 404(b) since.at least.

January 25,2021. See Dkt. 146 at;10.' The Government'was prepared to disclose their‘Rule

' Indeed, the Government argued in their-response to Ms. Maxwell's pretrial motions that certain evidence
pertaining to Accuser-3 would be admissible under Rtile 404(b); ‘yet the deadline to, provide Notice of an
intent to offer that evidence at‘trial under the rule_has come‘and gone, See. Dkt. 204 at 165-169. Ms.
Maxwell today moves separately-to exclude the evidence:pertaining to Accuser-3.
