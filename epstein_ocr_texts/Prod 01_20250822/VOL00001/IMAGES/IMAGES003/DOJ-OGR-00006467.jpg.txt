no authority indicating that, more is required. Indeed, the government’s demand for a proffer is
nothing more than an attempt to force the defense to spell. out exactly what: it. plans to, ask the
case agents and. reveal its defense strategy. The Court should reject this demand.

MISGUIDED AND.MERITLESS

The government:moves to’ preclude the defense from cliciting evidence and argument
“regarding the government’s supposed:motives for:prosccuting Ms. Maxwell, including evidence:
of Jeffrey Epstein’s 2019 death and .the:timing of charges against the defendant.” ‘Mot. at 34.
Once again, the government’s motion reaches too far‘and should be denied.

First, as the government points out, challenges to the prosecutors’ motives are typically

brought by raising claims of “vindictive prosecution,” “selective prosecution,” or “outrageous
government. conduct,” which must. be resolved by the court, not:the jury... See United States v.
Regan, 103 F.3d 1072, 1082 (2d. Cir. 1997); United States v. Farhane, 634 F.3d 127, 167 (2d Cir.
201.1). ‘But the defense ‘is not raising any. of those claims. Simply arguing to the’ jury. that the
government substituted Ms. Maxwell for Jeffrey Epstcin after his death docs not, imply that the
prosecution was the result ofthe government’s. “animus toward the defendant” (vindictive
prosecution), or was.“motivated by a discriminatory purpose” (selective’prosccution), or was so
outrageous that “duc process. considerations” must bar the: prosecution. (outrageous government
conduct), See United States v: Avenatti, 433 F, Supp. 3d.552, 562-53. (S.D.N.Y. 2020); United
States Vv. Sanders, 211 F.3d. 711;'716=17 (2d Cir. 2000); United: States v.. Cervelo, 949 F.2d 559,
Second, for the:reasons set forth above, the defense is entitled to clicit. evidence of
Epstcin’s death and'the timing ofthe. charges against Ms. Maxwell to, challenge the'thoroughness

and reliability of the:government’s investigation. Kyles, 514 U.S. at 445-46; Bowen, 799 F:2d at
