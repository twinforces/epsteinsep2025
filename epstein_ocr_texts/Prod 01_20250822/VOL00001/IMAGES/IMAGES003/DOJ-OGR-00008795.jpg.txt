The jury note indicates that the jury is confused about the second element.of Count Four,
and, by extension, the third element.of Count Two. Both counts require an intent.to violate New
York: law ‘and cannot be based on any conduct that allegedly occurred in New Mexico (or any’
other state: besides.New York). The court’s answer to the jury’s.question.permits the jury'to
convict Ms. Maxwell, on, Count, Four based, on alleged conduct occurring in. New Mexico—aiding
‘in a return ‘flight. from New Mexico. Not only is that. conduct not:charged in the: indictment (sce
discussion above), it also is not illegal under’ New York:law. Under‘New Y.ork law, an intent:to
engage ‘in sexual activity in any other state cannot ‘form the basis for a. violation of New York law,
as charged in Counts Two arid.Four. See People v. Carvajal, 6 N.Y 3d 305, 3.12 (2005) (“CPL-
20.20[] has codified the ‘general principle that, for NewYork to exercise criminal jurisdiction,
‘some alleged conductor a consequence of that conduct:must have occurred in the state.”). Ifthe
defendant disputes the: evidence ‘of the State’s prosccutorial authority:at trial, “the trial court.
should.charge the’ jury. that jurisdiction must be’proven beyond.a, reasonable doubt.” People v.

Mél.aiighlin, 80 N.Y 24,466, 472 (N.Y. 1992).
