prejudice to the defendant, as the instruction makes clear to the jury that the identities of the
witnesses are being protected from the public and press only, and that the true names of the
witnesses are known to the Government, the Court, and the defendant.
IV. Sealed and Redacted Exhibits

The Government anticipates offering certain exhibits entirely under seal or with redactions
to protect the personal identifying information of witnesses and third parties. With respect to
logistics, the Government would propose submitting redacted versions of exhibits — along with an
index noting which of the Government exhibits will be offered under seal — no later than November
29, 2021. To the extent the defense takes issue with the sealing requests or the proposed redactions,
the Court may rule on those exhibits on case-by-case basis during the trial.

The Government has considered how best to publish sealed exhibits to the jury while
protecting the identities of witnesses and the privacy of third parties. On that score, the
Government is mindful that exhibits published in electronic format on screens in the courtroom
may be seen by the public, since the screens at counsel table — and potentially the jury box— are
visible to the public from certain angles. For this reason, the Government requests permission to
provide jurors with individual binders containing sealed exhibits. The Government expects that
jurors will follow the Court’s instruction to only view items in the binder when the Court instructs
jurors to do so.
