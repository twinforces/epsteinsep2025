Background: Delayed disclosure of rape has been associated with impaired mental health; it is, therefore, important
to understand which factors are associated with disclosure latency. The purpose of this study was to compare
various demographics, post rape characteristics, and psychological functioning of early and delayed disclosers
(i.e., more than 1 week post rape) among rape victims, and to determine predictors for delayed disclosure.
Methods: Data were collected using a structured interview and validated questionnaires in a sample of 323
help seeking female adolescents and young adults (12 25 years), who were victimized by rape, but had no
reported prior chronic child sexual abuse.
Results: In 59% of the cases, disclosure occurred within 1 week. Delayed disclosers were less likely to use medical
services and to report to the police than early disclosers. No significant differences were found between delayed
and early disclosers in psychological functioning and time to seek professional help. The combination of
age category 12 17 years [odds ratio (OR) 2.05, confidence intervals (CI) 1.13 3.73], penetration (OR 2.36,
CI 1.25 4.46), and closeness to assailant (OR 2.64, CI 1.52 4.60) contributed significantly to the prediction
of delayed disclosure.
Conclusion: The results point to the need of targeted interventions that specifically encourage rape victims to
disclose early, thereby increasing options for access to health and police services.
