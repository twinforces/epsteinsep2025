1 THE COURT: Can you repeat that, please.

2 MS. POMERANTZ: The first two sentences of that

ke paragraph starting with "currently" and ending with "has

4 occurred or is occurring."

5 THE COURT: Thank you.

6 BY MS. POMERANTZ:

7 Q. Dr. Rocchio, what is your response to those two sentences?
8 A. Again, I think that I would not agree with those

) conclusions. I also think it's important to recognize that

10 this article was published many years ago. And there's

11 certainly been evolutions and additional literature since the
12 time of publication. But even at the time of publication, I

13 think it's a little misleading. If they're defining consensus
14 there as universal agreement as to exact -- everything within
15 the process of grooming, then sure. But when we're talking

16 about any pattern of behavior or any phenomenon within the

17 social science, it's a complicated phenomenon. You're never

18 going to get universal agreement among experts. That's why you
19 have to look at what's the particular definition used within a
20 study.
21 But most definitely, there's consensus within the
22 scientific literature about the phenomenon not only of
23 grooming, but the phenomenon of child sexual abuse itself, what
24 the experiences are of the victim and what the behaviors are of
25 the offender and also the impact of those behaviors, in terms
