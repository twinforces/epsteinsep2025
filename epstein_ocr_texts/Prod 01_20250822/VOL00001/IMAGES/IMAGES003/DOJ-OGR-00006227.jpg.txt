the case—is not supported by the literature, that terminological claim is of course irrelevant to any
issue. To the extent that Dr. Dietz purports to claim that there is no authority supporting the notion
that a perpetrator can groom a victim for the purpose of making the victim engage in sexual
activities with others, this claim is patently unreliable, as Dr. Rocchio will explain at the Daubert
hearing; there is in fact ample literature on the pimp-prostitute relationship and other instances in
which third parties groom an individual for the benefit of someone else. And if the Court excludes
Dr. Rocchio’s opinion on this issue, Dr. Dietz’s opinion is irrelevant.

The Government acknowledges that Dr. Dietz can offer reliable, relevant opinions in
response to Dr. Rocchio. But Dr. Dietz’s proposed opinions include legal argument, opinions that
invade the province of the jury, and opinions that are themselves unreliable. Those should be
excluded.

2. Opinions as to Hindsight Bias

Dr. Dietz’s opinions that hindsight bias exists and should “temper” conclusions about
whether to impute knowledge to an individual (Ex. A at 5) do not convey any relevant information
beyond the ken of the average juror and are not helpful to the jury. Instead, they are a virtually
unprecedented attempt to psychoanalyze the jurors and to supplant both their role as judges of the
facts and the Court’s role in instructing them.

point suffered from hindsight bias. The primary purpose of the testimony is to convince the jurors
to “temper” any conclusion that the defendant formed the requisite intent because the jurors might
be suffering from hindsight bias. (Ex. A at 5). Of course a factfinder should not confuse the
