Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document.465 Filed 11/15/21. Page.53 of 127 53

LB1 5MAX 2:

to seméething alleged in the indictment doesn't Change ‘the

801 (d) (2) (B) analysis. and that is. it has to be made in the
course of and in furtherance of a conspiracy. So post-event
statements that don't have anything to do with furtherance ‘of
the corspiracy are simply Hearsay and inadmissible.

I think that's a pretty simple proposition, your
Honor »

MS, MOE: Your Honor, among ether reasons why we! would
like time to think about this, further dnd address it in more
detail, is that Rule 801(d) (2) (E) is not limited to the charged
conspiracy at trial, a statement said inh furtherance 6f tHe
conspinacy even if it is not the charged conspiracy. And so we
would want to think tHtough that as well. And we would also
want, to think through, even if a statement ds offened by a,
cé=conspirator, whether it is being offered under Rule

801 (dad) (2): (E) at all. And so we would just ask, for additional.

time to think thr6ugh that to maké sure we give an accurate and
thorough representation to the Count.

THE GOURT: So, I will stick with the process and
schedule that I have indicated but I do think we will separate
out Statements that post=date the conspiracy as charged in the
indictment and the government will indicate grounds for the
specifie introduction of any of those ahticipated statements.
OK, Ms. Moe?

MS. ‘MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank, you.
