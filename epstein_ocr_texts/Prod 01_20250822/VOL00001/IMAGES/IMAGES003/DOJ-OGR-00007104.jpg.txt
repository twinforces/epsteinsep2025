1 to something alleged in the indictment doesn't change the

2 801(d) (2) (E) analysis and that is it has to be made in the

3 course of and in furtherance of a conspiracy. So post-event

4 statements that don't have anything to do with furtherance of

5 the conspiracy are simoly hearsay and inadmissible.

6 I think that's a pretty simple proposition, your

7 Honor.

8 MS. MOE: Your Honor, among other reasons why we would
9 like time to think about this further and address it in more

10 detail, is that Rule 801(d) (2) (E) is not limited to the charged
11 conspiracy at trial, a statement said in furtherance of the

12 conspiracy even if it is not the charged conspiracy. And so we
13 would want to think through that as well. And we would also

14 want to think through, even if a statement is offered by a

15 co-conspirator, whether it is being offered under Rule

16 801(d) (2) (E) at all. And so we would just ask for additional
17 time to think through that to make sure we give an accurate and
18 thorough representation to the Court.

19 THE COURT: So, I will stick with the process and
20 schedule that I have indicated but I do think we will separate
21 out statements that post-date the conspiracy as charged in the
22 indictment and the government will indicate grounds for the
23 specific introduction of any of those anticipated statements.
24 OK, Ms. Moe?
25 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor. Thank you.
