Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document576 Filed 01/14/22 Page2of2

Finally, in an abundance of caution, the Court assumes that while these issues are being
briefed and resolved the parties are in full compliance with the law of the Second Circuit
requiring notice and the Court’s permission before any contact with jurors. See United States v.
Schwarz, 283 F.3d 76, 98 (2d Cir. 2002) (requiring notice to the court and opposing counsel and
that “post-trial questioning of jurors must only be conducted under the strict supervision and
control of the court” (quoting United States v. Brasco, 516 F.2d 816, 819 n.4 (2d Cir. 1975))).
Any failure to abide by that precedent must be reported to the Court immediately.

SO ORDERED.
