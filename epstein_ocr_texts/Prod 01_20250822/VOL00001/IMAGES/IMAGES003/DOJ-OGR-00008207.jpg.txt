conversation she had just months ago.”

Ms. Maxwell from pursuing this line of cross-cxamination. First, the attorney-client ‘privilege
does not apply. to: Mr. Glassman’s statement-to Jane. that cooperating and testifying would “help
her case.” Second, even if the privilege did apply, it was ‘waived when Mr. Glassman relayed his

client and counsel that (2). was intended to be and was iin fact. kept confidential, and (3y was made
for the purpose of obtaining, or providing legal. advice.” Jn re County of Erie, 473 F.3d 413, 419:

‘Cir. 1989). In this:case, the party asserting: the privilege: is the government on behalf of'Janc.

coopération and testimony would “help her case” is not ‘protected by the attorney-client privilege
because: “it was [not] .intended.to be . . . kept confidential.” £rie, 473 F.3d.at.419. We know this

examination), and Jane'would want'the. government to know, why she chose. to cooperate and to

testify'against Ms, Maxwell. 1 McCormick: on,Evid., § 91 (“Wherever'the: matters communicated
