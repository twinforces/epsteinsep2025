Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 410-1 Filed 11/04/21 Page 68 of 93
this trial, then you should bear that factor in mind when evaluating the credibility of his or her
testimony and accept it with great care. This is not to suggest that any witness who has an
interest in the outcome of a case would testify falsely. It is for you to decide to what extent, if at
all, the witness’s interest has affected or colored his or her testimony.

You are not required to accept testimony even though the testimony is not contradicted
and the witness’s testimony is not challenged. You may decide because of the witness’s bearing
or demeanor, or because of the inherent improbability of the testimony, or for other reasons
sufficient to yourselves that the testimony is not worthy of belief. On the other hand, you may
find, because of a witness’s bearing and demeanor and based upon your consideration of all the
other evidence in the case, that the witness is truthful.

Thus, there is no magic formula by which you can evaluate testimony. You bring to this
courtroom all your experience and common sense. You determine for yourselves in many
circumstances the reliability of statements that are made by others to you and upon which you
are asked to rely and act. You may use the same tests here that you use in your everyday lives.
You may consider the interest of any witness in the outcome of this case and any bias or
prejudice of any such witness, and this is true regardless of who called or questioned the witness.

Adapted from the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United States
v. Jones, 16 Cr. 553 (AJN) and in United States v. Pizarro, 17 Cr. 151
