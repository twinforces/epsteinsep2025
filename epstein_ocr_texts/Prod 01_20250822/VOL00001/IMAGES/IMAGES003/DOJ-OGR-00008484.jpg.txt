Instruction. No. 20: Count Four: Transportation of a Minor to Engage in Illegal ‘Sexual
Activity:— First Element

The first element of Count Four which ‘the Government:must prove beyond a reasonable.
doubt. is that Ms. Maxwell knowingly ‘transported Jane in interstate or'foreign commierce, as
alleged in the Indictment. The phrase, “transport an individual in interstate or foreign. commerce”

means fo move or carry, or cause someone to be moved or. carried, from one’ state! to ‘another or.

between the United States and a foreign country.

The Government. does'not have to prove that, Ms. Maxwell personally transported. Jane
across a state line. It.is sufficient’to satisfy this element. that. Ms. Maxwell was actively engaged,

either personally or through an agent, in.the: making of the travel. arrangements, such.as by

‘purchasing‘tickets necessary ‘for Jane to travel as planned.

Ms. Maxwell must have knowingly transported, of causéd the transportation of, Jane, in

interstate commerce. This means ‘thatthe Government:must prove that Ms. Maxwell. knew both.

‘that. she ‘was, causing Jane to be transported, ‘and. that; Jane was being transported. in interstate.

commerce. .As I have explained, an act is:done knowingly when. it is done voluntarily and
intentionally and.not because of accident, mistake or some innocent,reason.

It is'the Defendant’s intent‘that: matters here. If the Government establishes each, of the.
elements of this: crime beyond a reasonable doubt, then the Defendant is guilty of this charge

whether or not the individual agreed or consented to cross state lines.
