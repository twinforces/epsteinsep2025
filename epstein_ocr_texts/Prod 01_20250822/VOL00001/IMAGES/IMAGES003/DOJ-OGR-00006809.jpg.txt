gym shoes with her mother’s consent generally would not. A criticism of this
definition is that “appropriate” behaviors may be used by some perpetrators
to groom (e.g., buying a poor child gym shoes may still be performed to
gain the child’s trust to eventually abuse her). However, because this behav-
ior can be entirely unrelated to abuse and because the assessment ought to
strive to minimize false positives, we have chosen to require that all groom-
ing behaviors be inappropriate in and of themselves. Second, we recognize
that not all inappropriate behaviors ought to be considered grooming—an
adult offering cigarettes to a child may be inappropriate but in addition we
narrow the class of these inappropriate behaviors to those that are related to
increasing the probability of sexual contact.

It is important to note that there may be instances in which the question-
able behavior falls in some gray area between grooming and nongrooming.
For example, a father buying his daughter a bikini may or may not be con-
sidered inappropriate. Unless more details are known about the context of
this purchase (perhaps it was just impossible for the mother or some other
female to do this and the need for a bathing suit was urgent), one could
explicate reasonable arguments that the behavior is and is not representa-
tive of grooming. The most logical judgment to come to, then, is that this
behavior is an indeterminate case and that it is unclear whether it should be
considered grooming.

Arguments also need to be made regarding the second criterion of
the definition: whether the function of the inappropriate behavior was to
increase the likelihood of abuse in the future. Interpreting behavior and the
intentions of a person performing a behavior is admittedly complex. The
rational appraisal of behavior involves setting up a universe of plausible
interpretations and gathering evidence in the individual case to rule in or
rule out each. As an example, if a male neighbor has a pool and buys a
bikini for a five-year-old girl to come over to swim and has her change into
the bikini at his house while they are alone (the purchase of the bikini and
having her change in his house without her guardian present would be con-
sidered inappropriate and thus meet the first criterion of the definition), the
set of major plausible interpretations regarding the function of the behavior
include:

1. Buying a bikini for the girl was the only way to allow the child to engage
in the appropriate activity of swimming. Changing at his house was the
only way to have the child dressed appropriately for swimming. These
facts do not function to set the occasion for abuse to occur.

2. Buying a bikini and having the child change alone is not appropriate
as there are more appropriate, prudent alternatives. In addition, bikinis
can be thought of as sexualized clothing and changing alone without a
guardian present is also a boundary violation. For example, giving money
to the child’s guardian to buy whatever bathing suit the guardian thought
