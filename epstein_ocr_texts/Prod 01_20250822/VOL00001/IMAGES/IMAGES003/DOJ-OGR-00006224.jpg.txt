Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 424 Filed 11/08/21 Page13 of 41
(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 14, 2012) (collecting cases); see, e.g., Highland Capital Mgmt. v. Schneider, 551
F. Supp. 2d 173, 182-183, 187 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).

Finally, expert opinion should not be offered where it does not fit the facts of the case.
“Expert testimony which does not relate to any issue in the case is not relevant and, ergo, non-
helpful.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 591 (internal quotation marks omitted); cf Boucher v. U.S. Suzuki
Motor Corp., 73 F.3d 18, 21 (2d Cir. 1996) (“expert testimony should be excluded if itis . . . [inter
alia] in essence an ‘apples and oranges comparison’” (quoting Shatkin v. McDonnell Douglas
Corp., 727 F.2d 202, 208 (2d Cir.1984))); see also LVL XII Brands, Inc. v. Louis Vuitton Malletier
S\A., 209 F. Supp. 3d 612, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 2016) (expert opinion inadmissible where it is “a
mismatch for the facts” of the case).

C. Discussion

1. Response to the Opinions of Dr. Rocchio

Although some opinions by Dr. Dietz respond to Dr. Rocchio, each opinion must itself be
reliable and relevant, as required by Rule 702. See Yousef, 327 F.3d at 148. The Government
agrees that at least one of these opinions can meet this test: it is “within the range where experts
might reasonably differ,” Kumho Tire Co., 526 U.S. at 153, and can be tested through “[v]igorous
cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of
proof.” Daubert, 509 U.S. at 596. Specifically, the Government agrees that Dr. Dietz can respond
to Dr. Rocchio’s testimony about grooming behaviors by suggesting that grooming does not have
one settled definition. See 2/25/20 Tr. at 36:13-37:14, United States v. Randall, No. 19 Cr. 131
(PAE) (S.D.N.Y.) (explaining that, in such a case, “the jury, not the trial court, should be the one
to decide among conflicting experts”).
