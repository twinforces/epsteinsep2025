The government. devotes only: a single paragraph to:cxplaining why Accuscr-3’s evidence:
is admissible as direct evidence of the sex trafficking conspiracy charged. in Count Five. See
November 5 Ltr. at 6-7. The few reasons the government does give are meritless. The
government starts by asserting that Accuser-3’s evidence is admissible to. prove the sex. trafficking
conspiracy for the. samc reasons that it is. admissible to, prove the Mann Act conspiracies — reasons
which the Court has already rejected. See id. at.6. The government then.makes the puzzling
assertion that Accuser-3’s evidence is‘admissible because it “demonstrates the reasons fora, co-
Conspirator’s participation. in the conspiracy.” Jd. Specifically, the government asserts that the
evidence shows that (1) “minors'‘who gave sexualizced massages to Epstein were compensated,”
which the government: contends is proof that Ms: Maxwell and Epstein “recruited. and enticed. girls
to engage in commercial sex acts”; and (2) “Epstein:was. sexually attracted to. girls of a certain age,
typically under the age of eighteen,” which the: government contends is’proof that Ms.. Maxwell.
and Epstein engaged. in sex trafficking of minors ‘under the age of cighteen. /d. at 6-7.

These arguments are misguided and.unpersuasive. First, neither of the two specific bases
for admission speaks to ““‘the:reasons for” Ms. Maxwell’s alleged participation in the sex
arc legally and factually flawed.
