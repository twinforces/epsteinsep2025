1 cross-examination should not include specifically identifying

2 information, and counsel must act responsibly doing so. If,

3 after good faith effort in that regard is made and the defense
4 at some point feels they have hit a wall and can articulate a

5 specific need with respect to a particular line of questioning,
6 they can reraise the issue with opposing counsel and with me.

7 So that's my ruling on that motion. That said, I do

8 strongly encourage the government to speak candidly with the

9 anticipated witnesses so that they're clear eyed about what

10 this process will entail, the fact that cross-examination will
11 not be curtailed beyond the specific identifying information

12 that form the basis of the government's request, and the

13 possibility that despite these measures their identities may

14 become known and revealed to the public.

15 Should any of those witnesses or the government choose
16 not to proceed by pseudonym, the government shall let defense
17 counsel and the Court know. In the meantime, the government

18 and defense counsel shall confer about names that will be used
19 and any additional process for facilitating the clear
20 presentation of evidence. The Court will adopt a clear and
21 straightforward approach and the parties are admonished to come
22 to agreement on the use of pseudonyms and/or first names.
23 First assignment, there will be others, by November 10
24 the parties shall submit a joint letter to the Court under seal
25 explaining the nomenclature that they propose be employed with
