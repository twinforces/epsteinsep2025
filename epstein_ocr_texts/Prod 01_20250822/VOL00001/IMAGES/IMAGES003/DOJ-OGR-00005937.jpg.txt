mental. health outcomes. This‘paper reviews:the research on disclosure patterns:
of childhood sexual abuse, Specifically delays in disclosure, non-disclosure.
(as: evident: through adult retrospective ‘studics) ‘and partial disclosures, and:
discusses implications for practice. ‘Literature searches of the: online databases:
PSYCINFO-and Social. Sciences Citation Index, in-addition.to manual searches:
of texts published since 2000, were conducted ‘using the search terms ‘child.
sexual, abuse’, “sex. abuse” aid ‘disclosure’.

The research: to date on disclosure patterns is based on two sampling
methodologies — studies of adults reporting retrospective ‘experiences and
studies of children. The former group of studies: has the benefit of drawing
on large-scale national probability samples ‘which can be considered to be.

‘representative of the general population. The latter group with some small,

exceptions (predominantly adolescent ‘studics) uses samples of young, people
who. have disclosed ‘sexual abuse but would not be considered as representative
ofall children, who have been abused:

‘childtén Who decide ‘to. tell SomeGne .Abour ‘beine sexually. Abused. and. Whose
cases therefore:come to Court are.not representative: of sexually abused -children in general”
(Olatsom and Lederman, 2006, p./29).

Patterns of Disclosure: Delays‘and Non-disclosure:

There is ‘consensus in the: research literature that most people who experience
sexual abuse in childhood do not disclose this abuse until adulthood, and when:

results can’be: summarised as follows: immediate disclosure (within 1 month).
