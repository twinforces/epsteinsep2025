alleged scheme to cause minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, or her knowledge of the
same. See Mot. at 11. Nor is the evidence of alleged “grooming” sufficiently unique to qualify
as proof of “modus operandi.” See id. at 12. Furthermore, there is a strong likelihood that the
jury will assume that Epstein’s alleged sex acts with were illegal and will
misapply that evidence in evaluating Ms. Maxwell’s guilt or innocence to the charged Mann Act
