Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell
S2 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

On behalf of our client, Ghislaine Maxwell, we respectfully submit this letter regarding the
jury charge. We did not notice any errors in the Court’s redline of the draft jury charge or the draft
verdict sheet. We note that at the charge conference, the Court reserved decision on whether to slightly
modify the language of Instruction No. 50: “Uncalled Witnesses — Equally Available to Both Sides” to
take the emphasis off the word “equal.” Tr. 2815:14 —2817:16. We assume the Court has decided not
to make those proposed edits. If that is incorrect, we renew our request for those edits.

We have also reviewed the government’s letter regarding the jury charge (Dkt. 556). We do
not object to the government’s proposed edit to Instruction No. 19.

Very truly yours,
/s/
BOBBI C. STERNHEIM
