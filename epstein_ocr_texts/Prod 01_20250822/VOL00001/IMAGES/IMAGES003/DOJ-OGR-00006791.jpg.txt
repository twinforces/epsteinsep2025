such evidence in its case-in-chief, unless the defendant opens the door to this evidence or otherwise
puts it at issue at trial. Furthermore, if the defendant testifies, the Government may cross-examine
the defendant about this conduct, depending on the scope of her direct examination. But the
Government will not affirmatively offer this evidence in its case-in-chief.

The same is true for the defense motion to exclude evidence of the defendant’s false
statements in her 2016 depositions. (Def. Mot. 6 at 1). Although false exculpatory statements are
admissible as proof of a defendant’s consciousness of guilt (see Gov’t Opp. at 142-43, Dkt. No.

Finally, the defense seeks to preclude the Government’s law enforcement witnesses from
offering expert testimony. (Def. Mot. 10 at 5). The defense appears to take an improperly broad
view of the scope of expert testimony.**> However, the Government has not noticed the three law

the sweeping claim that “any opinion testimony” based on those three law enforcement witnesses’
“specialized ‘training and experience’ is expert opinion testimony subject to Rule 702 and Rule
16(1)(G) and is inadmissible at trial.” (Def. Mot. 10 at 4 (emphasis in original)). But in Garcia,
the Second Circuit simply held that an undercover law enforcement agent could not testify as lay
opinion that, based on his knowledge from other drug interdiction cases, the defendant was a
