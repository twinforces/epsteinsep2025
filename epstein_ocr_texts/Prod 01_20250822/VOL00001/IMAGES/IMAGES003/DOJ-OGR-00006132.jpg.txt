may you use evidence that I have instructed you was admitted for a limited purpose for any
inference beyond that limited purpose.
| In addition, you may not infer that the defendantMs. Maxwell is guilty of participating in
criminal conduct merely from the fact that she associated with other people who were guilty of
wrongdoing or merely because he has or had knowledge of the wrongdoing of others.
Here again, let me remind you that, whether based upon direct or circumstantial evidence,
or upon the logical, reasonable inferences drawn from such evidence, you must be satisfied of
| the guilt of the defendantMs. Maxwell as to each count charged before you may convict her as to
that count.
Adapted from the charge of the Hon. Alison J. Nathan in United States
v. Jones, 16 Cr. 553 (AJN) and in United States v. Pizarro, 17 Cr. 151
(AJN).
