‘Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE. Document 439-7 Filed 11/12/21 Page 4 of 7

AK?s recollection is that the attorneys  did:not make any’ suggestions regarding what
investigative steps SDNY should take. The attorncys.did not suggest that SDNY: use:
civil lawsuits as a:mecans to conduct.a criminal ‘investigation. |
Discussion of.Epstcin’s:conduct expanded beyond Virginia-Roberts. Attorneys described
the conduct as involving many or several other girls. There was moré detail provided
about Virginia.Roberts’s experience, but there was a broader discussion about Epstein’s
conduct as:a pattern and. long-running, if not ongoing, behavior that continued after
Virginia Ww was No. longer involved. |
charge a anyone ‘other than Epstein. The mecting-w was «focused c on 11 Epstein, “There v ‘was
mention. of other people who had helped him over time; ‘including an ‘individual who was
in Europe and potentially was a source of cvidence:against Epstein. “‘The'thrust of the
discussion,was about building a case against Epstein. The other individuals: were
mentioned or described as part of telling the story; or as potential sources ‘of information.
AK,does not remember exactly what she said.at'the end of the mecting, but she knows
her practice was that in every: such:mecting she has. ever had, she has thanked the people:
for Coming in and been completely 'non-committal and non-responsive about what.the
office would do about the information that was ‘provided.

o AK absolutely did not-tell the attorneys that an investigation would be opened.

after’ February 29, 2016 mecting:

Afterthe February 29, 2016 mecting, AK emailed Dan Stein (Chicfof Criminal Division
at the time). Had a mceting'in his office. AK. discussed with Stcin'what the lawyers had
shared, AK’s thoughts, and, Stein’s thoughts. Decided on, an action plan.

o AK knew there was the pending CVRA civil case and other civil litigation, which
gave AK.some pause because she had other occasions where. civil litigants have
decided. to report something to the USAO because they think it will-help them in
their civil case. AK mentioned that to Stein.

o ‘Discussed.the length of'time that had ‘passed; ‘wasn’t clear there was any ongoing’
conduct; USAO SDFL is.a reputable USAO with skilled FBI agents, and AK’s
assumption was that. however they concluded their.case-probably reflected
something about-the strength of the case or some issue that existed.

o One thing that leaned. in favor of taking action was that-one of the lawyers (Stan
or Brad) said-that:FBI agents in Florida:case:were not happy-with-the result and
how the case was resolved. That.concerned.AK because éxpeéricnecd. FBI agents
in this area-usually, in AK’s experience, make collaborative decisions with;the

o AK & Stein decided (don’t recall who came up with. idea) that AK would:reach.
out to Scan Watson. (head of FBI C-20 at.the time) and ask him to contact Miami
‘FBI agents 'to ask. if they in. fact:were unhappy with the outcome and felt like
justice had, not.been served.

After'the meeting > with, Stein, AK called Sean -Watson and. heaved the summary of this
