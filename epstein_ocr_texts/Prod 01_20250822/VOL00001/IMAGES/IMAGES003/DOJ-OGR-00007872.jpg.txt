1 regarding public access yesterday: The 412 piece of these
2 proceedings will be sealed, as is expressly required by Federal
3 Rule of Evidence 412. That rule requires certain categories of
4 evidence to be discussed at a sealed, in camera hearing. My
5 plan is to hold that part of the hearing last, do what we need
6 to do with respect to logistical issues and Daubert here first,
7 and then seal the courtroom, having everyone who is a
8 nonparticipant leave and shutting down the overflow access at
9 that point, as required by law.
10 Given this, I want to address a few logistical issues
11 at the outset, and then we'll move into Daubert.
12 I should say, to the extent we run into any overlap
13 during the Daubert hearing on any 412 issues, we have arranged
14 space to do the equivalent of a sealed sidebar in the jury
15 room, I believe. But, again, we can bifurcate.
16 OK. Before I turn to the logistical issues, any
17 matters I should take up with what I have indicated,
18 Ms. Pomerantz?
19 MS. POMERANTZ: Not from the government. Thank you.
20 THE COURT: Ms. Sternheim?
21 MS. STERNHEIM: No. Thank you.
22 THE COURT: OK. First, on logistics, as you know,
23 counsel, we had a very successful return rate on the jury
24 summons, and in the two days that the questionnaire has been
25 filled out we had 565 prospective jurors fill it out. Given
