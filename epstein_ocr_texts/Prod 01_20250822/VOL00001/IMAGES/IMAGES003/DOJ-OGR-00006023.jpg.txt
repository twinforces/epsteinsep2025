Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully submits this letter concerning the parties’ motions in /imine.
Consistent with the Court’s order (Dkt. No. 368), the parties today have filed their motions in
limine and responsive briefs, containing all redactions sought by both parties. The following are
the parties’ justifications for their proposed redactions:

Government’s Justification

The Government’s proposed redactions are consistent with the three-part test articulated
by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006).
Although the Government’s motions in limine are judicial documents subject to the common law
presumption of access, the proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to protect the privacy
interests of victims (including victims who have not identified themselves on the record in this
case and who have not publicly identified themselves as victims referenced in the Indictment in
this case), witnesses, and third parties. The Government also seeks sealing of trial exhibits, which
are not public, and certain other exhibits which are not themselves confidential, but which would
risk identifying the victims if publicly filed on the docket in this case.
