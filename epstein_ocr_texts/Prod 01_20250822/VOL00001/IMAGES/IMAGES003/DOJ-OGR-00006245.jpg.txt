under Rule 403. Jd. at *6 (citing cases); see.ulso Heine, 2017 WL.5260784, at *2.(excluding expert
testimony under Rules 702 and 403 under the same principles as. bby. because it would. not, be
helpful to the jury and. would “invad[e] the jury’s role in-assessing the eredibility of witnesses,”
and because the trial did “not involve issues of repressed or recovered, memories,” among, other:
things); Libby, 461... Supp. 2d.at 14 (excluding memory expert’s testimony because itwould not.
be helpful, to the jury, invaded the province of’ the jury, and was likely to, confuse, mislead, or

C. Discussion.

As set forth herein, although the Government, acknowledges that:testimony about memory
may be proper in response to. Dr. Rocchio, Dr. Loftus*s proposed testimony does ‘not satisfy the:
Daubert standard. Specifically, the Government objects to any attempt by ‘the: defense to.offer. her
testimony’as to (a) opinions, as:‘to false memory. formation'that;are unreliable or do:not fit the facts
of the case, (b) commonsense prineiples within the ken of the jury, (c) opinions bearing on witness

‘l. ‘Opinions as to False Memory Formation

Dr. Loftus. offers the following opinion on false memory formation. that. is unreliable: and,
lacks. fit to the case:

e How false memories ‘may be created through post-event, information, and. occurrences,
suggestion, and:influence,,as described in.Paragraph.3: above.

This: opinion. on ‘false. memory: formation. is :central to Dr. Loftus’s: testimony, but the
defense has not carried its burden of establishing ‘its reliability. See Fed. R. Evid. 702, 703;

Danbert, 509 US. at‘589. Asan initial matter, the defense expert notice provides no information
