Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 441 Filed 11/12/21 Page9of12
The Court emphasized that the defendant had acted willfully and in bad faith in not disclosing
the witness until the second day of trial after the prosecution's primary witness had testified. See
id. at 416-17. Accordingly, “[r]egardless of whether prejudice to the prosecution could have
been avoided [by a less severe sanction] ..., it [was] plain that the case fit[ ] into the category of
willful misconduct in which the severest sanction [was] appropriate.” Jd. at 417; see also United
States v. Katz, 178 F.3d 368, 371—72 (Sth Cir. 1999) (government's failure to disclose the

should have disclosed earlier, even if the nondisclosure did not prejudice the defendants); United
States v. Wicker, 848 F.2d 1059, 1062 (10th Cir. 1988) (in view of the district court's pressing
schedule, the status of the present case, and the failure of a prior continuance and deadlines to

government's evidence).

Here, the Court issued its disclosure order months ago. The government did not agree
with the Order and sought reconsideration. The Court considered the government’s belated
request and rejected the government’s “concern” that somehow its evidence would be limited at
trial. Of course, the government could have made a good faith effort to comply with the Order
and, if some other statement came to the government’s attention before or during trial it could
have, in good faith, requested permission to supplement its proof. Instead, the government has
