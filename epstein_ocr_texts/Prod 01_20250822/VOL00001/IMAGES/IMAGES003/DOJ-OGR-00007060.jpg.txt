1 Moreover, any potential prejudice in this regard can

2 be cured with an appropriate instruction explaining that the

3 reason for the precaution is regard for the witnesses' and

4 alleged victims' privacy, and that no inference can or should

5 be drawn against the defendant because of these precautions

6 My colleagues in this district and elsewhere have used
7 such an instruction in similar cases. The defense's concern

8 that this sort of instruction affords "Court-sanctioned

9 sympathy and credibility‚Äù is unfounded. My instructions on the
10 law will clearly and repeatedly instruct the jury on the

11 presumption of innocence and their sole role in assessing

12 witness credibility

13 Nor am I persuaded by the defense's arguments that the
14 fact that some alleged victims have previously publicly

15 disclosed some of their allegations obviates the need to limit
16 disclosure. As another district court has held, "just because
17 some victims' names are publicly available does not mean that
18 the details of their experience are already available."

20 As I acknowledged in my protective order for this
21 case, "Not all accusations and public statements are equal.
22 Deciding to participate in or contribute to a criminal
23 investigation or prosecution is a far different matter than
24 simply making a public statement relating to Ms. Maxwell or
25 Jeffrey Epstein." Docket No. 37 in this case at 2.
