Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 465 Filed 11/15/21 Page 9. of 127 9.

Moreover, any potential ‘preyjtidicé in this regard can
be cured with an appropriate instruction explaining that the
réason, ‘for the precaution is régard for the wittnesses,' and
alleged victims’ privacy, and that no inference can or should

be drawn against the déféendant because Of ‘these precatitions

My colleagues in this district and elsewhere have used
such an instruction ‘in, similar cases. The defense's concern
that this. sort. of instruction affords. "Court—-sanctioned
sympathy and Gredibility" is unfoundéd. My ‘instructions on the
law will clearly and repeatedly instruct the jury on the
presumptidn of innocence and their sole réle in assessing
witness credibility

Nor am I persuaded by thé déefensée's arguments that the
fact, that seme alleged victims have previously publicly
disclésed some of their allegations obviates the neéd to limit
disclosure. AAs another district court has held, "just because

some victims' names are publicly available doés n6ét méan that.

the details of their experience are already available.”

Ranieré,; Docket N6é. 662 at 34, ne 17

As I, acknowledged in my protective order for this
case, "Not all accusations and public statements are équal.
Deciding to participate in, or contribute to a criminal
investigation or prosecution is a far different mattér than
simply making a public statement relating to Ms. Maxwell or
Jeffrey Epstein." Docket No. 37 in this case at 2.
