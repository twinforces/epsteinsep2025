Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document 440 Filed 11/12/21 Page 22 of 40

The Government is seeking an order issued in many other cases to protect the privacy and
dignity of Minor Victims who will take the stand and testify about being sexually abused. The
defense has failed to carry its burden of identifying any right of the defendant that is burdened by

offer in response. Accordingly, the Government does not seek a decision on prior consistent
statements at this time.

In their brief, the defense recites the applicable law, largely in agreement with the
Government’s view. The Government notes two points with respect to that discussion. First, it is
plainly proper to offer prior consistent statements to rebut a purported inconsistency between the
witness’s trial testimony and an earlier statement. See United States v. Purcell, 967 F.3d 159, 196-

consistent statements if the defense attacks witness credibility in its opening statement, and the
