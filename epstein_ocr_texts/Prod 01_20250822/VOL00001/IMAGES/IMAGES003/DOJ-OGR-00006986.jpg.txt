1 MS. STERNHEIM: Does the Court know how many will be

2 in each sitting, or are you just dividing up the 600 by the

3 number of sittings?

4 THE COURT: They've put out a certain number of

5 summonses with â€”-

6 Let me just back up. The need to do it over several

7 days, the need to do it in panels and the limits on the numbers
8 are dramatically affected by Covid, because we have six-foot

9 spacing requirements under the district protocols. They've

10 worked hard to maximize the number of people who can sit in

11 what will be two rooms, two large rooms, with sufficient

12 spacing. All of those rooms require staffing, of course, so I
13 believe that we're talking about 100 people per panel.

14 Let me just get confirmation of that.

15 MS. MAYERS-BEST: My name is Rhonda Mayers-Best. I'm
16 the jury administrator.

17 THE COURT: Just a second, Rhonda. Thank you. T'il
18 let you know if I need you, and I appreciate that.

19 And Rhonda, you can confirm you've summoned
20 anticipating 100 people per panel. Is that correct, Rhonda?
2l MS. MAYERS-BEST: Correct.
22 THE COURT: OK.
23 Ms. Sternheim, we'll have 100 people in the morning
24 each day, 100 people in the afternoon each day, over the course
25 of three days.
