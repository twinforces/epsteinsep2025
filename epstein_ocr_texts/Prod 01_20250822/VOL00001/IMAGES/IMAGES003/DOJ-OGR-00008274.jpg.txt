1. Applicable Law

The Second Circuit,has “often commented that, the bar for authentication of evidence ‘is not
‘particularly high.” Waited States v. Al-Movad, 545 F.3d. 139,172. (2d Cir. 2008) (alteration. and,
internal. quotation ‘marks omitted). The “proponent of the evidence is not required, to:rule out. all.
possibilitics:inconsistent with authenticity, or to prove beyond a reasonable doubt;that the evidence
is what it purports to be.” Witited States. v. Dhinsa, 243 F.3d 635, 658 (2d Cir..2001). All that is
identification.” Jd: (internal quotation, marks omitted); sé Fed. R. Evid. 901(a). ‘The “standard
for authentication is one of. ‘reasonable likelihood’ and ‘is *minimal.” The testimony of a witness
with, knowledge that a matter ‘is what. it ‘is claimed, to be is sufficient. to satisfy this standard.”
United. States. v. Gagliardi, 506 F.3d. 140, ‘151 (2d Cir. 2007) (citations and internal. quotation
marks omitted); see United States:v. Al.arekh, 810 F. App’x 21. 24-25 (2d.Cir. 2020) (authenticating:
“handwritten lctters” based ‘on, their contents and “considerable similarities between, the handwriting”
and.’known exemplars). After this low bar ‘is ‘satisfied, “the other party then remains free to
challenge the reliability. of the evidence, ‘to minimize its importance, or to arguc alternative
interpretations of. its meaning, but these and.:similar other challenges. to 'go the weight of the
evidenec—not to.its admissibilitye” United States v. Tan Yat. Chin, 371 F.3d.3.1,,38 (2d:Cir. 2004).
