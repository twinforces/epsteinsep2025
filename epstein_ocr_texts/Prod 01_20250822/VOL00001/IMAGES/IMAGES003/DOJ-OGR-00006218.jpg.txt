° Awareness of the impact of hindsight bias “should temper any claims that..so called.
“grooming” behaviors should have been:noticed and. cither reported.or avoided and.that.
‘failing to.do so constitutes knowledge or intent.” (7d).
As, set forth below, the Government. objects that these opinions are within the ken of the jury: and
‘invade the:province of the jury and the Court.

Dr. Dietz. also offers the following opinions as to the “Halo effect”:

eo The: “Halo effect” is “a cognitive bias in impression. formation whereby the: positive:
evaluation of one characteristic ‘has a radiating effect. on, how. other, ‘non-related.
‘characteristics. of the individual are evaluated.” (/d.).

° “Like many people’ who achieve great power and. wealth, Jeff[re]y Epstein exploited.
the Halo cffect:to surround himself’ with people who would.serve his, needs.” (Jd. .at’6).

o ‘Epstcin’s personality’ flaws, ‘allowed him, to'use ‘his brilliance’to manipulate: people to
‘do his bidding and, to compartmentalize ‘people into isolated cells in which none: had,
complete. information about his activities.” (/d. at 7).”

As sct forth below, the Government objects that these opinions are’ an irrelevant, invitation. to jury
nullification and an improper vehicle ‘for introducing a factual narrative.

Dr. Dictz offers a lengthy scries..of objectionable opinions as to “Multiple Pathways to
False Sex, Assault Allegations.” (/d. at 7). In. relevant part, Dr. Dietz opines:

e “False allegations of scxual assault do occur, and there are multiple pathways to these
false: allegations of scxual.assault.” (/d. at.7).

* The disclosure: also notes that “Dr. Dictz is also prepared ‘to address Jefftcy ‘Epstein’s sexual.
behavior'should.it prove relevant” (id. at’ 7), but as'he has:not disclosed what opinions he may have
about; Epstcin’s scxual behavior, he has not provided adequate notice as to them, and. the:
Government does ‘not address them further herein except to note that: it. will object if he attempts
to offer them. See, ©: 8 : United S States: v, valle, ‘No. 12 Cr. 847 7 PS). 2013 ‘WL. 440687, at *5

is 9 insufficient: rather, the s summary must reveal the expert’ 5 actual ‘opinions. 3).
