that lack clear corroborating evidence, an understanding of pathways to
false allegations may be useful to help determine the accuracy of the claims.

Binder and McNeil (2007) presented several civil cases in which the
alleged perpetrator of sexual assault and/or boundary violations completely
denied all wrongdoing, and there was no corroborating evidence to help
verify the claims of either party. The authors contended that in cases such
as these, carefully administered and interpreted psychological evaluations
may provide a context for allegations by allowing the court to understand
personality traits, personality disorders, cognitive disability, and psychotic
symptoms that may affect the alleged victim’s allegations. Certain psycho-
logical processes have in past cases explained the lack of corroborating
accounts between a plaintiff and a defendant. Some relevant psychologi-
cal processes that have been suggested are psychosis, hypersensitivity when
interacting with others, tendency toward exaggeration, and serious cognitive
problems (Binder & McNeil). The authors also suggested that there may be
several additional psychological markers to consider when determining the
credibility of a complaint. We believe that a more thorough identification of
these pathways is important and can be partly achieved by understanding
the role of psychological disorders, as currently specified by the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000),
in explicating specific motivations and cognitive distortions that may be
associated with false allegations and malingering behaviors. Some of these
variables may interact in a complex manner. For instance, an individual
with borderline personality may place herself in riskier situations and may,
therefore, have an increased risk of actual sexual assault. Conversely, as
we discuss below, the individual with borderline personality disorder may
also suffer from certain key cognitive distortions that lead to false reports.
We caution against a simplistic reading of this analysis in that it never is
the case that because a person suffers from a certain diagnosis that her alle-
gations are, therefore, false. In addition, it can be useful for the forensic
mental health professional to understand these pathways in context with
the alleged perpetrator’s mental health status. Again, no diagnosis would
mean that the perpetrator is guilty of the accusations; however, mental
health professionals can offer expertise in helping to understand the path-
ways to false allegations and false denials. Part of the focus of the present
paper, then, is to bring attention to the dearth of psychological literature
investigating correlates and causal mechanisms of false allegations of sexual
assault and to propose a model specifying the major causal pathways to false
allegations. These pathways are intended as a model for further empirical
investigation.

Therefore, a legitimate concern about enumerating such pathways is the
misuse of psychological diagnoses in determining the accuracy of specific
accusations. It is important to recognize that a model that comprehensively
and accurately identifies pathways provides information regarding necessary
