In contrast to a, constructive amendment, “[a] varianec occurs when the charging. terms of
‘the indictment: are left; unaltered, but}the evidence at'trial proves facts materially: different from.
those alleged in the indictment.” Jd. at 20 (cleaned up).

Court. Exhibit #15 indicates that the jury is considering a conviction, on the substantive
‘transportation. offense charged in Count Four based on Jane’s alleged travel to and from New
Mexico and.sexual activity that purportedly took-place while. she-was there. ‘That is not-what the
indictment alleges. Count.Four alleges that.Ms. Maxwell “arranged. for [Janc] to be transported,
firém Elorida'to New York, New York on multiple occasions ‘with the intention that [Janc] would
engage in one.or more: sex.acts. with. Jeffrey Epstein, in. violation.of New York Penal Law, Section

130.535.” $2 Ind.§,21 (emphasis added). As such,.a, conviction,on;Count Four must.be based, on,

The government. has, represented fo the Court.on numerous occasions that.Ms. Maxwell cannot: be
convicted on any:of the four Mann. Act counts, including Count Four, without proof of an. intent to
violate’New York law. That.excludes any conduct:that.may have occurred.in New Mexico.
Indeed, in the discussion about Court Exhibit #15, the governnient stressed this point:

The only jillegal.:sexual activity identified in. the entirety of the jury charge is a

slatute in New York. There cannot be any: risk of confusion on, that. score. This
particular in reminds peuy of that and, includes that tametage as s well. the

wish of confusion for exactly theit reuson.
