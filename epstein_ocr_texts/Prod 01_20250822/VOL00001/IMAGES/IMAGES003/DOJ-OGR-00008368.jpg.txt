Scarola:to the government; about Carolyn:was also not for the purpose: of obtaining or providing
legal advice, is not a communication. by Carolyn, and “it was [not] intended to be... . Kept’
confidential.” Eric, 473 F.3d.at 419; 1 McCormick on Evid., § 91 (“Wherever the matters’
communicated ‘to the attorney. are ‘intended by. the clicnt to be made public or revealed to third,
persons, ‘obviously-the clement of confidentiality is‘wanting.”) (8th.ed. Jan. 2020 update).
Finally, Carolyn’s motivation for cooperating with the government and testifying against Ms.
Maxwell is €ssential. to the jury’s assessment of Carolyn’s credibility.

But.even if the privilege did apply, the privilege was waived. “It:is well-established that
voluntary’ disclosure: of:confidential material to'a:third party generally results in, forfeiture of any
applicable attorney-clicnt-privilege.” United States ¥. Ghavami, 882.F. Supp. 2d 532,537
(S/D.N:Y: 2012). That is exactly what happened here when Mr. Scarola made the statements to
the government. As Fed. R. Evid. 502(a) ‘recognizes, “[wJ]hen the disclosure [of confidential.
information] :is made in.a federal proceeding or to.a federal. office,” that gencrally: “waives the.
attorney-client privilege or work-product protection . . . .” See Fed. R. Evid. 502(a) (defining the
limits of such a ‘waiver as to undisclosed or inadvertently disclosed information); Ji re Steinhardt
Partners, LP. 9 F.3d 230, 236 (2d. Cir. 1993) (when a party voluntarily discloses otherwise
privileged information to the government, she “necessarily decides that the benefits of
participation [in the government investigation] outweigh the benefits. of confidentiality”); 1
McCormick On Evid., § 93 (“Waiver may be found, as Wigmore points out, not mere¢ly from,
‘words or conduct expressing an intention to, relinquish.a known:right, but also from conduct; such
as partial disclosure which would:makc itunfair for the client-to invoke the: privilege

thercafter.”).
