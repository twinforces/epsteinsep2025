gather the computers and contact books in the house and hand them over to a specified individual.

Employee-1’s testimony is admissible for multiple permissible purposes. Her testimony
shows the relationship between Epstein and the defendant a. shortly after the end of the

testimony will also show the defendant and Epstein’s plan and preparation, because it will describe
the process and frequency of obtaining masseuses, including the fact that the masseuses were often
underage girls, and that some of the massages developed into sexual abuse. And Employee-1’s
testimony tends to show the defendant’s knowledge, because it describes the visibility of Epstein’s

Rule 404(b), for substantially the same reasons.

corresponding disclosures, seven weeks before trial. In fact, the defense has had the seven exhibits
for much longer, since they were part of the Government’s Rule 16 discovery productions. The
defense now also has this briefing, five weeks before trial. Thus, any alleged gap in the
