1 parties on issues, some I'm prepared to resolve without further
2 discussion. For all of them, to the extent I can resolve them
3 or give guidance today, I will. In some cases, by necessity, I
4 will reserve.

iy Of course, as with all in limine motions, those are

6 preliminary rulings based on what I know now about the

7 anticipated evidence and arguments. My preliminary rulings are
8 to guide the parties in advance of trial, to guide opening

9 statements and the like. Facts on the ground, of course, can
10 change during trial and you must reraise issues if you think

11 the other side has opened the door or that premises of certain
12 pretrial holdings no longer hold.

13 With that, I'm going to move slightly out of order and
14 begin with the defendant's 12th motion in lLimine because it

15 involves terminology questions that apply throughout. After

16 that motion I will address the government's motions in order

17 and then address the remaining defense motions in order.

18 In the defendant's 12th motion in limine, the defense
19 asked the Court to preclude use of the terms "victim" and
20 "minor victim." The motion is denied. Government counsel can
21 use the word "victim" if they're referring to someone alleged
22 to be a victim of the crimes charged in the indictment, and
23 they may use the word "minor" to describe individuals that
24 were, at the relevant time period, under the age of consent.
25 As my colleague, Judge Furman, has explained,
