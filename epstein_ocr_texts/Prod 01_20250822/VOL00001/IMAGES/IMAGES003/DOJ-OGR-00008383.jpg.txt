Re: United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan:

The Government respectfully seeks redactions to the defendant’s letter motion seeking
testimony of Jack Scarola, Brad Edwards, and Robert Glassman, and the sealing of Exhibit 1 to
that letter (Dkt. No. 544). The Government’s proposed redactions are consistent with the three-
part test articulated by the Second Circuit in Lugosch v. Pyramid Co. of Onondaga, 435 F.3d 110
(2d Cir. 2006). Although the letter and exhibit are judicial documents subject to the common law
presumption of access, the limited proposed redactions and sealing are narrowly tailored to protect
the privacy interests of a Minor Victim who is subject of the Court’s pseudonym order.
