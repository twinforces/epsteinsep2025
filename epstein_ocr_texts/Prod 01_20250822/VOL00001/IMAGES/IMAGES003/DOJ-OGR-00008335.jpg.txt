1 that are not disclosed, I will raise that with the Court at

2 that time.

3 THE COURT: All right.

4 Just with respect to what you have as anticipated

a opinion about those subjects, when will you -- give me the date
6 by which you'll tell me if your expert has different expert

7 opinions to offer with respect to those areas.

8 MS. MENNINGER: This Saturday, your Honor?

9 THE COURT: All right.

10 MS. MENNINGER: And I don't —-— I guess what I'm

11 hearing is, the only opinions he may offer are those disclosed
12 in other cases. They haven't disclosed an opinion from this

13 case. So we will look at those other trial testimony, and any
14 opinions in those testimony that our client -- our expert

15 disagrees with we can provide them by this Saturday.

16 THE COURT: That sounds very reasonable to me. OK?

17 MR. ROHRBACH: Yes, your Honor. Although we know

18 that, again, in addition to the other -- his testimony in other
19 cases, we would point the defense expert to the 3500 material
20 as well in this case and the government's exhibits.
21 THE COURT: Well, I mean, your notice should provide
22 the opinions that he's going to offer. Does it?
23 It's not a scavenger hunt. You're required, as the
24 first matter, to provide, pursuant to Rule 16, the opinions
25 that he's going to offer. Have you done that?
