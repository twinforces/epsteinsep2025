about the bases or details of Dr. Loftus’s opinion—it simply states that she is testifying “[b]ased
on her education, training, experience, and research.” (Ex. A at 1).!!

Moreover, there is specific reason to doubt the reliability of Dr. Loftus’s opinions as to
false memory formation. A number of Dr. Loftus’s opinions were tested and rejected in United
States v. Libby, 461 F. Supp. 2d at 8-18. There, the defendant relied on Dr. Loftus’s research
regarding alleged juror misperceptions of the reliability of eyewitness identifications, presented in
a 2006 article. See id. at 10-11 (citing, eg., R. Schmechel, T. O’Toole, C. Easterly, & E.
Loftus, Beyond the Ken? Testing Jurors’ Understanding of Eyewitness Reliability Evidence, 46
Jurimetrics J. 177-214 (2006)). The district court rejected such research, concluding that “the
design of these surveys demonstrates their limited value.” Libby, 461 F. Supp. 2d at 11. The court
found that the survey design used in Loftus’s article was “based primarily on hypothetical
situations involving eyewitness identification and the credibility of eyewitnesses.” Jd. The court
also found—and Dr. Loftus “reluctantly agreed in part’”—that the some of the studies were in part
“structurally flawed” because certain questions asked of respondents were “unclear.” J/d. at 16.
The Government, moreover, understands that much of Dr. Loftus’s research involves controlled
laboratory experiments rather than clinical work because studies about, for instance, the creation
of false memories, may be unethical in the clinical context. See, e.g. Elizabeth F. Loftus, UCI
'l While the Government’s expert notice for Dr. Rocchio contained similar language, it also
explained that Dr. Rocchio was testifying based on her “extensive clinical experience treating
individuals who suffered s]exual abuse and trauma in childhood and adolescence, as well as Dr.
Rocchio’s experience conducting forensic psychological evaluations of people who have
experienced sexual abuse and trauma.” (Def. Mot. 3 Ex. A at 2). The Government also produced
its notes from its interviews with Dr. Rocchio simultaneously with its expert notice. The defense
expert notice identifies no particular form of training, experience, or research on which Dr. Loftus
is relying, nor has the defense produced any notes of its conversations with Dr. Loftus.
