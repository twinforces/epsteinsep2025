Violation of New York.Criminal Law

Count. Two alleges that Ms. Maxwell enticed Jane to'travel across state: lines with’the
intent that. she: would engage in. sexual activity for which a-person. could be:charged with.a crime
under the penal law of New York State, namely New York, Penal Law, Scetion. 130.55. ‘I instruct:
you as a matter of'law that Sexwal.Abuse in‘the. Third Degree, the offense set forth. in Count Two
of the Indictment, was a violation. of New York ‘State Penal law ‘from at cast in or about 1994 up
to and including in or about 1997, atthe! time the acts are‘alleged. to have been committed.

A person violates New York State Penal.Law: § 130.55, Sexual. Abuse in:the Third
Degree, when he or she subjects ‘another person. to sexual contact without the latter’s
consent.

Under. New’ York law; “sexual ‘contact’ means any touching of the scxual. or other
intimate parts ofa person for the purpose of gratifying the sexual desire of cither party. It
ineludes ‘the, touching of the victim bythe, actor, whether directly or through:clothing, as. well as
the emission of cjaculate’by-the actor upon any part of the:victim, clothed or‘unclothed.

Also'under New’ York law; lack of consent can, result from incapacity to consent. A
person less than. seventeen ycars.old is deemed incapable of consenting to sexual. contact under
New York Law. Thus, the law deems sexual contact with.a, person less than seventeen-years old
to be without'that:person’s consént, éven if in. fact'that:person did consent. However, in order to

find that the intended acts were nonconsensual solely because of the victim’s age, you must. find

that the ntMs. Maxwell knew that Jane was less than,scventcen years old.
