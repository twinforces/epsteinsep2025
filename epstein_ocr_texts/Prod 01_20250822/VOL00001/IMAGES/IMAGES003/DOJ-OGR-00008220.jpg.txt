305). This comment about Epstcin’s distinct'decorating style may'scem. implausible to jurors. But.
the Government observed. and ‘photographed..more than, one stuffed. animal, that. could. fairly be
described as “creepy: looking” during’ its scarch of Epstein’s house, including .as depicted ‘in,
Government Exhibit 9387:

|Redacted]

The fact that this stuffed tiger is movable property is counterbalanced by the fact*that: it is
highly idiosyncratic. ‘While the Government would not argue that Epstein had. this particular
stuffed tiger in his home iin:the mid-1990s, it:is probative of Jance’s testimony that—at.any point in,
time—Epstcin possessed the kind of “creepy looking animals” that she described.

Third, the Government ‘would ‘offer six photos—Government: Exhibits 909 through, 9111,
9.13, 915, and, 933—=to demonstrate structural, features of the house. Some of these: photographs
will:provide context for the law:enforcement officer’s testimony by showing’the entrance arcas. of
the house which she searched. And.all-of them will corroborate Jane’s testimony: that, the house
was intimidating and contains significant amounts of wood. and, stone, as Jane stated. (11/30/21
Tr. at 317-18 (describing, the -house: as “massive” and. :made: her feel. “Intimidated.”); 320
(explaining that the house had “Lots of:stone, you know, old wood.:”)). Neither of these, theorics
involve movable property of-any kind, and the Government would ‘not argue ‘that any movable
furniture: or-artwork ‘was present when Jane visited thehouse.*

Fourth, Epstein’s home contained. a large ‘number of photographs of celcbrities, including’

+ & stuffed. dog is also depicted in:Government Exhibit 936.

° The: Government. also notes thaf the Court. has already -tuled that it will reserve, subject to
cconncction,, on. the admissibility of costumes from the search, which are marked ‘as physical
exhibits and. depicted in Government ‘Exhibits 9.19 and 920. (12/03/21 ‘Tr. at 929). The:
Government similarly will offer Government Exhibits 919 and.920 subject, to connection.
