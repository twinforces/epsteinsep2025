] Instruction No. 40: Venue

2 With respect to each of the counts in the indictment, you must also consider the issue of

3 venue, namely, whether any act in furtherance of the unlawful activity charged in that count

4 — occurred within the Southern District of New York. The Southern District of New York

5 encompasses the following counties: New York County (i.e., Manhattan), Bronx, Westchester,

6 Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Orange and Sullivan Counties. Anything that occurs in any of

7 those places occurs in the Southern District of New York.

8 Venue must be examined separately for each count in the Indictment. Venue on one

9 count does not establish venue on another count, though if applicable, you may rely on the same
10 evidence to establish venue on multiple counts.
11 On the issue of venue—and this alone—the Government need not prove venue beyond a
12 reasonable doubt, but only by a mere preponderance of the evidence. A “preponderance of the
13. evidence” means more likely than not. Thus, the Government, which does bear the burden of
14 proving venue, has satisfied that burden as to venue if you conclude that it is more likely than not
15 that some act in furtherance of each charged offense occurred in the Southern District of New
16 ~=York. If, on the other hand, you find that the Government has failed to prove the venue
17 requirement as to a particular offense, then you must acquit Ms. Maxwell of that offense, even if
18 all the other elements of the offense are proven.
