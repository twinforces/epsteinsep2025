1 Instruction No. 4: Statements of Counsel and Court Not Evidence;

2 Jury’s Recollection Controls

3 You must determine the facts by relying upon your own recollection of the evidence.

4 This case is not to be decided on the rhetoric of either the attorneys for the Government or the

5 attorneys for the Defendant. The lawyers’ arguments are intended to convince you to draw

6 certain conclusions from the evidence or lack of evidence. Those arguments are important. You

7 should weigh and evaluate them carefully. But you must not confuse them with the evidence. If

8 your recollection of the evidence differs from the statements of the lawyers, follow your

9 recollection.
10 You should draw no inference or conclusion for or against any party by reason of lawyers
11 making objections or my rulings on such objections. Counsel have not only the right but the duty
12 to make legal objections that they think are appropriate. You should not be swayed against the
13. Government or the Defendant simply because counsel for either side has chosen to make an
14 objection. Similarly, statements made by counsel when arguing the admissibility of evidence are
15 not to be considered as evidence.
16 If | comment on the evidence during my instructions, do not accept my statements in
17 place of your recollection. Again, it is your recollection that governs.
18 Do not concern yourself with what was said at side bar conferences or during my
19 discussions with counsel. Those discussions related to rulings of law, which are my duty, and not
20 ‘to matters of fact, which are your duty to determine.
21 At times I may have admonished a witness or directed a witness to be responsive to
22 questions, to keep his or her voice up, or to repeat an answer. My instructions were intended only
23 to clarify the presentation of evidence. You should draw no inference or conclusion of any kind,
24 favorable or unfavorable, with respect to any witness or party in the case, by reason of any
