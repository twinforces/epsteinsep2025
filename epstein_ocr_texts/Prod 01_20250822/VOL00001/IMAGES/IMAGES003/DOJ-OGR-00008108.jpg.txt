Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document508_ Filed 11/24/21 Page 23 of 25

Il. This-Court Should Reject the Government’s Remaining Arguments.

The government: objects, to the adequacy of the:notice Ms. Maxwell has provided with.
regard:to Robert Kelso, John Lopez, Gerald LaPorte, and, Jennifer Naso. Mot. at 21-26. Really
‘only two: responses are in ‘order,

Ms.-Maxwell’s notices are! as thorough as the government’s notices were, so the
government can hardly complain about being inthe, dark. But'if this Court concludes otherwise,
the remedy is ‘for Ms. Maxwell to‘provide additional, notice; the: remedy is not ‘exclusion.

Morcover, as the government conecdes is permissible, Ms..Maxwell has endorsed these
‘witnesses. in part-out of-an:abundance of caution and in part.because Ms.. Maxwell. still. doesn’t
know what evidence the government, will actually admit at trial. If testimony from these
witnesses is not relevant, Ms. Maxwell will -not call them. But if the governmient’s evidence
makes their testimony relevant, Ms. Maxwell can always provide additional:notice if ordered to
do so by the Court.

This: Court.should. deny:the: government’s:motion.
