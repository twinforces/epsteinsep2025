phrase mean? ‘The words almost define themselves. A-reasonable doubt isa. doubt based iin.
reason and. arising out of the evidence in the case, or the lack of evidenec. ‘It is. a doubt that a
reasonable person has after carcfully weighing all of the evidence. in the case.

Reasonable doubt is:a doubt that appeals to’your reason, your, judgment, your experience,
and your common sense. Reasonable doubt.is not. whim or'speculation. It is not an excuse to
avoid an unpleasant duty..Nor is it sympathy for the.Defendant. ‘The law-in.a criminal case is
that it is sufficient if the guilt. of the’ Defendant is established beyond a:reasonable doubt, not,
beyond all possible doubt. Therefore, if, after a fair and. impartial. consideration of all’'the
evidence, you.can.candidly and honestly say that you do have an.abiding, belief of Ms.
Maxwell’s guilt-as to any crime charged ‘in this:case, ‘sucha, belicf.as a-prudent person would be.
willinig to, act‘upon. in important matters in.the:personal affairs of his or her own life, then you

that you do not have an abiding belief of her guilt as to that, charge—in other words, if you have:
such a.doubt as would reasonably cause:a:prudent person. to hesitate: in acting in matters of
importance in his or her own. affairs—then you havea reasonable doubt, and jin that.circumstance.

itas-your duty*to acquit Ms. Maxwell. of that. charge.
