The facts about(———_____] interaction with, Ms. Maxwell are hotly disputed. Ms.
Maxwell rejects the government’s unsupported.conclusory'statements about when and. if she:
interacted. with Ms. Maxwell and-her. ability to do so absent. suggestion.

When.the'prosccution offers testimony’ from.an, cyewitness to identify the defendant as.a,

Ms. Maxwell has met:her burden of demonstrating the show up was unduly suggestive.
Under these. circumstances. the Court should next consider the well_kniow “five factors’: (1) the
