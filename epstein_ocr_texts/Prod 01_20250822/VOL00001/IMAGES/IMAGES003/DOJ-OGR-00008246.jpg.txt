14 We're here for a pretrial conference in this matter.
15 My primary purpose of today's conference is to go over the
16 logistics of the voir dire that will begin tomorrow and
17 finalize the list of prospective jurors who will return for
18 voir dire, or at least we will ask to return for voir dire.
19 I want to start with the list of jurors first. And
20 just by background, the jury department conducted five sessions
2l of questionnaires over the course of November 4, 5, and 12.
22 As instructed, the parties conferred and I received
23 your list for each of these days. One, prospective jurors both
24 sides agreed should proceed to voir dire; two, prospective
25 jurors that both sides agreed should be excused or struck for
