1 MS. MOE: Exactly, your Honor.
2 THE COURT: For our purposes I think we need to assume
3 over the age of consent, correct?
4 MS. MOE: Your Honor, I think it would be ambiguous
5 from the evidence but we are not proffering them as evidence of
6 conduct with respect to other minors.
7 THE COURT: OK. So, let's just start with the
8 following statement: You are seeking to introduce e-mails that
9 involve the defendant setting up people on dates with women
10 over the age of consent?
11 MS. MOE: Your Honor, because we are not able to
12 determine the age of those individuals —--
13 THE COURT: Let's assume that you could for some of
14 them. Right? Are you seeking to introduce those? It is clear
15 that the women involved are over the age of the consent. Are
16 you seeking to introduce those e-mails?
17 MS. MOE: I think the e-mails that the defense has
18 moved to preclude don't say one way or the other the age -—-
19 THE COURT: You are fighting my hypo. So, to be
20 clear, it is a hypothetical. If you have an e-mail involving
21 the defendant setting someone up on a date with someone who the
22 government knows is over the age of consent on the basis of the
23 argument made here, are you seeking to introduce it?
24 MS. MOE: Yes, your Honor.
25 THE COURT: And why?
