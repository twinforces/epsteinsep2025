Case 1:20-cr-00330-PAE Document.563. Filed 12/18/21. Page 51 of 167

I want to caution you, however, that, Ms. Maxwell’s mere presence atthe scene of the
alleged. crime doés riot, by itself; make her a member of the conspiracy. Similarly, a person 'may
know, assemble:with, or be friendly ‘with, one ‘or. more members of.a conspiracy, without being a.

conspirator herself. | also want to:caution you that mere knowledge or acquiescence, without

participation, in the unlawful plan. is not sufficient. In-other words, knowledge without agreement.
and participation is not sufficient. What'is necessary is that Ms. Maxwell:participate: in the
conspiracy: with. knowledge of its‘unlawful purposes, and with an. intent to aid in the
accomplishment of:its unlawful. objectives.

It is also not necessary that Ms. Maxwell reecive or even anticipate any financial benefit
from participating in the conspiracy as long as she participated.in it in the way’ have explained.
That said, while proof ofa financial :interest:in the outcome of'a scheme is not essential, if you
find that Ms. Maxwell had such’an. interest, that isa factor which you may properly consider in
determining whether or-not she was a:meniber of 4 conspiracy charged. in the Indictment.

Once:a conspiracy: is formed, it'is presumed to continueuntil, cither its objective jis
accomplished or there: is some affirmative act. of termination, by the members. So too, once.a.
person is found to’ be a:member of'a.conspiracy, she is presumed to continue as a member in the:
conspiracy until the conspiracy is terminated, unless 'it:is shown by some affirmative proof that
the person withdrew and disassociated herself:from it.

In:sum, the defendant, with an understanding of the unlawful nature of the conspiracy, may
have intentionally engaged, advised, or assisted, in the conspiracy for the purpose of ‘furthering an,
illegal undertaking. The defendant thereby becomes a knowing «and willing participant in, the

unlawful agreement—that is to say, she’becomes a conspirator.
