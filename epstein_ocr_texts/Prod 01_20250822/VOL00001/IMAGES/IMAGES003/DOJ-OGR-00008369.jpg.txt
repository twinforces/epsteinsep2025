Brad Edwards.

A U-Visa. affords a special immigration. status to, victims of certain crimes, iricluding sex
‘crimes, who have suffered mental or, physical abuse and arc helpful to. law ‘enforcement or
government officials in the investigation or prosecution. of criminal. activity.! Because providing
help to the government is:a.condition of cligibility:for U-Visa, and because the government must
support.the individual’s application. by. attesting to her being helpful, see 8 U.S.C.
§'1101(a)(15)(U)G); 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p), an alleged ‘victim’s desire for a U-Visa is powerful
‘evidence of motive:and bias.

During cross-examination, however, Kate denied, wanting a-U-Visa or beginning ‘the:
process of obtaining a U-Visa. TR.at 1276. Material produced bythe. government, however,
shows that Katc’s attorney, Brad.Edwards, provided a‘U-Visa application,to the government on,
behalf.of Kate during a. proffer session. TR.at- 1285. (3513-045). Ms. Maxwell intends, to
question Mr. Edwards about'this topic.

There is nothing privileged about Mr. Edwards’ providing a U-Visa application to the
government. on. behalf of Kate. That testiniony doés ‘riot reveal a.confidential Communication
between. Mr. Edwards.and Kate. See.Lric, 473 F.3d-at 419. But.even if it did, Mr. Edwards’
‘statements to the government during the proffer session and his ‘act of providing the application

on behalf of Kate amount'to a'waiver of whatever privilege that may have existed. Sée Fed. R.
