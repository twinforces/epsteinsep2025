A U-Visa affords a special immigration status to victims of certain crimes, including sex
crimes, who have suffered mental or physical abuse and are helpful to law enforcement or
government officials in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity. Because providing
help to the government is a condition of eligibility for U-Visa, and because the government must
support the individual’s application by attesting to her being helpful, see 8 U.S.C.

§ 1101(a)(15)(U)(i); 8 U.S.C. § 1184(p), an alleged victim’s desire for a U-Visa is powerful
evidence of motive and bias.

During cross-examination, however, Kate denied wanting a U-Visa or beginning the
process of obtaining a U-Visa. TR at 1276. Material produced by the government, however,
shows that Kate’s attorney, Brad Edwards, provided a U-Visa application to the government on
behalf of Kate during a proffer session. TR at 1285. (3513-045). Ms. Maxwell intends to
question Mr. Edwards about this topic.

There is nothing privileged about Mr. Edwards’ providing a U-Visa application to the
government on behalf of Kate. That testimony does not reveal a confidential communication
between Mr. Edwards and Kate. See Erie, 473 F.3d at 419. But even if it did, Mr. Edwards’
statements to the government during the proffer session and his act of providing the application
on behalf of Kate amount to a waiver of whatever privilege that may have existed. See Fed. R.
Evid. 502(a); Steinhardt Partners, 9 F.3d at 236; 1 McCormick on Evid., § 93.
