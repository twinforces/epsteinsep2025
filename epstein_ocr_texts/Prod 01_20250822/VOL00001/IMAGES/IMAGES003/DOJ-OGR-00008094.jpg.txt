B. The government’s motion is not a Rule 702 challenge.

The government’s motion invokes Federal Rule of Evidence 702. That rule says:

A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training,

or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if:

(a) the expert’s scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the

trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;

(b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;

(c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and

(d) the expert has reliably applied the principles and methods to the facts of the

case.
Fed. R. Evid. 702.

Despite relying on Rule 702, the government’s motion has little if anything to do with it.
The essence of Rule 702 are the requirements that a witness must be qualified to offer expert
opinions and that his opinions must be reliable. Fed. R. Evid. 702(b)-(d). Here, however, the
government concedes the expertise of Dr. Hall and the reliability of his opinions.
