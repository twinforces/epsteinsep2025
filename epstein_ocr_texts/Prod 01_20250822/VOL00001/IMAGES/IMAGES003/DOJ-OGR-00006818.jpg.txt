e “... It was expected that a connection would be found between the
child’s symptom and the seduction, which was assumed to be the trau-
matic factor .. .” (Bornstein, 1946, p. 230).

e “... [Where father or mother, either consciously or unconsciously,
elevate the child into a substitute sexual partner or commit real acts of
seduction with him...” (A. Freud, 1968, p. 45).

e “If we assume that the term ‘seduction’ refers to any kind of sexual
encounter, it can range from milder types, such as exposing oneself
and enticing the child to follow suit, all the way to forcible rape”
(Finch, 1974, p. 34).

e “She was then able to use the dolls to reveal the drama of her own
seduction and the ensuing family chaos...” (Mrazek, 1980, p. 279).

Here “seduction” is not referring to the process by which a child is
groomed or seduced but to the offensive event itself. Freud’s seduction
hypothesis “.. . generalized that the roots of all adult neuroses lay in child-
hood sexual contacts with adults” (Gagnon, 1965, p. 177). The vagueness of
this use of “seduction” makes it impossible to determine which child sexual
abuse behaviors are and are not encompassed by the term and suggests that
“seduction” may mean different specific things to different authors.

Authors sometimes imply that “seduction” does not include violence, as when
they distinguish it from rape or other violent assaults, as in these examples:

e “Klein has stated that an experience of seduction or rape by a grown-
up person may have serious effects upon the child’s psychic develop-
ment...” (Bender & Blau, 1937, p. 500).

e “(T]he possible ... event of seduction, incest, or rape .. .” (Lewis &
Sarrel, 1969, p. 606).

e “Violence is rarely found to accompany the incestuous act, possibly
because seduction, passive compliance, or sexual curiosity or explora-
tion promote such relationships” (Singer, 1979, p. 8).

e “Children can be broken much more easily than adults, and the effect
on them of torture, hatred, seduction, and rape—or even of indiffer-
ence, of deprivation of love and care—is the devastating one of devel-
opmental arrest .. .” (Shengold, 1979, p. 537).

Although this usage comports with the modern idea of seduction or
grooming insofar as it is to be distinguished from the use of force, threats, or
violence, we would not today distinguish seduction from rape but rather
would view seduction (or grooming) as a means of completing a rape or other
sexual offense with minimal resistance or risk of disclosure.
