United States District Court —
‘Southern District, of New York

New York, NY 10007

Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20. Cr. 330 (AIN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

[write following our conferral with-the government about protecting the anonymity of.
certain, testifying witnesses in this case. ‘The government suggested to us that, we:must avoid any.
‘public mention.of: (1), names of people, places, or:specific addresses or locations; (2) particular
dates. of career events. or life events; (3):names of'any employers, particular. performances, or
characters played; (4) specific details of story arcs.in.any performanecs played; (5): references, to
publicly available information.or publicly available records that contain a:pscudonymous,
witness’s real name; and.(6) court filings or other court documents.

Respectfully, the government’s, proposal is overly. broad and’unworkable.

We aré mindful. ofthe, Court’s orders on this:topie, and we have no, objection.to many of
the government’s'suggestions—e.g., the names of people: or'specific addresses or particular
employers. But the government’s proposal reaches ‘much too far, and it would ‘unfairly constrain
Ms. Maxwell’s- ability to meaningfully:and effectively confront her accusers.. U.S. Const.:amend.
