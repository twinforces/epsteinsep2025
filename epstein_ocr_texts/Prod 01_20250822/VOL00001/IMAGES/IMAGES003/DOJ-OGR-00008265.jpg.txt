Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20 Cr. 330 (AJN)
Dear Judge Nathan,

This is at least the third attempt by the government to admit an unreliable exhibit of
unknown origin. The problems are manifold, as this Court is aware.

When the government last sought admission, after the testimony of Juan Alessi, this
Court reserved ruling, recognizing that Mr. Alessi had neither authenticated Exhibit 52 nor laid
the required foundation for its admission under Rule 803(6).

Rest assured, promised the government, it would fill in the blanks through the testimony
of Employee-1. But the government no longer plans to call Employee-1 as a witness, so it’s left
with a record this Court already deemed inadequate to justify admission of the exhibit.

Undeterred, the government now, for the very first time, points to something else—Ms.
Maxwell’s April 2016 civil deposition. The government claims that Ms. Maxwell’s deposition
testimony authenticates Exhibit 52.

The government is wrong, for at least two obvious reasons. First, the exhibit Ms.
Maxwell was shown in her deposition (Deposition Exhibit 13) is not the same thing as Exhibit

DOJ-OGR-00008265
