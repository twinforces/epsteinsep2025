‘The Honorable Alison J. Nathan
United States District Court —
‘Southern District, of New York
40 Foley Square:
New York, NY 10007
Re: — United States v. Ghislaine Maxwell, 20. Cr. 330 (AIN)
Dear Judge Nathan,
This is .at.lcast:the-third attempt by the government to admit an unreliable exhibit of.
unknown origin. The problems are manifold, as this Court is aware.
When. the government last sought admission, after the testimony of Juan Alessi, this
Court reserved ruling, recognizing that Mr. Alessi. had ‘ncither authenticated Exhibit 52 nor laid.
the required foundation.for its admission. under Rule 803(6).
Rest assured, promised the government, it'would fill in the blanks through the testimony
‘of Employce-]. But the government no longer plans to call Employce-1 as'a witness, so it’s left
with a record this ‘Court already deemed inadequate to justify admission. of the exhibit.
Undeterred, the government now, forthe, very'first time, points to something ¢lsc—Ms.
‘testimony authenticates Exhibit. 52.
The government is ‘wrong, for at.least:two ‘obvious reasons. First, the exhibit Ms.

Maxwell was ‘shown in-her deposition. (Deposition, Exhibit 13).is not the same‘thing as Exhibit

DOJ-OGR-00008265
