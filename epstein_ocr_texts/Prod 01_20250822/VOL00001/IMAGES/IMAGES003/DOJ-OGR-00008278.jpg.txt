e A large cntry‘rclating to Epstein. GX-52-H.
° A series of entries relating to the defendant’s family, including many‘with multiple phone:
numbers: GX=52-E.

Tellingly; the defense has failed'to point to:any entry, in this: book-that is inaccurate, despite

the fact. that the book contains hundreds—if not thousands—of points of contact. A jury could.
reasonably conclude from the content of the book, in Combination with Alessi’s testiniony, ‘that:
this contact book. in. fact belonged. to Epstein. and. the defendant. That is all. that is required for
authentication.

Finally, the Government notes that the defendant’s challenge to the authenticity of
Government ‘Exhibit. 52 relies heavily on the circumstances through which, the Government:
obtained the book, namely, by seizing 'it-from Alfredo Redriguez.. See, e:g.,.Mot., Dkt. No; 390.at-
3; Letter, Dkt. .No. 490. To the extent the Court exercises its gatckeeping function. through.
examination of evidence that the jury is not considering, the’ Government:notes that the defendant.
herself has acknowledged the authenticity of the: contact book.

Specifically, in-her April 20.16 deposition, the: defendant was confronted with a ‘document
that appears. to be'a,scan of the, contact. book ‘and some:additional pages. (See Exhibit.A. (Maxwell.
Deposition Ex. 13)), When, shown the sean, ‘the. defendant. was asked. whether’ she. ‘was, familiar
with the document, and she replied that she was ‘familiar with the “actual document.” (Exhibit B

(Maxwell Depo. Tr.),at-312). She said that-she belicved “that this,is a,copy of a stolen document,”
