and “would love to know how [plaintiffs counsel] got it.” /d. at 316. The defendant was further
asked whether, “during the time you worked for Jeffrey Epstein, was there a hardcopy document
of any kind that kept phone numbers for Jeffrey Epstein, if he needed to contact someone?” Jd.
She replied: “The stolen document I have in front of me is what you are referring to.” /d. Finally,
when asked whether she had access to “a hardcopy document that she could refer to to find
someone’s number,” she replied that “This is, J believe, the book that was stolen, that was the
hardcopy of whatever was there.” /d. at 317 (emphasis added). And she repeated that “This book
— if this is what this is, / believe it was, this is the stolen document from his house.” /d. at 317
(emphasis added).4

In sum, Government Exhibit 52 has been extensively authenticated. Alessi and the
household manual establish that the practice at the Epstein house was to regularly make and use
contact books through 2005. Alessi and significant other documentary and testimonial evidence
from the case show that Government Exhibit 52 is one such contact book. And, in case there were
any doubt, the defendant herself looked at a scan of this book and came to the same conclusion.
Government Exhibit 52 should be admitted.
‘The defendant denied being involved in the creation of the document and said that she had
stopped working for Epstein by the time this document was created. See, e.g., Tr. at 313, 323.
