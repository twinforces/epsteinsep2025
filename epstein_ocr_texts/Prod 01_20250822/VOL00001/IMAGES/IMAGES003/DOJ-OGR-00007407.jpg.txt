Dear Judge Nathan:

On behalf of our elicnt, Ghislainc.Maxwell, we respectfully submit this Ictter in response
to'the government’s letter motion, dated November, I], 2021, requesting’ that:the Court, find that
the birth. certificates forthe alleged Minor Victims (GX-11 through GX-16) are self-authenticating

We have reviewed the government’s submission and, in the interests of facilitating an,
efficient'trial,, we: are: prepared to stipulate to the authenticity of the birth certificates for alleged
Minor Victim-1 (GX-12), Minor Victim-2 (GX-13), Minor Vietim-4 (GX-1.1), Minor Victim-5
(GX-14), and.Minor Victim-6 (GX-15). We will coordinate with the government to produce: an
appropriately worded:stipulation.as to'the authenticity ofthese exhibits.

However, the government. itself concedes that it has not-yet:proffered.a sufficient
foundation to authenticate the birth certificate of Witness-3 (GX-16). See 11/11/2021. Gow't-Ltr. at
| n.2. According to.GX-16, Witness-3 was born[ i. Incorder for sucha
record to be self-authcnticating as.a foreign:public. document, the government must meet the

requirements of Rule 902(3) of the Federal. Rules of Evidence, which. it:has not yet done. The
